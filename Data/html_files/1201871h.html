<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;VERITY &amp; CO., LTD.</h2>
<p>The offices of Verity &amp; CO. were situated in Great Bower Street, and had
been a feature there for over two centuries. An old-fashioned easy-going firm
from the old days, and spoken of with good-natured contempt by more progressive
rivals, they were still out in the markets of the world for business, albeit
there had not been a Verity in the firm for more than fifty years. They called
themselves general merchants trading in mixed cargoes from all parts of the
world and, as men go, Mortimer Croot, the present sole proprietor, was regarded
as a man of integrity and substance. For fifteen years he had been manager and
confidential clerk to an ailing owner, and when the latter was no more Croot
quite naturally stepped into all there was left of the once great concern,
together with the freehold house in Great Bower Street where the business was
carried on. He was a man of fifty now, but looking a great deal less with his
alert easy carriage and wiry upright figure and those blue-grey eyes looking
out searchingly under shaggy brows. It seemed strange to those who knew him
that Croot should be content to carry on in much the same way as his
predecessors had done, and in the same old grimy offices looking out at the
back on the Thames and in front contemplating a street of gloom and dirt as
dingy and ruinous as a decayed tooth in an otherwise healthy set. Not a penny
had been spent there any time the last three decades; no paint had brightened
up the black front of those offices, which were just the same as they had been
when George III was king and the Verities lived over the offices and
warehouses, and footpads roamed the waterways by the river and the City lanes
almost unmolested. The walls of the house were thick enough to withstand a
siege almost, and most of the gloomy offices had iron bars still in front of
the windows on the ground floor and basement. Behind the house lay a wide bare
strip of ground which had once been a flourishing landing-place bordering on
the river, and this was still known as Crombies Wharf, though it had been
derelict as long as anyone in the City could remember. There were buildings on
it still, strong buildings made of stone and with small windows now all boarded
up as a protection against such of the Thames-side youth as disported
themselves there after the tide of business had turned for the day. But Croot
only smiled when it was suggested to him that he might get good money for this
derelict land, and hinted vaguely that he knew what he was doing, and that in
time his business friends would find that he was not so easy-going as he
looked. So long as he had all he needed with enough for his wants and a little
to spare and his charming house at Cray presided over by his adopted daughter
Vera, he was not going to worry himself about money-grubbing...</p>
<p>The daily task was nearly over, and most of the staff had already left with
the exception of the confidential clerk, Mark Gilmour, Miss Patricia Langley,
private secretary and typist, and Geoffrey Rust, a subordinate who held a
somewhat remarkable position in the office. He was a young man obviously set in
the mould that turns out the clean and healthy athlete from our great public
schools and universities. Not particularly handsome, for his features were too
irregular, but very wholesome and good to look at, as more than one of his lady
friends willingly testified. He was exceedingly well-dressed, his manners were
easy and perfect, and he gave the idea of one who has not a single care in the
world.</p>
<p>Discipline was relaxed now, and Rust was laughing and chatting with Patricia
Langley in the outer office, beyond which the head of the firm was still at his
desk. Pat Langley was a dark vivacious beauty, rather small, but with a perfect
figure and a smiling face, which was, however, full of strength and resolution,
as befitted one who, well-born and educated, had found herself face to face
with the world at twenty-one, and had risen superior to her troubles. And she
liked Geoffrey Rust perhaps more than she knew.</p>
<p>"Something attempted, something done, to earn a night's repose," Rust
chanted. "Do you like the strenuous life, Pat?"</p>
<p>"Have you ever tried it?" the girl asked dryly.</p>
<p>"Oh, come! Haven't I been here every day for two years bar holidays? Am I
not the little ray of sunshine in the office? But, thank goodness, my sentence
is nearly worked out."</p>
<p>"And you come into your inheritance," Pat said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Regular romance, isn't it?" Rust said, showing his even teeth in that
attractive smile of his. "City idyll with the real <i>Daily Recorder</i> flair.
Pathetic orphan and only son of the type of Roman father who lives for business
and never sees his loving offspring if he can avoid it. Dies in Spartan
solitude, leaving a will to the effect that his white-haired boy shall, on
leaving Oxford, go into a City office for two years and earn his living by the
sweat of his brow for the said two years or forfeit his&mdash;what's the
word?&mdash;patrimony. And I've done it, Pat. Now that it is nearly finished I
don't regret it. Otherwise I should never have met you."</p>
<p>Patricia Langley smiled with a shadow of wild rose on her cheeks. Before she
could reply Mortimer Croot came out of his office with his hat and overcoat on.
He smiled in his turn. There was very little of the martinet about the head of
the firm.</p>
<p>"I'm going now, Miss Langley," he said. "You might post the private letters
that I have left on my desk. I shall have the pleasure of meeting you both
again to-night, so I will not say adieu. Rust, you might tell Gilmour that I
want him a moment."</p>
<p>Gilmour came in, well set up, grim and clean-shaven, with his suggestion of
strength and reserve, very like a well-educated and gentlemanly prize-fighter,
as Rust always thought. In the office it was whispered that Gilmour had a past,
though nobody really knew anything, and Gilmour himself never made a friend of
any of them. He had come there three years ago, and Croot had simply stated
that in future everybody must take their orders from Gilmour whenever the head
of the firm was absent. And so it remained.</p>
<p>"You wanted me, sir?" Gilmour asked in his quiet way.</p>
<p>"Only just to remind you," Croot replied genially. "Don't forget it is my
little girl's birthday dinner to-night. We shall be disappointed if you turn us
down, Gilmour."</p>
<p>Croot smiled pleasantly enough, but it seemed to Rust, usually the most
unsuspecting of mortals, that he detected a challenge in his employer's eyes,
and an answering gleam in Gilmour's.</p>
<p>"I'll do my best, sir," the latter replied. "But those last lot of
quotations must be posted to-night. If I can't manage it, may I come down some
time later in the evening, sir?"</p>
<p>Croot replied suitably, and Gilmour went back to his office. He was the sort
of man who seems to love work for its own sake, and most evenings he was at his
post till late and everybody else had gone, letting himself out and locking up,
for the firm were of the old type that did not employ a resident watchman.</p>
<p>"I never cottoned to that chap somehow," Rust said to Miss Langley as they
turned into the street. "And I hope he will never capture our little Vera. But
I don't think Croot would stand that. Besides, Jack Ellis would have a word to
say. May I walk as far as Cannon Street with you?"</p>
<p>Pat Langley also lived at Cray, and when Rust had seen her into her train he
called a taxi and was wafted off to his own luxurious quarters in Orchard
Street, for his daily work in the City by no means implied that he was on short
commons so far as money was concerned. And very soon he would be his own
master.</p>
<p>Though he passed most of his days in the dingy, dilapidated offices in Great
Bower Street, Geoffrey Rust had his own circle of friends in the West End, and,
of course, the fellow employ&eacute;s in the firm of Verity &amp; Co. knew very
little about this. So long as Geoffrey complied with what he regarded as the
onerous terms of his father's will, what he did with his spare time was his own
business entirely. Before he went home to his rooms in Orchard Street to dress
for the dinner that Croot was giving that night in honour of his adopted
daughter's birthday at the Moat House, Cray, which the young man would reach in
his own car, he turned into the United Field Club for a cigarette and a cup of
tea, and a chat with such kindred spirits in the world of sport as he was
likely to meet there. The smoking-room was empty when he entered, and presently
there came in a man who hailed him with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This was his own particular friend Jack Ellis. He and Ellis had been at the
same public school, and subsequently at Oxford together, where they had played
for their College cricket eleven, and were both finally tried for the
university team. They had neither of them got quite far enough for that
crowning glory, but they were well known as two polished and reliable bats, and
members of the famous and exclusive M.C.C. At holiday times they toured the
country together, playing in various local cricket festivals, where they were
both welcome guests.</p>
<p>Ellis, however, had his own living to get. He was an Irishman, and the only
son of a man who had been a popular K.C. in his time, and who had died before
he could achieve the fortune which at one time had seemed inevitable. He had,
however, given his son what had seemed to him to be the best of educations, and
when he died, Jack had to look to himself. He had been called to the Bar a year
or two before, and, whilst waiting for briefs, was obtaining quite a good
living in free-lance journalism. He had a graphic and fluent pen, and a
positive thirst for adventure. He was a man utterly without fear, brave, and
strong, with a strength which his somewhat slender figure altogether belied. He
knew the East End like an open book; he had been in opium dens and dubious
public houses, where many a robbery had been planned, and on more than one
occasion had rendered Scotland Yard a distinct service. Just at the present
moment he was deeply interested in the amazing series of robberies which were
taking place almost daily on the Thames. Barges and lighters had been relieved
of thousands of pounds' worth of valuable goods, and the river-police were at
their wits' end to lay their hands upon the most daring and ingenious set of
water-rats that the head of the service had come in contact with for many a
long day. Ellis had suggested to the editor of the <i>Daily Telephone</i> that
he should take up the matter on behalf of that great journal, and do his best
to succeed where the authorities had failed. He pointed out that nothing might
come of it, but if, on the other hand, he achieved success, then it would be a
wonderful advertisement for the smartest of the morning journals.</p>
<p>The editor of the paper in question had jumped at the suggestion; he had
placed ample funds at Ellis's discretion, and, for three months now, the latter
had haunted the lower regions of the Thames almost night and day. So far, he
had had no substantial success, but he was on the track of a daring and utterly
unscrupulous gang now, and his hopes were high. During the past year, thieves
had stolen from various lighters and barges property to the value of nearly a
million sterling, and though some of the smaller fry had fallen into the hands
of the police, the big men behind the conspiracy were, as yet, unknown. And
they were quite big men, some of them, as Ellis had good reason to know.
Despite his hot Irish blood, and that quick impulsiveness of his, he had a
wonderful patience which would have surprised his friends, had they only known
of it, and so he was waiting his time till he could strike a blow at the very
root of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>Something of this he had confided to Rust; at any rate, Rust knew what his
friend was doing, and on more than one occasion he had been out at night on the
river in the swift little petrol launch which the <i>Telephone</i> had placed
at the disposal of their commissioner. There was just the spice of danger about
the proceeding which appealed to Rust's sporting instincts. It was he who
introduced Ellis to the household at the Moat House, and, therefore, was more
or less responsible for the fact that the Irishman had fallen over head and
ears in love with Croot's adopted daughter, Vera.</p>
<p>"Ah, here we are," Ellis cried. "And, bedad, you are just the man I want to
see. If you've got nothing better to do, perhaps you would like to join me
to-night."</p>
<p>"An adventure, Sir Galahad, an adventure," Rust smiled. "I gather from your
manner that it is something big, eh?"</p>
<p>"Well, that is as it may be," Ellis said a little more seriously. "But I am
on the track, my boy, I'm on the track, and when the explosion comes, it will
be a mighty big one. The man behind the whole scheme is a prize fish, and the
public will sit up and take notice when the <i>Telephone</i> is in a position
to speak. It is only a side show to-night, but if it comes off, then I shall
have my fingers on a thread that ought to lead right to the centre of the web.
I'd like to count upon you, Geoffrey."</p>
<p>"It sounds tempting enough," Rust observed. "But I am afraid there is
nothing doing, so far as I am concerned. I have got an engagement I cannot
possibly get out of. You see, it's Vera Croot's twentieth birthday, and the old
man is giving a dinner in her honour at the Moat House."</p>
<p>Ellis's smiling face clouded slightly.</p>
<p>"Begad, I had almost forgotten that," he said. "In happier circumstances, I
should be there myself, but old man Croot has a strong illogical prejudice
against me. He seems to have got it into his head that I am keen on Vera
myself."</p>
<p>"Well, isn't it true?" Rust asked.</p>
<p>"Bejabers, you're right there, old man, and I'll not deny it to an old
friend like yourself. I was a fool, Geoff, I ought to have kept my thoughts to
myself. Vera knows all about them, bless her, and she is just as miserable
about the whole business as I am. Then, one night, three months ago, when I
still had the run of Moat House, and was dining there, I was fool enough to
sound the old man on the subject of the little darlin'. But I think I told you
all about it before."</p>
<p>"I seem to have some recollection of it," Rust said dryly.</p>
<p>"Ah, now it's poking fun at me, you are. And I am dead in earnest, and if
Vera is only willing I'll marry her in the face of a thousand Croots. She is
not his flesh and blood, after all, and I am making enough to keep her quite
comfortably. But what's the use of me talking like this? I have got the key of
the street, so far as the Moat House is concerned, with a strong hint not to
show my face there again. Oh, the old man was friendly enough, very bland and
fatherly, and sort of sorry for the white-haired boy who dared to lift his eyes
to one of the prettiest girls in the country, and a great heiress to boot. But
he hasn't done with Jack Ellis yet."</p>
<p>As he spoke, Ellis dropped his voice and a fighting gleam came into his
eyes. Something had evidently stirred him to the depths, and, just for a
moment, the sunny, inconsequent Irishman had disappeared, and the primitive man
seemed to be carved on his face.</p>
<p>"Why, what's the matter?" Rust cried.</p>
<p>"Ah, well," Ellis said, obviously forcing a laugh. "Tragedy is not in my
line, though I have been getting pretty close to it in the last few days. But
let's forget it. Perhaps you think I have overlooked the fact of Vera's
birthday, but not so, my son, not so. I have a little thing here in my pocket
that I want you to give her to-night when you get a quiet opportunity, and tell
her that Jack Ellis is not the man to change."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," Rust said. "There are hidden depths in you, Jack, that few
people give you credit for. But I know, and if all goes well, then Vera will be
a lucky girl."</p>
<p>"That is very nice of you, Geoff," Ellis said with a certain sincerity. "I
don't know so much about being a lucky girl, but I shall be a very fortunate
man. And how is your little affair going on? You know what I mean!"</p>
<p>"What little affair are you speaking about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, come off it, Geoff; you never were made for a diplomatist. Vera isn't
the only girl in the world. I was speaking of Patricia Langley. Do you think I
am blind?"</p>
<p>"Ah, well," Rust said. "I suppose onlookers see most of the game. But Pat
Langley has her father to think of. As long as the poor old major is in his
present state of health she is not likely to listen to anything that I have to
say. We are very good friends, and, indeed, I hope something more, but for the
present I have to possess my soul in patience."</p>
<p>"Then, bedad, we're in the same boat," Ellis cried. "Still, you are a
bloated plutocrat, living on unearned increment, and I am a poor devil of a
hack journalist. Now, just let's have one cocktail together, and I must be off.
I am only too sorry that I haven't you to rely upon to-night."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;CROMBIES WHARF</h2>
<p>Left to himself in the solitude of the dingy old offices in Great Bower
Street, Mark Gilmour sat down at his desk in a small back room looking out over
the Thames, and proceeded to immerse himself in a mass of correspondence. He
had the whole office for his own since the last of the clerks had departed, and
a supreme silence reigned everywhere. At that hour in the evening Great Bower
Street was absolutely deserted, for it was a business quarter entirely, and,
save for a caretaker or night watchman here and there, there was probably not a
soul within a quarter of a mile. Outside a gentle rain had commenced to fall
through a curtain of fog, which rendered the young March night thick as a
blanket. From time to time Gilmour could hear shouts and calls from the river,
and occasionally a heavy dray rumbled along the cobbled street. The mice were
busy behind the rotting wainscot and the decayed oak panelling on the walls.
Once a rat ran across the floor, and dived into a hole by the side of what once
had been a magnificent marble fireplace in the old days when Great Bower Street
had been a residential quarter for opulent City merchants, what time George III
was king. A big grandfather's clock ticked lazily in the corner of the office,
and as it struck the hour of eight Gilmour rose and put away the mass of papers
before him in a safe.</p>
<p>He appeared to have forgotten entirely that, at that very moment, he was due
to dine at the Moat House, and if he had any recollection of this, then there
was no sign of disappointment or regret upon that hard, white, battling face of
his.</p>
<p>Long before this, he had closed the shutters of the office facing the river,
so that not a single ray of light showed through the dusty, cobweb-clad window
panes. He listened with a certain dour satisfaction to the dripping rain
outside, then he crossed over and pressed his hand upon a spring in the centre
of one of the oak panels, which seemed to release a slide, for one of the
panels slipped back, exposing a square dark space beyond, from which he took a
luncheon basket and carelessly emptied the contents upon the table. He ate the
half of a chicken, and drank one or two whiskies and sodas, after which he put
the basket back in its hiding-place and took from the same hidden receptacle a
suit of blue dungaree overalls and a pair of top boots, india-rubber shod,
which he drew over his own neat brown brogues.</p>
<p>Once this was done, he placed an electric torch in his pocket and went down
into the black airless basement. This was devoted to offices now, and
store-rooms for old ledgers and papers. Right at the back of what once had been
a scullery was a flat stone in the floor, which Gilmour lifted with apparent
ease, disclosing a flight of steps below, leading, presumedly, into the bowels
of the earth. He flashed his torch into this forbidding opening, and whistled a
few bars between his teeth. Then a head appeared, followed by a body, and
Gilmour was no longer alone.</p>
<p>"That's right, Joe," he said. "Nothing like being punctual. What sort of a
night is it?"</p>
<p>"A real beauty for us," the intruder said, in a voice that was hard and
husky. "Black as your hat, and a fine rain falling. Can't see your hand in
front of you. I have known the river pretty well all my life, but it took me
all my time to get across. Got anything to drink about, mister?"</p>
<p>Without further preamble, Gilmour led the way up the stairs into his office.
He watched his visitor keenly as the latter proceeded to pour a generous
measure of almost raw spirit down his throat. He saw a short, thick-set
individual with broad shoulders and legs like pillars standing before him, a
man with a hard repulsive face and dreadful bloodshot eyes that bespoke a
nature capable of anything. In his thick pilot jacket and trousers he conveyed
the impression of one who is familiar with the sea and, indeed, his appearance
did not belie him, for Joe Airey had been bred and born on the Thames side, and
had passed most of his life in coasting vessels, and at one time might, indeed,
have become a Thames pilot, but for the fact that he had found it impossible to
remain sober for a week at a time. For the rest, he was utterly unscrupulous,
hated work in every shape or form, but was ready to undergo untold danger and
prolonged privation if he could only see a suitable reward at the end of it. He
had been in jail more than once, and it was characteristic of the man that he
was not in the least ashamed of the fact. From Gilmour's point of view he was a
treasure, and the money that constantly found its way into his pocket from
Croot's manager was exceedingly well-earned.</p>
<p>"It's a rare nice crib you've got 'ere, guv'nor," Airey exclaimed, as he
glanced round the room. "Safer than any church, and bang on the spot. Might
have been made for our purpose."</p>
<p>"I suspect it was," Gilmour said with one of his acid smiles. "You may
depend upon it that the original Verity did a good deal in the smuggling line,
or he would have blocked up those passages long ago. You see, this house was
once part of the Tower defences, hence that secret waterway at the side of
Crombies Wharf, and the underground passage leading to the house. But we
needn't worry about that. What have you got to-night?"</p>
<p>"Magnetos," Airey whispered hoarsely. "About fifty cases of them, a nice
compact little cargo, not taking up much room, and worth Gawd knows what, once
we get 'em back to Germany again. But that's your business, guv'nor. I taps the
stuff, and you shoves it away. Been trackin' it for days, I 'ave. They unloads
it off the steamer <i>Konig,</i> and tows it up the river in a barge, not three
hundred yards away, waiting to be unloaded, and only one man aboard and 'im not
very much good."</p>
<p>"Lord, what a set of fools they are," Gilmour muttered. "After all the
warnings they have had, too. Only one man, you say?"</p>
<p>"Well, there was two, guv'nor," Airey laughed coarsely. "But one of 'em put
ashore for a drink, and 'e goes into one of the pubs we knows of, so I follows
and gives the landlord a tip, and they put 'im to sleep proper between them.
The cove I speak of won't be aboard the barge much afore to-morrow night,
anyway."</p>
<p>"Then we had better get along," Gilmour said.</p>
<p>He was the man of action now, keen-eyed, quick and alert, with his fighting
jaw stuck out, and a resolute look on his face. Satisfying himself that the
front door was closed and fastened, he made his way, followed by his companion,
into the scullery, and thence down the stone steps along a slimy dripping
passage that ended presently in a large room, not unlike an underground
swimming-bath, which was situated in the very foundations of the ruined
building with the boarded-up windows on Crombies Wharf. There was at least five
feet of water on the floor, and floating on it a small collapsible launch
driven by a small but powerful motor engine.</p>
<p>"Ah, what a beauty," Airey said huskily. "The fastest little craft on the
Thames. And silent, too, as mother's grave. But we'd better get along, guv'nor."</p>
<p>"If the tide is right," Gilmour said.</p>
<p>"Which it is, mister. It's right for two hours, anyway. You get up the
grating, and we'll be off."</p>
<p>Without further comment Gilmour proceeded to set certain unseen machinery in
motion. Then the slimy wooden wall at the far side of the building rose slowly
and creakily some four or five feet, disclosing a sort of slip berth capable of
holding a large barge beyond, and a few minutes later the launch had slid out
of this on to the bosom of the Thames, where the ebb-tide was running strongly.
On this, Airey took the helm and, pausing a moment to get his bearings, shot
out into mid-stream. There were lights here and there, and occasionally some
shouted order on the deck of an unseen steamer that loomed up, ghostly in the
fog, through the curtain of fine rain. It was as if they had drifted into
another world, but Airey knew exactly what he was doing, and steered the silent
little launch along as if he were in the broad light of day.</p>
<p>They came presently with intense caution, and just touched the side of a
barge. Airey made the launch secure, and then he and his companion climbed
softly on to the deck. It was littered with small packages in deal cases, and
Airey chuckled under his breath as he called Gilmour's attention to them.</p>
<p>"There's the stuff," he whispered. "All very politely and kindly laid out for
us, as if we was expected. It almost goes to one's 'eart to rob people as
confiding as them. No, we'll just go down the caboose and truss up the cove
down there, and with any luck, with two or three voyages, we'll 'ave the whole
of the boodle stowed away on the wharf in a couple of hours."</p>
<p>Silently as cats, they crossed the deck and crept down the companion ladder
into the cabin. A man smoking a pipe and reading a newspaper was seated there
in an attitude of easy security, but he was not quite as indifferent to his
surroundings as the intruders had thought. His ear had caught a suspicious
sound and, almost before Gilmour was in the cabin, he was on his feet. He
clutched an iron bar lying by the side of the table, and flung it with all his
force in Gilmour's face. It struck him on the shoulder and glanced off. Then
the man's face strangely altered, and a sudden cry broke from his lips.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Ray!" he exclaimed. "I thought you was dead. What are you doing
here, you dirty dog?"</p>
<p>Gilmour made no reply. He dashed headlong at the speaker, and caught him by
the throat. Airey hung on round the loins of the unfortunate watchman, who was
forced to his knees. But the fighting light still blazed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I know you," he said. "I know you now, and I know what you was doing when I
see you last week. Gawd, do you want to murder me? 'Ere, 'elp, 'elp. They'll do
for me."</p>
<p>"All right, I'm coming," a voice cried from the deck. "Hold on a minute,
Bill; fend 'em off."</p>
<p>It was then that Gilmour showed the stuff he was made of. He dashed his fist
to the point of the watchman's jaw, and the latter fell senseless without so
much as a groan. Five seconds later, Gilmour and Airey were on the deck of the
barge, and making for their boat. They waited not an instant to see in what
strength the allies were, but dropped into the launch and, a minute later, were
speeding for the shore, taking every risk in their headlong flight for safety.
They could hear the alarm raised, then a shot or two and, as if by magic, a
police boat came looming out of the fog almost on top of them. Followed another
shout and a shrill whistle, and a further police boat moved right across their
track. "There's only one thing to be done," Gilmour muttered. "Get out your
knife and slit her up, Joe."</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to tell, the trim little craft began to sink, and
the occupants were swimming for their lives. With his hand on Airey's shoulder,
Gilmour struck out, confident in the local knowledge of his companion. This was
not misplaced, for they came at length to the slip, and a few minutes later,
spent and breathless, were behind the screen under the old house in Crombies
Wharf. The screen was down at length, and they crept along the underground
passage till Gilmour's office was reached.</p>
<p>"There's isn't a moment to lose," he gasped. "Did you ever know such
infernal bad luck? The man on the barge recognized me; he was my boatswain's
mate for three years when I was serving on the China station. And, what's more,
he seems to know what I am doing. I shall have to bluff it out. I can't stay
here, and I can't get back to my rooms in these wet clothes. I've got it! You
cut across at once into Harbour Lane, and find George. Tell him to get his taxi
out at once, because I want him to drive me as far as a place called Cray, in
Kent. It's only about fifteen miles, and I ought to be there in an hour easy.
If Bill Avory&mdash;that's the man on the barge&mdash;opens his mouth to the
police, as he is pretty sure to, and if he really knows who I am, or what I am
doing in this part of the world, they are certain to go round to my rooms to
inquire. I told my landlady I was dining at Cray, and that I shouldn't be back
till late. So she'll be all right. But don't stand staring at me, get a move
on. Tell George I will be waiting at the corner for him in ten minutes. Here,
stop a minute, I must have some dry clothes. Any old clothes of George's will
do. Now, be off."</p>
<p>Once alone, Gilmour sat there, not heeding the cold and damp, and conscious
only of the struggle for freedom. Then, when his patience was getting
exhausted, he heard the purr of an engine outside, and made his way into the
street where the taxi was awaiting him. He paused for a moment as he
entered.</p>
<p>"That's all right, George," he said. "You know where to go. And don't worry
about the speed limit. Get me to Cray as soon as you can, and drop me at the
corner of the lane not far from the Moat House. I can change inside the cab,
and you can do what you like with my wet clothes. Is the stuff inside?"</p>
<p>"That's all right, sir," the driver muttered.</p>
<p>In just under the hour the taxi reached Cray, and in his impromptu wardrobe,
Gilmour got out and made his way through the lodge gates to the front of the
house where he could see the lights blazing in the dining-room windows. A clock
somewhere was striking ten.</p>
<p>As he stood there, he could hear the sounds of gaiety and laughter inside,
then he crept forward, and very gently commenced to tap with his knuckles on
one of the window panes, not quickly, but two or three taps with intervals
between. Then it seemed to him that the conversation inside ceased, and he
smiled to himself grimly.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;A BROKEN LIFE</h2>
<p>Not more than twenty years ago the village of Cray had been a sporting
estate owned by the Langley family, of which Major Owen Langley had been the
head at the beginning of the twentieth century. He had distinguished himself in
the Boer War, from which he returned with every prospect of a successful
career. But the unfortunate death of his wife in the hunting field had left him
a comparatively young man with one little girl, and he had sent in his papers
and devoted himself to the managing of his estate and the bringing up of his
child, Patricia.</p>
<p>In those days, the brick and mortar octopus ever stretching out from the
Metropolis in search of fresh land to devour had been checked in a
south-easterly direction by the barrier of the Moat estate, and for some years
this had been a sort of oasis in the dreary waste of jerry-building orgies. But
eventually Major Owen Langley had found himself drawn into the vortex. His
revenues were falling, and he was compelled to find fresh avenues for the
upkeep of the family dignity. So he began mildly to speculate in building land,
under the guidance of the last of the Veritys, who lived then in an old Manor
House on the edge of the estate, and when Jasper Verity was no more, Mortimer
Croot took his place and, under his guidance, Major Langley plunged still
deeper.</p>
<p>And then, when Patricia was about seventeen, the crash came. It had come
quite unexpectedly, like a bolt from the blue on that particular summer evening
when Croot had walked over from the Manor House and had told Langley in plain
words exactly where he stood. Patricia still remembered that evening, how she
had sat in the drawing-room listening to voices in the library raised more and
more in anger, until a door had banged somewhere, and then there was silence.
She had heard her father pacing up and down the library, and then the sound of
a heavy fall which struck a sort of chill to her heart. She seemed to feel the
trouble in the air.</p>
<p>She found her father lying on the hearthrug, a mere fragment of humanity,
the shell of a man, with the soul and sense dead within it. And so, from that
day to this, Langley had remained. He had lost all power over his limbs, and
most of the control over his speech. There were days when he could say certain
things coherently, and when he could manage to drag himself from one chair to
another. But these intervals were few and far between, and for the most part he
passed his days in a sort of moody dream, though he seemed to recognize
Patricia's devotion and loving kindness.</p>
<p>But that was all, and then Patricia began to gather what had happened. They
were absolutely ruined; there was nothing left of the property, and even
Croot's exertions had resulted only in saving a pittance of a hundred a year
out of the wreck. And so it came about that the girl and her father found
themselves eventually in a little cottage just by the lodge gates, and Croot
and his adopted daughter became owner and tenant of the Moat House.</p>
<p>Patricia realized that it was absolutely imperative for her to do something,
and she very bravely learnt typewriting and shorthand, and accepted Croot's
offer of employment in the dingy old offices in Great Bower Street. And there
she had been diligently working for the last two years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cray estate was altered beyond recognition. Where fields and
covers had been, large houses, surrounded by their own grounds, stood. Where
the big orchard had been was now the prosperous and sinfully-expensive centre
for the Cray shops and banks. Only the Moat House itself remained, with its
charming grounds, and there Croot had been established for years.</p>
<p>He still took more than a passing interest in the unfortunate man who
occupied one of his cottages more as a matter of charity than anything else. On
Major Langley's good days, Croot frequently looked in and did his best to cheer
up the unhappy late owner of the Moat estate. But all to no purpose, for,
strange to say, Langley seemed to have conceived a bitter dislike for the man
whom most people regarded as his best friend. Not that Croot took this in bad
part; he recognized the mental affliction that lay at the back of it all, and
behaved accordingly. To Patricia herself, he was always the counsellor and
guide. He paid her handsomely, far more handsomely than her services warranted,
and she was not blind to the fact. Whatever her father might think in that dark
mind of his, she was grateful enough.</p>
<p>She came home on the evening of Vera Croot's birthday, and smilingly entered
the little sitting-room where her father was seated. It was quite a small room,
with a pleasant outlook over the Moat House grounds, and there Langley would
sit day after day, looking out as if seeing nothing, with Heaven knows what
queer thoughts mustered in the back of his diseased mind. He sat now in a big
arm-chair before the old-fashioned fire-place, with a shaded lamp on the little
table in the centre of the room. It was customary for one of the servants to
come there from the Moat House on most evenings and look after the afflicted
man's comfort until such time as Pat came back from the City. Then she would
get his evening meal, and afterwards play a sort of patience with him for an
hour or two until one of the gardeners from the Moat House came along and
helped to put the invalid to bed. Then, if Pat happened to be spending the
evening out, the man in question would remain in the kitchen of the cottage
until she returned.</p>
<p>"Well, dad," she said cheerfully. "And what sort of a day have you had?
Anybody been to see you?"</p>
<p>It happened to be one of Langley's best days, therefore he looked up with a
smile as Pat entered. He spoke slowly and painfully, but his words were clear
enough, and she could follow them.</p>
<p>"Oh, much the same as usual," he said. "The vicar came in this afternoon
and, after he had gone, Lady Broadley appeared. I have not been at all lonely,
my dear."</p>
<p>Then he seemed to lapse again into the old mood, and it was quite half an
hour before he looked up again with something like the light of reason in his
eyes. It was always like this, though there were sometimes days together when
he never spoke at all.</p>
<p>"I am going out this evening," Pat said, speaking much as a mother speaks to
a little child. "I think I told you that I was dining at the Moat House."</p>
<p>Something like a scowl deepened on the face of the invalid, and his
pitifully-slack mouth quivered. Pat watched him apprehensively, because this
was the ominous sign of one of those strange outbursts of rage of his, and they
were usually followed by a period of utter exhaustion that filled Pat with
anxiety.</p>
<p>"Don't you want me to go?" she asked. "I won't, if you would rather I stayed
at home. But then, you see, it's Vera's birthday, and if I am not there, she
will be cruelly disappointed. And you like Vera, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I like Vera well enough," the invalid said, in his slow, painful way.
"She is a very nice girl, and I am glad that she is no relation to Croot
really. She comes to see me nearly every day, and she always brings me
something. No, my child, you must not disappoint Vera, though if I had my
way&mdash;"</p>
<p>Langley broke off in some confusion and a glance in his daughter's direction
which puzzled her exceedingly. She knew her father in his dark moods, she knew
him in those dangerous bursts of rage of his, but she had never seen him with
the light of a great cunning in his eyes before. The mere suggestion filled her
with a sort of apprehension.</p>
<p>"I won't be late," she said. "And Sam will be here till I return. Mr. Croot
said he would look in presently."</p>
<p>"I don't want him," Langley burst out with amazing energy. "Tell him I won't
see him. I hate the fellow. If it hadn't been for him, we should be at the Moat
House to-day."</p>
<p>The words came clearly enough, with a certain vigour behind them, but they
were dragged out one by one, and curiously clipped at the end of each. Pat said
nothing, wisely waiting for the petulant fit to pass away. She could not quite
understand this phase of her father's mind. She could remember the day, and not
very far remote either, when he and Croot had apparently been the best of
friends. She could remember Croot warning the other more than once that some of
his speculations were rash to the verge of danger. And when the crash had come,
nobody could have been kinder and more considerate than Mortimer Croot. But for
him she would never have obtained that position in the City, and many a little
comfort enjoyed by the invalid would have been missing.</p>
<p>"All right," she said. "You shan't be worried unless you like. I will go up
to the house and tell him not to come. I will say you are not very well this
evening and don't want to be disturbed. I am sure he will understand."</p>
<p>Langley laid a shaking hand upon Pat's arm.</p>
<p>"You needn't do that," he mumbled. "I don't want you to do that. Let him
come if he likes, it's all the same to me. If he thought for an instant that
I&mdash;"</p>
<p>Again came the curious hesitation, and again came the look of cunning in
Langley's faded eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't you mind me, my dear," he went on. "Put up with me, it won't be for
much longer. I know I am a burden to everybody about me, and I dare say you
think that I am not grateful. But you don't know everything, my dear, you don't
know everything. Now you get me my tea, and then you can go and dress for your
party. Ah, what a thing it is to be young! I was young myself once, and I have
not yet forgotten it."</p>
<p>It was quite a long effort for Langley, with the words dragging slowly and
painfully enough, until he seemed to fall back in his chair, utterly exhausted.
Patricia turned away with the tears rising in her eyes, for there was something
in the pathos of it that moved her strangely. It seemed sad that her father
should speak of himself as an old man, considering that he had barely passed
his forty-fifth birthday. There were times, it seemed to Pat, when he was
getting better, and she had visions of him restored once more to health and
strength, and battling with the world in an endeavour to repair his battered
fortunes. Sometimes Pat hugged this delusion for a week at a time, until there
came the inevitable relapse, when Owen Langley was worse than ever.</p>
<p>But she put these thoughts out of her mind now, and bustled cheerfully about
the little room, preparing the tea. From time to time Langley looked at her
with strangely understanding eyes, and the ghost of a smile playing about his
lips. And she was very good to look at, with that brilliant dark beauty of
hers, and the healthy glow on a face tinged like old ivory. It was as if the
invalid were deriving comfort from some beautiful picture.</p>
<p>The meal was finished at length and tidied away, and a few minutes later
Croot entered the room. He crossed the floor with that firm confident step of
his, and a smile on his resolute lips. If he detected anything like austerity
in Langley's glance, he did not show it as he held out his hand.</p>
<p>"I can't," Langley said querulously. "This is one of my very bad days. I
can't lift my hand."</p>
<p>Croot smiled again, but Pat flushed a little guiltily. She knew things were
not quite as bad as her father said, and in the light of what he had just told
her she was feeling really uncomfortable. But Croot was absolutely at his
ease.</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite understand," he said. "Don't you move on my account. I thought
I would just run in and see how you were to-day. Do you remember what I was
telling you the last time I was here? About that piece of land at the corner of
Martin Lane? If you can't, don't worry."</p>
<p>"I remember," Langley said slowly. "It was the land we could not sell. It
didn't rightly belong to me."</p>
<p>"That's right," Croot said encouragingly. "We thought it didn't belong to
you, and we couldn't trace the title. And now, in dealing with the other land
that once belonged to Martin himself, my lawyers have found something out. And
if I am not greatly mistaken, we shall be able to convince any prospective
purchaser that we are the rightful owners. No trouble about selling it either.
What I mean is that with any luck I ought to be able to get you something like
a thousand pounds for that plot of ground."</p>
<p>"Is that really so, Mr. Croot," Pat exclaimed. "What a godsend it would be.
I hope you didn't have much trouble over it. You are a real good friend to
us."</p>
<p>"Well, it was a bit complicated," Croot smiled cheerfully. "You know, Miss
Pat, that when I get my teeth into a thing I don't often let go. There was
something queer behind the business, but when the other people saw I was going
to put my foot down, they were only too glad to come to terms. Oh, it's no
trouble where the interests of my old friends are concerned. But I will try and
make your father understand. Now, you run upstairs and dress, and we will walk
up to the house together."</p>
<p>Croot, already in evening dress himself, smiled down in his blandest manner
upon the grateful Pat. He seemed to be the very essence and embodiment of
genial prosperity as he stood there, big and important, with his back to the
fire. With a grateful word or two upon her lips Pat disappeared.</p>
<p>"I hope you can follow all I have been saying, Langley," Croot went on. "In
investigating one set of deeds we came upon one from another set which had
found its way into the parcel by accident. And that missing document is your
title to the property in Martin's Lane. A sort of missing link, if you gather
what I mean. Anyway, it's likely to be a lucky find, as far as you are
concerned, and, unless I am greatly mistaken, you will be quite a thousand
pounds better off in the course of a week or two. What are you going to do with
it?"</p>
<p>"Keep it," Langley said with a burst of sudden energy. "Lock it up, hide it
under my bed. No more investments for me. I wish to Heaven I had never heard
the word mentioned."</p>
<p>He dropped back into his chair again, like the mere rag of a man, nor did he
speak until Pat appeared. There was a smile on her lips, and a tinge of colour
in her cheek as she stood there in her simple evening frock which she had made
herself, but looking, as she always did, the essence of daintiness and
refinement and good breeding. Even Langley smiled gently.</p>
<p>"I am quite ready for you, Mr. Croot," she said. "I shan't be very late,
dad, and I will come into your room when I get back and make you comfortable for
the night."</p>
<p>"We must be getting on," Croot said. "Nearly half-past seven already. Well,
good night, Langley."</p>
<p>He passed out of the room with Pat by his side, and closed the door behind
him. Then, as their footsteps died away, Langley sat up, alert and vigorous
and, raising himself in his chair, stood on the hearthrug with his back to the
fire.</p>
<p>"The damned swine," he muttered. "The smug oily scoundrel. Ah, well, I've
waited a long time now, but my time is coming, and when it does, look to
yourself, Mortimer Croot. Because you need not expect to get any sort of mercy
from me."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE UNEXPECTED GUEST</h2>
<p>It was mere sentiment on Pat's part, of course, but she never entered the
Moat House without a certain feeling of regret, and perhaps another feeling
which was akin to jealousy. Neither had she ever quite forgiven Croot for
depriving her, more or less, of the home in which she had been born. Generally
she was quite ready to admit the illogical position, but that did not check the
pangs she was feeling as she crossed the big cosy panelled hall in the
direction of the long drawing-room, where Vera Croot awaited her. Nothing had
been changed, the old furniture was there, just as it had been any time the
last three centuries, and but for the absence of the family portraits, the old
impression remained intact. But it was only for a moment, and then Pat was
herself again.</p>
<p>Before the big open grate, with its fire of logs, a figure was seated, a
slender figure in white, with fair hair and a pair of engaging blue eyes. Vera
was a pocket Venus in her way, very small and fragile, and yet not lacking
sufficiency of courage, and an ardent sportswoman. For she was proficient at
most games, though she hardly looked it as she sat there in perfect harmony
with her surroundings, a study in lace and shimmering pearls.</p>
<p>"I am so glad you came first, Pat," she smiled. "I wanted to have two or
three minutes with you before the rest of them came along. It is quite a big
party to-night, including a distinguished scientist called Phillipson, and a
member of the Government. To tell you the truth, I shall be glad when it is
over."</p>
<p>They sat there chatting for a while, until the last of the guests had
arrived, then the big folding doors of the drawing-room were thrown back and
dinner was announced. They filed into the dining-room that Pat remembered so
well, and sat, twelve of them in all, round a big oval table, on which were
shaded lights and some magnificent orchids which had been in the conservatories
under the old r&eacute;gime. It seemed to Pat that she could recognize every
bloom. It was rather a depressing business for a moment or two, but there was
consolation in the fact that Vera's taste was faultless. There was no jarring
note here, and Pat, unfolding her napkin, resolutely set herself to pass an
enjoyable evening.</p>
<p>Most of the people round the table were quite well known to her, and fully
appreciated the situation. The one outstanding stranger was tall, with a high
forehead and a short grey beard, a distinguished-looking man, who had been
pointed out to Pat a few minutes before as Dr. Phillipson, the eminent
scientist. He was talking now in a grave voice to his partner. Pat could not
quite follow what they were saying, but from an odd word here and there she
gathered that the subject was electric energy. Then she realized the fact that
Croot was speaking to her.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," she said. "What were you saying, Mr. Croot? I am afraid
I was not listening."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't matter," Croot said. "Go on enjoying yourself. Don't
mind me. I like to have young faces round my table, keeps us young, eh,
general?"</p>
<p>"I don't admit that I am anything else," General Emerson replied. "A man is
as young as he feels, eh, Croot? And if that is true, then you've nothing to
worry about."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not," Croot said. "Nothing like an outdoor life to keep one
really fit. I don't get much of it now, unfortunately, but the twenty years I
spent in Canada weren't wasted."</p>
<p>Pat sat listening idly to this conversation, until her partner Geoffrey Rust
claimed her attention.</p>
<p>"Do you know," he said, "this is the first time that I have met you here on
a state occasion. It must feel very strange to you to be sitting here where you
have sat hundreds of times before and realize that this was once your own
home."</p>
<p>Pat glanced at him with eyes suspiciously moist.</p>
<p>"I am trying to forget it," she said simply.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord, I beg your pardon," Rust said under his breath. "If you can think
of a more tactless remark than that, perhaps you will tell me. I am sorry,
Pat."</p>
<p>"Please don't," Pat said. "After all, it is only a silly sentiment, and who
knows but what I might be back here again some day in the same place where Vera
is sitting now."</p>
<p>"Is that one of your pet dreams, then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. Girls are silly creatures sometimes, and yet, stranger
things have happened."</p>
<p>"That's true enough," Rust agreed. "Well, we must see what we can do.
Fortunately, there are not many dreams of that sort that I could not gratify if
you gave me the right, Pat, though I must confess that this one seems rather
remote. But you never can tell, and perhaps, some day&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Please don't," Pat said. "It is rather a sore subject."</p>
<p>"Very well, we will say no more about it. Still, Croot may not live for
ever, though he does look most confoundedly healthy. I suppose it wouldn't do
for me to poison him secretly and spend some of my father's hard-earned
thousands in buying the Moat House after the funeral? Of course, I know I am
talking rubbish, but I want to see that smile of yours back in your eyes,
Pat."</p>
<p>Patricia smiled gaily enough now, a little grateful perhaps to Rust for the
frivolous note that he had introduced into the conversation. The elaborate meal
went, on, with its many courses, and the soft-footed servants moving about in
the shadows behind the pools of light cast on the table from the lamps. Most of
the guests were laughing and talking easily enough now, and it would have been
hard to believe that there was anything but happiness and gaiety concealed
below the surface. And yet Rust, regarding his host from time to time, seemed
to feel a sort of impression that the big man was not entirely at his ease.
Perhaps Pat noticed it too, for they exchanged glances. At the same moment, as
if there were some magnetic attraction between the three of them, Croot glanced
across the table and smiled none too easily. There was a contraction between
his brows suggestive of some physical pain.</p>
<p>"What on earth's the matter with him?" Rust murmured.</p>
<p>"Probably he has got one of his neuralgic touches," Pat replied. "When he
was in Canada, years ago, he was lost for two days in a snowstorm, and was
badly frost-bitten. He was telling me about it the other day in the office. He
made light of it, but I know he suffers a good deal at times. Not for long, of
course, but I believe it is severe while it lasts."</p>
<p>"What are you two conspiring about?" Croot asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, that is our secret," Rust replied. "We are not in the office now, sir.
We are freeborn citizens, claiming the right to do as we please; in fact, we
are democrats, both."</p>
<p>Croot made some facetious reply, and turned easily to his neighbour. It was
all over in a moment, but it left a strange uneasy impression in Rust's mind.
The dinner came to an end at length, the servants had departed, and the coffee
and liqueurs were placed on the table. Cigarettes were handed round, so that it
was exceedingly pleasant to lounge there round that perfectly-appointed table
with its artistic litter of fruit and the wines glowing like gems in the
cut-glass decanters, and listen to the rain dropping on the terrace outside,
and the rising wind tossing and moaning in the trees.</p>
<p>"I tell you what it is, general," Croot was saying. "It is all very well for
you to take that view, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What's that?" Vera cried suddenly.</p>
<p>From outside there came a gentle tapping, not regularly, but a soft
vibration on the window-panes, that stopped and then commenced again. It was as
if some one outside in the rain was trying to call attention to his
presence.</p>
<p>"Ah, I know what it is," Croot said. "It's a loose Virginia creeper blowing
about in the wind. I have told Edwards more than once to have it tied up again.
You might remind him about it to-morrow morning, Vera. I&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly, with an expression of pain on his face. The man next to
him half rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"All right," he whispered. "Quite all right. Another twinge of that infernal
neuralgia of mine. Please don't take any notice of me. It will pass in a
minute."</p>
<p>He bent his head over his dessert-plate, and tinkled on the edge of it with
a silver fruit-knife. Then, once again, there came the tapping of the branch on
the window quickly, and then slowly, and finally it stopped altogether. A
minute later Croot ceased to fiddle with his dessert-knife, and the contracted
frown between his brows passed and left him smiling.</p>
<p>"That's all right," he said, with a sigh of deep relief. "It is a pretty
rotten business while it lasts, but fortunately for me it does not last very
long. Here, what are you doing, general? I positively can't allow you to smoke
one of your own cigars under my roof. You must have one of mine. If you will
excuse me for a moment or two, I will get a box from the library. I have only
smoked one myself, but they are quite the choicest I have ever been fortunate
enough to get hold of. They were sent me by our agent in Havana. You must try
one."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," the general laughed. "It must be a nice thing to be a
merchant prince and have agents in Havana. But please don't take all that
trouble."</p>
<p>Croot smilingly rose to his feet and left the room. Once he had closed the
door behind him the smile left his face, and a hard fighting expression came
into his eyes. He looked along the corridor to see that the coast was clear,
then moved swiftly along in the direction of the library. As he passed into the
room he locked the door behind him and, feeling his way in the dark, found one
of the windows at length, and pulling the blind on one side forced back the
catch and opened the long French casement. He cracked his finger-joints and
stood waiting.</p>
<p>Out of the gloom and rain a figure emerged and crept cautiously into the
room. The window was fastened again, the blind dropped over it, and a flood of
light disclosed the white anxious face of Mark Gilmour. He sat for a moment,
panting like a man who had run far. He was shaking from head to foot.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Croot whispered. "Tell me in a few words. I can't stay with
you more than a minute."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that," Gilmour muttered. "I have been spotted. I had the nearest
squeak in the world of finding myself in the hands of the police. I came down
here in George's taxi as fast as I could. It's lucky that we were prepared for
an emergency of this sort. The police will be after me presently&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Police?" gasped Croot. "Is it as bad as that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, damn it, man, didn't I tell you I had been spotted? An infernal piece
of bad luck. Man on a barge I had served with on the China station. I believe
he recognized me. At any rate, I am taking no risks. The boat is at the bottom
of the river, but Joe Airey and myself managed to get away all right. If they
do come along presently, then I have been here all the evening."</p>
<p>Croot was the man of action again now. He knew exactly what to do, and the
precise way of doing it.</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "Leave it to me. Nothing like an alibi. Listen. You
have been here for the last hour or more. You got down too late for dinner, so
you walked straight into the house and into the library with the intention of
joining us later, when we got back into the drawing-room. You will find all you
want in my dressing-room. You know what I mean. Now then, go upstairs and
change at once. No occasion for you to ring the bell, or anything of that sort,
because everything is up there. You know the way, don't you?"</p>
<p>As Croot spoke he indicated a small door in the side of the library which
opened on to a passage, at the foot of which was a staircase, leading to the
upper floor, where Croot had his bed and dressing-room. He frequently sat half
the night working in his library, and this arrangement suited him perfectly. It
meant no disturbance of the other people in the house late at night, and,
moreover, enabled him to be elsewhere at all sorts of sinister hours when Vera
and the rest were under the impression that he was asleep. Croot was not the
man to leave anything to chance.</p>
<p>"I think that will do," he said. "When I get back to the dining-room I will
mention casually that you are here, and that you did not like to disturb us in
the middle of our meal. I heard your message all right, I told them it was the
branch of a creeper tapping on the window. Did you catch my reply?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I got that right enough," Gilmour muttered. "If I hadn't, I shouldn't
have been waiting by the window here. Of course, it may be all a false alarm,
but I am not taking any risks."</p>
<p>"Of course not," Croot agreed. "Now, perhaps you will go. But stop, lock the
library door behind me in case of accidents, and unlock the door again when you
come down. You look half-frozen. You'll find a fire in my dressing-room."</p>
<p>"I can do with it," Gilmour said. "I will tell you all about it later on
when your friends have gone."</p>
<p>With that he disappeared through the small doorway, and Croot lingered till
he heard footsteps overhead, then, hastily snatching a box of cigars from the
cabinet, he went back to the dining-room.</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you so long," he said. "But when I got to the library I found
my man Gilmour there. It appears he got down here too late for dinner, so he
wouldn't disturb us, and walked into the library. He will join us in the
drawing-room presently."</p>
<p>"What a funny man he is, dad," Vera said. "It seems strange that a man who
has been all those years in the Navy should be so shy. He might have come in
and had dessert with us."</p>
<p>"He's a fine fellow, all the same," Croot said heartily. "Here you are,
general, and I hope you will enjoy it."</p>
<p>They sat there for some little time longer, perhaps half an hour or more,
whilst the general smoked his cigar&mdash;for which he had nothing but
praise&mdash;and then, at a sign from Croot, Vera rose and, followed by the
rest of the ladies, made her way across the hall into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>"Just another glass of port," Croot said. "Then we will follow. Rust, you
might go as far as the library and ask Gilmour if he won't come and join us in
a glass of wine. His devotion to duty has cost him a good dinner, but that is
no reason why he should be penalised over his port."</p>
<p>"Certainly I will," Rust said.</p>
<p>He rose and left the room, and as he did so a footman came in with a
visiting card on a salver. </p>
<p>"A gentleman wishes to see you on important
business, sir," he said. "He won't keep you many minutes."</p>
<p>"Ask him into the library," Croot said quite coolly.</p>
<p>He made no comment, he did not change his expression by so much as the blink
of an eyelid. And yet there was something ominous and dangerous about the
shining pasteboard lying on the table. It bore the simple inscription
of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>INSPECTOR RICHARD LOCK,<br>
NEW SCOTLAND YARD.</blockquote>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;LOCK IS PUZZLED</h2>
<p>Rust walked into the library, the lights of which were turned on now, and
found Gilmour seated there smoking a cigarette, and more or less busy over what
appeared to be a mass of accounts which lay on the big leather-bound table
before him. There was no great friendship between the two men, though they were
both in the same office, for Gilmour regarded Rust as a mere amateur and
dilettante whose presence in Great Bower Street was a mere episode, and from
Rust's point of view Gilmour was a money-making machine whose horizon was
bounded by commercial opportunism. But they were guests under the same roof
now, and it behoved Rust to be polite.</p>
<p>Still, Gilmour showed a very presentable appearance as he sat there in his
immaculate evening dress, neat and well-groomed, as if he had just turned out
of his chambers on his way to dine somewhere. He would have passed anywhere
from the sleek well-brushed head to the patent leather pumps on his feet. He
was warm and comfortable now, and it was almost impossible to connect him with
the shivering hunted creature who had crept breathlessly into the library not
more than half an hour ago.</p>
<p>"Hullo, Gilmour," Rust cried, "still hard at it. Scorning delights and
leading laborious nights, as the poet would have said had he only thought of
it. Never saw such a chap to work since my old father died. You missed a
clinking good dinner, anyway."</p>
<p>"Somebody must work," Gilmour replied with the thin ghost of a sneer on his
lips. "We can't all be mere probationers like you. Fact is, I was detained at
the last moment and got here after you had all gone in to dinner. I got here by
the train that reaches Cray at 8.30, and walked on with my pumps in my pocket
like any other clerk enjoying his employer's bounty. So whilst you were dining
I thought I would do a little work. Don't let me keep you from the feast of
reason and the flow of soul, Rust. Such fleeting joys were over for me years
ago."</p>
<p>"You talk like an old man," Rust retorted. "As a matter of fact, I came here
to fetch you. The ladies have retired to the drawing-room, and the old port is
on the festive board. Croot won't be happy till you come and sample it."</p>
<p>"You put it so nicely that I should be churlish to refuse," Gilmour said.
"Lead the way, will you."</p>
<p>As Gilmour rose the door of the library opened and a footman entered,
followed by a stranger who carried a hard felt hat in his hand. He was rather
tall and powerful-looking, with a pair of keen black eyes, and his heavy chin
was only partially concealed by the beard that covered it. He shot a glance at
Rust and his companion, and the former had a queer feeling that the man with
the beard was committing his features to memory. Gilmour did not seem to notice
the stranger at all, or if he did assumed not to do so, for he strolled
leisurely in the direction of the hall with a blank vacuousness on his face.
But the hand that held the cigarette he was smoking was none too steady, if
Rust had only been looking.</p>
<p>"Looks like a policeman," he laughed. "Come to arrest Croot on a charge of
forgery, no doubt. The old story of the City man who is leading the double
life, quite after the manner of the best detective stories. You are in it too,
probably."</p>
<p>"Do you expect me to confess?" Gilmour asked with what was a poor attempt at
gaiety. He was the type of man who always joked with a truculent air. "I should
prefer to fight it out, Rust."</p>
<p>Geoffrey was quite sure of it. One glance at the thrust-out jaw and hard
combative eyes of the other was sufficient to show that much. In a vague sort
of way he wondered why it was that Gilmour always appeared to be living on the
defensive. Was there something in his past that he was eager to conceal?</p>
<p>In the dining-room an eager and attentive group had gathered around
Professor Phillipson, who was talking learnedly on the subject of crime. He was
more or less attached to the Home Office in a capacity of adviser in certain
matters, and apparently Croot was drawing him out. He stood, a commanding
figure, with his back to the big carved fire-place, and somebody had turned on
the pair of electric brackets on either side of the great carved grate.</p>
<p>"With all due deference, Mr. Croot," he was saying as Rust and his companion
entered the room, "with all respect I submit that the limits of criminal
ingenuity are not yet plumbed. As an example, take the latest form of
burglar-proof safes and strong rooms so called. No sooner is one of these
placed on the market than the trained thief comes along and demonstrates its
futility. It is precisely the story of armour plate and the new projectile that
can pierce it over again. Your modern super-criminal is no mere ruffian who
resorts to force and violence, but a man of education, highly skilled and
trained in the ways of his craft. He is the member of an established
profession. Some of them have had public school and university educations. I
once knew a man who served a seven years' apprenticeship to lithography and
engraving in order to qualify as a bank-note forger. He made quite a fortune,
and died in the odour of sanctity, so to speak. He was never convicted."</p>
<p>"Quite a new opening for our boys," Croot laughed. "Forgery and murder as a
fine art. The quiet putting away of stubborn octogenarians who obstinately
stand in the way of the waiting generation and all that sort of thing. But
happily medical science is too advanced to permit of that, at any rate."</p>
<p>"So the world of optimists imagine," the professor said dryly, "but it is
not so. To begin with, there are many poisons known to science that leave no
sort of trace behind, but happily these are seldom within the reach of the
homicidal criminal. Still, there are other ways. I have one of them under my
observation at the present moment, a very cold-blooded affair."</p>
<p>"This is confoundedly interesting," the general said. "Do you mean an
attempted murder?"</p>
<p>"No, I am alluding to an accomplished fact," the professor replied grimly.
"A conspiracy to get a troublesome person out of the way. A man is picked up
dead miles away from his own house. He has apparently been in the&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker stopped abruptly and bit his lip. He was like a man who has been
talking to himself and suddenly wakes to realize when almost too late that he
is the centre of a curious audience.</p>
<p>"Pardon me, gentlemen," he muttered, "but my professional zeal carries me
too far. I had forgotten for the moment that the matter in question is at
present entirely between me and the Home Office. I am afraid that I cannot tell
you any more."</p>
<p>The professor puffed at his cigar again, and an awkward silence followed.
Rust took up the thread.</p>
<p>"Haven't you forgotten something also, sir?" he asked, turning to Croot. "I
mean your visitor in the library."</p>
<p>"Bless my soul, so I have," Croot cried. "Please excuse me, I will be back
in a few minutes. If I am detained by some troublesome business, please join
the ladies."</p>
<p>With this Croot strolled off leisurely in the direction of the library as if
he had no single care in the world. There was a genial smile on his face as he
confronted Inspector Lock and offered a gold cigarette case to the
intruder.</p>
<p>"Not just at present, sir, if you don't mind," Lock said. "I have to
apologize for coming here at this time of night, especially as I understand
that you have friends to dinner."</p>
<p>"My daughter's birthday," Croot explained casually. "Quite an informal
affair with nobody but old friends present. I assure you that I am quite at
your service, Mr. Lock."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, it is like this," Lock proceeded. "As a general merchant
yourself you must be aware that there has been quite a wholesale amount of
plundering going on in connexion with the overseas carrying trade. Thousands of
pounds' worth of goods are stolen every night from barges and lighters on the
river. The river-police are at their wits' ends to cope with the trouble. The
general direction of the new scheme has been placed in my hands."</p>
<p>"I am exceedingly glad to hear it," Croot said heartily. "It is high time
that something was done. As a dealer in practically everything that comes from
overseas I have been a great sufferer from these depredations. But no doubt you
have heard that. I have complained often enough. Not that I lose much from the
mere L.S.D. point of view, because I'm always heavily insured. But the
insurance rates are getting alarmingly high, and there is the worry of not
being able to make delivery. If you really have got on the track of these
clever scoundrels I shall be delighted. I am quite convinced of the fact that
they are not ordinary thieves. Their intelligence department is marvellous, and
they go unerringly to the most valuable plunder and, what is more, know exactly
where to find it. But perhaps you have discovered&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I think I have, sir," Lock interrupted. "I believe that the man who has
worked the whole plan of campaign and who is in a position to supply almost
priceless information is a man in your own employ, and but for a bit of bad
luck we should have captured him red-handed an hour or two ago."</p>
<p>Croot jumped from his chair, and his cigar fell to the floor.</p>
<p>"God bless my soul," he cried. "Mr. Lock, you are not seriously asking me to
believe that. Why, most of my people have been with me for years. Absolutely
trustworthy."</p>
<p>"What about Mr. Gilmour, sir?" Lock asked.</p>
<p>Lock launched his bomb quietly enough, but there was no mistaking the
gravity of his manner. It was almost as if he were making an accusation against
Croot himself. The latter threw back his head and laughed as if something had
amused him heartily.</p>
<p>"My <i>dear</i> sir," he said. "This is really funny. My manager and
confidential second-in-command. Why, if Gilmour wanted money by the thousand at
a time he has only to help himself to mine, and I should never find out. I am
taking it very easy these times, and he has the control of everything. Besides,
he knows that before long the business will be his. And Gilmour is no
fool."</p>
<p>"He has been with you a long time?" Lock asked unmoved.</p>
<p>"Five years on this side, and more than that in Canada, where I came from to
take over from Verity's when they retired, or rather the business retired from
them. As a matter of fact, Gilmour was born somewhere in America, the
Argentine, I believe, and he is the best servant I ever had. But stop a minute.
You recognized him about a couple of hours ago on the Thames engaged in some
underhand work and recognized him for my manager?"</p>
<p>"I didn't, Mr. Croot, but a man called Avory who was on the barge which was
being raided did. He told me after the raid failed and the thieves got away
that he recognized Gilmour as a man who was once in the Navy, and who had been
in some sort of command in the ship where Avory was boatswain's mate. I was
fortunate enough to find out where Gilmour is lodging, and went there to look
for him, and was informed that he was dining out to-night."</p>
<p>"And so you came down to Cray to warn me and perhaps find out if my man was
really dining from home as he gave his landlady to believe. He is in the house
at the present moment. He was detained at the office too late to get here in
time for the early stages of the meal, but he arrived by the train that reaches
Cray from Charing Cross at 8.30, and is now in the dining-room."</p>
<p>Croot dropped all this out quite casually and without the slightest
suggestion of triumph. It was much as if he were humouring some persistent
child. He could see that Lock had lost a deal of his confidence, and that for
the first time he seemed not so sure of his ground. But he was not yet entirely
convinced.</p>
<p>"Don't you think you have made a mistake?" Croot insinuated.</p>
<p>"Very possibly, sir," Lock admitted cautiously. "But after having said so
much I should like to make your mind quite easy on the matter. You see what I
mean, sir?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite see what you mean," Croot laughed. "Your feelings do you
credit. But let me assure you that so far as anything you have said goes I am
quite easy in my mind. In the circumstances the best thing to do is to see Mr.
Gilmour and examine him for yourself. Tell him frankly what this man Avory
said, and give him the chance to clear himself in such a way as to avoid any
sort of gossip or scandal. You will find him very reasonable."</p>
<p>"That would perhaps be the best way," Lock agreed. "Of course, Avory might
have been led away by a chance likeness, and if that is so, why then we need
say no more."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, but I don't think that Mr. Gilmour will be inclined to let the
thing drop quite so casually as that," Croot interrupted. "He ought, at any
rate, to have the chance of hearing what you have just told me. I'll ring for
him if you don't mind."</p>
<p>Gilmour came a minute or two later, cool and self-possessed and entirely
devoid of his usual aggressive assertiveness. He seemed quite at home there,
and easy in his beautifully-cut clothes.</p>
<p>"I think you sent for me, sir," he murmured with no more than a casual
glance at Lock. "May I ask what&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I think it is up to you to explain, inspector," Croot said.</p>
<p>Lock repeated his story again in tabloid form, whilst Gilmour listened with
a smile on his face. He conveyed the impression of a child listening to some
boring lecture from some despised master. Then he laughed quite
good-naturedly.</p>
<p>"Quite amusing," he said. "So this faithful watchdog on board the barge
claims to have recognized me for somebody who was once his superior officer in
His Majesty's Navy. Incidentally, I may say that I never was in any navy. For
all practical purposes I am a man without a country, being the son of an
Englishman born in Los Angeles who married a Canadian woman. I spent most of my
life in Canada, where Mr. Croot met me. Did this&mdash;er&mdash;Avory tell you
what was my other alias when in the service?"</p>
<p>"I don't think he did," Lock admitted. "But you have quite convinced me that
he has made a mistake. No doubt he has seen you in Great Bower Street and
confused you with somebody he knew years ago. The mere fact that you were
dining here&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But I wasn't," Gilmour carefully corrected. "I changed at the office and
came on later, being detained at work till too late to reach here in time for
the dinner. I arrived by the train from Charing Cross that reaches Cray at
8.30. I presume you found out my address and saw my housekeeper&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I got your address and the number of your flat from the telephone directory,"
Lock explained. "Avory gave me your name as Gilmour employed by Mr. Croot. He
said he had known that you were in business in Great Bower Street for some
time. It was your housekeeper who thought you might be down here."</p>
<p>Gilmour smiled to himself. He could see quite plainly how the officer had
laid his trap to catch him.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," he said. "These chance likenesses are frequently the cause of
trouble. But finally to dispel any further doubt in the matter, look at
this."</p>
<p>From his waistcoat pocket Gilmour produced a slip of blue cardboard which he
handed to Lock. It was a half of a first-class return ticket between Charing
Cross and Cray, taken out that day.</p>
<p>"There you are," he said. "My ticket purchased at the booking office about
7.45 this evening by myself. The first half you can no doubt inspect at Cray
station. And perhaps after that you may regard the alibi as proved, Mr.
Lock."</p>
<p>"Quite," Lock said shortly. "There is obviously a mistake somewhere. I am
sorry to trouble you, but I had to make inquiries. I wish you good night,
gentlemen."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;FOUND DROWNED</h2>
<p>Though Jack Ellis would have smiled at any friend who called him a business
man, he was quite thorough in his methods, and, once he had set his mind upon a
thing, had the true bulldog grip. Whilst waiting for his chance at the Bar he
had taken up journalism with all the cheery enthusiasm of his nature and,
having some gift of expression and a natural nose for the essentials, had been
more than successful from the start. He belonged naturally to the gregarious
type of animal, and crowds, especially plebeian crowds, appealed to him
irresistibly. So in search of "copy" he had gravitated to the East End, and
when he had read of those impudent depredations along Thames-side he had
started to investigate.</p>
<p>Luck had helped him from the first. He was utterly fearless; he had a fine
knowledge of what was once called "the noble art of self-defence"; he was quite
at home wherever a boat was to be found, and before many weeks had elapsed he
knew as much about the lower reaches of the Thames as many a waterman who had
spent all his life there. Before long his river-side sketches were quite a
feature in the <i>Daily Telephone,</i> and after he had been of service to the
river police on a certain memorable occasion he had enjoyed the confidence of
the authorities, and a launch had been placed at his disposal by the pleased
proprietors of his own paper.</p>
<p>He was doing good work for that enterprising journal, beyond the shadow of a
doubt. To further his investigations he took rooms in the neighbourhood of
Wapping, and mixed freely with the people who frequented the public houses and
drinking shops there, often enough in disguise, and by this means and a
judicious outlay in the way of liquid refreshments made friends in the best
local quarters. It was in this way that he came in contact with the man called
Bill Avory, an old naval man now engaged as a minder of barges.</p>
<p>Early on the afternoon of the day of the birthday dinner Ellis and the man
Avory were seated in the bar parlour of the <i>Green Bay,</i> which was
situated in a slum off Wapping High Street, peacefully engaged in drinking
beer. In his thick pilot clothes and sea boots and with a short clay pipe in
his mouth Ellis looked quite as disreputable and undesirable as his companion.
But he had the satisfaction of knowing that he was not wasting his time.</p>
<p>"It's me and old Joe on the <i>Stella</i> to-night, guv'nor," Avory was
saying. "We're taking a load o' stuff from the steamer <i>Mark Henry</i> above
the Tower Bridge, an' we're a-watchin' of it to-night till the consignees can
take it off in the mornin'. Machinery, it is, in packing-cases small an' 'andy
for them chaps as is allus on the look-out for the right stuff. Motor parts
mostly, I'm told. An' 'ere's wishin' I were well out of it. Wi' valuable stuff
like that 'ere about, two on us ain't enough on the barge. If as 'ow you're out
in your boat tonight you might give us a look-up, guv'nor."</p>
<p>"I'll do that with pleasure, Bill," Ellis replied. "So you think that the
stuff is marked."</p>
<p>"Aye, I do that. You pipe that bloke over there with the red beard. Ah, 'e
could tell yer somethin' if he'd a mind. Never done a day's work in 'is life,
an' yet 'e's got a week-end cottage at 'Earn Bay, bless yer. Ony 'e don't think
as anyone knows it."</p>
<p>Ellis glanced under his brows at the man with the red beard. He was drinking
with half a dozen other men of a like kidney, and evidently carried weight with
them. The bar was full of loafers and sodden-looking derelicts, all of them
obviously work shy. The whole place reeked of stale beer and the sweet warm
odour of gin. Outside in the dull leaden atmosphere of the lane the neglected
child-life of the place played and fought and wept in the unsavoury gutters.
But Ellis did not notice it.</p>
<p>"He doesn't look like a millionaire, Bill," Ellis smiled.</p>
<p>"An' 'e ain't, neither," Avory grinned. "Not but what 'e makes a goodish bit
all the same. This 'ere is a big thing, guv'nor. It's my belief as there's
'eavy money behind the game, found by them wot lives in the country and drives
their thousand-guinea moty-cars. Gents as drinks their wine regular and plays
that Scotch crokay as they calls it on Sunday. I 'ears things, mind you, and
I'll 'ave something good for you yet."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you were right, Bill," Ellis said as he knocked out
his pipe and strolled towards the door. "I shall be out in the boat to-night,
and will give you a look up."</p>
<p>It was after seven o'clock before Ellis got back from the West and ate his
simple supper in the dingy lodgings where he had elected to put up for the
present. Then in the driving rain and mist he went down to the wharf where his
motor-launch was moored, and a little later he was out on the bosom of the
river. Not that he had any particular object in view except the chance of some
adventure which might turn out useful from a journalistic point of view. It was
a thick black night with a fine rain falling, and something in the nature of a
fog hanging over the water. And so in the course of time Ellis drifted into the
vicinity of the barge called the <i>Stella,</i> on board of which was Bill
Avory and his mate. It would be just as well perhaps to give them a call and
see how they were getting on.</p>
<p>He ran the motor-boat under the counter of the barge, and as he did so his
nerves tightened up and his senses grew alert, for from the tiny cabin of the
barge came a clear cry for help. In a few seconds Ellis had scrambled on to the
deck. He shouted encouragement as if he were merely the advance guard of a
party, and as he made out his bearings two figures shot by him and dropped into
a boat on the far side of the barge and opposite to the quarter from whence he
himself had come. Before he could interfere the boat was pushed off and had
vanished into the fog. Out of the mists Ellis could see the faint outline of a
police launch.</p>
<p>"All right," he shouted, "I'm Ellis. I'll see what is wrong here&mdash;you
leg it after those chaps."</p>
<p>There came an answering cry, and Ellis dived into the cabin as Avory
scrambled to his feet and began to have some hazy idea as to what had happened
to himself.</p>
<p>"Mean to say that you are alone here?" Ellis asked.</p>
<p>"Looks like it, don't it?" Avory growled. "My mate went off to get some beer
an hour ago, and 'e ain't back yet. Some of the gang got 'old of 'im most
likely and nobbled 'im. But I tumbled to one of the rotten blighters
any'ow."</p>
<p>"You mean to say that you recognized one of the gang?"</p>
<p>"Aye, that I did, guv'nor. Two of 'em comes creepin' down 'ere an' drops on
the top of me before I knows as they are about. When I yells out an' I 'ears
your voice the first chap catches me a clip on the jaw that knocks me out, but
not afore I calls 'im by name an' I see as 'e pipes me. An' 'im a regular
toff."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed. Who might he be? Do I know him?"</p>
<p>"Very like. 'E's a sort of boss in one of the big offices in Great Bower
Street, manager 'e calls hisself to Verity &amp; Co. Name o' Gilmour they tells
me. But that worn't the name I knowed 'im by when I were in the Navy. I spotted
'im ages ago as an old enemy, but I didn't say nothink, because I allus believe
in letting bygones be bygones, and if the bloke likes to call hisself by
another name it don't concern me. But the bloke what copped me on the jaw is
the same as calls hisself Mr. Mark Gilmour."</p>
<p>Ellis sat there without comment, but seeing a deal of light in what hitherto
had been a very dark place to him. A score of little things began to assume
large proportions. But it was no part of his policy just then to say anything
about this to his companion. He would know what to do when the time came.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better hail the next police boat and send off to find your
mate," he suggested. "If the man has been got at it would be just as well to
find out."</p>
<p>A little later Avory was relieved by a police patrol, and Ellis was getting
Inspector Lock on the telephone.</p>
<p>Lock had quite a lot to say. A police patrol had very nearly caught the
raiders and was under the impression that they had sunk their boat. If that was
so, then the thieves must have been drowned, a solution that did not altogether
satisfy Ellis. He had a suggestion to make.</p>
<p>"They were probably prepared for that," he said. "If you don't mind, it
would be as well to find out at once where Gilmour is to be found. I know the
man personally; I have met him more than once at his employer's house at Cray,
and the more I see of him the less I like him. He may try to get to Cray
to-night to establish an alibi. If he isn't at his fiat, and his housekeeper
doesn't know where he is, wouldn't it be worth while to rush off to Mr. Croot's
house at Cray and make inquiries?"</p>
<p>"Not at all a bad suggestion," Lock replied. "If Mr. Croot is in this
business himself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But that's all nonsense, you know, Lock."</p>
<p>"Probably, but you never can tell. Anyhow, there are both brains and
unlimited money behind this business. I'll run down to Cray at once, and you
can come and see me in the morning."</p>
<p>But there was nothing very definite for Ellis when he called on Lock the
following day. He listened attentively to what the inspector had to say, and
was forced to agree with him that Bill Avory had made a mistake in the identity
of his man.</p>
<p>"He must have done," Lock said. "Gilmour was in the house when I got there
not so long after the affray, and he was in evening dress and quite calm and
collected. He was very frank as to his movements, and volunteered the
information that he had come there too late for dinner by the train reaching
Cray from Charing Cross at 8.30. He couldn't have got from the river in his wet
clothes and changed and bathed and got to Cray in full rig before my arrival
unless, of course, Croot was in the conspiracy. And that is a thing I am not
suggesting. But the big point in Gilmour's favour is that railway ticket. I
mean the return half of a first-class between Charing Cross and Cray. Only one
first-class ticket was issued at Charing Cross to Cray by that particular
train, and the outward half was duly delivered up at Cray, and, according to
the number, the inward half was in Gilmour's possession. We can't get over
that."</p>
<p>Jack Ellis was duly impressed by this statement. There was no getting away
from the simple facts that went to prove that Gilmour was not the man who had
raided the barge. And yet Bill Avory had been very positive in his statement.
Was it possible that Avory himself was playing a trick on him. Lock voiced this
suspicion in the next thing that he said.</p>
<p>"What do you know about this man Avory?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Well, not much," Jack confessed. "He has a daughter who is a housemaid at
the Moat House, Cray, which is Mr. Croot's place, as you know. I happened on
Avory one day when I was there, and he came to see the girl, and we began to
talk on the way to the station. We became more or less friendly after that. But
I will have another chat with Avory on the matter. He lives in lodgings not far
from my temporary slum in Wapping, and as he is generally engaged on night
work, I shall have plenty of chances. But I am afraid, after what you have
said, that he has made a big mistake."</p>
<p>"Looks like it," Lock agreed, "very much like it. Did Avory happen to
mention the name under which he had known, or believed he had known, this man
Gilmour?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think he did. If so, it escaped me in the excitement of the
moment. But I can easily find that out."</p>
<p>"I wish you would, not that it will make much difference. I am afraid that
we are on the wrong track this time, though I entirely agree with you that this
business is not the work of the usual gang of river thieves. It's too big to
begin with, and the scheme is too thorough. I can't see a common or garden
receiver of stolen goods financing this problem. To begin with, they never do
that on a big scale because the risks are too great. The master brain behind
this scheme is getting away with thousands. The stolen stuff is smuggled away
in some warehouse rented by somebody who has a reputation for high integrity,
and from thence shipped abroad again through some firm or firms of innocent
brokers who are handling the stuff in all good faith. And there is another
thing which is still more important from our point of view. You must have
noticed how these chaps invariably go for the really valuable cargoes. There is
no wild raid, picking up anything that comes along. Oh dear, no. Nothing but
the very best. In the office of some great outstanding firm of importers is a
confidential clerk who has the privilege of knowing most of the valuable
cargoes that come into the port of London, and how they are handled. This
information is conveyed by some underground channel to the actual marauders
themselves, and when the stuff is raided it is conveyed to some secret
hiding-place for re-shipment abroad. I feel quite certain I am right so
far."</p>
<p>"Then there are thieves on the other side of the water as well. A sort of
international bureau, so to speak?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. It is difficult to earmark goods, especially after they
have been repacked as these must be. I am afraid that you will have to wait a
long time yet, Mr. Ellis, before you can give your paper a scoop over the river
robberies. Anyhow, see Avory again, and try and get something more
definite."</p>
<p>There was no more to be said for the moment, and Jack Ellis went on his way
thoughtfully. For the moment at any rate his dream of a fine newspaper
sensation was exploded. It had seemed to him that he had Gilmour in the hollow
of his hand, and, moreover, everything had tallied with the theory he had
formed. He had always disliked Gilmour from the first, and a fine instinct had
told him that the latter was a dangerous rival so far as Vera Croot was
concerned. Not that there were any outward signs that Croot was disposed to
regard Gilmour as a prospective son-in-law, but from one or two little things
Jack deduced the worst. And, moreover, since he had allowed Croot to know what
his aspirations were, he had been quite courteously asked not to show his face
at the Moat House again.</p>
<p>Vera had seemed to concur in this drastic ultimatum, but she was not taking
it as quietly as her adopted father imagined; in fact, she was regarding
herself as something of a martyr. That she was in correspondence with Ellis,
Croot did not dream for a moment.</p>
<p>But there were other things to occupy Jack's attention for the moment. He
had his more or less regular work on the <i>Telephone,</i> for one thing, so
that he had no opportunity of seeing Bill Avory for the next day or two.
Meanwhile, he heard nothing from Lock, and he was forced to the conclusion that
he would have to look in other directions if he were to do anything big in the
way of unearthing the gang responsible for those amazing robberies on the
river. That they were still flourishing he could see by the daily papers.</p>
<p>Three days had elapsed before he found half an hour to spare, and dropped in
at Scotland Yard to have a few minutes' chat with Lock, who, fortunately, was
not busy at the time. He seemed rather grave and preoccupied as Ellis came in
and dropped into a chair.</p>
<p>"You are just the man I wanted to see," he said. "Did you look up the night
watchman Avory as you suggested?"</p>
<p>Ellis explained that he had not had the time. Lock looked more grave and
disappointed than ever.</p>
<p>"Then you will never know now what was the name of the man in the Navy whom
Avory took Gilmour for. Late last night Avory's body was found floating in one
of the ponds at Hampstead&mdash;drowned. There were no marks on the body, and
it looks like a case of suicide. His watch and his money were intact. Still,
it's a very sinister happening in the face of what we know. He has just been
identified by the woman with whom he lodged. What do you make of it?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;ARCADES AMBO</h2>
<p>"To quote the one and only George Robey, 'that's that.'" Croot smiled
knowingly as he saw the last of the discomfited Lock, and helped himself to
another cigarette. "Still, it was rather a near shave, and I hope such a thing
will not occur again."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a schoolmaster talking to an unruly boy," Gilmour laughed
unpleasantly. "Anyone would think you were blaming me for what happened. It's a
great game that we are after, and the profits are enormous, but the risks are
nearly as big. So long as your hide is safe, what have you to complain of?"</p>
<p>"I'm not thinking of myself altogether, Mark."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, but you are no philanthropist. You must admit that I was quite
ready for our friend Lock to-night."</p>
<p>"Oh, I give you full marks for that; at any rate he was all at sea and quite
satisfied that he was on the wrong track. That return ticket of yours was a
real brain wave. How on earth did you manage it? A real ticket, too."</p>
<p>"Of course it was a real ticket. A forgery would have been detected at once.
As I take practically all the risk and do all the dangerous work I naturally
cover my tracks as far as possible. Besides, I had a feeling that something was
going to happen this evening, Lord knows why. But I had. And it did. It was
real bad luck to barge slick into a man who knew me years ago when I was in the
Navy, and on my own ship, too. Bill Avory tumbled to me at once, though we have
not met for at least ten years. And, what's more, he has been aware for some
time that I have been engaged in the neighbourhood of Great Bower Street. Avory
was always a decent fellow, though he had nothing to thank me for, and probably
when he spotted me and realized that I was leading a presumedly decent life in
the city he kept his own counsel."</p>
<p>"Then he knew all about your little&mdash;er&mdash;trouble?"</p>
<p>"Of course he did. He was on the <i>Sharkstooth</i> at the time of my
arrest, and heard the result of the court-martial. Croot, we must get Avory out
of the way, or he may spoil the whole game."</p>
<p>Gilmour's voice dropped to a whisper, and the expression on his face was not
good to see. He was preaching the gospel of murder now, and Croot averted his
eyes. Hardened rascal as he was he shuddered, and his heart sank in his breast.
Gilmour seemed to sense what was passing in the mind of his confederate, for he
smiled contemptuously.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be the first time," he snarled, "and you need not pretend that
you don't know it. That old workshop of mine has done us many a good turn since
we started on the present stunt."</p>
<p>"You mean the place where you did your coining operations? I thought you had
given that up long ago. It was a poor game you were at there, and the risks
were great. When we joined forces you promised me that you would
not&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And I didn't," Gilmour interrupted. "But I kept the workshop on because I
still dabble in mechanical experiments, and the power that drives my plant
costs me nothing. The South Thames Electric Corporation will never find out
that I tapped their main cable to the extent of a 2,000-volt alternating
current. I am still using it for my electric furnace. But the coining business
is dead off. You showed me a better game than that. Why, we must have made over
&pound;100,000 during the last twelve months."</p>
<p>"Quite that," Croot chuckled. "It was a great day for me when I came back
from Canada and found a footing in the firm of Verity &amp; Co. They were
absolutely on their last legs and the &pound;5,000 I managed to scrape together
just paid their debts. Did I ever tell you how I first got on to the
business?"</p>
<p>"Not quite. Some man you met in Canada, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"That's right. The shady sort of chap who leaves his country for his
country's good. He was the son of an old trusted servant of Verity Brothers,
and knew from the father all about the secret passage under the offices, and
the history of Crombies Wharf. I learnt it quite by accident one night, and for
the time being thought no more about it. Then it came to me like an
inspiration. I could see a fortune in it for a man of courage who got hold of
the business and posed as a respectable merchant and broker in all sorts of
foreign produce. And it came off too. Then I found you and&mdash;well, I don't
think that I need say any more."</p>
<p>"Not for the present," Gilmour said meaningly.</p>
<p>Croot took up the challenge. There were times when he did not feel quite
easy with this lieutenant of his.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" he demanded. "Ain't you satisfied with your
share of the plunder?"</p>
<p>"So far as the mere money goes there is nothing to grumble at," Gilmour
admitted. "I am taking all the risks, and if I happen to be caught red-handed
then you get off on the plea that I am taking advantage of my position in your
office to play the rogue. That was the understanding, and I am not squeaking at
it. From the boodle point of view I have done very well and, given another
year, I shall be in a position to chuck it. Then I shall settle down to a
respectable life, and the little wife I have in my mind will never know
anything about my shady past. I suppose it never occurred to you that a man
like myself had dreams of a nice little place in the country with a golf links
handy and a wife and kids. Now with a girl, for instance, like your little
Vera&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You can drop that," Croot muttered with an ugly frown on his face. "You can
cut that out at once, Mark."</p>
<p>"Why?" Gilmour asked. "Why? If you are good enough to be her adopted father
I am good enough to be her real husband. And if she will have me, I am going to
be, and so I tell you straight. It isn't as if you were an honest man."</p>
<p>A look almost of horror crept into Croot's eyes. The man was not all
bad&mdash;probably there are few in the world who are&mdash;and in the darkness
and crookedness of his lurid life the one shining spot was his affection for
Vera. She had come to him at a time when all was blackness and despair, and
there apparently was only one way out of the shadows. The orphan child of one
of his unutterable associates, she had more or less adopted him, as children
will, and in some strange inconsequent way she had filled a void that Croot was
not even dimly aware of. In her presence he was another man; when the day's
work was done and the dishonest schemes were left behind and Croot reached home
in the evenings he could put all mean thoughts out of his crooked mind and life
for the moment in the sunshine and wholesomeness of the girl who represented so
much to him. And now here was his fellow rascal, his <i>fidus Achates</i> in
crime, coolly suggesting that he should surrender her happiness to
him&mdash;the man who had left the Navy with the brand of the thief on him, and
one who sooner or later must be recognized by an old shipmate. And indeed this
had happened in the case of Avory. Might it not happen again on some future
occasion when Vera was married to him, in circumstances that would entail a
full exposure of the truth? Such a thing would certainly break Vera's
heart.</p>
<p>"She wouldn't look at you," Croot said. "Even if I gave my consent she would
not have you. And if you think that I am going to put any pressure on the girl,
why&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not asking you to do anything of the sort," Gilmour replied. "I don't
want anything of the kind. I wouldn't have a wife on those terms if she came to
me with a million. When the time comes for me to settle down I want to
<i>know</i> that she is&mdash;But why go on? And I am perhaps conceited enough to
believe that Vera is not entirely indifferent. Her manner to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know all about that," Croot said impatiently. "The child is the same
to everybody. She thinks that all the world is good and kind, and that is what
has flattered your vanity. Did it ever occur to you that there might be another
Richmond in the field? In other words, what the novelists call a rival?"</p>
<p>The memory of Jack Ellis had just flashed into his mind. He had been curt
and hard enough with the man whom Geoffrey Rust had introduced into his
household, but on the principle that any stick is good enough to beat a dog
with, it seemed that the stick had come quite naturally to his hand now. He saw
Gilmour's startled look and the dogged thrust of his great under-jaw.</p>
<p>"You mean that you have other views?" Gilmour asked.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps I have, but I assure you that they are quite in the air so
far. But don't forget that when parents scheme for the future of their children
the young people are in the habit of making their own arrangements. This is an
age when the emancipated feminine demands a latch-key&mdash;and generally gets
it."</p>
<p>"Vera is not that sort of girl, Croot."</p>
<p>"There you and this deponent are in complete accord. But a woman's heart is
a most irresponsible thing, Gilmour. You have met a man called Ellis here more
than once, I think."</p>
<p>"A friend of Rust's, yes. Do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do. A briefless barrister earning a precarious living by his pen. But he
is a clean young fellow with a good record, and quite unmistakably a gentleman.
Good-looking too, far more so than you are, my boy. And these things count with
a girl. Moreover, Ellis will be very well off one of these days, and he came to
me quite openly and asked my permission to pay his addresses to Vera."</p>
<p>"And you ordered the fellow out of the house?" Gilmour said.</p>
<p>"Well, not quite like that. I gathered that Vera was rather interested; in
fact, she confessed as much. In the circumstances I refused to listen to
anything serious, and asked Ellis not to come again, and he hasn't. Vera agreed
to be guided by me for the moment, and there the thing stands. However, if you
think that you still have a chance, why, my dear fellow&mdash;"</p>
<p>There was a mocking smile on Croot's lips that brought the blood flaming
into Gilmour's cheek. The blow was utterly unexpected, and for the moment was a
knock-down one. Nor was it possible to believe that Croot was telling anything
but the truth.</p>
<p>"I never was more in earnest in my life," he said between his teeth. "And so
long as I have your encouragement I shall go on. I will only take my answer
from Vera herself. If Ellis likes to go on then perhaps I shall know how to
deal with him."</p>
<p>Despite his rather jaunty smile Croot was listening to all this with a deal
of uneasiness. He knew only too well what his confederate was capable of once
he was roused. Up to now the big plundering scheme had progressed smoothly
enough, and the great fortune was on the verge of maturing. But if love and
jealousy came along and took a hand, then goodness only knew what complications
might arise.</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake put it out of your mind," he said vigorously. "At any
rate postpone it for six months. You talk like the villain in a transpontine
melodrama. You can't murder Ellis and throw his body in the river. And you
can't get Avory out of the way in that fashion either. If you can't have Vera,
I will promise that the hated rival shall not ride off with her either."</p>
<p>There was something almost of entreaty in Croot's voice as he spoke. He was
not unconscious of the tension in the atmosphere, and the expression on
Gilmour's face rendered him uneasy. He had no sort of scruples of his own; he
would have shrunk from nothing in the way of cold-blooded fraud or dishonesty,
but personal violence was another thing altogether. He had seen that sort of
thing brooding in the eyes of men before, and it was plainly indited on
Gilmore's face now. And Croot was troubled in his mind.</p>
<p>Gilmour sat there with his mind travelling back over the past. He had known
Vera for some time now, and had been on the warmest of terms with her ever
since she had left school. They had played golf and tennis together, and he had
taught her all she knew of games, much as if they had been brother and sister.
But lately a subtle change had come over their relationship, a sort of reserve
on Vera's part, as if in some way she had divined exactly what was passing in
his mind. And now that Gilmour had told him all about Ellis, he could see
precisely where the trouble lay.</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "Don't you worry about me, I shall know what to do
when the time comes. But don't you think we had better get back to the
drawing-room? We must have been talking here for quite a quarter of an hour,
and your guests may think that there is something wrong. Besides, it is getting
late."</p>
<p>Croot rose with a certain sense of relief, and yet, at the same time, he was
conscious of a great deal more that he would have liked to say. As it was, he
made no protest, and followed Gilmour into the drawing-room where the others
were awaiting them.</p>
<p>"I must apologize for leaving you like this," he said. "But the fact is, I
have been detained on a piece of important business which indirectly concerns
my friend Gilmour. Oh, come, you are not going yet? Stay a little longer."</p>
<p>The general pointed to the clock.</p>
<p>"It's just on eleven," he said, "and I have come to the time of life when
one recognizes the wisdom of early hours. Can I give you a lift, professor? My
car passes the station, and I will drop you there if you like."</p>
<p>"I must fly," Patricia cried. "I had no idea it was so late. Good night,
Vera."</p>
<p>"Just wait a minute," Rust said. "I will see you as far as your cottage. I
have a car myself put up in the village. Can I drive you back to town,
Gilmour?"</p>
<p>"That is very good of you," Gilmour said. "But I am staying the night here.
I have still some business to discuss with Mr. Croot, and I want to get it off
my mind before I go to bed."</p>
<p>With that the party broke up, and a minute or two later Patricia found
herself walking down the avenue in the direction of the cottage, with Rust by
her side. He was silent for a time, then he burst out suddenly:</p>
<p>"I am going to ask you a question," he said. "I don't want you to betray any
confidences, but is there anything between our little Vera and that fellow
Gilmour?"</p>
<p>"I wonder what put that into your head," Pat smiled. "I should say nothing
whatever. I am not in Vera's confidence as far as that, but I don't think that
she likes him. Of course, he is down here a good deal, and they play a lot of
games together, but Jack Ellis has nothing to be afraid of."</p>
<p>"Ah, well, I am glad to hear that. But Gilmour is in love with Vera all
right. If you don't believe it, you watch him. Frankly, I detest the man. There
is something about him I cannot fathom. I could not put my prejudice into
words, but I should be very sorry to trust Mark Gilmour a yard. Still, never
mind about him. Let's talk about ourselves. How much longer do you mean to stay
in the city, Pat?"</p>
<p>"Well, as to that, it seems to me that I have no choice," Pat said a little
hurriedly. "In my position&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know all about that," Rust broke in impatiently. "And I know that
your father is your first consideration. But need that stand in our way? You
know what I mean. We can't go on like this. In a very short time now, I shall
be my own master, and in a position to give you everything&mdash;"</p>
<p>Pat laid an imploring hand on his arm.</p>
<p>"Not yet, Geoffrey," she said. "Not yet. Give me a little time longer.
Aren't we happy enough as it is?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well," Rust agreed reluctantly, "it is entirely in your own hands. When
you are ready, I am. For the present, at any rate, we'll leave it at that."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;A WOMAN'S WAY</h2>
<p>It was half an hour or so later when Gilmour came out of the library, having
finished his work with Croot, and crossed the hall with the intention of going
upstairs to his room. He was frequently down there at the Moat House, where
sometimes he had to stay late, and therefore a bedroom was always at his
disposal. Here he kept the necessary change, and a spare set of shaving tackle,
in fact, he was quite at home in the house. He would have gone up to his room
moodily enough now had he not noticed that a light was still burning in the
drawing-room, and as he glanced into the open door he had a glimpse of Vera,
standing there in front of the great carved fire-place. Her little slippered
foot was on the curb, and she was looking dreamily into the soft blaze made by
the wood fire, and it seemed to Gilmour as if in some way she was the spirit of
the place. In that great dim room, with its sombre walls and warm brown
colouring, she might have been born and bred there, so perfectly did she fit in
with the picture. And yet Gilmour knew but too well that Vera had been the only
child of a man who had gone out seeking his fortune in Canada over twenty years
before, taking his delicate pretty little wife with him.</p>
<p>He had been a failure from the start, and the last man in the world who
ought to have attempted a life of that sort. Out there his wife had pined and
died in those harsh rude surroundings, leaving Vera on the hapless man's hands.
And in time he had followed his wife over the borderland and, in a passing
spasm of pity, Croot had adopted Vera. Not that he had cared much for her at
first, because he was fiercely up against Fate himself, but gradually, as his
fortunes mended, and he managed to scrape something like a home together, the
child had grown upon him, until at length she became the centre of his life. It
was the one white spot on an otherwise black career. What he was, and what he
had been, Vera did not dream for a moment; she only knew that he had saved her
from something like starvation, and she was almost passionately grateful for
all his loving care and attention.</p>
<p>And now a kindly fate had made her mistress of this perfect household, a
beautiful gem in a perfect setting, and as Gilmour stood watching her in the
doorway all the mad longing to call her his rushed over him like a torrent. She
was so small and dainty, so dazzlingly fair, with a complexion like a wild rose
and a skin such as Greuze loved to paint. Conscious of his presence, she turned
towards the door with a smile.</p>
<p>"What, not gone to bed yet?" Gilmour said a little breathlessly. "It is very
late."</p>
<p>"I suppose it is," Vera replied. "I sat here dreaming over the fire, quite
forgetting all about the time. But now that you remind me, I will say good
night."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't run away like that," Gilmour replied. "Wait till your father has
finished. He won't be many minutes. Besides, I have something to say to
you."</p>
<p>"Dear me!" Vera laughed easily. "I hope it is nothing very serious. At any
rate, you look grave enough. Now, whatever have I been doing? Are you staying
here over the week-end?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing I should like better, but unfortunately there is something
that I have to do to-morrow which I cannot put off. Usually, I keep Saturdays
free, as you know, but this one is the exception to the rule. I must be in town
in the afternoon. I don't think I can even come down on Sunday."</p>
<p>Vera expressed her regret prettily enough, but it occurred to Gilmour that
she heard what he was saying with a certain sense of relief, very much as if a
schoolboy had just been informed that his master had been unavoidably detained.
It might only have been a mere fancy, but Gilmour was uncomfortably aware of
it.</p>
<p>"So our Sunday golf will have to be off," he said. "But that is not what I
wanted to speak to you about. Vera, you and I have been very good friends for a
long time now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course we have," Vera cried, with widely-opened eyes. "You have been a
splendid teacher. Where would my tennis and golf be but for you? It was you who
taught me to love the outdoor life, and I am ever grateful. Of course, I am not
big and strong like some girls are, but I think I can hold my own."</p>
<p>"Of course you can. You are a born little athlete. A sort of pocket Venus,
with a touch of Diana. But do be serious for a moment, and listen to what I
have to say. Did it ever occur to you that I am something more than a
friend?"</p>
<p>Vera looked up swiftly. There was an extra touch of colour on her cheeks and
a darker blue in her eyes, but her aspect was perfectly fearless now that she
knew what was coming. She was small and slight, a mere handful of humanity that
Gilmour could have taken and crushed between his fingers, but the courage was
there, and she would know how to use it.</p>
<p>"I am very, very sorry, Mark," she said. "Of course, I could look into the
fire with an assumption of innocence and ask you with the air of the stage
<i>ing&eacute;nue</i> what you meant, but you and I have been far too good
friends for that. But only friends."</p>
<p>"Why? Surely I have my feelings, like other men, and I suppose you have your
feelings, like other women. And you are not a child now, Vera, remember. You
must have seen for some time past that I have more than a regard for you."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I haven't," Vera said, looking him straight in the face. "I have so
many men friends, and I know that I treat them all alike. If I have said
anything&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, well," Gilmour admitted. "As to that, you certainly have nothing to
reproach yourself with. But still&mdash;"</p>
<p>Vera looked up and met his glance steadily.</p>
<p>"Hadn't you better go on," she said. "It would be far better to let me know
what is in your mind."</p>
<p>She spoke with a coolness and collectedness that she was far from feeling,
though Gilmour did not know that. He was positively staggered to discover a new
Vera altogether, and one the existence of whom he had not even contemplated. He
knew, of course, that she had a fine measure of intelligence, but here was a
personality that fairly baffled him, and filled him with a sort of impotent rage
that almost drowned the wild passion that was surging in his mind. He burst out
furiously.</p>
<p>"You are utterly unfeeling," he cried. "I wouldn't have believed it of you,
Vera. This cold-bloodedness&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Please stop," Vera said quite calmly. "This is not true, and you know it
perfectly well. Don't be dramatic. What you have been hinting at comes as a
great surprise to me, and though I am sincerely sorry, I will ask you to say no
more. What you suggest is utterly impossible. Oh, I am not going to pretend
that I don't understand, because women always understand these things, but it
cannot be, Mark, it never can. I can never marry a man whom I do not care for,
and&mdash;well&mdash;oh, please don't say any more. All this is very
distressing."</p>
<p>Gilmour reined himself in with an effort.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said harshly. "We will let the matter drop now, but I warn
you that I have not finished. One thing I am going to ask you. Is there anybody
else?"</p>
<p>Vera laughed whole-heartedly.</p>
<p>"Do you think you have a right to ask that question?" she demanded. "My dear
Mark, you are distinctly impertinent."</p>
<p>Wild words rushed to Gilmour's lips, but he contrived to restrain them.
There was something almost amusing in the idea that this girl, who was little
better than the daughter of a working man, should stand there in the ancestral
home of the Langleys in her priceless Paris gown, and with the pearls about her
neck, and speak to him as if he were some footman who had forgotten himself.
And yet she looked the part to perfection. Gilmour did not fail to note the
correctness of her pose and the slightly disdainful smile that curved her lips.
She was so absolutely calm and self-possessed too, and the more she maintained
her good humour, the smaller and the meaner did he feel.</p>
<p>"Then there is no one else?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I have not said so," Vera replied. "And now, please be content to leave
matters where they are. You have been rather rude, Mark, though I suppose you
don't know it, and I should be more than sorry that this rather unpleasant
interview made any difference in our friendship. Now shake hands and say good
night."</p>
<p>She put her hand into his, and Gilmour bent over it to hide the raging
misery that smouldered in his eyes. He was standing by the fireplace after Vera
had gone, when Croot came into the room and stood watching him.</p>
<p>"Well," the latter said, "couldn't you leave it alone after what I told you?
You don't usually make a mistake, Mark, but you have sadly blundered this
time."</p>
<p>"You have been listening," Gilmour broke out furiously.</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind, my dear fellow, nothing of the kind. Anyone with an
eye in his head could see what had happened. Your very air of dejection gives
you away. And don't say I didn't tell you what would happen. If you had only
waited&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You speak as if the whole thing had your approval," Gilmour sneered. "Well,
you haven't heard the last of it yet. And now, if you have quite done with me,
I will go to bed. I must get back to town early in the morning, and I am afraid
I shan't be able to come back this week-end. To tell you the truth, I am not
quite satisfied over Inspector Lock's attitude. There are one or two little
things that must be straightened out without delay."</p>
<p>Vera came down to breakfast the following morning, a little relieved,
perhaps, to find that Gilmour had already departed, but otherwise absolutely
untroubled in her mind. It was Saturday, and by way of being a holiday, and the
afternoon was passed on the golf links in company with Patricia Langley, who
had not given up her membership of the golf links, and was still a popular
figure there. And then followed a perfect Sunday morning, with another tramp
round the links with Patricia, and after lunch, when Croot was taking his
Sunday afternoon siesta, Vera left the house, and going along the road past the
lodge gates, turned into a small wood, where she found Jack Ellis waiting for
her.</p>
<p>It was entirely wrong, and a gross deception on her adopted father, to whom
she owed so much, but Vera reflected, as girls do, that she had given no
promise not to see or communicate with Ellis, and, indeed, the matter had not
even been mentioned. Though of course Croot had asked Ellis not to come to the
house any more, which was a distinct blunder on Croot's part, and had only had
the effect of driving Vera into her lover's arms. She knew all about him, she
knew his clean record and his prospects for the future, and it seemed to her
that Croot was adopting a line of petty tyranny quite foreign to his usual
treatment of her. Why should he behave in this way, she argued to herself. Why
this prejudice against a man with Ellis's record? And so gradually she had got
into the way of meeting the man of her heart on such afternoons as she could
get away from the house without being observed.</p>
<p>"Well, here we are again," Ellis said cheerfully. "Not that I like it very
much. But I am not going to give you up for all the Croots in the world. What
has he against me, Vera?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, as far as I can see," Vera replied.</p>
<p>She took her seat by the man's side on the trunk of a fallen tree and smiled
into his eyes as he drew her to himself and kissed those soft, yielding lips of
hers.</p>
<p>"I think it is nothing but pure prejudice," she went on, after a pause. "But
you see, Jack, some fathers are like that."</p>
<p>"Like what?" the innocent Jack asked.</p>
<p>"Well, sort of dog in the mangerish, my dear boy. They hate the idea of
their girls being married at all. The boys don't matter, they can look after
themselves, but the girls are different. It's like giving her to a strange man,
and after all, I suppose it is natural, because you never know how the strange
man is going to turn out. We shall have to be patient, Jack."</p>
<p>"Bless those beautiful blue eyes of yours, I will be as patient as you
like," Ellis cried. "And after all&mdash;well, you know what I mean. I am not a
rich man, but I am making quite a good living out of my journalism, and I have
had two or three briefs lately, as you know. I couldn't keep you in the luxury
you are accustomed to, but I am earning quite enough to give you a nice little
home, and when that old aunt of mine dies I shall be as well off as our friend,
Geoffrey Rust. Look here, Vera, has your father any prejudice in favour of
Gilmour?"</p>
<p>The quick blood mounted to Vera's cheeks.</p>
<p>"Now, whatever put that into your head?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well, never mind. I believe that there is something in it, or you wouldn't
look so strange. Has he been making love to you?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better tell you all about it," Vera said. "But until Friday
night, I never dreamt&mdash;"</p>
<p>She went on to tell her story, which was a thing she had never meant to
disclose to a soul. But then, Jack was different from most people, and, anyway,
he had surprised the secret out of her. He listened to all she had to say with
a quietness and gravity that impressed Vera strangely. She could not understand
why he was taking this view of a perfectly natural state of things.</p>
<p>"Of course, I never suspected it for a moment," she said. "For quite a long
time now, Mark Gilmour has been a sort of big brother of mine. Before Geoffrey
Rust introduced you into our house, Mark Gilmour was my instructor in all sorts
of amusements. He taught me all the tennis and golf I know, and, of course, I
am exceedingly grateful. And all the time, I never imagined&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, it's the most natural thing in the world," Ellis broke in. "I don't
see how a man could live half his time with you without falling head over ears
in love. And now I am going to tell you something that will perhaps disturb
you. I would rather see any woman I liked dead than married to that man."</p>
<p>"That is a curious thing to say," Vera said gravely. "What do you know about
Mark Gilmour?"</p>
<p>"Well, honestly, nothing; at least, not at present. But for the moment, I
must not say any more. When the time comes for me to speak, you may depend upon
it that I shall do so. It may be that there is serious trouble looming ahead,
not only for Gilmour but for other people. I know I have aroused your
curiosity, and indeed, I did not mean to tell you anything of this at all.
Let's forget all about Gilmour for the moment, and keep in mind the fact that
we have only one precious hour before us this afternoon. And, after all,
perhaps I may be wrong."</p>
<p>"Let us hope you are," Vera said. "It's such a lovely afternoon that the
idea of anything horrible seems so very far away. Now tell me all about that
new work of yours."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE TEA-TIME HOUR</h2>
<p>Though it was not quite five o'clock on that sunny afternoon in early March
when Ellis had met Vera in the little wood, Patricia had lighted the lamp in
the sitting-room of the cottage and had given her father his tea. He sat before
the fire gazing into the coals, with an expression on his face that seemed to
Pat to be something new. As a rule, he remained perfectly silent for hours
together, as if in a sort of sleep, but there was a queer alertness about him
just then that pleased Pat, and at the same time somewhat disturbed her. And
more than once since the luncheon things had been cleared away he had spoken to
her of things in the past which she had deemed to be long ago forgotten. And,
strangest thing of all, he had just asked for a book.</p>
<p>"Oh, do you really think you could follow it?" Pat asked. "Do you realize,
dad, that you haven't looked at a book for two years? I should say it was more
than that."</p>
<p>"Is it?" Langley said, with the ghost of a smile on his lips. He had
displayed more command over his powers of speech than he had done since his
seizure, and Pat was conscious of a little glow of hope as she looked at him.
"Is it all that time really? Still, I think I could follow something light, and
if you want to go out, my dear, I shall be quite all right."</p>
<p>"Well, I should like to get out for half an hour. I want to go as far as the
old place and see Vera."</p>
<p>"Quite right, quite right," Langley observed. "She is a real nice girl, is
Vera. And she comes to see me nearly every day, when you are in that hateful
city. But perhaps you won't be there much longer, Pat; things may
happen&mdash;"</p>
<p>Langley's voice trailed off into a mumble, and Pat looked at him a little
anxiously. Had he got something at the back of his mind, she wondered, or had
he guessed something of the relationship between herself and Geoffrey Rust?
Then his glance caught her questioning gaze, and he began to speak again.</p>
<p>"Never mind about me," he said. "It was only a little thought that was
passing through my mind. Put on your hat and go out, my child. I shall be quite
all right."</p>
<p>A minute or two later Pat was walking through the shrubbery leading to the
Moat House. At the bottom of the drive she came upon Vera on her way home.</p>
<p>"Oh, so you have been out too?" she cried. "I was just going up to the house
to see you. Where have you been?"</p>
<p>"Shall I tell you the truth?" Vera asked. "My dear Pat, I have been carrying
on with a young man. It is a dreadful confession, of course."</p>
<p>"In other words, you have been with Mr. Ellis. Vera, do you think that is
quite frank on your part?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," Vera said. "And, in any case, you are as much to blame
as anybody else."</p>
<p>"What precisely do you mean by that?" Pat asked.</p>
<p>"Well, my dear, if that young man of yours had not brought Jack to the Moat
House I shouldn't have known him, and in that case we shouldn't have fallen in
love with one another. Besides, it isn't fair, it isn't really. What is the
matter with Jack, and why shouldn't I love him if I want to? Oh, I know what I
owe to the man I call my father, but he is not really my father, and that makes
all the difference, you see. Don't preach, Pat; I have had such a happy
afternoon. Now, come along and have a cup of tea with me. You have already had
it? Well, I don't think much of that for an excuse."</p>
<p>They entered the house together, and crossed the wide dim hall, every inch
of which Pat knew as she knew her own hand. There were few days together without
her being inside the old home, but the feeling of regret and the sense of
desolation at her heart was nearly as keen now as it had been on the day when
she first turned her back upon the home where she had been born. Perhaps Vera
had divined something of this as she made Pat comfortable in a big arm-chair by
the drawing-room fireside and rang for tea.</p>
<p>"You are a wonderful girl, Pat," she said. "I wish I had your self-command.
Now, if it had been me, I should have hated you every time I came into the
house. I don't think I could have come into the house at all. Pat, do you
understand how it ever came about&mdash;I mean the circumstances that led to
your father losing all his money?"</p>
<p>"I never had the heart to ask," Pat sighed. "Besides, it would have been
quite useless if I had. From the moment when I found my father lying senseless
in the library till the present moment, he has never been in a fit state to
explain. I know that when his affairs came to be examined there was nothing
left except a bundle of shares in some bankrupt company. Mr. Croot was very
kind, and did his best, but it was hopeless from the first. You see, my father
had been wildly gambling for years, though after they became friends I believe
that Mr. Croot did his best to restrain him. Of course, I learnt a great deal
about this sort of thing when I went into the city, and learnt something of
business, but I would much rather not speak about it."</p>
<p>She lay back in her chair with the dainty old Worcester teacup in her hand,
one from a set of which she had used many a time in that same spot in
dispensing old-time hospitality. She was grateful, as always, to notice that
nothing had been changed there. The same silk window curtains, the same Persian
carpet on the floor, and the same old cabinets filled with priceless china
standing against the panelled walls. All over the house, every well-remembered
article was just as she had left it, and in the library the old Dutch cabinets
with their secret drawers still stood as they had done for the last two hundred
years.</p>
<p>"Doesn't it almost make you hate me?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"My dear girl&mdash;" Pat smiled&mdash;"I think I have heard you say the same
thing fifty times. And, besides, it is a great consolation to me to know that
all these things I love so well are still here, within a quarter of a mile of
the cottage door. Better than that they should be scattered far and wide, and
perhaps some day when you are married to Jack Ellis&mdash;as you will be,
sooner or later, I am sure&mdash;and Mr. Croot decides that a smaller house
will be more comfortable for him, I may be mistress here again."</p>
<p>"Ah, wouldn't that be delightful!" Vera cried. "And why not? You are not
very confiding, Pat, but I am in love myself, so I can read the signs in
others. And when Geoffrey Rust has completed his probation, he will be quite
rich, won't he?"</p>
<p>"Well, that is our dream," Pat said, looking thoughtfully into the fire. "It
may be only a dream, but it is a very pleasing one. Still, we are getting on a
lot too fast. Geoffrey has not even asked me to marry him yet."</p>
<p>"Oh, you humbug," Vera cried. "I suppose you learnt all this caution in the
city. Now, I think&mdash;what's that?"</p>
<p>Outside someone was approaching the house and walking rather noisily upon
the neatly-gravelled drive. Then a blue coat topped by a helmet appeared, and
vanished past the drawing-room windows in the direction of the front door.</p>
<p>"A policeman," Vera went on with mild curiosity. "Now I wonder what he wants here this peaceful Sunday afternoon."</p>
<p>At that same moment, seated at his desk in the library, Croot was uneasily
asking himself the same thing. A vivid recollection of what had happened on the
Friday night filled him with a vague sense of impending trouble. But he rose
coolly enough and went into the hall, when summoned by a servant to see the
unwelcome visitor who was standing stiffly on the door mat.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," the constable said. "But I am afraid I am come on
rather unpleasant business. I believe that you have a housemaid here called Ada
Avory."</p>
<p>Croot was suddenly conscious that a weight had been lifted from his mind.
This could not possibly concern him.</p>
<p>"Really, I don't know," he said. "I don't take much interest in the
servants. I will ask my daughter."</p>
<p>Vera came out into the hall at the sound of Croot's voice.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," she said. "Of course. The third housemaid. She has been with us
some little time. Don't you remember, dad, it was Mr. Ellis who found her for
me?"</p>
<p>Croot nodded vaguely. It was no further business of his, so he went back to
his work in the library.</p>
<p>"Is there anything wrong?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I can't exactly say, miss," the officer replied. "But this girl's
father left his lodgings in Wapping on Saturday morning, and he hasn't been
seen since. He is an old sailor, who was employed on the Thames as a
night-watchman on barges that are filled with goods. A rough and ready man, I
understand, and none too sober on occasion, beyond which there is nothing
against him. He may have gone off on a jag, miss."</p>
<p>"A jag?" Vera echoed. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, miss," the officer said in some confusion. "I meant to say a
spree. A drunk. They does sometimes. On the other hand, it might be serious. So
the landlady, she comes to us this afternoon and tells us all about it, so the
sergeant sent me down here after we had found out that Ada Avory was in your
employ. She might know where he is."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you want to see her?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"That's it, miss. If it isn't too much trouble."</p>
<p>Vera disappeared for a moment, to return a little later with a rather
pretty, intelligent-looking girl whose face whitened and whose eyes filled with
tears when she heard what the officer had to say. She shook her head when he
asked her if she had heard or seen anything of her father during the last two
or three days.</p>
<p>"No, indeed I haven't," she said. "What do you want me to do? Oh, don't tell
me anything has happened to him."</p>
<p>"I am not suggesting it," the policeman said with gruff sympathy. "He might
have picked up some old friends and gone off for a day or two. Being a man
living by himself in lodgings, he had no call to tell anybody he was
going."</p>
<p>"But father isn't a bit like that," the girl urged. "In that case, he would
have been certain to have written to me. Besides, I always get a letter from
him on Saturday."</p>
<p>"Then you had one yesterday?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't," the girl replied. "Oh, I must go at once and see about it.
Something must have happened."</p>
<p>Vera was full of practical sympathy at once.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to do anything in a hurry, Ada," she said. "Perhaps you
are making yourself miserable for nothing. And besides, you can't gain anything
by going off to-day, and I am quite sure the police are doing all they can.
Now, why not wait till to-morrow, and I will get Jordan to run you down to
Wapping in the small car. You must go and see Mr. Ellis. It was he who
recommended you to me, remember."</p>
<p>Vera turned to the stolid figure in blue.</p>
<p>"I think that will be the best way," she said. "Mr. Ellis, who is a friend
of mine, writes a great deal for the newspapers. He spends a lot of his time in
the East End of London, along the river, where he has lodgings, and lives just
like all the rest of them. He knows this poor girl's father quite well, and I
think you will find him exceedingly useful. Ada, you give the policeman Mr.
Ellis's address, and no doubt he will see Mr. Ellis, and tell him that you are
coming down to Wapping tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>With that the constable departed, and the tearful housemaid went off to her
own quarters. The drawing-room door being open all this time, Pat had been able
to hear practically the whole of what had been taking place.</p>
<p>"Poor child," she said, when Vera returned at length. "I do hope that there
is nothing wrong. If you like, when I get to the city to-morrow morning, I will
ask Geoffrey to go as far as Wapping and see Jack Ellis for you. It is only a
little way from Great Bower Street. Or perhaps you would like to come
along."</p>
<p>"I am afraid I shouldn't be allowed to do that," Vera said regretfully.
"Still, everything will be quite safe in the hands of Jack Ellis, and I dare
say we are making a great deal out of nothing. It makes me feel quite nervous
at times, when I think of Jack prowling about in that hateful part of London,
dressed like a navvy, and spending half his time at low public-houses."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's right enough," Pat laughed. "He's a born journalist, and the sort
of conscientious workman who prefers to get his local colour direct. I think
those sketches of his in the <i>Telephone</i> are perfectly splendid. I know a
novelist who says that Jack Ellis is one of the coming men."</p>
<p>And with that the conversation drifted into other channels, and the troubles
of the pretty housemaid were forgotten. It was quite dark by the time that Pat
left the Moat House, and made her way along the drive in the direction of the
cottage. It was very still and quiet there, for a fine rain had commenced to
fall, and all those people not in church were under cover. Pat turned out of
the drive presently, and crossed the soft turf which led her by a back way
behind the cottage. She passed round to the front door without the slightest
sound, till she came nearly to the little rustic porch, passing the lighted
sitting-room as she did so. One of the casement blinds was drawn slightly on
one side, or had not been properly draped in the first place, so that she could
see into the room, lighted as it was by the shaded lamp.</p>
<p>Then she drew her breath a little sharply as she realized the fact that her
father was no longer seated in his chair. Just for a moment she was filled with
a sort of panic.</p>
<p>He was not in the chair, neither was he on the floor, but as she stooped to
get a clearer vision of the room through the displaced blind she saw that the
major was standing bolt upright in front of the fire-place, and that he was
apparently addressing some unseen person in violent invective, for his right
hand was raised and his fist was clenched.</p>
<p>Pat darted through the front door and burst excitedly into the little room.
As she did so, Langley turned, and all the rage with which his face was
distorted disappeared as if it had been wiped off with a sponge. He made three
steps across the floor, and dropped, breathing heavily, into his chair.</p>
<p>"What&mdash;what is the meaning of this?" Pat stammered.</p>
<p>"It is nothing, my child," Langley said, speaking in the old voice that Pat
remembered so well. "A glimpse of daylight, a fleeting spasm of my old
strength. But it is gone now. Please, promise me one thing, Pat. Promise me
that you will never speak of this lapse of mine to a single soul. Forget it,
like one forgets a dream of last week. Now promise."</p>
<p>"Oh, I promise," Pat said weakly, as she dropped into a chair almost as
helpless as the man himself. "But it's wonderful. Perhaps one of these
days&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You must not even think of that," Langley said sternly.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;A MONTH'S ADJOURNMENT</h2>
<p>In a mean thoroughfare leading off High Street, Wapping, Ellis was seated at
a common deal table busy with his typewriter. The room in which he sat was
small and almost insufferably stuffy, but that did not seem to trouble him in
the slightest. He was accustomed to these discomforts, and even the
overpowering smell of fried fish which seemed to dominate the whole atmosphere
passed unnoticed. He was dressed in a shabby suit of tweeds, which apparently
had recently been disinterred from the rag bag, and a short clay pipe adorned
his lips. He worked on for the best part of an hour, upon the special which he
was writing for the <i>Telephone</i>, and which had a great deal to say with
regard to the mission he was engaged upon for his paper. He had just heard from
Inspector Lock that the dead body of Bill Avory had been taken out of one of
the ponds on Hampstead Heath, and he was debating in his mind as to whether he
should introduce the tragedy into his statement, or whether it might be
impolitic to do so. Finally he decided to say nothing about it, and make
inquiries for himself.</p>
<p>The unexpected death of Avory, which conveyed little enough to the ordinary
intelligence, was illuminating to him, in view of his knowledge as to what was
going on in connexion with those bold and startling robberies on the river. He
did not doubt for a moment that Avory's death had been deliberately brought
about by some enemy who had a pressing reason for getting the old sailor out of
the way. He was still debating the matter in his mind when the door opened and
Geoffrey Rust came in. He sniffed audibly, and hurriedly proceeded to light a
cigarette.</p>
<p>"Well, here you are," he said. "This is my first visit to your <i>Haroun al
Raschid</i> quarters, and, frankly, I don't like them. My dear chap, can't you
write those articles of yours without poisoning yourself in an atmosphere like
this?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I could," Ellis laughed. "But they wouldn't be the real thing. You see,
I must mix with the people here, or I can't possibly sketch them in their true
colours. Besides, it is not so bad. I have, at any rate, a beautifully clean
bedroom, and the public baths are only just round the corner. Then, when I am
tired of it, I put the key of my room in my pocket, and go back to my quarters
in the West End. But what brings you here?"</p>
<p>Rust proceeded to explain. He had come down there at Vera's instigation, and
he had brought Avory's daughter with him. At that very moment she was
downstairs, talking to Ellis's landlady.</p>
<p>"You see, you are more or less responsible," Rust went on. "Through your
queer friendship with this Bill Avory, his daughter found her way to the Moat
House. Isn't this man Avory one of your river allies? I mean, doesn't he keep
you posted in all the queer things those daring thieves are doing?"</p>
<p>"He did," Ellis said, with an exceedingly grave face. "But he can't do it
any longer, because, you see, he's dead."</p>
<p>"Dead? As bad as that, is it?"</p>
<p>"Worse, as a matter of fact. I am perfectly certain that poor Bill Avory was
murdered. I learnt not long ago from Inspector Lock, who has this queer
business in hand, that Avory's body has just been taken out of a pond at
Hampstead. So far as I can gather, there are no marks of violence on the
corpse, and his watch and money were found in his pockets. In the ordinary
course of events, this would be regarded as just a prosaic suicide. But knowing
what I do, I call it murder."</p>
<p>"What, murder? You might be a little more explicit."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, I can't," Ellis said, lowering his voice impressively. "My
lips are sealed. You know why I came down here. It is not altogether to write
lurid articles on the life of the submerged tenth; there was a more powerful
motive than that. I told you about it long ago. It was my idea that these big
robberies on the river were no mere exploits on the part of isolated gangs of
thieves, but part of some elaborate criminal machinery, presided over by some
one man with not only a gift for organization, but also the command of
unlimited funds. In other words, a gentleman in the cant sense of the word, and
a capitalist. Probably a merchant, and therefore in a position to handle
thousands of pounds' worth of goods at a time without incurring the least
suspicion."</p>
<p>"That sounds like a big order," Rust said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"A very big order. But I am convinced that I am right, though I couldn't
have said as much a week ago. I believe that I am on the track of the most
daring set of scoundrels in the world, and if I told you who I thought was at
the head of the conspiracy, you would fall off your chair in sheer
astonishment. What would you think if I said that I had dined at the table and
under the roof of the man who is pulling the strings?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I should have to believe it, of course," Rust said. "But is that all
you have got to tell me?"</p>
<p>"For the present, certainly. My dear chap, I dare not tell you any more. All
I can promise is that you shall know as soon as anybody else. I said that Avory
had been murdered, and I stick to it, and, what is more, I could tell you who
is responsible for this cold-blooded crime. But just now I have something else
to think about. If you will sit down and smoke a cigarette, I will see that
poor girl and break the news to her."</p>
<p>Ellis returned half an hour later, looking rather white and serious. He had
performed his uncongenial task, and appeared rather anxious to get rid of his
companion.</p>
<p>"You might get Miss Langley to tell Vera that it will be impossible for the
girl to return to the Moat House for a day or two," he said. "I will do all
that is necessary in the meantime. I have just called up Lock on the 'phone,
and he tells me that the inquest will be held at Hampstead tomorrow morning.
Meanwhile, it is my melancholy task to go as far as North London with Ada, so
that she can identify the body. In the circumstances, my dear chap, I know you
won't mind my turning you out."</p>
<p>With that Rust vanished promptly, and Ellis proceeded to pass a terribly
distressing afternoon. The gruesome thing was done at length, and he went back
to Wapping with his more or less distracted companion, and handed her over to
the care of his landlady. The inquest was timed for ten o'clock the next
morning, and he had made up his mind to be there, not that he expected anything
startling in the way of developments, but perhaps he might hear something
likely to prove useful in an investigation which had by this time become almost
an obsession with him.</p>
<p>At a few minutes past ten the next morning he found himself in a depressing
little public-house out Hampstead way, where in a dreary room the stolid
jurymen were seated listening to what a business-like coroner had to say.
Obviously, the official in question attached little importance to the inquiry,
which, from his point of view, was quite a prosaic affair. He cut short what he
had to say, and the police surgeon came forward to give evidence. At that
moment a new-comer walked into the room, a tall, elderly man with a long grey
beard and a high dome-like forehead, fringed with silver hair. He nodded
absently to Ellis, who eagerly ranged up alongside him.</p>
<p>"I hope you haven't forgotten me, Professor Phillipson. I met you once or
twice, if you remember, at the Moat House."</p>
<p>"Oh, I recollect you perfectly well, Mr. Ellis," the great man murmured. "I
think you write those riverside articles in the <i>Telephone,</i> don't you?
Most realistic work."</p>
<p>"It is very good of you to say so," Ellis replied. "But for my newspaper
work, I shouldn't be here to-day. You see, the dead man was more or less a
friend of mine, and I have every reason to believe that there is something
mysterious&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, have you indeed?" Phillipson interrupted in a harsh whisper. "Then,
between ourselves, so have I. I am not here casually, I was sent here by the
Home Office after I had laid certain facts before the authorities. I know I can
trust your discretion, and possibly we can help one another."</p>
<p>With that the professor turned abruptly away, as if he did not want to
continue the conversation, and quite tactfully Ellis appeared to be absorbed in
what was going on. He heard what the police surgeon had to say with regard to
his examination of the body, and it seemed to him that there was a kind of
conspiracy afoot to keep certain things back.</p>
<p>"I have examined the body," the surgeon was saying. "And I have come to the
conclusion that deceased had been in the water for quite eight and forty
hours."</p>
<p>"You found no marks of violence?" the coroner asked.</p>
<p>"None whatever, sir. So far as I can ascertain, there was not even a
superficial bruise."</p>
<p>"And no sign of internal injuries?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely none. Deceased was an exceedingly well-nourished man, with
perfectly healthy organs, though their condition shows a tendency to alcoholic
excess. But this, of course, has nothing to do with the cause of death, and I
merely mentioned it in the course of my diagnosis."</p>
<p>"Yes, I think I see what you mean," the coroner said. "It is possible that
the deceased was not altogether sober at the time of his death. Is that what
you mean to imply?"</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps I ought not to go quite so far as that, sir," the doctor
said. "But it might have been so. It is not for me to give a definite opinion,
and I am not prepared to say that such was the case, but it might have
been."</p>
<p>Ellis listened vaguely to what was going on. It occurred to him that in some
ways the medical witness was evading the issue. Not that he was trying wilfully
to deceive the coroner, but he certainly was leading him away from the crux of
the matter. Ellis had had a good deal of experience in coroners' courts during
the last few months, and he had made it his business to make himself quite
familiar with the processes. Moreover, it seemed to him that the coroner was
not averse from this herring being drawn across the trail, and Professor
Phillipson, who was listening attentively, nodded from time to time as he
caught the eye of the witness, and smiled approvingly. There was something here
a great deal deeper and more significant than a mere inquiry into the death of
a drunken old sailor, though Ellis would have hardly called Avory that.</p>
<p>So he sat there listening carefully, in that sordid little room, with its
stuffy atmosphere, and its stolid jurymen, frankly bored with the whole
proceedings, and wondered to himself how it was that three public officials
should be more or less in league to throw dust in the eyes of the public. The
rain dripped dismally outside, and in a corner of the room the dead man's
daughter wept silently. There was only a handful of outside spectators, drawn
there by morbid curiosity, and a couple of depressed-looking pressmen of the
average reporter type, who had come there on the off-chance of picking up the
threads of a sensation. But they had abandoned that expectation long ago, and
their trained minds told them that there was nothing more than a paragraph to
be made out of the present inquiry. The report would go somewhere on the back
pages of the daily papers, and probably be summed up in half a dozen lines. And
if there was anything behind this, then Ellis was going to make it his business
to find out all about it.</p>
<p>The witness in the box droned on monotonously, giving his expert opinion on
the cause of death, which apparently was one of ordinary drowning, though he
did not say so in those exact words, and, strangely enough, the coroner did not
press him on the point. Then came the man who had found the body and a local
police constable, who had a few words to say. Ellis turned to Avory's daughter,
and beckoned her to follow him outside.</p>
<p>"There is no occasion for you to stay here any longer," he said. "You had
better get back to Wapping, where I will see you later on. You can stay down
there till the funeral is over, and if there is anything I can do, you can
count on me. I suppose your poor father left nothing behind him?"</p>
<p>"I don't think he had a penny in the world, sir," the girl said. "He was
very liberal with his money, was father. I believe there are some books and
papers which he wanted you to have, sir. But I don't know where I am going to
get the money&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You can leave all that to me," Ellis said. "Your father and I were very
good friends, and if money is wanted I shall be only too glad to find it. Now,
you get back to Wapping, and I will come and see you later on. You had better
write to your mistress and say you won't be back for a few days."</p>
<p>Waving the girl's grateful thanks on one side, Ellis returned to the dismal
little room where the inquiry was being held, only to find that the doctor had
finished his evidence, and that the coroner was beginning to address the jury.
At that moment Professor Phillipson rose and interrupted the proceedings.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind, sir," he said, "I should like to have an adjournment
over this case. As you are aware, I represent the Home Office in certain cases
of this sort, and if I think I see something unusual, I ask that the
proceedings be postponed. I don't wish to suggest for a moment, sir, that there
is anything unusual or any ulterior motive, but in my very cursory examination
of the body it seemed to me that I saw something not altogether normal. A mere
nothing, as it were, and not at all suggestive of foul play, but in the
interests of humanity and science I should like to have a further
opportunity&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, quite so, professor, quite so," said the coroner with a readiness that
set all Ellis's suspicions at work again. "I can give my certificate for the
burial, and I won't ask you to give a verdict now, for I may want to call upon
you again. For the present, gentlemen, I wish you good morning."</p>
<p>Ellis followed the professor out into the open.</p>
<p>"Excuse me one moment, professor," he said. "But I think I can help you in
this matter. There are circumstances of which you know nothing. Of course, I
saw plainly enough that you wanted to carry this matter further without raising
any suspicions. And I can help you very much, if you will confide in me. I
know that in some way poor Avory was foully done to death, and I know that his
murder&mdash;for it is nothing else&mdash;was brought about by the very man I
am trying to lay by the heels. And if you will be good enough to confide in me,
then I think before long I can put you in the way of getting at the bottom of a
vast criminal conspiracy."</p>
<p>"Indeed," the professor said, evidently duly impressed. "Then you think that
Avory was not drowned?"</p>
<p>"I am absolutely convinced of it, Dr. Phillipson."</p>
<p>Phillipson walked along gravely for some moments, as if considering the
position as presented to him by Ellis. Then, suddenly, he seemed to make up his
mind.</p>
<p>"You are quite right, Mr. Ellis," he said gravely. "I can tell you that
Avory was dead before he was put in the water."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;A MIDNIGHT INTRUDER</h2>
<p>Croot had dined comfortably and well, as befitted a man who is in the
enjoyment of perfect health, and, moreover, rejoices in a clean conscience. It
was on the night following the inquiry into the death of Bill Avory, and Croot,
together with Vera and Mark Gilmour, was seated at the dining table at the Moat
House. It was rather a quiet meal, for Vera seemed to be engrossed in her own
thoughts, and Gilmour had not forgotten the pregnant conversation which he had
had with her at their last meeting. He was doing his best not to show this, and
some of his humorous remarks seemed to Vera to be rather forced. Besides, she
wanted to get away into the drawing-room, where an engrossing book awaited
her.</p>
<p>"You won't mind my leaving you?" she said presently. "I don't feel like
talking to-night."</p>
<p>"A little music, perhaps?" Gilmour suggested.</p>
<p>"Still less do I feel like music," Vera replied. "I am in a reading mood,
and I don't want to be disturbed. Besides, I know you will have a great deal to
talk about. So, if you are not staying here this evening, Mr. Gilmour, I will
wish you good night."</p>
<p>"Good night," Gilmour said a little moodily. "As a matter of fact, I am not
staying. I must catch the last train, and I hope you will get all the enjoyment
you expect out of your book."</p>
<p>Croot smiled not unpleasantly to himself as the door closed behind Vera, and
he and Gilmour were alone.</p>
<p>"It is no use," he said. "I told you it was no use. If you are the wise man
I take you to be, Mark, you will put Vera out of your mind altogether. Unless I
am mistaken, things are not going any too well at present, and it will take all
that cleverness of yours to put matters right again."</p>
<p>Gilmour crossed over to the door and peeped out into the hall. Then he came
back to the table again and poured himself out a glass of port. The cloth had
been removed, and there was nothing on the polished mahogany now except
decanters and glasses, and a large silver box containing the cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Just as well to be careful," Gilmour said. "I don't want any servants
listening at the door. And now that we are alone together, with no chance of
interruption, I can speak freely. Things are not going any too well. To begin
with, those people in India are very dissatisfied with the last lot of
champagne we sent them. They say that the brand is nothing like as good as they
had the right to expect. They even hint that the cases have been changed."</p>
<p>"Oh, they do, do they?" Croot muttered.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I am not sure that they are wrong. Now, obviously we don't want a
lot of correspondence about it. In our dealings with the stuff we pick up on
the river, the thing we have most to dread is an inquiry. If that sort of thing
is once set on foot, then we might find ourselves face to face with actual
shippers. You know what that means, of course."</p>
<p>Croot nodded gravely. He knew only too well what trouble lay behind a set of
searching questions.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "It will cost us a good deal of money, but you had
better get the same number of cases of the real wine, and ship them out at
once. Tell our people in Calcutta to sell the other stuff for any price they
can get for it. Cable them that the genuine goods are on their way, and say
that the whole mistake arose through the stupidity of an invoice clerk. It will
mean a dead loss, but we can't take any risks."</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact I have already done so," Gilmour said. "Another
matter. The afternoon post brought a letter from your Argentine dealers asking
us to send them a further large consignment of those Smyrna carpets. That is
one of the biggest hauls we ever made, and put at least twenty thousand pounds
into our pockets, because the stuff costing us nothing the cheque resulting was
pure gain. And now those chaps want some more. I can't write and tell them that
we can't get them, for that would only make them suspicious. We must manage to
send them, somehow. Now what do you suggest?"</p>
<p>"There is only one thing to do," Croot muttered.
"We shall have to buy a big consignment of Smyrna carpets through Verity's in
the ordinary way of business, and ship them out to the Argentine at our own
expense, because we should never be able to offer the stuff at the same price
as we did before. Nor can we refuse to do business. Upon my word, Gilmour, I
almost begin to wish that I hadn't touched this thing. I have a great mind to
cut it altogether and retire on what I have made. Not that I run any risk."</p>
<p>"Yes, you took good care of that, didn't you?" Gilmour sneered.</p>
<p>"And why not?" Croot demanded. "The scheme was mine, it was my money that
bought Verity's rotten business, and so brought Crombie's Wharf into my hands,
without which we could not have touched it. I found you completely on your beam
ends, thrown out of the Navy, having been convicted of absolute dishonesty, and
I put you on your feet again. You are running a certain amount of risk, it is
true, but if you haven't made a fool of yourself, you ought to be worth thirty
thousand pounds at the present moment."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Gilmour said, showing his teeth unpleasantly. "But
if anything happens I go down, and Mortimer Croot, Esquire, of the Moat House,
Cray, walks about with his head in the air, envied and respected by all who
know him. He will tell everybody how shocked he was to find his trusted employe
had abused a confidential position to rob half the merchants in London. He
would come forward at the trial and tell the jury how that scoundrel, Mark
Gilmour, had been keeping a set of secret ledgers and letter books relating to
the stolen properties. And he would make an appeal to the judge for mercy on
the ground that the wretched Gilmour had been a good servant to him in every
other respect. I can hear you saying it, I can see the judge smiling at you as
you stand in the witness box, and complimenting you on your fine good nature.
Good Lord, the hypocrisy of it all!"</p>
<p>"Well, why not?" Croot said, not in the least moved. "There is not the least
reason why we should both suffer. You wouldn't be a bit happier if you thought
I was in the next cell to your own. And besides, you wouldn't get more than a
few years, and if I stood in the dock with you, what would become of your
little fortune when you came out again? Whereas, whilst one of us retains his
freedom, the other can look forward with certainty to coming into his little
lot when the trouble is past. It isn't like you to talk in that way, Mark."</p>
<p>Gilmour muttered something under his breath. There was a vast amount of
worldly wisdom in what Croot was saying, and he was perfectly well aware of the
fact. Still, it galled him at times to know that if anything went wrong he
would have to face the music, and the man who had inspired and financed the
whole scheme would be holding up his head amongst honest people, and be
accepted as one of themselves.</p>
<p>"Oh, very well," Gilmour said. "I won't pursue the subject, but it does gird
me sometimes to hear you talk. And now, if you haven't any more to discuss, I
think I will get along."</p>
<p>"One moment," Croot said, as Gilmour rose. "Have you heard any more from
that seaman you told me about? You know what I mean. The man on the barge."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean Avory," Gilmour said, without moving a muscle. "The man who
was on the <i>Sharkstooth</i> with me? Well, he's dead. He died three or four
days ago."</p>
<p>A queer spasmodic grin trembled about the corners of Croot's mouth. Just at
that moment he would have given a good deal to know that he and Gilmour had
never met.</p>
<p>"That is lucky for you," he managed to say, "exceedingly lucky. What did
the poor fellow die of?"</p>
<p>"Well, he didn't die at all in the ordinary sense of the word," Gilmour
replied, as he helped himself to a cigarette. "Most extraordinary thing. He was
found drowned in a pond at Hampstead. What he was doing there, so far away from
Wapping, goodness only knows. He wasn't robbed either, because a watch and some
money were found on the body. As you say, it was rather lucky for me, because
Avory might have made himself infernally unpleasant."</p>
<p>Gilmour rose and stole leisurely towards the door. When he had gone, and the
front door of the house closed behind him, Croot drew a long deep breath, and
wiped the beads of moisture off his forehead. Just for once in a way, he was
feeling sore afraid. He had not dared to put any further questions to Gilmour,
not that there had been any occasion to do anything of the sort, because he
knew, as well as if Gilmour had confessed in his own cynical fashion, that
Avory had been foully murdered.</p>
<p>"This is terrible," he whispered to himself. "Why did he tell me? I didn't
want to know, and I should never have found out. I shall have to drop this
business. I shall have to retire from the city altogether. If Gilmour likes to
carry on by himself he can. I will have no more to do with it."</p>
<p>Then another thought flashed into his mind, a reflection that brought him to
his feet and set him pacing restlessly round the table. It was horrible to
contemplate the mere suggestion that this cold-blooded assassin had actually
dared to ask that he should be welcomed to the Moat House as the recognized
lover of little Vera. The mere thought of it caused Croot to clench his fists
and grind his teeth with impotent rage. He knew perfectly well that Vera had
declined quite pleasantly to hear a single word that Gilmour had to say on the
subject, but the man came down to the Moat House regularly, and inevitably
there were times when he and Vera were alone together.</p>
<p>And, in some way or another, this would have to be stopped. The idea of Vera
walking about the grounds, or on the golf links, chatting and smiling into the
face of a man whose hands were red with the blood of a fellow-creature, was
absolutely maddening. For an hour or more Croot sat there with his head buried
in his hands, trying to find some way out of the impasse. So deeply engrossed
was he in his thoughts that he failed to hear Vera outside the door, nor did he
look up until she was standing by his side, with her hand caressingly on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>"A penny for your thoughts, dad," she said, smilingly.</p>
<p>With difficulty, Croot repressed a shudder. If Vera could have seen into his
mind at that moment, she would have fled distractedly from the house, late as
it was, and never looked upon his face again. He managed to force a smile to
meet hers.</p>
<p>"Oh, business," he said. "Just a knotty little business problem that has
been worrying me lately. Even we prosperous men have our worries, you know,
Vera."</p>
<p>"Well, don't sit up too late over it," Vera said. "I am going to bed now.
Good night, dad."</p>
<p>She closed the door behind her, to Croot's infinite relief, and then, as he
sat there, the house gradually lapsed into silence, and he could hear nothing,
except the tap, tap of Vera's slippers as she pattered about in her bedroom
overhead. And then, some half hour later, it came more or less vaguely to
Croot's highly-strung nerves that some one was moving about in the library.</p>
<p>He crept quietly out into the hall and very cautiously peered into the
library, where he could see a thin wedge of light that seemed to come from an
electric torch which had been laid flat on the table, so that the beam of light
shone directly on the old-fashioned fastening of a big Chippendale secretaire
that stood in the corner of the room. Croot could hear nothing, except what
sounded like heavy breathing, nor could he make out more than the faint outline
of the unwelcome intruder.</p>
<p>What was the man after? he wondered. There was nothing of the slightest
importance in the house, for Croot had not so much as a fireproof safe there.
He had no valuables stored away, and no securities, and, so far as the contents
of the secretaire were concerned, he could remember nothing in there beyond a
litter of private papers of no sort of value to a soul.</p>
<p>Now Croot was courageous to a certain extent; he had a fine cunning of his
own, and a dogged determination of purpose which had carried him a long way.
But he lacked the real force necessary to tackle a midnight intruder who had
the vim and dogged nerve to burgle a house in this fashion. So that, instead of
turning on the lights and making a bold dash for the burglar, Croot stood
hesitating as to what to do next. Then the man in front of the secretaire rose
and, just for an instant, Croot had a passing vision of his features. He was
not wearing a mask in the ordinary way, but his mouth and the lower part of his
face up to his eyes were hidden behind a black scarf which appeared to be
fastened at the back of his neck. And Croot could see a strange gleam in those
eyes that suggested a mind unhinged and unbalanced. Then the light vanished,
and, almost before Croot knew what had happened, a pair of hands were fastened
on his throat, and a hard, horny thumb in some kind of glove was pressing on
his windpipe.</p>
<p>Taken utterly aback, Croot fought for what he knew was his life. The panic
of fear that gripped him gave him extra strength, and he managed to tear
himself free from that deadly clutch. Then something dashed with force into his
face, and he staggered backwards, falling with his head against a big china
vase on the floor and lapsed into unconsciousness. The vase toppled over, and
crashed with a noise as loud as the bursting of a bomb.</p>
<p>Vera, creeping down the stairs in her slippered feet, in search of the book
which she had left behind her, heard the noise, and flew along the hall in the
direction of the library. She had not turned on the light, and now, in the
excitement and fear of the moment, she lost her bearings, and was utterly at a
loss to know just where she was standing. She called aloud, and then found
herself in the centre of a ring of light that played full on her face. With a
rare courage born of the peril of the moment she snatched at the torch, and by
great good luck dragged it from the hand that was holding it. Then she found
herself looking into a pair of gleaming eyes, and was conscious of a firm,
clean-shaven mouth from which the black scarf had slipped. It was only for a
moment, and then, half-fainting, Vera slid against the wall and dropped
helplessly into an old oak chair that fortunately happened to be near enough to
catch her. The intruder picked up his torch again quite coolly, and, walking
through the doorway of a small morning-room, disappeared.</p>
<p>Half-dazed and wholly terrified, Vera managed to find the switch, and
flooded the hall with light. For the moment, at any rate, she had forgotten the
significance of the shattered vase, for she had seen something that was
trembling on the edge of madness.</p>
<p>"Impossible," she whispered to herself. "I must be dreaming. And yet, how
could I mistake that face? The face of a man who I know is absolutely beyond
the reach&mdash;"</p>
<p>She fell forward fainting on the floor.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE NAVAL GROUP</h2>
<p>"That," Ellis said, "I am quite prepared to learn. I should have been very
much surprised if it had been otherwise."</p>
<p>Professor Phillipson seemed to be deeply interested. He knew very little of
Ellis beyond the fact that he had met him more than once at the Moat House, and
had learnt that he was a brilliant member of the staff of the <i>Telephone.</i>
He knew, of course, that the popular press generally takes a keen interest in
criminal matters, and that occasionally these journals were of considerable
assistance to the authorities at Scotland Yard. But here was the fringe of a
deep mystery which was engaging the attention of the authorities, and one,
moreover, which Inspector Lock had introduced to his notice with a hint to the
effect that it was not to be mentioned outside a certain circle. And behold
here was a mere journalist, or so the professor imagined, who was thrusting his
way into the inner ring as calmly as if he were one of the elect.</p>
<p>"You have been very frank," Ellis said, reading something of what was
passing through the professor's mind. "You will know before long that you have
committed no indiscretion in more or less taking me into your confidence. As a
matter of fact, Dr. Phillipson, I knew that poor fellow quite well. I have been
out on the Thames with him many a night, and if he had not been done to death,
as I am sure he was, I have no doubt that he would have been of the greatest
assistance to me in an investigation I am making on behalf of my paper in
connexion with those extraordinary robberies which have been taking place for
more than a year now on the river. I believe that the leading spirit in those
thefts was actually concerned in the murder of the man called Bill Avory. I
should not have spoken to you this afternoon, but I know Inspector Lock quite
well, and I felt convinced that you would not have been down here to-day unless
he had asked you to come."</p>
<p>"Well, that's true enough," Phillipson admitted. "I see you know a great
deal, Mr. Ellis, and, as far as I can, I will help you. Now, on three occasions
in the last few months a body has been picked out of the water somewhere in
precisely the same circumstances as surrounded the death of this man
Avory."</p>
<p>"One moment," Ellis interrupted. "Can you tell me if the victims were always
sailors or longshoremen."</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe that is the fact," Phillipson replied. "In each instance
they were men from either Stepney or Wapping, and each of them was found some
distance away from where he lived. Now, I ask you, Mr. Ellis, what could bring
this unfortunate Avory at least five miles away from his house, when, so far as
we know, he had not even an acquaintance in Hampstead?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that is what we have got to find out. Do you mean to say it was the
same in every instance?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. In the first case no great suspicion was aroused, though we
were able to find out that the drowned man was not really drowned at all. That
was more or less of an accident. But when the second case happened, and
Scotland Yard called me in, I was certain that we had come in contact with
something exceedingly sinister. And now I am convinced of it. When I tell you
that Avory was dead before he was placed in the water, I am not guessing, Mr.
Ellis, I am going on exact scientific data. I can't tell you as yet exactly how
he was killed, but I shall be able to tell you within the next day or two. But
stop a moment, perhaps you could help me. You knew this man Avory quite well.
Did you happen to notice anything wrong with one of his hands?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't," Ellis replied. "I am pretty sure there was nothing wrong
with either of them. They were very strong capable hands, and I noticed that
more than once. Broad and short, as sailors' hands always are, with broken
nails, and spatulated fingers. No, there was nothing wrong."</p>
<p>The professor abruptly turned round and led the way to the little
public-house where the inquest had been held. The sergeant in charge of the
case was still on the spot, an after a few whispered words from the professor,
they passed along the passage at the back of the house till they came to the
outhouse in which the body of the unfortunate Bill Avory lay.</p>
<p>"Now, look and see," the professor murmured. "Look at Avory's hands, and
tell me if you notice anything."</p>
<p>Ellis bent down and examined the roughened hands carefully. Then he
straightened himself up quickly.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," he said. "The right hand appears to be drawn and withered, and
there is a scar across the palm that might have been caused by a burn. But
would an ordinary burn draw up the muscles of the arm as this one seems to have
done?"</p>
<p>"No, it wouldn't," the professor said dryly. "I would rather not be more
explicit for the moment, but you shall know all in good time. Now, I want to
impress upon you that in the three cases I have been speaking of, there was the
same mark upon one hand in every instance. But this I will ask you not to
mention, at any rate, not to mention in print."</p>
<p>"I should not dream of doing such a thing," Ellis said. "I am really much
obliged to you, professor, and all the more so because I am convinced that you
are helping the interests of justice, in so far taking me into your confidence.
I suppose you would not like to tell me exactly what caused those marks?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I should," Phillipson said grimly. "And all the more so,
because I am not absolutely certain myself. But one thing we have to do, and
that is to avoid letting these miscreants know that we are on the right track.
Perhaps you noticed at the inquest how the coroner avoided asking certain
pertinent questions, and how there was no sort of allusion on the doctor's part
to his finding water in the dead man's lungs, as would have been the case had
he been merely drowned. And you heard what I said when I asked for an
adjournment. The last thing in the world I want is to arouse the slightest
uneasiness amongst the group of men who are responsible for these diabolical
murders. You may have noticed that I was careful in putting them off the
track."</p>
<p>"I did notice it," Ellis said. "In fact, if I had not done so, I should not
be talking to you now. But probably some confederate was listening to the
evidence."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think so," the professor said. "There has been no suspicion in
either of these cases of any sensational happenings, and I am hoping that the
murderers have become careless. You see, that is what you may call a mere item
of news, and only worth a small paragraph in the back pages of the daily press.
But I think, Mr. Ellis, that I can make it a national drama, which, of course,
is the very last thing I want to do. And you think this is in some way
connected with those robberies on the river?"</p>
<p>"I am absolutely certain of it," Ellis said with conviction. "But if you
asked me for the slightest atom of proof at this moment I could not give it
you. Still, if you will let me have your address and allow me to call upon you,
I hope before long to give you something concrete, if I might be allowed to
call you upon the telephone. That is, if you are not too busy."</p>
<p>Professor Phillipson handed over his card, and an invitation to Ellis to
call and see him at any moment he chose. With that they went their different
ways, Ellis returning to Wapping. For the next day or two he was too busy in
connexion with the funeral arrangements to give much time to the problem that
was occupying a good deal of his attention, but once that was over he was free
to go back again to the matter of the robberies.</p>
<p>"Now, you had better get back to the Moat House," he said to Ada Avory. "But
before you go, is there anything else that I can do to help you?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, sir," the girl said with the tears in her eyes. "Your kindness
has been wonderful, and I don't know how to thank you. I have cleared up all my
father's affairs here, and I shall be only too glad to get to work again. But
don't forget, sir, that there are one or two things that I have to hand over to
you."</p>
<p>"I had forgotten," Ellis confessed. "There were some papers that your
father had, written years ago by a young sailor who had quite a genius for
writing fiction. I think he was drowned in the Chinese seas. It's such a long
time since your father mentioned it that the matter had almost escaped my
memory."</p>
<p>"That's right, sir," the girl went on. "He was a clever lad, and always
writing. I don't suppose that what he left behind is of any value, but I know
my father intended you to have it. I have a little black box here."</p>
<p>Ellis took the box away presently to his own lodgings, and in a spirit of
more or less idle curiosity turned the contents out on to the table. There was
a mass of manuscript, written in a crabbed, uneducated hand: short, pungent
sketches of the sea, which Ellis could see, even from a casual glance,
contained a good deal of graphic power, though the words were mostly ill-spelt,
and the grammar left a good deal to be desired. He sat reading these for the
best part of an hour, before he turned the key in the door of his sitting-room,
and, changing into a suit of Harris tweeds, turned out into the road, and half
an hour later was closeted with Inspector Lock in the latter's room at Scotland
Yard.</p>
<p>"I am quite inclined to agree with you," the inspector said. "I have just
been talking to Professor Phillipson on the telephone, and he told me all about
his conversation with you two or three days ago. Of course, I cannot tell you
exactly the lines he is working on, but he has not been wasting his time, and I
hope that within the next few hours I shall know exactly how the man Avory came
by his death. Which means, of course, that I shall know how the other two men
were murdered."</p>
<p>"Stop a moment," Ellis said. "Now, let me see if I can work out a bit of
logical deduction. I haven't the remotest notion of what the names of the other
two men were, but I think I should be correct in saying that they were both
bargemen, or night watchers, or something of that kind, connected with the
lighters that come up the river, laden with goods for the various
warehouses."</p>
<p>"Go on," Lock smiled. "So far, you are absolutely correct. But that doesn't
prove much, does it?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. But surely it points to these men being got out of the way by
the big gang who are responsible for all those robberies? Those unfortunate men
were in a position to give certain evidence. They probably identified one of
the gang, just as poor old Bill Avory did&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Or thought he did," Lock corrected.</p>
<p>"'Um. Are you quite sure he only <i>thought</i> he did? I doubt it. Oh yes,
you are alluding to what you consider to be his mistake in accusing Mr. Mark
Gilmour of being identical with the man Avory once knew on board the
<i>Sharkstooth</i>."</p>
<p>"It must have been a mistake," Lock insisted. "Now, just consider the facts.
Within a very short time of Avory being surprised on the barge you were talking
to me on the telephone, and giving me the facts. What do I do? I go off direct
to Cray, with the object of making sure of my ground, after having first looked
up Gilmour's flat in the telephone directory, and ascertaining from his
landlady he was dining out that night, and that he would not be back till
morning. When I get down to the Moat House I see Mr. Croot, and explain to him.
He merely laughs at me. He says that Mr. Gilmour is in the dining-room and
invites him to come and see me. He is beautifully turned out in evening dress,
as clean and immaculate as a new pin, and not in the least disturbed in his
manner. Mind you, it would have been quite easy for him to tell me that he was
in time for dinner, but he did nothing of the sort. He said that he had been
detained late on business, and that he had changed in his flat, and reached
Cray by a train that gets there at 8.30. In the circumstances, I couldn't deny
it. The last time he was seen, if he was seen at all, was escaping from the
river by swimming. Of course, he might have got down there and changed into
evening clothes, but if we assume that, we must put down Mr. Croot as a
deliberate liar. We must go even further, and suggest that he was a party to
the conspiracy. Is that what you mean, Mr. Ellis?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I do," Ellis said coolly. "Why not? I am absolutely convinced
that Avory made no mistake, and if I am right, then Croot must have shielded
Gilmour. There must have been collusion. Gilmour got down there, probably in
his wet clothes, or perhaps he changed them in a taxi as he drove down. You can
bet your bottom dollar that these chaps have taxi and motor-car drivers in
their pay. In that case, you will see that it would not have been difficult for
Gilmour to get down to the Moat House and change into evening dress in one of
the bedrooms. I know he frequently spends the week-end there, and has his own
room, which is over the library. Probably in some way he gave Croot a signal.
But that I can find out, because one of my particular friends was dining at
the Moat House on the night in question. And, by Jove, now I come to think of
it, so was Professor Phillipson."</p>
<p>"That is interesting," Lock cried. "But, stop a moment. To make assurance
doubly sure, Gilmour handed me the return half of a first-class ticket from
Charing Cross to Cray, taken out that evening, and given up on arrival at the
latter station. Now, when I came to make inquiries, I found that only one
first-class ticket from Cray was issued on the same night, the outer half of
which was handed over at Cray by a tall man who was obviously in evening dress.
I think you will admit that that will want some getting over. What do you think
of that, Mr. Ellis?"</p>
<p>"Well, it certainly sounds like a bit of a poser," Ellis admitted. "But let
us argue that Gilmour was a man who was taking no risks. On the night in
question he was engaged in a dangerous occupation, with the possible chance of
being identified. As a matter of fact, as it turns out he <i>was</i>
identified. He wants an alibi, and if the alibi is not necessary, there is no
harm done. But suppose he arranged with one of his confederates to go down to
Cray by that train and hide the return half of the ticket where he could find
it. It might have been hidden in half a dozen places. Now perhaps you begin to
see how that business of the little bit of blue pasteboard helped to convince
you that Avory had made a mistake. Don't you think the explanation is
plausible?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is," Lock admitted.</p>
<p>"Very well then. In that case, it looks very much as if Gilmour was at the
head of the gang on the river, and that he and his friends are behind the
series of murders that got rid of those three unfortunate longshoremen. I am
not saying for the moment that Croot knew anything about it, but if Gilmour was
lying that night, as I feel quite convinced he was, then Croot must be in it.
This is going to be a ghastly business, Lock."</p>
<p>"It is a ghastly business," Lock agreed. "And you will realize it thoroughly
when Professor Phillipson has finished the experiments that he is working on.
At any rate, after what you say, I will have a close watch kept on Gilmour's
movements. If he is in this business, we shall have him before many days have
passed."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;17 GREENCORN STREET</h2>
<p>A little before one o'clock on the following afternoon Ellis called up
Geoffrey Rust on the telephone, at the office in Great Bower Street, and having
assured himself that the man he wanted was at the other end of the wire,
suggested that Rust should jump into a taxi, and come round to their club and
lunch with him. He would not keep Rust long, he said, but he particularly
wanted to see him on an urgent personal matter.</p>
<p>"Don't comment on it," he said. "Don't say a word, but come without saying
where you are going."</p>
<p>"Right-o," Rust said cheerfully. "I will be there in twenty minutes at the
outside."</p>
<p>Half an hour later he and Ellis were seated in the corner of the big
dining-room apart from the rest of the members, where they could talk without
interruption, or the chance of being overheard. There were very few people
seated in the room that afternoon, and therefore Ellis could speak freely.</p>
<p>"What's the trouble?" Rust asked, as he unfolded his napkin. "I thought you
sounded rather serious on the 'phone. Oysters? Thanks. And a glass of Chablis,
if you don't mind."</p>
<p>Ellis watched the waiter out of earshot out of the corner of his eye, but he
said nothing until their cutlets were served and there was no chance of
interruption for at least a quarter of an hour. Then his manner changed
entirely.</p>
<p>"I am going to give you a bit of a shock," he said. "I am going to let you
into police secrets, old chap. You have heard all about those wholesale
robberies that are taking place constantly on the river barges and lighters, in
spite of all that the authorities can do to stop them. Stuff stolen to the
extent of millions."</p>
<p>"That's common knowledge," Rust said. "In our office we are constantly up
against it. And we suffer with the rest."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose you do, but there are compensations. Now everybody is agreed
that this business is conducted on clever lines and backed by both brains and
money. Suppose that it was worked by some big firm apparently doing legitimate
business."</p>
<p>"By Jove! I never thought of that," Rust cried. "Still, now you come to
mention it, I don't see why not."</p>
<p>"And suppose Croot was the rogue in the play?"</p>
<p>Rust repressed a desire to shout aloud. He looked at his companion with utter amazement.</p>
<p>"You're not pulling my leg by any chance?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Upon my word I almost wish I was," he said. "Whether he is or not remains
to be proved, but Gilmour is to a dead certainty. I am out to get to the bottom
of this thing, and that is why I am now living a sort of dog's life Wapping way
on behalf of my paper. I am commissioned to dig the truth out. And, by the
great horn spoon, I am doing it, thanks to a little luck."</p>
<p>"Mean to say that you have got there?" Rust gaped.</p>
<p>"Well, I won't go quite so far as that," Ellis said. "But I am well on the
way. And now, if you will just smoke a cigarette and smile with an air of
polite boredom as if I were telling you the story of some futile golf match,
I'll get on. Whatever I may say, please don't look astonished."</p>
<p>"Sounds interesting," Geoffrey murmured. "To deceive any eavesdropper I will
look as like a petrified owl as I can. Fire ahead, for on my honour you fairly
intrigue me."</p>
<p>In an undertone and with a sharp eye for intruders Ellis proceeded to tell
his story. It took some time, but at length he had related it down to the
minutest detail. Rust whistled softly between his teeth. It was very much to
him as if he had been reading some melodramatic novel. And yet on the face of
it he could not doubt that his friend was on the right track.</p>
<p>"Amazing," he muttered. "And do you really think that your hard-hearted
prospective father-in-law is behind this?"</p>
<p>"I don't see how it can be otherwise. Why should he deliberately shield
Gilmour if he were innocent of the fact? Of course, he might have done it out
of pure good nature, but I don't see him going quite so far as that. By some
means or another, Gilmour managed to get down to the Moat House the night I am
speaking of, and with Croot's help contrived to throw dust in the eyes of
Inspector Lock. I know pretty well how the thing was worked, unless my theory
is altogether wrong, but there are one or two details that I can't quite fit
in. I must get my jig-saw puzzle perfect, otherwise I can't get on."</p>
<p>"And you want me to help you, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"That's the idea. And I think you can do it. I wasn't present on the night
of the birthday dinner, for reasons which I need not go into, but you were, and
that is why I have betrayed confidence, so to speak, and given you all this
information. My notion is that by some means or another Gilmour managed to give
Croot a signal. He must have raced off down there, hell for leather, directly
he got out of the Thames&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But how do you know he was in the Thames?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I got that from the river-police patrol. They ran down the boat
containing Gilmour and his confederate, and probably those two swam ashore. I
dare say they had some place to make for, but we need not trouble about that
for the moment. Then Gilmour got hold of some motor vehicle, probably belonging
to one of the gang, and hurried off to the Moat House. Now, we know that not
much more than an hour later he was seated in the library, bathed and dressed
quite correctly, waiting there until the dinner was over, because he had got
down too late to take a part in the proceedings. I contend that he could not
have got into the house and changed into dress clothes without&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, as to that," Rust interrupted. "I believe he keeps a set of dress
clothes at the Moat House. I know he has a bedroom there, which is just over
the library, and one that could be reached by a back staircase. But even then,
my friend, he would not have dared to walk into the house at that time of night
dressed like a tramp, for fear of running into one of the servants."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's just my idea," Ellis said. "That would have spoilt the whole
thing. He must have been admitted by somebody in the know, but who could that
some one be?"</p>
<p>"Well, certainly not one of the servants," Rust said. "They are not that
type, any of them. Therefore, we are forced to act on the assumption that Croot
took a hand at the game himself. I don't see how he could have done that."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you don't, off-hand. But just think a bit. You were at the dinner
party, and it is not so long ago that you have forgotten all the details. I
suppose you were sitting at the table for the best part of a couple of hours. I
remember that Croot likes to sit round the dinner-table after the meal is over
and smoke two or three cigarettes."</p>
<p>"That is precisely what we did do," Rust said. "It was a cheerful party on
the whole, and there were some very interesting people there. Professor
Phillipson, for one."</p>
<p>"Yes, I had forgotten that for the moment," Ellis said. "Of course he was.
Now, did nothing happen? Did Croot sit there without going out of the room
until the ladies had left?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so," Rust said. "No, by Jove! he didn't. I remember now that he
was very anxious to try some new cigars of his. They were smokes that he had
imported himself from Cuba, and he went to the library himself to fetch
them."</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound like him," Ellis said. "Now, why did he go and fetch
those cigars himself?"</p>
<p>"Oh, ask me an easy one," Rust said flippantly. "Perhaps he had got them
locked up. Perhaps he was afraid to trust the key to the butler. A dozen
reasons."</p>
<p>"That is all very well," Ellis said persistently. "But that doesn't sound
much like Croot either. The man may have the bad taste to object to me, but
that does not blind me to his few virtues. I have had those cigars in the house
myself. I know where they are kept. They lie in a recess over the fire-place,
quite a dozen boxes of them. I am certain that Croot never locked up any
cigars. He must have had some powerful reason for leaving, then. Tell me
exactly what happened."</p>
<p>"Well, it was like this. The general took a cigar from his case, and Croot
jumped up immediately and said he couldn't allow his guest to smoke one of his
weeds. And besides, he was very anxious for the old boy to try one of his own
brand. So he jumped up at once, and came back in a few minutes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"How many minutes?" Ellis asked crisply.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, come to think of it, it might have been ten. The conversation was
rather lively, and I couldn't say to a second. Anyway, Croot came back again
with the box of cigars in his hand, and told us, incidentally, that Gilmour was
in the library. I think he said the chap had got there too late for dinner, and
was waiting to join us with the coffee."</p>
<p>"'Um, yes; in the face of what I have just told you, doesn't that strike you
as rather significant?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it does. But I can't see how Croot knew that Gilmour had
arrived at the last moment."</p>
<p>"Now, just think. Try and remember exactly what happened just before Croot
got up in that abrupt way and rushed off to the library for the cigars. Did you
happen to notice anything strange in his manner a few minutes before?"</p>
<p>"No, except that he complained of a twinge of neuralgia. He reminded us that
once, years ago, in Canada, he had suffered from frost-bite, and that every now
and then the neuralgia troubled the spot. He sat rather quiet, as if in pain,
with his head hung down over his dessert-plate, but I saw nothing else."</p>
<p>"What was he doing with his dessert-plate?" Ellis persisted.</p>
<p>"Oh, come, really you can't expect&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear chap, I am asking you for the minutest details. If you can
recollect so much as the breaking of a glass, I want you to tell me all about
it. Surely there was something. I can't believe that Croot jumped up in that
abrupt fashion without some powerful reason. Some signal, an owl hooting
outside, any little thing like that that would strike you as trivial at the
time."</p>
<p>Rust thought hard for a minute or two.</p>
<p>"It's all coming back to me now," he said presently. "Oh, I will tell you
one little thing for what it's worth. During a slight lull in the conversation
Vera sat up suddenly and wanted to know what the noise was outside."</p>
<p>"What sort of a noise was that?" Ellis demanded.</p>
<p>"Oh, a tapping on the window. Just as if a loose trail of a creeper was
blown in the wind. It was rather a rough night, and we thought nothing of it,
especially when Croot said he had told the gardener more than once to tie the
thing up again."</p>
<p>"And you call that nothing," Ellis smiled. "Was it after that tapping on the
window that Croot had his turn of neuralgia?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think it was. I know he bent over his plate and told us to take no
notice of him. The tapping went on for some little time, and then stopped
altogether."</p>
<p>"And what was Croot doing meanwhile?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing, I suppose. Yes, he was though. He was fiddling with his
dessert-knife on the edge of his plate."</p>
<p>Ellis rose abruptly to his feet. There was a smile in his eyes now, and a
suggestion that something pleased him.</p>
<p>"That will do, Geoff," he said. "The tapping outside was a signal to Croot,
and his playing with his dessert-knife on his plate was a reply to the man
outside. A sort of Morse code. Now my chain of evidence is practically
complete. I am not going to keep you any longer, so you can go back to the
office again. I dare say they are wondering what has become of you."</p>
<p>"Not to any great extent," Rust grinned. "If I never went there again there
would be no great outcry."</p>
<p>Ellis went thoughtfully back to Wapping, and once he had reached his rooms
there lighted a cigarette and took from a cupboard the little black box of
papers that Ada Avory had given him. He was a long time poring over the diary
which had come into Avory's hands after the death of the sailor boy, and he
read the ill-spelt ungrammatical pages there with considerable pleasure. For
here had been a genius, a man who would have gone a long way had he lived and
had the advantage of some education. With a little revision and alteration the
matter would be quite fit for publication, and Ellis had it in his mind to
overhaul the manuscript with a view to its appearance in due course in the
literary pages of the <i>Telephone.</i> He put the stuff by presently, and
then, with his mind more than half upon the events of the morning, began idly
to turn over the contents of the box.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of lumber here and there, cuttings from papers,
certificates of character, and the other odds and ends gathered by a man who
has spent most of his life in remote corners of the world. And then Ellis sat
up suddenly as he came upon a half-page photograph, evidently torn from some
illustrated weekly paper like the <i>Sketch,</i> or the <i>Tatter.</i> It was
just a group probably taken on board one of His Majesty's destroyers or
gunboats, and represented two officers with a handful of men and petty officers
seated on a deck with a background that looked to Ellis like a sandy
palm-fringed beach in some tropic sea. There was no date on the paper, and no
letterpress on the reverse side, so that it was not easy to say from what
periodical it had been taken.</p>
<p>But Ellis was not concerned with that for the moment. What thrilled him was
the fact that one of the two officers in blue with the gold lace on their
sleeves was strangely familiar. He looked at it again and again, and then,
taking a magnifying glass from a drawer in the table, applied it to the
photograph. He drew a long breath, then whistled softly.</p>
<p>"Gilmour for a million," he muttered. "So poor old Bill Avory was not
mistaken. Yes, that's Gilmour all right, no getting away from that thrust-out
jaw of his. It will take a bit of time, but I shall locate the name of this
journal yet. But what's this?"</p>
<p>Somebody had made a cross in ink over the head of the central figure in the
photograph, and under another cross at the foot of the page were written the
words&mdash;"Mark Gilmour, what ho!"</p>
<p>This was sarcastic, of course, and Ellis read it accordingly. No doubt the
writing was Avory's, and the exclamation after it intended to convey a delicate
doubt as to whether or not Gilmour was the right name. Beyond all question,
Avory knew it himself, but then the old seaman was past giving evidence
now.</p>
<p>Ellis turned over the papers idly, until he came at length to a visiting
card with the name obliterated carefully, and under it in pencil the words
"8.30 this evening sharp. 17 Greencorn Street."</p>
<p>"We are certainly getting on," Ellis told himself. "Now, I wonder where the
deuce Greencorn Street is. I must really find out what is going on there.
Perhaps I can locate it in the telephone directory. Anyhow, I am going to have
a look at it."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE PATIENT WATCHER</h2>
<p>The telephone directory, however, failed to make any mention of Greencorn
Street, from which Ellis deduced the fact that it must be a very obscure
thoroughfare, so he had to go out and look up the house he wanted at the
nearest post office. He was not in the least surprised to find that Greencorn
Street was not very far off, and consisted more or less of a blind alley
leading from one of the dingy Wapping streets to the river, and terminating in
a derelict piece of ground which had once been the site of a series of
warehouses. But these had long been pulled down, and the ground on which they
had stood had been given over as a sort of play-ground and dumping area for the
neighbourhood. There was a wall of sorts round the desolate stretch of ground,
and a battered board proclaiming the fact that it was for sale. At the corner
of the road was a public house, apparently on its last legs, for the paint was
peeling off the walls, and the creaking doors were black and greasy from
contact with generations of unsavoury loafers. As Ellis passed down the road
three or four of these derelicts in a state of drooping melancholy were
propping up the wall of the public-house waiting patiently, no doubt, for some
more prosperous ally who might be moved to take them inside and give them the
beer for which their souls craved. They were the type of men who live in some
mysterious fashion without work, and whose one idea or paradise is to sit in a
reeking hostel with their feet in the sawdust and a pot of some stringent ale
in front of them. They lounged there, addressing no word to one another, and
eyed Ellis dejectedly as he passed. He knew at least two of them by name, and
nodded as he went along. One of them looked up with a sort of gleam of hope in
his rheumy eye before his head sank upon his breast again.</p>
<p>Ellis walked on, taking in his surroundings keenly. Beyond the public-house
was a fried-fish shop, and beyond that appeared two or three blocks of tenement
dwellings which obviously once had been warehouses. Then came another open
space, and, beyond that, a series of cabin-like habitations, for the most part
without roofs. He came at length to No. 17, which had evidently at some time
been a ship-chandler's shop on a small scale. It consisted of two stories with
a sort of workshop on one side, and a large ground-glass window abutting on the
piece of ground which some sanguine owner apparently hoped to sell one of these
days. So far as Ellis could see at a casual glance, and without stopping to
attract attention, the place was empty, for the windows, both upstairs and
down, were broken, and somebody had boarded up the front door with some rough
deal scantlings. To all appearances nobody had crossed the threshold for years.
On the other side of the road, as a marked contrast to this staggering
desolation, was a garage devoted to the repair of commercial lorries, and here
a good deal of activity was going on. But this was all the life and movement
that the street presented, so that when Ellis retraced his footsteps he was
little the wiser. Still, he was not going to let it go quite as easily as
that.</p>
<p>On a table in the sitting-room he found a telegram waiting him. It only
contained two or three words, and was unsigned, save for the solitary letter L.
It ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><i>"Evening Telephone</i> of to-day. Page 5.&mdash;L."</blockquote>
<p>This, as Ellis knew, came from Inspector Lock. It was curt and to the point,
but probably embodied all that the astute sender had to say. It was not a
difficult matter to walk as far as the Tower and purchase a copy of the paper,
with which he came back to his room a little later. He spread the sheet out,
and at once the big headlines caught his eye.</p><br>
<blockquote>ANOTHER GREAT COUP BY THE RIVER GANG. VAST HAUL OF
FURS.</blockquote>
<p>"Late last night a lighter was observed drifting down the Thames, having
apparently broken away from its moorings, thus constituting a danger with the
heavy traffic on the river. When this was boarded by the police patrol, the
four men on board, who had been left in charge, were discovered in what first
appeared to be a state of helpless intoxication. But after they had been
conveyed ashore, and the lighter secured to its moorings once again, the police
surgeon attached to the Thames Court certified to the effect that the men in
question were suffering from gas poisoning. The doctor was almost certain of
this fact, because he had had personal experience of the effects of gas during
three years in France. From what our representative could gather, the work had
been so thoroughly done as to endanger the lives of the unfortunate victims,
and, indeed, if they had not been promptly handled by one who was thoroughly
conversant with the effects of gas poisoning, not one of them would have lived
to tell the tale. But thanks to the assistance of other experts, the four men
were able to sit up in hospital this morning and tell an amazing story. It
appears that yesterday morning several hundred bales of almost priceless
Canadian furs were taken off the steamship <i>Princess Charming</i> below
Greenwich, and brought up to Limehouse Reach in the lighter <i>Firefly</i>,
having been consigned to Messrs. Eden &amp; Co. by their agents at Fort
William. We are informed that these furs, which do not take up much room in
comparison with their intrinsic value, were worth, in their rough state, about
twenty thousand pounds. As it was impossible to get them off the lighter before
Messrs. Eden's warehouses closed for the day, they were left on board, special
precautions being taken to ensure their safety. Three of the men on the lighter
are ex-constables connected with the river-police, and the fourth at one time
was foreman in the employ of the firm to whom the furs were consigned. They
were specially on the lookout for the gang of thieves who at present are
holding the whole river-side in terror, and they were armed. About eight
o'clock last night they were sitting down in the cabin with one of the three on
deck, when, without any sort of warning, they became aware of the fact that the
lighter was enveloped in what they deemed to be a sort of fog. Just as one of
them began to get suspicious, and to fancy that things were not quite as they
should be, they heard a muffled cry from the deck, followed by the fall of a
body. Before they could rush up the ladder they were overcome by the fumes of
what they had deemed to be an unusual type of fog, and, after that, they
recollected no more. When the police boarded the lighter, which had been cut
adrift from its moorings in some amazingly cunning way, it was found that the
whole of the cargo of furs had disappeared and, moreover, that the watchman who
had been on deck was bound and gagged.</p>
<p>"The watchman could give very little account of what had happened. He had
been seized from behind, and felled to the deck by a heavy blow, probably
delivered by a sandbag, on the back of his neck, after which he had been bound
and a gag thrust into his mouth. As he, too, was suffering from the effects of
gas poisoning, it is assumed that he was overpowered by the fumes rising from
the cabin as he lay insensible on the deck. One of the most extraordinary
features of the affair is the fact that the lighter had drifted quite a quarter
of a mile downstream without coming in contact with any other shipping. The
police were of opinion that the barge was cut out very quietly and towed
alongside some deserted wharf where the plunder was taken ashore and removed
presumably in motor-cars. At any rate, the four unfortunate men who were in
charge of the cargo seem to be just as mystified as everybody else. How the
poison-gas came into the cabin is a puzzle that is taxing the ingenuity of the
authorities to the uttermost. They are extremely reticent on the subject, but
are inclined to believe that the gas was smuggled on board by some confederate
and attached to an apparatus, probably some destructive acid in a tube which
was timed to eat away the cylinder and thus release the gas at what the thieves
knew to be the right moment. This, perhaps, is the greatest triumph these
audacious and daring thieves have so far achieved. Surely the police can do
something to put an end to these depredations which, erelong, will certainly
paralyse industry in the Port of London."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>There was a good deal more to this effect, mere journalese which did not
trouble Ellis in the slightest. At any rate, he knew now that the band of
desperadoes led on by Mark Gilmour had achieved another magnificent
<i>coup</i>. But it was one thing to know this, and quite another to prove it.
He had no doubt whatever that Mark Gilmour was the brain and the master mind
behind the greatest series of robberies that had ever taken place within three
miles of St. Paul's. Nor did he doubt that the big finance necessary to carry
the campaign through came from Mortimer Croot. And yet Ellis was no nearer a
practical solution than he had been on the day when he had first taken up his
residence in Wapping as a special commissioner of the <i>Telephone.</i> It
would be an easy matter to raise an alarm, and take such steps as would put a
stop to this sort of thing in the future, but that did not in the least appeal
to Mr. Jack Ellis. He wanted to wind the whole thing up in a blaze of glory,
and make his position sure in the journalistic world.</p>
<p>And there was another side of the question which touched him nearer still.
He was very much in love with Vera Croot, and she with him. The knowledge that
she was not really Vera Croot at all brought a certain amount of satisfaction,
but not enough to render him easy in his mind. He had not forgotten the polite
yet firm way in which Croot had forbidden him to come near the Moat House, nor
was he blind to the fact that he had a dangerous rival in Mark Gilmour. He
fairly tingled with anger as he thought of a beautiful innocent girl like Vera
more or less in the hands of those two scoundrels. She would have to be
disillusioned one of these days, and though the truth would come as a great
shock to her, Vera would have to know it. And yet that time was a long way
off.</p>
<p>It was all very well to be aware of the fact that Gilmour was leading those
amazingly clever criminals, but how to prove it? How to bring it right home so
that there could be no shadow of a doubt, and place those two men where they
ought to be? If Avory had only lived, then it might have been possible to
identify Gilmour with the naval officer who had once been his commander long
ago in the China Seas. All that Ellis had to confirm this was a photograph torn
from some unknown journal, and though it might be traced, it was certain to be
a long business. And as Ellis turned this over in his mind, he remembered the
visiting card which he had come upon in the little black box.</p>
<p>He took it up again and examined it carefully. Evidently the slip of
pasteboard had not been in the box long, because, unlike the rest of the
contents, which were yellow, and for the most part stained with sea water, it
was clean and smooth, with hardly a soil upon it. And, moreover, it had been on
the top of the box. It might be possible, therefore, that it had been handed
over to Avory just before his death, and the address written on it so that
there could be no mistake. It was more than probable that Avory had called at
17 Greencorn Street. It was more than possible, too, that he had met his death
there.</p>
<p>Ellis jumped to his feet as this idea occurred to him. Yes, in a lonely spot
behind the walls of that old house, with its broken windows and battered door,
a cold-blooded crime might have been committed. According to the card, the time
fixed for the meeting had been 8.30, which assuredly would not mean 8.30 in the
morning. At that time of night the garage at the other side of the road would
be silent, and the more Ellis thought over this the more sure he was that
something important was to be learnt at that sinister abode in Greencorn
Street. Somebody had evidently been using the place, or else that card would
never have been found.</p>
<p>Ellis drifted along presently, and paused at length before the dingy
public-house at the corner of the street in which now he was deeply interested.
The loafers were still propping up the wall, and as he passed he lifted his
finger to one of them. The man in question shot forward with some signs of life
about him.</p>
<p>"Do you want me, guv'nor?" he asked almost plaintively.</p>
<p>"I do, Blue Peter," Ellis said. "I suppose you would like to earn half a
crown? If you do as I tell you I will make it more. I might make it as much as
a quid."</p>
<p>"Lor' lumme, guv'nor," the man addressed as Blue Peter cried, with tears in
his voice. "I ain't touched a drop o' beer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, and you're not going to touch it now," Ellis said crisply. "I think you
know something about me, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you're the bloke wot writes for the pipers. Poor ole Bill Avory, 'e
told me abaht you."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right, Peter. But you don't get any money till you earn it.
Then you can drink yourself blind for all I care. I want you to watch that
house at the corner of the street, No. 17. I want you to watch it day and
night. Do you think you can manage to do that? If you can't you must get one of
your pals to, and I will make it worth his while."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll do it, guv'nor, Gor blime, many's the time I bin standin' 'ere
from when the pubs open in the mornin' till they close at night an' me never
stir. And if so be as I am called away, the Goat, or old Chiney, 'ere'll take
my place."</p>
<p>"Very well then. If you see anybody go into that house, wait till they come
out again, and follow them. Bring me a description of the man or men, and if
you can manage to run them down, let me know where they are to be found. Not a
cent in advance, mind."</p>
<p>Blue Peter nodded dismally. He would have much preferred a little something
on account, but with visions of a beery paradise opening up before his bleary
eyes, he set himself doggedly down to the task that lay before him.</p>
<p>He knew how to wait; he had been waiting for years, never very far away from
that familiar spot, and always within scent of the beer which was meat and
drink and earthly paradise to him. He waited until darkness fell, and then for
an hour or two crept off to the unsavoury kennel where he slept, and
occasionally ate such food as Providence threw in his way.</p>
<p>It was on the second afternoon that he shuffled along in the direction of
the street in which Ellis's lodgings were situated with hope in his eyes, and
more spring in his step than had been there for many a long year.</p>
<p>"I've got it, guv'nor," he said excitedly. "I seen 'im. 'E come dahn the
street abaht 'arf an hour ago, just as I was goin' to get a bit o' grub, and I
see 'im let 'imself aht o' number seventeen. I couldn't 'ave made no mistake,
becos it's the only 'ouse on that side. Then 'e walks along up the 'Igh Street
round by the Tower, an' me after 'im. Regular sort o' toff, 'e were. Then 'e
goes into a office in Great Bower Street, and I was done."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed? Whose office did he go into?"</p>
<p>"Name o' Verity &amp; Co," Blue Peter said hoarsely. "And now, guv'nor, do
you think I've earned me money?"</p>
<p>"That remains to be seen, Peter," Ellis laughed. "But at any rate, I am
going to give it you all the same."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV&mdash;BEHIND THE DOOR</h2>
<p>A shadow emerged out of the gloom and crept across the strip of no man's
land alongside the ruined house at the corner of Greencorn Street. This was
some eight and forty hours more or less before Ellis had been intrigued by
certain facts which he had picked up from the columns of his own paper, after
he had received the telegram from his friend and ally, Inspector Lock.</p>
<p>It was a dark night, with a thin rain falling, and some suggestion of a fog
creeping up from the river. The figure crossing the open space worked along
with the greatest caution until he came at length to the boarded-up entrance to
the Greencorn Street house, and looking round to assure himself that he was
absolutely alone he took a key from his pocket and inserted it in what appeared
to be a crack between the rough scantlings with which the door was barricaded.
Then the whole boarded space slid back noiselessly, disclosing nothing but a
black darkness beyond. Then, as if by magic, the door dropped back, and the
interior was flooded with light. Here was a passage leading to a good-sized
room behind, which seemed to be empty, except for a large deal table, and two
or three chairs.Doubtless, all the windows were closely shuttered, for the intruder moved about quite boldly, as if absolutely assured of his ground. He took off his
slouch hat and the overcoat in which he was muffled to his eyebrows, and
disclosed the features of Mark Gilmour.</p>
<p>He seemed to be waiting for somebody, for his air was alert, and his ears
evidently were tuned to listening, until there came a sort of scraping from
somewhere outside, then he turned out the light again and crept along the
passage. Some one whispered outside, and the door was opened to admit another
man who stood presently in the room at the back confronting Gilmour. This was
his tool and slave, Joe Airey, the man who had been with him on the night when
they had so narrowly escaped capture at the hands of the Thames police. Airey
looked up into the face of his chief with a certain suggestion of sullen fear
in his eyes. He had evidently been in great dread of the other.</p>
<p>"Well, here you are, Joe," Gilmour said. "Now, have you got all those facts
I asked you about? Where were you last night?"</p>
<p>"In bed," Airey muttered. "Touch of the old trouble, sir."</p>
<p>"That's a lie," Gilmour said coldly. "You were down at Limehouse with some
of your friends, and by ten o'clock you were so drunk that they had to take you
home. I have warned you about that before. You can't do anything without my
knowing about it, and the sooner you realize that the better. If this happens
again you will find yourself in the hands of the police, and you know what that
means. Five years if a day, and you will never know who struck you. You
infernal fool."</p>
<p>Airey shot a glance of cold hate under his eyebrows at the speaker. He was
absolutely under Gilmour's thumb, and he knew it. The bread he ate, and the
beer he drank, and even the liberty he enjoyed lay in the hollow of Gilmour's
hands. But at that moment the latter stood in peril, had he only known it.</p>
<p>"What a cold-blooded devil you are," Airey muttered. "Some day I shall break
out and do you a mischief."</p>
<p>"Why not do it now?" Gilmour asked coldly. "You will never have a better
chance. We are absolutely alone here, and there isn't a soul in the world
besides ourselves who knows the secret of 17 Greencorn Street. You are a better
man than I am physically, despite the amount of beer you drink, and if you left
me for dead here I might not be found for years. But you are afraid, Joe, you
are afraid, and you know it."</p>
<p>Airey made no reply. It was exactly as Gilmour had said&mdash;he was afraid,
in deadly fear of the cold-blooded man opposite who would have sent him to the
gallows without the least compunction had it suited his purpose to do so.</p>
<p>"Who brought you here?" Gilmour went on. "Who dug you out of a Canadian
jail? Who paid your passage back to England and set you on your legs again? You
needn't answer the questions unless you like, but so long as you are in my
employ, you shall do exactly as I tell you. If you get drunk again you will get
no further mercy from me. Sit down, you rascal."</p>
<p>The big powerful man who feared nothing on earth except his tormentor
subsided meekly into a chair.</p>
<p>"Ah, that is better," Gilmour went on. "Help yourself to a cigarette. Now
tell me all about it."</p>
<p>"Well, it's like this, sir," Airey replied. "The <i>Princess Charming</i> is
down the river at the present moment with the stuff on board. The bales will be
transferred to the lighter <i>Firefly</i> some time tomorrow, and be brought up
the river opposite the long wharf waiting the instructions of Eden &amp; Co. I
got all that this morning. It isn't a big lot to handle, but it is worth more
than its weight in gold. Canadian furs, it is."</p>
<p>"Now, that exactly tallies with my information," Gilmour smiled. "A fine lot,
Joe, a very fine lot indeed. And if you are quite sure of your ground, we shall
have the lot before eight and forty hours are over our heads. Who is looking
after the stuff?"</p>
<p>"There will be four men on the lighter, sir," Airey explained. "Four good
men, too. They ain't taking no risks this time. I know them chaps. Real hot
stuff, the whole gang of 'em. If it comes to a fight, we'll get the worst of
it."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose we should," Gilmour laughed. "But we don't fight with their
weapons, Joe, and that's where we have 'em by the neck. When it comes to a case
of brains <i>versus</i> muscle, brains has it every time. Now, if you have
found out exactly where that lighter is going to tie up, the thing is as good
as done."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can take you right to the spot when the time comes," Airey said
confidentially. "What happens afterwards will be for you to decide, sir, but I
can take you to the lighter, and I can show you the hatch under which the stuff
is stowed. But if it comes to a scrap between us&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is going to be no scrap," Gilmour said impatiently. "I have a much
better plan than that. There is no reason why you and I shouldn't do the whole
thing between us. There is a new boat, a little better and faster than the old
one, waiting for us in the secret dock under Crombies Wharf, and the other part
of the contract I have in here."</p>
<p>With that, Gilmour rose and, crossing the room, touched a secret spring
concealed under the ragged rotting wall-paper, and immediately a section of the
room slid away, leaving a cavity some eight feet square disclosed to the view.
Inside this there seemed to be something shining dully, and as Gilmour turned
on a switch, the regular purr of machinery commenced to hum. It moved smoothly
and noiselessly, and made little more noise than a bee makes when it is poised
above a bed of flowers. Airey moved forward and stretched out his hand as if to
touch the dynamo.</p>
<p>"Here, drop that," Gilmour cried. "The wires are not insulated. There are
two thousand volts alternating current there, drawn from the main cable that
runs along the street. I managed to tap that with the help of a man who owed me
a good turn, and the Electric Lighting Company little know that I have been
drawing on their power. If you touch that parallel wire you are a dead man in
the fraction of a second. I am going to show you something, Joe, something you
never dreamt of."</p>
<p>From somewhere in the recesses of the hiding-place Gilmour produced a
section of steel cable, such as is used for the mooring of ships. He laid this
on the deal table in the full light of the lamp, and then by its side placed a
small instrument in a neat little case no larger than a cigar box. When this
was opened, it disclosed a small steel disk with sharp edges, something like a
miniature circular saw. Two tiny wires were attached to the dynamo, and the saw
began to revolve so rapidly that the human eye was not capable of following the
revolutions.</p>
<p>"Now, look here," Gilmour said. "I just touch the end of this saw to the
cable, and it is severed."</p>
<p>It was just as he said, the inch cable lay in two pieces on the table, and
all that without the slightest sound.</p>
<p>"Now, I can store the little battery in the box, with enough power to cut
three or four cables like that, and you can see for yourself that there is not
the slightest noise. I can carry the whole thing in my pocket, so when the time
comes and we make our raid on the <i>Firefly</i> we shall be able to cut her
out, despite her hawsers, and warp her over to our wharf without the men on
board being any the wiser. That is a neat little invention of my own, Joe, and
one I worked out when I was an engineer-lieutenant in the Navy. What do you
think of it?"</p>
<p>"It's a fair knock out," Joe said admiringly. "But you don't think, sir, as
those chaps on board the <i>Firefly</i> will be sitting down in the cabin all
night, do you? They are pretty sure to have one on deck, anyway."</p>
<p>"Very likely. Not that it makes the least difference. They will probably
have one on sentry duty, and the others in the cabin, and they will be armed,
of course, which will make them all the more confident and careless. But you
can take it from me, Joe, that not one of the chaps below deck will ever know
what stung them until it is hours too late, because that little idea is only
one of my stunts. There is another, and a far better one than that. We'll come
to it in good time."</p>
<p>"Yes, wasn't there something you wanted me to smuggle on board the
<i>Firefly</i>?" Joe asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right. But are you sure you can manage it?"</p>
<p>"Lord bless your soul, sir, it will be as easy as falling off a house. I
shall be helping to unload the <i>Princess Charming,</i> and consequently no
one will take much notice of me. And even if I can't manage it, there's two
chaps down yonder ready to do most anything for a quid apiece, not as I means
to trust 'em unless something happens as is unforeseen. But what do you want me
to do, sir?"</p>
<p>By way of reply, Gilmour produced from the darkness of the cupboard a black
cylinder some two inches in diameter and about a foot long. This had a sort of
tap at one end, and was obviously some form of gas apparatus.</p>
<p>"Lift it up," Gilmour said. "It is not dangerous; at least, not at present.
I suppose you could carry that without the slightest trouble, couldn't
you?"</p>
<p>Airey smiled at the question. In his powerful hands the cylinder was not
much more than a featherweight.</p>
<p>"That will be all right, sir," he said. "I could carry that in my waistcoat
pocket almost. If you was to wrap it up in a bit of canvas it would pass quite
easy for seaman's kit."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's just what I thought," Gilmour said. "Now, I want you to take
that when I have quite finished with it and place it in some inconspicuous
place in the cabin of the <i>Firefly.</i> You can drop it down behind one of
the bulkheads, or shove it in the back of a locker. Anywhere where it is not
likely to be noticed. And when you have done that, you can go about your
business as if nothing had happened, and you need not worry yourself any more
till you join me at Crombies Wharf when the right time comes. But there is
something to be done first. Sit down and smoke your cigarette, Joe, and don't
speak to me till I speak to you."</p>
<p>From a drawer in the table Gilmour produced some pages of loose paper
covered with what appeared to be mathematical calculations. There were thin
spidery-looking diagrams too, and here and there a scrap of white lines on
azure which were evidently part of what engineers would call a blue print. For
the best part of an hour Gilmour bent over these with knotted brows, and his
whole mind concentrated upon the figures before him. He went over these again
and again, until he was absolutely satisfied that he had got everything correct
to the minutest detail.</p>
<p>"Yes, I think that must be all right," he muttered, half to himself. "About
thirty hours to the minute I should say. Joe, this is going to be a big thing."</p>
<p>Airey grinned. The bigger thing it was, the better it would be for himself. His
share of the plunder was an infinitesimal one, but he fully appreciated the
value of working upon a percentage basis, and at such times as there was no
prospective raid in view he was permitted to do pretty well as he liked, and
scatter his ill-gotten gains with a lavishness that generally accompanies the
possession of money acquired dishonestly.</p>
<p>"So far, so good, Joe," Gilmour said with unusual good humour. "And now we
will proceed to make the thing complete."</p>
<p>Diving once more into the hollow in which the dynamo lay concealed, Gilmour
produced a small metal flask, something like a Thermos, only with the centre of
it cut out, forming a hollow core, and this he slipped over the shoulder of the
cylinder and clasped it firmly in its place with a number of metal wedges.
Evidently the flask had been constructed on purpose, and though Airey was
unaware of the fact, had been manufactured in the deserted house by Gilmour
himself, aided by the dynamo and a small lathe that lay compact in the secret
recess.</p>
<p>"You see this, Joe," Gilmour said. "This is a gas cylinder fully charged.
When I file off the cock, which I shall do presently, because it is only in the
way&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Eh, what's that, sir?" Airey said, a little uneasily. "You promised me as
there should be no violence."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Gilmour said impatiently. "Do you suppose I want to
murder those chaps?"</p>
<p>Airey looked up sullenly. He knew perfectly well that Gilmour would not
stick at that even, if he could not see his way to get what he wanted
otherwise.</p>
<p>"That's all very well, guv'nor," he said. "But what about poor old Bill
Avory? I don't want to sile me 'ands&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Drop it," Gilmour said sternly. "Do you mean to say that you accuse me of
having anything to do with Avory's death?"</p>
<p>"Well, I won't go so far as to say that, sir," Airey muttered, with some
show of apology. "But Bill's dead, and from all accounts he died just at the
right time for some people. Not as I had anything to do with it, thank the
Lord. But if you tell me, sir, as it's all right, I am ready to go on. But I
know something about gas. There's a bloke working near me in the docks as
caught it proper in France, and that's over three year ago. He'll never be the
same man again."</p>
<p>"My good ass," Gilmour said with a certain patient tolerance, "there is gas
and gas. There is what they give you when you have a tooth out, and there is
the sort that will put a man to sleep for two or three hours and leave him none
the worse for it. And that's what is inside the cylinder."</p>
<p>"But how do you loose it off, sir? Mean to say as some one's got to go down
in the cabin and turn on the cock?"</p>
<p>"I have a much better idea than that," Gilmour said. "A sort of automatic
arrangement. Timed to work almost to a nicety. There is nothing for you to
worry about, Joe; all you have to do is to obey me and leave the rest
to&mdash;er&mdash;Providence, as the bishop said in the story."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;DOWN THE RIVER</h2>
<p>Airey's scruples seemed to be satisfied, for he said no more. He was quite
content to sit there smoking a cigarette and watching Gilmour complete his
preparations. This consisted mainly in filing away the stopcock to the
cylinder, and strengthening the weak part with a solution of fluxite. When this
was at length accomplished the cylinder was wrapped up in a piece of sacking,
and placed under Airey's arms. Half an hour later he was walking down the
street with it, until at length he came to the nearest "Underground," and finally
emerged into the open at Limehouse. He had his instructions. He was to send a
telegram couched in certain words to Gilmour at his flat as soon as he had
succeeded in secreting the cylinder somewhere in the cabin of the
<i>Firefly,</i> and he was to be at a certain spot in the neighbourhood of
Crombies Wharf at nine o'clock on the following night.</p>
<p>The telegram reached Gilmour when he was dining in his neat little flat, and
he smiled to himself as he read the two or three carefully thought out words
that constituted the message. He had still an hour or two before him in which
to make his preparations and carefully cover his tracks in case anything went
wrong. When he had finished his meal, and his elderly housekeeper came in with
the coffee, he turned to her with a smile.</p>
<p>"I may be going out presently," he said. "If I do, and anybody rings me up,
ask for me on the telephone at my club. That is, of course, if I do go out.
It's not at all a pleasant night, and I should much prefer to sit here over the
fire with a book. But then, you see, we business men are never quite our own
masters. If you don't hear me moving in an hour's time, you will know that I am
not going out at all. I have had such a heavy day that I almost think I will
take risks and go to bed."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," the housekeeper said. "In that case, you won't want to be
disturbed."</p>
<p>"That is exactly what I mean," Gilmour smiled. "No, I shan't want anything.
That will do for the present."</p>
<p>The housekeeper cleared the table with the exception of the coffee cup, and
retired to her own quarters. Gilmour sat there for a little time, a neat trim
figure in his dinner suit, and smoked a couple of cigarettes before he looked
at the clock and realized it was just after eight. Then, very softly, he crept
along the passage to his bedroom and closed the door behind him. Once inside,
he made a rapid change in his toilet, dressing himself in a shabby suit of grey
tweeds, and placing an old golf cap on the back of his head. Then he opened the
door and looked out into the corridor.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Harris," he called. "I have changed my mind. I am so infernally tired
that I am going to bed. If anybody rings me up on the telephone will you kindly
tell them so?"</p>
<p>The housekeeper suitably responded from the kitchen without showing up at
all, and Gilmour noisily closed the door of the bedroom. But he was not inside
it, he was creeping like a cat along the corridor until he came to the front
door, which he opened as silently as if he had been some astute burglar. Then,
once outside, he clicked the latch as silently, and, assuring himself that his
latchkey was in his pocket, walked down the stone stairway without troubling
the man in charge of the lift.</p>
<p>He was fairly safe now, and all the more so because his bedroom door
fastened with a safety catch, and unless something out of the common happened,
he would be back home again and safe in bed in circumstances which would enable
his landlady to declare to anybody that he had not left the flat after dinner. He
managed to reach the street without encountering a soul. It was an easy matter
after that to strike the Underground Railway and emerge in the course of time
at Mark Lane station. He was taking no risks. He might have gone still farther,
to Wapping, but no one would recognize him at Mark Lane, and from thence to
Tower Hill was only a matter of a few minutes' walk. He arrived at length
outside the offices of Verity &amp; Co. in Great Bower Street, which
thoroughfare was absolutely deserted now, so that there was no risk whatever in
entering the building, which he proceeded to do with the aid of his latchkey
and a box of matches in his pocket.</p>
<p>There was no chance of a light showing down in the basement, and here he
switched on the electrics. He pulled aside the hidden stone on the floor and,
almost as soon as he had done so, the rough unkempt head of Joe Airey
appeared.</p>
<p>"Ah, here you are then," Gilmour said. "I thought you would be in time
to-night. That is one of the advantages of being short of money, Joe. It makes
you eager to get some more; and, moreover, it keeps you off the drink, my lad.
Now, there is no hurry. Get out the whisky and soda, and we will sit down and
talk for half an hour. But only one drink, mind. When we get back here after
the business is finished you can take a bottle home with you if you like.
You'll find the corkscrew in the drawer."</p>
<p>Airey helped himself to a liberal portion of whisky and passed the bottle
over to his companion. Then he began to talk.</p>
<p>"It's quite all right, sir," he said. "I told you it would be. I made some
excuse to get aboard the <i>Firefly</i> when they were loading up the stuff,
and under one arm I carried a bale, and under the other the tube of stuff
wrapped up in a bit of old sack. I misses my footing, I does, and down the
hatchway I tumbles, taking care to tumble the right way up, and afore anybody
knew anything had happened, I was back on deck again."</p>
<p>"Ah, then I suppose there was nobody in the cabin?"</p>
<p>"Not at that time in the morning there weren't, sir, so I shoves the stuff
in the back of one of the lockers, and covers it over with a bit of newspaper.
And then I gets on deck, and they asks me as if I'd hurt myself, and I just
laughs. And I can tell you something also. I knows exactly where that stuff's
to be found. In the fore-hatch. And you wouldn't guess as it was furs, because
they've sort of doped them bales. But I keeps my eyes open, and I knows where
to put me hand on the stuff, I do."</p>
<p>"And then you sheered off, I suppose?" Gilmour asked.</p>
<p>Airey chuckled to himself as he took a long pull at his whisky and soda.
Evidently something was amusing him.</p>
<p>"Well, in a manner of speaking, yes," he said. "But not for very long. I
goes back there just before dark and I sees the lighter being warped back into
the stream. There was another one going up behind, in charge of two chaps what
I know, and I asked 'em to give me a lift, because I wanted to get higher up
the river. And, of course, they does it, not suspecting anything. So I hangs
about on their boat, offering to take 'em ashore and do 'em proud when they've
got their warp out, and they wasn't half ready, neither. So, standing on the
deck and smoking my pipe, I sees where the <i>Firefly's</i> moored up to a
inch. Lord bless you sir, I could take you to it blindfold."</p>
<p>"You have done very well, Joe, very well indeed," Gilmour said. "And you can
rely upon me not to forget it when the time to share out comes. Now, what about
those men on board the <i>Firefly</i>?"</p>
<p>"Just as I told you, sir," Airey replied. "There's four of them, and they
ain't the sort o' chaps to take any sort of trouble lying down. Besides, they
are picked entirely because they have got a valuable cargo, and are half
expecting trouble of some sort. There isn't one of 'em who wasn't in the R.N.R.
during the war pottering about the North Sea mine-sweeping and submarine
hunting, and I tell you they know every move in the game. You and I have been
up against one or two pretty tough propositions together, guv'nor, but never
one quite so tough as this. And if it does come to a scrap, we shan't 'ave a
dog's chance."</p>
<p>Gilmour smiled grimly. The suggestion of a hand to hand encounter troubled
him not at all. It had never been part of his policy to run risks of that kind.
There was something very crude and primitive about violence, to say nothing of
the personal risk, and a touch of tactics beat it every time.</p>
<p>"You need not have the least anxiety about that," he said. "We are not even
going to see those chaps, at least, only from a safe distance. The secret of
our success up to now has been mainly due to the fact that nobody has the least
idea who we are. We have never been in contact with our opponents&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, we have, guv'nor," Airey pointed out. "What about that night on the
barge when we run into Bill Avory, and he spotted you for an old acquaintance
of his?"</p>
<p>"Oh, why do you keep on reminding me of the man?" Gilmour asked. "He is out
of the way now, anyhow. Now, come along, I don't want to be talking here all
night."</p>
<p>"My word, there ain't all that hurry," Airey growled. "We can't get off till
the tide's right, and that will be quite another three-quarters of an
hour."</p>
<p>They passed presently through the trap door leading to the passage below,
and made their way along that dark and forbidding drain with its slimy walls
and the oily moisture dripping in huge drops from the ceiling, until they came
at length to the stagnant pool of water beneath the ruined building on
Crombie's Wharf. Here was the new boat that Gilmour had spoken of.</p>
<p>"The very last word," he explained. "It was built for coast service to a new
design, and just too late to be used in the war. I got it cheap, and it only
arrived yesterday. You can take it all to pieces and carry it on a man's back.
It came here by rail, and I put it together last night. There is a kind of well
in the centre in which a couple of men can hide, and if there is any trouble
the sides can be flattened so that it lies on the surface of a smooth stream
only showing a couple of inches of gunwale. Why, on a fairly dark night a
police-boat would pass it a dozen yards away without being any the wiser. And
if they did see it, they would only take it for a bit of floating
wreckage."</p>
<p>"That's a bit of all right, guv'nor," Airey said approvingly. "If you have
only got an engine to match&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, we've an engine to match right enough," Gilmour smiled. "Absolutely
dead silent. That is what the designer was working on for two years, a boat
that would float on the level of the water, with an engine that made no noise
whatever. And there she is. What do you think of her?"</p>
<p>Airey responded luridly enough. He could see that when the boat was in
proper trim, she would be large enough to handle a fair amount of cargo. For
the next half hour or so they were busy on the boat, Gilmour explaining the
mechanism, until Airey thoroughly understood all there was to be known about
her.</p>
<p>"She's a real beauty," he burst out enthusiastically. "What would the old
man say if he could only see her?"</p>
<p>"What old man are you talking about?" Gilmour asked coldly.</p>
<p>"Why, the boss, of course. Old man Croot. Don't he take any sort of interest
in these little games of ours?"</p>
<p>"What, are you under the impression that Mr. Croot knows anything at all
about it?" Gilmour asked. "If that is so, the sooner you get that idea out of
your thick head the better. Mr. Croot is far too big a man to soil his fingers
with this sort of thing. If it hadn't been for him, we could never have started
on this sort of business. He doesn't even know about the underground passage.
He is just a respectable man of business, and is quite content to make his
money legitimately, and because that is so, no sort of suspicion attaches to
me. I have worked it all out myself. It's my idea entirely, and because I am
Mr. Croot's manager, and know all about the books and superintend the
correspondence, I am in a position to know exactly where I can put my hand on
the stuff that I want. But where you got the idea from that Mr. Croot knew
anything about this matter, I can't understand."</p>
<p>"Well, upon my word, guv'nor, you are a bit of a masterpiece," Airey cried.
"You must be a wonder to be able to run all this off your own bat."</p>
<p>Gilmour smiled with an air of superiority. He liked to mystify this raw
assistant of his, and pose before him as a sort of superman to whom nothing
came amiss. And assuredly he had done so. It had always been an understood
thing between Croot and himself that the former was to be shielded at any cost,
and up to now he had carried out his part of the bargain. If anything
unforeseen happened, and Gilmour found himself in the hands of the law, it
would be no bad thing for him to know that Croot had been held blameless,
because in that case there would come a time in the future when he could go to
Croot and recover his share of the plunder. Up to now, Croot had handled most
of the proceeds of the robberies, and had invested them in his own name,
Gilmour taking just what he wanted for personal expenses. Therefore, if a cruel
Fate landed him sooner or later in jail, there would be no awkward questions
asked as to what he had done with the money; and, in course of time, he would
be able to turn his back on the old country with the comfortable assurance that
his future was provided for. Therefore, come what may, he was not going to
betray his employer. Nor had Croot any fear of this, so long as he held the
purse-strings. He financed all the schemes, and took a rigid account of
Gilmour's stewardship. But never, since the series of robberies first
commenced, had he ever been down in the basement of the offices in Great Bower
Street. He was not even going to take that risk.</p>
<p>There were moments when Gilmour reflected bitterly upon the fact that he was
risking his liberty almost daily without the slightest danger to the man behind
him. But then Gilmour had sense enough to see how he benefited by the
arrangement.</p>
<p>"Did you ever speak to Mr. Croot?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No, I ain't, guv'nor," Joe replied. "Of course, I knows him by sight, but
that's about all. Lord, 'e must be green."</p>
<p>"I don't think I should call him that," Gilmour smiled to himself. "He is an
excellent man of business, and quite a good employer, but he is certainly not
green. You see, Joe, he trusts me implicitly, and so far as the legitimate
business is concerned, he hasn't any reason to regret it. Still, I am glad we
have had this little conversation, because some day you might run up against
Mr. Croot, and perhaps in one of your breezy moments you might drop something
that you would be sorry for afterwards. But come along, it must be time now to
get a move on."</p>
<p>Airey consulted an old-fashioned silver watch that he wore, and announced
that the tide would serve. They pushed the boat along across the pool of water,
and then very carefully the screen at the end of the vault was raised, and the
boat slid out into a deep slipway along the side of the wharf, and thence with
infinite caution out on to the face of the river.</p>
<p>It was very dark, with fitful gusts of wind blowing ever and again, and a
thin curtain of rain was falling. But dark as it was, the black alleyway held
no terrors for Airey, who took the wheel in his hand and steered into the
throat of it as if he had been a cat, or as if it were broad daylight. Then
suddenly he brought the boat round, and sat up listening intently.</p>
<p>"There she is, guv'nor," he whispered.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE LATCHKEY</h2>
<p>Something big and broad loomed out of the darkness, and as his eyes became
accustomed to the thick murk, Gilmour could make out a shadowy outline that
presently resolved itself into a barge. She was rather a large craft for her
kind, and, so far as Gilmour could see, she was riding at anchor at the end of
a string of barges which were looped to one another with hawsers. Then, very
quietly, the motor-boat stole under the counter of the barge, and lay there,
scraping her sides on the swell of the tide so that it was possible to hold on
by the ladder and listen to what was going on.</p>
<p>Gilmour thrust his hand in his waistcoat pocket and produced a watch with a
luminous face. It was just on ten o'clock by the tell-tale hands, and Gilmour
made a rapid calculation in his head. There was half an hour or more to wait
yet, by the end of which time Gilmour reckoned that things would be
sufficiently advanced in the cabin of the lighter for him and his companion to
set about their work without any fear from any of those on board, or of
hindrance from a passing police patrol.</p>
<p>"What's she anchored up to, Joe?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right, guv'nor," Airey whispered. "She is at the end of a
string of barges, and fastened up to the rest with a couple of half-inch steel
hawsers. Can't you feel how light she is riding? If we had that little
instrument of yours&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, we've that right enough," Gilmour said under his breath. "It's in the
pocket of my coat, all ready charged. We will snip those hawsers when the time
comes, and warp her across the stream into the slipway. Once we have done that,
we shall be able to transfer the cargo to this little craft of ours, and run
her back under the curtain again. That is, after we have shoved off the lighter
to drift downstream. She may get cut in two on the way, but we can't afford to
be particular about that. Can you hear anything?"</p>
<p>Airey listened intently. He could make out presently that there was somebody
moving about on the deck of the lighter. He could hear the shuffling of feet,
and catch the smell of some strong tobacco which evidently the watchman on deck
was smoking. Then the unseen man whistled a few bars of a popular song, and
lapsed into silence again. Two or three minutes later there was the sound of
machinery somewhere, and then the sudden flashing of a light about three
cables' length away.</p>
<p>"The police patrol," Airey whispered hoarsely. "They will be on top of us in
a minute, guv'nor. And if they happen to spot us hanging on to this 'ere barge
like a barnacle, then it is going to be pretty unhealthy for us."</p>
<p>Gilmour reached out his hand, and apparently touched a lever somewhere, for
instantly the motor-boat commenced to flatten out until she was just flush with
the water. Airey was dragged down into a sort of well, which had suddenly come
out of nowhere, and he and Gilmour lay hidden till the police boat was just
alongside. Then the circular beam of light shot out again, until the whole of
the barge was focused in its rays.</p>
<p>"All right up there?" a voice asked. "Nothing wrong so far? I thought I
would give you a hail."</p>
<p>"Oh, we're O.K., Mr. Andrews," the watchman replied cheerfully. "No occasion
for you to worry about us."</p>
<p>"Well, I like your spirit. But don't be too cocksure, my friend. You're a
hot lot, I know, but you are up against something big to-night. I was told to
keep an eye on you, and I mean to do so. I'll be back in the course of an hour
or so, when I will give you another hail."</p>
<p>The light went out as suddenly as it had come, leaving a blacker darkness
behind it. Joe Airey, in the well under the boat, broke out in blasphemous
whispers in praise of this last scientific method of throwing dust in the eyes
of the authorities.</p>
<p>"Well, if that doesn't take the cake," he muttered. "They must have been
within ten yards of us, guv'nor. And they didn't know nothing about it. Well,
we know where we are now. We are safe till after eleven o'clock."</p>
<p>"Which is about as much time as we want," Gilmour said. "Another quarter of
an hour, and we ought to be on board. I've a great mind to have a shot at it
myself. Those three men in the cabin are as good as done for, but I am not
quite so sure about the man on deck. If he would join them below, all well and
good, but as long as he sticks up there, there is just the oft-chance that he
will smell a rat and give the alarm."</p>
<p>"Be careful, guv'nor," Airey said.</p>
<p>But Gilmour was already cautiously climbing the ladder. As he reached the
deck with his head in the air, and his nose sniffing the breeze, there came a
whiff of something pungent and acrid that set all his pulses tingling. He crept
noiselessly across the deck, closely followed by Airey in the direction of a
dim human outline leaning against a bulwark, and smoking a pipe, the bowl of
which was glowing freely in the wind. Then the smoker turned as if conscious of
unseen danger, and his pipe fell to the deck. He faced round to find himself
confronting Airey, who reached for his throat and grasped it before the watcher
could utter a warning cry to his companions below. Like a flash Gilmour was
behind him; something heavy and flexible struck the unfortunate man at the base
of the skull, and he dropped to his knees, utterly unconscious of what had
happened.</p>
<p>In a few seconds he was carefully trussed and a gag thrust into his mouth.
Without a word Gilmour laid his hand upon Airey's shoulder, and drew him back
in the direction of the ladder, down which they went into the boat again. As
they reached the motor in silence, the strange pungent odour struck once more
on Gilmour's nostrils. He sat up listening rigidly for five minutes, then he
drew a long deep breath and dropped back into his seat again with the air of a
man who is absolutely satisfied.</p>
<p>"So that's that," he snapped. "It's all right now, Joe; provided we are not
interrupted, we'll have every bale of that stuff under Crombies Wharf before
midnight. It isn't safe to go on board the lighter again yet, but with this
breeze blowing we might venture a little farther in half an hour's time."</p>
<p>"But won't they be all right again by that time, sir?"</p>
<p>"Lord bless you, no," Gilmour said. "If they come to their senses by
breakfast time to-morrow morning they will be well out of it. And you needn't
wriggle about like that, Joe; it isn't going to be a hanging matter. I have
experimented with the stuff too often for that. Those chaps will have fearful
heads when they wake, and they won't be much use for the next few days, but
nothing worse than that. Now, you just sit quietly down and keep your eyes open
till I give you the word."</p>
<p>Twenty minutes crept along in leaden seconds before Gilmour sprang to his
feet and made his way on to the deck of the lighter again. A spot of light from
the electric torch showed the unfortunate watchman lying on his back with his
eyes dosed, and apparently in a deep slumber.</p>
<p>"Well, upon my word, that's lucky," Gilmour chuckled. "Hang me if he isn't
gassed too. He must have had a good whiff of the stuff as it came up the
hatchway. Now come on, but you'd better cover your mouth and nostrils with your
handkerchief."</p>
<p>They went together down the hatchway into the little cabin, where they found
the three men snoring stertorously on the floor in various abandoned attitudes.
The atmosphere was clear enough now, and it was possible to breathe freely
without artificial aid. When the portholes were opened and the breeze allowed
full play, five minutes sufficed to rid the whole lighter of any suggestion of
poison gas. The work had been accomplished without the slightest hitch, and
Gilmour grinned triumphantly.</p>
<p>"You did your share of the work all right, Joe," he said. "And I won't
forget it. You had better take that cylinder from its hiding-place and drop it
quietly overboard. We will set the police guessing. Of course they will tumble
to the fact that the men have been gassed, but it's any odds they never find
out how."</p>
<p>A few minutes later the little electric saw did its share of the business
without the slightest noise, and by the time Gilmour and his companion were
back in the motor-boat again the lighter was adrift. But the tide was slack
now, so that it was an easy matter to warp the barge round and coax her across
the river until her bow was in the slipway and the precious bundles of fur
transferred to the deck of the motor. Twenty minutes later, the barge was
blundering headlong down the river, and five minutes after that the motor-boat
was safely hidden behind the screen, and her precious cargo conveyed to a place
of safety. Gilmour smiled happily.</p>
<p>"And a very good night's work too," he said. "A long way the best we have
ever had. Now, Joe, you see the advantage of running these sort of things with
not too many hands. Just you and me, and George, with his motor-lorry and
taxi-cab, and that's about all. You do all the heavy stuff and I find a market
for the goods when they come into our possession. I know one or two of these
gangs work in dozens, but what's the consequence? They are all picked up sooner
or later, like Morton's lot were last summer. But they were a clumsy crew and
their methods out of date, whereas with our combination we can strike just when
and where we like, and keep the police guessing."</p>
<p>"Aye, you are a fair wonder, you are, guv'nor," Joe said. "There is nothing
like brains after all. I suppose I had better be gettin' back now. Do you think
another drink would hurt me?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think it would. To tell you the truth, Joe, I feel a bit that
way myself. I don't care what you have so long as you get home sober. Your
money will reach you in the usual way within the next couple of days, and then
you can take a few weeks holiday. I shan't want you again for a month,
anyhow."</p>
<p>Joe Airey slid out presently through the front door of the dingy old office
in Great Bower Street, and was speedily lost under cover of the night. He had
done an excellent evening's work for himself, he would be the happy recipient
of a hundred pounds within the next eight and forty hours, and best of all from
his point of view, there would be no occasion for him to have to put any
restraint on himself for some considerable time. He was going to enjoy his
holiday with money in his pocket and not a care in the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gilmour sat in his office with the light turned on and certain
ledgers and documents before him which he had taken from a safe concealed in
one of the walls. There were shutters to the windows, so that not a ray of
light escaped, and he was therefore free to work as long as he liked without
fear of interruption. He wrote several letters on his typewriter, and these he
copied and folded away into envelopes which were already addressed. Then they
were stamped and placed in his pocket to be deposited in the first pillar box
he came to on his way home.</p>
<p>He knew exactly what to do with the evening's ill-gotten gains. They would
be brought secretly from their underground hiding-place, under Crombies Wharf,
and shipped to their first destination on the motor-lorry belonging to the
third member of the gang, the man who had driven him in a taxi-cab to Cray on
the night which had nearly ended in absolute disaster. Then they would be
transhipped by a firm that bought them in all good faith, to somewhere on the
Continent, where they would be dressed and treated, and gradually absorbed in
the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>Gilmour put all his materials away at length, closed the safe and stretched
himself wearily. It had been rather a trying evening, and he was feeling the
strain of it now. He snapped off the lights and crept out into the road, having
first assured himself that there was nobody in sight. It was too late now to
think of going back by train, and there was a certain amount of danger in
taking a taxi. Gilmour always avoided risks if he could, and besides, his
present garb, stained and wet, to say nothing of his face, black and grimy, was
not precisely calculated to appeal to any taxi-driver, especially when it was
coupled with instructions to drive to a certain block of flats in the
neighbourhood of the British Museum.</p>
<p>"I had better walk," Gilmour said to himself. "It is a rotten long way, and
I am infernally tired. But still it would be a pity to spoil a night like this
by some foolish carelessness."</p>
<p>He plodded on doggedly until at length he reached his destination, and
walked into the big square hall, knowing perfectly well that at such an hour in
the morning the night porter was certain to be asleep in his box, and therefore
in no position to know who had come in at that late hour.</p>
<p>It was just as Gilmour had expected, and with a smile of grim amusement he
tiptoed across the hall and walked up the stone stairs towards his flat. He
slipped his hand into his trousers pocket to search for his latchkey, but to
his great disgust it was not there. He searched again and again without
success. He found the latchkey of his office, which did not so much matter, but
the "Open Sesame" of his flat was not to be found.</p>
<p>He cursed aloud in his anger. There were only two things to be done. He must
wake up his housekeeper, which was the last thing in the world he wanted to do,
or he must creep downstairs again and arouse the night watchman who he knew
kept a set of spare latchkeys under careful lock and key for some such
emergency as this. Of the two alternatives, he chose the latter. It would never
do to knock up his housekeeper in his present garb, especially as he had told
her that he had gone to bed, and if she saw him dressed as he was at that
moment she was bound to have her suspicions aroused. Nor could he stay on the
landing all night, and the idea of going to a neighbouring hotel was
unthinkable.</p>
<p>He hurried off down the stairs, and woke the caretaker.</p>
<p>"I have lost my latchkey, Parsons," he said. "I have had a bit of an
adventure. I have been out playing golf all day and&mdash;Well, it doesn't matter, I am too tired to tell you now. Anyway, I got into a bit of a mess, and I have
been in the wars, as you can see. Let me have a spare key, will you?"</p>
<p>The sleepy watchman found the spare key and handed it over with a polite
hope that Mr. Gilmour was none the worse for what he had gone through.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Gilmour said. "It was rather a joke in its way. Good
night, Parsons."</p>
<p>"Well, that's a rum go," the watchman said to himself when Gilmour had
disappeared. "Been playing golf, has he? And only a few months ago he told me
he never touched a club. What 'ave 'e been up to? Not as it's any business of
mine, but he's such a respectable gentleman that really&mdash;"</p>
<p>And with that Parsons yawned himself to sleep again.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;VERA'S GHOST</h2>
<p>The last and most daring exploit on the part of the audacious river thieves
excited wide comment just at a time when there was not much going on, and
therefore the press accorded it a large measure of publicity. Strangely enough,
with the exception of the <i>Telephone,</i> which had very little to say in the
matter. But this policy was largely dictated by Ellis, who promised his people
plenty of sensational detail in the near future.</p>
<p>He had much to go on now, and he lost no time in placing his information in
the hands of Inspector Lock.</p>
<p>"Of course, you quite understand that I am doing this as much for my benefit
as yours," he told Lock. "I want to help you all I can, but I have my paper to
consider, and my own reputation at the same time. So long as the
<i>Telephone</i> gets the exclusive facts when the right time comes, I am ready
to place myself entirely in your hands. Do you see what I mean?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Lock smiled. "I gather that you have a good deal to tell me,
or you would not be here this morning."</p>
<p>"That's true enough," Ellis said dryly. "Now listen. You remember my theory
that Gilmour had everything arranged on the night he was to have dined at the
Moat House to make his alibi unshakable?"</p>
<p>"Of course I recollect. Your idea was that Croot was behind the whole thing,
and that it was some confederate who went down to Cray on the night in question
and left the return half of a first-class ticket where Gilmour could find it.
You thought that in some way Gilmour contrived to let his host know that he was
in trouble&mdash;sort of signalling dodge, in fact. If you could prove this it
would go a long way to convince me."</p>
<p>"I can prove it," Ellis said quietly. "I have been talking to my friend
Geoffrey Rust, who was present at the dinner party, and he has given me some
very valuable information. Before I go any further I may tell you that Mr. Rust
is a man of very large means who, under the terms of his late father's will,
has to spend some considerable time in a city office or forfeit the major
portion of his fortune. He doesn't care a bit about the work, of course, and
directly his time is up, he will turn his back upon commerce altogether. The
whole thing is a farce. He goes to the office regularly enough, but he does
very little, and has a good deal of time at his disposal. But mind you, Lock,
he's no fool. He's an old friend and schoolfellow of mine, and he is keeping
his eyes open. I took the responsibility of telling him all that I know,
because I can trust him, and you will see for yourself what a grand thing it is
to have somebody in Croot's office watching everything that is going on."</p>
<p>"That is very interesting," Lock said.</p>
<p>"I think I can interest you a little further," Ellis went on. "Now, as to
the night of the dinner party. Undoubtedly signals passed, and I am going to
prove it to you."</p>
<p>With that, Ellis proceeded to tell Lock the story of the mysterious tappings
on the dining-room window, and of Croot's subsequent movements. When he had
finished, Lock nodded his head approvingly, apparently quite convinced.</p>
<p>"It is extremely interesting," he said. "And I have not the slightest doubt
that you are right. Those two people were using a Morse code, and of course the
man outside the window was our man Gilmour. I must have him carefully watched.
I think you can safely leave that to me."</p>
<p>"I can tell you more than that," Ellis continued, disclosing the photograph
that had been torn from some illustrated paper, and this he followed up by
telling Lock all he knew about the mysterious house in Greencorn Street.</p>
<p>"What that place has to do with the rest of the story I don't quite know
yet," he said. "But I do know that Gilmour is the occupant, because I had him
watched, and he went from there a morning or two ago back to the offices of
Verity &amp; Co. in Great Bower Street. It's very likely when I see Rust again
that he will be able to help me out still further. Don't you think you could
manage to have that place searched by your people? It must be done in the
daytime, because I have an idea that Gilmour spends a lot of his time there at
night."</p>
<p>"We can do that, of course," Lock said.</p>
<p>"Good. Let me know when you are ready, and I will arrange with my friend
Rust to keep Gilmour out of the way. You can call me up at my proper lodgings
on the telephone. And now what do you make of this last robbery?"</p>
<p>"I haven't really gone into it yet," Lock confessed. "It was a fine piece of
work anyhow. Those people cut the lighter out and set it drifting down the
Thames, fortunately without doing any damage; but they got off with the cargo
all right, and no doubt by this time it is out of the country."</p>
<p>"I am quite sure it is," Ellis said. "You see, if Croot is behind this
thing, what amazing facilities he and Gilmour have, not only for handling
stolen goods, but knowing the exact whereabouts of the property before the raid
is made. Why, my dear fellow, Gilmour might even get away with a cargo
consigned to Verity &amp; Co. itself, and collect the insurance money after
they have sold the goods. It's a bigger proposition even than I thought."</p>
<p>"That's true," Lock agreed. "As far as I can ascertain, the watchers on
board the lighter were rendered unconscious by some sort of poison gas. At
first I thought the crew might have been in league with the thieves, but the
doctors assured me that the men were and are still suffering from some form of
gas poisoning. The cylinder must have been smuggled on board, but how it was
released is a bit of a mystery."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think so," Ellis said. "It might have been done automatically.
Clockwork or something of that sort, or perhaps some acid inserted in the tube
timed to eat its way through and release the gas at a certain moment. Oh, I can
think of a score of ways. Then when once the watchers on board the lighter were
unconscious, the thieves could remove the gas cylinder and throw it into the
river. You might see if you can drag it up. It's a thousand to one against your
doing anything of the sort, but if you do, it might considerably help us. I
shouldn't be at all surprised to find that Gilmour has some sort of a workshop
at 17 Greencorn Street. Remember that according to Bill Avory he was in the
Royal Navy at one time, and for all we know to the contrary he might have been
an engineer lieutenant. If that is so, then he would be a man of high technical
skill. A chemist probably, but certainly a man familiar with most machinery. I
am going to leave this photograph with you, and ask you to see if you can
manage to find the paper from which it originally came. Of course I don't mean
the actual paper itself, but the date of the journal and the issue containing
this photograph."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's only a matter of time," Lock said. "All these papers are filed
at the British Museum, and in the course of a few days my ferrets are certain
to worm it out."</p>
<p>"Yes, I expected you to say that," Ellis replied. "And when we have done
that we shall be able to discover Gilmour's real name. Of course he wasn't
called Gilmour when he was in the Navy. Unfortunately I was stupid enough not
to ask Avory exactly what Gilmour was called in the old days. But if you can
find out the name of the ship he was on, the Admiralty records will do the
rest. Of course he left the Navy under a cloud."</p>
<p>"Not the slightest doubt of that," Lock said. "I think you can safely leave
all these details to me."</p>
<p>"Well, we will leave it at that," Ellis said. "Now, has Professor Phillipson
got any further? You remember all about the adjourned inquest on Avory, and how
the professor hoped to be able to tell us the real cause of the poor chap's
death. At any rate, he was dead before he was found in the water."</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth," Lock said, "I have been too busily engaged on other
matters to give the thing a further thought. But I will get on the telephone
presently and let you know."</p>
<p>Ellis went off presently and dropped into his club at lunch time, where he
found Rust awaiting him.</p>
<p>"Oh, here you are," the latter cried. "Anything fresh?"</p>
<p>"I was going to ask <i>you</i> that. You have been keeping your eyes open,
of course. How is Croot getting on?"</p>
<p>"Oh, haven't you heard?" Rust asked. "He has met with a bit of an accident.
A most strange affair. Some one tried to burgle the Moat House a night or two
ago, and Croot happened to hear what was going on and came to grips with the
thief. He fell on the back of his head and cut himself rather badly. He is up
again now, but he won't be at business for a day or two. I saw Vera last night,
and it struck me that she was rather strange in her manner. I had forgotten to
tell you that she found her father lying on his back in the library, and
whether it was the shock or not I don't know, but Patricia says that she has
been anything but herself ever since."</p>
<p>"I think I will run down and see her this afternoon," Ellis said. "We
haven't met for some days, and if you will get Pat to call her up on the
telephone when you get to the office and ask her to meet me at four o'clock at
the usual place, I shall be obliged. If I don't hear from you in the course of
an hour I shall know it's all right. Now, how about our friend Gilmour?"</p>
<p>"Oh, there is nothing much to report in that direction," Rust said. "He
comes and goes rather mysteriously, but that might only be in the way of
business. Still, rather a queer thing happened this morning. I was down in the
basement of our offices looking up some old files in connexion with some
transaction with another firm, and on the floor of the sort of vault where
these papers are kept I picked up this."</p>
<p>Rust put his hand in his pocket and produced a Yale latchkey. On the one
side of the disc was stamped the name of Gilmour, and on the next line, 5
Everard Mansions.</p>
<p>"I don't attach any importance to it," he went on. "But you may see
something in it. It's quite evident that Gilmour dropped that latchkey, though
what he was doing down in that part of the building, Heaven only knows. Now,
what shall I do? Shall I give it back to him, or keep it?"</p>
<p>"You won't do either," Ellis said dryly. "You will hand it over to me. I
might make up my mind one of these evenings to do a little burglary on my own
account and overhaul Gilmour's flat. Or I might ask my friend, Inspector Lock,
to undertake that little adventure himself. At any rate, it is a nice thing to
know that I have the 'Open Sesame' to 5 Everard Mansions. Has Gilmour been
asking about his lost key, by any chance?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Rust said. "If he had I should be sure to have heard of
it. Probably he has got another by this time. But I should like to know in what
circumstances he lost it. Have you any sort of idea?"</p>
<p>"Only a vague one. Now, look here, Geoff. You are quite familiar with the
inner working of your office routine. Could you possibly arrange some night
when we know that Gilmour is safely out of the way to show me over the
building. I mean, have you a latch-key that opens the front door in Great Bower
Street?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't. I don't believe anybody has one except Croot and Gilmour.
But it is quite an old-fashioned lock, and I have no doubt that your friend
Lock would lend you one of his experts for half an hour if you wanted him."</p>
<p>"Now, that's not a bad idea," Ellis said. "I can't tell you why I want to go
over those offices at present, but I shouldn't be at all surprised if it proved
to be quite an education. However, we can talk about that later on."</p>
<p>It was well after three o'clock the same afternoon that Ellis found himself
in the little wood behind the Moat House waiting for Vera. She came at length,
looking pale and distressed, and not at all like her real self.</p>
<p>"My dearest girl," Ellis said anxiously. "What on earth's the matter? You
look as if you had seen a ghost."</p>
<p>"I have had a very anxious time, Jack," Vera said, with an unsteady smile.
"I suppose you heard what happened."</p>
<p>"Only this morning," Ellis said. "Geoff told me. Is your father very much
the worse for his adventure?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he is not seriously ill, if that is what you mean. He was very badly
shaken by his fall, and the cut in the back of his head was a nasty one. He is
up this afternoon and talks about going to business to-morrow. But that, of
course, is absurd. The doctor won't hear of anything of the kind. He will have
to stay where he is for a week at the very least."</p>
<p>"Tell me something about it," Ellis asked. "Have the police found any sort
of a clue?"</p>
<p>"Oh dear, I hope not," Vera cried suddenly.</p>
<p>"You hope not? My dear child, that is a most extraordinary thing to say!
Anybody listening might assume that you had some interest in shielding the
criminal."</p>
<p>Vera's eyes suddenly filled with tears. With his arm about her, Ellis could
feel her trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>"Tell me all about it," he whispered. "You have had a great shock, Vera.
Didn't you find your father that night?"</p>
<p>"I was in the hall," Vera said. "I had come down to get a book that I had
left in the drawing-room. It was quite dark, and I lost my sense of direction.
When I reached the library door something gleamed, and I was the centre of a
dazzling blaze of light. Then I heard a crash and a groan, and by the time I
found the switch and turned on the lights I saw my father lying insensible on
the floor. I believe I collapsed myself and fell into an oak chair in the
shadow of the hall, and then the thief coolly walked past me and disappeared
into the morning-room just for all the world as if he were familiar with the
house and knew exactly where to go. Then I fainted and did not come back to
myself until I felt the butler bending over me and asking me what was
wrong."</p>
<p>"A most remarkable thing," Ellis cried. "Did you by any chance happen to
recognize the intruder?"</p>
<p>"I did," Vera whispered. "I haven't dared to tell anyone else. I know you
will think I am mad, but I must speak, and I know you will respect my
confidence."</p>
<p>"Well, who was it, and why this mystery?"</p>
<p>Vera put her lips close to her companion's ear.</p>
<p>"It was Major Langley," she murmured.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;IN THE LABORATORY</h2>
<p>Jack Ellis looked down into the pretty pathetic face of his companion with a
sudden feeling of uneasiness. He was half inclined to smile, but the appeal for
sympathy in Vera's eyes checked that impulse, and he kissed her instead. She
must have been labouring under some delusion&mdash;she had been badly
frightened, no doubt, and her mind was not yet back to the normal. The idea of
Major Langley, that hopeless paralytic invalid, in the r&ocirc;le of a burglar,
was absolutely ludicrous. For some years now the man had not moved from his
chair, and no one knew it better than Ellis, who on several occasions had been
a guest in Patricia's cottage. And even if by some wild stretch of possibility
he had the physical power, it seemed equally impossible that Langley should
creep in the dead of night into his old home on some predatory expedition. He
had never even seen the place since that fatal evening in the library when he
had collapsed utterly after an interview with Mortimer Croot. But what that
interview had been about Ellis had never learnt, for Croot was exceedingly
reticent on the point, and had declined to give any information. He had hinted
distantly that something had been very wrong in the major's affairs, and that
he himself had gone out of his way to silence slanderous tongues. It had been
rather cleverly done, and had had precisely the effect that Croot had
intended.</p>
<p>"Do you realize what you are saying?" Ellis asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it sounds like a nightmare," Vera replied. "But I am not
mistaken, Jack. I couldn't be. I saw the major as plainly as I see you at the
present moment, and the recollection of his face has haunted me ever since.
That is why I am so glad you came here this afternoon. Oh, you can't understand
the relief it is to me to tell somebody about it. I am frightened, Jack; I am
afraid something dreadful is going to happen."</p>
<p>"Oh well, let us hope not. I take it from what you say that you haven't
mentioned this matter to anybody."</p>
<p>"I dared not do so," Vera whispered.</p>
<p>"Ah, there I think you are wise. You had better leave it to me. I think that
Pat ought to be told, but if you will be guided by me, you won't say anything
to your father."</p>
<p>Ellis said this somewhat hurriedly, with a feeling that he was skating on
very thin ice. With his knowledge of what was going on behind the scenes, the
last thing he wanted for the moment was for Vera to know anything of the truth.
He must conceal from her as far as possible the knowledge that her adopted
father was suspected of being engaged in those desperate enterprises which were
taking place upon the river. If he were, Vera would have to know sooner or
later, and be removed from the sinister influence; but if she once had the
slightest inkling of what was going on, then inevitably she would say or do
something which would put Croot upon his guard.</p>
<p>"I think you had better leave this to me," Ellis said. "In the first place,
I should like to consult Geoffrey Rust. After that we will decide what to do,
but in the meantime you had better say nothing about it to Pat. I will see Rust
to-morrow."</p>
<p>It was two days, however, before Ellis contrived to see his friend again,
and in the meantime a good deal had happened. Rust was just as puzzled and
perhaps quite as incredulous as Ellis had been. Meanwhile, he quite agreed that
Vera's discovery should be kept a secret, except so far as Pat was concerned,
and he promised to take an early opportunity that afternoon of taking her into
his confidence. All the same, he was quite sure that she would tell him that
Vera had been strangely mistaken.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it," he said. "You know what the major's condition is; you
have seen him in the cottage lots of times. Some days he is better than others,
but for the most part I regard his condition as quite hopeless. I wouldn't say
as much to Pat for the world, because she is looking forward to the day when
the poor old chap will be himself again. She argues that he is barely
forty-five, and still in the prime of life. She talks like this on the major's
good days, when he is quite sensible, and understands all that is going on. But
I say nothing."</p>
<p>"Which is quite the wisest plan," Ellis agreed. "We had better leave it at
that. You tell Pat all about it, and meet me here at luncheon to-morrow, and we
will go into the matter further. Meanwhile, Lock has sent for me, and I believe
we are going as far as Wimpole Street to have a consultation with Professor
Phillipson in his laboratory. So long."</p>
<p>Ellis jumped into a taxi and hurried off to New Scotland Yard. There he
found Lock awaiting him.</p>
<p>"Well," he asked, "any news of the foe? Anything doing the last two or three
days?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I think so." Lock smiled. "We seem to be getting on. But it's a long
business and we have far to go before we reach the daylight. But we shall get
there all right. Now, you remember suggesting to me the last time we met that
it might be worth our while to drag the bed of the river for that gas
apparatus. That was a very good idea of yours, and we have acted on the
suggestion. The odds were against us, of course, but unless I am greatly
mistaken, we have found the thing we were looking for."</p>
<p>"Good," Ellis cried. "But how did you manage it?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that was a little inspiration of Professor Phillipson's. When I told
him what had happened on the lighter the night those furs were stolen, he made
an excellent suggestion. Instead of using drags, we fished for the thing near
the spot where the lighter had been anchored up with a powerful magnet at the
end of a wire connected with a battery. The professor rigged it up for us,
being quite convinced that you were right when you said that those chaps had a
gas cylinder concealed on board the lighter, which they would naturally throw
overboard when they had finished with it."</p>
<p>"And you found it?" Rust asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I think so," Lock said. "We found a score of things, one of which is going
to help us in another case. But I don't want to go into that. What do you think
of this?"</p>
<p>From a wooden box on the floor Lock produced a metal cylinder a little more
than a foot long, which had evidently at some time contained gas. The cock had
been filed off, and round one shoulder was a sort of steel collar bolted on to
the body of the cylinder with metal wedges. The cylinder was empty, and
underneath the collar the metal of it had been melted away as if it had either
been subjected to a great heat, or consumed by some powerful acid.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the thing all right," Ellis cried. "Seems to be pretty clear how
the dodge was worked. The cylinder was full of gas, and in that Thermos flask
necklace arrangement was some acid that eat through its coverings and through
the envelope of the cylinder, thus releasing the gas. I suppose that would be
timed to take effect almost to a minute. A man with any scientific knowledge
could easily calculate it, and it is pretty plain to me that Gilmour possesses
that particular information. But what has the professor got to say about
it?"</p>
<p>"Well, if it is any satisfaction to you, his view is just the same," Lock
said. "He was here about an hour ago, and made a thorough inspection of the
cylinder. I think there is not the slightest doubt that we are on the right
track. However, we will go along to Wimpole Street together, and you shall hear
for yourself what the professor has to say."</p>
<p>"There is nothing I should like better," Ellis said. "By the way, how is his
side of the business going on? You know what I mean&mdash;his investigation
into the mysterious death of that unfortunate man Avory."</p>
<p>"Ah, that I cannot tell you. We have not discussed that angle of the matter.
I know that he has not been idle, and, as a matter of fact, I have been taking
a hand at the game too. I have never known the professor to be wrong, and when
he told me that Avory was dead before he was found in the Hampstead pond, I
accepted his word for it without question. Now, that being so, the murderer, or
murderers, must have placed the corpse in the water after their work was
finished. I decline to believe that Avory was at Hampstead at all; I believe he
was done in not very far from the locality where he lived, and I am not quite
sure that I can't put my finger on the right spot. But we will get to that when
we call on the professor. My idea is that Avory was murdered, and his body
conveyed to Hampstead in a cab or something of that sort. Or it might have been
on a motor lorry."</p>
<p>"What's the object of that?" Ellis asked.</p>
<p>"Why, to cover up tracks, of course. Get the body removed as far as possible
from the scene of the crime. Besides, it surrounds the whole thing with an air
of mystery, and perhaps suggests that Avory was leading a double life. I have
made inquiries amongst his friends, and I can't connect him with Hampstead at
all. The police there have been backing me up, and they can tell me nothing. I
shouldn't mind making a small bet that Avory was never near Hampstead in his
life. Some one wanted to get him out of the way, and perhaps you can guess who
that some one was."</p>
<p>"Well, Gilmour for one," Ellis cried.</p>
<p>"Precisely. Gilmour knew that he was recognized by Avory on a certain night,
and he was ready to take any risks to close the mouth of so dangerous a
witness. And it is my belief he did it. But he couldn't have got the body away
without assistance. He must have had some one in his confidence in a position
to place a conveyance at his disposal and convey the corpse to Hampstead. Mind
you, I am assuming that the crime was committed in Wapping."</p>
<p>"Of course it was," Ellis said. "I suppose you haven't forgotten the card I
found amongst Avory's possessions and the mysterious address at 17 Greencorn
Street. Oh, by the way, have you done anything in the matter of that particular
house?"</p>
<p>"We will come to that presently," Lock said evasively, "after we have had
our conversation with the professor. Meanwhile, you are interrupting me. I was
saying just now something about a conveyance placed at, shall we say, Gilmour's
disposal? So I began to make inquiries. I was looking for the man who has a
taxi or a lorry by which ostensibly he gets a livelihood, and at the same time
has a great deal of time on his hands, and a fair amount of money to waste, and
I found him."</p>
<p>"Go on," Ellis cried eagerly. "Go on."</p>
<p>"Well, he is a man called George. He doesn't seem to have any name but
George, at least, none of his neighbours seem to be aware that he has a
surname. He lives in a yard which used to be a mews in the old days, and he
does entirely for himself in one room over a stable loft. He has a lorry of
sorts, and a taxi for which he holds a licence. He takes out the cab sometimes,
but sometimes for days on end it is never outside the garage. It hasn't been
outside the garage for two days to my certain knowledge. The fellow doesn't
drink, at least not to excess, and he has no ostentatious vices, though he has
plenty of money. Now, it struck me as odd that this man should be in a position
to work one day a week and, moreover, that he required no assistance, despite
the fact that he has two petrol conveyances. So I am having an eye kept upon
him, and one of my best men has managed to scrape acquaintance with him. I have
discovered that on the night when I went down to the Moat House, George's cab
left the garage just about the time it would take Gilmour to drive from Wapping
to Cray. That is about as far as I have got up to now, except that the evening
following the big robbery of furs from the lighter on the river George's
motor-lorry was out from just after dark till two o'clock in the morning. Of
course, that proves nothing. But when I get a bit further in my investigations,
we might find it very useful. But come along&mdash;let's get to Wimpole
Street."</p>
<p>Professor Phillipson was in the laboratory and welcomed his visitors
eagerly. Ellis gazed round the big scientific workshop with its test tubes and
all kinds of elaborate and delicate machinery, noting all these with a
journalistic eye and with a view to the future. There was something very
interesting in a place like this, with its maps and drawings, and the hundreds
of small bottles on the shelves neatly labelled, and all of them filled with
strange objects that suggested something in the shape of nightmare dreams. The
professor sat at a big table with a mass of papers before him, and he looked up
eagerly as his visitors entered. He drew towards him a sheet of calculations,
and laid a long slender hand on the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>"You have come at the right moment," he said. "I have just finished my
analysis in connexion with the death of that unfortunate man William Avory. It
was just as I told you. The poor fellow was dead before he was placed in the
water, as I guessed at the time. You remember what I told you at the inquest,
Mr. Ellis. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. It is no difficult matter
to place a body in water without any marks of violence upon it, and with no
injury to the internal organs, so as to delude everybody into the idea that
death was due to drowning. But the people responsible for that did not know
quite enough. They didn't know, for instance, that a drowned person has water
in the lungs, and that there would be no moisture in the lungs of a corpse
placed in the water&mdash;that is, a dead body placed in the water after
decease. But of course the police surgeon knew that, and very wisely said
nothing about it. When we come to the adjourned inquest he will speak candidly
enough, because by that time I hope that our friend, Inspector Lock here, will
have laid the miscreant by the heels. You can see now, Mr. Ellis, why we
entered into that little conspiracy with the connivance of the coroner."</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite appreciate that, professor," Ellis said. "I don't want to be
unduly inquisitive, but perhaps you can tell me how my unfortunate friend was
killed."</p>
<p>"Ah, that I am in a position to do now beyond the shadow of a doubt. I have
worked it all out, and I don't think there can possibly be a flaw in my
diagnosis. You remember me calling your attention to certain marks like scalds
or burns on one of the dead man's hands. It was a mere nothing, and would have
escaped the attention of the average man, though to me it was eloquent enough.
Avory was killed by an electric shock."</p>
<p>"What, do you mean deliberately?" Ellis asked.</p>
<p>"I have not the slightest doubt of it," the professor went on. "He must have
been deliberately lured into some place, a workshop perhaps, where they use a
deal of power. My analysis points to at least two thousand volts. Avory was
induced, no doubt, to touch a live wire, which means that he died instantly. But
nothing to notice except that little burn on one hand. We must find out now
where that workshop is."</p>
<p>Lock allowed his gaze to wander round the room. Then he turned round and
smiled at the speaker.</p>
<p>"This is where I come in," he murmured. "Because I can tell you exactly
where this vile thing was done."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XX&mdash;THE MAJOR SPEAKS</h2>
<p>Saturday was usually a day that did not count for much in Great Bower
Street, and indeed Croot had never been in the habit of attending the office at
all on Saturdays. As a matter of fact, the office closed at twelve o'clock, and
as likely as not Gilmour had gone off on the Friday evening on one of those
mysterious week-end excursions of his which, had he known it, was occupying a
good deal of Jack Ellis's attention. The latter knew that Gilmour had departed
for the country early on the Saturday in question, and shortly after midday he
put in an appearance in the hall of the block of flats called Everard Mansions
and was asking questions of the caretaker.</p>
<p>He was going down to Cray to play golf himself by a train that would get him
down to the Club House in time for lunch, where he hoped to be joined by Vera,
together with Pat Langley and Geoffrey Rust. He had been denied the
entr&eacute;e of the Manor House, but nothing had been said as to his meeting
Vera elsewhere, and as Croot was still confined to the house, Ellis was looking
forward to what ought to prove a pleasant afternoon. True, there was delicate
business to be discussed, but that ought not to detract from the pleasure of
the day.</p>
<p>Ellis walked into the hall of the Mansions breezily enough, and inquired of
the hall porter as to Gilmour's movements. He was dressed in the smartest of
golfing kits, and hoped to pass himself off as a friend of Gilmour's without
exciting suspicion.</p>
<p>"No, sir, Mr. Gilmour is not here," the porter replied in answer to Ellis's
brief question. "I think he has gone off playing golf. He went away in a taxi,
and told me that he shouldn't be back before Monday morning."</p>
<p>"Now, that's rather annoying," Ellis said. "I had hoped to catch him before
he started. The fact is, I have a bit of property of his, something he lost
which I picked up."</p>
<p>"It don't 'appen to be a latchkey, sir, I suppose?" the porter asked.
"Because Mr. Gilmour lost one."</p>
<p>This was precisely what Ellis hoped to hear. It occurred to him that if
Gilmour had come home late one evening he would be compelled either to knock up
his housekeeper or invoke the assistance of the porter, who, in a well-arranged
block of flats, is usually prepared for such an emergency.</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact it is," he smiled. "Do you know when Mr. Gilmour
lost his key?"</p>
<p>A good deal depended upon the answer, and Ellis awaited it with some
anxiety, which he was at some pains to conceal.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course I can tell you that, sir," the porter replied. "It was
Wednesday night. 'E came back very late, and asked me if I could help him. 'E
didn't want to wake up 'is landlady, so 'e asked me for a spare key. I keep
those locked up, and I lend them to the tenants, of course taking care to get
'em back in the morning. We has to be very particular about that, because it
leads to trouble sometimes. If you have that key, sir, I shall be very glad to
have it back again."</p>
<p>Ellis hesitated for a moment. He did not in the least want to part with the
key, and, on the other hand, he could not obtain the desired information
without approaching the porter on the subject. Some time or another it might be
necessary to use the latch-key with a view to inspecting the interior of
Gilmour's flat, but if Gilmour was to be informed that some friend of his had
found the missing property, it would have to be given up again, and Ellis was
not in the least anxious to have his name connected with the matter. At any
rate, his morning had not been wasted, because he had ascertained beyond a
doubt that Gilmour had been away from home till very late on the night of the
last raid on the Thames, and this in itself was of great value.</p>
<p>He looked at the porter again. He saw a man with a suspiciously red face,
and a pair of red eyes which told their own tale. Was it possible, he thought,
to make it worth the porter's while to say nothing of this visit?</p>
<p>"Yes, I know Mr. Gilmour was late that night," he said. "Was he at
all&mdash;well, you know what I mean?"</p>
<p>The porter grinned, and nodded his head.</p>
<p>"Been up to some lark, I think, sir," he said. "Come in with a shabby suit
of clothes, and looked as if he had been sweeping a chimney. And in a rare bad
temper, too. 'E would never 'ave woke me up unless 'e'd been obliged to,
sir."</p>
<p>"Yes, I think I could tell you a good deal about that," Ellis said. "You
never know what these respectable people are up to, porter. I should like to
have a bit of fun with Mr. Gilmour over this. Only I don't want him to know
it."</p>
<p>"Sort of pulling 'is leg, I suppose," the porter chuckled.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it. Anyway, I have his key, and I will give it back to him when
the proper time comes. But I don't want you to tell him that till I see you
again. Don't you say anything about it, and here's a pound note for you. If you
are discreet there will be another when the joke is finished."</p>
<p>The porter gave the desired assurance, and Ellis went his way on exceedingly
good terms with himself. He had established an important fact, and one that
might be of great value a little later on. He could quite understand why
Gilmour had preferred to obtain a spare latchkey in preference to calling up
his housekeeper. No doubt that worthy woman would be prepared to swear that her
employer had not been off the premises after dinner on the night in question,
and, moreover, make that declaration firmly believing it to be true. Ellis was
therefore feeling very pleased with himself when he turned into the Club House
to find Patricia Langley and Geoffrey Rust awaiting him at the luncheon
table.</p>
<p>But there was no sign of Vera, and, moreover, a message had come from her to
the effect that she had been detained at home in attendance on her adopted
father, who was still confined to the house and who was not quite so well as he
had been. Vera hoped to join them in the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>"That's rather annoying," Ellis said. "I suppose we shall have to play a
three ball, but that's a mere detail. Geoff, have you said anything to Pat on
the subject we were speaking about?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have," Rust replied. "We have just been talking about it. I think
that Vera ought to know that we have taken Patricia into our confidence."</p>
<p>"I cannot understand it," Pat said. "I can't make it out at all. To me it's
absolutely incredible. I have never seen my father in a fit state to
move&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly, and her colour changed. For quite suddenly there
flashed into her mind the recollection of that occasion when she had seen him
standing before the fire-place in the little sitting-room looking into the
glass and apparently shaking his fist at some imaginary enemy.</p>
<p>"Go on," Geoffrey said encouragingly. "Go on."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better tell you," Pat said. "It is a very small matter, but
in the face of what Geoff has been telling me, rather significant."</p>
<p>She told them her story in a few words, and her companions exchanged
glances. For this did not sound very like a man who had lain helpless for at
least three years, and unable even to eat his own food without assistance.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is significant," Rust said thoughtfully. "I think, Pat, when you
get back this afternoon, you had better tell your father what Vera says, and
give him the opportunity of taking you into his confidence if he will. At any
rate, we can't do any more till we see Vera. Let's have our lunch now, and go
out and play our round."</p>
<p>It was nearly four o'clock before Vera came on the course, by which time the
match was finished, and Pat on her way homewards, for she had felt compelled to
get back and give her father his tea without waiting for her friend.</p>
<p>"If there is anything particular, you can come along and see me, Geoff," she
said. "I am sorry to have missed Vera this afternoon, but I really must get
away."</p>
<p>Vera came, looking pale and distracted, and indeed she had had anything but
a pleasant time since breakfast. Croot was still confined to the house, and
chafing against his captivity. He wanted to get back to work again, and Vera
had found his irritability exceedingly trying. He did not want to be left
alone; indeed at first he had almost forbidden her to leave the house. But
perhaps the sight of her pale face had had its proper effect, for he suddenly
changed his mind and ordered her to go for a walk. Whatever his vices might be,
and however deeply he was in crime, there was no question of his affection for
Vera. It was the one bright spot in an otherwise selfish and unscrupulous life.
And Vera felt this, and was not ungrateful, though she was exceedingly unhappy,
and from time to time she recalled certain little incidents from the past which
assumed a strange significance in view of what Ellis had told her on the
occasion of their last meeting.</p>
<p>She seemed to feel the coming trouble, the vague intangible catastrophe that
hovered over the house, though she could not have said what it was, and why
this thing haunted her. But haunt her it did, and she was bearing the marks of
it as she joined the other two on the Club House veranda. There was no one else
about, therefore they could talk quite freely.</p>
<p>"What have you done, Jack?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well, not very much in your absence," Ellis said. "Pat knows now what you
told me, and she is as mystified as you are. I wish she could have stayed and
talked it over with us, but she said that she had to get back, and if we really
wanted her she would come out again after tea."</p>
<p>"Hadn't I better go and see her?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, you might do that after we are gone. I must get away by the 5.15. What
are you going to do, Geoff?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am in no hurry," Rust replied. "I rather thought of staying down here
till Monday, putting up at the hotel."</p>
<p>"Right, we'll leave it at that then," Ellis said. "You go along to the
cottage later on, Vera, and talk this matter over with Pat. But one thing I
must impress upon you. This business of the burglary at the Moat House is a
dead secret between the four of us, and it must not be mentioned to a
soul."</p>
<p>"Not even my father?" Vera asked.</p>
<p>"Good Lord, no, he's the last person&mdash;oh, I don't quite mean
that&mdash;I mean that no one must know about it."</p>
<p>Vera listened with a sinking heart. It was plain to her from Ellis's slip
that he had some special reason why the story should be concealed from Mortimer
Croot. All the old terrors were coming back to her now, and perhaps Ellis saw
it, for he laid his hand almost protectingly on her arm.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to be frightened about," he said soothingly. "And I know
you are no coward. There is going to be a good deal of trouble for us before
long, Vera, and you will have to take your part in it with the rest. If I
didn't feel quite sure that I could rely upon you, I should have said
nothing."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am sure of that," Vera said. "I don't know why I feel nervous and
full of dread, but I am."</p>
<p>"Courage," Ellis said, "courage. There is nothing that can hurt either of
us, and when it is all over you will be the happier for it. Now, go along and
see Pat. You can tell her everything you told us, and perhaps when we meet
to-morrow in the afternoon we shall see our way clearer."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pat had gone thoughtfully homewards. She had been a good deal
disturbed, naturally, by what Ellis had had to say, and she was still dazed and
bewildered by the startling circumstances that had just been related to her. It
seemed almost incredible to believe that her father had done this thing. In the
first place, she had never known him, except on that one occasion, to leave his
chair since that fatal night when she had found him on the floor of the Moat
House library on the verge of death. He had been a long time recovering his
power of speech, and the partial use of his limbs. He was a confirmed invalid,
and seemed likely to remain so despite the fact that Pat in her more sanguine
moments tried to delude herself that he was getting better. And here he was
now, actually accused of walking unaided from the cottage in the dead of night
to the Moat House, and there engaging in a cool and audacious burglary.</p>
<p>At any rate, she must ask him about it, because so far as she could gather,
Vera was perfectly convinced of the truth of her story, and no questions had
shaken her.</p>
<p>Major Langley was seated in his chair, waiting patiently for his tea in his
usual attitude of apathy and dejection, but he looked up with a sudden gleam in
his eye directly Pat asked him a plain and pointed question. Had he or had he
not been outside the house at any time without her knowledge?</p>
<p>"Why do you ask?" Langley demanded, speaking in a voice that fairly took
Patricia aback.</p>
<p>Without any prevarication she told him.</p>
<p>"It's true," he said. "I am not going to make any excuses, Pat. You have
found me out, and I will make a clean breast of it."</p>
<p>He rose from his chair, and stood before the fire-place in the attitude of a
man who is in full possession of all his strength and faculties. There was no
sign of the invalid now.</p>
<p>"I found it out nearly a year ago," he said. "I found out that my strength
was returning. When you are away at business and I am alone here, I take all
sorts of exercise. There is a reason, a powerful reason, why I wanted to keep
the knowledge to myself. Oh, you would have known all right when the proper
time came. Pat, I have been robbed and swindled. You have been deprived of your
inheritance by a cold-blooded scoundrel who deliberately plotted your father's
ruin. I knew it the night I had that attack, and I was prepared to meet Croot
on his own ground and defeat him. I had all the proofs ready, but that worry
and anxiety was too much for me, and I collapsed at the very moment when I
needed every ounce of my strength. For over two years you know what I was, but
I am all right again now, and nobody outside the circle of our friends could
guess it. I shall confront Croot when I am ready, and you will see him collapse
like a bubble. But I must get my proofs, whatever happens, I must get my
proofs."</p>
<p>"Where are they?" Pat asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, that I am not going to tell anybody. I dare not run the risk. But they
exist not far from here, and Croot does not dream of it. You have heard
me&mdash;"</p>
<p>Pat lifted a warning finger.</p>
<p>"Not another word," she whispered.</p>
<p>Langley looked at her inquiringly; then as his glance wandered round the
room he saw the reason for this caution.</p>
<p>For Vera was standing in the doorway.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;THE LIVE WIRE</h2>
<p>It was not until lunch-time on the following Monday that Ellis heard
anything further as to what had transpired at Cray when he met Rust at the
club. The latter had come along direct from the office for his usual leisurely
hour or so.</p>
<p>"Well," Rust said, "I suppose you want to know, you know, like the man who
called at the Circumlocum Office."</p>
<p>"Circumlocution Office," Ellis corrected. "Yes, I am rather interested. All
about Major Langley, you know."</p>
<p>"I wasn't there, as a matter of fact," Rust proceeded to explain, "but Pat
told me afterwards. Vera's amazing statement was absolutely true, my dear chap.
The major was in the Moat House on the night in question. If you ask me why I
can't tell you, because on that point he refused to say anything. But perhaps I
had better begin at the beginning. When Pat got back to the cottage she told
her father quite plainly what she had heard, and asked him for an explanation.
Then he told her that for some considerable time past he had been practically
all right. Moreover, he told her that he had been the victim of a vile
conspiracy on Croot's part, and that he hoped before long to be able to prove
it. He said he had adopted this method so that he might confront Croot when the
right time came. What he was after in the Moat House, Heaven only knows, for he
would say nothing about that. Of course, Vera does not dream of this. I talked
it over with Pat, and we decided that it would never do to take her into our
confidence on that particular matter just yet. But she knows now that she was
not mistaken as to the identity of the midnight intruder, and she also knows
that the major is himself again. You see, Vera walked into the cottage just at
the moment when Pat was having it out with her father. That being so, he could
not tell a deliberate lie, and therefore Vera was sworn to secrecy and told
that she should know everything in good time. My idea is that Langley was after
something at the Moat House which he knows to be hidden somewhere in the
library. But at any rate that is all I can tell you."</p>
<p>"And quite enough, too," Ellis said. "Now, did you happen to see Croot over
the week-end?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I did," Rust said. "And very irritable he was. There isn't much
the matter with him, but the doctor insisted upon his staying in the house, and
that seemed to worry him. He was very anxious to see Gilmour, and I had
instructions to tell him to go down to the Moat House this evening and make
arrangements to stay the night there."</p>
<p>"That's capital," Ellis cried. "Couldn't be better, because I have a little
business on to-night, which requires Gilmour's absence. I will tell you what it
is later on."</p>
<p>Having assured himself not long before the dinner hour that Gilmour had gone
down to the Moat House for the night, Ellis made an appointment with Inspector
Lock over the telephone to call upon him about ten o'clock that evening with a
view to going as far as 17 Greencorn Street, and raiding the premises there.
Just before the appointed time he was seated in Lock's office.</p>
<p>"Gilmour is out of the way for the night," he explained. "And so it occurred
to me that here was our opportunity. Of course, I am taking it for granted that
Gilmour is the mysterious occupant of the house in Greencorn Street, and that
we are likely to learn a good deal when we get there. Now, listen, and I will
tell you something that may be of use to you."</p>
<p>With that Ellis went on to tell the story of the way in which the latchkey
of No. 5 Everard Mansions had found its way into his possession, and also of
the inquiries he had made of the caretaker in the big block of flats.</p>
<p>"I have a little idea of my own," he went on. "From what I have just told
you you will see that Gilmour got back to his flat very late on the night those
furs were stolen. Moreover, he was in a very dirty condition, and dressed in
some shabby old tweeds, which, he explained to the caretaker, was due to the
fact that he had been playing golf. He also hinted that he had got into a bit
of a mess afterwards, though we can take that for what it is worth. It is a lie,
of course, all due to the fact that he had lost his latchkey. He must have
sneaked out of his house on the night of the raid and reached the street
without using the lift. Also, you will find, if you come to inquire, that he so
contrived it as to leave his housekeeper under the impression that he had never
left the flat that night at all. I suppose it is possible to ascertain if this
really was the case."</p>
<p>"Oh, that is quite easy," Lock smiled. "I will put one of our lady
detectives on to the job, and ask her to scrape acquaintance with the woman in
question. She can call upon her, for instance, as a servant who is looking for
a situation. There are dozens of ways. She will very soon find out what
happened after Gilmour had had his dinner on the night of the raid. At a guess,
I should say that Gilmour probably pretended to go to bed early. At any rate, I
am willing to make a small bet that you are right. And if Gilmour really is out
of the way&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, that you can rely upon," Ellis interrupted.</p>
<p>"Then in that case we had better get along."</p>
<p>They went off together presently, and in the course of time reached the
dingy thoroughfare in Wapping out of which Greencorn Street led. It was getting
fairly late by this time, so that they had the byway practically to themselves.
Not that Lock was taking any sort of risks. He waited for quite half an hour on
the open patch of land by the side of the lonely house before he was satisfied
that he and his companion were not being shadowed, then very cautiously he
proceeded to examine the roughly boarded-up front door with the aid of a little
torch.</p>
<p>"Ah, here we are," he said presently. "A very neatly-disguised keyhole. You
can see it there, between the cracks and the board. I think I have a key to
open that."</p>
<p>A minute or two later the whole of the boarding swung back, disclosing the
doorway and the passage beyond, into which Lock darted, followed by his
companion. He closed the door behind him, and they stood there in the thick
velvety darkness. Then the torch was flashed on again, and Lock moved the speck
of light around till he located the brasswork of a switch. Then he proceeded to
flood the passage with light.</p>
<p>"Isn't that rather risky?" Ellis suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh, not a bit of it. You may depend upon it that every window is boarded
up, so that not a ray of light shows."</p>
<p>And this proved to be the case. There was nothing in either of the rooms
upstairs, and no sign that they had ever been occupied, neither was there
anything like a gas-bracket or a single indication that the electric wires had
been carried any higher than the ground floor. The broken dusty windowpanes
were boarded up a foot or two inside the room, so that no air or light could
penetrate, and having once satisfied himself of this, Lock made his way down
the creaking rotten stairs again. So far as he could see, the only room that
had been occupied was one at the back.</p>
<p>"Do you see anything suspicious here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I can see nothing," Ellis laughed. "Only a strongly-made table and a couple
of chairs."</p>
<p>"Ah, then it never occurred to you as strange that this room has been newly
papered. I wonder why. And again, the room is much smaller than I judged from
the outside. Narrow, as if a portion had been cut off. Unless I am greatly
mistaken, we shall find something interesting behind that farther wall. But we
must be careful not to make any mess, or our man will certainly find out that
somebody has been investigating here."</p>
<p>Lock took from his pocket a small ivory rule with which he went over the
floor, at the same time making certain calculations in a notebook. Then he
looked up suddenly.</p>
<p>"Ah, what's this?" he asked. "That board leading from the door to the
opposite wall has been taken up within the last few months. You can see the
cracks in the dirt which are not visible anywhere else, and you will notice
that the board runs under what should be the skirting on the far side. But no
skirting is visible there, and the paper goes right down to the floor. As it
only does so on that side of the room, there must be some reason for it, The
wall on that side has been boarded up. Listen, don't you notice the hollow
sound it gives?"</p>
<p>Lock tapped the board with his knuckles, and surely enough it rang out with
a sort of dull echo. Undoubtedly there was woodwork behind that paper, but no
sign of a door, though Lock examined the pattern of the wall-paper with
meticulous care.</p>
<p>"There must be a spring there," he said. "And we have got to find it. Of
course, I could have the place raided to-morrow morning if I liked, but I don't
want to do that, because it would be giving the whole game away to our friend
Gilmour. We must find the spring, or we are merely wasting our time here. Happy
thought. Let us get up that floor-board."</p>
<p>The long plank in the floor was lifted without much trouble, showing in the
hollow space below a long black snake-like object that ran from the outer wall
across to the wooden partition concealed behind the florid wall-paper.</p>
<p>"By Jove! we are getting on to it all right now," Lock said. "That is the
cable from which the lights come, and if I am not greatly mistaken has been
taken off the main. I have dabbled a bit in electricity, and I know what I am
talking about. Now, will you kindly tell me why a cable capable of carrying a
load of at least two thousand volts has been installed in a shanty like this?
No doubt that cable was built in the road to supply the garage opposite. There
is something more than meets the eye here, Mr. Ellis. Before I go any farther,
I should like to find the switch controlling the cable. As far as I can see,
there are two different installations here. But if the power is fully on, then
I don't want to monkey with it. If I should happen to touch a live wire behind
that partition, Scotland Yard would certainly be deprived of one of its
brightest ornaments. Now, would you mind taking the torch and seeing if you can
find a switchboard somewhere just inside the front door, and ascertain if the
power is on? It must be somewhere near the front door, because I can see no
sign of a meter anywhere. If I am not altogether wrong, the main cable has been
tapped, and consequently there is no record in the company's books of any power
installation in this house."</p>
<p>With the torch in his hand Ellis proceeded to make a search for the
switchboard, which he found, after a good deal of trouble, concealed behind a
heap of rubbish just inside the front door. Having satisfied himself of the
fact that the current was not running, he was about to return to the
sitting-room when a small white object lying on the boards behind the door
attracted his attention. He picked it up, and saw that it was a grimy envelope
of some cheap paper which had evidently been pushed under the door by some one,
but the thing that caused Ellis to whistle softly was the fact that the
envelope was addressed in scrawling characters to "Mr. Gilmer."</p>
<p>"Here's a find," he exclaimed, as he handed over the envelope to Lock.
"Evidently one of Gilmour's friends, though the spelling is wrong. I'd like to
see what is inside that."</p>
<p>"You shall," Lock said promptly. "I will open that envelope. It's quite easy
if you know how."</p>
<p>With a thin-bladed knife and a little care Lock released the flap of the
envelope without in the least damaging the fabric. Inside it was a bill for
some thirty odd pounds from a motor garage addressed to one Mr. George Pensum,
of Ray's Mews, and a printed intimation at the foot to the effect that the
account was much overdue, and that if it was not paid within the next seven
days, proceedings would be taken without further notice.</p>
<p>"Ah, we are certainly getting on," Lock murmured. "And you will agree with
me when I tell you that the taxi driver I told you about lives in Ray's Mews,
and is known as George. I presume Pensum is his proper name. And look at
this."</p>
<p>Inside the envelope was a scrap of paper addressed to "Mr. Gilmer," and some
scrawling lines asking the recipient of the note to find the wherewithal to
discharge the obligation, unless he wanted to make trouble. Lock chuckled as he
read.</p>
<p>"Now, there is a bit of evidence for you," he said. "The taxi driver who
does no work and who always has plenty of money is evidently one of Gilmour's
confederates. It is undoubtedly the man who drove him down to the Moat House
upon a certain historic occasion, and beyond question he knows the mystery of
this sinister place, or he would never have pushed that note under the door for
Gilmour to find. Gilmour is apparently the man who finds all the money, and our
friend George expects him to provide this. We will seal that envelope up again
and put it where we found it. I should much prefer to keep it, but that would
be rather dangerous. If Gilmour finds that the note is not where George put it,
he is certain to smell a rat, and that is the last thing we want. Still, we
know where we are standing now, and we can afford to be patient. But we haven't
found out what is behind that boarding yet."</p>
<p>Very grimly, and with infinite patience, Lock went over every inch of the
boarded wall, knocking on it with his knuckles, and measuring from time to
time, especially in the part that reached vertically upwards above the line
from which the floor-board had been removed. Then suddenly he chuckled.</p>
<p>"I believe I have got it," he exclaimed. "There is something hard here,
something that obtrudes."</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before a section of the boarded wall
commenced to move, and swung round like the circular glass door in an
up-to-date hotel, displaying a large cavity behind, which appeared in the dim
light to resemble the machine-room on board a modern liner. With the aid of the
torch Lock localized a pair of switchboards, the smaller of which evidently
controlled the lighting within the roomy recess. Rather cautiously he handled
the buttons on this, taking great care not to touch the larger board, so that
instantly the place radiated brilliantly.</p>
<p>"Ah, here we are," he said. "A fine up-to-date workshop. Now, I wonder what
this means. I have a vague notion of what it has been used for, that is apart
from its commercial value, but what is Gilmour doing with a plant like this?
The last affair of the kind I had anything to do with was run by the most
ingenious set of coiners that we ever laid by the heels. But we shall come to
all that in good time, no doubt. Ah, here is the whole set-out, even to
india-rubber gloves and rubber mats. There is enough power here to electrocute
a regiment. Do you see that wire there? If I switched on the current and you
touched it, you would be dead in the fraction of a second. Does that convey
anything to you? No?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid I don't quite follow," Ellis said.</p>
<p>Lock lowered his voice impressively.</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," he murmured. "It is as plain as daylight. You know that
the man Avory was lured here, and beyond the shadow of a doubt he was
deliberately electrocuted in that closet."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;THE KAMALOO COPPER
TRUST</h2>
<p>Now and again when office matters were a little slack, Rust was in the habit
of rushing off to the West End and there entertaining Patricia to a more or
less elaborate lunch, and, Gilmour being away, and Croot still confined to the
house, they were off on one of these unofficial excursions two mornings later.
It was only a matter of an hour or so, and nobody was any the wiser.</p>
<p>They had finished a dainty little repast in the quiet exclusive restaurant
that Rust usually patronized, and were talking generally over the coffee and
cigarettes. Nobody was within earshot, and Rust was in confidential mood.</p>
<p>"I want you to tell me what happened the other day when you spoke to your
father about that mysterious enterprise of his," he said. "I mean after Vera
had gone. Oh, I know, of course, what he said in her presence, but has he
confided in you since?"</p>
<p>"No, he hasn't," Pat confessed. "He seems to think that I am not to be
trusted. I don't exactly mean that; I mean he wants a man friend to help him,
and I suggested that you should come down with me and talk matters over. He
likes you, Geoff, he liked you even before he knew who you were, and when he
thought that you were just a clerk in Mr. Croot's office. He thinks you are
quite clever, especially with regard to business matters."</p>
<p>"Where did he get that delusion from?"</p>
<p>"My dear boy," Pat smiled. "It is no delusion, and you know it. Oh, I know
that you laugh at yourself and tell everybody that you will be only too glad to
turn your back on the city, but I have had my eye upon you, and you are as
competent as any of them. Now confess, hasn't your experience been of use to
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it has," Rust admitted. "My father was quite right when he
made that stipulation. I used to be a great fool as far as money was concerned,
but I have learnt a lesson since I have been in the city. Not that I have grown
mean, I hope, but I can tell the difference between the true and the false, and
between ourselves, Pat, I have enjoyed my experience. You see, I am a member of
the City Carlton Club, and though they regarded me as a greenhorn at first, I
flatter myself that I have taught more than one shady city man a lesson."</p>
<p>"That is precisely what I told my father," Pat said. "I am quite sure you
will be able to help him. If you like to come down with me this evening after
business hours&mdash;"</p>
<p>Rust leant eagerly across the table.</p>
<p>"I am only too glad of the chance," he said. "Now, look here, Pat, I don't
want to come merely as a business acquaintance. I want you to give me the right
to help, and let me tell your father so. Here have I been making love to you
for the last six months, and so far I haven't even kissed you."</p>
<p>"You are taking a lot for granted," Pat smiled, though her eyes told Rust a
good deal.</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense," he said. "I am not coming under any other conditions. What's
the good of going on like this? You know I love you, Pat, but of course if you
don't return&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course I do," Pat blushed. "But we can't talk about this sort of thing
here. Good gracious, it's gone two o'clock."</p>
<p>They hurried back to the office, and shortly after six o'clock Rust found
himself in the sitting-room of the little cottage listening to all that the
major had to say.</p>
<p>"I have come down here, sir," Rust said, "to do anything I can for you. But
there is something I must tell you first. You know all about me now; you know
what my past has been, and what my future prospects are. For the best part of a
year now I have been in love with Pat, as indeed I was before I knew that she
was anything but a typist in the offices of Verity &amp; Co., and if you are
agreeable, after hearing me say this, all my time and all my resources are at
your disposal."</p>
<p>For a few minutes the major sat in his chair saying nothing. He looked from
Rust's face into Pat's blushing, smiling one, and his brooding eyes strangely
softened.</p>
<p>"That's good hearing, my boy," he said. "Very good hearing. Pat's future has
been one of my great anxieties, and now that that is assured a great weight is
lifted off my mind. Of course, you can't expect to understand a father's
feelings, but you must know what I mean. And yet, if I had not been the victim
of a vile conspiracy, Pat would be far more favourably situated than the
majority of girls in her own class."</p>
<p>"Well, that's settled, anyway," Rust said cheerfully. "Now perhaps you will
tell me what I can do to help."</p>
<p>Major Langley lighted a cigarette, and passed his case over to Rust. He
settled himself back in his chair and began to speak with a clearness and force
that fairly astonished both listeners. He was no longer the helpless invalid,
practically paralysed, and half deprived of his faculties. He spoke slowly and
thoughtfully, and very much to the point.</p>
<p>"First of all," he said. "I am going to ask you a business question. You
have been in the city now for nearly two years, and you must have learnt a good
deal."</p>
<p>"Oh, I have picked up a thing or two," Rust said modestly.</p>
<p>"He has done far more than that, father," Pat cried. "If Geoff liked, he
could make a good living in business."</p>
<p>"I dare say he could, my dear," the major went on. "At any rate, I am going
to test him. Now, look here, Mr. Rust&mdash;I beg your pardon, I ought to have
said Geoff&mdash;did you ever hear anything of a concern called the Kamaloo
Copper Trust?"</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I have," Rust said. "I have been dabbling in
mines myself. There is a friend of mine at the club who is right in the swing.
He hasn't much money himself, but I find the cash and he the exclusive
information, and together we have done very well indeed. Now, wasn't this
Kamaloo Copper Trust at one time better known as Broken Point?"</p>
<p>"That's right," the major cried eagerly. "My dear boy, practically every
penny I had in the world was invested in the Broken Point Mine, and the man who
induced me to take that plunge was Mortimer Croot. In those days&mdash;I am
speaking of four years ago&mdash;Croot was living at the White Gates, which had
been for a great many years the residence of an old friend of my family who
knew the Verity family well. Verity was a splendid specimen of a business man,
upright and honourable, as his father had been before him. But he was a little
too old-fashioned for modern business, and so he gave up the concern many years
before Croot was heard of, and retired to the Continent. But that has very
little to do with what I am about to say. It was through my old friend that I
came to know Croot, and it was he who induced me to begin speculating."</p>
<p>"In copper mines?" Rust asked.</p>
<p>"Well, not at first, that came afterwards. Then there was a day when Croot
came to me and told me all about Broken Points. According to his account, there
was no copper mine like it in the world. He had exclusive information, and a
controlling interest. The figures were so splendid that I was fairly carried
off my feet, and I suppose I was excited, too, in the belief that only Croot
and myself and the mining engineer knew the real value of that wealth. I may
say that in those days the company was not even formed. I was advised to take
up debentures."</p>
<p>"That seems sound advice," Rust said.</p>
<p>"So I thought at the time. There were to be a thousand debentures of
&pound;100 each, and of these I took four hundred. You might think it was a mad
thing to do, but I did it. Not all at once, mind you, but as a result of scores
of conversations extending over many weeks. The reports were so alluring that I
was fairly carried off my feet. I realized all I had, I even mortgaged my old
house where the Langleys had lived for four centuries, to find the money. But
that was not the worst. As time went on I began to invest in ordinary shares,
until I was seriously crippled. But that did not trouble me, because I knew
that directly the truth came out I should be able to sell my shares to get
everything back, and give me a handsome balance, so that with ordinary good
fortune I should be a very rich man. Not that I really wanted more than I had,
but you know, my dear boy, how that fever grows upon you. Well, I had my
debentures; they were brought to me, a few at a time, by Croot
himself&mdash;just the ordinary bearer bonds with coupons attached, and these I
deposited with my banker. I gave Croot my cheques personally, and he always
insisted upon giving me a receipt for them. I thought that looked very
straightforward, especially as the receipts not only mentioned the amount of
the bonds, but actually quoted the numbers on them."</p>
<p>The major paused and lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>"Well, so it went on until
the crash came. I was informed that the whole thing was a fraud from beginning
to end, that the consulting engineer had fooled all concerned to the top of
their bent, and that he had realized his own share of the plunder and
disappeared. Croot came and told me that one night in my own library. He told
me that he was as hard hit as I was, and that if he had not had an exceedingly
prosperous business of his own, he would have been ruined. I must say he acted
his part splendidly. There were tears in his eyes when he offered to make good
as far as possible. But, of course, as a man of honour, I could not listen to
that. Pat was more or less a child at the time, so it was not difficult to keep
the truth from her."</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure you did, dad?" Pat asked softly.</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate I thought so, my dear. But let me get on. I was
absolutely ruined, and I realized that the old place and all that it contained
would have to go. And then one day, quite by accident, I learnt something which
aroused my suspicions. I met a fellow victim and he gave me certain
information. I went to my bank, and brought those debentures down here. And
what do you think I found, Geoffrey?"</p>
<p>"I haven't the remotest idea," Rust said.</p>
<p>"I found that those debentures were forgeries. You see, there were only a
thousand of them altogether, which means that each separate debenture would be
numbered from 1 to 1,000. When I came to look at my own bonds, I found that the
first number was 1,200."</p>
<p>"Is that really so?" Rust exclaimed. "Major, I should very much like to see
those bonds myself."</p>
<p>"I dare say you would," the major said a little forlornly. "But
unfortunately I can't tell you where they are, neither can I tell you where
those receipts that I had from Croot are hidden. That, my dear boy, is just
where my memory fails me. I am as strong and vigorous as ever I was, and my
mind is as clear as yours. At least, it would be but for a queer hiatus here
and there, little blind mental spots which baffle me. No, I know I didn't
destroy them; I put them away somewhere very carefully, so that I should be
able to confront Croot with them in my own time, and in a place of my own
choosing. That they are still extant I am certain, but where? Ah, that's the
rub. I shall recollect in time, in fact there are occasions when I dream of the
exact spot, and when I come to myself again my mind is a blank on the subject.
But curiously enough, these dreams always come to me when I am dozing in my
chair here after lunch. Do you know, Geoff, I have only the vaguest idea of how
I got to the Moat House the other night, and incidentally nearly killed Croot.
I must have been walking in my sleep, a sort of unconscious drama."</p>
<p>"That wouldn't altogether account for it," Rust said.</p>
<p>"No, perhaps not; but I was there, and I knew I was there directly Pat
mentioned the matter to me. Now, why?"</p>
<p>"I think that is pretty plain, sir," Rust said. "You got up in the middle of
the night, half-asleep and half-awake, with the intention of going to the Moat
House to find those documents. You must have concealed them somewhere there,
and in certain phases of your mind you know exactly where to put your hands
upon them. You see, you know every inch of the Moat House, and there isn't a
scrap of your old furniture that does not stand exactly where it did when you
were a boy. Surely there must be some&mdash;"</p>
<p>The major held up his hand suddenly.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right," he said almost fiercely. "Secret hiding-places...queer
old corner cupboards...but it's all gone again. It will come back to me some
day."</p>
<p>He lay back in his chair for a few minutes in painful thought, then his brow
cleared once more.</p>
<p>"You must come and talk this over again," he said. "Though perhaps I had
better tell you the rest. I was waiting on the night of my seizure to confront
Croot in the library with his rascality when I was stricken down. I suppose I
was too wrought up, and that nature took her full penalty. But it was a
marvellous escape for Croot, because I had everything ready for him, and I was
standing up to get it when the crash came. Ah well, it will be my turn before
we have finished."</p>
<p>"What a hypocrite he must be," Pat cried. "He came to me, when everybody
thought that you would not live many weeks longer and when all the doctors said
that your mind would never come back to the normal, and he told me that he had
implored you over and over again not to dabble in speculations. He told me that
he had not the remotest idea that you had invested a penny in anything, and I
thought he was acting splendidly when he came forward and gave a fancy price
for the Moat House just as it stood. I shall never be able to go back to Great
Bower Street again."</p>
<p>"But you must," the major said harshly. "You must go on as if nothing had
happened. I will tell you why presently. So you see, Geoff, how that man robbed
me of all I possessed, and bought my old home with my own money. And now
perhaps you will be able to help me to get it back again."</p>
<p>"I think there is little doubt about that," Rust said grimly. "I was telling
you just now that I know a good deal about the mining market, and this you may
take from me as correct. The Broken Point Mine was a sound one, the whole thing
was an audacious swindle, and now that it is forgotten, Broken Points have
blossomed into Kamaloo Copper Trusts, with Croot holding nine-tenths of the
stock. Not in his own name, but it is his; and my partner whom I spoke about
just now is in a position to prove it. But we must not be too hasty over this
business, major; we will give Croot a little more rope, and if, in the
meantime, there is anything else I can do for you, you have only to command my
services."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the major cried eagerly. "There were certain letters that Croot
wrote to me, private letters which I destroyed at the time as being of no
value. But, of course, they went through Croot's letter book, and if I could
get hold of that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You shall," Rust said. "I know where all the old letter books are kept in
the basement at Great Bower Street. I will make a note of this and look them
up. If you can give me the approximate dates, I shall find them if they still
exist. And that they do exist, I have not the slightest doubt. It won't be an
easy business, but you can rely upon me, even if I have to turn burglar myself
to get the volume in question."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE LETTER BOOK</h2>
<p>"And that is about all, I think," Major Langley said, in summing up the
situation. "You know now how that scoundrel Croot took advantage of my business
ignorance and my confidence in him."</p>
<p>"But that is a long way from being all," Rust replied. "It seems to me that
we are only just beginning. A great many things are becoming plain. Croot took
you for a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Fool," the major snapped, as Rust hesitated. "I might just as well say so
at once, because it is quite true. And yet, mind you, I was not quite so
densely ignorant as Croot imagined. I had learnt a good deal about the ways of
the city, especially with regard to public companies. But where I made the
mistake was in entirely trusting that man. Of course, I could bring him to his
knees if I had the necessary proofs, but unfortunately I put them away so
carefully that I have forgotten where to find them. But I don't see how we can
do without."</p>
<p>"I am not so sure of that," Rust said after a thoughtful pause. "As far as I
recollect, the Broken Point Company went into liquidation. There was nothing
for their unfortunate creditors, and probably the official receiver sold the
assets for a few pounds. But don't forget this, major, the records are all
there in the Court of Bankruptcy. Those papers are never destroyed, and it
seems to me that if you will allow me to place the matter in the hands of some
smart solicitor we can dig out all we want from the archives. Do you happen to
remember who the secretary of the Broken Point Company was?"</p>
<p>"Well, in the early days, Croot himself. He wasn't the big man then that he
is now, and it was necessary to save expense."</p>
<p>"Ah, in that case he would give all the orders for printing and so on. It
would be his business to see that the debentures were turned out by some
respectable firm of lithographers. Then what was to prevent him ordering four
hundred more of those debentures than he needed? The printers would supply them
in all good faith, and number them, never dreaming for a moment that they were
meant to be used for the purposes of fraud. That is, I mean, the extra ones. I
know enough about this business to be aware that such documents generally bear
the initials of the firm who print them, and if we go to these people they will
no doubt examine their books, and, well, you see what I am driving at?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do," the major cried. "That is an excellent idea of yours,
Geoff. But how are we going to trace Croot's connexion with the Kamaloo
Company? We know now that he really is the company, in the name of a nominee;
but whether we can pin him down to that is another matter."</p>
<p>"Oh, you leave that to me," Rust said. "I have the very man to ferret out
all that sort of information. He is only a struggling person at present, but
Montagu Gordon will go a long way. He is the man I was just telling you about.
I find the money for those little flutters of ours, and he does the rest. Mines
are his particular line. If what we think is correct, Gordon will be sure to
find it out. I will see him to-morrow, and let you know the result in due
course. But we shall have to be patient. We must not spoil things by undue
haste."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can be patient enough," the major said grimly. "I have been playing
patience for the last year. But since you mention prudence, don't you think it
would be just as well if we said nothing about your engagement to Pat for the
present. I mean, that Vera shouldn't know. There are too many people in this
business already, and if anything should leak out&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think you are right there," Rust interrupted. "But you must allow me
to tell my friend Jack Ellis all about it. There are reasons why I must do so,
though I would rather not mention them at the moment. Croot is implicated in
other matters which we shall be able to prove in due course. There is a most
amazing conspiracy going on, quite apart from this affair of yours, but I am
not going to discuss that just now. As far as you are concerned, what I have to
do is to find a certain letter book. Now, can you give me an approximate
date?"</p>
<p>The major not only could, but did, and with this information in his pocket,
Rust presently took his departure. It was late the same evening before he had
an opportunity of seeing Ellis, who listened with the deepest interest to all
that his friend had to say. He smiled grimly as he pictured to himself what was
likely to happen when the proper moment came.</p>
<p>"Well, upon my word," he said. "Croot is a bigger rascal even than I thought.
Well, here we are, with two strings to our bow, and it would be odd if both of
them snapped. But you will have to be careful, my boy. If you get nosing about
in the basement of Great Bower Street, you may arouse Gilmour's suspicions. You
will have to be very cautious about that."</p>
<p>"Oh, I haven't forgotten that," Rust said. "I shall have to do it at night,
when I know that Gilmour is out of the way. You see, he often works late in his
office, and he has a spare key. Do you think I could get hold of a key?"</p>
<p>"I don't see why you shouldn't. Did you ever notice what sort of a lock
there is on the office front door?"</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate it isn't a Yale, or anything of that sort," Rust said.
"We are much too old-fashioned for that sort of thing. It is just an ordinary
spring latch. You see, there is nothing in the office except books, which are
locked in the safe, so there is no occasion to worry. What do you suggest?"</p>
<p>"Oh, in that case you can leave it to me," Ellis said. "I can provide you
within the next twenty-four hours with a key that will pick any ordinary lock.
You see, I have an extensive and peculiar acquaintance down Wapping way with
all sorts of shady people, including professional burglars, and for a few
shillings I can get anything in that line."</p>
<p>"Then that's settled," Rust said. "You post the key to my rooms, and I will
do the rest. I know where all those old letter books are, and I shall get away
with the volume I require and nobody any the wiser. And now, if you have
nothing more to say, I will go and see my man Gordon."</p>
<p>Mr. Montagu Gordon occupied a small office in a court leading off Fenchurch
Lane, which had an important-sounding address, and shared a telephone with a
dozen other similar rooms. It looked all right on paper, but up to now
represented very little in the way of business, though doubtless that would
come all in due course. Gordon himself was a little alert man with a head of
dark slippery hair, and a nose which spoke eloquently of the owner's
nationality. He was very beautifully turned out, a little too sleek and glossy
perhaps as to the nap on his hat and the polish on his boots. There was nothing
about him that suggested a Celtic origin, and probably his father before him
had borne a name remote enough from Gordon, and more reminiscent of the old
Jewish prophets. For the rest, he had achieved a public school education of
sorts, and his manners left nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>He welcomed Rust with great cordiality, as he always did when dealing with
men of sound financial position, and indeed his acquaintance with Rust had been
greatly to his advantage up to now. He had a fine instinct for the place where
the money lay, and he was astute enough to be perfectly honest in dealing with
a man who had given him the opportunity of climbing the first few rungs of the
ladder of fortune.</p>
<p>"Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Rust?" he asked.</p>
<p>Rust proceeded to explain. He had no intention of going into details,
neither did he mention Croot's name, except casually.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, I have got hold of a bit of information," he explained.
"There may be money in it, or there may not. I don't want to be more explicit
just now."</p>
<p>"Oh, quite right, quite right," Gordon applauded softly. "Never open your
mouth too wide, even with your business partners. But if there is any money
behind this business, I should like to be in it. But perhaps you had better
explain."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know whether there is any money in it or not," Rust said. "But,
at any rate, you will be paid, and if it turns out a big thing you will know
how to take care of yourself. For the moment it is like this. I want you to
find out all about Broken Points, and its subsidiary company, the Kamaloo
Copper Trust. I have every reason to believe that the whole thing is a swindle
from start to finish, and unless I am greatly mistaken, my esteemed employer,
Croot, is at the bottom of the whole conspiracy. In the early days of Broken
Points he acted as secretary to the company, but I think he resigned that
office long before Broken Points went into liquidation. Now, I want to know who
owns the bulk of the shares in the Kamaloo Trust."</p>
<p>"Well, I can tell you that much," Gordon grinned. "Croot does. You see, Mr.
Rust, mining shares are just in my line, and I have done a great deal with a
certain quarter which I always find to be reliable. The information has cost me
more than I can afford, but it will come back a thousandfold in due
course."</p>
<p>"That is just what I expected you to say," Rust said. "Now I want you to get
to the bottom of the whole business from start to finish. You can begin by
digging about the bankruptcy records of Broken Points, right down to the moment
when the Kamaloo Trust fell into Croot's hands. For that I am prepared to pay
handsomely without asking any questions, and I don't mind adding five hundred
pounds to that for your own trouble."</p>
<p>"That's a bet," Gordon said promptly. "Mind you, Croot is a big man now, and
this business will want a little delicate handling. But when Croot took over
Verity &amp; Co., he had a hard struggle at first to keep his head above water.
It has always been a mystery to me how he managed to make so much money with so
little business. But that is no affair of mine. I know he really is Kamaloo
Trust, but not in his own name. Mind you, I am not blaming him for that. As
secretary to the old bankrupt company he naturally does not want to be
identified with the new concern, which is going to turn out one of the biggest
propositions on the market. But you can rely upon me to get all you want, Mr.
Rust."</p>
<p>"I am perfectly sure of that," Rust said.</p>
<p>It was two days later before he got back to his proper quarters in the West
End, to find a small envelope awaiting him. There was nothing inside it but a
blank sheet of paper, and a peculiar looking key, which he placed carefully in
his hip pocket. Then the next night, when he knew that Gilmour was safely out
of the way down at Cray, he went off in the direction of the city, walking the
whole distance until he came at length to Great Bower Street. The road was
deserted, therefore it was an easy matter to fit the key in the lock and enter
the premises, which he did, carefully closing the door behind him, and taking
the precaution to push down the safety bolt in case of interruption, so that he
would be able to hide himself in one of the cellars in the basement. Not that
he had much fear of discovery, but he was taking no chances.</p>
<p>He made his way down to the cellars, where he turned on the electric light,
and immediately went to work on a vast pile of old books and dusty documents,
thrown more or less carelessly down in one corner. Here he knew were all the
records of the office for the past four or five years, dumped there casually
enough and quite forgotten. He took off his coat, and dropping on his knees,
began to search for what he required.</p>
<p>There were twenty or thirty letter books at least, and the best part of two
hours had elapsed before Rust found the particular volume of which he was in
search. It was the ordinary type of copy letter book, filled with hundreds of
flimsy sheets of tissue paper on which letters had been copied. Some of them
were in type, and some were in ordinary longhand; but most of them were signed
by Croot himself, therefore it was evident that Rust held in his hand one of
the volumes devoted to the private business of the head of the firm. Turning
more or less eagerly to the index, Rust found that the page therein devoted to
Major Langley was quite comfortably filled. By means of this index, he could
turn up the letters without making a long fatiguing search for them.</p>
<p>There was no hurry; it was late at night, the whole city seemed to be
asleep, and there was practically no chance of being disturbed. Rust sat down
on a pile of books, and commenced to read some of the letters at his leisure.
He read through a score or two before a grim smile crossed his face.</p>
<p>"My word," he murmured to himself. "Croot must have been very sure of his
ground to leave records like this hanging about. He probably regards the major
as an utter fool. These letters in Croot's own handwriting prove that. Now,
fancy a clever scoundrel like that just throwing this book down in this glory
hole! He must have been mad not to have destroyed it. However, he is not likely
to get a chance of doing that now."</p>
<p>With the air of a man who is perfectly satisfied with himself, Rust put the
letter book on one side and proceeded to reduce the pile of volumes to
something like the order in which he had found them. He was not going to take
any risks of anyone finding out that some curious person had been investigating
there. He had just put on his coat and was about to turn of the light, when
something on the floor of the room arrested his attention. He stooped down to
examine it closely, and saw that here was a large flat stone, such as was
generally used to cover the top of an old well. He could see that there were
cracks round the sides, and in the same spirit of curiosity he lifted the stone
from its place.</p>
<p>"Hello," he said to himself, "what have we here? A flight of steps and an
underground passage. A proper hiding-place for people engaged in robbing the
river traffic. I think I had better see a little further into this."</p>
<p>With the aid of a box of wooden vestas, Rust explored the steps and the
passage leading from them into the big underground vault which he correctly
judged to be exactly under the ruined building that stood on Crombies Wharf. He
was astute enough to drop each match-end in his pocket directly it had gone
out, so that no trace of his visit might be seen.</p>
<p>He came presently to the large echoing vault with its dirty pool of water,
and floating on it was the motor-boat that Gilmour and his confederates used
for their nocturnal expeditions. But this was not the only object that met
Rust's eager gaze as he looked about him by the dim light of a match. At one
end of the great underground cavern was a pile of various sorts of merchandise
in cases and bales. There were hundreds of these altogether, and Rust marked
them with a glittering eye.</p>
<p>"Stolen property, every bit of it," he said to himself. "Now how the deuce
did it get here? It wasn't brought in through the front door, though possibly
it may be taken out that way. My word, I have struck Ali Baba's cave with a
vengeance. How interested Ellis will be to hear all about this. I must come
here again and bring him, not forgetting his friend, Inspector Lock."</p>
<p>Rust made his way thoughtfully up the stairs, and out into the street again
with his head in a whirl.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;FINDING THE PROOFS</h2>
<p>Mr. Gordon was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet where the
making of money was concerned, especially at a moment when a matter of
&pound;500 was something like financial stability to him, and accordingly he
got to work at once. If he could handle that money within the next week or so,
he could see his way to multiplying it tenfold at an early date. As yet, he was
operating in an underground fashion, much as a mole works; but when the hour
came, he fully intended to blossom out as a bold and audacious speculator on
lines that seemed to him to be sound.</p>
<p>Ever since he had been in business, he had been picking up information. He
knew all sorts of out-of-the-way secrets, little biographies of city people and
so forth, and these he would know how to turn to account in due season. Above
all, he specialized in the subterranean doings of various mining companies,
therefore he had only to turn up certain documents and at once put his hand
upon a few live facts in connexion with Broken Points.</p>
<p>At the end of the second day he had established the fact that the Broken
Point business had been brought into the city by a genuine prospector, who had
discovered that source of wealth for himself. He had met with the usual fate of
such pioneers, and after being kicked from pillar to post for many months, had
disposed of his concession for a nominal sum to Mortimer Croot, after which he
had gone back to America disgusted with his treatment and resolving never to
see the city again.</p>
<p>Apparently Croot had only half believed in the business himself. That was at
a time when he was struggling to make his way, and at a period when his
resources were strained to the uttermost to keep the firm of Verity &amp; Co.
above water. Then, seemingly, it had occurred to him that he might do something
with his property through the medium of a gullible and trustful public. With
that intention he had joined forces with a shady promotor who knew all the
ropes and exactly how far to go without coming within the meshes of the law,
and between the two of them they had put the Broken Point Company on the market
with a flaming prospectus which asked for &pound;100,000 in the form of a
thousand debentures of &pound;100 each, and half a million shares at a pound.
This had not produced very much, but quite sufficient to remunerate the
promoters for their enterprise. The scheme was launched just at a time when the
public were inclined to speculate, therefore a certain number of debentures
were taken, with a fair sprinkling of ordinary shares, so that when the
schemers came to reckon up the spoil they found that they had a good many
thousand pounds to divide. Then, in the ordinary course of events, Broken
Points went their way towards the inevitable bankruptcy, and in a few weeks the
whole thing was forgotten. It was the sort of thing that happens every day, and
will go on happening so long as there remains a roof to St. Paul's.</p>
<p>But Croot had a little scheme of his own which he did not disclose to his
partner. The money he had made more or less legitimately out of Broken Points
was just sufficient to preserve his financial credit, but Croot was going much
further than that. It seemed to him that he had a fine pigeon to pluck in Major
Langley, and he proceeded to do it effectually. It was an easy matter to get a
few more hundred debentures printed, and how he palmed these worthless
documents on his innocent victim has already been told. This once done, and the
major absolutely ruined, Croot forgot all about Broken Points for a time, at
any rate. Then a scrap of information came his way, which taught him the full
value of the original concession which in the early stages he had not believed
in for a moment. Broken Points had only been a means to an end, but Croot
became aware that it was an exceedingly valuable property. He purchased the
assets for a song through some tool of his, and in due course Broken Points
blossomed afresh as the Kamaloo Copper Trust with an entirely fresh board,
behind which loomed Croot, with a name that was not his own.</p>
<p>All this, except the sale of worthless debentures, Mr. Montagu Gordon
discovered in the course of a few hours. It was the sort of thing that excited
his admiration, as a smart piece of business which had nothing criminal about
it, that is, it did not come within the purview of the law. But though Rust had
not taken Gordon very deeply into his confidence, the latter knew by instinct
that there was more here than met the eye. He saw Rust the next day, and told
him all this.</p>
<p>"Yes, you have done very well," Rust said. "Far better than I expected in so
short a time."</p>
<p>"Are you going to prosecute?" Gordon asked. "Because I don't see that you
have a case. This is quite a common business in the city, as you know."</p>
<p>"I am quite aware of that," Rust said dryly. "When I hit our friend Croot it
will be in quite another direction. Still, all this is very valuable, and I
shall know how to use it when the time comes. You see, a friend of mine was a
shareholder in Broken Points to a very large extent&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you mean Major Langley?" Gordon asked.</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact I do," Rust said. "Though I should very much like
to know how you found that out."</p>
<p>"Quite easy, my dear sir, quite easy," Gordon said airily. "You see, I have
been poking about in the bankruptcy court records relating to Broken Points,
and the one shareholder who looms up largely is Major Langley, of the Moat
House, Cray. He seems to have been a very heavy holder of debentures."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is the very point," Rust said. "He was, and between ourselves, I
have the very gravest doubts over those debentures. Major Langley was ruined
over that business, and if I can show misrepresentation and fraud, we ought to
be in a position to compel Croot to disgorge under threat of a prosecution.
From what I gather, he is in a position to pay."</p>
<p>"There is not the slightest doubt about it," Gordon said. "You can rely upon
the accuracy of my information when I tell you that Croot is quite a rich man.
Goodness knows how he did it, but the fact remains that the real stuff is
there. Now, can I help you over the matter of those debentures?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can try, at any rate," Rust said. "I want to know what firm of
law stationers printed them, and who gave the order. Wouldn't it be the
secretary of the company?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. And that reminds me that in the early days Croot himself filled
that office."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is just what I want to get at," Rust said. "Now if a dishonest
secretary was prepared to take risks, and ready to put money in his pocket at
all hazards, what is there to prevent him from ordering an extra hundred or two
of those bearer bonds with coupons attached, and getting rid of them himself
amongst his friends. Of course, I know it is a dangerous game, but if that
secretary happened to know that the coupons on the genuine bonds would be
valueless before the next interest was due, and that it would be useless for
any banker to send them in for payment, I don't see that the risk would be so
great after all."</p>
<p>Gordon whistled softly between his teeth.</p>
<p>"Is that the way the land lies, eh?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I think so," Rust replied. "Now, can you find out for me who printed those
debentures? I don't mind increasing your fee if you can manage to tell me
that."</p>
<p>"It would be robbing you," Gordon smiled. "The thing is too easy. You seem
to have forgotten that all the creditors of Broken Points filed their
statements of claim with the official receiver, and that they are on record in
the bankruptcy court. All these rotten companies depend very largely on their
printers for help in the way of circulars and prospectuses and share
certificates, and so on. In the course of an hour, I am perfectly certain I can
tell you the name of the firm who were responsible for the Broken Point
printing. I will run round now if you like, and let you know before lunch."</p>
<p>Gordon came back presently with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Just as I told you," he said. "Here you are. There is the name of the firm
who did all the printing, and, what is more, they never got a penny for it.
Shall I see them, or will you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I think I will go myself," Rust said.</p>
<p>"Very well. Now, let me give you a further hint. These law stationers are in
the habit of issuing printed order forms, which are generally signed by the
secretary of the company who is doing business with them. These, of course,
they file for future reference, and it is pretty certain that the firm in
question will be quite ready to produce them for you if you can show that you
are not merely asking out of idle curiosity. More than that, I shall be greatly
surprised if you don't discover that those printed order slips are all signed
by Croot."</p>
<p>Rust went off presently and dropped into a large establishment in Chancery
Lane, where he briefly stated his business, and he found himself presently
talking to one of the partners.</p>
<p>"Of course, Mr. Rust," he said. "We are largely in the hands of our clients,
and occasionally we do make a pretty bad debt. You see, printing shares and
certificate debentures is very expensive work, and we charge accordingly. We
were badly hit over Broken Points, and received nothing in consideration of a
debt of some hundreds of pounds. If you can show us a way to get some of this
back I shall be grateful. But I am not sanguine."</p>
<p>"I am quite sure I can," Rust said. "I believe I am on the track of a most
amazing fraud, and if so, then you will get your money, even as a matter of
precaution. I wonder if you would mind looking up your order forms from the
secretary of Broken Points and letting me run my eye over them."</p>
<p>"Certainly," Mr. Egerton said. "If you will give me a quarter of an hour, I
will find the documents for you."</p>
<p>He came back presently with a sheaf of printed order forms duly filled in,
and signed in every instance in the name of Mortimer Croot. Rust turned these
over until he came at length to the leaf dealing with the debenture bonds. His
face was quite expressionless, but he drew a long breath as he saw that the
order was for 1,500 of these, and not 1,000, as authorized by the Articles of
Association of the Broken Points Company.</p>
<p>Here was evidence enough to damn Croot a hundred times over. With that paper
in his hands, Rust could have gone to the criminal himself and compelled him
there and then to restore every penny of the money he had lured from the
major's pocket.</p>
<p>"I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Egerton," he said. "You know who I am,
and I am sure my father's name must be familiar to you. If you will trust me
with this document for a few days, I will see that you get your money."</p>
<p>"Well, in that case," Egerton said, "you can keep it altogether. I am not
concerned with anything right or wrong&mdash;all I want is to be paid for my
work."</p>
<p>Rust went off in triumph, and in the course of the afternoon met Ellis and
told him all that had happened, including his adventure in the vaults under the
offices in Great Bower Street. It was an interesting story that he had to tell,
and Ellis listened to it without comment until the tale was completed.</p>
<p>"Well, upon my word, you haven't been wasting your time," he said. "This is
great, my boy, absolutely great. Looks to me as if we had got Croot in the
hollow of our hands. Whatever happens, the poor old major will be righted
again, and it won't be long before he is back at the Moat House once more.
However, we can talk about all that later on. But don't you think that Lock
ought to know all about that underground storehouse?"</p>
<p>"I do," Rust agreed. "You had better come round this evening and have some
dinner with me, and I will get Lock to join us. He will come fast enough when I
let him know what is going on."</p>
<p>Lock was willing enough, so that just before seven o'clock the three of them
foregathered in Rust's rooms, and over a tempting little meal discussed their
plan of campaign.</p>
<p>"Upon my word, gentlemen," Lock said, "you two ought to be in the
profession. I could not have done it any better myself. I have laid a little
plant of my own, which I will tell you about in due course. It is only a sort
of side show, but I have contrived to get a hint dropped in the proper quarter,
and I shall be very surprised if, before long, our friend Gilmour doesn't come
nibbling after the cheese. Still, it doesn't much matter. Now, when do you
think will be a good opportunity for me to come with you to Great Bower Street,
and run over the pirate's lair for myself?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say to-morrow night," Rust said. "Gilmour is booked to dine
and sleep at the Moat House. He has been doing that twice a week ever since
Croot has been laid up. He will be out of the way then, and the coast clear. If
you don't hear from me to the contrary, you had better meet Mr. Ellis and
myself at the corner of Great Bower Street to-morrow night at ten o'clock."</p>
<p>Lock was content to leave it at that, and at the appointed hour the three of
them entered the office in Great Bower Street and made their way by means of
the basement into the big underground vault that lay under Crombies Wharf. With
the aid of a powerful flash-light, Lock examined the place carefully.</p>
<p>"Well, this beats anything I have ever struck," he said. "No wonder those
chaps baffled us. But I should like to know how they manage to get all this
stuff away."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to know first how they got it here?" Rust asked dryly.
"We have got to find that out first. But what on earth has happened to the
boat?"</p>
<p>"What boat?" Lock asked. "Oh, I remember now. The boat that they use to
bring the stuff here. Looks to me as if they are off somewhere to-night, some
of them. But for the life of me, I can't see how they manage to get that boat
in and out. As far as I can see, the wall at the far end is absolutely
solid."</p>
<p>"But it can't be," Ellis insisted. "There must be some sort of grating that
lifts with the aid of machinery, and allows the boat to come in and out,
according to the state of the tide. If by any chance they could&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped speaking suddenly, as a sort of creaking noise fell on their
ears, and mysteriously a part of the back wall lifted and the nose of a
motorboat crept in. The flash-light was turned off and the three adventurers
slipped behind a pile of boxes, watching intently what was going on. Then they
saw a dozen or so small compact-looking cases placed on a ledge against one of
the walls, after which the boat disappeared as mysteriously as it had come, and
the wall over the opening dropped into its place again. Lock moved eagerly
forward and examined the freshly-deposited cases.</p>
<p>"Ah, we are in luck," he said. "This is part of the cheese I told you about.
We shall have them in the trap before long. But softly&mdash;we haven't got the
big rat yet."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;THE CASE OF CIGARS</h2>
<p>Lock looked about him with a keen professional eye. He was trying to
calculate exactly where he stood with regard to the position of the river in
connexion with the site of the offices in Great Bower Street. The passage from
the basement of the house to the big hiding-place under the ruined building on
Crombies Wharf was a long one, and consequently the small underground lake must
be some distance from the main street. With his knowledge of the locality, he
knew that he must be close to the river.</p>
<p>"What do you make of it?" he asked. "If I were to hazard a guess myself, I
should say that the Thames is just beyond that wall, and that there is a
slipway up which the boat comes, and is safely stowed away here at certain
states of the tide."</p>
<p>"There is not the slightest doubt about that," Ellis said. "Probably, at
very high spring tides, this vault is full of water, but that only happens in
October and March, and the tides are low just now. That is why these chaps can
use the place as a storage for their stolen goods until they can get them away.
But that must be rather a risky business."</p>
<p>"Unless, of course, the stuff is taken away in the same way that it comes,"
Rust suggested. "I don't think that even Gilmour would be audacious enough to
handle stolen property through the front door of the offices."</p>
<p>"I think you are right," Lock said. "The stuff is stored here until the
scent gets cold, and then fetched away again on a motor-launch when Gilmour has
disposed of it. But what a magnificent hiding-place. Who would have thought of
a secret lair like this right in the heart of the city? Now I begin to
understand why the man we know as Croot spent all the money he could rake
together to buy the business of Verity &amp; Co. But we need not go into that
yet. Mr. Rust, would you be good enough to count those neat little boxes which
have just arrived by underground express? I am curious to see what you make of
them."</p>
<p>The cases had been arranged on a shelf in a corner of the vault, whilst the
trio had been hiding there. They had seen the two men who had brought them by
the aid of their own flare-lamp, and there could be no possible mistake as to
which were the newly-arrived goods:</p>
<p>"I make nineteen of them," Rust said when he had finished.</p>
<p>"Ah, that is precisely what I wanted to hear," Lock chuckled. "There were
twenty of them. What I call ground bait. I had them laid so that those men
could pick them up, indeed, it was an absolute trap. And they walked into it,
just as I expected they would, because the man who carried the information was
one of my own particular familiars whom they probably regarded as just a fool
talking in his cups."</p>
<p>"But what are they?" Ellis asked.</p>
<p>"As fine a consignment of cigars as ever came from Cuba. They are separately
sealed up hermetically, and I suppose each case contains about five thousand
altogether. As a matter of fact, they were lent me by a shipper who has
suffered a great deal lately, and when I assured him that he would get his
property back all right, he was quite enthusiastic in his desire to help. But
as I said just now, there were twenty cases, which means that those two men
have taken one for themselves. It was rather better than I had dared to hope
for, but you will see presently how it is going to help us. Mind you, I don't
take a great deal of credit to myself over this business, because most of that
belongs to you two gentlemen. It was Mr. Ellis who put me on the track first,
and Mr. Rust who brought me here. After that, I applied the usual methods, and
they are going to prove quite sufficient for our purpose. Now, did either of
you happen to recognize either of those two men?"</p>
<p>"Not that I know of," Ellis said.</p>
<p>"Well, one of them was the man who drove Gilmour down to Cray on the night
when this drama properly commenced. He is the chap I told you about, Mr. Ellis,
and his name is George Pensum. He has a taxi-cab and a motor-lorry, and he
lives in a place close by which is called Ray's Mews. The other rejoices in the
name of Joe Airey. He it is who does all the rough work, and loads up the
stolen cargoes. I shall have them both laid by the heels before morning, and
if, as I hope, the missing case of cigars is found in Ray's Mews, our work is
as good as done. There is a long way to go yet, of course, but the rest is a
mere matter of patience. I don't think there is any occasion to stay here
longer."</p>
<p>"Then we had better get back to my rooms again," Rust suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," Lock said. "That reminds me, I have something to show you. I have
it in my pocket, but I forgot all about it when we were talking of coming down
to this place."</p>
<p>They crept cautiously up the passage into the office again, and being
assured that they were not watched, made their way back to Rust's lodgings.
There, when the cigarettes were lighted and the whisky and soda set out upon
the table, Lock drew from his pocket a long envelope from which he took what
appeared to be a magazine or periodical printed on thin paper.</p>
<p>"There you are, Mr. Rust," he said. "That is a copy of the <i>Oriental
Record,</i> a weekly illustrated paper published in Hong-Kong, and printed some
five years ago. On one of the pages you will find a photographic group that may
interest you."</p>
<p>Rust fluttered over the leaves eagerly until he came at length to a
photograph of a dozen people or so, evidently taken on the deck of some English
destroyer or gunboat.</p>
<p>"Why, here is a portrait of Gilmour," he cried.</p>
<p>Ellis bent eagerly over his friend's shoulder.</p>
<p>"It is more than that," Ellis cried. "It is the same photograph that I found
amongst Bill Avory's papers. I mean the photograph that had been cut from a
magazine, without the letterpress."</p>
<p>"Well, the letterpress is there now," Lock said. "And perhaps you will read
it for yourselves."</p>
<p>"Ah, now we know Gilmour's real name," Ellis said: "Evidently the central
figure in the group is Engineer-Lieutenant George Ray, and that picture was
taken on board the <i>Sharkstooth."</i></p>
<p>"Absolutely correct," Lock smiled. "We had a good deal of trouble to get
hold of that paper, but my people managed it, as I told you they would. As soon
as it came into my possession, I spent a few hours at the Admiralty looking up
the record of Engineer-Lieutenant George Ray. Now you can understand, Mr.
Ellis, how it comes about that the person we know as Gilmour was so interested
in all sorts of machinery. Hence the secret hiding-place in Greencorn Street,
and all those electrical appliances there."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," Rust said impatiently. "But tell us something more about the
man's mysterious past."</p>
<p>"I am just coming to that," Lock said. "Ray was dismissed the Service
ignominiously after an inquiry in which not only cheating at cards but a
particularly impudent forgery were proved against him. After that he
disappeared, and went to Canada, where, no doubt, he met our friend Croot. Out
there, beyond question, this conspiracy was hatched. But of course all that
will come out at the trial. To carry the matter a bit further, I may say that I
called at a certain garage to ascertain if that little account we know of had
been paid. I mean the bill we found in Greencorn Street, which George Pensum
had pushed under the door for Gilmour to find. You will hardly believe it
possible, but Gilmour actually paid it himself. He has been identified by the
man who owns the garage, which, strangely enough, is exactly opposite 17
Greencorn Street. So you will see that we are getting on. I don't want either
of you gentlemen to do anything for the next two or three days, because this is
precisely where I come on the stage again. I am going to make an arrest or two,
because it is necessary to have the men we saw to-night under lock and
key."</p>
<p>"Here, steady on, Inspector," Ellis said. "Don't you forget that I owe a
duty to my paper. If any of this leaks out, then I shan't get the exclusive I
have been paying for."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think you need have any fear about that," Lock laughed. "Those
men will be arrested and remanded in custody for a fortnight on a charge that
has nothing to do, apparently, with the daring robberies on the river. It will
be a case of suspicion of handling other people's property. I want to have
those men where Gilmour can't get at them. You shall have your scoop all right;
indeed, I am so grateful to you for what you have done that I am ready to go
out of my way to assist you."</p>
<p>"That's all right," Ellis said. "Now, if there is nothing else, I think I
had better be getting along. I want to see my editor to-night before he leaves
the office."</p>
<p>It was some time in the middle of the morning following that Inspector Lock,
together with one of his officers, walked into the small house in Ray's Mews,
and there arrested the man called George Pensum as he sat luxuriously over a
late breakfast.</p>
<p>"I have a warrant for your arrest," Lock said curtly. "You had better come
quietly."</p>
<p>"That be hanged for a tale," Pensum blustered. "What have I done? Let's have
a look at your warrant."</p>
<p>"There you are," Lock said curtly. "On a charge of receiving stolen
property. I am not going so far as to say you stole it yourself, but I have
every reason to believe that somewhere on the premises you have a case of
cigars, consigned to Johnson &amp; Company, of Crotched Friars."</p>
<p>It was largely a shot in the dark, but apparently was justified, for Pensum
dropped his blustering manner, and the cigarette that he had blatantly lighted
fell into his tea-cup. He said no more, nor did he move again until one of
Lock's subordinates appeared from somewhere upstairs with the missing case of
cigars in his arms. Lock successfully concealed a smile, for he knew now that
he was on absolutely safe ground. On the following morning Pensum duly appeared
before a magistrate and, on the application of the inspector, was remanded for
a fortnight without bail. An hour later Joe Airey was also in custody on a
somewhat similar charge. A week passed before Lock presented himself at the
police-station, and asked to see Pensum in his cell.</p>
<p>He found him exceedingly nervous and subdued, after seven days' more or less
solitary confinement, during which time he had been deprived of the strong
drink that his soul loved, and, therefore, his nerves were somewhat shaken.</p>
<p>"What do you want with me?" he asked sullenly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't want to talk unless you do," Lock said. "You might be disposed
to give me a bit of information, or you might not. That is entirely for you to
say. Now, I know a good deal, George, a good deal more than you imagine. You
are a goodish bit of a rascal, but you can't compare with the people behind
you. And I may remind you there are far more serious charges against a man than
stealing a box of cigars. There is murder, for instance, and if not exactly
murder, there is another similar, which, as you are probably aware, carries
much the same penalty. For instance, if I commit a murder and I employ you
afterwards to get rid of the body, and you are convicted, you are just as
likely to hang as I am."</p>
<p>Pensum sat there, gazing at Lock with wide open staring eyes. Every vestige
of colour had drained out of his face, and Lock could see that he was trembling
from head to foot. The inspector's line of diplomacy was not quite orthodox,
perhaps, but he knew the man he had to deal with, and shaped his course
accordingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't answer unless you like," he said. "I am not asking you to
incriminate yourself, but if you like to tell me a few things, as I am sure you
can, I will make it my business to put in a good word for you when the time
comes. By the way, do you know anything about Greencorn Street?"</p>
<p>Pensum gasped. A queer spasm crossed his face and he seemed to have
considerable difficulty in swallowing.</p>
<p>"Where is Greencorn Street?" he managed to say.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me you don't know? Don't know the street where you have
your own repairs done? Never had a bill there you couldn't pay? What's the
matter with your memory, George? Wasn't there a time, a day or two ago, when
you wrote a note to a friend of yours and pushed it under the door of 17
Greencorn Street? And wasn't there a bill in that note which your friend
subsequently paid? Just think, George, just think."</p>
<p>Pensum looked up almost pitifully, and his lips shook.</p>
<p>"Don't you be 'ard upon me, guv'nor," he said. "I ain't as bad as some
folks, and a pore chap's got to live."</p>
<p>"And not a bad living, either," Lock said. "Now, look here, George, you
haven't done an honest day's work for years, yet you have a taxi-cab and a
motor-lorry which are never off your premises unless it is at night. I suppose
you do drive your taxi-cab at night sometimes? Ever take a customer as far as a
place called Cray, for instance? I mean, a customer who was in a desperate
hurry, and rather the worse for wear. Come, George, I think it will pay you to
be candid. I want you to tell me all about that night, some three weeks ago,
when a man came to you in a desperate state, and you drove him as far as Cray.
I need not mention the man's name, though I know it as well as you do."</p>
<p>Pensum looked up with a certain grudging admiration.</p>
<p>"Strike me pink, guv'nor, you're a fair wonder," he said. "It looks as if I
was in for it, and if so be as you can make it a bit easy for me, then I dunno
as if it wouldn't be better to tell the truth. I did go down to Cray one
night."</p>
<p>"You can speak freely," Lock said. "I am not promising to save you
altogether, but I think I can keep you from dangling at the end of a rope in
the yard of Wandsworth Prison one of these fine mornings. And now you can go
on."</p>
<p>Quite eagerly Pensum told his story. He related with a lurid wealth of
detail the various incidents that happened on the night that Gilmour had made
his successful dash for the Moat House, and how he had provided his fare with a
change of clothing, until at length he had finished, and stopped with an
imploring eye turned in the direction of his tormentor.</p>
<p>"I 'ope you are going to believe me, guv'nor," he said fawningly. "It's
Gawd's truth, it is indeed."</p>
<p>"So far as you have gone, I am sure it is," Lock said. "But we haven't come
to the serious part yet. You are not going to tell me that the night we were
speaking about is the only occasion on which you placed your taxi-cab at the
disposal of the man whose name we need not mention. Now think, George, just
think, and for your own sake, tell me the truth."</p>
<p>"I never," Pensum said. "I never."</p>
<p>"Well, it's your last chance. Did you never go to Hampstead late one night
after visiting Greencorn Street, with something in your taxi-cab that you don't
like to think about?"</p>
<p>Pensum jumped to his feet with the wild white horror in his eyes, and stared
dreadfully at his questioner. Then he flung his hands high above his head and
collapsed on the floor.</p>
<h2><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;THE HIDING-PLACE</h2>
<p>The offices of Verity &amp; Co. closed promptly at midday on Saturdays, and
usually a few minutes afterwards the premises were deserted till ten o'clock on
the Monday. On this particular morning in April, most of the staff had already
departed, and Gilmour was packing up his papers, when a visitor interrupted
him. He bustled in confident and alert and obviously sure of his ground.</p>
<p>"Name of Beaven," he said. "Representing Markham Brothers. Sorry to detain
you, Mr. Gilmour, but a rather unpleasant thing has happened, and no doubt you
will be able to put it right."</p>
<p>Gilmour was on his guard in a moment. He scented danger here, and that
prominent jaw of his was thrust slightly forward, but not in an aggressive way
as yet. He wanted time to think.</p>
<p>"Half a minute," he said. "Just let me sign these letters, and then I am
entirely at your disposal. I want to catch a train at Cannon Street in about
forty minutes, but no doubt we can finish by then...Now, Mr. Beaven, I am ready
for you."</p>
<p>With that Gilmour pushed his cigarette case across the table and smiled at
his visitor quite amiably.</p>
<p>"Well, it's like this," the man called Beaven replied. "A day or two ago we
purchased through our brokers some cases of fine Havana cigars, which I
understand came through you."</p>
<p>Gilmour could see the danger plainly enough now, and he was thankful that it
had not been sprung upon him too suddenly.</p>
<p>"Is that a fact?" he asked. "Not that I am disputing your word for a moment.
I don't call the stuff to mind, but then we deal with all sorts of things and
one cannot recollect everything. Still, I can look it up if you like."</p>
<p>"No need to do that," the other said. "I can assure you it is exactly as I
state."</p>
<p>"How many cases of cigars, did you say?"</p>
<p>"Nineteen, to be exact. Yes, I am sure it was nineteen."</p>
<p>Gilmour knew all about it now. These were the cases of cigars that his
confederates had picked up on a certain evening when working in his absence, on
the information he had supplied to Airey and Pensum himself. He recollected now
that there had been twenty cases, though they had informed him that one of
these had been lost in transit. He had said nothing about it at the time,
though he had had a shrewd idea that the missing case had been hypothecated by
the thieves as their share of the plunder.</p>
<p>"Well, please go on," he said.</p>
<p>"We bought those cases of cigars for a wealthy client in Spain. Quite by
accident they were seen as they were being shipped by a member of the firm of
Johnson &amp; Co., who claimed them for their own. Not only that, but he proved
it. He said that the goods were stolen on their way up the Thames, and when we
came to make inquiries, we found that they had made their way into your hands.
Of course, I am not suggesting for an instant, Mr. Gilmour, that there is
anything wrong as far as you are concerned, but there you are. You must have
bought them in all innocence from some one who got hold of them dishonestly.
There can be no other explanation."</p>
<p>"Very unpleasant," Gilmour murmured. "I think I recollect something of the
transaction now. I am under the impression the cigars came to us from a Hamburg
correspondent. But I will look into the matter on Monday and let you know. What
view do Johnson's take of it? I suppose they have consulted the police?"</p>
<p>Gilmour asked the question in the most casual fashion, not for a moment
displaying the anxiety that he was feeling, for he knew that a great deal
depended on the reply. This was the first time that the scheme had gone wrong
since he had started on his career of crime in Great Bower Street, and he was
feeling the strain.</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind," Beaven said. "We are all fed up with the police.
These robberies go on almost daily, and nothing happens. Johnson's only care
about being recompensed for their loss, and have named an amount which is but
little more than your charge. Of course, we shall have to make that good and,
in our turn, we naturally look to you to see us right. It's a matter of
business, Mr. Gilmour, and nothing else."</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite understand," Gilmour said, speaking with a sense of relief that
he managed to hide perfectly. "I quite agree with you as to what you say about
the police. We have given them up in despair. You had better see Johnson's and
tell them that if they will send us their invoices we will forward them a
cheque for the full amount. In our turn we shall get the money back from the
Hamburg correspondent or whoever else it was that sold the cigars to us."</p>
<p>"That is very satisfactory," Beaven said. "I will tell Johnson's what you
say, and they can communicate with you direct. Stop a moment, wouldn't it be
just as well if you sent us the cheque and leave us to settle with Johnson's.
In that case, we can all keep our own counsel and say no more about it."</p>
<p>They settled it in that way, and Gilmour walked thoughtfully in the
direction of Cannon Street Station. He had come very well out of an exceedingly
tight place, but all the same he was worried and uneasy in his mind, because he
could see that something had gone wrong somewhere, and that suspicious nature
of his feared a trap. And yet the whole thing was natural enough. However, he
would have time to think the matter over when he was alone in the train. Then
later on he could discuss the matter with Croot, and guard against any such
alarming accident in the future.</p>
<p>But he was not destined to get as far as Cray alone. Hardly had he taken his
place in an empty first-class carriage before he was joined by Rust and Ellis.
They were going down to Cray for the week-end for golf, and were staying at the
Cray Arms Hotel. They talked on general topics, apparently in the most friendly
fashion, though they were all thankful enough to part when they came to the end
of their journey, for Gilmour's mind was full of the disturbing incident of the
morning, and the other two men found it difficult enough to appear on
absolutely friendly terms with the man whom they knew to be a thorough-paced
scoundrel, and whose disgrace and exposure they were planning with the
assistance of Lock.</p>
<p>Croot, who was still more or less confined to the house with the trouble
that seemed to cling to him obstinately, welcomed Gilmour at the
luncheon-table. As Vera was there, it was impossible for the moment for the
conversation to be about anything but the most ordinary subjects and, moreover,
there was a good deal of constraint between herself and Gilmour, as there had
been ever since the night when he had asked her to marry him and she had
refused.</p>
<p>"Are you playing golf this afternoon?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Vera replied. "I have strained my wrist. And besides, I
promised to go down later on and help Pat Langley in the cottage garden."</p>
<p>"You will be back to tea, I hope?" Gilmour suggested.</p>
<p>Vera said that she might, and then presently she left the two men together
in the library. As soon as the door was closed behind them and the cigarettes
lighted, Gilmour told his story.</p>
<p>"Now, how on earth did you manage to make a blunder like that?" Croot
demanded. "It might have been fatal."</p>
<p>"Well," Gilmour growled. "You can't go on for ever without making a few
mistakes. I don't like it, Croot, I don't like it a bit. I can smell a
trap."</p>
<p>"I dare say you can, though it looks to me more like a piece of sheer bad
luck. You have managed up to now to work it well enough through those people at
Rotterdam, and I don't see why you shouldn't go on. We shall have to pay
Johnson &amp; Co., of course, through Beaven, as you have arranged, but after
all our loss is only the trifling sum by which their price exceeds that at
which we sold. Not that it makes much difference to me, whatever happens."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you are all right in any case," Gilmour sneered. "Nobody can touch
you. Mr. Croot has a high reputation, and if the unfortunate Mark Gilmour is
laid by the heels, then nobody will be more grieved and surprised than his
confiding employer. Wonderfully innocent, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we have had this thing over half a dozen times," Croot said
impatiently. "You knew from the very first exactly what the understanding was,
and if you don't like to go on, why, I am ready to drop it to-morrow. We have
both done exceedingly well out of the business, and though the average man
never has quite enough, however rich he may be, I shan't hurt if I never make
another penny. I will make a bargain with you. If you like, I will turn over
the business of Verity &amp; Co. to you free gratis and for nothing. You shall
have the whole thing exactly as it stands. I will resign the city entirely, and
spend the rest of my life as a country gentleman. I suppose when we come to
balance up accounts there will be at least &pound;40,000 coming to you, and you
would be a fool if you did not keep straight in future."</p>
<p>"It sounds tempting," Gilmour said. "But it doesn't quite fit in with my
ambitious ideas. I set out in the beginning to make &pound;100,000, and when I
get hold of that, then I will accept your offer. Meanwhile, I prefer things to
go on as they are."</p>
<p>Croot shrugged his shoulders carelessly.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "Just as you like, but don't forget the fable of the
pitcher that went too often to the well. It is a matter of indifference to me,
because it is a case of heads I win tails you lose. The more money you make,
the greater my share, and considering that I am running no risks whatever, I am
quite content, whichever way you take it."</p>
<p>Gilmour wandered out into the garden presently just in time to intercept
Vera on her way to the cottage. He walked as far as the gate with her, and then
strolled across the golf links. He had hardly reached the Club House when he
met Rust, who had just finished his round, and was going to call upon the
Langleys.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen the old gentleman for some time," he explained. "I hear he
is much better."</p>
<p>"So I am told," Gilmour said. "But it is only a flash in the pan, I expect.
He will never be his old self again."</p>
<p>Rust smiled as he went his way. He stopped to say a few words to Vera and
Pat, who were very busy planting out a spring border, and then he walked into
the sitting-room of the cottage.</p>
<p>The major was eagerly awaiting him. He was sitting up, alert and vigorous,
in his chair, his eye was clear and bright, and there was about him no
suggestion of the confirmed invalid.</p>
<p>"Well," he asked eagerly. "Is there any news?"</p>
<p>"A good deal," Rust said. "But first of all, if you don't mind, I will close
the window. It doesn't much matter if Pat hears what we are talking about, but
she is not alone, and I don't want Vera to gather too much just at present. She
looks worried and anxious enough in any case."</p>
<p>"Which is only natural," the major said. "She feels that there is something
mysterious going on, and I am sure she resents being bound to secrecy. Sooner
or later she must know everything, of course, poor child. Meanwhile, there is
much to do, and I am getting very anxious to have everything out. Now, if you
have anything to tell me, I shall be glad to hear it."</p>
<p>"I have a great deal to tell you," Rust said. "To begin with, I have proved
beyond the shadow of a doubt that all you told me is absolutely correct. You
were cruelly robbed by Croot in the most cold-blooded way, and when you told me
that he had swindled you out of thousands of pounds by means of forged
debentures, you were stating the case exactly. I think I said something to you
about a man I know who is exceedingly clever in getting to the bottom of
swindles of this sort. At any rate, I consulted him on the matter, and more or
less took him into my confidence. He ferreted it all out. He discovered that
Croot actually ordered five hundred extra copies of the debentures in his
capacity as secretary, and what is more, at the present moment I have the order
form for those bonds signed by Croot in my pocket."</p>
<p>The major jumped excitedly to his feet, then he sat down again at a sign
from his companion.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Geoff," he said. "But I forgot myself for a moment. That
statement of yours startled me. Do you mean to say that you have Croot's actual
signature?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I do. Croot ordered those debentures on purpose to deliver them
to you. Moreover, they are numbered exactly as yours are. Now, I have been
going into the thing carefully, and I find that under their Articles of
Association, Broken Points Company had only power to issue a thousand
debentures. Therefore, the swindle is plain for a child to see. If you can only
produce those bonds, we can go to Croot to-morrow morning and compel him to
disgorge every penny of his ill-gotten gains. Mind you, he can find it, because
he is a rich man, quite apart from the money he extracted from you. There is
not the least reason why we shouldn't make him pay the money you put down for
your ordinary shares as well. That would be some thousands more, wouldn't
it?"</p>
<p>The major lay back in his chair with a smile upon his lips. Already in
imagination he was seeing himself back at the Moat House, basking in the
sunshine of the old prosperity with many years of health and happiness before
him.</p>
<p>"That is good hearing, Geoff," he said. "Very good hearing indeed. It will
be a fine day for me when I stand face to face with Croot, and denounce him for
the abandoned scoundrel that he is. And I am going to do it in the very room
where I was stricken down with the illness that has made me a hopeless wreck
all this time. I am going to turn him out of my library and drive him into the
gutter that he came from. It will be a great revenge."</p>
<p>"Oh, I have every sympathy with you," Rust smiled. "But we have a long way
to go yet. It will be time to talk like that when you can lay your hand on
those debentures."</p>
<p>The major smiled again, a deep inscrutable smile.</p>
<p>"Go on, Geoff," he murmured. "I don't think you have finished yet. I have an
idea you have much more to tell."</p>
<p>"I believe I have. To begin with, Croot is practically the owner of all the
shares in Kamaloo Copper Trust. He bought the assets of Broken Points through a
nominee, knowing perfectly well that he was purchasing a valuable property, and
swindling the original shareholders out of their rights. When you want me to
prove this I am quite prepared to do it. Moreover, I have found the letter-book
you spoke about containing copies of the originals signed by Croot himself. I
have read most of them through, and pretty damning documents they are. The book
is in my suit-case at the hotel, and I will let you have it before I go back to
town on Monday morning. Now, if you could only find those receipts you told me
about, with the numbers of the debentures on them, and the debentures
themselves, then we should be able to corner Croot at any time and bring him to
his knees."</p>
<p>The major leant forward and whispered under his breath.</p>
<p>"That is already done, Geoff," he said. "It has all come back to me. I can
put my hands on those papers when I please, because I know now exactly where
they are hidden. They are at the Moat House, and Croot is within a yard or two
of them every day. If he only knew, what would he say?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;IN THE TRAP</h2>
<p>Inspector Lock sat in his office a day or two later going over his facts and
putting them into logical order. So far as he could see there was nothing
wanting now, and he was in a position at any moment to make an important
arrest. At the same time he much preferred, if possible, to take Gilmour
red-handed, and for that purpose he had laid his plans accordingly. He had the
man called Pensum and the other confederate Airey by the heels, and it seemed
to him just possible that these two arrests might arouse Gilmour's suspicions
and prevent him from going any further, at any rate for the present. Pensum he
would have to detain in any case, but Airey had been arrested merely on
suspicion, without any definite charge against him, and he had been released on
his own recognizances with an intimation that he might or might not be wanted
again. At the same time he had been warned, and Lock knew from his subordinates
that Airey had made no attempt so far to communicate with Gilmour. Moreover,
Gilmour had been away for a day or two on business in the North of England, a
fact that suited Lock admirably, for it allowed him to make certain
investigations without the fear of Gilmour getting to hear about them. He would
therefore know exactly what to do when the time came, but the time was not
quite yet. He had waited until Gilmour got back to London again before
attempting further developments.</p>
<p>What he particularly wanted to do, of course, was to bring Croot within the
sweep of his net. But so far there was nothing definite against him, who
doubtless had taken every precaution to keep himself outside the shady
business, though Lock did not doubt for a moment that Croot was the brains of
the whole concern. It seemed impossible to believe that he could know nothing
about the underground passage and the small lake under Crombies Wharf where the
motor-boat was hidden, but while it was easy enough to suspect this, to prove
the matter was a different thing altogether. No doubt, if Gilmour was arrested,
Croot would be the very first to express his astonishment and indignation at
the way in which his manager had used the premises in Great Bower Street for
the purpose of those audacious robberies. Nor did Lock doubt that Croot and
Gilmour were working on sharing terms. He felt certain that Gilmour would take
his punishment without saying a word, and that when he had served his sentence
he would get away with his share of the plunder, which was the very last thing
that Lock wanted. He was not going to be satisfied until he could bring home
the robberies to both of them. There was no hurry, and he was going to wait
patiently enough until chance threw the proper opportunity into his way.</p>
<p>He had not seen Pensum since the morning when he had visited him in his
cell, and had seen him collapse when confronted by a certain suggestion. It was
not for him to force Pensum's confidence, nor had he attempted to do so. He had
left the man alone then, and had made no attempt to see him since. He did not
want it said that he had taken unfair advantage of a prisoner, which might
happen if Pensum was defended at his trial by some smart barrister. He had
therefore accordingly left matters to one of his subordinates, with
instructions to give Pensum every opportunity to speak, but at the same time to
be very careful not to approach him on the subject. Meanwhile, Pensum was under
remand on a charge of stealing the case of cigars from Messrs. Johnson &amp;
Co., and he was being given plenty of time in the solitude of his cell to make
up his mind what to do for the best.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Lock knew nothing of the other charge that was
hanging over Croot's head. With regard to Croot and Major Langley, Ellis had
had nothing to say to Lock. It was no business of the latter's, though it
probably would be before the major was through with his old enemy.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later a plain-clothes officer walked into Lock's office
and laid some papers on the table before him.</p>
<p>"I was just going to send for you, Jesson," Lock said. "I suppose you did
what I told you to do?"</p>
<p>"I have done everything, sir," the sergeant replied. "Everything is ready,
and I have every reason to believe that those people are planning to get hold
of the stuff. They know it is there, and they know that the thing is easy. It
is going to be a case of the cigars over again. Nice handy stuff in small
packages, and very easy for anyone to handle."</p>
<p>"Ah, saccharine, isn't it?" Lock asked.</p>
<p>"That's right, sir, saccharine it is. It will have to be removed to-morrow
night, because I have managed to convey to those chaps that the stuff will be
shifted before long. They jumped at it. It will be some time to-morrow night,
sir, certain."</p>
<p>"And we shall be there, Jesson, we shall be there," Lock said grimly. "I am
going to leave all the details to you. You can make arrangements with the
river-police to be in the right spot at the right time. Mind you, they are not
to make an arrest; they must let those fellows get away with the stuff, and
shadow them as far as the secret entrance to Crombies Wharf. We shall be
waiting downstairs for them, and the rest will be easy. It will be very hard
luck if we don't get Gilmour this time."</p>
<p>"Oh, he will be with them all right," Jesson said. "I know that much,
because our man is pretending to stand in with them, and he declines to deal
with anybody but a principal. He was told that he would see the principal
afterwards and get his money."</p>
<p>"'Um. I suppose we can trust him all right?"</p>
<p>"I think you can leave that to me, sir," Jesson smiled. "He has been
convicted once or twice, but it won't pay him to play us false, particularly as
we can lay him by the heels on another charge if he tries anything of the
sort."</p>
<p>"Yes, that sounds all right," Lock said. "Now, have you seen that man Pensum
lately?"</p>
<p>"I saw him only this morning, sir. I have seen him several times lately. Of
course, I was careful not to say anything to him, but just now he introduced
the subject himself. Sort of a confession it was. I don't think he had anything
to do with the death of Bill Avory. Avory was murdered by Gilmour at 17
Greencorn Street. As far as I can make out, he was lured there and deliberately
put out of the way. You see, sir, Avory recognized Gilmour that night on the
lighter about the time we first came into the business, and spoke to him by his
proper name. The recognition was mutual. I know this was so, because Pensum
told me. He did not get his information from Gilmour, but from the man who was
with Gilmour the night the lighter was raided. Of course, you can see how
awkward it was for Gilmour that he should be recognized by an old sailor who
had served with him on board&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, on board the <i>Sharkstooth.</i> His real name was George
Ray&mdash;Engineer-Lieutenant George Ray. I know all about that, Jesson. Yes, I
can quite understand why he wanted to close Avory's mouth. But go on, I am
interrupting you."</p>
<p>"Well, it's like this, sir. Avory was lured to Greencorn Street, never
guessing for a moment whom he was going to meet, or of course he never would
have gone. What happened there nobody quite knows, because those two men were
alone in the house together. Perhaps you know more about it than I do."</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I do," Lock said thoughtfully. "I have been over
17 Greencorn Street, and I know all about it. You see, Ray, or Gilmour as we
had better call him, is a bit of a mechanical genius, as he would be, having
been an engineer-lieutenant in the Navy, and he has a fine lot of electrical
plant hidden away in Greencorn Street. Now, why on earth does he want to have
all that beautiful stuff secreted in a house that is supposed to be
uninhabited? My idea is that before he joined forces with Mr.&mdash;well, never
mind who&mdash;he was planning a wholesale coining business. I have had expert
advice on that machinery, and from what I can gather, it is possible to take
rough metal disks and stamp them out into florins and half-crowns without the
aid of moulds or the melting-pot. But we need not go into that, Jesson. In that
house is a dynamo run off the main with two thousand volts on an alternating
current. The Electric Lighting Company is not receiving a penny for it, so of
course the main has been tapped. Now do you begin to understand?"</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed I do, sir," Jesson exclaimed. "And that tallies with what Pensum
told me. One night, some time ago, Gilmour went to him in a great state of
excitement, and told him that a dreadful accident had happened at 17 Greencorn
Street. He said that Avory had ventured in there, and that, quite by accident,
he had been killed by coming in contact with an electric wire. At any rate, he
was dead, and Gilmour's great anxiety was to get rid of the body. Of course, we
know now that Avory was lured on to touch the live wire, but that will not be
so easy to prove. At any rate, that is the theory I go upon."</p>
<p>"And quite right, too," Lock said. "Of course, we could not definitely prove
it in a court of justice, but undoubtedly that was what happened. Proceed with
your story, Jesson."</p>
<p>"Well, Gilmour told Pensum that he must help to get rid of the body. It
would never do to call the police in and let them see the inside of 17
Greencorn Street. There were many reasons why that must be prevented. It would
have been an easy matter for Gilmour to have carried the body out of the house
in the darkness and throw it into the Thames, but that course was not entirely
without risk. So Gilmour hit upon the happy idea of disposing of the body at a
considerable distance, so that when it was found no suspicions would be
attached to anybody within miles of Wapping. Also, it might appear that Avory
had either fallen into a pond by accident or committed suicide. Therefore,
Pensum was more or less compelled to take his taxi to Greencorn Street and hide
the body inside. Then he was directed to take it as far as Hampstead very late
at night, and put it in the pond himself. At any rate, that is what Pensum told
me, and if you had heard him speak to me as he spoke just now, I am quite sure
you would believe him, sir."</p>
<p>"Yes, I think I should," Lock said. "So that is Pensum's statement, is
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, taken down and signed."</p>
<p>"Well, that is so much to the good. Professor Phillipson was quite right
when he said that Avory had been electrocuted. But what about those other
similar cases?"</p>
<p>"I don't think Pensum had anything to do with them, sir," Jesson said.
"Gilmour must have employed somebody else. On two occasions, at any rate, he
borrowed Pensum's taxi and was off with it for a long time. It is just possible
that he had one or two confederates he wanted to get out of the way. But as to
that, I suppose we shall never know the truth. We have got quite enough to go
on with for our purpose."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right enough. Now, you know what to do to-morrow night, don't
you? You know where to meet me, and you know where the other men are to be
stationed. I have been over the premises in Great Bower Street, and I have
found out exactly how that boat comes and goes. At certain states of the tide
it is possible for the boat to go and return by lifting a sort of wooden
curtain at the side of the underground vault. This leads into a sort of
water-lane connected with the river, much as a side street turns out of a main
thoroughfare. The outside of the curtain is all mud and slime, and viewed from
the exterior in daylight appears to be part of the wall of the slipway. But it
isn't, Jesson, it isn't. No wonder those chaps were able to get away from right
under the noses of the river police. But we shall have them to-morrow night. I
think that is about all for the present."</p>
<p>It was getting late on the next evening when Lock, accompanied by Jesson and
another officer, and Ellis and Rust, set out on their way to Great Bower
Street. Lock would have much preferred to have gone unattended by these
amateurs, but Ellis, at any rate, had made a strong point of being one of the
party, and considering what the authorities owed to him, Lock did not see his
way to refuse.</p>
<p>"I don't see how you can possibly leave me out," Ellis had protested. "You
would never have got on to this business at all if it hadn't been for Rust and
myself. Besides, how do you suppose I am going to make the real big splash for
my paper unless I see the thing from start to finish? This midnight expedition
of ours in underground London will be worth a couple of columns at least. Can't
you see it for yourself&mdash;the secret passage, the underground lake upon
which the boat floats, and the dramatic arrest of the man who has been robbing
half the merchants in London with impunity for months. Oh no, my dear fellow, I
am certainly not going to be out of this, unless you arrest me on some
trumped-up charge, and lock me up for the night."</p>
<p>And so Ellis and his friend had been allowed to accompany the expedition.
They reached the offices in Great Bower Street at length, and Lock admitted
them by means of a skeleton key. He was careful to post two of his men outside
in case of a surprise, not that he anticipated anything of the sort, but he was
taking no risks. He had learnt an hour or so before that Gilmour had left his
rooms, though his landlady was under the impression that he was not well and
had retired for the night.</p>
<p>"That's the game he always plays upon her," Lock said. "I told you, Mr.
Ellis, that I should find out all about it. One of our women detectives made
friends with the housekeeper, and found out that on the night Gilmour lost his
latchkey he was out, as the hall porter told you, dressed in a suit of shabby
tweeds, though the old woman was prepared to swear that he went to bed before
she did. I think you will find that when we come to lay our case before the
court not a single link will be missing, unless perhaps Croot slips through our
fingers."</p>
<p>"I don't think he will," Ellis said dryly. "I can see a way of dragging him
in. At any rate, we can ask him a question he will find it very difficult to
answer. How is he going to explain what happened the night that Gilmour got
down to Cray and pretended that he had reached there too late for dinner."</p>
<p>"Well, upon my word, that had quite escaped my attention," Lock admitted.
"You are quite right. But we will attend to that presently; meanwhile, we had
better be getting on."</p>
<p>They made their way very cautiously down the underground passages through
the vaults, and there they sat down patiently for the best part of two hours.
Then suddenly they heard the creaking of wheels and the noise of something in
motion, and after that muttered voices and the swish of rippling water. Lock
rose to his feet and turned on his flarelight. The boat was there in the centre
of the inky lake, with Gilmour and two men sitting in it. Something bright
flashed in Lock's hand.</p>
<p>"Throw them up," Lock said crisply. "Throw them up. The first man who moves
will be shot."</p>
<p>"What's the meaning of this?" Gilmour blustered.</p>
<p>"It means," Lock snapped, "that you are my prisoner."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-28" id="ch-28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;ONE WAY OUT</h2>
<p>Gilmour faced round with a bitter snarl on his lips. His right hand dropped
almost mechanically to his side, but a threatening gesture from Lock caused him
to refrain. His big combative jaw was thrust out, his eyes burned with a fierce
hate, but he was powerless for the moment, and he knew it. With his hands held
high above his head he poured out a stream of invective that seemed to hiss
like water on fire. To Ellis and Rust looking on it was as if some wild animal
were wriggling and writhing in a trap.</p>
<p>"Very fine," Lock said almost genially. "Quite a remarkable effort, but if
you don't mind, I should like to see you bring that boat a little closer in.
No, you can't get away as you came, because by this time the river patrol is
close behind. Yes, that's better. Step up, Mr. Gilmour."</p>
<p>Ellis began to see now exactly how the secret passage into the river was
worked. In the powerful flarelight that Lock held in his left hand he could
make out a series of bars and chains on the slimy doorway, and certain heavy
weights depending from a couple of rusty chains. It was quite plain that the
whole system depended upon a series of counterweights which could be operated
from either side of the slide without any particular effort, and when once the
shutter had dropped into its place from the outside it would appear to be no
more than part of the original wall.</p>
<p>"Very ingenious, isn't it?" he whispered to Rust. "And very easy at the same
time. I expect that has been there hundreds of years; no doubt in the days when
Great Bower Street was occupied by members of the aristocracy and all these
offices were town houses. Can't you picture all sorts of intrigues going on
here against the State? I can imagine the followers of the excited Charles II,
and afterwards partisans of the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth, hiding and
scheming here and being smuggled by that underground passage to craft on the
river. Probably more than one traitor went his way thus to the Tower. By
George! what a story I shall have to tell the <i>Telephone</i> readers."</p>
<p>But Rust was not listening. Just at that moment he had eyes only for
Gilmour, who was standing a little way off, with his hands still above his head
and glaring savagely at Lock. Behind him were the two men who had helped to man
the boat. Lock turned sharply to one of his subordinates.</p>
<p>"Do you know these people, Williams?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, sir," Williams of the river police said cheerfully. "I know both
men quite well. The big chap with the one eye is called Dodger Grant, and he
has been convicted a score of times for thefts from ships. The other man is an
American, and badly wanted in New York. I have nearly had my hands on him half
a dozen times, but every time he has managed to slip through my fingers. A very
dangerous chap he is."</p>
<p>"Well, take them off," Lock said curtly. "I will deal with Mr. Gilmour
myself."</p>
<p>A little later, and Gilmour, together with Lock and the other two, were in
the basement office of the house in Great Bower Street. Gilmour turned
furiously upon Rust.</p>
<p>"I suppose I have to thank you for this," he snarled. "I dare say you think
you are very clever, but you don't know everything. You have a lot to learn
yet."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Rust said quietly. "In any case, it doesn't matter. If
it is any satisfaction to you, I am the man who discovered the secret
hiding-place and informed the police. But I did not do so out of personal
motives; I acted as I did because a great wrong has been done to friends of
mine, and I am making it my business to see it righted. As a matter of fact,
Mr. Ellis can tell you a great deal more than I can."</p>
<p>Gilmour appeared about to say something, then he changed his mind. Lock
stepped across to him and slipped a hand into Gilmour's hip pocket. From thence
he produced a revolver, which he threw on the table in a corner of the
office.</p>
<p>"Now we have done with that," he said, "we can talk more quietly. Mr.
Gilmour, I have a warrant for your arrest. As a matter of fact, I have two
warrants. If you want me to read them over to you, I shall be very pleased to
do so."</p>
<p>Gilmour dropped into a chair and coolly took a cigarette from his case. He
was quite himself now, the fighting light had died out of his eyes, and his big
cruel chin was no longer thrust out.</p>
<p>"I might just as well admit myself beaten," he said. "You have caught me
red-handed, and I shall know how to accept my punishment. What is the
charge?"</p>
<p>Lock proceeded to explain. He told Gilmour candidly enough how he had laid a
trap for him, and how he and his confederates had walked almost blindfold into
it.</p>
<p>"Those boxes of cigars were marked," he said. "There was an identification
sign in all of them. The same remark applies to those cases of saccharine which
are on your motor-boat at the present moment. Your man Pensum is under remand
now for stealing those cases of cigars. One of them was found in his
possession."</p>
<p>"Ah, that accounts for it," Gilmour said. "I felt sure the fools had stolen
one of them. If they hadn't, we should not be here at the present moment. Would
you mind opening that cupboard, Inspector Lock? You see, I know who you are,
and I won't pretend that I don't. You will find a bottle and glasses in there,
also a syphon of soda water. In the circumstances, I suppose you won't mind my
having a little drink."</p>
<p>Lock signified that he had no objection, and for a few minutes Gilmour sat
there sipping his whisky and soda with the air of a man who is thoroughly
enjoying himself. When he had finished and come to the end of his cigarette, he
turned to Lock and intimated that he was quite ready.</p>
<p>"But first of all," he said, "perhaps you had better read that warrant over
to me."</p>
<p>Lock proceeded to do so. At the very first word Gilmour sat up, and once
more the angry hunted look came into his eyes.</p>
<p>"Where did you get that from?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"I don't quite follow you," Lock said.</p>
<p>"Well, you don't call me Gilmour, you speak of me as George Ray. Now, who in
the name of fortune is George Ray?"</p>
<p>"Well, unless I am altogether mistaken, you are," Lock replied. "Really, I
should have hardly thought that a clever man like you would have wasted his
time in questioning my facts. You are George Ray, late Engineer-Lieutenant in
His Majesty's Navy, and at the time when you were dismissed the Service you
were second-in-command on board the <i>Sharkstooth.</i> Are you going to deny
it?"</p>
<p>Gilmour bent forward, and just for a second or two he looked like an utterly
broken man. He covered his face with his hands, and remained silent for quite a
long time.</p>
<p>"Are you bound to charge me in that name?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly I am," Lock replied. "It is your own name, and you are not going
to deny it."</p>
<p>"It would be utterly useless," Gilmour almost whispered. "Of course, I know
that I have been running this sort of risk for a long time, and I was quite
prepared to meet it. But it never occurred to me that my proper name would ever
be public property. I ask you as a favour, Inspector Lock, not to have me
charged in the name of Ray. There is nothing to be gained by it, and a great
scandal would be averted."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it is too late now," Lock said. "I am not a hard-hearted man,
but I have my duty to do, and I must do it. You see, I applied for the warrants
in your proper name, and no power on earth can change that now. But why?"</p>
<p>"Because I am not altogether shameless," Gilmour almost groaned. "I am
thinking of my family. My mother is still alive, and I have sisters who are
well and happily married. But what is the good of my talking about that? The
mischief is done now, and there is an end of it. Now, as to your other
charge."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is another matter altogether," Lock said gravely. "And I must
first warn you that anything you say will be used in evidence against you. You
are charged with luring one William Avory into your workshop at 17 Greencorn
Street on a certain night which is mentioned in the indictment, and there
murdering him by means of a highly-charged electric wire. Subsequently you are
accused of placing the body in a taxi-cab and sending it off to Hampstead in
the custody of George Pensum, who placed it in the pond at Hampstead where it
was found. It is not altogether regular, but I may tell you that Pensum has
made a full confession. And I may also tell you that Professor Phillipson is
prepared to prove that Avory died of an electric shock. There are other similar
cases, but I won't go into them at present."</p>
<p>"I think that will do," Gilmour said quietly. He was quite cool and
collected now, and finished his drink with a steady hand. "I am much obliged to
you for your candour, Inspector, and I don't think I will say any more at
present."</p>
<p>With that, he stood up and held out his hands. Without a word Lock fitted a
pair of handcuffs on them. Outside, a taxi was waiting, and at Lock's
suggestion, both Ellis and Rust followed him into the cab. They drove along for
some way in silence towards the police station, with Gilmour sitting in the
corner like a statue. Then suddenly he jumped to his feet and flung himself
violently against the door of the cab. Before Lock could pull him down again
the door had given under the strain, and Gilmour made a wild dash for liberty.
The cab was going swiftly along the deserted street, so that directly Gilmour
touched the ground he twisted round like a scrap of paper in the wind, and
crashed head first upon the greasy asphalt. As his head fell forward, the hind
wheel of the cab went over him. When the taxi pulled up at length, Gilmour lay
there quite unconscious and quite obviously very seriously hurt. They lifted
him to his feet and laid him down on the pavement with his coat under his
head.</p>
<p>"I think he is done for," Lock said. "Driver, go to the Thames Police Court
at once and get an ambulance."</p>
<p>They waited in the deserted street for some time until the ambulance,
accompanied by the police surgeon, arrived, and an examination of the wounded
man was made.</p>
<p>"Rather serious, isn't it?" Lock asked.</p>
<p>"Very," the doctor said curtly. "Unless I am altogether mistaken, it's a bad
fracture at the base of the skull. He must have done that when he fell, and the
weight of the cab on the top of him has completed the mischief. I shall be very
surprised indeed if the poor chap lives till morning."</p>
<p>They did what they could for Gilmour, who at length found quarters in the
London Hospital, where he lay utterly unconscious on a bed, evidently waiting
for the end. There was nothing to do now but to get back to Rust's rooms, where
Lock accompanied them. He had not yet finished his night's work, he explained,
but he could spare half an hour to discuss the events of the evening.</p>
<p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "you can't say that you haven't had an exciting
time."</p>
<p>"That is true enough," Rust said, as he poured himself out a generous dose
of spirit. "I wouldn't go through it again for all the money in the world."</p>
<p>"I quite agree with you," Ellis remarked. "I wanted a sensational series of
articles for my paper, but I did not expect anything quite so tragic as
this."</p>
<p>They talked over the matter in low tones for some time, until at length the
tension of the atmosphere relaxed and they began to get the events of the
evening into proper proportion.</p>
<p>"I suppose there will be an end of these river robberies now," Ellis
suggested. "Once the secret hiding-place in Crombies Wharf is closed, there
won't be many more of these raids. But I don't believe we have got the chief
rogue even yet."</p>
<p>"Ah, there I quite agree with you," Lock said. "It will take a great deal to
convince me that Mr. Croot knew nothing about it. But to identify him with the
robberies will be quite another thing. He must have known all about the secret
of Crombies Wharf. When he took over the business of Verity &amp; Co. a few
years ago he was a poor struggling man. He had just come back from Canada,
knowing very little about English business conditions. He has been running an
old-fashioned concern on rather narrow lines, and yet, from all I can hear, he
has made a large fortune. He couldn't have done that and been honest at the
same time."</p>
<p>"We are quite aware of the fact," Rust laughed. "Perhaps it would be as well
now to show you another side to Croot's character. Before long you will have to
know it in your professional capacity. It is not a pretty story, but we have
all the facts practically at our finger tips, and you will have the
satisfaction before long of arresting Croot on another charge, though you may
never be able to prove that he was behind Gilmour in those river robberies. Not
that I despair of that."</p>
<p>"Neither do I," Lock said. "I shall be very interested to hear what Croot
has to say when I ask him how he explains the fact that Gilmour went down to
the Moat House one night in a taxi and subsequently appeared in evening dress
at the birthday dinner party of Croot's adopted daughter."</p>
<p>"Yes, that will take a bit of answering," Ellis said. "Now, Geoff, tell the
Inspector all about Broken Points."</p>
<p>With that, Rust proceeded to tell the story at length, and after it was
finished Lock went off, leaving Ellis and Rust together. It was getting very
late now, but neither of the friends seemed inclined to move, though Ellis
suggested bed.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think you want to turn in yet," Rust said. "I feel as if I
never should sleep again. It's been a ghastly evening, Jack, and it will be a
long time before I forget it. Of course, everything is going to straighten
itself out now, but what troubles me particularly at the moment is how Vera
will take all this business when she comes to be told the truth."</p>
<p>"I hadn't overlooked that either," Ellis murmured. "It will be a great shock
to her, but after all, she is young and strong, and Croot is no relation of
hers. She will get over it in time, though I don't mind saying that I dread
telling her."</p>
<p>"I think the sooner you do so the better," Rust said. "You had better run
down to-morrow and see her. Or if you like, I will arrange it. I am going down
to Cray to-morrow, anyway."</p>
<p>"Oh, things are moving in that direction, are they?"</p>
<p>"Most assuredly they are. I have arranged to see Croot to-morrow at the Moat
House, and I am not going alone, because Major Langley accompanies me. Oh yes,
we are ready to move, and when we have finished, Langley will come into his own
again."</p>
<p>"What, you don't mean to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do, Jack, I do. The major is quite clear in his mind again, and what's
more, he knows now where all those vital papers are hidden in the Moat House.
He can go straight to the spot and put his hand upon them. They are in the
library almost under Croot's nose, and I am going to be present when they are
found."</p>
<h2><a name="ch-29" id="ch-29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;EXODUS</h2>
<p>It still wanted some quarter of an hour from midnight when Ellis flung
himself into a taxi outside Rust's rooms and directed the driver to take him to
the offices of the <i>Telephone.</i> In the horror and excitement of the
evening he had entirely forgotten the reason why he had first embarked upon the
problem connected with those robberies on the river. He had been seated talking
to Geoffrey Rust and discussing the future, when just after Rust had mentioned
the fact that Major Langley was at last in a position to make a definite move,
he had recollected the duty that he owed to his paper. No one knew better than
himself how quickly these things get talked about; he was quite aware of the
small army of hack journalists who always hang about a police station late at
night on the off-chance of picking up some exclusive piece of information
likely to lead to a paragraph which, properly manipulated, would keep the
writer in comfort for a week. And if this happened, then the <i>Telephone</i>
would be forestalled, and he would have his pains for nothing.</p>
<p>"By Jove, I must be off!" he cried. "If I start now I shall be able to get
in two or three columns in time for the country edition. I will try and see you
to-morrow, Geoff, and perhaps when we meet in the evening you will have
something to say to me with regard to the interview with Croot."</p>
<p>With that he hurriedly departed, and a quarter of an hour later passed
through the granite pillars of the <i>Telephone</i> offices in Fleet Street,
and thrust himself into the sanctum of the news editor.</p>
<p>Mr. Donaldson did not appear to be particularly busy. On the contrary, he
was deploring the fact that the present issue of his paper would be rather a
commonplace one. There was plenty of time yet for something big, and Donaldson
knew that the great thing was at hand directly he caught sight of Ellis's
face.</p>
<p>"You've got a scoop for us, haven't you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Well, rather," Ellis said. "Those river robberies. The leader has been
arrested; in fact, I was present and saw it done. And, moreover, he is dead.
Flung himself out of a taxi with the handcuffs on, and fractured his skull. But
stop a minute. I am not quite sure that he is dead yet. But anyhow, he can't
live till morning, and you can verify that by calling up the London Hospital on
the 'phone. I have got it all here, Donaldson&mdash;arrest of the miscreants, a
fine story of underground passages and secret vaults&mdash;quite in the style
of the old-fashioned shilling shocker. Send me a smart typist to my room, and I
will turn out two or three columns for you as fast as you can get it set
up."</p>
<p>Donaldson rubbed his hands cheerfully. He was deeply interested in the river
robberies, and it was he who had selected Ellis as the star representative to
get to the bottom of it. He had never ceased to gird at the police, and the
<i>Telephone</i> leaderettes on the subject had become quite a joke in Fleet
Street.</p>
<p>"That's good," he said. "I can give you an hour and a half. Now, off you go
and get on with it."</p>
<p>And so it came about that the <i>Telephone</i> duly appeared the next
morning with flaming headlines and leaded type giving a full and particular
account of those amazing river robberies from the time of their inception to
the moment when Gilmour had been arrested. Gilmour's proper name was given, and
some account of his past. The whole thing wound up at the end of three columns
with a few lines to the effect that Gilmour had died in the London Hospital
just as the <i>Telephone</i> was going to press.</p>
<p>Naturally enough, the thing created a tremendous sensation. Everybody was
reading it, it was discussed in all the suburban trains as London's thousands
flocked into the city on their daily business. A copy of the paper duly
appeared on the breakfast table of the Moat House where Vera was seated alone,
having just seen her father made comfortable in the library. She always made a
practice of reading the <i>Telephone,</i> not only because she liked it, but
because Jack Ellis was a prominent member of the staff.</p>
<p>She read on, line after line, with a white face and bated breath, whilst her
breakfast grew cold, then she picked up her copy of the paper and walked
unsteadily into the library. Croot looked up at her with a queer sinking at his
heart as he noticed the pallor on her lips, and the look of horror in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, my child?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, a most dreadful thing has happened," Vera said breathlessly. "Mr.
Gilmour was arrested last night in a sort of underground cave beneath your
offices, and a lot of stolen property was found which had been taken from a
ship on the river&mdash;Oh, I can't go on. You must read it for yourself. There
are columns of it. They arrested Mr. Gilmour and took him to the police station
in a taxi. He tried to escape, handcuffed as he was, and he met with a dreadful
accident. He&mdash;he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say he is dead?" Croot asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>"So it says in the <i>Telephone,"</i> Vera sobbed.</p>
<p>Croot drew a long, deep breath of relief. He was not in the least disturbed
to hear of the tragic end of his chief confederate, but he was immensely easier
in his mind to know that it was now outside the power of Gilmour to betray
him.</p>
<p>"This is very terrible," he said, trying to speak as if the news was almost
too much for him. "I should never have imagined that Gilmour was capable of
rascality like that. And all this time he has been using my offices for the
purpose of those robberies. What was it you said about underground passages? My
dear child, do you mean to say that they exist under the offices in Great Bower
Street? I never dreamt of such a thing. But perhaps you had better let me have
a look at the paper to see for myself. I am not fit for work, as you know, but
really I shall have to go to London to-morrow."</p>
<p>Croot was thankful enough to be alone presently. For an hour or so he sat
there poring over the story disclosed by the <i>Telephone,</i> a great deal
more shaken than he cared to confess. By the time he had worked out his plan of
campaign, and was just getting himself fairly well in hand again, the butler
came into the library. His eyes were widely opened, and he seemed to be almost
as disturbed as his employer. It seemed to Croot that this man also had been
reading the <i>Telephone.</i></p>
<p>"Well, what is it?" he asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Major Langley to see you, sir," the butler said.</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed? I will come out. I don't want to worry him to leave his bath
chair&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He is not in his bath chair, sir," the butler said. "He has walked here,
and Mr. Rust is with him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Walked," Croot cried. "You are not drunk, are you?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, sir; not at all, sir. I was so surprised when I saw Major
Langley standing on the doorstep that you might have knocked me down with a
feather. Looks as well, he does, as if he's never had a day's illness in his
life."</p>
<p>Croot rose to his feet. He had a strange feeling that he was face to face
now with some crisis that it would take all his audacity and cleverness to
survive. He managed to control his voice sufficiently to tell the servant to
bring Major Langley into the library, and he stood with his back to the
fireplace with a smile on his face to welcome his visitors.</p>
<p>"Apparently the age of miracles has not passed, Langley," he said, as he
held out his hand. "I have known for some time that you have been getting
better, but I never hoped to have the pleasure of welcoming you into your old
home again. But sit down and tell me all about it. To whom does the credit of
this amazing thing belong? Evidently your doctor is much cleverer than
mine."</p>
<p>Langley stood there ignoring the outstretched hand. There was a fighting
light in his eyes and stern compression of his lips that Croot did not like at
all.</p>
<p>"I think we can dispense with all that," the major said. "Nor is there the
least occasion for us to shake hands. This I can tell you. I have been getting
gradually better for more than a year. Months ago I could walk as well as ever
I did, and if you look at me, you will see that there is nothing the matter
with my mind. I have been merely biding my time."</p>
<p>"That sounds rather like a threat," Croot laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's no threat," Langley replied. "It's a plain statement of fact, as
you will find to your cost before long. Four years ago, in this very room, I
had a sudden seizure that left me broken in body and mind. For a long time
after that I was a mere shell of humanity, a burden to myself and to everybody
else; and, moreover, I was practically a pauper. It was very good of you,
people said, to give me the shelter of a cottage in grounds that once belonged
to me, and to take my daughter into your office so that she could earn enough
to find her father in food. Ah, it was a happy day for you when I collapsed at
your feet, and you were able to pose as a philanthropist and a friend. You
probably thought it would not matter much, because I was the sort of fool that
any business man could deceive, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, pooh, this is mere drama," Croot smiled. "Take him away, Rust. The mere
fact of his recovering the use of his limbs has turned his head."</p>
<p>"Sorry I can't do that," Rust said curtly; "I am here at the major's
request, and I have promised to stay till he has finished what he has to say. I
think you had better listen."</p>
<p>With a laugh, Croot flung himself down in a chair.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "I will humour him so far. I hope you won't mind my
sitting down; I have not altogether recovered from that blow the burglar gave
me that night."</p>
<p>"So I see," Langley said. "You will perhaps be surprised to hear that I was
the burglar in question."</p>
<p>"You were? Oh, indeed! And why, pray?"</p>
<p>"I am just coming to that," the major said. "I came here like a thief in the
dead of the night in search of certain papers that I placed in a secret drawer
of that old Dutch secretaire some four years ago, the night before you visited
me here and I was stricken down with my sudden illness. I suppose you don't
realize that there is a secret drawer in that antique piece of furniture, but
there is, and I used to keep my confidential documents there. Amongst others,
400 debentures in Broken Points."</p>
<p>Croot looked up swiftly. He was beginning to realize the danger now. His
mind went quickly back to those old days when he was selling those forged
documents to the major and taking his cheques in return.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said, quite steadily. "Go on."</p>
<p>"I appreciate your courtesy," the major said dryly. "I will go on. Those
debentures were forgeries. There were only 1,000 officially issued altogether,
and those were taken up by other people before I was induced to come in. As you
wanted money badly you hit upon the ingenious idea of having a lot more of
those certificates printed, knowing perfectly well that you could sell them to
me. You did sell them to me, and at various times you received just
&pound;40,000 of my money. For these you gave me receipts, exceedingly
business-like receipts, on which the numbers of the debentures appeared. They
started with 1,001, and so on. Knowing perfectly well that you were going to
make Broken Points into a bankrupt concern, you were certain that I should
destroy those debentures when I found they were worthless, and therefore your
fraud would never be discovered. But I did not destroy them. I placed them with
my bankers, and when, through sheer accident, I discovered how I had been
swindled, I brought the debentures down here and placed them in the secretaire.
They are there now, and so are the receipts in your own handwriting."</p>
<p>"You are in a position to prove that?" Croot blustered.</p>
<p>"Certainly I am. In a few minutes you shall see them. But I am getting on a
little too fast. On the occasion of our last interview in this room, when Fate
played me such a scurvy trick, I was ready for you. You came to tell me that I
was ruined, and to give me all your sympathy. My intention was to produce those
documents and confound you where you stood. But the worry and anxiety was too
much for me, and I collapsed literally at your feet, and from that moment you
regarded me as good as dead. By great good fortune I had not taken the
documents out of their hiding-place, so that you were unaware that they even
existed. When I was stricken down you professed to be sorry for me; you told my
daughter that you had tried your very best to keep me from gambling in your
rotten mining company. You played the grand friend, helping a broken man to
live. But I don't want to enlarge upon that. I am going now to produce all
those documents and leave you to deal with them as you think fit. At any rate,
I am going to have my money back, and, moreover, I am coming back to this old
house of mine within the next few days."</p>
<p>"The man is clearly mad!" Croot cried. "Where is your proof of all
this&mdash;those debentures, for instance?"</p>
<p>Major Langley turned swiftly to Rust.</p>
<p>"Tell him," he said. "I have hardly patience to say any more. Tell him what
you know."</p>
<p>"Well, that is not very much," Rust said. "But perhaps I had better inform
you, Mr. Croot, that the major has in his possession the order form given to
the firm of law stationers who printed the debentures, and I may say that that
order form is signed by you as secretary for and on behalf of the company. And
I need not remind you that you had no power under your Articles of Association
to issue more than 1,000 debentures."</p>
<p>"What, you have that order in my handwriting?" Croot burst out. "Where did
it come from?"</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I got it," Rust said. "I procured it through a
friend of mind in the city who knows all about these things. He has the history
of Broken Points at his finger tips. He can tell you, if you like, exactly how
Broken Points was wrecked and the shareholders robbed of their money. From what
he tells me the Kamaloo Trust Syndicate, having bought from the official
receiver assets which he thought to be worthless, is pretty sure to become one
of the most prosperous copper mines in the world. Also, he is prepared to prove
that through a nominee you hold most of the shares. Really, Mr. Croot, I don't
think it will pay you to bluff this thing out any further. I don't think you
will find the major vindictive if you treat him properly, and
therefore&mdash;"</p>
<p>Croot turned on the speaker with a snarl.</p>
<p>"You are a pretty sort of infernal rascal," he said. "So this is why you
wormed yourself into my employ. If I had only known what you were
after&mdash;"</p>
<p>Croot paused as the door opened and the butler looked in. "A gentleman to
see you, sir," he said. "Inspector Lock of Scotland Yard. Shall I ask him in,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Into the drawing-room," Croot said, passing his tongue over his dry lips.
"Tell him I won't keep him a minute. I suppose, major, I have to thank you for
this?"</p>
<h2><a name="ch-30" id="ch-30"></a>CHAPTER XXX&mdash;CROOT'S WAY OUT</h2>
<p>Major Langley drew himself up and looked Croot straight in the face. He
stood there, erect and confident with keen, penetrating eyes and every
appearance of power and resolution. Save for the fact that his hair was
slightly tinged with grey, he looked no more than his years, a man to be
reckoned with.</p>
<p>"I think not," he said. "So far as I am concerned, this matter can be
settled without the intervention of the police. But that is entirely in your
hands, Mr. Croot."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps I have to thank Rust," Croot suggested.</p>
<p>"You are wrong again," Rust said. "I have nothing whatever to do with the
Inspector's visit here, though I could give a pretty good guess at what is
behind it. I don't think, Mr. Croot, you quite appreciate what a serious
business this is. You may or may not have known what was going on in Great
Bower Street, and certainly I don't think you were aware that
murder&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Murder!" Croot cried. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that one of the important witnesses in the case was deliberately
murdered, and that the police have proof of it. One of Gilmour's accomplices
has made a confession. Now, the night Gilmour came down here and you let him
into the house&mdash;But perhaps I had better not say anything about that."</p>
<p>And indeed Rust had already said too much, for he saw the sudden light that
leapt into Croot's eyes and caught the sharp intake of his breath. It was only
for an instant, then Croot was himself again. He shrugged his shoulders
carelessly.</p>
<p>"Oh, that," he said. "Then that is easily explained. But as it does not
concern you, I think I will defer discussion until I talk it over with the
inspector."</p>
<p>Rust knew now that he had given Croot a warning, and that the latter saw his
way to take advantage of it. He wished that he had not been dragged into the
discussion at all.</p>
<p>"But perhaps we had better get along with our own business," Croot
suggested. "Let us finish that, and then I can see what Inspector Lock wants.
Major Langley, you have made an accusation against me. I call upon you to prove
it."</p>
<p>"In that case," the major said, "I will trouble you for the key of the
secretaire."</p>
<p>"It is not locked," Croot said.</p>
<p>Langley crossed the room and, throwing open the doors of the secretaire,
pressed a spring in the back and a panel slid on one side. From an opening
behind he took a mass of papers and laid them on a table. Here were the missing
debentures, and a series of receipts in Croot's own handwriting.</p>
<p>"There," Langley said. "What have you to say to those? They are beyond all
argument. It's rather strange that they should be hidden there, under your very
nose, all this time, and you none the wiser. But the truth will out, and now
you know exactly where you stand. I am not concerned with your other
rascalities, but I am going to see this one righted; so if you return all the
money you have stolen from me, and give up possession of this house within a
month from to-day, then there is no more to be said. I ought to prosecute you,
and I would do so but for the real affection I have for your adopted daughter.
It may be weak on my part, perhaps, but if there is any way out of this
dreadful mess without a scandal, I am ready to help."</p>
<p>"Well, that is really good of you, major," Croot said, genuinely touched for
the first time. "I think that can be managed. To tell you the truth, I have
been thinking for some time of going back to Canada. I am a wealthy man now,
and I always preferred that country to this. If you will hold your hand, I will
undertake within a month to make good and hand the Moat House back to you. If
that is your only condition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One more," Langley said, "and I have done. You must undertake to give back
to every shareholder in Broken Points the money he lost, and if you will do
that you can go to the devil your own way, so far as I am concerned."</p>
<p>A moment later, Croot bowed himself out of the room with the air of one who
has come off best in a battle of wits. He walked straight into the drawing-room
and asked Inspector Lock quite blandly what he could do for him.</p>
<p>"I think you know," Lock said. "The matter of those robberies on the river.
No doubt you have seen the <i>Telephone</i> this morning, so I need not go into
details."</p>
<p>"That is perfectly true," Croot said gravely. "I assure you, inspector,
nobody is more shocked and grieved than I am. I trusted Gilmour implicitly, and
I am bound to say that up to now he has proved a splendid servant. I need
hardly say I had no idea that he was using his position to put money in his own
pockets, and so far as I am concerned I hope the matter will be sifted to the
bottom. Of course, I did know a good deal about the old buildings in Great
Bower Street, and I have been in those vaults more than once. But I thought
that secret was entirely mine. I have just been talking the matter over with my
friends Major Langley and Mr. Rust, and they tell me that robbery is not the
only charge."</p>
<p>Lock looked with admiration at the speaker. Here was a man after his own
heart, prepared to bluff to the very end, and never so much as to flick an
eyelid.</p>
<p>"And there is another thing," Croot went on. "It has been suggested that on
a certain occasion some time ago&mdash;on the night of my adopted daughter's
birthday, to be precise&mdash;I helped Gilmour out of a tight place. Well, I
admit it. You see, I knew all about him; I knew him when he was in the Royal
Navy. He made a bad break there, but after I met him in Canada I put him on his
legs again. At one time in my early days I was getting my living on one of the
Canadian Railways; in fact, I was a telegraph operator of sorts, so that I know
something of the Morse code. So did Gilmour, for the matter of that. We used it
once out West at a time when we were both in a very tight place. We often
talked about it afterwards, and agreed that in certain circumstances it might
be useful again. And it was. On the night of that birthday party I heard
Gilmour signalling outside. He told me that he was in a desperate mess, and I
made an excuse to help him. I managed to leave my guests and smuggle him into
the bedroom he usually occupied, where I knew that he had a change of clothing
and incidentally, a dress suit. I rather enjoyed that; it's the sort of stunt
that always appeals to me. Afterwards Gilmour told me how he had laid his
plans, and how he had sent a man down here travelling by a certain train in a
first-class carriage&mdash;but we have had all that over before, inspector.
Gilmour never told me the history of that night, nor did I press him, because
it was no business of mine. No doubt I acted foolishly, but in the same
circumstances, probably you would have done the same. I thought it just as well
to tell you all this frankly, because otherwise you might have inferred that I
was party to those raids on the river. But nothing of the kind. I shall be only
too pleased to produce all my books and papers and even my private ledgers, and
if you can trace anything to me, inspector, then I shall be quite prepared to
defend myself."</p>
<p>It was an amazing tissue of lies, as Lock perfectly well knew, but at the
same time he was not blind to the way in which Croot had strengthened his
position by his apparently candid statement. He knew beyond the shadow of a
doubt that Croot's criminality was as great as Gilmour's had been, but he
realized that if Croot could only keep it up like that when he found himself in
a court of law, no jury would ever be found to convict.</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Croot," he said. "What you have just told me
saves a good deal of trouble. As a matter of fact, I came down here on purpose
to ask you a few questions on the very point that you have just made so clear.
I may possibly have to call you at the inquest on the body of the man called
Gilmour, but even that may be unnecessary."</p>
<p>With that Lock said no more, and presently took his leave, realizing grimly
enough that for once in a way he had come off second best in an encounter with
one of the coolest and most audacious criminals he had ever met.</p>
<p>"I am afraid it is no use going on with the business as far as Croot is
concerned," he said presently, when he joined Major Langley and Rust at the
cottage. "But perhaps I had better tell you what took place between Croot and
myself...there, you see what I mean. He cut the ground from under my feet by a
frank confession that he had helped Gilmour on the night of the birthday
dinner-party. And the explanation was so plausible that most juries would
believe it. That man is a born actor, and, moreover, he possesses a fine
natural courage. At any rate, we have put an end to those robberies on the
river, and seeing that Gilmour is dead I don't see that we can carry the case
any further. So far as I am concerned, Croot is a free man."</p>
<p>"It is just as well, perhaps," Langley said. "I have no animus against the
fellow, and I am very anxious that his adopted daughter should not suffer."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Croot was talking matters over with Vera. He knew that he had
extricated himself from a dangerous position, mainly due to the indiscretion of
Geoffrey Rust in alluding to what had happened on the night of the birthday
party, and he was feeling in a pleasant, expansive mood. Still, what he had to
say was not particularly pleasant, and he was glad enough when it was all
over.</p>
<p>"I am going back to Canada, my dear," he said. "For some time past I have
been suffering a good deal with my lungs. I have said nothing to you about it,
because I did not want to alarm you, but the doctors tell me that it is
imperative that I should live in a dry climate. So I am going in a month's
time, when I shall have settled everything. Oh, by the way, I understand that
Major Langley has come into a good deal of money&mdash;some old shares that he
bought through me&mdash;and I am going to give him the chance of buying back
the Moat House."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am so glad to hear that," Vera cried. "I have never felt quite happy
here, and all the more so because Pat always behaved so splendidly over it.
But&mdash;but&mdash;are you going to take me with you? Will you live there
always?"</p>
<p>"Oh no," Croot lied easily. "I shall be backwards and forwards a great deal.
But I am not going to take you, my child, because you don't want to go. And I
am not going to stand in the way of your happiness. I have been making some
inquiries about that young man Ellis, and I find him very well spoken of. He is
making quite enough to keep you in every comfort, and some of these early days
he will be very well off. So I thought perhaps if I bought you a nice house in
this neighbourhood and furnished it for you, you could get married before I
went. A very quiet affair&mdash;just you and me and about two others some
morning in a London church. You know what I mean?"</p>
<p>Vera looked at him with affectionate tears in her eyes. Was there ever such
a man, she wondered. And, indeed, whatever Croot's faults might be, there was
no questioning his affection for the girl who had come so strangely into his
life.</p>
<p>"I don't know how to thank you," Vera said.</p>
<p>"Then don't thank me at all," Croot laughed. "Now, run along and tell your
friend Pat all about it. Make your own arrangements, don't consult me, and when
you have fixed upon the house you want and furnished it I will give you a
cheque and you can get married just when and where you like. Now run upstairs
and pack a suit-case for me, because I am going to Manchester this afternoon on
business that will not be put off, and I may not be back for two or three
weeks. But if you send me a telegram, I will come down in time for the
ceremony. I like to hustle things like this when once I have made up my
mind."</p>
<p>Vera went off with her head in a whirl, whilst Croot sat down to review the
situation. By sheer pluck and audacity he had wriggled out of an exceedingly
tight place, and it would be no fault of his own if he found himself in a
similar situation again. He could well afford to make good the losses incurred
by Langley and the unfortunate shareholders in Broken Points, and leave himself
with a handsome fortune when this was done. Moreover, he would be perfectly
happy on the other side of the Atlantic, from whence, probably, he would never
return. He was shrewd enough to see that the less he came in contact with
Langley and his friends in the future the better it would be for all parties.
He would have to be present, of course, at Vera's wedding, but that would only
be a matter of a few minutes, and then he could turn his back upon England for
ever, happy in the knowledge that his past would never be mentioned in Vera's
hearing.</p>
<p>"I am devilish well out of that," he told himself as he lighted a cigar.
"And I will take care that it never happens again. But it was a close call, all
the same."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vera, in the little sitting-room of the cottage, was telling her
friends there quite breathlessly all about the wonderful thing that had
happened during the last hour.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it," she cried, with shining eyes. "It seems almost too
good to be true."</p>
<p>"Well, no one deserves it more than you do," Pat said. "You had better send
a telegram to London and ask Jack to come down, and if he does we'll have a
snug little supper in this tiny room to celebrate the occasion. Just us five,
and nobody else. I suppose you have heard all about my father's good
fortune?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dad told me all about that," Vera said innocently. "How glorious it
will be, Pat, when you are back in your old home again. I have never been
comfortable in the Moat House, and I think I should have been happier if you
had resented my presence more. But before long I shall have a home of my own,
and then I shall be able to come and see you with quite an easy mind. Of
course, I shall miss my father, but he has promised to come frequently to
England, which makes all the difference in the world."</p>
<p>"I don't think that will trouble you very long, my child," the major said.
"When once you and Jack Ellis are settled in your new home, you will have a
thousand different interests to occupy your attention. But what about me? I
shall find the Moat House very lonely without Pat, who, I suppose, will want to
follow your example and get married before long."</p>
<p>"I hope so," Rust laughed. "I have practically finished in Great Bower
Street now, and I must have something to occupy my time. I think I shall take a
house in this neighbourhood myself, even if it is only for the sake of the
golf."</p>
<p>"Well, with four of us you won't be lonely," Pat said. "And anyway, we have
all much to be thankful for."</p>
<p>"Amen to that," the major said.</p>
