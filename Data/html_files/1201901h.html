<h3>Being the Strange History of Victor Colonna, Professor of
Science,<br>
and his Experiments in the Lost Art of Poisoning.</h3>
<hr>

<h3>No. III. &mdash; THE HOLY ROSE</h3>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="first">THE curtain had just fallen on the second act of
<i>Die Meistersinger</i>; de Resske's flute-like tones still
seemed to linger in the fretted roof. There was a rustling of
fans, a shimmer of satin and gloss of pearls as the audience,
released from the spell, rippled into conversation. Colonna
lounged in his stall, contemplating the brilliant <i>mise en
scène</i> as one does a striking picture. Then he turned to his
companion, a slight little man with restless eye and quick,
vivacious manner.</p>

<p>"Is the mouse in the trap yet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the other, who was no less a personage than
Sir William Wallace, the great Political Economist. "That is the
man in the third box of the grand tier."</p>

<p>"Indeed, he looks a mere boy."</p>

<p>"Young as he looks, Baron Rosalba is nearly forty. Our
Cyclopean financiers 'arrive' early nowadays. A most dangerous
fellow, Colonna&mdash;a genius beyond question, with a nerve of
steel and the heart of a tiger where his personal interests are
concerned. If he succeeds in his present undertaking, England is
doomed."</p>

<p>"So bad as that!" Colonna murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am not exaggerating," Wallace responded gravely.
"Consider how Rosalba squeezed our working classes over the Oil
Trust. This other affair, of which I got wind quite by accident,
is a far more serious thing. If Rosalba is successful, he will
control the price of grain and breadstuffs for Europe for years
to come. If he liked to say the word we should practically be
deprived of bread. Consider for a moment the awful consequences
of such a thing. Why, that man would be in a position to make
terms with us like a conquering sovereign. Frankly, I am
frightened, and that is why I came to you."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Colonna. "If Rosalba were
removed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't quite mean that!" Wallace said, hastily. "There
are more ways of killing a dog than hanging him. If you could
cripple that audacious intellect, for instance, or&mdash;well,
you know how fine is the line between genius and insanity. A tiny
pebble cast into a piece of intricate machinery is quite as
destructive as a thunder bolt. You take me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Colonna responded. "The process will be
expensive."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, money is no object whatever."</p>

<p>"Very good. You will so arrange it that I can draw what money
I require without trouble or delay. As to the rest, everything
must be left entirely to me. All I ask you to do is to bring my
intended victim and myself together. You know Rosalba intimately,
you say. Can you tell me if we have anything in common?"</p>

<p>"One thing in sympathy between you I can mention offhand,"
Wallace replied. "Rosalba has a craze for the collecting of rare
and quaint curiosities. He is quite a connoisseur like yourself.
I cannot think of anything else."</p>

<p>"It will suffice." said Colonna. "And the sooner we meet the
better."</p>

<p><br> COLONNA came slowly down the marble steps leading from
Wallace's town house into Palace Gardens, and took his way
eastward. He had left behind him a most congenial luncheon party,
conspicuous amongst whom was Rosalba. A casual conversation on
matters ceramic and artistic had drawn the two men together.
Colonna did not need to be reminded that a difficult task lay
before him, and from the doctor's features it was evident that he
was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yonder man is the cream of a million," he muttered. "Quiet as
a cat, and yet as cruel and relentless where his own ends are
concerned. And yet in ten minutes I could reduce him to a
babbling idiot for life. Still, one does not care to take a
bludgeon to fight a master of fence. How to proceed for the
present I know not."</p>

<p>Colonna had thought out a dozen schemes only to abandon them
directly. Defeat irritated him for the moment, and retarded the
process of deglutition. He resolutely put the thing out of his
mind for the present. He strolled along Oxford-street thence
along Bond-street, where he was accosted by a tradesman who came
out of a certain shop with an eager air. Most people know
Tregold's, that veritable museum of all that is rare and
curious.</p>

<p>"Have you got something to show me, Tregold?" Colonna
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I didn't think of you," Tregold responded. "But
when I saw you looking into the window it struck me you might
like to see a little thing I picked up yesterday. I can't give it
a name for the life of me."</p>

<p>Colonna followed into the dingy shop with eagerness tempered
by the caution of the collector who had grown veteran in the
battle of bargains. Tregold produced from a little wash-leather
bag a perfect gem in the way of silversmith's work. It was an
exquisite rose, with two sprays of leaves, the flower itself
being hammered gold. Evidently the thing was of medieval
design.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Doctor?" the dealer asked, eagerly.
Colonna's eyes flashed. Otherwise he preserved his outward calm.
"It would be difficult to say," he replied. "Symbolic, I should
imagine."</p>

<p>"Only one cannot authenticate it. If I did not know where
every single specimen was at the present moment, I should say one
of the Papal 'Holy Roses' had fallen into my hands. Very likely
this is a copy of the one sent by the Pope to Charles V. of
Spain. In that case its value is by comparison small."</p>

<p>"I am prepared to purchase it at a price," Colonna said,
tentatively.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1201901h-images/Borgias-03-1.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I am prepared to purchase it at a price," Colonna said, tentatively.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"And, upon my word, I don't know what price to say. Two
hundred guineas?"</p>

<p>"Say a hundred and fifty. It is what you people call a pig in
a poke, you know."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, and Colonna passed out of the shop with
his new treasure in his pocket. He felt the extravagant pleasure
of a child with a new toy. Then he hailed a cab, and was driven
homeward. Once there, he laid the exquisite rose on the table and
contemplated it with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"What a treasure!" he exclaimed. "And how fortunate that my
family volume should contain an account of this unique thing.
What it would fetch, properly authenticated, Heaven only
knows."</p>

<p>Colonna took the curio from the table and gently pressed the
head of the stem, at the same time taking care to keep his hands
well free from the flower. It was well he did so, for from every
petal there darted a thin sharp tongue of metal like a curved
needle. Each needle on close examination proved to be hollow.
Directly the pressure was taken off the stem they disappeared
once more.</p>

<p>"No question about it," Colonna muttered. "It is the veritable
thing itself. And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonna dropped suddenly into a chair. The inspiration he had
been seeking came upon him like a blinding flash. The idea was so
stupendous that it almost overpowered him for the moment. In an
instant the whole scheme in its minutest detail lay like a map of
fire upon the grey tissue of the brain. Rosalba was doomed
now.</p>

<p>"The instruments are to my hand," said the plotter, "every
puppet in its place, and I have only to pull the strings. Carmen
is more or less in my power, and in any case she would do
anything for money. She shall be the dainty bait in the gilded
cage, and Rosalba shall enter it with his eyes open."</p>

<p>Then Colonna took down a medical treatise from a shelf and
became engrossed in its pages until it was time to dress for
dinner.</p>

<p><br> EVERY London season sees one or more brilliant comets
flash across the all too brief empyrean and fall into the
boundless darkness again. And in the present year of grace
perhaps the most coruscating meteor was Carmen Clay. A beautiful
and talented actress, the wife of an American millionaire, Carmen
had taken London by storm. The mere fact that she and her husband
were not on speaking terms was merely the sauce piquante to the
dainty dish.</p>

<p>Colonna knew his fellow Italian well; he could, had he liked,
point to the pestiferous refuse heap where this gaudy butterfly
was evolved. And when Colonna allowed Carmen's claims to regal
blood to pass, she was in a way grateful. Rich by virtue of her
marriage, Carmen was nevertheless always short of money. The
Serpent of Old Nile was no more fascinating than she, her smile
was one of melting tenderness, what time she was heartless and
cruel as the grave. To Colonna this fascinating enigma was as an
open book.</p>

<p>He sat opposite to Carmen Clay in the daintiest corner of,
perhaps, the daintiest drawing-room in all Kensington. Colonna
was ever a welcome guest there. The smiling and easy contempt
with which he treated his hostess charmed her.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I suppose you want something, or you would
not be here."</p>

<p>"Absolutely correct," Colonna responded, candidly. "I want a
great deal."</p>

<p>"Ah! You are aware that I never do anything for nothing?"</p>

<p>"Dear madam," Colonna murmured, "you pain me. Could it be
possible for anyone to know you and pass by as if you were on
ordinary woman? To study a character like yours is a living and a
constant joy to me."</p>

<p>Carmen's red lips displayed two rows of seed pearls in a
caressing smile. A subtle perfume filled the air. The dainty
curves of that perfect figure were covered by a foam of lace and
a ripple of Liberty inspiration. Cooler heads than Colonna's
might have been turned by that picture.</p>

<p>"To be perfectly honest," said Carmen, "I am fearfully hard
up. The amount?"</p>

<p>"Two thousand pounds is a deal of money," said Colonna,
tentatively.</p>

<p>"It is, Colonna; you are going to ask me to do something
awful."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am not. I shall merely give you a lesson to learn
and a congenial part to play. I shall pay for all the cost of
stage management, and when the performance is over you will get
your cheque. Could anything be more simple?"</p>

<p>"Go on. I am absolutely consumed with curiosity."</p>

<p>"All in good time. Do you happen to have met Baron
Rosalba?"</p>

<p>"Two or three times lately. The Baron and myself are quite
good friends."</p>

<p>"He is a very rich man," Colonna said, drily. "You say he
knows how to take care of his wealth. So much the better for my
little scheme. Now, as you are doubtless aware, the Baron is a
veritable Napoleon of finance. He has a great programme on now
which will put millions in his pocket, and may seriously affect
the future of Europe&mdash;of England especially. Therefore it
becomes necessary to frustrate this plan. As to that, I will
coach you in due course. To make assurance doubly sure, a paper
will be drawn up for the Baron's signature. There will be a
concession to <i>X</i> which, if signed, will render his plan
futile. When you are up in your part, you will let the Baron know
that you have discovered the plot, and boldly demand his
signature."</p>

<p>"Which will assuredly be refused," said Carmen.</p>

<p>"The first time, doubtless," Colonna said, coolly. "You will
accept this gracefully, and avow your intention of trying again.
The next time you will score."</p>

<p>"If any other man had said so I should have laughed in his
face."</p>

<p>"That is a very pretty compliment, <i>cara</i>, and none the
less so because it is sincere. All the same, I am quite sanguine
of success. Your part will reach you to-night, and you will get
it up without delay. Then you will copy out the concession in
your own hand, and take the first opportunity of asking the Baron
to sign it. Within a week of this you are going to send out
invitations for a gipsy dance."</p>

<p>"And what may a gipsy dance be?"</p>

<p>"It is going to be a little inspiration of your own. There
will be no programmes, no formal supper, and a real gypsy band
for music. And there will be no servants. This latter stipulation
is important. The guests will be asked from twelve to four, and
once they have arrived all doors will be locked to the close.
Society is only a big child with a new drum, and society will be
charmed. I will take care the thing is properly pushed in the
papers. It will cost you nothing."</p>

<p>"That is very nice," Carmen laughed, "but as far as I can see
it brings us no nearer to the signature of that paper."</p>

<p>"I am just coming to the crux of the thing," Colonna replied.
"Of course, we must lay a trap for Rosalba. What is to happen
once the bird is caught you will find mapped out in your own
part. Here is the cage."</p>

<p>Colonna drew a small box from his pocket, and from the crimson
leather within produced the golden rose. Carmen gave a cry of
delight.</p>

<p>"How exquisitely lovely!" she exclaimed. "Where did you pick
that up? But I fail to see how that pretty thing can effect
Rosalba."</p>

<p>Colonna, by way of reply, look up the rose and pressed the
stem. He explained the whole working of the needles to Carmen, to
her great delight.</p>

<p>"If you open this corona by touching this tiny stud," he said,
"you disclose this dial. It looks like a watch, it has works like
a watch, but really the thing is a time-clock. If the clock is
wound up, and set, say, at twelve, precisely at the hour those
curved needles shoot out. They are very long, you see, and if
they gripped your arm, for instance, they would retain a hold
until pressure was brought to bear upon the stem. Suppose someone
steals the thing, and pockets it when set, it would be a case of
the Spartan boy and the fox, especially if the man who stole it
was so carefully watched that he could not dispose of it."</p>

<p>"Your meaning is not quite plain yet," said Carmen.</p>

<p>"That I now arrive at," Colonna replied. "Rosalba has quite a
mania for rare and costly curios, and how rare this is you don't
know. I am going to tell him that this is yours, and pique his
curiosity. No, I am not going to leave it here now, but it will
be placed on a table in your inner drawing-room on the night of
the dance. There are two doors to that room, are there not? Good.
At a certain time in the evening Rosalba will steal that rose,
and you and I will see it done."</p>

<p>"Colonna, you must be raving!"</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1201901h-images/Borgias-03-2.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"Colonna, you must be raving!"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Never more sane in my life," Colonna smiled, for the marvels
of the book with the silver clasps were uppermost in his mind.
"As sure as you are seated there, Rosalba will steal that
treasure within five minutes of one o'clock on the night of the
dance. The dial will be set for a little after one. Rosalba will
place it in his pocket, and then he will discover that we have
seen the theft. Scores of honest collectors would do the same
thing."</p>

<p>"How slow you are!" Carmen said. "And then?"</p>

<p>Colonna smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"You will find all the rest, or so much, at any rate, as I
mean you to know, written in your part, which you will follow up
to the minutest detail. No, I am not going to tell you any more
at present."</p>

<p>"I could strike you! At any rate, you will leave the rose
here?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot even do that, Carmen," Colonna replied. "There
are certain reasons why I could not do so. Surely you are
satisfied."</p>

<p>"One has to be pliant with you," Carmen replied, almost
tearfully; "and the money you mentioned will come
opportunely."</p>

<p>Then Colonna rose and took his leave.</p>

<p>Rosalba's inscrutable face looked across the circular dining-
table to Colonna. The former had dined with the doctor&mdash;a
repast absolutely simple, though the wines were rare and curious,
quite cameos in their way, as Rosalba remarked.</p>

<p>"I owe you a debt of gratitude for asking me to dine here
tonight," said the latter. "Your English Sundays are terribly
depressing, but to-night I have dined poetically, and your art
treasures are a dream."</p>

<p>"And we finish up the day at Carmen's gypsy dance," Colonna
smiled. "Come, <i>all</i> English Sundays are not absolutely
hopeless. And, by the way, there is one thing at Carmen's you
must not omit to see. You will remember, of course, that one of
the Popes sent Charles V. of Spain a 'Holy Rose.' You will also
recollect that Charles, to get Francis I. of France out of his
way, hit upon the happy expedient of copying the rose, and
forwarding the poisoned copy to Francis as the
original&mdash;thereby gaining the latters friendship and
destroying him at the same time. The affair was discovered, and
the plot failed in consequence."</p>

<p>"It did," said Rosalba, "and that famous forgery has never
been heard of since."</p>

<p>"You mean not till a few days ago," Colonna said, drily.</p>

<p>For once in a way Rosalba displayed signs of excitement. "You
don't mean to say the thing is extant!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," Colonna replied. "I have had it in my hands;
indeed, at the present time it is in Carmen's drawing-room. But
you will see it for yourself presently. I thought you would be
interested in my discovery. Come, one more glass of this liqueur,
and we will smoke a cigarette and depart. Allow me?"</p>

<p>Colonna took up a clean glass and held it up to the light.
There appeared to be on the crystal a fleck of dust that annoyed
him, for he took a clean serviette from the sideboard, unfolded
it, and then polished the glass afresh. Just for an instant the
glass took on a metallic blue, which as instantly faded. He
poured out the rare liqueur, and passed it to Rosalba.</p>

<p>"There are only four flasks of that in Europe," he said.
Rosalba praised the liquid with the tempered moderation of a
connoisseur. As he sipped the last drop Colonna, with a faint
smile flecking his lips, glanced at the clock. Its silver chime
struck twelve.</p>

<p>The host pushed the silver cigarette box across the table. "It
is time for us to go," he said.</p>

<p>Rosalba, was nothing loth. There was a certain suggestion of
uneasiness in his manner which Colonna did not fail to
notice.</p>

<p>"Do you know," the financier said, presently, "that I am
conscious of a strange impulse to do something extravagant?
Perhaps my nerves are a trifle out of order. And yet I am quite
light and buoyant. I had half a mind just now to pick your pocket
of your watch&mdash;a practical joke, you understand."</p>

<p>"In fact, you have reverted for the moment to the elementary
predatory stage of the born financier," Colonna suggested drily.
"But here we are."</p>

<p>By this time most of Carmen's guests had assembled. The
function promised to be a brilliant one, and the very cream of
the 'smart' division had gathered there, attracted by the novelty
of the proceeding. Already dancing was in full swing, and as
Colonna and his companion drove up the last carriage was
depositing its burden. Carmen was quite free to receive the new
comers.</p>

<p>She was looking specially alluring in some clinging drapery
with a foam of lace over. Apparently her warmest smile was for
Rosalba.</p>

<p>"Positively, you are the last to arrive," she said. "I have
given orders for all the doors to be locked. There is no escape
till four in the morning. Baron, am I to take your visit here as
a good omen?"</p>

<p>"You mean that I shall sign a certain document?" Rosalba
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you might have changed your mind, perhaps."</p>

<p>"My dear madame, I never change my mind in business matters.
If you were a man, you will see the impossibility of your
request."</p>

<p>Colonna appeared to be slightly puzzled. In a light and
graceful way he conveyed his jealousy of the understanding
between Carmen and Rosalba, and suggested that he might be
favored with a share in the mystery.</p>

<p>"No, no," Carmen smiled brilliantly. "This is between the
Baron and myself. And I do not despair yet of getting my own
way."</p>

<p>Colonna moved away with a suggestion that his presence was
<i>de trop</i>. He passed into the smaller drawing-room, where he
took the 'Holy Rose' replica from his pocket, and placed it
conspicuously on the table. That Rosalba would be certain to
mention the thing, and ask to see it, he knew. Therefore, when
the Baron came in accompanied by Carmen he felt no surprise.</p>

<p>"Colonna is here," said the former. "Now, may I beg of you to
let me see this unique treasure?"</p>

<p>Carmen shrugged her ivory shoulders carelessly.</p>

<p>"That golden rose you gave me," she explained. "The Baron is
most anxious to examine it. Dr. Colonna will act as cicerone
here, because my guests claim my attention."</p>

<p>"The thing is yonder," said Colonna. "Examine it for
yourself." Rosalba took up the curio most reverently. He appeared
to be engrossed in its examination.</p>

<p>Colonna followed Carmen from the room.</p>

<p>"One word with you," he said. "You are playing your part
uncommonly well. I feel certain that everything is absolutely
safe in your hands. But one thing keep uppermost in your mind. Do
not fail to enter this room by this door precisely on the stroke
of one. I have no more to say."</p>

<p>Carmen nodded with a meaning glance, and passed on. Colonna
returned to the room where Rosalba stood absolutely engrossed
with the golden rose. So enraptured was he that Colonna spoke
twice without eliciting a reply.</p>

<p>"You do not doubt its genuineness?" Colonna asked.</p>

<p>"Not for a moment," Rosalba replied. "With a strong glass I
can see the secret mark of the famous, or rather infamous, artist
upon it. There is no question that our charming hostess has here
a treasure worth anything in reason. I made her an offer just now
that would have tempted most people, but she refused, or at least
she made such conditions as rendered a sale impossible."</p>

<p>Colonna asked no questions, because he knew perfectly well
what those conditions were. It was all part of the programme. The
main condition was the signing by Rosalba of the concession which
would render his gigantic scheme futile.</p>

<p>"I have the first refusal," he said. "There is another
peculiarity about the thing which you will appreciate more fully
presently. Come and show yourself, there are many people here who
are asking for you."</p>

<p>Rosalba dragged himself away with some little difficulty. He
seemed absent and strange in his manner, and the inner drawing-
room seemed to draw him like a magnet.</p>

<p>Colonna watched everything narrowly from the other side of the
room. A gilt clock pointed to a few minutes to one when Colonna
missed Rosalba.</p>

<p>The time had come to act. Colonna crept along in the direction
of the inner drawing room, pushing aside the <i>portière</i> just
as a silver chime struck one. At the same instant Carmen entered
from the other door.</p>

<p>By the table on which lay the Golden Rose stood Rosalba. A
trembling hand raised the treasure, and the next instant it lay
snug in the financier's breast pocket. Then he became conscious
of being watched from either side. Only for a fraction of a
second did Rosalba betray any signs of confusion. Men of his mark
are beyond weaknesses of that ordinary mundane kind. The Baron
was going to brazen it out.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">He became conscious of being watched from either side.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Ah," he said gaily, "madame, you are suspicions. I came to
have another look at that treasure of yours, and I find it has
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Then somebody has stolen it," Carmen replied. "A poor,
practical joke, perhaps. Still, as all the doors are locked, and
nobody can depart without my good will and pleasure, I feel
perfectly safe."</p>

<p>Rosalba said nothing for a moment. The lips were pressed
firmly together, his face was white, though not with fear. For a
second, perhaps, he bent almost double, and a great bead of
perspiration rolled down his forehead.</p>

<p>As he straightened himself again a sharp cry of pain escaped
him. With his left hand clasped to his side, he shivered with the
torture he was enduring.</p>

<br>

<p>"You are ill," Colonna said with solicitude. "I will give you
brandy."</p>

<p>The doctor passed out hurriedly. Apparently the cordial in
question had quite escaped his mind, for a minute later he
mingled with the gay crowd of guests there as if he had nothing
engrossing on his mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Carmen and Rosalba stood facing each other. The
infernal little instrument in the Baron's pocket had done its
work. He had stolen the treasure precisely in the way and at the
time Colonna had prophesied, and he knew perfectly well that
Carmen was aware of the hiding place of the missing article.</p>

<p>He would brazen it out yet, he told himself. Some diabolical
juggling had been practised upon him&mdash;he was the victim of a
plot. Meanwhile the thing in his pocket seemed to be eating into
his very vitals. If Carmen would only leave him alone for a
moment that he could restore it to its place.</p>

<p>He plunged his hand furtively into his pocket, but by some
means unknown to him the rose had got entangled there. Nothing
short of cutting away the lining would be sufficient. Would that
woman by his side never go!</p>

<p>"You are ill?" Carmen asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I shall be better presently," Rosalba gasped. "A
sudden spasm. I am not used to them. If I am left alone for a
time."</p>

<p>But Carmen declined to move.</p>

<p>"I could not think of such a thing," she declared. "Come with
me, and I will find you a cordial. Anyone can see you are
suffering agonies."</p>

<p>With a smothered curse upon his lips, Rosalba complied. His
face was white and set, but no further groan of pain escaped him.
With the sweetest expression of solicitude upon her face, Carmen
administered to his requirements. Another guest claimed her
attention for a moment, and Rosalba grasped the opportunity.</p>

<p>He threaded his way dexterously through the dancers and made
for the hall. Beyond him lay the front door and safety. Another
minute and he would be free from that accursed thing. He turned
the handle savagely. The door was locked. A languid footman who
was standing there respectfully declined to open the portal.</p>

<p>"But I am ill, dying, man!" Rosalba said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I have not the key, sir," was the reply. "My
mistress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rosalba turned away with a groan. Once more he tugged savagely
at the accursed thing in his pocket, only to cause himself still
more exquisite pain. It seemed to have eaten into his very flesh.
In a vague kind of way Rosalba returned to the drawing-room to be
pounced upon by Carmen at once. He suffered himself to be led
into the inner drawing-room, where he sat down.</p>

<p>"Baron!" Carmen exclaimed, "you have only yourself to thank
for this."</p>

<p>"Why?" Rosalba asked, the combative instinct not yet
crushed.</p>

<p>"Because you are a thief," said Carmen; "because you stole my
golden rose. To deny it is futile, for both Dr. Colonna and
myself saw you. The thing is in your breast pocket at the present
moment. You little dreamt of the mechanism contained therein when
you elected to play the felon in my house. You can no more get
rid of that thing without assistance than you can fly. Am I to
denounce you to my guests as a vulgar pilferer who comes
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," Rosalba groaned; "I am not blind; like a fool I have
stepped into the trap, and like a fool I must pay the penalty.
Your price?"</p>

<p>"Your signature to the concession I have shown you."</p>

<p>"Which has been dictated to you by a master mind. To do such a
thing would be to place a rapier in the hands of my most
dangerous foe. I refuse."</p>

<p>Carmen's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "Let us see what powers of endurance
you possess. Can you put up with your present pain for nearly
three hours? Even then at the end your crime shall be
exposed."</p>

<p>Rosalba fumed with futile fury. Even then his strength was
nearly spent. It was just possible to sign that paper and
circumvent Carmen after all.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have the whip hand of me," he said, after a
long pause. "The paper!"</p>

<p>From a drawer Carmen produced the document in question. She
placed it, together with an inked pen, in Rosalba's hand. He
dashed his signature at the foot.</p>

<p>"That is well," said Carmen. "And now I will go and fetch the
wherewithal to free you from your pain. I will be no longer than
I can help."</p>

<p>So saying, Carmen darted from the room. Immediately outside
Colonna was listlessly lounging. With a smile of triumph Carmen
placed the paper in his hands.</p>

<p>"Victory," she whispered. "What am I to do now?"</p>

<p>"Carry out the rest of the programme," Colonna replied. "Offer
to try and rid Rosalba of his ingenious little Frankenstein.
Place your hand in his pocket carefully, and press the stud on
the stem of the rose. It is very simple."</p>

<p>With a bright nod of appreciation Carmen returned to the
drawing room. With some little hesitation she carried out
Colonna's instructions. A touch of her strong fingers, a little
click and the golden rose, apparently simple and harmless, lay in
her hand.</p>

<p>"There," she cried. "What surgeon could have done that
better?"</p>

<p>Something like a sob broke from Rosalba.</p>

<p>"I breathe again," he said, hoarsely. "May I look at that
instrument of the devil? No, keep it, never do I handle the thing
again. And now, madame, having been successful in your vile
scheme, perhaps you will permit me to depart."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," Carmen replied, with the most brilliant of
smiles. "I trust that you will bear no malice. I have merely got
the better of you in a little financial transaction."</p>

<p>"I bear no malice," Rosalba said, grimly, "but if ever you or
Colonna come under my thumb I'll crush you both with the greatest
possible pleasure."</p>

<p>After the Baron had at length departed, Colonna listened with
an amused smile to Carmen's graphic description. Then in a
carefully careless kind of way he placed the golden rose in a box
which he concealed in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Surely you will give me that!" Carmen suggested.</p>

<p>"No," was the firm reply. "There are many reasons against it.
And I think you are going to be well paid for your work. Let me
compliment you upon it, Carmen. I will see you again some time in
the morning."</p>

<p><br> COLONNA, ruminating over his matutinal cigarette, was
somewhat rudely interrupted by a visitor. Sir William Wallace
burst into the room, full of intense excitement.</p>

<p>"Have you seen a morning paper?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No," Colonna replied. "Is there anything startling?"</p>

<p>"Startling! I should say so indeed, Rosalba has committed
suicide. He was found dead in his room early this morning with a
bullet in his brains. I hope, Colonna, I hope sincerely that your
little scheme&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<br>

</div>
<br>

<p>"You can make your mind quite easy on that point," Colonna
said, calmly. "My scheme was quite successful, the concession was
duly signed, and if Rosalba committed suicide, beyond question he
did it out of mortification. And as long as we have the
concession, his representatives, or accomplices, are
powerless."</p>

<p>"I must own," Wallace answered, "that you have taken a weight
off my mind. Would you mind explaining the <i>modus
operandi</i>?"</p>

<p>"Delightfully simple. Rosalba was detected in an act of theft
in a private house, and he signed the concession as the price of
silence. As you are perfectly aware, there is a certain form of
hysteria which is part and parcel of the malady called
kleptomania. In my formulae I have a virus which, administered to
a person, causes an irresistible desire to pilfer. This I
administered to Rosalba, designing the poison to produce an
effect at a certain time."</p>

<p>"But how could you graduate it to a moment?"</p>

<p>"By personal experiments," Colonna said, calmly. "I tried a
series of doses on myself, taking care to remain here till the
effect had passed. In Rosalba's case the thing acted like
clockwork. As to the rest, fate placed in my hands a little
instrument that rendered success absolutely certain. When you
told me Rosalba had committed suicide I was as surprised as
yourself."</p>

<p>For a long time after his visitor had departed, Colonna sat
silent and thoughtful in his chair. Then at length he rose.</p>

<p>"There was no occasion to tell Wallace all the truth," he
said. "And it was best after all to remove Rosalba. So the
formula was right after all, and those poisoned needles in the
rose produced the desire for self-destruction, which Lucrezia
Borgia claimed for it. To cause your enemy to die by his own hand
seems an immense saving of risk and labor."</p>
