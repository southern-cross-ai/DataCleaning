<h3>"HERALD'S" NEW SERIAL. Story by E. Phillips Oppenheim. "THE BIRD OF
PARADISE."</h3>

<p class="quote">The new story by E. Phillips Oppenheim entitled "The <i>Bird of
Paradise</i>" of which the serial rights have been purchased by <i>The
Herald</i> will
begin to morrow.</p>

<p class="quote">A young American on his yacht, the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> in
the harbour at
Antibes, is puzzled by the desire he finds in visitors coming aboard at
different times to buy the vessel from him. His first mysterious experience is
when he finds a girl in full evening dress swimming alongside. The next is when
a man occupying an important position in the French Cabinet, who is accompanied
by a well-known banker, calls with a demand for sale at a high price. A French
gunboat slips into the harbour and drops anchor close to the yacht and remains
there. A fascinating danseuse is a visitor. And so on, and with the material of
conspiracies, French politics, love and adventure the story is woven around the
yacht with that peculiar polish in dialogue and fascinating colouring
characteristic of the popular author. The reader early gets an inkling of what
is afoot but the air of mystery never lapses and the necessity for finding out
what the ingenuity of the writer is leading up to will be found to continue and
grow right through to the end.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">Hamer Wildburn sat suddenly up in his wide and luxurious
cabin bed, with
  the start of the sound sleeper unexpectedly awakened. His hands clasped his
  pyjama clad knees. He listened intently. Through the wide open porthole
  opposite came the thirty seconds flash from Antibes lighthouse. From the
  shore road, which skirted the bay, there was the faint hoot of a belated
  motor car. Closer at hand the lazy murmur of the sea against the sides of his
  anchored yacht. Then more distinctly, he heard again the sound which had at
  first awakened him. This time there was no doubt about it. A human voice from
  the open space. A woman's cry of appeal. The soft but purposeful splashing of
  a swimmer keeping herself afloat...The young man hastened out of bed, ran up
  the companionway, and leaned over the side. What he saw almost immediately
  below was enough to startle anyone. A woman was floating upon her back, a
  woman, not in the day-by-day scanty but sufficient bathing dress of the
  moment, but a woman in evening dress, with the glint even of Jewels around
  her neck.</p>

  <p>"What on earth's the matter?" he called out "Have you fallen in from
  anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Please do not ask foolish questions," was the composed reply. "Let down
  your steps. I have upset my canoe, and I must come on board for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>Wildburn's hesitation was only momentary. He unscrewed the hooks, lowered
  the chain, and let down the steps into the sea. The woman, with a few tired
  strokes, swam towards him. She showed no particular signs of weakness or
  panic, but she clutched almost feverishly at his hand, and the moment she
  reached the deck she calmly but completely collapsed. With a thrill of
  horror, Wildburn realised that a portion of her black chiffon gown which
  clung so tightly to her body bore traces of a darker stain than the
  discolouration of the sea. His natural stream of questions died away upon his
  lips, as she became a dead weight upon his arm.</p>

  <p>There was a quivering narrow shaft of light piercing the skies eastwards
  when the woman opened her eyes. Wildburn gave a sigh of relief. He held a
  glass of brandy once more to her lips. Her fingers guided it and she sipped
  some feebly.</p>

  <p>"I will give you some coffee presently," he promised. "By an unfortunate
  chance, I am alone on the boat. I gave my <i>matelot</i> and his boy the
  night off."</p>

  <p>She fingered the blanket by which she was covered. A look of mild horror
  shone out of her eyes. Hanging from the ropes which supported the forward
  awning was a black shapeless object.</p>

  <p>"My gown!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I had to take it off," he explained coolly. "I was not sure whether you
  were seriously hurt. I am glad to find that you are not. I have bound up your
  shoulder. You may find it stiff and a little painful at first, from the salt
  water, but it is not serious."</p>

  <p>She lay quite still. Her hands were underneath the rug. From a very damp
  satin bag she produced a handkerchief, and wiped her forehead.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was necessary for you to play lady's maid?" she asked
  weakly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he assured her. "You were still bleeding, and I could not
  tell how serious your wound might be I&mdash;er&mdash;exercised every
precaution."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him earnestly. Apparently her scrutiny of his features
  satisfied her. Wildburn was not good looking in the ordinary sense of the
  word, but he had pleasant features, a freckled, sunburnt complexion, and the
  humourous gleam of understanding in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you did what you thought was best," she said. "I ran my canoe
  into one of those stationary fishing boats."</p>

  <p>If it occurred to him to make any comment upon her journeying amongst them
  at an early hour in the morning, alone and in evening dress, he
  refrained.</p>

  <p>"I always said that they ought to show a light," he remarked. "I have seen
  your canoe. It is drifting in shorewards."</p>

  <p>"Give me some more brandy," she begged. "I wish to speak to you before we
  are disturbed."</p>

  <p>"I can hear the kettle boiling now," he told her. Wouldn't you like
  coffee?"</p>

  <p>"Coffee would be better," she admitted. "You are being very kind to me. I
  thank you."</p>

  <p>Still somewhat dazed, Wildburn descended the steps, made the coffee, and
  remounted.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he apologised, "that there will be no milk. They bring it to
  me from the shore at seven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"It smells too delicious as it is," she declared.</p>

  <p>"If you will swing a little round," he advised her, "with another cushion
  or two behind your back you will be more comfortable. You can sit up now and,
  you see, I will put this rug round your knees. Directly you have had your
  coffee you had better go down to my cabin and take off the remainder of your
  wet things."</p>

  <p>"You have perhaps a stock of ladies clothing on board?" she asked
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"If I had known of your projected visit," he replied, "I should have
  provided some. As it is you will have to content yourself with a set or my
  pyjamas. You will find them in the bottom drawer of the wardrobe by the side
  of the bed."</p>

  <p>She looked at him meditatively. Wildburn was a trifle over six feet, and
  she herself, slim and elegant as she seemed, could scarcely have been more
  than five feet five. Furthermore, Wildburn was broad shouldered with a man's
  full chest. She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am going to look ridiculous," she complained.</p>

  <p>"I should forget that for the moment," he ventured, as he set down her
  empty coffee cup. "You seem to be quite warm. I wonder whether you are
  feeling strong enough to satisfy my curiosity before you go down below."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked around the harbour. There were no unusual lights, no indications
  of any other yacht having come in during the night.</p>

  <p>"Well, where you come from first of all. Then why you choose to paddle
  about the bay in the small hours of the morning in your ordinary evening
  clothes, and lastly, why you should choose my boat for your objective."</p>

  <p>She was watching that broadening shaft of light uneasily.</p>

  <p>"What is the time?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Five o'clock," he told her. "Do you mind if I smoke a cigarette whilst
  you explain your adventure?"</p>

  <p>"I will smoke one too." she said, holding out her hand. "As to explaining
  my adventure, I find it difficult. You smoke good tobacco, I am glad to see.
  Thank you," she added as she leaned towards his <i>briquet</i>.</p>

  <p>There was a silence. As yet there were no signs of life either on the
  small <i>plage</i> or anywhere upon the sea. They were surrounded by the
  brooding background of the woods which fringed the inlet. The lights in the
  few villas had long been extinguished. The tops of a row of tall cypresses
  stood out like dark smudges against the coming dawn.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked after a brief pause.</p>

  <p>"After all, I find it difficult," she admitted. "Where I came from it does
  not matter. I started, as you perceive, in a hurry, I am rather impulsive.
  There was something which had to be done."</p>

  <p>"Something which had to be done between three and four o'clock in the
  morning by a young lady still wearing valuable jewellery and dressed for the
  evening sounds," he pointed out, "mysterious."</p>

  <p>"Life," she told him evasively, "is mysterious."</p>

  <p>"You will have to be a little more definite," he insisted, with some
  impatience. "I have done my best to help you under these singular
  circumstances, but I want to know where you came from and what you want."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," she murmured, drawing the blanket more securely around her.</p>

  <p>"Think it over for a few minutes," he proposed. "Go down below&mdash;the
hatch
  is open&mdash;five steps, first door to the right, and you will come to a very
  untidy cabin. There are plenty of clean towels on the settee. I have rubbed
  you as best I could. You had better try and get yourself quite dry. Put on
  some pyjamas and my dressing gown&mdash;which you will find there&mdash;then
come up
  and explain yourself."</p>

  <p>"You will trust me in your cabin then," she observed, struggling to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I? You do not appear to be in distressed circumstances and
  I have nothing in the world worth stealing."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment with an expression which baffled him.</p>

  <p>"Are you as honest as you seem?" she asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he answered, mystified.</p>

  <p>Without further comment she rose to her feet and, holding the blanket
  about her as though it were an ermine cape, disappeared down the stairs.
  Wildburn waited for what seemed to him to be an unconscionable time, then he
  poured out another cup of coffee, lit a fresh cigarette, and strolled round
  the deck. Once more in the misty twilight of dawn he satisfied himself that
  no strange craft had entered the bay during the night. The tiny restaurant on
  the <i>plage</i> was still closed. The beautiful <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> which,
  with its thickly growing woods, occupied the whole of the western side of the
  bay offered no signs of life. The windows of the few villas on the other side
  were still lifeless blanks...He paused before the sodden black frock flapping
  in the faint breeze, took it down and shook it. A fragment of the sash
  disclosed within the name of a world famous dressmaker. Then he turned round
  to find his unaccountable visitor standing by the side of him.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know that I look ridiculous," she admitted querulously. "I
  hope that your manners will stand the strain and that you will not laugh at
  me."</p>

  <p>The tell-tale lines at the corners of his eyes and mouth deepened, but if
  he felt any inclination towards mirth he restrained it.</p>

  <p>"I never realised that I had such good taste in night apparel," he assured
  her. "The prospect of your immediate future however, causes me&mdash;I must
  confess&mdash;some disquietude. Perhaps you are staying near here&mdash;at
some place
  where I can send for clothes?"</p>

  <p>"We will see about that presently," she replied. "It is a matter of no
  great importance."</p>

  <p>She seemed to find the twinkle in his eyes, as he stole another look at
  her, unduly irritating.</p>

  <p>"These things are all trifles," she declared with a frown. "Where I live
  or who I am does not matter. What do you want to know about me?"</p>

  <p>"Let's get to something definite," he begged. "What were you doing
  swimming round my boat at three o'clock in the morning in an evening frock
  from the Rue de la Paix?"</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"So you realised that?"</p>

  <p>"No more evasions, please," he insisted sternly. "Facts."</p>

  <p>"I came," she confided, "to pay you a visit."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you," he acknowledged. "You have robbed me of two or three
  hours' sleep, you have given me a great deal of anxiety, and even now I have
  not the faintest idea as to who you are or what you could want from me.
  Please be more explicit."</p>

  <p>"You can give me another cigarette first," she demanded.</p>

  <p>He handed her his case and <i>briquet</i>. "And now?"</p>

  <p>"First of all, let me be sure that I am not making a mistake," she
  continued. "Your name is Hamer Wildburn? This is the yacht <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Correct."</p>

  <p>"A very delightful boat."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me. And then?"</p>

  <p>"Is it for sale?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not." She sighed.</p>

  <p>"That makes it more difficult. Will you sell it?"</p>

  <p>He considered the matter for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Why should I? It exactly suits me, and I am not in urgent need of money.
  I should only have to go and buy another one. No, I will not sell it."</p>

  <p>For the second or third time she looked anxiously out seawards. She was
  watching the point around which incoming vessels must enter the bay.</p>

  <p>"Will you charter it?" she persisted. "For a month if you like, even for a
  shorter time?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't dream of such a thing," he assured her. "I have owned half a
  dozen small boats in my lifetime. I have never chartered one of them. I have
  just filled up with stores, and all my belongings are on board. I have
  settled down until the late autumn. There was never anyone less anxious to
  part with one of his possessions than I am to part with this little
  boat."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet with a staccato cry which thrilled him. Above the low
  land on the other side of the point a thin wireless mast was suddenly
  visible. The powerful engines of a large motor yacht broke the stillness. The
  woman's expression became haggard. That far-off monotonous sound was like the
  tocsin of fate.</p>

  <p>"Hamer Wildburn," she said, "I have risked my life in this enterprise,
  which I suppose you look upon only as an act of folly."</p>

  <p>"I simply do not understand it," he protested.</p>

  <p>"I was at my villa in Mougins last night. I received a telephone
  message&mdash;something very important. Directly I received it I drove
myself down
  here. My car is still there under the trees. There was no one to bring me to
  your boat&mdash;the little restaurant was locked up. There was not a soul on
the
  beach, nothing but a darkness which seemed impenetrable. I took a
canoe&mdash;you
  know what happened to me. I ran into one of those fishing boats and swam the
  rest of the way. Do you think it was a trifle which made me so
  desperate?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," he admitted, thoroughly dazed. "But what is it all about?
  What do you want my boat in particular for? There are hundreds just like
  it."</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you why I want it," she declared hopelessly. "That is the
  hateful part of the whole business. It is a matter of dire secrecy. But I
  will tell you this&mdash;before many days are past you will sell or part
with it
  to someone. It may be taken from you by force. If you are obstinate it may
  cost you your life. Why not deal with me? I am the first to come to you. I am
  told that you bought it in Marseilles harbour for something under two
  thousand pounds. Let me put some men on board and take it away this morning
  and I will give you a cheque for four thousand pounds on the Credit Lyonnais.
  You will see my name then and you will know that it will be met. Make up your
  mind please, quickly. Listen! What is it that approaches?"</p>

  <p>He answered without turning round. His eyes were fixed upon the paler beam
  from the lighthouse. The twilight of dawn had settled upon the grey sea.</p>

  <p>"That is only a fishing boat going out," he said, listening for a moment
  to the soft swish of the oars. "There is a mist falling. Come below into the
  cabin and we will discuss this matter."<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Auguste, <i>matelot</i> and assistant navigator of the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>, brought the dinghy round to the side of the yacht. He looked
  with surprise at the steps.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has perhaps taken an early swim," Jean, his subordinate
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Auguste was a man of apprehensions. He glanced around and the longer he
  looked the less he liked the appearance of things.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur would not use the steps," he pointed out. "Besides, he is
  nowhere in sight. There is one of the canoes from the beach, too, floating
  there which has been capsized."</p>

  <p>With a few swift strokes he reached the steps, backed water deftly and
  swung round. He pulled himself on to the deck and left Jean to attach the
  boat. There were signs of disturbance everywhere&mdash;rugs thrown about the
place
  where someone had sat in damp clothes, empty glasses, empty coffee cups.
  Auguste scratched his head in perplexity. The situation might have seemed
  obvious enough but Monsieur Wildburn was not like that. He descended the
  companionway with hasty footsteps. There was silence below but the door of
  the little salon was closed. He opened it and peered inside. There were
  evidences of recent occupation there&mdash;wine glasses and a bottle of
  brandy&mdash;but no sign of any human being. He knocked at the door of the
cabin
  opposite. There was no reply. He turned the handle and looked cautiously in.
  At the first glance he scented tragedy. His feet seemed frozen to the mat. He
  tried to call out, and he was noted amongst the seamen of the port as being a
  lusty shouter, but this time his effort was in vain. The cabin itself was in
  the wildest disorder and doubled up across its floor, his arms outstretched,
  faint groans dribbling from his lips, the owner of the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i> was facing the last act in the drama of that strange
  morning.</p>

  <p>An hour later, settled on deck in a <i>chaise longue</i> piled up with
  cushions, with his face turned windwards and a cup of tea by his side, Hamer
  Wildburn felt life once more stirring in his pulses. The colour was slowly
  returning to his healthy sunburnt face. His breathing was more natural.
  Auguste watched him with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is better?" he demanded interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"Nothing left but a thumping headache and that passes,"' the young man
  acknowledged. "Why is Jean bringing the dinghy round?"</p>

  <p>"One goes to acquaint the <i>gendarmerie</i>, Monsieur," Auguste
  replied.</p>

  <p>"One does nothing of the sort," was the sharp rejoinder.</p>

  <p>Auguste's eyes grew round with surprise.</p>

  <p>"But Monsieur has been drugged!" he exclaimed. "That Monsieur himself
  admitted. He has also been robbed without a doubt. Every drawer in the cabin
  is open. The one with the false front has been smashed. Thieves have been at
  work here without a doubt."</p>

  <p>"I do not believe that I have been robbed Auguste," his master replied.
  "There is nothing worth stealing upon the boat. In any case I do not want any
  gendarme or the Commissaire of Police or anyone of that sort down here. I
  forbid either you or Jean to say a word about this happening."</p>

  <p>Auguste was disappointed. He had seen himself the hero of a small
  sensation.</p>

  <p>"It must be as Monsieur wishes, of course," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"It must if you want to keep your posts, you two," the young man told
  them. "Now, listen to me. Did you seen an overturned canoe when you came
  in?"</p>

  <p>"But certainly," Auguste replied. "It was one of those left for hire at
  the <i>plage</i>. Jean took it back some time ago."</p>

  <p>"Where is the small dinghy?"</p>

  <p>"Jean found it upon the <i>plage</i> and brought it back, Monsieur,"
  Auguste explained. "It would seem that the thief of last night first of all
  took the canoe from the <i>plage</i>, ran into something, for the bows are
  badly damaged, perhaps swim to the boat and took the small dinghy for the
  return journey."</p>

  <p>"Excellent Auguste," his master said approvingly. "You are probably right.
  Now go to the shore and have a look at the end of the road under the trees
  Tell me if there are any fresh signs of a motor car having stood there during
  the night. Let me know at once if you discover anything."</p>

  <p>"And Monsieur does not wish me to approach the gendarmes?" the man asked
  as he turned away.</p>

  <p>"I forbid it," was the firm injunction. "You will go straight to the spot
  I have told you of and return here."</p>

  <p>Auguste executed his commission and returned within a quarter of an
  hour.</p>

  <p>"A heavy car has been standing there recently, Monsieur," he reported.
  "Louget&mdash;he is one of the boatmen down at the <i>plage</i>&mdash;told
me that he
  had seen a coupe turn out of the road just as he arrived about an hour
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Did he notice the occupant?"</p>

  <p>"But that he was too slim and small," Auguste recounted, "Louget would
  have believed him to have been Monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Wildburn asked. "No one would call me either slim or small."</p>

  <p>"It was because of the clothes, Monsieur," Auguste explained. "The driver
  was apparently wearing a fawn-coloured pullover such as Monsieur sometimes
  has on, and a yachting <i>casquette</i>."</p>

  <p>"Go and see if anything is missing from my cabin," Wildburn directed.
  "Don't stop to clear up. I shall probably do that myself later on."</p>

  <p>This time Auguste's absence was a brief one.</p>

  <p>"The pullover such as Louget described is missing," he announced. "Also
  the casquette."</p>

  <p>The young man sighed.</p>

  <p>"We progress, Auguste," he said, finishing his tea and sitting up in his
  chair. "Without the help of the police we have discovered in what garb the
  thief made his escape and the manner of his doing so. I am also minus a
  lamb's-wool pullover, to which I was greatly attached."</p>

  <p>Auguste had apparently lost interest in the affair. He tied up the dinghy
  and looked over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Has Monsieur any commands for the morning?"</p>

  <p>"None at present."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur does not wish for the services of a doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," Wildburn replied irritably. "There's nothing whatever
  the matter with me. I may have had one drink too many."</p>

  <p>"It is always possible," Auguste admitted. "In the meantime, what does
  Monsieur propose to do with this?"</p>

  <p>He produced from under his coat and shook out that very exquisite but
  fantastic fragment of lace and crepe georgette from which Wildburn had torn
  off one sleeve In the small hours of the morning. He hold it out fluttering
  in the morning breeze. Wildburn studied it meditatively.</p>

  <p>"It resembles a lady's gown, Auguste," he observed.</p>

  <p>Auguste was not discussing the matter. As a matter of fact, he was a
  disappointed man. He was no lover of women himself, and he fancied that in
  his master he had met with a kindred spirit.</p>

  <p>"Put it downstairs in the salon, Auguste. Another piece of evidence we
  have collected, you see. Very soon we shall probably be able to lay our hands
  upon the culprit without calling in the police at all."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur's cabin is in a state of great disorder," Auguste reported. "It
  would be as well to go through his effects and see if anything has been
  stolen. The box which Monsieur calls his <i>caisse noire</i> does not appear
  to be in its place."</p>

  <p>Wildburn rose to his feet and made his way below. He looked around his
  cabin critically. Nearly every drawer had been pulled out, and in some cases
  the contents had been emptied onto the floor. Every possible hiding-place
  seemed to have been ransacked, and a collection of letters, ties, shirts, and
  wearing apparel of every sort littered up the place. Two panels had been
  smashed with some heavy instrument. The cabin, in fact, bore every trace of a
  feverish search. Wildburn sat on the edge of the bed and lit a cigarette. He
  was a harmless young man of twenty-six, who had graduated from Harvard some
  four years ago, and he was picking up a little experience in journalism on
  the staff of one of his father's papers. There were no complications in his
  life. He had never sought adventure in its more romantic forms, nor had
  adventure sought him. There was certainly nothing amongst his possessions
  worthy of the attention of so elegant a woman as his visitor of a few hours
  before, a woman, too, who was prepared to write a cheque for four thousand
  pounds. And yet, however long he considered the matter, certain facts
  remained indisputable. A woman who was a perfect stranger to him had boarded
  his ship alone at 3 o'clock in the morning, had ransacked his belongings,
  and, in order to do so undisturbed, had resorted to the old-fashioned method
  of doctoring his coffee! Once again he asked himself the question&mdash;what
was
  there amongst his very ordinary possessions which should plunge him, without
  any warning, into the middle of so curious an adventure?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">The flash from the Antibes lighthouse, which had been
growing paler and
  paler in the opalescent light, suddenly ceased. There was a faint pink
  colouring now in the clouds eastward. A sort of hush seemed to have fallen
  upon the sea. Morning had arrived. Upon the deck of the shapely
yet&mdash;with its
  black hull&mdash;somewhat sinister-looking yacht, which had crept slowly
into the
  bay during the hours of velvety twilight, a man in silk pyjamas and dressing
  gown was strolling slowly up and down. The captain, who had been
  superintending the final lowering of the anchors, approached and saluted him
  respectfully.</p>

  <p>"This, Monsieur le Baron," he announced, "is the Bay of Caroupe."</p>

  <p>The man in the pyjamas nodded. He was somewhat thickly built and inclined
  towards corpulence, but he carried himself with confidence and a certain
  distinction. He spoke French, too, but with scarcely a Parisian accent.</p>

  <p>"The place has a pleasant aspect," he remarked. "One wonders to find it so
  deserted. An American boat, I see," he went on, pointing to the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>.</p>

  <p>The captain was full of information&mdash;crisp and eloquent.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, Monsieur le Baron. A schooner yacht built in
  Marseilles by English men&mdash;thirty tons or so. The property of Mr. Hamer
  Wildburn&mdash;an American. He is apparently on board at the present
moment."</p>

  <p>"And how did you gather all this information?" the other inquired.</p>

  <p>"I looked him up in the 'Yacht Chronicle,' Monsieur," the captain
  confided. "In a small harbour such as this I like to know who my neighbours
  are."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that the owner is on board himself?"</p>

  <p>"They hoisted the house burgee at sunrise with the Stars and Stripes."</p>

  <p>The man in pyjamas threw away the stump of his cigarette and lit another
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Her lines seem to me to be good," he remarked. "She has no appearance to
  you, Captain, of having been built for any specific purpose?"</p>

  <p>"None that I can discover, Monsieur," was the somewhat puzzled reply. "She
  has all the ordinary points of a schooner yacht of her tonnage and
  description."</p>

  <p>The Baron stared across at the small vessel riding so peacefully at
  anchor, and if his close survey did not indicate any intimate nautical
  knowledge it nevertheless betrayed intense interest.</p>

  <p>"Does Monsieur Mermillon know that we have arrived?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"He was called as we entered the bay," the captain replied. "Those were
  his orders. Behold, Monsieur arrives."</p>

  <p>A slim man of early middle-age, tall, and of distinguished appearance,
  with a broad forehead and masses of iron-grey hair, emerged from the
  companionway. The Baron, whom he greeted with a courteous nod and a wave of
  the hand, advanced to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Our information, it appears, was correct so far, Edouard," he confided.
  "That small boat there is the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. It gives one rather a
  thrill to look at her, eh, and to realise that there may be truth in Badoit's
  statement?"</p>

  <p>Monsieur Edouard Mermillon, at that moment perhaps the most talked-about
  man in Europe, strolled with his friend towards the rail and gazed
  thoughtfully across the hundred yards or so which separated them from the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>.</p>

  <p>"Dying men are supposed to have a penchant for speaking the truth," he
  observed. "I myself believe in his story. It is perhaps unfortunate under the
  circumstances that the boat should be owned by an American."</p>

  <p>The Baron, whose full name was the Baron Albert de Brett, shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What docs it matter?" he remarked. "The Americans have their fancy for a
  bargain like the men of every other race. I was wondering when you proposed
  to visit him."</p>

  <p>"I see no great cause for haste," Mermillon replied. "It is obvious that
  the owner of the boat has no idea of the truth or he would not be lying here
  without any pretence at concealment."</p>

  <p>His friend evidently held different views. He shook his head
  disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," he declared, "not a minute should be wasted. Imagine if
  there should be a leak in our information&mdash;if others should suspect."</p>

  <p>"Seven o'clock in the morning is an early calling hour," Mermillon
  observed.</p>

  <p>"On an occasion like this," was the swift retort, "one does not stand upon
  ceremony."</p>

  <p>"The <i>petit dejeuner</i>," Mermillon suggested.</p>

  <p>"After that I consent."</p>

  <p>The Baron ceded the point.</p>

  <p>"We will proceed to that as soon as possible then," he said. "I shall not
  have an easy moment until we are in touch with this American."</p>

  <p>Over coffee and rolls, which were served on deck, the Baron became
  meditative. He seemed scarcely able to remove his eyes from the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," he declared finally, crumbling a roll between his
  fingers, "our plans as they stand at present are indifferently made. They
  involve possible delay, and delay might well mean unutterable catastrophe. I
  am inclined to think that Chicotin's method would be the best solution."</p>

  <p>His host regarded him tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Chicotin should be our last resource, my dear Albert," he insisted. "Such
  methods carry no certainty, no conviction. They involve also risk."</p>

  <p>"The risk I cannot appreciate," de Brett argued. "On the contrary, I look
  upon destruction&mdash;absolute annihilation&mdash;as the safest, the only
logical
  course open to us."</p>

  <p>The steel grey eyes of his companion flashed for a moment with eager
  longing. His indifference was momentarily abandoned. There was an underlying
  note of passion in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Annihilation, my dear Baron," he murmured. "Who but a child would not
  realise what that would mean to us? Surely there were never six men in this
  universe who suffered so much for one mistake. We suffer&mdash;we shall go on
  suffering until the end. But your method of annihilation is crude. How can we
  be sure that we are arriving at it? We are working upon presumption. We
  believe, but we need certainty. Every inch of that lazy-looking craft might
  drift to the skies in ashes or to the bottom of the sea in melting metal. We
  could see the place where she is riding so gracefully an empty blank, but yet
  we should never know. There would be always moments when the nightmare would
  return and fear would visit us in the night."</p>

  <p>The Boron wiped his closely cropped brown moustache with his napkin. He
  considered the problem, and sighed. Something in his companion's voice had
  been convincing.</p>

  <p>"I agree," he sighed. "A moment's doubt would plunge the souls of all of
  us into agony. We will approach this young American. We are fortunate that it
  is not too late."</p>

  <p>There came the sound of a gentle ticking, a purring in the air, and then
  again a ticking. The Baron started.</p>

  <p>"Your private wireless, Edouard. I thought you were closed off."</p>

  <p>"I am in touch with only two men in the world," Mermillon replied.
  "Gabriel, the editor of the 'Grand Journal,' and Paul himself."</p>

  <p>"Paul would never permit himself to speak on any wireless," de Brett
  declared anxiously.</p>

  <p>"The very fact that he is risking it," Mermillon observed, with a slight
  shrug of the shoulders, "convinces one that the matter is urgent. We shall
  know in a minute at any rate."</p>

  <p>The Baron lit a cigarette. He had fat pudgy hands, on one of the fingers
  of which he wore a massive signet ring. They trembled so that even his slight
  task was difficult. His host of the expressionless face watched him. A smile
  of contempt would have made him seem more human.</p>

  <p>"Your man Jules can decode?" de Brett asked.</p>

  <p>"He is capable of that," was the quiet reply. "Our code has been committed
  to memory by seven people. He is one. It has never been set down in print or
  ink. It has no existence save in the brains of the two men who compiled it
  and the five who understand it. Yes, my dear friend," Mermillon added,
  lifting his head and listening to the approaching footsteps, "Jules can
  decode, and in a moment we shall know whether our friend is simply telling us
  news of the weather in Paris or whether the wild beasts are loose."</p>

  <p>A neatly dressed young man, wearing blue serge trousers, a blue shirt, and
  yachting cap, presented himself and bowed to Mermillon.</p>

  <p>"A brief message and very easily decoded, Monsieur," he announced. "It is
  from your private bureau. Monsieur Paul desires to inform you that General
  Perissol has ordered out his most powerful 'plane and is leaving his private
  flying ground this morning."</p>

  <p>"His destination?"</p>

  <p>"That will be wirelessed to us as soon as he starts. At any rate, he is
  coming south."</p>

  <p>The Baron's eyes were almost like beads as he gazed out at the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i> rolling slightly in the swell. Even his imperturbable companion
  had glanced immediately in the some direction.</p>

  <p>"Where was the General when the message was sent?" the latter
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"With the Chief of the Police at his private house in the Bois de
  Boulogne."</p>

  <p>De Brett moistened his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"An early call that," he muttered. "It is now a quarter to eight. There
  are signs of life upon the boat yonder."</p>

  <p>Mermillon rose to his feet and gave a brief order to one of the sailors.
  In a few moments there was the sound of quick explosions from a small motor
  dinghy which had shot round to the lowered gangway. The two men embarked and
  crossed the little sheet of shimmering water which separated them from the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>.</p>

  <p>"Abandon for my special pleasure, Albert," his companion begged, "that
  appearance of a man who mounts the guillotine. We are going to pay a friendly
  call upon an unknown American and make him a business proposition which
  cannot fail to be of interest. The matter is simplicity itself. We loitered
  before in a room where the very whispers spelt death, but I never noticed on
  that occasion that your complexion assumed such an unbecoming hue. Remember,
  dear Baron," his friend concluded, "that fear is the twin sister of danger.
  The greatest agony can be ended by death, and one can only die once."</p>

  <p>The Baron's rotund body ceased to shake. His features stiffened. His
  companion had succeeded in what had obviously been his desire&mdash;he had
made a
  man of him.</p>

  <p>"Why these sickening platitudes?" he exclaimed. "We must all have our fits
  of nerves&mdash;except you, perhaps. Permit me mine. They will pass when the
  danger comes. You others have less to fear than I. It is not one knife that
  will be at my throat if the fates desert me. It will be a thousand&mdash;a
hundred
  thousand!"</p>

  <p>"All the more reason for courage and self-restraint," was the smoothly
  spoken reply. "I say no more. Remember that we are arrived. Our host is
  already in sight. He seems prepared to receive us. Jean," he added, turning
  to the mechanic, "Monsieur seems to indicate that the gangway is down on the
  other side. With this swell it would naturally be so. We wish to go on board.
  We are paying a visit to Monsieur."</p>

  <p>Everything was made quite easy for the two callers. The rope from the
  dinghy was caught by a waiting seaman, and Hamer Wildburn, leaning down
  himself, extended a steadying hand. Minister of State Edouard Mermillon
  stepped lightly on to the deck. His companion followed him. The <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>, for the second time within a few hours, was to receive visitors
  of distinction.</p>

  <p>"Say, you two are early birds," Hamer Wildburn observed with a welcoming
  smile. "What can I do for you gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"First of all pardon us for the informality of this call," Mermillon
  begged. "We should have waited until later in the day, but the matter is
  pressing."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," the other answered. "I watched you come in an hour or
  so ago. A fine boat, that of yours. A fast one, too, I should think."</p>

  <p>"Our engines are exceedingly powerful," Mermillon admitted. "To tell you
  the truth, however, for the moment I am more interested in your boat than in
  my own. You call her, I think, the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>?"</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"And she was built at Marseilles?"</p>

  <p>"Designed by an Englishman. She was built by the firm of Partrout. They
  are French, of course, but as a matter of fact every man employed upon her
  was, I believe, English."</p>

  <p>"My name," the newcomer announced, "is Mermillon."</p>

  <p>"Not Monsieur Edouard Mermillon, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs?"
  Wildburn exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"That is so," Mermillon acknowledged. "My companion here is Baron Albeit
  de Brett."</p>

  <p>"Proud to know you both," was the courteous but somewhat mystified,
  rejoinder. "My name is Wildburn&mdash;Hamer Wildburn&mdash;and I come from New
  York."</p>

  <p>De Brett looked at the young American curiously.</p>

  <p>"That is odd," he observed. "I cannot remember meeting you before, Mr
  Wildburn, but your name sounds familiar."</p>

  <p>The young man offered his cigarette case.</p>

  <p>"I write occasionally for one of the American newspapers, which is
  published in Paris," he confided, "and I sometimes sign my name."</p>

  <p>"The reason for this visit," Mermillon intervened, "is easily disclosed. I
  have a nephew who comes of age within a few weeks, and whose great passion is
  for the sea. I should like to buy exactly this type of craft as a present for
  him. If by any remote chance, Monsieur Wildburn, this boat itself is for sale
  it would give me the utmost pleasure to pay you what you consider her
  value."</p>

  <p>"You want to buy my boat?" Wildburn exclaimed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"That was rather the idea," Mermillon admitted. "Why does that fact afford
  you so much surprise?"</p>

  <p>"Because only a few hours ago," the young man told him, "someone else paid
  me a visit with the same object."</p>

  <p>"You did not sell her?" the Baron interrupted anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," Wildburn assured them "Nothing doing with the first
  would-be purchaser and nothing doing with you gentlemen. I am delighted to
  see you both, but I am sorry you have had the trouble of coming. My boat is
  not for sale."</p>

  <p>"There is one question I would like to ask," the Baron ventured eagerly.
  "Who has been here before us wanting to buy the boat?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Albert!" Mermillon remonstrated, "We must not be too inquisitive.
  I know my friend's idea of course," he continued, turning back to Wildburn.
  "He is wondering whether some other member of my family has had the same idea
  or perhaps even Claude, my nephew, himself. This," he added, turning round,
  "is so exactly what the lad has always wanted."</p>

  <p>"The offer came from&mdash;no matter where." Wildburn said. "I have no
reason
  to believe, however, that it came from anyone of your own people. In any case
  it makes no difference. The boat is not for sale."</p>

  <p>Mermillon had the air of one suffering from a mild but not insupportable
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"You would not object, Monsieur Wildburn, I hope," he asked, "if I ordered
  from the builders the exact duplicate of this admirable craft?"</p>

  <p>"I should not have the faintest objection in the world," Wildburn assured
  him, "but it would take them at least ten months to build a boat of this
  description."</p>

  <p>Mermillon threw up his hands.</p>

  <p>"Ten months&mdash;but it is unbelievable!" he exclaimed. "The young are not
  used to such delays. To wait for ten months would be impossible. Under those
  regrettable circumstances Monsieur Wildburn," he went on after a momentary
  pause, "you will not be offended if I ask whether this decision of yours not
  to sell your boat is absolutely final. I am only a French politician, not a
  world-famed banker like my friend here, and, as you know, French politicians
  are not amongst the wealthy ones of the world. Still, in the present
  instance, I might almost say that money is no object."</p>

  <p>Wildburn appeared a little distressed. His visitor's tone and manner were
  alike charming.</p>

  <p>"I have been one of your sincere admirers, Monsieur Mermillon," he said,
  "and I should hate to seem in any way discourteous to a person of such
  distinction, but the fact of it is that just now I am not in need of money,
  and the boat suits me exactly. Instead of finishing my vacation, as I had
  planned, cruising around in these seas, I should have all the trouble of
  dealing with specifications and superintending the rebuilding of another
  boat. Allow me to offer you chairs. Auguste!" he called out "Deck chairs here
  for these gentlemen."</p>

  <p>The two visitors were soon comfortably ensconced. Their host produced
  cigarettes and cigars. Mermillon resumed the conversation.</p>

  <p>"It is obvious," he remarked "that the matter would present inconveniences
  to you. That I should take into account."</p>

  <p>"It would be a beastly nuisance," Hamer Wildburn assented. "That is why I
  am afraid I must remain obstinate. I love France, but I hate Marseilles. I
  have no wish to return there. What I want to do is to spend the rest of the
  summer idling about here."</p>

  <p>"I do not blame you," Mermillon declared. "I find it very natural. The
  situation is delightful, and you have, doubtless, many friends. Still, there
  is this to be considered&mdash;I do not weary you by my persistence, I
trust."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Wildburn assured him, "but I am afraid you will find
  me very ungracious. Believe me, I honestly do not wish to sell the boat. It
  would interest me a great deal more to congratulate you upon some of your
  marvellous successes in the world of international politics."</p>

  <p>Mermillon bowed.</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," he acknowledged, smiling. "I must explain this, however
  before I&mdash;throw up the sponge. Is not that how you call it? Apart from my
  official position I possess, as you may have heard, a considerable fortune. I
  have such simple tastes in life that money with me has lost its significance.
  You will excuse the vulgarity of this statement. It comes into our
  discussion."</p>

  <p>"No vulgarity at all," Wildburn assured his visitor "You should hear some
  of our westerners at home talk about their dollars. I am frankly delighted to
  meet a man over on this side who admits that he has any money left. It seems
  to be the fashion everywhere to plead poverty. I am rather tired of meeting
  poor men. This means, I suppose," he added, "that I can write my own cheque
  if I consider giving up the boat?"</p>

  <p>Mermlllon smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not quite," he said "It might come very nearly to that if you are the man
  of common sense I think you are."</p>

  <p>"May I make a suggestion?" de Brett intervened. "My friend Mermillon here
  has shown me a side of his character which I must confess that I never knew
  before. He is as impetuous as a boy about this present he wishes to make his
  nephew. I am afraid I am of a more cautions temperament. May I suggest that
  before discussing the matter further we just take a look below and a glance
  at the engines? For what else am I here?"</p>

  <p>"With the greatest pleasure," Wildburn replied, rising promptly to his
  feet. "Follow me, gentlemen. After your yacht, Monsieur Mermillon, you will
  find it a little cramped, but there is plenty of room for one
person&mdash;or even
  two."</p>

  <p>The three men descended the companionway. They inspected the owner's
  cabin, which certainly had its charm. They glanced at thee galley, and
  appreciated the power and condition of the Diesel engines. They ended in the
  salon, which was as handsome as a liberal expenditure and good taste could
  make it.</p>

  <p>"I came prepared to criticise," de Brett confessed. "I am lost in
  admiration."</p>

  <p>Mermillon seemed for the moment to have lost interest in the details which
  he had been admiring so generously. He was gazing at a particular spot on the
  carpet of the small salon. Wildburn perceived his diverted attention and
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"My <i>matelot</i> had a day off yesterday," he explained. "I am afraid
  that you find the place a little untidy."</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely that, Monsieur Wildburn," the visitor replied courteously.
  "There is some derangement of the apartment, it is true, but it was something
  else which attracted me. You are alone here, I think you said?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly am."</p>

  <p>Mermillon stooped lightly down and picked up from the carpet the object
  which had attracted his attention. He held it out to Wildburn. It was a very
  beautiful emerald of large size and finely cut!</p>

  <p>"No wonder there are others besides myself," he remarked, "who would be
  willing to pay you a large price for your yacht if there is much jewellery of
  this description to be picked up."</p>

  <p>The young American's face was suddenly dark. His voice lost its
  smoothness. His attempted indifference was badly assumed.</p>

  <p>"I have visitors occasionally," he admitted. "Thank you for the emerald. I
  have no doubt that my latest visitor will be here to claim it very soon."</p>

  <p>"She should not be blamed," Mermillon murmured. "I am a judge of gems, and
  I must confess that I envy her the possession of that one. However, we did
  not come here to discuss precious stones. I am satisfied with all that you
  have shown me, Monsieur Wildburn. I want your boat. My cheque book is at your
  disposal."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to seem obstinate," Hamer Wildburn said smiling. "I will
  sell her to you on one condition."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"That I deliver her in two months' time after I have finished my
  cruise."</p>

  <p>The eyebrows of Edouard Mermillon were slightly upraised, and the Baron
  frankly scowled. It was obvious that both men were disappointed.</p>

  <p>"In two months' time," the former pointed out, "my nephew's birthday will
  be forgotten. The cruising season will be over. My gift would have no
  significance. If you are willing to sell at all I should prefer to pay for
  immediate delivery. Let us bring this matter to a point. I will offer you
  five thousand pounds cash for her as she stands or," he added with a smile,
  "I will make it twenty five thousand if the emerald is included!"</p>

  <p>Wildburn shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The emerald, although I cannot believe it is worth that much," he said
  "is not mine to dispose of. It will be returned to its owner as soon as I can
  assure myself of her identity and her whereabouts. As regards your offer am I
  permitted to ask you a question, Monsieur Mermillon? Even rich men do not
  throw money away heedlessly. Why do you offer me so much more than my boat is
  worth?"</p>

  <p>"Why indeed," the Baron echoed with a little gesture of disapproval. "I
  think that my friend has lost his senses."</p>

  <p>"In buying and selling," Mermillon said suavely, "one does not disclose
  even to one's friends one's reasons for wishing to operate. I want this boat
  very badly my dear new friend."</p>

  <p>The American shrugged his shoulders. For some reason or other his attitude
  had become a shade less courteous towards his distinguished visitors.</p>

  <p>"Then let me say at once Monsieur Mermillon, that no cheque which you
  could write would buy my boat." he announced. "I deeply appreciate the honour
  of your visit and I should have been proud and happy if I had been able to
  serve you. In this matter I cannot. After that I think you will agree with me
  that further conversation would be waste of time."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Mermillon appeared to be deep in reflection. In
  the end he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"If you should change your mind within the next few days, Monsieur
  Wildburn," he said disconsolately, "I should be glad to hear from you. Since
  you have refused my offer of five thousand pounds, however, I am quite
  content to believe that you do not wish to sell the boat at all. For the
  present, therefore, we will consider the matter closed."</p>

  <p>The Baron also rose to his feet with apparent alacrity.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you, my friend, Edouard," he exclaimed, patting his
  shoulder. "That was a foolish offer which you made. Monsieur Wildburn sets, I
  think, too high a value upon his possession."</p>

  <p>The two men made their way to the gangway, the American strolling behind.
  The affair of embarkation was only a matter of seconds.</p>

  <p>"I trust," Mermillon said courteously, as he took the wheel of the motor
  boat, "that you will pay us a visit on the <i>Aigle Noir</i> before you leave
  the harbour. We are generally at home at the time of the aperitif."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," the young man promised, as he waved his hand in
  farewell.</p>

  <p>The motor boat shot away, made a circle, and headed for the <i>Aigle
  Noir</i>. Both men remained speechless until they were half way across. Then
  the Baron spoke. His voice was thick and dubious.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"What is it that you do not understand, my friend?" Mermillon asked
  him.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand that young man refusing an offer of five thousand
  pounds for a boat which is obviously worth less than two."</p>

  <p>"Then you show less than your usual astuteness," was the caustic reply.
  "Although it seemed to me to be bad policy to allude to the fact, he told us
  himself that he had received another offer for the boat. The emerald which I
  picked up in his little salon is the property of Louise de Fantany."</p>

  <p>The Baron's face showed signs of fear. His complexion was a most
  unwholesome colour. He dabbed his forehead with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Louise de Fantany." he repeated. "And barely an hour ago we heard that
  Perissol had ordered a 'plane for the south!"</p>

  <p>Mermillon brought the boat with skilful precision to the gangway steps of
  the yacht. He sprang lightly to the deck, and led the way to their favourite
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Deeply as I regret such methods in these civilised days," he sighed, "I
  fear that there is now no alternative. Chicotin must take a hand."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">Lucienne de Montelimar, a dazzlingly attractive young
woman, with her
  yellow-gold hair, her deep brown eyes, and her perfect complexion, only
  beautified by its coat of sunburn, sat upon the topmost of the steps leading
  from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> grounds to the private dock and gazed
  thoughtfully across the bay to where, at about a hundred yards' distance, the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> lay at anchor. In something like thirty seconds after
  her arrival Hamer Wildburn had dived from his boat with a terrific splash and
  was swimming powerfully towards her. She welcomed him with the smile which
  had already turned the heads of half the young men in Paris.</p>

  <p>"You are swimming well this morning," she approved. "I am afraid that if
  we race you will beat me. Nevertheless, we shall try presently."</p>

  <p>"You have some time to spare to-day?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"An incredible amount," she assured him. "My father started early this
  morning to motor over to some forest lands where he hopes later to find
  pheasants. Mother has gone to Cannes, and when she starts doing a tour of the
  dressmakers' shops there is no telling what will become of her. Anyway, I
  know if she is lunching at all that she is lunching with my aunt at La
  Napoule. I am neglected. In a day or two the house will be full. At present
  there is no one of account."</p>

  <p>"If the honest endeavours of one worthy young man can save your feeling
  the chill of loneliness," he promised her, "I am at your disposition."</p>

  <p>She looked at him speculatively.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," she said. "There are some quite agreeable English people
  who proposed themselves for a bathing party, and there is dancing at the
  villa of the people on the hill. Besides, I have so much time on my hands
  that you will probably get tired of me. <i>Enfin,</i> if I let you stay with
  me all the day you will use up that wonderful vocabulary of French!"</p>

  <p>"Try me," he begged. "I read and live and think nothing but French now. I
  am almost prepared to be naturalised Furthermore, if you trust yourself to me
  I will tell you breathless stories&mdash;wildly exciting ones&mdash;of
things which
  have happened to me here within a kilometre of your <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>.
  Monte Cristo isn't in it."</p>

  <p>She sighed, although the twinkle in her eyes was scarcely one of
  melancholy.</p>

  <p>"More women are conquered by curiosity than anything else in the world,"
  she declared. "Very well, I agree. I am dying to swim, even before I listen
  to your adventures."</p>

  <p>She dived from the stone quay. He followed her, and they went off
  together. They hurried towards the open sea, the faint tang of an easterly
  breeze in their faces, the sunshine glorious in her hair and deepening the
  tan upon his naked back, the love of living and of each other in their
  hearts. There was nothing in their conversation, however, to indicate their
  beatific condition. Perhaps at that time they scarcely realised it
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"Look out for the wash from that speed-boat," he advised. "I am coming the
  other side of you."</p>

  <p>"Look down, Hamer," she cried once. "There is a green carpet of leaves at
  the bottom of the sea twenty feet down. Just the colour of my bathing suit,
  too. I should love to go and walk about there."</p>

  <p>"I will buy you a diver's outfit," he promised.</p>

  <p>"It must be a green one," she insisted. "To-morrow you must teach me that
  crawl. I don't do it properly."</p>

  <p>He lay on his back and lazed for a moment. "Lucienne," he asked, "you are
  sure you are real? You have not just stolen up out of those forests
  underneath?"</p>

  <p>"I am so real that I am hungry," she declared. "I suggest that we turn.
  Tell me, whose is the yacht that came in this morning?"</p>

  <p>"It belongs to a very distinguished person&mdash;one of your greatest
  statesmen&mdash;Mermillon."</p>

  <p>She looked across at the boat with interest. "Father knows him quite
  well," she said. "I hope he will come to the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>."</p>

  <p>"I see in the French paper this morning," Hamer remarked, "that he is
  cruising in search of a complete rest. Throw your body out straighter,
  Lucienne. That's marvellous."</p>

  <p>"Let us go a little nearer to the <i>Aigle Noir</i>," she proposed. "I
  should like to see Monsieur Mermillon. They say that he and the President
  between them have saved France during the last crisis."</p>

  <p>"French politics get me all confused," he confessed. "Don't talk too much,
  Lucienne. There is a stiffish current now for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>She made a grimace but she obeyed. Soon they were swimming with their
  faces to the <i>plage</i>, with the dark line of trees and the hidden
  Esterels before them.</p>

  <p>"I think this is the most beautiful spot on the coast," he said
  enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"So do I," she agreed. "What have you for lunch?"</p>

  <p>He reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Plenty of fish, anyway," he confided. "We had a good haul this morning.
  Then, there is a cold chicken I didn't touch yesterday, and heaps of fruit
  and vegetables."</p>

  <p>"Delicious," she murmured, turning on her back for a moment. "Anyway, I
  shan't be able to wait till luncheon time. I'm too hungry. I shall have one
  of your breakfast rolls, if you have not eaten them all, and an early
  cocktail."</p>

  <p>"You are the sort of girl," he declared, "a fellow ought to marry."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you, then?" she asked. "You have all day to try and make me
  fall in love with you."</p>

  <p>"That sounds a trifle old-fashioned but very exciting," he gasped. "Now,
  if you look up, you can see Mermillon, He is very elegant in what looks like
  white linen, but I think it is white tussore or something of that sort. The
  shorter, thick-set man sitting with him is the Baron de Brett."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;the banker?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Banker, speculator, millionaire, and secret hoarder of gold&mdash;all
these
  things and a little more."</p>

  <p>She looked at the two men curiously. De Brett had already called his
  host's attention to the pair and was staring at the girl with unashamed
  admiration. Mermillon, who was reading from a pile of papers, his secretary
  standing by his side, only glanced at them for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"Baron de Brett used to be a friend of mother's," the girl confided. "I do
  not think I like him very much. All the same, I am afraid I am going to be
  faithless to you, Hamer. I adored the way Mermillon looked as though I were a
  performing sea lioness and then went on with his work. He has never looked up
  since, either..."</p>

  <p>Wildburn, who had been swimming under water for a few seconds, came up and
  recovered his breath.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of drowning myself," he told her, "but I have changed my
  mind. I remembered a passage in a modern novel I was reading last night, at
  least, I don't remember the passage, but I remember the sense of it. One chap
  knows all about women and he is giving a younger chap a lesson. 'Indifference
  as a weapon to excite interest in the opposite sex no longer leads to
  success,' he said. 'The latest fashion is all the old stuff over again.
  Shyness, sentiment, moonlight walks, simple nervous love making.'"</p>

  <p>"Commencing with holding hands under the table, I suppose," she
  mocked.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," he concluded, "the fashion at the moment, is the young for the
  young. Girls have left off falling in love with hoary-headed sinners. They
  are not looking any longer for a man with experience. The fashionable passion
  of the moment is for innocence."</p>

  <p>"You must lend me that book," Lucienne gasped, as she clutched at the
  chains of the "<i>Bird of Paradise</i>."</p>

  <p>"It ought to have quite a vogue down in this part of the world."</p>

  <p>They stood together upon the deck for a moment&mdash;a splendid sight in
their
  bathing-suits, upon which and their limbs the seashine was still
  glistening.</p>

  <p>"What you need." he observed thoughtfully, "Is a peignoir."</p>

  <p>"Nice thoughtful boy," she assented. "Do you see a rather
  attractive-looking young woman in black seated on those steps, with a huge
  bathing-bag, gazing anxiously in our direction?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is Annette, my faithful maid, who is there according to
  orders. If you will kindly send your dinghy across for her. I will borrow
  your cabin and change."</p>

  <p>He gave a brief order, and the dinghy shot out.</p>

  <p>"There are two of my breakfast rolls left for you," he told her. "I am now
  going to make the cocktails."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, smiling, "whether you make love to me the new way or the
  old way, I think we are going to have a very happy time."</p>

  <p>They were young and already sufficiently in love to be content with that
  monosyllabic and purely personal exchange of remarks which goes to make the
  conversation of young people in their position. They chattered in the canoe
  which they took out after the early cocktail and rolls, made fun of one
  another's occasional mishaps with the paddles, attempted hair-raising feats
  of racing to the terror of competing craft, then each in turn tried paddling
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Fine exercise," she told him encouragingly, as he struggled against the
  current.</p>

  <p>"I would sooner do deep-breathing exercises on the boat," he groaned.</p>

  <p>They showed one another strange evolutions and contortions on the deck.
  Each performed incredible feats. Each welcomed the call to luncheon when it
  came. It was not until they had finished and were seated in two <i>chaises
  longues</i> in the sunshine that they gave a serious thought to the world
  about them.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me about these strange adventures of yours, Mr. Monte Cristo,"
  she begged. "I am happy and lazy, and perhaps a little sleepy, otherwise I am
  all attention."</p>

  <p>"You may be sleepy but I do not think you will go to sleep," he assured
  her. "How is this picture for a start? A very beautiful woman in full evening
  dress, wearing even her jewels, hanging on to my chains at 3 o'clock this
  morning, with a canoe turned upside down drifting behind her?"</p>

  <p>"You are not in earnest?" the girl exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"Did she come on board?"</p>

  <p>"Of course she did. She came out to pay me a call."</p>

  <p>Lucienne set up in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Go on with that story, please!"</p>

  <p>"She came with a request. I refused it. We drank some coffee together.
  Really I am rather ashamed to admit this, but I was not expecting anything of
  the sort&mdash;she positively and absolutely, in the most melodramatic
fashion,
  drugged me! When I had slept it off in about an hour's time she had turned my
  whole cabin and saloon upside down and disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Of course you dreamt all this," Lucienne declared incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I dreamt nothing," he insisted. "Do you know who she was?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest idea. She didn't leave a card."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to do anything about it? You have sent for the
  gendarmes&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Not likely! For one tiling I don't suppose anyone would believe my story,
  and for another-what's the good? She didn't steal anything that I can
  see."</p>

  <p>"What was the request she made that you refused?"</p>

  <p>"She wanted to buy the boat."</p>

  <p>Lucienne leaned over and took his wrist in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Pulse quite normal," she observed. "There is no exaggeration in what you
  tell me? It is a true story?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"To buy the boat," Lucienne repeated in amazement. "Why didn't she send an
  agent or come in the daytime?"</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you all I know," he assured her. "I will pass on to the next
  adventure when we have finished with this one."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;two in one night?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the second one took place this morning to be exact," he admitted.
  "You know the yacht that came in with Edouard Mermillon and the Baron de
  Brett on board? We saw them while we were swimming."</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about hall-past eight this morning," he continued, "Mermillon
  and the baron arrived here in a dinghy to pay me a call."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear friend, what an honour!" she exclaimed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it was," he agreed. "I had not looked al it from that
  point of view."</p>

  <p>"What did they want?" she asked. "To buy my boat."</p>

  <p>Her brown eyes were suddenly larger than ever. Her eyebrows were raised,
  her forehead wrinkled. She was tantalizingly beautiful, and much too
  engrossed in Wildburn's story to notice that he was holding her hand.</p>

  <p>"What on earth did they want your boat for?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Mermillon wished to make a present of it to his nephew who comes
  of age next week. He offered me about three times what I gave for it."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I refused. I do not want to sell it, anyway. I do not want to move a foot
  or a yard from this place. I dare say if the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> had not
  been up there," he went on, looking through the trees, "and you had not been
  in tile <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, and we were not both fond of
swimming&mdash;well, I
  might have looked at the matter differently. As it is, no one buys my boat.
  No one is going to send me away."</p>

  <p>"That is a great compliment to me," she acknowledged. "It appears
  incredible. You throw away money, which they say is all that you Americans
  think of, just to play in the sunshine here with me."</p>

  <p>"I happen to like being with with you, Lucienne," he pleaded. I happen to
  like the days we spend together here better than anything in the world that
  money could buy."</p>

  <p>"And they tell me," she sighed, "that American men do not know how to make
  love."</p>

  <p>"Making love is not a matter of nationality," he assured her. "You just
  have to feel what you say. That's all."</p>

  <p>I am beginning to be afraid, she whispered. In France we are not quite so
  direct as this."</p>

  <p>"Our way is better," Wildburn declared confidently. We wait until we are
  sure of ourselves and then we speak."</p>

  <p>"Then as I am sure that I should like a cup more coffee and I see that
  there is some may I ask you for it?"</p>

  <p>He prepared it carefully and handed it to her without a word. She took a
  cigarette from the opened box and lit it. When she broke the silence her
  speech was a little uncertain although her voice was soft. There was a note
  almost of pathos in her tone.</p>

  <p>"I have not met many of your country people, Hamer," she said, "but I know
  there is much freedom between all you young people&mdash;men mid girls. Is
this
  the way you talk to your girl friends?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless we happen to mean what we are saying," was his prompt
  assurance.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that you meant what you said to me?"</p>

  <p>"Every bit of it and a great deal more."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand once more upon his. "Keep the rest. Keep it back just a
  little time. We are so happy here."</p>

  <p>"You will still come to swim and pass your time with me?" he begged.</p>

  <p>"So long as I can," she promised. "In a few days time the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> will be filled with guests. That is a different thing.
  Just now let us go on pretending that we are children and play together.
  Soon, very soon perhaps, if you still wish to, we will talk more
  seriously."</p>

  <p>Her fingers were cold upon his firm hard flesh. Although he pretended not
  to notice he could see the rapid rising and falling of her small bosoms.
  Discretion or insight&mdash;some gift of the gods&mdash;guided him. He was
content to
  wait. Furthermore he helped her out of the labyrinth of emotion into which
  they had wandered.</p>

  <p>"Now will you tell me what you think of my twenty-four hours
  adventures?"</p>

  <p>There was a very sweet light in her eyes and he was conscious of her
  gratitude. For several moments she was silent. Her face was hidden behind her
  beautifully shaped, enamelled vanity-case. He looked away towards the distant
  mountains of the Italian frontier and watched the efforts of a small sailing
  yacht to elude the mistral and enter the bay. Presently she closed the case
  with a snap.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Hamer," she asked, Do you carry treasure on board?"</p>

  <p>"Not in a general way," he assured her. I have nothing but a man's
  ordinary jewellery, a few possibly rare books and my wearing apparel."</p>

  <p>"Then what do these people want to buy your boat for?"</p>

  <p>"Can't imagine. But for your visit I should have been thinking of nothing
  else. I tell you frankly, though, I have not the slightest idea There is
  nothing that I can see about her in which she is different from any other
  boat of her class. She was built by Englishmen, which might make her a trifle
  more valuable, but that would scarcely account for this rush of would-be
  purchasers."</p>

  <p>"To whom did she belong before you bought her?"</p>

  <p>"A very pertinent question," he approved. "A Frenchman named Dupont. She
  was built for him specially, and he took the most meticulous interest in
  every one of the smallest details of her construction. He made one trip in
  her, professed himself satisfied, paid for her in cash, planned a cruise for
  the following week, left Marseilles, and disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Disappeared?" she repeated. "Isn't that rather difficult?"</p>

  <p>"He did it anyway. The boat builder discovered that his addresses were
  false, his name was false, and no one knew anything about him in the quarter
  where he was supposed to live. In due course, after the legal formalities had
  been attended to, she came on the market. That's how I bought her."</p>

  <p>"There was a mystery about her from the first, then," Lucienne observed.
  "Did you buy her furniture and fittings and all that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Practically," he assured her. "Of course, I added a few oddments myself.
  I had her painted a different colour, and had the cupboards put in. She is an
  ordinary schooner yacht, just under thirty tons, soundly and strongly built,
  but not a loophole of mystery anywhere about her construction."</p>

  <p>"And yet," Lucienne murmured, "you have had one wild woman attack you at
  three o'clock in the morning, France's premier statesman, and one of the
  world's greatest financiers&mdash;all offering you two to three times as
much as
  she is worth. Hamer, if I were you I would sell her and get out of it."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," he promised. "I will sell her to the first
  person who tells me the truth as to why they want to buy her,"</p>

  <p>Lucienne rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful idea," she approved. "Except, if I were you, I would not sell
  her to that little man in the dinghy below. He has been round twice while we
  have been talking, and I don't like the look of him."</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn leaned over by her side. Below them a pale faced, dark eyed
  man with a mass of black hair unshaded from the sun, dressed in violently red
  trousers and blue shirt open at the neck came drifting by in a small row
  boat. He looked up at Wildburn and attempted some form of salute.</p>

  <p>"A beautiful leetle boat," he called out. "I like to see
over&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>Wildburn shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he refused. "She is not on exhibition."</p>

  <p>"Pardon, Monsieur," the man remarked, rowing, however, nearer to the steps
  as though he failed to understand.</p>

  <p>Wildburn addressed him rapidly in French. "No one is allowed on board," he
  said, "so get away from there, please."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps afterwards," the little man begged. "Monsieur will understand
  that I am interested in ships of this class. I know all about engines. I
  could perhaps suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My boat pleases me as it is," Wildburn interrupted. "Let it be
  understood, my friend, that neither you nor any other casual visitors are
  going to set foot on board. Off you go."</p>

  <p>The man made a sulky withdrawal. Wildburn and the girl exchanged
  glances.</p>

  <p>"I think you were quite right," the latter approved. "I have never seen
  that man before, but he is detestable. If there was any thing evil to be done
  upon your boat he would be the man to do it."</p>

  <p>"He won't have the chance." Wildburn assured her confidently.</p>

  <p>A small boat from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> landing stage came alongside,
  and Lucienne's maid extended her hands regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Mais Mademoiselle," she announced, "you are urgently needed at the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. Madame la Duchesse has telephoned from Cap d'Ail. The
  Comtesse de Lirigny has arrived with two friends, and they are walking in the
  grounds. Madame has telephoned to beg that you will entertain any visitors
  until she returns. There was the yacht of the Marquis de St. Pierre in the
  harbour, and someone landing as I left. I thought it best to warn
  Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Annette," her young mistress agreed. "<i>Au revoir</i>, my
  dear host," she added, clasping her two hands for a moment over his. "If our
  evening swim does not arrive, still there is to-morrow. I think you have let
  loose within me a spirit of mischief amongst other things. I shall swim out
  before the telephone or callers have become a nuisance, and stay until I am
  fetched. That will please you&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"It will make me very happy," he assured her.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">Royalty was giving a dinner party at the rendezvous which
on that superb
  night seemed to be the centre of the universe&mdash;the Summer Casino at Monte
  Carlo. Royalty was giving it because the invitation said so, but a humbler
  admirer of court life was providing the cheque. Curtsies had been duly made
  and introductions effected. His Majesty was talking to the reigning favourite
  amongst his lady friends. His Foreign Minister was engaged in earnest
  conversation with Monster Edouard Mermillon, the famous French statesman The
  member of the suite who was acting as master of ceremonies, and was carrying
  about a list in his hand, made urgent approach.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Mermillon," he begged the lady whom you are to have the honour
  of conducting in to dinner is close by. You will permit me this opportunity
  of presenting you?</p>

  <p>Mermillon, with a friendly little nod, ended his conversation and turned
  away. He was almost immediately face to face with a woman who, for looks, was
  certainly the star of the evening. She was standing momentarily alone, having
  detached herself from a little crowd of acquaintances as the master of
  ceremonies made his approach.</p>

  <p>"Madame la Princesse," the latter said, "you permit me to present to you
  your neighbour at this evenings ceremony&mdash;Monsieur Mermillon&mdash;whom
you tell
  me that you have never met but whom you know, of course, by reputation.
  Monsieur Edouard Mermillon&mdash;la Princesse de Fantany."</p>

  <p>Mermillon bowed low over her fingers and raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Chance has hitherto been unkind to me," he said. "I am forced to live a
  somewhat enclosed life, but I know very well that there is no Parisian who
  would not esteem the honour I receive to-night."</p>

  <p>The master of ceremonies faded away. The Princes murmured a polite
  acknowledgment of her companions words.</p>

  <p>"It is a great pleasure, Princess," the latter continued, "to find you in
  these parts. It is a great pleasure, too, to think that I bring you good
  news."</p>

  <p>"How is that possible, Monsieur?" she asked. "It sounds intriguing. Do
  explain."</p>

  <p>"It was my great good fortune," he confided, "to discover in a remote
  corner of a small pleasure yacht, only a few hours ago, one of those jewels
  which Madame wears with such distinction."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. The eyes whose colour no one had been able to
  determine absolutely, which seemed sometimes the softest of grey, and
  sometimes the palest blue, for the moment lost their lustre. She looked at
  him stonily.</p>

  <p>"Jewels of mine," she repeated, "in a small yacht here? Ah, Monsieur, you
  are mistaken&mdash;or have I perhaps a thieving maid?"</p>

  <p>"I might believe myself mistaken," he answered, but for the fact that the
  jewels were purchased on your behalf, I was told, at Christie's one
  disappointing day, and I was one of those who were left behind in the
  bidding. It was the famous Marie Antoinette necklace composed of entirely
  flawless emeralds."</p>

  <p>"It is true that I own that treasure," the Princess replied, "but you will
  observe that I am wearing it this evening."</p>

  <p>He bowed. There was a faintly amusing smile upon his lips. Mermillon was
  far too clever a man to have been a mere Cabinet Minister.</p>

  <p>"You are wearing it indeed, Princess," he assented. "But the pendant
  emerald&mdash;the joy of the whole collection&mdash;is missing."</p>

  <p>"You are going to be like one of the magicians of old and produce it from
  your waistcoat pocket?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Alas, I cannot do that," he regretted. "I, with all my family, have been
  cursed with the inconvenient gilt of honesty. I restored it to the owner of
  the boat. Pardon me if I point out that my excited friend, the good
  administrator of the feast, has given the signal. It follows that we should
  join the procession."</p>

  <p>The woman swept her gown into place and laid her fingers upon his arm.
  They passed through an admiring vortex of spectators to their chairs. They
  sat with the stars and the blue dome of the cloudless sky above them and the
  sea, motionless since the dying away of the evening breeze, stretching away
  before them. The tables were plenteously and elaborately decorated with the
  flowers of the day. From the moment of taking her place she seemed to have
  fully recovered her composure. She became once more the unafraid beauty whom
  all Parisians adored.</p>

  <p>"To leave for a moment, Monsieur, the subject of my possible indiscretion,
  which I can assure you was nothing of the sort," she said, "I find it strange
  to meet you in this somewhat unfamiliar entourage. In Paris for the last
  twelve months, I have scarcely been to a reception for dinner where your name
  has not been the engrossing topic. Yet we have never met."</p>

  <p>I make no pretence, Madame, of taking part in any form of social life
  while I am in harness."</p>

  <p>"I can well understand that," she said sympathetically. "Men who take the
  burdens of a struggling country upon their shoulders can find little time for
  the distractions of Paris."</p>

  <p>She was addressed by the neighbour on her left. For a few minutes she
  talked to him lightly of a recent meeting, a dinner party at the
  Armenonville. The exigencies of the situation having been complied with, she
  turned once more to Mermillon.</p>

  <p>"You are passing your vacation in this neighbourhood?" she asked,</p>

  <p>"So far as one can call it a vacation," he replied. "I am on my yacht in
  company with a great financier, who tries night and day to convert me to his
  own ideas as to the gold standard, and I receive portfolios from Paris twice
  a day. The true vacation which rested the minds and souls of men came to an
  end with the telegraph, telephone, and wireless. These are the tentacles
  thrown out to keep us slaves for ever."</p>

  <p>"Science takes a hand, too, on the other side," she reminded him. "She can
  transport you now with incredible speed from the scene of your labours."</p>

  <p>He shook his head gently.</p>

  <p>"The scene of our labours is wherever we happen to be," he told her.</p>

  <p>"I find that a little enigmatic," she complained.</p>

  <p>"Who speaks in plain words nowadays?" he rejoined. "The age of being
  natural is past. We are all playing some game or other, and we must veil our
  words, conceal our thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Surely, the great Monsieur Mermillon is not obliged to play a part," she
  laughed mockingly. "The emperors of the world are supposed, are they not, to
  be monuments of truth?"</p>

  <p>"The only one whom I have met," he replied lightly, "was a shocking
  liar."</p>

  <p>"The fault was probably not with him," she ventured. "It was in the soil
  of his country."</p>

  <p>Mermillon glanced round the table. "By-the-bye," he remarked, "I am
  somewhat disappointed to-night."</p>

  <p>"I am not flattered."</p>

  <p>"Madame requires no reassurance from me in that respect," he smiled. "I
  was thinking of my old friend, General Perissol. I thought that he might have
  been here."</p>

  <p>"You have given him too much work to do," she said.</p>

  <p>"His activities are at least distributed," Mermillon reminded her. "He has
  a bureau in every great city of France."</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary for him to visit them individually?" she asked. "It seems
  to me that one reads reports signed by him issued from Paris most days."</p>

  <p>"I have heard," he confided, "that sometimes those reports are issued with
  the sole purpose of confusing the world as to his actual whereabouts. <i>Par
  exemple</i>, this morning there is issued a decree from him dated from Paris
  dealing with the activities of the Communists in Marseilles, yet Perissol is
  not in Paris. He is very much nearer to us than that."</p>

  <p>"You speak," she observed, "as though the movements of General Perissol
  were my chief interest in life."</p>

  <p>"Are they not?" he inquired, with purposeful daring.</p>

  <p>She continued her dinner as though she had not heard his question. He took
  the opportunity to address a few remarks to his neighbour on the other
  side&mdash;a very distinguished personage who had been eagerly awaiting his
  attentions. At their close he was aware of a change in the Princess's
  attitude towards him. Her beautiful shoulder was turned an inch or two away.
  She was talking to a friend across the table. It was some time before she
  even gave him the opportunity of addressing her again. When he did so his
  tone was as courteous as ever, but she realised that his thrust had been an
  intentional one. There was a suggestion that the buttons had been removed
  from the foils.</p>

  <p>"If my questions gave offence, Princess," he said, "I am sorry. As I dare
  say you know, I am responsible for the department which General Perissol
  administers so excellently, and it is permitted to me to have sometimes a
  slight curiosity as to his movements. I have, of course, the means for
  satisfying myself as to these matters, but I thought perhaps I might have
  learnt from you without effort whether our friend had arrived in these
  parts."</p>

  <p>"<i>Cher</i> Monsieur Mermillon," she protested with a faint gesture of
  reproach, "you credit me with too intimate a knowledge of the General's
  movements. He is, without doubt, a friend of mine, but I have never even
  heard of him in these parts. Why should he come here?"</p>

  <p>"Why, indeed?" Mermillon agreed sympathetically. "It is without doubt as
  you say&mdash;one has never heard of him here. Yet one has heard of a Monsieur
  Benoit who lives in great seclusion in a villa amongst the pines, on the
  lighthouse hill, at Garoupe."</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at him. His face was inscrutable. He seemed to be
  studying the contents of his wineglass. When he returned her glance, he knew,
  however, that the risk he had taken had been worth while.</p>

  <p>"Do you," she asked, "keep a private army of spies?"</p>

  <p>"One must make oneself secure," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You do not trust General Perissol&mdash;the greatest patriot France ever
  had?"</p>

  <p>He considered his reply for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I would trust to his patriotism," he conceded, "but the time might come
  when I found his judgment at fault. In my position, I cannot afford to be
  dependent on any one department of the administration or any one man. I have
  known men betray their country, not from any lack of patriotism, but from
  lack of judgment."</p>

  <p>"I see," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Furthermore," he went on, "it is to be acknowledged that, at the present
  moment, our friend, notwithstanding his many brilliant gifts, is confronted
  with a nervous depression which many months of failure have induced."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that he has failed?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Louise de Fantany was haunted for months afterwards by that sudden swift
  turn of the head, the light momentarily flashing in the eyes of the man by
  her side. She felt suddenly helpless as though, indeed, he was seeing through
  all that was at the back of her mind.</p>

  <p>"If he has not failed," Mermillon replied, "he has committed a graver
  fault still. He has neglected to confide the news of his success, partial or
  complete, to the administration from which he holds his post."</p>

  <p>"He may have had his reasons for that," she ventured.</p>

  <p>"Alas, none of them would hold water. Our friend is the servant of his
  state. A servant who withholds the confidence of his doings from his
  employers places himself in a somewhat dangerous position..."</p>

  <p>Permission to dance had been given to the members of the party. The
  minister leaned towards his neighbour.</p>

  <p>"There is perhaps one last word," he said, "which could be more safely
  spoken in the seclusion of a crowd. Will you honour me, Princess?"</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet with a mechanical word of gracious assent. It was
  some few minutes after their leisurely progress had started that they found
  themselves at last amidst a crowd of completely unfamiliar people. The moment
  came, however.</p>

  <p>"You do not suspect General Perissol of disloyalty?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Towards his country or towards his chief?"</p>

  <p>"Towards either."</p>

  <p>"It is my opinion," he said, "that the people who put him into office and
  who are responsible to France for their action are the only ones whom he
  should consider."</p>

  <p>"I see," she murmured. "The plain truth is that you have mistrusted
  Perissol, you have had him spied upon and you have made this discovery. Well,
  I will tell you something even at the risk of my own reputation. His
  possession of a secret identity and his possession of the villa on the
  lighthouse hill have nothing to do with his work for France or with any form
  of political intrigue or enterprise."</p>

  <p>"<i>Nid d'amour</i>?" he whispered. "Precisely."</p>

  <p>"And you happen to know that?"</p>

  <p>"I am the person concerned."</p>

  <p>Mermillon sighed ruefully. There was no evidence that he found the news
  specially important, yet both were perhaps aware of a certain change in the
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"The man who has had such happiness granted to him," Mermillon observed,
  "can scarcely be censured if he does not hesitate to accept it. At the same
  time Paris and Antibes are a long way apart."</p>

  <p>"His coming here is not an everyday affair. Besides, there is
  Marseilles."</p>

  <p>"Marseilles is an important centre," the minister admitted..."I wonder if
  by chance the General is anywhere in the neighbourhood now."</p>

  <p>"I have told you a good deal," she said. "To disclose his movements would
  be an impossibility. You are in a position to ascertain them for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"A matter of time only," Mermillon confessed. "We had better, perhaps,
  with your permission, return, Princess. My dancing can scarcely compare with
  the efforts of some of these younger men."</p>

  <p>"Which is to say," she laughed, "that having succeeded in wringing my
  secret from me you want to got away as quickly as possible."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he assured her. "Nothing would give me greater pleasure than
  to spend the rest of the evening <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. There
  are still many things I should like to ask."</p>

  <p>"There is one, Monsieur," she said, fingering for a moment the vacant
  place in her necklace, "which I hope as a man of honour and gallantry you
  will forget."</p>

  <p>Mermillon was smiling to himself somewhat cryptically as he took leave of
  his companion, and, having made his excuses to his host, left a few minutes
  later. There was a murmur of interest amongst the other guests as he
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"The most brilliant politician France has had for years," a famous banker
  declared.</p>

  <p>"Almost the only one who has come through all these terrible scandals
  scatheless," someone else remarked.</p>

  <p>"Scatheless personally, but they may yet prove his ruin," a woman of great
  consequence observed. "There is calm just now, but the people of France will
  never forgive if they are kept in ignorance as to what has become of all
  those other missing millions. They will always have the idea that they have
  been swindled."</p>

  <p>The signal to leave came at last, and a somewhat turgid babble of small
  talk came to an end. Everyone hoped that they would catch another glimpse of
  the great French statesman in the Sporting Club. Edouard Mermillon, however,
  was no gambler with <i>jetons</i>.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Rumours of an unlimited baccarat bank presided over by the
fabulously
  wealthy Belgian banker, Baron de Brett, filled the Sporting Club that
  evening. With rolls of notes in front of him and stacks of the famous hundred
  thousand franc plaques, making the small space immediately around him at the
  end of the table look rather like a remote comer of Aladdin's cave, the Baron
  himself&mdash;bland unruffled, with a large cigar in his mouth and a gleam of
  pleasure in his eyes&mdash;won and lost millions on the turn of a card.
There were
  many very distinguished people amongst the crowd, but the great French
  statesman, of whom everyone had hoped to catch a glimpse, and who had been a
  guest at the Royal dinner party, was absent, as was also another visitor to
  the rooms, who was always a great attraction, the Princess de Fantany.</p>

  <p>"Most disappointing," an English Cabinet Minister complained to his host.
  "I don't care a fig about this spectacular gambling&mdash;it may be a put-up
job
  for all anyone knows&mdash;but if there was one man in this world with whom I
  wished for five minutes' conversation before I leave for Italy to-morrow it
  was Edouard Mermillon."</p>

  <p>His host for the evening&mdash;a well-known American resident of the
place, who
  had long ago shaken himself free from the trammels of international finance
  and politics&mdash;expressed his polite regrets.</p>

  <p>"Mermillon very seldom comes this way," he confided, "and when he does he
  is almost as difficult to get hold of as royalty itself. I know for certain
  that he left directly after dinner. His hat and coat are gone, and the
  concierge called his car."</p>

  <p>The Englishman sighed.</p>

  <p>"A private word with him might have been immensely useful," he grumbled.
  "You do not interest yourself in our troubles nowadays, Mason, but I can tell
  you that they are real enough."</p>

  <p>"I have had plenty of worry in my time," the American replied. "My stuff
  now is invested where neither the mice nor the tigers can get at it, and I've
  quit worrying."</p>

  <p>"It is not altogether a matter of finance," the Englishman remarked.</p>

  <p>"I had a kind of idea," Mr. Seth Mason observed, rolling round his cigar
  between his fingers, "that affairs in France were looking pretty good these
  days. She is the quaintest country on the face of the map. She has done
  everything in the most illogical fashion, she ought to be in trouble in half
  a dozen different quarters, and she isn't. It has all panned out right for
  her, somehow. A good many people say that it is mostly due to this chap you
  wanted to get hold of&mdash;Mermillon."</p>

  <p>"He is the man with the brains," the Englishman admitted. "In my opinion,
  if he had the chance, he could be a greater man and a greater figure in
  Europe than any of these opportunist dictators."</p>

  <p>"The only question about him in my mind," the American put in, "is whether
  he is dead square."</p>

  <p>"What makes you suspect him?" the other asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt that he is the man who saved France from revolution
  after those governmental scandals. It was just dawning upon the people that
  the Tositi affair was nothing but a pimple on a huge body of corruption. They
  were just beginning to seethe with fury, to demand something more than these
  sham investigations, when Mermillon takes the matter into his hands. There is
  no doubt that with his eloquence and his cleverness he has calmed things down
  for the moment. The other fellows were all for putting taxes on to make up
  the deficiency. He took 'em off. If you want to put a Frenchman in a good
  humour you take off a tax in which he is interested. Some day or other,
  however, one or two pretty awkward questions will have to be answered,
  especially if an honest budget is presented. When that time comes Mermillon
  will have to declare himself."</p>

  <p>The Englishman rose gloomily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I would be quite content to let the future look after itself if I could
  have had that five minutes' talk with Edouard Mermillon tonight," he
  declared. "See you later, Mason, I'm going to watch the baccarat and get a
  word with de Brett if I can. He is a great friend of Mermillon's and if he's
  coming back he would be sure to know."</p>

  <p>The French Minister was not the only one who had hurried away from the
  Royal dinner party. Mermillon's car had scarcely reached Villefranche when
  the famous car of the Princess de Fantany flashed past him. It was not for
  nothing that she had earned her reputation as a lover of speed. She possessed
  the fastest motor boat upon the coast, and the car into which she stepped on
  leaving the Sporting Club climbed the lighthouse hill at Antibes in something
  like 40 minutes after her departure. The iron gate before which it paused was
  opened by one of its three guardians, who appeared from some mysterious
  obscurity, without question. The car climbed the steep unlit avenue and drew
  up in front of what seemed like a deserted villa. A single touch of the bell,
  however, and the door was thrown open. Lights flashed out in every direction,
  and several shadowy figures approached towards Louise from the background. A
  young man hurried out to meet her.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le General is on the terrace, Princess."</p>

  <p>She passed across the hall and out through a side door, which the young
  man had opened for her, with the air of an <i>habitue</i>, and was received
  almost at once by another of the famous men of the day. He strode across the
  terrace to greet her from the small table at which he had been working with
  his secretary&mdash;a tall, brown-bearded man of powerful physique and quick,
  impulsive movements. He had the frame of a Hercules, and the iron jaw of a
  man of deeds, but his voice was unexpectedly gentle and restrained. The fixed
  eyeglass in his left eye somehow softened his expression.</p>

  <p>"Louise, my dear friend," he exclaimed as he took her into his arms. "This
  is indeed a beautiful surprise. I had no idea you would have been able to get
  away from the party so early."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing more I could do there," she confided, sinking into the
  chair to which he led her. "Besides, I have news for you."</p>

  <p>He waved his secretary away. They were alone in the shadow of the pine
  trees.</p>

  <p>"Something which happened at the dinner?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you," she begged. "I was placed next to Edouard Mermillon.
  Lily arranged that for me, it was quite easy. You were right, of course, in
  all your information. He and de Brett are both on board the '<i>Aigle
  Noir</i>.' But there is something else."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Events are moving quickly. They have only just arrived, but he has
  already been on board the '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>.' He has tried to buy
  it&mdash;he offered even an absurd price. This young man, Hamer Wildburn,
who owns
  the boat must know."</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu! But how did you arrive at this information?"</p>

  <p>"From Lily Montelimar. She, too, was dining. Lucienne, her daughter, has
  made friends with Hamer Wildburn, the young man who owns the boat. She told
  her mother of my foolish little enterprise and of their visit. Fortunately
  the young man doesn't know me by sight."</p>

  <p>"Wildburn's dossier is harmless enough," General Perissol reflected.</p>

  <p>"There is more to tell you, Armand. I fear that it means complications. He
  knows of your presence here."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"For your sake beloved," she went on, "I have sacrificed my reputation. He
  believes that you come here secretly to be near me&mdash;as indeed you did
before
  this thing happened. It is so, is it not, Armand?"</p>

  <p>"For no other reason," he assured her. "It seems to me then that no great
  harm is done."</p>

  <p>She clung to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Alas, there is worse to be told," she went on anxiously. "You must not be
  angry, my lover. It was all the result of that foolish hope of mine that I
  might be of use to you. He knows that I, too, have visited the '<i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>.'"</p>

  <p>"That is without doubt awkward," ha admitted.</p>

  <p>"You remember the Marie Antoinette necklace that I bought in London?" she
  continued. "He also was at the sale. As a matter of fact he was bidding
  against me. I am wearing it&mdash;as you see. He recognised it and he saw
that the
  pendant was missing. I dropped that pendant on the '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>.'
  He saw it there."</p>

  <p>Perissol's expression was for a moment grim. He remained silent,
  however.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she went on, clinging to his arm, "I was so ashamed of my
  ridiculous failure&mdash;the attempt, I think, came from reading these foolish
  English detective stories, in which the woman always seems to be able to do
  anything&mdash;that I never made any inquiries even about my emerald. I was
  willing to consider it lost, although it is invaluable, if the young man
  didn't find out to whom it belonged and return it. But there you are. He saw
  it, and he knows of my visit. You are not angry, Armand?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," he answered fondly. "What you don't realise, my dear Louise, is
  this. You bring more valuable information than you have given away. Edouard
  Mermillon should never have let you know of his visit to that young man. It
  is the first mistake I have ever detected in him. You tell me that he has
  actually been on board the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I know it for a fact," she replied. "Not only that, but I know that he
  tried to buy the boat. That, of course, he would not have told me, but he
  knows nothing about the girl and her friendship with the young man. Two boats
  in the same harbour&mdash;it was nothing that he should have paid a visit.
It is
  just chance that I found out the real object of the visit."</p>

  <p>"After all," he assured her with a smile, "you have been much cleverer
  than you had any idea of. Lily Montelimar is your cousin, isn't she? The
  young man is, of course, a friend of the family. Your visit to him might
  easily be explained. Louise, I thank you. With the whole of my staff, who can
  be trusted watching, you are the first one who has brought me anything
  definite."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little forward, and she gave him what his eyes demanded. He
  held her tightly in his arms for several minutes, then he released her, sat
  back in his chair and tapped thoughtfully upon the table.</p>

  <p>"The owner of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, this young man, Hamer Wildburn,
  refused to sell," he reflected. "What, then, will be Mermillon's next step?
  It must be something rapid beyond a doubt, something he must have already
  decided upon when he was so naive with you."</p>

  <p>He looked away into the darkness for a few moments, then he rose suddenly
  to his feet. It was as though he had received some disturbing inspiration. He
  called for his secretary, who appeared almost at once.</p>

  <p>"Raymond," he inquired, "can you tell me who is the Admiral in charge at
  Toulon?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Bien s&ucirc;r</i>, Monsieur. He is Admiral Montreux, and his flagship
  is the <i>Revanche</i>."</p>

  <p>"The private line is in order?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt, sir."</p>

  <p>"An all night service, of course?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Parfaitement, mon General</i>."</p>

  <p>"Get through to the Admiral. An official message of importance. I will
  speak myself."</p>

  <p>The young man faded away.</p>

  <p>"You are in no hurry, Louise?" Perissol asked, resuming his seat.</p>

  <p>"Am I ever in a hurry when I come to see you?" she protested, with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>"You spoil me," he answered tenderly. "But then you know how much your
  presence soothes me, how I love having you here."</p>

  <p>He touched a bell. A <i>ma&icirc;tre d'hotel</i> appeared a moment or so
  later.</p>

  <p>"Jean," his master announced, "I said no dinner, but I will eat
  something&mdash;cold things. Don't forget my favourite cheese, some fruit and
  wine&mdash;you know the champagne Madame la Princesse prefers. Serve out
here on
  this table. In the meantime an aperitif. You serve for two, of course."</p>

  <p>"But, mon ami," Louise laughed as the man hurried away, "you forget that I
  have been to a Royal dinner party."</p>

  <p>"I know those feasts," he answered. "Besides, if you were talking to our
  friend, what time had you to eat. I myself should not have dined, which,
  after all, is a bad thing. Gastronomically speaking, your arrival is a
  miracle for me, and your news a tonic. We shall hear a champagne cork pop
  under these trees."</p>

  <p>She looked around.</p>

  <p>"You are well taken care of here?" she asked. "I have twenty night
  watchmen about the place and ten day ones," he assured her, "I know there are
  men who desire my life, and with very good reason. For my country's sake I do
  not take risks."</p>

  <p>Aperitifs were served whilst a couple of servants were making rapid
  preparations at the table. Perissol moved his chair closer to his guest's and
  held her hand. They raised their glasses to one another.</p>

  <p>"Great news," he repeated. "All may now go well. Mermillon would never
  have taken the risk of trying to buy the boat himself if he had not been
  completely confident. It was a mistake. When a man makes his first mistake it
  leads easily to others."</p>

  <p>She raised her glass once more.</p>

  <p>"I drink to the hope," she said, "that the day of her deliverance is
  approaching for our beloved France."</p>

  <p>They set down their glasses empty. The first course of the supper which
  had been ordered appeared in an incredibly short space of time. As they took
  their seats the buzzer of the telephone which Raymond had placed upon the
  table was agitated. Perissol lifted up the receiver. The servant faded
  away.</p>

  <p>"I speak with the battleship <i>Revanche</i>?" he asked. "The Admiral is
  on board?...Never mind if he is in bed or tired. This is a matter of public
  service. It is General Perissol speaking."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Perissol covered the transmitter with his hand and
  spoke to his guest.</p>

  <p>"It is a happy augury," he declared. "The first step in our enterprise
  meets with success. Delay might have been fatal. The Admiral is on
  board."</p>

  <p>He replaced the receiver once more to his ear.</p>

  <p>"<i>Allo, allo</i>! It is Admiral Montreux with whom I speak?...Good. I am
  Perissol&mdash;General Perissol. Listen, my confrere, listen!...Yes, I know
that
  it is extraordinary, but the times are extraordinary...I assure you that I am
  General Perissol, Chef de la Surete Nationale, exercising the privileges of
  my new post. I can give you, if you wish, the code number of the naval branch
  of the Intelligence Department. Ah, you recognise my voice now. That is good.
  Listen, Admiral! I am a suppliant. If you telephoned me in distress and asked
  me for the sake of La Patrie to send you ten thousand policemen it would be
  done. I ask you for the loan of any one of your smallest armed craft, one
  that draws no more than ten metres, if possible, and armed&mdash;as lightly
as you
  will, but armed&mdash;and with searchlights fitted...Garoupe&mdash;yes.
Garoupe
  Bay&mdash;<i>pr&egrave;s d'Antibes</i>...A thousand thanks, Admiral. Good
things
  may come to both of us out of this, harm can come to neither...Good. A motor
  boat will be waiting outside the bay, and again a thousand thanks, dear
  Admiral...<i>Termine</i>."</p>

  <p>Perissol laid down the receiver, tapped on the table, and the servants
  reappeared. The service of the meal was soon in progress.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I remain bewildered," Louise observed.</p>

  <p>Her host pointed through a narrow opening in the pine woods from which it
  was possible to obtain a view of the bay.</p>

  <p>"Mermillon is not a man to be baulked," he said. "For reasons we know of
  he wants that ship. For reasons which we do not know of, but which are almost
  as curious, the owner declines to sell it even at what must be an enormous
  profit. Common sense suggests the rest. You follow me?"</p>

  <p>"My intelligence so far has been equal to the effort," Louise assured
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mermillon is following the tactics of one of the world's conquerors. It
  was Caesar, I think, who said: 'What I cannot possess I destroy.' The <i>Bird
  of Paradise</i> is too interesting a yacht for us to stand by and see her
  destroyed, hence I seek protection for her."</p>

  <p>"Why not seize her boldly in the name of the Government?" Louise
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Remember, as yet I know nothing," Perissol reminded her. "Edouard
  Mermillon is in far too strong a position for me to risk a stroke of that
  sort. At the present moment I suspect that he knows more than I do. Soon it
  may be the other way round, then I can assure you that I shall not
  hesitate."</p>

  <p>Louise meditated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Will the lion," she asked, with a faint smile at the corners of her Ups,
  "take advice from the mouse?"</p>

  <p>"Accepting your simile." he replied promptly, "try me."</p>

  <p>"Mermillon knows that you are here. Why not make the first move yourself?
  After all, what is more natural than that you should pay a visit of ceremony
  or friendship, whichever you like to call it, upon a fellow Cabinet
  Minister?"</p>

  <p>Perissol reflected for a moment, then he tool, her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"The mouse has spoken," he said. "I will pay that visit to-morrow
  morning."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Mermillon himself received his unexpected caller at the
head of the
  gangway. He had just emerged from the sea and the sting of the salt water had
  brought a faint glow into the ivory pallor of his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"An unexpected pleasure, this, General," he exclaimed, "until last night I
  had no idea that you were a visitor in these parts."</p>

  <p>Perissol smiled, accepted a cigarette and a chair.</p>

  <p>"You are just from the sea," he pointed out. "Please change your wet
  things. I shall remain here with great comfort."</p>

  <p>"I shall enjoy better a cigarette and a cup of coffee if I remain as I
  am," Mermillon assured his visitor. "When the sun shines I have adopted the
  custom of using it instead of a towel. Besides, you are just from Paris,
  beyond a doubt. I am curious for your news."</p>

  <p>"I have no news," the General confessed. "Events in Paris are calm, for a
  wonder. Both my chief subordinates are there. I ventured myself to take a few
  days."</p>

  <p>Mermillon patted his companion on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," he declared, "no one deserves it more. No one is a
  better judge of when Paris may safely be left. Is it my fancy or did I not
  hear that you had a charming chalet in these parts?"</p>

  <p>"It is an old villa, well enclosed, almost a hiding-place, up on the
  lighthouse hill," Perissol replied. "It suits me for my brief vacations. I
  require a measure of solitude. You and I have both very full official lives,
  if I may venture to compare my occupation to yours. Sometimes it is necessary
  to get away from the voices."</p>

  <p>Mermillon sipped his coffee thoughtfully. He buttered himself a roll with
  great deliberation.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you, my dear colleague," he assented. "Sometimes it happens,
  however, that one finds oneself, as they say in England&mdash;'combining
business
  with pleasure.'"</p>

  <p>Perissol moved no muscle of his face. There was a light of mild inquiry in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The boat yonder, for instance&mdash;" Perissol nodded indifferently.</p>

  <p>"We did hear rumours that she had been in the hands of suspected people,"
  he admitted. "Exaggerated rumours, I fancy."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you have interested yourself in her, then?" Mermillon asked,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"To some small extent," Perissol admitted. "We had the opportunity of
  examining her as she lay in Toulon harbour. We made use of the Naval Secrets
  Bill and examined her all over. There was nothing. She was ownerless then, or
  her owner was away, I forget which, so we were able to go about our task
  without interruption. When I return to Paris I can, if it interests you, send
  you the papers."</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Minister shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have enough business of my own to attend to," he observed a little
  ruefully, "without interfering in your department. She belongs to an
  Englishman now, they tell me."</p>

  <p>"Englishman or American," Perissol replied, "I forget which."</p>

  <p>"A very pig-headed fellow," Mermillon declared. "Apart from those faint
  rumours which your investigations seem to have squashed, I would have bought
  the boat for my lad. I offered the owner quite a decent price, but he would
  have nothing to say to me. The personal characteristics of these Anglo-Saxons
  are exactly on a par with their national tendencies. They have always made
  life very difficult for politicians who take a broader outlook."</p>

  <p>"I feel that I can never be sufficiently thankful," Perissol reflected,
  "for the fact that I understand nothing about international politics. I think
  that if I were able to look out upon the world to-day with the inner
  knowledge that a trained politician, such as yourself, must have I should go
  crazy. It is certain that I should never be able to continue my work."</p>

  <p>"I appreciate your point of view," Mermillon meditated, "but there must be
  times, General, when you are forced to come into touch, and very close touch,
  too, with internal politics."</p>

  <p>Perissol shook his head. He had accepted a cigarette after his coffee, and
  was leaning back in his chair smoking with an air of calm enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"It is my business," he said, "to keep down crime. That is
  sufficient."</p>

  <p>"When I first entered the Chamber," Mermillon confided, "a young man, full
  of ambition, and with a very single purpose, I might have agreed with you.
  To-day-well, there is still the shadow of that ghastly case which no
  patriotic Frenchman mentions but which we all remember. That and the man's
  sudden death afterwards. There was crime there, and there has been an
  aftermath of crime; but, alas, we all know that there was also politics."</p>

  <p>"That case was not typical," Perissol pointed out. "There has never been
  another like it. All France is hoping that there never will be again."</p>

  <p>"And with good reason," Mermillon declared fervently.</p>

  <p>"Believe me. General, you are well off to be at the head of a great
  service which is' not directly concerned with politics. There are men whom we
  meet day by day in Paris, men who are loved and men who are hated, who, at
  the back of our minds, we know have to bear the burden of almost intolerable
  secrets. They have to bear that burden for the sake of La Patrie. Believe me,
  the embers of that flaming bonfire of filth are still alight."</p>

  <p>"This sounds like drama," Perissol muttered, "out of place amongst such
  serenity as this&mdash;this strengthening sunshine and the whispering
wind."</p>

  <p>"It is drama." Mermillon insisted, "drama walking in a guise it has never
  assumed before, but very terrible drama. I think that there is no one else in
  the world to whom I would say this, Perissol, but even to-day a blunderer, by
  a single ill-advised action, if chance gave him the opportunity, might bring
  about the ruin of the country we both love so much.</p>

  <p>"Yon go beyond me," Perissol confessed. "I will give you an analogy,"
  Mermillon suggested, gazing across the bay and watching a figure upon the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. "There are many explorers and philosophers who will
  tell you that the class of people who have done more harm in the world than
  any other have done it through being over zealous to do good. So, in the case
  to-day of our beloved Mother country, she is in danger only when people,
  whilst working with the honest belief that their end and aim is for her good,
  might bring about a great catastrophe. Such people are cursed with narrow
  vision."</p>

  <p>"Except," General Perissol acknowledged, "that I believe I understand
  something of the dynamics of crime, a great deal concerning its distribution,
  and have theories of my own as to dealing with it. I am an ignorant man. When
  you talk about any catastrophe to be brought about by plotters which might
  threaten the security of France, you talk in a language which I do not
  understand. If you spoke of war I might follow you. I gather, however, that
  it is not war you mean."</p>

  <p>"Cast your thoughts back to that forbidden period," Mermillon enjoined
  sadly. "Think of some of those whose names you have heard whispered in
  connection with it. It is the corruption of humanity, of educated humanity,
  the corruption which has found its way into the best and most secret places
  which I have in my mind. Compared with that the menace of Germany or any
  foreign power is nothing. The philandering of England, the commercial outcry
  against us from America, the perpetualally waved sword of Italy will never
  harm us. If France perishes the deed is her own."</p>

  <p>"But surely our present position&mdash;" Perissol began.</p>

  <p>"Let us have done with the subject," Mermillon interrupted. "Discussive
  talk is useless and it will never come within your province, dear General, to
  strike either the blow that would free France or the blow that would cripple
  her for ever. You must not take me too seriously. You know the critics of my
  career do sometimes say this against me, that I have done good work, that I
  am a sound statesman, and that I have shown myself a real patriot, but that I
  am also something of a dreamer. Let us leave it at that. I may have that
  faculty of seeing too far across the horizon into a visionary kingdom.
  Sometimes too strong a vision bleeds horrible fancies...We are to have a
  strange neighbour, it seems."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head seaward towards the opening of the bay. There was a
  line of dark smoke curling upward from a long grey vessel moving at a
  considerable speed. Mermillon examined it through his glasses in interested
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"What on earth can this be?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Probably an old-fashioned oil tanker on its way to Antibes harbour,"
  Perissol observed, as he rose to his feet. "I see them sometimes from my
  windows."</p>

  <p>Mermillon, his glasses still in his hand, moved to the side of the
  yacht.</p>

  <p>"But this is unbelievable," he pointed out. "It is a small
gunboat&mdash;one of
  our own, I imagine, to judge by the flag. What on earth can she be doing
  coming in here?"</p>

  <p>She was travelling now at half-speed&mdash;a shallow grey warship of
somewhat
  antiquated type, but still formidable with her sharp bow and the morning sun
  flashing upon her forward guns. Perissol looked at her steadily.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand naval movements," he remarked, "but is it not strange
  that she should be travelling alone?"</p>

  <p>"I should have thought so," Mermillon agreed, lowering his glasses.
  "Certainly she has no business in here."</p>

  <p>The two men watched her with interest as she made slow progress towards
  them. An officer upon the bridge held a chart in one hand. Two marines were
  taking soundings. Her anchor went down finally in the middle of the bay about
  a hundred yards away from the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>.</p>

  <p>"Incredible," Mermillon murmured.</p>

  <p>"Incredible, but it has happened," Perissol observed. "After all, it is
  not the first time."</p>

  <p>"It is one of those apparently simple affairs which intrigue one," the
  other reflected. "I shall forget for the moment that I am spending my brief
  vacation incognito. I shall send across a note to the commander and ask for
  an explanation of his visit."</p>

  <p>"Why not wait and see if he has not brought some sort of a message for
  you?" Perissol suggested.</p>

  <p>Mermillon shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am devoured by a curiosity which is worse than the curiosity of a
  woman," he confessed with an easy smile. "I must know, and know at once, what
  an unescorted French gunboat is doing in Garoupe Bay. You will excuse me
  while I write a note, General. Perhaps you would like the pinnace to take you
  ashore?"</p>

  <p>"I think I should like to wait and hear the news," the latter said. "Ah,"
  he added, with a change of tone. "My curiosity is already assuaged."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Mermillon demanded, pausing on his way below.</p>

  <p>Perissol pointed to the landing stage belonging to the great
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> in the woods opposite.</p>

  <p>"The Marquis de Montelimar who lives opposite," he confided, "has two sons
  in the navy. He has also one singularly attractive daughter. Look! I fancy
  that the mystery is solved."</p>

  <p>A motor boat had shot out from the basin at the end of which was the
  landing stage. Her prow was in the air from the moment she started. Almost
  before Mermillon had time to reply she was half way to the gun-boat.</p>

  <p>"A possible solution, without a doubt," the latter admitted.
  "Nevertheless, I shall invite the commander to make me a call. Private
  excursions in gunboats of the French navy are not exactly orthodox. Every now
  and then," he concluded, with a shrug of the shoulders, "even a Cabinet
  Minister who has the reputation of being an economist has to assert
  himself."</p>

  <p>General Perissol did what he seldom did&mdash;he hesitated. The situation
  presented its own special difficulties.</p>

  <p>"In a way, my friend," he said, "I, too, am greatly intrigued by this
  arrival. I, too, when I reflect upon the matter, feel that it is within the
  province of my duty to pay a visit to the commander. Should you consider me
  in any way intrusive if I ventured to accompany you?"</p>

  <p>Mermlllon's smile was altogether disarming.</p>

  <p>"My dear General," he said, "how could you imagine such a thing? Nothing
  would give me greater pleasure. I shall delay you only a matter of five or
  ten minutes whilst I clothe myself. The cutter will be ready. We will solve
  this mystery together. <i>A bient&ocirc;t</i>."</p>

  <p>The motor boat which had put off from the beach of the Marquis de
  Montelimar drew up with a great commotion on the far side of the gunboat.
  Rather reluctantly an <i>&eacute;chelle</i> was let down. Louise, in
  beautifully cut blue flannel pyjamas and seaman's jersey, ran lightly up the
  steps. An officer stood at the top, who saluted, but the opening on to the
  deck was barred.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon me, Madame," he announced, "but visitors are not allowed
  without due notice."</p>

  <p>"I am sure your commander will have a word with me," Louise insisted. "The
  matter is urgent."</p>

  <p>"Your name, Madame?" the officer enquired. "I am the Princess de Fantany,
  but my name does not matter. I have a private message from the person whom
  the commander has come to meet here, which must be delivered instantly."</p>

  <p>The officer saluted and made a brief report to his commander. The latter
  made his appearance almost at once. His manner was not exactly
  hospitable.</p>

  <p>"We know who you are, of course, Princess," he admitted, "but, as my
  lieutenant has told you, we are not prepared to receive visitors."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she replied, "but listen. You have come here with orders from
  your Admiral at Toulon, but at the instigation of the Chef de la Surete of
  France. I am in General Perissol's confidence, as he will tell you when you
  meet. There is also here in the bay another Cabinet Minister&mdash;the
Secretary
  of State for Foreign Affairs. You have instructions, I believe, to reveal to
  no one except to General Perissol the reason for your coming."</p>

  <p>"My mission entails a certain amount of secrecy," the commander
  acknowledged, a little bewildered. One thing, however, is certain&mdash;I am
here
  to do the bidding of the Chef de la Surete Nationale."</p>

  <p>"Then please accept these instructions, which will be confirmed personally
  by him in the course of the morning," she begged. "You are here to take
  soundings of the place and to present a report to the Admiralty. It is quite
  a usual thing, I believe, for ships of your class to pay visits of this
  description."</p>

  <p>The pinnace was lying by tile side of the "<i>Aigle Noir</i>" and already
  Mermillon had appeared in the act of descending the gangway. Louise's
  expression and tone at once became vital.</p>

  <p>"You will please understand that this is a serious matter," she continued.
  "I do not ask you to take my word. You admit that you are here to do the
  bidding of General Perissol&mdash;the most important man in France&mdash;and
to keep
  silent as to your business from anyone else. I simply ask you to remember
  that. The General has special need of your services, but without secrecy they
  would be useless."</p>

  <p>"Did the General send you here to me, Princess?" the commander
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"He did not, because he has not had time," she answered. "The trouble is
  that you have arrived twenty-four hours before you were expected. I happen to
  know something of the position. I saw your arrival and I hastened here to
  remind you. You must answer questions and obey orders only from Monsieur le
  General and no one else must know that you are here at his bidding."</p>

  <p>"This is entirely in accordance with my instructions, Princess," the
  commander acquiesced after a moment's reflection. "I will accept your hint. I
  will confer with no one else until I have spoken privately with the General.
  At the same time, most regretfully, I can only repeat that I must not allow
  you on board without permission from General Perissol."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him lightly.</p>

  <p>"I have not the least desire to come," she assured him. "I have
  accomplished all that I wish. Later on, however, you will probably receive a
  visit from my great friends here at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. The Marquis de
  Montelimar has two sons in the navy."</p>

  <p>"Fran&ccedil;ois is on one of our destroyers at Toulon," the commander
  remarked, unbending at last. "We shall hope to have the pleasure of
  entertaining you on board then, Princess."</p>

  <p>The sound of the approaching launch terrified her. She ran down the stops
  back into the boat and shot away at a great speed. She pretended not to
  notice the arriving visitors. The commander remained in his place to receive
  his guests. It was the General who first mounted the steps. Mermillon was
  watching with a slight frown upon his face the retreating launch, headed now
  for the open sea with a long line of white foam behind it.</p>

  <p>The commander leaned over the rail as the two men mounted.</p>

  <p>"May I inquire as to the reason for your visit, gentlemen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Commander," Mermillon replied. "I will tell you our names
  which may do instead. Mine is Edouard Mermillon, and I have the honour to be,
  as you probably know, a minister in the French Cabinet. The gentleman behind
  me is, however, a really famous person. He is General Perissol, occupying the
  new post of Chef de la Surete of the whole of the French police. He has also
  a portfolio."</p>

  <p>The commander stood on one side. The other officers saluted. The way was
  made clear.</p>

  <p>"I am proud to receive you, gentlemen," the former said. "Please step on
  board. We have nothing very luxurious in the way of accommodation here," he
  added, as he ushered them down the deck. "Such as we have, however, is at
  your disposition. This is my cabin."</p>

  <p>Cigarettes and cigars were produced. Mermillon courteously waved them on
  one side.</p>

  <p>"At this hour of the morning we are full of apologies for our visit. I
  happened to be on the deck of my boat with General Perissol here, and saw you
  come in, commander. I must confess to having been greatly intrigued."</p>

  <p>"In what manner, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I find it difficult to understand what affairs a naval unit could
  possibly have, unattached to any force, in a small bay like this."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. In Mermillon's lazy voice there had been no
  trace of anything beyond a mild curiosity. Perissol was standing&mdash;a
little in
  the background&mdash;a grim and silent figure. It was an unfortunate
position in
  which he had been placed. If things went ill, he was preparing himself.
  Nevertheless, the commander's reply was an immense relief to him.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," the latter confided, "our navy regulations book, as you know,
  forbids us to answer any question from strangers, but a Cabinet Minister has,
  of course, special rights. I have been sent here by the admiral at Toulon to
  take some soundings around the opening of this bay at various states of the
  tide."</p>

  <p>"I must admit," Mermillon acknowledged frankly, "that I never dreamt of
  such a thing. I thought of every reason for your presence here, but that.
  By-the-by, you have been so courteous that I shall venture upon one more
  question&mdash;was it my fancy, or did you not receive a lady visitor a few
  minutes ago?"</p>

  <p>"I did not receive her, sir," was the prompt denial. "It would have been
  utterly contrary to regulations."</p>

  <p>"Did she go so far as to explain the reason of her coming?" Mermillon
  persisted gently.</p>

  <p>"I gathered," the other explained, "that she was staying at the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, the owner of which&mdash;the Marquis de
Montelimar&mdash;has two
  sons in the navy, both in our fleet. She wished to offer me the hospitality
  of her friends, but I had to tell her we could not accept until our work here
  was finished."</p>

  <p>Mermillon rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am obliged to you, sir," he said, "for answering my question so
  frankly. Your boat, I see, is the Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;. And your name?"</p>

  <p>"Commander Berard. At your service, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>Mermillon extended his hand.</p>

  <p>"We shall not detain you a moment longer. Is your business likely to take
  you long?"</p>

  <p>"About a week, I should think. I shall telephone each day to the Admiral.
  He will tell me if the result of my work here is in any way interesting and
  if it is worth continuing."</p>

  <p>"If you stay long enough and have an hour to spare at any time," Mermillon
  invited graciously, "the hospitality of my yacht is at your service. I should
  be delighted to see you for lunch or dinner any day if you will signal first
  to be sure that we are on board. We are lying across the bay there."</p>

  <p>"I shall venture to pay my respects, sir," the commander assured his
  distinguished visitor.</p>

  <p>Mermillon let his fingers dabble in the water on their swift homeward
  voyage. He seemed a little thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he reflected, "I must have seemed to be making rather a
  fool of myself to that young man."</p>

  <p>Perissol, who still preserved his attitude of indifference, shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Your questions were perfectly in order," he remarked. "The only point
  is&mdash;I don't know exactly what replies you expected to receive. Charting
the
  coast waters is one of the duties of the navy."</p>

  <p class="first">"'Fresh as the foam, new bathed in Paphian wells,'" Hamer
Wildburn quoted
  as, stooping down, he pulled Lucienne from the water, up the steps and on to
  his boat, the sea shine glittering upon her bathing suit. "Say, if you had
  not come this morning, I should have put on my shore clothes and presented
  myself at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>."</p>

  <p>"A young man who can quote poetry lying on his stomach," she laughed
  "deserves a visit from Aphrodite herself. I am terribly sorry, Hamer my dear
  but we have a houseful, and you know what that means. Thank goodness we have
  our own bay the other side so I can escape sometimes. I must lie in the sun
  while I dry."</p>

  <p>"Your peignoir is here," he pointed out. "I fetched it up directly I saw
  you on the quay."</p>

  <p>"Plenty of cushions are all I want for the moment," she answered, "then a
  cigarette and perhaps another swim."</p>

  <p>"And luncheon?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Not a chance," she sighed "We have a houseful of young people at the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. You can come up and join us if you like."</p>

  <p>"Not to-day, I'm afraid," he regretted. "You forget that I am a struggling
  journalist. I have to get some of my stuff off to Paris this afternoon. It's
  good to see you, Lucienne."</p>

  <p>"And it's such a relief to be here," she assured him. "You have made me
  feel very unsocial, my dear Hamer. I no longer like to sit in a chattering
  group and talk scandal and nonsense. I am becoming a serious person."</p>

  <p>She took his hand and twined her fingers between his.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you ever to change," he said. "I love your gaiety. I am
  sometimes rather a sober sort of chap myself. It does one good to hear your
  laughter and have to rack one's brains to keep pace with you."</p>

  <p>"Dear Hamer," she murmured, "kiss me."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, after a tentative glance around. She scoffed at him as she drew
  away.</p>

  <p>"<i>Que tu es sot</i>!" she exclaimed. "Did you think I hadn't made sure
  that no one was looking? That was a psychological minute. It may not recur
  during the whole of my visit. There was not a soul on the quay, and we are
  just out of sight from the <i>plage</i>. However, you probably don't like
  kissing. It's a pity."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot or I shall take you below," he threatened. "Tell me
  something, will you, Lucienne?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"For the last three or four days there has been a very powerful motor boat
  lying in your pool there, a white one with a rather large cabin aft, and I
  should think very powerful engines She doesn't belong to you people, does
  she?"</p>

  <p>"No, she belongs to Louise de Fantany. She is a great friend of the house,
  and we let her keep it there when she wants to. She has a lovely
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, but it is up in the mountains."</p>

  <p>"Louise de Fantany," he repeated. "Tell me about her."</p>

  <p>"So soon?" Lucienne sighed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of that sort," he declared scornfully, "and no secrets from you,
  my sweetheart. She is the lady who swam aboard my yacht at 3 o'clock in the
  morning! You know&mdash;I've told you all about her visit."</p>

  <p>Lucienne sat up with a gasp.</p>

  <p>"The half-naked woman who tried to do that old-fashioned stunt&mdash;to
drug
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't make me blush," he begged. "She's the woman all right. I caught a
  glimpse of her this morning."</p>

  <p>"What was she doing here?" Lucienne asked curiously. "She hasn't been to
  the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>."</p>

  <p>"She drove up in a fast car at about a hundred kilometres an hour," he
  replied, "came like a streak down to the motor boat, started up in 30
  seconds, and shot over to the gunboat. She didn't go on board, but she talked
  to the commander for a few minutes and then went off seawards, going at a
  terrific pace."</p>

  <p>"She's crazy," Lucienne declared.</p>

  <p>"That's how I figure it out," he agreed. "Anyway, if she's a friend of
  yours, I thought you might return the emerald she dropped here that
  night."</p>

  <p>Lucienne's eyes were wide open. She lifted herself once more from her
  recumbent position.</p>

  <p>"Not one of her famous emeralds?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about famous jewels," the young man answered. "I
  only know that it's an emerald."</p>

  <p>"And she hasn't been to claim it?"</p>

  <p>"The first glimpse I have had of her since was this morning in the motor
  boat."</p>

  <p>An expression of blank bewilderment was reflected in Lucienne's charming
  face.</p>

  <p>"Ah! <i>par exemple</i>!" she murmured. "My dear, do you know what that
  necklace is worth?"</p>

  <p>"No idea."</p>

  <p>"She gave a hundred and eighty thousand pounds for it&mdash;pounds
sterling,
  mind!"</p>

  <p>"Then she was crazy," he declared, "to go in swimming with that much round
  her neck."</p>

  <p>She turned over on her side to face her companion. Those soft brown eyes
  were filled with something more than curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Hamer," she demanded, "why did she take risks like that? What is there on
  this harmless little boat to send people demented in that fashion? A French
  Cabinet Minister has arrived here to try and buy it, Louise de Fantany tried
  to do the same thing and when she found you didn't want to sell, she searched
  the place. What for? You are not anybody in disguise, are you Hamer? You are
  not a secret agent of one of the world's great politicians incognito with
  boxes full of treaties in your wardrobe?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing has got me set," he confessed. I'm just a journalist,
  I've told you that before."</p>

  <p>"Journalists come across secrets sometimes," she reflected.</p>

  <p>"The greatest secret of my life," he replied, is that I adore you."</p>

  <p>"I wish you didn't have to keep it a secret," she said naively. The
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> is full of eligible young Frenchmen and my beloved mamma
  is beginning to get curious about you. Such clever people mothers, when they
  have ingenuous daughters like me to deal with. She knows that there is
  someone and she is beginning to realise that it's you."</p>

  <p>"I'll speak to your father whenever you give me permission. I've told you
  that before," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow then or the next day," she sighed. "I warn you that you may
  find him just a little difficult."</p>

  <p>Hamer nodded.</p>

  <p>"I can quite understand that," he admitted. I must seem a pretty useless
  sort of person to him, living on a boat and writing articles for the Paris
  edition of an American newspaper. Got a Duke staying there, too, haven't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I see the French paper every morning. Gets the news quicker than any
  other. 'Amongst the guests staying at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> de la
  Garoupe...Duc de Montessset.'"</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think it odd, Hamer," she confided, "that in a republican
  country like this one thinks of titles any more. I don't think I do. The old
  world that one hears about has fallen away. Perhaps it is as well. We are all
  more genuine men and women nowadays, but if you have been born in it there is
  a sort of glamour that holds. Mother has nearly shaken herself free.
  Father&mdash;never."</p>

  <p>"He would like to see you the Duchesse de Montesset?"</p>

  <p>"Even if there were no <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, no money, no estates, I
  believe that he would," she admitted. "I have tried my best to laugh him out
  of such ideas. We have no court to go to. It is not dignified to be always
  accepting our position only at the hands of foreigners. I am a Frenchwoman,
  and I tell father that the only thing I can do is to be a Frenchwoman like
  the others. Being a duchess would make me no different. There is no reality
  about it. Guy is not particularly intelligent, he is not madly good looking,
  his manners are no better than other young men's. The <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> is
  wonderful. There is already a scheme headed by the mayor of the nearest town
  to take it over&mdash;with some sort of a recompense, I suppose&mdash;and
turn it into
  a museum. There is no dignity in the position of being a French aristocrat in
  a republican country."</p>

  <p>He put his arm round her.</p>

  <p>"You are going to be an American citizen," he told her, "and you shall
  live in any country of the world you choose."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's something," she sighed. "You will give up America for me
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Pay visits there now and then, of course. I think you would like New
  York."</p>

  <p>"I feel to-day that I should love any place with you, Hamer," she
  whispered. "When the sun shines like this I feel that it must be France, but
  then I feel so affectionate, too, that it really doesn't matter. Give me one
  of your cigarettes, and the lightest cocktail you can make and I shall swim
  home, be punctual for lunch, and see what I can do with daddy. If I come and
  wave to you in the afternoon you are to come over in the dinghy."</p>

  <p>"You are an adorable child," he said a little huskily, "and this time I
  don't care whether anyone is looking or not..Afterwards I'll fetch the
  emerald."</p>

  <p>The cigarette was smoked, the cocktail duly approved. Then Hamer Wildburn
  produced a small wooden box, and in the centre of it the pendant emerald. She
  gave a little gasp.</p>

  <p>"Hamer," she exclaimed, "it is the pendant. It is the best emerald of the
  whole necklace."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"So Monsieur Mermillon seemed to think when he pointed it out."</p>

  <p>She looked at it for several moments intently.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth doesn't Louise come and claim it?" she marvelled.</p>

  <p>"I have asked myself that question more than once," Hamer Wildburn
  admitted gravely. "The only conclusion I can come to is that if she makes a
  fuss about, it she must disclose the fact of her visit here. She is in some
  sort of a plot and she wants to keep behind the curtain. Well, when you give
  her this back you can tell her that her secret doesn't exist, that I am no
  chatterbox. Unless it becomes necessary I shall never mention the fact of her
  visit here&mdash;especially if she is a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>She handed the box back.</p>

  <p>"You don't think that I am going to swim with this in my hand," she
  protested. "Keep it, Hamer, or send it up by your <i>matelot</i> some time.
  Louise lives at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> de Mougins, only about ten
  kilometres from here."</p>

  <p>He thrust the box into the pocket of his trousers. "I'll tell you what I
  shall do while you are frivolling with this crowd," he said. "I'm going over
  the boat with the plan and a hammer to tap the panels. I'm going to turn the
  old lady inside out to see what I've got that brings Cabinet Ministers here
  to beg, and a Princess to commit a crime and leave behind a twenty thousand
  pound emerald. Think of me as spending the afternoon in a sort of Aladdin's
  cave, Lucienne."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have any treasure aboard at all," she told him, pausing
  for a minute on the last step. "I think you have another man&mdash;or
perhaps a
  woman&mdash;in the Iron Mask whom you are keeping locked up in a small hole
  somewhere in the galley and whom you let out at nights. When I get back I
  shall consult the Almanac and see if any crowned head or dictator is missing.
  If you are playing gaoler to one of these, Hamer, you can begin to shiver in
  your shoes. Father and I between us will spot him."</p>

  <p>With a little backward wave of the hand she dived gracefully into the sea.
  Almost immediately she turned over upon her back, and, facing the boat, threw
  him a kiss.</p>

  <p>"<i>A demain, mon amour</i>," she called to him softly.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">A small but perfectly appointed seaplane circled gracefully
round the Bay
  of Garoupe, and finally alighted within a yard or two of the <i>Aigle
  Noir</i>. A few moments later the Baron de Brett, looking very smart in his
  white flannels and rakish-looking panama, climbed the gangway of the boat and
  descended into the lounge. Mermillon, who had just finished working with a
  messenger from his bureau in Paris, sent the latter away. He swung round to
  greet his friend.</p>

  <p>"Well, what luck?" he asked. "<i>Comme toujours, je gagne</i>," was the
  indifferent reply. "But enough of that. Explain to me quickly&mdash;what is
the
  meaning of a gunboat in the bay?"</p>

  <p>The French statesman shrugged his shoulders slightly. His manner was
  evidently intended to convey the impression that the matter was of no
  particular moment.</p>

  <p>"I interviewed the commander a few minutes after his arrival," he
  confided. "He is here to take soundings. It is a part of the coast which the
  French Navy have never considered seriously, either for purposes of attack or
  defence, and he is here to draw up a report."</p>

  <p>"But for us," the Baron exclaimed, "the affair is an impossibility! Can
  you not telephone to the admiral and request its withdrawal? You surely have
  enough influence for that&mdash;the noises disturb your repose&mdash;you are
here on a
  much-needed vacation, and must have complete rest."</p>

  <p>"I have considered the matter," Mermillon replied. "I tell you frankly I
  do not see what possible excuse I can invent. It is not seemly for a
  politician on vacation to interfere with the activities of either of the
  services. To what real nuisance can we claim that we are subjected on account
  of the presence of the gunboat? It might disturb our fishing. It might, in
  this small space, render the waters of the bay less attractive, but can a
  good Frenchman complain of such a thing?"</p>

  <p>"A mild remonstrance," the Baron suggested.</p>

  <p>Mermillon shook his head. "You are not a diplomat, my dear friend," he
  commented. "An angry one would be more disarming."</p>

  <p>"Why the devil doesn't that pig-headed American go for a cruise?" the
  Baron demanded furiously. "We could deal with him on the open seas all
  right."</p>

  <p>"We might be able to," Mermillon agreed, "but can you tell me how to get
  him on to the open seas? He is on terms of close friendship with the
  Montelimars, the people at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. A very beautiful young
  lady from there visits him daily. They lunch together often upon the boat. If
  you were this pig-headed person you would be the first to find it difficult
  to move away under such conditions. That, I think, was at the back of his
  mind when he offered to sell the boat in two months' time. He has no
  intention of leaving his situation here until matters are arranged.
  Incidentally, the young lady will have a fortune of millions."</p>

  <p>The Baron grunted.</p>

  <p>"The Montelimars are wealthy enough," he admitted. "We once did some
  business together."</p>

  <p>"If you have done business with him, my dear Baron," Mermillon remarked
  with a smile, "perhaps we had better keep away from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," was the half indignant reply. "We have met only on questions
  of high finance and Montelimar, or rather the firm he was connected with,
  made money by our transaction."</p>

  <p>Mermillon touched the bell by his side. "We will have a word with
  Chicotin," he decided.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty about that for the latter was, they were informed,
  waiting outside for an audience. Monsieur Chicotin, whose nationality was
  Russian, had survived an infamous past by reason of his skill in the
  manufacture of explosives. He was even now in possession of several diplomas
  from various nations and, in moments of expansion and in the right company,
  he was accustomed to boast that he had slain more men with his own fingers
  than any regiment of soldiers in the world. He was a smooth, dapper-looking
  person, with eyes set far too close together, in appearance a cross between a
  gigolo and an apache. Mermillon motioned him to a seat and waited until the
  door was closed. It transpired that Monsieur Chicotin was angry.</p>

  <p>"I am here to demand," he began, "if all my work is to be for nothing. Why
  do you ask me to solve an interesting and important scientific problem and
  then allow it to be rendered useless?"</p>

  <p>"You are apparently suffering from some hallucination," Mermillon observed
  gently. "I sent for you to ask how near you were to the completion of your
  task."</p>

  <p>"One&mdash;two hours," was the eager reply. "I hesitate to put the
finishing
  touches because they should only be there a brief period before use. I have
  done what you asked me for. I have produced an instrument, adjustable by
  clockwork, which would destroy the boat you pointed out to me&mdash;not to
clumsy
  fragments, not like the affairs of my younger days which blew a man's head in
  one direction and his legs in the other, but left his body without
  demolition. I have achieved a wonderful task. My success is so great that I
  assure you gentlemen that placed on any part of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>
  my engine would not blow her up in the old-fashioned parlance. It would
  disintegrate her. There would not be a recognisable molecule of timber or of
  metal or of any known material substance to be found afterwards. She and all
  that she is made of would disappear into air. The theoretical scientist would
  tell you that absolute destruction is impossible. As a matter of
  practice&mdash;no. Any class of man with any class of intelligence might
search
  these seas, might employ divers underneath and searchers upon all the near
  land, and not one fragment or atom would they ever discover of the ship
  itself or any anyone who had been on her at the time of the explosion."</p>

  <p>"Marvellous," Mermillon acknowledged with a congratulatory smile. "You
  have earned your money at any rate, Chicotin. It is for us to take advantage
  of your success."</p>

  <p>"You will be almost as clever as I have been if you do," the Russian
  replied gloomily. "Shall I tell you what that gunboat is here for?"</p>

  <p>"We understand," Mermillon confided, "that she is here to take soundings.
  She already has a boat at work."</p>

  <p>"<i>Quelle blague</i>!" Chicotin exclaimed scornfully. "I am a man with
  curiosity and I make inquiries. I know that soundings in this bay are worth
  nothing to the French navy. I take a walk. I see and I observe. On one side
  of that boat there are guns-small guns, but loaded. On the other there is a
  range of powerful searchlights. They have a new double reflector on an
  apparatus ready to set to work at a moment's notice. How am I to cross the
  bay, get the two minutes which is all I need on board the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>, whilst by day there are four look-out men to observe me, and at
  night one of the most powerful searchlights in the world? Taking soundings,
  indeed! What folly! They have heard that Chicotin is at work. Believe me,
  those guns and those searchlights are there for that reason!"</p>

  <p>"Getting you on board and away again must be our responsibility,"
  Mermillon assured him. "You have completed your share of the bargain. We
  accept your word that the instrument is all that you say. The amount
  promised&mdash;fifty thousand francs&mdash;will creep into your banking
account at the
  Credit Lyonnais in Marseilles in the same way as payments have been made
  before."</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est quelque chose</i>," Chicotin admitted.</p>

  <p>"It is a great deal, my friend," Mermillon insisted. "It frees you from
  all anxiety. Not a single soul&mdash;neither the messenger nor the manager
of the
  bank&mdash;knows how that money comes there. But it arrives. You will be in a
  position to begin spending it in four days' time. If, having finished your
  work, you feel the need of a little relaxation before then, here is something
  that may help."</p>

  <p>He flicked a small packet of <i>mille</i> notes across the table. Chicotin
  snatched them up with talon-like fingers.</p>

  <p>"It is a gracious gesture this which I accept," he declared.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," his employer continued, "I understand that you have
  left the absolute completion of your work of art until immediately before its
  use is required."</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly correct," Chicotin assented. "There is no clumsiness in
  my work. The instrument as it is at present&mdash;it looks too beautiful for
  destruction&mdash;is perfectly harmless. You could smash it to pieces with a
  hammer and nothing would happen, but one hour's work, the contents of a small
  phial in a certain cell and you have the most complete weapon of destruction
  which the fingers of an artist have ever completed."</p>

  <p>The little man was bursting with vanity. He wiped the perspiration from
  his damp, unwholesome forehead. Without asking permission, he rolled some
  shreds of villainous-looking tobacco into a soiled paper and commenced to
  smoke furiously.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Mermillon decided. "Leave everything as it is,
  Chicotin. Remain patient while we consider what is to be done. Accept our
  congratulations, my brave man, upon an excellent piece of work."</p>

  <p>Chicotin shook hands with his two patrons and swaggered out. Mermillon
  watched him until he disappeared with a gleam of amusement in his eyes. Then
  he turned to his companion.</p>

  <p>"And now, my dear Baron," he suggested, "search in the recesses of that
  marvellous brain of yours. What can now be effected."</p>

  <p>"I propose," the Baron said, "to pay a visit to my dear friend, the
  Marquise de Montelimar. What may come of it we will discuss later in the
  day."</p>

  <p>"It is probably an inspired idea," Mermillon assented graciously. "If you
  do not return for lunch, my friend, I shall understand."</p>

  <p>The Baron retired to his suite with the object of making some change in
  his toilet. An hour later his car turned into the spacious grounds of the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> de la Garoupe.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">The Baron de Brett was ushered at once on to the fine broad
terrace of the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, where he was received in friendly and flattering
  fashion. It seemed in every way to be a fortuitous visit. The Marquise was
  enchanted to meet again her old admirer, and the young people, who had just
  trooped in from bathing, were duly impressed by the presence in their midst
  of one of the prominent figures in world finance. The Marquis, a tall and
  dignified personage, who had at one time been a senator, greeted his visitor
  with especial cordiality.</p>

  <p>"I could scarcely believe it when I heard that you were in these parts,"
  he said. "If I had not known that you were in the company of a very
  distinguished man who prefers always to spend his vacation in solitude I
  should have ventured to pay my respects."</p>

  <p>"You would have been very welcome," the Baron assured his friend. "Edouard
  Mermillon is, however, I must admit, a queer fellow. We have separate suites,
  of course, and I see very little of him. He is fonder of solitude than any
  man I ever knew."</p>

  <p>"Not so his <i>camarade, mon ami</i>," the Marquise intervened. "I heard
  of your running an enormous bank at Monte Carlo last night surrounded by half
  the beautiful women in Europe."</p>

  <p>"An exaggeration," the Baron declared. "Exaggeration, I can assure you.
  The eyes of all the ladies whom I chanced to notice were fixed upon the
  cards. They were searching for eights and nines rather than for
  compliments."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," the Marquise sighed, "Monte Carlo must have been quite
  like the old days. I hear you had good fortune, too. How thrilling! Of
  course, they don't permit women to run a bank, and I should never have the
  courage anyway, but I think that it must be fascinating."</p>

  <p>"I was a humble loiterer in the background," a young man of the party
  remarked. "I saw the Baron pay out on one hand nearly seven hundred thousand
  francs."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, baccarat and the sunshine don't go together," the Baron
  observed, accepting a cocktail and lighting a cigarette. "Pray do not imagine
  for one moment that I am imposing upon your hospitality by calling before
  luncheon. The fact is that I live almost at the end of the wire. I have just
  finished to-day's business, but I am never certain that I may not be called
  away. Edouard has one of his clerks in the bureau with him, and is busy with
  despatches. I thought it opportune to come and greet my friends."</p>

  <p>"Your place is already laid," the Marquise pointed out, "At this time of
  the year we keep open house. We shall be broken-hearted if you fail us."</p>

  <p>There was a little chorus of confirmation. Lucienne herself come over to
  his side and patted his hand.</p>

  <p>"Baron," she begged, "do not disappoint us all. I have so many friends in
  Paris and Brussels whose news I desire."</p>

  <p>The Baron beamed on everyone.</p>

  <p>"Never was a more willing surrender," he declared. "It is a great joy to
  be amongst so many young people, all so thoroughly happy. Such a season for
  sport, too! Aquaplaning is, alas, an enterprise for the young, but the fast
  motor boat driving I enjoy, and I can still swim enough to find pleasure in
  it. By-the-by, what's the meaning of a gunboat in this peaceful district? It
  gives one quite a sinister feeling to see those unmasked guns."</p>

  <p>"The presence of a gunboat is easily explained," the Marquis confided.
  "The <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> has been told off from Toulon to take
  soundings here, technical business, I suppose, but necessary. I called on the
  commander this morning&mdash;a pleasant fellow and a good officer, I should
think.
  He lunches here to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad that there's such a reasonable explanation for its
  presence," the Baron observed, flicking the ash from his cigarette. "Our
  friend Edouard is a trifle nervous these days, and I think he was inclined to
  wonder whether any hints had been received at headquarters as to the
  necessity for keeping him guarded."</p>

  <p>"I should think that was highly improbable," the Marquis pronounced. "I am
  glad to notice signs of a wave of sanity both in the Press and in public
  speeches which have been made lately. Besides, how could Edouard Mermillon
  have excited ill-feeling amongst any class of people? He is one of the few
  men towards whom France looks for her salvation."</p>

  <p>"I am entirely in accord with you," the Baron agreed. "I think the man who
  raised a hand against Mermillon would be torn to pieces if the mob could get
  at him. By the by, who is the young man who owns the very attractive small
  yacht lying nearest to you?"</p>

  <p>"Better ask Lucienne," was her father's unenthusiastic reply. "She appears
  to know more about him than any of us."</p>

  <p>"Absurd," the girl laughed, peering down through the trees to where the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> was lying in the distance. "His name is Hamer
  Wildburn, and he is a young American journalist, who is very agreeable, but a
  trifle cranky as most of his race are."</p>

  <p>"He arrived during my absence in Paris," the Marquis observed, "and I have
  not yet had the opportunity of meeting him."</p>

  <p>"He behaves well and carries himself as a man of breeding," the Marquise
  said indulgently. "I was pleased with his manners when he lunched here. He
  appears to prefer solitude on the boat, though, or to swim with Lucienne, to
  any attractions we can offer him."</p>

  <p>"That sounds incomprehensible, indeed," the Baron declared.</p>

  <p>"His boat is very attractive," Lucienne remarked, "and he came down here
  to study and lead a very simple life."</p>

  <p>"The <i>Bird of Paradise</i> is a Jewel," de Brett agreed. "Edouard took a
  great fancy to it and tried to buy it from him. He offered him, I think, a
  great deal more than it was worth, but the young man refused to part before
  the end of the season. To a person of such consequence as Edouard Mermillon
  his refusal seemed just a trifle ungracious."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why he should part with his boat to anyone if he wishes to
  keep her," Lucienne objected. "He is, I think, well off. He has settled down
  thoroughly to enjoy his summer after his own fashion. You millionaires," she
  concluded, patting the Baron once more on the hand, "must be taught that you
  can't buy everything in the world."</p>

  <p>"Alas," de Brett sighed, "It is our hard fate to realise that every day.
  Money helps us nowhere nowadays. It is why I remain a bachelor."</p>

  <p>There was an undercurrent of mirth. They most of them knew, none better
  than the Marquise, the stories of the Baron's various escapades. Lucienne
  indulged in a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I adore money," she confided. "You might not find me, for instance, so
  implacable as that young man."</p>

  <p>"'A peasant does not try to drag down a star,'" the Baron quoted. "The
  discouragement of failure has shattered my later days. I may even find myself
  in a monastery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake let the Baron have anything he likes rather than drive
  him into a monastery!" the Marquis interrupted. "I have been through two
  financial crises. I should never have the courage to face a third."</p>

  <p>Lunch was announced and they all trooped to the farther end of the
  terrace. De Brett, seated on the Marquise's right, talked amiably to his
  hostess of their mutual friends in Paris, the beauty of their present
  surroundings, and the charm of possessing a great estate literally by the
  side of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Always," he remarked, "I admire, my dear friend, your husband's tenacity
  of purpose. He has had the courage to cut himself off from the stir of life.
  The world of politics and finance know him no more. In Paris he remains an
  outstanding figure in the social life of the old regime. Here he becomes the
  indolent sun worshipper drinking in renewed life every one of these wonderful
  days."</p>

  <p>The Marquise shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Henri, for all his great gifts," she confided, "was always afflicted with
  a gift of indolence."</p>

  <p>"He thrives upon it," her neighbour observed. "I, who seldom find myself
  with an hour that is not occupied, envy him."</p>

  <p>"I do not think that you need." she replied, a little pettishly. "Men need
  something vital in their lives. Life without risk," she went on, lowering her
  voice, "would be a tasteless affair."</p>

  <p>The Baron smiled cryptically. He, too, had memories."</p>

  <p>"Again it is a matter of temperament," he said. "Temperament and the
  nature of the risk. The time has arrived in my life when the risks are all
  financial. There is a flavour of dead ashes in their stimulation."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly, and patted the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"You say those sort of things hoping for contradiction," she challenged
  him. "I shall disappoint you. I shall not contradict, but I do not believe
  you. Where was she found at last, that wonderful Argentine dancer, who
  disappeared from the Ambassadeurs without giving notice to her director? Ah,
  well," she went on, "do not be alarmed. Fragments of that sort of gossip
  which come my way sometimes I keep to myself. At any rate your method of
  living must have its good points. With your pink and white complexion and
  ingenuous manner I should say that things just now were going well with
  you."</p>

  <p>"One has fewer anxieties," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"For the sake of the country I am glad to hear you say that. These
  terrible crises, then, have really passed? Since Henri adjured politics we
  are so completely removed from the world that nowadays I hear nothing."</p>

  <p>"Politics and finance are not so closely allied as they used to be," he
  explained. "Perhaps that is so much to the good. Still, with Edouard
  Mermillon remaining my greatest friend, of course I hear things. On the
  surface France is a saved country."</p>

  <p>"Saved from what?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Communism, anarchy, a cataclysmic upheaval worse than anything that ever
  happened in Russia," he told her. "Believe me, France was nearer to it than
  the looker-on would ever believe. One hopes now, though, that the storm has
  died away. So long as no other great scandal arrives I think that the spirit
  of the people will remain quiet."</p>

  <p>Luncheon came to its appointed end. There was a general move into more
  comfortable chairs. The Baron found an empty one next to his hostess. They
  were a little removed from the others, and a sudden movement to watch a
  passing liner clearly visible at the end of the long avenue left them almost
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Lily," he whispered, and it was strange how low his voice could become
  upon occasion, "I am a suppliant for your help."</p>

  <p>"You intrigue me."</p>

  <p>"Lucienne and that young American are great friends, are they not?"</p>

  <p>The gesture of the Marquise was eloquent. "Young people take so much
  liberty nowadays," she complained, "one does not know how to control them. It
  is true what you say, however. Lucienne and the young man are on very
  friendly terms."</p>

  <p>"I want his yacht."</p>

  <p>"<i>Quelle id&eacute;e</i>! For yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No, for Edouard Mermillon. He wants it for a birthday present to his
  nephew."</p>

  <p>She leaned even further back in her chair. She was looking over the tops
  of the pine trees at the sky.</p>

  <p>"You must not count on me," she told him. "I have no more interests
  outside my daily life. Besides, I have very little influence over Lucienne,
  and I am inclined to like the young man."</p>

  <p>"Then, you would be doing him the best turn in the world," de Brett
  assured her, "If you persuaded him that a wish of Edouard Mermillon's was
  better granted."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The young man is not the sort that is easily frightened," she said. "No
  arguments of that kind would have the slightest weight with him. You know the
  Anglo-Saxon temperament as well as I do. They are not to be reasoned with. He
  would simply become more obstinate."</p>

  <p>"Consult with Lucienne," he begged. "She might be able to suggest
  something."</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she protested. "I have told you the truth. I have
  gratified all the taste I ever had for intrigue. I want to be left alone.
  Besides, you can't ask favours in that manner without any explanation. You
  should take me into your confidence. What possible reason can Edouard
  Mermillon have for wanting that boat and no other?"</p>

  <p>De Brett watched his fellow guests strolling back to their places, and his
  tone became more urgent.</p>

  <p>"The secret is too compromising a one to inflict upon you."</p>

  <p>"Mysterious but unsatisfying. Frankly, Albert, I am not very much
  interested in your request, and as for Lucienne&mdash;to tell you the truth I
  believe there is only one thing she desires in life."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" he demanded. "To marry Hamer Wildburn."</p>

  <p>"I should think one of the most beautiful young women in France&mdash;her
  mother's daughter, too, for charm us well as looks," he added with a little
  bow, "should find that easy enough, provided her parents made no
  obstacle."</p>

  <p>"Are you suggesting that we should do so?" she asked. "Threats, instead of
  promises now. My dear Albert, be sensible. We are old friends, it is true,
  and any ordinary favour I should probably grant you, but when you ask me to
  interfere with my daughter's happiness, to threaten to withhold our consent
  to her marriage with this young man if she does not humour you in this
  way&mdash;why, the thing becomes ridiculous. I certainly decline to
  interfere."</p>

  <p>"Please don't take that attitude," he begged.</p>

  <p>"It is for the good of himself and everyone else that that young man parts
  with his boat to Edouard Mermillon. He loses nothing. There are a dozen
  others like it, and with the money Mermillon offers him he could buy one
  double the size. If he refuses to sell, I will be quite frank with you, he
  will be threatened with a certain amount of risk&mdash;not from Mermillon
himself,
  naturally, but from entirely outside agencies."</p>

  <p>The Marquise was annoyed.</p>

  <p>"It is a stupid business this," she declared angrily. "I myself have been
  on the boat. I have been in the cabin and the little saloon. I have even been
  in the galley. There is no one concealed there. There is no place for any
  form of concealment. Not all the innuendoes in the world could make a mystery
  ship of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. You would do much better to persuade
  Edouard Mermillon to abandon his whim. No more, if you please. The subject
  wearies me."</p>

  <p>"You refuse me your help, then," he concluded sadly, as he rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will not say that altogether" she temporised, "but I have no
  inducements to offer, and I do not wish to hurt or offend this young American
  gentleman whom Lucienne esteems so highly. A word of mild advice I might give
  him if the subject arises naturally. That is all."</p>

  <p>The Baron's valedictory smile and bow were pleasant, but she recognised a
  somewhat sinister air of disappointment lurking beneath. She watched his
  disappearing figure with a certain amount of uneasiness. Her husband
  approached and sank into the vacant chair by her side.</p>

  <p>"Our friend did not pay us a long visit to-day," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Albert has lost the art of being interesting," she said. "He is learning
  to be prolix. He dwells upon trifles."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," he said, "I am sorry that he hurried. I wanted to ask him
  about this new colonial loan. Its success depends entirely upon whether
  Mermillon gives it his blessing."</p>

  <p>"My dear Henri," she replied reproachfully, "I thought that you had
  altogether abandoned your interests in high finance."</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"An occasional speculation is permitted," he remarked, "when one
  knows."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">Lucienne scrambled up the steps of the <i>Bird of
Paradise</i> and wrapped
  <i>herself</i> in the <i>peignoir</i> which its owner was holding out for
  her.</p>

  <p>"I hope you keep my belongings safely locked up," she laughed. "If you
  have any more people searching the ship you will lose your reputation if it
  is discovered that you have my powder-box, my peignoir, and spare bathing
  suit on board."</p>

  <p>"Your possessions have a cupboard to themselves," he assured her.
  "Sometimes at night when I am feeling very sentimental, I take them out and
  have a little conversation with them."</p>

  <p>"Not the bathing suit, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"The bathing suit more even than any."</p>

  <p>"Most improper," she decided, "but rather charming of you."</p>

  <p>"Why are you so late?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She settled herself comfortably in the lounge chair he was holding.</p>

  <p>"Some slight trouble with the elders of the family," she confided, holding
  out her hand for a cigarette, "backed up in this instance by the
  yellow-haired young Duke who I discovered yesterday bathes in a bracelet and
  an anklet! They all thought that I ought to have gone to our neighbour's
  swimming picnic party. I came to the conclusion it would bore me. The
  discussion, however, took up valuable time."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are here at last," he remarked cheerfully, if a little
  tritely.</p>

  <p>"You have enough luncheon for two?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He reflected.</p>

  <p>"Nothing good enough for you, but whatever I have is at your service.
  There's fruit&mdash;some peaches and nectarines. There is a small ham which
could
  be released from its glass covering, and a brawn. Salad, of course, some of
  your favourite cheese, and a Vin Blanc de Bellet."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a feast for the gods," she declared. "May I stay and share
  it with you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you may," he assured her. "I should have had fish, too, but
  this wretched gunboat seems to have driven them all out of the bay. Anyway, I
  hauled up my baskets empty this morning. Auguste can cook some vegetables,
  though."</p>

  <p>"When I left you the other day," she meditated, "there was a delicious
  smell of fried potatoes floating out of the galley porthole."</p>

  <p>"There shall be fried potatoes," he promised her. She sighed
  contentedly.</p>

  <p>"What a joy it is to be greedy," she murmured. "Until I face the family
  wrath I shall now be perfectly happy."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you let me get this marriage affair fixed up, Lucienne?" he
  pleaded. "It wouldn't matter any more about the family, then."</p>

  <p>She smoothed his hand gently.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to run the slightest risk of spoiling this adorable
  summer."</p>

  <p>"Might be the making of it."</p>

  <p>"It could not be," she assured him. "For one thing, it would not be nearly
  so piquant it I were allowed to steal down here to spend an hour or two with
  you instead of doing it when I am supposed to be somewhere else. And
then&mdash;I
  wish I could explain it to you, <i>mon cher</i>&mdash;marrying and getting
married
  is not so simple a thing in my country as in yours. My mother, I think, would
  have no objections. She has developed a somewhat belated penchant for mild
  flirtations, and she is always afraid that I might interfere. With my father
  it is another matter. He would be terribly formal. He would want to know such
  a great deal about you, and even I know so little."</p>

  <p>Wildburn frowned slightly. His good humoured face took on a new
  expression.</p>

  <p>"What sort of things?" he asked. "Money social stuff&mdash;my genealogical
  tree&mdash;that kind of rubbish?"</p>

  <p>"That kind of rubbish is considered rather important," she answered, a
  trifle unsympathetically. "But, leaving that out for the moment, he would
  want to know what you were doing living down here by yourself on a mystery
  yacht which everyone wants to buy."</p>

  <p>"Not everyone," he remonstrated. "There was the beautiful adventuress out
  of the story book who swam aboard and disappeared after leaving all the
  contents of my cupboard upon the bed and me very clumsily doped. Then your
  famous statesman, Mermillon, and his banker friend, de Brett. No one else
  that I know of."</p>

  <p>"Behold another would-be purchaser!" she exclaimed. "I want to buy it,
  Hamer."</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," he scoffed. "I saw your father's yacht, the
  <i>Hermione</i>, in Marseilles Harbour only a few weeks ago. It is 20 times
  the size of this&mdash;a perfect palace of luxury."</p>

  <p>"I want something I can sail myself with a little help," she confided. "I
  want this yacht&mdash;this particular one."</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully, lit a cigarette, and blew out a cloud of
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"You would resell it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"How clever you are!" she exclaimed. "I should hate to, but I might be
  tempted. But listen, Hamer&mdash;not before I had ransacked her from end to
end,
  tapped every panel for secret hiding-places, felt in the boards for springs,
  gone over her with a shipbuilder, inch by inch. Then, when I had either
  possessed myself of her secret or discovered that she hadn't one, I might
  sell."</p>

  <p>"But I have already searched everywhere," he reminded her. "And now,
  listen," he went on gravely. "There is something kind of mysterious to me in
  your having joined the little company of people who want this boat. You shall
  have her with pleasure, my dear Lucienne, as a wedding present. What about
  that?"</p>

  <p>"It's an idea," she admitted. "I will give you time to think it over," he
  suggested, rising to his feet. "I know what that thirsty gleam in your eyes
  means."</p>

  <p>"The perfect lover," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I will go through all the necessary business with your father whenever
  you tell me to," he continued. "There are some things about me he may not
  like, but I don't see that there is anything to which he could seriously
  object. No one is good enough for you, of course, my dear," he added, leaning
  over her chair.</p>

  <p>"You really, think that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do."</p>

  <p>"Then kiss me, please."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, with flattering alacrity. Her arms left his neck a moment or so
  later with reluctance.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of myself as a marrying man." he confessed. "I had all
  sorts of ideas, but they didn't exactly shape themselves that way. I expect I
  shall get the hang of it all right, though."</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to think that you will do for me very well," she assured
  him. "You notice things so beautifully. I like your having seen that thirsty
  gleam in my eyes."</p>

  <p>"Two minutes&mdash;no longer," he promised.</p>

  <p>In less than that time he reappeared from the companionway, and she was
  listening with lazy pleasure to the tinkling of ice in the silver shaker.</p>

  <p>"Well, is it to be a bargain?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing I am not allowed to marry you?"</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one."</p>

  <p>"Then you can marry me all right if you want to. You won't starve. You may
  lose, perhaps, what you call your social position or a portion of it. You
  will probably like some of my friends and dislike the others cordially. You
  may hate my profession, still, if you care for me enough to marry me you will
  probably make allowances."</p>

  <p>She held out her arms and drew his face downwards. This time there were
  people upon the <i>plage</i>, but there was a certain recklessness about her
  action.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she murmured as their lips met, "if anyone has seen this you
  will have to marry me."</p>

  <p>Their cocktails were served on deck in picnic fashion, and with a pleasant
  absence of formalities. Lucienne was more silent than usual. He, on the other
  hand, had abandoned for the moment his natural taciturnity. He pointed to one
  of the small cutters returning to the gunboat.</p>

  <p>"This is really," he declared, "a bay of mysteries. Can you imagine why
  that old hulk is here?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," she answered. "Father called on the commander yesterday, and
  he came to dinner. The Admiralty are issuing a new chart of the smaller
  Mediterranean bays, and they are here to take soundings."</p>

  <p>"Seems queer to me," he observed. "I should not have said there were any
  soundings in this bay worth a snap of the fingers to the French or any other
  navy."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's what the commander said," she told him. "He asked questions
  about you, too. You really are an American, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Half and half. My father was an American, my mother French. There was a
  great struggle about where I should be brought up. My father won. He was a
  pretty lenient sort of man, but there were some things he was firm about. I
  spent four years at Harvard, and I have been on the Continent most of the
  time since."</p>

  <p>"You are becoming more interesting every moment," she declared.</p>

  <p>"You had better hold on a bit," he warned her. "There's nothing very
  romantic about me. I am a journalist. I write regularly for the Paris edition
  of one of our home newspapers in which my father is interested."</p>

  <p>"That's not so bad," she told him encouragingly. "I know several French
  journalists who come to my mother's receptions. Is your father very rich that
  he has an interest in a newspaper?"</p>

  <p>"I should think he was fairly well off," Hamer acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"That may help with dad," she reflected. "He pretends to think more of
  family than anything else, but he is really a terrible money grubber. I have
  a little money of my own, too, left me by an aunt. All that I shall want from
  you on our wedding day, if not before, is this boat."</p>

  <p>"As a journalist," he confided, "nothing is more unsettling to my peace of
  mind than unsatisfied curiosity. Couldn't you tell me just what you've got on
  your mind, all of you people, about this '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>'?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," she replied firmly, "for the simple reason that I haven't
  the faintest idea. You see, the whole point of the matter is this&mdash;the
secret
  of the '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>' is the secret of other people."</p>

  <p>"It is the first duty of a journalist," he observed, "to find out other
  people's secrets. I expect they would be awfully bucked at my New York office
  if I sent them a marvellous original story."</p>

  <p>"Well, you may do that some day," she promised him. "The day after our
  wedding day, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"What about making that to-morrow?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Absurd! We are not living in Hollywood. We have to be married in a church
  and before the Mayor, and we have to have the consents of our parents, and
  there have to be some sort of legal papers&mdash;even when settlements are not
  necessary. I know all about it. My hand was once asked in marriage by one of
  my own country people. Then came that wretched little war in Morocco, and,
  alas! he disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," the young man murmured.</p>

  <p>"I cannot claim much sympathy," she replied. "I had only seen him twice,
  and then in a crowded salon. I am afraid that the chief feelings I had about
  him were of mild dislike. Still, I should have married him, I suppose, if he
  had come back from Africa."</p>

  <p>Auguste announced luncheon, and they took their places at the improvised
  table, set out aft under the awning.</p>

  <p>"Nothing makes me so domestic," she sighed, "as these little <i>a
  deux</i>. I think I shall make you a good wife, Hamer."</p>

  <p>"You will make an adorable one."</p>

  <p>"If I am as well fed as this, I shall at least be a good tempered one,"
  she assured him, as she finished mixing the salad and served it.</p>

  <p>"Hamer, there never was such a ham. Where ever do you get them?"</p>

  <p>"Ship's stores," he told her. "We put them on at Gibraltar."</p>

  <p>"And to think that all my wretched house guests," she reflected, "are
  squatting in uncomfortable positions on the sands or leaning against jagged
  rocks, and eating sandwiches from one hand and balancing a luke-warm drink in
  the other! I am afraid I shall be a better wife than a hostess, Hamer."</p>

  <p>"Don't let's entertain at all then," he proposed. "Two is such a wonderful
  number."</p>

  <p>"Hamer," she broke in, looking downwards, "who is that villainous looking
  foreign person in the small dinghy? He has been round the boat twice."</p>

  <p>"No idea," was the somewhat indifferent reply.</p>

  <p>"Remember," she warned him, "you must take the greatest care of your boat
  now that it has become a consideration of our marriage. It must be delivered
  to me in good condition the day afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I hope my boat is not the only consideration?"</p>

  <p>"It is not. I like you very much, Hamer, dear. I have never really quite
  understood what it means to love anybody, but I think that I love you. I am
  quite sure that I am going to very much. Nevertheless, I must have the
  boat."</p>

  <p>"Before I part with her I shall give her a good overhauling myself," he
  announced. "The <i>Bird of Paradise</i> is a nice little craft, and I think I
  bought her cheap, but I really do not know what there is about her to send
  people crazy."</p>

  <p>"You have had quite an interesting time, anyhow, since you tied up your
  corps mort here," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"You bet, I have. The most interesting and the most wonderful time of my
  life."</p>

  <p>There was a brief but happy pause. She leaned back and straightened her
  hair.</p>

  <p>"We are going to have such fun up at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> this
  evening," she told him. "My revered father is sufficiently ruffled already
  because I backed out of going to the party, but when he knows how I have
  spent the day, and what the result of it all has been, there will be, as you
  say, don't you, fur flying?"</p>

  <p>"He'll want to kick me out, you mean, when I pay my formal visit?" Hamer
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Father would never kick anybody. His manners are the most perfect thing
  about him. He may make difficulties, however."</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't take a bit of notice of them," the young man advised her
  confidently. "I feel that I shall make a marvellously good husband."</p>

  <p>"You fulfil the first qualification of a husband all right," she declared,
  laughing. "You are full of assurance and you amuse me tremendously. You know
  what Moliere said in one of his comedies&mdash;that the husband who keeps
his wife
  amused never loses her?"</p>

  <p>"Don't try me too high," he begged. "Remember, there is no international
  standard of humour, and I shan't want to part with you."</p>

  <p>"I shall be a wife worth keeping," she promised him hopefully. "Not only
  am I, as you may have noticed, remarkably pretty, but I can be very
  affectionate."</p>

  <p>"You are the prettiest girl I ever saw," he pronounced. "I always adored
  chestnut hair and brown eyes. Your mouth too&mdash;well, I could write a
column,
  being a professional journalist, on your mouth alone."</p>

  <p>She glanced in the mirror which she had withdrawn from her bag.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you are right," she agreed. "It is a wonderful
mouth&mdash;tender
  and yet provocative. I am not sure about my ears, though. You had better
  examine them."</p>

  <p>"You will drive me crazy presently," he warned her.</p>

  <p>"I'll yet you off my ears then for the time being. We will set Auguste's
  mind at rest and go and have our coffee. I see it at the other end of the
  deck."</p>

  <p>They resumed their deck chairs, and she leaned back happily.</p>

  <p>"Hamer, darling, I think it is wonderful to be engaged," she declared. "I
  always had a strange fancy for you, you know. The first time I ever saw you
  you were on deck wringing out your own bathing suit, and you seemed so
  capable...I wonder who that villainous-looking foreigner can be? He is still
  drifting about."</p>

  <p>"And interested in the boat," Hamer remarked with a frown. "Never takes
  his eyes off it."</p>

  <p>Chicotin, who was the solitary occupant of the dinghy, stared at them
  aggressively, as though he were aware of their criticism. Hamer rose to his
  feet and leaned over the side.</p>

  <p>"What do you want round here?" he demanded. "Are you looking for anyone on
  board?"</p>

  <p>Chicotin stared at him insolently.</p>

  <p>"I make small promenade," he said. "I not hurt your boat."</p>

  <p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

  <p>"My business," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"He's a horrible fellow," Hamer observed, turning round to his companion.
  "I don't, quite see what we can do, though. The sea is free to him as well as
  to us."</p>

  <p>She came to his side and took his arm, frowning slightly. The longer she
  looked at the intruder the deeper grew the disgust in her face. The man
  suddenly bent to his oars and moved off.</p>

  <p>"Hamer," she confided, "the most unpleasant idea has come to me."</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"You have had three mysterious offers to buy the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>.
  You are unwilling to sell. If these people wish to give so much more money
  than the boat is worth it must be for one of two reasons."</p>

  <p>"Go on, clever girl."</p>

  <p>"It must be because there is something terribly valuable concealed on
  board&mdash;jewels or something of that sort. Or something terribly
  incriminating&mdash;stolen papers or bonds. If it was that, Hamer, and they
  couldn't get hold of the boat, they might try to destroy it!"</p>

  <p>"What good would that do?" he demanded. "Stupid! They would get rid of
  something they were afraid of."</p>

  <p>He smiled incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Lucienne, my dear," he expostulated, "where on earth could anything be
  hidden upon the boat that I don't know about? I have no valuables or papers
  myself. My first visitor, too, pretty well ransacked the place. If there had
  been anything to be discovered I should think that the Princess would have
  had it."</p>

  <p>Lucienne shook her head. Nothing that he had said seemed to reassure
  her.</p>

  <p>"Do your two men sleep on board," she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," he told her. "In the galley there. Why?"</p>

  <p>"You don't keep a watch, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Never thought of it," he admitted. "I never heard of a burglary at
  sea."</p>

  <p>"Well, keep one to-night and the next few nights," she begged. "Just to
  please me."</p>

  <p>"All right," he promised. "I believe the men sleep on deck, anyway, this
  hot weather."</p>

  <p>"Have you a revolver?"</p>

  <p>"Did you ever know an American without one? I will keep it loaded at my
  bedside if you say the word."</p>

  <p>"Please do. And if there is any further attempt, or if any strangers visit
  you, will you promise to let me know?"</p>

  <p>"Faithfully."</p>

  <p>She drew a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Now I must really depart," she announced, with a glance at her wrist
  watch. "It has been a lovely morning, Hamer. Thank you so much."</p>

  <p>"Swimming back, or shall I take you in the dinghy?"</p>

  <p>She handed him her watch and adjusted her cap.</p>

  <p>"I'll swim," she decided. "If I want you to come to-night and send a note
  will it be all right?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come over in less than no time," he promised her.</p>

  <p>They crossed the deck. She drew off her peignoir and stood poised for a
  moment at the top of the steps&mdash;a slim, fairy-like figure, seductively
  feminine, notwithstanding the almost boyishly straight line.</p>

  <p>"Wait for my message," she called to him, as she turned round and trod
  water after her almost perfect dive.</p>

  <p>He waved his hand and stood watching her until she landed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">The girl slipped during the last few steps of her furious
dance in the
  roughly built <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i> at Garoupe, and would have fallen
  from the slightly raised platform into the scanty row of chairs below, but
  for the promptness of a man seated there alone, who rose swiftly to his feet
  and caught her in his arms. She lay there for a moment or two, panting, an
  epitome of abandon in her tumbled skirts, her mass of disarranged black hair,
  and the trembling of her passion-riven body. The man gazed down at her in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"It is without a doubt the little Tanya!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She raised her head, which had rested upon his shoulder, stared at him a
  moment, then sank into the cane chair by his side.</p>

  <p>"Paul Chicotin!" she cried. "It is thou, Paul, my little one."</p>

  <p>"Large enough to have saved you from a bad fall," he reminded her. "And
  you, what are you doing here, dancing like a crazy thing in a village
  barn?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, la la," she scoffed. "You will find fault with my performance next. I
  dance here because I choose. Remain where you are, little one. More must come
  of this."</p>

  <p>She stood up and bowed to the small audience, who were still applauding.
  Another performer&mdash;a man&mdash;came forward to do his gymnastic turn.
She caught
  Chicotin by the arm.</p>

  <p>"This is a meeting," she exclaimed. "It means much to me. I need not
  perform unless I choose. We are going to drink a glass of wine
  together&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>They left the scantily filled barn, crossed the road, and entered a
  caf&eacute;, rather a famous caf&eacute; in its way, with its table set
  against the stone wall, a precipice a few feet away. There was a screen of
  plane trees around the place. The lighting was almost negligible. She led the
  way to a table in the corner. He summoned a waiter from out of the shadows
  and ordered a bottle of champagne. She looked at him curiously from those
  marvellous black eyes of hers, which seemed to be flecked with gold.</p>

  <p>"Things march well with thee, then," she observed.</p>

  <p>"With those who know where to look for it, there is always money," he
  replied, boastfully.</p>

  <p>"You are still a worker for The Cause," she asked, dropping her voice.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Her face was almost ugly as she leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"You are a renegade," she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Bah, such folly!" he answered. '"Years ago I was a nihilist. I was also
  an anarchist. Later I joined the Communist party. Now I belong to no party. I
  am an egoist. I work for myself, and myself only. My genius is for those who
  choose to pay for it."</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>There was a world of meaning in the long drawn-out interjection. He rolled
  a cigarette and lit it. She watched his fingers and hands as though
  fascinated.</p>

  <p>"In one thing I am unchanged," he declared. "I hate the people who possess
  wealth while I have nothing, but it is not for vague causes or for the
  community or any society that I labour now. It is for Paul Chicotin."</p>

  <p>"Is it not that you serve the world best when you labour for the oppressed
  masses," she demanded, "when you work to destroy the capitalist and the
  aristocrat?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," he answered indifferently, "Only I do not care any longer
  for the masses. I work only for Paul Chicotin."</p>

  <p>She bit her upper lip thoughtfully. It was not until the wine was served
  that she relaxed.</p>

  <p>"To the sacred cause of the people," she said, raising her glass.</p>

  <p>"To Paul Chicotin and Tanya," he countered. "In the world I have lost
  touch with, little one, I have not lost my fondness for thee. There is a
  lover&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty," she assured him. "I give myself where the cause demands it. I am
  not like you. I have no self outside it."</p>

  <p>"If you give yourself to me," he suggested cunningly, "you might rekindle
  my enthusiasm."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she answered.</p>

  <p>He held her hand. They kissed in the darkness, yet she was guarded even in
  her love making.</p>

  <p>"What do you do here, Paul?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have completed a marvellous piece of work within the last few days," he
  confided, "work no other person in the world could have ventured upon. For it
  I have already received fifty thousand francs. In a day or two I am to
  receive a further hundred thousand."</p>

  <p>There was a covetous gleam in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Who is it that has such sums of money to spend and what is this work?"
  she demanded with apparent carelessness. "I remember you only as an indolent
  student who tampered with fine machinery and made clocks."</p>

  <p>"This," he admitted, "is a clock. It is a clock <i>de luxe</i>. It is a
  clock such as never before has been fashioned. It is the most amazing piece
  of machinery in the world."</p>

  <p>"Tell me some more," she begged.</p>

  <p>"There is no more to tell," he rejoined. "It is not as it was in the old
  days when we worked in a band. I work now for a single employer and I have no
  place in his counsels."</p>

  <p>"You have become a tool once more," she scoffed.</p>

  <p>"I have earned money," he replied, "but I have earned money for Paul
  Chicotin. I have a bank balance such as a man might be proud of. Before this
  week is over I shall add to it one hundred thousand francs. Think of that,
  Tanya! Only a man of genius could succeed in such a fashion."</p>

  <p>"I know more of the men of genius," she sighed, "who fail. Perhaps they
  fail because their aims are lofty, because they work only for those who
  suffer."</p>

  <p>"I am one of those who suffer and have suffered," he answered doggedly.
  "Now I work for myself...Tell me what you are doing here?"</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table, a familiar attitude, her elbows firmly
  planted, her oval face between her long, tapering fingers. She was sallow in
  complexion and her make-up was negligible. Her eyes, however, were brilliant
  and her full lips invitingly red. She was without doubt a Jewess.</p>

  <p>"Tell me first," she insisted, "for whom you perform these works. Who has
  bought that cunning brain of yours, Paul, and those marvellous fingers? In
  whose cause do you labour?"</p>

  <p>"The cause of Paul Chicotin," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"And who reaps the benefit of your brain?"</p>

  <p>"Paul Chicotin."</p>

  <p>"It is all you are disposed to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"It is as much as is good for you to know." She brooded over his response,
  smoking his cigarettes with fierce little gulps, drinking the wine
  greedily.</p>

  <p>"Often they have asked for you in The Circle, Paul," she confided.</p>

  <p>"The Circle for me does not exist any longer," he declared. "I am no
  longer a philanthropist. I shall soon be old. Life is only a matter of a few
  short years and then&mdash;gone&mdash;gone," he added with a snap of the
fingers. "The
  ash heap gets us in the end. I wheeze no more of suffering humanity. It is
  folly that the strong should work for the weak, the clever man for the fool.
  I work for Paul Chicotin. Mine is the one unassailable philosophy of the
  world. I rely on no one. I depend on no one. I use my genius for myself."</p>

  <p>She looked at him searchingly. She had the air of one seeking to penetrate
  into the man's mind, to learn what was there beneath the mere words. The
  fragmentary moonlight seemed to have changed her whole expression. She was no
  longer the Paris <i>gamine</i> dancing before a crude audience for unworthy
  applause. The hidden enthusiasm of a woman with a purpose in life had almost
  spiritualised her. She neglected her champagne. In that moment he was dimly
  aware of, although he viciously resented, the change in their relations.</p>

  <p>"So your genius now," she murmured, "goes not for The Cause, but to make
  life soft for Paul Chicotin."</p>

  <p>"It is ill put," he grunted, "but the meaning is the same."</p>

  <p>"I liked it better," she told him, "when, without a scruple you blew off
  the heads and legs of innocent people to reach the one guilty one."</p>

  <p>"And spent my days hungry, my nights in squalor, and every second in
  fear."</p>

  <p>"And now," she continued, "you work for a master. What is the task, Paul,
  mon petit? You work on a machine perhaps to drive a hundred toilers on to the
  streets because it will do their work, or are you the paid servant of an
  assassin?"</p>

  <p>"I work for Paul Chicotin," he repeated, doggedly. "That is why I can
  offer you champagne, a little flat at Juan or Nice, if you care to stay in
  these parts, and man, hours of the day and night in my company."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I was starving when I wandered over here from Marseilles," she confided.
  "In a sense you are right, I suppose. The Circle is in trouble. We have good
  leaders, but they have no power. All our efforts fade away in speeches
  forgotten as soon as they are made, for our audiences seem to have melted
  away. Never has there been such an opportunity as we possess at present, and
  we cannot use it. If we had the money now that we had in the old times, the
  money to bribe, to buy the secrets of our enemies, we would brush away this
  fog which hangs over our beloved country. We would set the guillotine
  flashing once more in the Place de la Republique. We would see the heads
  tumble of the men who are sucking; her life blood away."</p>

  <p>He looked uneasily around.</p>

  <p>"That sort of talk," he warned her, "would get you into trouble
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"The leaves of the plane trees would need to betray us then, dear Paul,"
  she pointed, out, "for there is no one else here, no one to listen to a poor
  little dancing girl whose heart aches for the suffering millions. We know who
  those men are who have betrayed her but they are far above our reach. We need
  a few men of courage like Paul Chicotin used to be."</p>

  <p>He caressed her fingers and she permitted his touch passively.</p>

  <p>"Paul Chicotin, the Killer for The Cause," he whispered, "is dead, but
  Paul Chicotin, the lover of Tanya, remains."</p>

  <p>"Passion is dead in my heart," she sighed. "The man who wakes it must be
  one of us. Tell me then, my friend, since you think so dearly of
me&mdash;for whom
  is it that you work?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I answer all your questions, Tanya," he complained. "I tell you
  everything. To me you are dumb. Why are you singing for sous when your place
  is at the <i>Folies Berg&egrave;res</i>? Are you down here for The
  Circle?"</p>

  <p>"The Circle has been driven out of Paris," she confided. "It is
  re-established secretly, oh, and with so much caution, in Marseilles. I have
  a mission here, but it is so hard to make progress&mdash;penniless and without
  friends."</p>

  <p>He drew from his pocket a <i>porte-monnaie</i> stuffed with notes and
  threw it on the table before her.</p>

  <p>"Never again call yourself penniless," he chided. "Chicotin is at least
  faithful to his loves. You have been my <i>bonne amie</i>, Tanya. You need
  money? It is yours."</p>

  <p>"I will take money," she told him, "only from my lover."</p>

  <p>"Can I not be he once more?" Chicotin pleaded.</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly, although there was promise in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You have been, dear Paul," she admitted, "and a wonderful lover, too. You
  might be again, but you would have to remember that the price of my love
  would be&mdash;not your <i>mille</i> notes, but your help."</p>

  <p>"But how can I help?" he demanded. "I have told you that Paul the Killer
  is dead. I work only for myself. I have no heart for any Cause. France,
  Italy, Russia&mdash;they are all one to me. Patriotism was once a religion
in my
  heart. I have outlived that. I am Chicotin the individual. I love life, I
  love wine, I love comfort, and I love luxury, and&mdash;I love you."</p>

  <p>"Prove it," she begged, clutching at his hand. "I am not asking you to
  become again The Killer, the scourge upon the earth, as the bourgeois Press
  once called you. Help me with a word or two of information."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>She rose casually enough to her feet and looked searchingly around the
  place. Satisfied as to their complete detachment she resumed her chair,
  folded her arms and leaned across the table towards him.</p>

  <p>"It has long been known, Paul," she said, "that France has been the
  carcase upon which a number of her so-called statesmen have fastened
  themselves&mdash;pilfering money, stealing it in huge sums, sucking her dry
with
  the help of such poor dupes as the man whom they shot at Geneva for fear he
  should breathe a word as to his accomplices. Those men are still alive. For
  all we know they are still engaged in the greatest orgy of robbery that the
  world has ever known. The aristocrats, whose heads filled the baskets at the
  time of the revolution, and whose blood ran down the gutters, were innocent
  babes compared to these men. They believed that they had the right to oppress
  the poor. They were blatant in their lives as they were in their deaths.
  These men whom we Communists hate so now call themselves of the people. They
  profess to rule France for the people. They call themselves honest citizens
  of the Republic. They sit in the high places. Their mistresses hung with
  Jewels roll in their Limousines and befoul the very atmosphere of our adored
  Paris. Listen Paul," she went on, clutching him fiercely by the shoulder. "If
  we were in a position to publish the truth all France would be on our side,
  revolution would sweep over the country like a devouring wind. There would
  come the Soviet of France, starting upon the heights, not having to tear its
  way upwards with bleeding fingers. France, the real France, would rule the
  world. Bear with me, Paul, a minute, I implore you."</p>

  <p>She drank wine, holding the glass to her lips with trembling fingers.</p>

  <p>"Calm yourself, my little Tanya," her companion begged. "This is good for
  the meetings. It is good when you are in company with the others, but
  remember&mdash;we seem to be alone, but one never knows. Calm yourself, my
child.
  I am here waiting to listen."</p>

  <p>"Well, listen, then," she went on a moment or so later. "I was with
  Berthold a few minutes before he died on the scaffold. There was a company of
  gendarmes there and a <i>commissaire</i> of police. They believed me to he
  his sister. Berthold's last speech was overheard by all these
people&mdash;also
  the priest&mdash;but he was clever. He knew what I was there for, and he
knew that
  a direct word from him to me, and a bullet from the revolver the chief of the
  gendarmes was holding would silence him before he could finish his sentence.
  He told me of a little money in his lodgings. 'Leave Paris alone,' he advised
  me. 'Get out of Marseilles. There is no future for you there. Find work at
  one of those pleasant places on the coast&mdash;Cannes, Juan, Nice. In the
  pleasure haunts of the world they will let you alone and you may forget.'
  Then the signal was given. Berthold's cigarette was placed between his lips,
  He passed through the door."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Chicotin asked a little breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Berthold told me with those dying words that the truth was to be found in
  these parts," she pointed out. "That is why I am here. Can you help me, my
  lover that used to be, my lover who might still hold me in his arms?"</p>

  <p>Paul Chicotin shivered although the night was warm, and the perfume of the
  flowering shrubs that, hung over the terrace was heavy and soothing.</p>

  <p>"Was the money in his room?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The money was there&mdash;a few hundred francs, barely more. There had
been a
  letter. It was gone. The place was swept bare. The police had seen to that.
  They knew very well what he was striving to tell me. They stood around in the
  room of execution to see that he carried the secret of what he had learnt
  with, him to the grave."</p>

  <p>Chicotin lit a fresh cigarette with shaking yellow-stained fingers.
  Already the stumps of a dozen were on the table.</p>

  <p>"The thing is probably a myth," he declared. "There is nothing to
  grasp&mdash;no starting point. What good can you do groping about this coast
  looking&mdash;for what? You don't know. Berthold should have had the courage
to
  shout one name, one hint. The bullet would have been a pleasanter death."</p>

  <p>"Berthold was wiser than you," she told him scornfully. "He knew that if
  he had spoken that definite word, if he had given me any hint which it was
  possible to follow, I should never have seen the sunlight again."</p>

  <p>Chicotin shivered once more. He was sure of himself but he was at heart a
  sentimentalist.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything to keep you here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she assured him. "I come to all these places on the chance.
  There are ten francs owing to me for the song and dance to-night. My room I
  pay for by the day. My clothes are only fit to be destroyed."</p>

  <p>They rose and he took her arm.</p>

  <p>"I have a small car," he said. "Shall it be Nice or Juan?"</p>

  <p>They passed out of the garden caf&eacute; into the shadow-hung street. She
  clung to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Where you wish&mdash;where you wish," she breathed so softly that the
words
  almost died away before they reached his ears. She clung to his arm, however.
  She followed his guidance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">Louise, arm in arm with Perissol, walked in the pine-hung
gardens of the
  villa, on the lighthouse hill, and breathed in happiness with the sunlight
  and the fragrant breeze.</p>

  <p>"My dear beloved," she murmured, as they paused for a moment to look down
  upon the bay, "if only this dark cloud could pass away. If only we could be
  happy here together, and feel that France was herself again."</p>

  <p>His stern face relaxed slightly for the moment, as he pressed her arm.</p>

  <p>"It is the uncertainty of it all that is so nerve racking," he declared.
  "Action I never fear. It may be ugly, it may be dangerous, but it is
  movement. Here we live in a state of suspended animation. I used to say that
  I feared nothing in life. To-day I am afraid of making a mistake. I might
  find myself at any moment in such a position that, if I were to do the right
  and honourable thing, men might point to me in days to come as having been
  the man who was responsible for the ruin of his country."</p>

  <p>"Some day or other," she told him, "you will have to come to a woman for
  advice."</p>

  <p>"I know very well what yours would be," he admitted, "but then, probably,
  even you do not grasp all the side issues."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"If I were to make the discovery which I am dimly beginning to apprehend,
  do you realise to whom I should have to make my report?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I imagine to the Chamber of Deputies."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I should have to make my report to the person who is
  responsible for my appointment, the man who, in the absence of the Premier,
  is the leader of the House Edouard Mermillon."</p>

  <p>"That gives you ideas?" He smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It gives me ideas as to why I received the unique appointment I
  hold."</p>

  <p>"Figure me now, beloved, as a living note of interrogation."</p>

  <p>He looked around. They were in the loneliest part of the grounds. Their
  solitude was absolute.</p>

  <p>"Edouard Mermillon is probably at the present moment the most brilliant
  politician France has possessed for years. I do not think that there is his
  equal for astuteness in Europe. He has confided to me his ideas as to what
  the foreign policy of France should be. To my mind they were inspired. If he
  is able to carry them out France will never have anything more to fear from
  Germany or any other foreign nation."</p>

  <p>"Marvellous," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"He knows very well that I did not seek office," Perissol continued. "He
  knows very well that I do not care for personal advancement or honours I seek
  only to serve my country with all my heart and soul. He throws down the gage
  to me and he smiles. If by any chance what one is driven dimly to suspect
  turned out to be true and he was found to be implicated in these recent
  horrible events, should I be the man, he asks himself, to expose him? He
  knows very well that I would rather shield him, because no one else in the
  world could carry out his marvellous policy and because without him France
  would at once drift into the hands of the Communists."</p>

  <p>Louise was more than a little startled. She betrayed it, perhaps, in her
  manner.</p>

  <p>"You see a long way," she ventured.</p>

  <p>"Further than my critics will allow," he said smiling. "But you, dear, I
  want you to understand the peculiar nature of the problem all this presents,
  even though fate should place in my hands the knowledge of the truth. How am
  I to use that knowledge? Picture me rising in the Chamber and denouncing the
  one man upon whom the safety of the country depends. Picture me alternately
  going to him privately and saying, 'Send in your portfolio and disappear or I
  disclose the truth.' In either case the wound to France would be mortal."</p>

  <p>"Then if you were a perfectly logical being," she decided, "you would join
  the malefactors."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I should," he admitted. "The only thing is that this is an
  illogical world and an illogical position. I must carve my own way out. The
  trouble is that the light comes slowly. See what would happen, Louise, if I
  did what I more than once felt inclined to do. I would not mind," he added,
  with a grim smile, "making a serious wager with you that if I were to go down
  to the '<i>Aigle Noir</i>' to-day and close myself in with Edouard Mermillon
  and the Baron de Brett and tell them all I know, tell them what I suspect but
  cannot prove, the Baron would light a cigar, Edouard Mermillon one of his
  precious cigarettes, and he would ask me with that wonderful smile of his and
  that gentle voice, 'What are you going to do about it, General?' I could not
  answer him."</p>

  <p>"I can understand what you say about Mermillon," she said, thoughtfully.
  "He has already created an entirely different atmosphere in two of the
  countries where we were becoming highly unpopular. He has just that mesmeric
  gift that the English Jew of the last century, Disraeli, is reputed to have
  had. But de Brett&mdash;I cannot follow you there."</p>

  <p>"De Brett, of course, personally counts for nothing," Perissol admitted,
  "but anything serious that happened to him would disorganise the whole
  banking world of Europe. Finance plays far too important a role in sound
  government nowadays. De Brett has been a good friend to France and we should
  be face to face with a terrible financial crisis if we impeached him and if
  he retaliated."</p>

  <p>"I am glad I am not a man," Louise exclaimed. "The study of all these
  possibilities is almost maddening."</p>

  <p>"I share your thankfulness, dearest," he assured her tenderly. "If I
  hadn't a companion with a plastic mind like yours to come to these days life
  would be utterly unendurable. I seem to have turned into a sort of
  super-detective since I took up my new office. I see before me the promised
  land of accomplishment but my heart and judgment fail me."</p>

  <p>Perissol and his companion continued their walk through the woods. In
  sheltered places the perfume of the pines, sweet and aromatic, was almost
  overpowering. There were barer spots, however, where the east wind, warmed by
  the tropical sun, was like a breath of Paradise. She clung to his arm
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"If this were my last word to you I would say it," she declared. "At all
  costs preserve your confidence in yourself. Others have said it&mdash;not I
  alone&mdash;that the time must come when one man will save France. You will be
  that man. You have the will, you have the power, you have just that touch of
  genius which is necessary. Other countries have yielded to the inspiration of
  one-man government. France has nothing to lose by following suit."</p>

  <p>"I lack one quality," he told her a little sadly, "amongst many others, of
  course. I fear that I lack ambition."</p>

  <p>"But think of the wonder of it," she urged. "If one could revive France
  and live. Our country is too beautiful to be brought to the threshold of ruin
  by all these plots and counter plots."</p>

  <p>"The plots and counter plots," he reminded her, "are all the result of the
  evil underneath. It is this eager desire to enjoy, this foolish passion for
  luxury, which has created the fantastic hankering after wealth even in the
  minds of some of our finest citizens. That honest bourgeois class that Balzac
  taught us to appreciate, who were content with a simple house and a simple
  life, seems to have passed out of existence."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Louise sighed, "my sex is largely to blame. It is the women
  who goad men on, always wanting more and more money nowadays."</p>

  <p>"French women were always extravagant," he agreed, "but in my younger days
  their menkind were strong enough to keep them within bounds. To-day the world
  is suffering&mdash;Paris goes on spending. Neither the conscience nor the
will of
  man is strong enough to bear the strain. Communism," he wound up, "Is an
  infernal creed, but if ever the time existed or could exist which might seem
  to justify some of its principles it is to-day."</p>

  <p>"Communism! Horrible!" she shivered.</p>

  <p>"There is something good in every creed if it be honest," he declared.
  "All the same, the triumph of Communism in France to-day would mean her ruin.
  Listen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There were footsteps to be heard through the undergrowth. Raymond appeared
  suddenly before them. He had descended the slope by one of the narrow paths
  which intersected the broader avenues, and he was a little breathless.</p>

  <p>"Mon General," he announced. "The Chef de la Surete of Marseilles is
  anxious to speak to you."</p>

  <p>"On the telephone?"</p>

  <p>"No, monsieur. He came to Cannes by 'plane, and has motored over here. He
  would like to return in half an hour, if possible."</p>

  <p>"I will mount to the house at once. You will excuse?" he added, turning to
  Louise. "Come yourself, I beg of you, by the easier way. I am interested to
  hear what Monsieur Boyer has to say."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand in farewell and climbed the steep hillside with giant
  strides, leaving his secretary breathless far in the rear. In less than ten
  minutes he was on the terrace where a stiff-looking little man with military
  bearing, black moustache and imperial, in strictly conventional clothes, was
  awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"Mon General," he said, saluting. Perissol took him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come into my study," he invited. "We shall be quite alone. You can
  disclose your news there."</p>

  <p>Boyer was a man renowned, in the circles amongst which he moved, for his
  precise manner of dress, of speech, and of deportment. On this occasion,
  however, it was easy to see that he was suffering from some sort of shock. He
  found it difficult to remain seated quietly in the chair which his host had
  designated.</p>

  <p>"My chief," he began, "you will understand that I am in a state of some
  disturbance. Early this morning I found occasion to dismiss from the service
  of the country two members of the detective staff of my bureau, two men who
  have held for many years important positions connected with the Port of
  Marseilles."</p>

  <p>General Perissol stiffened into sudden attention. He glanced towards the
  door to be sure that it was closed and out on to the terrace, which was
  entirely deserted.</p>

  <p>"You have further news concerning the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>?" he asked,
  as he stepped back again.</p>

  <p>"News which should have been yours twenty-four hours after the first
  inquiry you put in, General," was the regretful reply. "Amongst my faults the
  worst, perhaps, is that I am too much inclined to trust my subordinates.
  Figure to yourself, General, for twenty years these two men have served me
  and served the State. They have been heavily bribed&mdash;even now I am not
sure
  by whom&mdash;but that may transpire. For the moment they remain in the
cells. The
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> was built to the order and instructions of a man who
  gave the name of Dupont. It was in his possession for one month, and, from
  the information I possess, I have no doubt whatever that the man Dupont was
  no other than the man whose name is forbidden in France&mdash;the man who
was shot
  at Geneva."</p>

  <p>"He sailed the boat?" the General demanded.</p>

  <p>"For one month. He cruised about Toulon, Bandol, and as far as Sainte
  Maxime. Either his wife or some other woman was on board with him."</p>

  <p>"You have the plans of the boat?"</p>

  <p>"General, the story of my humiliation continues. The plans have been
  stolen&mdash;when or how no one in the bureau has the slightest idea. These
two
  miscreants who lie in the cells are of course responsible."</p>

  <p>"The ship's builders?"</p>

  <p>"Partrout et Fils&mdash;a well-known firm&mdash;but every single man
employed was an
  Englishman. They seem to have come over for the sole purpose of building the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. Afterwards they returned home again and it is
  curious that in no single case have I been able to discover one who left an
  address. My subordinate has already telephoned to London. We shall, of
  course, in time, trace down one or two of them."</p>

  <p>"Was the present purchase of the boat a genuine one?" the General
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Of that, I think, there seems to be no reasonable doubt," was the eager
  reply. "The young man's name as on the charter has been confirmed. It is, as
  he had announced, Hamer Wildburn. He is an American and a contributor to the
  Paris edition of an American newspaper. His record is perfectly clean and the
  purchase seems to have been an ordinary legitimate one. It took place through
  an agent, who has since given up business, and it appears that the price paid
  was in the neighbourhood of sixteen hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"This is all the information you have been able to collect?"</p>

  <p>"For the moment, General, I regret that it is all."</p>

  <p>Perissol paced the room thoughtfully for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Boyer," he said. "We are always, to a certain extent, at the
  mercy of our subordinates, and fifteen to twenty years is a long period of
  service. When, however, false reports are accompanied by the theft of the
  plans of a suspected boat the matter presents itself in a serious light."</p>

  <p>"Mon General," Boyer pleaded. "I offer no excuse. I have a wife and
  family. I have been in the service for forty years. Some of the most
  dangerous of the felons that haunted Marseilles have been brought to the
  scaffold in my time. It was I, with a revolver in my hand, who took
  Berthold."</p>

  <p>"That is all to the good," the General admitted. "The arrest of Berthold
  and his execution was good work. It is not my custom to act harshly. It would
  influence my opinion very much if during the next week the plans of the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> were discovered."</p>

  <p>"Everything that is humanly possible shall be done," Boyer promised.
  "There is another matter, General, concerning which I should like to speak.
  It is not directly connected with the affair of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>,
  but it might turn out to be of some consequence.</p>

  <p>"Proceed," his chief invited.</p>

  <p>"The little friend and mistress of Berthold, the anarchist, who passed as
  his sister, and who was with him during his last few minutes, bears the name
  of Tanya Vizille. His last words bequeathed to her some money in his rooms,
  and recommended her to come to these parts. The recommendation may have had
  no significance, but one wonders. The money was less than three hundred
  francs, but the girl is living in a luxurious flat at Juan, dancing at nights
  and spending money freely. She has been the companion of Communists and
  anarchists all her days, and is herself suspected of being a member of what
  they call The Circle. She is associated at the present moment with a man
  named Chicotin, a Russian, who is now employed by Edouard Mermillon, the
  Cabinet Minister, on his yacht. He is supposed to be a sort of
  super-engineer, but he is under strong suspicion of having been at various
  times in his career a manufacturer of&mdash;bombs."</p>

  <p>"I should continue to have the young woman watched," the General advised.
  "At present, I can connect her in no way with our immediate anxieties, but
  one cannot tell. Now permit me to offer you some refreshment, Monsieur
  Boyer."</p>

  <p>"A glass of wine in haste, with pleasure," the other accepted. "My great
  anxiety now is to return. I am expecting a report on the matter of the
  missing plans of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> this evening."</p>

  <p>"Compose yourself, my dear Boyer," his chief begged, after the wine had
  been served. "The more I think of this affair the less I am inclined to blame
  you. You may be sure that it would not be a light thing that would cause me
  to exercise extreme measures in the case of such an official as you, with
  such a period of long service behind him."</p>

  <p>"Your words inspire me with the deepest gratitude, my General," the other
  said fervently.</p>

  <p>"Tell me now," Perissol went on. "I shall not detain you, I understand
  your haste. But in a few words&mdash;how do you find things in Marseilles?
We have
  our own great and special anxieties in Paris just now, I can assure you, but
  Marseilles is often in our thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Marseilles, until the coming of the millennium or the day of doom," Boyer
  declared, "will be one of the hotbeds of crime in France. There is one thing
  to be borne in mind, however. Political crime does not flourish to the same
  extent as personal vice and lawlessness. We have to deal chiefly with subtle
  and daring acts of robbery and violence by bands of criminals associated only
  for the purpose of gain. There are many places in France to-day of little
  note where Communism and even anarchy flourish more than with us. Berthold
  was an exception. His fate has terrified many."</p>

  <p>Boyer rose to his feet and the General saw him to his car.</p>

  <p>"I wish you a successful flight home, and have no anxieties," were the
  latter's last words. "Solve the mystery of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> for me
  and there shall be something for your buttonhole."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Chicotin, a little sulky, obeyed his employer's unexpected
summons a few
  mornings later, and presented himself in the latter's suite just before noon.
  He was wearing a mauve silk shirt, which came from a Paris <i>chemisier</i>,
  blue trousers from St. Tropez, and blue espadrilles, with a red handkerchief
  knotted around his neck. The whole effect was exceedingly chic according to
  the summer fashions of the moment. His master looked at him from head to foot
  with a faint smile of amusement upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"Very nice, indeed, Chicotin," he observed. "The costume of Juan-les-Pins,
  without a doubt."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur did not send for me to discuss my clothes, I presume," the man
  rejoined sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. They happen to amuse me, that's all. I sent for you,
  Chicotin, to inquire as to why you are neglecting your duties."</p>

  <p>"Duties? My task is finished."</p>

  <p>"The first part of it only."</p>

  <p>Chicotin pointed through the portholes.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur would not desire that I committed suicide by venturing on board
  the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> with those searchlights playing? It would end the
  whole affair."</p>

  <p>"You await, then, the withdrawal of the gunboat?"</p>

  <p>"But naturally. The withdrawal of the gunboat or the cessation of the
  searchlights."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime you inhabit a flat in Juan-les-Pins with your
  mistress, regardless of the fact that you have been allotted quarters on
  board here and that you are being paid a handsome salary for acting as my
  consulting engineer."</p>

  <p>"The title is a sinecure," Chicotin pointed out. "There is nothing to be
  done to engines that are stationary."</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," Mermillon replied. "I require you to remain on duty.
  What else do I pay you for?"</p>

  <p>"I am not an eight-hour mechanic or a slave," Chicotin protested. "I am
  willing to carry out my contract when there is anything to be done. When
  there is not why should I stay and gaze at dumb machinery in an atmosphere
  entirely disagreeable to me? You have divined rightly. My mistress is at
  Juan-les-Pins. I prefer to be there with her."</p>

  <p>"That is very interesting," Mermillon observed tonelessly, "but I have
  sent for you to say that in future you will report each morning for orders
  and again at 6 o'clock in the evening."</p>

  <p>Chicotin's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"There can be no orders to give under the present conditions," he
  grumbled. "If Monsieur wishes to hasten the finish of this business he would
  have that gunboat removed."</p>

  <p>"No one but a fool like you could have made such a suggestion," was the
  caustic reply. "One lives nowadays in a glasshouse of publicity. If the
  gunboat were sent away at my request, and things were to happen on board the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> directly afterwards, the situation, so far as I was
  concerned, might easily become embarrassing."</p>

  <p>Chicotin's face was dark with anger.</p>

  <p>"It is not fair that my efforts should be hampered in such a fashion," he
  insisted. "I have carried out my contract. I have produced an even more
  wonderful machine than I promised. It is no fault of mine that conditions
  prevent its being used. Unless you can smooth the way to bring this business
  to an end, I think that you should make me a further advance on account of
  the hundred thousand."</p>

  <p>"There will be no more money until the affair is concluded," Mermillon
  warned him. "That event would find me without a doubt in a generous frame of
  mind. What have you done with the fifty thousand francs?"</p>

  <p>"I had debts," the man admitted. "Then&mdash;since you seem to know
it&mdash;it is
  nothing to be ashamed of&mdash;I have a little friend in Juan who sends the
  <i>mille</i> notes spinning. It is not given to all men to live like
  hermits."</p>

  <p>"Your manner of life does not interest me," Mermillon assured him. "There
  will be no more money until the deed is accomplished, and until then you will
  report at 10 o'clock every morning and 6 every evening. On the other hand, on
  the day when your coup is successfully dealt your extra bonus will be raised
  to a hundred and fifty thousand francs."</p>

  <p>Chicotin's eyes shone with desire. One hundred and fifty thousand francs!
  What could not be done with such a sum? Tanya could have the bracelet she
  coveted, and a few thousand francs for The Cause, if it made her happy. He
  himself could play roulette like a prince. What he would win! He moistened
  his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"I could, perhaps, arrange so .that the attachments on board were
  unnecessary," he muttered. "It could be done with a few hours' work. All that
  I would have to do in that case would be to accelerate the time fuse and
  leave the despatch box into which I have fitted it on board. Getting away
  would still be a risk."</p>

  <p>"One hundred and fifty thousand francs is worth a risk," his employer told
  him coolly.</p>

  <p>"I shall need to visit the chemist's," Chicotin announced. "I must go
  there at once. At six o'clock I will return. I shall work all night. During
  the early morning I may devise a scheme for getting on board."</p>

  <p>"Very good," Mermillon agreed.</p>

  <p>Chicotin drew a piece of paper from his pocket and wrote a name and
  address. He passed it to his employer.</p>

  <p>"If I succeed for you, but disappear myself into atoms, which is clearly
  possible, I desire that you will pay the money to my friend."</p>

  <p>"It is a reasonable request."</p>

  <p>"I have Monsieur's permission to depart then?"</p>

  <p>"Under the present circumstances the sooner the better."</p>

  <p>From their chairs under the awning, which covered most of the deck of the
  <i>Aigle Noir</i>, de Brett and his host watched Chicotin step into the
  little dinghy and push off towards the shore.</p>

  <p>"Our friend inspires me with a theme for a brief essay," Mermillon
  remarked. "It is a strange thing how many famous criminals have delighted in
  exotic and luxurious attire. These American gangsters, for instance, the list
  of their wardrobes, silk shirts, and silk underclothes, filled whole columns
  of the newspapers a year or so ago. One very notorious bootlegger gunman is
  said to have found his way into what is known as New York society, and to
  have become a recognised arbiter in the knowledge of clothes and of luxury
  appurtenances. Our Chicotin has gone out to-day to conquer like a tropical
  bird of brilliant plumage. To-night he will work for hours in a suit of
  overalls, with death waiting for him round the corner if he makes a single
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Very likely for us, too," de Brett grumbled. "Lily has invited me to
  dinner. The Marquis has been called suddenly to Paris. I think I shall accept
  her invitation."</p>

  <p>"Do, my dear fellow, by all means," Mermillon agreed. "I am afraid I have
  been rather a dull host," he apologised, "although there have been many
  matters of business which we have profitably discussed."</p>

  <p>"We could have discussed them equally well in Paris or Brussels." the
  Baron pointed out, "and I confess that I am tired of the quiet life. Your
  society, my dear Edouard, is always wonderful, and I must admit that the
  sight of that infernal little schooner yacht fascinates me. Still, I shall
  tear myself away before long."</p>

  <p>"You will go to Paris?"</p>

  <p>De Brett shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"To Brussels, I fancy, until this matter is finally settled. I shall be at
  the end of the telephone there. I shall hear quickly of your success or of
  disaster."</p>

  <p>There was a subtle significance in the faint twitching of Mermillon's
  lips, which scarcely amounted to a smile.</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate, my dear Albert," he said, "to be a citizen of two
  countries, and a native of only one. Brussels will always provide an asylum
  for you."</p>

  <p>The Baron permitted himself a little gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" he exclaimed. "For men like you and me no asylum will ever be
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"If the world knows what is good for it, you are right, my friend," his
  companion assented. "But sometimes men&mdash;even nations&mdash;achieve
insanity...Ah,
  now approaches one of the enjoyable moments of the day. Here is something
  worth talking about. I have finished with my despatches. One of them,
  by-the-by, to our friend over in London, is I think a masterpiece. I have
  worked Chicotin into a reasonable frame of mind. In half an hour's time there
  will be luncheon and at this moment cocktails are arriving."</p>

  <p>"And so," de Brett remarked, looking over across the narrow strip of sea
  between the <i>Aigle Noir</i> and the gunboat, "is a visitor."</p>

  <p>"Our friend, the commander, paying his return visit," Mermillon observed.
  "I begged him to come in the morning, to be sure of finding us at home.
  <i>Matelot</i>, <i>l'&eacute;chelle</i>!"</p>

  <p>The two men strolled over to the rail to greet their guest. The latter
  saluted them respectfully. These were very great men whom he had the honour
  of visiting.</p>

  <p>"Delighted to see you, Commander," Mermillon said, as they shook hands.
  "You are in time to join us in our pre-luncheon cocktail. Perhaps you will
  give us the pleasure of your company at <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry," the visitor regretted, "My first officer is away for the day. An
  aperitif I will accept with pleasure."</p>

  <p>The three men sat down, and, after a few minutes' general conversation,
  Mermillon made tactful reference to the work upon which the gunboat was
  supposed to be engaged.</p>

  <p>"I am not a naval man, Commander, I must admit," he said, "but the nature
  of your operations here has been somewhat of a surprise to me."</p>

  <p>"If one may go so far as to admit the fact," the officer replied, "they
  have been equally a surprise to me. We continue the work according to
  instructions. I took the precaution of having them confirmed from
  Toulon."</p>

  <p>"Your men appear to me," the Baron observed, "remarkably well disciplined.
  They make little disturbance. The presence of a ship of war, however, in a
  tiny pleasure bay like this is naturally a trifle disconcerting. My
  distinguished friend here, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has been engaged
  for some time upon a scheme to be submitted to the Counsel of Europe, the
  object of which is to secure peace for the world. Those rakish-looking guns
  of yours only a few hundred yards away must, I fancy, be disconcerting."</p>

  <p>The commander smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"You will understand," he said, "that I cannot discuss my mission here in
  a general way, but there is no harm in confiding to you my personal
  impression. I cannot help believing that I was simply sent here because of
  the presence of a French Minister of great distinction and a banker of
  international fame."</p>

  <p>"Someone in that case would seem to have been a trifle officious,"
  Mermillon reflected.</p>

  <p>"If I may continue to speak entirely personally," the commander went on,
  "I am not at all sure that my presence here, from the point of view I have
  just suggested, is not a wise dispensation. Marseilles and Toulon are both
  dangerous centres of Communism in these days. Le Prefet of Toulon, who
  visited the Admiral not long ago, has many anxieties. Deeds of violence in
  the city occur with lamentable frequency, and I fear that the next 10 years
  will witness many of them. In a beautiful holiday centre such as this it
  would be ruinous and most distressing to the inhabitants to have tragedy, as
  it were, thrust down their throats. A few extra precautions are worth taking.
  At the same time, Monsieur le Ministre," the officer added, rising to his
  feet and turning respectfully to his distinguished host, "if there is
  anything in the conduct of our operations which can be altered to suit your
  convenience, I should only be too glad to consent to it, so long as it does
  not clash with my instructions."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, sir," the latter acknowledged. "Your name, I think you
  said, was Berard?"</p>

  <p>The young man bowed. Mermillon rose to his feet and laid his hand upon his
  shoulder as they walked together towards the gangway.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he suggested, "if you could arrange to discontinue those
  searchlights, say after 3 o'clock, it would be a blessing. I am here for a
  vacation, it is true, but I have messengers from Paris every day and
  sometimes I am working with them until long after midnight. My best hours for
  sleep are from 3 o'clock until eight."</p>

  <p>The commander saluted.</p>

  <p>"I will give orders for the searchlights to cease an hour earlier, that is
  at 3 o'clock," he promised. "If at any future time I can be of service,
  Monsieur, I am at your disposition."</p>

  <p>"I shall not forget your courtesy, sir," Mermillon assured him.</p>

  <p>The Baron was helping himself to another cocktail when his host resumed
  his seat.</p>

  <p>"You see, I have solved Chicotin's difficulty," the latter remarked. "It
  was an idea, I think."</p>

  <p>The Baron lit a cigar and smoked thoughtfully for several moments.</p>

  <p>"An idea, beyond a doubt," he admitted. "Yet one has to consider this. If
  anything curious were to happen between the hours of 3 and 4 o'clock and our
  young friend was court-martialled he would naturally disclose the fact that
  it was at our request that he discontinued those searchlights."</p>

  <p>Mermillon smiled.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear Albert," he said. "I think that fortune is with us because
  the small things march our way. I happen to know through your friend, the
  Marquise, that the young American, Hamer Wildburn, was the first to protest
  against the searchlights. I have exchanged courtesies with the young man. It
  would be natural for me to use my influence to help him in the matter. You
  will excuse me, Baron? I go to have a word with Chicotin. He will be a happy
  man. He is now a step nearer the fortune at which he aims."</p>

  <p>Chicotin and Tanya dined late that evening in the garden of the
  Proven&ccedil;al Hotel. They had chosen one of the small tables, half hidden
  amongst the trees. Chicotin was an ardent lover, and he liked the
  surreptitious caresses impossible in a crowded room. It was 11 o'clock when
  they sat down for dinner, but what an evening it had been! They had gambled a
  little at the Casino and won. They had drunk cocktails there, crossed the
  road, and danced at Maxim's. Cocktails there, and so on to the
  Proven&ccedil;al Bar, where they spent a pleasant hour. Then back to Tanya's
  room, where two new frocks from Cannes had just arrived, and must be tried on
  with the aid of Chicotin, who always declared that if he had not been a
  miraculous machinist he would have been a ladies' dressmaker. He dared even
  to put the finishing touches and criticise the creations of one of the most
  famous dressmakers in the world. Each gown awoke in him fresh transports.
  Tanya at last escaped.</p>

  <p>"You are terrible to-night, my dear Paul," she cried. "Remember that the
  night is young."</p>

  <p>His expression suddenly changed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the night is young," he agreed. "At 3 o'clock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stood rigidly in front of her mirror.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she Queried</p>

  <p>"At 3 o'clock I shall be gay still, but not with you, dear one."</p>

  <p>She half turned her head.</p>

  <p>"With another woman, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"With no other woman."</p>

  <p>"I should think not, indeed," she murmured, coming across the room towards
  him, her arms outstretched, that terribly seductive look in her eyes. "At 3
  o'clock, what?" she went on, her right arm around his neck, the fingers of
  her left hand caressing his cheek. "Tell me, my lover, what is it that you do
  at 3 o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"A trifling commission," he confided. "Something to be done by Paul
  Chicotin that he may pay for more frocks for Tanya, more of the <i>jetons</i>
  one flings upon the board, more of the glorious sunshine of life."</p>

  <p>"Three o'clock," she repeated wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, forget that," he enjoined, "or if you will speak of it again
  remember this it is an affair of two hundred thousand francs."</p>

  <p>"Paul!" she remonstrated, patting his cheek once more. "There is no man in
  the world clever enough to earn two hundred thousand francs at 3 o'clock in
  the morning."</p>

  <p>He suddenly realised the hour, the number of cocktails he had drunk, his
  companion with her blind enthusiasms.</p>

  <p>"I talk no more," he insisted. "I am fatigued with hunger. I have spoken
  for our little table under the trees at the Proven&ccedil;al. You will wear
  the robe cerise. I will arrange that scarf. Then at half-past two, I leave
  you for an hour, and at half-past three, when Juan sleeps, will be our next
  hour of love."</p>

  <p>She pinched his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I am your slave, little one," she submitted. "Come and choose what
  remains of my toilette."</p>

  <p>So that was how they came to dine under the trees at the Proven&ccedil;al
  and Tanya was seductive and amorous in turn, as he liked her best. When the
  lights went out and the waiters began to linger around impatiently they
  crossed the way to Maxim's, where they danced under the trees and found a
  seat once more in the background. Chicotin glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"It is <i>triste</i> here this evening," he declared. "We are the only two
  who seem to have gaiety in our hearts and the flavour of living upon our
  lips. There is an hour before I start."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"We go home then&mdash;yes?" she invited. "You may rest there if you
will. The
  car is outside my door. You can start from there."</p>

  <p>They walked through the maze of pavement cafes with their dance gardens
  and small restaurants. His fingers trembled as they turned the key of Tanya's
  door. They mounted to the first floor. With a little laugh she threw herself
  upon the couch.</p>

  <p>"Give me a drink, dear lover," she cried. "There is everything there on
  the side&mdash;champagne even. Open a bottle and have a drink to your
enterprise.
  Sit here. I will spare you just that much room," she went on, making a little
  circle in the air. "We will talk together and I will pronounce a benediction
  upon your enterprise. You are going to rob someone, perhaps? A brave deed. It
  is for you people with brains to take their possessions away from the
  plutocrats. I love a daring thief. Paul. I love you."</p>

  <p>The fingers which tore away the wires of the champagne bottle trembled.
  Paul Chicotin was treading on air. Even to himself he was great. A man with a
  brave enterprise before him&mdash;an enterprise which was to save or destroy a
  country. He poured out the wine, drained a glassful, and took another over to
  her. Passion flamed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Drink," he begged. "Drink quickly."</p>

  <p>She drew him down on to the side of the couch.</p>

  <p>"Paul," she whispered, "I shall remain here counting the seconds while you
  are away. I pray for you. Tell me what it is that you do. What is it that you
  carry about in that despatch box which you look at so anxiously?"</p>

  <p>She drank half the contents of the glass, then she placed it to his lips.
  He drained the remainder greedily.</p>

  <p>"I do what it is not within the power of any other man in the world to
  accomplish," he confided. "I save France from revolution, I spread to the
  winds of heaven written words which might have brought her to the threshold
  of ruin. Two hundred thousand francs is little enough to pay. It is my brain
  which has done this. It is your lips and your arms which will reward."</p>

  <p>He drew her to him and she easily yielded to his embrace&mdash;one arm
around
  his neck, the other, however, still free.</p>

  <p>"Paul," she murmured, "what is it then you do?"</p>

  <p>"The last record," he cried. "At three o'clock it will be back amongst the
  atoms of the universe&mdash;gone for all time, Tanya!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden pain in his back. The eyes that a moment before had
  seemed luminous with love were glaring at him. He was drunk! He was sure he
  must be drunk. But the pain. His head was swimming. He fell back. Tanya
  slipped from his arms. He lay on the floor and he felt the slow ebbing away
  of life.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">At the sound of the stroke of the hour of three, a metallic
yet somehow
  significant chime, from the chapel hidden in the lighthouse woods. Mermillon
  rose slowly to his feet and leaned over the side of the boat. The Baron, in
  his pyjamas and dressing-gown, had already taken his place there. The seconds
  passed without a word between the two men. The commander of the French
  gunboat was evidently qualifying for promotion. The play of the searchlights
  had ceased some five minutes before. Black darkness enveloped the small bay.
  The long slanting beam from the Antibes lighthouse passed over the top of the
  woods, searched the far seas, but it did nothing to illumine the sombre
  obscurity below. Mermillon drew a little nearer to his companion. A very rare
  emotion trembled in his voice.</p>

  <p>"If Chicotin succeeds," he said, "It will be within the next five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"A long time to wait," the Baron growled. Mermillon leaned speechless over
  the side. His face had lost its calm satirical expression, and he was like a
  man stretched upon the rack. He stood slightly turned away so that not even
  his companion could see the agony through which he was passing. Neither of
  the two men seemed to be able to preserve the sense of time, but when the
  quarter chimed from the chapel in the woods, though even the seconds had
  seemed intolerably long, Mermillon gave vent to a groan of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Chicotin has failed," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Name of heaven, what was that?" the Baron exclaimed with a start.</p>

  <p>Whatever the sound denoted, it came, alas, from the far distance. A low
  rumbling first, as though of thunder, then a crash, an opening of the black
  skies over westward as though to let out a flood of summer lightning. Then
  silence&mdash;darkness and silence more profound than ever.</p>

  <p>The commander of the gunboat heard it, sprang from his bunk, and hurried
  up on deck also to gaze around at nothing. Perissol heard it and leaned over
  from his balcony, straining his eyes and striving to penetrate the darkness
  of the near horizon. Tanya, who had been dealing a hand in Juan Casino, heard
  it a great deal more distinctly, and almost dropped the cards from her
  bejewelled fingers. The little company of eight seated at the table stared at
  one another without any inclination to move. Tanya, whose bank now amounted
  to a good many <i>mille</i>, and who had just had <i>banco</i> called against
  her, was the first to recover herself. Perhaps because she understood. She
  showed no sign of the relief which had set her wicked little heart dancing
  with joy.</p>

  <p>"Whatever has happened," she exclaimed, "it is not for our harm. Let us
  finish the hand."</p>

  <p>She gave the card which had been demanded&mdash;ten&mdash;and
triumphantly, with her
  amazing finger nails, pointed to the six which she had already shown upon the
  table. The man who had gone <i>banco</i>, with a shrug of the shoulders,
  opened his pocket book and counted out the money. Tanya leaned back in her
  chair humming a little tune. Poor Chicotin! His boasts, then, had not been
  idle ones.</p>

  <p>"<i>Un banco de quatorze mille</i>," the <i>croupier</i> announced.</p>

  <p>This time no one paid any attention. The little company had recovered from
  then stupor and everyone except Tanya had rushed to the doors.</p>

  <p>"<i>La main passe</i>," Tanya declared, stretching out her hand and
  clutching her winnings. Everything had happened according to plan.</p>

  <p>The Baron was a few minutes late in the morning for his <i>petit
  dejeuner</i>, which he made a rule of sharing with his host in a pleasant
  corner of the deck. He found Mermillon with the <i>Eclaireur</i> gripped in
  his hand. He had evidently just finished reading something of interest.</p>

  <p>"<i>Eh bien, mon ami</i>?" de Brett exclaimed inquiringly.</p>

  <p>Mermillon laid down his paper.</p>

  <p>"It is the old story," he confided. "God and men make plans and women
  destroy them. I knew that vain little fool of a Chicotin was playing the Don
  Juan. I ought to have confined him to the ship until his work was done."</p>

  <p>"What then has happened?" the Baron demanded.</p>

  <p>"One has to guess. We, I think, can gill in the blanks better than anyone.
  A block of flats newly built in Juan-les-Pins, only one of which was
  occupied, has been blown to pieces&mdash;wrecked completely and absolutely
soon
  after 3 o'clock this morning. The owner of the flat was playing
  <i>chemin-de-fer</i> at the Casino. All that this journal professes to know
  about her is that she came from Marseilles and that she had a
  lover&mdash;apparently wealthy&mdash;who was with her earlier in the
evening. According
  to this paper the two dined at the Proven&ccedil;al Hotel and were seen soon
  after midnight to enter the flat&mdash;the man carrying a small despatch
case. The
  girl, however, took her accustomed place at her favourite
  <i>chemin-de-fer</i> table at the Casino shortly after 2. At a quarter-past 3
  came the explosion."</p>

  <p>"Did we not hear it?" the Baron muttered. "The adjectives used by these
  French journalists in trying to describe its effect," Mermillon continued,
  stirring his coffee, "suggest that Chicotin told us the truth. The flat and
  its contents have gone up into thin air. There is not even an indication as
  to whether any human being was in the building. Not an article of furniture
  or clothing of any description remains. It stood, fortunately, upon an empty
  space, but every window in the neighbourhood was shattered and several small
  buildings forty yards away were wrecked. A small saloon car standing at the
  entrance was scattered in morsels of metal and upholstery right across the
  road. <i>Enfin, mon cher Baron</i>, we have lost our dear Chicotin."</p>

  <p>The Baron plucked up his spirits.</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances, I think," he remarked cheerfully, as he buttered
  himself a piece of toast, "it is perhaps the best thing that could have
  happened. Alive, whether successful or unsuccessful, he would have been a
  terrible nuisance."</p>

  <p>Mermillon sighed as he glanced to where the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> was
  swaying gracefully at her moorings.</p>

  <p>"It is now my turn," de Brett went on, "to disclose some news. In a few
  weeks' time the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> will have changed hands."</p>

  <p>Mermillon's eyebrows were faintly uplifted. His guest continued.</p>

  <p>"There has been, as you may be aware, something in the nature of a
  flirtation between Hamer Wildburn, the owner of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>,
  and Mademoiselle Lucienne de Montelimar I dined last night, as you know, at
  the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. Madame took me into her confidence. A marriage, it
  seems, is on the <i>tapis</i> between the two young people."</p>

  <p>"This sounds interesting," Mermillon observed.</p>

  <p>"It becomes more and more so," de Brett proceeded "As I have already told
  you, I have intimated to the Marquise our desire to acquire the boat. She has
  used all her influence with her daughter and the young man has promised
  Lucienne that she shall have it for a wedding gift."</p>

  <p>Mermillon leaned back from the table and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"How does that strike you, Baron?" he asked. "The <i>Bird of Paradise</i>
  in the hands of the girl, eh? It doesn't strike me that our position will be
  greatly improved. He will probably make it a condition that she does not
  dispose of it."</p>

  <p>De Brett smiled, and his smile had none of the attractive qualities that
  his companion's possessed. His lips were pudgy and his eyes beadlike.</p>

  <p>"The mother and I are old friends," he confided. "We have talked of this
  matter seriously, and I believe that we shall at any rate have
  facilities&mdash;through a third person if necessary&mdash;to gain at least
temporary
  possession of the boat. The affairs of one's youth sometimes turn out to
  one's advantage in later years." he added with a little chuckle. "The
  Marquise at one time did me the honour to accept me as her cavalier. She has
  every reason to afford me now what assistance is in her power."</p>

  <p>Mermillon turned away from his companion as though to study once more the
  outline the "<i>Bird of Paradise</i>." His real intention was to mask the
  slight expression of disgust which came so often into his face during his
  conversations with his guest.</p>

  <p>"You are an amazing man, Albert," he murmured. "You have influence
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>De Brett chuckled once more.</p>

  <p>"I say only this of myself," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Other men submit to having their schemes wrecked and their future ruined
  for the sake of a woman. I, too, love women, but I make them serve my
  purpose."</p>

  <p>Mermillon rose as though to stretch himself and walked to the rail of the
  yacht. For a moment or two he remained standing upright gazing steadily
  seawards. There were those amongst his contemporaries who criticised him
  sometimes as a dreamer. This might have been one of those moments which
  justified such an idea, for the thoughts of Edouard Mermillon, premier
  Minister of France, were far away in an island in the Pacific, where the sole
  intrigues were amongst the natives in their bargaining for fish or coral or
  wives, where wealth was useless, and ambition ineffective. The island
  belonged to him&mdash;his by right of purchase and charter. He looked across
the
  sea with gleaming eyes and it was not for any human being to know the longing
  in his heart. He heard his guest's slippered feet approach. The light went
  out from his face. A stony calm took its place.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," the Baron observed, rubbing his hands, "I am a man of
  action. I commence the affair. I have despatched a messenger already to
  Mademoiselle Lucienne, begging her to bring the young man over here this
  afternoon, and take tea or an aperitif with us. I have done
well&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Prompt action is certainly your forte, my friend," Mermillon
  conceded.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">Commander Berard, who had been invited by signal to join
the small
  afternoon party on board the <i>Aigle Noir</i>, arrived half an hour later
  than expected towing behind his launch a small dinghy.</p>

  <p>"Brought you back some ship's property, I think, sir," he observed, as he
  shook hands with Mermillon.</p>

  <p>The latter strolled to the side of the yacht with his visitor, who pointed
  downwards. Mermillon signalled for the captain, who promptly joined them.</p>

  <p>"That's our dinghy, sir, all right," was the unhesitating decision. "It
  was reported missing to me when I made my morning rounds. Might one ask, sir,
  where you picked it up?"</p>

  <p>"We didn't pick it up exactly," the commander explained. "One of my men on
  leave was taking a promenade and found it underneath those overhanging
  bushes."</p>

  <p>"How do you account for that, Captain?" Mermillon asked.</p>

  <p>The former shook his head.</p>

  <p>"How can one account for an incident so extraordinary?" he replied. "No
  one is allowed to take out a boat or even one of the smaller dinghies without
  express permission. Monsieur Chicotin is the only one who has occasionally
  taken a liberty."</p>

  <p>"It appears to me," the, commander volunteered, "as though one of your
  crew had helped himself to a little extra leave during the night time and had
  hidden that boat with the idea of getting back at any hour in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"A very plausible suggestion," Mermillon decided. "After all, this is a
  pleasure yacht and a too rigid discipline is scarcely called for. From the
  decks here my men can often hear the music being played at Juan-les-Pins. I
  expect now and then some of the gay minded ones find it too much for them.
  The matter is not of any particular importance."</p>

  <p>"I thought at first it might have been someone intending to pay you a
  visit," the commander remarked to Wildburn. "It was nearer your boat than
  anyone's."</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have missed a visitor," the latter observed. "It might have been
  another bidder for the boat."</p>

  <p>"The boat," Lucienne reminded him sternly, "is not for sale. It is pledged
  to me. You have perhaps heard," she went on, smiling at Mermillon, "the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> is to be my wedding present from Hamer."</p>

  <p>"I am out of luck," Mermillon complained ruefully. "I tried so hard to buy
  that small yacht, but Mr, Wildburn was adamant."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he liked parting with her even to me," Lucienne confided.
  "He was very sweet about it, though."</p>

  <p>Her host dismissed the subject with a little wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>"My nephew, at any rate, is not hard to please," he said. "So long as it
  is a boat and has sails and something in the way of a engine she is his
  natural home. I never asked de Brett what he discovered about your engines,
  by-the-by. Mr. Wildburn."</p>

  <p>"Twin Diesel," the Baron reported. "Quite enough for her size. I never
  believe in overpowering a boat."</p>

  <p>They went back to their interrupted tea, which was served in the most
  approved English fashion. Afterwards they were shown over the yacht, and
  Lucienne, especially, was loud in her praises.</p>

  <p>"When the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> belongs to me Monsieur Mermillon," she
  said, "I shall perhaps make you a generous offer. Hamer permits I shall
  propose that we exchange boats!"</p>

  <p>"I expect you will find me perfectly willing," he replied. "My nephew
  would find a ship of this size entirely a white elephant. It costs more than
  I can afford to keep it in condition. To tell you the truth, one reason why I
  asked the Baron to cruise with me as my guest was the hope that some evening
  after we had discussed a bottle of his favourite wine together I might sell
  it to him!"</p>

  <p>"Dismiss the idea, my friend," de Brett advised. "In Brussels we are all
  as poor as church rats. Besides which, we are not yachtsmen. We spend our
  money on horses and racing cars."</p>

  <p>"Has anyone," Berard asked, "been in to Juan to see the scene of the
  explosion?"</p>

  <p>"I have," Hamer Wildburn replied.</p>

  <p>"And I," the Baron echoed. "I have never seen a thing so
  extraordinary."</p>

  <p>"The police and the firemen together are, I am informed, confounded,"
  Mermillon declared. "They have wired to Paris for two scientists to come down
  from a Government laboratory. It seems that some new explosive of terrific
  power must have been used, for there are literally no remains, A house and
  furniture, and possibly human beings, have never been known to disappear in
  such a fashion before. Nothing remains but dust and ashes."</p>

  <p>"Of course, the usual stories are going about," the Baron observed. "I
  lunched at the Proven&ccedil;al, and they are full of it. Two or three people
  declare that they positively saw an aeroplane of German make pass over last
  night a few minutes before the explosion. They think that it was just an
  experiment, and that they had observers in the vicinity."</p>

  <p>"The most arrant sensationalism, I should imagine," Mermillon pronounced.
  "I hear that there were no lives lost at all. A wild looking young Jewish
  danseuse, Mademoiselle Tanya, who was the only known tenant, is reported as
  having been seen about during the evening with a man, but she declares that
  they parted long before she entered the Casino, and that he did not even
  enter her apartment. She herself was safely seated at the
  <i>chemin-de-fer</i> table an hour before the explosion."</p>

  <p>"Is it the same Mademoiselle Tanya, I wonder," Lucienne asked, "who was
  dancing at a caf&eacute; up in one of those hill villages a week or two ago?
  We were getting up a party to go and see her, but we were told that she had
  left."</p>

  <p>"I should doubt it very much," the Baron replied. "The performances you
  are speaking of were of a much move artistic nature. I have seen Tanya in the
  Casino at Juan. She has a somewhat wild appearance, but she is beautifully
  dressed, and she has jewellery. One is told that she has received large
  salaries in Paris in well-known places of amusement. The <i>Folies
  Berg&egrave;re</i>, even, was mentioned."</p>

  <p>Wildburn leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I believe her to be the same," he declared. "I saw her
  dance at a very ordinary caf&eacute; indeed just at the back of Garoupe. She
  was shabbily dressed and, so far as I could see, she wore no jewellery. That
  may have been done to keep up the part of the female apache which she was
  representing. I have seen her since at the Casino at Juan, and, as the Baron
  told us, she made a very different appearance."</p>

  <p>"This is distressing news," Lucienne observed, "I pictured you, my dear
  Hamer, spending your nights writing that book or your articles for the paper.
  When have you found time to disport yourself at Juan?"</p>

  <p>"I have been in too great a state of mental disturbance during the last
  few weeks," the young man confessed with a grin, "to settle down to any
  serious work. If you care to see the young woman I will take you to Juan, any
  night you like. Unless she is scared back to Paris by having had her flat
  blown up we are certain to find her playing <i>chemin</i>."</p>

  <p>"I will dine with you this evening at the Casino," Lucienne suggested.
  "Mother is going over to Monte Carlo. See what you have let yourself in
  for!"</p>

  <p>"A very pleasant evening, it seems to me,"' the young man exclaimed, with
  a proper amount of enthusiasm. "I will call for you at about nine o'clock.
  They dine pretty late there, I believe. I suppose, Monsieur Mermillon," he
  went on, turning a little diffidently towards his distinguished host, "it
  would not be possible for you to discover anything about the person who
  helped himself to your dinghy last night? I have noticed a very
  suspicious-looking fellow hanging around in a small boat for several evenings
  lately."</p>

  <p>"Well, I was rather leaving that to my captain," Mermillon replied
  courteously. "Matters of discipline amongst the crew scarcely enter into my
  activities You are interested?"</p>

  <p>"Only because the dinghy was hidden some forty or fifty yards from my own
  boat," Wildburn pointed out. "It might almost seem, as the commander
  indicated, that someone had intended to pay me a nocturnal visit."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Tanya, perhaps!" Lucienne suggested. "I scarcely expected to
  be honoured so far as that," he replied. "Still, between ourselves," he
  added, looking round, "there his been a certain mysterious interest in my
  little craft, and I have already received at least one unwelcome visitor. I
  have not a thing on board worth stealing, but apparently there are people
  about who think that I have. I should really like to know who hid the dinghy
  under those bushes and for what purpose."</p>

  <p>"I will speak to the captain myself," Mermillon promised graciously.
  "Every effort shall be made to clear the matter up. I am inclined to suspect
  my wireless operator. He is rather a gay young Lothario and a wizard with
  those small boats. He can paddle without making a sound. He is off duty just
  now, I am afraid, but later on I will have a word or two with him
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Of course, it might have been he," Wildburn agreed, "but on the other
  hand it doesn't explain his hiding the boat in those bushes."</p>

  <p>The Baron looked up with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Our neighbour is becoming nervous," he said "Now is your time, Edouard,
  to bid him a trifle less than that ridiculous five thousand. I think Mr.
  Wildburn might possibly be induced to break his contract with Mademoiselle
  and get rid of his supposed treasure boat for&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;four
  thousand!"</p>

  <p>"And I thought that you were my friend, Baron!" Lucienne exclaimed
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry, my dear," Wildburn put in. "I shall sell my craft to
  no one at any price. It's yours the day we are married. That's my bribe to
  get you to hurry events up!"</p>

  <p>She hung on to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Quite unnecessary," she whispered. "To-morrow would suit me
  admirably!"</p>

  <p>"Hello! More visitors," the Baron pointed out "We are popular to-day,
  Edouard."</p>

  <p>Mermillon turned his head lazily. The others were already looking down the
  deck with obvious curiosity. General Perissol, a fine figure of a man even in
  his loosely fitting flannels, was approaching, escorted by the first
  officer.</p>

  <p>"It is my friend, our famous neighbour from the lighthouse hill,"
  Mermillon announced. "I can guess what has brought him here."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and held out his hands. The General clasped them and
  greeted the others to whom he was presented with a comprehensive bow.</p>

  <p>"You have come, my dear General, without doubt, to solve for us the
  mystery of that amazing explosion this morning," Mermillon hazarded.</p>

  <p>"Not entirely for that purpose."</p>

  <p>"You are very welcome in any case," his host assured him. "That chair is
  comfortable? Good. Shall we have some fresh tea made or will you join us in
  our first cocktail?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I will take the cocktail. Will you, however, present me first
  to the young lady? I have an idea that she is the daughter of my old friend,
  the Marquis de Montelimar."</p>

  <p>"A thousand apologies," Mermillon said. "In the little fraternity of the
  bay it never occurred to me that you would not have met. Permit me,
  Mademoiselle&mdash;General Perissol&mdash;one of the most dangerous and
important men
  in this troubled country of ours&mdash;Mademoiselle de Montelimar."</p>

  <p>"Your father is an old friend of mine, Mademoiselle," the General remarked
  as he shook hands. "It is owing to your frequent absences abroad, I imagine,
  that we never met."</p>

  <p>"I am glad that I have been fortunate at last." Lucienne answered. "I'm
  afraid that the greater part of my last two years has been spent in England
  and Italy. Let me present a young man in whom I have some slight
interest&mdash;Mr
  Hamer Wildburn."</p>

  <p>"A great pleasure," the General said, shaking hands.</p>

  <p>"Now for the news, sir," Mermillon insisted. "You have the air of one
  bearing tidings."</p>

  <p>"I have none," Perissol confessed calmly. "I am a policeman, and the
  police always keep what news they have to themselves. I am here in search of
  clues to this latest crime myself if anyone has any help to offer."</p>

  <p>"We are all quite ready to assist the law," Mermillon assured him. "But
  what is the crime?"</p>

  <p>"Sabotage," the General replied. "The blowing up of a new block of flats
  with an absolutely novel explosive."</p>

  <p>"But this is a purely local affair," General Mermillon protested "You
  surely do not occupy yourself with such trifles."</p>

  <p>"I do not," Perissol admitted, "except where they touch the fringe of
  larger interests. The Chef de la Surete of the neighbourhood has been to see
  me. He is a nervous man, and he feared to approach you personally. I
  undertook to lessen his responsibilities in the matter. He is anxious to know
  whether you have had in your employ an engineer by the name of Chicotin?"</p>

  <p>"Paul Chicotin?" Mermillon repeated. "Why, certainly, Paul Chicotin has
  been my consulting engineer for some short time. He left me yesterday."</p>

  <p>"May I presume to ask a further question?"</p>

  <p>"By all means, <i>cher General</i>."</p>

  <p>"You perhaps dismissed him?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I ought to have done, because there was not enough work for
  him, but he himself was the first to realise this. He left entirely of his
  own accord. In fact, he has been so useful that I promised to take him back
  if he did not succeed in finding agreeable occupation."</p>

  <p>"You know of his past?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, there I am at a loss," Mermillon acknowledged. "Very little, I'm
  afraid. I knew that he was a Russian by birth, and amazingly skilful in
  dealing with machinery. He has increased the speed of my engines, for
  instance, without expense to me or change of fuel, by at least three
  knots.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," the General announced, with a certain dry inflection
  in his tone, "that he did not start life as a marine engineer, nor is that
  his special forte. However, I agree that we need not concern ourselves with
  his misdeeds of a generation ago. The point is that he is suspected of being
  concerned in the affair of the explosion at Juan-les-Pins last night."</p>

  <p>"<i>Incroyable</i>!" the Baron exclaimed. "A young dandy like Chicotin to
  mix himself up with an affair like that!"</p>

  <p>"It is possible, my confrere," the General continued, taking no notice of
  the interruption "that with many more important matters upon your mind you
  have neglected to notice the man Chicotin, or to concern yourself in his
  doings. He is the reputed lover of Mademoiselle Tanya, the dancer, and is
  said to have spent upon her a considerable amount of money. It is certain
  that in his younger days he was a skilled manufacturer of bombs."</p>

  <p>"Bombs!" Lucienne cried. "What horrible things you make us listen to,
  General."</p>

  <p>"What could a marine engineer know about bombs?" Hamer Wildburn
  protested.</p>

  <p>"The bomb which destroyed the block of flats in Juan-les-Pins could have
  been made by no amateur," the General went on, ignoring the young man's
  query. "A more wholesale piece of destruction I have never seen."</p>

  <p>Mermillon sat up in his chair. It was obvious that he was disturbed.</p>

  <p>"My dear General," he protested. "You do indeed bring a note of tragedy
  into our little haven of rest. I should be deeply grieved if what you suggest
  turned out to be the truth."</p>

  <p>"I fear that there is very little doubt about it," the General pronounced
  gravely. "Quite unwittingly on the part of its officers or Monsieur
  Mermillon, of course, I am afraid that the <i>Aigle Noir</i> has been
  harbouring a very dangerous criminal."</p>

  <p>"This is most unpleasant information," Mermillon acknowledged. "At the
  same time, if it is true the police are to be congratulated upon having got
  so far in their investigations."</p>

  <p>"As I explained," the General continued "Monsieur Sarciron himself, the
  local Chef de la Surete, would have paid you this visit, but he hesitated to
  do so, knowing that you were here seeking a period of complete tranquility.
  He asked me to come unofficially and make these few inquiries. You will not,
  I imagine, object to a visit from the gendarmes to search Monsieur Chicotin's
  belongings and to ask your captain a few questions."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," was the emphatic response. "In the meantime I myself
  am immensely curious to know what has become of that strange little man, and
  why, if he was bent on crime, he concerned himself with an empty flat."</p>

  <p>"The mystery will probably unfold itself in time," Perissol surmised. "Our
  friend Sarciron has already a theory. If it is correct you will never, I am
  afraid, see your engineer again."</p>

  <p>"And the theory?" de Brett asked</p>

  <p>"He believes that Chicotin was in the flat when the explosion took
  place."</p>

  <p>"If it was he who made the bomb," Hamer Wildburn remarked, "that was the
  best place for him."</p>

  <p>"Sarciron believes also," the General proceeded, "that Chicotin was deeply
  enamoured of this Mademoiselle Tanya, who is a dangerous character, and a
  woman of many lovers. He believes that Chicotin quarrelled with her that
  night, and that she left him and went to the Casino. Chicotin remained
  behind, and in some way or other managed to work out his scheme of
  destruction, involving himself in it."</p>

  <p>They had all been seated in a circle listening, and, as neither the
  General nor Mermillon himself had made any effort to keep the conversation
  secret, their interest had been growing all the time. Hamer Wildburn leaned
  forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I ought not to say so," he ventured, "but I do not believe in the
  theory of your local Chef do la Surete."</p>

  <p>The General looked at him tolerantly. "And why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If Chicotin had wanted vengeance upon the girl," Hamer pointed out, "he
  would have waited until she was in the flat, and then exploded the bomb. For
  a man of that type it was a senseless thing to do&mdash;to commit suicide
and blow
  up her flat whilst Mademoiselle Tanya was seated happily in the Casino."</p>

  <p>"Reasonable," the General admitted. "You have an alternative theory of
  your own, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I have," Hamer assented, "but you would probably laugh at it."</p>

  <p>"Let us hear it, at any rate," Perissol begged.</p>

  <p>"I believe that the bomb was intended for me, or rather for my boat."</p>

  <p>"Hamer!" Lucienne cried.</p>

  <p>"You are surely not serious," the General demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I rather think I am," the young man persisted. "Certain things that
  have happened lately have put me on my guard, and for two nights I have taken
  to keeping a sort of watch myself, and both nights, between the searchlight
  flashes, I have seen a small boat of some sort between me and the shadow of
  the trees. Each time there was the same slim man in the boat, wearing a beret
  and a pullover, and each time he had a parcel between his feet&mdash;a
parcel, or
  it might have been a leather case. Last night I was particularly on the
  look-out for him, because for some reason or other the searchlights left off
  earlier than usual. He didn't appear, but there was the dinghy under the
  trees."</p>

  <p>There was a puzzled silence, broken at last by the commander.</p>

  <p>"The searchlights left off earlier last night or rather this morning," he
  explained, "at Monsieur Mermillon's request. I can quite understand that they
  must have been a nuisance to everyone."</p>

  <p>"I owe you at least four hours' sleep for your forbearance," Mermillon
  observed graciously. "Before you left this afternoon I intended to express my
  gratitude."</p>

  <p>"Have you any personal knowledge of this man Chicotin?" the General
  inquired, turning to Wildburn.</p>

  <p>"I have never spoken to him in my life except to ask him what he meant by
  hanging around my boat about a week ago," was the terse reply. "I began to
  think that I must have a false keel filled with precious stones or half a ton
  of cocaine!"</p>

  <p>Mermillon smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that little romance, Mr. Wildburn, is rather discounted by
  the fact that to blow up your ship would destroy any secret treasure that
  might be stored upon her or any value that she might have. However, the
  General will probably mention your theory to his friend, Monsieur Sarciron.
  He will naturally find it a little difficult to account for the bomb being in
  Juan-les-Pins while your boat is here, however."</p>

  <p>"He might have been waiting for the searchlights to stop," the young man
  suggested thoughtfully. "Curiously enough, the explosion took place within
  about ten minutes of the time that they left off."</p>

  <p>Lucienne turned towards the commander with an idea of her own.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell anyone that you were going to stop the searchlights earlier
  last night?" she asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"Never mentioned it to a soul," he assured her. "As a matter of fact, I
  only gave the order a few minutes beforehand."</p>

  <p>The clock from the chapel in the woods struck the hour. The commander rose
  hastily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me," he begged. "I am keeping an evening watch. I shall
  give you a respite again, Monsieur Mermillon, after three o'clock. I wish
  everybody good evening."</p>

  <p>The commander hurried off and Hamer Wildburn and his companion followed
  suit a short time later. Only Perissol lingered. The frown upon his forehead
  had become more pronounced.</p>

  <p>"The situation," he remarked dolefully, "is becoming a trifle more
  complicated."</p>

  <p>Mermillon was inclined to be curt. He rose to his feet and sauntered along
  towards the gangway. It was almost an invitation to his guest to take his
  departure.</p>

  <p>"I must confess," he admitted "that I am a little bored with my recreant
  marine engineer and this ingenuous young American with his mysterious boat. I
  have not yet finished my day's despatches which it occurs to me, are of more
  vital importance."</p>

  <p>Perissol promptly took the hint.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you, sir," he acknowledged, "for the time you
  have given me. The solution of this matter will without a doubt present
  itself."</p>

  <p>"I cannot see that the affair is of more than local importance," was the
  terse reply.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">The dinner party <i>a deux</i> at Juan-les-Pins had been
very happily
  accomplished. The rising of the moon found Hamer Wildburn and Lucienne a
  little weary, but exceedingly content, still seated at their table on the
  terrace of the Casino. The place was thinning out, for the gambling was in
  full swing, but the divine stillness of the night, the queer attraction of
  the hanging lights, the softly played music, had tempted many to linger.</p>

  <p>"When," the young man asked, not for the first time, "is that father of
  yours really coming back from Paris?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew," she answered. "I want my boat."</p>

  <p>"And I want you," he sighed.</p>

  <p>"Would it be very unmaidenly of me," she whispered, "If I told you that
  you would find me quite ready?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, you are driving me crazy," he complained. "I wonder if you
  have any idea how beautiful you look to-night in that white frock and just
  the pearls?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I have no idea," she told him. "Tell me, please."</p>

  <p>"Well, you look just the most exquisite thing on earth," he assured her.
  "I swear that your eyes have grown larger during the last few days and as for
  those eye-lashes of yours&mdash;why, no one could describe them. Shall I say
a few
  words about your hair?"</p>

  <p>"What lovely nonsense," she interrupted. "But I love to hear it. I love
  being here with you, too, especially to-night, Hamer. Shall I tell you
  something strange?"</p>

  <p>"Do," he begged.</p>

  <p>"For the first time in my life I think I know what fear is."</p>

  <p>"Fear?" he repeated incredulously. "Being afraid, do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But what are you afraid of?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. Life. It is not so much a personal fear. I seem to feel
  somehow that things are happening. The sort of feeling one might have if one
  were very religious and were told in a vision that the world were coming to
  an end. That is how I feel about life just now."</p>

  <p>"For a sane and healthy young woman," he declared, "I don't think I ever
  heard anything so absurd. Try another glass of champagne, dear, quickly,"</p>

  <p>She obeyed him, but the look of trouble remained in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I know that I'm silly," she acknowledged "There's only one
  thing in life I take seriously except you, and that's France."</p>

  <p>He nodded sympathetically,</p>

  <p>"A grand country," he agreed, "but what's wrong with it? I thought that
  since Edouard Mermillon and Chauvanne accepted portfolios in the Cabinet, and
  they created that wonderful new post for Perissol&mdash;a fine fellow,
  that&mdash;everything was so much better and sounder."</p>

  <p>"On the surface," she answered. "Perissol is splendid, of course, but I
  can't help wishing that he were back in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Even a superman must have a holiday sometimes," Hamer protested. "I saw
  in one of the papers that he had not been away from the bureau since the day
  he accepted his office, five months ago."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I have a thoroughly stupid idea," she confessed, "but there it
  is. I believe he is down here watching Mermillon."</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn stared across at her without comprehension.</p>

  <p>"But listen, sweetheart," he said. "I read the French papers a good deal.
  It's my job rather not to come a bloomer over any of these things. It was
  Mermillon's brilliant speech in the Chamber which united the votes of all
  parties except the extremists and gave Perissol his post. Why, look at them
  this afternoon, how friendly they were."</p>

  <p>"I know," she assented without enthusiasm "I dare say I'm crazy, Hamer,
  but even the <i>Temps</i> predicted once that if anything happened in the way
  of a rising in France, if someone fanned up the embers of all those terrible
  scandals of a year ago into flames again, it would happen during this period
  of long vacation with everyone away. Think of it now. The President is in his
  country house somewhere in the Pyrenees, where he boasts that he hasn't a
  telephone and a motor car can only reach him with difficulty. As for Monsieur
  Chauvanne, no one knows where he is. He left Cherbourg in his own yacht,
  which is quite large enough to sail round the world, and a little paragraph
  in one of the papers this morning pointed out that his boat has not been
  reported since she left France. I wish I knew the General well enough. I
  would tell him that I think he ought to be back in Paris."</p>

  <p>"If there had been anything going on there," Hamer pointed out, "I should
  have heard of it through my paper. Even the Communists must rest some time,
  you know. Put all these things out of your mind. I never did thoroughly
  understand French politics," he went on. "I spent a year in Paris trying to
  study them, and in the end I think I understood a little less than when I
  began. All I know is that the present Cabinet is considered the strongest
  which France has had for a long time."</p>

  <p>"I expect it is all right," she declared more cheerfully. "I suppose I am
  too happy in myself. That is what has made me feel nervous lately. Home
  influences, too, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Your father is not in politics, is he?"</p>

  <p>Hamer asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He is interested, of course, but outside it all. That is where I think
  France is wrong. The old aristocracy are looked upon coldly whenever they
  make any attempt to serve their country, yet no one cares for France more
  than we do, Hamer!"</p>

  <p>"Dearest."</p>

  <p>"Will you say yes if I ask you a favour?"</p>

  <p>"I should think it highly probable, if it's anything about this dance I'm
  all for it."</p>

  <p>They gilded off together&mdash;a kind of slow blues&mdash;the movements
of which
  were so smooth that they formed no hindrances to conversation.</p>

  <p>"This is my favour," she said. "Of course, I have been all over her once,
  but I want to thoroughly explore the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>."</p>

  <p>"Why, you're welcome to do that whenever you choose," he assented
  promptly. "Any day you like. I don't mind confessing that after certain
  events and certain inexplicable happenings lately I have been going round
  myself with a hammer and divining rod&mdash;speaking metaphorically."</p>

  <p>"Did you discover anything?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing. I have done my best, but I can't see anything about her
  which makes her worth even a penny more than the eighteen hundred pounds I
  gave for her. There is no space for hidden treasure of any very large amount,
  and the people who are chiefly interested in her don't seem like people who
  are hungry for money. There's a woman there," he added, moving his head
  slightly in the direction of a couple a little ahead of them, "who could
  probably give us an idea what to look for."</p>

  <p>"The Princess!" the girl exclaimed. "I don't think that she knows
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Why did she turn my cabin inside out, then?" Hamer demanded. "Why did she
  put stuff in my coffee? What did she come to the boat at all for?"</p>

  <p>"She is an impulsive creature," Lucienne declared. "I never mentioned the
  drug, of course, but I did ask her why she turned all your things inside out
  after you had been so kind and pulled her out of the water. She insisted upon
  it that all she wanted was a scarf! Her neck was cold, and she wanted to hide
  the jewellery she was wearing! Be careful, Hamer. She is coming to speak to
  us. That is the Marquis de St. Pierre she is with."</p>

  <p>Louise and her escort came up to the table at which the others had just
  reseated themselves. Hamer Wildburn was introduced. There was a little family
  conversation, then Louise turned smilingly to the young American.</p>

  <p>"And my beautiful boat," she asked, "where you made me so comfortable when
  I was stupid and overturned my canoe? You are taking care of it?"</p>

  <p>"I am doing my best," he assured her. "I never dreamed that I was
  acquiring so popular a possession when I bought her."</p>

  <p>"She is coming into the family very soon," Lucienne confided. "I am going
  to marry Mr. Wildburn, although my people don't know it yet, and he has
  promised me the '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>' for a wedding present."</p>

  <p>Louise was a little startled.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate Mr. Wildburn heartily," she said, "and of course, my dear
  Lucienne, you know that I wish you every happiness. I regret, though, that he
  has promised you the '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>.' I want to buy it. I told him
  so that night. You wouldn't rather have a pearl necklace, would you, dear? We
  might make an exchange."</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose that one could barter the wedding present of a
  bridegroom to his bride?" Lucienne protested. "When it becomes mine it is
  mine for ever. I am not sure that I shall keep her where she is. You are all
  so jealous. I think I shall take her round into our private harbour on the
  other side..."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about dear Armand," Louise begged. "I haven't seen him for a
  whole day. I don't think he looks in the least rested."</p>

  <p>"We met him on the <i>Aigle Noir</i> this afternoon," Wildburn remarked.
  "He seemed all right. Lonely life for him up there, I should think. No
  distraction and nothing but messengers going backwards and forwards all the
  time."</p>

  <p>"That's the worst of French politics, especially if a man is in the
  Cabinet," Louise sighed. "A Minister is never left alone even on his
  vacation. Busy little secretaries with their portfolios follow him about
  wherever he is. That's why so many of them go into hiding. Armand, too, is so
  conscientious. That reminds me&mdash;I have invited myself to lunch there
  to-morrow. I shall try and make him take me out somewhere...Is this a joke of
  yours, Lucienne, or are you and Mr. Wildburn really engaged?"</p>

  <p>"We are waiting for the family sanction," the girl replied. "I telephone
  father every day and warn him that terrible things are going on here, but it
  doesn't seem to hurry him up. Since he developed this intense interest in
  politics and finance Paris seems to draw him like a magnet."</p>

  <p>"You will permit me," the Marquis intervened, "to offer you my heartfelt
  wishes for your happiness, Lucienne, and to congratulate you, sir," he added,
  turning to Wildburn. "If the hour of the night permitted I would suggest that
  we drink your health, As it is," glancing towards Louise, "I am afraid that
  we must be leaving."</p>

  <p>"I am at your disposition, St. Pierre," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Your mention of your father reminds me that I saw him in Paris three days
  ago," the Marquis remarked as he shook hands with Lucienne."</p>

  <p>"Enjoying himself?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Very much the reverse, I should say," the Marquis replied.</p>

  <p>"He was with two very well known men lunching at Henry's and discussing
  some apparently weighty matter with great vigour."</p>

  <p>"I thought you never left your property here now, Marquis," Lucienne
  observed, shaking her finger at him.</p>

  <p>"I leave very seldom," he admitted. "On this occasion I found Paris
  unbelievably <i>triste</i>. Everyone seems to be moving about as though they
  were bowed down with woe and expecting a thunderstorm at any moment. Of
  gaiety there is very little. My heart was light for the first time when I
  returned to my <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> here."</p>

  <p>"What is it all about, anyway?" Wildburn asked. "I have an office in Paris
  and I hear very much the same reports, but no one seems to know why. France
  has at least succeeded in getting together a strong and reputable Cabinet.
  She is the only nation which seems to understand finance&mdash;bleeding us
poor
  foreigners to death, as a matter of fact. I should think that everyone ought
  to be walking on tiptoe."</p>

  <p>"How can one tell where one gets these feelings from?" the Marquis sighed,
  "So far as I am concerned, it is perhaps because I am growing old. The wines
  which I used to find so wonderful in my favourite restaurants seem to have
  lost their flavour. The girls dance with heavy feet. Their eyes call no
  longer. The little chansons which once amused us so are toneless. Perhaps it
  is Paris that is growing old."</p>

  <p>"Au revoir," Louise exclaimed. "I must lake my old friend away or I shall
  have the migraine."</p>

  <p>"A nice cheerful old bird, that," Hamer Wildburn observed dolefully, a
  moment or two later.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with St. Pierre," Lucienne murmured, as she rose to her feet,
  "is that he has too much courage to admit defeat. He is really seventy-five
  years old and he thinks that he is sixty-five. He has an income of perhaps a
  million francs, and he believes that it is three&mdash;which I believe it
was not
  long ago. He was too devoted to his wife to ever marry again, and he has too
  good taste to care about a housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"Pretty good summing up for an ingenue," Hamer Wildburn acknowledged, as
  he paid the bill.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after midnight Perissol, sitting in his shirt sleeves
before his
  desk, was disturbed by the entrance of Raymond, the chief of his secretaries.
  The young man was looking grave.</p>

  <p>"Mon General," he announced. "I regret to say that our private wire to
  Paris has probably been tampered with. I can get no connection."</p>

  <p>"Ring up on the other exchange," Perissol ordered. "Speak to the night
  chef. Tell him to report the breakdown to Monsieur Laporte, and if the line
  is not in order by nine o'clock to-morrow morning Laporte himself is
  suspended. You understand that?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Parfaitement, monsieur</i>. An important message has just come through
  very much delayed on the ordinary line."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Lavandou has just passed through Avignon on his way
  southward."</p>

  <p>"Coming to see me?"</p>

  <p>"That was the message. Monsieur Lavandou is travelling by automobile, and
  paused only for a moment, leaving the message to be transmitted by the
  telephone bureau."</p>

  <p>"Lavandou on his way here!" the General repeated. "What does that mean?
  There is no news of Chauvanne or we should have had it upon the
  wireless."</p>

  <p>"None whatever. Two or three of the Paris evening papers have commented
  upon the fact. They have communicated with Lloyd's in London. The yacht
  Monsieur Chauvanne is on has not been reported since she left Cherbourg."</p>

  <p>"And Lavandou on his way here," Perissol meditated. "Pass word down to the
  lodge, Raymond, that Monsieur Lavandou's car is to be sent through without
  delay."</p>

  <p>"That is already done, General," the secretary replied. "May I suggest, in
  view of what must be an important interview, that you have an hour's sleep?
  Lavandou's car can scarcely get here before four o'clock."</p>

  <p>The General leaned back in his chair, a little wearily. He dropped his
  eyeglass and smoothed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, Raymond," he said, "I think I will get into the pool for
  a quarter of an hour. I certainly could not sleep until I know Lavandou's
  mission. What time are you off duty?"</p>

  <p>"Another five hours, General. I only came on at eleven o'clock. Andre will
  relieve me then. He knows already about the telephone."</p>

  <p>"The message to the commandant at Antibes went through on the local line,
  I suppose?" Perissol inquired.</p>

  <p>"Quite early this evening, General. The commandant's reply was that
  everything was prepared."</p>

  <p>Perissol dismissed the young man with a nod. Afterwards he passed through
  the French windows, descended the terrace, and, reaching the swimming pool,
  slipped off his clothes and plunged in. For a quarter of an hour he swam
  peacefully. Then, with a sigh of contentment, he dried himself with towels
  from a hidden grotto, and resumed his clothes. He lit a cigar and paced the
  terrace which surrounded the villa, his brow furrowed with thought, a new
  anxiety added to the cares of the moment...Chauvanne was without a doubt the
  one vulnerable spot in the Cabinet, Lavandou, his understudy, was to be
  trusted, but here was Lavandou, after only a month of office, on his way down
  rushing southwards obviously with tidings of great import...Perissol took
  little notice of the falling moon, which had been flooding the whole bay and
  the surrounding country with beauty. He watched only the distant road with
  its many twists and turns, which led from Cannes. It was fruitless watching
  for the end brought pain rather than relief. A furiously-driven car came
  tearing up the last few corkscrew bends, lights flashing and horn blowing. A
  few minutes later a middle-aged man, his possibly official clothes covered by
  a motoring duster, his hair and face powdered with dust, stumbled out through
  the hastily-opened door on to the terrace.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lavandou," the General exclaimed, "you are worn out. Don't tell
  me that you have come from Paris in the day?"</p>

  <p>"I left at six o'clock this morning," the man replied, sinking on to one
  of the garden seats. "Of course, I meant to fly, but the aviation ground was
  watched. The authorities advised me by telephone that no plane was available
  for me. I suppose if I had ventured there it would have been the end. They
  say that there are assassins at every corner in Paris."</p>

  <p>"But what is it then that has arrived?" Perissol demanded anxiously. "The
  last time we met you were exuberant with joy over your new appointment. What
  is this catastrophe that has brought you here in such a state? For heaven's
  sake, explain."</p>

  <p>"I have made a horrible discovery," the newcomer groaned, throwing his hat
  away from him and passing his hands through his dust-sprinkled hair.</p>

  <p>"Surely it can't be so horrible as all that," Perissol remonstrated. "You
  want food and drink, I can see. Afterwards, perhaps affairs will shape
  differently."</p>

  <p>"Wine, perhaps," the other assented. "Food afterwards. Mon General, I
  think the world is coming to an end!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that has to happen some time," was the philosophical response.</p>

  <p>"Then it had better happen now," Lavandou declared.</p>

  <p>A servant brought out wine. The tired man drank feverishly.</p>

  <p>"The chauffeur," he begged. "Please see to his wants. He has driven like
  one inspired."</p>

  <p>"His wants will be attended to," his host assured him. "Now, Lavandou," he
  added, as soon as the door was closed. "No more of this suspense. Let me have
  your news if you have any."</p>

  <p>"France lately," Lavandou faltered, "has lost by death or disgrace some of
  her finest sons, yet the debacle has not yet begun. One begins to fear for
  others&mdash;others more trusted&mdash;more beloved."</p>

  <p>The General looked around. He drew his friend through the French windows
  into the study and closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Spies even here?" Lavandou asked bitterly. "One never knows," was the
  even rejoinder. "I have learnt caution in my later days. It appears to me
  that you are going to speak of serious things."</p>

  <p>"You shall judge. You will remember that my appointment was made only a
  short time before Chauvanne was to leave for his long delayed vacation, I had
  several interviews with him and learnt the outline of my work. At the final
  one he seemed to me a little mysterious.</p>

  <p>"'If you come to anything, Lavandou,' he instructed, 'that you do not
  understand place it on one side until my return. Do not seek the advice of
  anyone else. You and I and our staff are to run this bureau. You
  understand?'</p>

  <p>"Of course, I assured him that I understood perfectly. I have dealt with
  big figures all my life, as you know, General, and I had no fears.
  Nevertheless, I determined to leave nothing to chance. I asked him to give me
  his destination secretly in case anything of great importance should happen.
  He shook his head. There was that queer look about his eyes that I had
  noticed during the last six or seven months.</p>

  <p>"'I am not going to give you the chance of communicating with me,
  Lavandou,' he replied. 'My doctor tells me that unless I get a complete rest
  I shall become a wreck for life. I am leaving on a yacht in three days' time,
  and I am sailing westwards. I shall touch no port until I am obliged to and I
  have given orders to have the wireless disconnected. Voila. Continue with the
  routine work and leave anything you don't understand for my return.' That was
  his farewell."</p>

  <p>"It seems reasonable enough." Perissol commented.</p>

  <p>"Wait! The first task which fell to my lot was to tabulate; and master the
  details of the recently subscribed 5 per cent. National Loan. The papers have
  announced the subscription of nine hundred millions. The actual amount
  received was thirteen hundred millions."</p>

  <p>The General smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lavandou," he expostulated. "A mistake of four hundred millions
  is incredible."</p>

  <p>"That is the curse of it!" Lavandou cried. "There could not be a mistake.
  There is not a mistake. Do you not understand what I am telling you? Four
  hundred millions of francs have disappeared from the Treasury books! They
  have gone into space&mdash;into air&mdash;whatever you like. But we are not
talking now
  of possible mistakes. They have gone where many another hundred million has
  gone during the last 12 months."</p>

  <p>Perissol was serious enough now.</p>

  <p>"There is no possibility of any blunder, my friend?" he asked
  hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"None whatever, my General," was the agonised reply. "Four hundred million
  francs have disappeared and two men, beside myself and Chauvanne, must be
  aware of this."</p>

  <p>"Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Edouard Mermillon and the Baron de Brett."</p>

  <p>"Mermillon!"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Perissol was standing with folded arms looking
  into space. In the fading light he seemed to have grown in stature. He was
  like some emblematical figure of past ages standing up to greet the
  morning.</p>

  <p>"The one man who might have saved the country," he murmured. "The one man
  concerning whom no word of scandal has ever been spoken."</p>

  <p>"De Brett was without a doubt at the back of it," Lavandou groaned. "That
  is easily proved. It is the whole of the subscriptions from Belgium which are
  unaccounted for."</p>

  <p>"Do they know at the bureau what you have discovered?" Perissol asked.</p>

  <p>"They might surmise," Lavandou acknowledged. "I discovered days ago that I
  am surrounded by spies. I am convinced that a record has been kept of how
  many hours I have been at the bureau, where I have lunched and dined and with
  whom I have conversed. Early this morning I rang up an aerodrome. Within a
  few minutes afterwards I had word from a friend that I had better not ask for
  a 'plane."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I asked for one. It was official business and I had a perfect
  right to. The reply came almost at once. There was no private 'plane
  available for at least 48 hours."</p>

  <p>"And Chauvanne is still away on that infernal yachting cruise?"</p>

  <p>"Bound for an unknown port without wireless. That is what they believe at
  the Bureau, at any rate, and what he told me. It was because I could not
  communicate with him that I tried to solve what seemed to be quite a trifling
  matter myself. In the course of my attempts I stumbled upon the truth. I take
  no credit for this thing, General, but I assure you that a super-accountant
  with the most astute financial brain in Europe might go over these accounts
  day after day without making the discovery that I did. It was entirely due to
  my not being able to ask the chief a single question and having to invent a
  checking system of my own."</p>

  <p>The General buried his face for a moment in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Where is this thing going to end?" he groaned.</p>

  <p>"In the ruin of France," Lavandou replied solemnly. "You and I will
  survive, if we survive at all, to see her in the hands of the Communists. We
  shall see her a country without soul or living purpose drifting to her
  ruin."</p>

  <p>Perissol seemed to gain strength from the other's weakness. He lit a
  cigarette and looked with calm contempt at the broken down man upon the
  bench.</p>

  <p>"You are overtired, my friend," he said. "Your effort has been too much.
  Eat and drink and then smoke. You will then see things in a less gloomy
  light."</p>

  <p>The two men talked until the moon paled in the sky and a cool breeze stole
  from eastwards with the incoming tide. Curiously enough, for the first part
  of the time, they spoke very little of the grim tragedy by which they were
  confronted. Something even stronger than themselves seemed to drive them into
  a strangely inspired dissertation on life and death. Afterwards, however, for
  hours on end they faced the truth with grim directness. The sun had already
  risen when Lavandou held out his hands.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, "my friend of twenty years, you have at all times
  supported me. You will not misjudge me. You will understand if the world
  reviles that I take the only course a man can take. If I disclose my
  discoveries to the Press or outside the bureau it will be a nail in the
  coffin of France. I cannot report to my chief, and I have a terrible feeling
  in my heart that we shall never see him again. If discovery comes I shall
  know what to do, I am fortunately a man without family, or I might hesitate.
  France demands her sacrifice, and she shall have it."</p>

  <p>The General wrung his friend's hand. The automobile was waiting and he had
  no words.</p>

  <p>"Under certain circumstances you have found the only solution," he
  reflected sadly. "But courage, mon ami. Chauvanne may return. There is
  something in the breath of this air that gives me hope. A morning even as
  beautiful may dawn for France."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Two of the greatest men in France opened their morning
papers three days
  later at the same moment. Edouard Mermillon, in a sheltered corner of the
  <i>Aigle Noir</i> sat before his <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner</i> of fragrant
  coffee, fresh rolls with Normandy butter, and wonderful peaches&mdash;General
  Perissol, seated in a corner of his terrace before a far more Spartan meal.
  Mermillon read one column, swung round in his place, and sent for his
  secretary. Afterwards he poured out his coffee and prepared a peach in
  leisurely fashion.</p>

  <p>"Jules," he directed, "telephone at once to the air depot at Cannes. Ask
  at what time the morning 'plane for Paris goes, and whether it is necessary
  to stop at Lyons. If so, demand further if a private 'plane can be
  commandeered for Government service.. One moment, Baron," he cried to his
  friend, who, in bathing attire, had just stepped up the gangway.</p>

  <p>The latter wrapped himself in the dressing gown which his valet was
  holding out for him.</p>

  <p>"I drip," he cried, "and the water was cold. Is it news of
  importance?"</p>

  <p>"It might almost be called that," Mermillon assured him.</p>

  <p>The Baron came unwillingly to the table and clutched the paper which his
  host extended to him. The healthy glow of a few seconds ago passed from his
  features. The flesh seemed to sag in his cheeks. His eyes, normal enough in a
  general sort of way, seemed to become like beads.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gaston Lavandou Suicide:</i></p>

  <p>"<i>Le Sous-Secretaire du Bureau de Finance est trouve mort dans
  l'appartement de Madame Jacqueline, l'actrice bien connue de la Comedie
  Francaise.</i>"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ciel!</i>" de Brett exclaimed. "What does this mean?"</p>

  <p>Mermillon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It appears quite clear," he said, "that there exists, or rather did exist
  until early this morning, one more prodigious fool in the world. If you read
  further you will see that Gaston Lavandou called earlier in the evening upon
  his mistress and found her and his rival. She appears to have been a little
  brutal to Lavandou and to have left for the theatre with this man who is at
  present unknown. Lavandou, instead of behaving like a man of fashion and a
  philosopher, blows out his brains in her apartment and leaves behind a letter
  which reads like the sentimental caterwauling of a disappointed tom-cat!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire</i>?" the Baron exclaimed, his voice hoarse
  with fear. "Another man will have to be appointed and Chauvanne is away. Who
  will be able to fix the limit to his possible investigations?"</p>

  <p>"What must be done is clear," Mermillon declared. "I must get to Paris in
  time to appoint a successor to Lavandou who is one of our own party and a man
  we can trust. I have sufficient authority for that. They say that Chauvanne
  has no wireless on his yacht. I begin to ask myself, perhaps, whether his
  destination was not Brazil. Anyway someone in authority must be at the Bureau
  of Finance within a few hours. Drink some coffee. You ave shivering."</p>

  <p>"I should spit it out," the Baron answered. He glanced at the headlines,
  read the paragraph again, then he laid the paper upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Only one thing can happen," he groaned. "If Chauvanne does not return the
  President will order an outside investigation at the bureau."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of that sort is likely to happen," Mermillon said calmly. "I
  shall reach Paris in time to appoint a successor and when you read the paper
  carefully you will see that this fellow Lavandou has made it as clear as day
  that his suicide had nothing whatever to do with finance."</p>

  <p>"I don't think," the Boron said, with chattering teeth, "that I shall go
  to Paris."</p>

  <p>"In any case you had better go and change," Mermillon advised him, with a
  slight but distinct note of scorn in his tone. "You could scarcely go to
  Brussels like that."</p>

  <p>General Perissol was perhaps calmer, but when he laid down the newspaper
  there were tears in his eyes. He was still seated in his place gazing out
  seawards when Louise, who had hurried past the servant who would have
  announced her, swept through the French windows and with extended arms came
  breathlessly towards him.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," she cried. "My poor dear Armand! I heard the news an
  hour ago. I rushed here."</p>

  <p>He held her hands for a moment in silence. Then he fetched a garden chair
  and placed it by his side.</p>

  <p>"But Lavandou of all men!" she exclaimed. "One saw nothing of him in
  society. Once you gave a reception and I talked to him for a few minutes. I
  thought him a shy man. He was difficult to talk to, and seemed only anxious
  to get away. He is the last person in the world I should have suspected of an
  intrigue like that. Lavandou, a lover of women, to that extent! It seems
  incredible."</p>

  <p>"He was no lover of women," the General answered sadly.</p>

  <p>"Then what was he?" she demanded. "A hero," was the brief response.</p>

  <p>Louise held her forehead for a minute.</p>

  <p>"I am bewildered," she confessed. "Give me some of your coffee if you have
  any left."</p>

  <p>A butler, who had been hovering in the background, brought a fresh supply.
  Louise sipped a little and leaned back in her chair.</p>

  <p>"You suspected this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I feared it," Perissol admitted. "Lavandou was here three days ago."</p>

  <p>"But you take it so calmly," she exclaimed. "You show no anger. Surely
  this thing which he has done&mdash;for a deputy, for a man on his way to high
  office&mdash;is ignominious. It is dastardly. His letter is the letter of a
mad
  but peevish schoolboy. He seems to wish the world to know that he has
  abandoned his career and killed himself because a woman has been faithless to
  him. He seems to glory in his disgrace."</p>

  <p>"You do not understand yet," Perissol said gravely.</p>

  <p>She looked back at the paragraph.</p>

  <p>"But what more is there to understand?" she demanded. "I have never known
  you before to be mistaken in a man. You must have understood his
  disposition."</p>

  <p>"I knew it better than any other man," Perissol told her. "I knew his
  habits well. I know that women for him were only a slight but pleasant
  pastime. What he loved more than anything else in the world was France. He
  died for France. He gave more than his life for France; he gave his
  honour."</p>

  <p>"You are trying to bewilder me," she complained.</p>

  <p>"You and I will share this secret," he said, "or the secret of what I
  believe."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Have I ever broken faith with you, Armand?"</p>

  <p>"Never, dearest. I trust you now, although this matter goes beyond the
  life or death of one man."</p>

  <p>"You terrify me."</p>

  <p>"Lavandou came to me a man distraught, as you know. He was a skilful
  mathematician as well as a great financier. He understood the art of juggling
  with figures possibly better than any man in France. He was set an important
  task&mdash;to tabulate the amounts received from different departments of
France
  and neighbouring countries to this last great national loan launched by
  Chauvanne. In the course of his work he came to a cul de sac. If Chauvanne
  had been in the country he would have asked one simple question, easily
  answered, and all would have been well. Chauvanne being away, he applied a
  method of his own to test certain results. The outcome was alarming. He
  discovered, beyond a doubt, that some four hundred millions of the loan had
  never been tabulated at all."</p>

  <p>"Then what had become of them?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We must pause there," he told her.</p>

  <p>"But it is impossible," she protested. "You have begun: you must finish.
  Armand&mdash;what does this mean?"</p>

  <p>He reflected for some moments, then he continued.</p>

  <p>"You know what I have long suspected," he said. "You know that while I
  rest here, apparently taking my usual vacation in the usual fashion, such
  brains as I have are at work in Paris, in Brussels, in Lyons, in London, in
  other centres. I may find myself before long in the same terrible position as
  Lavandou. He knew very well this smouldering feeling of discontent all
  through France, this horrible, only half-stifled suspicion that the Tositi
  investigation has failed, that the discoveries which have been made are only
  external discolorations of a foul disease. Lavandou knew very well that the
  publication of this discovery&mdash;another four millions gone into the
pockets of
  robbers of the State&mdash;would have been as good as a battle cry to the
  Communists, the anarchists, and the riff-raff who would wreck France.
  Nevertheless, their outcry would have raised a fire of passionate discontent.
  The President would have had to call the Chamber together and without a doubt
  the Government would have fallen. Who is left to take our place? Not one
  single soul. With no Government what would happen to France?"</p>

  <p>"Is there no honest political party, then," she cried, "no one who can be
  trusted?"</p>

  <p>"The men are there," he answered. "Plenty of them. But they have never
  been brought together. They are kept apart by trifles&mdash;personal
  predilections, prejudices&mdash;all things not worth a moment's consideration.
  They want the right leader, the strong ringing voice telling the truth, and
  France could once more have the most powerful and patriotic Government in the
  world. But the electioneering has been all wrong. The people have been
  deceived. She will right herself, but Lavandou saw the truth. She must right
  herself slowly without any of these violent discoveries or shocks. She must
  right herself at a time when the men who can deal with a crisis are at hand
  and ready to act."</p>

  <p>"Give up your police work, Armand," she begged him. "The stamping out of
  crime is a slight thing compared to the future of France. Take a bold
  plunge."</p>

  <p>He drew her even closer to him. His strong features were moved with
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see, Louise, the people whom I most mistrust have shown their
  genius by placing me in the Cabinet? You forgot that I am no longer Chef de
  la Surete of Paris. I have powers over the whole of France. I am a Minister,
  too, with a portfolio. If I have to change my portfolio I shall do it, but
  the last year in my present position has enabled me to find out more about
  the Communists and the secret plotters against the Government than I could
  have found out in any other way. I have no ambitions, dearest, for myself,
  but I have a desire which is a real passion to see France again in safe
  waters."</p>

  <p>Her arm stole round his neck. They were completely alone. She stroked his
  face gently. Her fingers seemed to travel down those lines which had grown
  deeper during the last few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile," she whispered, "you starve yourself. You work night and day,
  your thoughts concentrated upon others. You give your life, your passion,
  your heart to one task. Great though it may be, Armand, it is also selfish.
  You keep others who love you suffering."</p>

  <p>His eyes softened. He held her hands and drew her from her chair to the
  place on the bench by his side. Her head fell on his shoulder. She raised her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"For the rest, sweetheart," he said, "help me if you will. Go on helping
  me. If I have seemed distant at times, it is because I fear to draw anyone so
  famous and beautiful a you, one whom I love so well, into the whirlpool. This
  morning I am either weaker or stronger&mdash;Heaven knows which&mdash;but
remember
  this, those who fight in this secret battle, which at any moment may blaze up
  into furious pandemonium, live under a death sentence. Realise that, Louise,
  and choose."</p>

  <p>Her lips, on fire with passion, met his once more.</p>

  <p>"You know how I shall choose," she sobbed. "I, too, want to
serve&mdash;not,
  alas, for the sake of France only, but because I love you."</p>

  <p>There were sounds within the house. She resumed her seat with gay,
  stealthy movements. Her face had become like the face of a young girl. She
  leaned towards him with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"My trunks are already at the station," she whispered. "We dine
  here&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"At your own hour," he said. "Bring your own maid. It was a foolish
  thought of mine to go to Paris. I have others who can serve me there. I shall
  do better to stay away until the moment of crisis."</p>

  <p>"If only we can have even twenty-four hours," she prayed.</p>

  <p>"Lavandou has given us that&mdash;and longer," he assured her. "You had
better
  bring your maid. Remember that my household here is rough enough. You will
  have to reconstruct it. You muse make me live once more like a civilised man.
  Perhaps I shall be able to cope better with these elegants of the
  coast&mdash;Edouard Mermillon, de Brett, the Marquis de Montelimar, and St.
  Pierre, who called the other day and looked with horror at my shabby grey
  trousers!"</p>

  <p>"We will live for one another and France," she declared fervently, "and,
  if necessary, I will do the cocking."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">The walls of the Casino at Juan-les-Pins were plastered
with announcements
  of a great attraction.</p>

  <p>"<i>TANYA VIZILLE des Folies Bergeres de Paris, Trois representations
  seulement: Toutes les nuits sont des nuits de gala. Prix du diner frs. 100.
  Il est prudent de retenir ses places</i>."</p>

  <p>An hour before the second night of her appearance, Mademoiselle Tanya sat
  in the retiring room allotted to her in the Casino suffering the
  ministrations of her coiffeur and manicurist. There was a pile of evening
  papers by her side to which she was also giving some attention.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle's triumph last night was unparalleled," the coiffeur
  confided in almost an awed tone. "Seldom have we seen such a fury amongst an
  audience. To-night there is not a table to be had."</p>

  <p>"<i>Zut</i>," Tanya scoffed. "They are easy to please&mdash;this little
world.
  In Paris it is the same. It is here I live. The great critics come to my
  room."</p>

  <p>"So one has heard, Mademoiselle," the coiffeur ventured. "And in the midst
  of her triumph Mademoiselle disappeared. One heard she was dancing up at a
  small caf&eacute; in this neighbourhood. It was perhaps a <i>canard,
  cela</i>."</p>

  <p>"I do as I please," Tanya said curtly. "Sometimes I am bored with life,
  then I look for a quiet spot and to amuse myself I dance for a few francs. I
  send the people crazy just the same. They ask me: 'Why am I not in Paris? Do
  I wish for introductions?'&mdash;and I laugh. That pleases me and I go back
again.
  But there are other things I care about as much as the stage."</p>

  <p>"As <i>par exemple</i>?"</p>

  <p>"You are my coiffeur," Tanya reminded him curtly. "Arrange my hair and ask
  no more questions."</p>

  <p>The man was coldly angry, for he saw the smile on the lips of the
  manicurist. He obeyed, however.</p>

  <p>"There is a young man who has a boat near here&mdash;an American, I
believe.
  They tell me that he seldom comes to the Casino. A Mr. Hamer Wildburn," Tanya
  said. "He is a client of yours perhaps? You may answer when I speak to you,"
  she added a little sharply, as the man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I do not know the gentleman, Mademoiselle," he regretted.</p>

  <p>"Nor, it seems, does anyone else," she complained. "He keeps his yacht in
  Garoupe Bay. It is called the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. Does that assist?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know him," the coiffeur repeated The manicurist paused for a
  moment at her task.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," she confided eagerly, "I do not know the gentleman of whom
  you speak, but I have seen him several times with a very good client of mine,
  Mademoiselle de Montelimar, the daughter of the Marquise de Montelimar. One
  has heard a rumour that they are fiances."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a young man is he?" The manicurist shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He is of fine appearance&mdash;tall and strong," she said. "He speaks
with an
  American accent. He appears <i>gentil</i>. Mademoiselle kept him waiting once
  for a quarter of an hour, and he was not like these short tempered English.
  He only laughed."</p>

  <p>"You have not seen him to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-day, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"<i>Ecoute, ma chere</i>," Tanya said, leaning towards the girl, "If you
  see him while you are here&mdash;wherever I am&mdash;come and tell me. It
shall mean a
  <i>cadeau</i> for you. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Mais parfaitement, Mademoiselle</i>," the girl assented. "If one might
  choose one's <i>cadeau</i> I would value a signed photograph&mdash;just
  Tanya&mdash;more than anything else in the world."</p>

  <p>"Even that shall be arranged," the danseuse promised graciously. "I am
  only here for a day or two. I stay at the Proven&ccedil;al, as my flat was
  blown up with all my clothes. It was very inconvenient."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door. A <i>chasseur</i> entered. He was wearing a
  sky blue uniform and a peaked cap, and he evidently meant to make the best of
  this visit. He approached Tanya's chair before he made the announcement, and
  he regarded her with veneration.</p>

  <p>"It is a gentleman who has called to see Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"He gave you his name?" the <i>danseuse</i> asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He said that his name was Suess, and that he had just arrived from Paris.
  He wears the ribbon of the Legion d'Honneur."</p>

  <p>The enthusiasm died out of Tanya's voice.</p>

  <p>"<i>C'est bien</i>," she said. "It is a gentleman whom I desire to see. He
  can be shown in."</p>

  <p>The boy made a lingering retreat. This visit into Mademoiselle's room,
  with its perfumes and suggestions of the stage, to say nothing of Tanya's own
  daring <i>deshabille</i>, was a moving event. He left reluctantly, but with
  the door once closed, he hurried to the man who was waiting in the
hall&mdash;a
  pale-faced man, with a full, round stomach, short, but with a very upright
  carriage. The man wore spectacles, although the eyes behind them seemed
  bright enough.</p>

  <p>"If you will follow me, Sir," the boy invited.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Suess did as he was bidden. He was wearing a dinner coat and
  white waistcoat, and he carried in his hand a paper bag of flowers. He was
  clean shaven, and his age was not easily guessed. The boy knocked once more
  at the door of the dressing-room and announced the visitor with an air.</p>

  <p>"Gentleman to see Mademoiselle Tanya. Monsieur Suess."</p>

  <p>Tanya turned her head and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Find yourself a place somewhere, Adolf," she begged. "My hair is almost
  finished&mdash;also my nails. You understand that I dance to-night?"</p>

  <p>"All Juan-les-Pins has been telling me so from the walls and from the lips
  of an excited people," Monsieur Suess replied, with a bow. "I will not
  congratulate you upon your success, my dear Tanya. It is inevitable. Still,
  it will be very pleasant to see you once more making wild men of us."</p>

  <p>"I do not think that I should have much luck at that with you, my friend,"
  she observed, leaning forward to look at her hair. "It is not good, but it
  will do," she added, turning to the coiffeur. "Monsieur le Directeur will pay
  you at the caisse, and you, too," she added to the manicurist. "I have no
  costume which would admit of a pocket."</p>

  <p>The two took their leave. Suess, who was not far from the door, shook the
  handle gently after they had left. He took off his gloves and looked round
  the room with keen piercing glances. Tanya threw herself upon a couch. Her
  <i>deshabille</i> would have shocked a man with a different outlook upon
  life. Monsieur Suess was not shocked.</p>

  <p>"We are all right here," she said shortly. "Before we begin let me tell
  you this. If another gentleman is announced&mdash;a Mr. Hamer
Wildburn&mdash;leave me
  at once. It is important that I should see him."</p>

  <p>"<i>L'amour ou les affaires</i>?" Monsieur Suess enquired, with a complete
  absence of jealousy in his tone."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," she answered. "A book of love would be less interesting
  to me than a page of affaires. You should know that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Tanya," he admitted. "You are without a doubt devoted."</p>

  <p>"Tell me how this affair of Lavandou has been received in Paris?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"A disappointment," he announced. "The train was all laid. The blaze
  should have reached the skies. Then came the publication of the letter, the
  interviews with Madame Jacqueline. The thing fizzled out in sneers and
  laughter."</p>

  <p>She moved in her place impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That, although it was known that Lavandou was in the Bureau of Finance,
  that he was practically taking Chauvanne's place during his absence!"</p>

  <p>"There has been no hint at defalcations," he said regretfully. "It does
  not appear that there have been any. We have no Press to compete with theirs.
  We did what we could. No one listened to us."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, you have something else on your mind, comrade," Tanya said,
  "or you would not have come all this way."</p>

  <p>"I have something else in my mind," he confessed. "It is a serious affair.
  All the same, I wish you would not lie three quarters naked before me. You
  know the sort of man I am."</p>

  <p>She shook with barely suppressed laughter. Her face was impish.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know, Adolf," she admitted. "Do I not know? But those things
  arc for afterwards. You men think too much of women."</p>

  <p>"And you women," he growled, with a gleam in his eyes. "It is not for your
  own pleasure that you writhe in those shreds of clothing, that you have
  always the air of longing to kick them off! A man works better who is not
  starved."</p>

  <p>She caught up a beautifully embroidered opera cloak, wrapped it around her
  tightly and clutched it with one hand.</p>

  <p>"Now, a truce to your complaints, Adolf," she enjoined. "You had more than
  this to tell me or you would not have come. The other things are for
  afterwards&mdash;if at all. I do not know. It depends upon my mood."</p>

  <p>"You wrote to us of the man Chicotin." Her face darkened."</p>

  <p>"Another fool who had great things within his grasp and lost his head
  about me!" she scoffed. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"You know what Berthold was in Marseilles for?"</p>

  <p>"He said he came to see me," she said. "There was other business, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Berthold was not like me," Suess confided. "He loved you well enough but
  he never wholly trusted you."</p>

  <p>"The man is a fool," she answered carelessly, "who ever trusts wholly any
  woman."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes ask myself whether you are a woman," he snarled. "I think you
  are a wild animal&mdash;a tigress. I think blood is more to you than love. You
  have no sentiment&mdash;no softness. Bah, I could spit!"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"But, you won't, dear Adolf," she mocked him. "You know very well that it
  is I who fire your blood&mdash;who make you feel like great deeds."</p>

  <p>"Well, let us speak now seriously," Suess continued sullenly. "There is
  something else to be done. Berthold believed that Tositi left a written
  confession somewhere in Marseilles. Not only a confession for himself but the
  confession of his confederates."</p>

  <p>"It has had something to do with a ship, then," Tanya declared. "He was
  always down around the docks."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," Suess admitted. "It had something to do with a
  ship. Berthold got as far as that when, as you know, the police made a swoop
  upon him. I will not say that Berthold had not earned the scaffold, but they
  gave him no chance. They executed him within a few hours for a crime that was
  never proved against him. They wanted him out of the world just as they
  wanted Tositi out of the world and just as they will want you or me out of
  the world if we discover the truth."</p>

  <p>"They won't get rid of me like that," Tanya scoffed. "I have escaped from
  prison three times always the same way. There are no doors will remain closed
  on me if men are the gaolers."</p>

  <p>Suess shivered. In his heart he believed that Tanya was telling the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he went on. "Berthold discovered the name of the boat on which
  is hidden this secret. It is the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. Tositi had it
  built, for himself and some woman."</p>

  <p>"Everything is clear to me now," Tanya announced, sitting up. "You are not
  all fools at headquarters, Adolf. You have discovered something. If the
  confession of Tositi and his friends, or any part of the story of their
  doings, really exists, it is on a yacht not half a dozen kilometres from this
  spot!"</p>

  <p>"Who owns it?" Suess demanded.</p>

  <p>"A young American&mdash;Hamer Wildburn," she declared. "He looks too
honest to
  be anything but stupid, but I have written to him. I have asked him to come
  and see me, either before the show or after. I think it will be after the
  show. He will come to that, and he will not keep away."</p>

  <p>"You are certainly as seductive as ever, you little beast," Suess
  admitted. "You are also more conceited. As for me, I only find you fairly
  well."</p>

  <p>"Oh, la, la," she laughed. "A few moments ago you were shivering. If I had
  not put this coat on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing. Only I know the signs when a man is nearly losing his
  head."</p>

  <p>"You have an idea to work upon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If the young man comes to me, the confession will be mine," she said. "If
  he does not come, I shall visit the boat in the night. If he will not give me
  the papers&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;I shall stab him, like I did
Chicotin,
  by-the-by, and help myself. I am very clever at that."</p>

  <p>"And if you are arrested?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall say that it was in self-defence," she said coolly. "I shall be
  tried by jury. I shall probably dine at night, when it is all over, with the
  Judge, and I shall have enough flowers for a palace. I have always rather
  fancied myself as the heroine of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>."</p>

  <p>"And if you succeed?"</p>

  <p>"You will find me either here, at the Proven&ccedil;al, or in the little
  dancing place next door," she replied. "There will be serious business afoot
  then. Are you ready for it, Adolf Suess? That is what I ask myself. There
  will be far more danger in success than failure."</p>

  <p>"If you can implicate Chauvanne or any one of the Ministers&mdash;Edouard
  Mermillon would be the best of all&mdash;the train is still ready. The fires
could
  be lit in a matter of seconds," he answered.</p>

  <p>"But money&mdash;how about money?" she asked. "It would require a woman
to ask
  a question so foolish," he scoffed. "There will be a mob of a hundred
  thousand loose in Paris and there will be ten thousand sane men to look after
  them. We know where to put our hands upon all the money we shall need, my
  little one. We must use the mob. It will be the same in every city in France.
  But we have brains as well, remember. We can put into the Chamber at least
  three Governments who would rule this country on the finest Soviet
  principles. It is not going to be a muddled affair. I can assure you of that.
  We have men ready for every post. The mob shall have their way up to a
  certain point, but the mob do not know where to look for the real loot. The
  banks will be our affair."</p>

  <p>"I wonder who will look after me?" Tanya speculated.</p>

  <p>"The wisest man," Suess said, rising to his feet, "will be the man who
  leaves you alone."</p>

  <p>She laughed and threw her slipper after his disappearing figure. Bare
  legged and with the opera cloak slipping from her shoulders, she chased him
  out of the room, throwing his hat after him. Then she flung herself into a
  chair and rang a handbell vigorously.</p>

  <p>"My bath," she called to the woman who made an unexpectedly swift
  appearance. "My half bottle of champagne, my dry biscuits, my cigarettes. In
  an hour I must dance. Wait on me quickly, Aimee. To-night I must be
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>"More diamonds to-night," the old woman cried with a satyr-like grin.</p>

  <p>"Serious business to-night, my old pet," Tanya declared, springing to her
  feet. "In a week's time the diamonds may be for you, and for
me&mdash;this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stretched up her hands suddenly, arched her feet, and she danced. She
  danced softly at first and quietly. She crept like a cat, she sprang like a
  tigress. Then she seemed to be standing quite still. It was only her body
  that moved. Her eyes seemed to be piercing the ceiling. Then she became
  rigid. She was absolutely motionless. Her hands dropped to her sides. Her
  eyes became glazed. The fingers of one hand sought her throat. It was death
  that visited her...She drew a little breath.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand that, Grannie."</p>

  <p>The woman mumbled something. Tanya moved to the table, picked up a
  biscuit, and bit into it with her strong white teeth.</p>

  <p>"Open the wine, Grannie," she directed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

  <p class="first">That night, once more Tanya danced to the enthusiastic
plaudits of a huge
  audience. It was said, with absolute truth, that on that particular night she
  created a perfect furore. There were men, and women, too, wedged in amongst
  the crowds standing up in the background, who forgot themselves and their
  manners, in a wild struggle to force themselves into some place where they
  could catch a glimpse of that struggling phantasy of a black gown, the white
  limbs, scarlet lips, and blazing, eyes&mdash;calling, and calling, and
calling. An
  elderly <i>boulevardier</i> of the last decade made his escape mopping his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"My Heaven!" he exclaimed. "It is like when Cleo danced for those three
  weeks of her madness. Men fought their way on to the stage. They had to have
  a guard for her. That woman is a she devil, I tell you! There was, never a
  lady of the pavement who pleaded so eloquently as she."</p>

  <p>But there were others, colder critics, who fancied that they detected that
  night an uneasiness in Tanya's movements. Her eyes searched everywhere for
  something they failed to find. In her dressing-room afterwards, both bolts of
  the door firmly fastened, she flung her frock away and cursed like a mad
  person. Adolf Suess, smoking a cigar, her sole companion, watched her in
  amusement.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pas de chance, petite,</i>" he murmured looking, at her with twinkling
  eyes as he lit a cigarette. "<i>Et le souper, hein</i>?"</p>

  <p>She flashed round upon him.</p>

  <p>"You are a black-hearted pig." she shouted You think more of your stomach
  than your <i>patrie</i>!"</p>

  <p>"And you, little one, think more of your hurt vanity than your failure
  here."</p>

  <p>"And you call yourself a deputy," she cried. "You are supposed to
  represent forty thousand eager Communists. You represent nothing except your
  appetite."</p>

  <p>Suess was shivering a little, but he laughed at her. "I am the gentleman
  who prefers the blonde," he said. "I know your tricks too well, little Tanya.
  You would never tear the soul out of my body, and this man you want&mdash;he
will
  not come near you."</p>

  <p>"A great compliment, my dear. He is afraid."</p>

  <p>"Go and ring the bell three times," she told him. "I need Aimee."</p>

  <p>"Shall I help?" he asked, with an unpleasant grin.</p>

  <p>She stood facing him, her arms akimbo, but defiance in every feature.</p>

  <p>"If you came near me, if you put your filthy hands within reach," she
  cried, "I would forget La Patrie for the first time in my life. Except that I
  fear you might be some small loss to her, I would stick a knife in your back!
  Remember that, and do what I tell you. Ring for Aimee."</p>

  <p>He moistened his dry lips and obeyed. Presently there was a sound of
  voices outside the door, Aimee's grumbling and protesting. She
knocked&mdash;three
  times quickly and then twice. Satisfied, Tanya unfastened the door and peered
  out. Aimee slipped in. Tanya was on the point of closing the door when she
  recognised a face in the background.</p>

  <p>"Tanya, don't be so cruel," a young man with pallid features and
  straw-coloured hair drawled. "There's Francois St. Pierre here and two other
  of my fellow-guests from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. The little restaurant at
  Garoupe keeps open for you. Supper is all ordered. If you disappoint us we
  will come and howl the show down to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>She laughed mockingly.</p>

  <p>"Poor little boys," she jeered. "What could you do against the crowd of
  those who love my art? You would be thrown out. Nevertheless, the thought of
  supper is good. You are sure we can have it at Garoupe?'"</p>

  <p>"One hour," the young man with straw-coloured hair, the Duc de Montesset
  declared with emphasis, "it took us to persuade Monsieur and Madame Crestner
  to keep their place open. There is a bouillabaisse there cooked, by the chef
  from Marseilles, and there's a pate that came from Montpellier."</p>

  <p>"Shall I make myself beautiful or shall I come to you like a guttersnipe?"
  she asked. "I can do either. The guttersnipe will be quicker."</p>

  <p>"Let it be so," the Duc replied. "Come as yourself."</p>

  <p>"You pay for that later on, Monsieur le Duc, when that nice looking friend
  of yours sits on the other side!" she threatened.</p>

  <p>"Be off with you to the bar in the baccarat room. I will be there in
  twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>She slammed the door and bolted it.</p>

  <p>"Wash the stuff off me, Aimee," she ordered. "Make me, if you can, like
  the girl going to her first communion! Perhaps to-night I get a little
  revenge. Who can tell?"</p>

  <p>Aimee took possession. Tanya opened her eyes a few seconds later to find
  Suess still there.</p>

  <p>"Get out!'" she ordered. "Haven't you heard? My plans for the evening are
  made. Why do you sit there staring at me? Go and play with some of the little
  <i>poules</i> in the bar."</p>

  <p>"So there is to be no supper?'" he asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Not with you, <i>mon vieux</i>," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"How will these others help you?" he grumbled. "I thought to-night all was
  to be for La Patrie."</p>

  <p>"You fool!"' she answered. "You think of nothing but yourself. What do I
  care for those boys? The man with whom I am going to supper, the Due de
  Montesset, he is the unfortunate suitor of Mademoiselle de Montelimar, and it
  is Monsieur Hamer Wildburn who is his rival. Monsieur Hamer Wildburn will not
  come to me. Perhaps something may be done through one who hates him."</p>

  <p>"This business may be all a legend," Suess declared, rising unwillingly to
  his feet.</p>

  <p>"<i>Zut</i>, you have the brains of a rabbit!" she cried. "I go&mdash;I
ask no
  questions. I just see and I know. Fifty yards away from the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i> is a Government gunboat with naked guns and a searchlight. In a
  villa on the hill opposite is the great General, the one strong man of
  France&mdash;would to Heaven he belonged to us!&mdash;watching, and between
him and the
  gunboat Edouard Mermillon in his yacht&mdash;watching. No one dare move by
force.
  No one knows exactly how to move, but I am going to find out, Adolf Suess,
  and it will not be by force."</p>

  <p>"And later?"</p>

  <p>"There will be no later," she answered fiercely. "Go and wait till the
  morning. If there is anything to be told&mdash;you are my official
chief&mdash;you will
  know it. After that&mdash;Marseilles and Paris and Lyons must be told
  simultaneously. If I succeed the end begins. You have the article written
  attacking the authenticity of Lavandou's dying letter? You have the statement
  from Madame Jacqueline?"</p>

  <p>"I know my business," the man growled. "If you succeed&mdash;I laugh when I
  think of your success&mdash;two of the papers which have the largest
circulation
  in France will publish both. The revolution will commence to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet&mdash;unrecognisable, pale, with dark spiritual
eyes, the
  exquisite shape of her body nowhere concealed by the simple black robe which
  was all she wore.</p>

  <p>"To think," she meditated, "that one man's obstinacy stands between us and
  triumph. I will give," she went on, and for a moment she seemed almost like a
  religious devotee before the altar, although the pagan words were trembling
  upon her lips. "I will give more than I have ever given any man or any human
  being before in my life. I will kill myself in his arms afterwards if he
  wishes it, or live for him for ever, or just as gladly, if I can get what I
  want that way. I will murder him without blenching. Farewell, Adolf. If you
  still worship the black gods of Madagascar get down on your knees and
  pray."</p>

  <p>It was a wild supper party in strange surroundings. The restaurant was
  little more than a shed built to offer luncheon and dinner to the bourgeoisie
  of Nice, situated upon the <i>plage</i> itself, and in the very shadow of the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>. The tables were merely wooden planks upon trestles, the
  chairs hard, except that Tanya sat upon a great pile of cushions enthroned
  like a queen. Tablecloths and napkins were of course linen, but all was
  scrupulously clean. The cutlery was crude. Everywhere was the impression of
  an almost barbaric simplicity. Nevertheless, Monsieur le Patron's chickens
  were famous and his <i>langouste a l'Am&eacute;ricaine</i> and
  <i>bouillabaisse</i> unsurpassed. At this hour in the morning there was only
  one waiter, beside Monsieur and Madame, to wait upon their guests, but never
  was a supper party received with so much acclamation. Never did gaiety soar
  to such heights. The champagne&mdash;very good champagne, too&mdash;flowed
like water.
  Tanya, in turn voluptuous and spiritual, was an inspiration. There were seven
  in the party and five were already demented with drink and enthusiasm. Only
  Montesset sat by her side coldly sober, his strangely coloured eyes flaming
  all the time with an icy passion. She judged the time ripe and she leaned
  over and whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Where is the American to-night&mdash;the fiance they say of Mademoiselle
de
  Montelimar?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens knows. On his boat, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"And Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"She and the Marquise are at Monte Carlo. They are passing the night
  there. We invited the young man to come with us to your show, but he
  refused."</p>

  <p>"Pig," she answered. "Listen, Guy. It pleases you, this
party&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"There are too many of us," he said. "It pleases me because I am next to
  you, and soon they will go away."</p>

  <p>"I, too," she whispered. "I wait for that. I want to ruffle that wonderful
  hair of yours, and I want&mdash;well, for that I can wait no longer."</p>

  <p>She leaned over and kissed him upon the lips. His arms would have closed
  wildly around her, but she sat up with a laugh just in time.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," she cried. "Let us go out and wake this sleeping hermit
  who will not come to see me dance."</p>

  <p>There was a burst of applause from everyone except Montesset. A spot of
  colour was burning in his cheeks. His hands, which had been perfectly steady
  a moment before, shook as he raised his glass to his lips.</p>

  <p>"I think the party has lasted long enough," he pronounced. "You fellows
  are all at home. The <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> is only two hundred yards up the
  drive. I shall take Mademoiselle back to Juan."</p>

  <p>"Not yet," they shouted almost in unison. "We can't part with
  Mademoiselle. Tanya!"</p>

  <p>They all stood up and drank to her. They threw the empty glasses with a
  crash upon the floor and called for fresh ones. The patron made a note of the
  number broken, and promptly supplied them.</p>

  <p>"Listen," Tanya said. "I agree with you others. Guy shall drive me home
  presently, but not yet. Guy is my love. Let us take boats and board this
  fierce American and make him join us. If he refuses we will make him
  swim."</p>

  <p>The roar of applause might almost have awakened Hamer in his bunk.</p>

  <p>"Has he plenty to drink," one man demanded, "or shall we take champagne on
  board?"</p>

  <p>"Take champagne." Tanya advised. "We will be on the safe side."</p>

  <p>They trooped down to the edge of the <i>plage</i>. The moon was a little
  misty, but there was still light. They packed bottles of champagne in the
  bows of a heavy cutter, and bestowed themselves upon the seats. The patron, a
  little doubtfully, started them off. Montesset and Tanya sat in the aft seat
  together.</p>

  <p>"You are not happy?" Tanya whispered, squeezing his arm.</p>

  <p>"I am impatient," he answered. "I am not sure that this is not a foolish
  business, although we are all drunk, so it doesn't matter. The American has
  not our temperament, however. He may be disagreeable."</p>

  <p>She laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>"He will forget all that," she declared, "when he sees the present which
  we have brought him."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Hamer sat suddenly up in his bed. He slept always with his
door open, and
  he was conscious of a dark figure blotting out the moonlight. His visitor
  tapped at the door, and a familiar voice hailed him.</p>

  <p>"There's a boatload of young people from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> here,
  sir," his <i>matelot</i> announced.</p>

  <p>"From the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>," Hamer repeated incredulously. "Why, it's
  3 o'clock. What on earth do they want, Auguste?"</p>

  <p>"If you ask me, sir, I think they want a drink. There's the young Duke
  there amongst them, and two or three of the other gentlemen who have been on
  board with Mademoiselle. There's a pinnace from the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> here, too. They seem to keep an eye on us all
  the night. I told the bo'sun to lie to until you came up on deck."</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn wrapped himself in his dressing gown and ran lightly up the
  steps. The two boats&mdash;the boat from the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> a
  little in the background&mdash;were both on the starboard side. Hamer was
greeted
  at once with cheers as he made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, you fellows?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Sorry if we're a nuisance," Montesset drawled. "The fact is we've been
  having supper on the <i>plage</i> there, and we thought we'd come out and see
  you. Do you feel inclined to offer us a drink? If not, we'll offer you one.
  We've got some champagne here."</p>

  <p>"Very nice of you," Wildburn observed, with a marked absence of
  enthusiasm, "but isn't it a bit late for this sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we're making a night of it." Montesset replied "There's no one at
  home at the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, as I dare say you know. We have been having
  supper down on the <i>plage</i>. Can we come up?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you may," Hamer invited. "Let down the gangway, Auguste, and go
  back to sleep. Tell the men from the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> that it's
  all right. These are friends from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>."</p>

  <p>They came clambering up the steps. Hamer started when he saw the slight
  figure in black emerge from the obscurity and spring on deck.</p>

  <p>"This," the Duke announced, "is the most marvellous artiste upon the
  French stage&mdash;Mademoiselle Tanya Vizille. She has been dancing to-night
at
  Juan and driving the people crazy. Since then she has had supper with us down
  here."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I wished Monsieur to come and see me dance," she said reproachfully, "but
  I looked for him and he was not there. Is it not your English saying that if
  Mahomet will not come to the mountain the mountain must go to Mahomet? You
  see&mdash;I am here."</p>

  <p>"But understand, Hamer, my friend," Montesset declared, lurching forward,
  "My mountain. You are my mountain, aren't you, Tanya?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I am the mountain of whom I love for the moment," she confided.
  "Sometimes I change my mind. Sometimes there come feelings which carry one
  away and the world changes, and if the world changes the woman in it must
  change too."</p>

  <p>"Well, this all sounds very nice," Hamer remarked as good-humouredly as he
  knew how. "What do you want to drink?'' Where will you sit? Out on deck or
  down in the saloon? I think perhaps we had better go below. We have a gunboat
  within hearing of us and a famous French statesman who is here for a
  rest."</p>

  <p>"I should like to go below," Tanya said softly. "I should like to see more
  of your boat, Mr. Wildburn."</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about the famous French statesman," Montesset observed.
  "He flew to Paris this morning. The suicide of Chauvanne's understudy, I
  expect. However, Mademoiselle wishes to go below. Come along."</p>

  <p>Wildburn led the way. They seated themselves, with some difficulty, round
  his small table in the salon. He waved their contributions on one side,
  produced champagne and opened it. They drank to his health. One of the crowd
  sang a song.</p>

  <p>"You must please sit down," Tanya whispered to her host. "Near me,
  please."</p>

  <p>Hamer produced a stool and seated himself upon it. Tanya's hand slipped
  into his. He lifted it on to the table and left his own upon it. Montesset
  watched with a scowl.</p>

  <p>"Your champagne is wonderful, Monsieur Hamer," Tanya said, smiling at him.
  "I drink to your health and to your boat&mdash;the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> you
  call it&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>Hamer drank with her. Montesset left his glass untouched.</p>

  <p>"I was disappointed," the girl continued, "that Monsieur did not come and
  see me me dance."</p>

  <p>"I have heard all about it," Hamer said courteously. "I am told that
  well-brought-up and respectable young men go perfectly insane when they watch
  you. From all I have heard I think that perhaps I was wise not to go."</p>

  <p>"Why were you wise.'"</p>

  <p>"Because I had the marvellous good fortune to become engaged only a day or
  so ago," he told her.</p>

  <p>"That is very pleasant," she admitted. "All young men must become engaged.
  All young men must marry and found families, but there is no reason why the
  moments of insanity should not continue sometimes. Every passion that makes
  the heart beat faster is good for men&mdash;and women too. Besides, they say
that
  you Americans keep women too far away from your hearts even when you bring
  them into your homes. I am a great artist at playing upon the heart-strings,
  Monsieur Hamer."</p>

  <p>"If you are going to talk this sort of rubbish I'm off on deck," Montesset
  said, a little roughly. It's too hot down here anyway."</p>

  <p>"Do." Tanya begged. "All of you go. Mr. Wildburn and I will follow
  directly. I have something to say to him."</p>

  <p>"So this is why you brought us here!"</p>

  <p>Montesset exclaimed, a furious light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Guy," she said, and there was a note of warning in her tone, "you risk
  everything when you talk to me like that. I am in earnest when I tell you
  that I have something I wish to say to Mr. Wildburn. If you think that I am
  going to ask him to make love to me you are wrong. What I have to say to him
  deals with other matters. Now will you go?"</p>

  <p>"Come on Guy," a young cousin of Montelimar's who was by far the soberest
  of the party, enjoined. "Wildburn's all right. He's not like us poor
  simple-hearted Frenchmen who go crazy for the sake of a great artist in love,
  like Tanya. Besides, he's engaged to Lucienne all right. I am to be one of
  the witnesses."</p>

  <p>Still grumbling, Guy led the way on to the deck. Hamer Wildburn looked
  curiously at his companion.</p>

  <p>"You wrote me to come to the show, to come to your room or to the
  Proven&ccedil;al," he reminded her abruptly. "I am very much flattered, Miss
  Tanya, because I know that you are a great artist. But what do you want with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult," she complained, "and I have so little time."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right about that," he agreed. You will have Montesset down
  here in a minute. He doesn't like your leaving him. Please tell me quickly
  what it is."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Wildburn" she said, and probably not one single soul amongst her
  thousands of admirers would have recognised her voice or herself as she
  spoke. "I have a religion. That religion is worship of my country, because I
  believe that she is being led to ruin. I am a Communist. I believe that only
  the Communists can save France."</p>

  <p>"What!" Hamer Wildburn exclaimed. What on earth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must take me seriously," she begged. "Communism may mean many things.
  You don't understand what it does mean. It means the giving of real liberty
  to people who are being deceived and robbed every day of their lives. It
  means giving the people liberty to breathe upon their own soil the air of the
  country they love&mdash;free men and free women with the right to live and the
  right to the means of living."</p>

  <p>"That is very sensibly said," he acknowledged. "But my deal Mademoiselle
  Tanya, at this time of the night with a lover aching for you on board, why
  start a discussion of this sort with me?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she explained, "by some diabolical chance you can render the
  Communists of France the greatest service in the world."</p>

  <p>"I?" Wildburn cried.</p>

  <p>"You. Not because you are yourself but because you are the owner of the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>."</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn for a moment was devoid of words. He struck the table with
  his hands so that the glasses rattled.</p>

  <p>"What!" he exclaimed "The boat again."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted. "It is the boat again. I do not suppose that I am the
  first person in the world to ask what I am going to ask you. You want it out
  short. I will try. Berthold, my comrade, who was executed in Marseilles, he
  gave me the hint. Something&mdash;signed papers, cheques&mdash;something in
writing,
  exists upon this boat which would break the bourgeois Government of France,
  which would set France on fire from one end to the other, which would deliver
  her into our hands&mdash;into the hands of the Communists. We have a
Government
  ready to step in. We have every means at hand and [are] prepared to stop the
  worst developments of revolution. We want what you have here on the <i>Bird
  of Paradise</i> to start it."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear young lady," Hamer Wildburn protested, "I have heard
  something of this before but not so eloquently put. I have been all over the
  ship myself. I have searched in every possible place. I can assure you that
  there is nothing the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> can reveal which would help you
  in the least."</p>

  <p>"You think not," she smiled incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Listen I know more than you do. I cannot go direct to the spot, but I
  have a hint, an idea. Give me three hours alone here, whenever you like. Oh,
  if you were one of that crowd upstairs, if you were a man like all these
  others, I would ask you what reward you needed. If you wanted me I would be
  your slave for the rest of my days. If you wanted money you should have it
  year by year from the new Government. Your name should be enshrined as one of
  the benefactors of France. There is nothing that you could ask for that
  should not come to you in the future There is nothing from me that you could
  not have in the present. But give me those three hours!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry Mademoiselle Tanya," Hamer said firmly. "But in the terse
  language of my country&mdash;there's nothing doing. I hate the principles of
  Communism, although I admit I never heard them put so sweetly as you have
  done, but I should not run any risks. If I thought there was anything hidden
  on my boat which would cause such an upheaval in the country as you suggest,
  I should find it myself and I should consider in whose hands to place
  it."</p>

  <p>There was a disturbance of voices on deck. Montesset came down the
  companionway dangerously quiet.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted on deck, Hamer Wildburn," he announced. "Tanya, you come
  with me. This thing has gone far enough."</p>

  <p>She pointed to her companion, who had risen to his feet.</p>

  <p>"If he asks me to stay," she said, "I would never leave him for the rest
  of my life. He will not give me what I want, but he is at least a man."</p>

  <p>They mounted on deck. Hamer was conscious from the first moment that he
  was moving in an atmosphere of animosity. They were all Montesset's friends
  and they all seemed to resent Tanya's attitude. Montesset stepped forward and
  held Tanya for the moment by the wrist.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" he demanded. ''You are my guest. It is I who
  brought you here. You are coming with me."</p>

  <p>"Take your hand away," she ordered. "I shall only go because I must. If
  Monsieur Wildburn there invites me to stay I remain."</p>

  <p>"Upon this boat."</p>

  <p>"Upon this boat?"</p>

  <p>"With him&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>"With him alone," she repeated. "For to-night and as long as he chooses to
  keep me."</p>

  <p>"Look here," Hamer intervened. "Don't let there be any misunderstanding
  about this. Mademoiselle Tanya does not care about me, nor I about her. She
  has an idea that I will permit her to stay and search my boat for heaven
  knows what if she offers me, what I understand," he added, with perhaps a
  faint show of sarcasm, "belongs, Montesset, to you. Take her away, all of
  you. She and I have nothing to do with one another. Mademoiselle is a very
  charming and talented young lady, with great gifts, but nothing which she
  could say would induce me to keep her on this boat for ten minutes longer
  than is necessary. Is that plain enough?"</p>

  <p>There was a new fire now in Tanya's eyes; a very wicked fire it was.
  Trouble&mdash;there must be trouble at any cost.</p>

  <p>"I hear," she said sadly. "It is not quite what he said downstairs, but if
  he insists that I must go, I must go. Another time may do very well for him.
  It suits me not at all."</p>

  <p>"So you mean to come back another time?" the Duke demanded.</p>

  <p>She looked timidly up at Hamer.</p>

  <p>"Whenever he wants me," she assented. "Whenever he will send for me.
  Whenever he will let me come."</p>

  <p>Montesset turned round to his friends.</p>

  <p>"Have we not rather forgotten how we proposed to wind up the evening?" he
  reminded them. "We thought of inviting Mr. Wildburn to take a swim with
  us?"</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It will teach him to keep his hands off other people's property," someone
  else muttered.</p>

  <p>"You must not hurt him." Tanya insisted.</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn took off his dressing gown. "I am not inclined to swim with
  you," he said. "You came on my boat uninvited guests and I beg you to leave
  it&mdash;all of you&mdash;and take Mademoiselle with you."</p>

  <p>Montesset moved forward.</p>

  <p>"We wish you to go with us," he confided. "There is a little lesson you
  should learn."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Montesset," Hamer rejoined angrily, "you are all drunk. Get
  away and take the girl with you. I hate hitting a smaller man than myself,
  but you are for it if this goes on any longer."</p>

  <p>Montesset sprang towards him. Two of the others came on either side. The
  other two struggled to find a place. Montesset went down like a log with a
  straight left-hander which caught him on the point of the jaw, and the right
  was ready for his successor as he came along. The cousin of the Montelimars
  made a lunging blow at Hamer, a signet ring on his finger, and cut into his
  cheek. In another moment he was over the side. The two who were left on their
  feet paused. Wildburn had had enough hesitation. He closed with both of them.
  One, a heavy fellow, the most drunken of the lot, he knocked down without the
  slightest difficulty. The other one, too small to hit, who was already fading
  away, he caught up round the middle and threw over the side.</p>

  <p>"Now, out you go," he ordered Montesset, who was sitting up, and his
  friend who was trying to struggle to his feet. "Quick! Both of you."</p>

  <p>Montesset swayed for a moment, and then rushed in.</p>

  <p>"This is your trouble&mdash;not mine," Hamer declared, easily, evading
his wild
  blows. "You are drunk&mdash;all of you. You can't fight. You can have all of
this
  medicine you like."</p>

  <p>After those first few moments there was only a blundering resistance.
  Wildburn had seen them all swim, and he was reckless. One by one he pushed or
  threw them overboard, and drew up the steps to which Montesset was already
  hanging.</p>

  <p>"Get into your boat and clear out," he shouted, as he shook him loose. "If
  any one of you wants a hiding in the morning you can have it. You are too
  drunk now."</p>

  <p>Montesset, a ludicrous-looking object, his hair plastered down over his
  face, his clothes clinging to him, stood up and shook his fist. He shouted,
  but he seemed to have lost control over his voice. What he said was
  incomprehensible. One by one he pulled the others into the cutter.</p>

  <p>"Be off with you," Wildburn called out. "What are you doing hanging around
  here?"</p>

  <p>They rowed a few strokes and still waited, then very slowly they dipped
  their oars again and went off shorewards. His last glimpse of them, all
  shouting and talking amongst themselves, puzzled Hamer for the moment. He had
  a vague feeling that he had forgotten something. Suddenly he felt something
  clinging softly to his arm, a little body pressed against his, an inch or two
  of fine muslin with one of the world's newest perfumes pressed against his
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"You are a brave man, Monsieur Wildburn," Tanya murmured. "If you will
  come downstairs I will bathe your cheek. He was <i>m&eacute;chant</i>, that
  man with the ring. He struck you when you were not looking. Soon I will bind
  it up for you very nicely."</p>

  <p>He stared down at her in amazement. He realised suddenly what it was he
  had forgotten. He had forgotten Tanya.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

  <p class="first">A very soft voice sounded in his ear as he remained for the
moment
  thunderstruck.</p>

  <p>"And so I remain, Monsieur Hamer."</p>

  <p>He opened his lips and, if he had spoken at the moment of his intention,
  the words would have been very decisive and more than a little harsh, but
  looking downwards it seemed to him that he was discovering a new Tanya. Out
  of her pale, beautifully shaped face her eyes were shining pleadingly,
  sweetly up into his. The <i>diablerie</i> had gone from her. Something had
  taken its place&mdash;something which mocked his intelligence to give it a
  name.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Hamer," she pleaded, "you permit me to stay a little time? I
  talk with you out here on the deck. First I go down below. I fetch a towel. I
  bathe your cheek because the blood runs on to your neck. I do that well, for
  I am a good nurse. Then we talk for a few moments, please. You will hear a
  Tanya speak to you whom the world has never heard before."</p>

  <p>A few seconds ago Hamer had fancied himself proof against all the pleading
  and all the lure in the world, yet at her words he seemed nerveless. He felt
  like a man who holds in his hands a butterfly and fears to crush it.</p>

  <p>"All right," he agreed. "My cheek does smart a bit."</p>

  <p>She walked quickly towards the companionway and disappeared. His eyes
  followed her critically&mdash;dubiously. There were no tricks with her
skirt, no
  backward turn of the head, none of that quaint swaying of the body which
  seemed a heritage of her dancing. She walked swiftly and with a sylphlike
  grace, but she walked as any other woman of her charm would have done. Hamer
  sat down upon a bench and looked out across the expanse of darkened sea.</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed to himself. "This girl is a witch."</p>

  <p>She was some little time before she reappeared. When she did so she had a
  damp towel hanging over her shoulder, a sponge between her fingers, and a
  glass with something that fizzed in her hand.</p>

  <p>"You drank nothing," she said, as she came to him. "I watched you. You
  drink now half a glass of wine."</p>

  <p>"And you?" he asked. She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am like you," she said. "I drink because it serves my purpose. If I
  lived the life of an ordinary human being&mdash;oh, how wonderful it would
be&mdash;I
  should be like others. My single aperitif, my glass of white wine, my glass
  of champagne, perhaps, for dinner. But fate has me tied. I live as I
  must...Your head on one side, please. So."</p>

  <p>With gentle fingers she bathed his wound, looked at it critically, placed
  upon it a square compress and two pieces of sticking plaster.</p>

  <p>"I think that is best," she decided. "The disinfectant may hurt for a
  minute. It will soon be well. You drink your wine&mdash;yes? And now, Mr.
Hamer
  Wildburn, because I feel at any moment you may want to send me from your
  boat, I talk to you as one human being to another&mdash;yes'"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he answered</p>

  <p>"Forget all that you have thought of me," she continued. "Forget that I
  tried to win you over to do my will in the way that other women try. I am not
  good&mdash;I do not pretend that&mdash;but I do not wish to do evil. The
sacrifices I
  make I make because I have big things in my heart."</p>

  <p>"You are a very extraordinary person," he acknowledged, "but if you want
  to be turned loose on this boat as you told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush." she interrupted. "Let me finish. I was not born like that, but I
  have become heart and soul a slave to one burning desire&mdash;to work in the
  cause of freedom for the people in this world who have never known freedom,
  but chiefly for the people in the next world who are to come, who might
  breathe a different air and might climb instead of stumbling all the way
  through the foul places. There is no name for the need of us who are in
  earnest. Communism will do as well as any other. But what we want, those of
  us who are so much in earnest and the thousand who are not for more selfish
  reasons, perhaps, is to chase away from control this bourgeois money-grabbing
  Government, and put in a Government of men who are willing to work, not to
  enrich themselves, but to build the foundations of the future race in
  different fashion."</p>

  <p>He looked at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Russian," he said.</p>

  <p>"And I am a Russian," she answered. "Perhaps some day I will tell you my
  real name. I am Russian. I have lived in Russia since the Soviet. I have
  watched the crude beginnings of what will come in fifty years' time&mdash;a
  glorious climax. I have watched the mistakes we have all deplored. I have
  watched the miserable futility, the cruelty, the wickedness, the
  bloodthirstiness of the birth of a new faith, and I am going to say of a new
  religion. Because I criticised I had to flee for my life. I joined some
  people, but they had as little as I had. I drifted into becoming a member of
  what they call The Circle here&mdash;the Communists. Russia was badly
treated in
  the old days, Mr. Wildburn. It had a cruel and ignorant aristocracy, who
  became the ruin of the country, but who are responsible for the coming of the
  Soviet. France has a greedy and ignorant bourgeoisie who will be responsible
  for the coming of the French Soviet."</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to convert me to a new faith?" he asked, in a very
  different tone to any he had ever used to her before.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I could not do that. You are an Anglo-Saxon. You are too
  fixed, you are too honest to make believe, you have that terrible facility
  for taking things as they are. I could do nothing with you, Hamer Wildburn.
  You are too strong for me. All that I could hope for would be that you should
  realise that I am in earnest. I will tell you what I want from you in plainer
  words than you have ever been told by anyone else, and then you will
  reflect&mdash;you will think perhaps that you would do not much harm if you
helped
  me."</p>

  <p>He moved uneasily in his place.</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to believe, my dear young lady," he observed, "that I and
  the whole world may be mistaken about you. If that is so it is your own
  fault. On the other hand, so far as regards the concrete thing which you ask
  of me&mdash;the possession of this boat&mdash;that is an impossibility."</p>

  <p>She waved his words away.</p>

  <p>"This boat was built by Tositi," she confided. "He, with all his faults,
  was a man of imagination. He loved the sea and he loved the woman for whom he
  built it. She cared little for him, perhaps, but she saw through him the
  means to an end."</p>

  <p>All the time the sea lapped gently against the sides of the yacht. The
  long straight beam from the Antibcs lighthouse flashed across its sullen
  surface and across the sleeping hills. Of found there was none. The world
  slept.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," he begged.</p>

  <p>"Tositi, it is true," she admitted, "was the tool of many men in greater
  positions than he, but he was their willing tool. He was their deliberate
  accomplice. All his life his great ambition had been to move in the greater
  places of the world. He had no ideals. He was nothing of a dreamer. He was a
  clod of a man, but he had the greedy ambitions of the egotist. He wanted the
  applause of the multitude without being capable of doing or producing
  anything to deserve it."</p>

  <p>"That is a poor epitaph for a man," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"It was given to me to see the truth about him," she answered. "With it
  all he had the gifts which belong to that order of human being. He was
  cunning. He helped the greater men than he to rob, and he saw them go off
  with the greater share of the spoils. He knew perfectly well, although he
  bore it uncomplainingly, that in two cases out of three the result, if things
  should ever be discovered, was fastened upon his shoulder. But Tositi never
  slept. In every one of the great frauds wherein he was at the same time the
  tool and the instigator, he preserved some little fragment of proof that he
  was not the only one concerned, that greater than he had planned what he only
  carried out. He kept these proofs care fully and added to them week by week,
  month by month. He picked the millions out of the fire for the great men who
  called themselves his friends but kept him a long way in the background, but
  he had them all the time safe in his net. He knew it and, when they failed to
  save him, when one of the schemes went awry and Tositi was to be the
  sacrifice, he sent them a warning word of what might happen. What did happen
  was the contents of a dozen revolvers were emptied into his body within
  twelve hours. That was the end of Tositi. Unfortunately he did not live long
  enough to protect himself. It was only after his death that they learnt
  through another man of his cunning The truth is coming to them piece by
  piece. They know that Tositi's damning records are concealed somewhere upon
  this boat where you and I are sitting. They know that if he had had time to
  get to them he would have been allowed to walk out of the country with
  millions in his pockets. That, however, never happened. Tositi is dead but
  the records remain. Two people know where. The man who designed the boat and
  the builder."</p>

  <p>"And they&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"It is known that they went off together to America."</p>

  <p>Silently Hamer rose to his feet, went below, busied himself in the galley
  for a few minutes, and came up carrying a packet of cigarettes.</p>

  <p>They both spoke for a moment or two without speech.</p>

  <p>"So that is the secret of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>," he said at
  last.</p>

  <p>"The secret but not the key," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"It can never happen," he went on "because I do not possess it, but
  supposing I handed you the key, supposing I turned you loose and you
  discovered these records?"</p>

  <p>"I should proceed with discretion," she said, "but what would happen is
  this. The Government would fall and, as soon as they tried to create another,
  a little note to one of the proposed members, and that, too, would never come
  to being. Then the newspapers. We should set a match to the bonfires already
  built. After that the floodgates would be let loose. The men whom we have
  already decided upon would march to their places with the millions of people
  behind them. There would be excesses, of course. There would be bloodshed.
  Innocent people would suffer. Property would be destroyed. But, at one leap,
  France would spring into freedom. Those who are behind the scenes in this
  thing have learnt from the French republic. They have learnt from the Russian
  Soviet. They learnt what blunders to avoid. They have learnt to rebuild
  commencing where others have left off. Humanity would owe a great debt, a
  debt she could never pay, to the man who supplies the key."</p>

  <p>"I, alas, can never be that man. Mademoiselle," Hamer announced. "I cannot
  help believing in you. You are, I think, the most wonderful person I ever
  met. When I think of what you have sacrificed from sheer devotion to a cause,
  from consecrated altruism, I respect and honour you. I can say no more except
  that I am ashamed when I tell you that I am pledged to keep my word to the
  girl I am going to marry. Frankly, I suspect her father is implicated in
  these records, but there it is. My word is given. I shall keep it."</p>

  <p>"It is such a pity," she sighed "So small the cause; so mighty a result.
  You and I together could be responsible for the making of a great country.
  You must keep your word to this nicely brought up young lady who has a
  devotion to her family."</p>

  <p>"It has to be like that," he confessed.</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed, "if you say so. I do not fancy that anything I could
  say or do would change you. It is amazing that you should be the man that you
  are, the great stumbling block to the coming of the Millennium, but such as
  you are you must remain...May I be put ashore?"</p>

  <p>Hamer produced his whistle.</p>

  <p>"One word more," he said. "You have given me a great deal of your
  confidence. You knew without asking that you were safe. What are you going to
  do about this business?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to take the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> from you if I can," she
  told him. "If they had dared, if they had felt convinced, as I could have
  convinced them, that the records they sought were here, it would have been
  destroyed by now a hundred times over. I am the only one who knows, and I
  must have your boat whole. You have chosen to shelter a group of wicked men,
  Monsieur Hamer Wildburn. It may cost you your life, though it shall not if I
  can help it."</p>

  <p>"That's kind of you," he said, "but it must be war, then."</p>

  <p>"I must have the boat," she insisted, "and I must see that it is not
  destroyed. It is not for myself. It is not for any glory that may come to me
  in the future. Probably no one will know. I shall never be a Joan of Arc to
  France, because I am not French. It is not for France I offer myself. It is
  for humanity. The day will come some time when nations will flow the one into
  the other like the seas. That will be the time of freedom."</p>

  <p>Hamer blew his whistle, and Auguste appeared from the galley almost at
  once. Hamer's instructions were simple and decisive.</p>

  <p>"You will take this young lady to the <i>plage</i>, Auguste," he said.
  "You will find my car in the first shed. Drive mademoiselle to the
  Proven&ccedil;al Hotel, or wherever else she directs. First, get me an
  overcoat from downstairs."</p>

  <p>Auguste did as he was bidden. Hamer felt curiously moved as he took her
  hands at the top of the steps. She seemed very frail and tired in the
  gleaming light of the dawn, grey and ghastly before the coming of the sun.
  Yet, when she smiled it was another face.</p>

  <p>"You have been gentle and kind with me, Mr. Wildburn," she confessed. "I
  have met with the great failure of my life just when success seemed so near,
  but I can feel no bitterness towards you. You see with the eyes given you. No
  one can change them."</p>

  <p>He kissed her cold fingers, threw the coat over her shoulders, and stood
  on deck till the dinghy passed into the little wisp of mist which hung over
  the border of the <i>plage</i>.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Lucienne arrived on board the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>
towards 5 o'clock on
  the following afternoon. She had abandoned the absolute negligee in which the
  Riviera was revelling at the moment, and wore a white beach frock, a panama
  hat, and carried a sunshade. She came round the point in one of the motor
  boats which were kept in the private bay of the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, and,
  though she smiled as she recognised Hamer waiting for her, there was a slight
  restraint about the wave of her hand.</p>

  <p>"You look terribly formal," he told her.</p>

  <p>"This is entirely a formal visit," she assured him, as he drew her chair
  back under the awning. "I imagine you must have been expecting me. I have
  come to break off our engagement."</p>

  <p>"Not a chance," he answered. "If I was not so pleased to see you I should
  have sent you back again for that speech."</p>

  <p>"Where is the scene of this bloody encounter?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the deck. "Up and around there."</p>

  <p>"And is it true that you threw my alternate suitor, second Duke of France,
  into the sea?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. I should probably do it again unless he came to
  apologise."</p>

  <p>"Apologise for what?"</p>

  <p>He told her the story up to his having been left on board with Tanya.
  Every now and then her eyes lit up, and she had hard work to restrain a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Up to the present moment, dear Hamer, my sympathies are with you," she
  admitted. "A tiresome lot of young men we seem to have collected at the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>, and I knew nothing of the supper party. So it was they
  who brought Mademoiselle Tanya on board?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly was," he replied.</p>

  <p>"But there is more to be told," she insisted. "According to your own
  story, the prize of the night seems to have been Mademoiselle Tanya."</p>

  <p>"It might seem so," he admitted. "She remained on board, sitting just
  about where you are, and I by her side, for at least an hour and a half after
  they had left. Then I lent her an overcoat, Auguste rowed her to the
  <i>plage</i>, and drove her home to the Proven&ccedil;al. If the
  circumstance," he went on, "is of any import, I might add that she did not
  move from that chair from the time of the departure of her friends until I
  sent her away."</p>

  <p>"I must be in an inquisitive frame of mind," Lucienne confessed, "because
  I find myself asking questions all the time. Why did she stay here with you
  an hour and a half after the others? To see the sun rise?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we did see the sun rise for that matter," he acknowledged, "but she
  stayed to add herself to the number of those who have bewildered me with
  their offers for my boat, and she stayed a little longer to elucidate once
  and for all the mystery of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>."</p>

  <p>"Hamer! You are talking nonsense,"</p>

  <p>Lucienne declared.</p>

  <p>"If you say that again I shall kiss you," he threatened.</p>

  <p>"Things are not so bad as I feared," she conceded, "but I should regard
  any attempt on your part towards familiarities of that sort as an
  impertinence which I should promptly resent."</p>

  <p>He leaned over and kissed her. She made not the slightest resistance, and
  he had a very strong idea that she returned the caress.</p>

  <p>"What happened was this," he said. "Tanya suddenly changed from a mad
  <i>gamine</i> to a young woman of sound common sense&mdash;a most inspired
person.
  She told me some things which I would rather not pass on for the moment, but
  they were purely political. She told me others which I will confide to you.
  The reason, from different points of view, that different people want to
  acquire the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, is because cunningly hidden in various
  parts of her are the detailed reports made by that fellow Tositi as to his
  dealings with some of your greatest politicians."</p>

  <p>Lucienne had gone a little paler. She was leaning forward in her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Is Mademoiselle Tanya being bribed by one of these men?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"By no means," he answered. "She is working for herself and for her party.
  She is a Communist, and she wants to start a new era in this country. It is
  true that she egged those half-drunken young men on to bring her on board. It
  is true, I believe, that in the first instance she encouraged a row so that
  if I got knocked out she would be free of the place, but she had only one
  motive for coming or for staying here. She wanted those records."</p>

  <p>Lucienne removed her hat. She placed one of her small delicate hands on
  either side of Hamer's cheeks, drew his face down, and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Now I feel better," she declared. "She did try to vamp you, though."</p>

  <p>"All in the way of business," he denied. "I told her that I was engaged,
  and that Americans did not understand the vamping dodge. It was then she
  became earnest and talked to me like a serious woman."</p>

  <p>"You didn't let her have the records?"</p>

  <p>"Not a chance," he answered. "Where they are I don't know myself. What to
  do with the boat I don't know. What I am sure of, though, is that, there is
  going to be some trouble here before very long."</p>

  <p>"The boat is mine," she reminded him calmly.</p>

  <p>"Then, for heaven's sake, come and marry me to-morrow at Nice, and take
  possession," he suggested. "I'm as ready for a fight as most men, but I
  honestly don't see any fun in being shot or murdered in my sleep just because
  I happen to own a boat which possesses secrets. It is not as though I cared a
  fig either way. I am neither a philanthropist nor a sentimentalist. Anyone
  can govern France for all I care. For a moment or two that young woman last
  night nearly converted me, then I thought of that gunboat and Perissol on the
  hill. They would never let her get away with anything. Why on earth,
  Lucienne, can't we go to General Perissol and tell him what we believe. He
  must have a suspicion of it already. He is the man to deal with the
  affair."</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Hamer, dearest," she said,'"There is more to be considered. General
  Perissol is not France any more than Edouard Mermillon is France. Father is
  coming back from Paris next week. We must wait till then."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime," he observed, "what is to happen if my Joan of Arc,
  with a thousand Marseillais behind her, sweep through the gendarmes here, as
  they easily could, and seize the boat? What about that, Lucienne?"</p>

  <p>"Did you part on friendly terms with your Joan of Arc, as you call
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But make no mistake about this," he insisted. "She made me no
  promise. I don't amount in her eyes to a husk of chaff. She wants the secret
  of the boat in her hands, and then, according to her, the whole of the French
  Government is doomed."</p>

  <p>Lucienne simply pointed backwards over her shoulder. He followed the
  direction of her gesture, and suddenly realised that the guns of the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> were practically trained upon them.</p>

  <p>"So that's what the gunboat's there for, is it?" he demanded, with
  indications of anger in his tone.</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his.</p>

  <p>"Hamer, dear," she said, "remember this. You are the unfortunate possessor
  of a bone of contention. The final issue does not concern you. The only
  insupportable catastrophe would be if your Joan of Arc, as you call her, were
  to succeed. Otherwise the whole thing would be, as I think you say in
  English, stalemate. It would be settled in the way my father wishes it
  settled."</p>

  <p>Hamer gazed gloomily across the stretch of sea landwards. Since the first
  inkling of the fact that the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> carried treasure of some
  sort it seemed to him that the situation had never been so unsatisfactory. He
  fancied that he could almost hear Tanya's gentle beseeching voice, the music
  which her simple eloquence had sometimes imparted to it, the pleading which,
  regardless of all the small things of life come so convincingly from her
  heart. And for those few minutes, minutes which he was destined never to
  forget, the little guttersnipe, as he had heard her called, and as she had
  more than once seemed to him, had attained to something like a stainless
  spirituality. He recalled that exquisite simplicity of verbiage and motive
  which had so nearly undermined even his promise. Every other argument those
  people had brought to bear upon him seemed suddenly sordid. Even Lucienne was
  begging only for her father's material safety and well being. Beside all this
  Tanya's message seemed to come to him from a different and a cleaner
  world.</p>

  <p>"You are not Hesitating, Hamer?" Lucienne asked him softly.</p>

  <p>He made no effort to explain. There was no human being, he felt, who could
  have understood. For the moment, however, he was spared the necessity of a
  response. The small dinghy from the shore was rocking below. A boy, exhausted
  with his efforts, was resting upon his oars and in the band of his cap was an
  oblong strip of pale green.</p>

  <p>"For me?" Hamer called out. The boy nodded.</p>

  <p>"<i>Une depeche pour Monsieur</i>. Urgent."</p>

  <p>Auguste's hand steadied the boat. The boy passed him the message. Hamer,
  with an apologetic glance towards his companion, tore the perforated edges.
  He read, and read again. The message took his breath away. It was dated from
  Paris that morning.</p>

  <p>"I wish to see you at the earliest possible moment on an urgent matter.
  Cancel every engagement and come to me at once. Ned will meet you at Le
  Bourget. Buy 'plane if necessary.&mdash;Luke."</p>

  <p>Hamer's surprise choked him. He uttered no word or exclamation. He simply
  read the message over for the third time.</p>

  <p>"No bad news, I hope?" Lucienne asked, gravely curious.</p>

  <p>The young man came to himself. He passed the message to her, handed down
  ten francs to the boy and waved him away.</p>

  <p>"Who is this from?" she inquired. "My father."</p>

  <p>"I thought he never came to Europe nowadays."</p>

  <p>"He has not been for two years. It must be ten since he was in
  France."</p>

  <p>"His message sounds very urgent," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Something very extraordinary must have happened," he agreed. "I have
  heard my father say he never intended to visit France again and I have never
  known him to change his mind."</p>

  <p>Lucienne sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am afraid there is no doubt about it," she said. "You will have
  to go."</p>

  <p>"Come up to the Cap with me," he begged, "while I telephone. We can decide
  there whether I take a 'plane or the six o'clock Blue Train."</p>

  <p>"The weather's bad for flying inland," she reminded him anxiously. "We had
  a message this morning. My cousin thought of flying; one of the young men you
  knocked to pieces. He heard that it was snowing at Grenoble."</p>

  <p>"I hate flying anyway," he replied, "but if they guarantee me a reasonable
  passage I suppose I will have to go. What I am thinking about is,
  though&mdash;what about the boat?"</p>

  <p>"I will take care of her for you," Lucienne promised.</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort," he objected firmly. "It would not
  surprise me in the least to come back&mdash;when I do come back&mdash;and
find her
  blown to smithereens, like that flat in Juan was the other night. I don't
  want you anywhere near her, my dear."</p>

  <p>"If you want to keep things just as they are," she suggested, after a
  moment's pause, "why not have a word or two with Commander Berard?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It seems the most sensible thing," he decided.</p>

  <p>"I will help Auguste pack your bag," she said, "while you take the dinghy
  across."</p>

  <p>"What a luxury!" he smiled. "I never felt so nearly married in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"Like the feeling?"</p>

  <p>"It's swell," he assured her.</p>

  <p>Commander Berard was reticent, but reasonable.</p>

  <p>"You see, Commander," Hamer explained, "I know very well that you are
  supposed to be down here taking soundings, and the rest of it, and that you
  could not be expected to enter upon any activities outside, but there is the
  most important French Cabinet Minister within a few yards of you. There is
  the chief of all the police of France up on the hill, and you may possibly
  have gathered from them that my boat is an object of interest to certain
  undesirable people."</p>

  <p>Berard's expression was unchanging. He said nothing. He merely
  listened.</p>

  <p>"We will leave it at that," Hamer went on. "I am compelled to go to Paris
  to-day. It is my father who has sent for me. I shall leave Auguste in charge,
  of course, and he has Jean with him. I want to ask you unofficially whether
  you could not&mdash;bearing all things in mind&mdash;place a small guard
upon her until
  I get back? That and your guns ought to be enough."</p>

  <p>"I think I should be justified in going as far as that, Mr. Wildburn," the
  commander admitted. "The only thing is that if my action is not approved of
  by General Perissol I shall have to withdraw my men."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the risk," Hamer agreed.</p>

  <p class="first">Hamer Wildburn alighted from the Paris Blue Train at the
Gare de Lyons on
  the following morning, and held out his hand to the bespectacled young man
  who hurried up to him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ned, old fellow," he greeted him. "This is a nice surprise to
  spring upon one. What's all the fuss about?"</p>

  <p>"Can't tell you a single thing, Hamer. We only heard that the old man was
  on his way over when he was half a day out of Cherbourg. I expect he had hard
  work dodging the newspaper men at the other end and those radio fellows. We
  had instructions to take the suite he used to have in the old days at the
  Meurice and to get you here at once. The suite was easy enough, but you took
  a bit of moving."</p>

  <p>"I hate Paris anyway&mdash;especially at this time of the year," Hamer
  confessed, handing the ticket for his registered luggage to a porter. "I
  thought it would have done the old man good to have come down to my part of
  the world, and, anyway, I didn't waste any time in telephoning. There was a
  storm blowing south, around Uriage way, and there were no 'planes leaving of
  any sort."</p>

  <p>"It blew hard here last night," the young man observed. "The chief heard
  from Le Bourget that no 'plane would be leaving Cannes so he didn't expect
  you before."</p>

  <p>"What's, it all about?" Hamer inquired. "It isn't a thing we talk much
  about, but I know for a fact that he never meant to set foot in France again
  as long as he lived."</p>

  <p>"We were just as much surprised as you were," Ned Foster answered, as they
  made their way towards the exit. "So far we have not heard a word of
  explanation."</p>

  <p>"Something to do with the newspaper, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>His companion shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't be surprised. We have to run the paper as we are told, of
  course, but we run it at a good many millions of francs loss because of our
  politics. I am never quite sure when I get down in the mornings that I shan't
  find the office blown up."</p>

  <p>They stepped into the waiting automobile, and drove off after a very brief
  delay. Hamer looked about him with distaste. It was a grey morning, but the
  air was heavy and oppressive.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope he won't keep me long," he remarked fervently. "I am really
  having the time of my life down there, Ned. I am doing my stunt of work for
  you fellows, and meeting some very interesting people&mdash;French politicians
  most of them, by-the-bye. I have also just become engaged to the prettiest
  and sweetest girl you ever saw out of the States, or in them either, for that
  matter."</p>

  <p>Ned Foster started.</p>

  <p>"Does the chief know that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It won't be popular news, I don't suppose, but he will know as soon as I
  see him," the other replied. "I have not had time to write yet. What sort of
  a humour is he in?"</p>

  <p>"Dangerous, I should say. Dangerous, with a touch of the mysterious. He is
  too amiable to be natural. So far, although he came over on a fast boat, and
  insisted upon a special train from Cherbourg, he has done nothing but loll
  about in the sitting-room, smoking those terrible cigars. He has not been
  near the office, and he doesn't want to see Jimmy Pollen until to-morrow. I
  had hard work to keep Jimmy away. He's afraid the governor may have an idea
  of shutting up here."</p>

  <p>"Is he out of bed yet&mdash;the governor, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Got up at six, and had his coffee and rolls. He went out last night in
  his ordinary clothes, after having dinner in his room, but he was back before
  midnight. I think he was only having a look round the place."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wish he had chosen another time for this surprise visit," Hamer
  grumbled. "I'm a dutiful son when it comes to the point, and all that, but I
  was just planning a cruise to Bandol and Toulon when I got your
  despatch."</p>

  <p>"Living on that little boat of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I should say I am. Sleep on deck most nights. It's a good life."</p>

  <p>"You can get the same sort or thing at Palm Beach or Newquay," his
  patriotic friend reminded him.</p>

  <p>Hamer shook, his head.</p>

  <p>"No, you can't," he denied. "Too many people. Too much to do. Too many
  late parties it's so artificial at those places. We lead the simple life down
  my way. Besides, you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand," the other interrupted. "The sweetest and prettiest girl in
  the world out side the States&mdash;or in them for that matter&mdash;lives
there!"</p>

  <p>"You can chaff, but you wait till you see her," Hamer laughed.</p>

  <p>Luke Scott Wildburn, who was accounted one of the most successful men in
  the world, welcomed his son with a good natured smile and a hearty handshake.
  He was a tall, fine looking man with a good deal of his son's physique, but
  with the worn lines of coming age in his face, and a touch of langour in his
  manner which some people thought was affectation, but which he had possessed
  all his life. He was dressed, notwithstanding the heat, with great formality,
  and he had apparently been dictating letters to one of his typists, who left
  the room and hurried away at the entrance of the two visitors.</p>

  <p>"Well, young fellow, you hated coming away, I suppose?" he remarked,
  pushing his chair further away from the table and crossing his legs.</p>

  <p>"So would you, sir, if you had been in my place," his son replied. "It's
  no weather for Paris. I wonder you can stand that kit."</p>

  <p>"I have an early appointment with the President," Scott Wildburn
  explained, "and you know we Americans have the reputation of overdoing the
  right thing for fear of doing the wrong. What do you say about it, Ned?"</p>

  <p>"Before midday, sir, even in diplomatic circles, a certain negligence of
  costume is permitted in August."</p>

  <p>"Hear him," his chief chuckled. "He's a walking encyclopaedia. He will
  suggest your first proper remarks when you are introduced to a fashionable
  cocotte, a princess, or a crowned head. I don't know what I should do without
  Ned."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," the young man replied. "I hope you will never have
  occasion to."</p>

  <p>"Apt, you see, as usual...To return to the subject of my black coat, I
  think that I am one of those people who are proof against these changes of
  climate, perhaps because I am of a sedentary turn of life. You must have some
  coffee after your journey, Hamer. Order <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner</i> in the
  smaller salon, Ned, for Hamer. I will ring up your room when I want anybody
  or anything. See that a car and servant are ready at half past eleven for my
  visit. After that time you and Hamer can fade away for lunch somewhere if you
  want to. I am invited by the President."</p>

  <p>Father and son strolled into a smaller room, and Ned hastened away. Scott
  Wildburn threw himself into an easy chair, and lit an atrocious looking
  cigar. Hamer followed suit with a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"So you are having a good time, are you, young fellow?"</p>

  <p>"I like it," Hamer confessed. "It would not suit you, sir, but then I was
  never so fond of action as you are."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I am particularly fond of action," his father
  meditated. "On the other hand, I cannot see how anybody finds any time for
  dawdling with only thirty or forty years of actual life."</p>

  <p>"I suppose one develops even when one dawdles," Hamer reflected. "I have
  not been utterly lazy either. I have written two articles a week for the
  paper, read a good bit, and I have the outline of a novel ready to start
  upon. I like working all right, but I like working in my own way and at my
  own time. I should hate an official post, for instance, with all its
  responsibilities and complications, and I should never be able to manage an
  immense organisation like yours, with all your staff to keep in their places.
  Incidentally, sir, I was going to write to you in a few days to tell you that
  I am engaged to be married."</p>

  <p>His father raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Better be careful," he advised. "This is France, not America. You are
  supposed to be in it for life when you start that sort of thing over
  here."</p>

  <p>"I hope I shall be," Hamer declared. "When you have seen my young woman
  you will hope so, too, for my sake."</p>

  <p>"Confident young feller, aren't you? How old are you, Hamer?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-six, sir."</p>

  <p>"A year older than I thought. Well, I'm glad that you are not one of these
  crazy super-sportsmen, anyway. You look as though you took plenty of
  exercise."</p>

  <p>"I swim three times a day," Hamer said, "play tennis most days, a little
  golf now and then, and enough canoeing to keep my muscles in order every
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," his father said tolerantly. "It is not every man who is born
  ambitious. I am not really sure," he went on, "that to be
ambitious&mdash;unless
  it is a very definite and worthy form of ambition&mdash;is not a sign of
weakness.
  Tell me about the young lady. I am afraid that she must be French."</p>

  <p>"She is, sir."</p>

  <p>"Innkeeper's daughter or princess, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Half-way between the two, I suppose. I believe her family is quite good.
  They own the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> close to where my boat is moored. Her name
  is Montelimar&mdash;Lucienne de Montelimar."</p>

  <p>"Very pretty," his father observed approvingly. "The name sounds
  familiar."</p>

  <p>"Her father, the Marquis de Montelimar, has been French ambassador in
  several European capitals, I believe," Hamer confided. "I think you will like
  him. For a Frenchman he has quite a broad outlook."</p>

  <p>"If it becomes necessary I shall, of course, be prepared to make the
  acquaintance of the family," Scott Wildburn said after a moment's hesitation.
  "You are aware, however, of course, of my prejudices. I have no great
  friendship for the French, as I think you know...Tell me about this boat of
  yours, Hamer."</p>

  <p>"The <i>Bird of Paradise</i>," the young man replied in some surprise.
  "Oh, she isn't much, but then I never had any ambition to own a yacht.
  Nothing like your Valkyrie or even the Storm Cloud. She's just a thirty-ton
  schooner yacht, built by a Frenchman for his honeymoon, with one large cabin
  and a decent little saloon. Just big enough for me to get some fun out of
  sailing her and cruising around&mdash;although I haven't done much of that
  lately."</p>

  <p>"Something in the nature of an engine, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Diesels. Why don't you come down and see her? I think you told me that
  you've never been down to the Riviera in the summer."</p>

  <p>"That may happen. You are fond of the boat, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I am, rather," Hamer confessed.</p>

  <p>"How much did you give for her?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen hundred pounds, sir. She was not particularly cheap, but I
  thought she was worth it, and she was so exactly what I wanted."</p>

  <p>"Bought her at Marseilles, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Why, how did you know that, sir?" Hamer asked, more surprised than ever.
  "I didn't know that I had ever written you about her."</p>

  <p>"You haven't&mdash;and yet I know," his father observed, smiling. "Now, I
am
  going to give you a chance of doing a little remunerative business. You say
  that you gave eighteen hundred pounds for her. I am going to buy her from you
  at five thousand."</p>

  <p>To Hamer Wildburn his father's words wore perhaps the greatest shock of
  his life. He dropped his cigarette upon the carpet, and stared across the
  room open-mouthed. There was no doubt whatever but that Scott Wildburn was in
  earnest. He was smiling at his son's astonishment, but he had by no means the
  appearance of a man who had embarked upon a jest.</p>

  <p>"Come, Hamer, don't look as though you had lost your senses," he
  admonished his son. "Sit up and take notice. I want to buy the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>. I am offering you five thousand pounds for her; cheque before
  you leave this room."</p>

  <p>"What on earth," Hamer gasped, as a flood of memories came rushing into
  his brain, "do you want to buy the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> for?"</p>

  <p>His father tapped the ash from his cigar into the plate by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well, I may tell you that some day," he promised. "Just at present it
  doesn't matter, does it? I'll give you a cheque for the amount now, or if you
  see anything you fancy at a few thousands more that won't matter. I'll give
  you the Storm Cloud if you care to sail her across. That's the sort of
  enterprise that might appeal to you, I imagine. She would cross the Atlantic
  all right. She has done it twice already. What about it, Hamer? I have a crew
  ready. When can I put them on board?"</p>

  <p>"You have rather taken my breath away." his son acknowledged. "Do you
  know, sir, that nearly everyone in the neighbourhood has been trying to buy
  that boat from me?"</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn stiffened visibly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by' everyone in the neighbourhood'?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Monsieur Edouard Mermillon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
  General Perissol, the man who has the wonderful new post, in the Ministry,
  and controls the whole of the police of France. He has not made me any
  definite offer, but it is easy to see that he's interested. I have since
  discovered that a very beautiful woman who swam from the shore one night and
  turned my cabin inside out is his <i>chere amie</i>. Then there is a young
  woman, a danseuse, but you wouldn't know about her."</p>

  <p>"Anyone else?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no one has made a direct offer to me," Hamer confessed, "but
  Lucienne&mdash;that's Lucienne de Montelimar, you know, the girl I am
engaged to
  marry&mdash;has made me promise to give it to her for a wedding present."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Scott Wildburn had drawn his chair further back
  and his face seemed to have relapsed into the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Mermillon," he muttered. "Let me see&mdash;he is Minister for Foreign
Affairs.
  General Perissol. H'm. I should have thought he would have adopted another
  line. Montelimar's daughter. A young danseuse: mixed up in some intrigue, I
  suppose. All this is very strange, Hamer."</p>

  <p>"It is bewildering."</p>

  <p>"From what I remember of your younger days," his father remarked, "it
  seems to me that you never had the bump of curiosity very strongly developed.
  I presume the same idiosyncrasy has survived your adolescence. But seriously,
  Hamer, haven't you ever wondered what they wanted your boat for?"</p>

  <p>"I have racked my brains," the young man acknowledged. "Even Lucienne
  wouldn't tell me. I always imagined that she wanted it for sentimental
  reasons. You see, we really met on board. I pulled her in when she was
  exhausted swimming on a rough day and since then we have spent a good deal of
  time on board together. Mermillon wanted it for a present to his nephew. That
  seemed quite reasonable. Then, for the first time, within the last few days,
  the danseuse I have spoken of gave me an idea. I thought I saw a gleam of
  light. Now you come along and I am all in the dark again. You could not want
  the boat for the same reason that my little friend. Mademoiselle Tanya wanted
  it."</p>

  <p>"You think not," his father observed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think. I'm sure of it, Dad," Hamer declared. "Why not tell me
  what you do want her for? It would help me out of a dilemma, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Serve you right if I did tell you," was the somewhat grim reply.</p>

  <p>"Well, for heaven's sake, do. The story I have heard seems to me most
  terribly improbable, but I was never so curious about anything in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"Bottle it up, my boy," his father advised him. "Believe me, you are a
  safer man, in France, at any rate, not to know...And now I'm afraid I'm going
  to disappoint you, Hamer. I want that boat. I must have her&mdash;and at
  once."</p>

  <p>Something in his father's tone startled him. He looked up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"But, Dad," he expostulated, "I've told you I've promised it to Lucienne.
  It is the only thing she has ever asked me for."</p>

  <p>"And that may be the only promise you have ever broken," was the quiet
  reply, "but you will have to break it."</p>

  <p>There was a short but somewhat awkward silence.</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn had sunk back in his comfortable chair, and his
eyes&mdash;cold
  and relentless&mdash;were fixed upon his son. The fingers of his right hand
  drummed restlessly upon the table by his side. Hamer was in the throes of a
  great bewilderment. His father's request, almost demand, had come like a
  thunderbolt. He temporised&mdash;weakly, as he realised afterwards.</p>

  <p>"You won't mind my writing to Lucienne, sir?" he said at last. "I must
  give some explanation. You see," he went on, a little awkwardly, "she looks
  upon the boat as her own already."</p>

  <p>"That is, of course, unfortunate," his father admitted calmly, "but it
  can't be helped. I want possession within the next few hours. I have brought
  a crew of my own over from New York to take her to Marseilles.</p>

  <p>"From New York?" Hamer gasped.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that this is no sudden impulse. Nothing in the world but
  to acquire possession of the '<i>Bird of Paradise</i>' would have brought me
  back to France."</p>

  <p>Hamer leaned forward with his hand behind his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, dad," he reiterated. "I must speak lo Lucienne first. I cannot
  break the first promise I ever made to her without some explanation."</p>

  <p>Considering the number of years which had passed since anyone had even
  hesitated for a single moment to do the bidding of the great millionaire, his
  present attitude was exemplary. He showed no signs of losing his temper. He
  even smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"Hamer," he said, "I do not propose lo enter into lengthy explanations,
  but it has already, no doubt, dawned upon you that we are up against no
  ordinary situation. The fact that you risk your life every moment that you
  stay upon that boat means, I am sure, very little to you because you are
  courageous, almost rash, by disposition. But you must get this firmly into
  your head. I should not ask you to break your promise to the young woman whom
  yon propose to marry if there were not vital and overwhelming reasons for
  doing so. You would not be able to comprehend if I were to tell you why I am
  making this demand upon you. You will have to accept the bald facts. I must
  have the boat and at once."</p>

  <p>"I will get on the telephone to Lucienne," Hamer proposed.</p>

  <p>"You must do nothing of the sort," his father enjoined firmly. "You must
  tell her nothing until the boat is safely in my possession."</p>

  <p>Hamer was beginning slowly to recover his poise. He was perhaps more
  uncomfortable, though, than he had ever been in his life.</p>

  <p>"Dad," he said, "I am not sure that I can do what you ask me until I have
  spoken to Lucienne."</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn looked thoughtfully across at his son. There, alas, was the
  same firm chin, the same steady eyes, the same note of determination in the
  voice. It was a duplication of himself and his own obstinacy with which he
  was confronted.</p>

  <p>"This is going to be a very awkward affair, Hamer," he meditated.</p>

  <p>"A very awkward affair for me, without doubt," his son replied. "I
  realise, of course, what it may mean to refuse what you ask me. I am afraid,
  however, that I cannot let that make any difference."</p>

  <p>"Good lad," his father approved. "Quite the right attitude."</p>

  <p>A waiter had entered the room during the last few minutes with the
  <i>petit dejeuner</i>, which he wheeled up on a small table lo Hamer's side.
  Scott Wildburn rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall leave you alone for a quarter of an hour," he said. "You can talk
  to Ned if you like. Sometimes that young man has gleams of positive
  inspiration. Between you, you may be able to work something out."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to be such a nuisance, sir," Hamer regretted.</p>

  <p>"Under the unfortunate circumstances," his father admitted. "I am not
  surprised that this trouble has arisen. However, we must try and get over it
  somehow...They have given you my special coffee, I hope? You will find it
  delicious. I shall be back within a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn had returned. Hamer had dealt with his breakfast, and
  smoked two cigarettes without coming any nearer to a solution of the quandary
  in which his father's demands had placed him.</p>

  <p>"Thinking doesn't seem to be of any use," he confessed ruefully. "I must
  ask Lucienne before I give away her property."</p>

  <p>"Not her property until your wedding day, I understood," his father
  objected. "Still, I won't quibble. I will take you into my confidence
  instead. I will tell you why I must have the boat."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

  <p class="first">Scott Wildburn settled himself in his chair and lit one of
his amazing
  cigars.</p>

  <p>"It is Ned's idea that I should extend this confidence to you," he began.
  "Quite a stroke of genius, I call it. He proposed that I should tell you the
  truth. You will be murdered, of course, if anyone finds out that you know,
  but then so should I. It will be simply one more taking a chance.
  Scared?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit."</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose you would be. Well, you don't read my newspapers, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do," Hamer assented. "You read my editorials?"</p>

  <p>"Every one of them,"</p>

  <p>"Then you can judge where my sympathies have been as regards France during
  the last few years."</p>

  <p>"The whole world knows that," Hamer agreed. "You have not given them a
  chance to forget it either. You have been, if not an enemy, a very stern
  critic of French policy practically the whole of the time since the war."</p>

  <p>The newspaper millionaire nodded acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"I mention this," he said, "because it will help you to understand why a
  certain adventure was offered to me. One day a Frenchman, who had been
  persistently demanding an interview for days, succeeded in finding his way
  into my private office in New York. He stated his case in very few
  words."</p>

  <p>"'I have read your newspapers,' he confided, 'day by day. I married an
  American and I have lived over here. That is why I understand your point of
  view. You hate France&mdash;for personal as well as political reasons.'</p>

  <p>"That was going pretty far, you know. I remember the time when I should
  have thrown any man out of the room who had dared to say that to me."</p>

  <p>"I can quite understand."</p>

  <p>"Well," Scott Wildburn went on, "my visitor's next sentence was something
  startling.</p>

  <p>"'I can put you,' he assured me, 'in a position to ruin France as a
  civilised country, at any rate, for several generations.'"</p>

  <p>"Must have been a madman." Hamer declared.</p>

  <p>"He was no madder than I am," Scott Wildburn rejoined "He went on to tell
  me his story. The proofs he had to offer were insignificant. The whole thing
  might very easily have been a faked up tale, but he left my office with a
  certified cheque for fifty thousand dollars in his pocket. He could have had
  more if he had asked for it. Even if it were not true, his story was almost
  worth the money."</p>

  <p>Hamer, who was deeply interested, reverted unconsciously to the slang of
  his younger days.</p>

  <p>"Gee," he muttered "I would like to have been there!"</p>

  <p>"He would probably have convinced you as he did me," Scott Wildburn
  continued. "He reminded me of the Tositi frauds in which a number of public
  men were concerned, and the discovery of which has given the Communist cause
  in France a tremendous leg up on account of the number of men in politics and
  public life who are involved. He went on to assure me that the Tositi affair
  itself was only like one little twig on a great tree. He assured me of what I
  have sometimes suspected&mdash;that France is being bled through her public
  services by politicians to an incredible extent. According to him, there is
  scarcely a man in politics who is not deeply implicated in a gigantic scheme
  of national embezzlement. The six arch embezzlers formed a small circle, and,
  according to this visitor of mine, incredible as it seems, the amount of
  their defalcations would have pretty well paid France's debt to America."</p>

  <p>"How could a country be bled to that extent?" Hamer demanded
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"The thing begins at the bottom," Scott Wildburn pointed out. "You should
  realise that in a budget of fifty milliards or thereabouts the officials, the
  pensioners, and those in receipt of government assistance of some kind or
  other call for at least twenty-five milliards, which must never appear either
  before the Chamber or in print. The French budget is a gigantic plum cake for
  those who are nearest to help themselves, and there are very few who do not
  get some of the plums. From that the whole scheme moves upwards...At the time
  of the Tositi affair the man who had been the tool of the circle warned them
  promptly that unless he was protected, certain proofs which he had collected
  of their wrongdoing would be placed in the hands of his counsel. Their answer
  was a dozen revolver bullets in Tositi's body. You may think it was a queer
  thing this, Hamer, my boy&mdash;I scarcely believed in it myself&mdash;but
the French
  outlook and temperament are different to ours. Anyway, I bought the clue
  which would enable me to handle that list of six names, and the written
  evidence which Tositi had in his possession, for fifty thousand dollars and a
  further fifty thousand later on."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that you have this evidence?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I know where the records are which would damn some of the
  greatest statesmen in France and plunge the whole country into confusion,"
  Scott Wildburn answered. "They are on your boat, the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>."</p>

  <p>Hamer was speechless. He could think of nothing but Tanya. He seemed to be
  back on the boat on that moonless night when she had sat by his side and
  calmly told him her wonderful story. He remembered her words&mdash;crisp,
cool,
  exquisitely poignant. In all this labyrinth of lies and inventions here had
  been the truth.</p>

  <p>"It isn't&mdash;it couldn't be possible," he faltered.</p>

  <p>"It is very possible indeed," his father answered tritely. "It is not a
  certainty, of course, but I am not exactly a credulous person, and I have
  ventured a hundred thousand dollars on it. A great many secrets, Hamer, have
  gone down to the bottom of the sea this way. My visitor was the draftsman to
  the naval architect who designed the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, and the paper
  he gave me was a plan showing exactly where the secret hiding places were
  made. The boat will have to be practically disembowelled. She will probably
  be useless afterwards, but that really doesn't matter much. Now, you see, my
  boy, why I must have your boat."</p>

  <p>Hamer made no reply. His father watched him with searching eyes. Dimly he
  began to wonder whether it was possible that he had made a mistake in
  confiding the secret of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> to his son. Hamer could
  never feel the same hatred as had scarred his own life. France had been a
  second home to him. He had probably grown to love the country. Even at his
  father's bidding he might hesitate to aid in striking her this mortal blow.
  Too late now. He had chosen his weapons and he must abide by them.</p>

  <p>"What you have told me, Hamer," he continued, "concerning these other
  people who have been trying to buy the boat from you seems to me to be strong
  confirmation of the story as it was handed over to me. At any rate, as soon
  as the boat comes into my possession I shall pull her to pieces, and I shall
  know exactly where to find these records."</p>

  <p>"And when you have found them?"</p>

  <p>"It may depend to some extent upon the names of the men implicated," Scott
  Wildburn admitted. "At any rate, I promise you that I shall know how to use
  the document. I do not pretend that I shall not use it ruthlessly, because I
  shall. France will receive thee greatest shock she has ever known in her
  life&mdash;worse than the Revolution itself."</p>

  <p>There was a light in his father's eyes which Hamer had only seen there
  once before&mdash;something intensely and bitterly cruel. He felt a shiver of
  something like fear.</p>

  <p>"Father," he said, "we shall never be so close together again as we are
  now. It is a time for naked words. Is this hatred of yours for France
  political only or is it inspired as well by the memory of a woman&mdash;my
  mother&mdash;who is dead?"</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have asked that question," Scott Wildburn replied, "but
  although you are my son and hers, Hamer, I shall not answer it. You know for
  yourself that since the day she left me I have never set my toot on French
  soil and you know for yourself that I never forgive. Most men in their
  lives," he went on with marked deliberation, "have one great love or one
  great hate, men I mean who have walked in the lofty places of life. It may be
  so with me. I leave it to you to divine for yourself. I only ask you, for
  your own sake, to remember this. Remember that you are now a partner in the
  world's most dangerous secret. A word, the breath of a word, and there is a
  whole army of assassins ready for us, a crowd that would make the gangsters
  of Chicago seem like children playing on a nursery floor. How you lived on
  that boat, Hamer, and escaped being killed is more than I can imagine,
  especially after that little danseuse had visited you. You had the luck of
  innocence, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Is the Marquis de Montelimar one of the people implicated?" Hamer
  asked.</p>

  <p>"How do I know?" his father answered. "I'll tell you when the records come
  into my hands. I imagine that the first name we draw will give the whole
  world a shock. Concerning the others I am not sure."</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn was feeling dazed and utterly miserable, perhaps more
  miserable than he had ever been before in his life. The blackest terror of
  all was that overwhelming suspicion that Lucienne's father must somehow be
  concerned in the records.</p>

  <p>"Why do you deal with this horrible business yourself, father?" he asked.
  "Of course, I know that newspapers nowadays practically govern the world.
  They make war or peace. They unearth horrible conspiracies. They deal in the
  honour of great men, they traffic with the national conscience of countries.
  But it is not their office. They were never meant to mete out justice. It is
  a foul way to balance the scales of justice. This thing, if it must be
  brought to light, dad, should never be done through the newspapers. There is
  at any rate one man in France who can be trusted&mdash;General Perissol. He
has
  control over all the police and the internal secret service of France. Why
  not let him deal with this matter?"</p>

  <p>"General Perissol is an honourable man so far as I know," Wildburn Scott
  admitted. "On the other hand, I am not sure that he would deal with this
  affair as I intend it to be dealt with."</p>

  <p>"You are taking a great responsibility, sir," Hamer insisted.</p>

  <p>"I don t think that anyone ever took a greater," his father agreed.
  "However, it has come, and I am ready for it...Shall I send for Ned? We had
  better have some sort of deed of sale. Ned can take it down to Antibes
  to-night. I have a 'plane waiting, and the crew are all ready to go on board.
  You can have your cheque now."</p>

  <p>"I don't want the cheque, dad," Hamer said. "I'm not thinking about that.
  I'm thinking of the ruin which will surely come upon France if you publish
  those names."</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn made no reply. He stretched out his hand towards the bell.
  Hamer caught his wrist just in time.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother, please." he begged. "I must think for a moment."</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn turned calmly around. "Think? What about?"</p>

  <p>"About handing you over the boat," Hamer cried desperately "You know what
  it will mean. You know the difficulty there has been in getting a Government
  together whom the French people are willing to trust. Six months ago the
  country was in peril. If these records contain any of the great names of
  those who are in the present Government the Ministry will fall, there will be
  no one else whom the people will trust and the Communists will come into
  power. You could not avoid a revolution then and all that is left of France
  that is worth having would go into the melting-pot."</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you have been studying these things," his father acquiesced.
  "Yes, that is probably what would happen. Leaving out the personal side,
  however, looking at the matter from the Frenchman's own point of view, could
  anything be worse than for the country to be governed by men who are sucking
  the blood out of her?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know." Hamer groaned. "Tanya herself put ideas into my head, but
  I have not had time to think them out. The only thing I am sure of is that a
  newspaper exposure would mean utter and complete ruin. There must be safer,
  less ghastly, and more diplomatic ways of dealing with the situation. The men
  whose names appear in the records that you spoke of, they could be approached
  secretly and forced to resign. They must be punished, of course, but there is
  no need for them to drag down the country's honour with their own. They will
  lose their careers, they will be under a shadow for the rest of their lives,
  but you don't want to turn the whole country into a seething inferno."</p>

  <p>Scott Wildburn had drawn himself up to his full height, and a very fine
  figure of a man he was except for the inhumanity of his features and
  poise.</p>

  <p>"There may be some small measure of doubt in my mind as to minor details,"
  he said, "but what I have decided to do is already settled,
and&mdash;forgive me,
  my son&mdash;advice from you would seem a little out of place, would it not?
I am
  going to send for Ned."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't." Hamer exclaimed with desperate courage.</p>

  <p>His father, with his hand upon the bell, looked round at him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I have made up my mind not to part with the boat." Hamer
  shouted. "I would sooner place a bomb in her and blow her to pieces!"</p>

  <p>The atmosphere seemed to grow tenser every second because of the dead
  silence which followed Hamer's words. His father stood for a moment without
  moving, his hand poised over the bell. Then he resumed his place in his
  chair, and sat without gesture or speech, his eyes fixed steadily on his son.
  Hamer was desperately uncomfortable. He felt himself at a hopeless
  disadvantage beside that immense self-control.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he blundered out. "You see, I can't feel about France like
  you do. I love it. It is my home. And then there's Lucienne. That was a
  promise&mdash;the first promise I ever made her."</p>

  <p>"I have always looked upon you, Hamer, as being a person of average
  intelligence," his father said quietly, without the slightest trace of anger
  in his tone. "With average intelligence you should duly appreciate the
  proportions of life. I am asking one of the smallest things in the world of
  you considering our relative positions, which happens, owing to
  circumstances, to be also one of the greatest. You talk to me of a girl to
  whom you have become engaged during these lazy summer months&mdash;of
bathing and
  swimming together&mdash;and who suddenly seems to take the place to you of
your
  duty to your father, your race, and your honour. I must ask you once more to
  be sure that there is no misunderstanding. Are you willing to place the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i> immediately and without reservations in my
  hands?"</p>

  <p>"I must see Lucienne first." Hamer answered doggedly. "I must find out
  whether her father is interested in these records before I tell her that I
  cannot keep my promise."</p>

  <p>"And in doing that," his father reminded him, "you disclose the whole
  situation. The <i>Bird of Paradise</i> will depart at once from the face of
  the waters and the most disgraceful conspiracy the modern world has ever
  known will remain undetected, and its authors go unpunished. All this that
  you may keep your word to your sweetheart."</p>

  <p>"You make it sound pretty rotten, dad," Hamer replied, "but I shall keep
  my word to Lucienne. I would waive all the other considerations even though I
  should feel that you were wrecking a great country to gratify your personal
  vengeance. I should think it a horrible thing to do, but I should not
  interfere. Your genius, the gargantuan success of your life has given you the
  power. If you wanted to ruin the careers of these men, one of whom at least I
  know to be a fine statesman, although I believe he would be involved, you
  must do it if you think fit. I would not interfere if you insisted, although
  I should loathe myself for giving way, and if you will forgive my saying
  so&mdash;I should lose some of my respect for you in the contemplation of such
  human sabotage. But I am going to keep my word to Lucienne."</p>

  <p>"In that case," his father replied, glancing at his watch, "you will
  perhaps excuse me. Mine is only a flying visit to Paris&mdash;the first, as
you
  know, for many years, and I have various things to attend to. I am sorry to
  have given you the trouble of this fruitless journey. You have only to ask
  for it and a draft for your expenses will be attached to your next quarter's
  allowance."</p>

  <p>Something like tears stood in Hamer's eyes. "Look here, Dad," he
  remonstrated, "aren't you hitting rather below the belt?"</p>

  <p>His father had touched the bell. He stood with his back to the room
  looking out of the window. Ned Foster, the young bespectacled secretary, made
  swift appearance.</p>

  <p>"Ned," his chief directed, looking for a moment over his shoulder, "my son
  and I have failed to come to an understanding. Please take him from the suite
  and see that he catches the next train back to the South of France. I shall
  not be requiring to see him again."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Monsieur and Madame Crestner of the Plage Restaurant at
Garoupe were
  excited, jubilant, but a trifle disturbed. Madame was genuinely uneasy. She
  drew her husband on one side away from the little babel before the bar.</p>

  <p>"What is it then that arrives?" she demanded. "Mademoiselle Tanya, the
  great artiste from Juan-les-Pins, she visits us. She says that she has
  invited a great supper party here of friends. She bids me provide more
  tables, more food, more wine. The money drops from her fingers like
  water."</p>

  <p>"All these things," Monsieur said, rubbing his hands gently together, "are
  excellent. Mademoiselle is drawing a large salary. She will not look at the
  bills."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," Madame declared, "but how can we feed a hundred
  people? Our regular clients we have had to send away. Our cooking ranges
  inside and out are heaped with food. We cook, and we cook, and we cook. But a
  hundred people, and, <i>ma foi</i>, such people!"</p>

  <p>"It is not our concern who they are," her husband pointed out. "As for the
  wine, it is stored up behind the shed. We have enough, and more than enough,
  for a hundred people. The food-well, they must have consideration."</p>

  <p>"But listen, Jean," she went on, clutching at his arm. "Who are these
  people? I ask you. Look around. I know where they come from. They come from
  Marseilles-nearly every one of them. Look at their faces. See how they talk
  together in corners. All the time I fancy that there is something on their
  minds. They look to me more like conspirators than men out for a night picnic
  with a great actress."</p>

  <p>Monsieur shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is not our affair," he decided.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is our affair," she insisted, drawing him a little further
  on one side. "They point, and they point, and they point&mdash;always at the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. Monsieur Wildburn&mdash;<i>si gentil</i>&mdash;he
is away in
  Paris. Do you note this? Auguste has not arrived for his aperitif nor for the
  ice to-night. Never does he miss. There is the dinghy and the small
  speedboat. Auguste has not left the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>."</p>

  <p>"Is that of consequence?" Monsieur asked, after a brief visit to his
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"I am uneasy. That is all." she said. "Always we know there has been
  something; mysterious about Monsieur Wildburn's boat. So many people visit
  it. They talk and they go away, and now the gunboat lying there. It seems
  strange that Mademoiselle should have chosen to give her party the one night
  that Monsieur Wildburn is away."</p>

  <p>Monsieur rolled and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Disturb yourself no longer, little one," he begged. "I am a restaurant
  keeper and you are my wife. We have a great feast to prepare for one who is
  well able to pay and has given us two <i>mille</i> already to secure the
  tables. To-night we are going to make money. Others can do as they wish."</p>

  <p>Another carload of guests was discharged&mdash;good-looking men in their
way
  but hard men, saturnine in appearance, few of them with the joie de vivre of
  the French caf&eacute; lounger in his face. Men with a purpose they seemed,
  and there was something too which Monsieur observed but of which he said
  nothing to his wife. Here and there war a little bulge in those queer-shaped
  side pockets that were very much the fashion in Marseilles...</p>

  <p>There was a murmur amongst the gathering crowd. Some with their aperitifs
  still in their hands strolled down to the edge of the water. A large
  speedboat had rounded the point and was making for the <i>plage</i>. A
  whisper went about.</p>

  <p>"It is Tanya&mdash;Tanya warned us that she would come by sea."</p>

  <p>Monsieur of the restaurant shaded his eyes with his hand and looked
  seawards.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he murmured, "Mademoiselle was not wise."</p>

  <p>A loiterer standing by him heard the words and noticed the little streak
  of white which capped the waves in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Something which arrives, eh Monsieur?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of any account," Monsieur replied.</p>

  <p>The speedboat anchored about twenty yards from the landing-stage. The
  loiterers took little dinghies out, and the speedboat unloaded a couple. She
  was crowded herself with the remainder of the guests of the evening, and
  there was a shout of welcome when Mademoiselle stepped on shore. Tanya was
  her old self. Her eyes seemed on fire. She needed no rouge upon her cheeks.
  Her hair, already disarranged by the wind, blew wildly about her face. She
  was dressed in black, but she wore a red shawl draped loosely over her
  shoulders. As she stepped onto the <i>plage</i> there was a sudden forest of
  uplifted hands, the murmur of a song, and then the song itself&mdash;the Red
  March, rolling, thunderous music&mdash;a march prohibited in France and all
over
  Europe where the forces of government were strong enough to insist without
  indiscretion. They came to the scattered group of tables under the shed,
  singing the words and swaying their bodies to the music, and presently they
  forgot to sing while they clapped.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Crestner," Tanya called out, shaking hands with his wife and
  himself, "our feast is prepared&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is prepared, Mademoiselle," Madame assured her. "This is a
  great honour that you have done us. If only we could have accommodated more.
  They keep ringing up for tables, but I say that it is impossible. I have six
  extra waiters. I hope that everything will be well served&mdash;that
Mademoiselle
  will excuse."</p>

  <p>"We will excuse everything," Tanya declared gaily. "Let there be plenty of
  food and wine and we will help ourselves. We are hungry, and, above all, we
  are thirsty."</p>

  <p>The man by her side, a man of gigantic frame, but of savage, unpleasant
  expression, clapped his hands together.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Tanya speaks the truth," he said, "but there are other
  things, too, in our blood."</p>

  <p>She pulled him by the sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," she enjoined. "The time is not yet."</p>

  <p>An officer from the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> drove up in a taxicab
  and on his way to the landing stage stared around him in amazement. A sudden
  silence fell upon the crowd at the sight of his uniform. He had an uneasy
  feeling that he was the cynosure of a hundred hostile gazes. He paused,
  however, and addressed one of the waiters whom he knew.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is this which goes on to-night?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"It is Mademoiselle Tanya, the great danseuse, who gives a party," the man
  explained.</p>

  <p>The officer smiled. He knew nothing of Mademoiselle, save as a danseuse.
  He looked towards the table where she sat and saluted. She waved her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Queer looking lot to-night," he muttered to the boatman who was lounging
  at the end of the pier, looking earnestly out to sea.</p>

  <p>"Shan't be sorry to see the back of 'em, sir," was the fervent reply.</p>

  <p>A gendarme, who was on duty all day to regulate the traffic, crept round
  to the back of the shed and mounted his bicycle. An inspiration had arrived
  to him. He had overheard scraps of the conversation at the head table where
  Tanya was seated with a little crowd of men whose appearance was not
  altogether festive.</p>

  <p>At their extemporised dining table on the fringe of the pine woods, which
  reached almost to the villa itself, General Perissol and Louise sat lingering
  over an unusually late dinner. From where they sat the bay was almost hidden
  although faint sounds of revelry below mounted at times to their hearing.
  Perissol, after many hours of hard and continuous fighting, was realising,
  perhaps for the first time, the glow of an undisturbed happiness. Louise,
  notwithstanding the new softness in her eyes and her general air of regained
  youth, showed some faint signs of anxiety as every now and then the strains
  of music and the faint echoes of laughter floated up from the <i>plage</i>.
  Coffee had been served and the servants had disappeared. She leaned forward
  and smoothed his hand.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she begged, "why you seem to worry no longer about the <i>Bird
  of Paradise</i>? Is there something which you have not confided to me?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in the world, my dear Louise," he assured her. "I have simply
  tried to look at the matter philosophically. The situation, as it exists down
  in the bay there, is a kind of stalemate. The young American is obstinate,
  perhaps not over-intelligent, but he is honest. He will not part with the
  boat or anything in her to a soul. She is his destined wedding present to
  Lucienne de Montelimar. There remains Edouard Mermillon, of course, and the
  Baron de Brett. I should find it hard to believe that Mermillon was
  personally concerned or incriminated in any records left by Tositi, but I can
  quite understand that for the sake of the stability of the Government he
  would loathe their appearance. On the other hand, what can he do about it?
  There lies the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> with her guns trained upon the
  <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, and powerful enough to blow her out of the water at
  any moment, and searchlights to prevent her crawling out at any hour in the
  dark. What then can happen? You see the situation is still within my
  reach."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"It should be within my province," he explained, "to land a mixed force of
  gendarmes and marines from the gunboat upon the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, and
  with all proper diplomatic excuses to young Wildburn seize her in the name of
  the French Government."</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," she said, "that is what I thought you would have
  done before now."</p>

  <p>"Supposing I did so," he went on. "Supposing, in the course of a search by
  technical experts, I discovered these reports concealed in her by the cunning
  of Tositi. Supposing they incriminated Chauvanne, Despard, Montelimar
  indirectly perhaps, and more important than anyone, Mermillon, would I dare
  to pass that evidence on to the Commission? Would I dare to attack Mermillon
  in the Chamber, or even to hint a word concerning the honour of the
  President? To do so would be to let loose the dogs of war with a vengeance.
  From the Pyrenees to the Channel France would be in the throes of an
  earthquake, and what that earthquake might not spell for her heaven only
  knows."</p>

  <p>The faint shadow of trouble in Louise's face deepened.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have left out one possible contingency, Armand," she reminded
  him. "There are men amongst the Communist party who are alive to every move
  in the game. I have noticed strange-looking people on the <i>plage</i> the
  last few days, and there is this woman from Marseilles&mdash;Tanya&mdash;who
they say
  is a very firebrand amongst them. Think what it would mean if these records,
  or whatever they are, fall into their hands. They would have no scruple in
  publishing them. To plunge France into a revolution is the only way they
  could ever come into power. Sometimes I think that that is the greatest
  danger we have to face. That man Clairemond, who writes for even some of the
  decent papers, is brilliantly clever, and when he commits himself to print he
  is almost convincing. They say his speeches are different, but amazingly
  eloquent."</p>

  <p>"You give me something to reflect upon, Louise," he admitted thoughtfully.
  "You put your hand upon the weak point in the situation without a doubt.
  Somehow or other Communism has failed so utterly wherever it has been put to
  the trial&mdash;Italy and Germany are glaring examples&mdash;that one thinks
of it all
  the time as discredited. After all, though, its fundamentals skilfully
  handled by a person of moderation might be dangerous enough just now. The
  patriotic Frenchman has had a great deal to forgive during the last twelve
  months. He will have a great deal more to forgive before we are in smooth
  waters again."</p>

  <p>"Supposing the Communists get hold of these records?" she persisted
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Under the guns of the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i>?" he asked
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"My dear Armand," she remonstrated, "there is one quality, at least, you
  must remember that the Communists possess. They possess a desperate fanatical
  courage. Listen!"</p>

  <p>There floated up to them from the <i>plage</i> below the strains of harsh
  but vivid singing in unison.</p>

  <p>"You hear that?" Louise exclaimed. "You know what it is. It is the
  marching song of the Communists&mdash;their battle song. Armand! Only half a
mile
  away from them lies the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. Supposing they know!"</p>

  <p>He rose quickly to his feet. She held his wrist. They both listened.
  Coming up the winding avenue they could hear the engine throbs of a
  high-powered car, the scrunching of gravel thrown away at the curves, then
  they saw the flashing of lights through the shrubs.</p>

  <p>"Wait, Armand," she begged. "Here comes news of some sort."</p>

  <p>The two men who hurried out on to the terrace, ushered there by Raymond
  with an entire lack of ceremony, were easily recognisable. There was Monsieur
  Vigon, the Mayor of Antibes, and by his side, a step or two already in front
  of him&mdash;for Monsieur Vigon had eaten of many banquets and was inclined
to be
  obese&mdash;came Sarciron, the local head of police.</p>

  <p>"We have disturbing news, sir, from below," Raymond said quickly.
  "Monsieur Sarciron, please make your report."</p>

  <p>Sarciron wasted no words.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Tanya, the danseuse," he announced, "who is perhaps the most
  dangerous figure amongst the Communists of the south here, is giving an
  extraordinary reception and dinner down on the <i>plage</i>. Fifty or sixty
  leaders of the party have come over from Marseilles in an autobus and all the
  leaders in this district from Cannes to Menton, and some few even from Lyons,
  have arrived. There are a hundred of them feasting there below and they seem
  to have some purpose. A report I have just received, General, declares that
  everyone of them is armed."</p>

  <p>"A dinner, eh? A feast?" the General exclaimed. "They sing&mdash;dance?
They
  seem jovial?"</p>

  <p>"They do nothing but sing the Red March," Sarciron declared. "They mean
  mischief if ever a hundred men did mean mischief. They have left the scum
  behind. These are strong men we have to deal with."</p>

  <p>"How many gendarmes can you send down to the <i>plage</i>?" the General
  asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Not more than a dozen, sir," Sarciron answered, "and two of them are
  under suspicion. They were discovered reading Communist literature."</p>

  <p>"Writing materials, Raymond, quickly. No, write yourself. Bring me the
  paper to sign. Write to Colonel Dupresson, or the Commanding Officer in
  charge of the Chasseurs Alpins at Antibes. Ask him to despatch one hundred to
  two hundred fully armed men, properly detailed on motor bicycles or in cars,
  to the <i>plage</i> here without a moment's delay. Write a similar letter to
  General Fausson at Nice, but send the message to Antibes first."</p>

  <p>Raymond shot away into the darkness. Perissol lifted the telephone which
  stood upon the table and spoke to the house. Presently a young man of
  disturbed appearance hurried out.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to report, sir," he announced, "that the private
  telephone service which we had established between the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> and this villa has been tampered with."</p>

  <p>"Tampered with?" the General repeated.</p>

  <p>"The wire is quite dead," the young man replied. "It has certainly been
  cut."</p>

  <p>"Go to the nearest point of the <i>plage</i>," Perissol ordered. "Swim or
  row to the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> and report. I shall send another
  messenger in case of accident. Ask them to fill their pinnace with as many
  fighting units as the ship can afford&mdash;fully armed. Tell the commander,
with
  my compliments, that we are expecting an attack upon the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i> by a gang of Communists. Order the car as you go out."</p>

  <p>The General took brusque leave of everybody.</p>

  <p>"Louise," he directed, "you remain here. Monsieur le Maire, if there is
  any sort of an aimed force you can muster at Antibes send them along,
  otherwise there is nothing you can do. Sarciron, back like the wind and bring
  all the gendarmes you can. Have your people telephone the alarm to Juan. Let
  it be understood that this is no ordinary Communist after-dinner riot. It is
  a serious affair with a serious object, and every Frenchman who refuses to
  serve on behalf of the law is asking for trouble. Spread that everywhere.
  What the mischief's that?"</p>

  <p>From down below in the bay came the dull booming of a gun. Almost
  immediately afterwards a strange sort of darkness seemed to hang over the
  bay. Louise ran lightly to the end of the terrace and jumped on to the
  parapet. She turned round&mdash;a shrouded, almost indistinguishable
figure.</p>

  <p>"The searchlights on the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> have stopped!" she
  cried.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Hamer Wildburn, with the great headlights of his coupe
flaming, swung
  round the last corner into the Garoupe lane which led to the <i>plage</i> and
  then jammed on his brakes furiously. Twenty or thirty yards in front of him
  someone was standing in the dusk swinging a lantern or torch. A shower of
  pebbles flew up. He skidded slightly but recovered. Finally he brought the
  car to a standstill within a few feet of the man in the road.</p>

  <p>"What the devil&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped. The man was well enough known, to him, one of the staff
  of the bathing beach who waited on him day by day. Something in his
  expression checked Hamer's outburst.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" the latter demanded, leaning a little wearily over the
  wheel. "What's wrong. Pierre?"</p>

  <p>The man put a foot upon the step and held on to the dashboard.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to say what is wrong, Monsieur," he said, "but you
  should keep away. If you must return to your boat to-night go to the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> landing stage and borrow a dinghy from there."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth should I put myself to all that trouble?" Hamer asked in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>The man tightened his grip upon the car.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he confided, "there's bad business on at the <i>plage</i>,
  that is my belief, for all the gaiety and the popping of corks and the crowd
  of people. They have shoved me off, the Crestners have. They do not wish me
  around to-night. They will not have any of the regular staff. They have
  driven us out without dinner or excuse."</p>

  <p>Hamer was as tired as any man might be who had driven 500 kilometres
  without stopping from a 'plane that lay smashed to pieces in a ditch, and a
  pilot on his way to hospital with a broken leg. He leaned forward to one of
  the pockets of the car, drew out a flask and took a drink of whisky.</p>

  <p>"Try and explain, Pierre," he begged. "I shall be better able to ask you
  questions in a moment."</p>

  <p>"It's that young dancing woman that's been creating such a furore at
  Juan-les-Pins," Pierre explained. "She's giving a huge party to-night.
  Crestners are not receiving any other guests and they've had to order 20 or
  30 more tables. Nearly all the people have come from a distance and,
  Monsieur, they're a wicked crowd or I never saw one. Forty came from
  Marseilles in one autobus. They looked like cut-throats and the lot from Nice
  were not much better."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't suppose they'll stop me getting on my boat," Hamer
  observed.</p>

  <p>"That I know they mean to do," was the emphatic warning. "There's four of
  them standing in that little opening and no four criminals who ever stood
  together looked worse than they do! They've just stopped one young fellow in
  the darkness. I heard them ask his name and where he was going. They thought
  it was you."</p>

  <p>"So I am the unpopular person, am I?" Hamer exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what they want," Pierre answered; "but I do know the order
  is that if you come you are to be stopped. What's to happen to you I don't
  know, but you are not to be allowed on your boat."</p>

  <p>"Have any of them gone on board?" Hamer asked.</p>

  <p>"A boatload," the man replied; "and it seemed to me there was another
  boatload getting ready when I left. This is not like the other night, sir,"
  he went on, "when you threw them young gents into the sea. That was more or
  less of a lark, I expect. There's no lark about this. You know what sort of
  people these are?"</p>

  <p>"How the devil should I?" Hamer asked wearily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you. Communists&mdash;anarchists&mdash;the riff-raff of
Marseilles
  and Nice. They have been singing the Red Victory March all through
  dinner-time. And that Mademoiselle Tanya, she's been making speeches to them
  till they nearly roared the awning off. They're like a lot of madmen. You
  turn round, sir, and get back to the hotel or somewhere safe. That boat of
  yours isn't worth what they say they're going to do to you if you interfere
  with them."</p>

  <p>Hamer thought hard for several moments. Gradually the situation became
  clearer to him.</p>

  <p>"The gunboat is still lying there?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong about her, too," Pierre declared. "I don't know
  anything about it, Monsieur Wildburn, and I don't want to say anything that
  leads to trouble, but her communications with the shore are broken and I
  could have sworn I heard firing on board a few minutes ago...Don't you try to
  get back by the <i>plage</i>, Monsieur Wildburn. There's at least a hundred
  and twenty men down there&mdash;picked men, I should say. They may have had a
  bottle or two of wine and a drink of brandy; but that's made them the more
  dangerous. They're not going to let you on board. You keep out of it. Your
  boat isn't worth it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right, Pierre," Hamer admitted. "I'll keep out of it. What
  about you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my room is just at the corner, sir. I'm like you&mdash;I'm going to
keep
  out of it. I don't understand what it's all about, but what I do know is that
  if the marines from the gunboat interfere or the gendarmes come down there's
  going to be a bloody fight. It's not my affair. I'm off to the wife and
  children."</p>

  <p>"You're a good fellow, Pierre. Were you up here looking for me?"</p>

  <p>"I was, sir," the man acknowledged. "There's been a rumour going round
  that you were on your way here. Then there was another rumour that you had
  had a smash in an aeroplane. Then someone else thought that you had got a car
  at Lyons. There's just one thing, sir, I must mention. That wicked looking
  young woman who has got them all on fire, she gave her orders, and they were
  not half orders, either! You were to be stopped going on your boat, but if
  you came to any harm without her instructions she was going to shoot the man
  who did it."</p>

  <p>Hamer smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"She's a great person in the wrong place, Pierre," he said, slowly
  commencing to back down the lane with Pierre standing on the step. "She's the
  disciple of a dangerous faith&mdash;sublime for some, hell for others who
have no
  understanding."</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand, monsieur," he confessed.</p>

  <p>Hamer only shook his head. They had reached the corner of the road, and
  Pierre stepped off the car. Hamer turned round and threw in his clutch.</p>

  <p>"You take my advice sir, and clear right away." Pierre begged. "If you
  show yourself on the <i>plage</i>&mdash;Mademoiselle Tanya or no Mademoiselle
  Tanya&mdash;they mean bloodshed."</p>

  <p>"I'm making for shelter all right, Pierre," Hamer assured him, with a
  farewell wave of a hand.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, with lights extinguished, Hamer drove through the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> woods, past the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> itself, and down
  the steep way that led to the private landing stage. Here he left the car in
  a sheltered spot, and from behind a clump of trees looked out upon the bay.
  In a sense it was an amazing sight. The restaurant seemed to be packed with
  dark figures. Some of the tables were dragged out on to the sands. One heard
  voices shouting for the waiters, demanding more wine. One man had fallen off
  his chair and lay on the sands, but on the whole there were few signs of
  drunkenness&mdash;more of ferocious waiting. Little companies of men were
walking
  arm-in-arm along the edge of the water. Many were standing looking out
  seawards&mdash;arguing, talking with one another. Around the bar they were
  standing three or four deep. Madame's plump, comely form could be seen
  leaning over the counter where she was still opening wine, still filling the
  glasses. Out in the bay there seemed to be a good deal of movement upon the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i>, but very little illumination. The searchlights
  which had been in full swing, were inactive. It was all Hamer could do to
  make out the dim shape of the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. There were lights in
  her galley but some attempt seemed to have been made to shade them. From the
  rigging there was a single lantern hanging on the starboard side...</p>

  <p>Hamer often wondered afterwards at the deliberation which marked his
  actions for the next half-an-hour or so. There were several courses which
  occurred to him. One was to swim out to the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> and
  consult Commander Berard as to how to deal with the situation, taking into
  account the possible invasion of his own boat. He discarded that because it
  was perfectly obvious that there was something wrong on the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i> herself. As to the <i>plage</i>&mdash;Pierre's
  warning had been quite justified.</p>

  <p>Hamer seemed to be developing instincts altogether strange to him. He
  listened for several moments before he moved and he resisted with an effort
  an intense desire to light a cigarette. He covered over the engine of his car
  with a rug, looked round it to be sure that all was in order, although there
  was in his mind a grave doubt as to whether he should ever use it again,
  stripped himself of everything but his underclothes and shoes, and made his
  way carefully down the precipitous slope to the rocky edge of the bay. He
  kept inside the enclosed part of the wood until he was at the nearest point
  to the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>, then he scaled the wall, waded out over the
  happy hunting-grounds of the fishers for sea-urchins, kicked off his shoes
  and swam very softly and slowly towards the yacht. It seemed lo him that the
  very fact of his lazy strokes, his disappearance every now and then under
  water altogether, incited an unnatural activity of his brain. He thought out
  the possibilities. Tanya would have selected, perhaps, half a dozen of the
  strongest and most dependable of her adherents to seize the boat. She had
  probably received from somewhere or other an idea as to where to search. The
  men were at work now, without a doubt, breaking open the secret parts of the
  boat very likely endangering her seaworthy qualities. Possibly they were
  working right down in the hull where sounds would only come to them in a
  muffled undernote. They would keep a look-out, though.</p>

  <p>That must be reckoned with...</p>

  <p>Slowly he came up to the surface. The easterly wind was sending in a good
  many white-flecked waves now and he hoped that his head would be quite
  invisible. There was a muffled glare of light in one place in the galley and
  a subdued light aft. He could just make out the dinghy rocking rather
  violently about ten yards from the stern. It was towards this he directed his
  very cautious movements. His sense of distance was accurate enough, for when
  again he came up he was within a few feet of the dinghy. He turned on his
  back, listened intently and watched. There was a man on deck seated by the
  companionway, obviously the man on guard. He seemed almost formless but he
  was smoking a cigarette, the thin end of which was a point in the gloom.
  Hamer swam on a few more strokes until he could clutch the bows of the dinghy
  He rested there for a moment to take breath, then very slowly he hoisted
  himself into the boat He had made no sound and the man on deck had apparently
  heard nothing. The point of light from his cigarette was still obliquely
  turned away. Hamer leaned forward and scrutinised the lights on the
  <i>plage</i>. They were all very vague and indistinct from this distance but
  there was a gramophone going and plenty of people moving about. Nothing was
  to be seen on the stretch of sea between him and the <i>plage</i>. There was
  no sound of cars which might have indicated approaching danger. Slowly he
  began to paddle with his hands, first with one, swinging the dinghy round to
  the reverse side on which the lookout man was seated and afterwards paddling
  very slowly, moving her only a foot or so at a time until she came in touch
  with the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> herself. He caught hold of the chains and
  pulled himself stealthily, along. As soon as he was exactly behind the man
  seated on the other side he pulled himself up by the chains and, with
  absolute noiselessness, reached the deck. Arrived there he crouched down for
  a moment behind the small water reservoir. The man on the other side
  continued to smoke. From down in the galley there came the sound of
  voices&mdash;eager, staccato voices which might well have belonged to men
engaged
  upon a desperate search. He peeped in through one of the portholes. The door
  leading from the galley into the little salon was closed and the salon in
  darkness. That in itself was an immense relief. Once down the companionway he
  could enter his bedroom and barricade himself in. He felt around until he
  found what he sought&mdash;an iron spanner which was used to unscrew the
orifices
  which permitted the entrance of fresh water. He balanced it in his
  hand&mdash;perhaps just heavy enough. He had instinctively a hatred of
bloodshed
  but he was nerved at that moment for a great enterprise and nothing else
  intervened. He crawled a step backwards until he was exactly behind the
  dozing man. He raised himself on his knees. He crept inch by inch a little
  nearer, then with his left hand he gripped the boom. With his right he raised
  and brought down the spanner he was carrying with the whole of his strength
  on to the head of the dozing man.</p>

  <p>For the first time Hamer abandoned then those stealthy movements which had
  been a continual strain upon him. His victim had slithered sideways and the
  cry which burst through his lips in momentary agony died away in a sort of
  gurgle, so that it was doubtful whether anyone below could hear him. Hamer
  sprang down the companionway in one leap, slipped through the entrance into
  his own cabin, locked and bolted the door.</p>

  <p>Even then he was not sate, for a revolver through any of the portholes
  would follow him wherever he went. He closed all these and screwed them up
  there was still no noticeable sound. He tore out a jersey and a pair of
  trousers, slipped one revolver into his hip pocket and rapidly loaded the
  heavier one of army type which he kept in a drawer below his wardrobe. Then
  he sat down on the edge of his bunk. It appeared to him that the time had
  arrived for a little further reflection. Scarcely half a dozen breathless
  seconds had passed, however, before he leaped to his feet with a cold
  shiver&mdash;not perhaps of fear but born of some sense of impending danger.
  Something on the bed had moved. On his first entrance he had seen a little
  mound of clothes and forgotten it. He caught hold of the counterpane with his
  left hand, holding his gun tightly in his right. Again, what he saw nearly
  forced an interjection from his lips. Auguste, bound hand and foot, with a
  gag in his mouth and a nasty cut under his right eye, was lying there
  breathing faintly&mdash;unshaven and dishevelled, J a ghastly sight on the
blood
  stained bedclothes. There was life enough in the man, however, for him to
  shake his head as though in warning.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Hamer always afterwards believed that his actions in that
brief hour or
  two were governed by some automatic function as well as by the quick working
  of his brain. He had made no sound at Auguste's touch, he uttered no
  exclamation when he saw him. In half a dozen seconds his clasp knife was
  working at the leather thongs which secured the gags. In less than a minute
  Auguste was a free man. It was the latter then who broke the spell. With the
  urge for silence instinctively forced upon both of them, he permitted himself
  the slightest of groans as he tried to swing himself on to his feet.</p>

  <p>"How did Monsieur arrive here?" he asked. "Swam from the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> rocks," Hamer whispered. "I had to smash a fellow's head
  in who was on deck. He's lying still enough. How many of the others are
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Seven." Auguste answered. "They came in Crestner's old longboat. Seven of
  them&mdash;bad men all. Knives as well as guns."</p>

  <p>"What are they doing now?"</p>

  <p>"Tinkering with the mast. They are looking for hidden records."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle has not been round?" Hamer asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Late this afternoon. She went away when she found you were not here."</p>

  <p>"Where's Jean?"</p>

  <p>"Went after the water two hours ago. I expect they knocked him on the
  head."</p>

  <p>Hamer paused for a moment. There was a sound forward as though of sawing
  wood, a mumble of voices.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't the searchlights playing from the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i>?" Hamer demanded. "What's happened to them
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Mutiny," was the brief response. "There's been fighting on deck for an
  hour. Some of these men who are on board here brought pals from Toulon. They
  got amongst the sailors."</p>

  <p>"Any fight left in you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm still giddy, sir, but I'll do my best," Auguste promised, sitting
  up.</p>

  <p>Hamer handed him the smaller gun.</p>

  <p>"Don't use it unless we are hard pressed," he enjoined. "I don't
  understand why the Crestners haven't sent somebody out to see what's on."</p>

  <p>Auguste snorted.</p>

  <p>"The young woman who's giving the party there and brought all this gang
  down is her old friend," he said. "She knew all of these stage women."</p>

  <p>"So it is Mademoiselle Tanya, then?"</p>

  <p>"That's her name," Auguste assented. "She ordered supper for a hundred
  to-night and they're all here, too, and a few over. If we could have got word
  to the General on the hill," he concluded wistfully, "there is the man who
  would have swept this lot up."</p>

  <p>Hamer suddenly stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, Auguste," he warned him. "They've opened the galley
  door."</p>

  <p>A babel of excited voices reached their ears. Hamer slipped back the bolt.
  His gun was still clutched firmly in his right hand, but he swung round
  towards Auguste.</p>

  <p>"Look here Auguste," he said. "We can't fight in here; we should just be
  like rats in a trap. I'm going to open the door. If these fellows have found
  what they wanted perhaps they will go away quietly. If they haven't, we may
  as well have it out with them face to face."</p>

  <p>There was no time for consultation. Hamer threw open the door. He stood in
  the small space with the open door of the salon in front of him, the steps on
  to the deck on his left, the small toilet room on his right. His right hand
  gripping his revolver was outstretched, but the barrel pointed downwards. He
  had a lightning-like impression of four men seated at the table, one on the
  threshold of the galley, another fidgeting about behind. One of the men at
  the table was busy with a corkscrew and a bottle of champagne.</p>

  <p>"Help yourselves, gentlemen," Hamer invited. "Anything I have here on
  board is at your service, but if your hands go down to your pockets there's
  going to be trouble."</p>

  <p>They all turned their faces towards him&mdash;an evil-looking crowd, most
of
  them of the sleek desperado type. One, the furthest from him, wearing a
  pince-nez, might have been a clerk in some public office. The lapel of his
  coat was torn as though some button had been removed for the occasion. Still
  holding his hands above his head, he rose to his feet and addressed a few
  rapid words to his companions. The man in the galley, whose hand had been
  stealing downwards, paused. He kept his eyes on Hamer, though, and very
  wicked eyes they were.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"This is my own boat, anyway," was the swift reply. "What I should like to
  know is what you others are doing here."</p>

  <p>The man with the pince-nez evidently had some authority. He swept aside a
  chorus of blasphemous rejoinders.</p>

  <p>"If you are Wildburn," he said, "I will answer your question. We came here
  to find a message left for us upon this boat. We have the plan of the place.
  You may have bought the boat, but you never bought the message. We came to
  search for it, to take it&mdash;by force if necessary. The message is gone.
The
  hiding-places are empty."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do with me," Hamer disclaimed. "I know nothing of any hiding
  places on this boat, nor anyone who has left messages for you or anyone else.
  I bought the yacht from an agent in Marseilles."</p>

  <p>"Listen," the man of the pince-nez went on, "You can almost see from where
  you stand. Your foremast is in sections. There are seventeen of them
  altogether, in number one, three, seven, nine, fourteen, and two other
  numbers there were records concealed. In case of disaster to our comrade they
  were to be used on his behalf. Our comrade was murdered. We came to find
  those records and the places where they were are empty."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Hamer asked.</p>

  <p>"There is no necessity for me to answer your question," was the sneering
  retort. "We are here. We hold the bay as we hold your ship. Those papers have
  gone. It is you who must have removed them. You might have time to shoot a
  couple of us before we got to work, but there are five more left on board,
  and a hundred on the <i>plage</i>, besides a few comrades over there on the
  gunboat. You have not one chance in a thousand of getting out of this alive,
  unless you tell us where to find those records. Make up your mind quick."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are quite light to tell me to hurry," Wildburn scoffed. "You
  will see your hundred men on the <i>plage</i> legging it for their holes in a
  few minutes, and you will feel the handcuffs on your wrists in less if you
  don't clear out of this. There's a gentlemen on the hill there who knows
  something about you fellows. He will be here when he's ready."</p>

  <p>Hamer's words carried conviction. Two of the men half-rose to their
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Get at it, Laporte," one of them shouted. "Cut your words short. The
  records or a bullet."</p>

  <p>"My comrades are impatient, you see," their spokesman went on, "have you
  those records?"</p>

  <p>"I have not. I know nothing about them. I have never seen them."</p>

  <p>"Who are your crew?"</p>

  <p>"One named Jean went for water two or three hours ago. He is still on the
  <i>plage</i>."</p>

  <p>"Right," the other replied. "He is locked up. Who else?"</p>

  <p>"Auguste, my <i>matelot</i>, whom you seem to have disposed of pretty
  well."</p>

  <p>"Is he the man who can neither read nor write?"</p>

  <p>"You have been correctly informed," Wildburn answered. "He can neither
  read nor write. He would not know what your records were if he saw them, and
  he happens to be an honest fellow. If he found anything on this ship which
  had been secreted, he would bring it to me."</p>

  <p>"Whom have you allowed to search this ship?"</p>

  <p>"I have allowed no one," Wildburn declared. "It seems to me that you have
  been fooled. The agents must have known all about these hiding places. They
  probably took care to empty them before they sold the boat."</p>

  <p>The man with the pince-nez bit his nails furiously. He looked over the
  tops of his fingers at Hamer, and all the malice in the world was in that
  look.</p>

  <p>"We have reason to believe," he said, "that the records were here in their
  places not a week ago. If they had been disturbed, all France would have been
  disturbed. There are some secrets that could never be kept, and the finding
  of these records would have been one of them."</p>

  <p>Two of the fiercest-looking of the men at the table rose and shouted one
  against the other.</p>

  <p>"Thirty seconds," the one with the louder voice yelled. "Give him 30
  seconds, Laporte. It is enough. We will tear the truth out of him. One of us
  may get a bullet. Who cares? We will have his tongue out of his head. There
  are seven of us and plenty more to come. It is for The Cause, you others! He
  is lying to us, this man. Thirty seconds! No more."</p>

  <p>The man with the pince-nez looked deprecatingly across at Hamer. He
  appeared, as he was, the perfect hypocrite.</p>

  <p>"I regret, monsieur," he said. "Mine would have been the gentler way but I
  am over-ruled. You may pay with your life if you cannot tell us anything more
  about those records. I shall begin to count. One&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hamer held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"One second," he begged. "On my word of honour I will make no movement. I
  ask you&mdash;all of you or any one of you who likes. Get on your knees. Look
  through those portholes. When you have seen what I can see perhaps you may
  reflect. They would not think much of hanging seven men for one murder so
  long as those men came from Marseilles."</p>

  <p>Somehow or other they believed him. The sight they saw was alarming
  enough. From the narrow point where the road curved to Antibes right past the
  rival restaurant along the road to Crestner's there seemed to be one tangle
  of flashing lights. Vehicles of some sort were streaming down from the hill.
  Their lights flared through the closely-grown pine woods. Everywhere was an
  orgy of illumination, and even while they looked there was a clear sonorous
  voice from immediately below.</p>

  <p>"<i>Bird of Paradise</i> ahoy! Commander Berard from the
  <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i>."</p>

  <p>"Get any men?" Hamer shouted.</p>

  <p>"Twenty&mdash;and thirty coming. We have had trouble but it is over. We are
  coming on board."</p>

  <p>"Put out to sea," the most desperate of the men demanded, watching the
  others struggling into the galley. "Never mind whether you have time or not.
  Gino, start the engine!"</p>

  <p>Hamer laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"Look out of the porthole, you fool," he said. "Can't you feel the sea
  beneath your feet? If the anchors hold we are safe here, but it would take
  you half an hour to get them up. We are on a corps mort. There is no harbour
  on this coast you could get the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> into when you had
  them up."</p>

  <p>There was the sound outside of the men jumping into the cutter in which
  they had arrived. Only the man of the pince-nez remained in his place. He sat
  at the table with folded arms.</p>

  <p>"I am in charge of the political side of this visit," he declared. "I am
  not armed. I have nothing to do with those threats. We were here merely to
  recover our stolen property."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of firing outside. Berard sprang over the side and
  came crashing down the stairs. There were a dozen marines behind him.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven you're safe, Wildburn!" he exclaimed. "Who is this?"</p>

  <p>"I have not been presented," Hamer replied. "I found him on board the
  ship. He was the leader of the boarding party who are just making for the
  <i>plage</i>."</p>

  <p>Berard signed to two of the marines behind him.</p>

  <p>"I am Deputy Laporte." the little man said with stuttering dignity. No
  true Frenchman will lay a hand upon me."</p>

  <p>"We will see about that," the commander answered tersely. "There are
  several true Frenchmen of the type you talk about already in irons, and one
  or two of them shot."</p>

  <p>The deputy shivered.</p>

  <p>"I have not broken the law," he complained. "I am here to search for the
  property of a comrade."</p>

  <p>The commander smiled, rather a ferocious looking effort at mirth.</p>

  <p>"You are one of the men," he said sternly, "who was distributing those
  secret pamphlets, one of which I found on the <i>Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;</i>.
  It was you who brought a handful of them to the marines I had placed on guard
  here. You know the penalty for doing that, I suppose, to sailors or soldiers
  in uniform?"</p>

  <p>The little man was ghastly white, but he bluffed once more.</p>

  <p>"When the day comes," he threatened, "officers of the French army or navy
  with a black mark against their names will be the first to suffer. In a few
  minutes my bodyguard will be here. We have a hundred men in the
  <i>plage</i>."</p>

  <p>"Take him on board and lock him up," Berard ordered, "then come back and
  fetch me. Have a look at your hundred men if your eyes are good enough," he
  advised Laporte. "There are four hundred soldiers from the barracks at
  Antibes on the <i>plage</i>, and more streaming in&mdash;and pretty well all
the
  gendarmes in the neighbourhood. They will have to open the old military
  prison at Antibes to hold your lot to-night."</p>

  <p>The little man shrunk back in his corner.</p>

  <p>"You can't arrest me!" he expostulated. "I have already told you that I am
  a deputy&mdash;Deputy Laporte of the Rhone Department."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you are, so much the worse for you," Berard replied. "Sergeant,
  my idea is changed," he went on, turning to his man. "Take him ashore. Hand
  him over to the officer in command of the <i>chasseurs</i>. Tell them who he
  is. I won't have him on my ship. He will be safer in Antibes prison. Tell
  them he was in command of the expedition here, and is taking the
  responsibility for it."</p>

  <p>Laporte made a show of dignity.</p>

  <p>"There will come a time," he prophesied, as he rose to his feet, "when you
  will listen to another sort of command."</p>

  <p>Berard laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether you will be there to hear it, my little friend," he said,
  waving the man away.</p>

  <p>"Any casualties?" the commander asked, as he seated himself opposite to
  Hamer Wildburn, a bottle of Scotch whisky and a syphon between them.</p>

  <p>"Only my <i>matelot</i> here a trifle knocked about," Hamer replied,
  pouring some whisky into a tumbler and passing it to him. "Then there's a man
  I hit on the head with a spanner lying on the deck. Auguste, just have a look
  round behind and report. I'm afraid they've made a mess of your galley."</p>

  <p>"They have ruined the mizzen-mast," the man muttered. "Here's wishing you
  good health, sir," he added, helping himself very sparsely to the soda water.
  "I hope if ever I find myself again in a scrap like this that I shall be next
  a gentleman who holds his gun as steady as you, Monsieur Hamer. You had 'em
  scared for a minute or so, sir, the whole lot of them."</p>

  <p>Berard also helped himself to a long drink, for now that the excitement
  was passed he was obviously depressed.</p>

  <p>"It's the one thing, this, in the navy." he explained to Hamer, "that we
  dread. Everything in the shape of mutiny reflects back on the officers. I
  wouldn't have believed it with some of the men. There was one I shot with my
  own hand. He was only married last week and going on leave to-morrow. There's
  plenty of this sort of stuff at Toulon, of course, but I never dreamt there
  was any of it here or I would have curtailed leave."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry, old chap," Hamer said, patting him on the shoulder. "You
  don't suppose I shall forget that you turned up here in the nick of time. I
  think they meant business&mdash;that little deputy fellow especially. They
  wouldn't believe that we had not got the papers or whatever it was they were
  searching for."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad you made straight for the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>," Berard
  declared. "There was something suspicious about the way she was lying so
  quietly. They put my searchlights out of order, but I knew that was a strange
  boat alongside. What the devil were they after?"</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn shook his head. "I think I know," he said.</p>

  <p>They mounted the companionway at the sound of oars. A junior officer
  saluted and reported to Berard.</p>

  <p>"The fighting is all over, sir. Ten of the <i>chasseurs</i> were killed
  and two gendarmes wounded, and one of our men got a bullet in his leg. Twenty
  of that Communist rag-tag and bobtail are stretched out there, half a dozen
  or so escaped, and the rest are for Antibes and Grasse prisons. It is all
  quiet now, and the place locked up."</p>

  <p>"What about Mademoiselle Tanya," Wildburn asked.</p>

  <p>"Madame Crestner drove her off directly the shooting began. They will
  arrest her when they want her."</p>

  <p>"If there's nothing more I can do," Berard observed, holding out his hand
  to Hamer, "I had better be looking after my own little troubles. We have
  brought you back your second <i>matelot</i>&mdash;Jean. They simply locked
him up
  and refused to let him come back. Shall I leave you an escort?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least necessary," Hamer declared. "I think they're all
  satisfied that what they want is not on the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>. Besides,
  they're pretty well cleaned up for the night."</p>

  <p>He strolled on deck and waved his hand to Berard as he stepped into the
  pinnace. The sea had gone down, and the moon was beginning to shine dimly
  through the misty bank of clouds. There were several stationary vehicles
  still at La Garoupe, but the place itself was in darkness. Neither did the
  <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> show any sign of life. The lights along the coast road
  had been extinguished. Only the lighthouse still flung its long beam across
  the bay over the dark woods and out seawards. Hamer descended the
  companionway and entered the saloon. Auguste was standing there with a
  somewhat puzzled look upon his face.</p>

  <p>"I ask myself, monsieur," he said, taking from under his arm a pair of
  disreputable and ragged blue trousers. "It could not have been by any chance
  this rubbish that all them people have been smelling around after?"</p>

  <p>He lifted the trousers up by the legs and shook them. Odd rolls of paper,
  what seemed to be the stubs of many empty cheque books, a package of letters,
  and a larger packet of more formal-looking documents stamped with the seal of
  the French Republic, were shaken out on to the table. Then, last of all, with
  a black seal upon the envelope, was a letter addressed to three names:</p>

  <p>"<i>A Monsieur Edouard Mermillon, Monsieur le Baron Albert de Brett, ou
  Monsieur Eugene Chauvanne</i>."</p>

  <p>Hamer stared at them in amazement. He had remained cool throughout a
  somewhat disturbing night, but he suddenly felt the walls of the little
  saloon spinning round him. Auguste scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"I emptied this rubbish out of those places in the mast months ago, and
  laid them away in this old pair of trousers," he explained. "Me not being
  able to read, they seemed just like rubbish."</p>

  <p>"Just rubbish." Hamer repeated.</p>

  <p>Like a man in a dream he rose to his feet. He held the bottom of one of
  the legs of the soiled, disreputable trousers in one hand and he passed the
  other to Auguste, then one by one he picked up the alarming-looking pile of
  documents and papers which lay upon the table, and dropped them down into
  their crude hiding-place. In addition to the papers which had first caught
  his eye, there were many others full of equally potent significance. There
  was a batch of perfumed and coroneted letters. There were at least a dozen
  independent cheque books&mdash;some not half-used. There was one loose
cheque, the
  figures of which seemed to reach from one end of the blue oblong strip to the
  other. There were hastily scrawled letters. There was a parchment-bound
  cipher with a marvellous key. And there were deeds with great seals upon
  them&mdash;black and red and green. In they all went, and still scarcely
realising
  what he was doing, Wildburn rolled up the trousers and secured them with a
  soiled white canvas belt. He held the bundle under his arm and turned towards
  Auguste. His knees were none too steady. Auguste looked at him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I have done wrong, monsieur?" he asked, in a tone of deep concern.</p>

  <p>Hamer shook his head, but found speech difficult.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, Auguste," he answered truthfully enough.</p>

  <p>As the dawn was breaking Auguste, with a cup of tea on a tray, made his
  way into his master's cabin. Still fully dressed, still with his hand upon
  the butt of his revolver, Hamer was lying in a semi-recumbent position upon
  the bed.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has not slept?" Auguste asked disconsolately.</p>

  <p>Hamer waved the question away. It seemed unimportant.</p>

  <p>"You have not spoke to Jean?" he asked. "Not I, monsieur," Auguste
  declared.</p>

  <p>Hamer swung himself into a sitting position. He looked at Auguste as no
  other man had ever looked at him in his life.</p>

  <p>"You have seen no one else this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul, monsieur."</p>

  <p>"Swear on the head of your mother and the souls of your children that you
  will open your lips to no one."</p>

  <p>"I swear," Auguste, who was a religious man, said solemnly.</p>

  <p>Hamer Wildburn drank his tea and went back to bed.</p>

  <p>"Sit on the steps outside, Auguste," he directed. "Call me in an hour. If
  anyone approaches the boat wake me. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand, monsieur," Auguste promised.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">Monsieur Leon Crotieres, member of the Acad&eacute;mie
Francais, and
  perhaps the most distinguished of modern European historians, paused in his
  labours and looked downwards from the grounds of his villa into the Bay of
  Garoupe. He pointed to a very graceful thirty-ton yacht below which was
  flying the flags of France and the United States.</p>

  <p>"My task," he said to his wife, who was also his secretary, "would be an
  easier one if that boat, like the singing barge of Ulysses, could talk."</p>

  <p>His wife laid down her pencil. The summer heat was making her indolent,
  and she, too, was glad to pause.</p>

  <p>"Explain, <i>mon cher</i>," she begged. "What is there that boat could
  tell you that you do not know already?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps nothing," he admitted, "and perhaps a great deal. You knew that
  she once belonged to a famous, or rather an infamous, financier who was
  supposed to be responsible for that terrible period of speculation and
  corruption on a gigantic scale which very nearly brought France to her knees
  a year or so ago?"</p>

  <p>"Yes I remember hearing that."</p>

  <p>"There was a rumour that this financier had built on board a marvellous
  hiding place where he kept letters and bank books, and all sorts of evidence
  which would have destroyed the reputations of half the famous men in France
  if they had been found."</p>

  <p>"I remember that, too," she acknowledged. "It made the drama of his murder
  so intensely interesting. The police broke in and shot him on the morning of
  the investigation."</p>

  <p>Her husband nodded absently.</p>

  <p>"Supposing they had not," he meditated. "Think how differently the history
  of France during those few years might have been written. If ever there was a
  case of evil having been done that good might come of it I should think that
  it was there."</p>

  <p>"You have theories?" she asked He smiled and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I have theories," he admitted. "My dear, to be a true historian you must
  have imagination. You are permitted theories but you may not write about
  them. I figure to myself that that marvellous secret hiding place existed,
  inaccessible unless the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> had been almost
  disembowelled. I picture to myself that on the night of the Communist riot
  down below, the time when Tanya was singing and stirring the blood of all
  Frenchmen&mdash;her Communist songs in secret, her exquisite lyrics before the
  world&mdash;well, I picture to myself that at that time, when there is no
doubt
  that the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> was seized by Communists and was almost
  broken to pieces there in the harbour, these secret documents really were
  discovered."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to write this," his wife asked eagerly, "because it sounds
  as though it might become immensely interesting?"</p>

  <p>He smiled again.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I could not write it because it is only a theory, and if I knew
  it for a fact, still I should have to follow the path that those far greater
  men than I have trodden."</p>

  <p>"You mean forget?"</p>

  <p>"I mean destroy. Sometimes I see it almost in a mirage, and I have hard
  work to convince myself that it was not the truth."</p>

  <p>"Tell me at least, Leon, what you mean."</p>

  <p>"I believe honestly," he declared, "that either one of the Communists
  themselves, or someone amongst the defending party, who drove them away,
  really did discover those secret records."</p>

  <p>"Then what has become of them now?"</p>

  <p>"How can one tell? I can sometimes imagine myself going through that agony
  of thought and doubt&mdash;what to do with them?...There have been whispers
about
  so many great men. Supposing they had all been implicated!"</p>

  <p>"Supposing they had. Would it not have been well for the whole truth to
  come out?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what would have happened. Tanya knew&mdash;she who had
planned
  that Communist meeting here, planted Communists on the gunboat, gave that
  great party down on the beach&mdash;she knew well what would have happened.
She
  knew well that there would not have been a man in France who could have taken
  up the government, or even have served in a Government. The people had
  suffered enough already. Their nerves were stretched to breaking-point. They
  would have been up in arms in every city in France. France would have gone
  Communist, and Communism, you know, my dear, which is all very well in theory
  when poets talk of it, and dreamers play the men of action, would really ruin
  body and soul of any country which was governed according to its axioms."</p>

  <p>"But she recovered even after the Revolution," his wife reminded him.</p>

  <p>"This would have been worse. To begin with, she would have been overrun at
  once by Germany. She would have become a vassal State. She would have become
  the scorn of the world. I picture to myself that some man was great enough to
  scatter that evidence to the four winds of heaven and place their
fates&mdash;the
  fates of the guilty&mdash;back in their own hands with a pledge to work out
their
  redemption."</p>

  <p>Madame Crotieres moistened the tip of her pencil between her lips. She was
  an extraordinarily pretty woman, and in her eyes at that moment there was a
  light of longing.</p>

  <p>"If only you could have written this," she murmured. "If only you could
  have been the discoverer."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"By chance, my dear," he said, "I know who was on the yacht with that
  young American the day after the fighting, and he, I think, was the one man
  great enough to have been the saviour of France. You yourself, my dear, when
  our work is completed, should be able to divine the truth. You will never
  know it any other way...This morning, you see, the sun is hot and the wind is
  sweet, and one has fancies. Presently we must go back to our work and write
  of the day when General Perissol became President of France."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>"Darling," Mrs. Hamer Wildburn pouted, "why were you in such a hurry to
  get away from the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> this morning? I had heaps of things to
  do, and I am not at all sure that I have not forgotten half the lunch." Hamer
  looked up to the skies. One hand rested upon the wheel of the <i>Bird of
  Paradise</i>, and one arm was around his wife's waist as she sat in the pit
  by his side.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he confided, "your father awoke this morning in a most
  determined frame of mind. All this summer he has been praying me to accept
  the <i>Hermoine</i>. This morning I fled to escape argument."</p>

  <p>She nodded understandingly.</p>

  <p>"It would give him so much pleasure, Hamer, if you would accept it. You
  know what he thinks of you. There is nothing in the whole world good
  enough."</p>

  <p>He drew her a little closer. Auguste had just looked round. The anchor was
  up. Jean was busy with the sail. The wind was fair for their cruise. Watching
  the sails closely Hamer swung the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> a few points to
  leeward.</p>

  <p>"Your father has already given me the most precious thing in the world,
  Lucienne," he declared. "I don't want anything else. We have quite as much
  money as is good for us, and since you won dad's heart so completely we have
  to face the certainty of becoming multimillionaires some day. I have heaps of
  work when I can find time for it, and we have that marvellous youngster for a
  plaything. How could I be happier with a two hundred ton yacht? If you want
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> and you," she whispered with her lips
  perilously near to his ear. "I think I wanted them from the day I thought I
  was going to drown and you pulled me on board."</p>

  <p>More dignified in presence than ever, as upright as a year or so before,
  the handsomest president Europe had ever known&mdash;Perissol&mdash;stood
arm-in-arm
  with his wife in the gardens of his lighthouse hill villa. His face was more
  deeply lined because all the cares of a prosperous nation at times rested
  upon his shoulders, but his mouth had softened and the light in his eyes was
  the light of a lover's happiness.</p>

  <p>"Louise," he exclaimed, "look!"</p>

  <p>They saw the <i>Bird of Paradise</i> heeling over a little on her way out
  to sea. They saw Hamer Wildburn standing up at the wheel and Lucienne by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"The first day of our holiday, my dear. Isn't that a wonderful sight Look
  at them. The happiest couple in the world, I should think, and perhaps I am
  the one man in the world who knows how he deserves it."</p>

  <p>His face became more thoughtful. Louise's arm tightened upon his.</p>

  <p>"What lie did that day&mdash;the decision he came to&mdash;has made not
only France,
  but Europe, what it is," he said almost reverently. "His father would have
  given him twenty millions, the wealth of empires, for the contents of those
  old trousers. He could have become the most famous figure in history. He
  could have had the crazy populace of France at his feet, and all the time he
  could have satisfied what the Anglo-Saxons are too ready to call their sense
  of honour. My dear, it was a miracle. He saw the truth."</p>

  <p>"Please go on, Armand," she begged. "It is almost the first time you have
  ever talked like this."</p>

  <p>"I have felt too much," he admitted. "I have felt that what came of his
  action was too wonderful, that I might wake one morning and find it a house
  of cards and the earth quaking again beneath our feet. What he did will live
  as a great deed, as France will live. Look at everyone. There is Montelimar.
  Nothing would drag him on the Bourse. Nothing would tempt him back into
  politics. He remains, though, one of the greatest philanthropists in France,
  always ready to do his duty to his country&mdash;a true patriot. Look at
Edouard
  Mermillon. He has brought France back again into the front rank of the
  nations. He has made us famous throughout Europe as a country whose policy is
  dignified and stable and whose honour is unsullied. There is not an enemy who
  does not recognise Mermillon as one of the greatest of modern statesmen, and
  he himself&mdash;you do not know it, but I do&mdash;he is a poor man. Every
penny that
  ever came dragged up from that foul pit of corruption has gone back
  again&mdash;and more. He lives on the pension of a Civil Servant, Half his
salary
  even goes towards the past. There is no yacht for Mermillon, none of the
  great luxuries of life, but if there could be a man whose thoughts, whose day
  by day life I might envy&mdash;which there could not be&mdash;it would be his.
  Chauvanne&mdash;well, he went where he was headed for...Lavandou. Ah, he was a
  hero, but nothing will bring him back again, and he was the first who made
  the sacrifice. Look at the men of whom France can boast to-day."</p>

  <p>Her lips stole up to his.</p>

  <p>"And their President," she murmured. "The real inspiration of all that
  happened. If only that beautiful head of his would come down a little oftener
  from the clouds."</p>

  <p>He stooped and kissed her. The <i>Bird of Paradise</i> rounded the point,
  the west wind in her sails, the line of foam behind. The President and his
  wife continued their morning walk along the path thick with pine needles.</p>
