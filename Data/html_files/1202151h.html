  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; NOSTALGO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE flickering firelight fell upon the girl's pretty,
  thoughtful face; her violet eyes looked like deep lakes in it. She stood with
  one small foot tapping the polished brass rail of the fender. Claire Helmsley
  was accounted fortunate by her friends, for she was pretty and rich, and as
  popular as she was good looking.</p>

  <p>The young man by her side, who stood looking moodily into the heart of the
  ship-log fire, was also popular and good looking, but Jack Masefield was
  anything but rich. He had all the brain and all the daring ambition that
  makes for success, but he was poor and struggling yet, and the briefs that he
  dreamed of at the bar had not come.</p>

  <p>But he was not thinking of the bar now as he stood by Claire Helmsley's
  side. They were both in evening dress, and obviously waiting for dinner.
  Jack's arm was around Claire's slender waist, and her head rested on his
  shoulder, so that by looking up she could just see the shadow on his
  clean-cut face. Though the pressure of his arm was strong and tender, he
  seemed as if he had forgotten all about the presence of the girl.</p>

  <p>"Why so silent?" the girl said. "What are you thinking about, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was thinking about you, dearest," Jack replied. "About you and
  myself. Also of your guardian, Anstruther. I was wondering why he asks me so
  often and leaves us so much together when he has not the slightest intention
  of letting me marry you."</p>

  <p>The girl colored slightly. The expression in her violet eyes was one of
  pain.</p>

  <p>"You have never asked my guardian," she said. "We have been engaged now
  for over six months, Jack, and at your request I have kept the thing a dead
  secret. Why should we keep the matter a secret? You are certain to get on in
  your profession, and you would do no worse if the world knew that you had a
  rich wife. My guardian is kindness itself. He has never thwarted me in a
  single wish. He would not be likely to try and cross my life's
  happiness."</p>

  <p>Jack Masefield made no reply for a moment it was, perhaps, a singular
  prejudice on his part, but he did not like the brilliant and volatile Dr.
  Spencer Anstruther. who was Claire's guardian. He would have found it
  impossible to account for this feeling, but there it was.</p>

  <p>"My guardian has plenty of money of his own." Claire said, as if reading
  his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"There you are mistaken." Jack replied. "This is a fine old house. filled
  with beautiful old things. Anstruther goes everywhere; he is a favorite in
  the best society. Men of letters say he is one of the finest talkers in the
  world. But I happen to know that he has very little money, for a lawyer told
  me so. That being so, the &pound;1,00O a year you pay him till you marry or
  come of age is decidedly a thing to take care of. On the whole, dearest, we
  had better go on as we are."</p>

  <p>Claire had a smile for her lover's prejudices. Personally she saw nothing
  amiss with her guardian. She crossed over to the window, the blinds of which
  had not yet been drawn, and looked out. She looked across the old-fashioned
  garden in front of the house to the street beyond, where a few passengers
  straggled along. On the far side of the road stood an electric standard
  holding a flaring lamp aloft. The house opposite was being refaced, to that
  it was masked in a high scaffold.</p>

  <p>As was the custom in London, the scaffolding had been let out to some
  enterprising bill-posting company. It was a mass of gaudy sheets and placards
  puffing a variety of different kinds of wares. In the center, boarded by a
  deep band of black, was one solitary yellow face with dark hair and staring
  eyes. At the base was the single word "Nostalgo."</p>

  <p>An extraordinary vivid and striking piece of work for a poster. The face
  was strong and yet evil, the eyes were full of a devilish malignity, yet
  there was a kind of laugh in them. too. Artists spoke freely of the Nostalgo
  poster as a work of positive genius, yet nobody could name the author of it.
  Nobody knew what it meant, what it foreshadowed. For two months now the thing
  had been one of the sensations of London. The cheap press had built up
  legends round that diabolically clever poster; the head had been dragged into
  a story. The firm who posted Nostalgo professed to know nothing as to its
  inner meaning. It had become a catchword; actors on the variety stage made
  jokes about it. But still that devilish yellow face stared down at London
  with the malignant smile in the starting eyes.</p>

  <p>"Jack, they have put up a fresh Nostalgo poster on the hoarding opposite,"
  Claire said. "I wish they hadn't. That face frightens me. It reminds me of
  somebody."</p>

  <p>"So it does me." Jack replied, with sudden boldness. "It reminds me of
  your guardian."</p>

  <p>Claire smiled at the suggestion. The guardian was a large, florid man,
  well groomed and exquisitely clean. And yet as Jack spoke the yellow face
  opposite seemed to change, and in some way the illusion was complete. It was
  only for an instant, and then the starting eyes and the queer smile that
  London knew so well were back again.</p>

  <p>"You make me shudder," Claire said in a half-frightened way. "I should
  never have thought of that, but as you spoke the face seemed to change. I
  could see my guardian dimly behind it. Jack, am I suddenly growing nervous or
  fanciful? The thing is absurd."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," Jack said stoutly. "The likeness is <i>there</i>. It
may be a
  weird caricature, but I can see it quite plainly. Don't you recall how
  Anstruther breaks out into yellow patches when he is excited or angry? I tell
  you I hate that man. I may be prejudicial, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack paced up and down the room as if lost in thought. The light was
  shining on the face on the hoarding? It seemed to look at him with Spencer
  Anstruther's eyes.</p>

  <p>"There is something wrong in this house," he said. "I fell it. laugh at
  me, you may say that I am talking nonsense, but there it is. The strange
  people who come here?"</p>

  <p>"Sent by the police mainly. Don't forget that my guardian is one of the
  greatest criminologists of our time. There isn't a man in London who can
  trace the motive of a crime quicker than Mr. Anstruther There was that
  marvelous case of the missing children, for instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know." Jack said, with a suggestion of impatience in his voice,
  "And yet, if you don't mind, we will say nothing of our engagement at
  present."</p>

  <p>Claire contested the point no longer. After all she was very happy as
  things stood. She had plenty of chances for seeing her lover, and Mr.
  Anstruther seemed to be altogether too wrapped up in his scientific studies
  to notice what went on under his very eyes. He came into the room at the same
  moment humming a fragment of some popular opera.</p>

  <p>There was nothing whatever about the man to justify Jack Masefield's
  opinions. Spencer Anstruther was calculated to attract attention anywhere.
  The man was commanding face softened by a tolerant and benign expression.
  People looked after him as he walked down the street and wondered which
  popular statesman he was. In society Anstruther was decidedly welcome, amongst
  men of learning he was a familiar figure. His scientific knowledge was
  great, certain publications of his were regarded in the light of text
  books. Altogether he was a man to cultivate.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I am late, young people," he said in a smooth,
  polished voice. "I hope you have been able to amuse yourselves together
  in my absence. You look moody. Jack. Don't those briefs come in as freely
  as you would like? Or have you been quarreling?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," Jack replied. "We never quarrel; we are too good friends for
  that. We have not the excuse in that way that lovers are supposed to
  possess."</p>

  <p>"We have been studying that awful poster," Claire said. "I wish somebody
  would take it away. Jack is always seeing some likeness in it. He says that
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl paused in some confusion. Anstruther smiled as he put up his
  glasses.</p>

  <p>"It is a complex face," he said. "Whose features does it remind you of
  just now, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Yours." Jack said boldly. He flashed the word out suddenly . Half to
  himself he wondered why he always felt a wild desire to quarrel with this
  man. "I hope you won't be offended, sir, but I can see a grotesque likeness
  to you in the famous repellent Nostalgo."</p>

  <p>Claire looked up in some alarm. She was wondering how her guardian would
  take it. The log fire in the grate shot up suddenly and illuminated
  Anstruther's face. Perhaps it was the quick flare that played a trick on
  Claire's fancy, for it seemed to her that suddenly Anstruther's face was
  convulsed with rage. The benign pink expression had gone, the features were
  dark with passion, the fine speaking eyes grew black with malignant hatred.
  Claire could see the hands of the man clenched so hard that the knuckles
  stood out white as chalk. And there with it all was the likeness to Nostalgo
  that Jack had so boldly alluded to. The fire dropped and spurted again, and
  when it rose for the second time the face of Spencer Anstruther was smooth
  and smiling.</p>

  <p>Claire passed her handkerchief across her eyes to concentrate the picture
  of fiendish passion that she had seen. Was it possible that imagination had
  played some trick on her? And yet the picture was as vivid as a landscape
  picked out and fixed upon the retina by a flash of lightning on a dark night.
  The girl turned away and h|d her white face.</p>

  <p>"I should like to meet the artist who drew that face." Anstruther said,
  with a smile. "One thing I am quite certain of&mdash;it is not the work of an
  Englishman. Well, it has found London something to talk about, and the
  advertisement is a very clever one. I dare say before long we shall discover
  that it is exploited in the interest of somebody's soap."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to favor the view that Nostalgo is something novel in the
  way of a thought-reader or a spiritualist," Jack said. "It seems to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The dining-room door was thrown open by a woman-servant, who announced
  that dinner was served. They passed across th e hall into a large dark-walled
  room, the solitary light of which was afforded by a pair of handsome
  candelabra on the table. There were not many flowers, but they were all blood
  red, with a background of shiny, metallic green. The woman who waited passed
  from one plate to another without making the slightest sign. As she came into
  the rays of the shaded candles from time to time Jack glanced at her
  curiously. She was dressed in somber, lusterless black, with no white showing
  at all. There was no cap on her head&mdash;nothing but a tangle of raven-black
  hair. Her brows were black and hairy, her skin as dark, so that her faded
  eyes were in striking contrast to her swarthy appearance. Her hands were very
  strong and capable, the mouth firm to the verge of cruelty. And yet there was
  something subdued, something beaten about the woman, as if she had been taken
  in a wild state and tamed. Anstruther seldom addressed an order to her in
  words&mdash;a motion of the hand, the raising of and eye-lid seemed to be
  sufficient for those pale, tired eyes, which somehow never for one instant
  relaxed their vigilance.</p>

  <p>The woman was a mystery of the house: she seemed to be entirely dominated
  by her master's will. And yet there were strength and passion there. Jack
  felt certain. The fanatic only slumbered. A pansy fell from one of the flower
  vases, and Jack started out his hand to replace it.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see the evil face in the heart of a pansy blossom?" he
  asked, for there was a pause in the conversation.</p>

  <p>"It is a demon face&mdash;and familiar too. Miss Helmsley, whose face
does this
  saffron heart of the pansy remind you of?"</p>

  <p>Claire took the pansy from Jack's hand and studied it with a frown on her
  pretty face.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," she cried. "I see what you mean. It is Nostalgo, the man
  with the yellow face."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE CHOPIN NOCTURNE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CLAIRE gave the desired assurance, and rose from the table.
  She would have Jack's coffee saved for him in the drawing-room, she said.
  Anstruther lit a cigarette, and began to talk of crime. Crime and criminals
  had a fine fascination for him. Scotland Yard offered valuable inspiration
  for his new book on the criminal instinct, and in return he had been in a
  position to give the officials yonder one or two useful hints. The case he
  had on hand just now was a most fascinating one, but, of course, his lips
  were sealed for the present. Jack forgot his dislike in the fascination of
  the present.</p>

  <p>"8tay here and finish your cigar," Anstruther said as he rose and pitched
  his cigarette into the fire. I'll go into my study and work this thing out
  with the aid of my violin. I may be on hour or so, or I may be longer. If I
  have finished before 11 o'clock I'll come up with my fiddle, and we'll get
  Claire to play. If you require any more claret you can ring the bell."</p>

  <p>Jack sat there for a time smoking and thinking matters over. Presently,
  from the study beyond came the sound of music. Really, Anstruther was a
  wonderful man&mdash;he seemed able to do anything. He was not perhaps a great
  performer on the violin&mdash;his playing was a little too mechanical and
  seemed to lack soul&mdash;but the execution was brilliant enough.</p>

  <p>Jack opened his cigarette case only to find that it was empty. There was a
  fresh supply in the pocket of his overcoat. which was hanging in the hall. He
  would be just in time for one more, and then he would join Claire in the
  drawing-room. The hall light had been turned low, so that, as Jack stood in
  the vestibule fumbling in his coat pocket he was not visible, though he could
  see what was going on in the hall behind him.</p>

  <p>There was a spot of light at the head of staircase. Somebody was standing
  looking down into the hall&mdash;somebody in a rough jacket buttoned at the
  throat and wearing a pair of rubber-soled shoes, for the intruder made not
  the slightest noise. Jack wondered in some impudent burglar was raiding the
  house at this hour. If so, he would get a warm reception presently. Jack
  stood there as the figure came down the stairs and turned along the
  corridor to the left of the drawing-room. But there was no challenge and no
fight,
  for the simple reason that in the hall light, as the stranger passed, Jack
  recognised the face of Spencer Anstruther. There was no doubt about it; there
  was no possibility of a mistake here.</p>

  <p>Inside the study the music once more began. Very gently Jack tried to
turn the
  knob of the door, but it was locked. Under ordinary circumstances this would
  have excited no suspicion; perhaps there was another way into the room by way
  of the corridor. But, if so that did not explain why Anstruther was creeping
  about his own house in the semblance of a burglar, and wearing rubber-soled
  shoes.</p>

  <p>There was something creepy about the whole business. Jack returned to the
  vestibule again, and from there he passed into the garden. The study was at
  the side of the house, and a belt of shrubs outside afforded a pretty good
  cover. There was the study window with the blinds down and a strong light
  inside. Jack noted that it was a French window, a window frequently used,
  because the stone step outside had been worn by the pressing of many
  feet.</p>

  <p>The smooth melody of Chopin was playing on inside. Jack stooped down to
  where he could see the lace flowers on the blind, and looked into the room.
  There was a little slit in the blind where the sun had worn it, and by this
  slit the whole of the room could be seen. The music had softened down to a
  <i>piano</i> passage taken very slowly. But Jack was not thinking of the
  music now at all, though the strains were soothing and flowing enough.</p>

  <p>He rubbed his eyes to make sure that they did not deceive him. No, the
  room was plain enough, so was the sound of the music. And with it all <i>the
  room was absolutely empty!</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF THE STRINGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the most extraordinary thing in the world. Beyond
  question the room was absolutely empty. Jack could see to the far side: he
  noted the pictures and the flowers and the vases on the mantlepiece. His view
  was naturally narrowed by a small spy-hole, but there was no portion of the
  room hidden from him, though he could not quite see the whole of it at one
  time.</p>

  <p>The music was proceeding quite smoothly, though with pauses now and again.
  It was followed now and then by what sounded like subdued applause.</p>

  <p>Jack stepped back from the window. He wanted to make certain that he had
  not mistaken the room. No, the sound of music came from the study right
  enough. At the risk of being discovered he crept back into the house again
  and tried the study door. It was locked, and what was more, the key was in
  the lock, as the application of an eye testified.</p>

  <p>And the music was proceeding quite swiftly again. The mystery was
  absolutely maddening. Jack wondered if there was some cabinet in the study
  hidden from view where the player had taken up his stand. A t any rate
  somebody was playing Chopin's music&mdash;playing it very well. There was no
  magic about the thing.</p>

  <p>The hall of the house was very quiet, nobody seemed to be about.
  Occasionally there came the sound of mirth from the servants' hall, but
  nothing more. Fully determined to get at the bottom of this mystery, Jack
  returned to the garden again. Once more his eye was glued to the slit in the
  blind. He could make nobody out in the room . There was little fear of his
  being detected, because a belt of shrubs hid the window from the road.</p>

  <p>Without the slightest warning a figure, appeared in the room. It was
  impossible to see where she came from, but of necessity she must have entered
  by the door. Jack was a little uncertain on that head, for his glance was not
  directed towards the door for the moment.</p>

  <p>He saw the figure of a woman, young and exceedingly well dressed. She was
  wearing an evening gown of white satin that showed up the creamy pallour of
  her skin, for her neck and shoulders were bare. The neck was rather thin,
  Jack noted, and the shoulders more inclined to muscle than beauty. For a
  young girl it struck Jack that the upper part of her body looked old. But the
  face was dark and wholesome, and against the deep eyes and swarthy complexion
  the girl's hair was dazzling. It was beautiful, rippling hair, changing color
  as the light flashed upon it.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is a bit of an adventure," the watcher told himself. "But
  where's the person in the room who let the young lady in? Somebody must have
  let her in, because the door was locked and the key on the inside. I saw it
  there, so I can swear to that fact. But who is she?"</p>

  <p>There were many answers to the problem, for Spencer Anstruther was a man
  who had countless strange visitors. His vast knowledge of crime and the
  ramifications of human depravity brought him in contact with large numbers of
  people. Men and women in distress often came to him, and they came in
  increasing numbers since Anstruther had got the better of a gang of
  scoundrels in a recent famous blackmailing case. Sometimes these people came
  on their own initiative, sometimes they were sent by the police. But
  Anstruther never said anything about them. He looked upon himself as a
  confidential agent. Claire could have told of many curious visitors at all
  hours, though Anstruther never so much as alluded to them afterwards.</p>

  <p>But this girl did not look in the least like anybody in trouble. Her dark
  features were almost expressionless; there was no display of violent emotions
  there. Her gaze slowly wandered around the room as if looking for something;
  She had much the aspect of a pupil whose attention is called to a blackboard
  by a master. Jack watched; it seemed to him that he had seen this girl
  before. He could not recollect anybody in the least like her; that contrast
  of dark skin and fair hair was striking enough to impress itself upon the
  most careless mind, and yet Jack could not give the face a name. He could not
  permit himself mistake. He knew perfectly well that the expressionless
  features were quite familiar to him.</p>

  <p>The girl stood for some little time, as if waiting for her lesson. Jack's
  eyes were glued so closely upon her that he did not notice the coming of
  another person&mdash;a man this time. He was a young man, with sleek, well-
brushed
  brown hair, and dark, well-groomed moustached turned up after the fashion
  affected by the German Emperor. The man was perfectly well-appointed, his
  evening dress and white waistcoat were faultless. His face was strong, but
  it did not convey anything intellectual. There were scores of such men to be
  seen any day in the London season, all groomed the same and apparently
  finished in the same machine.</p>

  <p>The man bowed and smiled at the girl, and she bowed and smiled in return.
  It was rather a graceful bow; it seemed to Jack that she looked at her
  companion to see if it were quite correct. Then the two proceeded to talk
  in dumb show, partly by signs and partly by fingers.</p>

  <p>The mystery was getting deeper&mdash; one of these two was a deaf
  mute, perhaps both of them. Was this one of Anstruther's cases, or did it
  possess a far different significance?</p>

  <p>The solution was beyond Jack Masefield. He might have been on the track
  of a mystery, and on the other hand he might merely be doing a little vulgar
  eavesdropping. If it was the latter, and Anstruther found him out, he
  need not hope to visit Claire at home any more. Anstruther was
  most particular in these things, as Jack knew; but he set his teeth
  together and decided to take the risk. He felt pretty sure that there was
  something here that touched the household deeply.</p>

  <p>He turned just for the moment with an idea that somebody was behind
  him. But the strip of lawn was quite clear. Jack could see through the
  belt of trees to the street again beyond, with its light, flaring on the
  yellow face of mysterious Nostalgo and his half-laughing eyes. That weird
  face seemed to form a fitting background to the room mystery.</p>

  <p>But Jack had his eyes to the slit in the blind again. Inside the pantomime
  show was still going on. The girl to be getting a lesson of some kind, and
  her tutor appeared to be pleased, for he smiled and clapped his hands from
  time to time. Then he took out his watch and consulted it with a frown. As
  he glanced up the girl crossed the room to the mantlepiece and opened the
  face of the clock. With a quick movement she put it back half-an-hour.</p>

  <p>The man in the faultless evening dress nodded approval. There was a
  little pause before he approached the window and stood so that his shadow was
  picked out clean against the strong light of the room. Then he rapidly
  signaled with his arm. One arm went up, there was a noise of
  rings and a flutter
  of drapery, and then a heavy curtain was jerked over the window, and Jack
  could see no more. Try as he would, no ray of light could he make out. It
  was as if the lights had been switched off, leaving the room in utter
  darkness.</p>

  <p>What on earth did it all mean? Without a doubt the young man in evening
  dress had signalled to somebody outside as he stood close against the window
  and raised his arm. Jack congratulated himself on the fact that the slit in
  the blind was low down, so that he had not to stand against the
  light. He slipped into the belt of shrubs and watched for movement, but no
further
  sign came.</p>

  <p>What were those people inside going to do? The solution flashed upon
  Jack instantly. They had not come there so perfectly dressed for
  the mere sake of
  seeing Spencer Anstruther. They had not been spending the evening anywhere,
  dining and that kind of thing beforehand, for they were too spruce and
  fresh for that. The woman's toilette in particular had evidently been just
  donned, as if fresh from the hands of her maid. And she had put the clock
  back half-an-hour.</p>

  <p>"They are going somewhere in half-an-hour." Jack decided. "Hang me if I
  don't follow them. By the right time it was half-past ten. Anstruther said he
  should not come up if he failed to get his business finished before eleven, at
  which time he will expect me to go. I'll go to the drawing-room and talk to
  Claire for a little time just to avert suspicion."</p>

  <p>He crept back into the house without being seen, he finished his claret
  and dropped the stump of his cigarette onto his dessert plate. As he made his
  way up the stairs the music began again. The music was not the least
  maddening part of the mystery.</p>

  <p>"What a time you have been," Claire said as she tossed her book aside. All
  by yourself down there! Really, Jack, you modern young men are so
  cold-blooded that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not as far as you are concerned, dearest," Jack said a she kissed
  her. "I had something to do; I was working out a case that puzzled me."</p>

  <p>"A case in some way connected with the law, I suppose?" Claire asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Jack replied. He quite believed that the case was
  connected with the law. "I begin to see my way to its solution. I suppose
  there is not the slightest chance of your guardian coming up
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>Claire replied that it did not look like it. Evidently the solution of the
  music problem was not an easy one, for the violin was going again as if
  it had just begun.</p>

  <p>"It makes me feel creepy," Claire exclaimed. "Fancy the idea of tracking a
  criminal by means of divine melodies like that. Jack, don't you notice
  something strange about it?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that I do," Jack replied. "Why, the whole
thing&mdash;really. I
  beg your pardon, darling. I-I was thinking about something else. It was the
  case I referred to just now."</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, you are very strange in your manner to-night." Claire said.
  She looked pal and distracted. Trust the eyes of love to see anything like
  that. "You haven't bad news for me, Jack?"</p>

  <p>Masefield forced a smile to his lips. It was hard work to maintain his
  ordinary manner in the face of the strange scene that he had witnessed that
  night.</p>

  <p>"I have certainly heard no news since dinner time." he said. "What did you
  expect me to say?"</p>

  <p>"I thought that perhaps you had mentioned me to my guardian; that you had
  changed your mind, and told him that you and I were going to be married some
  time."</p>

  <p>"No, your name was never mentioned, dearest. Anstruther was full of his
  case and gave me no opportunity. He went off directly he had finished his
  tobacco. As a matter of fact, Claire. I am more resolved than ever to say
  nothing about our engagement to Mr. Anstruther."</p>

  <p>"It is very strange that you mistrust him like that, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is, little woman. Call it instinct, if you like. I know that
  women are supposed to hold the monopoly of that illogical faculty. They
  dislike a man or a woman without being able to say why, and in the course of
  time that man or woman turns out to be a villain. There is no denying the
  fact that I feel the same way towards your guardian. I am convinced
  that as soon as he knows the truth you will be in danger. I said before that
he is a
  poor man, and the enjoyment of your &pound;2,000 during the time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jack, you are perfectly horrid." Claire murmured. "If I were a
  nervous girl you would frighten me. As it is, I feel certain that you are
  utterly wrong. My guardian is one of the most delightful of men. If he were
  not, plenty of clever people would have found it out. And, besides. why do so
  many unfortunate people come to him to advise them. Which he does with great
  trouble to himself and no hope of reward!"</p>

  <p>Jack admitted that perhaps he was wrong. And he had no desire either to
  frighten Claire. He had not the slightest intention of telling her what he
  had discovered that night.</p>

  <p>"Let us be less personal," he said. "What was the strange thing that you
  noticed about your guardian's playing?"</p>

  <p>"That it is so much better than usual," Claire said. "There seemed more
  passion and feeling in the music. My guardian is a brilliant violin player,
  but I have not hitherto noticed much feeling in his style. Now, listen to the
  thing that he is playing at present."</p>

  <p>"Chopin's Fantasie in F." Jack muttered. "I know it very well indeed. It
  is a favorite of mine."</p>

  <p>There was certainly plenty of expression and feeling in the music. Jack
  was bound to admit that. The fantasie came to an end with a crash of two
  chords, and Claire clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful!" she cried. "I must really compliment my guardian on the
  improvement in his style. You are not going already, Jack? It's not quite
  eleven yet."</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry, dear, but I have that case to look into to-night." Jack
  said, with perfect truth. He saw that the hands of the big clock on the
  mantlepiece were creeping on to the hour. "Anstruther won't come up to-night;
  he said he should be here by eleven if he were. And he gave me a hint not to
  stay later. I shall see you at the Warings' to-morrow night Good night,
  darling."</p>

  <p>Claire put up her red lips to be kissed. She would have seen Jack to the
  door, but he pointed out that the night was chilly and Claire's dress thin.
  Neither would he have the butler summoned. His coat and hat were in the ball,
  and he would get them himself. A moment or two later and he was standing in
  the garden behind the strip of shrubs. He was quite free to act now; he had
  nobody in the way. As he stood there a distant church clock boomed the hour
  of eleven.</p>

  <p>"Now we shall see what we shall see," Jack muttered. "I'm going to find
  whether there is a mystery of the house or whether these people are merely
  Anstruther's clients. Oh!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke the dark curtain over the study window was pulled back, and
  the figure of the young man in the evening dress was clean-cut against the
  light. Then a black arm pulled for the catch of the window, and the young
  man, pushing the blind aside, came out. He was wearing an overcoat now, and a
  tall hat. He seemed to be waiting for somebody.</p>

  <p>Then the figure of the dark-faced, fair-haired girl came out. She was
  cloaked from head to foot in a blue wrap trimmed with feathers; her fair hair
  was not covered. No word was spoken, but Jack could see that they were
  conversing still by signs.</p>

  <p>The watcher wondered if he had time to get inside the room. But that
  little Idea was dismissed at the outset, for the young man pushed the window
  to carefully and the latch clicked. It was quite evident that the long sash
  closed with a spring lock, which was a most unusual thing for French windows
  to do. As the strange pair went down the side path Jack stepped into the
  open. He wanted to assure himself as to the window being fastened. He pulled
  at it hard, but it did not yield. At the same moment from the window of the
  room came a strange, brilliant crash of music. Yet that room was absolutely
  empty, as Jack would have been prepared to swear in any court of England.</p>

  <p>"I'll wake up either from a dream or in a lunatic asylum presently," he
  muttered. "And now for those other people. Good thing they had no idea of
  being followed."</p>

  <p>Jack was in the road now, and made his way through the quiet
  nest of streets between Bloomsbury and Regent's Park. He could see his quarry
  a hundred yards or so before him: there was nobody else and there was not the
  slightest chance of those in front being lost. A horse clicked on the wood
  pavement as a well-appointed hansom passed the tracker. Then he saw the
  hansom pull up to the curb and the deaf mutes in front get in as if the whole
  thing had been arrange and drive off.</p>

  <p>The thing was so sudden an unexpected that Jack was nonplussed for a
  moment. There was no chance of following these people, for there was
  probably not another hansom within half-a-mile of the spot. Jack stood
  hesitating in the silence of the road; he could hear the steady click-clack
  of the horse's hoofs as the rubber-tired hansom hurried on, and then
  suddenly the horse's hoofs stopped. They had not died out in the
  distance; they had merely stopped.</p>

  <p>Jack hurried forward: he had not given up all hope yet. He might overtake
  the hansom and by good luck meet another one going toward the Strand. As he
  turned a corner he saw to his surprise the figure of the young man in evening
  dress come silently toward him on the other side of the road. Then the
  stranger crossed the road and turned down the far side of the square as
  if he were going to complete the circuit and return to the cab again. As the
  man vanished, Jack heard a thudding sound, followed by a sound like the
  tearing of stiff calico and the rattle of peas on a drum. There was a stifled
  cry, and then silence. On the impulse of the moment. Jack turned and
  followed.</p>

  <p>At the angle stood a row of houses, some of them being repaired. Jack
  heard somebody speak to somebody else some way down the road. He looked
  across at the opposite houses to see that that they were in scaffolding and
  that they were plastered with bills. A little way above the ground in front
  of the center house being repaired was one of the repulsive, clever Nostalgo
posters
  with the yellow face looking out.</p>

  <p>But there was something else. For there at full length on the pavement
  lay the body of a man with his face up to the stars. With a little
  cry Jack crossed the road. Almost instantly a policeman stood by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"Drunk," he said. "A gentleman who has just gone down the road told me a
  man was lying drunk on the pavement. May word, sir, but he's got the
  complaint pretty bad."</p>

  <p>"He has," Jack said, with a catch in his voice. "The man isn't drunk. He's
  dead. He's been murdered. Shot through the head and breast. Show your lantern
  here, officer."</p>

  <p>The officer flashed the strong, searching rays on
  the face of the dead man. As
  he did so he gave a cry, and pointed at the hoarding behind him with a finger
  that shook a little.</p>

  <p>"Dead, sir, and murdered without a doubt," he said. "But that's not
  strangest part of it. Look at his face and the expression of his eyes;
  look at the yellow face and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good heaven!" Jack cried. "The yellow face, the face of the diabolical
  poster behind you. As I am a living man, we have found Nostalgo in the
  flesh!"</p>

  <p>The dead man grinned up, the face grinned down. And the face of the man
  and the face in the print were exactly the same!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE SPEAKING LIKENESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MASEFIELD looked at the figure on the pavement in a dazed
  kind of way. Beyond all question there lay the embodiment of the famous
  Nostalgo poster. London had been discussing the mystery of the poster for
  weeks already. The amazing hideous cleverness of it had struck the popular,
  imagination, the artistic side of it had appealed to those of culture. Nobody
  had the least idea what it was intended to convey. Every dally paper
  promising a correct solution on a certain day would have added tremendously
  to its circulation.</p>

  <p>Then there had been those who had declared that the poster was a portrait;
  they had held that no artist could imagine a face quite like that. And here
  was dread confirmation of the theory. Absolutely the poster and the dead man
  were identical. The same long, thin nose, the same startling eyes, the same
  suggestion of diabolical cunning in the smile.</p>

  <p>In the poster Nostalgo wore a turn-down collar and a loosely-knotted red
  tie. It was the same with the dead man on the pavement. As to the rest, his
  dress was conventional enough&mdash;a frock coat and gray trousers, a tall
silk hat
  which had rolled into the road.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that you had better search his pockets?" Jack suggested.
  The constable replied that it was not a bad idea. But a close examination
  produced no definite result. There were no papers on the body, nothing beyond
  a handful of money&mdash;gold and silver and, coppers all mixed-up together
in the
  trousers pocket. There was not even a watch.</p>

  <p>"This game's beyond me," the officer, muttered, as he blew his whistle.
  "We must get this poor chap conveyed to the police station. Foreigner, ain't
  he?"</p>

  <p>But Jack could not say. The sweeping, coarse black hair pushed back from
  the bulging forehead, and the yellow, guinea-colored face suggested the
  Orient. But the lips were thin like the nose, and these might have belonged
  to some Spanish hidalgo. It was impossible to decide.</p>

  <p>"You were close by," the policeman said. "Didn't you see anything,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever." said Jack. "I was just passing along on the side of
  the square at right angles with this spot. I certainly saw a young man come
  along. but I didn't notice him much. I expect he was the young man who told
  you that a 'drunk' awaited you here."</p>

  <p>"I expect he was, sir; young man with his moustache turned up like the
  German Emperor's."</p>

  <p>Jack started, but said nothing. It was not for him to say anything of the
  strange sight that he had seen in Spencer Anstruther's study. The young man
  in question had left his hansom; probably he had come back for something
  forgotten: therefore, on the whole. Jack felt that he could not in any way
  connect him with this mystery.</p>

  <p>And yet Spencer Anstruther's young friend must have been close by at the
  very moment the murder was committed. It seemed impossible to believe that he
  had not heard that choking cry. and that strange noise like the tearing of
  calico or the scatter of peas on a tray. But, on the other hand, the murdered
  man had been shot, and shooting implies noise. Certainly Jack, had heard
  nothing that in any way would be connected with the firing of a revolver.</p>

  <p>And yet there was that tearing sound, and the strange fact that the
  Nostalgo of the poster had tears in him in exactly the same place as the real
  man who had been wounded. There was a plot calculated to puzzle Spencer
  Anstruther himself, and Jack said so aloud.</p>

  <p>"I don't think as even he'd guess this," the policeman said. "Friend of
  yours by any chance, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I had not left the house five minutes before I found that body." Jack
  raid. "If you like. I will go back and bring Mr. Spencer Anstruther
  here."</p>

  <p>Here was a chance to get at the other business, the mystery of the strange
  music. It was a legitimate errand enough, but the policeman shook his head.
  He did not want to take anything so important upon his own shoulders, his
  inspector being "down on that kind of thing."</p>

  <p>Two constables with the ambulance came at length. They asked no questions,
  but hoisted the body up and turned immediately in the direction of Shannon
  Street police station.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better come along, sir," the first policeman suggested to
  Jack. "It's just possible that the inspector may want to ask you a few
  questions."</p>

  <p>Masefield followed. He smiled just a little as he noted the speaker's
  tone. If not exactly in custody, he was at least expected to give a good
  account of himself. To his great relief he found the inspector not in the
  least disposed to assume the official manner; on the contrary, he seemed
  rather a timid man, though his eyes were steady enough.</p>

  <p>"I have told you everything, sir," Jack said at length. "I only wish it
  might have been more. If there is any further way in which I can be of
  assistance to you?"</p>

  <p>"You are very good, sir," the inspector said. "What we have to do now is
  to push the matter forward before the scent gets cold. It is very imperative
  that we discover who this man is. The first person to apply to is the firm of
  advertising contractors who posted those bills. Did anybody happen to notice
  the firm whose hoarding the deceased man was found against?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact I did," Jack said, as the officer shook his head.
  "Not that it is a sure find for you, Mr. Inspector. seeing that those bills
  appeared on the hoardings of all the bill-posting firms in London. Still they
  may have emanated in the first place from one firm, and perhaps that firm was
  Freshcombe &amp; Co."</p>

  <p>"That being the name on the top of the hoarding we are speaking of?" the
  inspector asked. "You have a keen eye for detail, sir; it was very smart of
  you to notice that."</p>

  <p>"Not at all; it was almost an accident. The mere fact of finding the
  prototype of the famous Nostalgo poster was sufficiently startling to brace
  all one's faculties. In glancing at the hoarding I saw the name of Freshcombe
  &amp; Co. on the top. The name was impressed upon my memory by the fact that
  quite recently I appeared for Freshcombe &amp; Co. in an action they brought
  against a rival firm for damages. That is why I have the name so exact."</p>

  <p>The inspector smiled with the air of a man who is well pleased with
  himself. In that case Mr. Masefield practically knew the head of the firm of
  Freshcombe &amp; Co;, and where he lived. In that event the inspector
  proposed to go direct to the gentleman in question and ask for a few
  particulars.</p>

  <p>"There I can help you again." Jack said "I had several interviews with Mr.
  Freshcombe through his solicitor, an one of them took place in Mr.
  Freshcombe's own house in Regent's Park Crescent."</p>

  <p>The inspector waited to hear no more. One of his men would call a cab, and
  perhaps Mr. Masefield would be good enough to go as far as Regent's Park
  Crescent and smooth the way. It was getting late now, but Jack had no
  objection. He was keenly interested in this mystery, and he must get to the
  bottom of it if he could. He had a few questions to ask as the cab rolled
  away, but none of them struck the inspector as being to the point. But Jack
  knew better.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Mr. Freshcombe had not gone to bed, though the house was in
  darkness. The stout little prosperous-looking man of business started as he
  caught sight of the inspector's uniform. Something in connection with
  burglary rose uppermost in his mind as he asked his visitors' business.</p>

  <p>"I hope there's nothing wrong," he stammered. "Ah, how do you do, Mr.
  Masefield? Will you gentlemen be so good as to step inside. There is a fire
  in the dining-room. Anything in the way of a cigar, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the inspector came to business at once. It was plain that his story
  interested the listener, for he followed it with eyes of rounded
  astonishment. He punctuate the story with surprised grunts.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul!" he exclaimed. "Whoever would have thought it? I never
  expected that there was anything about that famous poster. I had two thousand
  of them through my hands in the way of business, and they struck me clever,
  very clever indeed. Personally, I regarded them as theatrical bills."</p>

  <p>Then you can't tell us anything about them?" the inspector asked with an
  air of chagrin.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," Freshcombe replied "Nothing whatever." Freshcombe
  piled promptly. "As I said before, posters came to us in the ordinary way of
  business. There <i>was</i> an air of secrecy about the whole thing."</p>

  <p>"Which did not attract your attention? Did not speak to your suspicions, I
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it. The advertiser wanted to create an air of mystery and
  sensation. How well that has been managed I leave you to guess. Being,
  moreover, exceedingly shrewd, the advertiser not mean his name to leak out. I
  received a note one day asking my terms for displaying a thousand of those
  posters on all the hoardings in London, and my people sent in a
  quotation."</p>

  <p>"That letter came from another business house. I presume, sir?" the
  inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"No. It didn't. It was from a certain Mr. John Smith, and was written from
  the Hotel Royale, and on the official paper of the hotel. Three days later
  the posters arrived per a firm of carriers, and the same afternoon a check
  drawn by John Smith on the City and Provincial Bank. We cashed the check and
  posted the bills. I may say that, in the usual course of business, I should
  not have known this; but I was a little struck by the posters and their
  mystery, so I made inquiries. I assure you that I have no time to go into
  those minor details a rule."</p>

  <p>"I am rather disappointed," the inspector said. "I hardly expected this.
  The mystery of the posters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was part of the cleverness of the scheme," Freshcombe interrupted. "As
  rule, these things leak out and spoil the game. Why, half a dozen
  newspapermen have been asking questions in my office."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't even know who printed the posters?" Jack asked. "Have you
  any more left?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy the posters were French," Freshcombe said. "They had evidently
  been repacked before they came to us. No, we have none left; they were all
posted
  last week. I haven't even one as a specimen."</p>

  <p>Mr. Freshcombe would have pushed his hospitality, but the others declined.
  The inspector was not going to give up a chase like this. Could Mr.
  Freshcombe find a London Directory, or in any way help him to ascertain the
  name and address of the manager of the city branch of the City and Provincial
  Bank? Mr. Freshcombe could supply both details. The bank manager in question
  was a large shareholder in the firm and enjoyed an important position. As to
  his residence, it was in Piccadilly, over the bank's branch there. Mr.
  Carrington was a man of fashion, so that, if he were at home it was unlikely
  that he had gone to bed. A moment later and the cab was proceeding toward
  Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Carrington was not only at home but he was entertaining friends. There
  were lights in all the windows of a handsome suite of rooms over the bank,
  and a chatter of voices assailed the ears of the callers as soon as the
  mahogany door was opened. Mr. Carrington was giving an evening party, the
  footman explained, and he did not like to be disturbed. But the sight of the
  inspector's uniform was not without its effect, and the intruders were
  ushered into a large room at the top of the stairs. The door was not quite
  closed, so that the strangers could see down a handsome corridor into a fine
  drawing room beyond. Jack could recognise some of the guests, whereby he knew
  that Mr. Carrington kept very good company.</p>

  <p>"I feel like an intruder," Jack said, as he stood looking out of the room.
  In his evening dress he might have passed for a guest himself. "If Mr.
  Carrington is in a position&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack paused suddenly. He was face to face with the third great surprise
  that night. For there in the corridor, and coming towards him now, was the
  fair-haired, dark-skinned girl whom he had seen with the young-man in Spencer
  Anstruther's study. There was no mistake here, no illusion. The girl walked
  along with her head down, making a sign from time to time to the man by her
  side. He was a perfect stranger to Jack, who dismissed him from the situation
  altogether as a mere vacuous man about town. If the woman was here, the young
  man with the Imperial moustache was not far off, Jack thought.</p>

  <p>"I think that you were going to say something, sir," the inspector
  ventured. But Jack had quite recovered himself by this time. He made some
  commonplace remark, and then Mr. Carrington came into the room. He was
  polite, but not at all anxious for his visitors to remain. Would they be so
  good as to come to the point.</p>

  <p>The inspector told his story with considerable brevity. Mr. Carrington was
  pleased to be interested. It was a strange and startling romance as it stood,
  but the bank manager did not see his way to afford any solution of this
  mystery.</p>

  <p>"I haven't quite finished, sir," the inspector said quietly. "That
  bill-posting was paid by a check drawn on your City branch, of which you are
  manager, by one John Smith. Now, this John Smith&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which John Smith?" Mr. Carrington asked, with a smile. "My good sir, do
  you know that we have some two thousand five hundred accounts at our City
  branch? Probably the name of John Smith is the commonest in the world.
  Without making any definite statement, I should say that we have over two
  hundred accounts in the name of Smith and probably a third of them John
  Smith. I can quite understand your anxiety to get on the track of the right
  man without delay, but that could not possibly be done to-night. I could not
  even get at the ledgers without two of the cashiers being present But I will
  make it a point to be at the bank at ten o'clock to-morrow morning and meet
  you there. It is impossible to do any more to-night."</p>

  <p>The inspector nodded his head somewhat sadly. He quite saw the force of
  what Mr. Carrington was saying. He could do no more than make an appointment
  for the following day. He wished Carrington good night and turned to go,
  followed by Masefield. In the corridor somebody called Jack by name. He
  turned to see a colleague of the Junior Bar standing before him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" the latter said, "where did you turn up from? I had an idea that
  you were a friend of Carrington's. Get your coat off and join us in a game of
  bridge."</p>

  <p>The situation was just a little embarrassing, but Mr. Carrington came to
  the rescue. Masefield was dressed for the part, so to speak, and would he not
  remain? There would be dancing presently and&mdash;</p>

  <p>But Jack decided promptly. He whispered the inspector to precede him and
  wait for him in the cab. Carrington passed on as Jack stood just a moment
  chatting with his old friend and school-fellow.</p>

  <p>"I came here to-night on rather important business," he said. "There is no
  occasion to go into that now. But I want you to do something for me, my dear
  fellow. In hunting up one mystery I feel pretty sure that I have come on the
  track of another. There is a deaf and dumb girl here&mdash;there she is, with
  that Johnny chap in the resplendent white waistcoat. I want you to find out
  who she is and where she comes from."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Richard Rigby
  responded. "Nice looking girl, fair hair and dark eyes.
  Sort of a theatrical get-up, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Well, now you mention it, perhaps it is rather in that way. But
  that isn't all, Dick; unless I am greatly mistaken that girl came here with a
  fair chap whose moustache is turned up after the fashion of the German
  Emperor. Find out about him, too, and I'll look you up at your chambers the
  first thing in the morning. I must not keep my friend waiting.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>Jack passed along the corridor in the direction of the staircase.
  There were many palms and ferns there, with screens behind which
  people could sit an not be seen except by their partners.
  Jack paused with with his foot on the thick pile of the carpet,
  for just in front of him was the girl with the Southern face and
  fair-hair. Her head was still bent low, her fingers were working.
  What her companion was like Jack could not quite make out,
  for the his back was turned.
  The girl looked at him with a flash of anger in her eyes, her
  lips moved, and sound certainly
  came from them. Jack could just catch the words:</p>

  <p>"Don't drive me too far," she said. "Take care and not drive too far
  because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl suddenly lapsed into silence again and her fingers began to
  work.
  The couple passed behind a screen of palms and ferns, and Jack could
  see them no more.</p>

  <p>"Well, this has been a night and a half," he said. "Where
  is it going to end. I wonder if my
  friend the inspector will be disposed to accept my suggestion."</p>

  <p>The inspector gave Jack's suggestion the most careful attention.
  He had not thought of it before.</p>

  <p>"We'll go back to the scene of the murder," Jack said. "There is a strong
  electric light in front of the hoarding, and the
  Nostalgo poster is only a few feet from the
  ground. Moreover, it has only recently been put up, and it is quite clean and
  fair. Depend upon it, there is some trade mark upon the bill,
  even if it is only a cipher. Of
  course, you see the importance of finding out who posted the bill."</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir. How do you propose to get at the facts?"</p>

  <p>"By examining the bill with the aid of a strong magnifying glass. I have
  no doubt that, being a detective, you have such a thing in your pocket at
  the present moment? Good. Then all you have to do is to order the cab
  to drive to the corner of Panton street and stop there."</p>

  <p>The cab arrived at length and the occu]pants dismounted. They did not
  take the cab quite as far as the scene of the murder for obvious reasons,
  walked on there alone. It was quite still now, and nobody was about save
  a passing policeman, who had orders give notice if anybody was coming. It
was just as well that the curiosity of passers-by should not be aroused.</p>

  <p>"Now for it." Jack said, breathing a little faster in his excitement.
  "Perhaps we
  had better have the assistance of your lantern as well. I thought
  that the poster was there. It was
  there. I'll swear that is the very spot, just where the picture
  of the pretty girl taking the pill is. Good
  heavens, man, the poster has <i>gone</i>!
  It has been covered up since we were here before before by that mustard
  advertisement. At the hour after midnight the thing has been done.
  But the right thing must be underneath.
  See! The poster is wet!"</p>

  <p>Jack advanced to tear the poster down, but the inspector pulled
  him roughly aside.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch it!" he said hoarsely. "Whatever you do, don't touch it!
  <i>Wait!</i>"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; A VANISHED CLUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK MASEFIELD paused for Inspector Bates to
  say more. Possibly, the officer was possessed of some
  brilliant idea, after the
  first glance at his face it was easy to see that he was as nonplussed as Jack
  himself. It was only professional caution that spoke; there was
  no illumination at   the back of the policeman's brain.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped that perhaps you had discerned something," Masefield said.</p>

  <p>"Not
  quite that, sir," Bates admitted. "So far I am as much in the dark as
  you are yourself, but my experience is that nothing is to be gained by
  haste. What I mean is that a thoughless movement often destroys a clue of
  the umost value. I should like to stand here for a moment and consider my
  position."</p>

  <p>Jack drily remarked that there could be no objection to the course
  proposed by Inspector Bates. It was very late now;  there was nothing to
  be seen, so that the
  train of thought of the inspector was not likely to be interrupted.
  He stood facing
  great boarded hoarding with its wealth of gaudy pictorial advertisements, but
  his face did not lighten,  and the moody frown was still on his brow.</p>

  <p>"Blessed if I can make anything of it," he said in vexed tones. "Here's
  a man found dead under the most amazing circumstances. There seems to be no
  motive for the crime; nothing has been removed from the body so far as we
  know; the man evidently died where he fell. That he was killed I dare
  say the medical examination will show."</p>

  <p>"So far the crime is commonplace and vulgar enough," Jack Masefield
  suggested. "Scores of these things happen in London every year.
  Some are
  found out, but some remain mysteries until the end of time; but this
  particular crime seems to be peculiarly terrible. First of all,
  London for some time has been doubly attentive to the yellow posters.
  No greater advertising circular has ever appealed to the public.
  Nostalgo is a personality about as great as
  some of our leading actors. Still, nobody has really regarded
  Nostalgo as  living
  force, and I find him dead on the pavement here right in front of one
  of his own
  posters. Is that coincidence, or an amazing happening?"</p>

  <p>"Both, I should say," Bates replied. "An amazing happening in
  any case. But to find the man dead in front of one of his posters my be
  no more than a coincidence. You see, there are so many Nostalgo posters
  about."</p>

 <p>But Jack was loth to give up his point.</p>

 <p>"I admit that," he said; "but that particular poster we find up is a
 fresh one. It was more or less shot-marked, as I pointed out to you;
 it was marked much as the body of the dead man was marked. If you
 remember, I suggested examining the poster by means of a magnifying
 glass, in the hope of finding some kind of printer's trade-mark, and
 we come back here for that purpose. We find the poster pasted over
 with a commonplace advertisement for somebody's mustard. It is not the
 habit of the bill-poster to go about the work at midnight."</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are not altogether correct, sir," Bates exclaimed.
"The working bill-poster is not tied to time. He has a certain amount
of work to do, and he does it pretty well when he pleases. Sometimes
they have to work very late. For instance, a stock piece put up at a
theater may prove a draw, and the management desire to keep it going
for a time. Then there is some work late ar night for some firm of the
paste-pot."</p>

<p>"Quite so, inspector; but does that apply to the harmless, necessary
mustard advertisement?"</p>

<p>"Not directly, perhaps. But suppose there had been a sudden rush of new
and urgent work, the routing would have fallen behind. Please understand
that the bill-poster does not career around in a casual way, sticking up
a poster just where it suits his fancy. All these hoardings are rented,
and big advertisers contract to have so many sheets displayed every week;
in fact, it is a most desultory business. Depend upon it, the bill-poster
who so lately posted up that alluring mustard tin had nothing to do with
the business."</p>

<p>It was all so logical and conclusive that Jack was compelled to drop
further argument. At the same time, it
seemed rather foolish to stand there doing nothing.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, struck by a sudden idea: "Why
not pull that mustard poster down,and get at the real
source of the truth. The paper is still wet, and I daresay
wem ight find a ladder behind the hoarding. Let us pull it
down,and take the whole thing to the police-station and
examine it at our leisure."</p>

<p>There was no objection to this, as Bates was bound to
admit. It was a very easy mattter
to find a way behind
the hoarding and secure the firmest of manyl adders. A
short one was sufficient for the purpose, and very soon the
great sheet that contained the mustard
advertisement was
pulled off the wooden hoarding and lay in a heap on the
pavement. In the place of it, fresh and strong, was the
yellow face of Nostalgo. Jack took the inspector's lamp
and regarded the poster carefully by the magnifying glass.
But there was no imprint to be seen, nothing to lead to the
identity of the firm who printed the placard.</p>

<p>"I can make nothing whatever of it," Masefield was
fain to admit at last.  "There are the shot holes plainly
marked as if somebody had used an air-gun or a pea-rifle.
Beyond that I can see absolutely
nothing of the slightest
significance. The best thing for us to do is to
see the contractor who has thejob in hand in the morning
and get him to saw the poster out of the wooden hoarding
for you. The strong light of day may make a difference;
but I am not as yet absolutely satisfied that that mustard
poster was placed exactly on the top ofthe yellow face
quite by accident."</p>

<p>Bates did not contest the point. He was getting tired
and sleepy, and it was very late. "Very well," he said,
"we will return to the police station in Shannon Street and
have another look at the dead man. It is just possible we
may find something there. At the same time, it may be
just as well to be on the safe side. I'll get one of my
men to come here and keep an eye on the hoarding to-night.
It is on the cards that he may see something suspicious.
I'll send a plain clothes man here to watch."</p>

<p>As Bates blew softly on his whistle a constable turned
up and saluted. He was to stay where he was until relief
came, Bates explained. Then he and Jack Masefield went
off in the direction of Shannon Street station. The place
was perfectly quiet; nobody had been brought in lately;
there was no sign of the tragedy here. In a rack near the
back, lighted by a skylight some six feet from the ground,
lay the murdered body of the man with the yellow face.
The malignant look had gone from his face; he seemed
calm and placid. As Jack bent over him it seemed to him
that there was a movement of the heart. He pointed
this out to the inspector, who shook his head.</p>

<p>"People not accustomed to these things often make the
same mistake," he said. "I have heard witnesses swear
that the body of this or that man was not bereft of life,
and in this belief they have been quite certain. Then a
doctor comes along and proves beyond a doubt that death
has taken place perhaps five or six hours before. Muscular
action is what probably deceives people. That poor
fellow is dead enough."</p>

<p>Masefield did not argue the matter. It was a sickening
business, and he felt that he would gladly see the end of
it. Not so Bates, who was inured to this kind of thing.
Very rapidly and skilfully he went over the bodyin search
of anything that might be likely to lead to the identification
ofthe deceased.  But the pockets were
  doubtless empty; there was not watch or chain, or purse, no markings on the
  linen.</p>

  <p>"Not even a laundry mark?" Jack suggested. "If my reasoning is correct, a
  laundry mark has often proved of the greatest assistance."</p>

  <p>"No mark whatever," said Bates. "The shirt, for instance, is of ordinary
  make, the class of thing that one buys ready made at a shop, and which has
  usually its maker's mark on. There has been a mark of some kind on the
  neckband, but it looks as if it had been blocked out with chemicals. See how
  much whiter and thinner the neckband is. We are simply wasting our time
  here."</p>

  <p>Jack said nothing: he could only shake his head sadly. The more the
  mystery came to be probed the more maddening did it become. A close
  investigation of the clothing presented as little result; there was nothing
  even about the boots to prove where they had been made. If the man was a
  criminal, and his general air suggested that, he had taken the most amazing
  precaution to prevent identification in case of accidents. Jack looked at the
  clear, dark features. This was no man to take anybody into his confidence.
  Success or failure, or crime, must all be undertaken alike alone and unaided.
  This face would never have led anybody to rejoice with him in good fortune,
  or sympathize with him in failure.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I had better be getting back to my rooms," Masefield said.
  "I have given you my name and address. I'll come round to-morrow and see if
  you have made anything out of the poster in the daylight. One thing is pretty
  certain&mdash;there should be no difficulty, if a determine d effort is
made, to
  discover the people who printed the picture of the yellow face. There are not
  many firms in this country capable of such work."</p>

  <p>"There is the Continent," Bates suggested. "I'm afraid that it will be
  very much like looking for a needle in a hayrick. Still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What deep philosophical remark Bates was going to make Masefield was not
  detained to hear, for at the same moment there was the sound of a sudden
  disturbance in the office beyond. The hoarse voice of a sergeant was heard
  demanding to know what this little game meant, there was a groan, and the
  collapse of a heavy body on the floor. Bates strode into the office.</p>

  <p>"What is all this row about?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"It's Gregory, sir," the sergeant replied . "Went off half-an-hour ago on
  some special work for you, or so he said, and here's he back as drunk as a
  lord; regularly collapsed on the floor, he did. It's not the first time,
  either."</p>

  <p>A sudden suspicion burst upon Masefield. He knelt by the side of the
  plain-clothes man and felt his heart There was a peculiar red mark round the
  man's neck as if something had been pulled very tightly round it.</p>

  <p>"The man is no more drunk than I am," Jack said. "He has been attacked and
  his breath is wholly free from any suspicion of drink. Look at that mark
  round his neck."</p>

  <p>Very slowly the prostrate man struggled to a sitting position. When the
  fact had once been ascertained that there was no suggestion of intoxication,
  brandy was administered to him. He had a strange story to tell. He was
  carrying out instructions when suddenly somebody came behind him and placed a
  rope round his neck. Before he could recover himself he was partially
  strangled; he lost consciousness and lay on the pavement. When he came to
  himself again he was quite alone. He had managed to struggle back to the
  station, and once there had collapsed on the floor. Robbery was not the
  motive, for he had lost nothing.</p>

  <p>"It's all part of the same mystery," Jack decided. "Something was going on
  behind that hoarding, and the criminals did not want the policeman to see. I
  shall walk back to my rooms that way. No, you had better not come along.
  Inspector, in case you are spotted. I shall just walk very coolly by and keep
  my eye on that hoarding. Good-night."</p>

  <p>There was nothing more to be done, so Masefield was allowed to depart. He
  had ample food for thought as he walked along the deserted streets. He came
  at length to the great hoarding where the poster had stood. He stopped just
  for a moment, almost too amazed to move; then he forced himself to go forward
  again.</p>

  <p><i>For the striking Nostalgo poster was gone. It had been sawn neatly out
of
  the boards of the hoarding, leaving a blank square eye in its place!</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; VANISHED!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was not to be supposed that this had happened without
  attracting the Argus eye of the press. The night birds of journalism had been
  hovering about, seeking their prey of sensational copy. They haunted the
  police station with a hope that something might turn up&mdash;the hope that
every
  reporter has that sooner or later he may happen on a good thing that has in
  it the making of some columns of red-hot descriptive matter.</p>

  <p>One of them, hungry and lynx-eyed, had seen the body of Nostalgo carried
  to Shannon Street station. There might have been a paragraph then; there
  might have been a column. At any rate, the chance was too good to be lost.
  The reporter was on the best of terms with the police for a square mile or
  so; indeed, his living more or less depended on the good fellowship of the
  local authorities. The sergeant had first of all set the ball rolling; the
  reporter had seen the body; he had no difficult in recognising the striking
  likeness between the dead man and the poster. Younger men wold have rushed
  off at once and made a long paragraph of this, manifolded it, and sent it
  broadcast along Fleet Street.</p>

  <p>But not the old and cunning hand at the game; his instinct told him that
  there was more to come. There <i>was</i> more to come, probably in the shape
  of the shaken Gregory, who presently told the reporter his part of the story.
  This was a case when a cab was justified. Half-an-hour later the reporter was
  closeted with the chief sub-editor of <i>The Daily Planet</i>, a half-penny
  morning paper dealing largely in sensations. The sub-editor's eyes gleamed
  as he listened to the reporter's story. This was something after his own
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Write two columns of it," he said, "You can use Daly's room. Serve it up
  as hot as you can with plenty of scare heads. We'll give it the first place
  on page five. You had better have a stenographer, as time is pressing."</p>

  <p>Therefore it came about that half a million or so readers of <i>The
  Planet</i> had the shock at breakfast the following morning. With its tally
  of many dazzling illustrations. <i>The Planet</i> had never been more
  successful than in this. The thing was admirably done. The mystery was
  amazing to a degree. Before 10 o'clock on the following morning London was
  talking about little else. It was discussed in the train, on the top of
  the omnibus, in City offices. The name of Nostalgo was on every lip.</p>

  <p>The editor-in-chief and the chief shareholder in <i>The Planet</i> Company
  came into the office very early in the morning&mdash;an action quite unusual
  with him, for his keen instinct scented a good thing for <i>The Planet</i>
  here. The thing was exclusively and he meant to work it to the last
  ounce. The little man with the bald head and the gold-rimmed spectacles had
  created a pretty scheme by the time he had reached his office.
Without loss of time he sent for Mr. Richard Rigby. Rigby came in response
to the summons. He found journalism more remunerative than the Bar.</p>


  <p>"This is the best thing we have ever had," Mr. Van Jens said in his
 staccato way. "I'm just going to show the British public what an American
  journalist can do with the thing. It's pretty clear to me that the police
  have blundered, as they always do, and that they have got off the track of
  the truth. We're going to solve the mystery, Rigby, and you are the man I
  have picked out to do it. In the first place, you are a clever actor, and you
  have pluck. Go about it in your own way, and take your own time. Don't mind
  the expense; spend &pound;1,000 if necessary. Only get to the bottom of this
  thing. If it's merely to prove, to the police that they can't do without the
  press. By the way, isn't Masefield a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>Rigby admitted that such was the case. He did not pretend to follow the
  working of his chief's brain; few men were competent to do that. Van Jens was
  leaning over <i>The Planet</i> in order to read the report of the Nostalgo
  affair.</p>

  <p>"I saw Masefield last night," he said. He did not tell Van Jens that he
  had met him at Carrington's, that was a matter concerning Masefield alone.
  "Do you think he is likely to be of any assistance to me?"</p>

  <p>"It is just possible. You see, it was Masefield who actually found the
  body of the man who we call Nostalgo. It is possible also that Masefield
  knows more than our reporter got to find out. You had better hint to
  Masefield that there is a chance of getting a commission from us to write a
  serial for one of our weekly journals&mdash;he is in the way of doing that
  kind of thing. Anyway, get him to regard it in a favorable light. If you
  handle the man properly, I feel sure that he will offer you valuable
  information."</p>

  <p>Rigby nodded. He did not tell Van Jens that Jack Masefield was a good
  friend of his, for that point had nothing to do with Van Jens, who regarded
  Rigby as the typical smart unit of the newspaper, and none too scrupulous so
  far as other men were concerned. As a matter of fact Rigby had his code of
  honor, and possibly his chief would not have considered it. Come what might,
  Rigby was not likely to take any advantage of Masefield.</p>

  <p>"All right." he said; "you may depend upon me to do all that I can. By the
  way, if I am to take this case in hand I must not be tied as to time. I
  mean that somebody else must be drafted to do my regular work and&mdash;and
  think nothing if I don't show up here regularly. I think that only fair."</p>

  <p>"Only fair, it is," Van Jens replied. "I'll see to all that. And I'll
  leave instructions with the counting house that they are to draw on me to the
  extent of &pound;1,000 if necessary. And now you had better go off to
  Masefield without delay."</p>

  <p>It was not yet 11 o'clock, and Rigby felt pretty certain of finding
  Masefield at home. He was perfectly correct in his conclusions, for Jack was
  busy just putting the finishing touches to a short magazine story. The
  morning papers lay in a pile on the table, but as yet he had not had time to
  open them. Rigby helped himself to a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Hope I don't intrude." he said. "If I am in the way, kick me out at
  once."</p>

  <p>"You are never in the way here, Dick," Masefield smiled. "As a matter of
  fact I have just passed the last page of this story for <i>The
  Grasshopper</i>. It's always a pleasure to sit down and write a story when
  you have a fair commission for it."</p>

  <p>"You will soon have plenty of them, my boy." Rigby said cheerfully,
  "especially now that you've got your name in the papers. Seen <i>The
  Planet</i> to-day? You haven't! Well, you are pretty prominent on page five,
  let me tell you. One of our men got hold of that sensational Nostalgo
  business, and then made a picture of it. Just run your eye along the report
  and tell me what you think of it. Pretty hot, isn't it? Now can you tell me
  anything?".</p>

  <p>"Anything fresh in regard to the affair you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You've got it first time. As a matter of fact. Van Jens has placed the
  thing in my hands, and I'm to get to the bottom of it if it costs the paper
  &pound;1,000. Van Jens suggested {hat I should come and see you and pump you.
  The bait to you is a commission for a big serial in one of our weeklies. But
  apart from all that, Jack, I'm quite sure that you will be ready to help me
  for old sake's sake."</p>

  <p>"Of course I will." Masefield said heartily. "Really, there is very little
  to tell; your man seems to have got it down very fine. But I can tell you all
  about the shot marks and the missing poster, only you must not publish
  that."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, you don't quite understand my position. I'm not sent as a
  mere scare writer in this business; I'm more of an amateur detective, with a
  pocket full of money. My task is to beat the police at their own game, and
  prove the superior intellectual force of the press. Than I shall write the
  whole story, and <i>The Planet</i> circulation will go up to a million."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll tell you all that there is to know," Jack replied. "When I have
  finished my story I shall have a few questions to ask you. Get your note-book
  out."</p>

  <p>Rigby had no cause for complaint on the score of Masefield's narrative. In
  the description of the shot marks and the subsequently missing poster he felt
  that he had conquered a fine point of the situation. He took another
  cigarette, and Jack did the same.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm going to ask you a few questions," the latter said, "and I should
  not be surprised that in replying to my queries we throw some fresh light on
  the object of your search. You will recollect meeting me at Carrington's last
  night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do. I look you for a fellow who's above that kind of
  thing&mdash;playing the amateur detective."</p>

  <p>"Notably, as I was in evening dress. As a matter of fact I had been dining
  with Anstruther, and it was after leaving his house that I found the body of
  the man we had better call Nostalgo. Of course, I recognised him by the
  likeness to the poster. Subsequently Inspector Bates and myself discovered
  the name of the firm who posted the creation. We went off to see the head of
  the firm, and he could tell us very little, except that the placards came
  from some John Smith who had an account with the City and Provincial Bank.
  The latter fact accounts for my being at Carrington's last night</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And you asked me to keep my eye on a pretty girl, who was deaf
  and who had for attendant cavalier a chap with a moustache like that of the
  German Emperor."</p>

  <p>"I am coining to that," Masefield went on. "I told you that I had been
  dining with Anstruther. Now, these two people left Anstruther's house, for I
  followed them. I will tell you a more striking thing about them later on; but
  I want to have my side of the affair cleared up first. Tell me what happened
  after I left Carrington's with Inspector Bates."</p>

  <p>"Well, I kept my eye on these people as you asked me. I tried to get some
  information about the fair one from Carrington himself, but he didn't seem to
  like the subject. He seemed depressed and a little bit uneasy, I thought;
  said it was a sad case, sort of relation of his, and that the man with the
  moustache was a foreign count or something of that sort. I wouldn't press the
  matter, as it would have been in bad taste, you see. But all the same, I did
  keep, an eye on these people, as you asked, me, and the end of it was that I
  followed them when they left the house... I don't know what made me do
  it."</p>

  <p>"At any rate I'm glad you acted in that manner." Jack said. "Did they go
  back in the direction of Anstruther's house? Did they take a cab?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the ordinary acceptance of the word," Rigby explained. "They
  walked as far as the top of Regent Circus, where a private growler was
  waiting. The cab was all black, the driver had a black livery. I could not
  see his face, as it was tied up with a silk handkerchief as if the fellow had
  tooth-ache or something of that kind. The four-wheeler was evidently waiting
  for them, for they got in at once."</p>

  <p>"Anybody else inside the cab?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, I was nearly forgetting that!" Rigby exclaimed. "I was just
  flush with the cab as it passed a lamp. There was another figure in the
  cab&mdash;a man, and as the light shone on his face I was about staggered
  with his resemblance to the poster of Nostalgo. I only saw the face just for
  an instant, but it is impressed upon my mind as if the man were standing
  before me at this very minute. Singular, was it not?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded dumbly. This was another new departure in the strange mystery.
  For the man seen by Rigby in the black four-wheeler could not possibly have
  been the same Nostalgo that Jack had found, seeing that the latter had been
  lying in Shannon Street some hour or two before the time that Rigby was
  speaking about.</p>

  <p>"You did not follow them further, I suppose?" Masefield asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't go as far as that. And at the moment I didn't think anything
  as to that Nostalgo business No. 1, so speak. If I had, you may bet your
  bottom dollar that I should not have lost the opportunity. The cab drifted
  away without any direction being given: so I went along, without giving it
  more consideration, to my club. Eh, what?"</p>

  <p>Inspector Bates had hurried into the room without ceremony. His face was
  pale and agitated.</p>

  <p>"Something strange come out at the inquest?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"No sir," Bates gasped, "for the simple reason that there has been no
  inquest. You can't hold an inquest without body. What do I mean? Why, that
  that body vanished from the room, leaving not a hint of a clue behind!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; No. 4 MONTROSE PLACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE inspector stood there with his hand on his heart, as if
  he had run far and fast. So far as Jack could see, Bates was suffering from
  some strong emotions. He flopped down in a chair indicated for him, and took
  Jack's proffered cigarette with a shaking hand. Although his feelings were
  not exactly under the control one would have expected from one of the leading
  lights of Scotland Yard, there was at the same time a certain suggestion of
  grim humor playing about the corners of his mouth. Jack looked across at
  Rigby and smiled significantly.</p>

  <p>"Evidently a new development of the case," Jack said, glancing once more
  at, his friend. "As a matter of fact, inspector I have just been telling Mr.
  Rigby all about last night's ghastly business By the way, you will recollect
  of course that Mr. Rigby is my friend whom we met at Mr. Carrington's last
  night. Not to make too long a story of it, there are sidelights of this
  business of which you are not at present aware-but all that is beside the
  point. What I want you to tell me is about this disappearance of the body of
  Nostalgo. Seriously, do you want my friend and me to believe that a dead man
  has disappeared from Shannon Street police station right under the eyes of
  the authorities?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is about the size of it," Bates admitted ruefully.
  "Naturally enough, we took forward to important developments at the official
  inquiry. I had a chat late last night with the doctor, who seemed to be of
  the opinion that the dead man had been shot with something quite new in the
  way of a weapon."</p>

  <p>"What, do you mean, a new projectile, or a new sort of small arm?"
  Masefield asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly that," the inspector replied; "but something quite new
  in the way of a missile. There were marks on the breast of our unfortunate
  friend which indicated the presence of a shot of some kind that did mortal
  damage without leaving traces of anything material behind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is all very well, so far as it goes: but what I want to get at
  chiefly is the cause of the disappearance of the body." Rigby put in
  impatiently. "What is the good of trying to establish all sorts of new
  theories when you have not so much as a dead body of the deceased man before
  you? It seems incredible to me that this outrage could have been committed in
  a police station. Was no one about? Was the whole place deserted whereby some
  stranger could have coolly stepped in and walked off with the body of a
  powerful man?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is not so difficult as it might seem," Bates said eagerly. "As
  a matter of fact, our mortuary is merely an outside room which at one time
  had been used as a kitchen. Mr. Masefield will recollect last night noticing
  that the light of the room consisted entirely of a kind of skylight. The
  ceiling is exceedingly low, so that it would be quite possible for a tall man
  to lift the body through and carry it away without the least trouble,
  provided, of courge, that he had sufficient strength. At any rate, there it
  is, and we have to make the best of it."</p>

  <p>"I hope that you have managed to keep this matter from the public so far,"
  Masefield said. "I don't think anything will be gained by allowing this new
  sensation to get into the papers. The best thing we can do is to come around
  to Shannon Street with you and see if we can lay our hands upon anything in
  the way of a clue. My friend Mr. Rigby has had a lot of experience in amateur
  detective work; I dare say you recollect his success in the matter of the
  Mortlake coiners, on behalf of <i>The Planet</i>."</p>

  <p>Bates expressed his willingness to fall in with this arrangement. Not that
  he had any particular confidence in amateur detectives generally; but he was
  so bewildered and disheartened at present that anything was preferable to his
  own painful thoughts. The police station was reached at length, and a
  thorough search of the shabby little apartment at the back of the office
  made. But no amount of investigation served to throw any light on this new
  phase of the mystery. It was even as Bates had said: with the darkness of the
  night, and expecting no developments of this kind, a bold and unscrupulous
  character might easily have entered the room and taken away anything, however
  bulky, without much chance of detection.</p>

  <p>Nothing daunted by the want of success attending his efforts, Rigby
  climbed onto the roof and looked around him. He was particularly struck by
  the deserted area at the back of the police station. It was some distance
  from his coign of vantage to the nearest house. No doubt at one time the open
  space had consisted of fertile gardens, but the same space was now given over
  to arid grass and a few stunted trees&mdash;a scene of desolation indeed. On
the
  opposite side, some 30 yards away, the backs of a terrace of large houses
  looked blankly on the scene. Rigby, with a new idea entirely in his mind,
  inquired the name of the terrace. Bates smiled with the superior air of the
  professional, and replied that it was Montrose Place.</p>

  <p>"And what class of people live there?" Rigby asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, rather mixed, I should say," Bates replied. "There was a time, not
  so many years ago, when Montrose Place was quite fashionable. Mind you,
  they're exceedingly good houses, quite good enough for any moneyed class: but
  I understand that the landlord is by no means a liberal man, and, as the
  houses have fallen out of repair, they have become void."</p>

  <p>Any further information on this head was cut short by the sudden calling
  away of the inspector. It seemed to Masefield that Rigby was by no means
  disposed to mourn for the official's company. He stood with his brows bent
  frowning at the sombre row of houses in front of him, but from the quick
  working of his hands. Masefield could see that his versatile friend's brain
  was busy.</p>

  <p>"I see you have made a discovery," Masefield said quickly. "Would you mind
  telling me what it is?"</p>

  <p>Rigby pointed to the fourth house from the end of the terrace. Did
  Masefield notice anything about it peculiar? he asked. But Masefield did not
  see anything about the house at all ominous or suggestive, except that the
  windows were grimy and dirty, and that the erstwhile fashionable silk blinds
  were hanging in tatters like banners behind the murky glass.</p>

  <p>"But surely you see something?" asked Rigby impatiently, "for instance,
  take the third window on the left over the ledge, which probably is that of
  the bathroom. Don't appear to be looking, and, at the same time, keep your
  eye casually on the window."</p>

  <p>With a quickening of his pulses, Masefield glanced up in a vague kind of
  way in the direction of the window. He felt instinctively that in some way
  the deserted house was involved in the disappearance of Nostalgo. There was
  not much time for speculation on this point. Very slowly and cautiously the
  blind was raised, and a haggard face peeped out. It was like a picture from
  some old print, this strange weird yellow face behind the grimy glass. So
  thick was the murky dust upon the casement that t was impossible at so short
  a distance to decide whether the features were those of a man or a woman.
  Anyway, the face. If it were that of a man, was clean-shaven, the pale head
  half hidden behind a tangle of thick black hair. It was only for a moment
  that this weird face presented itself to the eager eyes of the spectator
  below; an instant later and the whole phantom had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Now, what do you think of that?" Rigby asked eagerly. "Don't you agree
  with me that this strange apparition has something to do with the story? Now,
  supposing you or I had some powerful inducement for getting hold of the
  missing body, could we find a better place to work from than that deserted
  house?"</p>

  <p>"Provided always that it is deserted." Masefield said guardedly. "Don't
  let's go quite so fast. Surely your own experience must have taught you what
  strange creatures one often sees as caretakers in good houses?"</p>

  <p>"So much the better for me," Rigby replied. "If you are correct in your
  suggestion, it will make my task all the more easy; for, come what may, I am
  going to see the whole inside of that place before I sleep to-night."</p>

  <p>Rigby walked back into the police station with the air of a man who has
  said his last word on the matter. It was no advantage to him, working as he
  was on behalf of his own newspaper, to mention his discovery to Bates.
  Possibly Masefield's common-sense view of the problem might have been the
  correct one after all, in which case Bates would have had the laugh of his
  unprofessional ally. But Bates had evidently been called out on other
  business, so that there was no occasion to say anything to him at all.
  Declining to return to Masefield's rooms and there discuss the matter further
  over tea, Rigby went thoughtfully back to the office of <i>The Planet</i>. He
  dined alone at his club, lingering until about 10 o'clock over the evening
  papers, and then proceeded on his way to Montrose Place by the somewhat
  circuitous route of Covent Garden.</p>

  <p>But there was more method in Rigby's madness than met the eye. The sleek
  well-groomed barrister and journalist who entered the shop of Jonas the
  costumer shortly. after 11 o'clock emerged a little before 11 carefully and
  effectually disguised as a seller of newspapers. Then, with the fag-end of a
  cigarette of doubtful quality in his mouth, he slouched along towards his
  destination.</p>

  <p>Montrose Place from a front view was considerably more prepossessing than
  the similar outlook that presented itself from the back. At least half the
  houses were tenanted by people of means, judging from the neatness of the
  blinds and the amount of light displayed in the various windows. Yet, at the
  same time, it was quite evident that Bates' estimate was fairly correct.</p>

  <p>The first three houses in the terrace bore plates of highly-polished brass
  testifying to the fact that doctors were not lacking in this locality. No. 4,
  however, stood out in marked contrast to its neighbors. There was no chance
  of Rigby's presence there exciting undue suspicion, for there was not a soul
  to be seen in the terrace.</p>

  <p>Emboldened by this fact, Rigby had no hesitation in lighting a vesta and
  making a comprehensive examination of the door-steps. They were dirty enough
  in all conscience; no housemaid had knelt there for many months or even years
  past; but Rigby's sharp eyes did not fall to note the fact that some one more
  than once recently had left footprints on the grimy flags. They were not
  clearly indented footprints; indeed, there was a misty hesitation about them
  which at first puzzled the amateur detective exceedingly.</p>

  <p>He struck another match after looking cautiously up and down the terrace.
  Nobody was in sight: the precaution was quite unnecessary. The blue flame
  picked out the misty footprints grimed into the filthy steps, and then Rigby
  understood. Whoever made those marks had been wearing rubber-soled shoes.</p>

  <p>"And new shoes at that," Rigby muttered to himself. "I can see the pattern
  in the center of the sole clearly indented now. And the prints go and come up
  and down the steps quite regularly. Now, the fact that somebody comes here
  and wears new rubber shoes makes it clear that the wearer has been here very
  recently. It is also evident that the wearer wears rubber-soled tennis shoes
  so as to make no noise. I feel pretty certain that I am going to learn
  something now."</p>

  <p>But Rigby was a little too sanguine. In the first place, he had to gain
  admission to the house, the front door of which was locked. It was perhaps a
  significant fact that, though the lock of the door was green with rust, the
  edge of the rim of the hole where the latch-key indented was bright and clear
  at the edges.</p>

  <p>"Evidently used regularly." Rigby went on. "Now, the ordinary caretaker
  does not usually sport a latch-key; he or she generally uses the area door. I
  should not wonder if the area window was open; I'll try it."</p>

  <p>The area window was not open, but the loose catch had been carelessly
  pushed to. The blade of a stout penknife sufficed to prize the catch, and a
  moment later Rigby was in the housekeeper's room, safe from all outside
  observation.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of life here; no vestige, of it on the stairs leading to
  the big rooms overhead. Rigby could not but notice what a fine house it was;
  the last tenant had evidently been lavish in the way of decorations. With a
  match in his hand, carefully shaded from the window, Rigby crept up the
  stairs. He could see in the dust lying there the constantly repeated
  footprint of the rubber shoe, indicating that the owner of that shoe was in
  the habit of spending a great deal of time there.</p>

  <p>But now, so far as he could judge, the house was absolutely deserted. He
  tried door after door softly, and each yielded to his touch, revealing gloom
  and desolation and dirt by the faint light of the vesta. As each stump burned
  low Rigby carefully dropped the end of it in his pocket. He was conscious of
  a feeling of disappointment. Almost before he was fully cognisant of that
  feeling he paused in an attitude of rigid attention. Something like the sound
  of a smothered cough struck on his ear; it seemed to him that he could hear
  somebody approaching. The stair creaked, and Rigby drew back into a
  doorway.</p>

  <p>He was not mistaken. Somebody was coming up the stairs.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE CHOPIN FANTASIE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was nearly two hours later before Rigby crept cautiously
  down the steps and emerged by the way in which he had entered the house. The
  street, as before, was absolutely deserted; so far as Rigby could see, he
  might have been in a city of the dead. Despite his disguise and the artistic
  make-up of his grimy face, an acute spectator would not have failed to notice
  the agitation of his features. He crept with trembling footsteps to the
  roadway, and clung to the railings with a swaying air of one who has seen
  things the tongue refuses to describe. Then his natural courage, fanned by
  the cool air of the evening and the sense of being no longer isolated,
  returned with virile force to him. Mechanically he fumbled in his rags and
  produced from a breast pocket a silver cigarette case, that might have got
  him into serious trouble if a lynx-eyed policeman had been near at hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have seen some queer things in my time, but, as the poet says,
  'never aught like this'," Rigby said, with teeth that chattered a little. "I
  really must have one of my own cigarettes."</p>

  <p>Despite his excitement, Rigby was conscious that he ought to be just a
  little ashamed of himself. He had always prided himself upon the fact that
  his nerves were perfectly under control and that nothing ever put him out,
  otherwise he would not have occupied the position he did at <i>The Planet</i>
  office. He began to feel the effect of the cool night air, which braced him
  like a tonic. As he stood there waiting for something&mdash;though he would
have
  found it difficult to say what&mdash;a policeman came slowly down the
street. Rigby
  stooped and pretended to be busy with his stock of papers.</p>

  <p>Some spirit of mischief moved him to chaff this representative of the law,
  and at the same time test to the utmost the disguise that he was wearing.</p>

  <p>"Paper, sir?" he asked. "All the winners&mdash;the horrible murder in
Grosvenor
  Square. Ain't you going to buy one?"</p>

  <p>Apparently the officer was one of the good-tempered sort, for he only
  smiled, and in a more or less gruff voice ordered the news-vendor to move
  on.</p>

  <p>"Just waiting for my pal, sir," Rigby explained. "I have never come down
  this street before, an' I'll take good care never to come down here again.
  Why. half these houses seem to be empty. Look at that show opposite. 'Ow long
  since anybody has lived there?"</p>

  <p>"Before I came on the beat, anyway," the policeman explained. "Do you want
  to take one?"</p>

  <p>With a laugh at his own pleasantry the policeman walked off down the
  street, leaving Rigby easier in his mind and quite satisfied that his
  disguise would stand any ordinary test.</p>

  <p>He leaned against the area railings absolutely undecided as to what to do
  next With a certain new caution almost amounting to cowardice&mdash;a
feeling of
  which he would be ashamed at any other time&mdash;Rigby turned his back upon
the
  man who was advancing down the street. At the same time, so full was he of
  the horrors that he had lately witnessed, the amateur detective quite forget
  the fragrant cigarette so out of keeping with his character. The stranger
  pulled up and, crossing the pavement, tapped RIgby familiarly on the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You are not so clever as you think you are," the stranger remarked
  coolly. "You may be a very smart chap, Dick, and I may be a very dull one,
  but I have certainly sufficient brains to know that the average newspaper
  tout does not smoke Turkish cigarettes. Besides, after our conversation this
  morning, I felt pretty certain that you would make an attempt to get inside
  that house."</p>

  <p>Rigby laughed in a way that suggested that his nerves were in a
  considerably frayed condition.</p>

  <p>"So that's you. Jack," he said, with a sight of relief. "Yes, you are
  quite right; in fact, I told you I should not rest to-night until I had seen
  the inside of that house."</p>

  <p>"And did the expedition come up to expectations?" Masefield asked
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I have had some weird experiences in my time, but I would
  not go through the last hour again for the wealth of the Indies. In fact, if
  I tell you what I've seen, you would set me down for a doddering
  lunatic."</p>

  <p>The look of self-satisfaction on Jack's face faded away. He shivered with
  a strange presentiment of something dire about to happen. Again, why should
  he doubt the fact that something terribly out of the common had happened to
  Rigby after his own amazing experiences?</p>

  <p>With his hand on the arm of his friend, he walked abstractedly the whole
  of the terrace. Here a great arc light threw a stream of pallid blue upon the
  motley coloring displayed upon a big hoarding. In the center of the hoarding,
  well displayed, was the terrible placard disclosing the grinning features of
  Nostalgo.</p>

  <p>"By heaven!" Jack exclaimed, "there is no getting away from the features
  of that grinning devil I know as well as if I had seen it down in black and
  white that the awful experiences which have so changed you lately have to do
  with that yellow face."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to deny it," Rigby replied; "and, what is more, I am not
  going to tell you what I have seen in the last two hours&mdash;at least not at
  present. And now tell me, to change the subject, what is your private opinion
  of Spencer Anstruther?"</p>

  <p>To say that Jack was taken aback by the suddenness of the question would
  be a mistake. It will be remembered that on the occasion Masefield last dined
  with Anstruther he had pointed out to Claire the amazing likeness between
  Nostalgo and her guardian. Not that it was possible for anybody to
  notice this except when Anstruther was moved to emotion; but the fact
  remained. And to find that Rigby's mind was strangely moved in the same train
  of thought was, to say the least of it disturbing.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by asking that question?" Jack said guardedly.</p>

  <p>"For goodness' sake do not let us have any of this unnecessary caution
  between friends like ourselves," Rigby said with great feeling. "Believe me,
  my friend, I am not asking this question out of idle curiosity. As man to
  man, is he a magnificent genius or the greatest criminal the world has ever
  seen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Thus put to it, Jack had no hesitation; indeed, he <i>could</i> have no
  hesitation in replying to such a direct question as this.</p>

  <p>"I am going to speak quite candidly to you." he said. "As you are pretty
  well aware, knowing the man quite well as I do, he is, like most geniuses an
  exceedingly poor man. At the same time, unlike most geniuses, he is as
  unscrupulous as he is clever. I have more than an idea that he could tell us
  all about this affair, but I prefer to pose as a person who has come into
  it by accident, and who is only languidly interested. I have had some
  hesitation about mentioning my estimate of Anstruther's character to his
  ward, but I feel very uneasy as far as Claire is concerned. I know for a
  fact that Anstruther is painfully hard up: really, there are times when his
  financial straits are absolutely desperate. This being so, it has occurred to
  me more than once that Claire's money must be a strong inducement to prevent
  her marrying, for instance, myself."</p>

  <p>"That is by no means a remote contingency." Rigby suggested dryly.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, to be perfectly frank with you, Miss Helmsley and myself
  have been engaged for the past six months. Mind you, this is a dead secret. I
  have a presentiment, call it foolish if you like, that the announcement of
  this fact to Anstruther will be the first moment of real danger for Claire.
  But why do you so suddenly spring this question upon me?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply Rigby drew his companion into the comparative shadow of a
  doorway. He had hardly done so before another figure came jauntily down the
  street&mdash;a tall, slim figure who seemed strangely familiar to
Masefield.</p>

  <p>"The whole place seems to reek of Anstruther to-night." Jack said, "or
  perhaps it is my disordered imagination. But if that is not Anstruther
  himself, my eyesight strangely deceives me."</p>

  <p>"If you knew as much as I do, or you had learned what I have learned the
  last hour, you would not be surprised," Rigby said . "However, we will soon
  settle that. I'll just step across the road and try and sell him a
  paper."</p>

  <p>Before Jack could lay a detaining hand on the arm of his friend, Rigby was
  half way across the street. In the appropriate raucous voice of the tribe,
  the amateur news vendor tendered Anstruther an <i>Echo</i>. He waved the
  offer aside, and made his way down the street with the air of one who has a
  definite object in view. With a whine artistically uttered, Rigby fell back
  upon the doorway in which Masefield was concealed.</p>

  <p>"Anstruther beyond all shadow of doubt," Rigby said triumphantly. "Now, I
  am not a betting man, but I will give you any odds in reason that our
  interesting friend enters No. 4. Ah, what did I tell you?"</p>

  <p>Surely enough, Anstruther paused in his stride before the dilapidated door
  of No. 4. With one swift glance up and down the street to make certain that
  he was not observed, he drew a latch-key from his pocket and disappeared
  within the dingy portals. On the still night air the click of the latch-key
  and the muffled banging of the door could be heard all down the road. Rigby
  drew a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think that'll do for to-night," he said. "I reckon I have had
  just about as much as my nerves will stand. No, I am not going to tell you
  anything, and I have no stomach for further adventures this evening. I am
  going straight to bed, to sleep if I can. Come around and see me tomorrow
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>But curious as he was, and anxious also as he was. Jack was forced to
  decline the proffered invitation. Besides, he had promised to take Claire to
  a matin&eacute;e concert at the Albert Hall to hear a new violinist who so
  far had only performed twice before in England. Signor Padini had come to the
  metropolis with a marvelous reputation, but so far he had hardly fulfilled
  expectations. Still, it was not the habit of music lovers like Claire and
  Masefield to accept a verdict of this kind at second-hand. Therefore they had
  determined to hear the new virtuoso for themselves.</p>

  <p>Not that any thoughts of a harmonious and musical kind were running in
  Jack's mind as he walked home to-night Try as he would, he could not dismiss
  the idea that some grave peril was impending, and that Claire was likely to
  be the central figure of the tragedy. But it is the blessed privilege of
  youth to throw off the haunting cares and doubts that assail their elders,
  and Jack suffered little on the ground of sleeplessness that night. All the
  same, the haunting fears were with him again on waking in the morning.</p>

  <p>But perhaps Claire noticed something of this, for she put the direct
  question to her lover when he called on her the next afternoon. Yet Jack had
  no intention of saying anything for the present. He began to speak somewhat
  hurriedly of the new violinist, Signor Padini, and so the conversation lasted
  till the Albert Hall was reached.</p>

  <p>There was nothing particularly attractive in the concert generally, and
  both waited somewhat impatiently for the foreigner to appear. He came at
  length, tall, slim and clean-shaven, and Claire noticed with an amused smile
  that for once she was in the presence of a master who eschewed long hair. She
  turned and whispered something to this effect to Jack, who did not appear to
  be listening.</p>

  <p>"Now, where have I seen that fellow before?" he muttered. "Call me
  foolish, if you like, say this man is an absolute stranger to England if you
  please; but I am absolutely prepared to swear that his face is quite familiar
  to me."</p>

  <p>But perhaps it was merely a chance likeness, Claire suggested. She was far
  too interested in the musician to take much heed of what Jack said. Evidently
  this man knew his business to his finger tips; the way in which he handled
  his bow would have proved that to any critic. Claire glanced down the
  programme; and no sooner did the wild sweeping music come streaming from the
  strings than the whole audience thrilled responsive to the master's touch. He
  was not. after all, playing the piece standing against his name on the
  programme, but the peculiar weird and mournful <i>rhapsodie</i> of Chopin's
  that Jack had heard Anstruther interpreting two nights before. He leaned
  back; his eyes were half closed with a strange sensation that he was
  listening to Anstruther now. He turned to suggest something of this to
  Claire, and to his surprise he noticed that her face was paler than his
  own.</p>

  <p>"Does anything strike you?" he whispered. "Have you a feeling, like
  myself, of having gone through all this before?"</p>

  <p>"Dreadful!" Claire shuddered. "I know exactly what you mean. It is the
  same, precisely the same, as if my guardian had crept inside the body of
  Padini&mdash;There! Did you notice that particular slur, that strange half
  hesitation? I declare. I feel certain that this Padini was in my guardian's
  study the other night. Jack, you must get at the bottom of this; there is
  some mystery here which we must solve, and that without delay."</p>

  <p>Jack rose from his seat and buttoned his coat firmly about him.</p>

  <p>"Ay," he said, "a deeper mystery than you are aware of. Stay here while I
  go behind the stage. I am going to see Signor Padini, and get to the bottom
  of this business at any cost."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE MAN WITH THE FAIR MOUSTACHE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CLAIRE sat there, her mind half on her music and half on the
  extraordinary conduct of her lover. Not that she did not trust him
  implicitly; but still, it seemed strange that he should have gone off without
  explaining he cause of his agitation. Some one next to her touched her on the
  elbow and asked a question as to an item the programme. The question was
  repeated twice before Claire realised that she would have to pull herself
  together. She replied quite at random; then she looked about her, and became
  cognizant of the fact that Padini was still on the stage, bowing his
  acknowledgements of the thunderous applause which had greeted his magnificent
  efforts.</p>

  <p>Yet a closer glance did not serve to show Claire anything sinister in the
  artist's personality. He was pale and clean-shaven, palpably very nervous,
  and yet pleased with the warmth of his reception. Surely there could have
  been no mystery connected with a manlike this.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the marvelous likeness between his playing and the
  execution in the same piece displayed by Anstruther two nights ago could not
  possibly be overlooked by anyone professing to any musical knowledge at all.
  Claire hoped that the inevitable encore would produce a repetition of the
  same piece.</p>

  <p>Surely enough. Padini came forward and struck the opening bars of the same
  <i>rhapsodie</i>. With eyes closed and mind eagerly concentrated on the
  music, Claire followed every passage with rapt attention. There was no longer
  any possibility of mistake. The Padini interpretation of the piece was
  exactly that of Anstruther. Was Anstruther, therefore, a consummate master of
  his art or a showy humbug or charlatan? Could it have been possible that this
  new artist had been concealed in the Panton Square library two nights before?
  But on the face of it, this was absolutely impossible. Padini had only been
  in England a little over eight and forty hours, and his first appearance in
  London had been at a musical "at home" on the same night that Anstruther had
  played the Nocturne in Panton Square. Claire was still debating this problem
  in her mind when Jack returned to his seat. He looked a little pale and
  shaky. but the grim smile on his face was determined enough.</p>

  <p>"My dearest girl. I am going to ask you a little favor." Jack whispered.
  "I hope you won't think it the least rude of me, but I want you to excuse me
  going back with you. Can't you guess that there is something more than meets
  the eye here?"</p>

  <p>"I should be very blind indeed If I did not." Claire replied. "Jack, what
  is the meaning of this strange mystery? Either Signor Padini was at our house
  the other night, or m y guardian learned to play that <i>rhapsodie</i> after
  having had lessons from the man on the platform before us."</p>

  <p>"I may be wrong, of course," Jack said, "but I feel pretty sure that I
  have guessed the problem. That is why I want you to go off by yourself and
  lead me to play the detective so far as Padini is concerned. It is not
  altogether a pleasant job, but I am going to follow that fellow when he
  leaves the Hall."</p>

  <p>So saying, Jack rose from his seat, and Claire obediently followed his
  example. Once outside, Jack called a cab, and gave the driver his
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"I think that will be all right," he said. "You may expect me to come
  round after dinner, my darling girl. I hope you are not the lest annoyed with
  me, but there is danger ahead for you and me, and it is my duty to prevent it
  as all hazards. I declare if I had not almost forgotten one of the most
  important things. I had to say to you. On no account are you to breathe a
  word of this afternoon's visit to your guardian. He is not to know that you
  have been with me or anybody else to the Albert Hall to-day."</p>

  <p>Claire glanced at the pale, anxious face of her lover and gave the desired
  assurance. She felt perfectly safe in his hands; he would tell her all there
  was to be told in due course; and now for the first time she congratulated
  herself on the fact that her engagement had been kept a secret from
  Anstruther.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Jack had returned to the back of the Hall. So far as he could
  recollect, Padini was down on the programme for no further item that
  afternoon, therefore it was only a matter of waiting till the violinist
  emerged, and following him to his destination. But Jack had succeeded in
  consuming three cigarettes without any sign of the artist rewarding his
  patience. Taking half a crown from his pocket, he crossed the road and
  proceeded to interview the stage door keeper.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that foreign-looking chap, is it?" the stage door guardian said.
  "Signor Somebody or other who plays the fiddle. Why, he's been gone the last
  ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Gone!" Jack exclaimed, with palpable dismay. "Why, I have been watching
  most carefully for him the last half hour. Was he wrapped up or shawled in
  any way?"</p>

  <p>Whilst Jack still stood arguing there a slim young man, with fair
  moustache turned upwards &agrave; la German Emperor, passed and repassed him
  hurriedly. The stranger passed into a smartly appointed hansom and
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's your man," the doorkeeper exclaimed. "He must have
  forgotten something and returned for it."</p>

  <p>Jack muttered his thanks, parted with his half crown and went into the
  roadway thoroughly puzzled. He could not for a moment doubt the word of the
  doorkeeper, who was naturally an expert in the recognition of faces. As a
  matter of fact, the man with the turned-up moustache was the same individual
  who had been so mysteriously concealed in Panton Square, and who had
  afterwards accompanied the deaf-mute girl to Mr. Carrington's. On the stage
  Padini had appeared as a slight, slim man, whose face was absolutely devoid
  of hair.</p>

  <p>Jack stood thoughtfully in the middle of the road, wondering what to do
  next. His first idea was to go at once and look up Rigby. He must have been
  standing there a great deal longer than he had imagined, for presently he saw
  the smart hansom return and take its place on the rank.</p>

  <p>Here was a slice of luck indeed. Jack crossed over and hailed the
  hansom.</p>

  <p>"Here. I want you to drive me to the office of <i>The Planet</i>," he
  said. "I suppose you know where that is. Do you want to earn an extra half
  sovereign?"</p>

  <p>"That's the way I was educated," said the cabman, with a grin. "Oh, my
  last fare, is it? Well, I can easily answer that question. Gent with the
  cocked-up moustache. I have just driven him to Panton Square."</p>

  <p>Jack stepped into the hansom, feeling that luck was entirely on his side.
  He knew now that he was on the track of something more than mere coincidence.
  For 5 Panton Square was no less a place than the residence of Spencer
  Anstruther, Claire's guardian. Here was proof positive that Padini. the
  violinist, a perfect stranger to London, was at any rate on terms Of
  friendship with Anstruther. There was nothing for it now but to seek out
  Rigby and tell him all that had happened without delay. Rigby was found in
  his room at <i>The Planet</i> office, mournfully drawing skeletons on a sheet
  of blotting paper. He nodded thoughtfully as Jack came in; then, catching
  sight of the latter's eager face, asked what was in the wind.</p>

  <p>"I have been making discoveries galore," Jack responded, "You would hardly
  expect me to do that through the medium of an afternoon concert; but there it
  is. You have heard of this new violinist Signor Padini, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." Rigby said indifferently. "Well, a typical class of foreign
  boomster. I suppose."</p>

  <p>"That is not the point" Jack proceeded to explain. "You will recollect
  what I told you about the empty study in Anstruther's house from which the
  music proceeded in that strange, unaccountable manner. Naturally, I thought
  the player was Anstruther himself&mdash;Anstruther wonderfully improved or
inspired
  beyond all recognition; but now I know that such was not the case. Dick,
  there is something devilish in this strange business&mdash;the empty room, the
  unearthly music, the strange appearance of that young man with his deaf-mute
  companion, followed so closely by the death of Nostalgo. What does it all
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"I will give a thousand pounds to know." Rigby responded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I can tell you," Jack went on. "You will recollect the
  night before last, during our chance meeting at Carrington's, that I asked
  you to keep an eye on a young man with moustache turned up &agrave; la German
  Emperor. Would you be surprised to hear that this young man was no less a
  person than Signor Padini?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Rigby exclaimed. "How could you prove such a statement?"</p>

  <p>"Well. I am going to prove it, anyway. Together with Miss Helmsley I went
  to hear Padini this afternoon. By some strange freak of fate he had chosen
  Chopin's <i>Rhapsodie</i> in F as his item on the programme. Directly he
  began to play my mind went back to that strange, weird music in Anstruther's
  study. It was not I alone who noticed this subtle resemblance; in fact,
  Claire recognised it as soon as I did. Mind you, every musician of note has
  his little tricks and fancies which are absolutely peculiar to himself. When
  I shut my eyes, I could literally house.</p>

  <p>"I sent Claire home in a cab, and proceeded to wait till Padini left the
  Albert Hall. I missed him, of course, for Padini was a clean-shaven man on
  the stage. As a matter of fact, he must be a very conceited creature, seeing
  that in private life he wears a fair moustache. I got that from the
  doorkeeper; but what is more to the point, the cabman who drove me here is
  the same man who half-an-hour ago dropped Padini at Anstruther's house. Now,
  I would like to know what you make of that."</p>

  <p>Rigby listened thoughtfully to all that Jack had had to say. The
  significance of the revelations was not lost upon him.</p>

  <p>"And yet, I dare say, Anstruther would deny any knowledge of Padini if you
  asked him," he said. "Still, we know a great deal, and, clever as Anstruther
  is, he cannot possibly conceive the fact that we are so closely acquainted
  with his movements. Let's go and call upon the beggar, shall we? Pretend that
  we want to consult him on some matter of business. Anything will do. Did you
  keep your cab?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes; it occurred to me that we might want him again, and ,besides,
  the driver can prove that he left Padini at 5 Panton Square."</p>

  <p>Panton Square was reached at length; the cabman had been discreetly
  dropped at the corner of the street. Jack rang the bell, which was answered
  by Serena. In the full light of the afternoon sunshine her strange,
  inscrutable face looked more haggard an strange than usual. There was the
  same furtive droop of her eyelids, the same pitiable shake of her hands, that
  suggested the beaten hound that Jack had so often noticed before. He would
  have given much, as a writer of stories himself, to have known the secret
  history of this woman. Docile and tame as she appeared to be, she was still
  capable of possible emotion, or the dilatation of her black pupils spoke
  falsely. Though she was meek and friendly enough, there was ever a suggestion
  that she was on her guard.</p>

  <p>"Your master in?" Rigby asked breezily. "But we know that he is. Don't you
  trouble about us; we will go to the study ourselves."</p>

  <p>Serena stood there as if something gripped her throat and choked her
  utterance.</p>

  <p>"But my master is not at home," she protested. "He has not been at home
  all day: neither do I know what time to expect him to-night I fancy he is out
  of town altogether."</p>

  <p>"That's rather awkward," Rigby said. "We came here on business, expecting
  to meet a friend of ours. I suppose you have seen nothing of him&mdash;a
tall, slim
  young man, with rather a fierce type of moustache?"</p>

  <p>"There has been no visitor calling here to-day," Serena replied, with the
  air of one who repeats a well-learned lesson. "I am the only servant in the
  house at present, and should have known if anybody had called."</p>

  <p>Jack did not dare to glance at his companion, feeling that those dark,
  interrogating eyes were fixed upon his face. A sudden Impulse moved Jack; he
  decided upon trying the effect of a swift surprise. He tapped the woman
  familiarly on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come, come," he said, with a jocular ring in his voice. "Do you mean to
  tell me that you have not had a visit to-day from Signor Padini?"</p>

  <p>A stifled cry broke from the woman; she clenched her hands in an attitude
  of pain.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; WHAT DID SHE KNOW?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOTHING was said for a full minute. Serena stood there,
  gazing from one to the other as a child might do who finds herself in the
  presence of two harsh taskmasters. There was something pitiable about her
  hopelessness; the fighting glint had left her eyes; she stood there downcast
  and shaking as a slave might do.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I do not understand what you mean," the woman said.</p>

  <p>In a way Jack was feeling very sorry for Serena. Ever since he had known
  Anstruther and been a friend of the household the woman had held a certain
  subtle fascination for him. Though Jack had not made as yet much progress in
  the paths of literature, he had all the quick dramatic feeling which is
  essential to the making of a successful novelist.</p>

  <p>It had often occurred to him that so mysterious a figure as Serena would
  have made a splendid character for a strong novel. He watched the woman
  carefully now; he saw how her breast was heaving, and what a great fight she
  was making to keep her emotions under control.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I must press you for an answer," Jack said. "Signor Padini
  can be nothing to you, and yet you start and cry out when his name is
  mentioned as if I had struck you a blow. Now, tell me, was the man I speak of
  a visitor to this house last night? What time did he come?"</p>

  <p>"My master's business is my master's business," Serena said sullenly. "He
  tells me nothing&mdash;he tells nobody anything. And who am I, a humble
servant
  like me, to ask questions of my master?"</p>

  <p>Rigby shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. He began to see that there was
  nothing to gain here. He nodded to Jack, and half turned away. But Jack was
  not to be so easily suppressed.</p>

  <p>"But, surely," he urged, ""you would be doing no harm in telling us if a
  foreign gentleman called here last night?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you nothing," Serena cried. "Why do you come and bully a poor
  woman like this?"</p>

  <p>And yet, at the same time, though Jack knew bow faithful she was to her
  master, he could not but feel that she was not antagonistic to Claire and
  himself. With a sudden impulse he pushed his way into the hall, followed by
  Rigby.</p>

  <p>"We all make mistakes sometimes," he said. "Now, are you quite sure you
  have made no mistake about your master? Mr. Anstruther is a law unto himself;
  he comes and goes as he likes, and it is just possible that he might have
  returned without you being aware of the fact. There is nothing to be
  frightened about; we are not here to murder him for the sake of his Apostle
  spoons."</p>

  <p>As Jack ceased to speak he made a swift sign to Rigby behind the woman's
  back, and the tatter understood. He would go off to the library, and see for
  himself if Anstruther had returned. As the hall door closed behind him.
  Serena rushed impulsively forward and threw herself headlong at Jack's feet.
  Her attitude had entirely changed; she was no longer the half-dumb slave of
  circumstance, no, longer a mere machine answering to the call of her master,
  but a living, palpitatng woman. The change was so quick, so dramatic and
  unexpected, that Jack had no voice of protest left to him.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, do not do it," Serena whispered hoarsely; and it not
  that, for your own sake I implore you to stay your hand. Oh, I am not so
  blind end foolish as you think&mdash;I am not the dull, stupid creature that
my
  master takes me to be. You can deceive him where love and honor are
  concerned, but you cannot blind my eyes, because I have loved, alas! too well
  myself. Do not think that I pry and watch, for such is not my nature. And yet
  I know as well as if you had told me in so many words that Miss Claire and
  yourself are something more than friends, I cannot speak more plainly because
  I dare not; but if you would save the girl you love from the terrible danger
  that hangs over her, you will be blind to all that goes on in this dreadful
  house."</p>

  <p>The words which had begun so hoarsely and quickly came at the finish with
  the torrentlal force of a mountain stream. Surprised as he had been Jack's
  self-possession had not quite deserted him. Hitherto he had regarded the
  silent Serena, as an old woman, but now that her face was transformed and
  glowing with emotions he could see that she was still comparatively young. He
  could see also, and the fact gave him a vague sense of satisfaction, that the
  woman's sympathies were entirely with Claire and himself.</p>

  <p>"Will you get up, please," he said, and his own voice was just a little
  shaky. "It is not right for a woman to kneel to a man like that Serena, you
  are not what you seem. You are not a servant in the ordinary acceptation of
  the word; you spoke just now like a refined and educated woman. You may say
  that is no business of mine, and, indeed, I do not wish to pry into your
  past, but you must see that this matter cannot possibly stop here. You denied
  just now that Signor Padini had been here at all. You denied the presence of
  your master, and yet I can hear his voice on the other aide of the study door
  at this moment. You will perhaps also deny that you heard of No. 4 Montrose
  Place."</p>

  <p>It was merely a bow drawn at a venture, but the shaft seemed to strike
  home to the feather. Serena had risen painfully and slowly to her knees; she
  staggered back against the table and contemplated Jack with dilated eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have gone further than I dreamed." she moaned. "You are a strong,
  masterful man, and I see now that nothing I can say will turn you from your
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"Since you have made up your mind to that," Jack said grimly, "perhaps you
  had better be candid with me and tell me all you know. For some time past I
  have felt a strong conviction that Anstruther is no better than a consummate
  scoundrel. Discreet as he is, I have come to the conclusion that this is no
  house for Miss Helmsley. I am quite certain that you would find both of us
  more sincere friends than the man you call your master. Why not, therefore,
  leave him and throw in your lot with us?"</p>

  <p>The woman wrung her hands piteously; Jack could see the tears rolling down
  her face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if I only could&mdash;if I only dared," she whispered: "and yet I
  cannot, even if it were only for your sakes. If you only knew what was
  hanging over you&mdash;but I must say no more. When that man comes to me,
when I
  stand before him with his eyes looking into mine, I am compelled to give him
  up the secrets of my very soul. I wish from the bottom of my heart
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Serena clutched at her throat with a quivering hand, as if something
  choked her, and rushed impulsively from the room. She had said nothing, and
  yet she had said so much. Her very reticence, her hesitation to speak
  definitely against her master, had proved conclusively to Jack what a
  consummate scoundrel Anstruther was. He was still debating the matter in his
  mind when Rigby came back to him. The latter did not speak; instead of that
  he took Jack by the arm and piloted him quietly and firmly to the front door.
  They were in the street before Jack could ask the meaning of this cautious
  conduct.</p>

  <p>"One can't be too cautious in a case like this," Rigby explained. "It was
  just as I had expected. Anstruther was at home; he, indeed, had not been out
  all day, which fact was proved by his still being in dressing-gown and
  slippers. Our usually self-contained friend had either been dissipating last
  night or he has had disturbing news; at any rate, he was very pale and shaky,
  and did not seem in the least pleased to see me. Not that I think that he was
  in the least suspicious of my visit."</p>

  <p>"Did you happen to see anything of Padini?" Jack asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I did and I did not," Rigby explained. "At any rate, the Italian
  was not in the study, though he had been there. from the simple fact that a
  music case and a rather jaunty-looking Homburg hat rested on a side table.
  Did you happen to notice if Padini was wearing a Homburg hat this
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Jack was able to reassure his friend on that point, whereupon Rigby
  proceeded to ask if anything had happened during the time he was left alone
  with Serena. Rigby listened with interest to all that Jack had to say.</p>

  <p>"That's a woman we ought to get hold of," he said thoughtfully. "Unless I
  am greatly mistaken, she can tell us all we want to know. As a matter of
  fact, she has told us a great deal, though perhaps without knowing it At any
  rate, from what you say. she is quite aware of the fact that something
  uncanny is going on at 4 Montrose Place. I feel perfectly certain that the
  body of Nostalgo was smuggled away via that empty house; we know perfectly
  well that Anstruther is in the habit of going there, and we are equally sure
  that the very mention of the house filled Serena with terror. As we have
  plenty of time on our side, and there seems to be no immediate hurry, you and
  I are going to keep our eye on that place. You were very anxious last night
  to know what I had seen there. Well, you have plenty of pluck and courage of
  your own: you shall come with me presently and verify the thing for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say we are going to keep a vigil there to-night?" Jack
  asked.</p>

  <p>"That's about the size of it," Rigby answered coolly. "You had better come
  round to my rooms not a moment later than half-past ten. Mind you, we are not
  going there as ourselves, but you can leave a disguise quite safely to me.
  Don't bring a revolver or anything noisy of that kind: something in the way
  of a thick stick would be much safer. By the way, didn't you tell me that you
  were going to see Miss Helmsley to-night? Take my advice, call there and dine
  as if nothing had happened, and directly Anstruther makes an excuse to return
  to his study slip away from the house without the formality of leave-taking
  and come to my place at once."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was not easy work for a straight-forward fellow like Jack to sit with
  Anstruther on the other side of the table discussing trivial topics as if
  there was nothing grim and terrible behind this picture of refined home life.
  Jack was conscious of carrying himself off fairly well, what time Anstruther
  rose from the table with an excuse that he had work to do.</p>

  <p>"Please don't think I am avoiding your company," Anstruther said
  pleasantly, "and don't be annoyed if you hear the sound of my violin
  presently. As a matter of fact, my thoughts are always clearest when inspired
  by the sounds of music."</p>

  <p>Jack muttered something suitable to the occasion and exchanged glances
  with Claire directly Anstruther left the room. Just as that genius had
  prophesied, the sweet strains of the violin stole from the study presently.
  Claire listened with an interest that was vivid and thrilling beyond
  words.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to that," she cried. "Did you ever hear anything like it? Did
  you ever hear Mr. Anstruther play in that style and manner before. Note the
  little slurs, the half hesitation, which is at once so dramatic and artistic.
  If you close your eyes, you might swear that you are listening to Padini
  himself!"</p>

  <p>"It really is amazing," Jack murmured, "Padini to the life; the Italian to
  a semi-tone. And yet we know perfectly well that it cannot be Padini, because
  at this very moment he is waiting to take his turn at The Queen's Hall
  concert. Claire, you must try to get to the bottom of this. I cannot possibly
  believe that this infernal juggling is conceived merely to satisfy the vanity
  of Anstruther, for, in the first place, we form so small an audience. There
  is something behind this much more serious than the soothing of a clever
  man's vanity. And now I must be off."</p>

  <p>Claire pleaded with her lover to stay a little longer, but, mindful of
  Rigby's strict injunctions, he was fain to refuse. In the light of recent
  knowledge he had no occasion to feel sure that Anstruther was still on the
  premises, despite the fact of those exquisite strains emanating from the
  library. He had not forgotten the strange experience in that direction two
  nights before. Still, the sweet, melancholy melody could be distinctly heard
  by Jack as he crossed the road.</p>

  <p>Rigby was impatiently awaiting his friend, and he had all the disguises
  set up to his bedroom. He listened eagerly to all Jack had to say whilst
  artistically making himself up as a news-vendor. A glance at him in the glass
  reassured Jack; he felt pretty sure in his mind that no one could possibly
  recognise him attired as he was now.</p>

  <p>"What's the programme?" he asked, completing the illusion with a short
  clay pipe. "Are we going straight away to Montrose Place?"</p>

  <p>Rigby replied that that was the intention. It was getting near to 11
  o'clock before the friends reached Montrose Place; so far as they could see
  they had the terrace entirely to themselves. A policeman strode majestically
  down the road, flashing his lantern here and there, and finally disappeared
  from sight.</p>

  <p>"Now's our time," Rigby said eagerly; "no chance of being interrupted for
  the next ten minutes. You stand at the top of the steps whilst I sneak down
  and open the window. We shall have to fumble our way upstairs, because it is
  by no means safe to use matches. Still, I have the photography of the house
  quite clear in my mind. Come along."</p>

  <p>They were in the grim, dusty house at last. Jack was conscious only of the
  intense darkness and musty smell of the place. Carefully piloted by Rigby, he
  reached the second floor landing at length, and there Rigby grasped his arm
  significantly. There was no sound at first save the scratching of mice behind
  a panel or the flutter of some ragged blind swaying in the piercing draught.
  Then suddenly it seemed to Jack that a solemn footfall sounded in a room
  close by. A door opened with a pop like pistol crack, and a long slit of
  light, dazzling in its brilliancy fell like a lance upon the dusty floor.
  Somebody laughed somewhere, a laugh that sounded so near and yet so far away:
  then the door opened wider, and a partial view of the interior of the room
  could be seen.</p>

  <p>Utterly taken by surprise, moved and horrified to the depths of his soul.
  Jack could have cried out, but for the hand clasped upon his mouth like a
  steel trap.</p>

  <p>"Not a sound," Rigby whispered sternly. "For heaven's sake, restrain
  yourself. and look, look!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE SHADOW ON THE WALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK needed no second bidding; he was only too anxious and
  eager to follow the direction of Rigby's outstretched finger, He was by no
  means lacking in the nerve and pluck which generally go to a young man of
  fine physique and clean habit. But there was something about the whole of
  this affair, a creeping suggestion of diabolical crime, such as one only
  encounters in the wildest realms of fiction. And yet it seemed to Jack that
  his reading of the daily press recalled things just as vile in every-day
  life. With teeth clenched firmly, with a stern resolution to do nothing very
  likely to precipitate what might have been a terrible catastrophe, Jack
  looked into the room before him. As the door was half open and the two
  friends were hidden in the blackish shadow. It was possible to watch without
  the slightest chance of being seen.</p>

  <p>For an empty house, dusty and gloomy and deserted as it was, the room in
  front of our two adventurers presented a striking contrast to the rest of the
  place. There was no window, or at least, where the window ought to have been,
  something in the way of an iron shutter stood, and over this a great wealth
  of silken hangings was artistically arranged. As to the rest of the
  apartment, the furniture was directly in keeping with the abode of a
  millionaire. Jack did not fail to notice the rich Persian carpet, the
  luxurious chairs and settees of the First Empire period, the fine pictures on
  the walls. The walls, too, had been recently decorated, so that there was not
  a single jarring note to mar the harmonious whole. There were flowers, too,
  grouped in the corners of the room and piled cunningly around the electrolier
  standing on the center table.</p>

  <p>"Now, that is a strange thing," Jack whispered. "So far as I could see, so
  far as I can see now, there is no sign whatever of the electric lighting in
  any other part of the house. Do you suppose that these people have taken this
  house in the ordinary way, or is it possible that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," Rigby replied. "They're not the sort of people to do
  anything as foolish as that. Nor would there be any occasion to go to the
  expense. Depend upon it, they know all about the character of the owner of
  this property, and that it is not in the least likely to let unless put
  thoroughly in order."</p>

  <p>"Then, what about the electric light?" Jack suggested. "That would have to
  be put in by somebody. These people could not tap the main, or anything of
  that kind."</p>

  <p>"There's a much simpler way than that, my dear fellow. Dr. Adamson lives
  next door, and I know perfectly well that he has electric light. It does not
  require much technical knowledge to wire a house, and anybody with a small
  amount of common sense could easily drill a small hole through a partition
  and attach a wire to one of the main lines next door. I think that explains
  the problem."</p>

  <p>Jack had no further question to ask for the moment. His full attention now
  was concentrated on the occupants of the room. There were three of them
  altogether, two being dressed like superior mechanics, and were evidently
  there for some purpose connected with machines. The third man, superior in
  every way to his companions, had his back turned the door, so that it was
  impossible to get a glimpse of his features. He had in front of him an
  ingenious-looking arrangement, not unlike a magic lantern, a contrivance for
  throwing cinematograph pictures on a screen. At a signal from him, one of the
  workmen drew back the silken draperies covering what ought 33 to have been
  the window, and a white sheet stood confessed.</p>

  <p>"Give me the third slide by your left hand," the operator commanded. "That
  will do. Now switch out the light."</p>

  <p>There was a click and a jerk, and immediately the whole room was plunged
  in darkness, save for the fierce disc of blinding light that flashed upon the
  screen. Almost immediately a dazzling disc was transformed to the face of a
  man. Jack clutched at the arm of his companion.</p>

  <p>"By heaven! do you see that?" he whispered. "It is nothing more nor less
  than the face of Nostalgo. Do you think this is merely the development of
  some novel form of advertising, or is it possible these fellows have hit upon
  some novel way of putting in posters?"</p>

  <p>But Rigby had nothing to say. He was too deeply interested in the
  spectacle before him. It had occurred to him for the moment that there might
  have been something in what Jack suggested. It was just possible also that
  what he took to be a large sheet was no more than a wide stretch of
  paper.</p>

  <p>At any rate there was no hurry. There would be plenty of time to ascertain
  whether the supposed sheet on the wall was paper or not. Rigby had made no
  reply to Jack's cogent question, but he seemed to be quite as interested as
  his friend.</p>

  <p>"Hang me if I know what to think of it," he said at length. "It seems to
  me as if these fellows were trying to work out something quite new in the way
  of lantern slides. Mind you. It is just possible that we are mistaken
  altogether in our assumption that Anstruther is carrying out some cunning
  rascality. These men may, after all, be no more than honest workmen."</p>

  <p>"I can't quite see that point," Jack replied. "Honest workmen do not, as a
  rule, come in this furtive way to an empty house. Besides, look at them."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," Rigby argued. "But suppose that you were engaged
  upon some secret process which you did not want anybody to know anything
  about. And, besides, Anstruther is quite a genius in his way, and there is no
  reason why he should not be engaged upon inventing some new process of
  lithography."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Jack said, "is it not a strange coincidence that they
  should be manufacturing these Nostalgo posters? I grant you that Anstruther
  is absolutely a genius, but his talents always take on a sinister bent. In
  fact, I don't think that fellow could be honest if he tried. Still, we have
  plenty of time to find out."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that is paper?" Rigby asked. "It looks to me like
  it."</p>

  <p>"It looks to me like it, too." Jack said; "but we shall have to possess
  our souls in patience."</p>

  <p>"Hang me if I don't go and see." he said. "No, I don't see that there is
  any great danger unless they should happen to turn up the light again, and I
  do not suppose they will do that until the experiment is finished."</p>

  <p>"For goodness sake, do nothing rash," Jack implored. "From what we have
  already seen, we have to do with a gang who would not hesitate to cut our
  throats if it served their purpose."</p>

  <p>The thing, after all, was not so hazardous as Jack had imagined. Just for
  an instant, as if by accident, one of the shaded electrics on the wall
  flashed out in a pin-point of diamond light.</p>

  <p>"You clumsy fool!" growled the man behind the lantern. "What did you do
  that for? You might have spoilt all my work by your blundering folly."</p>

  <p>The erring workman grunted out something in the way, of an apology and a
  promise that he would be more careful in the future. Here, then, was Rigby's
  opportunity. He knew now that there was no likelihood of the light being
  turned on again for some time to come. All he had to do, therefore, was to
  creep cautiously, wriggling like a snake across the floor, until he could
  touch the huge screen and ascertain whether it were paper or cloth.</p>

  <p>He took a penknife from his pocket and opened a small blade. So dense was
  the darkness of the room by contrast with the vivid lane of light thrown upon
  the screen that the journey was practically devoid of peril, so long no one
  touched the switch of the electrics. Therefore Rigby crept along, his nerves
  braced to the highest tension and an exhilarating sense of danger strong upon
  him. He could see now that the white sheet extended from floor to ceiling,
  the edges of seeming black and firm like an iron in contrast with the
  brilliant white center.</p>

  <p>He was close to it now, so close indeed that, with a cautious movement of
  his arm, he could touch the sheet. A single prick with a sharp point of his
  knife gave him all the information that he needed. It was a sheet of paper
  surely enough. A moment later Rigby was standing by Jack's side once
  more.</p>

  <p>"Paper," he whispered. "Really, this adventure is likely to prove prosaic
  after all. Don't you think we are rather making a mountain out of a molehill?
  We know that Anstruther is a great rascal, but at the same time he is an
  exceedingly clever man, and, as you know, inclined to be secretive. Now,
  isn't it just possible that our friend has hit upon some new process of
  photo-lithography, and that we are witnessing an experiment to demonstrate
  the value of the new idea."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so." Jack replied. "Indeed, since you have been away, I
  have made something in the way of a discovery also. Mark well the picture
  thrown upon the screen yonder. You know what it represents, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Well, naturally. I have seen the diabolical face of Nostalgo on too many
  posters not to be absolutely familiar with his ugly mug. Depend upon it,
  those fellows are printing the famous poster in some way known to themselves.
  Maybe we shall see that self-same sheet on some hoarding to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"But that is not what I meant at all," Jack proceeded to explain. "If you
  are as familiar with the poster as you say you are, you will notice a
  considerable difference in this one. In the first place, the face is a little
  more in profile, and surely you must notice the difference in the hands."</p>

  <p>"Right you are," Rigby replied. "In the present instance the hands are
  half-extended, as if in the act of clutching something. Strange that I had
  not noticed that before. What do you make it out to be?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Jack whispered. "I think our ingenious friend behind the lantern
  will explain that for himself."</p>

  <p>The leading operator in the room gave a short curt sign and the brilliant
  lights flashed up once more. The slide was also drawn from the lantern, but
  the sinister features of the dark, repulsive face upon the screen did not
  vanish as might have been expected. On the contrary, the grim face frowned
  down as if it had been brushwork from the pencil of some imaginative artist.
  One of the workmen approached the sheet and dragged it to the floor. Then the
  three men in the room bent over the poster and examined it critically.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that the hand is a little out of drawing." the leader of
  the trio remarked critically. "Give me the paints&mdash;the white paint, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>The speaker took a brush heavily charged with some white pigment and
  proceeded to touch up the hand. He cut that portion from the sheet and placed
  it in the slide of the lantern. Then another large sheet of paper was erected
  in front of the window, and the lights turned out again. Almost immediately
  there appeared upon the disc the shadow of a huge, bony hand uplifting a
  dagger in a menacing attitude. A grunt of approval came from the man behind
  the lantern, and once more the lights were turned up.</p>

  <p>"There, what did I tell you?" Jack asked eagerly. "I am sure the different
  attitudes of that man's hand are meant for signs."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it would seem so," Rigby was forced to admit. "We'd better stay
  here and await developments."</p>

  <p>For the next hour or so the mysterious process of printing the posters
  continued. It was exactly as Jack's ingenious mind had forecast. In every
  instance, although the dark and sinister features remained the same, the
  attitude of the hand was different. It was a strange and most important
  discovery that the two of them had made; but, instead of making the task
  easier, the problem had become even more intricate. Was all this part of some
  cunning device for attracting public attention, something absolutely new in
  the way of advertisement, or did it signify a deeper and more sinister
  purpose?</p>

  <p>Jack recollected now how frequently Anstruther had alluded in his hearing
  to the ramifications of secret societies. With his intimate knowledge of
  criminality, and having every assistance of the police always at his
  disposal, Anstruther's acquaintance with the seamy side of life was extensive
  and peculiar. But was he now helping the police as usual, or was he engaged
  himself in some ingenious conspiracy for the aggrandizement of himself and
  his satellites?</p>

  <p>It was difficult to say. It was still more difficult to prove anything,
  seeing that the work of printing was still progressing in silence. If these
  men would only speak. If they would only utter some word which might give a
  clue to what they were doing , the spies would have been more satisfied.
  Their only hope was to watch and wait on the off-chance of a careless
  word.</p>

  <p>They were listening so eagerly indeed that they almost failed to notice
  the sound of a footstep which now echoed on the stairs. They were so close to
  the door that anyone reaching their landing from below could hardly fail to
  make out the outline of their figures. Rigby had barely time to drag his
  companion back into the velvety darkness beyond before the newcomer was past
  them and had entered the room.</p>

  <p>"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?" the newcomer cried. "How
  are you getting on? Nobody interrupting you? Seen nothing of the police or
  anything of that kind?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt as to who that is." Rigby whispered. "I should recognize
  Anstruther's voice anywhere. I told you he was at the bottom of this
  business."</p>

  <p>Anstruther stood before them, tall and distinguished in his evening dress,
  and there was not sign about him that he was doing anything more than
  pursuing a quite normal occupation.</p>

  <p>"Not a bad evening's work," he said. "Are we all here, or is Carrington
  late again? Confound that fellow! I begin to wish we hadn't taken him into
  the business at all. But I do not think he is likely to play me false: it
  will be a bad day's work for him if he does."</p>

  <p>"Carrington, too," Jack muttered significantly. "That is your rich banker
  friend, Dick. The plot thickens apace. It seems impossible for any body to
  come in contact with Anstruther and retail his respectability."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; LOCKED IN!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">QUITE unconscious that his most dangerous enemies were so
  near, Anstruther carefully selected a cigarette and lighted it. He proceeded
  then to make a careful examination of the pile of posters at his feet, and
  smiled his approval.</p>

  <p>"Very good, very good indeed; those hands stand out beautifully. Within a
  week's time from now the message will have been carried from London to St.
  Petersburg and from Paris to Constantinople. The men I am after cannot get
  away from me. Whatever great capital they are in, that poster confronts their
  eyes like an avenging conscience. Then they realize their helplessness and
  bow to the inevitable. You may doubt me if you like; but I tell you that this
  scheme is absolutely sure and safe."</p>

  <p>"Provided that we have the money to carry it out," the man behind the
  lantern grunted. "Don't forget that, clever a s you are, you can't make money
  by merely holding up your little finger. You promised us a thousand pounds
  when we had finished our part of the bargain, and that was completed a month
  ago. Of course, you have got the cash in your pocket?"</p>

  <p>A frown of annoyance crossed Anstruther's face. There was a clenching of
  his hands not unlike that depicted by the poster of the mysterious Nostalgo;
  he made a half step forward; then he seemed to get himself in hand again, and
  smiled carelessly.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact. I have not the money in my pocket. Things are not
  going quite as welt lately as I could have wished, but it is only a matter of
  a day or two anyway; nay, it is only a matter of hours. Is the woman
  here?"</p>

  <p>The man behind the lantern sulkily declared that he knew nothing about the
  woman, and cared less. He asked pointedly whether they were to expect Mr.
  Carrington that evening, and, if so, whether his visit was likely to be
  attended with substantial results.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I don't know," Anstruther said angrily. "I told him to be here
  at eleven o'clock, but I suppose he has funked it. But the woman is a very
  different matter. Jacob, go into the back room and bring her in here."</p>

  <p>"Not I." the man addressed as Jacob replied. "I don't forget the last time
  we met. She may be milk and honey to you. but she is prussic acid as far as
  <i>I</i> am concerned."</p>

  <p>Anstruther stepped to the doorway and whistled softly. It might have been
  a call given to a well-broken dog, so careless and contemptuous was it.
  Indeed, Anstruther did not wait to see the result of his summons, but
  returned to the room with the easy assurance of a man who knows that his
  lightest call will be obeyed.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the two watchers standing on the landing were conscious
  of a shadowy form passing close to them. They had no time to shrink back,
  they had not even time for surprise, when a light hand was laid on the arm of
  each and an eager voice began to whisper in their ears.</p>

  <p>"Rash to the verge of madness." the melancholy voice said sadly. "I warned
  you not to come&mdash;I implored you not to take a hand in this business. I
could
  have settled it all for you had you left all to me; but youth ever will be
  served. Won't you go away even now and leave it all to me?"</p>

  <p>There was something so pitifully imploring in the speech that the
  listeners thrilled in sympathy. From the first word they had no difficulty in
  guessing the identity of the speaker. It was none other than Serena who was
  addressing them in those despairing accents.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you are too late, Serena." Jack said. "Besides, we have some
  one else to consider in the business. It is possible that your efforts may be
  successful as far as we are concerned; but we have discovered to-night that
  Anstruther is plotting against the happiness of many people who are as
  innocent as ourselves. I tell you, we must see this thing through now. But
  why stay here, why linger, when your tardiness is likely to increase our
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>At this point Anstruther advanced toward the-door and whistled again, this
  time more sharply. With a sigh of deep regret Serena walked forward and
  entered the room. In the bright light of the apartment her face looked paler
  and more dejected than usual. Though Jack had seen for himself the volcano of
  passion and emotion of which Serena was capable when not under the influence
  of her employer, he could not fail to notice how tame and frightened she
  appeared to be now. It was as if Anstruther possessed something like a power
  over her. Her dark eyes seemed mechanically to follow his every movement; he
  had only to raise his hand and her look followed it.</p>

  <p>"So you have come at last." Anstruther said. "How long have you been in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"I came as soon as you told me, master." Serena murmured, like one who
  talks in her sleep. All will power seemed to have gone out of her for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"What would you have of me to-night?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther replied harshly that Serena must know perfectly well what was
  required of her. Nevertheless he proceeded to detail his instructions, which
  were still unfinished when another footstep was heard upon the stairs and a
  newcomer entered. The two watchers outside were not in the least surprised at
  the pale, somewhat conceited features of the violinist Padini; indeed, they
  were past all surprises now. Padini had bowed with an air of exaggerated
  politeness to Serena.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, my coy fascinator," he cried, "so I am not to be deprived of the
  pleasure of your company. I am not likely to soon forget the enchanting
  evening we spent together <i>chez</i> Carrington. I am sorry to be late,
  Anstruther, but the fact is your English audiences are not to cold as I had
  first imagined. Positively they would not let me off with less than four
  encores. <i>Ma foi</i>, you must have had the full value of your money in
  your chamber music to-night. A rare treat for Miss Helmsley; doubtless she
  has noticed the marvelous improvement made by her guardian in his playing of
  late."</p>

  <p>The violinist chuckled as if in the enjoyment of an exquisite joke. Serena
  flashed him a glance of bitter hatred and contempt.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know the meaning of this," Rigby whispered. "I suppose
  it refers in some way to the mysterious music which you told me about last
  night Do you think it possible that Serena could enlighten us on this point,
  as she appears to know all about it? If not why does she look at Padini in
  that scornful way?"</p>

  <p>Any further signs of enjoyment on the part of Padini were cut short by an
  impatient oath from Anstruther.</p>

  <p>"That is mere child's play," he exclaimed. "Very clever and all that kind
  of thing, but an intelligent schoolboy might have done as well."</p>

  <p>Jack intimated in a whisper to Rigby that he himself stood in the position
  of the said intelligent schoolboy. He had a pretty shrewd Idea how the thing
  had been managed, and to what purpose; but there would be time enough to
  explain all that presently. What they had to do now was to stay as long as
  possible and gather all they could from a careful study of the proceedings
  taking place in the room. It was Anstruther who first broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to stand fooling here all night?" he exclaimed angrily.
  "Padini, get that exaggerated fur coat of yours off, and make yourself up to
  look like an English gentleman as far as possible. You will find everything
  necessary in the room at the back of the house. The same remark applies to
  you, Serena, my word! To think that a woman so pale and so haggard, as you
  are now can made up to look like eighteen and possess the beauty of Diana!
  What a pity it was you ever left the stage!"</p>

  <p>The woman's face flushed angrily. There was a nervous tension about her
  to-night that Anstruther had never noticed before. Was she going to be
  defiant? he asked. Did she understand what she was doing when she proposed to
  measure her strength against his? But the flame still raged on Serena's hot
  cheeks, and her lips were still hard and mutinous.</p>

  <p>"Take care you do not drive me too far," she whispered hoarsely. "A cat is
  a harmless creature enough, but I read once of a cat that turned upon a man
  and killed him. You dare to taunt me with my past When I think of what that
  past might have been but for you, I declare that I could find it in my heart
  to kill you. I am so weak and timid, you are so strong and brave; and yet
  even you must sleep at times, and a man asleep is as harmless as a babe. A
  speck of gray powder, a drop of liquid no larger than a pin's point placed
  between your teeth, and the career of Spencer Anstruther is finished."</p>

  <p>The words were uttered with such dramatic force and intensity that even
  Anstruther refrained from smiling. It seemed to the listeners outside that
  here was a great genius lost to the stage.</p>

  <p>"I should not care to encounter this woman's hostility," Rigby murmured
  "Look at the intense expression of her face. But, really, I hope she is not
  going to defy him to-night if she does we are likely to have trouble for our
  pains."</p>

  <p>But Serena's outbreak of passionate anger was over as swiftly as an April
  shower. She looked up on the face of her master as a dog might do that had
  been convicted of theft. Anstruther smiled with the air of a man who merely
  tolerates a passing anger of a fellow-creature. It was as if he had caged
  this woman so that he could watch her passions and emotions as a naturalist
  studies the habits and ways of loathsome insects.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you must give vent to you feelings sometimes," he said. "And
  now that you have had a little fling we had better get on with our business.
  You will go with Padini to-night to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Serena cried. "I Implore you to spare me that humiliation again.
  What have I done that I should have to endure all this&mdash;what can be
possibly
  gained by it?"</p>

  <p>For the first time Anstruther displayed real signs of anger.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me," he said. "Once for all. I tell you not to speak to me
  like that again. Do you think I have studied you all these years for nothing?
  Do you suppose I do not know how disloyal you are in your heart towards me?
  There is one class of woman who has to be ruled by fear alone, and you are
  one of them. You will do to-night what I ask you, not merely to-night, but by
  months and years, in and out. It will be for me to order and for you to obey.
  And, whilst we are on the subject, you are to say nothing further than you
  have already said to Mr. Masefield. You understand what I mean. It was quite
  evident that Serena understood the full significance of Anstruther's speech.
  Pale as her face had been before it turned now to a still more deathly
  pallour. She essayed to speak, but her lips refused the office.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," she managed to stammer out at length. "If you
  accuse me of disloyalty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anstruther intimated that that was exactly what he did mean. It was rather
  an uncomfortable moment for Jack, listening there. He was beginning to fully
  realize the marvelous cunning of the man with whom he had to deal. He
  wondered how it was possible for Anstruther to discover the gist of his
  conversation with Serena that afternoon. He was saying something of this in a
  whisper to Rigby when Padini returned to the room. The violinist was dressed
  now exactly as he had been attired two nights before when Jack had seen him
  at Carrington's chambers. His jaunty air for the moment had vanished; he
  looked suspicious and uneasy. Anstruther's keen eye noticed this as it
  noticed everything.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's the matter?" he asked. "Have you seen a ghost or something
  equally terrible?"</p>

  <p>"No. I haven't." Padini replied sulkily. "But I am pretty sure there is
  somebody in the house. I am ready to swear that I saw the shadow of a man
  moving on the landing outside."</p>

  <p>With a contemptuous smile Anstruther walked toward the door. There was
  perhaps no immediate danger for the listeners, seeing that Anstruther
  evidently attached no importance to Padini's statement: but it was just as
  well to be on the safe side. Rigby slipped quietly into a doorway leading to
  a bedroom and dragged Jack in after him. The he closed the door very gently
  and waited for further developments. He had not long to wait, for almost
  immediately there was a click of the latch, and Anstruther's receding
  footsteps melted into silence.</p>

  <p>"Well, that sets your mind at ease," Anstruther was heard to my. "If there
  are any birds here, I have them safely caged."</p>

  <p>With a feeling of apprehension, Rigby laid his hand on the door-knob. His
  worst fears were absolutely realised. He and Jack had been locked in the
  room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; THE PARABLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no help for it; they could only wait to see what
  circumstances had in store for them. It would have been just as well,
  however, to have known what was in Anstruther's mind when he locked the door.
  So far as the prisoners could judge, Anstruther had spoken with a kind of
  jocular contempt, and had apparently acted more to soothe Padini's nervous
  fears than as if he had moved on the spur of his own suspicions. Rigby had
  not failed to notice this, and Jack was inclined to agree with him as they
  discussed the matter in whispers. At any rate, a quarter of an hour passed
  without any signs without.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friend," Rigby muttered, "you always were fond of adventures,
  even as a boy, and now you seem likely to get your fill of them."</p>

  <p>"I don't call this an adventure at all," Jack replied; "not much chance of
  action here. The prospect of being locked up all night in this cell of a
  place is not at all alluring. Just try that door again."</p>

  <p>But th e attempt proved abortive. It was pitch dark there, a darkness like
  that of Egypt, which could be felt. The mere fact of the sense of sight being
  suspended seemed to increase the hearing of the prisoners, for they did not
  fail to note every word that was passing in that room across the corridor. It
  was plainly evident that the business arrangements which had brought those
  people here to-night were practically finished, for presently Anstruther
  could be heard walking down the stairs, shouting his final instructions as he
  went. A moment later the fine slit of light which gleamed like a thread under
  the door of the vacant house died away swiftly, therefore proving to Jack and
  Rigby that the house had been plunged into darkness. It was a proof also that
  the conspirators had left the premises.</p>

  <p>"I think this is where ire come in," Jack muttered; "we'll give them
  another five minutes or so, and then we will run the risk of striking a
  match. I suppose you have got some matches in you pocket."</p>

  <p>Rigby had purchased an extra-sized box of vestas as he came along, so that
  there was no trouble on that score. The liberal fire minutes had expired
  before the scratch of a match, and a spurt of blue flame illuminated the
  room. It was by no means an inviting apartment, being absolutely devoid of
  furniture save for a tattered carpet on the floor. The carpet, had obviously
  been a good one in its day, in spite of the dust which lay so thickly upon
  it; the decorations of the walls had evidently been an expensive business. At
  the same time it was quite patent that the room had been used for the storage
  of valuables, seeing that the door fitted close and was lined on the inside
  with steel. The window, too, was barred heavily although it was far enough
  from the ground.</p>

  <p>"Well, we are in a nice mess," Jack muttered. "So far as I can see, we
  shall have to wait here till morning and then summon assistance by means of
  the window. In the meantime we can devote our energies to making up some
  ingenious story with a view to deceiving the police. So long as it is
  daylight, I don't think we have much to fear from Anstruther and Co. Do you
  think the light shows through the window?"</p>

  <p>There appeared to be no fear of that, seeing that the curtain was a
  comparatively thick one. Over the mantlepiece were the pipe and bracket of a
  solitary gas jet. In a fit of idle curiosity Rigby turned on the tap and
  applied a match to the burner. Much to his surprise, a blue fishtail flame
  spurted out bright and clear.</p>

  <p>"Well, these people don't seem to have half done it," he exclaimed;
  "they've evidently tapped the gas much in the same way that they tap the
  electric light, but why they want both beats me."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless for something like business purposes." Jack suggested. "It is
  pretty evident that these people have a lot of mechanical contrivances here,
  therefore something in the way of heaters would be necessary. My word, how
  close this room is!"</p>

  <p>Rigby was emphatically of the same opinion. He turned off the roaring
  flame of gas and pulled back the curtain from the window. He successfully
  fumbled for the catch, and at length managed to raise the sash. The cool,
  sweet night-breeze was grateful to a degree after the stifling atmosphere of
  the room.</p>

  <p>There were no lights to be seen, for the simple reason that they were at
  the back of the house, and looking down into a dreary sort of fore-court
  formed by the houses on either side and a big building beyond. As their eyes
  grew accustomed to the gloom, it was possible to note the fact that the
  fore-court had at one time been carefully cultivated, for a broken fountain
  could be made out, and what appeared to have been at one time a well-tended
  rose garden.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody down there," Rigby whispered. "Unless I am greatly
  mistaken the said somebody is smoking a most excellent cigar. Can't you smell
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can," Jack responded</p>

  <p>"These seem to be rather an aristocrat type of rascal. If you look across
  to the far corner, beyond that fountain place you will see the tip of a cigar
  glowing like a star."</p>

  <p>It was exactly as Jack had said. They could see the cigar glowing and
  fading as he smoker inhaled or exhaled the fragrant tobacco, and a moment
  later they saw something more. Out of the gloom there approached the figure
  of a woman, tall, slender and bareheaded, her dress hidden by a long black
  cloak that reached to the ground. She spoke quickly and hurriedly, so quickly
  indeed that the two men at the window found it impossible to follow what she
  said. They could see pretty plainly, however, and did not fail to notice the
  fact that the strange woman appeared to be pleading for some favor. She
  stretched out her long, bare arms to her companion in an attitude of
  supplication; her long cloak fell away from her shoulders, disclosing an
  evening dress of some pale, transparent material. There were diamonds, too,
  in her fair hair.</p>

  <p>"What is the use of wasting my time like this?" the man with the cigar
  demanded. "You ought to have been at your destination long ago."</p>

  <p>"But I couldn't go, I really couldn't, until I had seen you again.
  Besides, there is no place like this, and no better spot for an interview
  that one wants to keep a profound secret. For instance, it is hardly possible
  that any prying eyes are overlooking us. I can't imagine anybody being hidden
  in this old house. When Anstruther locked that bedroom door just now, do you
  really suppose he imagined there was anybody on the premises?"</p>

  <p>The smoker responded with a contemptuous grunt. It was evident that he
  entertained no suspicions on that score.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am unduly nervous and excited to-night," the woman went on.
  "But I could have almost imagined that there were spies following Anstruther
  to-night. If I were alone and had no more pressing thing to do, I would go
  back into the house and unlock that door. Imagine my feelings if I really did
  find two spies there."</p>

  <p>"What confounded nonsense you are always talking!" the smoker burst out.
  "I suppose this comes of writing poetry. Who on earth do you suppose is in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"How could I possibly tell? The police, perhaps, or perhaps somebody who
  is interested in Anstruther's beautiful ward, Claire Helmsley. I am fond of
  Claire and would suffer much so that she would escape injury. Really, I could
  make a story out of this, Richard. I would find Mr. Jack Masefield in that
  room, together with his friend Dick Rigby. I would whisper to them that it
  would be safer for them to stay where they were at present, and that later I
  would come back and release them. Oh, what nonsense I am talking, to be
  sure!"</p>

  <p>The smoker affirmed this in a manner non too complimentary.</p>

  <p>"You are without exception the wildest sentimentalist I ever came across.
  You are trying my patience a bit too much. Why don't you go about your
  business and leave me to mine?"</p>

  <p>The woman laughed softly to herself as if she was half amused by her own
  secret thoughts. She did not seem to notice, or perhaps she wanted to ignore
  the brutal outspokenness of her companion. For some reason or other it
  occurred to the listeners that she was trying to gain time. At any rate,
  there was no longer room for doubt that she was doing her best to warn the
  listeners.</p>

  <p>"Can you make nothing of her features?" Jack asked eagerly. "My eyes are
  pretty keen, as a rule, but I can discern no more than the shimmering outline
  of her dress. If fortune is on our side, presently, we must follow her and
  ascertain where she lives."</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't be at all a bad move," Rigby said. "She may be a
  sentimentalist, a poet into the bargain, but that does not prevent her from
  being an exceedingly clever woman. She is deceiving that bullying fellow in a
  way that is worthy of the best diplomatist."</p>

  <p>"She is going to speak again," Jack whispered. "What did she say? I quite
  failed to get the last sentence."</p>

  <p>Rigby replied that he had failed to catch it, too, for the words were
  spoken in low tones which did not carry to the window above. The man laughed
  in the same brutal fashion, and begged the woman begone, as she was only a
  hindrance there.</p>

  <p>"I am going," she said. "Take care of yourself, Richard, and don't imagine
  that Anstruther is likely to be of much use to you when the time of danger
  comes. He has ever been the blighting curse that hangs over us, and something
  tells me that he will be your curse a well as ours."</p>

  <p>The man laughed scornfully. He didn't seem to be afraid.</p>

  <p>"Evidently that woman is a very great deal cleverer than my friend gives
  her credit for," said Rigby. "Don't you see that she was talking to us? Her
  speech was merely kind of parable. I don't know who she is or whence she
  derives an inspiration, but one thing I am absolutely certain
about&mdash;she knows
  perfectly that the pair of us are locked in this room, and she is equally
  aware of the fact of our identity. All we have do to do now is to smoke a
  cigarette each and quietly wait till our fair friend comes and effects our
  release."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any idea who she is?" Jack asked. "At any rate, there is
  nothing common about her. She speaks like a lady, and is most assuredly
  dressed like one."</p>

  <p>"I should think" you were more likely to know that than I," said Rigby.
  "Whoever that woman is, or whatever gang of scoundrels she is mixed up with,
  it is quite evident that she knows Miss Helmsley well, and that she is a
  great friend of hers, You must know surely pretty well the full extent of
  Claire Helmsley's acquaintances. Can't you recognize the voice? Does not the
  outline of her figure give you something to go on?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you have me there," Jack said. "You see, Anstruther is an
  exceedingly popular man, he goes a great deal into society, and naturally
  Claire generally accompanies him. She could not have less than a hundred
  acquaintances she has made in this way."</p>

  <p>"Then you can't help me out in this way?" Rigby asked.</p>

  <p>Jack was emphatically of the opinion that he could not. He ran his mind
  over a score or two of Claire's most cherished acquaintances. But not one of
  them tallied in the least degree with the lady down below. Besides, the
  darkness rendered an actual recognition almost impossible.</p>

  <p>All the friends had to do now was to possess their souls in patience and
  await the time when their mysterious friend could come to their assistance.
  That she would come they felt absolutely certain. She might have been the
  wild, sentimental creature which the man with the cigar had called her, but,
  at the same time, she had both coolness and courage, or she would not have
  hit upon the ingenious method of speaking indirectly to them as she had
  done.</p>

  <p>"Unless I am greatly mistaken," Rigby said thoughtfully, "we are going to
  make a real useful friend here. What is that I see down below? Surely there
  is something like a carriage driven into the yard."</p>

  <p>Surely enough, it was a vehicle of some kind, painted black, and with not
  too much glittering varnish about it. So far as could be seen in the gloom,
  the conveyance in question was a brougham of some kind. It came into the yard
  with a strange suggestion of ghostliness about it, for the tires were thickly
  coated with rubber; the horse itself appeared to be similarly shod.</p>

  <p>"I fancy we have seen something like that before," Jack suggested
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"Right you are." Rigby responded. "Of course, one can't be quite
  absolutely sure, but that looks very like the vehicle used by those people
  the other night. You know what I mean&mdash;the brougham I saw used by the
deaf
  mute and her companions the night we ran against one another at
  Carrington's."</p>

  <p>"Right beyond the shadow of a doubt," Jack said. "Who is this mystic
  conveyance for. I wonder&mdash;the man or the woman?"</p>

  <p>Evidently it was for the woman, for she stood with her long wrap fastened
  closely about her whilst the man with the cigar opened the door. The horse
  was turned round, and vanished as it had come, without the slightest noise.
  Indeed, whole thing might have been a figment of the imagination.</p>

  <p>"I hope that does not mean that our last chance has gone," Rigby
  suggested. "But we must have faith in our fair friend. One thing is pretty
  certain. If she means to come to our assistance she is not going very far
  away."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; NOSTALGO AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was silence for some time between the friends. They
  had speculated as far as possible on the chances of the future, and now there
  was no more to be said. At the same time, the situation was not devoid of
  elements of interest, seeing that the man with the cigar had not as yet
  departed. Evidently he was waiting for somebody, for he lighted a fresh cigar
  from the stump of his old one, and sat down on the edge of the fountain with
  the air of a man who knows how to possess his soul in patience. He sat thus
  for some time; then he stood up at length with an air of strained attention
  and gave a grunt of relief. Out of the shadows there emerged another man,
  muffled to the eyes and wearing a big slouch hat upon his head.</p>

  <p>"So you have come at last," the man with the cigar muttered. "I thought
  you were going to keep me here all night."</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you," the newcomer said. "You can walk about the
  world with your head held up; you have no occasion to hide yourself from the
  light of day. If only this business was done and over, you would never find
  me in one of Anstruther's schemes again."</p>

  <p>There was something exceedingly striking in the voice of the speaker; it
  was by no means an unmusical voice; the enunciation was clear and defined.
  But there was a peculiar rasping ring in it, a jarring, metallic discord as
  if some one had struck two plates of steel together. It was a commanding
  voice, too, and the man with the cigar seemed to feel it.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know your own business best," he muttered in a tone which
  was plainly intended to be that of an apology. "Funny thing, isn't it, that
  you and I should be conspiring here, within a pistol shot of Shannon Street
  Police Station? Those chaps yonder are still scratching heir heads over the
  disappearance of the man they call Nostalgo."</p>

  <p>The other man laughed; his voice rang as an echo rings in a cave. He
  laughed again a little more gently.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "we could throw a very blinding light on that mystery.
  Have they offered any reward for the discovery of the body?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, yes," the other man chuckled. "Two hundred pounds and a free
  pardon to any accomplice not actually connected with the outrage. Wouldn't it
  be a fine thing to earn that reward?"</p>

  <p>"I'll think it over and see if we can't manage it," said the newcomer.
  "Fancy hoodwinking the police in that way! All the same, I don't quite like
  this reward business; it's just the thing to appeal to that scoundrel
  Redgrave. Anstruther never made a greater mistake when he took Redgrave into
  his confidence. That fellow would do anything for a few hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"Well, you will have an opportunity of sounding him presently. He is
  coming to see you about those West African bonds. As for myself, I have
  business of greatest importance in the East End. I only stayed here till you
  came because Anstruther said it was absolutely imperative for you to have
  these papers to-night."</p>

  <p>So saying, the speaker took a small packet from his pocket and handed it
  over to his companion. He turned away, and a moment later had vanished into
  the night. The sole remaining man appeared to be restless and ill at ease. As
  he paced up and down the ragged and deserted fore-court the two friends,
  cautiously peeping through the up-stairs window, could see that he was lame
  and that one shoulder was higher than the other. He was muttering to himself,
  too, in some foreign language that conveyed nothing to the listeners.</p>

  <p>He came to a pause presently, and, fumbling in his long coat, produced a
  cigarette case and a box of matches.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I really dare," he muttered, this time speaking in English
  slightly flavored with a foreign accent. "Surely no one can see me; surely I
  shall be safe in this well of a place. If only I could manage without
  matches."</p>

  <p>Bat there has been no way yet invented of lighting tobacco without
  matches. As the match flared out the stranger's face was picked out clean and
  clear against the velvet background of the night. As if in full enjoyment of
  his tobacco, the man threw his head back and filled his lungs with the
  fragrant smoke. He had not yet dropped the match, so that its rays caught
  full the upturned face. So clearly did the face stand out that the whole
  action might have been conceived with the idea of giving the watchers a
  perfect view of it.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?" Jack whispered excitedly. "Don't ask me to
  say, because I know the man as well I I know my own father. The point is, do
  you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that everybody in London does," Rigby responded, "seeing
  that the face has been glaring down on London for the past two months. Yonder
  man is Nostalgo and none other."</p>

  <p>"No mistake about that," Jack said. "In that strange, weird light, what an
  awful face it is. And yet there is something about it, too, same
  half-pathetic suggestion that almost removes one's feelings of
  repulsion."</p>

  <p>"I have noticed that too," Rigby said. "But why did you not tell me that
  our mysterious friend was practically a hunchback?"</p>

  <p>"But he wasn't," Jack protested. "I am absolutely certain that the man I
  found apparently dead close to Panton Square three nights ago was as straight
  and well set up as you or I. Why, I helped to put him in the ambulance; I saw
  his body laid out in the mortuary at Shannon Street police station. I am
  prepared to swear that the man was without a physical blemish, and I am quite
  sure that Inspector Bates will bear me out in this. And yet that man down
  there smoking his cigarette is as misshapen as Richard III."</p>

  <p>As to this point there was no question. The man below was pacing quietly
  up and down the fore-court in the full enjoyment of his cigarette, and little
  heeding the curious watchers overhead. It was easy to see that, so far as
  physical development was concerned, he had been but ill-favored by fortune.
  One leg was considerably longer than the other, causing the fellow to shuffle
  along with a sideways motion not unlike that of a crab.</p>

  <p>"Unless that fellow is a bold contortionist, we have evidently two
  Nostalgos to deal with," Rigby said thoughtfully "And yet it seems impossible
  there can be two faces like that in the world. One thing is pretty
  certain&mdash;the supposed dead body you conveyed to Shannon Street police
station
  the other night must have been very much alive. If we could only get away
  from here to follow him."</p>

  <p>"Not much occasion to trouble about that, I am thinking," Jack said. "This
  man is evidently a tool or accomplice 3 of Anstruther's. I am certain we
  shall see him in Panton Square sooner or later. As to the man Redgrave they
  were speaking about just now, I happen to know all about him. He used to be
  in Anstruther's employ as a kind of secretary&mdash;a clever, well-educated
fellow
  whose weakness was drink. Ha, here comes another one."</p>

  <p>Surely enough, another figure crept into the fore-court. Nostalgo, if he
  it was, paid no heed to the stranger for a moment or two. In a half-timid
  fashion the man who had just entered the fore-court bowed to his misshapen
  companion and intimated that he awaited his pleasure. Nostalgo turned upon
  him with a snarl.</p>

  <p>"So they have sent you, after all," he said. His clear, ringing voice
  vibrated with contempt. "Is this the best thing Anstruther can do at a
  critical moment like this? I want a man, not a miserable coward like you.
  Besides, I do not trust you. I never shall trust you again." And, unless I am
  greatly mistaken, you have been drinking."</p>

  <p>"We are in luck again," Jack whispered. "That is the very man I spoke
  about&mdash; Redgrave in the flesh. Are we going to learn anything, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer protested whiningly that not one drop of ardent liquor had
  passed his lips that day.</p>

  <p>"You miserable, prevaricating hound!" Nostalgo cried. "Go back to
  Anstruther and say that I will have none of you. Tell your master that my
  time is short and that an hour from now will make all the difference. He
  knows that I dare not stay: he knows what hideous disaster even the slightest
  delay may produce; and yet he sends you of all men to help me in this
  crisis."</p>

  <p>"But Anstruther cannot possibly do anything else." Redgrave whined. "It is
  absolutely imperative that he should be at Carrington's by midnight.
  Carrington is not to be trusted: he wants watching as carefully as a cat
  watches a mouse. You will have to put up with me, sir."</p>

  <p>Nostalgo paced up and down the dreary fore-court with the air of a man who
  is deep in thought. His limp and straggling gait was by no means lost upon
  the watchers overhead. He came to a halt at length and sat down on the edge
  of the broken fountain, his head upon his hands, He might have been a graven
  statue, so rigid and still was his figure.</p>

  <p>The effect of this upon the cowering, watching Redgrave was peculiar.
  There was something of the cat in his own movements as he came inch by inch
  nearer Nostalgo. It was as if a child was timidly to a dog of uncertain
  temper. Nearer and nearer Redgrave came, till he was standing directly over
  the bent figure of hid companion. He might have been miles away for all the
  heed that Nostalgo gave him.</p>

  <p>Then quick as thought, and with a snarling, savage cry that echoed
  strangely between the four walls of the fore-court, Redgrave fell furiously
  and with headlong impetuosity upon the doubled-up figure of his prey.</p>

  <p>"I have got you now, you misshapen devil!" he screamed. "You are going to
  be worth at least &pound;200 to me to-night."</p>

  <p>Utterly taken by surprise, Nostalgo collapsed under the sudden and furious
  assault. Something gleamed and flashed in the uncertain light, and the
  horrified onlookers from the window above saw that Redgrave had a knife in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"You poisonous scoundrel!" Rigby yelled . "Drop it, I say&mdash;drop it,
or it
  will be worse for you."</p>

  <p>But Rigby might have be have been speaking to the wind. He yelled again
  and again, but the two men below, locked in a deadly embrace, did not appear
  to heed; indeed, it was more than probable that they could hear nothing at
  all.</p>

  <p>More by great good fortune than anything else. Nostalgo had managed to
  grip the hand that held the knife and was holding it in a tenacious clutch.
  Over and over the pair rolled, like two hungry dogs fighting for a bone,
  their clothes torn and mud-stained, their features grimed almost beyond
  recognition. It was a grim and gruesome sight to the two eager watchers. A
  sense of helplessness, a wild desire to do something was upon them; but they
  might just a well have been fettered prisoners for all the use they were.</p>

  <p>"If only we could open this door," Rigby sighed passionately. "If only
  that mysterious lady could come to our assistance."</p>

  <p>It was like a prayer that was answered. There was a click, a sudden wide
  swinging open of the door, and the lady in evening dress came headlong into
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Quickly, quickly!" she panted. "Oh, it does not matter who I am or where
  I came from! If you would not have the destruction of a man's soul on your
  conscience, come with me at once."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; LADY BARMOUTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">QUICK as the whole thing had been, the action on the part of
  the fair stranger had not taken Rigby by surprise. He had half expected some
  development of this kind; he was ready for the dramatic moment, and took full
  advantage of it. Almost before the lady was in the room he had applied a
  match to the gas burner and turned it full on. There was a sudden flashing
  vision of some one magnificently attired, for the white diaphanous dress and
  the gleaming diamonds showed where her wrap had parted at the neck. Perhaps
  she dimly comprehended the significance of Rigby's maneuver, for she turned
  somewhat scornfully from the hissing gad jet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there is no time for that!" she cried. "It can matter little or
  nothing who I am. at any rate for the present. Did you follow me just now? I
  hope you understood that I was speaking to you."</p>

  <p>"We gathered that, madam," Rigby said politely; "but really we are wasting
  time in in idle compliments."</p>

  <p>The stranger's face fairly beamed in gratitude. She turned and pointed in
  the direction of the door. There was no need whatever for further words; the
  friends knew exactly what she wanted.</p>

  <p>The gesture was eloquent enough. The lady who had so strangely and
  unexpectedly come to the assistance of the pair intimated to them as plainly
  as words could speak that there was no time to be lost, and that the sooner
  they were off the premises the better. Jack did not wish to delay: he had no
  desire to caught like a rat in a trap, nor for a moment did he forget the
  fact that the woman who spoke in parables had risked much to come to their
  assistance. On the other hand Rig by, being calmer and more collected than
  his friend and, like a journalist, more prone to go into details, was
  disposed to linger for explanations. His hesitation was by no means lost on
  the fair stranger. Once more she pointed to the door, this time with an
  imperious gesture.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why do you hesitate?" she murmured. "Why do you stand like a
  schoolboy staring into a shop window? I know you are here for some desperate
  purpose; I can more than guess the reason for your visit. You are men of
  intellect and understanding, therefore you must clearly see the danger of
  even an instant's delay."</p>

  <p>The lady turned away as if she had finished. Jack might have found it in
  his heart to be a little ashamed of Rigby, but, after all, the temptation to
  give way to curiosity was absolutely overwhelming. Jack pulled himself
  together at length, and dragged angrily at Rigby's arm. He felt just a little
  inclined to flush under the contemptuous gaze of their beautiful rescuer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do come along," he said. "My dear Dick, you are positively guilty of
  bad taste in this matter."</p>

  <p>"Really, I beg your pardon." Rigby said humbly. "But you can quite
  understand my feelings. Good-night, madam."</p>

  <p>Despite the wild hurry-scurry and the excitement of the moment, Jack had
  not failed to notice the exquisite beauty of the strange woman's face. She
  was quite young, about 25 or thereabouts, and yet her fair face, without a
  hint of a wrinkle in it, had a suggestion of the Madonna, as of one who had
  suffered much. She flew down the stairs, heedless of the darkness, and into
  the fore-court beyond.</p>

  <p>"Pray to heaven we are not too late," she said. "It seemed to me just now
  that I was barely in time, but surely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The woman stopped, and passed a hand across her face just as one does who
  wakes from an evil dream. And forsooth she had cause enough for her
  astonishment. Where two bodies had been locked in a death struggle a minute
  before, only one remained now. The other had vanished utterly. And it needed
  only a cursory glance to see that the form lying there was not the misshapen
  outline of Nostalgo.</p>

  <p>"This is amazing," the fair stranger said, as she bent over the body of
  the unconscious man. She did not appear to be the least afraid now; all her
  coolness had come back to her: she suggested a trained nurse on the
  battlefield.</p>

  <p>"Surely my eyes did not deceive me? Surely I saw two men in a death
  struggle there as I came into the courtyard?"</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest doubt about that," Jack murmured. "Why, we
  were actually watching the fight at the very moment you opened the door. Do
  you know who this fellow is?"</p>

  <p>The lady shook her head, but Jack noticed that she did not repudiate all
  knowledge of the stricken man.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you if you want to know," she said, "but we can discuss that
  point later on. What we want to know now is how far this man has suffered
  from his injuries."</p>

  <p>Heedless of the dust and dirt, heedless of her resplendent attire, the
  lady had thrown herself on her knees beside the prostrate body. She laid her
  hand upon his heart and bent her head down, listening intently.</p>

  <p>"At all events he is not dead," she said, "neither can I see any sign of a
  wound. He has evidently been stunned by some tremendous blow. Ah! see, he
  stirs."</p>

  <p>The injured man opened his eyes in a feeble, spasmodic kind of way and
  gazed languidly about him. Rigby, fully alert to the possibilities of the
  situation, grasped Jack by the arm.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he exclaimed, "You say you know that man, and naturally
  he knows you. Do you think it wise to remain in sight, and thus give him
  chance to recognize you?"</p>

  <p>Redgrave lay as if lost to all consciousness once more. Despite her
  dreamy. Madonna-like face, the strange lady was not blind to the danger of
  the situation.</p>

  <p>"I think you are quite right." she whispered hurriedly. "It would never do
  for this man to recognize you. I feel sure that heaven has sent you both to
  be my friends in the hour of my deepest despair. Who and what I am can be
  explained presently. Rut that man is coming to very fast, and it were far
  better if he did not see you."</p>

  <p>Rigby nodded his emphatic approval. Together with Jack he withdrew behind
  the shelter of a clump of bushes where it was possible to hear everything
  without being seen. Meanwhile Redgrave had raised himself to a sitting
  position, and, with his back to the fountain, was stupidly contemplating the
  fair figure before him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you can understand what I have said to you?" the lady asked.
  "For instance, you can tell me what brings you here to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I dare say I could if I liked," Redgrave groaned, "but I am not going to
  do anything of the kind. This comes of having women mixed up in a business
  like ours."</p>

  <p>"Woman or not, that has nothing to do with your murderous assault on a
  harmless stranger just now. It is absurd for you to deny any knowledge of it.
  You have heard of Lady Barmouth before."</p>

  <p>Behind the shelter of the bushes Jack gripped Rigby's arm significantly.
  He had learned something now.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" he whispered. "Of course you have heard of Lady
  Barmouth often enough. I have never met her myself, but I have often heard
  Claire speak about her. A beautiful South American girl, I believe, married
  to a sulky brute who never goes outside his house from one year's end to
  another. I don't know whether he drinks or what it is. hut I fear that Lady
  Barmouth has a very bad time of it."</p>

  <p>Jack would have probably volunteered more information on this point, only
  the cross-examination of Redgrave had begun again, and he did not wish to
  miss a word that he said.</p>

  <p>"It is idle to prevaricate with me," Lady Barmouth was saying. "I will ask
  you nothing as to your late encounter because it is evident that you had
  greatly the worst of it, and that your would-be victim has escaped. But what
  is more to the point, I want to know what has become of my brother?"</p>

  <p>"Your brother," Redgrave stammered as if utterly taken aback by the
  suddenness of the question. "I&mdash;I don't know in the least what you
mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what is the use of wasting your time and mine like this?" Lady
  Barmouth cried. "My brother came here by special appointment to meet Mr.
  Spencer Anstruther, and I came on my own self-initiative to see what my
  brother was doing."</p>

  <p>Here was fresh information for Jack and his companion. It mattered little
  for the present who Lady Barmouth's brother was, but evidently she had
  greatly mistrusted him; hence her appearance in the courtyard to-night. It
  was, therefore, by no means difficult for the friends to guess that the
  aforesaid brother had been the man who had so lately accused Lady Barmouth of
  being a sentimental fool. The night's work was being by no means wasted.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing whatever about your brother," Redgrave said sulkily, "and
  I know nothing about Anstruther either. The man who was here just
now&mdash;the man
  who made that murderous attack on me, I mean&mdash;was a perfect stranger.
But this
  is no place for a lady like you; you had better go home, and keep out of this
  sort of a scrape for the future."</p>

  <p>So saying, Redgrave scrambled painfully to his feet and lurched off in the
  direction of the doorway leading to the lane beyond. It was only when they
  were satisfied that he had absolutely departed, that RIgby and Masefield
  emerged from their hiding place and joined Lady Barmouth. There was a sad,
  wistful expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"You heard all that." she said! "Mind you, I am assuming that you are no
  parties to the vile conspiracy of which Anstruther is the head. I should like
  to have your assurance on that point before I proceed any further."</p>

  <p>"If there's one man in the world whom we desire to expose and render
  harmless for the future, it is Spencer Anstruther. Jack said vehemently. "But
  how did you know we were here at all?"</p>

  <p>"Because I happened to be in the house when you came." Lady Barmouth
  explained. "I caught sight of your face as you moved in front of the light
  proceeding from that room upstairs, and I divined by a sort of instinct that
  you did not belong to Anstruther's gang. Then it came to me that I had seen
  one of you gentlemen before in the company of Miss Helmsley. I think, sir, I
  may be pardoned if I assume that Miss Helmsley is something more than a
  friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly candid with you, we are engaged to be married, only it is
  a profound secret at present," Jack explained. "After telling you so much, I
  think you might be equally candid with us."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I will," Lady Barmouth exclaimed. "Any one to whom Claire Helmsley
  has given her heart must be a good and true man. As I told you just now I saw
  you on the stairs; I also heard what that strange man said about there being
  spies in the house. I saw you creep into the room, and I saw Anstruther lock
  the door upon you. The rest your know for yourselves&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But that does not explain why you are here," Rigby ventured to
  suggest.</p>

  <p>"Why I am here to-night, I cannot even tell you," Lady Barmouth said in
  low, nervous tones. "The secret is not mine; it concerns one I love more than
  anybody else in the world. One thing I can tell you: Claire Helmsley is in
  great danger so long as she remains where she is living now. You must get her
  away, Mr. Masefield; you must get her away at any cost!"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded gravely; he had not been blind to this danger for some time.
  What he wanted to know now was if Lady Barmouth had any idea of the identity
  of the man who had successfully got the better of Redgrave. But on that head
  Lady Barmouth could say nothing; she had returned for the express purpose of
  relieving Masefield and Rigby from their awkward situation, and in so doing
  she had come quite unexpectedly upon the combatants. Even in the dim light
  she had seen that a murderous struggle was taking place, and this being so,
  had hastened headlong upstairs with a view of securing assistance. More than
  this she could not possibly say.</p>

  <p>"What we want to do," Rigby suggested, "is to go away quietly somewhere
  and discuss this matter thoroughly. I need not point out to your ladyship the
  manifest danger of staying here. Anstruther or any of his tribe may be back
  at any time, and then we shall be caught like rats in a trap."</p>

  <p>"That matter is easily settled," Lady Barmouth replied. "Could you come
  home with me? It is by no means late yet, and you would not be long in
  getting rid of those disguises of yours. They are excellent disguises, but
  they did not prevent me recognizing you, Mr. Masefield."</p>

  <p>"There is no deceiving a clever woman," Jack smiled. "I should like
  nothing better than a chance to discuss this matter at length&mdash;but Lord
  Barmouth? Would he not think it somewhat singular that two strangers like
  ourselves&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," Lady Barmouth cried eagerly. "My husband never goes
  outside the house; he is suffering from a trouble so terrible that I try not
  to think of it if I can. I may, however tell you that his trouble is
  intimately connected with the black business that brings us here to-night. It
  may seem to you that I am a mere frivolous society butterfly. Ah! If you only
  knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The trio had worked their way into the street by this time. A private
  hansom stood a little way down the road. Lady Barmouth smiled a little as she
  contemplated her two companions.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we should be a suspicious-looking party in the eyes of a
  passing policeman," she said. "No, I think it would be just as well if I
  walked to my hansom alone. Then you can go back to your rooms and attire
  yourselves as English gentlemen should be attired at this time of the
  evening. Then you can come to my house. I will tell the servants I am
  expecting two friends to supper. You know the address?"</p>

  <p>Jack intimated that he knew the address perfectly well. The suggestion was
  by no means a bad one; there could be no possible suspicion aroused by the
  fact that Lady Barmouth was having two friends to share her late meal. The
  clocks were striking twelve as Jack and his companion walked up the steps of
  the big house in Belgrave Square.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; THE BOSOM OF HER FAMILY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A RESPLENDENT footman took the names of the callers, and
  preceded them to the drawing room. It was no uncommon thing for Lady Barmouth
  to invite a score or so of friends to supper after a reception or theater.
  The footman intimated that his mistress was alone now, and that she was at
  present in the hands of her maid; therefore the callers had ample time to
  study the surroundings of so mysterious a person as Lord Barmouth.</p>

  <p>That remarkable man, as everybody knew, had only been married a little
  over two years. Two years ago he himself had been a more or less popular
  figure in society. In the first place he was exceedingly rich, by no means
  ill-looking; in fact he was a remarkably fine, type of an all-round athlete.
  He was a triple blue at Oxford, a wonderfully keen shot, and a dashing polo
  player. At his house in the Shires his hunters were noted, as likewise were
  his coverts. Two years, ago any man would have esteemed it a privilege to
  call himself Lord Barmouth's friend, and be free of his guns and his horses.
  But now all this was changed. Barmouth had gone away to South America with a
  view of something new in the way of sport. Naturally his movements were
  followed carefully by the society papers. They chronicled all his doings
  faithfully, and presently Belgravia was officially formed of the fact that
  Barmouth was in Mexico, where he had become engaged to be married to the
  daughter of a settler there&mdash;an Englishman of good family who had taken
unto
  himself a Mexican wife. Three months later the announcement of Barmouth's
  marriage was in <i>The Times</i>. It was understood that he was not coming
  home quite yet; indeed, something like two years elapsed before the big house
  in Belgrave Square was set in order for the owner and his bride.</p>

  <p>The strange whisperings and muttered scandal began at once. But on one
  point society was in perfect accord&mdash;whatever trouble hung over the
  household, it could not possibly be a fault of Lady Barmouth's. The woman was
  a lady to her finger-tips; she took her part naturally and easily in society;
  she fell into her place like one to the manner born. As everybody expected,
  there was nothing lacking in the lavish hospitality which had always been a
  tradition of the Barmouths. Men went down to their country houses in the
  winter to shoot and hunt, men and women came to Belgrave Square to lunch and
  dance and dinner&mdash;there was no more popular figure in society than Lady
  Barmouth.</p>

  <p>And there it seemed to end. From the day of his arrival in England until
  the present moment not a soul had looked upon Lord Barmouth with the
  exception of his wife and his faithful valet. What was the source of the
  trouble nobody knew, and nobody guessed. It was in vain to try to bribe any
  of the servants, for they were just as much in the dark as anybody else. It
  was perhaps a mistake to say that nobody had ever seen Lord Barmouth, for
  occasionally he entered the dining or drawing-rooms when some very old
  friends were there, but previous to his entry the lights were always turned
  out. Whether this was due to some strange form of disease, or perhaps some
  phase of madness, was a point never explained. Lady Barmouth, beyond a cold
  statement that her husband was suffering from a peculiar malady, said
  nothing, and, indeed, it would have been in very bad taste to have asked. It
  had only been a nine days' wonder after all, and it mattered little to
  society in general so long as the hospitality of the house of Barmouth did
  not suffer.</p>

  <p>It was under the roof of a man like this that Rigby and Jack found
  themselves as a fitting end to a night of amazing adventure. There was
  nothing to denote a discordant spirit in the house. Here was a magnificent
  suite of drawing-rooms brilliantly lighted and luxurious to a degree, on the
  walls of which were pictures of price. There was about the house the
  decorous, smooth, velvety silence which seems to be a tradition in all
  well-ordered establishments. It seemed almost impossible to believe that the
  sinister wing of tragedy should hang over a home like this. A few moments
  later Lady Barmouth came into the room.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have kept you waiting," she said, "but I have been having a
  little chat with my husband. As I have already intimated to you, his
  misfortunes are not altogether unconnected with this Anstruther business. My
  dear husband has suffered cruelly at the hands of certain people; indeed, so
  cruelly has be suffered that he seems to have lost all life and hope
  altogether. Ah, if you had only seen him as I saw him for the first time two
  years ago! There is one thing, however, I will ask you to do&mdash;pray do
  not say a word to him as to the circumstances in which we met to-night."</p>

  <p>"Then we are to have the pleasure of seeing Lord Barmouth," Jack
  exclaimed. "I quite understood that he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is an exceptional case altogether. In the strict sense of the word
  you will not see my husband, but he desires the privilege of a few words with
  you. Now, let us go into the dining-room and talk this matter over. There
  will be no servants present&mdash;it is the one meal of the day which I
prefer to
  partake of without the presence of one's domestics."</p>

  <p>The dining-room was not the usual apartment devoted to state feasts, but a
  small room on the first floor, cosily and comfortably furnished, and more
  with an eye to confidences than anything else. The servants were absent, as
  Lady Barmouth had intimated, so that it was possible to discuss the events of
  the evening without the chance of being overheard.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me candidly," Lady Barmouth said at length, "have you any ideas
  to offer as to that mysterious disappearance from Shannon Street police
  station? I am asking you this, Mr. Masefield, because it was you who actually
  found the body of the man who most people speak of as Nostalgo. Really now,
  was that unfortunate man so very like the wonderful poster of which London
  has had so much to say of late?"</p>

  <p>"The likeness was amazing," Jack explained. "It quite frightened me.
  Talking about the poster in question, there is another likeness that I have
  not failed to note. Of course, if you put the man I mean and the poster side
  by side, nobody could possibly see the resemblance. But in moments of anger,
  there is a strong likeness between the poster, and Spencer Anstruther. Don't
  laugh at me, Lady Barmouth; I assure you it is absolutely true."</p>

  <p>But Lady Barmouth was by no means in the way of laughing at Masefield. Her
  pale face took on a still more creamy pallour, the pupils of her dark eyes
  were strangely dilated.</p>

  <p>"That is a most strange and wonderful thing," she said, as if speaking to
  herself. "Mr. Masefield, it is most fortunate that we met to-night. You have
  just told me something which will prove of the utmost value later on. We will
  not discuss that now, there is no time. But there is one thing that I am
  going to ask you to do for me; I want you to influence Claire Helmsley in my
  favor. I have taken a great fancy to her; indeed, I like her far more than
  any girl in London. This is all the stranger because I believe I am in a
  position to do her a great service. I know that I am in a position to do her
  one. But one stipulation I make, and that is&mdash;she must be told
  everything."</p>

  <p>Jack hesitated. It would be indeed a dangerous thing to acquaint Claire
  with all that had happened so long as she was under the same roof as Spencer
  Anstruther. She was not accustomed to restrain her feelings and emotions, and
  with his swift, subtle instincts, Anstruther would find out that there was
  something wrong immediately. Jack pointed this out to Lady Barmouth at some
  length.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," she said thoughtfully. "Claire is a clever girl, she
  is in splendid health, and not the least likely to fear Anstruther or anybody
  else. It is, of course, not nice to have to play a part, but think of the
  information that Claire could glean for us so long as Anstruther regards her
  as little more than a child and behaves to her accordingly."</p>

  <p>"Believe me, I am only too anxious to get at the bottom of this dreadful
  business," Jack said earnestly, "and there is nobody more anxious than I am
  to get Claire outside the sphere of Anstruther's influence altogether. Still,
  I am quite willing to try. I will see Claire to-morrow, and tell her
  everything."</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth's face beamed with a delight that was almost childish. She
  looked and acted like one who had had a great weight taken off her mind. That
  Jack had come to a wise decision she felt certain. She was saying so,
  speaking very briskly and freely, when the lights of the room were
  extinguished by some invisible agency and the apartment left in utter
  darkness save for the wood-fire which smouldered on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"I do hope you have all finished," Lady Barmouth cried . "It is quite
  evident that my husband thinks so, or the lights would not have been
  extinguished by turning off the switch outside the door."</p>

  <p>Both Jack and Rigby muttered something to the effect that they had
  finished. Lady Barmouth produced a tiny silver spirit lamp from the
  sideboard, the blue flame of which was little larger than a pin's point,
  sufficient to light a cigarette, but insufficient to illuminate a scrap of
  paper a foot away. In silence the cigarettes were handed around, and the
  well-trained voice of a servant was heard announcing Lord Barmouth. A closely
  muffled figure crept into the room, and proceeded to bury itself in a big
  arm-chair by the side of the wood-fire.</p>

  <p>"These are my friends, Mr. Rigby and Mr. Masefield," Lady Barmouth said
  cheerfully . "I have told them that you would like to have a few words with
  them, George. You will find these gentlemen willing to speak quite
  freely.</p>

  <p>"That is indeed good of you." The deep, clear ringing voice came from the
  fire-place. "I have been praying for something like this for the last twelve
  months. Still, it is more with Mr. Masefield than Mr. Rigby that I wish to
  speak. You have made a great discovery to-night, I understand. You have found
  out the source of those Nostalgo posters."</p>

  <p>"I think I have done more than that," Jack explained. "I have not only
  discovered their source, but I know where they are printed, and the process
  of their manufacture. If you like to put yourself in my hands and accompany
  me to-morrow night, you shall see the whole scheme for yourself."</p>

  <p>Lord Barmouth was of the opinion that it was not wise in the circumstances
  to take any such step. He cross-examined Jack at considerable length, his
  questions being pointed with marked intelligence.</p>

  <p>At the same time he said little or nothing about himself. Lady Barmouth
  sat there smiling behind the cover of the darkness, infinitely glad to see
  her husband taking an interest in the affairs of life once more.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it is rather late to-night?" she suggested; "besides, we
  are going too fast. With your intimate knowledge of the situation, and with
  the help of these gentlemen, surely we can devise some scheme for getting the
  better of that fiend Anstruther."</p>

  <p>"Ay, you are right." Barmouth said, his deep voice ringing through the
  room. "I see a way now, a way as clear as daylight."</p>

  <p>In his passionate emotion he dashed his foot forward so that the point of
  his the logs in the grate. A blue flame spurted up and died as suddenly as it
  had come. Jack and Rigby rose to leave. No sooner were they outside than Jack
  clutched his companion's arm eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Did you see nothing?" Jack whispered. "By heaven, Lord Barmouth and the
  Nostalgo we saw in the fore-court to-night are one and the same person!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; WHICH MAN WAS IT?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RIGBY'S astonishment was frank and undisguised. It was quite
  evident that he had noticed nothing suspicious about the look or attitude of
  Lord Barmouth; indeed, he had been on the far side of the table when the
  master of the house had entered the room. But he was not altogether prepared
  to accept Jack's statement unless he could verify it with something more than
  a mere expression of opinion.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure of that?" he asked. "Mind you, this is an exceedingly
  important matter, and if what you say is true, we have opened up a quite
  fresh development of the mystery."</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely certain of it," Jack declared. "I had not the least idea
  of anything of the kind till we were both on our feet ready to go. It was at
  this point, you will remember, that Lord Barmouth displayed some feeling and
  accidentally touched the logs of wood on the fire with his foot. In the spurt
  of flame which followed I had a perfect view of his face."</p>

  <p>"Would you mind describing what you saw?" Rigby asked.</p>

  <p>"You have only to look at the nearest poster displaying the features of
  Nostalgo, and your question is answered. It was only a flash, but the face
  was impressed upon my mind in the most vivid fashion. There was the same
  sinister expression of face, the same repulsive twist of the mouth, the same
  inexpressible gleam of the eyes as we see it on half the hoardings in London.
  Of course, it is the face of a leering Mephistopheles. And yet I don't know;
  it occurred to me that there was something very pathetic and at the same time
  kind about Barmouth's aspect. You know what I mean: imagine a kind-hearted,
  good-natured actor made up as repulsively as possible, and with the
  suggestion of his natural disposition behind him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I fancy I understand what you mean," Rigby replied thoughtfully.
  "But you don't suggest that the man really was made up, do you?"</p>

  <p>Jack replied that he did and he did not. There was something unreal about
  Barmouth's mouth, and yet it was impossible to believe that that sinister
  face was anything except just as nature made it. The friends walked along
  side by side in silence before another idea occurred to Rigby.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that we must believe in the existence of two
  Nostalgos. The one you found in Panton Square was dead; indeed, the police
  sergeant testified to the fact. However, by what mysterious means that man's
  body was so mysteriously spirited away we are not very likely to find out. At
  any rate, it is quite fair to assume that his friends had some desperate
  reason for spiriting his body away. Therefore, we may logically infer that
  Lord Barmouth cannot possibly be the same man you saw in Panton Square."</p>

  <p>"That is a very fair assumption," Jack admitted. "But to carry your
  argument a bit further, we are bound to assume that there are no less than
  three Nostalgos. The suggestion is almost farcical, but there it is."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by three," Rigby asked.</p>

  <p>"Well don't forget the man we saw in the fore-court of the house in
  Montrose Place. No mistake about his being a Nostalgo."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Rigby admitted. "I am with you there. But how do we know for
  certain that Nostalgo No. 2, so to speak, and Lord Barmouth are not the same
  man? Did you notice anything strange about the appearance of Barmouth as he
  came into the room to-night&mdash;that he was humpbacked or misshapen in any
  way?"</p>

  <p>Jack was bound to admit that he had not noticed anything of the kind.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we shall ever do much good unless we go direct to the
  fountainhead," Jack said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Mexico." Rigby cried. "I see exactly what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Mexico it is. We know perfectly well that when Barmouth went off to
  Mexico two years ago on a sporting expedition he was a normal man like you
  and me. If be had been so terribly disfigured by birth or accident as he
  appeared to-night, we should have known it. A man in his position with an
  infirmity like that cannot hide it from the light of day. If we carry the
  thing to a logical conclusion, if Barmouth had been like that when he went
  away, why should he be so dreadfully troubled about it now?"</p>

  <p>Rigby applauded this sound reasoning. He could see that Jack had something
  on his mind, and urged him to proceed.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know what to make of it." Jack said. "As I observed just
  now, we seem to he face to face with the fact that there are two or three
  Nostalgos, and for all we know to the contrary, there may be a score more
  knocking about London. It has occurred to me more than once that these men
  must belong to some secret society."</p>

  <p>Rigby was inclined to laugh at the idea. On being asked by Jack to explain
  what he saw that was fatal to the theory, he replied logically enough that
  such a thing was out of the question.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, just think what you are saying." he exclaimed. "So far as
  my reading teaches me, the great object of a secret society is to be secret.
  Besides, you don't suggest for a moment that these men belong to any
  particular tribe, especially as we know perfectly well that Lord Barmouth,
  who is an Englishman, belongs to them. Nor would you want me to believe that
  these men are in the habit of having their faces operated upon by some
  ingenious doctor, so that they are in the position to recognize one another
  when they meet."</p>

  <p>Jack was bound to admit that Rigby had the facts entirely upon his side.
  It seemed absolutely childish to believe that sane men would do this kind of
  thing, especially when it was very evident that these various Nostalgos were
  only too anxious to hide themselves from the light of day. Rigby did not
  pursue his advantage; he was quite content to judge that his argument had
  prevailed from the expression of Jack's face.</p>

  <p>"But we need not carry that argument any further," he said. "I judge from
  your expression that you have another theory."</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to that." Jack said. We will assume for the sake of
  argument that when Barmouth went to Mexico he was without blemish of mind or
  body. That being so, he must have met with some terrible adventure which has
  resulted in this terrible disfigurement. Mind you, it is a disfigurement; it
  certainly is not natural; for instance, no three men could possibly have
  faces like that as the result of a freak of nature. What I am trying to think
  is this: Barmouth got mixed up in some in some hideous secret society, and
  that he either carries on his face the badge of the tribe, or he has been
  purposely disfigured out of revenge for some dereliction of duty. However,
  this is only speculation after all, and we can do nothing till we have some
  fresh facts before us."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to think very highly of your theory all the same," Rigby
  said. "There is no questioning the fact that we have to look toward Mexico
  for an elucidation of the mystery. By Jove, I have nearly forgotten
  something. Wouldn't it be a good thing to find out if Anstruther had ever
  been to Mexico?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it would," Jack exclaimed. "I'll see to that. I will go to
  Anstruther's to-morrow night and learn there. It will be hard indeed if I am
  unable to answer your question next time we meet."</p>

  <p>It was fairly late the following afternoon before Jack found himself in
  Panton Square again. He had practically promised Lady Barmouth to tell Claire
  everything, but a natural reflection had shown him that this was not quite
  prudent. Not that he objected to take Claire into his confidence, but what he
  greatly feared was the girl's inability to control her feelings in the
  presence of Anstruther after she had learned everything. But, as Jack looked
  into the face of his betrothed, his doubts gradually vanished. It was a
  courageous as well as a beautiful face, and it occurred to Jack that Lady
  Barmouth had not done badly when she had selected Claire to be her confidante
  in this painful matter. Claire's dark eyes were turned interrogatively upon
  her lover. Perhaps he was looking a little more seriously than usual&mdash;at
  any rate his grave face told her that he had come with news of
  importance.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, what is the matter?" Claire asked. She twined her hands
  about his arm and laid her head caressingly on his shoulder. It was
  impossible to resist that pleading upward glance "I am sure you have
  something important to say to me."</p>

  <p>"Against my better judgment," Jack laughed. "Yes, I am going to tell you
  something about your guardian."</p>

  <p>Claire listened with the deepest attention as Jack proceeded to speak
  freely of the adventures of the last two days, He watched the change of her
  face, the flush and the pallour, and the dawning resolution which gave her
  mouth strength and firmness.</p>

  <p>"I do not think you need be afraid for me." Claire said. "I will be brave
  and resolute: I will do my best to hide my my feelings from Mr. Anstruther.
  This is a dreadful business altogether, but dreadful as it is, we cannot draw
  back now. You have told me some strange things, but some of your facts are
  not facts at all.</p>

  <p>"In what way have I been mistaken?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, as to Mr. Anstruther, for instance. You say that you saw him at
  Montrose Place last night for the best part of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Well, so I did," Jack declared. "If you want anybody to prove that, ask
  Rigby. Anstruther was there somewhere about half-past ten, and when he left
  he had not the slightest intention of going home."</p>

  <p>"Most extraordinary," Claire murmured. "Listen to what I have to say, what
  I should have to swear to if this thing ever went into a court of justice.
  Shortly after dinner last night Spencer Anstruther went directly to his
  study; he had not been there very long before he was playing his violin, and
  this he continued to do till one o'clock this morning. Now what do you make
  of that?"</p>

  <p>"It seems almost incredible," Jack said. "Was there a break at all in the
  performance?"</p>

  <p>Claire replied that there was a break of perhaps twenty-five minutes to
  half an hour, so far as she could judge, somewhere about eleven o'clock. Jack
  smlled with the air of a man who makes a discovery. This was the period when
  Padini had turned up in Montrose Place. There was no time to go into theories
  now, but Jack felt that h e would have a surprise for his friends later
  on.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, tell me," he said, "do you think you can recollect the names of
  all the pieces that Anstruther played last night? I want you to try and
  repeat them to me exactly in the order that they occurred. This is more
  important than you would Imagine."</p>

  <p>It was a somewhat difficult task, but Claire managed it successfully at
  length. For a long time the girl bent thoughtfully over her writing table,
  and presently produced a neat list on which were inscribed the names of some
  ten or fifteen classical compositions.</p>

  <p>"I think you will find that practically correct." she said. "I may not
  have recollected the exact order, but I think that it is good enough for your
  purpose."</p>

  <p>Masefield was quite sure of the fact. He folded the list, and carefully
  placed it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Now there is one more thing I should like," he said. "Now, as you are
  perfectly well aware. Padini was giving a recital last night at the small
  Queen's Hall. You will remember this, more especially as your music agent
  sent you a programme, a thing he always does when there is anything of
  importance going on. Now, do you think you could find that programme for me?
  Not that it very much matters, because I can step 'round to Smithson's and
  get one for myself; still, if you happen to have it in the house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Claire was quite certain that she had the programme somewhere. She
  produced it presently from a mass of papers on the piano.</p>

  <p>"Now we shall get at it," Jack said. "I see by this programme that Padini
  is down for no less than six items. He had a most enthusiastic audience, as I
  happen to know, which really means that he played about twelve pieces
  altogether. Now I will read to you the first four of these compositions. They
  are respectively <i>&Eacute;tude</i> 25, Chopin; <i>Wiegenlied</i>, Brahms;
  Moszkowski's Five Waltzes; Liszt's <i>Die Lorelei</i>. Now, unless I am
  greatly mistaken, you will find that those pieces were played in the same
  order by Anstruther in his study last night. Is not that so?"</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" Claire cried. "Absolutely; it is exactly as you say. What does
  it mean?"</p>

  <p>"We will take the list right through till the end if you like." Jack
  replied. "The same thing will apply to both lists. Now, is it not an
  extraordinary thing that those two men should have gone through exactly the
  same programme, item by item, without the slightest variation? And all the
  time they were some two miles apart?"</p>

  <p>"It seems absolutely incapable of explanation," Claire cried .</p>

  <p>"Oh! the explanation will be simple enough when the time comes." Jack
  laughed; "but you will see for yourself that the thing is not quite finished.
  It is obvious enough that Padini's recital finished at about eleven, whereas
  you say that Anstruther went on till about one o'clock in the morning. The
  next business is to find out where Padini was playing so late&mdash;possibly
at a
  smoking concert or something of that kind. At any rate I am going to find
  out, and then I shall discover that the supplementary programme will be
  exactly the same as your list."</p>

  <p>"Is it some new science?" Claire asked, "some wonderful new discovery that
  Mr. Anstruther is perfecting before he submits it to the world?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," Jack said practically. "There is nothing occult here.
  And now I must go. I will see you at dinner."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THE EMPTY ROOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK went off, bent upon putting his discovery to the test
  There was not the slightest trouble in ascertaining where Padini had passed
  the hours between 11 and 1 of the previous evening. As Masefield had
  anticipated, the artist had been persuaded to lend his services to the
  Bohemia Clef Club, where he had been the lion of the evening. The fact Jack
  ascertained at the club itself, a musical member affording him all the
  information he desired. The previous night's talent had been of a very middle
  class nature, so that Padini had found himself in great request He had been
  exceedingly obliging, so Jack's informant said, and had practically played
  straight away for a couple of hours. Jack jotted down the names of the
  various items executed by Padini, and on comparing them with the list given
  him by Claire, found that they tallied exactly,</p>

  <p>"The plot thickens," he murmured as he walked rapidly away in the
  direction of <i>The Planet</i> office, there to lay his most recent
  discoveries before Rigby. "What an ingenious rascal we have to deal with, to
  be sure!"</p>

  <p>Rigby was emphatically of the same opinion. He did not see how it was
  possible to better Jack's suggestion that he should dine at Anstruther's that
  night and ascertain all he could as to Anstruther's past, and especially as
  to whether the latter had ever been in Mexico.</p>

  <p>"There is one little thing we have quite overlooked," Jack suggested as he
  rose to depart "We have got to get inside that study. Anstruther's game is to
  lock himself in and pretend that his violin soothes his mind and induces a
  proper train of thought. That's his story, of course. I have ascertained that
  Padini is doing nothing to-night, but that will not prevent the music going
  on all the same. Now if you could hit upon some scheme whereby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know exactly what you mean," Rigby said; "you want to see the inside of
  the study just at the critical moment. I think our game is to make a
  diversion outside. I'll just turn over the matter in my mind, and if I can
  see a really artistic way of doing it I will send you a telegram just before
  you go to dinner. The diversion, of course, will come from the outside of the
  house."</p>

  <p>Jack felt sure that the matter was quite safe in the capable hands of Dick
  Rigby. He was surer still when a little before 5 o'clock his landlady handed
  him a telegram containing just three words from Rigby. Before he slept that
  night Jack felt pretty sure that the secret of Anstruther's violin practice
  would be a secret from him no longer.</p>

  <p>It was hard work to keep his feelings under control, to sit in the drawing
  room before dinner was announced and exchange commonplaces with his brilliant
  host. Anstruther had rarely been in better form; he had the air and mien of a
  man with whom the world goes very well. Indeed, success seemed to stand out
  in big letters upon him. Usually Anstruther was a man of moods: to-night he
  was merely a society creature with apparently no heed of the morrow.</p>

  <p>If Jack had any misgivings on the subject of Claire's behavior towards her
  guardian, his uneasiness was speedily set at rest. The moat critical observer
  could not have detected the slightest jarring note. It was all the same
  through dinner&mdash;Anstruther monopolized most of the conversation, and
Claire
  followed every word with flattering attention. Dessert was on the table at
  length before Jack carefully led up the conversation to foreign travel. He
  had seen much of the world himself, so that there were several places of
  mutual interest to be discussed with Anstruther.</p>

  <p>"There is one part of the world, however." Jack said, as he carelessly
  peeled a peach, "that I have always been curious to see. I allude to the land
  of the Aztecs, those wonderful ruined cities of Mexico, of which we know so
  little and profess to know so much. Now, don't you think that those people
  must have been of an exceedingly high state of civilization?"</p>

  <p>The question was so innocently asked, and Jack's artistic deference was so
  subtly conveyed, that Anstruther fell headlong into the trap.</p>

  <p>"I should say there is not the slightest doubt about it," the host
  responded. "I have been there; indeed. I spent a goodish part of my time in
  and about Montezuma."</p>

  <p>"And about when would that be?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>Anstruther explained, without giving definite dates, that it was about two
  years before. Jack proceeded to discuss the matter in a casual kind of way.
  He was anxious to know whether any of the old customs of the Aztecs still
  prevailed, that he had heard to a great extent the religion of these people
  had been built up on free-masonry. Did, for instance, Anstruther believe in
  the legends of terrible revenges which these people used to inflict on their
  enemies? But Anstruther declined to put his head further into the lion's
  mouth; he seemed to become suddenly a little uneasy and suspicious and
  changed the conversation to safer grounds. Still, Jack had learned quite as
  much as he had expected to learn, and Anstruther's very reticence confirmed
  Jack in the feeling that his host knew everything there was to know about the
  terrible misfortunes of the man or men called Nostalgo.</p>

  <p>It was getting fairly late now, and Jack was beginning to wonder whether
  the hour had not yet arrived for Rigby's promised diversion. If it came now
  it would be merely wasted, seeing that nothing could be gained by Rigby's
  ingenious device until Anstruther was safe in his study. He showed no signs,
  however of any disposition to move; his face had grown placid again, and he
  was talking with all his old charm of manner on various topics of
  interest.</p>

  <p>Jack did not fail to notice the figure of Serena as she flitted
  noiselessly about the room. It had not escaped his notice either, that the
  woman had appeared more than usually anxious and eager when Mexico had been
  mentioned. Serena disappeared from the room a moment in her soft, flitting
  manner, coming back a moment later with a telegram, which she laid silently
  by her master's side, Anstruther opened the envelope carelessly, and glanced
  at the contents.</p>

  <p>Just for an instant his face grew dark as a thunder cloud, and something
  like an oath escaped his lips. It was all like a lightning flash, but the
  swift change had not been lost on Jack. Anstruther twisted up the telegram
  carefully, and thrust it in one of the shaded candles before him, as if he
  needed a light for his cigar. Jack felt that he would have given much for a
  sight of that telegram; already it was a little pile of gray ashes upon
  Anstruther's dessert plate.</p>

  <p>"A great nuisance," the latter said airily; "that is the worst of being a
  man of science. But I am not going out to-night for anybody. I have got some
  music I want to try over presently."</p>

  <p>Jack murmured something appropriate to the occasion. Claire had already
  left the table, with the suggestion that perhaps the men would like coffee in
  the drawing room.</p>

  <p>"You stay here and smoke." said Anstruther; "you won't mind my leaving
  you, of course, especially as I am so anxious to get back to my music."</p>

  <p>So saying, Anstruther pitched, his cigar end on the ash tray, and moved
  off in the direction of his study. He had a gay, debonair manner now; he
  hummed a fragment of an operatic air as he walked along. There was the jangle
  of a telephone bell presently; almost immediately afterwards the study door
  was heard to shut and lock, and the music began.</p>

  <p>"It seems almost impossible to believe that that can be Anstruther." Jack
  said to himself. "No man could improve like that in so short a time. I wonder
  what Rigby is doing. I hope he won't spoil the pretty scheme by over-haste.
  Probably in the course of half an hour he will deem it time to begin."</p>

  <p>Evidently Rigby had been of the same opinion, for a full half hour elapsed
  before a sound came from outside the house, Anstruther was well into his
  second theme before there was a sudden knocking and hammering on the front
  door and a stentorian voice burst into cries of "Fire! fire!"</p>

  <p>So spontaneous and natural was the whole thing, that Jack was taken
  absolutely aback for a moment. It occurred to him, of course, that a fire had
  broken out inside the house, and that soma passer-by had discovered it. Again
  came the hammering on the door and the strident shouts of those outside. Jack
  made a leap for the hall, and raced upstairs to the drawing room three steps
  at a time. Claire had thrown her book aside, and stood, pale and startled,
  demanding to know what was the matter.</p>

  <p>"Somebody outside is calling 'flre'." Jack explained hurriedly; "not that
  I fancy there is much the matter&mdash;the kitchen chimney or something of
that
  kind. There they go again!"</p>

  <p>Once more the hammering and yelling were upraised; a frightened servant
  crept across the hall to the front door and opened it. And yet, despite all
  this turmoil, the beautiful soft strains of music below were continuing. Not
  for a second did they cease; the player was evidently too wrapped in his
  music to be conscious of outside disturbances. Not that the clamor lacked
  force and volume, for now that the front door was open the din was absolutely
  deafening. Through the break in the disturbance the sweet liquid strains of
  music went on. Fond of his instrument as Anstruther might have been, he could
  be wide awake and alert enough on ordinary occasions, as Jack knew only too
  well. Why, then, was he so callous on this occasion?</p>

  <p>"Had not you better go down and arouse my guardian?" Claire suggested;
  "surely he is the the proper man to look to a thing like this."</p>

  <p>Jack tumbled eagerly down the stairs and thundered with both fists on the
  study door. As he had more than half expected, no response came to his
  summons. The music had become still more melodious and dreamy; the player
  might have been far away. As Jack turned, he saw that some half-dozen men
  were standing in the hall, one of whom gave him a palpable wink. It was
  Rigby's wink, and Jack detected it instantly.</p>

  <p>"There don't seem to be very much the matter, sir," Rigby said. "No more
  than the kitchen fire. Only we thought we'd drop in and let you know. You
  chaps go to the kitchen and see what you can do."</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you manage that?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Only a matter of burning a little magnesium light by the back door,"
  Rigby explained, with a grin; "but it seems to me only part of your duty to
  acquaint the master of the house with the fact that something is wrong. Is
  that him playing now. Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody else," Jack replied. Isn't it wonderful. Anybody would think he
  was a great artist absolutely lost to all sense of his surroundings. Still,
  as you say, it is our duty to let him know what is going on, even if we have
  to break in the door."</p>

  <p>Rigby grinned responsively. Secure in his disguise, he was not afraid of
  being taken for anything else but a street loafer eager to earn a more or
  less honest shilling. He tried the door and found it locked; he ran back a
  pace or two and hurled himself with full force against the oak door. Crack
  went the door on its hinges, the woodwork gave inwardly, and the room was
  disclosed to view.</p>

  <p>The music had not stopped or faltered for an instant, the whole apartment
  was flooded with a delicate melody. Jack stood there puzzled and bewildered,
  and with a feeling that would wake presently and find that it was all a
  dream.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely stupendous:" he cried: "music fit food for the gods, and not a
  sign of the player!"</p>

  <p>For the room was absolutely empty!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; A BROKEN MELODY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE they stood in the empty room, neither speaking, and
  gazing about them as if they expected some solution of the strange mystery to
  fall upon them. The wildest part of the whole thing was that though the music
  continued in the same sweet, harmonious way, there was not the slightest
  suggestion or indication of where it came from. It could not possibly have
  been a phonograph or a gramophone or anything of that kind, as the instrument
  in that case would have been in sight. And yet the whole room was flooded
  with that beautiful melody as if an invisible choir had been there making the
  music of the gods.</p>

  <p>"I declare it makes me feel quite queer," Rigby said; "but of course there
  must be some practical explanation of it. Can you suggest any common-sense
  solution?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I am quite sure that Anstruther could," Jack replied. "This has
  nothing to do with the other world. What's that?"</p>

  <p>Though Jack spoke cooly enough, he was feeling just a little nervous
himself. From the
  hall beyond came a quick, buzzing noise, like a muffled circular saw, which
  resolved itself presently into the wild whirling of the handle of the
  telephone, as if some one were trying to get a call in a desperate hurry.
  Rigby jumped at once to the explanation, and Jack proceeded immediately to
  make a close examination of the room.</p>

  <p>He was still in the act of doing so when a startled cry from Rigby brought
  him up all standing. An instant later and Anstruther was there, demanding to
  know the meaning of this unwarrantable intrusion. Rigby congratulated himself
  upon his disguise; he had no fancy at that moment to be recognised by
  Anstruther.</p>

  <p>"Who is that loafer yonder?" Anstruther demanded passionately. "What is
  the blackguard doing in my study? And, if it comes to that, what are you
  doing here too?"</p>

  <p>Jack proceeded to explain exactly what had happened. In spite of the
  confusion of the moment, he had not failed to notice the fact that the music
  had ceased directly Anstruther had entered the room. It was quite evident
  that Anstruther had not the slightest idea of Rigby's identity. He was
  clearly taken in by the story of the fire, and pitched Rigby a half-crown,
  which the latter acknowledged hoarsely, after the manner of the class he was
  made up to represent.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose it is all right now," Anstruther muttered. Usually cool
  and collected enough, he looked white and very much agitated. Something had
  evidently gone terribly wrong with that man of blood and iron. "Get these
  fellows out of the house, please, Masefield. I have had a great deal to worry
  me to-night, and I want to be quiet."</p>

  <p>There being nothing further to wait for, and Rigby. having practically
  gained his point, departed with an intimation to Jack that he would wait
  outside for him.</p>

  <p>Masefield could see that Anstruther was regarding him with an eye of deep
  suspicion. But it was no cue of Jack's to notice this; he wanted to make
  matters as smooth as possible.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you were not very far away?" he said. "I heard your violin a
  few minutes before the fire broke out. I wonder you did not see it for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Anstruther's face cleared slightly. though Jack noticed that his hand
  trembled, and that his pallid lips were twitching. With a commonplace
  expression or two, Jack turned and left the house as if nothing out of the
  usual run had happened. He found Rigby patiently waiting for him at the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of that?" Rigby asked. "I am exceedingly glad
  that Anstruther did not recognise me. A most unlucky thing that he should
  have come back like that. Given half an hour alone in that room, it would
  have been an odd thing if we had not solved the mystery of the invisible
  musician. But it is hardly safe to stop and discuss the question here. Walk
  on to <i>The Planet</i> office, and wait for me there."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>"Is there any more to be done to-night?" Jack asked, when he and his
  friend were alone once more, seated in the latter's office. "Shall we stop
  here, or do you want to proceed further before you go to bed?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you can do as you please." Rigby said. "I don't know that I
  particularly desire your services at present My notion is to go back to
  Panton Square and hang about on the off-chance of seeing something."</p>

  <p>"And spend half the night in dodging the police." Jack laughed. "That's a
  very primitive idea of yours; I flatter myself I have a much better idea than
  that. Anstruther will never betray himself; we haven't the slightest chance
  of trapping him. Now, unless I am altogether out of it, Padini is the man we
  want to get hold of. He is exceedingly vain: like most artists, there is
  nothing secretive about him, and I am told that he is particularly fond of a
  glass of champagne. Depend upon it, that fellow will talk fast enough when
  the time comes. If he doesn't, we can make him."</p>

  <p>"But we must have something to go upon." Rigby observed thoughtfully. "I
  think we are justified in assuming that the fellow is a wrong 'un; anyway,
  our hands will be greatly strengthened if we can find something to his
  discredit."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I mean to do." Jack said. "Now Bates is quite as much
  interested in this matter as we are, and though you have backed yourself
  against the police in this case, there is no reason why you shouldn't make
  use of them. Besides, we are not bound to tell Bates too much. If there is
  anything to be found out to the discredit of Padini, Bates is the very man
  for our purpose."</p>

  <p>But, as it transpired subsequently, Bates was not available. He had just
  gone off, so the sergeant said, having been called in to investigate a
  burglary quite recently discovered in Belgrave Gardens. It was something
  exceedingly neat in the way of a burglary, the sergeant explained, with the
  air of a connoisseur in such matters; in fact, the place had been routed
  during the progress of a big reception. No ladders had been used, no wedges
  or commonplace implements of that kind: indeed, it was more than suspected
  that the burglary was the work of two of the guests. An unfortunate footman,
  being where he ought not to have been, had had his suspicions aroused by the
  movements of two distinguished-looking men in evening dress. He had come
  quite unexpectedly upon them in one of the corridors, and had so far
  forgotten himself as to want to know what they were doing there. Immediately
  one of them had felled him with some blunt, heavy instrument, and he had only
  just time to yell a note of warning before he fainted. The cry was taken up
  at once, and immediately the corridor was filled with men guests. In the
  confusion, and owing to the fact that the thieves themselves were in evening
  dress, it was impossible to lay hands on the culprits. All this the sergeant
  told the visitors with an air of great enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"If you give us the number we will walk round there," Rigby said. "Thank
  you very much."</p>

  <p>The big house in Belgrave Gardens had lost most of its air of simmering
  excitement by the time the two friends reached there. They mere informed that
  Bates had nearly finished his investigations, and, indeed, the inspector came
  into the hall at that moment, accompanied by Lord Longworth. He held in his
  hand a beautiful embroidered silk muffler&mdash;one of those choice affairs
which
  are large enough cover a dinner table, and yet small enough to go into a
  waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"Very strange indeed, your lordship Bates was saying; "I can't understand
  it at all. Here is your injured footman prepared to swear that one of his
  assailants was wearing that muffler when he came into the house; that is, on
  his arrival. And here we have Mrs. Montague ready to swear that the muffler
  belongs to her. Whether she likes it or not, I really must insist on my right
  to take this wrap away with me. If it proves to belong to Mrs. Montague, why,
  of course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And the detective shrugged his shoulders. A moment later, and he was in
  the street with Masefield and Rigby. He listened carefully enough to the
  dramatic version of the story they had to tell him and professed himself
  ready to do anything required of him.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I know nothing whatever about this violin mystery," he said.
  "I have quite enough to do to look after the native element in the way of
  rascality. But there are ways and means of getting the better of the gentle
  foreigner."</p>

  <p>"But I always understood that Scotland Yard employed detectives of all
  nationalities," Rigby observed. "Haven't you got anybody on your staff with a
  knowledge of international crime?"</p>

  <p>Bates responded that such was the case. If the friends liked, he would go
  with them at once to the residence of Superintendent Zimburg, and there see
  what could be done. "As far as I am personally concerned, my own hands are
  very full to-night."</p>

  <p>"Your sergeant told us that this was a very interesting case." Jack
  suggested "Is it possible that this burglary was the work of some guests
  invited to this house?"</p>

  <p>"Honestly, I believe it to be the case." Bates proceeded to explain.
  "After all is said and done, modern society is a pretty queer mixture. Given
  a good presence and a good address, plus the appearance of the possession of
  money, it is quits possible for a man to get anywhere. Take a big reception
  like the one that Lord Longworth gave to-night Now it would be quite fair to
  assume that his lordship and his wife were not personally acquainted with at
  least a third of the guests present. Somebody takes a friend, and that friend
  takes somebody else, and there you are. Of course, you are aware of the fact
  that at all big weddings nowadays it is absolutely necessary to employ
  detectives. To-night's business was exceedingly neat and novel, and might
  have been wonderfully successful but for the footman. All the same I am quite
  certain that the thing was executed by somebody who is actually a guest of
  his lordship."</p>

  <p>"And not so much as a clue left behind," Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, there is, and there isn't," Bates admitted. "I had a good look
  round when everybody was gone, and the only thing I could lay my hands on was
  this wonderful silk muffler. Nobody owned it; the injured footman declares
  that he saw a gentleman arriving earlier in the evening who had this muffler
  about his neck. Here was a fine clue, I thought to myself. And then Mrs.
  Montague comes back in her brougham and claims this thing as her own.
  Distinctly annoying, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Annoying enough." Rigby agreed; "but is the muffler in question so very
  much out of the common?"</p>

  <p>Bates was emphatically of the opinion that such was the case. He produced
  the thing from his pocket and the three men proceeded to examine it in the
  light of a street lamp. Jack appeared as if about to say something, then
  suddenly changed his mind, and began to whistle instead. They came at length
  once more to Shannon Street police station, where Bates telephoned to
  Superintendent Zimburg, asking the latter if he would come around
  immediately. He arrived a few momenta later&mdash;a slim, dark little man,
with a
  vivacious manner and a beard with an interrogative cock to it. He smiled in a
  greasy sort of way at the suggestion that there might be some prominent
  foreign scoundrel in London with whom he was not acquainted.</p>

  <p>"I know the whole gang," he said. "That is exactly my business. Have I
  seen anything, or do I know anything of this Padini? Probably I do, but not
  under that name. Oh yes, it is quite a usual thing for some of the pick of
  cosmopolitan rascals to be talented. For instance, I know at least three who
  might have made great names as artists, only they prefer the seamy aide of
  life. There is another who might have been a poet. Therefore I see no reason
  why this Padini, or whatever his proper name may be, should not be a really
  great violinist. If you have such a thing as a portrait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Bates has nothing of the kind, and the whole thing looked like coming
  to a deadlock, when Rigby suddenly recollected that a portrait of Padini was
  to be obtained in <i>The Planet</i> office. The violinist's portrait had been
  reproduced in <i>The Planet</i> two days before, and the original was still
  lying about the office.</p>

  <p>I'll take a cab and be back in ten minutes," Rigby said.</p>

  <p>He was back in the prescribed time, and produced a cabinet portrait of
  Padini, which he handed over to the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Now, what do you make of that?" he asked.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; THE MOUSE IN THE TRAP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ZIMBURG pulled the lamp across the table, and through his
  glasses carefully scrutinized the features of the violinist.</p>

  <p>"Very strange he muttered; "it is not often that I am puzzled. Offhand I
  should have said that I had never seen this face before, but the more I look
  at it, the more certain I am that the features are quite familiar to me. At
  the same time there is some subtle change which baffles me&mdash;it may be
  the eyes, or the nose and the mouth&mdash;that it is impossible to say.
Anyway, I
  should be prepared to arrest the man on suspicion, and take the risk of
  finding out all about him afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I suppose any slight alteration makes a difference in the photograph?"
  Jack asked. "After all said and done, photography is a very weak reed to lie
  upon. Can't you tell us exactly what is puzzling your?"</p>

  <p>Zimburg threw up his hands with a suggestion of despair. A sudden light
  flashed across Jack's mind. He recollected that Padini, so far as the stage
  was concerned, appeared with a clean face, but in private life it had been
  his whim to adopt a moustache strictly on the lines of that worn by the
  German Emperor. It was apparently an insane thing to do, and savored more of
  conceit than anything else, but no doubt the thing had its advantages.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to have such a thing as a paint box and a brush on the
  premises?" Jack asked, "if so, I think I shall be in a position to jog Mr.
  Zimburg's memory."</p>

  <p>As it happened, the necessary implements were there to hand. There were
  occasions, Bates explained, when such things were necessary. Now and then
  some sprig of the nobility who had dined not wisely but too well found
  himself in the cells in a more of less dilapidated condition, and here it was
  that the paint-box came in. Black eyes and discolored faces and that kind of
  thing, Bates explained. "I assure you that a dash or two of paint makes all
  the difference in the world."</p>

  <p>Jack smiled as he bent over the photograph, and with a few subtle touches
  decorated the face with a fierce blond moustache. He handed the card over
  without comment to Zimburg. The little man's face fairly beamed with
  delight.</p>

  <p>"Ah! but you are a clever gentleman," he cried. "Now, I know our friend.
  Yes, yes, but he is a very clever man. And older than he looks, mind you;
  that fellow has eluded the Continental police for years. It would be absurd
  to try and give his real name, for probably he has forgotten it himself. Yes,
  I have heard of his playing before; not that I regarded him as quite good
  enough for a public platform. Wherever that man goes, roguery follows as a
  matter of course. Depend upon it, his appearance here means mischief. I will
  have him carefully watched, and before long I will have the pleasure of
  laying him by the heels."</p>

  <p>"Don't do that, at least until you are absolutely obliged to," Jack said
  eagerly. "We are interested, deeply interested, in the movements of Signor
  Padini. It is more or less of a private matter, but if you could provide us
  with some means of getting a hold on that fellow we should be exceedingly
  obliged to you."</p>

  <p>Zimburg promised to do his best, and departed. For some little time Rigby
  and Bates stood discussing the moat recent developments of the case, whilst
  Jack sat in a thoughtful attitude, evidently puzzling something out.</p>

  <p>"Do you call Zimburg a realty clever detective?" he asked at length. "It
  seems to me that he has a poor memory for faces. For instance, he had not the
  slightest idea who the man Padini was till that moustache was added to the
  face of the photograph."</p>

  <p>Bates, eager in the defense of his colleagues remarked that a little thing
  like that often made a vast difference.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the great advantages of the Bertillon system." he
  explained. "I don't care how clever a man may be&mdash;and when I speak of a
  clever man I mean a policeman in this instance&mdash;he is often utterly
deceived
  by some slight physical change. Take the case of the late Charles Peace if
  you like. I understand that he could alter the expression or even the shape
  of his face entirely. Make your mind quite easy, for Zimburg will work it all
  out like some ingenious puzzle. I suppose you are aware of the fact that the
  London and Paris police have thousands of careful records made of the
  measurements of well-Known criminals."</p>

  <p>"But Zimburg can't very well measure Padini," Rigby argued. "He can't make
  him drunk, or anything of that kind."</p>

  <p>"No, but he can have him arrested on some faked-up charge." Bates laughed.
  "That little game has been played more than once when we wanted the
  measurements of some clever criminal who had never passed through our
  hands.</p>

  <p>"That is very ingenious," Rigby said, "and I shan't forget it. If facts
  like those were more widely known, I fancy you would get more assistance from
  the Press."</p>

  <p>Bates emphatically repudiated the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I have often heard you say, in fact it is a rather fruitful source of
  complaint to the police, that the newspapers do them more harm that good."
  Jack said reflectively; "but I think I can see a way whereby the Press could
  give you a good leg-up in the case of this Belgrave Gardens mystery. Dick; is
  it too late to get a paragraph inserted in to-morrow's <i>Planet</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Oh. dear, no," Rigby explained. "Probably no paper in London goes to bed
  later than we do. We make it a point of keeping open until the last possible
  minute, and we have a good hour before us yet. But what are you driving
  at?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it is this way. It is pretty clear that one of the thieves was
  wearing that embroidered scarf which was also claimed by Mrs. Montague.
  Probably there were two such mufflers, but that does not affect my argument.
  Of course, a description of this affair will appear in to-morrow's
  <i>Planet</i>, but I should like to embroider on it a bit. Suppose we add to
  the report a paragraph to the effect that the thief left a marvelous wrap
  behind him. We could say that it was absolutely unique, and all that sort of
  thing, just the sort of silly gossip that your readers are so fond of. We
  could hint that the scarf still remains at Belgrave Gardens for
  identification. Now it is a thousand to one this paragraph reaches the eye of
  the thief, or is brought to his notice. This being so. he will lose no
  opportunity of getting the wrap back again. All you have to do is to keep the
  houser carefully under observation, and your man falls into your hands like,
  a ripe blackberry. What does the inspector think of our little scheme?"</p>

  <p>Bates pondered the matter a moment or two, and then cautiously remarked
  that at any rate there could be no harm in it. Whereupon the two friends went
  away together, and half an hour later a spicy paragraph had been constructed
  for the delectation of <i>The Planet's</i> readers to-morrow. Rigby threw the
  paragraph aside, and whistled upstairs to the composing room.</p>

  <p>"You look as if you had something at the back of your mind," he said,
  passing the cigarettes across to his companion. "Jack, you have found
  something out?"</p>

  <p>"Upon my word. I believe I have," Jack replied. "It is rather soothing to
  one's vanity to get on the inside track so far as a detective is concerned.
  But it would not have been at all fair on my part to have said anything to
  Bates, seeing that you are investigating this Nostalgo business on your own
  account. Not that I am absolutely certain of my facts now. but I shall be
  after I have seen Miss Helmsley in the morning. Now, is there anything else
  we can do to-night? I suppose even an indefatigable journalist like yourself
  goes to bed sometimes."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Anstruther, was fortunately out when Jack called at Panton Square the next
  morning. He smiled to himself as he noticed a copy of <i>The Planet</i> on
  the hall table. It had evidently been carefully read; and on page 5, where
  the account of the Belgrave Gardens burglary appeared, somebody had ticked
  the paragraph with a pencil. Miss Helmsley was in the drawing-room, the
  housemaid said, and would see Mr. Masefield if he would go upstairs! Claire
  was looking a little pale and distracted, Jack thought; her eyes bore
  evidence of the fact that she had passed a restless night. But her face
  lighted up, and the old charm of feature reasserted itself as Jack
  entered.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, this won't do," he said half tenderly, half playfully.
  "Positively I shall have to kiss the color back to those pallid lips of
  yours. What is worrying you so much, dearest?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing worries me to long as I am with you," the girl said, as she stood
  with Jack's arm about her. "And yet I almost wish that you had never told me
  what you did yesterday."</p>

  <p>"You cannot wish it more than I do, sweetheart," Jack murmured; "but don't
  you see that it was almost necessary. There is some desperate rascality going
  on here, and your happiness could not have been an assured thing till we get
  to the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"But that is just what frightens me," Claire protested. "I cannot get out
  of my mind the recollection of what happened last night. I shall never listen
  to that music again without the feeling that some unknown danger is hovering
  over me. I am frightened. Jack, frightened to my very sou!. And yet the whole
  thing can be explained; I am sure you can explain it yourself if you
  like."</p>

  <p>Jack replied that he hoped to do so in a few days. He assured Claire that
  there was nothing supernatural about the music. For both their sakes he
  exhorted her to be brave. The red mouth grew hard and firm; there was a look
  of resolve in the girl's blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"It shall be even as you say," she said. "But tell me, has anything fresh
  happened since last night?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that is worth speaking of," Jack said, feeling a little ashamed
  of his evasion. "Did Anstruther go out again last night? By the way. he
  seldom wears an overcoat; at least, so I understand him to. When he came in
  last evening, after the fire broke out, I noticed that he was wearing an
  overcoat then. Where does he get these wonderful embroidered scarfs
  from?"</p>

  <p>"He has only one, so far as I know," Claire explained. "Originally there
  three, but two were either lost or given away. Wonderful work. Is it
  not?"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful work, indeed," Jack attested, "but he did not tell me where
  they came from."</p>

  <p>"So far as I can understand they came from Mexico. The silk is really
  Chinese of a quality which is made only for the Imperial palace of Pekin. To
  steal such a material is an offense punishable by death, but it is sometimes
  smuggled out of that town, and clever natives of Southern Mexico do the
  embroidery. But why you so curious about, this scarf?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I merely thought I should like to get one like it," Jack said
  carelessly. He had no intention of frightening Claire any more than was
  absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you let me see it for a moment or two? I suppose you know where
  it is kept?"</p>

  <p>Claire knew perfectly well where to lay her hands upon the scarf.
  Anstruther was a methodical man, and hated to leave his things lying about.
  He only used the scarf at such times as he was in evening dress. Claire went
  off, and Jack was by no means surprised that he had to wait a quarter of an
  hour. When Claire returned, her hands were empty: there was a puzzled frown
  between her usually smooth white brow.</p>

  <p>"A most extraordinary thing," she said. "I cannot find the scarf anywhere.
  I am quite certain, that Mr. Anstruther is not wearing it; I thought perhaps
  he had thrown it carelessly down last night in the excitement of the moment,
  and therefore I asked Serena if she had seen anything of it. But she declared
  that she knew nothing, and yet at the same time she seemed to be
  extraordinarily troubled and agitated by my simple question. She is not an
  emotional woman, as you know, therefore her conduct is all the more amazing.
  But the fact remains that the scarf cannot be found, and so I cannot oblige
  you. I will ask Mr. Anstruther, if you like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Jack emphatically wanted nothing of the kind. He was in a hurry now,
  he said, and would call again later in the day. He made his way directly to
  <i>The Planet</i> office, where he found that Rigby had just arrived.</p>

  <p>"No, there are no fresh developments," he explained. "Did you take my
  advice last night and have the house in Belgrave Gardens watched by a private
  detective in addition to the policeman engaged by Bates?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I did." Rigby replied. "As a matter of fact I have two men at
  watch there; one to relieve the other, and report progress from time to time.
  In fact, one of them has only just come in. He has very little to say, but
  that little was an eye-opener. I have ascertained that Anstruther is not even
  acquainted with Lord Longworth, and yet one of the first me to call in
  Belgrave Gardens this morning was Spencer Anstruther! Now, do you think he
  had anything to do with last night's business; otherwise, what do you suppose
  he called for?"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I am here to tell you," Jack said. "The scarf which
  formed so important a clue belonged to Anstruther. It is missing from his
  house. In fact, I called there this morning on purpose to examine the thing.
  We have hit the right nail on the head this time&mdash;the lost property in
the
  hands of Inspector Bates is beyond a doubt the cherished possession of
  Spencer Anstruther."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; A LEADER OF SOCIETY</a></h2>

<p>IT was a most important discovery that Jack had made, and Rigby
did not fail to see what developments it was likely to lead to.</p>

<p>If what Masefield had said was true&mdash;and Rigby
saw no reason to doubt it&mdash;here they had Anstruther
directly connected with the crime.</p>

<p>"Do you really think that our friend actually engineered the
business at Lord Longworth's?" Rigby asked.</p>

<p>"I cone to no other conclusion," Jack replied. "You must understand
that Anstruther is a kind of specialist in crime; he had frequently
been consulted by the police, and I believe has brought off some wonderful
results. He has even written a book on the subject. Now,
we know Anstruther to be an unscrupulous rascal. The police looked
upon him as a brilliant aid to themselves. If a man like this
chooses to play the part of a ciminal Duuin, see what marvelous
opportunities he has. He knows everything about the movements of the police;
he can anticipate all theirs chemes. It is as if Bates himself
had turned burglar. Whatever Mrs. Montague might say, it is pretty
certain that the embroidered scarf belongs to Anstruther. Quite inadvertently
he left it at Lord Longworth's last night, where he was passing in the
crowd as an invited guest."</p>

<p>"I know that sort of thing is done," Rigby said. "A very impudent example
came under my notice the other day. The thing is much easier done than
one would imagine."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," asked Jack, "that it is possible for a
  gentlemanly scoundrel to walk into the house of some great society
  lady giving a reception and not be spotted immediately for what he
  is? It seems absurd!"

  "Not a bit of it!" Rigby replied. "To the audacious everything is possible.
  Supposing a duchess is giving a reception. She has asked perhaps a thousand
guests. Half-way through the evening she is so tired and worn out that she
does not know or care to whom she may be speaking.
Here is the chance for the gentlemanly swindler
we are talking about. Of course,
  he is perfectly dressed; he has the most exquisite manners. He lounges up to
  his hostess, and, after the usual greetings, makes some confidential remark
  about some friend of the family, which immediately stamps him as one of a
  certain set. All he has got to do now is to saunter along as if the whole
  place belonged to him, and help himself to such costly trifles as his mind
  inclines to."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever know of a case in point?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, I not only knew of a case, but I was more or less party to
  it. It was done for a bet, and I was one of the losers. It was so easily
  managed that I should not in the least mind trying it myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems very odd to me," Jack murmured. "still, if you know it has
  been done, there is an end of it."</p>

  <p>"Well, it has been shown pretty conclusively," said Rigby, "that
  Anstruther must have been there last night."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Jack went on. "At any rate the scarf was left behind. I
  recognised it as soon as ever I saw it in Bates' hand; therefore I was
  absolutely sure that Anstruther had been at the reception. That is why I
  suggested that paragraph in <i>The Planet</i>. It is just the sort of silly
  gossip that papers publish after a sensational crime, and is calculated to
  hamper the police more than help them. I felt quite sure that somebody or
  other would bring that paragraph to Anstruther's notice, and that he would
  loss no time in trying to recover the scarf. I dare say there are other
  scarfs like it in existence, but they are not so common that Anstruther could
  afford to take any risk. That he realized the gravity of the situation is
  proved by the fact that he has lost no time in calling at Lord Longworth's to
  recover the missing property. I think I have made my case very clear."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be clearer," Rigby replied. "Anstruther is at the bottom of
  this business. I should say he is the cleverest rascal in London at the
  present moment. And mark the cunning of the beast. Don't you see how easy he
  can prove an alibi? If he were met face to face now, and taxed with the fact
  that he was at Lord Longworth's last night be would politely deny, it and, if
  pressed, have not the slightest difficulty in demonstrating that he was
  elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"But I don't quite see," Jack interrupted, "exactly how that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Clear as mud," Rigby said. "Why, he has only got to call his servants and
  Miss Helmsley to prove that he was in the study all the evening playing his
  violin."</p>

  <p>"How stupid of me," Jack muttered. "The full beauty of that little scheme
  had been lost on me. There is a good deal we have to learn yet. But I can't
  stay talking to you any longer this morning, as I promised Claire that I
  would go and see Lady Barmouth. I have told Claire nearly everything there is
  to learn, and she is quite willing to be a friend of Lady Barmouth's and
  share her troubles. I will see you later in the day."</p>

  <p>Jack went off in the direction of Lord Barmouth's house. He had some
  little hesitation in calling so early in the day, but then the matter was
  imperative, and he knew that Lady Barmouth would be glad to hear Claire's
  decision. The lady in question was sitting in her boudoir, accompanied by two
  secretaries, who appeared to be tremendously busy with a long visiting-list
  and some exquisitely-designed cards of invitation to a masked ball. But Lady
  Barmouth, heedless of Jack's apologies, declared that she had always time to
  spare for him.</p>

  <p>"It is not I who am so busy." she said; "in fact, this is merely
  mechanical work, I am giving my great party of the season, and now that I
  have made out the list of intended guests, the rest is merely mechanical." So
  saying, Lady Barmouth led the way into an inner drawing-room, the door of
  which she carefully closed.</p>

  <p>"You have some news for me," she cried eagerly. "I am quite sure you have
  come straight to me from Miss Helmsley."</p>

  <p>"That is the fact," Jack said gravely. "Rather against my better judgment,
  I have told Claire everything. She knows now the class of man her guardian
  is; she knows that she will have to be terribly careful lest he should
  suspect. But Claire has a courage and determination which came quite as a
  surprise to me. I think the secret will be safe in her hands."</p>

  <p>"Yes! yes!" Lady Barmouth cried; "but what about me?"</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that. It seems to be a case of mutual sympathy between
  you. As a matter of fact it seems to me that Claire likes you as well as you
  like her. Anyway, she is willing to see you this afternoon, when you can talk
  matters over without reserve. But tell me, does Lord Barmouth take any kind
  of interest in these festivities of yours?"</p>

  <p>"He is goodness and kindness itself," Lady Barmouth said warmly. "He has
  always insisted that his misfortune should not interfere with my personal
  enjoyment. At a dinner, or a reception, or an ordinary dance, my husband
  never shows himself. Despite his terrible misfortunes he thoroughly enjoys
  his amusements; he likes to mingle with people, seeing everything;, and not
  being seen himself. That is why I give so many of these masked balls. This is
  going to be an extra-smart affair, and I am asking my lady friends to wear as
  many jewels as possible."</p>

  <p>"Claire told me something about it," Jack said. "I gathered that she is to
  be one of the invited guests."</p>

  <p>"I am asking both Miss Helmsley and Mr. Anstruther." Lady Barmouth
  explained. "There is some danger in asking the latter, but one has to take
  these risks."</p>

  <p>Jack murmured something that sounded sympathetic. Had Lady Barmouth only
  known it, the risk was far greater than she imagined. If Jack's suspicion
  were correct that Anstruther was mixed up with a gang of expert thieves, here
  then was a golden opportunity. The mere fact of it being a masked ball simply
  added to its opportunities. So deeply did Jack ponder over this, that it was
  some little time before he grasped the fact that Lady Barmouth was still
  giving him details of the forthcoming function.</p>

  <p>"I am asking a lot of most prominent actresses," she said, "together with
  a number of leading musicians, and they are setting up a kind of morris
  dance. Of course, the music will be supplied by a small band of famous
  artists, and I am getting the new man Padini to be present."</p>

  <p>Here was more news with a vengeance. But there was nothing to be gained by
  telling Lady Barmouth what had been elicited with regard to Padini.</p>

  <p>"I presume I shall be honored with an invitation," Jack suggested. "I see
  from the expression of your face that I am to be a guest. Might I beg the
  favor of a card for a friend of mine?"</p>

  <p>"More mysteries!" Lady Barmouth laughed. "Oh, you need not tell me unless
  it is absolutely necessary. You shall take the card away it you like, and
  deliver it to your friend personally."</p>

  <p>Jack was seeing his way pretty clearly by this time. He was anticipating
  more than one important discovery during the progress of the masked dance.
  The card he had begged was, of course, for Rigby, and it would go hard if
  between them they did not discover something of importance.</p>

  <p>"Now, I am going to speak to you on a more or less painful topic," Jack
  said gravely. "And I am going to ask you to be exceedingly candid with me. I
  want you to tell me what is the exact connection between Lord Barmouth and
  the Nostalgo posters which are so prominent in London at present."</p>

  <p>The jeweled pen with which Lady Barmouth had been scribbling on the two
  invitation cards fell from her fingers on to the blotting-pad. There were
  trouble and unhappiness in her eyes, her face turned deadly pale; it was some
  little time before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Must I really tell you that?" she almost pleaded. "You are striking
  directly at the root of the unhappiness which poisons this house. It is not
  as if you really knew anything?"</p>

  <p>"But indeed I know more than you give me credit for," Jack urged. "It was
  of no seeking of mine; it was not the remit of any vulgar curiosity; but last
  night when your husband was here I caught one glimpse of his face in the
  light of the log fire. And there I saw at once that I was face to face with
  Nostalgo. Believe me, it is with the greatest possible regret that I have to
  speak like this, but I am near to the heart of the mystery, and if you are
  plain and frank with me I am sanguine enough to believe that I can remove
  your unhappiness altogether."</p>

  <p>"But the secret is not my own," Lady Barmouth faltered.</p>

  <p>"Then let us assume that I have wrested it from you," Jack murmured. "It
  is no fault of yours that I know so much. It is no fault of yours that you
  are in some way under an obligation to somebody&mdash;an obligation which
  compelled you to be in Montrose Place last night. Luckily for us you kept
  your appointment. But there was somebody else also keeping an appointment in
  the courtyard. Whether he came there dragged by the force of circumstances,
  or whether he came to watch, matters little. But as be paused to light a
  cigarette and the pallid blue of the flame shone on his face I
  recognised&mdash;Lord Barmouth."</p>

  <p>The listener said nothing; she merely bowed her head over the blotting-pad
  before her.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I feel the circumstances are too strong for me," she said. "It is as
  if you were pushing me over the edge of a precipice. I cannot decide this
  matter on my own initiative."</p>

  <p>"That is, exactly the line I hoped you would take," Jack cried eagerly.
  "After his interview with us last night, Lord Barmouth must be perfectly sure
  of the fact that Rigby and myself are actuated by the kindest motives towards
  him. Go and see him now, tell him all that I have said to you, and ask him if
  he would be good enough to grant me a ten minutes' private conversation. I am
  sure he will do this; indeed. If he refuses, there are others interested in
  the matter who may cause him to say in public what he declines to admit in
  private."</p>

  <p>"I will do as you suggest." Lady Barmouth replied, "though I fear you will
  be met with a refusal as firm as it is courteous. If you will excuse me for a
  moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth said no more, but turned hurriedly and left the room. That
  the was very deeply moved Jack could see for himself. She came back
  presently, with a wan, white ghost of a smile on her lips, with a remark to
  the effect that Lord Barmouth was not prepared to accede to Jack's request
  off-hand, but that he would give it his earnest consideration, and tend his
  decision in the course of a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>"It is exceedingly awkward for me," Jack said; "you can see how delicate
  the ground is I stand upon. But, believe me, I am only being cruel to be
  kind. I am sure that when I have finished my interview with Lord Barmouth he
  will be exceedingly glad that he has consented to see me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I quite understand your feelings," Lady Barmouth exclaimed, "It must
  be dreadful for a gentleman to appear obtruding like this. But are you quite
  that that the figure you saw in the courtyard at Montrose Place last night
  was my husband? You seem to have forgotten the other Nostalgo who was
  supposed to have have been found dead by yourself in Panton Square the other
  night."</p>

  <p>Jack admitted readily enough that there were many sides to the mystery as
  yet unsolved. He was still discussing the point, when the footman entered,
  and gravely announced that Lord Barmouth was waiting to see Mr. Masefield.
  Lady Barmouth rose to her feet at once, and escorted Jack to a small room at
  the end or the corridor. The apartment was in complete darkness; it was just
  possible to discern the outlines or a figure in an armchair.</p>

  <p>"I am pleased to see you, Mr. Masefield. I think you will find an armchair
  on the other side of the fireplace. My dear, I shall be pleased if you will
  leave Mr. Masefield and myself alone together."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; THE PORTRAIT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK sat there silently enough, waiting for Lord Barmouth to
  speak. The difficulty and delicacy of the situation were by no means lost
  upon him. He shuffled about uneasily n his chair, trying to make something
  definite out of the still figure opposite him.</p>

  <p>"I quite appreciate your feelings." Lord Barmouth said, in the deep,
  thrilling tones that Jack remembered so well. "It is no nice thing for a
  gentleman to thrust himself into the private sorrows of an unfortunate man
  like myself. But my wife has told me all that you have been recently saying
  to her. You appear to be under the impression that you saw me in Montrose
  Place last night; in fact, that you recognised my face, which I imprudently
  disclosed whilst I was lighting a cigarette. Mr. Masefield, I am not disposed
  to deny the accusation."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will be perfectly candid with me," Jack said, speaking with
  some hesitation; "believe me, I am actuated by the highest motives; believe
  me, I would do anything to rid you of the shadow that darkens your life. Of
  course, I have my theory on the subject of the strange business; a business
  which has been literally thrust upon me by stress of circumstances. Up to a
  short time ago, like moat people, I looked upon the Nostalgo poster as a high
  ingenuity in the way of advertising art. It was a wonderful effort, and most
  cleverly executed. But I should not have been in the least surprised to find
  that Nostalgo was an acrobat or a juggler, or even some new and clever way of
  introducing a fresh kind of soap to the credulous British public."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Barmouth said thoughtfully. "I suppose one would have been
  satisfied in that way."</p>

  <p>"But I speak with the discovery that I was mistaken," Jack went on. "The
  first thing that aroused my suspicions was more a girlish fancy than anything
  else. Of course you know Mr. Spencer Anstruther very well by name?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I know him by something more than name." Barmouth said, in deep,
  thrilling tones "If that scoundrel had never been born I should&mdash;but I
  am interrupting you. Pray proceed."</p>

  <p>"Well, to revert to what I was saying," Jack went on, "that Nostalgo
  poster was hardly fully impressed upon my mind's eye, before I began to
  notice some grotesque resemblance between it and Spencer Anstruther. Without
  hurting your feelings, the poster is devilishly hideous; Anstruther, on the
  other hand, is a singularly handsome man. But despite all this, despite my
  common sense, I could not rid myself of the idea that the likeness was
  somewhere.</p>

  <p>"A chance remark of mine served to confirm my impressions. It threw
  Anstruther into a sudden fit of passion. His face was literally convulsed
  with fury, but only for an instant. But that instant sufficed. There was
  Nostalgo in the flesh before me&mdash;the same drawn-up lips, the same hideous
  squint of the oblique eyes , the same dreadful, hawkish look about the nose.
  A second later the likeness was gone. I cannot forget, I never shall forget
  my feelings at that moment. If I fall to interest you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are interesting me more than words can tell," Barmouth said hoarsely.
  "Pray proceed."</p>

  <p>"There is not much more to tell," Jack said. "Perhaps you have heard of
  the Nostalgo devil whom I found dead the other night in Panton Square? It was
  the man whose body so mysteriously vanished from the Shannon Street
  station?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard of that," Barmouth admitted; "but you will not be in the
  least astonished to learn that this whole affair was no surprise to me. All
  the same, I think you will find later on that the supposed victim is not dead
  at all. And now I am going to speak, and you are going to listen."</p>

  <p>Jack intimated that he desired nothing better. He could make out the
  outline of the figure opposite him, wriggling and twisting in his chair.</p>

  <p>"As you are quite aware, a little more than two years ago I went to
  Mexico. There was no thought of evil in my mind. I went out merely with an
  eye to sport. I have been fond of adventure all my life, and Mexico seemed to
  afford a fine field for such amusements as I was looking for. But the
  shooting was a great disappointment, and I had to turn elsewhere for
  recreation. A little later on I found myself in Southern Mexico, living with
  a half-savage tribe who showed signs that at some long-forgotten period the
  same tribe had enjoyed a high state of civilization. As a matter of fact,
  there were two of these tribes living only a few leagues apart, and both
  exceedingly antagonistic to each other.</p>

  <p>"Of course I had to throw my lot in with one section, and take care that I
  didn't fall into the hands of the other.</p>

  <p>The reason of this bitterness, I discovered arose from the fact that both
  claimed possession of a belt of land which was supposed to contain gold. Now,
  I am an exceedingly rich man, as you know. But I got the gold fever as badly
  as if I had been the neediest adventurer who ever wielded pick and
  shovel.</p>

  <p>"I had been told by my friends that the leader of the other section was an
  Englishman like myself. He was supposed to have married one of the women of
  the tribe, and adopted their manners and customs. Of course, I needed no one
  to tell me that only such a powerful incentive as gold could have persuaded
  an educated Englishman to remain permanently with a tribe. This other section
  was far the more powerful of the two, and they gave us fair warning that any
  of us that were caught in the gold belt would be likely to suffer for it.
  This was quite good enough for me. Picking up a score of the most daring
  adventurers, we made up our minds to put in some exploring without delay. I
  may mention the fact that some of these adventurers were Europeans also.
  Anyway, we set out one evening, and morning found us lighting our campfire in
  the heart of the gold belt.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand I had been left behind to look after the cooking whilst
  the others pushed on to a likely spot where indications of the precious metal
  might be found. My companions had hardly disappeared from sight before a man
  came riding up to me and demanded my business. It was quite easy to see that
  he was an Englishman, despite the fact that he was arrayed in the full war
  paint of the tribe. He was a fine powerful man, and his face denoted great
  intellectual gifts. Come Mr. Masefield, you are a clever man yourself, and
  therefore will have no difficulty in guessing who the stranger was."</p>

  <p>"Anstruther for a hundred!" Masefield cried.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it exactly, as I thought you would," Lord Barmouth went
  on gravely. "It was Anstruther, and no other. He wasted no time in demanding
  to know what I was doing there. He warned me of the dreadful pains and
  penalties likely to occur if I remained where I was, but I laughed him to
  scorn. By way of reply he gave a shrill whistle, and there emerged from the
  scrubby brush a small misshapen man with the most hideous face that it has
  ever been my lot to look upon. Need I describe that face, Mr. Masefield?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Jack in an awed voice. "It was another Nostalgo."</p>

  <p>"Once more you have guessed it, Barmouth went on in the same way.
  "Anstruther pointed to the shrinking figure by his side, and told me that I
  must either go back at once, or that I must suffer the same fate as the man
  by his side. My blood was hot then: I care for no man. I do not exactly know
  how it commenced, but presently we were exchanging revolver shots, each
  determined to do for the other. I suppose somebody crept up behind me, for I
  was just conscious of a terrible blow on the back of the head, and then I
  remembered no more.</p>

  <p>"When I came to myself I was lying in a deserted hut, absolutely alone,
  and with a feeling upon me that I had just recovered from a long and painful
  illness. There was food beside me, a little native spirit in a bottle; my
  clothes were neatly laid at the foot of my bed. When I reached the open I
  recognised the fact that I wad in a spot some fifty miles on the far side of
  the gold belt. From the length of my beard I calculated that I must have been
  lying there for some three weeks. My horse I found outside, and, feeling
  strong enough to proceed on my journey, I rode off in the direction of the
  tribe to which I was attached. I was feeling fairly well, and conscious only
  of a strange tightening sensation in the muscles of the face."</p>

  <p>It was some time before Lord Barmouth spoke again. It was not for Jack to
  interrupt the tenor of his painful thoughts. But the silence was so long that
  he felt bound to speak at length.</p>

  <p>"But how does this give Anstruther such a hold on you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is another matter entirely," Barmouth explained, "though, of course,
  it touches on the main issue. You see, that though Anstruther knows me as the
  James Smith I used to be called in Mexico, he has not the remotest idea that
  I am Lord Barmouth. In fact that man blackmails me."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"I admit it sounds a little complicated," Barmouth went on. "As my real
  self Anstruther does not know me. Why should he interest himself in an
  apparently broken-down hypochondriac? The man he cares about is 'James
  Smith,' the Nostalgo whom he regards as a relative of my wife, and who lives
  here in some secluded part of the house. Heaven only knows if he is really
  aware of the truth, for he is so clever a scoundrel that he is quite capable
  of deceiving me on that point till the time is ripe to expose me and degrade
  me despite the sums of money I have paid him. I do not know. I dare not ask.
  Call me a coward if you like, but if you had gone through what I have?"</p>

  <p>Barmouth paused, and wiped the moisture from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"If I were not Lord Barmouth," he continued, "I would care little or
  nothing for what he says; but for the sake of my wife I have to submit to his
  persecutions. Therefore it is that at certain seasons of the year I meet
  Anstruther in Montrose Place and hand him over a thousand pounds. But there
  is one drawback to Anstruther's mastery of the situation. There are other men
  who were as vilely treated as myself, and some day Anstruther will fall by
  the hand of one of them.</p>

  <p>"If you ask me why those hideous posters have been lately dotted dotted
  about London, I can't tell you; I feel quite sure that they are some
  ingenious design of Anstruther's. I feel quite sure that that Nostalgo you
  picked up the other night was here after Anstruther's blood, and that he died
  at Anstruther's instigation. My only consolation is the fact that my wife
  absolutely refused to break off her engagement on the strength of my terrible
  disfigurement. It was a long time before I yielded, but yield I did at
  length. And now that you know so much, perhaps you will be so good as to draw
  up the blinds, and let us talk face to face; that is, if you do not object
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack hastily disclaimed any objection. He drew the blinds aside, and a
  flood of light poured into the room. It was a little difficult to repress a
  shudder at first, but he found himself presently talking to Barmouth as if
  his face had been like those of other men.</p>

  <p>"You will find some cigarettes; this is my own room." Barmouth explained.
  I furnished it more with an eye to comfort than anything else."</p>

  <p>But Jack was not listening. He took up a cigarette mechanically, and was
  gazing intently at a photograph in a large silver frame standing on the
  mantlepiece. It was the face of a woman: a dark melancholy face with mournful
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me who that is?" Jack asked</p>

  <p>"A sister of my wife's," Barmouth explained. "It is rather a sad
  story."</p>

  <p>Jack said nothing. But the face looking into his own was the face of
  Anstruther's servant, Serena.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; FACE TO FACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was perhaps fortunate for Jack that Lord Barmouth
  appeared to be engrossed in his own painful thoughts. At any rate he did not
  seem to notice that his youthful visitor's gaze was fixed so intently upon
  the photograph. So far as Jack could see, the picture had been taken some
  years before, and had not that wild, defiant, yet half-sad expression which
  marked Serena to-day. There was not much time to think, but Jack rapidly made
  up his mind. He would say nothing to Barmouth of his discovery, but would
  open up the matter, as delicately as possible with Lady Barmouth. It was not
  a nice thing for a comparative btranger to intrude upon sacred grief, like
  this, but the discovery was so likely to lead to important results that it
  would have been folly to hesitate. It was some considerable time later before
  Jack left Lord Barmouth, who shook him warmly by the hand and implored him to
  come again.</p>

  <p>"You can imagine what a lonely life mine is," Barmouth murmured. "My wife
  is devotion itself, but one longs for the company of a man sometimes."</p>

  <p>Jack promised sincerely enough that he would come again and often. He had
  taken a great liking to the lonely man who bore his cruel misfortunes to
  well. He had not intended at present to worry Lady Barmouth with the recent
  discovery, but she happened to be crossing the hall, and looked upon Jack
  eagerly and curiously.</p>

  <p>Jack was about to say something to Lady Barmouth when someone called her,
  and she turned away. Evidently she had no intention to allow Masefield to
  leave the house without satisfying herself as to the result of his interview
  with Lord Barmouth. With this feeling upon him, Jack lingered in the hall. He
  suddenly recollected that he had left his gloves behind him, and returned for
  them. He found Barmouth standing before the fireplace, apparently lost in
  thought. Jack had to speak twice before his host realized the fact that he
  was no longer alone.</p>

  <p>"I came back for my gloves." Jack explained. "I left them on the little
  table behind there. I am sorry to intrude upon you again, but since you have
  been to kind to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, it is you who have been so kind to me." Barmouth said.
  "I am not sorry you came back, because I have been thinking over the
  interview which we have just concluded. I might have told you a great deal
  more than I did. Indeed, I was perhaps unwise to be so reticent. If you will
  come and see me again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will come and see you as often as I can get an opportunity." Jack said
  warmly. "Apart from the gratification of my vulgar curiosity. I have been
  wonderfully entertained by your experiences. I saw Lady Barmouth in the hall
  just now, and I know that she is anxious to learn how we got on
  together."</p>

  <p>Jack went out again, with a feeling that he was more and more drawn toward
  his unfortunate host. He lingered in the hall for a moment, gazing at the
  fine pictures and the artistic arranging of the flowers, hoping that Lady
  Barmouth would return. He had not long to wait, for presently she came
  floating down the stairs again. There was a pleased smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am so glad you stayed so long," she said. My poor George must have
  enjoyed your society or he would not have detained you."</p>

  <p>"We got on very well together, indeed," Jack explained. "I now have a
  pretty shrewd idea of this Nostalgo business. During my interview with your
  husband I made an still more stupendous discovery."</p>

  <p>"Something that affects my husband's case?" Lady Barmouth asked
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I think it touches very deeply, indeed," Jack said gravely. "May I
  intrude on you for another five minutes? Mind you, I have said nothing about
  this to Lord Barmouth, because it seems to me to concern you alone."</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth led the way back to the small drawing-room again. Her eyes
  were fairly dancing with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It is about your sister," Jack said, "the sister whose photograph stands
  on the mantlepiece in your husband's room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, must we really go into that?" Lady Barmouth asked, with a shade cf
  coldness in her voice. "There are matters so sacred that even the most
  sincere friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Believe me, I am speaking under the strongest sense of duty." Jack urged.
  "Nothing else would induce me to speak. Lord Barmouth told me it was a very
  painful subject, but we must go into it."</p>

  <p>"It is a painful subject." Lady Barmouth murmured. "She was my youngest
  sister, and very dear to us all. I do not say she had no faults: indeed, she
  had far too many. But she was very lovable in spite of her headstrong ways
  and her quick fits of passion. She never got on particularly well with my
  father, who all the same cared for her very much indeed. She was sent at the
  age of seventeen from Southern Mexico, where we lived at that time, to finish
  her education in London. I don't know why, but it seemed to be assumed that
  she was the daughter of very rich parents, and that in the course of time she
  would inherit a great deal of money. Be that as it may, she contrived to fall
  head over heels in love with her music-master, and they ran away together and
  got married. We never quite knew the name of the man; however, it was
  something quite foreign, and, judging from what happened afterwards, probably
  was no more than an alias. My sister's letter to her father announcing her
  marriage was returned to her unread, and she was given to understand that she
  could no longer consider herself one of the family. That sorry scoundrel who
  brought so much unhappiness on the poor girl's head basely deserted her, and
  from that day to this I have seen nothing of the poor child."</p>

  <p>"She did not write to you, she did not communicate with you in any way?"
  Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"I have just told you that I have never heard of or seen the poor girl
  since. She was a proud as she was high-spirited, and after what had happened,
  would have died rather than appealed to any of us for assistance. But why do
  you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because I recognized in the portrait in question the features of one who
  I see practically every day of my life. There can be no question about the
  matter at all, Lady Barmouth&mdash;your sister has been for a long time
  Spencer Anstruther's housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"You astonish me; you move me more than words can tell. My sister in the
  house of that man? Do you mean to suggest for a moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not suggesting anything whatever that is wrong," Jack said
  earnestly. "For some time I have been trying to make a study of the poor
  woman who calls herself Serena&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is my sister's second name," Lady Barmouth interposed.</p>

  <p>"Yes! But I have not made much progress. It is quite evident to me that
  your sister has had a terribly stormy past. Not that her spirits are broken,
  for there comes ever and again in her face the look of one who is prepared to
  fight to the bitter end. All the same, she is absolutely under the domination
  of Spencer Anstruther; she watches his every movement: indeed, it is almost
  as if he had hypnotized her. But that there is anything wrong&mdash;oh, no.
  Anstruther simply regards your sister as one of his creatures."</p>

  <p>"I am quite unnerved by all you have to tell me," Lady Barmouth cried. "It
  has always been my prayer that may poor sister and myself should meet again,
  because I, for one, have never blamed her for that which, after all, is more
  her misfortune than her fault. She was very young at the time that she gave
  her heart into the keeping of that scoundrel, very young and very romantic.
  And goodness knows, she paid enough for her folly. I must see her at once.I
  will go with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not to Anstruther's house," Jack protested. "Think of the danger of
  it."</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Anstruther merely knows me as Lady Barmouth. He knows nothing of
  Lord Barmouth as Lord Barmouth. We can easily assume that I came to ask the
  character of a servant. Oh, do not let us wait! If you only knew how anxious
  I am to see Serena again!"</p>

  <p>Jack shrugged his shoulders and allowed the point to pass. At any rate he
  suggested that Lady Barmouth should possess her soul in patience a little
  longer. Usually the hours between five and seven were spent by Anstruther at
  his club, where he often indulged in a rubber of whist; indeed, he was very
  regular in this respect. Jack expounded all this to Lady Barmouth, who
  listened to him with more or less patience.</p>

  <p>"Let it be as you please." she said. "I am afraid you do not quite
  understand my feelings; still, you have been to good and kind and patient all
  through this miserable business that I am loth to do anything to mar your
  chances of success. Come and have a cup of tea with me, and then it will be
  time to start."</p>

  <p>It was a little after six before Jack and Lady Barmouth set out in the
  direction of Panton Square. They came to the house at length, and Jack rang
  the bell. Some little time elapsed before there was any response, and Jack
  rang again. He was getting slightly uneasy by this time: so many things had
  happened lately that therefore it was possible that something equally strange
  might have recently been enacted in Panton Square. He pulled the bell again,
  this time furiously.</p>

  <p>"It looks as if everybody was out." Lady Barmouth suggested.</p>

  <p>"And yet I fancy I can hear somebody," Jack said, with his eye on the
  keyhole. "I am sure that I saw somebody flit across the hall. Let us try
  again."</p>

  <p>Another furious peal at the bell brought a halting footstep, as if dragged
  unwillingly in the direction of the door, and then a voice inside faintly
  demanded to know who was there.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Jack asked&mdash;his fears had rendered him a little
impatient,
  "and what have you to be afraid of? Please open the door, I tell you
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is that really you, Jack?" the voice inside said in tones of deep relief.
  It was easy to detect that Claire was the speaker now. "I will open the door
  for you at once."</p>

  <p>There was a fumbling at the bolts and latch, and then the heavy portal
  swung back. Claire's face was very pale, her hands were trembling, and there
  was something like terror in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I hope nothing wrong has happened?" Jack said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Claire explained, "nothing what you might call really wrong."
  All the same, she was holding her hand to heart like one who has run fast and
  far.</p>

  <p>"It was not on my account that I feared; it was for Serena's sake."</p>

  <p>"Are you and Serena alone in the house?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. The other two maids have gone out for the day, and, as my
  uncle is dining at his club, I did not bother about a set dinner, and was
  going to have a small dish sent up for myself. A few minutes ago Serena came
  to me in a state of terrible agitation, saying that somebody had called to
  see my guardian. Though he was assured that Mr. Anstruther was out, and was
  not likely to return before it was time to dress for dinner, the man
  persisted in refusing to believe the statement. He pushed his way into the
  hall, and locked the door behind him, saying that it was his intention to
  search the house. He was so rude and overhearing that Serena was naturally
  frightened, and came to me. I hope you won't blame me unduly, but I was as
  frightened as Serena herself. I summoned up courage at length to face this
  man, but when I reached the hall I found that he had unlocked the door again,
  and had vanished. But not before he had been all over the house."</p>

  <p>"Was he rude, or did he use anything like violence?" Jack asked heatedly.
  "Oh, this sort of thing is abominable. Ask Serena to come here, and give me a
  description of the fellow. Then I will go off at once, and place the matter
  in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>So agitated and upset was Claire that she had entirely overlooked the
  presence of Lady Barmouth, who stood in the dim shadow of the hall listening
  to this amazing story. She went off now in the direction of the kitchen,
  where she seemed to be engaged in persuading the terrified Serena to come
  forward. The latter came presently, with a trembling, halting footstep, and
  Lady Barmouth shrank closer against the wall. The electric light had not been
  switched on yet, so that it was almost too dark to recognise the features of
  Anstruther's housekeeper. Jack rather wondered to see Serena so terribly
  upset. Broken as she was by misfortune, and dominated as she was by
  Anstruther's strong personality, she did not lack pluck and spirit, as Jack
  had seen on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have been subjected to a rather unpleasant experience." he
  said. "What class of man was the fellow who insisted on pushing his way into
  the house like this? A half-intoxicated workman, or some loafing
  rascal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing of the kind," Serena replied. She was getting her voice well
  under control now. "The man was dressed as well as yourself. Mr. Masefield.
  It was not his appearance that frightened me in the least, at least not his
  outward appearance. Nor was he in the least abusive or violent."</p>

  <p>"But tell us what he looked like," Jack said impatiently. "I want a
  description for the benefit of the police."</p>

  <p>Serena seemed to hesitate for a moment and a curious expression passed
  like a shadow over her worn, sad face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you will not laugh at me, you will not make fun of what I am going to
  say? It was not quite dark; in fact, there was plenty of light when I opened
  the door for the man. His hat was turned down, and his coat collar was turned
  up. As the door was thrown open, he lifted his hat to me with a natural
  courtesy that belongs to very well-bred man. And then I saw his face. It was
  exactly the same face as that."</p>

  <p>Serena broke off suddenly, as if her emotions were too strong for her. The
  front door had not yet been closed; the strong flare of a great arc light lit
  up the hoarding on the far side of the street. With a trembling hand Serena,
  pointed to the central poster on the hoarding. Jack started as he followed
  the direction of her shaking finger.</p>

  <p>"What!" he cried; "Nostalgo! Another Nostalgo! Do you mean to say that he
  has been here to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Serena said simply, "it is just as I have told you."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; IN THE SQUARE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK said no more for the present. He closed the front door
  quietly, not forgetting, however, to glance at the great clock, and stopping
  to calculate that a good half-hour must elapse before Anstruther returned. It
  would have been a great misfortune indeed if the latter had come home at that
  moment. In a mechanical kind of way Serena turned into the dining-room, where
  she proceeded to pull down the blinds and switch on the lights . At a sign
  from Jack, Lady Barmouth remained where she was for the moment, and
  Masefield, together with Claire, entered the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"I am bound to ask you a few questions," he said, turning to Serena. "For
  instance, I have yet to learn why the walking image of that poster should
  have frightened you so terribly."</p>

  <p>"It was Adolpho returned from the grave," Serena murmured. Apparently she
  was talking to herself. "Beyond all question poor Adolpho&mdash;" She paused
  in some confusion, and looked guiltily from Claire to Jack. The latter was
  not slow to take up the point "So you have actually seen the man before?" he
  demanded. "Well, we will not discuss that at present. A little later on
  perhaps I shall ask you to speak more freely. Meanwhile, I may as well tell
  you that I came here to-night with a lady desirous of seeing you."</p>

  <p>Serena was alert and eager in a moment. Jack could see that the fighting
  look had returned to her face; her eyes dilated strangely. She seemed to
  guess by some subtle instinct exactly what was going to happen. "My sister,"
  she whispered. Her voice was very strained and low. "Something tells me that
  my sister is here. I pray you, go away and get rid of her at once. Tell her
  any lie, invent any falsehood. If you have the slightest feeling for the most
  miserable woman in the world you will do this for me." "But it is too late,"
  Jack protested. "Lady Barmouth is with me; she is waiting in the hall at the
  present moment, and she has already seen your face." "But I do not
  understand, " Serena cried, stretching out her hands hopelessly. "I have but
  one sister whom I believe to be living, and her name is Grace. Lady Barmouth
  cannot possibly be anything to me." "Lady Barmouth is your sister all the
  same," Jack explained. "She married Lord Barmouth after you left home; she
  told me your sad story, and you must believe that she has been looking for
  you everywhere. Surely you would not punish yourself for that which was after
  all merely an act of girlish folly?" Serena covered her face with her hands
  and burst into tears. Her head fell forward on the table. Presently an arm
  stole about her neck. When she looked up again it was to meet the tender and
  softened gaze of Lady Barmouth. "And so we meet again like this after all
  these years, " Lady Barmouth said gently. "Oh, my dear Serena, how could you
  go off like that; how could you leave us all without a word or sign? Our
  father was a harsh man; his pride was his besetting sin, but he would have
  forgiven you and taken you to his heart again, if only you had returned to
  the old home. Didn't you suppose that I cared? And after all said and done,
  what is your crime? You trusted a man who was not worthy of your affection,
  and he deserted you because you lacked the money for which he married you. If
  that is a crime, then there are many thousands of poor women in the world in
  the same sad plight."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Jack and Claire had crept quietly from the room. It would have
  have been indelicate to remain there in he circumstances. Jack, looking at
  Claire, noted that the tears were also in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What a strangely pathetic thing," Claire murmured. "How did it come
  about. Jack?" Jack explained the story of the photograph, but Claire was
  hardly listening. It seemed such a strange, sad story to her, this pathetic
  meeting between the two sisters.</p>

  <p>"But you don't suppose that Mr. Anstruther knows?" Claire asked. "You do
  not imagine for a moment that he is aware of the fact that Serena is Lady
  Barmouth's sister?"</p>

  <p>"I hope to goodness no," Jack exclaimed. "But I don't see
  how the thing could be possible. To begin with, the sisters are not in the
  least alike, and in addition to this Serena had not the least idea that Lady
  Barmouth had married. What I am most afraid of now is that Anstruther should
  come back and discover those two women together." Claire nodded gravely, with
  one eye on the clock. It was only a matter of minutes now when Anstruther
  would return. He was dining at his club to-night, Claire explained, with Mr.
  Carrington at 8 o'clock, and as it was now quarter past seven there was not
  much time for him to dress and get back to to James Street again.</p>

  <p>"In that case I must intrude myself upon those two ladies," Jack said
  firmly. "I will put Lady Barmouth in a cab and send her home. It will be
  quite easy for the sisters to arrange a meeting at Lady Barmouth's house.
  Keep Anstruther out of the dining-room if he comes in. "</p>

  <p>Jack strode resolutely across the hall, and placed the matter tersely and
  vigorously before the sisters. "It would never do," he explained, "for
  Anstruther to find you here at this moment."</p>

  <p>Serena's eyes were swollen with weeping. There were the deep marks of
  tears upon her cheeks. Lady Barmouth's worldly training had stood her in
  better stead , but she also carried traces of emotion which could not be
  wiped out in a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am going to put you in a cab at once, Jack said. "Anstruther may be
  here any minute, and you can imagine how necessary it is to keep him in the
  dark. Besides, you can easily arrange a meeting n a safer atmosphere than
  this." With a brief remark to the effect that she would communicate with
  Serena again Lady Barmouth left the room, permitted Jack to escort her to a
  cab. The latter breathed more freely as the clatter of the horses' hoofs died
  away. He ran back quickly to the house again; to give a few last words of
  instruction to Claire.</p>

  <p>"You look all right now." he said, "but Serena's case is entirely
  different. Take my advice, and send her up to her room. If you are not going
  to dine in the proper sense of the word, there is no reason why Serena should
  appear again till Anstruther had gone to his club. And I will go too; I don't
  want our worthy host to know that I have been here this evening." Jack went
  off thoughtfully in the direction of the square. It was a particularly
  good-class neighborhood, and generally very quiet at this time of the
  evening. The half-hour past 7 had just struck from a neighboring clock. In
  most of the dining-rooms on the north side of the square brilliant lights
  demonstrated the fact that folk were at dinner. With the exception of a
  solitary policeman nobody was in sight. As is usual with the majority of
  London squares, the place was none too well lighted, and there were just
  sufficient lamps to throw the shadows of the garden in deeper relief. It had
  often occurred to Jack how easy crime and violence would be in circumstances
  like these.</p>

  <p>Jack's imagination was working freely now; indeed, it would have been odd
  if his brain had not been screwed to a high pitch by the events of the day.
  Coming toward him now, swinging along at a good pace, was a tall, slim
  figure, which seemed familiar to Masefield. As the figure paused under a lamp
  to look at his watch. Jack could see the figure was that of Anstruther. He
  congratulated himself upon the fact that he had got away from Panton Square
  before Anstruther returned. He crossed the road in a casual sort of way, and
  passed along under the shadow of the houses so that Anstruther had no idea
  how he was being watched.</p>

  <p>The latter paused again just by the entrance to the square gardens, the
  gates of which had not yet been locked, though it was considerably past the
  hour when the gardens were closed to the public. Anstruther stood there as if
  debating something in his mind, then suddenly another figure came like a
  lightning flash from inside the garden gates, and fell upon Anstruther with
  terrible swiftness. So sudden and unexpected was it that Jack could hardly
  believe the evidence of his own eyes. Anstruther gave one gurgling cry, his
  hands went up as if implore assistance, then he settled down to a fray which
  could only end in one fashion. It was impossible where Jack stood for him to
  make out anything more than the mere outline of the man the grimness of his
  intention: there was sinister design in every movement of his body. This was
  no common square thief, intent upon a paltry meed of plunder, but a man who
  had deliberately picked out his prey with the intention of mauling it to the
  death.</p>

  <p>All this passed as it were in the twinkling of an eye. Jack knew now that
  he would have to pull himself together and advance to the rescue. As he flew
  across the road be heard in a mechanical sort of fashion the heavy footstep
  of a policeman clanging on the quiet pavement some little way off. Here, at
  any rate, was aid fairly close at hand. But Jack was not the kind of man to
  wait in an emergency like this. Before he could cross the road he saw that
  Anstruther was prostrate on the pavement, with his assailant kneeling
  cat-like upon his chest. The man was evidently fumbling or something,
  probably a weapon of the noiseless kind, for Jack could see his right hand
  working in a hip pocket. With a headlong leap Jack fell upon the would-be
  assassin, and clutched him by he throat. At the same time a police whistle
  shrilled.</p>

  <p>Rut the man kneeling on Anstruther's chest was not taken aback for an
  instant. With a quick upward motion of his body he pitched Jack clean over
  his head, and, rolling off Anstruther's chest, darted like a snake into the
  gardens. By this time three policemen were upon the scene.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he is hurt much," Jack explained, as Anstruther
  scrambled to his feet and gazed wildly around him. "No damage done, eh?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther explained that he was none the worse for his adventure. He
  seemed to be under the impression that he had been the victim of some
  loafer's cupidity. He could give no description of his assailant: indeed, he
  said that he had no idea now but to get away and keep an important
  appointment. He tossed his card over to the police, and went coolly down the
  road.</p>

  <p>"We can get that fellow all the same," Jack said. "He is in the gardens
  somewhere. Suppose you three men stand round the square while I go inside and
  drive him out. One of you lend me a lantern."</p>

  <p>The quest was by no means a long one. At the fourth cast of the lantern
  Jack descried his man crouching down under a belt of laurels. He reached
  forward and dragged the fellow up by the neck.</p>

  <p>"I am a bigger man than you are," Jack said. "Do you come quietly, or are
  you going to take it fighting?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply the man raised his hat; his face was exposed.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to take it at all," he said. "You will be good enough to
  put the police off my scent and have a cab handy so that I can get away
  unseen. We have met before, sir."</p>

  <p>It was a fitting crown to a day of surprises. For the man who stood before
  Jack was the same Nostalgo he had conveyed in the guise of a dead body to
  Shannon Street police station.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; ON THE TRACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE man standing there showed not the slightest trace of
  alarm. There was just the suggestion of a smile on his face, as if he felt
  confident of his position. Jack could even see that he was fingering a
  cigarette case, as if he were thinking more about tobacco than anything else.
  He advanced a little nearer to his pursuer, and the suggestion of a smile
  broadened to a look of absolute amusement.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that we have met before," he said, with an accent that
  left no doubt as to his nationality. "But I have just reminded you of the
  fact. The question is, what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you are a very cool hand," Jack replied. "My obvious duty is to
  hand you over to the police for the attempted murder of Mr. Spencer
  Anstruther."</p>

  <p>"Instead of which you are going to do nothing of the kind," the stranger
  replied. "Besides, you are quite wrong. I am prepared to admit the assault on
  Mr. Anstruther, but as to murdering him? nothing of the kind. Besides, you
  know perfectly well you are consumed with curiosity to know all about my
  mysterious self."</p>

  <p>Jack smiled to himself despite the gravity of the situation. The stranger
  had hit off his thoughts exactly.</p>

  <p>"You are naturally anxious to know," he said, "what happened to me after
  you were good enough to escort my unconscious body to Shannon Street police
  station. I see you are a little dubious as to whether I am the right man or
  not; but if you looked at me carefully, you would see there is no mistake
  whatever."</p>

  <p>Jack advanced a few paces nearer the speaker, and surveyed him closely in
  the blinding light of the lantern. There was no doubt whatever that this was
  one and the same Nostalgo. There was a certain mark in the shape of a
  crescent scar on his chin, the same scantiness of eyebrow, and the same
  peculiar droop of the lids.</p>

  <p>"I am quite satisfied that you are the same man," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," the stranger cried, eagerly. "Of course. I know quite
  well that you are deeply interested in this Nostalgo mystery, and good
  fortune has placed you in the position to find out all about it. Get rid of
  those fellows, and call me a hansom. As a guarantee of good faith, here is my
  card. The address leaves a great deal to be desired, but I assure you my
  quarters are a great deal more comfortable than the locality would convey. If
  you have not yet dined, perhaps you would not mind partaking of my bread and
  salt."</p>

  <p>Jack did not hesitate a moment longer. It was, perhaps, playing it rather
  low down on the police, but it seemed almost a criminal folly to waste so
  golden an opportunity as this. If the man had been given in custody for the
  murderous assault upon Spencer Anstruther, there would be long and tedious
  investigations, which would not only delay the solution of the trouble, but
  perhaps scare away others who were more or less party to the mystery. After
  all said and done. Anstruther was not a penny the worse for his adventure,
  and no harm could be done in defeating the so-called ends of justice.</p>

  <p>"You stay where you are," Jack said, "and I will see what I can do for
  you. The police are on three aides of the square, leaving this side open to
  me. It is only a matter of a little, patience, and the thing is
  accomplished."</p>

  <p>Jack emerged cautiously into the road and looked about him. So far as he
  could see the street was deserted, though he could hear the constables making
  signs to one another on the other three sides of the square. Whilst he was
  still debating in his mind what to do, an empty hansom crawled toward him.
  Jack ran back and signed to the driver not to stop. "You can earn a sovereign
  if you like," he said. "Don't ask any questions, but do exactly what I tell
  you. Turn back, go just to the corner of the square, and then return slowly;
  when you are opposite the gates, pull up as if there was something the matter
  with your horse. Then a man will come out and jump into your cab. You are to
  drive him to the address which I am going to give you without any questions.
  Here is your sovereign, and now listen carefully to the address. That is
  all."</p>

  <p>Jack returned hurriedly to the gardens, at the same time whistling loudly
  as if he had need of assistance. It was not long before the three constables,
  guided to the right spot by the flash of Jack's lantern.</p>

  <p>"Now's your time." he whispered hurriedly. "There is hansom waiting for
  you by the gate, and the driver knows exactly what to do and where to take
  you. He is already paid his fare."</p>

  <p>The man Nostalgo smiled and vanished. It was an easy matter to satisfy the
  police that their quarry had eluded Masefield. and that he was still hiding
  somewhere in the gardens. Jack left them to their search presently under the
  plea that he had no further time to waste. He walked as far as Albany street,
  and there took a cab to Mare Street, Hackney.</p>

  <p>It was not a particularly desirable neighborhood, as the man Nostalgo had
  pointed out. The destination was a side street of great dingy houses, which a
  generation or two back had been inhabited by wealthy tradesmen and the like.
  Now the large houses had been cut up into small flats and tenements, and for
  the most part were occupied by artisans and the like. The gutter swarmed with
  children, disheveled-looking women stood gossiping on the doorsteps; round a
  flaming gin palace a group of loafers had gathered. It seemed to Jack high
  time to dismiss his hansom, for evidently vehicles of that kind were not
  frequent visitors to the street. More than one of the loafers lounging
  heavily against the greasy walls looked pointedly at Jack, but he was not the
  class of man to be tackled single-handed, and therefore he was allowed to
  proceed unmolested to No. 11, where he asked for Mr. James Smith.</p>

  <p>A surly-looking porter, evidently considerably the worse for drink,
  replied that Smith lived on the fifth floor.</p>

  <p>"Not that I have ever seen him," he growled, propitiated by Jack's
  half-crown; "sort of secretive chap, only goes out after dark and all that
  sort of thing. Shouldn't wonder if the police came and walked off with him
  any day; but that's no business of mine, so long as he pays his rent
  regularly and don't give no trouble. Keeps a couple of servants, he does; but
  they ain't English, and we don't have no truck with them."</p>

  <p>Unenlightened by this fragment of a biography. Jack made his way up the
  greasy staircase. There must have been scores of families living in the
  self-same house, for Jack could hear the cries of children, and an occasional
  oath from some angry man. He came at length to the fifth floor, the outer
  door of which was closed, and on this he knocked. He knocked a third time
  before the door was cautiously opened, and the sallow, almond eyed face of a
  Chinaman peered out. Apparently the Celestial was satisfied as to his
  visitor, for he merely bowed and stood aside so that Jack might enter. Then
  the door was closed again and locked. There was another door at the end of a
  dingy passage, the walls of which had not been papered for years; but a
  passage through this revealed a different state of affairs entirely.</p>

  <p>It was idle to inquire by what magic this thing had been brought about,
  but here, in this house of wretchedness and desolation, was a luxurious and
  comfortable home. In what appeared to be the hall was a remarkably fine
  specimen of Persian carpet. There were Moorish hangings, luxurious lounges
  and divans&mdash;the whole illuminated by a shaded lamp which depended from
the
  ceiling. Jack could see other rooms beyond, quite as luxuriously furnished.
  In one of them a table had been laid out with a fair white cloth, and on the
  snowy damask appeared to be what was a perfectly appointed meal.</p>

  <p>Jack could see the shaded lights falling on the flowers and silver, upon
  gold-necked bottles, and ruby wines in cut-glass decanters. A negro dressed
  like an English butler came silently from the room, carrying a sliver coffee
  service in his hand. It was a fairy kind of dream, coming as it did upon the
  edge of stern reality. Jack would have been surprised had he not been long
  past that emotion. As it was, he allowed the Chinese servant to relieve him
  of his hat and coat, after which he was escorted to a small room at the back,
  where his queer host was smoking something quite exceptional in the way of a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would come," he said. It was only when he stood up under
  the full light of the lamps that Jack could see what a fine figure of a man
  he was.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and try one of these cigars&mdash;dinner will not be ready for
  quite a quarter of an hour. You are rather surprised to find anything of this
  kind here, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Well, rather," Jack said drily; "you hardly expect Eastern palaces in the
  slums. I won't be vulgarly curious and ask why a man of your apparent means
  prefers to take up his quarters here, but what I want to know is
this&mdash;how on
  earth did you manage to get all this luxury and refinement here without
  arousing the suspicions of your neighbors? There are men&mdash;ay and women,
  too&mdash;under the same roof who would murder you cheerfully, if only to get
  hold of your silver coffee service."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's explained easily enough," Nostalgo cried. "My two servants are
  very faithful to me; they practically know no English, and when they go out
  they are dressed very, very differently to what you see them now. As to the
  rest, we smuggled the things here a few at a time, and we did the papering
  and upholstering between us. As to why I choose to live here&mdash;ah, that is
  quite other matter."</p>

  <p>The stranger finished with a stern abruptness that told Jack pretty
  plainly he was not expected to ask any further questions on that head.</p>

  <p>"You must know more about me presently," he said. "Meanwhile, I dare say
  you are curious to know what brought me lying apparently dead near Panton
  Square, and how my body disappeared from the police station. Of course, you
  suspect Anstruther of being at the bottom of the whole business; in fact I
  presume Lord Barmouth told you all about it."</p>

  <p>Here was another surprise, but Jack did not express it in words. He merely
  nodded, as if he took the whole thing for granted.</p>

  <p>"We will let that pass," h e said. "But why did Anstruther desire to have
  you put out of the way like that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was either Anstruther or myself," the stranger said coolly. To
  give you some idea of the feelings I entertain toward Anstruther. I will ask
  you to kindly look at that monotint over the mantlepiece. You may not believe
  it, but that picture represents me before I came under the baneful influence
  of the man we are discussing. Will you please look at it carefully?"</p>

  <p>It was barely possible to recognize in those handsome features the almost
  repulsive ugliness of Nostalgo. Perhaps he read something of this passing
  through Jack's mind, for he smiled with exceed bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I don't think I need much justification. You know all about that
  business in Mexico, but Lord Barmouth was not the only victim. I also was
  left penniless and mutilated, and I swore that, if ever fortune favored me, I
  would be even with Anstruther before I died. Fortune has favored me, and I am
  here with one set purpose before me."</p>

  <p>"To kill Spencer Anstruther?" Jack cried.</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, no," Nostalgo said; "do you suppose that I can think of no more
  terrible revenge than that? When you saw me holding that scoundrel to-night I
  had quite another purpose in my mind. If everything had gone well with me,
  London would have been startled to-morrow to hear of the strange
  disappearance of Spencer Anstruther. But you were good enough to prevent me,
  and I cannot blame you for that. But I am talking about myself, though you
  would like to hear more of other matters. I promised to tell you how I got
  away from Shannon Street police station. I expect my case puzzled the doctor,
  did it not?"</p>

  <p>"You puzzled him exceedingly," Jack said. "How did you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"I was shot in a peculiar manner, and with a peculiar weapon." Nostalgo
  explained. "The whole device was an invention of Anstruther's, in fact. I saw
  it in operation in Mexico. It is a kind of air-gun arrangement that propels a
  sort of poisoned bullet encased in celluloid. The bullet penetrates a part
  not necessarily vital, and dissolves there. There is practically no wound,
  the virulent poison in the bullet spreads all over the system and speedily
  does its work. But in my instance the shots fired were not fatal, for the
  simple reason that I am wearing a thin coat of highly-tempered chain
  mail."</p>

  <p>"But the doctor did not notice that," Jack exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Nostalgo made no reply for a moment; he seemed to be thinking about
  something else. His varying moods had not been lost upon Jack. He was stern
  and silent, then again happy and cheerful, and once more grim and sardonic.
  If he did not care to speak now, Jack had no desire to press him. He felt
  quite sure that the stranger had taken a liking to him, or he would not be
  enjoying his present novel situation. Nostalgo broke the silence at length as
  if he had suddenly realized that he was not alone.</p>

  <p>"You have not traveled much, I presume?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Jack replied. "Only the usual continental trips and all that kind of
  thing. Mine has been a very prosaic life up to now, and I have never found
  myself in the heart of a great adventure before. Now it seems to me as if I
  were going to have enough mystery to last me forever."</p>

  <p>"Ah, as Shakespeare says, 'There are more things in heaven and earth than
  are dreamed of in your philosophy.' Had you lived my life, and knew the world
  as I know it, you would not be astonished at anything. Probably, if you had
  read what I have told you in a novel of the sensational kind, you would have
  pitched the book aside with a laugh of contempt. And now, confess it, have
  you ever heard before of a decadent modern man walking about in a mail shirt
  and being plugged by mysterious bullets, and all this in the streets of
  London?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I confess that it does seem a little strange and outlandish," Jack
  admitted. "But when I come to think of it, and when I look at you, I can no
  longer hesitate. Some men are born for picturesqueness and adventure, and you
  are one of them. But all the same the doctor was utterly deceived."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; SERENA AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOSTALGO smiled and shook his head. The doctor had not made
  an examination of him at all: and he explained he had simply given him a
  cursory glance and pronounced that the whole thing had been fatal. No doubt a
  thorough examination would have taken place later on, only that the victim
  had returned to his senses,and, having his own reasons for secrecy, had
  escaped by means of the overhead light in the mortuary.</p>

  <p>"There you have the whole thing in a nutshell," he concluded. "It was
  fortunate for me that I knew exactly how to get away, for the simple reason
  that I had been keeping a close eye upon Anstruther's movements, and knew all
  about that hiding place in Montrose Place. To a certain extent, I made my
  escape through Montrose Place. There is only one thing I find that is
  difficult of explanation. Now I know for a fact that Anstruther was otherwise
  engaged on the night of that murderous attack upon me. Who, then, was it who
  fired the bullet?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is just possible I can enlighten you there," Jack said. "Did
  you ever chance to hear of a man called Padini?"</p>

  <p>The name conveyed nothing apparently to Nostalgo, who rose at the same
  moment and suggested that dinner was possibly ready. It was a well-served
  meal, cold for the most part, Nostalgo explaining that anything in the way of
  elaborate cookery had for obvious reasons to be done off the premises. It was
  possible to talk freely before the servants, who seemed to be entirely in
  their master's confidence.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about this Padini whose name you mentioned just now," the host
  said. "So far as I know, I have never heard the name before."</p>

  <p>"That is exceedingly likely, considering that Padini is only one of the
  many aliases. The man I mentioned is an exceedingly fine
  violinist&mdash;clean-shaven and artistic-looking, and perhaps just a little
  effeminate. On the stage he looks rather boyish, but i private life it is his
  whim to assume a moustache closely resembling that of the German Emperor. I
  know this as a fact, because I have met him wearing his moustache at the
  house of a man called Carrington&mdash;a rich bachelor banker who has a very
  elaborate establishment in Piccadilly."</p>

  <p>A heavy scowl crossed the face of Nostalgo.</p>

  <p>"So you know that sorry blackguard, do your?" he asked. "Upon my word, Mr.
  Masefield, you seem to have mixed up with a rare lot of scoundrels."</p>

  <p>Jack was politely incredulous; he had never heard anything to the
  detriment of Mr. Carrington; who was partner in a well-known city bank.
  Still, he remembered now that he had heard Carrington's name mentioned by
  Anstruther that time he was hiding in Montrose Place with Rigby.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am perfectly certain of my facts," Nostalgo cried. "It may be news
  to you, but Carrington's bank is on the verge of collapse. I know that,
  because they have &pound;30,000 of mine in their hands. I was acquainted with
  Carrington before I went to Mexico, and as good fortune favored me, I sent a
  great deal of my earnings to Carrington for investment. When I came home I
  called upon him one night and explained my altered appearance. He appeared to
  be fairly satisfied till I asked for my securities. Then the rascal showed
  himself in his true colors. He pretended to believe that I was an impudent
  imposter; he laughed my strange story to scorn, and refused to part with
  anything until I could prove my identity beyond question. He knew perfectly
  well that at the time I could do nothing of the sort, and there the matter
  stands for the present. I suppose that Carrington is a friend of
  Anstruther's?"</p>

  <p>Jack explained that Anstruther and Carrington were dining together at the
  former's club at that self-same moment. Nostalgo nodded, as if the
  information was not displeasing to him.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he cried. "Everything is going our way now. I will get you to
  accompany me on a little expedition presently. And as to this man you call
  Padini, I think I have a pretty good notion of his real identity. And now
  take some more of that wine, and let us discuss matters generally, apart from
  this wretched business. Let me try and make you forget what a physical wreck
  I am."</p>

  <p>A more entertaining companion Jack could not have wished for. His host
  seemed to have been everywhere and seen everything; he was a thorough citizen
  of the world, and a charming companion to boot. Jack was astonished to look
  up presently and see that it was already past eleven o'clock. Nostalgo
  followed his glance and smiled. He rang the bell and ordered coffee to be
  served at once.</p>

  <p>"Just one more cigar and a liquor," he suggested, "and then we must be
  off. Meanwhile, there are one or two things I must do in regard to my
  personal appearance. Like the modern plain young woman, I am compelled
  occasionally to resort to the beauty doctor. It is a case of where Nature
  fails Art steps in."</p>

  <p>So saying, Nostalgo passed the cigar box across the table and sauntered
  from the room. It was some half-hour before he returned, and when he did so
  he was changed almost beyond recognition. At the same time, the almost
  hideous ugliness had only given way to another form of repulsive feature.
  Nostalgo smiled sadly as he seemed to follow Jack's thoughts.</p>

  <p>"It is only a change after all," be said; "for change is something
  necessary. If you have quite finished, we are going to walk down as far as
  St. James's Street, where I will get you to go into Anstruther's club, the
  Salisbury, and ascertain if he and Carrington are still there. You can easily
  make an excuse to do that."</p>

  <p>"As it happens, there is no occasion to do anything of the kind," Jack
  said. "I am a member of the Salisbury Club. I will go into the dining-room
  and see if those men are still there; and if they have already gone, I will
  try and ascertain where. Come along."</p>

  <p>The Salisbury Club was reached at length, and Jack entered, followed by
  his companion. There was no reason why the latter should not come into the
  club, Jack urged. With his hat pulled down over his eyes nobody would
  recognize him or note anything peculiar in his appearance.</p>

  <p>The club was fairly crowded by this time, for the theaters had begun to
  empty, and members were trooping in the direction of the smoking and card
  rooms. The dining-room was still comparatively full, for though dinner was
  practically a thing of the past, a great many suppers had already been
  served. As Jack glanced carelessly about the room, he noticed Anstruther and
  Carrington seated at a table at the top. There was a third man with them, who
  had apparently just come in, for his opera cape was still about his
  shoulders. Jack touched his companion on the arm.</p>

  <p>"There our men are," he whispered, "and judging from the amount of wine
  upon the table, I should think there they are likely to stay. We are
  fortunate, too, in another direction. Please take note of that man in the
  opera cape&mdash;that is the man Padini. Perhaps, you can tell me if you
have ever
  seen him before."</p>

  <p>Nostalgo gave a queer and dry chuckle, and Jack could see that his eyes
  were burning under the edge of his hat.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right about our being in luck," he said hoarsely. "So you
  want to know if I am acquainted with the little man in the opera cape. I know
  the scoundrel perfectly. It seems to me that all the scores I have to pay are
  going to be wiped off in London. Now I think we will get on our way."</p>

  <p>Nostalgo strode away as if he had quite made up his mind what to do. Once
  outside he turned off in the direction of Piccadilly, walking so rapidly that
  Jack had some considerable difficulty in keeping up with him. The man had
  evidently something on his mind, for he was muttering to himself as if he had
  entirety forgotten his companion. He came out of his brown study presently,
  and laughed a laugh of grim amusement.</p>

  <p>"I am a little mad at times," he said in explanation of his queer conduct;
  "but you must not mind that. You have behaved exceedingly well to me, and I
  am taking you entirely into my confidence. You asked me just now if I knew
  Padini. I explained to you that I knew him very well indeed, but not under
  that name. He used to be with Anstruther all the time that the latter was in
  Mexico. Not that he is the class of man to care much for the rough life we
  led out there, because he is physically a great coward, though his cunning
  and craft are equal to those of his master. We knew him cut there for a very
  skilled performer on the violin, but I never expected that he would blossom
  out into a leading platform artist. I should have thought that the fellow was
  too lazy and too casual to tie himself down to a settled programme. But I
  dare say it is all part of some scheme of Anstruther's."</p>

  <p>"That I am absolutely certain about," Jack said. "Seeing that you have
  been so candid with me, I will be equally candid with you, and tell you
  something very strange. It has to do with Padini and his violin."</p>

  <p>Jack proceeded to explain at length the apparently strange coincidence of
  the items on Padini's concert programme and their simultaneous playing in
  Anstruther's study. It was a somewhat complicated story, and Nostalgo did not
  quite take it in at first. When he thoroughly grasped the situation, he was
  grimly pleased to pay a high compliment to Anstruther's ingenuity.</p>

  <p>"I think I can grasp the meaning of it," he said. "If Anstruther ever
  found himself in a tight corner&mdash;and he is very likely to before
long&mdash;he has a
  magnificent alibi. But here we are: just wait till I get my key out."</p>

  <p>To Jack's great surprise Nostalgo paused before the front door of
  Carrington's chambers, and proceeded to fit the key in the latch as if he
  were the master of the premises. Very coolly he pushed the door back and bade
  Jack enter.</p>

  <p>"But this is something like burglary." the latter protested.</p>

  <p>"Burglary or not, we are going in all. the same," Nostalgo growled. "You
  will see presently something that will surprise you. But stop&mdash;surely
there is
  some one coming down the hall."</p>

  <p>The hall light was a very dim one, so that it was impossible for the
  moment to determine the identity of the woman who came down the stairway
  toward them. She carried in her hand a candle, which had the effect of
  keeping her face half in shadow. It was evident that the woman had heard the
  key in the door, and had come down to see if her master required
  anything.</p>

  <p>Satisfied that she was mistaken, she set the candle down on the table. Her
  features were quite plain now&mdash;the sad yet defiant face of Serena. A
grasp
  like a vice was laid on Jack's arm, and his companion's voice whispered-
  hoarse in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Great heaven!" Nostalgo said. "And she is here. Oh, the villainy of it,
  the villainy of it!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">XXVII. &mdash; IN THE SMOKING ROOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE woman looked about her as if half expecting to see
  somebody there who had come with evil intent, Jack could not fail to notice
  the extreme nervousness and agitation of her face. She was no longer quiet
  and subdued, as be had been accustomed to see her in Panton Square; she
  seemed as if some force had drafted her there against her will. She advanced
  towards the table, and, taking up a hat and coat lying there, proceeded to
  put them on as if she had finished her task, whatever it was. If anything had
  frightened her it wag not, at any rate, the suggestion of burglars, for there
  was nothing of physical fear to be detected about her.</p>

  <p>So far as Jack could discern, his companion appeared to be equally
  disconcerted. But there would be plenty of time presently to learn what
  Nostalgo knew about Serena. Events were moving rapidly now, and Jack felt
  that he would have plenty to tell Rigby later on. They stood aside till
  Serena had left the house, making sure that the latch was down, and that no
  one could enter the premises without a key. Jack turned to Nostalgo with an
  interrogative glance.</p>

  <p>"The more we go into this thing," he said, "the more do we find one
  mystery piled upon another. Do you know that unfortunate lady?"</p>

  <p>"If you do not mind. I would much rather you did not press that question,"
  Nostalgo said, coldly. "I am going to help you all I can; I am going to do
  everything in my power both for your sake and mine; but there are some things
  which will not bear discussion, and this is one of them."</p>

  <p>Jack turned away, feeling just a little hurt and disappointed. He would
  have found it difficult to say why, but he had taken a strange liking to the
  man by his side, perhaps because the man was suffering more from terrible
  misfortune than from his own imprudence.</p>

  <p>"We will let it stand over for the present," he said, "but to be more
  candid with you. I am greatly interested in that poor woman. I have known her
  for a long time now, and, as a novelist, I am bound to say that she greatly
  fascinates me. She always strikes me as a woman who has been tamed&mdash;she
is to
  like a performing lion or tiger. If you will permit the simile."</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you mean." Nostalgo said. "The class of animal you
  speak of paces restlessly about its cage, a picture of moody discontent and
  more or less physical fear. And then the time comes when all the old savage
  instincts burst forth, and years of cruel treatment are avenged in the course
  of a moment."</p>

  <p>"And so it would be with Serena," Jack said. "I have seen her cower and
  tremble before her master; I have seen her hand him a knife in the humblest
  possible fashion. And I have seen her clench on the handle, and a gleam come
  into her eyes&mdash;on more than one occasion I have half expected to see
her lean
  over so as cut her master's throat from ear to ear. After this, perhaps, you
  may be disposed to say more on the subject" "We have never met, we have never
  been introduced," Nostalgo explained; "but I know who she is and all about
  her just the same. Do not press me more at present; tHe secret is not
  entirely my own. I can only tell you this: it was a great shock to me to meet
  that unfortunate lady to-night. But perhaps you know who she is?"</p>

  <p>"I know perfectly well who she is," Jack said, "though the knowledge has
  come to me quite recently. Up to a day or two ago I regarded her in the
  prosaic light of Anstruther's housekeeper. She has always interested me,
  because she has always seemed to be a kind of wild animal who had been
  cleverly tamed. I have seen her like a tiger ready to spring; I have seen the
  lurking demon of passion in her eyes, as if she could destroy Anstruther and
  rejoice in the deed. And then a word from him or a glance, and she has
  cowered as timidly as the wife of the veriest bully in the world."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't telling me who she is," Nostalgo said, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, she is Lady Barmouth's sister, to begin with," Jack said. "Now,
  perhaps, you may be inclined to be more communicative."</p>

  <p>Nostalgo shook his head in a sorrowful manner, and proceeded to lead the
  way upstairs. It was not lost upon Jack that his companion seemed to know his
  way about the house just as one who had lived there for some time. He even
  seemed to know where to lay his hand upon each electric switch; in fact, his
  familiarity with the surroundings was apparent to the meanest
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"One more word before we leave the subject," Jack said. "I showed you
  to-night the man who calls himself Padini. You recognised him as a man whom
  you had known in Mexico, and you left me to understand that he was as great a
  scoundrel as Anstruther, only that he lacked the necessary courage to carry
  his schemes into effect. Would it surprise you to know that Padini is the
  husband of the poor woman who bas just gone out?"</p>

  <p>Nostalgo shook his head with the air of a man who is not hearing anything
  for the first time. As he had intimated before, the secret was not his own,
  and he showed no inclination to go into the matter now. He led the way to the
  first landing, from which the living-rooms branched off. Here was the fine,
  spacious hall where Jack had found himself on the night he had met Rigby
  there; the big ferns and palms were still scattered about; the evidences of
  luxury were plain. Only a rich man could have occupied so fine a suite of
  apartments. Nostalgo smiled as all these objects of art and luxury met his
  eye.</p>

  <p>"All is not gold that glitters." he said; "In fact, nothing that glitters
  is gold. All this kind of thing would be calculated to impress any client who
  came along, but the British public is getting to understand the value of
  outside show. Let me see&mdash; this used to be the drawing-room in the old
days,
  when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nostalgo flicked up the lights, and there, bathed brilliantly by the
  flashing rays, was a room that would not have disgraced a palace. Carrington
  was a man of taste and feeling; his pictures were good, and his china would
  have fetched much money at Christie's. The lights were down again, and
  Nostalgo walked away in the direction of the dining-room. He might have been
  some contemptuous servant displaying his master's treasures to the admiring
  eye of a colleague. Everywhere the foot sank deeply into velvety carpets.
  Many fine sets of armor graced the corridor. There were one or two pictures
  of price here, also; a Corot, a dainty little Meissonier, a sketch or two
  from the brush of some other modern painters. Deeply interested as he was in
  the adventure, Jack did not fail to note and do justice to Carrington's
  taste.</p>

  <p>"A whited sepulchre," Nostalgo murmured. "It is a poor jewel, after all,
  that lives in this perfect setting. Now, here is the dining-room. What do you
  think of it&mdash;old oak and old blue china with Flemish pictures of the
  best schools? Elegant, is it not? You need not wonder why the women run after
  Carrington. But we will give them something to talk about presently."</p>

  <p>With the assured step of one who knows every inch of the way, Nostalgo
  moved on to a small apartment behind the dining-room. This was fitted in the
  form of a smoking room, with deep and cosy armchairs, and comfortable divans
  against the Moorish walls. The whole thing was Moorish, from the decorations
  on the walls and the wonderful brass lamps depending from the painted
  ceiling. At the far end of the room were two double stained-glass doors
  leading into a conservatory. The warmth here was grateful, and seemed to
  touch the senses drowsily. As to the rest, the conservatory was filled with
  masses of graceful feathery palms and ferns, beyond which was tier upon tier
  of red geraniums. The whole effect was wonderfully pleasing and artistic, and
  Jack did not hesitate to say so.</p>

  <p>Nostalgo was not so enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking so much about that," he said drily. "I was regarding
  this little garden more in the light of a hiding place. You and I are going
  to play the eavesdropper, my friend. It is not a congenial occupation I know
  but there is precious little of anything congenial about this business.
  Carrington will be here presently, and probably Anstruther will accompany
  him."</p>

  <p>"You are a bit of a detective in your way," Jack smiled.</p>

  <p>"The conclusion is only what any one would call obvious." Nostalgo
  replied. "In the first place, all the servants have gone to bed, or that poor
  woman whom we saw downstairs would not have been so careful to see that the
  door could not be opened without a latch-key. On the table behind you is a
  big silver salver with two glasses, a couple of syphons of soda water and a
  spirit stand. What conclusion do you come to than that Carrington is
  returning presently, and is bringing a friend with him?"</p>

  <p>"I quite follow you." Jack said, "but there is one thing I don't
  understand. How is it that you can find your way about this house in so
  familiar a manner?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is not so obvious." Nostalgo replied. "And yet the explanation
  is perfectly simple. Before I went to Mexico I was a friend of Carrington's.
  In those days his father was still alive, and he had not succeeded to so
  large a share of the business. As a matter of fact, Carrington and myself
  lived here together. He frequently discussed with me the improvements he
  would make here when once he was in a position to do so. The place where we
  are standing now used to be my dressing-room."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Jack that Carrington must have been a cool hand indeed, and
  he suggested something of this to Nostalgo."</p>

  <p>"Cool with the courage of despair," the other said. "The night I came home
  and called on Carrington here I thought he would have had a fit of apoplexy.
  Disfigured as I am, I am certain that he recognized me, but he was not slow
  to take advantage of my misfortunes. Directly he had recovered himself he
  became painfully polite, though he refused to acknowledge me as his quondam
  friend. You can quite see the point of that&mdash;so long as I could not
  prove my identity, he was able to keep me out of my property. But we have
  already discussed that point. And now you know why I am so familiar with the
  house, and how it comes about that I have a latch-key to fit the front
  door."</p>

  <p>Nostalgo was apparently prepared to say more, only his quick hearing
  detected a suspicious sound below. He strode swiftly across the room and
  switched out the light that had illuminated the room and the conservatory. It
  was an easy matter to find the hiding place amidst that tangle of ferns and
  flowers, and the two had hardly done so before the smoking-room door opened
  and Carrington came in, closely followed by Anstruther and Padini. The latter
  seemed to be terribly put out about something, for he flung his hat and coat
  upon the floor and dropped into a chair with an attitude of defiance.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you," he exclaimed heatedly. "We do all the work
  and take all the risks, and you walk off with the profit I tell you it is
  absolutely dangerous to work a scheme like ours from the Great Metropolitan
  Hotel."</p>

  <p>There was a sneer on Anstruther's face as he helped himself to a cigarette
  and poured out a carefully moderated dose of whiskey and soda.</p>

  <p>"You little rascal," he said. He had the air of a man who, having tamed
  lions, was now contemptuously engaged in subduing less noble animals. "If you
  talk to me like this I will let you down altogether. You cannot injure me,
  but I can ruin you, body and soul. Go to your kennel, you hound."</p>

  <p>Padini cowered before the flashing anger in Anstruther's eyes, and he
  muttered something to himself that might have been an apology; but the
  listeners were a little too far away to hear.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you," Padini whimpered. "You can call me a coward
  if you like&mdash;I am. It is not like you to run any risks at all. So long
as I am
  at the Great Metropolitan Hotel, so sure is there danger."</p>

  <p>"Send him off about his business," Carrington growled. "Why did you allow
  him to follow us here at all? He ought to have been in his own room by this
  time carrying on his share of the programme."</p>

  <p>"Well, give me a programme," Padini said, with some show of spirit "How am
  I to know what Anstruther wants unless he tells me beforehand? Is it to be
  nothing but Chopin to-night?"</p>

  <p>In the same way that one humors a spoiled child, Anstruther took a
  notebook from his pocket and jotted a few names upon it.</p>

  <p>"I think that will about do," he said. "Start with the 'Grand Polonaise,'
  and take the 'Fantasie in F' afterwards; then stick steadily to the programme
  I have marked on that sheet of paper."</p>

  <p>Padini rose obediently enough now and donned his hat and coat He would
  have helped himself to a small modicum of refreshment, only Anstruther put
  him sternly aside.</p>

  <p>"None of that " he said, "and not one spot of anything till you have
  finished your night's work. Now go at once."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">XXVIII. &mdash; THE LAMP GOES OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEANWHILE Carrington had been pacing up and down the room,
  obviously troubled and ill at ease. Anstruther watched him with a gleam of
  malicious amusement in his dark eyes. This strong man liked to feel that he
  had everybody in his power; it was good to him to know that he could move
  others as the man behind the curtain moves the puppets in a marionette show.
  It was not particularly that Anstruther cared for crime for its own sake, but
  he loved to be subtle and mysterious; it was a joy to him to get the better
  of his fellow creatures. Had Carrington but known it, the major part of the
  trouble which was racking his mind now had been brought about by the very man
  to whom he turned most readily in the hour of his misfortunes. He poured
  himself out a liberal dose of whiskey and gulped it down without the
  formality of adding anything to it. He flung himself angrily into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Now that that little ape is gone we can discuss my affairs," he said. "My
  dear Anstruther, I am the most desperate man in England to-night."</p>

  <p>"I think I have heard that remark somewhere before," Anstruther said
  cynically. "Most people talk like that when they owe twopenny-ha'penny they
  can't manage to pay. But tell me, are your affairs in such a state as
  that?"</p>

  <p>"They could not possibly be worse," Carrington said, moodily. "Since my
  father died practically all the financial side of the business has been left
  to me. Like the fool that I am, I was not content with the handsome profit
  that the concern was bringing in. I started speculating for myself, and I was
  unlucky from the start. I lost my head and plunged desperately, but that is
  not the worst of it. Not only is all the property at the bank mortgaged to
  its full value, but I have taken and disposed of securities belonging to
  clients. Every morning I go down to the bank I do so with my heart in my
  mouth. It only needs the smallest spark to fire the whole mine. I should not
  be surprised to find myself in jail to-morrow night. Now, you are a clever
  man, quite the cleverest man I have ever met&mdash;can you show me any way
out of
  the difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," Anstruther said presently, "clever men can do most
  things, but there is one thing in which they generally fail. They can't
  command money just when they want it. As you are perfectly well aware, I am
  as desperately hard up as you are yourself. If you could give me two or three
  days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But something must be done within the next eight and forty hours!"
  Carrington exclaimed. "For instance, there is that confounded affair at Lady
  Barmouth's."</p>

  <p>"But how does that concern you?" Anstruther asked.</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to that. You see, we have a great many
clients&mdash;ladies&mdash;
  who keep their jewels with us. Take the case of the Duchess of Plymouth, for
  instance, and Admiral Scott's widow. But those are only a few1 of many. Now I
  know perfectly well that all these ladies will be round the day after,
  to-morrow to obtain their jewels, for the purpose of wearing them at Lady
  Barmouth's masked ball. Not to put too fine a point upon it, they won't get
  their jewel because they are not there."</p>

  <p>"Mortgaged or sold?" Anstruther asked, curtly.</p>

  <p>"Mortgaged to the utmost penny. You can imagine my feelings every time the
  door of my private office is opened and I am told that a client wishes to see
  me. I cannot for the life of me see any way out of it. Nothing less than a
  quarter of a million of money would set me on my feet again."</p>

  <p>Anstruther smoked thoughtfully, his brows knitted into a frown. It was
  some time before he spoke, Carrington watching him with sickening anxiety.
  There was something pathetic in his belief in Anstruther's ability to get him
  out of this terrible position.</p>

  <p>"There are more ways of doing it than one," Anstruther said presently. "In
  this instance we can take a hint from the daily papers. Supposing that the
  bank was mysteriously robbed&mdash;the safes forced open and all that kind of
  thing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the whole thing exposed in twenty minutes." Carrington said
  bitterly. "The robbing and gagging of cashiers has been slightly overdone
  lately. I can't call a single case to mind in which the scheme has not fallen
  to the ground. Take the case of those stolen bank-notes, for instance. And
  even supposing that nothing could be proved against one, there is always a
  large section of the public ready to regard the trouble as nothing more than
  a mere swindle. An affair like that would be the finishing touch; It would
  ruin the bank's business utterly."</p>

  <p>"And incidentally save your skin," said Anstruther, significantly. "Oh,
  no; this is going to be a much more artistic affair than that. If you could
  get me a plan of the bank premises, including the safes and the cellars and
  all that kind of thing, I believe I could hit upon a scheme ingenious enough
  to deceive the police and gain you the sympathy of the British public."</p>

  <p>Carrington shook his head wearily. He had expected something much more
  brilliant and original from Anstruther than this.</p>

  <p>"The plan you want would take days to prepare." he said, "to say nothing
  of the fact&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Carrington Jumped to his feet joyfully. His moody face cleared, and
  something like a smile shone on his features. "What a fool I am!" he cried.
  "Why, I have the very thing on the premises; in fact, I have two copies. It
  was only a few months ago that the bank premises were thoroughly restored and
  a fresh set of strong-rooms added. I feel positively certain that in my safe,
  here I have two sets of tracings of the architect's plans. I'll get them for
  you. Only I hope you won't make the same blunder over this business as you
  did at the affair of the man whom we will call Nostalgo Seymour."</p>

  <p>Anstruther laughed unpleasantly. Jack's companion, listening intently from
  his hiding place amongst the ferns, gripped his companion by the arm.</p>

  <p>"That's me," he whispered, with almost a suppressed chuckle. "I am th man
  they speak, of as Nostalgo Seymour."</p>

  <p>Jack pressed the arm of his fellow conspirator by way of acknowledgment.
  He was far too interested in what was going on inside the brilliantly-lighted
  room to care to talk; indeed, he had forgotten the presence of his comrade
  altogether. He could see that Anstruther had risen to his feet and was pacing
  the room, evidently nettled by Carrington's remark.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be friends, don't mention that matter to me again." he
  said. "It is the one failure of my life. To get Seymour out of the way is
  imperative. I trusted the matter to Padini, and be failed me."</p>

  <p>"I would have trusted nothing to Padini." Carrington said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you would," Anstruther growled. "Especially if he had done so
  many artistic jobs in the same line for you. But I did not know,
  unfortunately, till too late, that the little rascal has been drinking more
  lately than was good for him. The fact is, he has lost his nerve. And yet he
  might have felt himself justified in believing that his mission had been
  attended with complete success&mdash;but go and get your plans. I will have
a good
  look at them now, and I will call to see you to-morrow at the bank as if I
  came on business, and you shall show me all over the premises. It will be
  surprising, indeed, if I cannot show you some safe way out of the present
  difficulty."</p>

  <p>As Carrington went off jingling a bunch of keys in his hand, Jack could
  feel the man whom we will now call Seymour fairly trembling with excitement.
  It seemed more then once as if he was bent on darting from his hiding place
  and confronting the two scoundrels in the inner room. But evidently he was
  placing great restraint upon himself, for he turned to Jack and patted him
  reassuringly on the shoulder. At the same instant Carrington returned with a
  large roll of tracing paper in his hand. There was an agitation about him
  scarcely warranted by the circumstances of the case. It was as if he had seen
  something dreadful daring his brief absence. Anstruther looked at him with
  some scorn.</p>

  <p>"What a face!" he growled. "If you go down to the bank looking like that
  you will have a run on the concern in half an hour. No ghosts about here, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," Carrington said hoarsely: "but it is something I have
  found in the corridor. It was lying on the floor close by the dining room
  door. Tell me, have you ever seen it before?"</p>

  <p>With a shaking hand Carrington laid a small silver-mounted moleskin
  tobacco pouch on the table. At the same moment Jack noticed that his
  companion had given a great start. There was no need for Jack to be told that
  the tobacco pouch in question was Seymour's property, and had bean dropped by
  him accidentally a little time before.</p>

  <p>"Why, you don't mean to say that belongs to Seymour?" Anstruther cried,
  and there was a real anxiety in his voice. "Yes, you are quite correct; I
  distinctly remember Seymour buying this peculiar pattern of filigree silver.
  Now you see why I wanted to get that fellow out of the way. I have tried to
  believe that he was dead and gone, but not only is it quite evident that he
  is very much alive, but also it is equally plain that he has been here
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Carrington fairly shook as he hoarsely muttered his opinion that
  Anstruther was right. He glanced timidly about him, as if expecting to meet
  the face of Seymour; he stepped toward the conservatory, as if suspicious
  that the crimson flowers were hiding his enemy there. Then he gave a shaky
  half-laugh at his own fears.</p>

  <p>"My nerves are all rags to-night" he said. "Positively I imagined that I
  could fee that dreadful scarred face of Seymour glaring at me from behind the
  bank of geraniums. Call me a coward if you like, but I must really ask you to
  turn up the light in the conservatory. I dare not do it myself."</p>

  <p>Something like a curse broke from the rigid figure by Jack's side. From
  overhead there dangled an electric light swinging on a long, pliable flex. An
  instant later, and there would come a brilliant blaze of light if Anstruther
  could have reached the switch toward which he was contemptuously strolling.
  An instant later, and the eavesdroppers would have been discovered; but
  Seymour rose grandly to the situation. With one bound he was across the floor
  of the conservatory, and literally tore the switch from its place. Instantly
  the fuses connected with the two rooms short-circuited and the brilliant
  light of the inner room was swallowed up in the throat of a great velvety
  darkness. The thing was so swift, so clever and so unexpected that Jack could
  only gasp. He was conscious of the fact that Seymour had left his side, but
  only for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Confound the light!" Carrington cried. "Give me a match, and I'll light
  the lamps. This is the second time lately the same thing has happened."</p>

  <p>The feeble spurt of a vesta made a tiny blue flame, but it was sufficient
  to show Carrington the position of two silver lamps. He lighted one of these
  and then the other, and placed them on the table. As he did so his face grew
  white again, his tongue began to stammer.</p>

  <p>"The plans," he gasped. "Surely I put two on the table? Where is the
  other?"</p>

  <p>"The other," Jack's companion whispered, with a hoarse chuckle of triumph,
  "is quite safe in my breast pocket."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">XXIX. &mdash; THE SILVER LAMP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE wonderful coolness and audacity of his companion filled
  Jack with admiration. He had forgotten for the moment that there was any
  danger at all. It seemed to him to be a good thing to have so adroit and
  cunning a colleague to work with. The whole thing had been so wonderfully
  swift; hardly moment seemed to elapsed between the extinguishing of the light
  and the return of Seymour with the duplicate of the plan safely in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>What he proposed to do next, Jack could not guess for the moment, neither
  did he much care. At the same time, he felt quite convinced of the fact that
  Seymour had some deep scheme in his mind. Jack's spirits rose in quite an
  unaccountable way. He warmly congratulated himself on the fact that he had
  found Seymour and brought him into the campaign against Anstruther. The
  danger was by no means over yet, as Seymour must have recognised: but that
  did not seem to trouble him too much, for he was shaking now with suppressed
  mirth, and was evidently enjoying the situation as one does a screaming farce
  from a comfortable place in the stalls.</p>

  <p>Jack was about to whisper something of this to his companion, when the
  latter checked him with a touch on the arm. Inside the room, in the
  comparatively moderated light of the lamps, Jack could see Carrington fussing
  about uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I tell you that there were two plans," he muttered. "I am absolutely
  certain there was a duplicate. If you have played any kind of trick upon me I
  hope you will confess it at once."</p>

  <p>"Trick be hanged," Anstruther cried contemptuously. "Do you suppose that I
  indulge in practical joking? I say you have made a mistake; the duplicate
  plan is somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"And I am equally certain that it was with those papers," Carrington
  blustered. "They were lying side by side a minute ago. And now one of them is
  gone, and you want me to believe that it has been spirited away by unseen
  hands&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to believe anything of the sort," Anstruther replied.
  "Not a minute had elapsed between the time that the light went out and the
  moment that I lighted the match. What a nervous, frightened fool you are. You
  will be saying next that Seymour is concealed somewhere in the room, and
  snatched this brilliant opportunity for purloining these papers. Really, we
  are getting on. Hadn't you better look round the house. You will have to go
  to bed presently, and I should advise you to lock your door."</p>

  <p>All this brutal sarcasm was utterly lost upon Carrington. He was as
  frightened and nervous as a lonely woman in a lonely house who has discovered
  some strange man there. He darted from the room followed by Anstruther's
  contemptuous laughter, and returned presently, saying that he had made a
  thorough search of the flat.</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly nobody is on the premises," he said. He was by no means
  convinced yet that Anstruther was not playing some cunning trick upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"It is most extraordinary. You may say what you like, and prove what you
  like; but I am ready to swear that I brought both those plans into the room
  with me five minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh, look up the chimney," Anstruther growled. "Take all of those plans
  out of your conservatory, and see if the thief hasn't vanished up the water
  pipe. I am sick of all these nervous fears and hysterical suspicions. It has
  always been the curse of my existence that I can never lay hands on an
  accomplice who is anything but a knave or a fool."</p>

  <p>Without heeding the savage outburst Carrington took one of the little
  silver lamps from the table, and, holding it up by its crystal receiver,
  advanced cautiously in the direction of the conservatory. Jack held his
  breath, and prepared for the worst. He felt pretty sure now that he and
  Seymour would be discovered. Not that he much minded, except that he was
  extremely anxious not to be recognised by Anstruther; but that risk had to be
  run. It was a pity, too, seeing what a marvelous amount of information had
  been gleaned during the last half-hour; but that was all part of the
  game.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible he has vanished through the skylight?" Anstruther
  sneered.</p>

  <p>Carrington muttered that there was a drop of some thirty feet outside the
  conservatory. He still advanced with the lamp in his hand, and peered about
  him with an anxious face. The moment was a critical one indeed, and Jack
  wondered if Seymour's wonderful fertility of resource would be equal to the
  occasion. In the dim light of the lamp he saw Seymour's right arm steal out
  and his sinewy fingers close upon a piece of hose pipe attached to a tap in
  the wall. Evidently this had been used for watering the flowers. The gardener
  responsible for the well-doing of the rooms doubtless understood his work,
  and watered each pot separately, instead of spraying the whole place
  indiscriminately; for attached to the hose-pipe was the small nozzle meant to
  convey a fine jet for some distance.</p>

  <p>Jack began dimly to understand what Seymour meant to do. It was going to
  be a dangerous experiment but danger was quite absolutely necessary if the
  eavesdroppers were to were to escape unrecognized. If Seymour's plan was
  absolutely successful then there was the chance of them
  getting away without their presence there being indicated at all.</p>

  <p>Jack saw the lean, brown hand stretch forth and turn on the tap in the
  wall. Then the tap at the end of the hose slid round, and a tiny spray of
  water, fine as a needle and strong as the arrow from a bow, struck the
  chimney of the lamp, now nearly red hot, and a tremendous smash of cracking
  glass followed.</p>

  <p>Carrington staggered back, and a kind of hysterical scream broke from his
  lips. With his nerves strung at high tension, the shock of the bursting
  explosion rendered him nearly mad with terror. Seymour turned off the tap
  again, feeling sure his business was well done.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that was wonderfully smart, and quickly done," Jack whispered to
  his companion. "I rather pride myself upon the ingenuity of my stories,
  especially as regards the plots of them, but I never could have thought of
  anything quite like that."</p>

  <p>"Not bad." said the other one quite coolly. "It was all a matter of
  accuracy of aim and steadiness of hand. But to a man like myself, who has had
  vast experience of big game shooting, a little affair like that is a mere
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"But you might have missed," Jack said. "The deviation of that spurt of
  water by even so much as a hair's breadth would have carried it full into
  Carrington's face. and then our presence must have inevitably been
  discovered. That is where the dramatic side of it appeals to me."</p>

  <p>"It appealed to me also," Seymour whispered coolly. "But I had only to
  imagine that the lamp was the face of a famous old man-eating tiger who
  nearly did for me four years ago in Upper Burma. If we had been discovered,
  we should have had to have fought our way out; but I think you will agree
  with me that I have managed the affair in a much more artistic way than
  that."</p>

  <p>Jack agreed cordially. He was watching now with breathless eagerness to
  see what was the full measure of Seymour's success. Carrington had staggered
  back with a startled cry, though even as yet he did not know the danger that
  was to follow.</p>

  <p>"By heaven, you have done it well!" Jack muttered.</p>

  <p>"I think I have," Seymour whispered complacently. "It occurs to me that I
  have not left much to be desired."</p>

  <p>It was done even better than be had anticipated, for a few drops of the
  cold water had trickled down the receiver of the lamp and mingled with the
  oil there. From, all parts of the brass-work around the flame a blue, fiery
  vapor rushed out. With a cry of dismay Carrington almost threw the lamp upon
  the table; it tottered and fell sideways, and an instant later a stream of
  burning oil was flowing over the table-cloth, and dripping in long tongue's
  of flame upon the carpet.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's take, be careful, you clumsy coward!" Anstruther cried.
  "You'll have the whole place on fire; those lamps are very pretty to look at,
  but dangerous to use."</p>

  <p>But Carrington was not listening at all. He seemed to have lost his head
  entirely. But, frightened as he was. he did not fail to notice that the
  liquid flame was licking the other set of plans which were lying on the
  table. Just for an instant his mind was clear enough to see the necessity of
  saving the papers. He leaned forward and made a clutch at them. Something hot
  and stinging seemed to be gripping him by the fingers; he snatched his hand
  back again and dragged the table-cloth, more than half of which was in
  flames, to the floor. Crash fell the second lamp. Its crystal receiver
  smashed by the fall, and in the twinkling of an eye the whole room was in
  flames.</p>

  <p>So sudden, so swift and unexpected was the whole thing, that Jack could
  only gasp. He was so lost in admiration of Seymour's quickness and coolness,
  that he quite failed to realize the danger in which he and his companion
  stood. Less than a minute had elapsed since Seymour put his scheme into
  execution, and yet already the smoking-room was one mass of lambent
  flame.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have done it this time." Anstruther yelled. "Clear out at once
  or there will be no occasion for me to trouble about either of us any
  further. Give an alarm; go out in the street, and yell for the fire
  engine."</p>

  <p>Carrington needed no second bidding. Together with Anstruther he raced
  down the stone staircase and into the street. Jack could hear his companion
  chuckling with triumph and delight.</p>

  <p>"Rather a close thing that," he said coolly. "And how we had best look to
  ourselves. No chance of making a dash through those flames without being
  badly burned; besides, I have no doubt there is some other way out of it.
  Push those windows to, Mr. Masefield; there is no reason why we should be
  suffocated here."</p>

  <p>By closing the windows leading to the smoking-room, which was now a
  roaring mass of flame, it was possible to cut off the heat and smoke for a
  moment, and perhaps gain sufficient time to discover another means of
  retreat.</p>

  <p>But this was easier said than done. With the aid of a match or two,
  Seymour found the window at the back of the conservatory, which opened
  outwards. So far as he could see there was a drop of something like thirty
  feet into a kind of alley at the back of the flats.</p>

  <p>"We shall have, to wait our chance," Seymour said. "There are several more
  flats in the building, and no doubt there will be plenty to do for the
  firemen later on. In all probability, Anstruther and Carrington are mixed up
  in the crowd which you may be quite sure has collected by this time. Shall we
  wait on events, or shall we open the window and yell for assistance? We can
  pretend that we were cut off by the fire."</p>

  <p>On the whole, Jack thought it would be better to wait. They were quite
  safe for the next quarter of an hour, at any rate, and in that time much
  might happen.</p>

  <p>"It is worth risking." he said. "What a great thing it would be if we
  could get away from here without those men knowing that anybody had been on
  the premises. Suppose we try our hands as amateur firemen. There is plenty of
  water here."</p>

  <p>But Seymour did not think it would be worth while. A hose and pipe as
  small as that which they had at their disposal would not be likely to be of
  much use in dealing with the roaring tornado of flame behind the closed
  glass, doors. The conservatory, too, was getting intolerably hot, but that
  discomfort was avoided by opening the window. There was just the outline of a
  leaded balcony to be seen above the arch of the conservatory; then, greatly
  to Jack's delight, he saw the movements of some figures below, and then a
  ladder was slowly raised until it rested against the leads of the
  balcony.</p>

  <p>"That is for the benefit of the people upstairs," Seymour suggested.
  "Possibly they cannot make the inhabitants of the upper flats hear what's
  going on. So the ladder is quite clear by this time. I expect those firemen
  have got in through a window somewhere. Push this window back, and see if you
  can reach the ladder."</p>

  <p>It was a comparatively easy matter to reach the ladder, as Jack found to
  his great delight They slid rapidly down and found themselves at length in
  the alley without anybody being a penny the wiser.</p>

  <p>"Well, of all the lucky chances," Jack exclaimed. "We are well out of
  that. Let us go round to the front and see what is going on there."</p>

  <p>A great crowd had assembled in front of the burning flat The red outlines
  of a couple of engines could be seen; beyond the crowd there was a sound and
  regular rush of pumping water; and presently the crowd seemed to understand
  that the danger was over. Jack touched his companion's arm, and called his
  attention to the fact that Carrington and Anstruther were standing within
  earshot of them.</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do now," asked the latter.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall go off and stay at the Great Metropolitan. No, you need not
  come along&mdash;I have had about enough of your company for to-night."</p>

  <p>Carrington called a hansom, and was whirled away. Seymour smiled in a
  significant manner.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be as well," he suggest "that you also found it convenient
  pass the night at the Great Metropolitan. Padini is there, too, and it is
  possible that you may&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Right you are," Jack said eagerly. "Then I can call upon you in the
  morning and report progress. Good-night"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">XXX. &mdash; BEDROOM 14</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK had not waited to ask any more questions; he had felt
  quite sure from Seymour's manner that the latter had some great scheme in
  hand. It was was pleasant and exhilarating to feel that a man of Seymour's
  wonderful fertility and courage should be enlisted on his side. Masefield was
  not without hope that the discoveries of the night were not yet complete. He
  strolled away in the direction of the Great Metropolitan, turning these
  things over in his mind.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that the clerk in the office of the mammoth hotel
  regarded him somewhat suspiciously, seeing that he had arrived without
  luggage of any kind, but a deposit of a sovereign soon set the matter right.
  It occurred to Jack as good idea to secure a bedroom as near s possible next
  to that of Carrington. The hotel was not particularly busy, he discovered,
  for nobody had come in inquiring for bedroom accommodation during the last
  hour. This was a discovery in itself, for it testified the fact that
  Carrington had not yet arrived.</p>

  <p>It was nearly an hour before he came, and then he appeared in a desperate
  hurry. Discreetly Jack remained in the background, but he was close enough to
  hear Carrington arguing and protesting that he must have a certain room. The
  matter seemed to be settled amicably at length, and Carrington took the key
  and departed. Jack strolled across to the office again. He had decided on a
  bold policy. "I am going to ask you to give me another room." he said. "I
  want to be as near as possible to the gentleman who has just gone up-stairs.
  I think if you do as I ask you it may save the hotel trouble. What was the
  number of the room?"</p>

  <p>The clerk was friendly enough, and inclined to talk. Was it a police
  matter? he asked. Jack responded gravely that he was not in a position to say
  too much, but his mysterious manner had the desired effect, and the exchange
  was made.</p>

  <p>"I haven't put you exactly next to the gentleman," the clerk explained.
  "You see our bedrooms are on a sort of cubical system&mdash;corridors down
  both sides and the bedrooms back to back, if I may so express it&mdash;with a
  ventilating grating between them for the sake of air. The gentleman's bedroom
  is 28, therefore your room, exactly behind it, is No. 14. I hope I have made
  myself plain."</p>

  <p>Jack replied that the thing was perfectly clear. Indeed, the system was in
  considerable vogue on the Continent.</p>

  <p>He lingered a little longer in the big lounge hall, where he smoked a
  cigarette or two, so as to give Carrington time to get to bed. It occurred to
  Jack, in an idle kind of way that perhaps Carrington was deceiving Anstruther
  or why had he not come straight to the hotel. Instead of that, he had
  evidently gone off somewhere in a desperate hurry, and had returned at length
  to the hotel looking very exhausted and agitated. Jack pondered this matter
  in his mind as he went up to his own room.</p>

  <p>It was a comfortable enough bedroom, for the Great Metropolitan was noted
  for the luxury of its appointments; indeed, the room was fit for anybody. The
  lighting was exceedingly efficient; even over the bed was a pendant,
  evidently intended for those who cared to read after they retired to rest.
  Jack smiled as he noted the elaborate dressing-table and wash- hand-stand, to
  say nothing of a huge winged wardrobe, which was almost as big as a bedroom
  itself. Behind this wardrobe, fairly close to the ceiling, was the open
  grating which formed a ventilating shaft between one room and the other one
  behind it.</p>

  <p>Jack carefully closed the door, and with the aid of a chair managed to
  climb to the top of the wardrobe. He found that the grating was constructed
  on the swivel principle, very like a big cheval glass, to that by tilting it
  slightly it was just possible to see into the next room.</p>

  <p>In the room aforesaid the lights had not yet been turned down, so that
  evidently Carrington had not gone to bed. The watcher could hear him
  impatiently pacing the room and muttering to himself from time to time. The
  muttering was exceedingly incoherent, but from the gist of it Jack seemed to
  make out that Carrington was expecting somebody. On the far side of the room
  was a wardrobe very much like the one upon which Jack was perched, except
  that it had large plate-glass doors which reflected practically everything
  that was taking place inside the room.</p>

  <p>Jack could see Carrington now, lounging in a comfortable armchair and
  impatiently turning over a great mass of papers which lay on a table before
  him. On the table also was a box of cigars, flanked by two glasses and the
  necessary ingredients for the manufacture of whiskey and soda. There could be
  no longer any doubt about it, Carrington was expecting a friend. So far as
  the watcher could see, there was no hurry. He was quite prepared to sit up
  all night if necessary, and had no feelings of delicacy in listening to what
  the two scoundrels were going to say&mdash;provided always that the expected
  visitor was a scoundrel, of which Jack had very little doubt.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, his whole mind strained to attention. It seemed to him
  hat he could hear the sound of music somewhere. To his trained ear there was
  something familiar in the method of the player. Jack wondered where he had
  heard that finished execution before. Then it suddenly flashed upon him.</p>

  <p>"How stupid," he muttered to himself. "I had quite forgotten that Padini
  was here. That is Padini, without a shadow of a doubt, carrying out the
  programme that Anstruther made out for him."</p>

  <p>The music was not far off; it seemed to Jack that he could almost hear the
  scraping of the bow. It was not lost upon him. however, that the whole of the
  pieces were Chopin's compositions. The music ceased presently with a sudden
  twang, much as if the E-string had violently parted. A moment later, by the
  aid of the friendly mirror, Jack saw Carrington's door open, and the figure
  of Padini come in. Carrington glared at the intruder.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by keeping me waiting all this time?" he growled.
  "Didn't you get my telephone message?"</p>

  <p>"And hadn't I got my work to do?" Padini retorted. "I dare say you
  consider yourself to be an exceedingly clever fellow, but once you elect to
  match your wits with Anstruther, you will find yourself a lost man. It is no
  use you being in a hurry; as a matter of fact, I should have kept you a full
  hour longer, only I have broken my E-string, and I don't happen to have
  another one on the premises."</p>

  <p>With an angry gesture Padini threw his violin on the table. In a
  mechanical sort of way Carrington looked at the severed string. He was always
  a suspicious man, for it was an axiom of his never to trust anybody, and he
  was wondering now if this were not part of some dodge being worked out by his
  visitor. His face grew a little anxious as he held one end of the broken
  string between his thumb and finger.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you call this a simple fracture," he said. "String worn out,
  and all that kind of thing. If you will look at it carefully you will see
  that it has been half cut: you can actually see how far the knife has
  gone."</p>

  <p>Padini examined the string carefully. His face also had grown a little
  gray and anxious.</p>

  <p>"It is exactly as you say, my friend," he exclaimed. "But I wonder how
  that was done, and why. It is not as if I left my violin about&mdash;one is
not so
  careless with a genuine Amati like mine. I brought the fiddle back with me
  from my afternoon recital, and I am prepared to swear that there was nothing
  the matter with it then. I locked it up in my box, and there it stayed till a
  couple of hours ago. Now what does this mean? Does anybody suspect us? Has
  Anstruther's clever scheme come to the knowledge of anybody? The police,
  perhaps, might have discovered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The police have nothing whatever to do with that," Carrington said
  angrily. "What have any of us done to bring ourselves within the reach of the
  law&mdash;at present? The man that we have most to fear is Seymour. How you
  came to let him slip through your fingers the other night is an absolute
  mystery to me."</p>

  <p>Padini shrugged his shoulders, and something like an oath escaped him. By
  aid of the friendly mirror Jack obtained a perfect view of his face. It was
  white and sinister; the dark eyes gleamed like living coals.</p>

  <p>"But Seymour must be dead," the violinist said hoarsely. "We know he is
  dead; did we not read it in the papers? It may be that some friends stole his
  body for purposes of their own, but dead he is. If I thought he was still
  alive, I should have to leave London; I dare not stay here with a horror like
  that hanging over me."</p>

  <p>"You are absolutely wrong," Carrington cried. "Seymour is still alive; he
  is still in London, thirsting for vengeance. He is rich, he has the courage
  of a lion, and the mind of a Machiavelli. You smile, my friend, but it is the
  smile of a thoroughly frightened man. Seymour is after you; he is after me.
  Look at this. Don't say you fail to recognize it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is his tobacco pouch," Padini faltered.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I thought you would recognise it. And where do you suppose I found
  that to-night? In my own room, lying on the floor. Do you want any greater
  proof than that, that Seymour was working in my own rooms to-night?"</p>

  <p>Padini nodded moodily. Jack noticed how his hand trembled as he helped
  himself to the whiskey and soda.</p>

  <p>"I am sick of this," he muttered. "I mean to get out of it&mdash;I am as
anxious
  as you are to get outside Anstruther's influence. That is why I am here
  to-night. I am going to tell you my plan&mdash;call it murderous and
  treacherous if you like&mdash;which is the only way of settling Anstruther's
claims
  upon us. If you have any pluck at all&mdash;if there is anything of the man
about
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. no," Carrington faltered. "I tell you I dare not."</p>

  <p>As the speaker broke off. Jack was conscious of something like an
  altercation outside his door. The night porter was protesting that something
  or other was not his fault; the other man's voice was equally sure that it
  was. It did not require much intelligence to discover that the newcomer
  wanted that particular room. With a thrill Jack recognized the voice of
  Anstruther. In and instant he had made up his mind what to do. Like a flash
  he came down from the top of the wardrobe, switched on the light over the
  bed, and proceeded softly to unlock the door. There was a knock on the panel
  at the same moment. Jack glanced hastily round, and bundled one or two of his
  belongings into the wing of the wardrobe. He had barely time to conceal
  himself there, before the handle of the door turned and Anstruther
  entered.</p>

  <p>"You can see it is exactly as I said," the latter remarked. "I engaged
  this room an hour ago. It is quite evident that no other guest has taken this
  apartment. If he were here, surely there would be a portmanteau, or a
  dressing-case, or something of that kind. Take this half-sovereign, and say
  no more about it. If there is any fuss I will take the blame."</p>

  <p>The man departed; the door was locked behind him, and a moment later Jack
  could feel the heavy form of Anstruther climbing to the top of the
  wardrobe.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">XXXI. &mdash; A CHANCE ENCOUNTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was impossible, boxed up as he was in the stuffy
  atmosphere of the wardrobe, for Jack to hear anything of what was going on in
  the next room. But it was pretty easy to guess what was the meaning of
  Anstruther's strange intrusion. There was only one thing for it. and that was
  to possess his soul in patience and hope that Anstruther had no intention of
  spending the night there. It was perfectly obvious that he had come only with
  the intention of bearing what was taking place in the next room. It was
  impossible for anybody possessed of ordinary intellect not to admire
  Anstruther, whose brilliant qualities could not be ignored. Even now, excited
  as he was, Masefield could not repress his admiration for the man he both
  feared and disliked.</p>

  <p>It really was a marvelous thing that Anstruther should be so soon upon the
  track of the man with whom he had parted on friendly terms not an hour ago.
  Was this the result of some perfect system of spying, or was it that
  Anstruther's wonderful instinct led him to believe that Carrington was ready
  to plot against him whilst professing to act upon his advice? Masefield had
  plenty of time to ponder this question, for the figure on the wardrobe above
  gave no signs as yet of having had enough of it. Nor was Jack's situation
  rendered more pleasant by the knowledge that he might have to pass the night
  in a perpendicular position and half stifled by the stuffy atmosphere of the
  wardrobe.</p>

  <p>But there was always comfort in the knowledge that Anstruther's main
  object was to hear the conversation in the next room. It might possibly last
  not much longer; at any rate, Carrington would have to go to bed some time,
  and the sooner the better.</p>

  <p>An hour passed. An hour which seemed the whole of a long night came to an
  end at length, and then there was some sound, as if of a body cautiously
  moving overhead. Jack drew a long breath of relief, or at least as long a
  breath as was possible, considering his stifling surroundings. The critical
  moment had arrived. Had the conference next door finished, or was it merely
  an interlude? Jack wondered. He had been bound to push the door of the
  wardrobe open a little, and now he saw a long slit of light. which told him
  that Anstruther had turned up the lamps again. He could hear the latter
  pacing the room in a restless kind of fashion, and muttering to himself as if
  he were not entirely satisfied with what he had heard.</p>

  <p>Jack, greatly daring, ventured to push the wardrobe door open slightly
  further. He caught the side view of his enemy as the latter sat moodily on
  the bed, with apparently no intention of removing his clothing. It was quite
  within the bounds of possibility now that Anstruther, having satisfied
  himself, would leave the hotel altogether. A moment later and Jack saw his
  conclusion was the right one. Anstruther turned toward the door.</p>

  <p>"No reason to stay here any longer," he muttered. "I'm as tired as a dog.
  I suppose my nerves are not what they used to be, or perhaps I am growing
  old; at any rate, this sort of thing tells upon me more than it used to.
  Certainly that half-sovereign of mine was well laid out. Oh, you contemptible
  pair of rascals&mdash;so you think you are going to get the best of Spencer
  Anstruther. We shall see. And as to Padini&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker shook his fist in the direction of the next room, and walked
  quietly in the direction of the door. Jack could hear the key turn in the
  lock. He felt a suggestion of draught as if the room were now open to the
  corridor. The next instant the lights vanished, and Anstruther had left the
  room. Jack crept out into the comparatively pure atmosphere, and wiped the
  moisture from his forehead. He preferred to remain in the darkness till he
  made up his mind what to do. Looking up in the direction of the ventilator,
  he could see that the lights were now extinguished in Carrington's bedroom.
  This was plain evidence of the fact that the conference was concluded, and
  that there was no occasion to stay any longer.</p>

  <p>"I'll get out of it too." Jack muttered to himself. "It is only a matter
  of forfeiting my sovereign, but what I have learned is cheap at the price;
  but I shall have to be cautious."</p>

  <p>It was perhaps fortunate for Jack that a somewhat large rush of late
  guests came into the hotel at the same moment. Most of them were racing men
  returning from a big meeting up north. Anyway, the servants appeared to be
  particularly busy, so that Jack felt that he could slip away without any
  suspicions as to his movements. He waited just a moment till the corridor was
  practically empty, then sauntered towards the head of the stairs with the air
  of a man who has just come in.</p>

  <p>He had practically reached the big square landing, when a bedroom door
  opened cautiously, and a man's face peeped out. It occurred to Jack that
  possibly this man was looking for something, or that he was going to deposit
  his boots outside, or something of that kind. But the stranger, who was about
  half-dressed, did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he raised his finger
  in a mysterious manner, and then beckoned deliberately to Jack. He did not
  appear in the least agitated; on the contrary, his expression was one of
  caution and mistrust. Jack, thinking that it might have been a little play of
  fancy on his part, would have moved on, only the stranger stepped briskly
  outside and touched him on the arm.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can do for you? Jack asked politely. "I suppose your
  bell's gone wrong, or something of that sort; I am quite at your
  service."</p>

  <p>"Will you be good enough to step inside my room?" the stranger said. "The
  request will probably strike you as being somewhat out of the common, but I
  really have something important to say to you."</p>

  <p>As was quite natural in the circumstances. Jack hesitated for a moment.
  Like most people, he had heard and read a great deal about strange hotel
  outrages, and it occurred to him now that he might have been chosen for the
  victim of one of these. Possibly the stranger was mad, or possibly he was
  suffering from alcoholic excesses. But Jack felt more assured as he carefully
  examined the features of the stranger. Ha was a tall, slim chap, who palpably
  was recovering from some dangerous illness. It was either that, or he was far
  gone in consumption. Jack could see that the mere act of standing there was a
  weariness of the flesh; he noted also the attenuated arms, which at one time
  or another must have been exceedingly powerful, for the sinews and muscles
  seemed to hang upon the bones just like rags.</p>

  <p>But it was the face of the man that attracted Jack's attention most. It
  was long and lean and pallid: there were thin strips of plaster skilfully
  bandaged about the eyes and mouth, and down the sides of the long hawk-like
  nose. Still, behind it all, there was even the suggestion that this man was a
  sportsman and an athlete. Jack seemed to know by instinct that his new
  acquaintance was a man who had passed much time in warm climates. He began to
  wonder if the stranger had laid violent hands upon himself. It was very
  strange to see all that mass of plaster, as if the face had been carved in
  some grotesque fashion with a knife.</p>

  <p>"Do please come inside for a moment," the stranger pleaded. "I assure you
  I mean no harm, and our conversation may result in a wonderful deal of good.
  You evidently regard me as a kind of lunatic. Well, in some respects,
  perhaps, you are right; but there is a good deal of method in my
  madness."</p>

  <p>Jack still hesitated. The stranger sighed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I see I must be candid with you," he said. "I am taking a great risk, but
  I am trusting you because I never make a mistake about a face. You have been
  closeted for some time in the same room with Spencer Anstruther, but that you
  are an accomplice of his I feel sure is impossible. Now will you come inside
  my room?"</p>

  <p>Jack hesitated no longer. He strode into the room and his new acquaintance
  closed the door behind him. The apartment was furnished half as a sitting-
  half as a bed-room. A fire burned in the grate, an invalid armchair was
  pulled up to one side of it. There was plenty of proof, also, of the fact
  that the occupant of the room was an invalid. Herr were bottles with
  chemists' labels; here were some cotton wool and a case of surgical
  instruments. In one corner of the room was a small iron bedstead, which was
  obviously placed there for the use of a male nurse.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," the stranger said, as if reading Jack's thoughts.
  "As a matter of fact, there is no reason why you should have accepted my
  invitation at all&mdash;one hears of so many strange things happening in
these big
  modern hotels. As you imagine, I am just recovering from a dangerous illness,
  the result of a very delicate operation. But we need not go into that. What
  you are dying to find. out is how I know all about Spencer Anstruther."</p>

  <p>"I confess I am a little curious on the point," Jack said dryly. "You are
  taking a great risk when you mention his name and assume that I am no friend
  of his."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't be with a face like yours," the stranger replied. "A dupe,
  perhaps, or a man he was making use of, but never one of his infamous gang.
  And yet you were in that room with him a long time to-night."</p>

  <p>Jack hesitated a moment before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said. "You have been fairly candid with me, and in return
  I will be as candid with you. Anstruther is a great scoundrel, and it is to
  my interest and to the interests of those I love that the man should be
  exposed and rendered harmless for the future. Now, how did you know that we
  were in the same bedroom together?"</p>

  <p>"That is easily explained," said the other. "My male nurse was suddenly
  called away this evening on important business. I have been feeling so much
  better the last day or two that I decided to do without a substitute. Mind
  you, I knew perfectly well that Anstruther was frequently in the habit of
  spending an occasional night here. And I had my own reasons for keeping out
  of his way. But something happened to my bell to-night, and I had to go to
  the top of the corridor and use the bell there. It was quite by accident that
  I saw you enter bedroom No. 14, and it was quite by accident, also, that I
  heard Anstruther demand to know why he could not have the same room. I
  listened with curiosity, because the thing struck me as very strange. It
  struck me as stranger still when I heard Anstruther say that the room was
  empty, and saw him close the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"A kind of vanishing trick," Jack smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. if you like to put it that way," the other said. "It was
  either one of two things&mdash;you were there as an accomplice, which I
refuse for
  one moment to believe, or you had hidden yourself in the room for the purpose
  of watching Anstruther. In fact, seeing that circumstances were going for
  you. you laid a neat little trap for Anstruther. Have I not guessed it
  correctly?"</p>

  <p>"Your deductions are perfectly sound." Jack said. "I deliberately chose
  that bedroom with the full intention of overhearing what was going on in the
  room behind. When I heard Anstruther come in, I hid myself in the wardrobe
  and stayed there till he left the room. Now I have told you all that has
  happened so far as I am concerned. It is your turn to be communicative."</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly sorry to appear discourteous," the stranger said; "but I
  am afraid I cannot tell you very much. The mere mention of Anstruther's name
  always throws me into a kind of terror. I may be able to help you later on,
  but for the present I am bound to silence. But tell me now, do you see any
  likeness between Anstruther and myself?"</p>

  <p>The question was asked with an eagerness that struck Jack as being far
  beyond the necessity of so simple a query. The speaker seemed to fairly
  tremble for Jack's reply.</p>

  <p>"There does not begin to be any resemblance," he said. "The question
  strikes me as being a strange one. And now let me ask you a question. From
  what you say, you appear to know Anstruther exceedingly well. Now, did you
  ever notice his likeness to anybody? You have seen him when he has been
  greatly moved to passion, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The stranger shuddered, and turned away his head.</p>

  <p>"That is sufficient answer for me," Jack said. "I dare say you have
  noticed those strange Nostalgo posters. Did it ever occur to you that
  Anstruther is not unlike those pictures?"</p>

  <p>The effect of the question was extraordinary. The stranger looked at Jack
  with eyes filled with terror.</p>

  <p>"Strange, very strange," he muttered hoarsely. "You have hit it exactly.
  May I ask, have you ever been in Mexico?"</p>

  <p>"No," Jack replied; "but I know a man who has. Did you ever meet an
  individual out there called Seymour?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">XXXII. &mdash; LADY BARMOUTH'S JEWELS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK had merely drawn a bow at a venture, but the shaft went
  home to the feather. By instinct he seemed to divine the fact that the
  stranger who knew so much of Anstruther's inner life might also know as much
  as the man called Nostalgo, otherwise Seymour. This instinct did not play
  Jack false, for he saw his companion stagger back as if he had been shot. He
  fell into a chair, and plucked feebly at the arms of it with his fingers.</p>

  <p>"You are on dangerous ground indeed," he said hoarsely. "Have you a wife
  depending on you, or one you love? If so turn your back upon me at once, and
  never see my face again."</p>

  <p>It was a warning deep, thrilling and impressive. But Jack merely shook hit
  head and smiled. H e had no intention of turning back now.</p>

  <p>"I know too much or too little," he said. "Mr. Seymour is by way of being
  a friend of mine&mdash;in fact, I was the means of doing him a great service
the
  other night. But I see from the expression of your face that you know all
  about that "</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Seymour in the daylight, just as he is?" the stranger asked
  eagerly. "You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean perfectly well." Jack replied. "I have seen Seymour
  just as he is. To make another shot, I have also seen Lord Barmouth just as
  he is."</p>

  <p>The stranger sat bolt upright in his chair, and regarded Jack with grim
  satisfaction; "This is good news indeed," he said. "I am pleased to find out
  that I am betraying no secrets in my conversation with you. What I want you
  to do is this&mdash;I want you to arrange a meeting between Seymour and
myself. It
  will be dangerous for me to leave the hotel at present, so that you must
  arrange it in a way that Seymour can come here."</p>

  <p>"If you will be good enough "to tell me your name," Jack suggested. "It is
  just possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The stranger shook his head, and hoped that Jack would not deem him guilty
  of being discourteous if he withheld his name for the present He took from a
  desk a small, curiously-designed ring, and passed it across to Jack.</p>

  <p>"I think you will find that all that is necessary," he explained. "If you
  will take that ring and say that if came from the owner, I am quite sure that
  Seymour will be willing to fall in with my wishes. And now, I will bid you
  good-night, sir. It is good to know that we have a man of your courage and
  intelligence on our side."</p>

  <p>So saying, the stranger rose to his feet and extended his long, slim hand
  to Jack. He intimated that Jack might come and see him from time to time, but
  that caution would be absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>"Ask for Jabez Smith," he said. "That is the name under which I am known
  here. If you only knew how fortunate a thing it is that we have met to-night!
  But Lord Barmouth and Seymour will be able to prove that to you presently.
  Once more, good-night."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind Jack; be heard the click of the lock, and found
  himself alone in the corridor. He could see that there were still many people
  smoking and chatting in the big lounge below. The great hall door was not yet
  closed, so that it was possible for Jack to slip into the street absolutely
  unnoticed. He felt restless and excited, and absolutely devoid of any desire
  to rest. Sleep in the circumstances would be out of the question. It was no
  use going home, there to toss and fret all night. It was just possible, too,
  that Rigby had not yet left <i>The Planet</i> office, as it was barely 1
  o'clock. Anyway, a walk in the cool night air was bound to prove
  invigorating. It did not much matter, however, whether Masefield saw Rigby or
  not. He could tell him all this exciting history in the morning.</p>

  <p>But Rigby was still in his office, waiting for a proof, after which he
  declared he meant to go to the Press Club for supper. It was an entertaining
  supper, for Jack's narrative was piquant enough, as he had so much to
  tell.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have had a night of it." Rigby said enviously. "Who are you
  that you should have all the luck like this? Here have I been all the
  evening, doing nothing to earn the approval of my proprietor, whilst you have
  been getting a t the heart of the mystery. I shall have to divide my fee with
  you, Jack."</p>

  <p>For a long time they discussed the matter in all its bearings. What seemed
  to interest Rigby more than anything else was the scheme proposed by
  Anstruther to get Carrington out of his serious position. He saw great
  possibilities now that the plan of the bank premises had come into the
  possession of the man Seymour, especially as the conspirators were unaware of
  this.</p>

  <p>"We ought to be able to make a good thing out of this." he said
  thoughtfully. "Of course, it will all have to be worked out very carefully;
  but I should like to catch those fellows in the trap they have laid for
  others. After all, it makes no difference to you how Anstruther is got out of
  the way, so long as he receives a good dose of penal servitude. That once
  being done, we shall be able to work quite openly, and it is evident that
  your new friend Seymour can expound the whole of the Nostalgo business. I
  shall get my special article for <i>The Planet</i>, after all; but it will be
  more thanks to you than to my own efforts."</p>

  <p>"Well, you needn't tell Van Jens that," Jack laughed. "Give me the outline
  of your scheme."</p>

  <p>"I want to force Carrington's hand. I want him to understand how desperate
  his situation is, so that he and Anstruther must take action at once. Now,
  for instance, you tell me you heard "Carrington say to-night that his bank
  has a great amount of jewelry in its keeping. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"They had it in their keeping." Jack said drily.</p>

  <p>"Well that is exactly what I mean," Rigby responded. "And Carrington is in
  mortal terror lest some great lady should come along at any moment and demand
  her gems. You will remember telling me that Carrington was especially
  apprehensive over the great masked ball which is coming off at Lady
  Barmouth's in two days' time. Do you happen to know any of the titled women
  who are asked? If you could get one of them to go round to Carrington's
  to-morrow and ask for her gems, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see exactly what you mean," Jack cried eagerly. "We should force the
  hands of those two scoundrels, and compel them to do something without delay.
  By so doing, also, we should upset the delicate schemes of Anstruther?"</p>

  <p>"You have get it exactly." Rigby murmured. "Can you bring this about? It
  should be easily done."</p>

  <p>"I don't see very well how I can do it myself," Jack responded. "But
  Claire knows a great many of these people, and I should think she would not
  have the slightest difficulty in doing what we need. Anyway. I'll so round
  and see her to-morrow morning, and tell her exactly what has taken place. Is
  it all that time? Really. I must go to bed and try and get some sleep.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>After all, youth will be served, even in the way of sleep: and Jack was
  surprised to find on waking next morning, that it was nearly ten o'clock. It
  was nearly twelve before he knocked at the door of the house in Panton Square
  and asked to see Claire. It was Serena who answered the
summons&mdash;Serena, gray
  and silent and subdued in the morning light. All the same, she gave Jack one
  swift, furtive glance before her eyes sought the floor again.</p>

  <p>"I will go up to the drawing-room myself." Jack said. "So you are none the
  worse for your last night's adventure, Serena? Come, you need not look at me
  like that, and pretend not to understand. What were you doing in Mr.
  Carrington's late last night?"</p>

  <p>A sound like a sob broke from Serena, but she answered nothing.</p>

  <p>"If you only knew how profoundly sorry I am for you," Jack said softly.
  "When the time comes, you will have to speak; and when the time comes we
  shall deal with you as kindly as possible. Although you refuse to speak now,
  you must not believe otherwise than that. We know everything. We know, for
  instance, where you were last night, and we have nothing to learn as to the
  deaf mute and he young man who has a fancy to wear his moustache in the same
  form as the style affected by the German Emperor."</p>

  <p>Serena listened, with her eyes fixed mutely on Jack's face. It seemed to
  him that she was bursting with anxiety to speak, but that some strange force
  held her tongue and checked her utterance.</p>

  <p>"Do not go too far," she said presently. in a strained, hard whisper. "Not
  that I mean to threaten you. Believe me, I am all on your side; but I dare
  not speak. You may call me coward if you like: you may say that I have no
  nerve or courage; but if you had gone through the hell that my life has been
  the last few years, you would wonder, that I had the strength of mind to look
  even the feeblest fellow creature in the face."</p>

  <p>Just at the moment when it seemed to Jack that 8erena was likely to take
  him into her confidence, she turned abruptly away, and disappeared in the
  direction of he kitchen. Jack went slowly and thoughtfully up-stairs to the
  drawing-room, where he found Claire with her hat on ready to go out. It was
  clear that she had not expected him, but her welcome was none the less warm
  for that.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I shall have to detain you a little time, dearest," Jack
  said. "A great deal has happened since I saw you yesterday, and I think you
  ought to know most of it. Sit down a moment, please."</p>

  <p>Claire sat by her lover's side, and listened intently to the strange story
  that he had to tell. It was clear from the expression of her blue eyes that
  she was a little fearful for her lover. She clutched his arm impulsively, and
  he responded to the touch. It was not difficult for him to realise what was
  passing in her mind.</p>

  <p>"You need not have any anxiety as far as I am concerned." he said. "Very
  fortunately for us, those scoundrels have not the least idea that we know so
  much of their movements. But what I came here especially for this morning was
  to ask you if you knew anybody going to Lady Barmouth's dance whose jewels
  are in the keeping of Carrington's bank? I think I explained Rigby's point to
  you. Do you know anybody who could help us?"</p>

  <p>"I know one who could help you who is not very far off, dear old boy."
  Claire smiled. "You seem to have forgotten that I am rather an important
  person in my small way. Did I never tell you of the jewels that my
  grandmother left me?"</p>

  <p>"I declare I had quite forgotten them," Jack said. "I never care to
  associate you with money, especially as I have so little of my own. Diamonds,
  weren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Diamonds and sapphires," Claire explained. "They are really almost unique
  in their way. I generally keep them, on the advice of my guardian, with Mr.
  Carrington. Let us go round there now and ask for the gems."</p>

  <p>It is not exactly what Jack had meant, because it occurred to him that
  Carrington might easily vamp some excuse so far as Claire was concerned, and
  then get Anstruther to invent some reason why the jewels were not
  forthcoming. Still it might do, and there was no reason why they should not
  try it.</p>

  <p>"I was going really to see Lady Barmouth," Claire explained. "But I can
  can call in there as we return from the city. Let us have a hansom at
  once."</p>

  <p>Provincial Bank were reached at length. There was nothing inside or
  outside the place to denote that the concern was trembling to the verge of
  bankruptcy. Mr. Carrington was not busy, a polite cashier informed them, and
  he would be pleased to see Miss Helmsley at once. Jack followed in behind
  Claire, and he could not but be impressed by the ease and assurance of
  Carrington's manner. The latter did not show the slightest signs of agitation
  when Claire explained her presence there.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "You have come, of course, provided with your
  guardian's signature. No? I am afraid we cannot dispense with that formality.
  Send it on by messenger, and one of our own clerks shall bring the jewels
  round. What a delightful morning it is! Good-by."</p>

  <p>Jack accepted his checkmate cheerfully enough. It was exceedingly adroit
  and clever on Carrington's part and some other method of forcing his hand
  would have to be adopted. Jack was bowing himself out, when some one else
  came sailing into the room; and, to his great delight, Jack recognized Lady
  Barmouth. He divined at once what she had come for and what her errand was
  .</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, all of you." she cried, gaily. "Mr. Carrington, you will
  not thank me for disturbing you this time of the day, but as I happen to be
  passing this way I thought I would save trouble. Will you be so good as to
  hand me over my jewels?"</p>

  <p>Carrington made no answer. His face was pale as ashes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">XXXIII. &mdash; GEMS OR PASTE?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a dramatic moment, especially for Claire and Jack,
  who fully appreciated the peril in which Carrington stood. The fact was not
  hidden to them that Carrington's excuse to Claire was but an ingenious way
  out of a terrible difficulty. On more than one occasion Claire had herself
  fetched her jewels from the bank, but no objections had been raised. Still,
  Carrington was clearly within his legal right, and Jack could not but admire
  the swiftness with which he had got himself out of the tangle. His own face
  was a model of absolute indifference; he just glanced at Claire to see if she
  expressed any suspicion. But Claire smiled in a way so natural and artless
  that Jack had no fears of her for the future.</p>

  <p>With Lady Barmouth, however, it was quite a different matter. As yet, she
  knew nothing of the terrible straits in which Carrington found himself
  involved. She had come down for her jewels in the ordinary way, as she had
  done many times before, and expected to take them away with her. Carrington
  affected to be talking to somebody down the speaking tube, but in reality he
  was fighting to gain time and work out some ingenious excuse. Jack enjoyed
  his dismay with a feeling of grim satisfaction.</p>

  <p>But Carrington was not quite done with yet; evidently he had not sat at
  the feet of Anstruther for nothing. He looked up presently, and smiled with
  the air of a man who is only too willing to do anything for his client.</p>

  <p>"Will you take a seat for a moment Lady Barmouth?" he said politely. "I
  see that you know Miss Helmsley and Mr. Masefield. I must go and speak to our
  cashier for a moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You cannot get the jewels yourself?" Lady Barmouth asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Carrington explained. "Of course, we are bound to take precautions.
  I have no more power to open one of the safes by myself than one of my junior
  clerks."</p>

  <p>"That would be awkward if you wanted anything out of bank hours." Jack
  suggested. "How do you manage then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we simply don't manage," Carrington said. He was quite himself
  again by this time. "I can no more get into the strong room than you could. I
  should have to get the manager and chief cashier before a safe could be
  opened."</p>

  <p>All this sounded plausible enough, as Jack was bound to admit. Carrington
  went off with a jaunty step, as if he had all the millions of the Bank of
  England behind him. Jack wondered bow he would get out of the mess. But the
  solution of the puzzle was quite easy. Carrington came back with a look of
  annoyance on his face.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly sorry, Lady Barmouth," he apologised. "The fact is, Mr.
  Perkins has been called away on important business to our West End branch. He
  cannot possibly get back in less than an hour. Do you want your jewels in
  such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth was fain to confess that she didn't. She would not require
  them till the following evening; only some time must necessarily be spent in
  the cleaning of them.</p>

  <p>"Plenty of time for that," Carrington smiled. "I will send a special
  messenger in a cab to bring the cases to your house by lunch time. I hope
  that will be convenient to you."</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth, innocent of the part which she was playing in the comedy,
  replied that that arrangement would suit her exceedingly well; indeed, she
  was sorry to give so much trouble. She swept out of the bank parlor, followed
  by Jack and Claire. A well-appointed brougham stood outside, and she
  smilingly offered her companions a lift.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take Claire back to lunch with me." she said. "Can I set
  you down anywhere, Mr. Masefield?"</p>

  <p>"You can set me down, if you please, on your own doorstep," Jack smiled.
  "As a matter of fact, I was just going to see Lord Barmouth, and now I have
  something serious to say to you. Were you satisfied just now? About the
  jewels. I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth looked puzzled as Jack followed her into the brougham. She
  saw nothing, so she said, to arouse any suspicions, except that she thought a
  needless fuss had been made over her gems. She was still discussing the
  matter, when the brougham reached Belgrave Square and the three alighted.
  Once they were in the drawing-room, Lady Barmouth turned to Jack and asked
  him what he meant. He shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am going to upset you very much." he said. "But unless I am
  greatly mistaken, you are never likely to see your diamonds again."</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth stared open-mouthed at the speaker. She explained that her
  diamonds were of great value; indeed, some of the stones were historic. Those
  diamonds had often been mentioned in personal paragraphs, which are such a
  feature in the modern newspaper, and Jack recollected a description of them
  perfectly well. He proceeded to explain. at considerable length, the history
  of his last night's adventure. Lady Barmouth's face grew still more grave
  when at length the recital was finished.</p>

  <p>"This is a very serious matter." she said. "Do you know this is likely to
  cost Lord Barmouth something like fifty thousand pounds? The City and
  Provincial Bank does a good deal of business with people well-known in
  society, and I am afraid many of us will be involved. What do you suppose has
  become of those diamonds, Mr. Masefield?"</p>

  <p>"They have been pawned, of course," Jack said. "Carrington has taken that
  dreadful risk in the desperate hope of retrieving his position. But the whole
  scandal is bound to become public property before eight and forty hours have
  passed."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it now but to wait and see what time would bring
  forth. Lord Barmouth was not yet down; indeed, his man said that he would not
  appear till after luncheon. But there was no lack of animated conversation in
  the drawing-room, and the discussion was continued till the gong rang for
  lunch.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what I think the best thing to do," Lady Barmouth said as Jack
  held the drawing-room door open for her. "You are a barrister, and accustomed
  to deal with legal matters. If those stones fail to arrive by half-past two,
  I will give you my written authority, and you shall take it to the bank and
  insist upon something definite; being done."</p>

  <p>Luncheon was a thing of the past, and it was getting on towards 1 o'clock,
  when a cab drove up to the door, and a footman announced the fact that a
  gentleman from the City and Provincial Bank desired to see Lady Barmouth. She
  returned presently, beaming with smiles, and announced that Jack had been
  mistaken; for the gems had not only been delivered, but had also been handed
  over to the speaker's maid.</p>

  <p>Slightly taken aback, Jack expressed a natural curious desire to see the
  stones in question. Lady Barmouth rang the bell, and presently a smart French
  maid appeared, bearing four shabby-looking cases in her hand. They were laid
  on the table, and Jack suggested that Lady Barmouth open one of them.</p>

  <p>"I see you are still suspicious." she smiled. "Evidently things were not
  so desperate with Mr. Carrington as you appear to imagine. What do you think
  of those?"</p>

  <p>With pardonable pride. Lady Barmouth lifted the cover of one of the cases
  and displayed the flashing contents to Claire's admiring eyes. A livid stream
  of name dazzled and blinked in the sunshine. Claire's cry of delight was
  echoed by an exclamation of astonishment from Lady Barmouth.</p>

  <p>"There is some extraordinary mistake here," she said. "I admit that these
  stones are exceedingly beautiful, but, unfortunately, they are not mine at
  all. They look to me much more like the property of the Duchess of
  Birmingham. I have no pearls or emeralds&mdash;my jewels are all diamonds and
  sapphires. The cases must have been changed; a mistake easily accounted for,
  as they are both green wraps."</p>

  <p>But Jack was not in the least convinced. This was some desperate expedient
  to lull Lady Barmouth's suspicions to sleep for the time. And doubtless
  Carrington had gone off hot-foot to Anstruther, and implored him to find some
  way out of the terrible difficulty. Another idea occurred to Jack, but this
  he did not dare to mention for the present&mdash;it was too suggestive of a
  situation from some melodrama.</p>

  <p>"I think I can explain the whole thing," he said. "But, first of all, I
  should like to take Lord Barmouth's opinion on the matter. Probable he has
  finished his own lunch by this time. Will you see if he is ready to receive
  me?"</p>

  <p>Lord Barmouth was glad enough to see Jack, and welcomed him quite
  cordially. Then Jack laid the jewel cases upon the table, and proceeded to
  relate once more the story of last night's happenings. He concluded with a
  description of his visit to Carrington, and epitomised the incident of the
  changed jewels.</p>

  <p>"Certainly a most extraordinary thing," Barmouth said. "I rather gather
  from the expression of your face that you have some solution to offer."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I have," Jack said eagerly. "This is merely a trick to gain time,
  and an exceedingly clever trick, too. Carrington had naturally assumed that
  we know nothing of his desperate position. If we were in the dark on that
  point the mistake would look exceedingly natural. But, knowing what we do,
  the situation is entirely changed. I don't believe those are the Duchess of
  Birmingham's diamonds&mdash;I don't believe they are diamonds at
all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By Jove! You have hit it exactly." Barmouth cried. "What a really
  magnificent idea! Carrington has no diamonds; therefore he lays out, say, a
  couple of hundred pounds of some showy-looking paste, and sends them round
  here as my wife's gems. She, absolutely innocent of any deception, sends them
  back and asks to have the mistake rectified. Back from the bank comes a
  polite note of regret apologising for the mistake, and promising the proper
  stones for to-morrow, the cashier having left for the day."</p>

  <p>"Exactly my idea." Jack cried. "But we can soon settle that, Lord
  Barmouth. You have only to telephone to your family jeweler, and ask him to
  step round here for a moment"</p>

  <p>Barmouth fell in with the suggestion at once, and a telephone message was
  dispatched to the famous firm of Flint &amp; Co., in Bond street. Mr. Flint
  himself arrived a few minutes later, and the dubious gems were laid before
  him. He had not the slightest hesitation in giving his verdict.</p>

  <p>"Paste, my lord." he said briefly, "and pretty poor stuff at that. I can
  see that, even in this dim light. See how dull those stones are: Real gems,
  even in semi-gloom, shimmer and sparkle, but these don't show up at all. The
  whole lot did not cost more than two hundred pounds; in fact, these things
  are little better than stage jewels."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us where they come from?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I can, sir," Mr. Flint replied, promptly. "There are occasions
  when clients of ours are compelled to exchange the real for the false. In
  cases like that we go to Osmond &amp; Co., of Clerkenwell, where these came
  from. I hope there is nothing wrong."</p>

  <p>Barmouth said politely that the matter could be discussed on a future
  occasion. He would not detain Mr. Flint any more for the present, and the
  latter bowed himself out of the room.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do now?" Barmouth asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, with your permission, I propose to strike while the iron is hot,"
  Jack said. "It is quite evident that this rubbish has been purchased very
  recently from Osmond's. If you will allow me to do so, I will go at once with
  the cases to Clerkenwell and ascertain the purchaser. If we can bring
  Carrington to book promptly, we may recover Lady Barmouth's jewels yet."</p>

  <p>Barmouth had nothing to say except in praise of this suggestion.
  Accordingly. Jack set off in a cab for Clerkenwell, where he had no
  difficulty in finding the fine business premises of Osmond &amp; Co. He lost
  no time in diplomacy, but proceeded to lay the whole matter before the head
  of the firm.</p>

  <p>"You will see there is something very wrong here." he said. "This
  manufacture of yours has been deliberately substituted for some valuable gems
  belonging to a lady whose name I am not at liberty to divulge for the
  present. Mr. Flint of Bond street says that the paste has been purchased from
  you. We have absolute proof of the fact that the stuff was bought during the
  past two hours. I shall be glad if you will tell me the name of the
  purchaser. I don't suppose the stuff was booked."</p>

  <p>Mr. Osmond explained that theirs was practically a cash business, A few
  inquiries elicited the fact that the paste had been bought about two hours
  before by a tall, slim gentleman, who had driven up in a hansom cab. There
  was another gentleman in the cab, but he had not entered the shop.</p>

  <p>"Were the jewels paid for in cash?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>They had not been paid for in hard cash, the cashier explained. The bill
  had come to two hundred pounds altogether, and had been made out to a Mr.
  Morrison. He had paid for them with twenty ten-pound notes in a most
  business-like way, and gone away again&mdash;the whole thing not having
taken more
  than five minutes. Jack suggested that be would like to see the notes. They
  were fresh and clean, but across the face of all of them was a circular blue
  mark bearing the words "City and Provincial Bank!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">XXXIV. &mdash; IN THE VAULT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HERE was proof positive enough to convict Carrington of the
  crime which had been alleged against him. Nor did Jack doubt for a moment
  that Anstruther was at the bottom of this daring and original scheme. The
  mere fact that there was another man in the cab with Carrington was
  sufficient to prove this point, for nobody else was likely to accompany the
  bank manager on so delicate and private an errand. Where the fatal mistake
  came in was in Carrington taking the Bank of England notes from his own safe
  and ignoring,the fact that the official blue stamp was upon them.</p>

  <p>As Jack stepped into the street he had pretty well made up his mind what
  to do. Not for a moment did he believe that Carrington had an accomplice
  amongst his own staff. Jack reached the premises of the City and Provincial
  at length and asked to see Mr. Carrington. He was told that that gentleman
  had suddenly been called out on important business, and was not expected back
  to-day. But Masefield was not in the least disappointed to hear his. There
  was nothing for it now but to return to Belgrave Square and tell the
  Barmouths what had happened. He found Lord Barmouth in the drawing-room,
  where the blinds had been pulled down. Lady Barmouth had gone to an important
  function which she could not very well ignore, and had taken Claire along
  with her. Lord Barmouth listened gravely to all that Jack had to say.</p>

  <p>"I am very much afraid that my wife will have to put up with the loss of
  her gems," he said. "No doubt they and many others are pledged with some
  great firm of pawnbrokers. The only consolation one has is the possibility of
  getting the stuff back by paying half its price over again. But matters
  cannot be allowed to rest here. Carrington knows that he is at the end of his
  tether; consequently, that clever bogus burglary you heard discussed last
  night must take place this evening. What do you propose to do? In my present
  unfortunate condition I can't interfere. The only thing I can do is to leave
  it entirely in your hands."</p>

  <p>Jack went off presently to seek Rigby, whom he found at his rooms. The
  latter looked up eagerly, for he could see from his friend's face that Jack
  had a great deal to tell.</p>

  <p>"There is one little thing that seems to stand in the way of our ultimate
  success," Jack said, thoughtfully, "and that is as to Lady Barmouth's
  brother. I am afraid that he is in some way mixed up with this
business&mdash;to
  his detriment, I mean. I should not care to do anything likely to cause
  additional pain to that estimable lady after all her great kindness."</p>

  <p>Rigby looked up in some bewilderment Apparently he did not quite
  understand the drift of Jack's argument.</p>

  <p>"I may be very dense." he said, "but I don't follow you. What can Lady
  Barmouth's brother have to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you must cast your memory back to the night of the great adventure,
  when Lady Barmouth played so courageous a part, and got us out of a serious
  difficulty. Do you follow?"</p>

  <p>"I think I do now," Rigby said slowly. "Oh. yes; it is all coming back to
  me. Lady Barmouth asked Redgrave where her brother was, and Redgrave replied
  that he knew nothing about the individual in question. But, my dear fellow,
  you have not proved to me yet that Lady Barmouth has a brother."</p>

  <p>"Now you are puzzling me," Jack murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. On the night I speak of Lady Barmouth had to act on the spur
  of the moment. It was necessary to gag a bit to play for an opening. You are
  taking too much for granted. If Lady Barmouth has a brother, you will
  probably find that he has nothing to do with this matter. In any case, why
  worry about him to-night? We seem to have a big adventure before us so far as
  I can gather from what you have just told me. And if you are still in doubt,
  it will be quite an easy matter to see Lady Barmouth in the morning, and
  ascertain from her whether or not our proposed line of action is likely to do
  any harm. I don't suppose that Lady Barmouth knows or cares anything for
  Redgrave, who appears to be a kind of sottish tool of Anstruther's."</p>

  <p>"Quite right" Jack agreed. "And now, come along and let us set the ball
  rolling again. I think that I have told you everything. And now we will go
  off without delay, and see Seymour&mdash;the man I told you about who was
with me
  last night."</p>

  <p>Rigby assented to the suggestion eagerly enough, and together they set out
  in the direction of Seymour's rooms. There was not much chance of the latter
  being out, seeing that he had his own cogent reasons for not facing the
  daylight, and surely enough it turned out as Masefield had expected.</p>

  <p>Seymour was dawdling over his tea with a cigarette and a French novel, a
  bored expression on his face. That face, however, became eager and animated
  as Jack came in and introduced Rigby to his host.</p>

  <p>"Things are beginning to move rapidly then," Seymour exclaimed. "Your face
  speaks of action, Mr. Masefield. Is it about Carrington? You have discovered
  something fresh."</p>

  <p>"I think I have discovered pretty well everything," Jack replied. "I have
  managed to force that fellow's hand. Just as Rigby suggested I should. He has
  consulted Anstruther, as we knew he would; and a pretty scheme for gaining
  time they evolved between them. But perhaps I had better tell you
  everything."</p>

  <p>Seymour pitched his French novel aside, and his intelligent face beamed
  with animation. The story was told at length, and Seymour warmly
  congratulated the speaker upon his astuteness and intelligence. "If
  Carrington's good name is to be saved at all, that bogus burglary must take
  place to-night."</p>

  <p>"By the way:" Jack exclaimed. "There is one thing I quite forgot to tell
  you? that is the little adventure I had last night at the Great Metropolitan
  Hotel. I found an invalid gentleman there&mdash;or, at least, he found
  me&mdash;who seems to know all about Anstruther and his movements. He knows
  you, too; indeed, he seemed to be overjoyed that you are in England. He had
  some hesitation in mentioning his own name, but he said that if I gave you a
  certain ring which is now in my possession, you would understand
  everything."</p>

  <p>Jack laid the ring upon the table, and Seymour pounced upon it like a hawk
  would pounce upon a mouse. A grim smile played about the corners of his
  mouth; but, self-controlled as he was, he could not altogether hide his
  feelings.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all that happened with my friend last night," he asked. "It has
  an important bearing on this case."</p>

  <p>Jack proceeded to explain, Seymour listening in an attitude of rigid
  attention.</p>

  <p>"This is the best news I have heard for some time," he said. "You can make
  your mind quite easy on one thing&mdash; Anstruther has nearly shot his bolt.
  After to-morrow I will get you to arrange a meeting between myself and my old
  friend at the Great Metropolitan Hotel. Meanwhile, there is much to be done.
  It is quite certain that great things are going to happen at the City and
  Provincial Bank to-night. I think we shall have a pleasant little surprise
  for Anstruther &amp; Co."</p>

  <p>Seymour rose, and took a roll of tissue paper from a small safe in the
  corner of the room.</p>

  <p>"These are the plans of the City and Provincial Bank." he
  explained&mdash;"the plans that came so luckily into our hands last night. I
  have studied them very carefully. As a matter of fact, I did not come
  straight home last night, but passed the hours till nearly daylight prowling
  about the bank. Without the plans, my scheme would be quite futile; but I
  think now that, I have the whole thing very prettily mapped out. Just come
  and look at them with me. It is really very simple."</p>

  <p>As Seymour had said, the plan was simplicity itself. It not only gave a
  very intelligent idea of the situation of the vaults and strong rooms, but
  also the back premises and the lanes behind were clearly marked.</p>

  <p>"Now I want you to follow this very carefully," Seymour.went on. "We can
  ignore the front of the building altogether, because that faces on Gresham
  Street. Here the police pass the same premises every three minutes, so that
  nobody could force an entrance that way, not even the would-be burglars with
  their keys. But if you look at the rear of the place, you will see that there
  is a small alley leading out of Farringdon Lane, and this alley ends by a
  kind of back entry into the bank which is used by the caretaker. I have
  ascertained that there are two night watchmen, so that there is not much
  danger of trouble. By the side of this door is a small window, the latch of
  which I have ascertained to be defective.</p>

  <p>"I suppose no one has ever troubled to see to this, for the simple reason
  that, admission to the bank premises by no means implies getting to that part
  of the building which is devoted to business purposes. Not that we
  particularly want to penetrate very far, because it is our scheme to watch
  what is going on, so that we may be able to confront the scoundrels when the
  proper time comes. A careful examination of these plans shows me that shall
  be able to get as far as the bank proper, which means the counting house,and
  from thence down the steps to the vaults where the strong rooms are
  situated."</p>

  <p>"Have you got keys of all these?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"There will be no necessity for us to provide keys," Seymour chuckled.
  "You see, Anstruther &amp; Co. will be bound to enter the bank from the back
  premises. By learning this plan off by heart, we come to know exactly which
  way they will get to the vaults. Of course, they will come provided with
  keys&mdash;Carrington will see to that. All we have to do is to hide under a
  counter or something of that sort, and wait till our friends come along.
  Naturally, they will not dream that anyone is on the premises besides
  themselves. As to the rest, you must leave that to me and fortune. You had
  better stay here and dine, and we can set out for the city about eleven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>It seemed to both Rigby and Masefield that it would be impossible to
  improve upon this plan. They dined comfortably and discreetly, and it was
  somewhere about half-past eleven when they turned their faces in the
  direction of the city. No one appeared to notice them, for they walked
  rapidly along, with the air of men who had business before them, and the
  police appeared to be few and far between. They came at length to the little
  alley at the rear of the bank and here it behoved them to be cautious. They
  waited till the beat of the policeman's feet died away down the lane, and
  then they darted down the dark entry. Seymour produced a tiny electric torch
  from his pocket</p>

  <p>"There is the window," he whispered. "I am going to get on your shoulders,
  Mr. Rigby. Once I am through, I can pull you others up. There is no sort of
  danger."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but there is," Jack protested. "You have utterly forgotten one
  thing&mdash;did you not tell me there were two night watchmen on the
  premises?"</p>

  <p>Seymour chuckled, and was understood to say that they would find
  Anstruther had removed that difficulty for them. Seymour seemed so sure of
  his ground that Jack waived his protest. A minute later Seymour was through
  the window, and the others followed swiftly. Rather recklessly, or so it
  seemed to Jack. Seymour waved his electric torch to as to form a line of
  light in front. He smiled grimly as he pointed to two unconscious figures
  reclining back as if hopelessly drunk in a pair of deep armchairs. They came
  so suddenly upon the unfortunate victims that Jack fairly started. But so far
  as Seymour was concerned, he had appeared to have expected something of the
  kind. He again chuckled hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" he asked. "Did I not say that Anstruther and Co.
  would very kindly get the caretakers out of the way for us. You see, the
  caretakers would have been just as much of a nuisance to them as they are to
  us. They have been carefully hocussed, and not until an alarm is given in the
  morning will they be in a position to say anything."</p>

  <p>The last danger being apparently removed, the trio proceeded to make their
  way to the bank premises proper, and there made themselves as comfortable as
  possible under one of the counters in the counting house. It was very quiet
  there, so quiet that they could hear the tramping footsteps of the police
  outside and the singing of some belated reveler. They lay there till they
  heard the great clock of St. Pauls strike the hour of one. There was a sound
  then of heavy footsteps tramping along the corridor, and presently a great
  blaze of light filled the counting house. It was perfectly safe, for the
  heavy iron shutters excluded every ray from the outside. Seymour rose,
  cautiously, then ducked his head again.</p>

  <p>"Just look," he whispered. "Make sure who it is."</p>

  <p>Rigby raised his head cautiously, too. The light fell full upon the face
  of the intruder&mdash;the white, stern face of Anstruther.</p>

  <p>"Now tor it," Seymour whispered. The play is about to begin."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">XXXV. &mdash; THE CELLINI PLATE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SO far as Anstruther was concerned, he might have been going
  about his usual business. He evidently had no fear on the score of
  interruption, and, indeed, there was little cause, seeing that the bank was
  so substantially built, and that from top to bottom the windows were
  protected with iron shatters.</p>

  <p>"There is absolutely nothing to be afraid of," he said. "Good gracious,
  man, have you no pluck at all? I declare, when I look at you that I could
  kick you as one does a cowardly cur."</p>

  <p>But Carrington was impervious to insult. His face was ghastly, and the
  strong glare of the electric lights showed the beads of moisture upon his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you," he growled. "The greater the danger the
  better you seem to like it."</p>

  <p>"There isn't any danger," Anstruther protested. "Didn't you tell me that
  the police had no special orders as far as the bank was concerned? And
  everybody knows you have two night watchmen. Besides&mdash;oh. I have no
patience
  with you!"</p>

  <p>Anstruther turned away from the other, and began to fumble with the lock
  of a small black bag which he carried in his hand. He signified to Carrington
  that the latter should I lead the way to the vaults below. Carrington
  produced a bunch of keys from his pocket. Anstruther sneered, openly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's it," he said. "Going to make it all smooth for us, are you? Of
  all the fools I ever came across. Why not go outside and tell everybody what
  we are going to do? Those are all patent shove locks, which the most expert
  thief could never pick, and you are going to tell the police later on that
  they have been opened with an ordinary key? Don't forget that you have got to
  face the police later on, and endure a cross- examination that will test your
  nerve to the uttermost. We are going to blow those locks up, and these are
  dynamite cartridges to do it."</p>

  <p>Carrington's face was almost comic in its dismay. His ghastly,
  sweat-bedabbled face fairly quivered. But he made no further protest; he bent
  before the sway of Anstruther's master mind.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to interfere with you," he stammered. "But the infernal
  noise which is likely to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anstruther kicked his companion aside.</p>

  <p>"We either do it or we don't do it," he said. "It doesn't matter a rap one
  way or the other to me. Now which is it to be?"</p>

  <p>Carrington hesitated no longer. He simply submitted himself entirely to
  the hands of his companion. In a dazed, fascinated kind of way he watched
  Anstruther insinuate a dynamite cartridge of minute proportions into the lock
  of the door. Then Anstruther drew Carrington back as far as possible, and the
  tiny fuse began to work. There was just a tiny spurt of blue flame, followed
  by a muffled shock, and the door fell slowly back.</p>

  <p>"There!" Anstruther cried triumphantly. "What do you think of that? Do you
  suppose that noise was heard outside? Now come on; let us serve them all
  alike."</p>

  <p>The sound of their footsteps came to the ears of those watching in the
  counting house, and at frequent intervals the sullen explosions could be
  heard. Seymour rose to his feet, and whispered to his companions to follow.
  They crept cautiously along the flagged stairway until they reached the vault
  in which the two strong rooms were situated. A couple of electric lights gave
  sufficient illumination for the purpose of the amateur burglars, who were now
  busily engaged on the locks of the strong room.</p>

  <p>This was altogether a different business to blowing in the lock of an
  ordinary door, for the entrance to the strong room was secured with six
  bolts, all of which would have to be destroyed.</p>

  <p>It was possible to find a secure hiding-place in the thick darkness
  outside the radius of the two electric lights. It was an interesting moment,
  and even Seymour was conscious of a sensation of excitement.</p>

  <p>"Stand back," Anstruther said. "Everything is ready. You had better lie
  down on your face, as I am using six charges now instead of one. If they all
  go off together the thing will be accomplished to our mutual
  satisfaction."</p>

  <p>The hint was not lost upon the listener. There was a moment of intense
  excitement and then came a dull, heavy roar, that seemed to shake the
  building almost to its foundations. Almost before the reverberations had died
  away, the huge door of the room swayed with a zig-zag motion, and came
  smashing on the floor. "There!" Anstruther cried triumphantly. "What do you
  think of that, my friend? I flatter myself that that is a real workmanlike
  job. All you have to do now is to keep a stiff upper lip, and give the police
  all the information they require. Anything of value inside?"</p>

  <p>"Not very much, I am afraid," Carrington responded. "A fair amount of old
  family plate, and perhaps twenty or thirty thousand pounds' worth of
  securities. I suppose we had better leave all that there; look better, don't
  you think?"</p>

  <p>"Leave your head there," Anstruther sneered. "Now I put it to you, as a
  man supposed to be possessed of sense&mdash;would any thief leave a single
item of
  value behind?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther asked the question with a contemptuous curl of his lip. He was
  wiping his hands now on a piece of greasy cotton waste in which the dynamite
  cartridges had been wrapped to prevent contact.</p>

  <p>"This is going to be a unique sort of burglary." he continued. "Trot out
  what you've got in the way of plate, and I'll take my pick of it as a kind of
  fee in reward for my night's service. If there is one soft place in my heart
  it is for antique silver. Take your time&mdash;we are not in the least
likely to be
  interrupted."</p>

  <p>With his coat off and his shirt sleeves turned up. Carrington set to work
  in earnest. Once he had plunged headlong into the business, he seemed to have
  lost all his nervousness and hesitation. One after the other the great wooden
  cases were turned out and examined by Anstruther as eagerly as a schoolboy
  pores over something new in the way of a bird's nest. Presently he held aloft
  a magnificent specimen of a silver dish. It was perfectly plain; fine old
  hammered silver, bearing a quaint design around. the edge.</p>

  <p>"Benvenuto Cellini for a million," he cried. "Dish and ewer, together with
  a set of the finest posset cups I've ever seen. How much over ten thousand
  pounds would this fetch at Christie's? Well, I'm very sorry for the late
  owner, hut exceedingly pleased so far as I am concerned. I'll take this for
  my fee, Carrington."</p>

  <p>The two dived into the strong room again, where they appeared to be
  overhauling other boxes of treasure. The gleams of the electric light fell
  upon the service of plate which Anstruther had so greatly admired. By its
  side, in strange contrast, laid a piece of cotton waste with which Anstruther
  had wiped his hands a minute or two before. Without a word of warning to his
  companions. Seymour darted across the floor of the vault; and, seizing the
  cotton waste, proceeded to rub it vigorously over the surface of the service
  of plate which Anstruther had marked down for his own.</p>

  <p>His conduct was so unexpected and so peculiar, that jack and Rigby could
  only look at one another in astonishment. They did not know in the least what
  to make of this extraordinary maneuver on the part of their colleague. But
  there was evidently method in his madness; he was not in the least likely to
  run the risk of detection to gratify an apparently meaningless whim. He was
  back again an instant later, and Jack could hear him chuckling to himself as
  if he had accomplished something quite out of the common. He seemed to feel
  that some explanation was necessary.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you thought that peculiar," he said; "but you will understand
  all in good time. I didn't go out of my way to spoil everything for the mere
  sake of playing amateur housemaid."</p>

  <p>Apparently the task which Anstruther and Carrington had set themselves was
  finished by this time, for they came out of the strong room empty-handed. All
  the same, their figures appeared to be pretty bulky, and doubtless their
  pockets were well filled with illicit gain.</p>

  <p>"But you don't mean to carry that stuff home," Carrington protested.
  "Well-Known as you are, it would be an act of criminal folly to carry that
  plate through the streets at this time of the morning. As to
  myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But have you no private safe of your own?" Anstruther asked. The same
  remark you made to me just now applies to you. Is there anything more to wait
  for?"</p>

  <p>Carrington disappeared within the strong room again for a last look
  around, followed by Anstruther. They had no sooner disappeared than Seymour
  was on his feet again, making hurriedly for the stairway leading to the
  counting house. He had not been gone many seconds before there came stumbling
  noisily down the stairs the form of one of the night watchmen, rubbing his
  eyes drowsily, and asking what was going on. It was quite evident to Rigby
  and Jack that Seymour had deliberately aroused the sleeping man for some
  subtle purpose of his own. The man cried out again to know what all this
  meant, and Carrington and Anstruther came darting from the strong room.</p>

  <p>"By heaven! He has come to his senses," Anstruther muttered. "I thought
  that dose was quite strong enough. I am very sorry, but seeing that he has
  learned so much?"</p>

  <p>There was murder in Anstruther's eyes, and Carrington saw it. Still dazed
  and stupid from the result of the drug, the watchman was gazing about him
  like a man just emerging from a heavy bout of intoxication. It was evident
  that he did not recognise his employer, though senses and reason were fast
  coming back to him. As he staggered towards the strong room door a murderous
  look crept into Anstruther's eyes again, and something bright gleamed in his
  hand. Carrington hastened forward.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he cried hoarsely. "I will have none of that I have gone too far
  already. I could bear with imprisonment, but the mere thought of a noose
  round my neck&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He almost staggered up to the dazed watchman, and shook, him violently.
  The latter seemed to comprehend at length.</p>

  <p>"Wake up. Gregory," Carrington stammered. "There has been a burglary here.
  I had occasion to come down to the bank for something, and found that the
  premises had been broken into. Go for the police."</p>

  <p>Anstruther studied the watchman's features with broody, malignant eyes.
  His quick brain was working rapidly. It was quite evident that the watchman
  had not yet fully grasped the situation. It would be some time before he
  could find a policeman and give him a fairly coherent account of what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Not a moment to be lost," he cried. "Let us go upstairs at once to your
  room and lock all this stuff up in your private safe. No one will think of
  looking for it there. Now don't say you haven't got the key with you."</p>

  <p>Carrington nodded breathlessly, and immediately Anstruther began to pack
  up the Cellini service of plate which had so greatly fascinated him.</p>

  <p>"Come on at once," he said. "Let us get this stuff in hiding, and then we
  can face the police."</p>

  <p>They had only to don their coats again and make their way as soon as
  possible to Carrington's private room. As they passed up the stairs Seymour
  signed to his companions to follow.</p>

  <p>They were only just in time, for as they emerged into the alley the
  watchman was returning with the constable. They squeezed close against the
  wall, securing the friendly cover of the darkness, and a moment later they
  were in Gresham Street.</p>

  <p>"What is to be done next?" Rigby said.</p>

  <p>"I think that is pretty obvious," Seymour chuckled. "So far as I can see
  this is a nice little job for inspector Bates."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36">XXXVI. &mdash; A STROKE OF POLICY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK nodded significantly to his companion. as much as to
  signify that Seymour must be allowed to have his own way. The latter had
  taken the thing into his own hands from the first. It was quite evident that
  he was working out some deep and subtle scheme, and the others were disposed
  to give him a free hand.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see Bates now?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Most emphatically not," Seymour laughed. "It is no cue of mine to come in
  contact with the police until I have seen my way quite clear. Besides, you
  are by no means certain yet that Bates will be put on to this case, and be
  given the opportunity of investigating the startling burglary at the City and
  Provincial Bank. Again, it may be too much or Bates' nerves if I burst upon
  him suddenly, and he recognizes me as the dead Nostalgo who was so
  mysteriously spirited from Shannon street police station. No; on the whole, I
  should prefer that you should go and see Bates alone. Tell him exactly what
  happened and what you saw to-night, leaving me out of the question. Then come
  and see me some time to-morrow afternoon, and I will tell you what to do
  next."</p>

  <p>"One moment," Rigby exclaimed, as Seymour was turning away. "What was that
  idea of yours about the cotton waste?"</p>

  <p>Seymour winked significantly, and remarked that it was time be was in bed.
  With a cheery nod to his companions, he turned his face in an easterly
  direction and strolled off down the street.</p>

  <p>"Now there's a clever man for you." Rigby cried. "Quite as clever a man as
  Anstruther, and I should say a great deal more subtle. But let us go as far
  as Shannon Street police station, and tell Bates our story."</p>

  <p>Bates had been detained rather late. He had only just come in, and was
  preparing to go home when the two friends entered. He had no need to ask if
  they had anything of importance to communicate to him&mdash;he could glean
that
  from the expression of the friends' faces. He led the way to his private
  room, and passed the cigarettes across the table.</p>

  <p>"It's about Carrington," Rigby explained. "But perhaps I had better go
  back a bit, and tell you one or two little things you don't know."</p>

  <p>It was a fairly long story, and it thoroughly aroused Bates to a sense of
  action. His questions were clear and intelligent: he followed the narrative,
  punctuating it here and there with shrewd suggestions.</p>

  <p>"Mind you," he said. "I have been expecting something like this for a long
  time. All the same, I can see that you gentlemen have only told me half the
  story. 8till, I can't complain, especially as I see my way to make a good
  thing out of this. When I tell the people at Scotland Yard all I know they
  are pretty sure to put me on the case&mdash;indeed, I will make a special
  favor of it. You say you saw Anstruther blowing up all those locks, and you
  are pretty sure that the great bulk of the plunder is in Carrington's private
  safe. You don't suggest that Anstruther carried that service of plate home
  with him?"</p>

  <p>"Anstruther wouldn't be such a fool," Rigby said curtly. "He is much too
  cool a hand for that. He will feel quite sure that the stuff is perfectly
  safe where it is, and fetch it away from the city a bit at a time. Of course,
  he won't do all this till the affair has blown over and he is quite safe in
  so doing."</p>

  <p>Bates was inclined to share the speaker's opinion. There was no more to be
  said for the present, and he intimated his intention to go up to Scotland
  Yard and ask the authorities to put him on the case. Jack and Rigby went
  their respective ways, a clock somewhere striking two when they parted at
  length.</p>

  <p>Precisely as Bates had prophesied, the mysterious burglary at the City and
  Provincial Bank caused the greatest sensation the following morning. The
  later editions of the evening papers were full of it. Carrington had been
  interviewed by more than one bright reporter; indeed, he had been dragged out
  of bed for the purpose, and he had been understood to say that the bank's
  loss could not fall far short of a million dollars unless the thieves could
  be promptly arrested. The story was vividly told, Carrington's distress and
  agitation being expressly accentuated.</p>

  <p>But this was not the worst part of the distracted bank manager's story.
  There had been in the possession of the bank a tremendous lot of valuable
  personal property belonging to various esteemed clients. All this had
  disappeared, and more than one great lady in London was mourning the loss of
  her family jewels. The greatest sympathy was felt with the bank: it was only
  one or two carping critics who were asking questions.</p>

  <p>They were pertinent questions, too; a desire, for instance, to know what
  Carrington could possibly be doing on the bank premises at so late an hour.
  But these were merely pin pricks, and the great bulk of the population felt
  nothing but sympathy for Carrington. The only people who had a fairly good
  grip of the real state of the case besides Rigby and his companions were the
  Barmouths and Claire Helmsley. Jack saw Claire in Lady Barmouth's
  drawing-room late the following morning, and explained to her and Lady
  Barmouth what had happened the night previous.</p>

  <p>"It is most mysterious." Claire said, "and almost impossible to believe
  that my guardian had anything to do with the matter. I dined very quietly at
  home last night, and sat up till long past one finishing a novel in which I
  was deeply interested. I can assure you of this&mdash; that from half-past
nine
  till the time I went to bed Mr. Anstruther's violin practically did not
  cease. If I were brought into the case as a witness, I should be bound to
  swear that my guardian was in his study during the whole time that the
  burglary was taking place."</p>

  <p>"That is another phase of the mystery that we have to solve." Jack said.
  "It is all very clever and very ingenious and very useful, but seeing is
  believing. After all, Anstruther was there last night, as three of us are
  prepared to testify."</p>

  <p>"Then in that case I shall never see my jewels again," Lady Barmouth said.
  "But what are the police going to do about it; Mr. Masefield? The thing
  cannot be possibly allowed to remain here. If they were to arrest Mr.
  Carrington at once and search his safe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But the police don't work quite in that way." Jack interrupted. "Besides,
  Carrington is not the only one. The chief villain in the play is Spencer
  Anstruther; and at the present moment he is in a position to prove a perfect
  alibi. It is not the slightest use laying Carrington by the heels till we are
  in a position to prove Anstruther's alibi to be nothing but an ingenious
  mechanical fraud. Don't you recollect the case of the Phoenix Park murders?
  In that case the police could have laid their hands upon half the culprits
  within a few days. They preferred to wait months, until every one of the gang
  were swept up in the meshes of the law. I will go and see Bates presently,
  and ascertain if he has anything fresh to tell us."</p>

  <p>It was quite late in the afternoon before Jack managed to get a few words
  with the inspector. He seemed to be very cheerful and sanguine, and dropped a
  hint to the effect that this morning had not been altogether wasted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we are going on, right enough," he exclaimed in answer to Jack's
  question. "In the circumstances, they can do nothing else. Most of my morning
  has been spent in calling on the various unfortunate people whose valuables
  were deposited at Carrington's bank, and getting a full description of the
  same. After that I made the rounds of the principal pawnbrokers and such
  people a s advance money on real property."</p>

  <p>"Did you find anything of the missing stuff?" Jack asked eagerly. "I mean,
  did you see any of it?"</p>

  <p>Bates explained that up to now he had been successful in three instances.
  He knew where to lay his hands upon the tiara of diamonds that had only been
  deposited with Carrington four days ago.</p>

  <p>"It belongs to one of our fashionable society leaders," he explained, "and
  really is a most magnificent piece of work. Mind you, Carrington must have
  been a great fool, or he must have been desperately pressed for money, to
  pledge these things in London. He could have sent them to Amsterdam or Paris,
  where they could have been broken up and disposed of in such a manner that it
  would have been impossible to trace them. This might have entailed a
  financial sacrifice, but see how safe it would have been. I feel pretty sure
  that within the next two days I shall trace every atom of the lost
  property."</p>

  <p>"But is it usual to pledge such valuable jewels in this casual way?" Jack
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is. The thing has been done over and over again. In a great
  many instances the lady does not go through the ordeal herself, but sends a
  maid or some confidential servant with a note addressed to the pawnbroker,
  and asks for &pound;10,000, or whatever it may be. That is how this business
  has been worked."</p>

  <p>"But the pawnbrokers?" Jack protested. "When they come to see a list of
  the missing jewels a full story must be told."</p>

  <p>Bates admitted the ingenuity of the suggestion. It was just possible that
  there was danger in that direction. Still, as be pointed out, no one could
  blame the pawnbrokers for not recognizing from a bald printed description
  certain gems pledged at their establishments.</p>

  <p>"But I think you can leave that safely to me," he said. "There is nothing
  to prevent me from applying for a warrant for the arrest of Carrington, and
  producing all that damning evidence from his private safe: but by doing this
  we are practically allowing a greater ruffian to escape."</p>

  <p>Jack cordially agreed with this view of the case. He proceeded to speak at
  some length as to what he had seen and heard the night before last in
  Carrington's smoking room.</p>

  <p>"You must not forget," he said, "that the man who was with me on that
  occasion is in possession of the duplicate plans of the bank cellars."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," Bates cried, "I have not overlooked those plans: in fact, I
  particularly wish to have a glance at them. And, by the way. sir, you appear
  to be very reticent over the name of the companion who was with you on that
  important occasion."</p>

  <p>"We will merely call him Seymour," Jack said, cautiously.</p>

  <p>Bates smiled in a queer, significant kind of way.</p>

  <p>"I will be more candid with you than you are with me," he said, "though
  you have told me more than you intended. Now, tell me if my suspicions are
  correct&mdash;is not this 'Seymour' and our missing Nostalgo one and the same
  person? It is a mere deduction on my part, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I had better admit it at once," Jack said. "Besides, you are
  bound to know sooner or later. Why not come with me and see Mr. Seymour
  now?"</p>

  <p>Bates replied that he would be only too delighted. They set off together
  without delay, and presently found themselves at Seymour's residence. The
  latter was doing something mysterious with a file and pair of handcuffs, both
  of which he threw aside as his visitors entered. He extended his hand
  cordially to Bates.</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least surprised to see you, inspector." he said. "In
  fact. I rather wanted to do so. Now. frankly speaking, are you not a little
  puzzled to know how to lay Anstruther by the heels?"</p>

  <p>"We will come to that presently, sir," Bates said quietly. "I shall be
  glad in the first place to know what hold Anstruther has on you gentlemen who
  have so suffered at his hands. Anstruther is a blackmailer, I know . But you
  are a man of pluck and courage&mdash;why can't you fight him in the open? I
can
  quite understand that there are others broken in health and spirit who dare
  not have their story told and dragged before the diabolical curiosity of the
  cheap press. But in your case, why, it seems, to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes." Seymour interrupted. "But suppose you have a dear friend in
  whom you are interested? And that friend had done somebody a great wrong? And
  supposing that Anstruther knew all this? My friend is poor, but I am not. Let
  us go farther and grant my friend a daughter&mdash; a beautiful girl who is
just
  coming to the front in the world of art. She is passionately attached to her
  father; any disgrace to him would break her heart. And it is in my power to
  save this dear child by letting Anstruther believe that both myself and
  others who have suffered are afraid of him. Surely you have heard of many
  such cases, Mr. Bates?"</p>

  <p>Bates nodded. The field was clearing wonderfully.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon me," he said. "It was stupid of me not to think of that
  before. The blackmailer generally strikes through the innocent. But another
  question. Why did Anstruther publish those Nostalgo posters at all?"</p>

  <p>"There, to a certain extent, you have me," Seymour confessed. "You see, it
  is only recently that we Nostalgos have drifted together in London. We must
  give Anstruther credit for having discovered them. Mind you, there may be
  many others who have,suffered, and are now hiding in silence. They would be
  nerveless wrecks for the most part. Anstruther probably wanted to let them
  know that the terror was not dead. You see, it is like the sign of some
  secret society, reminding members of the long arm. But who can say what was
  uppermost in the mind of Anstruther? Suppose that the whole dramatic thing
  had failed in its purpose? What then? Why, Anstruther would have probably
  turned the posters to some business purpose&mdash;a new soap, a novel kind of
  pill&mdash;why, many business houses would gladly buy the reversion of the
Nostalgo
  posters, and make a good thing out of them. I may be wrong, but that is my
  view. Besides, how are we to know how many other Nostalgos have not dropped
  into Anstruther's net through those diabolical posters?"</p>

  <p>"It is possible you are right," Bates admitted. "Nothing seems to be
  impossible in the way of crime. But as to Anstruther?"</p>

  <p>"I have a heavy debt to pay him," Seymour said, with a ring in his voice.
  "And I am in a position to show you how you can lay him by the heels. I
  presume my friend Masefield has told you everything. That being so, all you
  have to do is to open Carrington's private safe, and carefully remove a
  service of Cellini plate which you will find there. When I say carefully, I
  mean carefully&mdash; the thing is not to be fingered. Take it away to the
police
  station, and place it in your glass case. Then, if you follow my advice,
  within eight and forty hours I pledge you that you shall have evidence
  against Anstruther as clear and convincing as if it had come from Heaven
  itself."</p>

  <p>A silence followed, so impressive was Seymour's speech. Then Bates, who
  appeared to be utterly puzzled, promised that the thing should be done. At
  the same moment there was a sound of an altercation on the outer landing, and
  a hoarse voice was heard asking some imperative question. The voice struck
  familiarly on Jack's ears. He glanced significantly at Bates.</p>

  <p>"The very man himself!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Anstruther," Seymour said, in his deep, ringing voice. "Friend
  Anstruther. Shall we ask him in?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37">XXXVII. &mdash; A PREGNANT MESSAGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no mistaking the fact that it was Anstruther who
  was standing outside and speaking in tones which denoted that he was not
  altogether pleased with himself. It might have been a coincidence, or, at the
  same time, it might have been intentional; though the latter suggestion did
  not appear probable.</p>

  <p>"Surely he can't have found us out yet," Jack cried. "If he had done so it
  would hardly be policy to make so much noise about It. What do you think. Mr.
  Bates?"</p>

  <p>Bates responded cautiously that he did not know what to think. The real
  solution came from Seymour.</p>

  <p>"There is no coincidence about it at all." he said. "We know perfectly
  well that Anstruther is a clever criminal, but even clever criminals cannot
  bring off important campaigns without the aid of subordinates. I have not
  taken up my quarters here entirely by accident, though, of course, it was
  necessary for me to be as far off the beaten track as possible. I have seen
  Anstruther here on more than one occasion, and I think that you will find he
  has come to consult one of his satellites."</p>

  <p>"There must be a good few shady people here." Bates observed, "though I
  don't know much about the locality."</p>

  <p>Seymour explained that there were plenty of doubtful characters living in
  the tenement. He suspected at least three burglars who had rooms on the same
  floor. Probably Anstruther was looking for one of these, and for some reason
  or other the fellow had denied himself. The loud tones had ceased now, and it
  was evident that Anstruther had either left the house or found the man of
  whom he was in search. The discovery, however, was too important to be
  allowed to rest like that, and Bates had a proposition to make. He suggested
  the advisability of putting one of his own spies on to watch Anstruther and
  keep an eye upon him for the rest of the day. There would not be the
  slightest uncertainty about this, seeing that Anstruther was so well known to
  the police generally.</p>

  <p>Bates crept carefully away, and returned presently with the information
  that Anstruther was still on the premises.</p>

  <p>"I met one of my men in the street," he explained. "He was just back from
  a job this way, and spotted Anstruther coming in here. Our friend is not
  likely to shake off the fellow that I have put upon his track. Meanwhile, we
  are wasting time here."</p>

  <p>Seymour was decidedly of the same opinion. A minute or two later the trio
  made their way into the street, leaving Seymour alone. He had been informed
  by Bates that he would be kept posted of Anstruther's movements by means of
  special messenger, and that his services would be called upon if necessary.
  Thus assured, Seymour went back to his mysterious business with the handcuffs
  and file, quite content to wait till his time came.</p>

  <p>It was quite dark before the first message arrived. Anstruther had stayed
  where he was till seven o'clock, after which he had gone out and called at a
  neighboring shop, which was kept by a man engaged in the occupation of making
  brass plates. This, so the message said, was merely a blind for the
  manufacture of the finest specimens of burglars' tools. Anstruther had
  entered the shop with nothing in his hand, but had emerged presently carrying
  a small square parcel which might have been a picture frame. Thus encumbered,
  he had returned to the tenement, and was now closeted in the set of rooms
  below Seymour's with a man called Gillmore, otherwise "Simple Charlie," a
  cracksman who stood quite at the head of his profession.</p>

  <p>Seymour's eyes gleamed as he glanced over the letter. He felt that he must
  be up and doing something. It occurred to him as a good idea to make an
  attempt to be present at the interview between Anstruther and his
  confederate. It was absolutely dark now, so that Seymour had no hesitation in
  raising his sitting-room window, which faced the back of the house, and
  seeking to find some means of entering the set of rooms below. So far as he
  could see at first, the thing appeared to be impossible. His quick eye noted
  the fact that a powerful light burned in the room below, for the shadow cf it
  was thrown strongly upon the blank wall opposite. To the left of Seymour's
  window was a large drain pipe used for conveying the rain water from the roof
  to the sewer below. It was an easy matter for Seymour to lash a rope firmly
  to the floor with the aid of a handspike, and to gently lower himself to the
  floor below by means of the pipe. The business was no easy one when it came
  to like Seymour could have possibly done it. He dangled thus perilously in
  mid-air, working his way down inch by inch, till at length his feet rested on
  the sill of the window below.</p>

  <p>As he had half expected, the window was without a catch, which was quite
  in accordance with most of the fittings in the tenement. Leaving his rope to
  dangle harmlessly within reach until it would be required again, Seymour
  passed coolly into the room. He rubbed a match cautiously, and by the aid of
  it saw that he was in a small bedroom evidently devoted to the uses bachelor,
  for the bed had been made in a most perfunctory way, and the floor was
  liberally strewn with tobacco ash. Lying on the table was a plan of some
  large mansion, with footnotes here and there plainly denoting the fact that
  the house had been marked down for some ingenious burglary. Seymour smiled to
  himself.</p>

  <p>He had evidently found his way into the quarters of which he was in
  search. Listening intently, with his ear closely glued against the wall, he
  could detect the sound of voices on the other side. He was not personally
  acquainted with the voice of "Simple Charlie," but the round, full tones of
  Anstruther were quite familiar to him.</p>

  <p>Seymour was, however, not content merely to listen to what was going on.
  Very softly he made his way from the bedroom into the passage beyond. The
  door of the next room was not closed; Indeed, there was no reason for the
  precaution, seeing that the door at the end of the passage was locked. There
  was a pungent smell of tobacco, mingled with the odor of a good cigar, and
  presently the loud pop of a cork and the fizzing gurgle of what Seymour
  rightly guessed to be champagne. By creeping, close and twisting a little
  sideways, Seymour got a fairly good view of the room.</p>

  <p>He could See Anstruther lounging in a comfortable arm-chair, a cigar in
  his mouth, apparently quite at home in his humble surroundings. The other man
  was sucking moodily at a short pipe, and glanced uneasily at his companion.
  He was not much like the commonly-accepted type of burglar, being slight and
  dark, and somewhat timid-looking in appearance. But every now and again the
  glance he turned upon Anstruther was positively murderous in its hateful
  intensity.</p>

  <p>"Now, what on earth are you driving at, guv'nor?" he growled. "No getting
  at the bottom of you. I never feel like a fool except when I am working for
  you."</p>

  <p>"That, my good Charles," Anstruther said smoothly, "is where education
  comes in. If you had had my advantages you might have stood very high indeed.
  As it is, you are an exceedingly good workman, and I, though I say it that
  should not, am a very good master. I suppose you know perfectly well that I
  am in a position to give you away at any moment. I could hand you over to the
  police, who would take very good care of you for the next fourteen years, and
  you could not give me a simple scratch in return. For instance, we will
  suppose it is my whim to identify you with that bank burglary last night. Of
  course, you were not there, but I could prove that you were, all the same.
  And no cleverness of yours could save you from a conviction."</p>

  <p>Gillmore wriggled uneasily on his chair. His eyes followed Anstruther's
  every movement like those of a dog severely punished; there was a suggestion
  of the hound that would have bitten his master if he dared.</p>

  <p>"I know ail about that," he grunted. "And you know I've got to do
  everything you ask me. It only seems the other day that poor Brown defied you
  to do your worst and lost his life over it. That was a lesson to me. Not but
  what I wouldn't be ready and willing to knife you if I thought it was safe. I
  am pretty bad, and so are some of the others; but outside of hell itself
  there is no black-hearted scoundrel as bad as you."</p>

  <p>The man's voice fairly vibrated with passion; but Anstruther lounged back
  in his chair with the air of a man who has just received a high compliment.
  He was a man who loved power. He liked to feel that he could pull the strings
  and move the actions of other men even when they fought desperately against
  his iron determination.</p>

  <p>"All this is so much waste of time," he said. "I came here to-night to get
  you to do something for me, and you will have to do it, whether you want to
  or not. You know what disobedience means&mdash;three hours' freedom, and
fourteen
  years in jail. No more of your confounded nonsense; listen to what I have to
  say."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll do it right enough." Gillmore growled. "Mind you, it's a pretty
  big risk. The police have got an idea that I was engaged in that Maidenhead
  business. I know they've been watching me so close that I can't get rid of a
  bit of stuff, and I have come down to my last half-sov."</p>

  <p>"I'll see to that," Anstruther replied. "What you have to do now is to
  make your way into the Great Metropolitan Hotel. You shall come with me
  presently, and I will show you the room I want you to enter. To a man of your
  ability the thing is ridiculously simple&mdash;quiet side entrance. Iron
  fire-escape ladder and all the rest of it. All you want is a few tools."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't got any," Gillmore protested. "I was, glad enough to get
  away from that Maidenhead business with a whole skin."</p>

  <p>Anstruther pointed significantly to the flat brown paper parcel which he
  had brought in with him.</p>

  <p>"You will find everything you want there," he said. "All you have to
  remember is this. You are to go up the ladder and make your way to the door
  at the head of the second corridor. A row of bedrooms runs along the
  corridor, and the room you have to enter is No. 16. That is a sitting-room
  attached to one of the bedrooms. I don't want you to do anything neat in the
  way of a burglary; you have simply to take a letter which I will give you and
  leave it on the table in the sitting-room. I want the whole thing to be
  absolutely mysterious, and here is a five-pound note for your trouble. And
  now I am going out. and you are to follow me. I will lead you directly to the
  quiet spot at the rear of the hotel, and the rest you must do for yourself. I
  don't think there is anything more for me to say."</p>

  <p>Gillmore nodded in a surly sort of fashion. He was terribly afraid of
  Anstruther, who used all his creatures like puppets, and never afforded them
  the lightest information. His power was all the greater for this; he knew
  that he was hated as much as he was feared. He put on his hat and coat now,
  and Gillmore rose also. Seymour darted away back through the bedroom and on
  to the window-ledge again. It struck him as just possible that Gillmore might
  want to use his bedroom, in which case his chances of being discovered were
  great. But Seymour made his way back again to his own sitting-room. Once
  there he lighted cigarette and sat down to think over the situation.</p>

  <p>It was not long before he had made up his mind what to do.</p>

  <p>Evidently there was no great hurry over the little scheme which Anstruther
  had planned in connection with the Great Metropolitan Hotel, and doubtless an
  hour or two would elapse before Gillmore found his way into the corridor. It
  would not be prudent to carry out the plan until the hotel was getting fairly
  quiet, so that Seymour had plenty of scope for a counter stroke.</p>

  <p>He spent the next hour or so in his bedroom intent upon some sort of
  disguise. Something in the way of a mask, accompanied with side whiskers and
  a pair of spectacles, changed him beyond recognition. A little while later,
  and he found himself engaging a room at the Great Metropolitan. He appeared
  to be rather particular about his choice, and finally decided that No. 18
  would suit his requirements. As he had expected, No. 18 was exactly opposite
  the room chosen by Anstruther for Gillmore's little plot. Once this was
  settled, it seemed to Seymour that there was no occasion for hurry. It was 11
  o'clock before he made his way up to his bedroom. He did not close the door,
  nor did he turn the light on. He sat down grimly and patiently in the
  darkness to await developments.</p>

  <p>The corridor was perfectly silent now, and either the occupants of the
  hotel had retired to rest, or had not yet returned from the theater. This was
  the time, Seymour felt pretty certain, that Gillmore would set to work. With
  his room door ajar, Seymour had a perfect view of the room on the other side
  of the corridor. It seemed to him that he could hear somebody now coming
  stealthily down the passage. Then another sound grated on his ear&mdash;it
was an
  unmistakable cry of pain and fear from the room opposite.</p>

  <p>Seymour crossed the corridor and coolly entered the room opposite.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38">XXXVIII. &mdash; THE CRY IN THE NIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a man in the room surely enough. He was but half
  dressed; he had fallen forward over a table, apparently in a state of
  collapse. He seemed to be seeking something; and then Seymour saw that he was
  clutching at a bottle of brandy, of which he appeared to be in evident need.
  There was no suggestion of intoxication about him, so that Seymour had no
  hesitation in forcing a few drops of the potent fluid between the man's
  pallid lips.</p>

  <p>Strange as the situation was, Seymour did not fail to notice the
  extraordinary way in which his companion's face was cut and scarred and bound
  with sticking plaster. Then he suddenly realized to whose, assistance he had
  come. This was surely the man Jack Masefield had told him about&mdash;the
man who
  had sent him the ring, and who knew the whole history of the Nostalgo
  business. The invalid opened his eyes presently, and gazed in a dull kind of
  way at Seymour.</p>

  <p>"I have been ill," he said. "Since my operation I have been accustomed to
  these kind of fainting fits. It was very good of you to come to my
  assistance."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Seymour said. "I was in my room on the other side of the
  corridor, and I heard you cry out. Is there anything more I can do for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the stranger said. There was a strange thrill in his voice. "Take
  off that mask of yours, and let me see my old friend Seymour once more. I
  should have recognized your tones anywhere."</p>

  <p>"I am glad that my old chum Ferris should recognize me," Seymour said, in
  a voice that trembled a little. "But I dare say that you will wonder why I am
  here. I can assure you it is no coincidence. But what have you been doing to
  your face? The last time I saw you you were what I am now."</p>

  <p>With a bitter laugh Seymour swept his disguise away, and the hideous
  likeness to Nostalgo stood confessed.</p>

  <p>"There is a picture for you," Seymour laughed; "and upon my word you are
  not much better. Are you attempting to get rid of those damning marks that
  you and I are meant to carry to the grave&mdash;those marks of a scoundrel's
  vengeance?"</p>

  <p>"But I shall not carry them to the grave." Ferris said. "My dear friend,
  if I had the pluck and courage you yourself possess, I should not have cared
  so much. But that scoundrel Anstruther haunts me like my own shadow. I
  managed to elude his search: I hid myself in London. He knew I was here
  somewhere, and he hit upon that devilish scheme for preying on my
  imagination; I am alluding to those Nostalgo posters. Most people regard them
  as no better than an ingenious advertisement but the scalding truth is known
  to me. They meet my eye whenever I take my secret walks abroad; they deface
  the hoardings to remind me that I am still Anstruther's slave."</p>

  <p>The speaker wiped his heated face. He made a more or less successful
  attempt to hide his deep feelings.</p>

  <p>"I had almost lost hope," he continued. "I had made up my mind to be
  blackmailed to my last farthing by Anstruther, when fortune brought me in
  contact with a clever French doctor who had heard something of the vengeance
  of the Nostalgos. He assured me that he had treated one of us with absolute
  success. I found out that my young friend was a brilliantly clever surgeon,
  and after a little natural hesitation I decided to place myself in his hands.
  He operated upon the muscles of my face with a view to removing the hideous
  mask which disfigures what was once a passably good-looking face. The shock
  to my system was great, and I am but slowly recovering. But when I do
  recover, I feel quite certain that I shall be as I was before I fell into the
  hands of Anstruther's creatures in Mexico. I am a pretty sight now, I admit;
  but if you look at me you will see that the repulsive hideousness has
  gone."</p>

  <p>Seymour gazed long and thoughtfully into the white face of his companion.
  There was a sudden uplifting of his heart, and the tears rushed to his eyes.
  It was no ordinary weakness that moved him like this.</p>

  <p>"I see, I see," he murmured. "Once you are yourself again, you can defy
  Anstruther; indeed, he would not know you at all. I have had to fight him at
  a terrible disadvantage. If only I could remove this terrible scourge from my
  face&mdash;then I could stand up to him, and his reign would not be for
long. But
  events are pressing so fast that I could not possibly spare the time at
  present to follow out the treatment to which you have been subjected. But
  afterwards I shall be only too glad to place myself in the same hands that
  you have been through. The mere thought that some day or other I shall be
  able to walk the streets like any other man that God has made fills me with
  such a joy that I could sit down and cry like a child.</p>

  <p>"But why be so fearfully afraid of Anstruther?" Seymour asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I am in his power," Ferris whispered. "I have done a great wrong
  in my time, and Anstruther knows it. That fiend seems to discover everything.
  Fortune has enabled me to redress the wrong, but Anstruther holds the proofs
  of my guilt. I really ought to have gone to my relatives and confessed
  everything, and defied him. But with a face like mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand," Seymour said grimly. "But, unless I am greatly
  mistaken&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Seymour broke off suddenly, and snapped out the electric light. He took
  the astonished Ferris by the arm, and fairly bundled him into his bedroom.
  There was no time to explain. A fresh idea had suddenly come to Seymour, and
  he decided to put it through. His quick ear had told him that somebody was
  fumbling at the door of the sitting-room, and that somebody could be none
  other than Gillmore. The burglar had evidently not yet arrived, or Seymour
  would have beard something of the mysterious note. His idea now was to gain
  possession of the note and Gillmore at the same time.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the matter?" Ferris whispered.</p>

  <p>Seymour clicked his lips for silence. He could hear Gillmore in the
  sitting-room by now. He slipped from the bedroom into the corridor, and
  approached his foe by the other door. But apparently Gillmore's ears were as
  quick as those of his antagonist. He pitched the letter on the table, and,
  seeing that escape by way of the door had been cut off, coolly flung up the
  window and fell headlong out. Seymour repress a shuddering cry. Gillmore
  evidently cruelly miscalculated the distance to the ground, for as Seymour
  looked out of the window, he could hear a series of heavy groans below. It
  was obviously his duty to give the alarm and send for a doctor without delay,
  but this he hesitated to do.</p>

  <p>He called Ferris in, and explained rapidly to him what had happened. The
  distance from the window to the ground was some twenty feet.</p>

  <p>"I am going to fetch him up," Seymour explained. "I suppose you have got
  one of our old lassos amongst your baggage? You have? Good! Let me have it at
  once, and I will drag our friend up in here, and then we can send for that
  doctor of yours. This unfortunate rascal is a mere tool of Anstruther's, and
  I want to make use of him."</p>

  <p>The lasso was procured at length, and one end twisted round the leg of
  Ferris' bed. It was not an easy job that Seymour had set for himself, but he
  managed it at length, and, quite overcome with his exertions, laid the body
  of Gillmore on the couch. The latter was quite conscious, and apparently not
  nearly so much damaged as might have been expected. Seymour went over him
  with the practiced hand of one who has dealt with many accidents by flood and
  field. He smiled more cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as I expected," he said. "A broken collar bone and a
  dislocated ankle. You have had a very narrow escape, Mr. Gillmore. It will be
  just as well, perhaps, if you moisten your lips with a drop of this excellent
  brandy."</p>

  <p>Gillmore started at the mention of his name, but he did not refuse the
  proffered stimulant. He saw that he had been caught like a rat in a trap,
  and, like most of his tribe, was prepared to make the best terms he could for
  himself, regardless of his confederates.</p>

  <p>"You might just a s well make a clean breast of it, Seymour said. "You
  came here at the instigation of Mr. Anstruther. Your task was an easy one for
  a man of your abilities, but you see I happened to know that you were coming,
  and that made all the difference. Is that the letter on the table?"</p>

  <p>Gillmore growled out something to the effect that it was. Ferris took up
  the letter, and read it carefully.</p>

  <p>"Just as I expected," he murmured to Seymour. "A mysterious communication
  from Anstruther, only Anstruther's name does not appear upon it. I am
  threatened with all kinds of pains and penalties if I do not immediately part
  with the sum of five thousand pounds. And you might tell me what you propose
  to do with this man."</p>

  <p>"Leave him here for the present," Seymour explained. "We can take your
  doctor into our confidence, and nobody will be any the wiser. It is a very
  odd thing to me if we don't get some valuable information out of this
  Gillmore. You may he certain of one thing&mdash;he could tell us a great
deal about
  Anstruther if he chose to speak. If you will give the address of your doctor,
  I will go off and fetch him at once. Of course, I shall bring him here as if
  he came to see you. I think you are quite safe with the fellow."</p>

  <p>Seymour went off presently, having donned his disguise again, feeling that
  he had done a good night's work. His first act was to telephone to Bates at
  Shannon Street police station, and ask if the latter was still keeping an eye
  on Anstruther. Bates replied in person to the effect that everything possible
  had been done in that direction. Anstruther returned home about ten o'clock,
  and at present was amusing himself with his violin in his own study. Bates,
  moreover, had ascertained that Anstruther had no intention of leaving the
  house again that night: in fact, he had told one of his servants that he had
  caught a chill, from all of which it might be gathered that Bates' spy had
  been very successful in his shadowing of Anstruther.</p>

  <p>So far, everything was quite satisfactory. It only remained now to call at
  Masefield's rooms, and acquaint him with what had happened. But Jack was not
  in, his landlady informed Seymour; as a matter of fact, she had no idea when
  he was coming back; indeed, he had gone off somewhere to a fancy dress ball.
  It was then that Seymour recollected that this was the night of Lady
  Barmouth's great dance. A little at a loss to know what to do next, Seymour
  went slowly off in the direction of Panton Square. He hung about Anstruther's
  house for some little time, still feeling dubious
  in his mind as to whether the latter was going out or not. He waited long
  enough to see a carriage drive up to the door,
  and in the brilliantly lighted hall be could see a graceful figure in fancy
  dress being carefully wrapped up by Anstruther himself, who came, down the
  steps, and saw Claire into the carriage. He appeared to be carefully muffled,
  and spoke with a strained voice of one who suffers from a bad cold.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will enjoy yourself, my dear," be said. "Pray convey to Lady
  Barmouth my sincere regrets and apologies. In the circumstances I am sure she
  will excuse me."</p>

  <p>The carriage drove off, but still Seymour lingered there, feeling quite
  sure that this was part of some scheme of Anstruther's. He decided to wait,
  at any rate, for the present, and for the best part of an hour be paced up
  and down, till at length his search was rewarded. The light in the study
  suddenly went out, though Seymour could hear the music still going on, and
  then another figure emerged from a porch. It was the figure of a man
  assuredly decked out in some fancy dress; but Seymour was not in the least
  deceived, and knew perfectly well that he was following Anstruther.</p>

  <p>The latter walked right away until he came at length to Belgrave Square,
  where he stood for an instant before a house in front of which a scarlet
  cloth crossed the pavement. Into this hall of dazzling light the form of
  Anstruther vanished. Just as Seymour had expected, his quarry was going to
  the masked dance after all. He made up his mind instantly what to do. He
  accosted one of the footmen standing inside the hall, and pressing a coin in
  his hand, said he must see Mr. Masefield at once. Would the footman go
  up-stairs and announce that Mr. Masefield was wanted, in a loud voice. The
  coin had the desired effect, and a moment later Jack was in the ball. He
  strolled up to Seymour in a casual way, and demanded haughtily the reason for
  this intrusion.</p>

  <p>"You did that very well," Seymour whispered. "I came to tell you that
  Anstruther is here after all: in fact, he has just come in. Now I have a
  little scheme of my own. Go and tell Lord Barmouth that I am here, but that I
  should like to appear as a guest. I don't think that he would mind at any
  rate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not he," Jack whispered, excitedly. "Really, there is no reason for me to
  do anything of the sort, I can easily tell Barmouth afterwards, and if you
  have any scheme of getting the best of Anstruther, you will be a welcome
  guest in this house."</p>

  <p>"Good," Seymour replied. "I will go off to a costumer's at once, get
  fitted with a dress and be back here in half an hour. Then I shall pretend
  that I have my card behind, and ask for Mr. Rigby. just as well not to ask
  for you again."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded his emphatic approval. Seymour moved towards the door with a
  deferential air of one who apologises for an unwarrantable intrusion. Once in
  the road he hailed a passing cab, and gave him the costumer's address.</p>

  <p>"Wellington Street." he said curtly; "and drive as quick as you can."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39">XXXIX. &mdash; PREPARING THE WAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SEYMOUR was not away longer than he anticipated. Only
  thirty-five minutes had elapsed before a cab drove up to the house in
  Belgrave Square, from which descended a tall man disguised as a magician. It
  was not a particularly original dress, but it thoroughly served the purpose
  which Seymour had in hand. He wore a long red cloak, coming down to his
  heels, the hem of which was embroidered with queer signs and symbols. On his
  head was a black velvet skull cap, and a long white beard and moustache
  completed the illusion.</p>

  <p>Seymour stood still for a moment, and fumbled about as if to find his
  card. Then Rigby, effectively disguised as an executioner, came forward and
  proffered his services.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he whispered. "I have been talking it over with
  Masefield, and he did not think it would be prudent to meet you here a second
  time. Besides, we have to be very careful: we are not aware how much
  Anstruther knows. He might have got to the back of our plot for all we know
  to the contrary."</p>

  <p>"I did not quite catch how he was dressed." Seymour said. "Would you mind
  telling me what he is wearing?"</p>

  <p>Rigby proceeded to explain that Anstruther was rigged out in a costume of
  some Indian tribe. He could be especially noticed by the exceedingly high
  plume of eagle's feathers which he was wearing in his headdress. Seymour
  chuckled aloud.</p>

  <p>"I thought it all out as I came along," he said. "When I saw Masefield a
  little time ago I only wanted to come here more or less out of idle
  curiosity; but a little idea occurred to me as I called my cab. I am going to
  thoroughly enjoy myself this evening; in fact, this is the first time I have
  had an opportunity of mingling with my fellow creatures for three years. But
  that is not the point if you keep fairly close to me you will have the chance
  of seeing how I shall get on Anstruther's nerves presently."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you are going to begin at once?" Rigby asked, "or
  would you not like to see Barmouth first?"</p>

  <p>Seymour intimated that there was no hurry, and that the little drama he
  had in his mind would be best played out at supper time. That meal was
  intended to be a rather fast and furious affair, where all the guests were
  supposed to always act up to the characters which they personified.</p>

  <p>"Therefore I should very much like to see Barmouth," Seymour said. "If you
  can arrange a meeting for us in some quiet spot I shall be exceedingly
  obliged to you."</p>

  <p>Rigby went off with an intimation that he would not be long. He came back
  presently, and signified that Seymour should follow him. The two proceeded as
  far as the head of the staircase, and there, in a small room at the end of
  the corridor, Barmouth stood awaiting Seymour's entrance. No sooner was the
  latter inside, than his host closed end locked the door. He turned upon the
  light and snatched his mask from his face. On the impulse of the moment
  Seymour did the same.</p>

  <p>Save for the difference of their coloring, the two men were almost
  identically alike. Perhaps in the whole world it would have been impossible
  to find two refined and educated men so hideously and atrociously ugly. One
  man's eyes were blue, the other one's dark brown; but this made no
  difference. All amiability of expression, all frankness and sincerity, seemed
  to have been literally cut out of their features. Most men would have turned
  from them with loathing and disgust. They stood there looking at one another,
  the very image of the Nostalgo posters that London was still discussing so
  eagerly. As Seymour dropped Barmouth's proffered hand, the later burst into a
  bitter laugh.</p>

  <p>"No reason to try and flatter ourselves," he said. "When I look at you or
  you look at me, we both know that we are forever outside the pale of
  civilized society. We can make the most of an occasion like this, but these
  happy hours are few and far between."</p>

  <p>"Well, do you know, I am not so sure of that," Seymour said. "Let me have
  a cigarette, and we will discuss the matter together. Do you happen to
  remember Ferris?"</p>

  <p>Barmouth indicated that he remembered Ferris perfectly well.</p>

  <p>"In fact, we were all victims of the same ceremony," he said. "What a
  ghastly business it was! And that fiend of an Anstruther looking on without a
  drop of pity in his heart for his fellow countrymen, whose sole crime was
  that they were in the hunt for gold like himself. But I want to try and
  forget all that. Do you mean to say you have met Ferris?"</p>

  <p>"Ferris is at the Great Metropolitan Hotel at the present moment," Seymour
  explained. "More or less accidentally he ran against Masefield. Jack
  Masefield happened to mention that he knew me, and there you are. However, I
  dare say you can get Masefield to tell you the story another time. The point
  is, that Ferris has discovered a brilliant French surgeon who has operated
  upon him&mdash;he says, quite successfully. He is a mass of plaster and
knife marks
  now, but he says that in the course of a few weeks he will have resumed his
  normal expression."</p>

  <p>A great cry broke from Barmouth. His agitation was something dreadful to
  witness.</p>

  <p>"Cured," he whispered. "Absolute cured and like other men again. Oh, it
  seems like a dream; like something too good to be true. To think that you and
  I, old friend, are going to stand out once more in the broad light of day
  with no mask needed to conceal our hideousness! You will undergo the
  operation?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, as soon as ever I have done with the Anstruther business," Seymour
  said in his deep voice. "Once let me see that rascal beyond the power of
  further mischief, and I place myself in that man's hands at once, if it cost
  me half my fortune. There is a girl waiting for me, Barmouth&mdash;a girl who
  mourns me as dead. You can see how impossible it was for me to let her know
  the truth."</p>

  <p>"And yet my wife knows the truth," Barmouth said thoughtfully. "Hideous as
  I am he refused to give me back my freedom."</p>

  <p>"She is a woman of a million," Seymour said, not without emotion; "but
  then Lady Barmouth discovered the truth. I don't think you ever would have
  told her on your own initiative.</p>

  <p>This was so true that Barmouth had nothing to say in reply. He appeared to
  be deeply immersed in thought. The settled melancholy of his face had given
  way to an eager, restless expression. He was like a man in the desert who,
  past all hope, had found aid at the last moment. He paused la his stride and
  sat down. "I dare not dwell upon the possibilities that you have opened up
  before me," he said, "I had long abandoned all kinds of hope. Still, there
  are plenty of useful years before me. This is the first moment that I have
  felt what happiness means since we fell into the hands of that gang of
  Anstruther's. You will recollect, of course, the wild stories that our
  tribesmen used to bring in to us about what happened to anybody who dared to
  cross the gold belt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The legend was very common out there," Seymour said. "If you will
  recollect, it was popularly supposed that some heathen god presided over the
  gold mines, and that it was a sacrilege for any stranger to make an attempt
  on the treasure. The natives there firmly believed that the outraged god
  imposed upon the adventurers a disease that rendered them so hideous that no
  man could bear to look upon their faces again."</p>

  <p>"They were not far wrong there," Barmouth said grimly, "Or where did those
  medicine men derive their knowledge of surgery? I recollect very little of
  what happened after I found myself gagged and bound in that wonderful old
  temple, but I do know that one of those priests operated upon me with a
  lancet. When I came to myself, I was as you see me now. But you, too, went
  through it in your turn."</p>

  <p>Seymour shuddered with the horror of the recollection of it.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need to go into that," he said. "The extreme punishment
  would never have been inflicted upon us had it not been for Anstruther. With
  his wonderful ascendancy over the tribe&mdash; and goodness know how he got
  it&mdash;he seemed to be able to persuade them to do anything. The terror of
  it all, the hideous mystery, only served to keep others away."</p>

  <p>"And yet Anstruther most have lost his ascendancy," Barmouth said, "or he
  would never have returned home without bringing a huge fortune with him. We
  have absolute proof of the fact that he is a poor man. But the truth of that
  will ever be known."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure about that," Seymour said. "I hope before long to be
  able to hold the whip over his shoulder and force him to speak. I have my
  little scheme arranged, and I fancy you will derive some little amusement if
  you will watch the working of it. Of course, you know how Anstruther is
  dressed?"</p>

  <p>Barmouth was perfectly cognizant of Anstruther's disguise.</p>

  <p>"The dress of the old tribe," he said; "with the painted feathers, and all
  the rest of it. When he was pointed out to me just now by Masefield I could
  hardly restrain my feelings. Mind you, he is not here with a mere view to
  social enjoyment. He declined my wife's invitation. He told Miss Helmsley
  that he did not feel well enough to turn up, and yet he is here like any
  other invited guest. Now, what is he up to?"</p>

  <p>"It would be hard to say what Anstruther is up to," Seymour replied.
  "Doubtless he has some deep scheme afoot; but he is not the only one, and we
  shall see who gets the best of it in the long run."</p>

  <p>Barmouth was quite content to await developments. Knowing Seymour so well,
  be felt quite sure that the latter was not without a scheme likely to defeat
  Anstruther's intentions. He did not care to come out as yet and mingle with
  the other guests, he said; at the same time he had no desire to stand in the
  way of Seymour's amusement.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am going to amuse myself all right," Seymour said. "Don't forget
  that it is nearly three years since I last sat by the side of a woman, and
  listened to the sound of her voice. For three years I have lacked the
  refining influence of woman's society, and I always preferred the other
  sex to my own. I can move about here and pick my partner as I choose. I care
  nothing for the face for the simple reason that I cannot see it; which is
  very fortunate for me indeed. I am going to pick out all those with lovely
  voices. I dare say you laugh at me."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," Barmouth exclaimed, "My dear fellow, I know the feeling
  exactly. But when is this little comedy of yours coming off&mdash; I must be
  present at that."</p>

  <p>"Just after supper," Seymour explained. "When your excellent champagne
  will set all the tongues wagging. And now, if you don't mind, I'll just have
  a walk round and see that my confederates are carrying out their
  instructions."</p>

  <p>It was a brilliant scene indeed that Seymour viewed through his mask on
  reaching the great ballroom. A dance was in progress. There were very few
  people sitting out, and the dazzling waves of color waved in and out like the
  spray of the sea against a huge rock in the sunshine. A limelight had been
  arranged high up in the gallery, and from time to time threw quick flashes of
  different colored views upon the dancers. The effect was most brilliant, just
  a little dazzling to the eyes. But it was full of a sheer delight for
  8eymour, who had so long been denied the pleasures of life.</p>

  <p>"Very effective, is it not?" said Jack. as be came up. "Quite a novel idea
  in a private ballroom. Come and have a glass of champagne with Rigby and
  myself. He is waiting for us in the buffet. I hope you had an enjoyable chat
  with Barmouth."</p>

  <p>"I was exceedingly glad to see him again," Seymour said. "All the same, I
  am glad that there was no one else present. An Englishman does not care to
  display his feelings to an outsider."</p>

  <p>Rigby was waiting as Jack had explained, and for some little time the
  three sipped their champagne whilst they talked over the situation.</p>

  <p>"I want you two to be as near as possible to me at supper time," Seymour
  went on to explain. "And I want you to take your cue from me when I give it
  you. Mind, you must not look for any sensational developments&mdash;this is
merely
  a comedy for our private amusement I am going to give Anstruther a bit of a
  fright, and at the same time force his hand, so that when he is prepared to
  move; he will play right up to us. As to he rest, keep your eye on the
  magician!"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would be a little more explicit," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, there is nothing to be explicit about. Perhaps Anstruther
  will smell a rat and decline to be drawn into the thing at all. Still, I'm
  not much afraid of that."</p>

  <p>A clock somewhere struck the hour of midnight and a moment later the
  strains of the band died away. The old family butler threw open the double
  doors leading to the dining hall, and announced supper in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>"Come along." Seymour said. "The play has commenced."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40">XL. &mdash; THE MAGICIAN SPEAKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE dining-room presented an appearance quite as striking
  and imposing as the ballroom. It was magnificently paneled with Elizabethan
  oak; the grand old buffets and furniture dated from the same period, The
  supper was laid out on a series of small tables forming a horseshoe, so that
  it was possible to move from one to the other without interruption. Each
  table had its separate electric light stand, round which were trailed sprays
  of red roses. With its shaded lights, its dim, carved walls, with its glitter
  of crystal and glass, the room presented a picture that was not easily
  forgotten. But there were other things quite as important to think of as the
  artistic side of the scene. A few moments later, and Anstruther came in with
  a tall woman, whom Rigby instantly recognized as a great society leader, on
  his arm. It was evident enough that, while Anstruther knew his partner
  perfectly well, she was utterly puzzled as to his identity.</p>

  <p>"So much the better for us," Seymour said, as Jack pointed this out to
  him. "But I must get back to my partner. I want you to try and keep me a
  place at the same table that Anstruther sits at. I hope that you will manage
  to secure Lady Barmouth for me. You will recollect that was to have been part
  of the programme."</p>

  <p>The matter was arranged easily enough, and presently Seymour and Lady
  Barmouth were seated opposite Anstruther and his companion. They had all at
  once plunged gaily into an animated conversation. By this time the guests had
  found their level, and had thoroughly settled themselves down to enjoyment.
  It was just possible that a great many people recognized numbers of their
  friends there, but for the most part the recognition was ignored and the
  illusion maintained.</p>

  <p>"Really, this is a most charming picture," Seymour said, addressing
  Anstruther in the friendliest fashion, although he had taken great care to
  modulate his voice. "With all my skill in the art of magic I could not have
  evolved a fairer scene than this. And my experience goes back a thousand
  years."</p>

  <p>"Quite the most respectable type of family magician," Anstruther laughed,
  as he helped himself liberally to champagne. "We are all so dreadfully modern
  nowadays. I suppose you have nothing to do with up-to-date methods. No
  palmistry, I presume?"</p>

  <p>Seymour was delighted to find Anstruther ready to take up the spirit of
  the game."Nothing comes amiss to me," he said. "To conjure up a scene like
  this would perhaps tax my efforts pretty severely, but I should get there all
  the same.""Delightful!" Anstruther's partner cried.</p>

  <p>"I was just wondering how I was going to settle my racing debts, and now
  you come forward in the kindest way, and relieve me of all further anxiety.
  It is really more than kind of you."</p>

  <p>"As for me," Anstruther said, "I am concerned more with the future than
  the past. I have a little scheme on hand that is troubling me a good deal.
  Without going into details, shall I be successful? Now, can you tell me
  that?"</p>

  <p>Seymour gravely consulted a crystal ball, which he had taken from the
  pocket of his flowing robe. Others were listening by this time, for the
  conversation at Seymour's table was both amazing and interesting. He looked
  up from the ball in the same grave fashion.</p>

  <p>"You are giving me a hard task," he said. "I do not know you, I have not
  seen your face. And yet your soul is reflected in my faithful crystal, and
  your heart's desire lays bare before me."</p>

  <p>"But you have not told me if I shall be successful," Anstruther said.
  "That is the point, after all."</p>

  <p>"You will not be successful," Seymour said in a loud voice, which had the
  desired effect of drawing much attention to the speaker. There is something
  dark that stands between you and the thing  you so much desire. The crystal is
  not as clear as usual, but I can see in it a face. It is a strange face
  &mdash; dark and repulsive, and yet absolutely familiar. Yes, it is the face
  of the poster, the features of which have puzzled London for the last three
  months. It is this face which comes between you and your heart's desire. Do I
  interest you?"</p>

  <p>Quite a score of guests were listening by now. They were thrilled and
  puzzled, and not a little interested. Seymour was playing his part
  splendidly: even Jack and Rigby, who were in the plot, had to admit that.
  Nothing could be seen as to the way in which Anstruther took this shot, for
  his features were hidden behind his mask; but Rigby noticed that his hands
  were clutched upon the edge of the table-cloth, as if they were about the
  throat of some hateful foe, Anstruther sat quite quietly, almost rigidly, for
  a few moments, then burst into a hoarse, strident laugh.</p>

  <p>"This is ridiculous." he said. "Surely you must be aware of the fact that
  those Nostalgo posters are nothing more or less than a clever
  advertisement."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, they have more to do with you than you imagine." Seymour
  went on in the same grave way. "They stand between you like a sheet and the
  execution of your plans. Let me look into my crystal again. Ah, the scene
  grows clearer. I see a ruined temple; I see some weird religious ceremony,
  and the unconscious form of a man laid out for a sacrifice. He rises at
  length; he is no longer good to look upon, his face has become the face of
  Nostalgo. Call it foolish if you like&mdash;" With a cry of something like
  anger. Anstruther rose to his feet. He seemed to suppress himself almost
  immediately, then sat down again.</p>

  <p>"Capital!" he exclaimed. "I dare say it is exceedingly clever, but, at the
  same time, so much Greek to me. What I want is information about the future."
  "I should say you are a traveled man," Seymour said calmly. "You have spent a
  great deal of your time in adventure abroad. Now, let me hazard a guess. You
  have been in Mexico?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther curtly admitted that such was the fact. In spite of the gravity
  of the whole thing, and Seymour's admirable acting, he was getting nervous
  and excited. He would have given much to have removed the mask of his
  tormentor and studied the face behind.</p>

  <p>"It is the little trifles of life that interest you, then." Seymour said.
  "I am afraid you are very material, sir. Well, we will be prosaic if you
  like. For instance, my crystal tells me that you are fond of works of art; in
  fact, you are a collector of such things. What would you say if I were to
  prophesy that you are going to add largely to your treasures in the course of
  the next few days? To be precise, one of your hobbles is old sliver. Like
  most collectors, you will do pretty well everything to gain your end."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is about true." Anstruther admitted.</p>

  <p>"8poken like a man of the world," Seymour went on. "For a long time you
  have coveted a fine specimen of Cellini silver work. A whole set of it will
  pass into your possession, if it has not already done so, and the unique
  service will not cost you a farthing."</p>

  <p>Seymour delivered this shot calmly enough, pretending to be gazing at the
  crystal all the time. But the way in which Anstruther writhed about in his
  chair was not lost upon Jack and Rigby, who were watching the drama with
  breathless interest. Anstruther had half risen from his seat again, and then
  had forced himself down once more, as if struggling with his hidden
  emotions.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see that precious crystal of yours," he sneered. "It
  seems nothing but a piece of glass to me."</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Seymour gravely polished the crystal on his serviette,
  and passed it across to Anstruther with instructions to hold it firmly in his
  palms long enough for the imprint of his fingers to fix themselves.
  Anstruther laughed as he complied with these instructions. Then the crystal
  was laid upon the table very carefully, and was rolled into a small cardboard
  box, and there swathed in cotton wool. With the same grave demeanor, Seymour
  called for wax and something unique in the way of a seal. A servant came
  presently with a piece of violet sealing wax and one of the guests proffered
  his intaglio ring as a seal.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask a favor," Seymour said. "I should like the gentleman to
  seal the box. and hand it over to another guest, who will take care of the
  whole thing for the next three days. You will see what I mean&mdash;I want to
  prevent the possibility of the box being tampered with. Will the gentleman
  kindly seal the packet, and will another gentleman kindly offer to take care
  of the box?"</p>

  <p>The box was scaled at length with the intaglio ring, then another guest
  came forward and volunteered to keep it in his charge.</p>

  <p>"This is exceedingly good of you," Seymour went on; "only you will quite
  see that we cannot carry this through properly unless the gentleman who has
  taken charge of the box volunteers his name."</p>

  <p>"No trouble about that," the second guest cried. I am Sir Frederick
  Ormond, Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs. I hope that my name will be
  sufficient guarantee."</p>

  <p>Seymour nodded, and the statesman dropped the packet into the pocket of
  his cloak. Anstruther laughed unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"And what is the upshot of all this to be?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is on the knees of the Gods," Seymour said gravely. "Your
  individuality will become impressed upon the crystal through the grips of
  your hands, and at the end of the period suggested you will be able to see
  your whole future there. I dare say Sir Frederick will produce the crystal
  when the proper time comes."</p>

  <p>Anstruther turned away with a little laugh of contempt, and, as if nothing
  of the common had happened, Seymour turned and began to discuss ordinary
  topics with his hostess. Supper was practically over by this time, and most
  of the guests were streaming back once more in the (direction of the
  ballroom. Amongst the few who still remained were Jack and Claire, the later,
  of course, being Jack's supper partner.</p>

  <p>"That was very cleverly done," Claire said. "I suppose there is some
  hidden meaning behind it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Jack said. "Only I have not the remotest idea what it was.
  Don't let us go back to the ballroom yet. I have discovered one of the
  jolliest little places leading off the hall, where we can sit and have a cozy
  chat without the least fear of interruption."</p>

  <p>It was precisely as Jack had said&mdash;a little alcove, dimly lighted and
  filled with ferns, from which they could see much that was going on without
  being seen in their turn. It was very quiet down there, and Jack made the
  most of his opportunities. A silence fell upon the pair presently, one of
  those long, delicious silences, only possibly where there is a perfect
  understanding. Jack came out of his reverie presently, conscious that Claire
  was gripping him tightly by the arm. With the point of her fan she indicated
  the figure of Anstruther, who had come down evidently in search of the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>The instrument was almost immediately opposite the alcove, and Anstruther,
  little dreaming that he was being watched, plied the handle vigorously. He
  gave a number presently which was his own in Panton Square.</p>

  <p>"Are you there?" he whispered; "are you there? Confound the girl! Why
  doesn't she speak? Oh, so you are there at last. What? Oh, yes, yes. I am
  speaking to you. You know who I am. Yes, there is danger&mdash;danger that is
  urgent and immediate. I have no time to explain now; you are to come here
  masked at once. Do not come to the front door, but to the lane behind. You
  will find a small green gate there, with Number Five upon it in white
  letters. I will see that the gate is unlocked. Then make your way straight up
  the garden, and into the summer-house which is at the top of the marble steps
  by the fountain. You are not to be more than half an hour."</p>

  <p>Anstruther rang off, and replaced the receiver on the hook. He strolled
  away without the slightest idea that every word he said was audible to the
  pair of lovers in the alcove. Jack turned to Claire with eager eyes.</p>

  <p>"This must be seen to immediately." he said. "Go back to the ballroom as
  if nothing had happened and wait for me there. As for myself, I am going to
  smoke a cigar in the garden, and wait to see who the mysterious individual is
  who has been so peremptorily summoned here. You see how important it is."</p>

  <p>Claire saw that there was much in what Jack said. Obediently enough she
  went off to the ballroom, and waited eagerly for the return of her lover. He
  seemed a long time coming, and nearly an hour had passed before he came back
  and strolled up to Claire in as casual a way as possible. But she could see
  that his eyes were gleaming behind his mask. He was breathing fast, too.</p>

  <p>"Have you discovered who it was?" Claire asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Jack replied. "They are both together. As I more than half
  expected, the fresh arrival is Serena."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41">XLI &mdash; THE WORM TURNS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEANWHILE, it is necessary to go back for a few moments to
  the garden and summer-house where Jack had been waiting to see who was going
  to keep the assignation with Anstruther. On the whole, it was not unpleasant
  work, seeing that the night was very fine and warm, and at the same time dark
  and velvety. There were not many gardens in London as finely proportioned as
  those behind Barmouth's residence. It was wonderful in the midst of that
  atmosphere, that flowers and shrubs could flourish so kindly. There were
  not many paths, most of the ground being given over to turf, so that Jack's
  feet made no noise as he strolled along in the direction of the green gate
  which gave upon the lane beyond.</p>

  <p>The gate turned out to be a door in the
  wall hidden from view inside by a deep belt of shrubs. It was here that
  Jack hid himself and stood smoking his cigar with a determination to stay
  there all night if necessary. The best part of an hour had elapsed before
  there was a noise outside, and a hand turned the latch. Jack dropped his
  cigar and ground it into the soft earth with the heel of his slipper. By this
  time his eyes had got accustomed to the darkness, so that it not a difficult
  matter to make out the outlines of the approaching figure. The figure was
  that of a woman, evidently dressed for the evening, and wearing a mask.</p>

  <p>Jack was not to be deceived; he knew the form perfectly well, even if he
  had not recognised the dress, which the wearer had used the night of his
  visit to Carrington's.</p>

  <p>"Serena," he whispered to himself. "Well, I might have expected that. Now
  to see what will happen next."</p>

  <p>Jack made his way hurriedly across the lawn, and took up a position behind
  a belt of pampas grass, where he could not only see into the summer
  house, but hear what was going on there. He was only just in time, for almost
  immediately the towering headdress of Anstruther appeared, and its owner made
  his way directly to the summer house. Jack could see Serena as she hurried
  along. On the still night air every word could be distinctly heard. There
  came to Jack's ears a whispered apology from Serena that she was sorry for
  the delay.</p>

  <p>"You might have ruined everything." Anstruther said savagely. "I told you
  to be here within half an hour at the most."</p>

  <p>Serena replied humbly that she could not get there before. She had to
  dress and she had to get the other servants out of the way. Anstruther
  muttered impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is impossible for a woman to keep to time," he said. "And
  now listen to me. There is something going on here which even I cannot
  fathom. I feel as if I were being laughed at, as if an unseen net was about
  my shoulders, and that a hidden hand was ready to close it at any time." Jack
  listened eagerly to what followed. It was quite evident from what Anstruther
  said that Seymour's performance had made a deep impression upon him. For once
  in a way Anstruther was puzzled and frightened. He told Serena at
  considerable length all that had taken place during supper.</p>

  <p>"There is more than meets the eye here," he said, "and that fellow said
  either too little or too much. One thing is quite certain&mdash;he is pretty
  intimately acquainted with my inner life in Mexico. Now who is he, and how
  does he know all this?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't know, I can't tell you." Serena replied.</p>

  <p>"No; but you are going to find out," Anstruther responded. "You are going
  to mingle with the other guests as if you were a friend of Lady Barmouth's,
  and I will sign to you presently what I want you to do. You have plenty of
  nerve and resource, and you must find some way of removing the mask from the
  face of my friend the magician. But that is not all. I have a very shrewd
  suspicion that this mysterious Lord Barmouth is no other than the man James
  Smith, who has been so useful to me from a pecuniary point of view."</p>

  <p>"You think Lord Barmouth and James Smith are the same person?" Serena
  cried. "Oh, that is quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen," said Anstruther. "You know all about Lord
  Barmouth's reputation as a recluse as well as I do. Therefore, it will be
  part of your duty to get a sight of Lord Barmouth also. Mind you, I may be
  mistaken, but I have a strong Impression that when you come to look at
  Barmouth you will see the features of James Smith. What the certainty of this
  means to me you can pretty well guess. Hitherto I have treated Smith as a
  comparatively poor man, never guessing for a moment that he was the
  enormously wealthy Barmouth, but in future&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anstruther paused significantly. The listener thrilled as he realized the
  danger in which Barmouth stood. But his whole attention now was concentrated
  upon Serena. He could see that she had drawn herself up to her full height;
  from the motion of her hands, she was evidently moved by some strong feeling.
  It flashed upon Jack all at once that Anstruther was asking Serena to plot
  against the happiness of her own sister&mdash;Lady Barmouth. That that was
  the chord that Anstruther had touched, Serena's first words proved.</p>

  <p>"You are asking too much." she said. "I will not do it. There are times
  when I feel that this life of mine can endure no longer. I have worked hard
  for you: I have been the slave of all your schemes; I have forgotten that I
  possess a conscience,"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you forget what you owe to me," Anstruther responded. "But for
  me you would long since have stood in a felon's dock. If you will think of
  the time when you and your boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Serena cried. "I will not have it. What do I care if I alarm the
  people inside. For the sake of that black past I have consented to be your
  tool and slave. And yet I feel sometimes that you are playing with me: that
  the whole thing is nothing more or less than a cruel and deliberate lie on
  your part, and that my boy still lives. If I thought so; if I only thought
  so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Serena plunged forward, and Jack could see that something glittered in her
  hand. There was the confused suggestion of a struggle, the sound of an oath
  from Anstruther's lips, and the tinkle of metal upon the floor of the
  summer-house.</p>

  <p>"So you have got one of your mad moods on to-night." Anstruther panted.
  "Do not push me to extremes, because you know what that means. Will you obey
  me or not?"</p>

  <p>Jack could see Serena pass her hands across her eyes; he could hear the
  quick sobbing of her breath.</p>

  <p>"I was wrong." she said presently. It was marvelous how quickly she had
  recovered herself. "I will do your bidding. Let us go inside, and you can
  show me the man whose face you desire to see."</p>

  <p>The two moved off together, and entered the house, where they were quickly
  lost in the throng of guests. It was at this point that Jack joined Claire
  again, and told her rapidly what had happened.</p>

  <p>"I will go to her at once." Claire said. "It is quite evident, from what
  you say, that this poor woman acts entirely under the sinister influence of
  Anstruther. It would be a good thing, I fancy, to appeal to her better
  nature."</p>

  <p>Possibly it had been better for him to go off and warn Seymour, but the
  strong curiosity of the moment prevailed. He was just a little anxious about
  Claire, too. And Seymour was so full of cleverness and resource if anything
  untoward happened.</p>

  <p>The scheme commended itself to Jack. He would leave everything to Claire
  for the present. Then, when she was ready, she could come to him again.
  Apparently Anstruther had given Serena all her instructions, for Claire found
  her seated by herself in a corner of the ballroom watching the dazzling
  scene. Claire crept quietly to her side, and touched her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Serena," she said gently. "Serena, I want you."</p>

  <p>There was a violent agitation that shook the listener's frame; but she
  rose very gently, and passed along the corridor by Claire's side without the
  slightest protest. They came to a little alcove at length, and Claire bade
  her companion sit down.</p>

  <p>"I know why you are here to-night, she explained. "I even know what your
  appointed task is. But, what is still more Important, I am acquainted with
  the hold that Anstruther has upon you. Believe me, you have no firmer friend
  in the world than myself. Tell me your sad story, and let me see if I can
  help you."</p>

  <p>The gently spoken words were not without their effect. Heedless of
  consequences, Serena removed her mask, and proceeded to wipe the streaming
  tears, from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you everything." she murmured. "You know already that Lady
  Barmouth is my sister, and you are acquainted with the fact that Padini is my
  husand; but nobody knows besides Anstruther that I was once the mother of a
  little boy. I was always willful and headstrong. I was always ready to throw
  away my happiness for the whim of the moment. That is why I married Padini,
  who basely deserted me when he found that I had no money. A month after our
  marriage I was alone in the world, almost starving. I was too proud to send
  to my friends; I had meant to wait till my money was exhausted, and then
  throw myself into the river. But I dared not do that, because of the fresh
  young life which I knew was coming to me. I managed to make a little money,
  and when my child was born I was comparatively happy. When the hoy was about
  18 months old Anstruther found me out, and professed a desire to become my
  friend. It was about that time that Padini turned up again and began to
  blackmail me. I cannot tell you exactly what happened; they say I tried to
  kill him because he would have taken my child from me. At any rate, I have
  always always been informed that I might have suffered a long term of
  imprisonment if Anstruther had not stood my friend."</p>

  <p>"But this does not give him so great a power over you," Claire wild. "A
  mere act of charity like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I have not told you everything," Serena whispered. "For a short time
  I was a mad woman. And when I came to myself again, they told me that I had
  killed my boy. Oh. I have no wish to dwell upon that dreadful time&mdash;I
  hardly dare to think of it without a wild desire to lay hands upon myself.
  And yet there are times when I believe the whole thing to have been a wicked
  lie, a pure invention on the part of Anstruther. At those times I believe
  that my boy is still safe and sound, and that some day we shall meet again.
  This is the whole secret of the reason why I have clung to Anstruther, and
  why I have been the slave of his base designs. But this story must be told to
  no one, not even to Lady Barmouth."</p>

  <p>8erena might have said more, only the sound of approaching footsteps
  warned Claire of the necessity for caution. She whispered to Serena to
  replace her mask&mdash;a precaution that was none too soon, for Anstruther
  was impatiently coming down the corridor side by side with another man, whom
  Claire recognized as Lord Barmouth.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for you everywhere," Anstruther said. "What do you
  mean by hiding yourself here?"</p>

  <p>It was quite clear that Anstruther had lost his head for the moment. Lord
  Barmouth paused, and looked at the other sternly and coldly. Yet hesitated,
  as if half afraid to speak. He had the advantage over Anstruther in knowing
  who the latter was while still preserving the secret of his own identity.</p>

  <p>"I presume this lady is your wife," he said. "You would hardly speak even
  to your sister in that tone of voice."</p>

  <p>"You are candid, sir," Anstruther said bitterly. "If you knew who I am, I
  have not the slightest doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know perfectly well who you are," Barmouth said quietly. He had quite
  made up his mind what to do now. "Will you be good enough to step this way
  for a moment?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther followed, until Barmouth reached his own private room. Then he
  locked the door, and put up the light. "Now that we are face to face and free
  from interruption," he said, "I and going to speak still more candidly to
  you. But first let me ask you a question. Why did you decline the invitation
  of Lady Barmouth on the plea of a severe chill, and then come here
  afterwards, as if you wanted your presence in the house kept
secret&mdash;"<7P>

  <p>"Really," Anstruther stammered&mdash; "really, I cannot recognize your
right to
  cross-examine me like this. In the very unlikely event of your being my
  host&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We will discuss that presently," Barmouth replied. "Permit me to remind
  you that you have not answered my question, Mr, Anstruther. You will not deny
  your identity?" Anstruther laughed awkwardly, and, seeing that the game was
  up, removed his mask and pitched it on the table.</p>

  <p>"What I have done is not exactly a crime," he said. "I changed my mind,
  and came, at the last moment."</p>

  <p>"At the last moment," Barmouth echoed significantly. "You have been here
  for the past two hours."</p>

  <p>Anstruther moved towards the door. He declared, with some heat, that he
  would have no more of this, unless the other could prove his right to ask
  these questions. Barmouth turned away for a moment, and when he faced round
  again his face was bare of the mask.</p>

  <p>"Now you recognize my right," he said. "You black-hearted scoundrel, I am
  Lord Barmouth."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42">XLII &mdash; A PIECE OF MUSIC</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN other circumstances, Anstruther would have been pleased
  with the turn of events. He knew now that Smith, whom for so long he had been
  persecuting, was the rich Lord Barmouth. This, too, saved a deal of trouble;
  for instance, Serena need not have been brought here at all. Now Anstruther
  would be able to blackmail Barmouth for thousands, whereas he had been
  content with hundreds from the more humble Smith. Barmouth smiled, as he
  followed Anstruther's train of thought. He was reading the other's mind like
  an open book.</p>

  <p>"I know exactly what you are thinking about," he said. "You are not
  sighing for lost opportunities; you are going to make it all up in the
  future. Still, I have puzzled you and, perhaps, frightened you a little. You
  are perfectly well aware why I have concealed my identity for so long. And
  you would give a great deal to know why I have so suddenly come out and met
  you in the open. On that point I have no intention of gratifying your
  curiosity. You may put your mask on again, and I will resume mine; but of one
  thing you may be certain. Either as Lord Barmouth or as James Smith, not one
  farthing more will you ever receive from me."</p>

  <p>Barmouth turned contemptuously away, and unlocked the door.</p>

  <p>"Now you can go your way, and I will go mine," he said. "I shall say
  nothing of this to Lady Barmouth; at least, not for the present. Make the
  best of your evening's pleasure. It will be the last time you will ever be
  under my roof."</p>

  <p>With an irritated feeling of defeat Anstruther stalked from the room,
  followed by Lord Barmouth, who lost no chance of hunting up Jack and Rigby.
  He told his interested listeners what had happened.</p>

  <p>"I think you have acted wisely, Lord Barmouth," Rigby said. "We are so hot
  upon the track of Anstruther now that a day or two makes little difference.
  At the same time, I cannot quite see why Anstruther should have come here in
  this mysterious way, when he might have accompanied Claire quite openly."</p>

  <p>Jack was inspired with a sudden idea. "It's all a question of alibi," he
  said. "We know perfectly well what an ingenious scheme Anstruther has put up
  so that he may be what an Irishman would call in two places at the same time.
  Here's a magnificent opportunity of getting to the bottom of that mysterious
  music business."</p>

  <p>"Right you are," Rigby cried. "It would be like flying in the face of
  Providence to throw away such a chance. Anstruther is here, and likely to
  remain, and so is Serena. You may depend upon it that the other maid has gone
  to bed, so that we should have the house in Panton Square all to ourselves.
  You know the ropes better than I do, Jack. Can you tell us a good way of
  getting into the house without playing the burglar?"</p>

  <p>Jack thought a moment, then an inspiration came to him again; the thing
  was quite simple.</p>

  <p>"We can walk into the place as if it belonged to us," he said. "When
  Claire came away, Anstruther told her that he should retire early. Claire,
  did not wish to keep the servants up unduly, so she took a latch-key with
  her." "Absolutely made for us," Rigby exclaimed. "You go off to Miss Helmsley
  and borrow her latch-key, and we will get to the bottom of the whole mystery
  whilst Anstruther is enjoying himself here."</p>

  <p>Jack came back presently with the latch-key in his possession. It was an
  easy matter to get out of the house without being observed; then a cab was
  called and the two proceeded to Jack's chambers, where they stripped off
  their fancy dresses hastily and assumed more civilized attire.</p>

  <p>"I vote we take Bates into this business," Rigby suggested. "I've got a
  little idea of my own, which I will tell you about after we have been to
  Panton Square."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the services of Inspector Bates were not available, for he
  had been called out on some business of importance, and was not expected back
  till the following morning.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to go through it ourselves," Jack said. "You will have a
  fine lot of copy for <i>The Planet</i> a bit later on. I declare I am getting
  quite fascinated by my present occupation. Shall we take a cab, or would it
  not be more safe for us to walk?"</p>

  <p>Panton Square was reached at length, and No.5 appeared to be in total
  darkness. As the friends had anticipated, Serena's fellow servant had gone to
  bed, for neither at the front or back of the house was there so much as a
  glimmer of light to be seen</p>

  <p>An application of the latch-key to the door proved quite successful, and a
  minute later the two friends were inside. They had not the slightest
  hesitation in putting up the lights, so that the passing police might infer
  that the occupants of the place had returned. Not that he wanted to trouble
  much about anything but the study, seeing that it was there that the
  mysterious music always emanated.</p>

  <p>It was an ord1nary-looking room enough, the walls being entirely lined
  with books. There were books everywhere, not an inch of space being available
  for more. The ceiling was quite plain, and the closest search failed to
  disclose anything in the way of an apparatus by which the sounds of music
  could be conveyed from a distance into the study. Jack looked round with a
  puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"All the same. It must come that way," he said. "I know perfectly well
  that one of Padini's recitals came into this room as if it had been carried
  by some electrical means."</p>

  <p>"A sort of telephone, I suppose," Rigby said. "Of course, we have all
  heard of the theatrephone*, but we know it could not not work out in this
  case. With the dodge in question you have to plug both ears with a kind of
  receiver, and even then the music is only audible to those using the little
  receivers. In the present instance I understand that the whole room is
  flooded with melody, just as if the player were actually here."</p>

  <p>"You've got it exactly." Jack explained. "I have heard it myself, and so
  has Claire: and both at us spotted the music as being precisely the style of
  Padini. Hang me if I can see the slightest sign of how the thing is
  worked."</p>

  <p>Rigby said nothing; indeed, he was hardly listening. He was pacing round
  the room pulling armfuls of books out here and there, as if expecting, to
  find some cunning device hidden behind the volumes. He stooped to pick up
  Anstruther's violin case, which lay upon the floor. The case had been
  recently dropped, or some weight had fallen upon it, for the lid was cracked
  all across, and the hinges were broken. Rigby gave a little cry us he threw
  back the lid.</p>

  <p>"Here's, a discovery for you," he exclaimed. "Anstruther's violin with the
  neck broken off. If you will look at it closely, you will see that it is
  covered with dust, and evidently has not been used for days. Of course, it is
  just possible that Anstruther possesses two violins&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know as a matter of fact that he doesn't." Jack said. "This is his
  Cremona right enough. I have had it in my hands a hundred times."</p>

  <p>"We are getting on," Rigby laughed. "This room has been flooded with
  melody night after night, and yet we know for a fact that Anstruther's violin
  has been absolutely useless."</p>

  <p>"That does not help us to a solution of the problem," Jack said. "But I
  have an idea. We shall never get to the truth about Anstruther, but Padini
  may help us. Now it id very Improbable that Anstruther will be back under an
  hour. I'll stay here whilst you go off to the Great Metropolitan Hotel and
  see Padini. If you flatter him a bit, he will probably play to you. He will
  certainly do this in his own room, because professionals of mark never
  practice in public. What I am driving at is this: I feel quite certain that
  whatever Padini plays to you, I shall hear in this room."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," Rigby cried: "I will go at once."</p>

  <p>Late as it was, Padini had not gone to bed. Indeed, one of the corridor
  servants informed Rigby that the violinist had been practicing on his violin
  for the past hour. Without the slightest hesitation. Rigby made his way into
  Padini's room. The latter looked up with a puzzled air of surprise evidently
  he had been taking a little more champagne than was good for him.</p>

  <p>"I seem to know your face," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course you do," Rigby said smoothly. "Don't you remember me
  interviewing you for <i>The Planet</i>? I happened to be in the hotel, and I
  thought I would look you up. I suppose it would be too much to ask you to
  play something for me? I am passionately fond of music, to say nothing of
  being a great admirer of yours. Besides, I have a particular desire to hear
  you to-night."</p>

  <p>Padini looked up with just a shade of suspicion in his eyes. Rigby felt
  that perhaps he was going a bit too far. He proceeded to flatter the artist
  to such an extent that Padini's suspicions were quickly lulled to rest. There
  was a half-empty bottle of champagne on the table, but Rigby refused the
  proffered hospitality.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," he said. "I came to hear you play. I know that it was a
  great liberty on my part and, if you like, you can turn me out at
  once&mdash;but I wish you would play something."</p>

  <p>Padini rose rather unsteadily, and reached for his violin. Once his
  fingers grasped the neck of his instrument he seemed to be himself again.
  Rascal as the fellow was there was no doubt of his great artistic qualities.
  He handled his bow with the air and grip of a master. He started some slow
  movement from one of Beethoven's sonatas, and Rigby lay back in his chair,
  giving himself up entirely to the delight of the moment.</p>

  <p>It seemed, if Padini once started, he would not know when to stop, for he
  played one piece after another, entirely forgetting that he had an audience.
  Across Rigby's brain there came floating the germ of a great idea. Padini
  finished a brilliant passage, and the bow fell from his hands.</p>

  <p>"There, my friend," he said breathlessly. "Never have I played better than
  I have done to-night."</p>

  <p>"You are indeed a master," Rigby said, and he meant every word that he
  uttered. "An artist so great as yourself should be a composer also. Have you
  published anything at all?"</p>

  <p>The flattered artist replied that he had not published anything so far,
  but there were one or two little things which he had written in his spare
  time, and these he intended offering to some publisher who was prepared to
  pay a price for them.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind playing me one?" Rigby asked. "I should prefer a piece
  that nobody has ever heard."</p>

  <p>Padini swept his bow across the strings, and proceeded to play a perfect
  little gem in a minor key. To a certain extent it reminded Rigby of Gounod's
  "Ave Maria," though its originality and breadth deprived it of any suggestion
  of plagiarism.</p>

  <p>"Perfect in its way," Rigby said. "Would you mind giving me the score? If
  you will, I will get a good price for it from <i>The Planet</i> people. We
  are going to publish music at reasonable rates; and there is no reason why
  you should not have fifty guineas for yours."</p>

  <p>Padini declared that he quite shared Rigby's opinion. He took a sheet of
  of manuscript music from a drawer and threw it carelessly across to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"There you are," he said. "make the best bargain you can for me. Why, you
  are not going already?"</p>

  <p>Rigby said something to the effect that he had not yet finished his work
  at the office, and that he must tear himself away, much as he would have
  liked to have stayed to hear more of that beautiful music. A few minutes
  later Rigby left the room. As he glanced back he saw that Padini had fallen
  into his armchair again, and was already half asleep. Rigby smiled to
  himself, wondering what Padini would say if he knew the purpose to which the
  sheet of manuscript music would he devoted. He called a cab and hastened away
  in the direction of Panton Square, where he expected that Jack would be still
  awaiting him. The lights were up at No.5, just as they were when Rigby had
  started for the Great Metropolitan Hotel; but all the same, he took the
  precaution of whistling softly, in case anything had gone wrong. The front
  door opened cautiously, and Jack's head peeped out. A moment later and Rigby
  was inside.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he demanded impatiently, "Anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"A great deal," Jack replied. "For half an hour everything was quiet, then
  that wonderful music started again. Mind you, I haven't the remotest idea
  where it came from; I am just as much in the fog as ever. But it filled
  the,room as if some great artist was invisible to me. I could recognise
  Padini's touch. Of course, I am assuming that you found him at home, and
  persuaded him to play to you. Can I take that for granted?"</p>

  <p>"It is exactly as you say," Rigby explained. "Please go on."</p>

  <p>"Then I will tell you what Padini played. He started with the first part
  of 'The Moonlight Sonata.'"</p>

  <p>Rigby nodded and smiled. His, smile broadened as Jack proceeded to tick
  off the pieces of music just as they were played.</p>

  <p>"There was one. however, that I could not follow." he said. "It was that
  lovely, little thing at the end. I am absolutely certain that it was an
  original piece of music."</p>

  <p>Rigby laughed as he produced the scrap of manuscript from his pocket.
  There was an expression of triumph on his face.</p>

  <p>"Original, and in my possession," he cried. "This scrap of paper contains
  the key of the whole situation."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43">XLIII &mdash; THE TRAP IS BAITED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK looked inquiringly at his friend. He had not yet fully
  grasped the significance of Rigby's remark. He asked for an explanation.
  Rigby went on to speak rapidly.</p>

  <p>"It's like this, you see," he remarked, "When I saw that fellow just now
  and got him to play to me, a rather good idea came into my mind. So long as
  Anstruther can manage to delude us into believing that he spends most of his
  evenings in playing classical music, we can't get much further. Classical
  music is open to everybody: and if we allege that on a certain evening
  Anstruther performed one of Beethoven's sonatas&mdash;or, rather, that Padini
  performed it&mdash;we should have great difficulty in proving our point."</p>

  <p>"I think I can catch your idea," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would. My idea was to get something original; something, if
  possible, that Anstruther has never even heard. He couldn't very well play a
  piece he had never heard, now would he? I asked Padini if he had anything of
  the kind in hand, and he played the piece which you so much liked. As I said
  just now, I have the thing in my pocket; and by means of that simple sheet of
  paper we are going to trap Anstruther."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see it," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"What I mean is that we are going to manage it between us. Unless I am
  greatly mistaken, events will move very rapidly to-morrow night. Anstruther
  must of necessity be out most of the time after dinner, but the music in the
  study will go on all the same. You must manage to dine in Panton Square
  to-morrow night, and I will work the thing from the Great Metropolitan Hotel
  with Padini. In the course of the evening Padini will play the melody which
  we are now talking about, and you will hear it. Now, I know Miss Helmsley is
  a very capable pianist, and I want her to follow the air carefully, so that
  she will be able to play it by ear. Then we shall be in a position to ask
  Anstruther the name of the piece that attracted her so much. Miss Helmsley
  can pick it out on the piano for him, and ask him to play it again. You can
  imagine his difficulty, but you can hardly imagine a way out of it. This is
  only a side issue, I know; but it will all tell when we bring Anstruther to
  book and expose the whole conspiracy."</p>

  <p>Jack appreciated the point and promised to do his best to bring the comedy
  to a successful issue. There was nothing for it now but to reassume their
  fancy dresses and return to Belgrave Square. By this time a considerable
  number of the guests were moving on elsewhere, though the majority of those
  present meant to see the thing through. As the cab bearing Jack and Rigby
  drove up they saw the tall figure of Anstruther coming down the steps. He
  stood there as if hesitating, for a moment, then called a passing cab and
  gave some directions to Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>"Any money I know where he is going," Rigby said. "My dear fellow, you go
  inside and see Miss Helmsley, whilst I take this cab back to our rooms and
  change again into civilized attire."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do now?" Jack asked. "I am going to follow
  Anstruther," Rigby explained. "I feel so restless to-night that I can't
  settle down anything. So I am just going to follow that fellow, who is most
  assuredly going to see Carrington."</p>

  <p>It was half an hour later before Rigby found himself, minus his fancy,
  dress in Piccadilly opposite the rooms occupied by Carrington. It was very
  late now, and Piccadilly was absolutely deserted, save for a passing
  policeman and a stray night cab whose driver appeared to be asleep upon his
  box. Rigby hesitated for a moment, a little uncertain as to what to do. There
  was no difficulty in ascertaining as to whether Carrington had or had not
  gone to bed; for the lights were up in his sitting room, and presently a
  shadow appeared upon the blind. Doubtless, this was Carrington, and all
  speculation was set at rest an instant later by a second shadow on one of the
  blinds. The gigantic headdress of Anstruther loomed large against the
  light.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it now but to wait patiently upon the course of
  events. Rigby pulled at the leg of the slumbering cabman and brought him to a
  sense of his responsibilities.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to take your cab anywhere," he explained. "All I want is to
  hire it for an hour or so and sit inside. You can go to sleep again if you
  like, and I'll wake you when I am ready to go. It will be an easy way of
  earning half a sovereign."</p>

  <p>The cabman grinned and nodded as Rigby disappeared into the recesses of
  the cab. It was, perhaps, an hour later before the door leading to
  Carrington's flat opened and Anstruther came out. Evidently he had left his
  fancy dress behind him, for he was attired in a rough coat and deerstalker
  hat. Carrington appeared to be dissuading his friend from something, and
  Rigby could, hear the latter laugh in reply.</p>

  <p>"I tell you it must be done," Anstruther said, "and it will have to be
  done to-morrow night. I shall see friend Charlie without delay. If he is not
  in, I shall leave a settled note for him."</p>

  <p>Anstruther strode off down the street and presently hailed another cab
  which was crawling down the road. Rigby sat up and aroused his own
  driver.</p>

  <p>"Here's another five shillings for you," he said. "Keep that cab in front
  of you in sight, and follow it till it stops. Then you shall have fifteen
  shillings. Unless I am greatly mistaken, you will not have very far to
  go."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Rigby had summed up the situation quite correctly.
  The mention of the name of Charlie had given him the clue he required, this
  same Charlie being none other than the professional cracksman who had been
  engaged by Anstruther to deliver the letter at the Great Metropolitan Hotel
  to Ferris. This deduction proved to be absolutely correct, for a little time
  later the first cab pulled up in front of the tenement house where Seymour
  had taken up his temporary quarters.</p>

  <p>Rigby dismissed the cab, and followed cautiously. He was in time to see
  Anstruther take a key from his pocket and let himself quietly into the rooms
  occupied by the individual who was known to his friends and admirers as
  "Simple Charlie." Then Rigby turned and knocked for admission at the outer
  door of Seymour's apartments. The latter did not appear in the least
  surprised to see Rigby.</p>

  <p>"I came here quite by chance," the latter explained. "I quite expected to
  be told that you had not returned home yet. Lady Barmouth's dance might have
  kept on till daylight."</p>

  <p>"I had to come away," Seymour explained. "In fact, I lost sight of
  Anstruther, and it rather put me out. Can you tell me anything about him? But
  of course you can, or you would not be here."</p>

  <p>Rigby explained at length what had taken place during the last hour.
  Seymour chuckled as he listened.</p>

  <p>"Rather a good joke," he said. "Here is Anstruther looking for his friend
  'Simple Charlie,' whilst all the time we have that desirable individual tight
  by the leg at the Great Metropolitan Hotel. I suppose you can pretty well
  guess what's going to happen? Anstruther was desperately frightened to-night
  by my allusion to that set of Cellini plate. He will know no peace of mind
  until that stuff is removed from Carrington's private safe. There will be
  another burglary, of a sort, and 'Simple Charlie' has been selected to open
  the safe. You see, as the safe is not in the vaults, but in Carrington's
  private office, it would never do to use dynamite there."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well." Rigby objected. "But bow is Anstruther going to
  make use of 'Simple Charlie' so long as the latter is in our hands? That
  seems to be rather an objection."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have thought all that out," Seymour laughed. "From what you told me
  just now, it is evident that Anstruther means to leave a note for his pal if
  the latter is away. In the event of 'Simple Charlie' being professionally
  engaged elsewhere to-morrow night, he will be asked to find a substitute. As
  we are perfectly well aware of the fact that there is no chance of Anstruther
  finding his friend at home, it is only logical to assume that he will leave
  the note behind. In a few moments that note will be in our possession and we
  shall be in a position to read it at leisure. Then I shall take it first
  thing in the morning round to the Great Metropolitan Hotel, and force 'Simple
  Charlie' to write a suitable reply. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite." Rigby said. "You are going to choose your own substitute.
  Have you fixed upon him yet?"</p>

  <p>Seymour chuckled in reply, but declined to afford any information for the
  present. He suggested that Rigby should go outside and see if Anstruther had
  gone yet. Rigby came back presently with information to the effect that the
  burglar's outer door was locked, thus fairly assuming that Anstruther had
  executed his task and had gone. Seymour produced the simple apparatus by
  means of which be had entered the burglar's rooms on the last occasion.</p>

  <p>"I am going to get that letter," be explained simply. "You need not have
  any fear about me. Open the window, please."</p>

  <p>In less than five minutes Seymour was back again with the letter in his
  hands. He laid it on the table, and then proceeded to steam the envelope open
  with the aid of a kettle of hot water which he procured from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>There was very little in the letter but that little was to the point. The
  writer curtly commanded the recipient to meet him to-morrow night at a
  quarter to twelve outside the Mansion House Station of the Underground
  Railway. The recipient was enjoined to come prepared for business, and the
  last three words had been underlined. In the event of that being impossible
  "Simple Charlie" was asked to procure a substitute and let the writer of the
  letter know this no later than 10 o'clock the next morning in the old way and
  at the old address. It was all perfectly plain.</p>

  <p>"You see exactly what this means," Seymour said. "I take it that 'the old
  address' means Panton Square. But 'Simple Charlie' will have to tell me all
  about that in the morning. He shall write to Anstruther and put everything in
  order first. I have, prepared a very pretty little surprise for
  Anstruther."</p>

  <p>Seymour chuckled again, but refused to gratify Rigby's curiosity. He was
  taking no risks, he said; he even went so far as to seal down the letter
  again and return it to the burglar's rooms.</p>

  <p>"We cannot afford to make a single mistake." he said. "Any little slip
  might ruin the whole delicate business."</p>

  <p>There was nothing further to do, at least, so far as the night was
  concerned. It was getting very late now, and Rigby declined Seymour's offer
  of a whisky-and-soda and cigar. He turned as though to go, and held out his
  hand to Seymour. Then he paused as a sudden thought struck him.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing we have forgotten," he said. "Don't you think it would
  be as well to take Bates into our confidence. We had arranged to do so
  really, but when we called an hour or two ago at Shannon Street police
  station he was not in. I don't know whether you agree with me or not, but I
  think he would be extremely useful to us just now."</p>

  <p>Seymour nodded and chuckled. He seemed to be in the enjoyment of some good
  joke which he desired to keep to himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we must have Bates in this, by all means. Perhaps you would not mind
  leaving a message as you go along, and ask him to be good enough to call here
  not later than nine to-morrow morning. I think I can promise Inspector Bates
  that his time with me will not be wasted. And now, if you must go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Rigby took the hint and departed. He left the message for Bates, who, he
  was informed, might not be at the office the whole of the next day. This
  being so, Rigby rose early, and made his way to Shannon Street police station
  directly after breakfast. He was fortunate enough to catch Bates, who
  appeared to be in a tremendous hurry. He had five minutes to spare, he
  exclaimed, but a quarter of an hour had elapsed before Bates rose and rang
  his bell.</p>

  <p>"The other business must wait." he said. "Important as it is, I will go
  and call on Seymour at once."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44">XLIV &mdash; THE SUBSTITUTE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was nearly 11 o'clock before Bates reached Seymour's
  rooms. He listened patiently to all that the latter had to say, and he
  chuckled grimly when Seymour's plot was laid before him.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, sir, you ought to have been in the force yourself," he
  exclaimed. "I never heard a neater scheme. I have been puzzling my brains the
  last day or two for some way of getting hold of Anstruther. I can nobble
  Carrington at any moment; in fact, I have a warrant for his arrest in my
  pocket now. You see, I can easily prove that he has been disposing of his
  clients' securities, but that hardly affects Anstruther. I suppose you want
  me to go round to the Great Metropolitan Hotel, and compel 'Simple Charlie'
  to act as Bonnot* for us. I have not the slightest doubt that he will be able
  to find a good substitute if he likes. But there is one little difficulty in
  the way which you have not thought of."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Presumably a reference to the French criminal anarchist
  Jules Bonnot (1876-1912). See <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Bonnot">Wikpipedia.</a></p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I have." Seymour replied. "I know perfectly well what you mean.
  You mean that even a burglar has some code of honor, and that he would
  hesitate to betray a pal into such a trap as this. But if the substitute that
  I have in my mind is acceptable to you, there is no reason or further
  anxiety."</p>

  <p>Seymour scribbled a name on a sheet of paper, and handed it across to
  Bates. The latter laughed as he read it. "Oh, most assuredly you ought to
  have been in the force," he said. "The thing is so clever, and yet so
  delightfully simple."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Masefield was carrying out his side of the programme.</p>

  <p>He saw Rigby once or twice during the day, and the latter informed him
  that everything was going splendidly.</p>

  <p>"I was at the Great Metropolitan Hotel this morning," he explained: "in
  fact, I was present at the interview between Bates and a man known as 'Simple
  Charlie.' We had not the slightest difficulty in getting that rascal to do
  everything that we wish. He seemed ready to do anything to save his own skin.
  As I told you just now, the old address mentioned in Anstruther's letter was
  Panton Square. By 10 o'clock this morning Anstruther had received a letter,
  in 'Simple Charlie's' handwriting, saying that it was quite impossible for
  him to come himself, but that he would send an efficient substitute, who
  would meet Anstruther at the Mansion House Station at the appointed time. All
  you have to do now is to invite yourself to dinner at Panton Square, and in
  the course of the evening you will be pretty sure to hear the music going on
  in the study as usual. Of course, Anstruther will not be there but that will
  make no difference to the harmonic programme. And mind you, listen carefully
  for the original piece of music you heard last night."</p>

  <p>"How are you going to manage that?" Jack asked. "Well, you see, we have
  divided ourselves up into three companies," Rigby explained. "You are going
  to look after Panton Square, Bates and Seymour will engineer the campaign as
  far as the City and Provincial Bank is concerned, and I am going to have
  supper with Padini. He elected that the supper should take place in his own
  room at the hotel. You can guess why."</p>

  <p>Jack began to see matters more clearly now. The task allotted to himself
  was plain and simple He would have preferred something more in the way of
  adventure; but, after all, somebody must do the ordinary work. He managed to
  see Anstruther in the afternoon, and intimated to him that he was dining in
  Panton Square that night. Anstruther replied that he was glad to hear it;
  possibly, Jack thought, because there would be an ear-witness to prove the
  music in the study.</p>

  <p>It was nearly eight o'clock when Jack strolled into the drawing room of
  Panton Square, and found Claire alone there. He deemed it prudent not to tell
  her too much of what had taken place the last few hours; indeed, he was more
  concerned to hear the latest information about Serena.</p>

  <p>"I have not seen much of her to-day," Claire said. "I do not know what to
  make of her at all. Last night, late, she came into my bedroom, and we had a
  long talk about her boy. It is a very strange thing, Jack, that only this
  morning a man arrived to see my guardian&mdash;a man who seemed to be annoyed
  at Mr. Anstruther's refusal to pay him a sum of money. I happened to overhear
  a few words as they parted. The stranger declared that if he did not have
  something definite by Saturday, 'he would send the kid back.' I should have
  thought nothing of this unless I had heard Serena story last night, but,
  taken in conjunction with what she said, I shouldn't wonder if the man in
  question had not the custody of the poor woman's child."</p>

  <p>"This is interesting," Jack said. "Did you take any particular note of the
  man's appearance?"</p>

  <p>Claire replied that she had not failed to do so. But she had not followed
  him, though her suspicions were aroused.</p>

  <p>Jack debated the thing in his mind for a moment before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"We know perfectly well," he said, "that Anstruther is terribly pressed
  for ready money. He is certain not to send that cheque, and it is equally
  certain that the man will call again for the money on Saturday morning. It
  will be an easy matter to get Bates to lend me a plain clothes man and follow
  the fellow wherever he goes. But you must understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What more Jack would have said was prevented by the entrance of
  Anstruther, closely followed by the announcement of dinner. It was not a gay
  meal, for the host was moody and depressed. He talked brilliantly at times,
  then lapsed into a reverie, and appeared not to hear when spoken to. Claire
  rose presently with a sigh of relief, glad to get away from the gloom of the
  dining room and its depressing atmosphere. Anstruther smoked half a
  cigarette, and then threw the end down impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I must really get you to excuse me," he said. "But my head is so bad that
  I can hardly hold it up. I am afraid that even my music will fall to soothe
  me to-night."</p>

  <p>Jack murmured something in the way of polite sympathy. He was glad of the
  opportunity to be able to escape to the drawing room, where he sat for a long
  time discussing the situation with Claire. It was pleasant and soothing to
  sit there with his arm about her and her head lovingly upon his shoulder;
  but, happy as they were, they could not altogether shake off the feeling of
  impending evil. All this time the music of the violin floated mournfully from
  the study.</p>

  <p>Eleven o'clock struck, and still the melody went on. Claire roused herself
  a little presently, and a look of pleased interest crossed her pretty
  face.</p>

  <p>"What a delightful little composition," she said. "I have never heard that
  before. I am quite sure that is original."</p>

  <p>"Listen very carefully," Jack said, "I want you to impress that piece of
  music on your mind."</p>

  <p>The piece was finished at length, and then repeated once more. As the last
  strains died away, Claire rose from her comfortable seat and crossed over to
  the piano. Very quietly, yet quite correctly, she went through the whole
  composition.</p>

  <p>"I am glad it has so impressed you," Jack said. "You will, perhaps, be
  surprised to hear that Anstruther has never heard that piece Of music in his
  life, and that it was composed by Padini, who has never played it to anybody
  till last night, when he performed it for Rigby's benefit. Not only this, but
  he gave Dick Rigby the original manuscript to get published for him. I know
  this is only a small matter, but these small matters will make a mountain of
  evidence against Anstruther when the time comes."</p>

  <p>"It is very extraordinary," Claire murmured, "to think that that music
  should sound so charming and natural, and we know that all the time the
  player is a mile or two away. You are sure that my guardian is not in his
  study, Jack?"</p>

  <p>Jack was sure enough on that point. It was a few moments later that Serena
  came quietly into the room with a request that Mr. Masefield would go to the
  telephone, as some one desired to speak to him on pressing business. Jack
  rose with alacrity.</p>

  <p>"I shall soon be able to prove to you that Anstruther is a long way off,
  or I am very much mistaken," he said. "Very well, Serena, I will come down at
  once."</p>

  <p>The voice at the other end of the telephone inquired cautiously if that
  were Mr. Masefield. Jack replied that it was, but even then the questioner
  did not appear to be satisfied.</p>

  <p>"I think I recognize your voice," he said, "but one has to be very careful
  in sending messages to Panton Square. How goes the music? Anything original
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"One piece," Jack smiled. "I know what you mean, and I don't mind making
  you a small bet that you are Inspector Bates."</p>

  <p>The voice at the other end of the telephone chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You have got it quite right, Mr. Masefield," he said. "I am Bates sure
  enough. And you needn't worry about going downstairs to see whether or not
  Anstruther is playing at Paganini, because he isn't on the premises at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Where are you speaking from?" Jack asked. Bates replied that he was
  speaking from a public call office in the neighborhood of Mansion House
  Station. All he wanted to do was to make sure that Jack was still in Panton
  Square, and now that his mind was easy on this score he could devote himself
  to the serious business of the evening. Anstruther had just been shadowed
  outside the Mansion House Station, where he was apparently waiting for the
  substitute so kindly provided for him by "Simple Charlie."</p>

  <p>The message ceased here, and the connection was cut off. Jack would have
  been just a little surprised if he had seen the transmogrified Bates who had
  been speaking to him over the line. The inspector crossed the road and
  disappeared into the shadow. Anstruther stood there, glancing impatiently up
  and down the road as if waiting for somebody that was late.</p>

  <p>A figure slouched up to him and a hoarse voice whispered in his ear:
  "Party of the name of Maggs," he said in his gin-and-fog voice. "Pal of
  'Simple Charlie.' Old Charlie couldn't get away to-night, so he sent me
  instead. Don't you be disappointed, guv'nor; you will find me just as clever
  with them bits of steel as Charles himself. Bit of burglary, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther nodded curtly. "We had better walk along." he said. "I suppose
  your friend explained to you that this little job will put twenty pounds in
  your pocket? It is a mere matter of opening a safe. The getting into the
  premises is perfectly simple, because I have come provided with the keys. You
  know the City and Provincial Bank?"</p>

  <p>The other man grinned, and remarked that banks generally were a bit above
  his form. Anstruther smiled as he reflected that he had the keys of the bank
  premises proper in his pocket, so that there would be no great difficulty in
  getting into the counting house, and from there to Carrington's private
  office. As to the night watchmen&mdash;that was another matter altogether. In
  the face of recent happenings, they would be more alert than they had been in
  the past; but, at the same time, their attention would be bestowed more upon
  the cellars than the office.</p>

  <p>The road was entirely deserted now, as Anstruther crossed the street and
  gently turned the key in the outer door. A moment later and the pair were in
  Carrington's private office. They could afford to turn the lights up, for the
  iron shutters outside made a perfect screen. In one corner of the room stood
  the safe upon which the man who called himself Maggs was intended to operate.
  Anstruther pointed at it impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Get to work at once," he said. "There is something inside that I must
  take away to-night."</p>

  <p>"A fine set of Cellini plate, I presume?" Maggs said, in an entirely
  different voice. "No, you don't, Mr. Anstruther. If you put your hand in your
  hip pocket. I'll blow your brains out. I have the advantage of you here, and
  I am going to keep it."</p>

  <p>"Who the deuce are you?" Anstruther stammered. His hands had fallen to his
  side, and his face was pale and ghastly. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>The so-called burglar snatched away his wig and ragged beard, and with a
  handkerchief changed the aspect of his face. "I am Inspector Bates." he said.
  "Very much at your service."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45">XLV &mdash; CAUGHT!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BATES had laid his plans very carefully and very well
  Indeed. In many respects Rigby had got the best of the detective, but this
  was as much due to circumstances as anything else. Still, when it came to the
  technical side of the case, Rigby was no match for the Inspector. It was
  nearly 9 o'clock before Bates called at Carrington's rooms and asked to see
  the latter. There was no occasion yet for Bates to assume the very effective
  disguise with which he was to trick Anstruther. There would be plenty of time
  for that. Carrington was just finishing his dinner&mdash;so his man said; he
  was not very well, and did not care to see anybody. But Bates put the man
  aside in his own. easy way, and walked into the dining-room without the
  trouble of announcing himself.</p>

  <p>That Carrington was suffering from some mental and physical excitement was
  perfectly plain. His face was ghastly pale, his eyes were bloodshot, and
  there was a twitching of his lips which told a plain tale to an experienced
  officer like Bates. Carrington scowled, and demanded the meaning of this
  unwarrantable intrusion.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you will find it unwarrantable when you have heard me to
  the finish." Bates said. "Nor will it pay you to take this tone with me. I am
  an inspector from Scotland Yard, and unless you answer my questions freely, I
  shall have to put them in a more disagreeable form."</p>

  <p>Carrington changed his note altogether. His face become still more pallid.
  He motioned Bates to a chair. He would have found it hard to have spoken just
  then. Bates waited a moment to give the other time to recover. Carrington at
  length found words to ask Bates what his business was with him.</p>

  <p>"It is with regard to your affair at the bank," the Inspector explained.
  "You may not be aware of the fact, but the case has been placed in my hands
  by my superiors."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are alluding to the burglary," Carrington said.</p>

  <p>"We will call it a burglary for the present," Bates replied, with a
  significance that there was no mistaking. "I have gone into the matter
  carefully, and I have come to the conclusion that there Was no burglary at
  all."</p>

  <p>Carrington jumped to his feet with a well-simulated air of indignation. He
  advanced toward Bates threateningly.</p>

  <p>"You insolent scoundrel!" he cried. "What do you mean? Do you know you are
  dealing with a gentleman and man of honor?"</p>

  <p>"Softly, softly." Bates replied. "I think we had better understand one
  another. I have in my possession at the present moment a warrant for your
  arrest for fraud and embezzlement relating to certain jewels and other
  valuables deposited in your keeping by various clients. It is in my power to
  execute that warrant at once. The case is much too serious a one for ball,
  and it is for you to say whether you will remain for the present in your
  comfortable quarters, or pass, at any rate, the next two months in jail."</p>

  <p>Carrington made no further show of fight. He collapsed into his chair and
  wiped his wet forehead distractedly.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that," he groaned. "There must be some terrible mistake
  here. Why, all the evidence pointed to an ingenious and daring burglary. The
  night watchmen were drugged, as you know, and the thieves employed dynamite
  to blow up the safes. No one regrets the loss of all those valuables more
  than I do, but even banks are not secure against the modern burglar. Those
  safes were crammed full of valuables, as I could easily prove."</p>

  <p>"They were." Bates corrected. "But I am in a position to prove a few
  things, too. You wouldn't give a great deal, I suppose, to know where those
  valuables are?"</p>

  <p>Carrington replied to the effect that he would give half his fortune for
  the desired information. Bates smiled.</p>

  <p>"You need not worry about it." he said. "I have a list in my pocket of the
  big pawnbrokers in London where most of the goods were pledged. In three
  cases the pawnbrokers in question are in a position to swear to the identity
  of the man who handled the jewels. You would not, of course, mind meeting
  these people?"</p>

  <p>But Carrington had no reply. He looked so helplessly at Bates that the
  latter could not but feel sorry for him.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid the game is up, sir," he said. "My investigations of this
  case prove most conclusively that you are at the bottom of the whole thing.
  We know perfectly well that recent speculations of yours have brought about a
  financial crisis in your hank. In your desperate need, you realised the
  securities which certain clients had left in your hands. It was only when
  Lady Barmouth called for her gems that the situation became acute. But that
  will form the basis of another charge."</p>

  <p>"But that was all a mistake," Carrington gurgled eagerly. "I sent Lady
  Barmouth her gems, but they proved to be those belonging to somebody else. I
  assure you that was quite an error."</p>

  <p>Bates shrugged his shoulders impatiently. He was getting annoyed with this
  man, who refused to follow his lead.</p>

  <p>"We know all about that ingenious fraud," he said. "We are quite aware of
  that clever business of the paste gems, for which you gave &pound;200 at
  Clarkenwell. You paid for that rubbish with Bank of England notes marked with
  the stamp of your establishment. It was a very happy idea of yours and
  Anstruther's."</p>

  <p>Carrington groaned feebly; he began to fear the very worst.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know everything," he said. "Perhaps you can tell me the story
  of the burglary?"</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that presently," Bates said coolly. "Now you were at your
  wits' ends to know what to do. You knew perfectly well that many of your
  clients would require their jewels for Lady Barmouth's dance. They were not
  forthcoming, for the simple reason that they had been pledged elsewhere. You
  had not the necessary cunning to devise some scheme to shift the blame from
  your shoulders, so you called in your friend Anstruther. It was he who hit
  upon the idea of the burglary. It was you who placed temptation in the way of
  the night watchmen through the medium of a couple of bottles of drugged port
  wine. After that the rest was easy. You had only to enter the bank with your
  own keys&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop a moment," Carrington cried eagerly. "You seem to forget that even I
  cannot enter the vaults of the bank without duplicate keys in the possession
  of various cashiers."</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me," Bates said impressively. "This discussion is
  absolutely irregular. It is my plain duty to arrest you at once and convey
  you to Bow street. But if you help me, I may be in the position later on to
  do you a service. We know precisely how Anstruther used the dynamite; we know
  precisely what happened in the vaults, and how most of the few valuables that
  remained were conveyed to your own private safe. More than that, we are
  perfectly well aware what fee Anstruther demanded for his trouble. Need I go
  into the matter of that service of Cellini plate?"</p>

  <p>Carrington threw up his hands with a gesture of despair. He was crushed
  and beaten to the ground by the tremendous weight of evidence with which
  Bates was overwhelming him.</p>

  <p>"It is no use fighting any longer." he said. "I confess to everything. I
  shall plead guilty, and afford you every information in my power. Do you want
  me to come along with you now?"</p>

  <p>On the whole, Bates rather thought not. He had effected his purpose, and
  sooner or later Carrington would have to become his prisoner. He knew that
  the latter would speak freely enough, like the craven coward that he was; but
  there was Anstruther to be thought of. Bates rose to leave.</p>

  <p>"You can remain where you are for the present," he said. "But if you will
  take my advice, you will make no attempt to escape&mdash;you are too
  carefully watched for that. And now, good-night."</p>

  <p>Bates went off in the direction of the city feeling that the last hour had
  not been pasted. On the strength of recent information, he would have felt
  justified in arresting Anstruther also. But he had a wholesome admiration for
  that individual, and the more evidence secured against him the better.
  Therefore it was that Bates was about to carry out the latter part of the
  programme, in which he was to play the part of substitute for "Simple
  Charlie." The programme has been easily arranged. There had been no
  difficulty in persuading the burglar to write the desired letter to
  Anstruther, and Bates had made up his mind from the first that the mythical
  Maggs should be none other than himself. From first to last the thing worked
  admirably. Anstruther was utterly deceived by the detective's admirable
  disguise, which he had assumed after leaving Carrington, and had fallen
  headlong into the trap.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was that the two men stood facing one another in Carrington's
  office. Anstruther white and furious, Bates coolly contemptuous, with a
  revolver in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What have you to say for yourself?" Bates asked. "Have you any reason to
  show why I should not take you straight to Bow street on the charge of
  burglary?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther was fighting hard to regain possession of himself. Bates could
  not but admire the marvelous courage of the man. Anstruther's laugh had
  something quite genuine about it.</p>

  <p>"We are making a great fuss over a little thing," he said. "I came here
  because Mr. Carrington was not well enough to accompany me. There are certain
  things of mine in my friend's private safe here, and unfortunately he has
  lost the key. It was imperative that I should have my property to-night, and
  that will, perhaps, explain my presence here. Does that satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>"I should be easily satisfied if it did," Bates said coolly. "I should
  like to know, for instance, why you require the assistance of a professional
  burglar. I know perfectly well that you called in the assistance of 'Simple
  Charlie,' but I was in a position to force that individual's hand&mdash;hence
  my appearance in his place."</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Bates," Anstruther smiled. "I had expected better things from
  you. You are perfectly well aware of the fact that I am acquainted with half
  the thieves in London. It was no use asking any safe-maker in London to try
  to pick that lock, because it happens to be a French make. In such awkward
  circumstances as this it is no new thing to call in a cracksman when things
  are wanted in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that won't do," Bates said. "You had plenty of time to call
  in legitimate assistance, whereas so recently as last night you visited
  'Simple Charlie' and left a note for him."</p>

  <p>Anstruther smiled politely. He was perfectly cool and collected
  now&mdash;a match for any detective in the force.</p>

  <p>"We can settle the matter in two minutes," he said. "All you have to do is
  to call in one of your men from outside and send a note to Carrington, who
  will reply to the effect that I am here with his full knowledge and
  consent."</p>

  <p>"Can't do it." Bates said curtly. "I have no man to send. As a matter of
  fact, I am alone in this business."</p>

  <p>Anstruther bent down his head to conceal a smile. There was something
  devilish in the cunning ferocity of his eyes. He had discovered an important
  fact, and Bates did not seem to understand for the moment what he had given
  away. He felt quite sure that he had matters in his own hands now. He
  strolled slowly round the table, and proceeded to examine carefully the lock
  of the safe.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think you I could open this?" he asked. "If you could I
  should have no difficulty in proving to you&mdash;" Anstruther broke off
  suddenly; his left foot shot out dexterously, and Bates came half stumbling
  on his knees. Like lightning Anstruther grabbed for the revolver. He had
  Bates' wrist in a grip of steel, forcing his hand back till the fingers were
  bound to relax their grip on the weapon. A moment later the revolver was
  kicked away, and the two men were struggling desperately on the floor.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the look on Anstruther's face. He was going to
  murder Bates if he could. It would never do for any living soul to know that
  he was here to-night. Once Bates' mouth was silenced forever, he could hurry
  back to Panton Square, and there prove such an alibi as would hold good in
  any legal court in the world. All these things passed through that wily brain
  as his hands clutched closer at Bates' throat.</p>

  <p>It was touch and go with the latter. The only thing he could do was to
  fight for his breath, and husband his strength for a final effort later on.
  He looked straight into the gleaming eyeballs of his assailant now, but he
  could not see the faintest suggestion of pity there. The world began to dance
  before his eyes; a thousand stars seemed to be bursting from the dark sky,
  then came along the corridor the echo of fast-approaching footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Curse it." Anstruther muttered. "Another moment, and I should have been
  safe. Take that, you hound."</p>

  <p>With one final blow he jumped to his feet, and, sprinting across the
  office floor, darted into the shadow of the night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46">XLVI. &mdash; THE MUSIC STOPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BATES was sitting up in bed nursing an aching head, and
  plotting out schemes whereby he could best retrieve the disaster of the
  previous night. It was fortunate for the inspector that one of Carrington's
  night watchmen should have heard something of the disturbance on the previous
  night, and come hotfoot to his assistance. There was no great damage done
  beyond a bruised face and a general shock to the system. Bates felt all the
  better for a good night's rest, and was quite ready now to carry on the
  campaign against his powerful foe.</p>

  <p>It was some time in the afternoon before Jack Masefield put in an
  appearance at Bate's lodgings, having been summoned there by a special
  messenger. Jack smiled as he noticed Bate's somewhat dilapidated
  condition.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked. "You do not seem to have been as successful
  as you might&mdash;I mean over last night's business. Was the thing a
  failure, or were you satisfied?"</p>

  <p>Bates explained that up to now the battle was a drawn one. He had a
  feeling that Jack would be able to help him, and that was why he asked him to
  call this afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least dissatisfied with my last night's work," he
  explained. "In the first place, we have Carrington absolutely at our mercy. I
  let him know what we have discovered, and he will do anything for us that we
  desire. After that. I played the part of the mythical Maggs, and in due
  course disclosed myself to Mr. Anstruther. Perhaps I was a little too
  confident; anyway, I gave him a chance to murder me, and he responded to the
  opportunity with absolute enthusiasm. But for the opportune arrival of the
  night watchman, Scotland Yard would have lost one of Its most distinguished
  ornaments. It was a very near thing, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"But what could he possibly gain by that?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see. I had let him know that I was quite alone in the
  business," said Bates. "At the same time, he was not aware that my
  information was so complete. If he could murder me and get safe home without
  being detected, he was in a position to prove an absolute alibi. Of course, I
  did not dream that I was running any risk of my life&mdash;but that is not
  the point. You will remember my suggesting to you yesterday the advisability
  of you dining in Panton Square last night. I suppose that was all right?"</p>

  <p>Jack replied that he had followed Bates' instructions out implicitly. He
  had done all he could in that way.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. You see what I am driving at. I take it for granted that
  Anstruther's mysterious musical friend was much in evidence last night. I
  have no doubt that Miss Helmsley and yourself listened with rapt attention to
  the music in the study."</p>

  <p>"We had every opportunity of doing so," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I expected. Anstruther must have left the house a
  little after ten o'clock, and I don't see how it was possible for him to
  return much before half-past twelve. I suppose you didn't happen to see him
  when he came in?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I did," Jack said. "It was quite half-past twelve when I was
  leaving the house. The music was still in progress, but when I slipped out of
  the front door, Anstruther was rapidly approaching the house running across
  the lawn. He seemed very much annoyed and put out when he saw me, and
  muttered something to the effect that he had heard somebody trying the front
  door. I understood him to say that he had not been out all the evening, but
  that was all nonsense. I could see by his boots that he had been walking some
  considerable distance. Of course, you see what the dodge is; he does not
  leave the house by the door, but by the French window leading from the study
  to the garden. This window he leaves unfastened, so that he can get back at
  any time without a soul being any the wiser. Of course, there was always a
  chance of somebody finding the window unlatched, but that is a small
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Is the window always left open?" Bates asked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Jack replied that he thought so. Bates smiled with the air of a man who is
  perfectly well satisfied.</p>

  <p>"I am going to got up presently," he said. "After I have had a bath and
  some tea, I shall be quite fit for duty again. I want you to find some
  pretext for calling at Anstruther's just after dinner, because I may need
  your assistance."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Jack asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well, in the first place I am going to arrest Mr. Anstruther." Bates
  replied. "In the second instance, I have another little scheme, which we need
  not discuss now. I want you to go as far as Mr. Rigby's chambers and get him
  to keep an eye on Padini, and see that last night's programme is repeated, if
  possible. This is rather an important thing. I think I can trust Mr. Rigby to
  manage it."</p>

  <p>Jack went off obediently enough, and subsequently ran Rigby to earth at
  the offices of <i>The Planet</i>. The latter seemed delighted at the turn
  which affairs were taking. He began to see now that he would be able to carry
  out for his paper the series of sensational articles required by the
  proprietor.</p>

  <p>"We shall have a splendid scoop," he said. "Indeed, one might almost make
  a three-volume novel out of it. I am only too sorry that I can't be at
  Anstruther's to-night and witness the arrest. I shall leave you to supply all
  the graphic details. I can easily manage the Padini business this evening by
  writing to the fellow that I have a check to pay over and shall call at his
  rooms late tonight. I am sure to find him there. He is very hard up, and the
  money is certain to fetch him."</p>

  <p>"There are other things connected with this business." Jack said, "which
  puzzle me. For instance, there is that affair of the mysterious Mr. Ferris,
  whose acquaintance I made at the Great Metropolitan Hotel. I am quite sure
  also that Seymour has some deep design on hand. You may be absolutely certain
  that that business of the crystal ball played off on Anstruther at Lady
  Barmouth's dance the other night was not mere flummery."</p>

  <p>Rigby was of the same opinion. He was anxious to know if anything had been
  yet done in the matter of Carrington's private safe and the service of
  Cellini plate which Anstruther had coolly appropriated for himself. But on
  this point Jack had no information to offer. He did not doubt that the whole
  thing would be explained in a few hours now. He killed the day as best he
  could, and after dinner turned his steps in the direction of Panton Square.
  Mr. Anstruther and Miss Helmsley had practically finished. Serena explained,
  but they had not yet left the dining room.</p>

  <p>Anstruther raised his brows significantly as Jack entered the dining room,
  but his manner was polite and cordial enough as he invited the visitor to a
  seat and a glass of claret. He did not look in the least perturbed or put
  out; on the contrary, Jack had seldom seen him so easy and self-possessed.
  His neuralgia was quite gone. He had charmed it away as usual, he said, with
  the soothing aid of music.</p>

  <p>"How is it you never bring your violin into the drawing room?" Claire
  asked. "We hardly ever have any duets together."</p>

  <p>"After next week," Anstruther promised. "Really, I am a great deal more
  busy, than I appear to be, and I feel it quite easy to play and think at the
  same time."</p>

  <p>Jack glanced across the table significantly at Claire, and she seemed to
  divine what he was thinking about.</p>

  <p>"I thought I knew most of your music," she said, "but there was one little
  item last night that took my fancy immensely. I feel quite sure that you
  composed it yourself."</p>

  <p>Anstruther disclaimed any such gift. Fond as he was of his violin. It had
  never occurred to him to try his hand at original composition.</p>

  <p>"All the same, I really must get it," Claire persisted. "I am sorry that
  you do not recall the piece at all. If you will come into the drawing-room
  with me, and can spare a few minutes, I will strum the piece over to you. It
  so fascinated me that I committed it to memory. Do come along for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>Anstruther laughed, as Jack thought, rather uneasily. He tried skilfully
  enough to divert the conversation into another channel, but Claire's
  enthusiasm refused to be baffled. Anstruther's face darkened for a moment,
  and there was a look in his eyes that boded ill to somebody. He arose and
  walked across towards the door, and up the stairs in the direction of the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Very well, if you must," he said. "I can give you ten minutes. I dare say
  it is some silly trifle that I have heard somewhere without recognizing its
  source."</p>

  <p>Claire seated herself at the piano, and played the little piece off with
  both brilliancy and feeling. As a matter of fact, she had been practicing it
  several times during the afternoon until she had it absolutely correct. The
  slow, mournful chords died away at length, and then Claire turned to her
  guardian with a smile.</p>

  <p>"That is it." she said. "That is the little piece that so fascinated me
  last night. Surely you can tell me the name of it and where it came
  from?"</p>

  <p>The question was apparently simple enough, but Anstruther appeared to be
  absolutely incapable of answering it.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you forget a thing like that?" Claire protested. "It
  seems to me impossible."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it made less impression on me than it did you." Anstruther
  muttered. "I haven't the slightest recollection of playing it myself. In
  fact&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anstruther broke off in absolute confusion. The incident, trivial as it
  seemed, had upset him altogether. He was about to betray himself by saying
  that he had never heard the piece before, and that it had no place amongst
  his music; but he pulled himself up just in time. He bitterly blamed Padini's
  carelessness. It was no part of the programme for his double to give him
  anything but pieces of music with which he was absolutely familiar. What he
  might have said and done was frustrated by the appearance of Serena, who
  announced that a gentleman down-stairs desired to see Mr. Anstruther.</p>

  <p>Jack felt his pulses beating a little faster, for he had had no reason to
  inquire who the stranger was. Serena's eyes were demure and downcast as usual
  as she replied to Anstruther's question that the gentleman downstairs was
  none other than Inspector Bates of Scotland Yard. Only just for an instant
  did Anstruther falter and turn pale, then he was absolutely himself again. He
  almost wished now that he had not waited so long. He had his ingenious alibi,
  it was true, but even that might fall. There were so many meshes in the nets
  of Scotland Yard. In a calm, even voice he ordered Serena to show the
  stranger upstairs. Bates came at length, a little pallid and bruised, but
  otherwise little worse for his last night's adventure.</p>

  <p>"And what might be your business with me, Inspector?" Anstruther asked.
  "It is some time since I had the pleasure of meeting you. Will you take a
  seat?"</p>

  <p>"I do not see the necessity," Bates responded. "As my business is private,
  perhaps you will be good enough to follow me to your study. I will speak it
  you like, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may say anything you please," Anstruther said defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Then I arrest you on a warrant, charging you with attempted burglary last
  night," Bates said pithily. "You were on the premises belonging to the City
  and Provincial Bank with a felonious intent of breaking into a safe between
  the hours of eleven and half-past twelve. Need I say any more?"</p>

  <p>"Amazing." Anstruther laughed. "Fortunately I have my witnesses at hand to
  prove that I was not off these premises during the hours you mentioned. As a
  matter of fact. I was in my study playing my violin all the time."</p>

  <p>"Sounds ingenious," Bates muttered, "but in these days of clever
  mechanical contrivances&mdash;by the way, is not some one playing the violin
  downstairs now?"</p>

  <p>Despite his command of himself a furious curse broke from Anstruther's
  lips. For even as Bates spoke, there came sounds of liquid melody from the
  study. Not only was this so, but furthermore, the piece in question was
  precisely the same as the one that Claire had just been playing over to her
  guardian. The girl rose to her feet and looked across at Jack significantly.
  Bates smiled in the manner of one who has solved a great problem.</p>

  <p>"Really, a most remarkable coincidence," he said. "I am afraid this rather
  spoils the simple beauty of your alibi, Mr. Anstruther; unless, perhaps, you
  have some friend who entertains your household at such times as business
  calls you elsewhere. But let us go downstairs and see for ourselves."</p>

  <p>"No, no," Anstruther cried furiously. "You shall not do it. You shall not
  interfere. I'll kill you first!"</p>

  <p>"Come along," Bates responded. "Come with me and witness the solving of
  the mysterious problem.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47">XLXII &mdash; "A WOMAN SCORNED"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was plainly evident that Bates believed in his ability to
  solve the problem. Anstruther had quite thrown the mask off by this time, and
  stood glaring vindictively at the inspector. It was absolutely maddening to a
  man of his ability to be caught in a sorry trap like this. One of the
  strongest points in Anstruther's schemes was the fact that hitherto he had
  always been on the side of the police He had been regarded as one of them, so
  to speak, so that many of his ingenious plots had been guided solely by the
  action of the authorities. It had never occurred to him that he might have
  been an object of suspicion at Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"You might just as well take it quietly." Bates said. "We know the whole
  thing from start to finish. It will go a great deal easier with you if you
  give us all the information that lies in your power and save us trouble."</p>

  <p>"That is the usual course, I believe," Anstruther sneered. "But you have a
  different man to deal with in me. I am quite at a loss to understand what you
  are doing here at all."</p>

  <p>Bates shrugged his shoulders and walked in the direction of the door. He
  had no difficulty in seeing that Anstruther had made up his mind to see. this
  thing through to the bitter end. Therefore, it was quite useless to try and
  get him to see matters in a reasonable light. Anstruther stood there, white,
  silent and furious, while all the time the amazing music was going on in the
  study.</p>

  <p>Mysterious as the whole thing appeared to be, there was almost an element
  of farce in it. Here was the very man who relied upon his devotion to his
  violin to save him in the hour of danger, actually listening, so to speak, to
  his own performance. He had little doubt what Bates meant to do, for the
  latter was already half-way down the stairs on his way to the study. With a
  sudden impulse Anstruther followed. He passed Bates with a rapid stride, and,
  standing with his back to the study door, defied the Inspector to enter.</p>

  <p>"You do not seem to understand," Bates said. "The warrant I have for your
  arrest gives me the right of searching the whole house. If you persist in
  this absurd conduct I shall have to call my men in and remove you by
  force."</p>

  <p>The two men faced one another, both angry and excited, and ready to fly at
  one another's throats. And yet the whole time their ears were filled,with the
  beautiful melody of the music, as it floated from the room behind.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do?" Claire asked. She was standing with Jack at the
  top of the staircase. "Is it not time that we declared ourselves?"</p>

  <p>Jack whispered to Claire to remain where she was a moment, and slipped out
  of the house into the garden unperceived. It had suddenly occurred to him
  that perhaps the window leading from the study to the garden was unfastened.
  He recollected that this was the means by which Anstruther left and returned
  to the house. It would have been imprudent on the latter's part to use the
  front door, and there was not much risk in leaving the study window
  unlatched.</p>

  <p>It was just as Jack had expected. The long French window gave to his
  touch, and a moment later he was in the room. As it happened on the previous
  occasion, he could see not the faintest trace of any mechanism by means of
  which the melody was conveyed from the Great Metropolitan Hotel to Panton
  Square. And yet the whole room was flooded with it; rising and falling in
  triumphant strains, as if mocking the intellect of a man who had brought this
  wonderful result about. But there was no time, to speculate on that, no time
  for close Investigation. On the other side of the door the voices of
  Anstruther and Bates were rising to a still more angry pitch, and Claire's
  tones of expostulation came to Jack's ears. As he crossed the room he could
  see that the key was in the door. He flung it open, and Anstruther came
  staggering backward into the room, closely followed by the detective.</p>

  <p>"You can see that the game is up," the latter said coolly. "Why not make a
  clean breast of it? I shall find out how this is done if I have to pull down
  the house to do it."</p>

  <p>Anstruther smiled in a scornful kind of way, and flung himself doggedly
  into a seat. He bade Bates do his worst, and prophesied that the police would
  suffer for this Indignity. But Bates was not listening. He was pacing rapidly
  round the room with his ear to the wall, as if scenting out some clue to the
  mystery. A moment later and there came into the room the form of Serena.</p>

  <p>One glance at her sufficed to show that she was not the Serena whom Jack
  had known so long. The demure, downcast eyes were no longer seeking the floor
  as of old: there was no shrinking and timidity on the part of the woman now.
  She was changed almost beyond recognition. She walked with a firm, elastic
  tread, her shoulders were thrown back and her head uplifted fearlessly. From
  under his heavy brows Anstruther glanced at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Go away," he commanded hoarsely. "How dare you force yourself in here
  like this. Go, woman!"</p>

  <p>But the tones of command had evidently lost their power. There was no
  shrinking on Serena's part. She advanced into the middle of the room as if
  the place be longed to her.</p>

  <p>"No, no," she cried in tones as clear and ringing as Anstruther's own.
  "Your power has gone forever. For three long, patient years I have waited for
  this moment. God only knows what my life has been, and what a hell your
  cruelty has created for me. But the cord is broken now. Only to-night I have
  learned the truth. I have been your good and faithful servant; have stooped
  to do your hateful work; have been the ally of criminals&mdash;of your
  creature Redgrave, amongst others; and all because I thought you held my life
  in the hollow of your hand."</p>

  <p>"Tell them the story of your boy," Anstruther sneered.</p>

  <p>"I will tell them the truth," Serena cried. "You said you could hang me if
  you liked. You pretended that in my delirium I had taken the life of my
  darling child. You were shielding a murderess, as I thought. But it was a
  black and cruel lie. Give me back my wasted years, you coward; give me back
  my sleepless nights and dreary days. But, thank God, that time has passed. My
  boy is alive&mdash;alive! He is safe in the house at present!"</p>

  <p>Anstruther started as if some loathsome insect had stung him, then dropped
  sullenly back in his scat again. Bates turned to Serena and called her
  attention to the music.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be in a communicative mood to-night," he said. "You need not
  fear any one for the future&mdash;Redgrave or anybody else. I understand this
  last scoundrel is safe in the hands of the New York police, who were wanting
  him badly. Perhaps you can tell us the meaning of this extraordinary concert
  we are listening to, if you will be so good&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Serena mode no reply in words, but crossed to the side of the room
  opposite the door, and tugged at a volume which was the center of a set of
  some classical dictionary. The volume came away quite easily in her hand,
  bringing other dummy books with it; and then the interested spectators saw
  that the books in question were no more than painted gauze. In the orifice
  disclosed by the stripping away of the sham, there appeared to be something
  that resembled a mouth of a great silver trumpet. This was partly plugged
  with a set of sensitive metal plates, which were evidently intended to act as
  a diaphragm for the record of musical expression.</p>

  <p>"There you have the whole thing in a nutshell," Serena said, speaking
  quite naturally and quietly. "It is very ingenious, and yet, at the same
  time, it is not entirely original. It is an adaptation of the theaterphone,
  in connection with a somewhat modified form of telephone. The recording
  instrument is situated in my husband's rooms in the Great Metropolitan Hotel,
  and he has only to start his performance there, and the music sounds here
  quite as distinctly as if he were actually playing in this apartment. It
  seems exceedingly simple, now that you know how it is done."</p>

  <p>It did seem simple. Indeed, after listening to Serena's explanation. Bates
  turned to Anstruther and asked him if he had anything to say; but the latter
  shook his head doggedly. He felt quite sure that the game was up, though he
  had no intention whatever of giving himself away. And yet, despite his
  danger, he was still the connoisseur enjoying the beautiful music made by
  Padini's violin. But to Claire, who had crept into the room unobserved, the
  whole thing was horrible and unnatural. Such lovely music as Padini was
  playing now was but a sorry accompaniment to all this vulgar crime and
  intrigue. The girl shuddered, and placed her hands over her ears as if to
  shut out the liquid melody.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wish it would stop," she said. "I do wish it would stop."</p>

  <p>As if in answer to this prayer, the long, wailing notes died away, and the
  music fainted into nothingness. At the same time, Bates approached the mouth
  of the trumpet and blew shrilly on his police whistle. There was a pause just
  for an instant, and then, to Jack's surprise, came the voice of Rigby clear
  and distinct.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Inspector Bates?" he asked. "We have just finished at this
  end. I am afraid there will be no more music to-night, as two of your
  detectives have most inhospitably insisted upon breaking up our concert and
  escorting Signor Padini to Shannon Street police station. Shall I come round
  there, or will you come round here? Do you get my voice quite clearly?"</p>

  <p>Bates replied grimly that he did. There was no occasion whatever to
  trouble Rigby any further to-night. Then the Inspector turned to Anstruther
  and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I think there is no reason to carry this farce any farther," he said.
  "You will be good enough to consider yourself my prisoner. Would you like to
  walk to Bow Street or shall I call a cab?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther intimated that it was all the same to him. He knew perfectly
  well now that the whole thing was exploded. There was something bitter in the
  reflection that he had been found out at last and laid by the heels over so
  paltry a business as the bogus burglary at the City and Provincial Bank,</p>

  <p>"I think I'll walk." he said. "No, you need not call any of your men, and
  you need have no fear of personal violence."</p>

  <p>"All right," Bates said. "Though I am still suffering from that shaking up
  you gave me last night. Come along."</p>

  <p>"I must apologize for all this trouble," Anstruther said, turning to
  Claire, and speaking in quite his natural manner. "I must leave you to manage
  as best you can for the present. I dare say you will be able to manage with
  Serena."</p>

  <p>He turned curtly on his heel and walked to the door. Of Jack he took no
  notice whatever. A moment later the front door closed suddenly, and
  Anstruther was gone.</p>

  <p>"The house smells all the sweeter for his absence," Jack said. "My dearest
  girl, you can see now what a narrow escape you have had. I only hope, for
  your sake, that the fellow has not been tampering with your fortune. You must
  not stay, here after to-morrow. The place will be simply besieged by
  newspaper reporters and interviewers. I must find some house for,
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You need not trouble about that, Mr. Masefield," Serena said. "There is
  one house where both of us will be welcomed with open arms. Need I say that I
  am alluding to Lady Barmouth?"</p>

  <p>Jack gave a sigh of relief; for the moment he had quite forgotten Lady
  Barmouth. At any rate, for to-night Claire and Serena could stay where they
  were, and they could go to Lady Barmouth's in the morning. Then Jack
  remembered all that Serena had gone through, and warmly congratulated her
  upon the recovery of her boy</p>

  <p>"It means all the world to me," Serena cried. "It fell out exactly as Miss
  Helmsley said it would. When that man called to see Mr. Anstruther again, I
  told him who I was, and he took me to my child at once. The stranger had been
  very kind to the lad. He knew nothing of the rascality and villainy behind it
  all, and he was only too glad to see mother and son united.</p>

  <p>"And Padini?" Jack suggested. "You must not forget&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to forget everything about him," Serena cried. "I shall be glad,
  really glad, to know that that man is outside the power of doing mischief for
  the next three years. Do not ask me anything else&mdash;do not ask me, for
  instance why why I was playing the deaf-mute that night at Carrington's
  rooms. I don't know. I was a mere slave and tool in Anstruther's hands, and
  had to do exactly as he told me. It was only by the merest accident that I
  discovered how the trick of the music was done, and that I should have had to
  have kept to myself if my dear boy had not been so marvelously restored to
  me. Perhaps at some future time I may be disposed to tell you more. For the
  present, all I want to do is to sleep. I am longing for that one night's
  sweet repose which has, been so cruelly denied me the last few years."</p>

  <p>Jack said no more. He left the house presently with the intention of
  seeing Rigby at once, and then of calling on Lady Barmouth the first thing in
  morning, and making such arrangement as would conduce to the comfort Claire
  and Serena.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48">XLVIII &mdash; THE PROOF OF THE CAMERA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOCIETY generally had plenty to talk about in the way of
  scandal next morning, when it became known that Spencer Anstruther and been
  arrested in connection with the burglary of the City and Provincial Bank. The
  only paper giving anything like the account of the arrest, naturally, was
  <i>The Planet</i>, which paper vaguely hinted at further disclosures in the
  early future. Jack read the account over the breakfast table, and smiled as
  he recognized the hand of Rigby in all this. He would see Rigby presently,
  and ascertain exactly what had taken place last night at the Great
  Metropolitan Hotel. First of all, he had to see Lady Barmouth, who had
  already heard something of the news. She listened with vivid interest to all
  that Jack had to say, then announced her intention of going to Panton Square
  once.</p>

  <p>"I shall bring my sister and Claire here," she said. "They shall stay as
  long as they please. As to my sister and her boy, I shall be delighted to
  have them. I presume there will be some sort of proceedings against
  Anstruther this morning."</p>

  <p>To the great disappointment of the public, when Anstruther came to be
  charged at Bow Street the evidence was purely formal. The prisoner had
  elected not to be represented by a lawyer, and, with a view of expediting the
  proceedings, had formally pleaded guilty to the charge, and asked to be
  committed to the Central Criminal Court, which took place a week from
  now.</p>

  <p>"Clever chap that," Bates said, as he and Rigby, together with Jack,
  turned into Covent Garden. "Pretty cool, too. He wants to save time, of
  course, and get the thing over before we can complete our chain of evidence!
  But I fancy that by the end of n week we shall be able to produce all the
  witnesses we want."</p>

  <p>"I expect so," Rigby said. "By the way, don't forget about that service of
  plate. Seymour says it ought to be conveyed to Scotland Yard and the
  photographs taken at once. I have a letter from Seymour in my pocket in which
  he asks me to go round and see Sir Frederick Ormond, induce that gentleman to
  take the sealed crystal ball to your headquarters, and to see that the seal
  is not broken except in the presence of one of your leading officials. Then
  you can get both sets of photographs done at once."</p>

  <p>Bates had his hands full for the next few hours. Then, towards four
  o'clock. he made his way to Carrington's flat.</p>

  <p>Under plea of indisposition, the latter had not been out for a day or so;
  but, as a matter of fact, Bates had given him a pretty broad hint to keep
  clear of the bank premises, and to consider himself more or less as a
  prisoner on parole. Carrington's knees knocked together, and his face turned
  deadly pale as Bates came into the room.</p>

  <p>"So you have come again," he stammered. "I hope, perhaps, that&mdash;don't
  say I'm your prisoner."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that's what it comes to," Bates said. "We can't let you off
  altogether, you know. But you help us, and give us all the information in
  your power, and I'll do my best to get you off as lightly as possible. It
  makes all the difference between two years' imprisonment and seven years'
  penal servitude."</p>

  <p>"Am I to come with you now?" Carrington managed to stammer out. "Is there
  no such thing as bail?"</p>

  <p>Bates shook his head. Carrington would have to spend the night, and
  doubtless a good many succeeding nights, on the police cells; but, first of
  all, they were going as far as the bank. Bates explained that there was no
  reason, for the present, why Carrington should stand confessed as a prisoner.
  The bank officials need know nothing whatever about it. What Carrington had
  to do now was to hand over the service of Cellini plate at present locked up
  in his private safe. The detective gave his promise that the plate in
  question should be restored to its proper owner in due course, though he
  refused to gratify Carrington's curiosity as to why he had specially selected
  this particular art treasure.</p>

  <p>An hour later the Cellini plate was safe in Bow Street, together with the
  crystal globe; and before the week was out both articles had undergone some
  mysterious process of photography, not altogether unconnected with sheets of
  glass. Meanwhile, Anstruther was preparing his defense as best he could, and
  Carrington had been twice remanded on a charge of fraudulently dealing with
  the property of his clients. The two cases excited the greatest interest, and
  on the following Monday morning the Central Criminal Court was packed with
  society people eager to hear the charges against Spencer Anstruther.</p>

  <p>Anstruther stood there, quite calm and collected, with just the touch of a
  cynical smile on his lips. He looked round the court as if in search of
  acquaintances, but no one responded. Many people whom he knew quite well
  affected to look over his head. But cool and deliberate as he was, Anstruther
  had all his work cut out to keep his feelings in control when the barrister
  who represented the Crown proceeded to call witnesses. The name of Seymour
  resounded down the corridor, and a tall man with his face muffled up and a
  slouch hat on his head stepped into the box. He bowed gravely to the judge,
  and apologised for wearing his hat. A moment later his hat and coat slipped
  away, and he turned his face half defiantly to the light. There was an
  instant's breathless pause, then a veritable shout of astonishment, as the
  Nostalgo of the posters stood face to face with those whose curiosity had
  been so deeply touched during the past four months.</p>

  <p>"My name is Seymour," he said quietly, as if quite unconscious of the
  tremendous sensation his appearance had excited. "I have known the prisoner
  for some years. Before I unfortunately made his acquaintance, I was not the
  human wreck you see now, but a man like my fellows. But I need not go into
  that. What I propose to do now is to tell the story of the burglary at the
  City and Provincial Bank.</p>

  <p>"Previous to my visit to Mexico, I occupied with Mr. Carrington the rooms
  which are now his; I have in my pocket a latch-key which opens the front
  door. It matters little now why I wanted to make a search of Mr. Carrington's
  rooms, but I did make that search, and I was hidden in the conservatory
  behind the smoking-room with Mr. John Masefield on the night that the
  prisoner and Carrington planned the sham burglary at the bank. The whole
  scheme was revealed to us, and I shall be prepared to tell the jury presently
  what steps I took to see the so-called burglary carried out. It is sufficient
  for the present to say that it was carried out, and that I witnessed the
  whole proceedings in the company of Mr. Masefield and a journalist on the
  staff of <i>The Planet</i>, Mr. Rigby by name.</p>

  <p>"I should like, at this point, to call the attention of the jury to what
  we saw when the bank strong room was forced. So far as valuables are
  concerned, the safe was practically empty, save for a service of Cellini
  silver plate. Other witnesses beside myself will tell you that the prisoner
  claimed that plate as a reward for the ingenious way in which he had plotted
  to preserve Carrington's reputation. When I heard this, a sudden inspiration
  came to me. With a piece of greasy rag I hastily smeared the surface of the
  set of plate. I will come to my reason for doing that presently. When the
  whole affair had been finished, the prisoner was half minded to take the
  service of plate back with him at once to his house in Panton Square. But
  Carrington dissuaded him from this on the grounds of prudence. Therefore the
  prisoner carried the plate upstairs and deposited it in Carrington's private
  safe. There it remained for a day or two, pending some way of conveying it to
  Panton Square.</p>

  <p>"But in the meanwhile something happened which aroused the prisoner's
  suspicion. He made up his mind that he would himself remove the plate from
  Carrington's safe by means of another burglary. Carrington refused to have
  anything to do with this, but the prisoner got his own way by the simple
  expedient of stealing Carrington's keys. The prisoner is more or less
  intimately acquainted with some of the cleverest thieves and housebreakers in
  London. There was no time to call in an honest expert to open Carrington's
  safe, but the prisoner was equal to the occasion. He called upon a well-known
  housebreaker who passes by the name of 'Simple Charlie.' I know this, because
  for some time I have been watching the man in the dock. I have my own reasons
  for keeping quiet and living in an out-of-the-way place, and I have a set of
  rooms fitted up in what is, more or less a common lodging house.</p>

  <p>"By good fortune the man known as 'Simple Charlie' had rooms in the same
  block of buildings. When the prisoner called upon him the housebreaker was
  out, so that a note was left for him. This note I managed to get hold of and
  read. Together with a friend of mine named Ferris, we laid a little plot for
  'Simple Charlie.' We compelled him to find a substitute who would operate
  upon the safe, and that substitute was no other than Inspector Bates, as
  doubtless he will tell you later on."</p>

  <p>It must be clearly understood that Seymour did not stand in the box and
  reel off his evidence in the glib way of one who is making a speech for the
  prosecution. On the contrary, the fascinating evidence he gave was in reply
  to questions asked by representatives of the Crown, occasionally supplemented
  by a question of two from the judge.</p>

  <p>All this time Anstruther stood in the dock, his face knitted in an ugly
  frown. Despite his easy air, his confidence was fast deserting him. Any other
  man would have been crushed and broken by the deadly weight of a testimony
  like that of Seymour's. In his heart of hearts Anstruther was sick and
  frightened. Never for a moment had he dreamed of anything like this. Seymour
  stood before him without a trace of expression on his scarred, repulsive
  face. And yet every word he uttered was as another month on the long sentence
  he was already anticipating.</p>

  <p>Anstruther came out of a dream presently, and realised with a start that
  Seymour's deadly revelations were still going on. A moment later, and the
  Crown Counsel suggested that Seymour should stand down for a moment, and that
  Bates should take hid place. The detective came into the box alert and
  smiling. He told how he had impersonated the mythical Maggs, and how he had
  accompanied Anstruther to the City and Provincial Bank.</p>

  <p>"At this point I should like to ask you a few questions," said counsel for
  the Crown. "I understand that you have become become possessed of the service
  of silver plate to which the last witness has already alluded. He spoke just
  now of some device of his whereby the service of plate was smeared with
  grease as it lay on the floor of the vault, and before it was conveyed to
  Carrington's safe. Now, has this any important bearing on the case?"</p>

  <p>"I think you will find that it has an exceedingly important bearing on the
  case," Bates said. "You will remember, sir, that Mr. Seymour made a special
  request that the plate should be carefully photographed. You will remember,
  also, that the prisoner himself carried the plate to the safe and deposited
  it inside. We have had the plate carefully photographed, with a view to
  identification by means of finger marks. That is what we call a part of the
  Bertillon system. But, perhaps, I had better explain."</p>

  <p>Bates's explanation was carefully followed by an almost breathless
  audience. Batea held up a sheet of glass in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I have here," he said, "a photograph taken from a silver cigar case. It
  is the considerably enlarged impression of finger prints left on the cigar
  case by a burglar who was scared away before he could secure his booty. By
  comparison of this impression from the cigar case side by side with one of
  the other permanent prints at Scotland Yard we were enabled to identify and
  convict the thief."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the barrister said. "The Jury follows you. Is it your
  intention to prove that on the Cellini plate marks have been found
  corresponding with the lines on the prisoner's hand?"</p>

  <p>"This is preposterous," Anstruther cried. "It is nothing less than a vile
  conspiracy. I defy the police to be able to prove that the marks of my
  fingers are on the plate. And even if there was mere resemblance discovered
  it would be out of the question for the police to compare them with any
  impression of my own."</p>

  <p>"You are doing no good to your case," the judge interposed "You will have
  plenty of opportunity to ask questions later on."</p>

  <p>"With the permission of the Jury I shall prove that," Bates said. "Before
  I proceed any further, may I ask your lordship if you will have Sir Frederick
  Ormond called? Sir Frederick will recollect the night of Lady Barmouth's
  dance, when one of the guests, disguised as a magician, gave him a sealed
  packet to take care of. When the packet came to unsealed and photographed by
  our experts, we had no difficulty in discovering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A deep groan broke from Anstruther's lips. "My Heaven!" he cried. "I had
  forgotten the crystal!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49">XLIX. &mdash; PROOF POSITIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ANSTRUTHER'S denunciation of himself rang out loud and
  clear, so that it was heard to the uttermost parts of the court. Nothing
  could have condemned him more than that speaking cry; there was wanted no
  witness more damning than his white face and staring eyes. In sooth, he had
  quite forgotten the crystal globe. It all came back to him now, and he saw
  vividly and clearly the semi-comedy which had been enacted at Lady Barmouth's
  dance by himself and the so-called magician. To a man of Anstruther's
  capabilities, the idea that he had walked headlong into a trap laid for him
  was maddening. He had devised so many cunning schemes for the luring of
  others into confessions of crime, that it was all the more galling to find
  himself hoisted with his own petard.</p>

  <p>It was in vain that he strove to recover the ground he had lost. He could
  see a grim smile on the face of the judge, and even the suggestion of
  amusement in the Jury box. He seemed as if about to burst into passionate
  protest, then placed his hands upon his lips, and maintained instead a stolid
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better make a little explanation here," counsel for the
  prosecution said. "A great deal turns on the matter of this crystal ball. The
  witness Seymour has already explained to the Court the story of the Cellini
  plate up to a certain point. That story we shall substantiate presently by
  calling the witnesses Masefield and Rigby. Your lordship will understand that
  Lady Barmouth's now historic dance took place subsequent to the robbery at
  the City and Provincial Bank. The witness Seymour has already told you that
  he overheard the whole conspiracy between the prisoner and Carrington, by
  means of which the public would have been deluded into believing that a great
  robbery had taken place. The witness Seymour has also informed you that he
  had meant to be present when this bogus burglary took place&mdash;an event
  that subsequently happened. It was only when the Cellini plate lay outside
  the bank strong room that the most ingenious idea occurred to Seymour.</p>

  <p>"He has told us how, by means of a greasy rag, he smeared over the service
  of plate, which was subsequently placed by Anstruther's own hand in
  Carrington's safe. Beyond all question, the imprints of Anstruther's fingers
  must have remained on the plate; indeed, we shall prove this beyond question
  before long. By way of making the thing absolutely certain, it was necessary
  to get a proper impression of Anstruther's hands. Hence the comedy of the
  magician&mdash;a little comedy which shall be explained later&mdash;which
  character was quite easily carried out at a fancy dance like Lady Barmouth's.
  I am aware, my lord, that my proceeding is a little irregular, but I want to
  clear the thing up as I go along. If the prisoner has any objection, I will,
  of course, conduct my case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The prisoner has no objection whatever," Anstruther growled. "I say the
  whole thing is a conspiracy, and a rascally one at that."</p>

  <p>"The proceedings are somewhat irregular," the judge interposed, "but
  seeing that the prisoner declines to be legally represented&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anstruther shrugged his shoulders, and the prosecuting counsel went on. He
  had little more to say on the present head. He now proposed to call Sir
  Frederick Ormond.</p>

  <p>The popular young statesman stepped into the witness box with a jaunty air
  and a smile which suggested amusement; in fact, he seemed to regard the whole
  thing in the light of a very good joke.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Sir Frederick," the Crown lawyer went on, "to tell us exactly
  what happened in regard to this magician business at Lady Barmouth's house
  the other night."</p>

  <p>"Really, there is very, little to tell you," Ormond smiled. "I regarded it
  as all part of the fun. I was sitting close to the table occupied by the
  prisoner and the mysterious magician; in fact, I regarded the whole thing as
  a pure piece of comedy got up between these gentlemen to amuse the
  guests."</p>

  <p>"You had no notion of the magician's name, then?" the lawyer asked. "You
  were not taken into the secret?"</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, no. It seemed to me to be a very clever piece of acting. I must
  confess I was just a little impressed when the crystal was placed in the box,
  after being firmly held by the prisoner for a few moments. The magician asked
  for the box to be sealed, which was done, and the thing subsequently passed
  into my possession."</p>

  <p>"8top one moment," Anstruther cried. "That box was sealed up and taken
  away by you. Nobody else touched it?"</p>

  <p>The witness explained that nobody handled the box besides himself until
  Inspector Bates fetched it away under an authority from Scotland Yard. Sir
  Frederick went on to explain that he had been present when the seal of the
  box was broken.</p>

  <p>"Nobody could tamper with it during the time you had it, I suppose?"
  Anstruther asked. "You kept it under lock and key?"</p>

  <p>"The whole time," the witness cried. "You must understand that I am quite
  used to keeping valuable documents and that kind of thing. I took that box
  straight home, and locked it securely away in a drawer in my safe, where it
  remained until the police fetched it."</p>

  <p>Asked if he had any further questions to put, Anstruther sullenly
  declined. He still harped upon the string that this was a criminal conspiracy
  got up against him by the police, and insinuated that, the mysterious
  magician was nothing else than a detective smuggled into Lady Barmouth's
  house for the purpose of trapping him.</p>

  <p>"I think it would be as well, my lord, to sweep away this impression at
  once," the Crown Counsel exclaimed. "I propose to put the magician in the box
  without delay."</p>

  <p>Anstruther stared open-mouthed as Seymour once more came forward. The
  prisoner's quick intellect saw the whole scheme quite clearly now. Pressed as
  he was, and in danger as he was, he had just a touch of a grim smile of
  approval; it was a trap entirely after his own heart. Yet his eyes held a
  menace when they met those of Seymour. The latter returned the gaze. There
  was a merciless gleam in his own eyes as he faced the Jury box.</p>

  <p>"Here we have the mysterious magician," the Crown Counsel explained.
  "Perhaps you will tell us how you came to think of this thing. A mere outline
  will do."</p>

  <p>"It came to me when I was watching those men in the vaults of the bank,"
  Seymour explained in his deep, ringing voice. "I am very much interested in
  crime and criminals, and more than interested in that prisoner at the bar. I
  cannot forgot&mdash;I shall never forget&mdash;the fact that, but for him, I
  should be as other men. To be revenged on him, and to expose one of the
  greatest scoundrels the world has over seen, I came back to England. I found
  the prisoner a popular figure in society I discovered that my task would be
  no easy one. I had, moreover, to be careful&mdash;my face is one that is not
  easy to disguise. From the very first good fortune was on my side. I made one
  discovery after another&mdash;all tending to the discredit of the prisoner at
  the bar. I have already explained to the court how I became in a position to
  overhear the conspiracy that led to the robbery of the bank. Other witnesses
  will tell you in greater detail what happened that night at the bank. It was
  only when I heard the prisoner coolly arranging to appropriate that
  magnificent service of plate that my idea occurred to me. I was going to
  prove that the plate had been through Anstruther's hands. Of course, I am
  quite familiar with the Bertillon system, and here was a chance of putting it
  into practice. I hastily smeared the silver with grease, in order that the
  marks should be all the more distinct."</p>

  <p>"What does all this acting lead to?" Anstruther cried.</p>

  <p>"I am just coming to that," Seymour said quietly. "I knew that when the
  plates came to be photographed by the police, the finger prints would show
  quite clearly on the glass slide. It is necessary to have a corresponding set
  of prints, hence my idea of the magician and the crystal ball. As a matter of
  fact, Lord. Barmouth is a great friend of mine; indeed, we have suffered a
  lot at the hands of the prisoner. It was, therefore, not difficult for me to
  secure an invitation to Lady Barmouth's dance, which I attended in the dress
  of a magician. I was the magician. I arranged the plan myself, and I obtained
  the impression of those finger tips, which will show presently, when they are
  compared with those taken from the set of Cellini plate. I have nothing more
  to say for the present."</p>

  <p>Anstruther intimated that he had no questions to ask the witness, he had
  come into court prepared to take advantage of anything in his favor, trusting
  to his intelligence and audacity to pull him through. But not for a moment
  had he guessed how strong a case the police had piled up against him. Not
  that he gave the police any credit for the business at all. He could see
  quite clearly that they would have done nothing without the aid of Seymour.
  Had the latter not taken in hand the matter, the police would never have
  discovered his connection with the bogus burglary; and, however much
  Carrington might subsequently have suffered, the main rogue in the play would
  have gone off scot free.</p>

  <p>It was a dramatic story that Seymour had told the court, and every word
  that he had said was followed with the most rapt attention. The sensation of
  seeing Nostalgo in the flesh would have been enough for most people, but when
  one of the most mysterious personages that had ever excited the attention of
  London stood up like this, the central figure of a great crime, the
  excitement was- multiplied a hundredfold.</p>

  <p>There was a pause here, and the lawyer of the Crown looked significantly
  at Bates. The latter arose, and produced a cardboard box and something that
  looked like an exaggerated camera. There was a breathless pause, for
  everybody was on the tip-toe of expectation. Even the judge leaned forward
  eagerly, wondering what was going to happen next.</p>

  <p>"We are going to prove the identification of the finger marks," the lawyer
  explained. "For this purpose we shall have to darken the court, to throw the
  photographs on a large sheet which has been pinned to the wall at the back of
  the building. I trust your Lordship will have no objection to this
  course."</p>

  <p>The judge was understood to say that he objected to nothing calculated to
  further the ends of justice. The fashionable audience thrilled. Society
  settled down to the knowledge that it was going to have a new sensation.
  Ladies ceased the rustling of their fans, and the whispering and giggling
  stopped, for here was a drama far more realistic and terrible than anything
  ever seen upon the stage. A man's future literally hung upon the fair white
  cloth suspended from the wall at the end of the court.</p>

  <p>The lights went out one by one until there was nothing left but the pallid
  flame of the lantern lamp, which faintly picked out the eager eyes and parted
  lips of the excited spectators. Then the lamp vanished, and almost
  immediately a brilliant disc of light was thrown on the white sheet. In the
  long lane of flame the little motes of dust and fluff flickered. Here and
  there, as a hand or an arm went up from those at the back of the lantern,
  ghostly accusing shadows seemed to flit. Out of the darkness the voice of the
  Crown Counsel came with a startling suddenness.</p>

  <p>"In the first instance," he said, "we propose to throw on the screen the
  magnified photograph of certain finger impressions taken from the Cellini
  plate. These photographs were made at Scotland Yard and developed by the
  expert who is now assisting us in this matter. Here, my Lord and gentlemen of
  the jury, is the first of the magnified photographs."</p>

  <p>The great white shining disc disappeared as if by magic for a moment, and
  then upon it there stood out a wonderful reproduction of the right and left
  palms and finger tips of a human hand. Magnified so largely, every line and
  scar and little filament could be seen. It was as if some painstaking
  engraver had worked up the whole thing under a powerful microscope.</p>

  <p>"There we have the impression of the prisoner's hands as taken from the
  Cellini plate," the lawyer went on. "If we are wrong it is for the prisoner
  to prove it. But to make matters absolutely certain, the next plate will show
  the same finger prints as taken from the crystal ball. We know from the
  highest authority that the crystal ball was last in the hands of the
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>The photograph vanished, the great white disc shone out again, and once
  more it was obscured by an almost precisely similar photograph. It would have
  been on expert, indeed, who could have found out any dissimilarity between
  the two pictures.</p>

  <p>"And now, to make matters doubly sure," the lawyer said, "we propose to
  reproduce the two photographs superimposed one on the top of the other."</p>

  <p>Another exciting moment followed, a pause of almost painful interest; and
  then he two slides were placed in the lantern at once. They stood out on the
  sheet, just a shade misty and indistinct, like a badly printed picture, but
  the veriest novice there could see at once for himself that, they were the
  same hands. As suddenly as it had vanished the lights flashed up again, and
  every eye was turned upon Anstruther's white and rigid face.</p>

  <p>"My Lord," he said in a hoarse, strained voice, "with your permission, I
  should like it adjourned until to-morrow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50">L &mdash; ON THE BRINK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was quite evident that the strong man was breaking down
  under the strain of these damning proofs. He would, apparently, have said
  more if he could, but his lips were dry, and the back of his throat appeared
  to have turned to ashes. With a shaking hand he lifted the glass of water
  which had been placed on a little ledge before him, and drank it down
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"What object do you expect to gain by this course?" the judge asked. "If
  you have any witnesses to call&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Anstruther intimated that he had. The eager audience appeared to be
  disappointed. It was as if they had just witnessed the first act of a
  powerful drama which had ended abruptly owing to some unforeseen
  circumstance. Still, the prisoner was likely to have his own way over this,
  seeing that he was undefended by counsel; indeed, it was only fair that no
  obstacle should he put in his way.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," the judge said briefly. "The case is adjourned till 10
  o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the court was deserted, and another judge was listening
  to some prosaic case of no importance whatever. 8eymour had made his way
  rapidly out of court, followed by a curious crowd. He was quite calm and
  collected, though he had taken the precaution to hide his features as much as
  possible. Jack and Rigby caught him just at the moment that he was entering
  his cab.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to?" the latter said. "I have got a thousand
  questions to ask you. Don't run away like this."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't going anywhere in particular," Seymour explained. "I have
  nothing to do but to kill time. It seems to me that I have very little more
  to do in the way of ridding the world of Spencer Anstruther. Call it
  unchristian if you like, but there is a feeling deep in my heart that I shall
  be able to rest in future without the wild desire of always being at that
  fellow's throat. I don't think they will want me to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose Anstruther is up to?" Jack asked.</p>

  <p>"Suicide," said Seymour curtly. "I know that man far better than either of
  you. And if this verdict goes against him to-morrow&mdash;as assuredly it
  will&mdash;he will find some way of putting an end to his life."</p>

  <p>Jack looked significantly at Rigby, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"Come round to my rooms," he suggested, "and let us talk this matter over.
  And now that you have once appeared in public, and now that you have once
  told part of your story in the witness box, you might, at least, disclose the
  rest of it to two sympathetic friends like ourselves."</p>

  <p>Just for a moment Seymour seemed to hesitate.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "If you don't get it from me you will from Lord
  Barmouth. If it had not been for Ferris and your discovery of him at the
  Great Metropolitan Hotel, nothing would have induced me to say a word. But I
  have more than a hope now that before long I shall stand before the world a
  changed man and be able to take my place amongst my fellow creatures without
  being the subject of vulgar and idle curiosity. I will tell you everything
  when we get as far as your rooms."</p>

  <p>It was over a whisky and soda and a cigar that Seymour proceeded to tell
  his story. Both Jack and Rigby had heard the best part of it before. They
  knew all about the Mexican tribe and the dangers of the gold belt, but the
  cream of the mystery to them was the way in which a man of ordinary
  appearance could be transformed into so repulsive an object.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing," said Seymour as he approached the most fascinating part
  of his narrative," was the way in which those people revenged themselves upon
  outsiders who had the temerity to invade the region of the gold belt. Mind
  you, they were a powerful tribe, and in some remote age or other had
  evidently been highly civilised. At the time Ferris and Barmouth and myself
  had the misfortune to find ourselves prisoners in their hands, they were
  absolutely eaten up with priest-craft. As I think I told you before, the most
  powerful man in the tribe was not a native at all, but an Englishman. You
  will not be surprised to hear that the Englishman's name was Anstruther. I
  did not know then as I know now what that man had gone through to learn the
  secret of where the great masses of gold were hidden. Interrupting my
  narrative for a moment&mdash;have either of you ever noticed a faint
  resemblance between Anstruther and any other Nostalgo like myself?"</p>

  <p>"I have," Jack cried. "Especially in moments of passion."</p>

  <p>"That I can quite easily understand," Seymour went on. "When Anstruther
  first fell into the hands of of those people he was served in exactly the
  same way as I was served myself; in other words, one of those diabolically
  clever surgeons in the tribe turned him into a Nostalgo. Don't ask me how it
  is done; don't ask me to explain how the muscles are cut and knotted and
  twisted so as to give one the hideous deformity of face which is my curse at
  present. But Anstruther carried the same intolerable burden in his day. Why
  he was retained amongst the tribe: why he was not sent out into the world as
  an example to others, is not for me to say. Perhaps he made himself useful,
  for he is a clever man. Perhaps they had need of his services. At any rate,
  the devilish surgeon who could make a man look like a hideous demon fully
  understood the art of restoring a face to its normal aspect."</p>

  <p>"But Ferris has discovered a surgeon who can do that," Jack explained. "He
  has already told us so."</p>

  <p>"It is on Ferris' little Frenchman that I mainly rely," Seymour said.
  "Otherwise, I should fade out of this business, and you would see me no
  more."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I cannot understand," Rigby put in. "Why did
  Anstruther cause all those posters to be placed on the principal hoardings in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"Because Ferris had escaped him," Seymour explained. "You see, he wanted
  Ferris, very badly. He could blackmail him, and he hoped to go on doing so
  with impunity. But Ferris gave his tormentor the slip, and placed himself in
  the hands of that clever French surgeon. Once the cure was complete, Ferris
  could have passed Anstruther in the street without the least fear of being
  recognized. He had only to change his name, and the thing was done."</p>

  <p>"But I don't quite understand yet," Jack said.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, Ferris is a very sensitive man, and cursed with a lively
  imagination. That was where Anstruther's wonderful intellect came in. He had
  lost his man, and was determined to find him once more. Hence those accusing
  posters that were destined to meet Ferris' eye at every turn, and so play
  upon his nerves that he would be glad to give himself up. and make the best
  terms he could. It was just the sort of scheme to appeal to Anstruther, and I
  am quite sure that if Ferris had not met his friend the surgeon, the plan
  would have been brilliantly successful. And now, if you don't mind, I should
  like to go as far as the Great Metropolitan Hotel and talk this matter over
  with Ferris. I am not in the least likely to be called to-morrow; indeed, it
  seems to me that I have finished my task so far as Anstruther is concerned.
  This being so, the sooner I place myself in the hands of the French surgeon
  the better. My word! If you men could only understand the life I have led the
  past three years!"</p>

  <p>Seymour turned away and hid his face for a moment. The other two could
  respect and understand his feelings, for a long pause followed. When Seymour
  paused again, he was more calm and collected. He pitched his cigar into the
  fireplace, and suggested calling a cab and going off to the Great
  Metropolitan Hotel at once.</p>

  <p>Ferris appeared only too glad to see them; indeed, he was much better and
  more cheerful than he had been a night or two ago, when Fate had so strangely
  brought Jack and himself together. Most of the plaster had been removed from
  his face by this time, and, so far as his visitors could see, there were only
  the faintest traces that the knife had been used to remove the terrible brand
  of the Nostalgo scourge.</p>

  <p>"I expect to be out in two or three days" Ferris explained. "I shall walk
  the streets with all the more pleasure now that I know there is no chance of
  meeting Anstruther. I have just been reading an account of the trial in one
  of the evening papers."</p>

  <p>Seymour grasped his old comrade's hand and drew him eagerly to the light.
  It was brilliant sunshine outside, so that the face of Ferris was picked out
  clearly. Despite his assumed calmness, there was trembling anxiety in
  Seymour's eyes. Long and earnestly did he gaze at the pale features of his
  friend.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he muttered. "Yes, I can hope at last. What a wonderful operator
  your surgeon must be. So far as I can see, you have no marks whatever, except
  here and there some star-shaped scars, which will vanish in the course of a
  few days."</p>

  <p>"They will be gone altogether at the end of a week," Ferris said. "At
  least, so my doctor says."</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" Seymour cried. "Why, I myself have tried specialists in nearly
  every capital in Europe. Every one of them was utterly ignorant of how the
  thing had been brought about, and not a single operator of the lot could give
  me the faintest hope of my ever being any better; and yet here you find a
  comparatively unknown man who places his finger on the right spot at once!
  How did he manage it?"</p>

  <p>"That is quite easily explained," Ferris said. You will not be surprised
  to hear that this Dr. Benin has led a life of adventure. He was traveling in
  Mexico four years ago and accidentally came in contact with the same tribe
  that has cost us both so dear."</p>

  <p>"Ah," exclaimed Seymour. "Now I begin to understand. Like the rest of us
  Dr. Benin was after the gold. I presume he came under the ban of the tribe,
  who made a Nostalgo out of him. and turned him out as hideous as the rest of
  us."</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it exactly," Ferris said gravely. "For over a year Benin
  was experimenting on the muscles of the face. He discovered, at length, that
  certain of these muscles had been drawn up by some ingenious process, and
  partially paralyzed. This it was that gave the face of every Nostalgo his
  peculiar hideous appearance. Benin discovered, at length, a means by which
  the temporary paralysis of the muscles could be removed, and a man's normal
  expression restored to him. You know what I was at one time&mdash;look at me
  now! I tell you that in a month front now you can be absolutely restored to
  the world, without people shuddering and turning away as they pass in the
  street. The same remark applies to Lord Barmouth. Once Anstruther is out of
  the way, we shall come back to our own again, and know the meaning, of
  happiness once more."</p>

  <p>"I think that Barmouth ought to know this," Jack said. "I have already
  told him about Mr. Ferris, and he is anxious for a meeting to be arranged.
  But I must go off now, and inform him how successful the operation has
  been."</p>

  <p>Jack found Barmouth pacing up and down the study in no enviable frame of
  mind. On inquiry, it turned out that Anstruther had sent Barmouth a summons
  to appear at the trial the following morning and give evidence on his
  behalf.</p>

  <p>"Of course, this la a mere act of simple spite," he said. "He merely wants
  to expose me to the gaze of the world, and thus spoil the rest of my
  miserable life for me; but I shall go. I have quite made up my mind to that.
  At the same time, Anstruther will not realise his purpose. I shall take the
  precaution to practically hide my face with strips of sticking plaster, and
  let it be understood that I am suffering from the result of an accident."</p>

  <p>Jack proceeded to turn the conversation in the direction of Dr. Benin. He
  could not complain that he lacked an interested listener. Barmouth would see
  Benin without delay; indeed, he would call upon him after he had given
  evidence at the trial to-morrow. There would be no difficulty about this.
  Jack said, for Benin was pretty sure to attend the hearing in person.</p>

  <p>Jack's prophecy was borne out next morning by the appearance of Benin in
  the well of the court. The first witness called was Barmouth, who, true to
  his promise, had disguised himself almost beyond recognition. As he stepped
  into the witness box. Anstruther turned upon him savagely from the dock, and
  then the face of the latter, with the light upon it. was plainly visible to
  the little French doctor. Heedless of his surroundings, heedless of the
  solemnity of the occasion, the Frenchman jumped to his feet, and pointed a
  shaking finger in Anstruther's direction.</p>

  <p>"Murder! Murder!" he cried. "Dog, is it you?"</p>

  <p>Anstruther paused, and threw up his hands like a man who is shot. He fell
  back, a collapsed heap, on the floor of the dock. A warder rushed forward and
  raised the prostrate figure.</p>

  <p>"I think he is dead, my lord, he said simply."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51">LI. &mdash; AGAINST THE WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ANSTRUTHER lay there to all appearances quite dead. So swift
  and dramatic had the whole thing been, that nobody moved for a moment;
  indeed, a greater portion of the excited audience did not seem to grasp what
  had happened. Rigby turned and looked at Benin, who was frowning in the
  direction of the dock, and breathing hard as if he had run fast and far. Then
  one of the warders in the court moved to the assistance of his colleague, and
  between them they raised the prisoner so that his haggard face appeared over
  the edge of the rail. With an assumption of indifference the Frenchman
  dropped back into his seat again.</p>

  <p>"Surely he is not afraid of you," Jack whispered. "And yet I feel quite
  certain that your appearance frightened him terribly."</p>

  <p>"He has good need to be afraid of me," Benin growled. "I could hang that
  man&mdash; I could prove him guilty of murder. For, look, the man and myself
  have met in Paris. You have little notion of the extent of his crime. But he
  is not dead&mdash;men of that type do not die so easily. See, he is opening
  his eyes again."</p>

  <p>Anstruther had struggled into an upright position, and was feebly gasping
  for water. He gave one half-frightened glance in the direction of the
  Frenchman, who shrugged his shoulders, as if to say the whole affair was no
  business of his.</p>

  <p>"I shall not betray him," he whispered to Rigby. "It is a painful case
  which will be no better for being dragged into the light of day. Besides, the
  man will be punished enough; a long term of imprisonment will be worse to him
  than hanging. He understands, now, that I am not going to betray him."</p>

  <p>Anstruther was himself again at last. He stood rigid and erect; there was
  the faint suggestion of a smile upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Merely a passing weakness," he murmured. "I have to apologize to the
  court for the trouble I am giving. May I be allowed to make a statement?"</p>

  <p>"It would have been far better if the statement had come through your
  counsel," the judge said. "I warned you from the first that you were
  imperiling your position by refusing to accept legal aid. If the Jury find
  you guilty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Jury may find me guilty or not," Anstruther said. "I am sufficiently
  strong a man to know when I am beaten. Therefore I do not propose to waste
  the time of the court by carrying my defense any further. I have assisted the
  police on many occasions; indeed, I have been a great help in bringing a
  number of notorious criminals to justice. But I pay the prosecution this
  compliment&mdash;never once in the whole course of my career have I worked
  out anything neater than the scheme which has placed me in my present
  position. I desire to plead guilty to the whole thing. I did conspire with
  Mr. Carrington over that bank business, and with my own hands I removed the
  Cellini plate to the custody of Carrington's private safe. I am not in the
  least penitent. I am not in the least sorry for myself. In the circumstances,
  I would act precisely the same again. You may do what you like with me, and
  pass any sentence you think fit. I don't think there is any need for me to
  say more."</p>

  <p>The speaker bowed gravely to the judge and resumed his seat, which he had
  asked for as a favor. Failing any reply on the part of the Crown Attorney,
  the judge began to sum up the case. He made no comment, but curtly and drily
  sentenced the prisoner to fourteen years' penal servitude. The latter rose,
  to his feet and intimated that he was ready. With a firm step and the faint
  shadow of a cynical smile on his lips he walked down the steps and thus
  disappeared forever from the society of his fellow men. The whole thing was
  over now, and the dramatic trial was finished. It was, perhaps, a fitting
  ending to a sensational case, which had been full of surprises from beginning
  to end. In spite of it all, Jack looked grave and somewhat anxious. Now that
  the affair was over, he could find it in his heart to have a little pity for
  Anstruther.</p>

  <p>"Why so grave and silent?" Rigby asked.</p>

  <p>"I think you understand," Jack said quietly. "It always seems to me a sad
  thing to see a man of such brilliant talents in so degraded a situation.
  Anstruther might have done anything. With an intellect like his he might have
  climbed to the highest places. And yet he prefers deliberately to remain a
  criminal."</p>

  <p>"The criminal instinct must have been always there," Benin said. "There
  are some men who cannot go straight, and your brilliant Anstruther is one of
  them."</p>

  <p>The audience was pouring out of the court now, talking eagerly and
  excitedly of the events of the morning. Only a few people remained now, and,
  glancing indifferently over them, Jack noted the pale, anxious features of
  Carrington. The man lingered behind, as if afraid to face the open air. He
  shrank back shaking and despairing as Bates walked over in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, Mr. Carrington," said the latter, "but my duty is quite clear
  before me. We had our own reasons for not placing you in the dock along with
  your friend, because we might have had to call you as a witness. As I
  promised you, I will do all I can to let you down as easily as possible, but
  I hold a warrant for your arrest on the grounds of theft and conspiracy, and
  I am bound to execute it. You will be good enough to. come this way,
  please."</p>

  <p>The wretched man whined and whimpered. But there was nothing for it now
  but to follow the detective, and, so far as Carrington was concerned, the
  story is finished. By this time Jack and his companions were in the street.
  They lingered there chatting together, uncertain as to what to do next, when
  Benin proceeded to solve the problem. He suggested the advisability of his
  having an interview with Lord Barmouth without delay.</p>

  <p>"You tell me his lordship has already heard of me," he said. "After my own
  experiences, I can Imagine what his feelings have been the last few years. I
  want to see him at once, and convince him that within a month he will be free
  to stand before his fellow men, as Ferris will be within the next few
  days."</p>

  <p>Barmouth had lost no time in leaving the court directly he discovered that
  there would be no occasion for him to enter the witness-box.</p>

  <p>When Jack and the others reached Belgrave Square, Barmouth had already
  removed the strips of plaster from his face, and was walking up and down his
  study with the restless air of one whose mind is ill at ease. All the same,
  he seemed to divine the cause of Benin's presence, for he held out his hand
  and smiled gratefully.</p>

  <p>"I know you come to me in the guise of a friend, Dr. Benin," he said. "Is
  it too much to hope that you can cure me as you cured my friend Ferris?"</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about it whatever," the Frenchman said. "It is all a
  matter of an operation on the muscles of the face. You will be yourself
  again; even that horrible yellow tinge will disappear from your skin. I
  should like, if possible, to operate upon Seymour and yourself at the same
  time. I dare say you have some quiet country place that we could go to."</p>

  <p>There was more than one such retreat, as Barmouth proceeded to explain.
  They talked over the matter eagerly and earnestly for some time, until a
  message arrived that Mr. Anstruther earnestly desired an interview with Lord
  Barmouth.</p>

  <p>The latter started and shook his head. He had no disposition whatever to
  see Anstruther again. But as he thought the matter over, kindlier thoughts
  prevailed. After all, the man was past all power of mischief, and despite the
  way in which he had carried himself off, must have felt his position most
  keenly. On the whole, Barmouth decided to go.</p>

  <p>He found Anstruther pacing up and down his roomy cell. The man looked
  haggard and drawn. Well as he had himself in hand, Anstruther's twitching
  lips betrayed his emotion.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you wonder why I sent for you," he said. "You need not be
  afraid of me; they have rendered me quite harmless. They have even taken away
  my watch and chain and money. Why they left me this little pearl-headed scarf
  pin I don't know&mdash;probably they overlooked it. It is these little
  careless things which prevent the Force from being quite as efficient as it
  might be."</p>

  <p>Anstruther smiled in a peculiar way as he spoke. But Barmouth did not
  appear to notice. Anstruther walked up and down the cell, talking freely as
  he went.</p>

  <p>"It was exceedingly good of you to come," he said, "especially as I have
  done you so grievous a wrong. You will be perhaps pleased to hear that all
  the sufferings I underwent in Mexico were wasted. I never so much as laid my
  hand upon an ounce of the gold for which I risked my life; indeed, at the end
  I just contrived to save my mere existence. When I sent for you to-day it
  sincerely to ask you to pardon me for all the harm that I have done to you
  and others. I was going to tell you in any case the means by which you could
  be restored to your normal appearance. If the case went against me to-day I
  had determined to write to you and give you the address of Dr. Benin. But
  when I saw him in court to-day I knew perfectly well that you and he had
  already met, and, therefore, there was no reason for me to say anything. You
  and I have always been antagonistic; I do not bear you any ill will for
  that."</p>

  <p>"An I can assure you that there is no ill-will on my side," Barmouth
  replied. "Mind you, I cannot forget all the sufferings that I have undergone
  at at your hands. It is strange what men will do when the greed for gold is
  upon them, and how little good does it tend to when the gold comes. Only a
  few hours ago I was longing to meet you face to face under such conditions as
  would render your death a secret. I would have killed you like a dog. I
  always meant to kill you. While I was paying blackmail to you under a name
  other than my own, I was ever plotting the opportunity which would have
  betrayed you into my hands.I should have deemed it no crime to have rid the
  world of a scoundrel like yourself. And yet, as God is my witness, when I see
  you here like this, an outcast and a felon, when I think of the terrible way
  in which your great talents have been wasted, I have nothing but pity for
  your lamentable condition."</p>

  <p>Anstruther took a step forward, the veins on his forehead knotted, his
  hands clenched in a paroxysm of passion.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like that," he said hoarsely. "Don't begin to pity me, or I
  shall fly out and strangle you. If there was no chance of you ever being
  anything but what you are&mdash;I mean so far as your personal appearance la
  concerned? I would willingly change places with you at this moment. And I was
  a Nostalgo myself, and know what the punishment means. But I did not bring
  you here to talk entirely about myself. I have felt for a long time that Jack
  Masefield has viewed me with suspicion, perhaps, he thinks I am unaware of
  his engagement to Claire. Why, I knew every movement of his. He will be
  surprised to hear that I knew he was in the cupboard near Padini's room the
  time I was spying about there. What was I after? Well, Padini had certain
  papers of mine, and it was not policy to accuse him of the theft then. Just
  as if open-minded people like those could deceive me. I can quite forgive
  Masefield for his caution, but you can tell him that Claire's fortune has
  suffered nothing at my hands. Not that I wish to take any credit for that; it
  is merely that the other trustee, being a shrewd lawyer, was too clever for
  me. However, Claire has her two thousand a year intact, and she is free to
  marry Masefield when she likes.</p>

  <p>"There is another matter of which I wish to speak to you&mdash;that is, as
  regards Serena. I understand that she is Lady Barmouth's sister. Well, I am
  glad of that, because the poor woman and her boy will have a happy home in
  future. I behaved abominably to Serena; I lied to her, I tricked and
  tormented her, so that I might get her in my power, and make use of her
  wonderful talents as an actress. She believed that I held her life in the
  hollow of my hand, and therefore she was the veriest slave to my will. But
  nothing wrong, Barmouth: Serena is as good and pure as your own wife. I
  understand that Padini has been arrested owing to his having taken a hand in
  that musical Jugglery of mine.</p>

  <p>"For Serena's sake he must be got rid of. All you have to do is to drop a
  line to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Paris, and say that Monsieur
  Lemarque in masquerading in London as Padini, the violinist. After that I
  don't think Serena will be troubled with her precious husband any more. And
  now I will not detain you any longer. If you will accept this pin as a
  souvenir I shall be glad. You see it is a small pearl on a gold wire. There
  is one peculiarity about it. The pearl is hollow, and it often occurred to me
  how useful it would be to conceal a drop or two of some virulent poison
  inside in case one fell into the hands of the authorities."</p>

  <p>Filled with a sudden suspicion, Barmouth darted forward. The faint mocking
  smile of Anstruther's face told him as plainly as words could tell exactly
  what was going to happen. He reached forward and clutched Anstruther. It was
  too late.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, Anstruther," Barmouth cried. "Think: pause before you
  do anything so rash, so blasphemous."</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you," Anstruther said quite coolly. "I know you mean
  well, but this is the way I prefer myself."</p>

  <p>He placed the pearl within his lips, and crushed it with his teeth.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52">LII. &mdash; THE END OF IT ALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BARMOUTH could see a little speck of foam like a white
  feather on the lips of his companion. He saw Anstruther throw up his head and
  the apple of his throat moved as if in the act of swallowing. The whole thing
  had been so swift and unexpected, that Barmouth could not blame himself for
  what had happened. There was no occasion to tell him that the pearl had
  contained some deadly poison, for already the effect of it was apparent on
  Anstruther's features. He gasped painfully as if some terrible pain had
  gripped him by the heart, his features twitched horribly, yet he smiled with
  the air of a man who is by no means displeased with himself.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said naturally, "I think it will be just as well if you call in
  the warder who is watching us through that grating in the door, and tell him
  everything that has happened."</p>

  <p>"Barmouth lost no time in doing so. There was a greet tramping and
  commotion in the corridor outside, and presently Bates and the prison doctor
  rushed in. By this time Anstruther was seated on the only chair in the cell;
  there was a heavy bead of moisture on his face. He smiled faintly at
  Bates.</p>

  <p>"It is exactly as Lord Barmouth has said," he explained. "When your people
  deprived me of everything that I possessed they forgot to remove a tiny
  pearl-headed pin from my scarf. It was only a very small pearl&mdash;You
  could have bought the thing in any West-End shop, for a sovereign; but the
  gem was not so innocent as it appeared to be. Inside I had caused to be
  placed one spot of deadly poison no larger than a pin's head. I have had it
  there for years in case of emergency. I have always had a presentiment that
  sooner or later the end would be thus; and I am much too active-minded a man
  to dare to pass years in jail. I should have gone mad under treatment like
  that. Therefore, you see I was quite ready for you. I had only to take that
  pin from my tie, and make the tiniest puncture in the tip of my tongue, then
  all I had to do was to crush the pearl within my teeth, and the thing was
  done. There need be no inquest; the poison in question was one spot from the
  fang of a cobra. See, the end is very near."</p>

  <p>Anstruther staggered to his feet, threw his hands above his head. and
  collapsed in a heap on the floor. There was one fearful shuddering contortion
  of the muscles, and after that a rigid stillness. The prison doctor bent
  down, and examined the silent form carefully. He shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"My services here are absolutely useless," he said. "The man is dead. I
  only wonder that he lived so long. It was a sad ending to what might have
  been a brilliant career."</p>

  <p>"It was a brilliant career." Bates. muttered. "We never had a detective in
  the force as clever as Mr. Anstruther. Shall I call a cab for you, my lord?
  There is nothing for you to gain by waiting any longer."</p>

  <p>Barmouth nodded in an abstracted kind of way; he hardly appeared to hear
  what Bates was saying. In the same dreamy fashion he was driven homewards. On
  reaching Belgrave Square he found that Benin had gone off on some business,
  leaving Jack and Rigby behind him. In a few words he told the others what had
  happened. There was nothing more to be said on the matter, and no great
  feeling was expressed, seeing that Anstruther had never been anything else
  but an enemy to all of them.</p>

  <p>"He seemed desirous of making amends at the last," Barmouth said. "For
  instance, he has shown us a way whereby my wife's unfortunate sister can be
  forever free of Padini. Also he informed me that Miss Claire Helmsley's
  fortune is absolutely intact. He was cynical to the last, and suggested that
  Jack here should marry the lady of his choice without delay."</p>

  <p>"That is very good of him," Jack said dryly. "But as far as I am
  concerned, I shall not be in the least sorry to hear that Claire has nothing.
  I do not want the suggestion made that I am in any way a fortune hunter. It
  is not a pleasant idea."</p>

  <p>"What is the good of talking that nonsense," Rigby exclaimed. "My dear
  fellow, you are getting, on splendidly with your literary work, and in a year
  or so from now your income will be quite equal to Miss Helmsley's. Besides,
  nobody who knew you would think of accusing you of fortune-hunting. And so
  long as Miss Helmsley shares the opinions of your friends, I don't see that
  it in the least matters to anybody else."</p>

  <p>Lady Barmouth came into the room at the same moment with an intimation
  that Claire was up in the drawing room, and would like to see Jack as soon as
  he was at liberty. Jack went off with alacrity. There was a soothing feeling
  now that no obstacle any longer stood in his path. He had no fear of the
  future, so far as Claire was concerned, Anstruther being once out of the way.
  It was only at this moment, with the knowledge of a placid future before him,
  that Jack realized how great the mental strain had been.</p>

  <p>He found Claire waiting for him in the drawing room. She advanced with a
  smile upon her face, and he took her in his arms and kissed her, feeling at
  last that she was his own and that there was no shadow of further crime
  between them. He was just a little grave and silent, and love's quick eyes
  were there to detect the somber shade on his face.</p>

  <p>Very quietly Jack told Claire all that had happened. It was some little
  time before either spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to find that your fortune is intact, my dearest girl," Jack
  said. "I shall have to work hard now, so that when the good time comes I
  shall be able to marry you, feeling that my position is equal to your own. It
  must not be said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not going to be said," Claire replied, looking up into her lover's
  face with a winning smile. "Jack, dear, I know exactly what is running in
  that silly head of yours. I can see I shall have to be very severe with you.
  Now answer me a question, sir."</p>

  <p>"A dozen if you like," Jack replied. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, about the time we first met, and you were so foolish as to fall in
  love With me. Confess it now; did not you regard me as a poor dependent of
  Mr. Anstruther's, without so much as a penny of my own? I knew that you loved
  me long before you told me so&mdash;I felt it here at my heart. And yet when
  you asked me to be your wife, not so many weeks ago, and suggested we should
  keep the matter a secret as we were too poor to marry, you did not know then
  that I was an heiress in a small way."</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to admit it," Jack said. "But you see, my darling, it is
  pretty certain that some people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a pretty little imperious gesture Claire laid her hand on her lover's
  lips. Her eyes looked sweetly into his.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to hear another word," she cried. "Oh, what does it matter
  to anybody as long as we are satisfied. My dearest boy, do you want me go go
  down on my knees and implore you to marry me? I will do it if you like."</p>

  <p>Jack's reply was evidently suitable and to the point, for the fond look
  came over Claire's face again, and for some time they were silent. It was
  Claire who broke the silence at length.</p>

  <p>"You need me." she whispered. "We shall be none the less happy because
  that dark cloud of poverty is not likely to dim our future. I have pictured
  to myself a dear little house in the country where we could have roses and
  trim lawns and old-world gardens, and where you could work in a beautiful
  study lined with old oak and filled with blue china. I don't mind telling
  you, Jack, that I have picked out the house, and my other guardian is now
  settling the purchase of it for me. Think how nice it would be to be able to
  sit down every morning with a contented mind, and not care whether you did
  one page or twenty, so long as you feel sure that you were doing nothing but
  your best work. I always think every author ought to have a fortune of his
  own, and thus be without the necessity of turning out his work by the yard,
  so to speak."</p>

  <p>Claire might have said more, only she noted the dancing imp of mischief in
  Jack's eyes. He kissed her tenderly again.</p>

  <p>"I had no Idea I was going to have so practical a wife," Jack said. "But
  do not let us be altogether selfish; let us give a thought or two to other
  people. There is not the slightest reason why the full significance of this
  Nostalgo business should ever be made public. And no more posters will
  appear; the public will marvel for a time and ask questions, then the thing
  will be forgotten when the next great sensation comes along. I will tell
  Rigby that he is to mention no names when he tells his wonderful story in
  <i>The Planet</i>&mdash;at least he is not to mention the names of any of our
  friends. Now let us go down to the dining room and see what they have
  arranged. I am very anxious to know."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile all the arrangements had been completed by those most concerned.
  As Lord Barmouth explained, he had a very quiet country place in the
  neighborhood of Hindhead, and there the operation upon himself and Seymour
  was to take place.</p>

  <p>"I want Claire to come with me." Lady Barmouth said. "Of course, Serena
  and her boy will be with us, and I understand that arrangements are being
  made to rid us finally of the attentions of Signor Padini. The place is near
  enough to London for Mr. Masefield to run down as often as he finds it
  possible. My dear Claire, you are looking so radiantly happy that I need not
  ask you if you have settled matters with Jack."</p>

  <p>"It was not an easy task," Claire laughed and blushed; "I almost had to go
  down on my knees to him. He said he would be accused of fortune-hunting or
  something equally absurd."</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly glad to hear of it," Lady Barmouth said heartily. "I
  have set my heart upon a little programme, and I hope you will allow me to
  carry it out. I want the marriage to take place from our house at Hindhead.
  Lord Barmouth will give you away, and we'll make quite a society affair of
  it."</p>

  <p>"But not till Lord Barmouth is quite right," Claire said. "Dear Lady
  Barmouth, you are too kind to me. Let me confess that I had hoped for
  something like this, but I did not intend to marry Jack till I could have all
  my good friends there. In perhaps three months' time it may be possible that
  all this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Two months," Lord Barmouth laughed. "Both my good friend Seymour here and
  myself will be perfectly well by that time. I have thought it all out, and
  there need not be any gossip at all. It will be merely announced in the
  society papers that I have recovered from the painful malady which has so
  long afflicted me, and there will be an end of the matter. We are all going
  down to Hindhead to-morrow, and the operation takes place on Saturday.
  According to what Dr. Benin said. It is a mere matter of a fortnight in bed,
  and at the end of a month we shall be quite like other people. Now let us
  have dinner in the study without the servants. It will be quite pleasant to
  wait upon ourselves."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Very quietly and unostentatiously the little party set out for Hindhead
  the following day. Not even the servants knew what was in the wind; they
  merely gathered that Lord Barmouth was never really well, and that he was
  taking an invalid friend with him. Dr. Benin's arrival caused no sensation,
  the household staff being informed that a clever surgeon had come from Paris,
  who hoped to restore their master to a normal state of health.</p>

  <p>It was a fortnight later that Barmouth and Seymour came downstairs looking
  a little drawn and white, but otherwise exactly like two ordinary men who had
  just recovered from some commonplace illness. Serena was there with her boy,
  but not the Serena of old. Years seemed to have fallen from her shoulders,
  there was a color in her face, and a sparkle in her eyes which fairly
  astonished Jack when he saw her. He pressed her hand silently, saying no
  word, and 8erena understood him more thoroughly than if he had been gifted
  with the finest eloquence in the world.</p>

  <p>It was all ended and done with at last; the organ had pealed out its
  triumphal march, the cherry-cheeked children had cast their last handful of
  flowers at the feet of the happy bride, the wedding was over, and now the
  carriage stood at the door. Claire recollected it all clearly afterward, but
  at the moment she felt like one who dreams pleasant things. It was only when
  the prosaic banging of the railway carriage door struck upon her ears that
  she came entirely to herself again. The train was speeding through the
  peaceful landscape. Claire leaned her head tenderly on Jack's shoulder, and a
  sigh of happiness escaped her.</p>

  <p>"What is that sigh for?" Jack asked tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Peace and happiness," Claire cried. There was just a suggestion of tears
  in her eyes. "It seems so strange to be with you like this, and yet only the
  other day&mdash;but I will not think of that. We will say no more about the
  dark days, but dwell entirely with the happy hours to come."</p>

  <p>Jack bent and kissed the quivering red lips. Then a great content came
  into their hearts, and they were silent.</p>
