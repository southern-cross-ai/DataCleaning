<h2>Seedtime and Harvest<br>
by<br>
Arthur Gask</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Published in The Mail, Adelaide, S.A., Saturday 20 May, 1944.</h4>
<hr>
<p>The earth is ever a hard master, and the farm was one of that number in
Australia, not very distant from a township and yet far enough away to make
life lonely for those living in it. He had purposely come home late and night
had well fallen when his boots clattered outside the lobby door. He was a big
and rather coarse-looking man of 34.</p>
<p>Entering the kitchen he gave his wife a quick look and then turned away his
eyes. "I'm late," he remarked carelessly. "I stopped to finish a bit of
fencing." He pulled off his sodden boots. "The creek's high tonight and there's
more rain coming."</p>
<p>His wife nodded understandingly, but made no comment. She was an unusually
good-looking girl and more than 10 years her husband's junior. She had a good
profile, a faultless complexion, and big, clear dark-blue eyes.</p>
<p>There was a suggestion of hardness, however, about her otherwise very pretty
mouth. Her figure was supple and beautifully proportioned.</p>
<p>"Tea's ready," she said quietly, and they sat down to what was almost a
silent meal. They were both of reserved dispositions and it was never their
habit to talk much. They had been married six months, and he was quite aware
she had never really had any affection for him, becoming his wife only on her
parents' persuasion.</p>
<p>His farm was prosperous, and the bargain had been he would make them an
allowance on her marrying him. So, after some considerable urging, she had done
what would be best for them.</p>
<p>"You've knocked your knuckles," she said presently. "How did you come to
hurt them?"</p>
<p>"Tightening a nut on the drill," he replied. "It's nothing much, just taken
the skin off."</p>
<p>"But I must put some plaster on," she said. "They don't look nice, and you
can't work with them like that."</p>
<p>She had been a nurse before their marriage, and the contents of a small
cupboard in their bedroom provided for most emergencies.</p>
<p>The night was cold, and the meal finished and the washing-up over, they sat
before the fire. He smoked meditatively and she read. Occasionally they
exchanged a few words, but she never kept her eyes lifted very long from her
book.</p>
<p>Presently he stretched himself and yawned. "I think I'll go to bed," he
said. "The cold's made me feel sleepy," and he rose to his feet and looked at
her interrogatively. "Coming?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not yet," she replied. "I'll read a little longer."</p>
<p>He went alone into the bedroom and, to his surprise, because it was not his
usual habit to do so, found himself dropping off to sleep almost at once. Then,
to his amazement, the next thing of which he was conscious was seeing daylight
through the window and hearing his wife laying the breakfast things in the
adjoining room.</p>
<p>He had slept the whole night through without stirring. He looked at the
impression of his wife's head on the pillow beside him, and wondered how it was
she had managed to come to bed and also get up without waking him. But he was
under no illusion that her carefulness had not been of set purpose.</p>
<p>"The devil," he frowned, as he jumped hurriedly out of bed, "but I couldn't
have slept sounder if I'd been drugged."</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>SOME 40 years later the morning train pulled up at a little railway siding
300 and more miles from Sydney, and a middle-aged man in semi-clerical attire
alighted. He was slight in build, with a thin, ascetic face, and his expression
was mild and very gentle.</p>
<p>His eyes were of a peculiar light-blue forget-me-not color. His clothes were
shiny and well worn, and he carried a small leather bag, equally as shabby. By
calling he was a lay missionary, and for many years his work had lain among the
lesser known Pacific islands.</p>
<p>A big, heavy framed man, with a weather-beaten face, and clad in rough
working clothes was standing on the platform and he came forward at once.
"Hullo, Peter," he exclaimed, as he held out a large and earth-grimed hand. "I
should have recognised you anywhere."</p>
<p>"Hullo, Tom," returned the missionary, and the hand he gave was small and
delicate in contrast with that of his brother's. "How's dad?"</p>
<p>"Crook," said Tom. He grinned, "Or he wouldn't have asked for you. Doctor
says he may go any day now."</p>
<p>He led the way to a small, ramshackle dog cart with a very old pony between
the shafts, and they both mounted and settled themselves down for the six-mile
journey to the farm.</p>
<p>"How's mother?" asked the missionary, wincing at the fierce blow his brother
had given to the pony.</p>
<p>"Always grumbling. The rheumatics have got her and she works too hard. We
can't afford to pay for any help."</p>
<p>"Then, isn't the farm doing well?"</p>
<p>"No, the sand's drifted over all the best paddocks," and the big man whipped
up the pony again with an oath which made the missionary wince for the second
time.</p>
<p>The conversation languished and, as they drove along, the missionary's eyes
roved sadly over the countryside. Every hill, creek, and paddock was familiar
to him, and the memories were unhappy ones.</p>
<p>It was 20 years since he had left home, and for all that time he had not
seen his parents. The eldest born, and always frail and delicate as a boy, and
totally unfit for farm work, his father had never taken to him and, eventually,
he had left home for Sydney to train as a school teacher.</p>
<p>Of a serious disposition, however, missionary work had appealed to him; and
he had gone to the islands, living a life of hardship and privation, but with
his heart and soul in his labors.</p>
<p>Some months previously his mother had written him his father was in very
poor health, and that he must come at once if he wanted to see him before he
died. With some difficulty, he had obtained a substitute and made the long
journey with what speed he could.</p>
<p>Arriving at the farm, an old woman hobbled to the door. She was bent and
frail and with a shrivelled, yellow skin. Hardship and unceasing toil had taken
a dreadful toll of her, but it was obvious she had been anything but
ill-looking once, for her profile was good and her eyes were a beautiful dark
blue.</p>
<p>"Oh, Peter," she exclaimed querulously as the missionary bent down and
kissed her, "how old you've grown!"</p>
<p>"But 20 years, mother!" he laughed. "What else could you expect?" His face
sobered. "But how's dad?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "A sick man. His heart's failing and he may go any day
now. I expected you would come too late to see him."</p>
<p>"Oh, then I'll go straight in to him," said Peter.</p>
<p>"No, no," said his mother quickly, "he's asleep, and you mustn't wake him.
Besides, I'm just going to dish up the dinner, and your brothers can't wait.
They have their work to do."</p>
<p>Two other men tramped in noisily and shook hands heartily with the
missionary. They were almost the facsimile of the one who had met him at the
railway station, with the same red face, the same big bodies, and the same
horny, earth-grimed hands. They were merry, jovial fellows, and looked full of
life.</p>
<p>They all sat down to the meal. The missionary ate very little, but the other
brothers ate hungrily consuming everything with great gusto. They seemed, too,
in a tremendous hurry, as if they were all going to catch trains, washing down
everything quickly with cup after cup of steaming, milkless tea.</p>
<p>When they talked it was only about crops and cows who were expecting calves
and of a sow who would have to be killed because she was beginning to get short
in her litters.</p>
<p>And the whole time they were regarding their brother with amused and covert
smiles, kicking one another furtively under the table, as if he were something
of a joke to them. The meal finished, they rushed off, and Peter was taken in
to see his father, the mother leaving the two to have their talk together.</p>
<p>The old man's lips were very blue and he spoke faintly. "I wanted to see
you, Peter," he said slowly, "because I've got something on my mind and I felt
I must tell somebody." He paused a long moment. "Forty years ago I killed a
man."</p>
<p>His son's mouth gaped. "But by accident, of course, dad!" he exclaimed
quickly.</p>
<p>"No, no, on purpose," was the grim reply. "I had meant to kill him if ever I
got the chance, for he was coming after your mother, and I knew he'd get her if
I didn't.</p>
<p>"One afternoon I had a fight with him by the creek and stunned him with an
axe. Then I threw him into the creek to drown. His body was carried into the
river and never found."</p>
<p>"Oh, dad, dad, how could you?" exclaimed the missionary in great
distress.</p>
<p>"He worked in a bank," went on the old man, "and had been your mother's
sweetheart before I married her, and he used to come up here much more than I
liked, for it made her cold towards me.</p>
<p>"Then, one afternoon, when he thought I'd be away, I caught him creeping up
behind the trees in the big paddock. He tried to make out he'd come to ask me
to lend him money, as he'd been robbing the bank and was going to be found
out.</p>
<p>"That he'd robbed the bank was quite true, but it was your mother he was
after then, and we had some words and I struck him down."</p>
<p>"My God, my God," exclaimed Peter, his voice choking, "and you've been
keeping this dreadful secret for all these years!"</p>
<p>"But it hasn't worried me at all until lately," went on the old man, "and it
doesn't worry me much now. I know I did right, for he would have ruined my
home. Then, when he came no more, your mother altered towards me, and a year
after he was dead you were born."</p>
<p>He spoke bitterly. "Still, he must have been always in her memory, because
when you came I saw you had got his eyes. Yours are just the same light-blue
color as his were. Your mother never dreamed that I've noticed it, but I have,
and that's why I never took to you and was glad when you went away."</p>
<p>His voice grew fainter. "But go away now. I want to sleep. I'll have another
talk with you later," and Peter went out and prayed that his father might be
granted longer life to show true repentance for his sin.</p>
<p>That night after supper, when the old man was still sleeping and the other
brothers were in bed, his mother said to Peter, "And, of course, dad only
wanted to see you to confess that he'd killed Les Donelly."</p>
<p>Peter gasped. "Oh, mother, then did you know? Oh, what a terrible secret for
you to have had to keep to yourself!"</p>
<p>She nodded spitefully. "Fiddlesticks, there was no such secret to keep! He
didn't kill him, though for a punishment I've let him think so all these
years.</p>
<p>"I was among the trees that afternoon and saw him throw Les in the creek,
but I dragged Les out when he was swept beyond the bend, and he didn't die
until three years later, when he was killed in the Boer War."</p>
<p>"And so he wasn't drowned after all," exclaimed the missionary in great
relief.</p>
<p>The old woman laughed scoffingly. "No, not he, and I kept him hidden for
three months in that old hut which used to be among the willows. No one ever
learnt he was there, and I nursed him until he had got over the hurt your
father had given him and I had scraped enough money from the housekeeping to
give him to get safely away."</p>
<p>A wistful look came into her eyes. "He was a fine lad, but he was wanted by
the police." She nodded again. "Well, as your father's broken his silence at
last, I'll tell him everything tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, but I will, for I've never had any love for him, though he's made
me bear him those three lumping sons," and the missionary went out and prayed
now that the old man might die.</p>
<p>That night, in answer to Peter's prayer, the angel of death passed by, and
the old man died without his wife having had speech with him again. In the
morning, when the missionary was shaving, he sighed heavily, for, as he looked
in the mirror, he thought his eyes were of a lighter blue than ever.</p>
