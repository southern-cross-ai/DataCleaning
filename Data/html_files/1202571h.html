<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="pref" name="pref">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p class="first">IN two previous volumes of this work a narrative has been
given of those events which occurred upon the British Western Front during
1914, the year of recoil, and 1915, the year of equilibrium. In this volume
will be found the detailed story of 1916, the first of the years of attack and
advance.</p>
<p>Time is a great toner down of superlatives, and the episodes which seem
world-shaking in our day may, when looked upon by the placid eyes of historical
philosophers in days to come, fit more easily into the general scheme of human
experience. None the less it can be said without fear of ultimate contradiction
that nothing approaching to the Battle of the Somme, with which this volume is
mainly concerned, has ever been known in military history, and that it is
exceedingly improbable that it will ever be equalled in its length and in its
severity. It may be said to have raged with short intermissions, caused by the
breaking of the weather, from July 1 to November 14, and during this prolonged
period the picked forces of three great nations were locked in close battle.
The number of combatants from first to last was between two and three millions,
and their united casualties came to the appalling total of at least
three-quarters of a million. These are minimum figures, but they will give some
idea of the unparalleled scale of the operations.</p>
<p>With the increasing number and size of the units employed the scale of the
narrative becomes larger. It is more difficult to focus the battalion, while
the individual has almost dropped out of sight. Sins of omission are many, and
the chronicler can but plead the great difficulty of his task and regret that
his limited knowledge may occasionally cause disappointment.</p>
<p>The author should explain that this volume has had to pass through three
lines of censors, suffering heavily in the process. It has come out with the
loss of all personal names save those of casualties or of high Generals. Some
passages also have been excised. On the other hand it is the first which has
been permitted to reveal the exact identity of the units engaged. The missing
passages and names will be restored when the days of peace return.</p>

Division&mdash;Fight at Vimy Ridge&mdash;Canadian Battle of Ypres &mdash; Death

<p class="first">THE Great War had now come into its second winter&mdash;a
winter which was marked by an absolute cessation of all serious fighting upon
the Western front. Enormous armies were facing each other, but until the German
attack upon the French lines of Verdun at the end of February, the infantry of
neither side was seriously engaged. There were many raids and skirmishes, with
sudden midnight invasions of hostile trenches and rapid returns with booty or
prisoners. Both sides indulged in such tactics upon the British front. Gas
attacks, too, were occasionally attempted, some on a large scale and with
considerable result. The condition of the troops, though it could not fail to
be trying, was not so utterly miserable as during the first cold season in the
trenches. The British had ceased to be a mere fighting fringe with nothing
behind it. The troops were numerous and eager, so that reliefs were frequent.
All sorts of devices were adopted for increasing the comfort and conserving the
health of the men. Steadily, as the winter advanced and the spring ripened into
summer, fresh divisions were passed over the narrow seas, and the shell-piles
at the bases marked the increased energy and output of the workers in the
factories. The early summer found everything ready for a renewed attempt upon
the German line.</p>
<p>The winter of 1915-16 saw the affairs of the Allies in a condition which
could not be called satisfactory, and which would have been intolerable had
there not been evident promise of an amendment in the near future. The weakness
of the Russians in munitions had caused their gallant but half-armed armies to
be driven back until the whole of Poland had fallen into the hands of the
Germanic Powers, who had also reconquered Galicia and Bukovina. The British
attempt upon Gallipoli, boldly conceived and gallantly urged, but wanting in
the essential quality of surprise, had failed with heavy losses, and the army
had to be withdrawn. Serbia and Montenegro had both been overrun and occupied,
while the efficient Bulgarian army had ranged itself with our enemies. The
Mesopotamian Expedition had been held up by the Turks, and the brave Townshend,
with his depleted division, was hemmed in at Kut, where, after a siege of five
months, he was eventually compelled, upon April 26, to lay down his arms,
together with 9000 troops, chiefly Indian. When one remembers that on the top
of this Germany already held Belgium and a considerable slice of the north of
France, which included all the iron and coal producing centres, it must be
admitted that the Berlin Press had some reason upon its side when it insisted
that it had already won the War upon paper. To realise that paper, was,
however, an operation which was beyond their powers.</p>
<p>What could the Allies put against these formidable successes? There was the
Colonial Empire of Germany. Only one colony, the largest and most powerful,
still remained. This was East Africa. General Smuts, a worthy colleague of the
noble Botha, had undertaken its reduction, and by the summer the end was in
sight. The capture of the colonies would then be complete. The oceans of the
world were another asset of the Allies, These also were completely held, to the
absolute destruction of all German oversea commerce. These two conquests, and
the power of blockade which steadily grew more stringent, were all that the
Allies could throw into the other scale, save for the small corner of Alsace
still held by the French, the southern end of Mesopotamia, and the port of
Salonica, which was a strategic checkmate to the southern advance of the
Germans. The balance seemed all against them. There was no discouragement,
however, for all these difficulties had been discounted and the Allies had
always recognised that their strength lay in those reserves which had not yet
had time to develop. The opening of the summer campaign of 1916, with the
capture of Erzeroum, the invasion of Armenia, and the reconquest of Bukovina,
showed that the Russian army had at last found its second wind. The French had
already done splendid work in their classical resistance at Verdun, which had
extended from the last weeks of February onwards, and had cost the Germans over
a quarter of a million of casualties. The opening of the British campaign in
July found the whole army most eager to emulate the deeds of its Allies, and
especially to take some of the weight from the splendid defenders of Verdun.
Their fight against very heavy odds in men, munitions, and transport, was one
of the greatest deeds of arms, possibly the greatest deed of arms of the war.
It was known, however, before July that a diversion was absolutely necessary,
and although the British had taken over a fresh stretch of trenches so as to
release French reinforcements, some more active help was imperatively called
for.</p>
<p>Before describing the summer campaign it is necessary to glance back at the
proceedings of the winter and spring upon the British line, and to comment upon
one or two matters behind that line which had a direct influence upon the
campaign. Of the minor operations to which allusion has already been made,
there are none between the Battle of Loos and the middle of February 1916 which
call for particular treatment. Those skirmishes and mutual raidings which took
place during that time centred largely round the old salient at Ypres and the
one at Loos, though the lines at Armenti&egrave;res were also the scene of a
good deal of activity. One considerable attack seems to have been planned by
the Germans on the north-east of Ypres in the Christmas week of 1915&mdash;an
attack which was preceded by a formidable gas attack. The British artillery was
so powerful, however, that it crushed the advance in the trenches, where the
gathered bayonets of the stormers could be seen going down before the scourging
shrapnel like rushes before a gale. The infantry never emerged, and the losses
must have been very heavy. This was the only considerable attempt made by
either side during the winter.</p>
<p>At the time of Lord French's return another change was made at home which
had a very immediate bearing upon the direction of the War. Britain had
suffered greatly from the fact that at the beginning of hostilities the
distinguished officers who composed the central staff had all been called away
for service in the field. Lord Kitchener had done wonders in filling their
place, but it was impossible for any man, however great his abilities or
energy, to carry such a burden upon his shoulders. The more conscientious the
man the more he desires to supervise everything himself and the more danger
there is that all the field cannot be covered. Already the recruiting service,
which had absorbed a great deal of Lord Kitchener's energies with most splendid
results, had been relegated to Lord Derby, whose tact and wisdom produced fresh
armies of volunteers. Now the immediate direction of the War and the
supervision of all that pertained to the armies in the field was handed over to
Sir William Robertson, a man of great organising ability and of proved energy.
From this time onwards his character and judgment bulked larger and larger as
one of the factors which made for the success of the Allies.</p>
<p>In January 1916 Britain gave her last proof of the resolution with which she
was waging war. Already she had shown that no question of money could diminish
her ardour, for she was imposing direct taxation upon her citizens with a
vigour which formed the only solid basis for the credit of the Allies. Neither
our foes nor our friends have shown such absolute readiness to pay in hard
present cash, that posterity might walk with a straighter back, and many a man
was paying a good half of his income to the State. But now a sacrifice more
intimate than that of money had to be made. It was of that personal liberty
which is as the very breath of our nostrils. This also was thrown with a sigh
into the common cause, and a Military Service Bill was passed by which every
citizen from 19 to 41 was liable to be called up. It is questionable whether it
was necessary as yet as a military measure, since the enormous number of
5,000,000 volunteers had come forward, but as an act of justice by which the
burden should be equally distributed, and the shirker compelled to his duty, it
was possible to justify this radical departure from the customs of our fathers
and the instincts of our race. Many who acquiesced in its necessity did so with
a heavy heart, feeling how glorious would have been our record had it been
possible to bring forward by the stress of duty alone the manhood of the
nation. As a matter of fact, the margin left over was neither numerous nor
important, but the energies of the authorities were now released from the
incessant strain which the recruiting service had caused.</p>
<p>The work of the trenches was made easier for the British by the fact that
they had at last reached an equality with, and in many cases a superiority to,
their enemy, in the number of their guns, the quantity of their munitions, and
the provision of those smaller weapons such as trench mortars and machine-guns
which count for so much in this description of warfare. Their air supremacy
which had existed for a long time was threatened during some months by the
Fokker machines of the Germans, and by the skill with which their aviators used
them, but faster models from England soon restored the balance.</p>
<p>There had been a time also when the system and the telescopic sights of the
German snipers had given them an ascendancy. Thanks to the labours of various
enthusiasts for the rifle, this matter was set right and there were long
stretches of the line where no German head could for an instant be shown above
the parapet. The Canadian sector was particularly free from any snipers save
their own.</p>
<p>The first serious operation of the spring of 1916 upon the British line was
a determined German attack upon that section which lies between the
Ypres-Comines Canal and the Ypres-Comines railway on the extreme south of the
Ypres salient; Hill 60 lies to the north of it. In the line of trenches there
was one small artificial elevation, not more than thirty feet above the plain.
This was called the Bluff, and was the centre of the attack. It was of very
great importance as a point of artillery observation. During the whole of
February 13 the bombardment was very severe, and losses were heavy along a
front of several miles, the right of which was held by the Seventeenth
Division, the centre by the Fiftieth, and the left by the Twenty-fourth.
Finally, after many of the trenches had been reduced to dirt heaps five mines
were simultaneously sprung under the British front line, each of them of great
power. The explosions were instantly followed by a rush of the German infantry.
In the neighbourhood of the Bluff, the garrison, consisting at that point of
the 10th Lancashire Fusiliers, were nearly all buried or killed. To the north
lay the 10th Sherwood Foresters and north of them the 8th South Staffords,
whose Colonel, though four times wounded, continued to direct the defence. It
was impossible, however, to hold the whole line, as the Germans had seized the
Bluff and were able to enfilade all the trenches of the Sherwoods, who lost
twelve officers and several hundred men before they would admit that their
position was untenable. The South Staffords being farther off were able to hold
on, but the whole front from their right to the canal south of the Bluff was in
the hands of the Germans, who had very rapidly and skilfully consolidated it. A
strong counter-attack by the 7th Lincolns and 7th Borders, in which the
survivors of the Lancashire Fusiliers took part, had some success, but was
unable to permanently regain the lost sector, six hundred yards of which
remained with the enemy. A lieutenant, with 40 bombers of the Lincolns, 38 of
whom fell, did heroic work.</p>
<p>The attack had extended to the north, where it had fallen upon the Fiftieth
Division, and to the Twenty-fourth Division upon the left of it. Here it was
held and eventually repulsed. Of the company of the 9th Sussex who held the
extreme left of the line, a large portion were blown up by a mine and forty
were actually buried in the crater. Young Lieutenant McNair, however, the
officer in charge, showed great energy and presence of mind. He held the
Germans from the crater and with the help of another officer, who had rushed up
some supports, drove them back to their trenches. For this McNair received his
Victoria Cross. The 3rd Rifle Brigade, a veteran regular battalion, upon the
right of the Sussex, had also put up a vigorous resistance, as had the central
Fiftieth Division, so that in spite of the sudden severity of the attack it was
only at the one point of the Bluff that the enemy had made a
lodgment&mdash;that point being the real centre of their effort. They held on
strongly to their new possession, and a vigorous fire with several partial
attacks during the next fortnight failed to dislodge them.</p>
<p>Early in March the matter was taken seriously in hand, for the position was
a most important one, and a farther advance at this point would have involved
the safety of Ypres. The Seventeenth Division still held the supporting
trenches, and these now became the starting-point for the attack. A
considerable artillery concentration was effected, two brigades of guns and two
companies of sappers were brought up from the Third Division, and the 76th
Brigade of the same Division came up from St. Omer, where it had been resting,
in order to carry out the assault. The general commanding this brigade was in
immediate command of the operations.</p>
<p>The problem was a most difficult one, as the canal to the south and a marsh
upon the north screened the flanks of the new German position, while its front
was covered by shell-holes which the tempestuous weather had filled with water.
There was nothing for it, however, but a frontal attack, and this was carried
out with very great gallantry upon March 2, at 4:30 in the morning. The
infantry left their trenches in the dark and crept forward undiscovered,
dashing into the enemy's line with the first grey glimmer of the dawn. The
right of the attack formed by the 2nd Suffolks had their revenge for Le Cateau,
for they carried the Bluff itself with a rush. So far forward did they get that
a number of Germans emerged from dug-outs in their rear, and were organising a
dangerous attack when they were pelted back into their holes by a bombing
party. Beyond the Bluff the Suffolks were faced by six deep shelters for
machine-guns, which held them for a time but were eventually captured. The
centre battalion consisted of the 8th Royal Lancasters, who lost heavily from
rifle fire but charged home with great determination, flooding over the old
German front line and their support trenches as well as their immediate
objective. The left battalion in the attack were the 1st Gordon Highlanders,
who had a most difficult task, being exposed to the heaviest fire of all. For a
moment they were hung up, and then with splendid spirit threw themselves at the
hostile trenches again and carried everything before them. They were much
helped in this second attack by the supporting battalion, the 7th Lincolns,
whose bombers rushed to the front. The 10th Welsh Fusiliers, who were
supporting on the right, also did invaluable service by helping to consolidate
the Bluff, while the 9th West Ridings on the left held the British front line
and repulsed an attempt at a flanking counter-attack.</p>
<p>In spite of several counter-attacks and a very severe bombardment the line
now held firm, and the Germans seem to have abandoned all future designs upon
this section. They had lost very heavily in the assault, and 250 men with 5
officers remained in the hands of the victors. Some of the German trench taken
was found to be untenable, but the 12th West Yorkshires of the 8th Brigade
connected up the new position with the old and the salient was held. So ended a
well-managed and most successful little fight. Great credit was due to a
certain officer, who passed through the terrible German barrage again and again
to link up the troops with headquarters. Extreme gallantry was shown also by
the brigade-runners, many of whom lost their lives in the all-important work of
preserving communications.</p>
<p>Students of armour in the future may be interested to note that this was the
first engagement in which British infantry reverted after a hiatus of more than
two centuries to the use of helmets. Dints of shrapnel upon their surfaces
proved in many cases that they had been the salvation of their wearers. Several
observers have argued that trench warfare implies a special trench equipment,
entirely different from that for surface operations.</p>
<p>In the middle of March the pressure upon the French at Verdun had become
severe, and it was determined to take over a fresh section of Hue so as to
relieve troops for the north-eastern frontier. General Foch's Tenth Army, which
had held the sector opposite to Souchez and Lorette, was accordingly drawn out,
and twelve miles were added to the British front. From this time forward there
were four British armies, the Second (Plumer) in the Ypres district, the First
(Monro) opposite to Neuve Chapelle, the Third (Allenby) covering the new French
sector down to Arras, the Fourth (Rawlinson) from Albert to the Somme.</p>
<p>A brisk skirmish which occurred in the south about this period is worthy of
mention&mdash;typical of many smaller affairs the due record of which would
swell this chapter to a portentous length. In this particular instance, a very
sudden and severe night attack was directed by the Germans against a post held
by the 8th East Surreys of the Eighteenth Division at the points where the
British and French lines meet just north of the Somme. This small stronghold,
known as Ducks' Post, was at the head of a causeway across a considerable
marsh, and possessed a strategic importance out of all proportion to its size.
A violent bombardment in the darkness of the early morning of March 20 was
followed by an infantry advance, pushed well home. It was an unnerving
experience. "As the Huns charged," says one who was present, "they made the
most hellish screaming row I ever heard." The Surrey men under the lead of a
young subaltern stood fast, and were reinforced by two platoons. Not only did
they hold up the attack, but with the early dawn they advanced in turn, driving
the Germans back into their trenches and capturing a number of prisoners. The
post was strengthened and was firmly held.</p>
<p>The next episode which claims attention is the prolonged and severe fighting
which took place from March 27 onwards at St. Eloi, the scene of so fierce a
contest just one year before. A small salient had been formed by the German
line at this point ever since its capture, and on this salient was the rising
known as the Mound (not to be confounded with the Bluff), insignificant in
itself since it was only twenty or thirty feet high, but of importance in a war
where artillery observation is the very essence of all operations. It stood
just east of the little village of St. Eloi. This place was known to be very
strongly held, so the task of attacking it was handed over to the Third
Division, which had already shown at the Bluff that they were adepts at such an
attack. After several weeks of energetic preparation, five mines were ready
with charges which were so heavy that in one instance 30,000 pounds of ammonal
were employed. The assault was ordered for 4:15 in the morning of March 27. It
was known to be a desperate enterprise and was entrusted to two veteran
battalions of regular troops, the 4th Royal Fusiliers and the 1st
Northumberland Fusiliers. A frontal attack was impossible, so it was arranged
that the Royals should sweep round the left flank and the Northumberlands the
right, while the remaining battalions of the 9th Brigade, the 12th West Yorks
and 1st Scots Fusiliers, should be in close support in the centre.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour the mines were exploded with deadly effect, and in the
pitch darkness of a cloudy rainy morning the two battalions sprang resolutely
forward upon their dangerous venture. The trenches on each flank were carried,
and 5 officers with 193 men of the 18th Reserve Jaeger fell into our hands. As
usual, however, it was the retention of the captured position which was the
more difficult and costly part of the operation. The Northumberlands had won
their way round on the right, but the Fusiliers had been partially held up on
the left, so that the position was in some ways difficult and irregular. The
guns of the Third Division threw forward so fine a barrage that no German
counter-attack could get forward, but all day their fire was very heavy and
deadly upon the captured trenches, and also upon the two battalions in support.
On the night of the 27th the 9th Brigade was drawn out and the 8th took over
the new line, all access to it being impossible save in the darkness, as no
communication trenches existed. The situation was complicated by the fact that
although the British troops had on the right won their way to the rear of the
craters, one of these still contained a German detachment, who held on in a
most heroic fashion and could not be dislodged. On March 30 the situation was
still unchanged, and the 76th Brigade was put in to relieve the 8th. The 1st
Gordons were now in the line, very wet and weary, but declaring that they would
hold the ground at all costs. It was clear that the British line must be
extended and that the gallant Germans in the crater must be overwhelmed. For
this purpose, upon the night of April 2, the 8th Royal Lancasters swept across
the whole debatable ground, with the result that 4 officers and 80 men
surrendered at daylight to the Brigade-Major and a few men who summoned them
from the lip of the crater. The Divisional General had himself gone forward to
see that the captured ground was made good. "We saw our Divisional General
mid-thigh in water and splashing down the trenches," says an observer. "I can
tell you it put heart into our weary men." So ended the arduous labours of the
Third Division, who upon April 4 handed over the ground to the 2nd Canadians.
The episode of the St. Eloi craters was, however, far from being at an end. The
position was looked upon as of great importance by the Germans, apart from the
artillery observation, for their whole aim was the contraction, as that of the
British was the expansion, of the space contained in the Ypres salient. "Elbow
room! More elbow room!" was the hearts' cry of Plumer's Second Army. But the
enemy grudged every yard, and with great tenacity began a series of
counter-attacks which lasted with varying fortunes for several weeks.</p>
<p>Hardly had the Third Division filed out of the trenches when the German
bombers were buzzing and stinging all down the new line, and there were evident
signs of an impending counter-attack. Upon April 6 it broke with great
violence, beginning with a blasting storm of shells followed by a rush of
infantry in that darkest hour which precedes the dawn. It was a very terrible
ordeal for troops which had up to then seen no severe service, and for the
moment they were overborne. The attack chanced to come at the very moment when
the 27th Winnipeg Regiment was being relieved by the 29th Vancouvers, which
increased the losses and the confusion. The craters were taken by the German
stormers with 180 prisoners, but the trench line was still held. The 31st
Alberta Battalion upon the left of the position was involved in the fight and
drove back several assaults, while a small French Canadian machine-gun
detachment from the 22nd Regiment distinguished itself by an heroic resistance
in which it was almost destroyed. About noon the bombardment was so terrific
that the front trench was temporarily abandoned, the handful of survivors
falling back upon the supports. The 31st upon the left were still able to
maintain themselves, however, and after dusk they were able to reoccupy three
out of the five craters in front of the line. From this time onwards the battle
resolved itself into a desperate struggle between the opposing craters. During
the whole of April 7 it was carried on with heavy losses to both parties. On
one occasion a platoon of 40 Germans in close formation were shot down to a man
as they rushed forward in a gallant forlorn hope. For three days the struggle
went on, at the end of which time four of the craters were still held by the
Canadians. Two medical men particularly distinguished themselves by their
constant passage across the open space which divided the craters from the
trench. The consolidation of the difficult position was admirably carried out
by the C.R.E. of the Second Canadian Division.</p>
<p>The Canadians were left in comparative peace for ten days, but on April 19
there was a renewed burst of activity. Upon this day the Germans bombarded
heavily, and then attacked with their infantry at four different points of the
Ypres salient. At two they were entirely repulsed. On the Ypres-Langemarck road
on the extreme north of the British position they remained in possession of
about a hundred yards of trench. Finally, in the crater region they won back
two, including the more important one which was on the Mound. Night after night
there were bombing attacks in this region, by which the Germans endeavoured to
enlarge their gains. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were now opposed to them and
showed the same determination as the men of the West. The sector held by the
veteran First Canadian Division was also attacked, the 13th Battalion having
100 casualties and the Canadian Scots 50. Altogether this fighting had been so
incessant and severe, although as a rule confined to a very small front, that
on an average 1000 casualties a week were recorded in the corps. The fighting
was carried on frequently in' heavy rain, and the disputed craters became deep
pools of mud in which men fought waist deep, and where it was impossible to
keep rifle or machine-gun from being fouled and clogged. Several of the smaller
craters were found to be untenable by either side, and were abandoned to the
corpses which lay in the mire.</p>
<p>The Germans did not long remain in possession of the trench which they had
captured upon the 19th in the Langemarck direction. Though it was almost
unapproachable on account of the deep mud, a storming column of the 1st
Shropshires waded out to it in the dark up to their waists in slush, and turned
the enemy out with the point of the bayonet. Upon April the 21st the line was
completely re-established, though a sapper is reported to have declared that it
was impossible to consolidate porridge. In this brilliant affair the
Shropshires lost a number of officers and men, including their gallant Colonel,
Luard, and Lieutenant Johnstone, who was shot by a sniper while boldly
directing the consolidation from outside the parapet without cover of any kind.
The whole incident was an extraordinarily fine feat of arms which could only
have been carried out by a highly disciplined and determined body of men. The
mud was so deep that men were engulfed and suffocated, and the main body had to
throw themselves down and distribute their weight to prevent being sucked down
into the quagmire. The rifles were so covered and clogged that all shooting was
out of the question, and only bombs and bayonets were available for the
assault. The old 53rd never did a better day's work.</p>
<p>During the whole winter the Loos salient had been simmering, as it had never
ceased to do since the first tremendous convulsion which had established it. In
the early part of the year it was held by cavalry brigades, taking turns in
succession, and during this time there was a deceptive quiet, which was due to
the fact that the Germans were busy in running a number of mines under the
position. At the end of February the Twelfth Division took over the north of
the section, and for ten weeks they found themselves engaged in a struggle
which can only be described as hellish. How constant and severe it was may be
gauged from the fact that without any real action they lost 4000 men during
that period. As soon as they understood the state of affairs, which was only
conveyed to them by several devastating explosions, they began to run their own
mines and to raid those of their enemy. It was a nightmare conflict, half above
ground, half below, and sometimes both simultaneously, so that men may be said
to have fought in layers. The upshot of the matter, after ten weeks of
fighting, was that the British positions were held at all points, though
reduced to an extraordinary medley of craters and fissures, which some observer
has compared to a landscape in the moon. The First Division shared with the
Twelfth the winter honours of the dangerous Loos salient.</p>
<p>On April 27 a considerable surface attack developed on this part of the
line, now held by the Sixteenth Irish Division. Early upon that day the
Germans, taking advantage of the wind, which was now becoming almost as
important in a land as it had once been in a sea battle, loosed a cloud of
poison upon the trenches just south of Hulluch and followed it up by a rush of
infantry which got possession of part of the front and support Hues in the old
region of the chalk-pit wood. The 49th Brigade was in the trenches. This
Brigade consisted of the 7th and 8th Inniskillings, with the 7th and 8th Royal
Irish. It was upon the first two battalions that the cloud of gas descended,
which seems to have been of a particularly deadly brew, since it poisoned
horses upon the roads far to the rear. Many of the men were stupefied and few
were in a condition for resistance when the enemy rushed to the trenches. Two
battalions of Dublin Fusiliers, however, from the 48th Brigade were in the
adjoining trenches and were not affected by the poison. These, together with
the 8th Inniskillings, who were in the rear of the 7th, attacked the captured
trench and speedily won it back. This was the more easy as there had been a
sudden shift of wind which had blown the vile stuff back into the faces of the
German infantry. A Bavarian letter taken some days later complained bitterly of
their losses, which were stated to have reached 1300 from poison alone. The
casualties of the Irish Division were about 1500, nearly all from gas, or
shell-fire. Coming as it did at the moment when the tragic and futile rebellion
in Dublin had seemed to place the imagined interests of Ireland in front of
those of European civilisation, this success was most happily timed. The brunt
of the fighting was borne equally by troops from the north and from the south
of Ireland&mdash;a happy omen, we will hope, for the future.</p>
<p>Amongst the other local engagements which broke the monotony of trench life
may be mentioned one upon May 11 near the Hohenzollern Redoubt where the
Germans held for a short time a British trench, taking 127 of the occupants
prisoners. More serious was the fighting upon the Vimy Ridge south of Souchez
on May 15. About 7:30 on the evening of that day the British exploded a series
of mines which, either by accident or design, were short of the German
trenches. The sector was occupied by the Twenty-fifth Division, and the
infantry attack was entrusted to the 11th Lancashire Fusiliers and the 9th
North Lancashires, both of the 74th Brigade. They rushed forward with great
dash and occupied the newly-formed craters, where they established themselves
firmly, joining them up with each other and cutting communications backwards so
as to make a new observation trench.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fifth Division lay at this time with the Forty-seventh London
Division as its northern neighbour, the one forming the left-hand unit of the
Third Army, and the other the extreme right of the First. Upon the 19th the
Londoners took over the new position from the 74th, and found it to be an evil
inheritance, for upon May 21, when they were in the very act of relieving the
7th and 75th Brigades, which formed the front of the Twenty-fifth Division,
they were driven in by a terrific bombardment and assault from the German
lines. On the front of a brigade the Germans captured not only the new ground
won but our own front line and part of our supporting line. Old soldiers
declared that the fire upon this occasion was among the most concentrated and
deadly of the whole War. With the new weapons artillery is not needed at such
short range, for with aerial torpedoes the same effect can be produced as with
guns of a great calibre.</p>
<p>In the early morning of April 30, there was a strong attack by the Germans
at Wulverghem, which was the village to the west of Messines, to which our line
had been shifted after the attack of November 2, 1914. There is no doubt that
all this bustling upon the part of the Germans was partly for the purpose of
holding us to our ground while they dealt with the French at Verdun, and partly
to provoke a premature offensive, since they well knew that some great movement
was in contemplation. As a matter of fact, all the attacks, including the final
severe one upon the Canadian lines, were dealt with by local defenders and had
no strategic effect at all. In the case of the Wulverghem attack it was
preceded by an emission of gas of such intensity that it produced much sickness
as far off as Bailleul, at least six miles to the west. Horses in the distant
horse lines fell senseless under the noxious vapour. It came on with such
rapidity that about a hundred men of the Twenty-fourth Division were overcome
before they could get on their helmets. The rest were armed against it, and
repelled the subsequent infantry attacks carried out by numerous small bodies
of exploring infantry, without any difficulty. The whole casualties of the
Fifth Corps, whose front was attacked, amounted to 400, half by gas and half by
the shells.</p>
<p>In May, General Alderson, who had commanded the Canadians with such success
from the beginning, took over new duties and gave place to General Sir Julian
Byng, the gallant commander of the Third Cavalry Division.</p>
<p>Upon June 2 there began an action upon the Canadian front at Ypres which led
to severe fighting extending over several weeks, and put a very heavy strain
upon a corps the First Division of which had done magnificent work during more
than a year, whilst the other two divisions had only just eased up after the
fighting of the craters. Knowing well that the Allies were about to attack, the
Germans were exceedingly anxious to gain some success which would compel them
to disarrange their plans and to suspend that concentration of troops and guns
which must precede any great effort. In searching for such a success it was
natural that they should revert to the Ypres salient, which had always been the
weakest portion of the line&mdash;so weak, indeed, that when it is seen
outlined by the star shells at night, it seems to the spectator to be almost
untenable, since the curve of the German line was such that it could command
the rear of all the British trenches. It was a region of ruined cottages,
shallow trenches commanded by the enemy's guns, and shell-swept woods so
shattered and scarred that they no longer furnished any cover. These woods,
Zouave Wood, Sanctuary Wood, and others lie some hundred yards behind the front
trenches and form a rallying-point for those who retire, and a place of
assembly for those who advance.</p>
<p>The Canadian front was from four to five miles long, following the line of
the trenches. The extreme left lay upon the ruined village of Hooge. This part
of the line was held by the Royal Canadian Regiment. For a mile to their right,
in front of Zouave and Sanctuary Woods, the Princess Patricia's held the line
over low-lying ground. In immediate support was the 49th Regiment. These all
belonged to the 7th Canadian Brigade. This formed the left or northern sector
of the position.</p>
<p>In the centre was a low hill called Mount Sorel, in which the front trenches
were located. Immediately in its rear is another elevation, somewhat higher,
and used as an observing station. This was Observatory Hill. A wood, Armagh
Wood, covered the slope of this hill. There is about two hundred yards of
valley between Mount Sorel and Observatory Hill, with a small stream running
down it. This section of the line was essential for the British, since in the
hands of the enemy it would command all the rest. It was garrisoned by the 8th
Brigade, consisting of Canadian Mounted Rifles.</p>
<p>The right of the Canadian line, including St. Eloi upon the extreme limit of
their sector, was held by troops of the Second Canadian Division. This part of
the line was not involved in the coming attack. It broke upon the centre and
the left, the Mount Sorel and the Hooge positions.</p>
<p>The whole operation was very much more important than was appreciated by the
British public at the time, and formed a notable example of anticipatory
tactics upon the part of the German General Staff. Just as they had delayed the
advance upon the west by their furious assault upon Verdun on the east, so they
now calculated that by a fierce attack upon the north of the British line they
might disperse the gathering storm which was visibly banking up in the Somme
Valley. It was a bold move, boldly carried out, and within appreciable distance
of success.</p>
<p>Their first care was to collect and concentrate a great number of guns and
mine-throwers on the sector to be attacked. This concentration occurred at the
very moment when our own heavy artillery was in a transition stage, some of it
going south to the Somme. Hardly a gun had sounded all morning. Then in an
instant with a crash and a roar several mines were sprung under the trenches,
and a terrific avalanche of shells came smashing down among the astounded men.
It is doubtful if a more hellish storm of projectiles of every sort had ever up
to that time been concentrated upon so limited a front. There was death from
the mines below, death from the shells above, chaos and destruction all around.
The men were dazed and the trenches both in front and those of communication
were torn to pieces and left as heaps of rubble.</p>
<p>One great mine destroyed the loop of line held by the Princess Patricia's
and buried a company in the ruins. A second exploded at Mount Sorel and did
great damage. At the first outburst Generals Mercer and Williams had been
hurried into a small tunnel out of the front line, but the mine explosion
obliterated the mouth of the tunnel and they were only extricated with
difficulty. General Mercer was last seen encouraging the men, but he had
disappeared after the action and his fate was unknown to friend or foe until
ten days later his body was found with both legs broken in one of the side
trenches. He died as he had lived, a very gallant soldier. For four hours the
men cowered down in what was left of the trenches, awaiting the inevitable
infantry attack which would come from the German lines fifty yards away. When
at last it came it met with little resistance, for there were few to resist.
Those few were beaten down by the rush of the W&uuml;rtembergers who formed the
attacking division. They carried the British line for a length of nearly a
mile, from Mount Sorel to the south of Hooge, and they captured about 500 men,
a large proportion of whom were wounded. General Williams, Colonel Usher, and
twelve other officers were taken.</p>
<p>When the German stormers saw the havoc in the trenches they may well have
thought that they had only to push, forward to pierce the line and close their
hands at last upon the coveted Ypres. If any such expectation was theirs, they
must have been new troops who had no knowledge of the dour tenacity of the
Canadians. The men who first faced poison gas without masks were not so lightly
driven. The German attack was brought to a standstill by the withering
rifle-fire from the woods, and though the assailants were still able to hold
the ground occupied they were unable to increase their gains, while in spite of
a terrific barrage of shrapnel fresh Canadian battalions, the 14th and 15th
from the 3rd Canadian Brigade, were coming up from the rear to help their
exhausted companions.</p>
<p>The evening of June 2 was spent in confused skirmishing, the advanced
patrols of the Germans getting into the woods and being held up by the Canadian
infantry moving up to the front. Some German patrols are said to have got as
far as Zillebeke village, three-quarters of a mile in advance of their old
line. By the morning of June 3 these intruders had been pushed back, but a
counter-attack before dawn by the 9th Brigade was held up by artillery fire,
Colonel Hay of the 52nd (New Ontario) Regiment and many officers and men being
put out of action. The British guns were now hard at work, and the
W&uuml;rtembergers in the captured trenches were enduring something of what the
Canadians had undergone the day before. About 7 o'clock the 2nd and 3rd
Canadian Brigades, veterans of Ypres, began to advance, making their way
through the woods and over the bodies of the German skirmishers. When the
advance got in touch with the captured trenches it was held up, for the
W&uuml;rtembergers stood to it like men, and were well supported by their
gunners.</p>
<p>On the right the 7th and 10th Canadians got well forward, but had not enough
weight for a serious attack. It became clear that a premature counter-attack
might lead to increased losses, and that the true method was to possess one's
soul in patience until the preparation could be made for a decisive operation.
The impatience and ardour of the men were very great, and their courage had a
fine edge put upon it by a churlish German official communiqu&eacute;, adding
one more disgrace to their military annals, which asserted that more Canadian
prisoners had not been taken because they had fled so fast. Canadians could
smile at the insult, but it was the sort of smile that is more menacing than a
frown. The infantry waited grimly while some of the missing guns were recalled
into their position. Up to this time the losses had been about 80 officers and
2000 men.</p>
<p>The weather was vile, with incessant rain which turned the fields into bogs
and the trenches into canals. For a few days things were at a standstill, for
the clouds prevented aeroplane reconnaissance and the registration of the guns.
The Corps lay in front of its lost trenches like a wounded bear looking across
with red eyes at its stolen cub. The Germans had taken advantage of the lull to
extend their line, and on June 6 they had occupied the ruins of Hooge, which
were impossible to hold after all the trenches to the south had been lost. In
their new line the Germans awaited the attack which they afterwards admitted
that they knew to be inevitable. The British gun-fire was so severe that it was
very difficult for them to improve their new position.</p>
<p>On the 13th the weather had moderated and all was ready for the
counter-attack. It was carried out at two in the morning by two composite
brigades. The 3rd (Toronto) and 7th Battalions led upon the right, while the
13th (Royal Highlanders) and 16th (Canadian Scots) were in the van of the left,
with their pipers skirling in front of them. Machine-guns supported the whole
advance. The right flank of the advance, being exposed to the German
machine-guns, was shrouded by the smoke of 200 bombs. The night was a very dark
one and the Canadian Scots had taken advantage of it to get beyond the front
line, and, as it proved, inside the German barrage zone, so that heavy as it
was it did them no scathe. The new German Hue was carried with a magnificent
rush, and a second heave lifted the wave of stormers into the old British
trenches&mdash;or the place where they had been. Nine machine-guns and 150
prisoners from the 119th, 120th, 125th, and 127th W&uuml;rtemberg Regiments
were captured. To their great joy the Canadians discovered that such munitions
as they had abandoned upon June 2 were still in the trenches and reverted into
their hands. It is pleasant to add that evidence was found that the
W&uuml;rtembergers had behaved with humanity towards the wounded. From this
time onwards the whole Canadian area from close to Hooge (the village still
remained with the enemy) across the front of the woods, over Mount Sorel, and
on to Hill 60, was consolidated and maintained. Save the heavy reciprocal
losses neither side had anything to show for all their desperate fighting, save
that the ruins of Hooge were now German. The Canadian losses in the total
operations came to about 7000 men&mdash;a figure which is eloquent as to the
severity of the fighting. They emerged from the ordeal with their military
reputation more firmly established than ever. Ypres will surely be a place of
pilgrimage for Canadians in days to come, for the ground upon the north of the
city and also upon the south-east is imperishably associated with the martial
traditions of their country. The battle just described is the most severe
action between the epic of Loos upon the one side, and that tremendous episode
in the south, upon the edge of which we are now standing.</p>
<p>There is one other happening of note which may in truth be taken as an
overture of that gigantic performance. This was the action of the Seventeenth
Corps upon June 30, the eve of the Somme battle, in which the Thirty-ninth
Division, supported by guns from the Thirty-fifth and Fifty-first Divisions
upon each side of it, attacked the German trenches near Richebourg at a spot
known as the Boar's Head. The attack was so limited in the troops employed and
so local in area that it can only be regarded as a feint to take the German
attention from the spot where the real danger was brewing.</p>
<p>After an artillery preparation of considerable intensity, the infantry
assault was delivered by the 12th and 13th Royal Sussex of the 116th Brigade.
The scheme was that they should advance in three waves and win their way to the
enemy support line, which they were to convert into the British front line,
while the divisional pioneer battalion, the 13th Gloster, was to join it up to
the existing system by new communication trenches. For some reason, however, a
period of eleven hours seems to have elapsed between the first bombardment and
the actual attack. The latter was delivered at three in the morning after a
fresh bombardment of only ten minutes. So ready were the Germans that an
observer has remarked that had a string been tied from the British batteries to
the German the opening could not have been more simultaneous, and they had
brought together a great weight of metal. Every kind of high explosive,
shrapnel, and trench mortar bombs rained on the front and support line, the
communication trenches and No Man's Land, in addition to a most hellish fire of
machine-guns. The infantry none the less advanced with magnificent ardour,
though with heavy losses. On occupying the German front line trenches there was
ample evidence that the guns had done their work well, for the occupants were
lying in heaps. The survivors threw bombs to the last moment, and then cried,
"Kamerad!" Few of them were taken back. Two successive lines were captured, but
the losses were too heavy to allow them to be held, and the troops had
eventually under heavy shell-fire to fall back on their own front lines. Only
three officers came back unhurt out of the two battalions, and the losses of
rank and file came to a full two-thirds of the number engaged. "The men were
magnificent," says one who led them, but they learned the lesson which was
awaiting so many of their comrades in the south, that all human bravery cannot
overcome conditions which are essentially impossible. A heavy German
bombardment continued for some time, flattening out the trenches and inflicting
losses, not only upon the 39th but upon the 51st Highland Territorial Division.
This show of heavy artillery may be taken as the most pleasant feature in the
whole episode, since it shows that its object was attained at least to the very
important extent of holding up the German guns. Those heavy batteries upon the
Somme might well have modified our successes of the morrow.</p>
<p>A second attack made with the same object of distracting the attention of
the Germans and holding up their guns was made at an earlier date at a point
called the triangle opposite to the Double Grassier near Loos. This attack was
started at 9:10 upon the evening of June 10, and was carried out in a most
valiant fashion by the 2nd Rifles and part of the 2nd Royal Sussex, both of the
2nd Brigade. There can be no greater trial for troops, and no greater sacrifice
can be demanded of a soldier, than to risk and probably lose his life in an
attempt which can obviously have no permanent result, and is merely intended to
ease pressure elsewhere. The gallant stormers reached and in several places
carried the enemy's line, but no lasting occupation could be effected, and they
had eventually to return to their own fine. The Riflemen, who were the chief
sufferers, lost 11 officers and 200 men.</p>
<p>A word should be said as to the raids along the line of the German trenches
by which it was hoped to distract their attention from the point of attack, and
also to obtain precise information as to the disposition of their units. It is
difficult to say whether the British were the gainers or the losers on balance
in these raids, for some were successful, while some were repelled. Among a
great number of gallant attempts, the details of which hardly come within the
scale of this chronicle, the most successful perhaps were two made by the 9th
Highland Light Infantry and by the 2nd Welsh Fusiliers, both of the Thirty
third Division. In both of these cases very extensive damage was done and
numerous prisoners were taken.</p>
<p>When one reads the intimate accounts of these affairs, the stealthy
approaches, the blackened faces, the clubs and revolvers which formed the
weapons, the ox-goads for urging Germans out of dug-outs, the dark lanterns and
the knuckle-dusters&mdash;one feels that the age of adventure is not yet past
and that the spirit of romance was not entirely buried in the trenches of
modern war. There were 70 such raids in the week which preceded the great
attack.</p>
<p>Before plunging into the huge task of following and describing the various
phases of the mighty Battle of the Somme a word must be said upon the naval
history of the period which can all be summed up in the Battle of Jutland,
since the situation after that battle was exactly as it had always been before
it. This fact in itself shows upon which side the victory lay, since the whole
object of the movements of the German Fleet was to produce a relaxation in
these conditions. Through the modesty of the British bulletins, which was
pushed somewhat to excess, the position for some days was that the British, who
had won everything, claimed nothing, while the Germans, who had won nothing,
claimed everything. It is true that a number of our ships were sunk and of our
sailors drowned, including Hood and Arbuthnot, two of the ablest of our younger
admirals. Even by the German accounts, however, their own losses in proportion
to their total strength were equally heavy, and we have every reason to doubt
their accounts since they not only do not correspond with reliable observations
upon our side, but because their second official account was compelled to admit
that their first one had been false. The whole affair may be summed up by
saying that after making an excellent fight they were saved from total
destruction by the haze of evening, and fled back in broken array to their
ports, leaving the North Sea now as always in British keeping. At the same time
it cannot be denied that here as at Coronel and the Falklands the German ships
were well fought, the gunnery was good, and the handling of the fleet, both
during the battle and especially under the difficult circumstances of the
flight in the darkness to avoid a superior fleet between themselves and home,
was of a high order. It was a good clean fight, and in the general disgust at
the flatulent claims of the Kaiser and his press the actual merit of the German
performance did not perhaps receive all the appreciation which it deserved.</p>

<p class="first">THE continued German pressure at Verdun which had reached a
high point in June called insistently for an immediate allied attack at the
western end of the line. With a fine spirit of comradeship General Haig had
placed himself and his armies at the absolute disposal of General Joffre, and
was prepared to march them to Verdun, or anywhere else where he could best
render assistance. The solid Joffre, strong and deliberate, was not disposed to
allow the western offensive to be either weakened or launched prematurely on
account of German attacks at the eastern frontier. He believed that Verdun
could for the time look after herself, and the result showed the clearness of
his vision. Meanwhile, he amassed a considerable French army, containing many
of his best active troops, on either side of the Somme. General Foch was in
command. They formed the right wing of the great allied force about to make a
big effort to break or shift the iron German line, which had been built up with
two years of labour, until it represented a tangled vista of trenches,
parapets, and redoubts mutually supporting and bristling with machine-guns and
cannon, for many miles of depth.</p>
<p>Never in the whole course of history have soldiers been confronted with such
an obstacle. Yet from general to private, both in the French and in the British
armies, there was universal joy that the long stagnant trench life should be at
an end, and that the days of action, even if they should prove to be days of
death, should at last have come. Our concern is with the British forces, and so
they are here set forth as they stretched upon the left or north of their good
allies.</p>

"British Battle Line, July 1st, 1916"></a></div>
<p class="caption">British Battle Line, July 1st, 1916</p>
<br>
<p>The southern end of the whole British line was held by the Fourth Army,
commanded by General Rawlinson, an officer who has always been called upon when
desperate work was afoot. His army consisted of five corps, each of which
included from three to four divisions, so that his infantry numbered about
200,000 men, many of whom were veterans, so far as a man may live to be a
veteran amid the slaughter of such a campaign. The Corps, counting from the
junction with the French, were, the Thirteenth (Congreve), Fifteenth (Horne),
Third (Pulteney), Tenth (Morland), and Eighth (Hunter-Weston). Their divisions,
frontage, and the objectives will be discussed in the description of the battle
itself.</p>
<p>North of Rawlinson's Fourth Army, and touching it at the village of
H&eacute;buterne, was Allenby's Third Army, of which one single corps, the
Seventh (Snow), was engaged in the battle. This added three divisions, or about
30,000 infantry, to the numbers quoted above.</p>
<p>It had taken months to get the troops into position, to accumulate the guns,
and to make the enormous preparations which such a battle must entail. How
gigantic and how minute these are can only be appreciated by those who are
acquainted with the work of the staffs. As to the Chief Staff of all, if a
civilian may express an opinion upon so technical a matter, no praise seems to
be too high for General Kiggell and the others under the immediate direction of
Sir Douglas Haig, who had successively shown himself to be a great Corps
General, a great Army leader, and now a great General-in-Chief. The
preparations were enormous and meticulous, yet everything ran like a well-oiled
piston-rod. Every operation of the attack was practised on similar ground
behind the lines. New railheads were made, huge sidings constructed, and great
dumps accumulated. The corps and divisional staffs were also excellent, but
above all it was upon those hard-worked and usually overlooked men, the
sappers, that the strain fell. Assembly trenches had to be dug, double
communication trenches had to be placed in parallel lines, one taking the
up-traffic and one the down, water supplies, bomb shelters, staff dug-outs,
poison-gas arrangements, tunnels and mines&mdash;there was no end to the work
of the sappers. The gunners behind laboured night after night in hauling up and
concealing their pieces, while day after day they deliberately and carefully
registered upon their marks. The question of ammunition supply had assumed
incredible proportions. For the needs of one single corps forty-six miles of
motor-lorries were engaged in bringing up the shells. However, by the end of
June all was in place and ready. The bombardment began about June 23, and was
at once answered by a German one of lesser intensity. The fact that the attack
was imminent was everywhere known, for it was absolutely impossible to make
such preparations and concentrations in a secret fashion. "Come on, we are
ready for you," was hoisted upon placards on several of the German trenches.
The result was to show that they spoke no more than the truth.</p>
<p>There were limits, however, to the German appreciation of the plans of the
Allies. They were apparently convinced that the attack would come somewhat
farther to the north, and their plans, which covered more than half of the
ground on which the attack actually did occur, had made that region
impregnable, as we were to learn to our cost. Their heaviest guns and their
best troops were there. They had made a far less elaborate preparation,
however, at the front which corresponded with the southern end of the British
line, and also on that which faced the French. The reasons for this may be
surmised. The British front at that point is very badly supplied with roads (or
was before the matter was taken in hand), and the Germans may well have thought
that no advance upon a great scale was possible. So far as the French were
concerned they had probably over-estimated the pre-occupation of Verdun and had
not given our Allies credit for the immense reserve vitality which they were to
show. The French front to the south of the Somme was also faced by a great bend
of the river which must impede any advance. Then again it is wooded, broken
country down there, and gives good concealment for masking an operation. These
were probably the reasons which induced the Germans to make a miscalculation
which proved to be an exceedingly serious one, converting what might have been
a German victory into a great, though costly, success for the Allies, a prelude
to most vital results in the future.</p>
<p>It is, as already stated, difficult to effect a surprise upon the large
scale in modern warfare. There are still, however, certain departments in which
with energy and ingenuity effects may be produced as unforeseen as they are
disconcerting. The Air Service of the Allies, about which a book which would be
one long epic of heroism could be written, had been growing stronger, and had
dominated the situation during the last few weeks, but it had not shown its
full strength nor its intentions until the evening before the bombardment. Then
it disclosed both in most dramatic fashion. Either side had lines of stationary
airships from which shell-fire is observed. To the stranger approaching the
lines they are the first intimation that he is in the danger area, and he sees
them in a double row, extending in a gradually dwindling vista to either
horizon. Now by a single raid and in a single night, every observation airship
of the Germans was brought in flames to the earth. It was a splendid coup,
splendidly carried out. Where the setting sun had shone on a long German array
the dawn showed an empty eastern sky. From that day for many a month the Allies
had command of the air with all that it means to modern artillery. It was a
good omen for the coming fight, and a sign of the great efficiency to which the
British Air Service under General Trenchard had attained. The various types for
scouting, for artillery work, for raiding, and for fighting were all very
highly developed and splendidly handled by as gallant and chivalrous a band of
heroic youths as Britain has ever enrolled among her guardians. The new F.E.
machine and the de Haviland Biplane fighting machine were at this time equal to
anything the Germans had in the air.</p>
<p>The attack had been planned for June 28, but the weather was so tempestuous
that it was put off until it should moderate, a change which was a great strain
upon every one concerned. July 1 broke calm and warm with a gentle
south-western breeze. The day had come. All morning from early dawn there was
intense fire, intensely answered, with smoke barrages thrown during the last
half-hour to such points as could with advantage be screened. At 7:30 the guns
lifted, the whistles blew, and the eager infantry were over the parapets. The
great Battle of the Somme, the fierce crisis of Armageddon, had come. In
following the fate of the various British forces during this eventful and most
bloody day we will begin at the northern end of the line, where the Seventh
Corps (Snow) faced the salient of Gommecourt.</p>
<p>This corps consisted of the Thirty-seventh, Forty-sixth, and Fifty-sixth
Divisions. The former was not engaged and lay to the north. The others were
told off to attack the bulge on the German line, the Forty-sixth upon the
north, and the Fifty-sixth upon the south, with the village of Gommecourt as
their immediate objective. Both were well-tried and famous territorial units,
the Forty-sixth North Midland being the division which carried the Hohenzollern
Redoubt upon October 13, 1915, while the Fifty-sixth was made up of the old
London territorial battalions, which had seen so much fighting in earlier days
while scattered among the regular brigades. Taking our description of the
battle always from the north end of of the the line we shall begin with the
attack of the Forty-sixth Division.</p>
<p>The assault was carried out by two brigades, each upon a two-battalion
front. Of these the 137th Brigade of Stafford men were upon the right, while
the 139th Brigade of Sherwood Foresters were on the left, each accompanied by a
unit of sappers. The 138th Brigade, less one battalion, which was attached to
the 137th, was in reserve. The attack was covered so far as possible with
smoke, which was turned on five minutes before the hour. The general
instructions to both brigades were that after crossing No Man's Land and taking
the first German fine they should bomb their way up the communication trenches,
and so force a passage into Gommecourt Wood. Each brigade was to advance in
four waves at fifty yards interval, with six feet between each man. Warned by
our past experience of the wastage of precious material, not more than 20
officers of each battalion were sent forward with the attack, and a
proportional number of N.C.O.'s were also withheld. The average equipment of
the stormers, here and elsewhere, consisted of steel helmet, haversack,
water-bottle, rations for two days, two gas helmets, tear-goggles, 220
cartridges, two bombs, two sandbags, entrenching tool, wire-cutters, field
dressings, and signal-flare. With this weight upon them, and with trenches
which were half full of water, and the ground between a morass of sticky mud,
some idea can be formed of the strain upon the infantry.</p>
<p>Both the attacking brigades got away with splendid steadiness upon the tick
of time. In the case of the 137th Brigade the 6th South Staffords and 6th North
Staffords were in the van, the former of the being on the right flank where it
joined up with the left of the Fifty-sixth Division. The South Staffords came
into a fatal blast of machine-gun fire as they dashed forward, and their track
was marked by a thick litter of dead and wounded. None the less, they poured
into the trenches opposite to them but found them strongly held by infantry of
the Fifty-second German Division. There was some fierce bludgeon work in the
trenches, but the losses in crossing had been too heavy and the survivors were
unable to make good. The trench was held by the Germans and the assault
repulsed. The North Staffords had also won their way into the front trenches,
but in their case also they had lost so heavily that they were unable to clear
the trench, which was well and stoutly defended. At the instant of attack, here
as elsewhere, the Germans had put so terrific a barrage between the fines that
it was impossible for the supports to get up and no fresh momentum could be
added to the failing attack.</p>
<p>The fate of the right attack had been bad, but that of the left was even
worse, for at this point we had experience of a German procedure which was
tried at several places along the line with most deadly effect, and accounted
for some of our very high losses. This device was to stuff their front line
dug-outs with machine-guns and men, who would emerge when the wave of stormers
had passed, attacking them from the rear, confident that their own rear was
safe on account of the terrific barrage between the lines.</p>
<p>In this case the stormers were completely trapped. The 5th and 7th Sherwood
Foresters dashed through the open ground, carried the trenches and pushed
forward on their fiery career. Instantly the barrage fell, the concealed
infantry rose behind them, and their fate was sealed. With grand valour the
leading four waves stormed their way up the communication trenches and beat
down all opposition until their own dwindling numbers and the failure of their
bombs left them helpless among their enemies. Thus perished the first companies
of two fine battalions, and few survivors of them ever won their way back to
the British lines. Brave attempts were made during the day to get across to
their aid, but all were beaten down by the terrible barrage. In the evening the
5th Lincolns made a most gallant final effort to reach their lost comrades, and
got across to the German front line which they found to be strongly held. So
ended a tragic episode. The cause which produced it was, as will be seen,
common to the whole northern end of the line, and depended upon factors which
neither officers nor men could control, the chief of which were that the work
of our artillery, both in getting at the trench garrisons and in its
counter-battery effects had been far less deadly than we had expected. The
losses of the division came to about 2700 men.</p>
<p>The attack upon the southern side of the Gommecourt peninsula, though urged
with the utmost devotion and corresponding losses, had no more success than
that in the north. There is no doubt that the unfortunate repulse of the 137th
Brigade upon their left, occurring as it did while the Fifty-sixth Division was
still advancing, enabled the Germans to concentrate their guns and reserves
upon the Londoners, but knowing what we know, it can hardly be imagined that
under any circumstances, with failure upon either side of them, the division
could have held the captured ground. The preparations for the attack had been
made with great energy, and for two successive nights as many as 3000 men were
out digging between the lines, which was done with such disciplined silence
that there were not more than 50 casualties all told. The 167th Brigade was
left in reserve, having already suffered heavily while holding the water-logged
trenches during the constant shell-fall of the last week. The 7th Middlesex
alone had lost 12 officers and 300 men from this cause&mdash;a proportion which
may give some idea of what the heavy British bombardment may have meant to the
Germans. The advance was, therefore, upon a two-brigade front, the 168th being
on the right and the 169th upon the left. The London Scottish and the 12th
London Rangers were the leading battalions of the 168th, while the Westminsters
and Victorias led the 169th with the 4th London, 13th Kensingtons, 2nd London
and London Rifle Brigade in support. The advance was made with all the fiery
dash with which the Cockney soldiers have been associated. The first, second,
and third German lines of trench were successively carried, and it was not
until they, or those of them who were left, had reached the fourth line that
they were held. It was powerfully manned, bravely defended, and well provided
with bombs&mdash;a terrible obstacle for a scattered line of weary and often
wounded men. The struggle was a heroic one. Even now had their rear been clear,
or had there been a shadow of support these determined men would have burst the
only barrier which held them from Gommecourt. But the steel curtain of the
barrage had closed down of the behind them, and every overrun trench was
sending out its lurking occupants to fire into their defenceless backs. Bombs,
too, are essential in such a combat, and bombs must ever be renewed, since few
can be carried at a time. For long hours the struggle went on, but it was the
pitiful attempt of heroic men to postpone that retreat which was inevitable.
Few of the advanced line ever got back. The 3rd London, particularly, sent
forward several hundred men with bombs, but hardly any got across. Sixty London
Scots started on the same terrible errand. In the late afternoon the remains of
the two brigades were back in the British front line, having done all, and more
than all, that brave soldiers could be expected to do. The losses were very
heavy. Never has the manhood of London in one single day sustained so grievous
a loss. It is such hours which test the very soul of the soldier. War is not
all careless slang and jokes and cigarettes, though such superficial sides of
it may amuse the public and catch the eye of the descriptive writer. It is the
most desperately earnest thing to which man ever sets his hand or his mind.
Many a hot oath and many a frenzied prayer go up from the battle line. Strong
men are shaken to the soul with the hysteria of weaklings, and balanced brains
are dulled into vacancy or worse by the dreadful sustained shock of it. The
more honour then to those who, broken and wearied, still hold fast in the face
of all that human flesh abhors, bracing their spirits by a sense of soldierly
duty and personal honour which is strong enough to prevail over death
itself.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to be able to record an instance of good feeling upon the
part of the enemy. Some remains of the old German spirit would now and again,
though with sad rarity, shake itself free from the acrid and poisonous Prussian
taint. On this occasion a German prisoner was sent back from our lines after
nightfall with a note to the officer in command asking for details as to the
fate of the British missing. An answer was found tied on to the barbed wire in
the morning which gave the desired information. It is fair to state also that
the wounded taken by the enemy appear to have met with good treatment.</p>
<p>So much for the gallant and tragic attack of the Seventh Corps. General
Snow, addressing his men after the battle, pointed out that their losses and
their efforts had not been all in vain. "I can assure you," he said, "that by
your determined attack you managed to keep large forces of the enemy at your
front, thereby materially assisting in the operations which were proceeding
farther south with such marked success." No doubt the claim is a just one, and
even while we mourn over the fate of four grand Army corps upon the left wing
of the Allied Army, we may feel that they sacrificed themselves in order to
assure the advance of those corps of their comrades to the south who had
profited by the accumulation of guns and men to the north of them in order to
burst their way through the German line. It is possible that here as on some
other occasions the bitter hatred which the Germans had for the British,
nurtured as it was by every lie which could appeal to their passions, had
distorted their vision and twisted their counsels to an extent which proved to
be their ruin.</p>
<p>The Eighth Corps, a magnificent body of troops, was under the command of
General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston. It consisted of the Forty-eighth South
Midland Territorial Division, the Fourth Regular Division, the Twenty-ninth
Regular Division, and the Thirty-first Division of the New Army. Their front
extended from H&eacute;buterne in the north, where they joined on to the
Fifty-sixth Division, down to a point just north of the Ancre, and it faced the
very strong German positions of Serre in the north, and of Beaumont Hamel in
the centre. The latter was an exceptionally difficult place, for it contained
enormous quarries and excavations in which masses of Germans could remain
concealed, almost immune to shell-fire and ready to sally out when needed. In
spite of the terrific bombardment the actual damage done to the enemy was not
excessive, and neither his numbers, his moral, nor his guns had been seriously
diminished. The order of battle was as follows: the Forty-eighth Division was
in reserve, save for the 143rd Warwick Brigade. Of this brigade two battalions,
the 5th and 6th Warwicks, were placed on a defensive line with orders to hold
the trenches for about a mile south of H&eacute;buterne. The 7th and 8th
Warwicks were attached to the Fourth Division for the assault.</p>
<p>Immediately south of the defensive line held by the two Warwick battalions
was the Thirty-first Division, having Serre for its objective. South of this,
and opposite to Beaumont Hamel, was the Fourth, and south of this again was the
Twenty-ninth Division, which had returned from the magnificent failure of the
Dardanelles, bearing with it a high reputation for efficiency and valour.
Incorporated with it was a regiment of Newfoundlanders, men recruited from
among the fishers and farmers of that northern land, the oldest colony of
Britain. Such was the force, comprising nearly 50,000 excellent infantry, who
set forth upon the formidable adventure of forcing the lines of Beaumont Hamel.
They were destined to show the absolute impossibility of such a task in the
face of a steadfast unshaken enemy, supported by a tremendous artillery, but
their story is a most glorious one, and many a great British victory contains
no such record of tenacity and military virtue.</p>
<p>At a quarter past five the assaulting lines were in the assembly trenches,
and shortly afterwards the smoke and artillery barrages were released. At 7:20
an enormous mine, which had been run under Hawthorn Redoubt in front of the
Fourth Division, was exploded, and a monstrous column of debris, with the
accompanying shock of an earthquake, warned friend and foe that the hour of
doom, the crisis of such mighty preparations, was at hand. At 7:30 the whistles
blew, and the men, springing with eager alacrity over the parapet, advanced in
successive lines of assault against the German trenches.</p>
<p>Before giving in detail the circumstances which determined the result in
each division, it may be well to avoid wearisome iteration by giving certain
facts which are common to each. In every case the troops advanced in an
extended formation of companies in successive waves. In nearly every case the
German front line was seized and penetrated, in no case was there any
hesitation or disorder among the advancing troops, but the highest possible
degree of discipline and courage was shown by regulars, territorials, and men
of the New Army, nor could it be said that there was any difference between
them. In each case also the Germans met the assault with determined valour; in
each case the successive lines of trenches were more strongly held, and the
assailants were attacked from the the rear by those who emerged from the
dug-outs behind them, and above all in each case a most murderous artillery
fire was opened from a semi-circle all round the German position, but
especially from one huge accumulation of heavy guns, said to number a hundred
batteries, stationed on the high ground near Bucquoy and commanding the British
position. These guns formed successive lines of barrage with shrapnel and high
explosives, one of them about 200 yards behind the British line, to cut off the
supports; another 50 yards behind; another 60 yards in front; and a fourth of
shrapnel which was under observed control, and followed the troops in their
movements. The advanced lines of assault were able in most cases to get through
before these barrages were effectively established, but they made it difficult,
deadly, and often impossible for the lines who followed.</p>
<p>None the less it is the opinion of skilled observers that the shell-fire
alone, however heavy, could not have taken the edge from the inexorable
insistence of the British attack. It is to the skill and to the personal
gallantry of the German machine-gunners that the result is to be traced. The
bombardment of the German line had been so severe that it was hoped that most
of the machine-guns had been rooted out. So indeed they had, but they had been
withdrawn to the safety of excavations in the immediate rear. Suspecting this,
the British artillery sprayed the ground behind the trenches with showers of
shrapnel to prevent their being brought forward again. This barrage was not
sufficient to subdue the gunners, who dashed forward and established their
pieces at the moment of the assault upon the various parapets and points of
vantage, from which, regardless of their own losses, they poured a withering
fire upon the infantry in the open. These brave W&uuml;rtembergers were seen,
with riflemen at their side, exposed waist-deep and dropping fast, but mowing
the open slope as with a scythe of steel. "I cannot," said a general officer,
who surveyed the whole scene, "adequately express my admiration for the British
who advanced, or for the Germans who stood up under such a heavy barrage to
oppose them." It was indeed that contest between the chosen children of Odin in
which Professor Cramb has declared that the high gods of virility might well
rejoice.</p>
<p>We will now turn to the left of the line and carry on the detailed
description of the general assault from that of the 56th Territorials in the
north, who were linked up by the defensive line of the Warwicks. The
Thirty-first Division was on the left of the Eighth Corps. Of this division,
two brigades, the 93rd and the 94th, were in the line, with the 92nd in
reserve. The 93rd, which consisted of the l0th, 16th, 18th West Yorks, and the
18th Durhams, was on the right, the 94th, including the 11th East Lancashires,
and the 12th, 13th, and 14th York and Lancasters, was on the left. The advance
was made upon a front of two companies, each company on a front of two
platoons, the men extended to three paces interval. On the left the leading
battalions were the 11th East Lancashires and 12th York and Lancasters, the
latter on the extreme left flank of the whole division. That this position with
its exposed flank was the place of honour and of danger, may be best indicated
by the fact that the of the colonel and six orderlies were the only men who
could be collected of this heroic Sheffield battalion upon the next morning. On
the right the leading troops were the 15th and 16th West Yorks. These grand
North-countrymen swept across No Man's Land, dressed as if on parade, followed
in succession by the remaining battalions, two of which, the 13th and 14th York
and Lancasters, were the special town units of Barnsley and Leeds. "I have
never seen and could not have imagined such a magnificent display of gallantry,
discipline, and determination," said the observer who was been already quoted.
The men fell in lines, but the survivors with backs bent, heads bowed, and
rifles at the port, neither quickened nor slackened their advance, but went
forward as though it was rain and not lead which lashed them. Here and
elsewhere the German machine-gunners not only lined the parapet, but actually
rushed forward into the open, partly to get a flank fire, and partly to come in
front of the British barrage. Before the blasts of bullets the fines melted
away, and the ever-decreasing waves only reached the parapet here and there,
lapping over the spot where the German front lines had been, and sinking for
ever upon the farther side. About a hundred gallant men of the East
Lancashires, favoured perhaps by some curve in the ground, got past more than
one fine of trenches, and a few desperate individuals even burst their way as
far as Serre, giving a false impression that the village was in our hands. But
the losses had been so heavy that the weight and momentum had gone out of the
attack, while the density of the resistance thickened with every yard of
advance. By the middle of the afternoon the survivors of the two attacking
brigades were back in their own front line trenches, having lost the greater
part of their effectives. The 15th West Yorks had lost heavily in officers, and
the 16th and 18th were little better off. The 18th Durhams suffered less, being
partly in reserve. Of the 94th Brigade the two splendid leading battalions, the
11th East Lancashires and 12th York and Lancasters, had very many killed within
the enemy line. The heaviest loss in any single unit was in the 11th East
Lancashires. The strength of the position is indicated by the fact that when
attacked by two divisions in November, with a very powerful backing of
artillery, it was still able to hold its own.</p>
<p>The experiences of all the troops engaged upon the left of the British
attack were so similar and their gallantry was so uniform, that any variety in
description depends rather upon the units engaged than upon what befell them.
Thus in passing from the Thirty-first Division to the Fourth upon their right,
the general sequence of cause and effect is still the same. In this instance
the infantry who rushed, or rather strode, to the assault were, counting from
the right, the 1st East Lanes, the 1st Rifle Brigade, and the 8th Warwicks, who
were immediately followed by the 1st Hants, the 1st Somersets, and the 6th
Warwicks, advancing with three companies in front and one in support. The
objective here as elsewhere upon the left was the capture of the
Serre-Grandcourt Ridge, with the further design of furnishing a defensive flank
for the operations lower down. The troops enumerated belonged to the 11th
Brigade, led by the gallant Prowse, who fell hit by a shell early in the
assault, calling after his troops that they should remember that they were the
Stonewall Brigade.</p>
<p>The attack was pressed with incredible resolution, and met with severe
losses. Again the front line was carried and again the thin fringe of survivors
had no weight to drive the assault forward, whilst they had no cover to shelter
them in the ruined lines which they had taken. The Somerset men had the honour
of reaching the farthest point attained by the division. "If anything wants
shifting the Somersets will do it." So said their General before the action.
But both their flanks were in the air, and their position was an impossible
one, while the right of the attack north of Beaumont Hamel had been entirely
held up. Two units of the 10th Brigade advanced about 9 o'clock on the right,
and two of the 12th on the left. These were in their order, the 2nd Dublins,
2nd Seaforths, 2nd Essex, and 1st King's Own Lancasters. All went forward with
a will, but some could not get beyond their own front trenches, and few got
over the German line. Ail the weight of their blood so lavishly and cheerfully
given could not tilt the scale towards victory. Slowly the survivors of the
Somersets and Rifle Brigade were beaten back with clouds of bombers at their
heels. The 8th Warwicks, who, with some of the 6th Warwicks, had got as far
forward as any of the supporting line, could not turn the tide. Late in the
afternoon the assault had definitely failed, and the remainder were back in
their own front trenches, which had now to be organised against the very
possible counter-attack. Only two battalions of the division remained intact,
and the losses included General Prowse, Colonel the Hon, C.W. Palk of the
Hampshires, Colonel Thicknesse of the Somersets, Colonel Wood of the Rifle
Brigade, and Colonel Franklin of the 6th Warwicks, all killed; while Colonels
Innes of the 8th Warwicks, Hopkinson of the Seaforths, and Green of the East
Lancashires were wounded. For a long time a portion of the enemy's trench was
held by mixed units, but it was of no value when detached from the rest and was
abandoned in the evening. From the afternoon onwards no possible course save
defence was open to General Lambton. There was considerable anxiety about one
company of Irish Fusiliers who were in a detached portion of the German trench,
but they succeeded in getting back next morning, bringing with them not only
their wounded but some prisoners.</p>
<p>Immediately to the right of the Fourth Division was the Twenty-ninth
Division* from Gallipoli, which rivalled in its constancy and exceeded in its
losses its comrades upon the left. The 86th Brigade and the 87th formed the
first line, with the 88th in support.</p>
<p class="footnote">[ * Since the constituents of this famous regular Division
have not been given in full (as has been done with their comrades in preceding
volumes) they are here enumerated as they were on July 1, 1916:<br>
<b>86th Brigade.</b>&mdash;2nd Royal Fusiliers, 1st Lancashire Fusiliers, 1st
Dublin Fusiliers, 16th Middlesex.<br>
<b>87th Brigade.</b>&mdash;1st Inniskilling Fusiliers, 1st South Wales
Borderers, 1st Scottish Borderers, 1st Border Regiment.<br>
<b>88th Brigade.</b>&mdash;1st Essex, 2nd Hants, 4th Worcesters, Newfoundland
Regiment. ]</p>
<p>The van of the attack upon the right of the division was formed by the 1st
Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Welsh Borderers, while the van upon the left was
formed by the 2nd Royal Fusiliers and the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers. The other
battalions of the brigades formed the supporting line, and two battalions of
the 88th Brigade, the Essex and the Newfoundlanders, were also drawn into the
fight, so that, as in the Fourth Division, only two battalions remained intact
at the close, the nucleus upon which in each case a new division had to be
formed.</p>
<p>Upon the explosion of the great mine already mentioned two platoons of the
2nd Royal Fusiliers with machine-guns and Stokes mortars rushed forward to
seize the crater. They got the near lip, but the enemy were already in
possession of the far side, and no farther advance could be made. At this
point, and indeed at nearly all points down the line, the wire was found to
have been very thoroughly cut by the artillery fire, but for some reason our
own wire had not been cut to the same extent and was a serious obstacle to our
own advance.</p>
<p>Parties of the leading regiments were speedily up to the German front-line
trench, but their advance beyond it was delayed by the fact that the dug-outs
were found to be full of lurking soldiers who had intended no doubt to rush out
and attack the stormers in the rear, as in the case of the Forty-sixth and
Fifty-sixth Divisions in the north, but who were discovered in time and had to
fight for their lives. These men were cleared out upon the right, and the
advance then made some progress, but on the left by 9 o'clock the 86th Brigade
had been completely held up by a murderous machine-gun fire in front of
Beaumont Hamel, a position which, as already explained, presented peculiar
difficulties. The Essex and Newfoundland men of the 88th Brigade were ordered
forward and charged with such splendid resolution that the advance was carried
forward again, and the whole situation changed for the better. By 10:15
casualties had become so great, however, through the fire of flanking
machine-guns, that it was clear that the attack could not possibly reach its
objective. The huge crater left by the explosion of the Beaumont Hamel mine was
held for hours as a redoubt, but it also was enfiladed by fire and became
untenable. By half-past ten the action had resolved itself into a bombardment
of the German front line once more, and the assault had definitely failed.
There was an attempt to renew it, but when it was found that the 86th Brigade
and the 87th Brigade were equally reduced in numbers, it was recognised that
only a defensive line could be held. It is true that the Divisional General had
the Worcesters and the Hants still in hand, and was prepared to attack with
them, but a further loss might have imperilled the Divisional line, so no
advance was allowed.</p>
<p>All the troops of the Twenty-ninth Division had lived up to their fame, but
a special word should be said of the Newfoundlanders, who, in their first
action, kept pace with the veterans beside them. This battalion of fishermen,
lumbermen, and farmers proved once more the grand stuff which is bred over the
sea&mdash;the stuff which Bernhardi dismissed in a contemptuous paragraph.
"They attacked regardless of loss, moving forward in extended order, wave
behind wave. It was a magnificent exhibition of disciplined courage." Well
might General Hunter -Weston say next day after visiting the survivors: "To
hear men cheering as they did, after undergoing such an experience, and in the
midst of such mud and rain, made one proud to have the command of such a
battalion." The losses of the Newfoundlanders were severe. Losses are always
the index of the sorrow elsewhere, but when they fall so heavily upon a small
community, where every man plays a vital part and knows his neighbour, they are
particularly distressing. From Cape Race to the coast of Labrador there was
pride and mourning over that day. The total losses of the division were heavy,
and included Colonels Pierce and Ellis of the Inniskillings and Borderers.</p>
<p>It must have been with a heavy heart that General Hunter-Weston realised,
with the approach of night, that each of his divisions had met with such losses
that the renewal of the attack was impossible. He, his Divisional Commanders,
his officers and his men had done both in their dispositions and in their
subsequent actions everything which wise leaders and brave soldiers could
possibly accomplish. If a criticism could be advanced it would be that the
attack was urged with such determined valour that it would not take No until
long after No was the inevitable answer. But grim persistence has won many a
fight, and no leader who is worthy to lead can ever have an excess of it. They
were up against the impossible, as were their companions to right and left. It
is easy to recognise it now, but it could not be proved until it had been
tested to the uttermost. Could other tactics, other equipment, other methods of
guarding the soldiers have brought them across the fatal open levels? It may be
so, and can again only be tried by testing. But this at least was proved for
all time, that, given clear ground, unshaken troops, prepared positions, and
ample artillery, no human fire and no human hardihood can ever hope to break
such a defensive line. It should be added that here as elsewhere the British
artillery, though less numerous than it became at a later date, was admirable
both in its heavy and in its lighter pieces. Observers have recorded that under
its hammer blows the German trenches kept momentarily changing their shape,
while the barrage was as thick and accurate and the lifting as well-timed as
could have been wished. There was no slackness anywhere, either in preparation
or in performance, and nothing but the absolute impossibility of the task under
existing conditions stood in the way of success.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III. THE
BATTLE OF THE SOMME<br>
Attack of the Tenth and Third Corps, July 1, 1916</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Magnificent conduct of the Ulster Division&mdash;Local
success but general failure&mdash;Advance of Thirty-second Division &mdash;
Advance of Eighth Division&mdash;Advance of Thirty-fourth Division &mdash; The
turning-point of the line</p>
<p class="first">MORLAND'S Tenth Corps consisted of the Thirty-sixth, Forty-
ninth, and Thirty-second Divisions. It lay between Hunter-Weston's Eighth Corps
upon the left and Pulteney's Third Corps upon the right. It covered a front
from a mile north of Hamel to a mile north of Ovillers. At its northern end it
was cut by the river Ancre, a sluggish canalised stream, running between two
artificial dykes which the Germans periodically cut by their artillery fire and
the British mended as best they might. This sector of attack, together with the
one farther south which faced the Third Corps, presented peculiar difficulties
to the assailants, as the ground sloped upward to the strong village of
Thiepval with the ridge behind it, from which German guns could sweep the whole
long glacis of approach. Nowhere were there more gallant efforts for a decision
and nowhere were they more hopeless.</p>
<p>The division to the north of the Tenth Corps was the Thirty-sixth Ulster
Division. This division was composed of magnificent material, for the blend of
Scot and Celt to be found in the North of Ireland produces a soldier who
combines the fire of the one with the solidity of the other. These qualities
have been brought to a finer temper by the atmosphere of opposition in which
they have lived, and the difficult economical circumstances which they have
overcome in so remarkable a way. Long ago in unhappy civil strife they had
shown their martial qualities, and now upon a nobler and wider stage they were
destined to confirm them. It might well seem invidious to give the palm to any
one of the bands of heroes who shed their blood like water on the slopes of
Picardy, but at least, all soldiers would agree that among them all there was
not one which could at its highest claim more than equality of achievement that
day with the men of Ulster.</p>
<p>The objective of this division was the German position from
Beaucourt-sur-Ancre on the north to the northern edge of Thiepval. When the
signal was given the two leading brigades, the 108th and the 107th, came away
at a deliberate pace which quickened into the rush of a released torrent, and
went roaring over the German trenches. "They were like bloodhounds off the
leash." Like every one else they were horribly scourged by shrapnel and
machine-fire as they rushed across, but whether it was that some curve in the
ground favoured part of their line, or whatever the cause, they suffered less
than the other divisions, and struck on to the German front line with their
full shattering momentum, going through it as though it were paper. The 108th
Brigade, Consisting of the 9th Irish Fusiliers and the 11th, 12th, and 13th
Irish Rifles, was on the left. The Two of these, the Fusiliers and one of the
Irish Rifle battalions, were on the north side of the Ancre, and were acting
rather with the Twenty-ninth Division upon their left than with their own
comrades on the right. This detachment fought all day side by side with the
regulars, made their way at one time right up to Beaucourt Station, and had
finally to retire to their own trenches together with the rest of the line
north of the Ancre. Next morning the survivors crossed the Ancre, and from then
onwards the Eighth Corps extended so as to take over this ground.</p>
<p>South of the Ancre the two remaining battalions of the 108th Brigade, and
the whole of the 107th Brigade, consisting of the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 15th
Irish Rifles, advanced upon a front of 3000 yards. The men had lost very
heavily in the assembly trenches, and two companies of the 10th Irish Rifles
had dwindled to two platoons before ever they got clear of the shattered wood
in which they gathered. None the less, the fire and fury of their onset was
terrific and sustained. "The place was covered with smoke and the explosion of
heavy shells," says one who saw the scene from a front observation post. "I
felt that no attack was possible, when suddenly out of the clouds I saw men
advancing as if on parade, quite slowly. It seemed impossible, and yet they
went on, stormed at on the left by high explosive and shrapnel, and on the
right by enfilade machine-gun fire. Suddenly they charged, and when I could
next see through the clouds on the slope (less than a mile away) I saw that
they had taken the front trench, and in another minute the trench behind was
taken, as our fellows shouting, 'No surrender!' got through&mdash;God knows
how! As they advanced the fire of the guns became more and more enfilade, but
nothing could stop their steady progress.</p>
<p>The long line of Irish Riflemen had rolled over every obstacle, and although
their dead and wounded lay thick behind them they still stormed forwards with
the same fury with which they started. Bunching up into platoons in artillery
formation they pushed on and carried the third line. Ahead of them, across a
considerable interval, was a fourth line, with a large redoubt upon the flank.
They steadied themselves for a few minutes, and then dashing onwards once again
they captured both the fourth line and the redoubt. So far forward were they
now that they had reached regions north of Thiepval which were never trodden by
a British foot again until three months of constant fighting had cleared a way
to them. It was the great Schwaben Redoubt which was now before them. The
reserve brigade, the 109th, consisting of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Inniskilling
Fusiliers, with the 14th Irish Rifles, had dashed forward at 10.40, leaving
only the pioneer battalion, the 16th Irish Rifles, to guard the trenches. With
the additional weight of the survivors of this reinforcing line the fringe of
stormers, for they were now a fringe and nothing more, again rushed forward and
threw themselves into the Schwaben trenches. This was their limit, and for most
of them their grave. They had no further supports, no ammunition could reach
them, and they were embedded in the depths of the German line at a point far
deeper than any unit upon the left of the line had attained. The village of
Thiepval commanded them from their right rear. Some remained in little groups,
huddling in some coign of vantage, and fighting to the last cartridge,
absolutely refusing to take one step to the rear. To the Germans they were as
dangerous as so many cornered wolves. Others fell back in orderly fashion, but
not an inch farther than was needful, for they held on all day to the frontage
taken by them. The first two lines were kept in their fierce grip till
nightfall of the next day, when they handed them over to the relieving
division.</p>
<p>In this splendid deed of arms the Thirty-sixth Division left half its number
upon the battlefield. The instances of gallantry were innumerable, and so
equally distributed that their General, when asked to name a special battalion,
could only answer that the whole twelve had done equally well. Had the
divisions to right and left been able to get as far, the whole gain would have
been permanent. As it was, 540 prisoners were brought in, and few were lost
save the wounded, chief of whom was Colonel Craig, who directed the movements
of his men long after he was unable to direct his own. Colonel Bernard of the
10th Rifles, Captain Davidson, who worked his machine-gun after his leg was
shattered, Captain Gaffikin, who died while leading his company with an orange
handkerchief waving in his hand, are but a few of the outstanding names. The
pressure upon the different brigades is indicated by the losses in officers of
the 107th, the 108th, and the 109th.</p>
<p>A very detailed account would be necessary to bring home to the reader the
full gallantry of this deed of arms. Experienced soldiers who saw it were moved
to the limit of human speech. "I wish I had been born an Ulsterman," cried one
of them. "But I am proud to have been associated with these wonderful men." To
have penetrated all alone for two miles into the German line, and to withdraw
from such a salient in military order, holding fast to all that could be
retained, was indeed a great feat for any troops to have performed. The requiem
for their fallen was best expressed by one of the survivors, who wrote that
"they died for the cause of Liberty, Honour, and Freedom, for the Old Flag, the
emblem of Britain, died for Ireland, died for Ulster!"</p>
<p>The Thirty-second Division was on the immediate right of the men of Ulster.
Their advance was carried out with the 96th Brigade on the left, the 97th upon
the right, and the 14th in support. The reader may be warned that from this
time onwards he will often find, as in this case, that old brigades have been
added to new formations, so that the former simplicity of numbering is often
disturbed. The storming lines went forward in each case with two battalions
abreast in front and two in succession in support. The front line of attack
taken from the north, or left, consisted of the 15th Lancashire Fusiliers, 16th
Northumberland Fusiliers, and the 16th and 17th Highland Light Infantry. Of
these four battalions the 16th Northumberland Fusiliers came under very heavy
fire, and were unable to press their attack home. On the right the Highlanders
had crawled up to within a hundred yards of the Leipzig salient and were into
it with a rush the moment that the barrage lifted. The 15th Lancashire
Fusiliers upon the left made a particularly brilliant advance. The right
company was held up in front of Thiepval village, but the left company swept on
with the Thirty-sixth Division, keeping pace with their magnificent advance. It
appears to have reached the east end of Thiepval, but there it was buried
deeply in the enemy's position and was never heard of again. The supporting
battalions of the 96th Brigade, the 16th Lancashire Fusiliers and the 2nd
Inniskilling Fusiliers, tried hard to regain touch with their lost comrades,
but in vain. These various gallant bodies who, at different points of our line,
pushed forward into impossible positions, were no doubt for the greater part
killed or wounded, but from among them came the 850 prisoners whom the Germans
claimed to have taken on the northern part of the line on that day. The left of
the divisional line was so weakened by these losses that they were compelled to
withdraw to their own front trenches.</p>
<p>On the right, however, the Highlanders were able to hold on to a part of the
Leipzig salient. The losses, however, upon this flank had been very heavy, not
only in the front wave, but among the 1st Dorsets and the 11th Borders as they
came out from a wood in support. Coming under a concentrated fire of
machine-guns, these two battalions suffered heavily. Colonel Machell, gallantly
leading his Borders, was shot dead, his adjutant. Lieutenant Gordon, was badly
wounded as he stooped over his body, Major Diggle was wounded, and the greater
number of the officers were on the ground. Colonel Machell, it may be remarked,
was a high civil official of the Egyptian Government, Under-Secretary for the
Interior, whose patriotism had led him to join the New Armies and thus to meet
his death upon the field of battle. The 1st Dorsets lost nearly as heavily as
the men of the Border; their leader. Major Shute, was disabled, and their ranks
thrown into temporary confusion. They were splendidly rallied, however, by the
adjutant, who led them on and succeeded with the survivors in reaching the
Leipzig Redoubt. Colonel Laidlaw, of the 16th Highland Light Infantry, of the
had also been wounded, the third commanding officer killed or injured on this
wing of the attack.</p>
<p>There had been no flinching anywhere, and the military virtue shown had been
of the highest possible quality; but the losses from the machine-guns and from
the barrage were so heavy that they deprived the attack of the weight and
momentum necessary to win their way through the enemy's position. Under the
desperate circumstances, it might well be considered a remarkable result that a
stretch of the Leipzig Redoubt should be won and permanently held by the
Highlanders, especially by the 17th Highland Light Infantry. The sappers had
prepared a Russian sap running up to the enemy line, and this was invaluable as
a communication trench. On the 2nd and 3rd the enemy endeavoured to turn out
the intruders, but the 2nd Manchesters and 15th Highland Light Infantry not
only held their ground, but enlarged it. On the night of the 3rd the division
was relieved by the Twenty-fifth Division and withdrew to refit after its
tragic but splendid exertions.</p>
<p>Out of the novel conditions of what may be called Bloch warfare certain
rules and axioms are slowly evolving. That it is impossible without artificial
protection to attack over the open against an unshaken enemy provided with
machine-guns is the most certain. But there is another which might be
formulated thus: If there are sharp salients in the enemy line, either these
salients must be taken first or the attack must be made out of range of them,
otherwise their guns must flank the whole advance. Very many examples might be
quoted where the disregard of this axiom has brought disaster to either side. A
conspicuous case would be that of the Third Corps now to be described, where
the sinister salient of Thiepval protruded to the north, and a smaller but very
efficient one to the south, so that the whole advance was conducted under the
fire of two lines of guns which raked it from end to end. In addition the
opposing infantry included a division of the Prussian Guard. In the whole long
position there would appear to be no sector where there was less prospect of
success, and yet there was no sector where it was more essential to hold the
enemy fast, since victory might await us to the immediate south.</p>
<p>The Third Corps, under General Pulteney, occupied the front immediately to
the east of Albert. This large town was almost exactly in the centre of its
rear, and the important road from Albert to Bapaume bisected the British
position. Ovillers to the north, within the German fines, and B&eacute;court to
the south, in the British, marked roughly the two ends of the sector. It was a
comparatively narrow stretch, so that only two divisions were in the firing
fine, and one in reserve. These were respectively the Eighth Regular Division
to the north, the Thirty-fourth of the New Army to the south, and the
Nineteenth, also of the New Army, in support.</p>
<p>Had the Thirty-second Division succeeded in holding its grip upon Thiepval
upon the north, there might have been some chance of success, but as it was,
the machine-guns from that quarter shaved the whole of No Man's Land as a mower
may shave a lawn, and after the first rush, which carried the brave fellows of
the Eighth Division over the trenches, it proved to be absolutely impossible to
send them either supports or supplies. The main body of this magnificent
division disappeared into the smoke and haze of the battle, and their comrades
in the trenches waited with aching hearts, their eyes fixed upon their front
where the roar of battle rose from the other side of the pelting sleet of
bullets. All day they waited, dashing out occasionally and being beaten back
with ever-dwindling numbers. After dusk, they searched the shell-holes and
brought in some 400 wounded. A few bewildered men came staggering in during the
night, half-delirious with fatigue and strain, and unable themselves to say how
they had got back across the enemy's front line from the depths to which they
had penetrated.</p>
<p>This tragic but heroic attack in which the whole force who went forward
fought literally to the death, was carried out in the following order:</p>
<p>On the right was the 23rd Brigade; in the centre the 25th; and on the left
the 70th. The 23rd and 25th were the old hard-working units of Neuve Chapelle
and many another fray. The 70th was a particularly fine brigade of the New
Army. This division had up to the last moment been without a pioneer battalion,
but the infantry had dug themselves particularly good assembly and
communication trenches, which helped them much upon the day of battle. They had
also, under the direction of the Commander of Divisional sappers, run two
covered ways up to the enemy's trenches which might have been a vital factor in
the day's work, had it not been that the stormers pushed on, leaving it to
others to secure their gains. The result was that the advancing infantry passed
rather than occupied the front trenches, the barrage cut off supports, the
enemy emerged from their dug-outs, and the line still remained under their
control, forbidding the use or even the disclosure of the covered ways, since
men could not emerge in single file in an enemy trench.</p>
<p>Following the plan of describing operations always from the north, we will
first picture from such reliable material as is available the attack of the
70th Brigade, which contained some of the finest North-country stuff that ever
fought the battles of the country. This brigade was separated on the north by a
clear space of about 300 yards from the Highland Light Infantry of the 97th
Brigade, who formed the extreme right of the Thirty-second Division. The 8th
York and Lancaster was the flank battalion, with the 8th Yorkshire Light
Infantry upon its right. The 9th York and Lancaster were behind their comrades,
and the 11th Sherwood Foresters behind the Light Infantry.</p>
<p>As it is impossible to give with any fulness the story of any one regiment,
and as each may be taken as typical of the others, we may follow the front
flank battalion on its advance. This, the 8th York and Lancaster, consisted
almost entirely of miners, a class of men who have furnished grand military
material to the New Armies. This unit came chiefly from the Rotherham district.
The frontage of the battalion was 750 yards.</p>
<p>As the hour of attack approached, the enemy's counter-bombardment became so
violent that there was the utmost difficulty in getting the men into the
front-line trenches. Many were killed and even buried before the advance had
begun. When the whistles blew the stormers went forward in four waves with 50
yards between, the supporting battalions following instantly. The machine-guns
were sweeping the ground and about 350 yards had to be covered between the
lines. Officers and men went down in heaps under the enfilade fire from four
lines of guns, one behind the other, in the Thiepval district. The approach was
over a billiard-table glacis with no cover of any kind. The ranks kept
formation and trudged steadily forward, throwing themselves headlong into the
front German trenches. There they steadied themselves for a few minutes, and
then advancing once more sprang down into the second German line which was
strongly held. Colonel Maddison had been shot down early in the attack. Captain
Dawson, the adjutant, had been wounded, but staggered on with the men until he
was killed at the second line of trenches. "Come on, boys! let's get at 'em and
clear 'em out!" were his last words. On this second line the battalion,
together with its support, beat itself to pieces. A few survivors unable to get
back were taken prisoners, and a German report has stated that they were very
proud and defiant when marched away. At night a number of wounded were carried
in along the whole divisional front from No Man's Land, but many lives were
lost in the gallant work, and many of the wounded also lost their lives in
trying to crawl back, for the Germans turned their machine-guns during the
daytime upon everything that moved in front of their lines.</p>
<p>To show how uniform was the experience, one may quote the doings of a
battalion of the 23rd Brigade. This brigade was on the right of the Eighth
Division line, and the 2nd Middlesex, the battalion in question, formed the
right battalion joining on with the Tyneside Scottish of the Thirty-fourth
Division to the south. Upon its left was the 2nd Devons. The supporting troops,
two companies of the 2nd West Yorkshires and the 2nd Scottish Rifles, seem to
have been held back when it was seen how fatal was the advance, and so in part
escaped from the catastrophe. The Middlesex advanced almost opposite to La
Boiselle. There was a slight dip in the ground to the immediate front which
formed a partial protection from the machine-guns, so that although the losses
were very heavy, about 300 men with six Lewis guns made good their footing in
the German front-line trench. Their gallant commander was wounded twice, but
still kept at their head while they swept onwards to the second line. It was
stuffed with Germans, but the handful of British stormers flung themselves in
among them and cleared a standing place in the trench. The German guns,
however, had the exact range, and four out of the six Lewis guns were blown
into the air. Finally, only five men and a sergeant were left unwounded in this
trench. This handful made its way back. One hundred and thirty of the Middlesex
men seem to have got through or round on to the Pozi&egrave;res road, but their
fate was never cleared up. Finally, only 30 men of this grand battalion
answered the roll-call that night.</p>
<p>The space between the two attacks described from the point of view of the
two wing battalions of the division was occupied by the 25th Brigade, whose
advance and losses were exactly similar to those which have been narrated. The
2nd Lincolns and 2nd Berkshires were the leading battalions, and their devotion
in attempting the impossible was as great as that of their comrades to right
and left.</p>
<p>Both regiments suffered heavily, and it is probable that the Berkshires went
deeper than any other. The 1st Irish Rifles had occupied the trenches for six
days in dreadful weather, and had suffered heavily from the retaliatory
bombardment of the Germans. They were therefore held in reserve, but none the
less made repeated efforts and with great loss to cross the barrage and help
their comrades, for which they afterwards received a special message of thanks
from the Divisional Commander.</p>
<p>Up to this point the writer has been faced by the painful and monotonous
task of one long record of failure from Gommecourt in the north to La Boiselle
in the south. It cannot be doubted that we had over-estimated the effects of
our bombardment, and that the German guns were intact to a degree which was
unexpected. Our one consolation must be that the German reserves were held in
their position, and that improved prospects were assured for the remainder of
the British line and for the whole of the French line. Had the front of the
battle covered only the region which has been treated up to now, the episode
would have been a tragic one in British military history. Thousands of men had
fallen, nor could it be truthfully said that anything of permanence had been
achieved. Next day the remains of the Eighth Division were withdrawn, the 70th
Brigade was restored to the Twenty-third Division, to which it rightfully
belonged, and the Twelfth Division came forward to fill the gap in the line,
helped by the gunners and sappers of the Eighth, who remained at their posts
until July 4.</p>
<p>On the right of the Eighth Division was the Thirty-fourth, a unit which
consisted of one mixed The English and Scotch Brigade; while the other two were
raised respectively from the Tyneside Irish and from the Tyneside Scots, hardy
and martial material from the coal pits and foundries of the North. They
attacked upon the front between the Albert-Bapaume road on the north and the
village of B&eacute;court on the south. The idea was to storm La Boiselle
village, and to push the attack home both north and south of it upon
Contalmaison, which lay behind it. Immediately before the assault two great
mines were blown, one of which, containing the unprecedented amount of 60,000
lbs. of gun-cotton, threw hundreds of tons of chalk into the air. Within a few
minutes of the explosion the Thirty-fourth Division were out of their trenches
and advancing in perfect order upon the German trenches. The 101st Brigade,
consisting of the 15th and 16th Royal Scots, the 10th Lincolns, and 11th
Suffolks, were on the right, the Tyneside Scots upon the left, and the Tyneside
Irish in support behind the right brigade. In the immediate rear lay the
Nineteenth Division with instructions to hold and consolidate the ground
gained.</p>
<p>In no part of the line was the advance more gallant, and it marks the point
at which unalloyed failure began first to change to partial success, ripening
into complete victory in the southern section. Some slight cover seems to have
helped the troops for the first few hundred yards, and it would appear also
that though the small-arm fire was very severe, the actual shell-fire was not
so heavy as that which devastated the divisions in the north. None the less,
the obstacles were sufficient to test to the highest any troops in the world,
and they were gloriously surmounted by men, none of whom had been in action
before.</p>
<p>"I, their commander," wrote the Divisional General, "will never forget their
advance through the German curtain of fire. It was simply wonderful, and they
behaved like veterans." The scream of the war-pipes, playing "The Campbells are
coming," warmed the blood of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Upon the left, the Tyneside Scots penetrated two lines of trenches and found
themselves to the north of the village of La Boiselle, where further progress
was made impossible by a murderous fire from front and flank. Of the four
battalions of the 101st Brigade, the two English units were nearly opposite the
village, and though they advanced with great resolution, they were unable to
get a permanent lodgment. The two Royal Scots battalions upon the flank got
splendidly forward, and some of them made their way deeper into the German line
than any organised body of troops, save only the Ulster men, had succeeded in
doing, getting even as far as the outskirts of Contalmaison. The valiant leader
of the advanced party of the 15th Royal Scots was wounded, but continued to
encourage his men and to try to consolidate his desperate position, which was
nearly a mile within the German lines. He was again severely wounded, and
Lieutenant Hole was killed, upon which the only remaining officer fell back to
a point some hundreds of yards westward, called Round Wood or Round Alley. Here
the Scots stuck fast, and nothing could budge them. Germans were in front of
them, were in La Boiselle upon their left rear, and were behind them in the
trenches, which led from the village. By all the laws of war, the detachment
was destroyed; but in practice the Germans found that they could not achieve
it. A small reinforcement of the 27th Northumberland Fusiliers (from the 103rd
of the Brigade), under an experienced soldier, had joined them, and their
situation was less forlorn because they were in slight touch with the skirts of
the 64th Brigade of the Twenty-first Division, who had also, as will presently
be shown, won a very forward position. By means of this division communication
was restored with the isolated detachment, and the colonel of the 16th Royal
Scots, a very well-known volunteer officer of Edinburgh, succeeded in reaching
his men. His advent gave them fresh spirit, and under his leadership they
proceeded next morning not only to hold the position, but to enlarge it
considerably, sending bombers down every sap and endeavouring to give the
impression of great numbers. Two companies of the East Lancashire Regiment from
the Nineteenth Division made their way forward, and joined with effect in these
attacks. This small body of men held their own until the afternoon of July 3,
when the advance of the Nineteenth Division upon La Boiselle enabled them to be
relieved. It was time, for the water was exhausted and munitions were running
low. It was a glad moment when, with their numerous German captives, they
joined up with their cheering comrades. It should be said that in this fine
feat of arms a small party of the 11th Suffolks played a valiant part. General
Pulteney issued a special order thanking these troops for their stout defence,
and the matter was in truth of wider importance than any local issue, for it
had the effect of screening the left flank of the Twenty-first Division,
enabling them to make good their hold upon Crucifix Trench and the Sunken Road,
as will now be told.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Thirty-fourth Division it should be said that although La
Boiselle remained untaken, the Tyneside Scots and Irish carried a number of
trenches and returned with many prisoners. It has been the universal experience
of our soldiers that the Germans, though excellent with their guns, and very
handy with their bombs, are wanting in that spice of devilry called for in
bayonet work&mdash;a quality which their ally the Turk possesses to a marked
degree. In this instance, as in many others, when the Tyneside men swept
roaring into the trenches the Germans either fled or threw up their hands. The
condition of the prisoners was unexpectedly good. "They have new uniforms, new
brown boots, leggings, and are as fat as butter," said one spectator, which is
at great variance with descriptions from other parts of the line.</p>
<p>We have now completed our survey of that long stretch of line in which our
gallant advance was broken against an equally gallant resistance. The account
has necessarily had to concern itself with incessant details of units and
orders of battle, since these are the very essence of such an account, and
without them it might read, as contemporary descriptions did read, like some
vague combat in the moon. But, casting such details aside, the reader can now
glance up that long line and see the wreckage of that heroic disaster &mdash;
the greatest and also the most glorious that ever befell our arms.</p>

OF THE SOMME<br>
The Attack of the Fifteenth and Thirteenth Corps, July 1, 1916</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">The advance of the Twenty-first Division&mdash;Of the 64th
Brigade&mdash;First permanent gains&mdash;50th Brigade at Fricourt
&mdash;Advance of Seventh Division&mdash;Capture of Mametz&mdash;Fine work by
Eighteenth Division&mdash;Capture of Montauban by the Thirtieth
Division&mdash;General view of the battle&mdash;Its decisive importance</p>
<p class="first">IMMEDIATELY to the south of Pulteney's Third Corps, and
extending from B&eacute;court in the north to a point opposite Fricourt
village, lay Horne's Fifteenth Corps. The general task of this Corps was to
attack Mametz on the right, contain Fricourt in the centre, and attack between
there and La Boiselle towards Mametz Wood. It consisted of the Twenty-first,
the Seventh, and the Seventeenth Divisions. Of these, the most northerly was
the Twenty-first, that fine North-country division which had so terrible an
ordeal when it came up in support upon the second day of Loos. Those who held
that in spite of defeat its conduct upon that occasion was soldierly, were
borne out by its achievement on the Somme, where it made a lodgment in the
enemy's line upon the first day, and did good service at later stages of the
battle. Let us now turn our attention to its advance. It may first be mentioned
that the units were the same as those enumerated in the description of Loos,
save that in each brigade one regular battalion had been substituted. Thus the
1st Lincolns, 4th Middlesex, and 1st East Yorks took the place of the 8th East
Yorks, 12th West Yorks, and 14th Durhams respectively. The 50th Brigade of the
Seventeenth Division was attached to the Twenty-first Division for the purpose
of the attack, and will be included with it in this summary of the operations.
The rest of the Seventeenth Division was in reserve.</p>
<p>The attack was on a three-brigade front, the 64th Brigade upon the north,
just south of La Boiselle, and in close touch with the Thirty-fourth Division.
To the right of the 64th was the 63rd Brigade, and to the right of that the
50th, which advanced straight upon Fricourt. The 62nd Brigade was in reserve.
It will be best to deal with the attack of the 64th Brigade with some detail,
as its exploits had a very direct bearing upon the issue of the battle.</p>
<p>This brigade advanced upon the signal with the 10th Yorkshire Light Infantry
upon the left in touch with the Royal Scots of the 101st Brigade. On their
right was their 9th namesake battalion. Behind them in immediate support were
the 1st East Yorks (left) and 15th Durhams (right). The advance was greatly
helped by the formation of a Russian sap between the lines on which the front
companies could assemble. It was found, however, upon the men advancing that
the fire was so severe that they could only get forward by crawling from hole
to hole, with the result that the barrage lifted before they could reach, the
front trenches, and the Germans were able to mount the parapet and slate them
with rifle-fire. Colonel Lynch of the 9th Yorkshire Light Infantry was killed
by a shell between trenches, as were all four captains, but the men stuck to
their work and finally the leading battalions swept over the German lines,
which had been greatly disorganised by the artillery, and they killed or
captured the occupants with no very severe resistance. Two fixed points lay in
front of the brigade, which were part of the definite objectives of the
division. The first was a sunken road 1100 yards from the British front, the
second was a trench 400 yards farther, on which, by the irony of Fate, a large
wayside crucifix looked down, so that it was called Crucifix Trench. Beyond
these on the left front were several shattered woods. Shelter Wood and
Birch-tree Wood, which gave the enemy good cover, and to the right was a large
ruined building, Fricourt Farm, which raked the advance with its snipers and
machine-guns.</p>
<p>On passing the front German line the successive British waves lost their
formation and clubbed together, so that a long loose line of Yorkshire and
Durham men scrambled onwards into, out of and over the successive impediments,
beating down all resistance as they went. When the fire became too hot, the men
crawled forwards upon their stomachs or made short sharp rushes from one
shell-hole to another, but the advance was steady and unbroken. The smoke from
the shells was as dense as a Scotch mist. Every now and then through the haze
the flashes of a machine-gun would be spied and possibly the vague figures of
the German gunners as they swept it across in their deadly traverse, but a rush
of furious infantry put each in turn out of action. The evidence seems to be
conclusive that some at least of these gunners were found to be chained to
their guns, which may well have happened at their own request, as a visible
proof that they would never desert their post. They fired up to the last
instant, and naturally they received no quarter from the stormers. Now and
again the ragged line of men would stumble suddenly upon a section of proper
trench, would spring down into it, clear up the occupants, and then sit in
flushed, hard-breathing groups until a whistle from the officer and a cheer
from their comrades would call them on once more.</p>
<p>In this sector there appears, however, to have been a systematic, if
superficial, examination of the dug-outs before a trench was passed. One does
not hear of those surprise attacks from the rear which were so common and so
fatal to the north. The examination usually took the form of a sharp summons at
the mouth of the burrow, quickly followed&mdash;if there were no
response&mdash;by a Mills bomb. Then, as often as not, there would crawl out of
the black orifice eight or ten terrified and bleeding men, who would join the
numerous small convoys trailing backwards to the rear. These prisoners were
nearly all from the 110th and 111th Reserve Bavarian Regiments, and the
alacrity with which they made for the rear with their hands above their heads,
formed the only comic touch in a tragic day. One made a grab for a rifle. "He
lived about five seconds," says the narrator. "They were thin, unshaven, and
terrified," says an officer, talking of the particular batch he handled. "Most
had dark hair&mdash;a very different type from the Prussians."</p>
<p>Having overrun the German trenches, the infantry were now faced with a
considerable stretch of open which lay between them and the Sunken Road,
leading from Fricourt to Contalmaison. Many were hit upon this perilous
passage. A subsidiary line of German trenches lay in front of this road, and
into this the British tumbled. The colonel of the 15th Durhams was the senior
officer who had got up, and he took command at this point, rallying the weary
men of all four battalions for a fresh advance. A few of the Royal Scots of the
Thirty-fourth Division were found already in possession, the fringe of that
body who have previously been described as making so invaluable a stand at
Round Wood.</p>
<p>At this point the 64th Brigade was found to be some distance in front of the
main body of the Thirty-fourth Division on the left, and of their comrades on
the right, so that they could get no farther for the moment without their
flanks being badly exposed. In front through the haze they could dimly see the
Crucifix which was their ultimate objective. The men had to cower low, for the
bullets were coming in a continuous stream from Fricourt Farm on the right and
from the woods on the left. The Sunken Road was ten or twelve feet deep at the
spot, and though it was exposed at the sides, by rapid digging the men got some
cover, though many dropped before they could make a shelter. Here the survivors
of the advance waited for some hours, spending some of the time in ransacking
the enormous thirty-foot deep dug-outs which the Germans had excavated at
certain points along the side of the road. Into these the wounded were
conveyed, and refreshed by the good things of life, from Seltzer-water to
gold-tipped cigarettes, which were found within.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the General Officer Commanding had come up as far as the
Sunken Road, and had examined the position for himself. The 63rd Brigade was
now well forward upon the right and the advance could be resumed. It was pushed
swiftly onwards and Crucifix Trench was occupied, nearly a mile from the
British front line. A lieutenant of the 9th Yorkshires, though wounded by
shrapnel, seems to have been the first to lead a party into this advanced
trench, but soon it was strongly occupied. The pressing need was to consolidate
it, for it was swept by gusts of fire from both flanks. Another lieutenant of
the Yorkshires, also a wounded man, took over the direction, and the men, with
very little cover, worked splendidly to strengthen the position. Their numbers
were so reduced that a counter-attack would have been most serious, but the
splendid support given by the artillery held the German infantry at a distance.
A few of the British tried to advance upon Shelter Wood, but the machine-guns
were too active and they had to fall back or lie in shell-holes until after
dark, only seventeen out of sixty getting back.</p>
<p>A captain of the 10th Yorkshires took over the advanced command and sent
back to the colonel of the Durhams, who had meantime been wounded at the Sunken
Road, to ask for instructions. The answer was to hold on and that help was at
hand. This help was in the form of the 62nd Reserve Brigade, the leading
battalions of which, the 1st Lincolns and 10th Yorkshire Regiment, came
swinging splendidly across the open and flung themselves into Crucifix Trench.
From that time the maintenance of the ground was assured. The men of the 64th
Brigade who had done so finely were drawn back into the Sunken Road, having
fully secured their objective. One cannot but marvel here, as so often
elsewhere, at the fine work done by young subalterns when the senior officers
have been disabled. A lieutenant of the 9th Yorkshire Light Infantry found
himself in command of the whole battalion at the most critical moment of the
engagement, and on leaving could only hand it over to a brother subaltern, who
carried on with equal courage and ability. The brigade was drawn back to the
German first line, where it lay for forty-eight hours, and finally acted as
reserve brigade to the successful advance undertaken by the 62nd Brigade, by
which Shelter Wood was captured on July 3.</p>
<p>Such, in some detail, were the adventures of the 64th Brigade, which may be
taken as parallel to those of the 63rd upon the right, who were faced by much
the same obstacles, having the Sunken Road ahead and the Fricourt houses upon
their right. The 8th Somersets were on the left in touch with the 9th Yorkshire
Light Infantry, and supported by the 8th Lincolns. On the right were the 4th
Middlesex and the 10th York and Lancasters. They were able to get well up to
Fricourt Farm upon the left of the village, but the ground was unfavourable and
they never got as far forward as their comrades on the left. Of the German
resistance on this front, it can be said that it was worthy of the reputation
which the Bavarians have won in the War. The men were of splendid physique and
full of courage. They fought their machine-guns to the last. All was ready for
a vigorous advance next morning. The artillery of the Twenty-first Division,
which has won a name for exceptional efficiency, was up nearly level with the
infantry at 10 P.M. that night, a road having been laid in that time from the
original gun position to a point half a mile inside the German front line.</p>
<p>On the immediate right of the 63rd Brigade, in front of Fricourt, was the
50th Brigade (Glasgow), to which was assigned the task of attacking the village
while the Twenty-first Division got part of it upon the north. The brigade
advanced gallantly, the front line consisting of two fine Yorkshire battalions,
the 10th West Yorks and the 7th East Yorks, with part of the 7th Yorkshires.
The attack reached and partly occupied the front trenches, but the fire and the
losses were both very heavy, the 10th West Yorkshires being specially hard hit.
The survivors behaved with great gallantry, and some of them held on all day,
though surrounded by enemies. In the afternoon a second advance was made by
Yorkshires and East Yorkshires, with 6th Dorsets in support, but again the
losses were heavy and no solid foothold could be got in the village. When dusk
fell some of the troops who had held their own all day were able to get back to
the British trenches bringing prisoners with them. A notable example is that of
a lieutenant of the West Yorks, who managed to stagger back with three wounds
upon him and three Germans in front of him. The 51st Brigade was brought up in
the evening to continue the assault, but with the morning of the 2nd it was
found that the work had been done, and that the advance upon both flanks had
caused the evacuation of the village.</p>
<p>The line of trenches takes a very peculiar turn just south of Fricourt,
which is shown in the diagram of the battle, so that the attack of the Seventh
Division, which was the next in the line, was from almost due south, whilst all
the others had been from due west. The project was that a holding attack to
engage the defenders should be made upon Mametz, whilst the remaining divisions
in the line, the Seventh of the Fifteenth Corps, with the Eighteenth and
Thirtieth of the Thirteenth Corps, should advance upon the line
Mametz-Montauban. Their success would obviously make the position both of
Fricourt and of Mametz impossible, the more so if the Twenty-first Division
could maintain its position at the Sunken Road to the north of Fricourt. This
was the calculation, and it worked to perfection, so that both these villages
fell eventually into our hands with a minimum loss of life to the assailants.
Every honour is due to the leaders who devised and to the soldiers who carried
out the scheme, but it should at the same time be understood that in the case
of these southern divisions, and also of the French Army of General Foch upon
the right, they were attacking a portion of the line which was far less
organised, and manned by very inferior troops to those in the north. All this
section of attack seems to have been a complete surprise to the Germans.</p>
<p>The famous Seventh Division was now commanded by one of the three Brigadiers
who had led it during its heroic days at Ypres. Its units, however, had changed
considerably, and the 91st Brigade had taken the place of the 21st. This
Brigade, consisting partly of Manchester battalions and partly of old units of
the Seventh Division (2nd Queen's Surrey, 1st South Staffords, 21st and 22nd
Manchesters), attacked upon the right, while the 20th Brigade advanced upon the
left, having the 2nd Gordons and 9th Devons in the van, with the 8th Devons and
2nd Borders in support. The front trenches were overrun without much
difficulty. The order of battle was the 22nd Manchesters upon the right with
the 1st South Staffords in close support. In the centre were the 2nd Gordons
and upon their left the 9th Devons. The right got forward with comparatively
small losses and overran the front German line. The Gordons had their left
company held up by uncut wire, but got forward none the less with considerable
losses. The 9th Devons were the most exposed and suffered very severely, but in
spite of a casualty list which included half the officers and men, they never
winced or wavered for an instant, showing what had been often shown before,
that the spirit of old days still lives in the country of Drake and of Raleigh.
The survivors seized and held Tirpitz Trench. The 2nd Borders had also seized
Danube Support, and the whole front line was in British hands.</p>
<p>The 91st Brigade were now closing in upon the right of Mametz village and
had entered Danzig Alley, from which they were for a time driven by a brisk
counter-attack. The 1st South Staffords had won their way into the outskirts of
Mametz, but the losses were heavy, and half of the 21st Manchesters came racing
up to reinforce. At one o'clock the Danzig Alley had again been occupied by the
Manchesters. Half the 2nd Warwicks were sent up to reinforce the Gordons and
the line of infantry dashed forward upon the village, 600 of the enemy throwing
up their hands in front of them. The 20th Manchesters also advanced, losing
heavily by the fire from Fricourt, but pushing on as far as the Sunken Road on
the extreme left of the advance. There is a tangle of trenches at this point,
the chief of which is the Rectangle, but with the aid of the 1st Welsh
Fusiliers they were all cleared and the flank of the Division made good, and
consolidated, since it had advanced farther than the troops to the left. In the
morning however, when it was found that Fricourt had been evacuated, the whole
division was able to get forward and by July 3 had occupied Bottom Wood, while
the 2nd Royal Irish had actually penetrated Mametz Wood, taking 2 guns and 50
prisoners. Some days later, Mametz Wood had become a different proposition, but
the general orders at the time were that it should not be seriously attacked.
Altogether in these Mametz operations the Seventh Division took 1500 prisoners,
seven field-guns, and much booty of different kinds.</p>
<p>We have now recorded in succession the repulse of the Seventh Corps at
Gommecourt, that of the Eighth Corps at Serre and Beaumont Hamel, and that of
the Tenth Corps at Thiepval. The record of heroic disaster was then alleviated
by the partial success of the Third Corps at La Boiselle, the considerable
success of the Fifteenth Corps at Mametz, and now by the complete success of
the Thirteenth Corps at Montauban. South of this point along the whole French
line the victory was never in doubt. These latter operations do not come within
the direct scope of this narrative, though some short account must be given of
them later, in order to co-ordinate the results of the two wings of the Allied
Armies.</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Corps was commanded by General Congreve, who, it will be
remembered, gained his V.C. in the affair of the guns where young Roberts met
his death at Colenso. It consisted of the Eighteenth, the Thirtieth, and the
Ninth Divisions of the New Army. Of these the Eighteenth was on the left in
touch with the victorious Seventh, the Thirtieth was on the right in touch with
the French, and the Ninth, the Scottish Division which had done such great work
at Loos, was in reserve.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth Division, which had done no serious fighting before,
established a remarkable record for good service during the whole course of the
Somme battle, into which it was thrust again and again, never without leaving
its mark. It was entirely an English division. Some complex and successful
trench-digging had been done on this part of the front. Eight covered saps had
been driven forward and reached a point within twenty yards of the German
trenches without their knowledge. Upon the advance being ordered the ends of
these were opened up, machine-guns and flame-throwers were thrust through, and
the saps behind were quickly unroofed and turned into communication trenches.
It was a variant of the device adopted in the Eighth Division, and was superior
to it in that its success did not depend upon the actual capture of the
trench.</p>
<p>The front of the attack was about 2500 yards, and it was carried out by
three brigades abreast, each covering about 700 yards. Each brigade had two
battalions in front, one in support and one in reserve. Each was also allotted
its own particular artillery apart from the general divisional artillery. There
are many good arguments for such a formation of divisional attack, as compared
with the two-brigades-in-front and one-in-the-rear formation. Upon this
occasion, at any rate, it worked very smoothly. The objectives were from the
immediate western end of Montauban upon the right, along Montauban Alley to a
point east of Mametz where they should touch the right units of the Seventh
Division.</p>
<p>Of the three brigades the 55th was on the right, the 53rd in the centre, and
the 54th on the left. In accordance with the general scheme of description we
will begin with the latter.</p>
<p>The 54th Brigade had the 7th Bedford on the right, the 11th Royal Fusiliers
on the left, the 6th Northants in support, and the 12th Middlesex in reserve.
As they rushed forward they faced a feeble barrage, but a heavy machine-gun
fire. It was found, however, here, and along the whole divisional front, that
the German wire was utterly destroyed, thanks largely to the work of the trench
mortars which had supplanted field-guns for this particular purpose. The first
trenches were taken without a pause, and parties remained behind to clear out
the dug-outs.</p>
<p>"Cowering in the trench," says one of the stormers, "clad in the pale grey
uniforms we had longed for twelve months to see, unarmed and minus equipment,
with fear written on their faces, were a few of those valiant warriors of the
Kaiser whose prowess we were out to dispute. Here let me say that the exact
moment selected for our attack had taken the Huns by surprise. This view was
subsequently confirmed by prisoners, who said that they had expected us earlier
in the day and had since stood down." This idea of a surprise only refers of
course to the front trench. Soon the fighting grew very severe.</p>
<p>The first serious check was in front of a strong point called the Pommiers
Redoubt. The wire here had been invisible from long grass so that its presence
was a surprise. Again and again the machine-guns swept away the leading files
of the attack. The redoubt could be outflanked, however, and an officer of the
Fusiliers brought his bombers round and eventually to the rear of it. Snipers
held him for a time, but they were rushed by an officer and a few men. The
Germans still held bravely to their point, but Bedfords and Fusiliers swarmed
in upon them until their arms went down and their hands up. From this strong
point bombing parties were sent down the communication trenches, the infantry
following closely and occupying the new ground.</p>
<p>The brigade was now in some danger from its own success, for it had outrun
the 91st Brigade of the Seventh Division upon its left, and its own comrades of
the 53rd Brigade upon its right. The 6th Northants held the defensive flank on
the left. Later in the day the 53rd came into line upon the right, and before
dark the 54th was able to move on again with little resistance until it had
reached its full objective at Montauban Alley.</p>
<p>The 53rd Brigade was on the right of the 54th. Its assaulting line was
formed by the 8th Norfolk upon the right, and the 6th Berkshires upon the left,
with the 10th Essex in support and the 8th Suffolk in reserve. The first two
lines were taken in their stride with little loss. A strong point behind these
lines held them up for a short time, but was rushed, and its garrison of the
109th Regiment was captured. Further progress of the Norfolks was made &brvbar;
difficult, however, by a flanking fire and by a second redoubt in front. As in
the case of the 53rd Brigade it was found that the way round is often the
shorter. Two bombing parties under gallant subalterns worked up the trenches on
the flank, while that murderous weapon, a Stokes gun, was brought up and opened
fire. The combined effect was decisive and 150 Germans threw down their arms.
Sixty more were taken in another redoubt to the left.</p>
<p>Whilst the Norfolks had been fighting their way forward in this fashion the
Berkshires upon their left, following very closely upon their own barrage, had
attained their objective in twenty minutes, and had to hold it for some hours
until the Norfolks had made good. During this time their right flank was
necessarily exposed. This flank was defended successfully by means of bombing
parties and a Lewis gun, while the left company instead of resting lent a hand
to their neighbours of the 54th Brigade in carrying Pommiers Redoubt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Norfolks had come ahead again, but the advance of the
Berkshires was held up by a small but determined band of bombers and snipers in
a strong position. A Stokes mortar drove back the bombers, but the snipers
still held fast, and killed in succession Lieutenant Rushton and Lieutenant
Saye who gallantly attacked them. A sergeant-major of the Berkshires was more
fortunate, however, and killed the chief sniper whose automatic rifle had
played the part of a machine-gun. In doing so he was severely wounded himself.
The Essex had come up into the firing line, but progress was still slow until
an invaluable Stokes mortar was again brought to bear and with its shower of
heavy bombs blasted the strong point out of existence. When night fell the
whole line of Montauban Alley had been successfully won and the various units
were in close touch and were busily organising their position.</p>
<p>Great obstinacy was shown by the Germans in their defence, which was a
gallant one, and might well have been successful against a less skilful attack.
Among other instances of their tenacity was one in which a sniper in a trench
behind the stormers continued to fire from some subterranean retreat and defied
all efforts to get at him, until it was found necessary to blow in the whole
face of the dug-out and so to bury him within his own stronghold.</p>
<p>The hardest fighting of any fell to the lot of the 55th Brigade upon the
right. The advance was made with the 8th East Surrey and 7th Queen's Surrey in
front, the latter to the left. The 7th Buffs were in support and the 7th West
Kents in reserve. No sooner had the troops come out from cover than they were
met by a staggering fire which held them up in the Breslau Trench. The supports
had soon to be pushed up to thicken the ranks of the East Surrey &mdash;a
battalion which, with the ineradicable sporting instinct and light-heartedness
of the Londoner had dribbled footballs, one for each platoon, across No Man's
Land and shot their goal in the front-line trench. A crater had been formed by
a mine explosion, forming a gap in the German front, and round this crater a
fierce fight raged for some time, the Germans rushing down a side sap which
brought them up to the fray. Into this side sap sprang an officer and a
sergeant of the Buffs, and killed 12 of the Germans, cutting off their flow of
reinforcements, while half a company of the same battalion cleared up the
crater and captured a machine-gun which had fought to the last cartridge. It is
worth recording that in the case of one of these machine-guns the gunner was
actually found with a four-foot chain attaching him to the tripod. Being badly
wounded and unable to disengage himself, the wretched man dragged himself, his
wound, and his tripod for some distance before being captured by the British.
The fact was duly established by a sworn inquiry.</p>
<p>The brigade was winning its way forward, but the hard resistance of the
Germans had delayed it to such a point that there was a danger that it would
not be in its place so as to cover the left flank of the 90th Brigade, who were
due to attack Montauban at 10 A.M. Such a failure might make the difference
between victory and defeat. At this critical moment the officer commanding the
East Surreys dashed to the front, re-formed his own men with all whom he could
collect and led them onwards. Captain Neville was killed in gallantly leading
the rush, but the wave went forward. There was check after check, but the point
had to be won, and the Suffolks of the 53rd Brigade were brought round to
strengthen the attack, while the West Kents were pushed forward to the fighting
line. By mid-day two platoons of West Kents were into Montauban Alley, and had
seized two houses at the western end of Montauban, which were rapidly fortified
by a section of the 92nd Field Company. The flank of the 90th was assured. A
South African officer led the first group of Surrey men who seized Montauban.
He is said during the action to have slain seventeen of the enemy.</p>
<p>The rest of the brigade, however, had desperate work to get into line with
the village. The East Surreys and Buffs were coming along well, but the Queen's
Surreys had lost heavily and were held up by a strong point called Back Trench.
A major of the Queen's gathered his men together, called up a bombing party
from the 8th Sussex, the pioneer of the battalion of the brigade, and then by a
united front and flank attack carried the position. One hundred and seventy
Germans remained alive in the trench. The infantry then surged forward to the
line of the Mametz-Montauban road, where they lay under machine-gun fire with
their left in the air, for a considerable gap had developed between them and
the 53rd Brigade. The main line of Montauban Alley in front of them was still
strongly held by the enemy. Once again the Stokes guns saved what looked like a
dangerous situation. They blasted a hole in Montauban Alley, and through the
hole rushed a furious storming party of the Queen's. As evening fell, after
that long day of fighting, the weary Eighteenth Division, splendid soldiers,
splendidly led, held the whole line from Montauban to the junction with the
Seventh Division near Mametz. One does not know which to admire most&mdash;the
able dispositions, the inflexible resolution of the troops, or the elastic
adaptability which enabled the initiative of the officers upon the spot to use
ever-varying means for getting over the successive difficulties. The losses
were very heavy, amounting to about 3000 officers and men, something under 1000
being fatal. Of the Germans 700 were captured, 1200 were buried after the
action, and the total loss could not possibly have been less than those
incurred by the British. It should be added that a great deal of the success of
the attack was due to the 82nd, 83rd, 84th, and 85th Brigades, Royal Field
Artillery, forming the divisional artillery, who earned the deepest gratitude
of the infantry, the highest reward to which the gunner can attain. Some of the
artillery of the Ninth Division was also engaged.</p>
<p>A few words may be said of the immediate future of the Eighteenth Division
before the narrative of July 1 is completed by a consideration of the work of
the Thirtieth Division. The ground captured included part of what may be called
the Montauban Ridge, and the possession of this point proved to be of great
service for observation in connection with the immediate operations at Bottom,
Shelter, and Mametz Woods by the Fifteenth Corps. The guns were at once
advanced and patrols were thrown out in front which penetrated and eventually
occupied Caterpillar Wood, a long winding plantation on the immediate front of
the Division. These various patrols picked up no less than twelve German
field-guns abandoned by the enemy. The front was held until July 8, when the
Eighteenth was relieved by the Third Division.</p>
<p>As to the fighting of the Germans upon this front, it was excellent as
usual&mdash;but it is needful to accentuate it, as there is a tendency to
depreciate the enemy at a point where he is beaten, which is an injustice to
the victors. The latter had no doubts about the matter. "There is one thing we
have all learned and that is that the Hun is a jolly good soldier and engineer,
so don't listen to any other nonsense. If you get hand-to-hand with him he
gives in at once, but he practically never lets you get so close. As long as
Fritz has a trench and a gun he will stick there till he is made crows'
rations. We know we are just slightly better than he is, but there's nothing
much in it&mdash;nothing to justify contempt or liberties," Such was the
considered opinion of an experienced soldier.</p>
<p>If the advance of the Eighteenth Division was successful, that of the
Thirtieth upon its right of the was not less so. This division had been raised
originally from Liverpool and Manchester, the battalions being all of the
King's Liverpool or of the Manchester Regiments. The greater part of these
battalions, which owe their origin largely to that great patriot, Lord Derby,
were recruited on the "pal" system, by which friends in peace should be
comrades in war. So close was Lord Derby's connection with the division that
his brother commanded one brigade, and three of his family served with the
guns, one of them commanding an artillery unit. This was the first appearance
of this fine force in actual battle, and it can truly be said that no division
could have been more fortunate or have given a better account of itself. It may
be explained that it had exchanged its 91st Brigade for the 21st of the Seventh
Division, and that several of the veteran battalions of the old Seventh now
served with the Thirtieth.</p>
<p>The objective of this division was the important village of Montauban deep
within the enemy's line. It seemed an ambitious mark in a war where every yard
means an effort, but it was accomplished with surprising ease, for the advance
was as determined as the defence was slack. On the right opposite Maricourt the
attack fell to the 89th Brigade, consisting of the 2nd Bedfords and the 17th,
19th, and 20th King's Liverpool battalions. On their left was the 21st Brigade,
while the 90th Brigade was in immediate support with orders to go through and
seize the village itself. From the start the attack went like clockwork. The
artillery was admirable, the infantry inexorable, and the leading all that
could be desired. The ever-ready machine-guns put up a fierce defence,
especially on the left flank, where the 18th King's Liverpools, led by their
popular colonel, lost three-quarters of their effectives but carried their
objective none the less. The 2nd West Yorks behind them were also terribly
scourged, but gained the line of the Glatz Redoubt all the same. Here, as with
the Eighteenth Division, there was every sign that the garrison of the front
trenches had been surprised. "The Germans gave us plenty of machine-gun fire
while we were advancing upon them; when we reached the trench only a few showed
fight. The rest flung up their arms and cried: 'Mercy, Kamerad!'" It was clear
they had been taken by surprise, for many of them were barefooted, none of them
had any equipment. When there was no attack at 4 A.M. they were then told that
they could lie down and have a rest, "as the British would not now come out
till four in the afternoon." It is abundantly clear that the famous German
intelligence department was absolutely at fault in the southern sector of the
great battle.</p>
<p>Although the first three trenches were carried without a hitch, the garrison
of the fourth had time to stand to arms, and were greatly assisted in their
defence by a flank fire from the still untaken village of Mametz, and from
machine-guns in the southern corner of Mametz Wood which lies to the north of
Montauban. The resistance caused considerable losses, including that of Colonel
Johnson of the 17th Manchesters, but the advance was irresistible, and swept
over every obstacle until they had reached their objective. On the right, the
Liverpool brigade, the 17th and 18th King's Liverpools in the lead, fought
their way up to the brick-fields, which lie nearly level with Montauban, but to
the south of it. A company seized these and a good bunch of prisoners. There it
consolidated in close touch with the famous "iron corps" of the French army
upon their right, while on the left the blue and yellow advance-flags of the
Thirtieth formed a continuous line with the red and yellow of the Eighteenth
Division. On the left of the Liverpools the Manchesters with the Scots
Fusiliers of the 90th Brigade had stormed their way into Montauban, the first
of that long list of village fortresses which were destined in the succeeding
months to fall into the hands of the British. It was carried with a rush in
spite of the determined resistance of small groups of Germans in various
houses, which had already been greatly mauled by our artillery. The British
fought their way from room to room, drove their enemies down into the cellars,
and hurled bombs on to them from above. The German losses were heavy, and
several hundreds of prisoners were sent to the rear. By the early afternoon the
whole village was in the hands of the 90th Brigade, who had also occupied
Montauban Alley, the trench 200 yards upon the farther side of it, whence by
their rifle-fire they crushed several attempts at counter-attack. These were
feeble during the day, but a very heavy one came during the night, aided by a
powerful shrapnel fire. The Germans, advancing in the closest order, for a time
won a lodgment in the new British front trench, killing a party of the 17th
Manchesters, but they were unable to hold it, and with daylight they were
ejected once more. The reader who is weary of hearing of British losses will be
interested to know, on the authority of Colonel Bedell of the 16th that out of
a garrison of 3500 men from the 6th Bavarian Reserve Regiments only 500 escaped
from the Montauban front. All these operations were carried out in close touch
with the French upon the right, so close indeed that the colonel of the 17th
King's Liverpools, seeing that the French colonel of the flank battalion was
advancing beside his men, sprang out and joined him, so that the two colonels
shook hands in the captured position.</p>
<p>Some stress has in this narrative been laid upon the fact that the
difficulties to be overcome in the south were less than those in the north.
Such an assertion is only fair to the gallant men who failed. At the same time
nothing should detract from the credit due to those splendid southerly
divisions who really won the battle and made the hole through which the whole
army eventually passed.</p>
<p>Though the French operations do not primarily come within the scope of this
record, it is necessary to give some superficial account of them, since they
form an integral and essential part of the battle. So important were they, and
so successful, that it is not too much to say that it was the complete victory
upon their line which atoned for our own want of success in the north, and
assured that the balance of this most bloody day should be in our favour. It is
true, as they would be the first to admit, that the troops of General Foch had
none of those impassable barrages, concentrations of machine-guns, and
desperately defended inner lines of trenches which inflicted such losses upon
our stormers. Both the positions and the men who held them were less
formidable. On the other hand, it is for us to bear in mind that the French had
already made their great effort in the common cause at Verdun, and that this
attack upon the West was primarily a British offensive in which they were
playing a subsidiary part. It is the more remarkable that their success should
have been so great and that they should have been able for months to come to
play so notable a part in the battle that the tale of their prisoners and booty
was not less than our own.</p>
<p>The attack of the British was roughly upon a twenty-mile front, from the
Gommecourt salient to Maricourt. On this stretch they broke the German lines
for 7 miles from the north of Fricourt to Montauban. The French front was about
8 miles long, and moved forward for its whole extent. Thus it may be said that
the whole battle line was 28 miles, and that more than one-half, or 15 miles,
represented the area of victory. During the whole operations for many months
the French army was cut in two by the marshy valley of the Somme, the
detachment to the north of it acting in close unison with the British
Thirteenth Corps upon their left. We will call these the northern and the
southern French armies, both being under the direction of General Foch.</p>
<p>It may briefly be stated that the advance of the French army was carried out
with great dash and valour on both banks of the river. After carrying several
lines of trenches at very little loss to themselves, the northern army found
itself, on the evening of July 1, holding the outskirts of the villages of
Curlu and of Hardecourt. On July 2 Curlu was entirely occupied, and shortly
afterwards Hardecourt also fell. The southern army, which consisted of of the
the fiery Colonial Division upon the left and the Twentieth upon the right,
under the immediate leadership of General Fayolle, had even greater success.
Not only all the lines of trenches but the villages of Dompierre, Becquincourt,
Bussu, and Fay were stormed upon July 1. On the 2nd Frise and the Moreaucourt
Wood had also been taken, and several counter-attacks repelled. On that evening
the French were able to report that they had taken 6000 prisoners, while the
British operations had yielded 3500 &mdash;or 9500 in all.</p>
<p>When the sun set upon that bloody day&mdash;probably the most stirring of
any single day in the whole record of the world&mdash;the higher command of the
Allies must have looked upon the result with a strange mixture of feelings, in
which dismay at the losses in the north and pride at the successes in the south
contended for the mastery. The united losses of all the combatants, British,
French, and Germans, must have been well over 100,000 between the rising and
the setting of one summer sun. It is a rout which usually swells the casualties
of a stricken army, but here there was no question of such a thing, and these
huge losses were incurred in actual battle. As the attackers our own casualties
were undoubtedly heavier than those of the enemy, and it is natural that as we
turn from that list we ask ourselves the question whether our gains were worth
it. Such a question might be an open one at Neuve Chapelle or at Loos, but here
the answer must be a thousand times Yes. Together we had done the greatest
day's work in the War up to that time&mdash;a day's work which led to many
developments in the future, and eventually to a general German retreat over 70
miles of front. It was not a line of trenches which we broke, it was in truth
the fortified frontier of Germany built up by a year and a half of unremitting
labour. By breaking it at one point we had outflanked it from the Somme to the
sea, and however slow the process might be of getting room for our forces to
deploy, and pushing the Germans off our flank, it was certain that sooner or
later that line must be rolled up from end to end. It was hoped, too, that
under our gunfire no other frontier of similar strength could grow up in front
of us. That was the great new departure which may be dated from July 1, and is
an ample recompense for our losses. These young lives were gladly laid down as
a price for final victory&mdash;and history may show that it was really on
those Picardy slopes that final victory was in truth ensured. Even as the day
of Gettysburg was the turning-point of the American Civil War, and as that of
Paardeberg was the real death-blow to the Boers, so the breaking of the line
between Fricourt and Frise may well prove to have been the decisive victory in
the terrible conflict which the swollen dreams of Prussia had brought upon the
world.</p>
<p>When one considers the enormous scale of the action, the desperate valour of
the troops engaged, and the fact that the German line was fairly and
permanently broken for the first time, one feels that this date should be for
ever marked in British military annals as the glorious First of July.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap5" name="chap5">V. THE BATTLE
OF THE SOMME<br>
From July 2 to July 14, 1916</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">General situation&mdash;Capture of La Boiselle by
Nineteenth Division&mdash;Splendid attack by 36th Brigade upon Ovillers
&mdash;Siege and reduction of Ovillers&mdash;Operations at Contalmaison
&mdash;Desperate fighting at the Quadrangle by Seventeenth Division &mdash;
Capture of Mametz Wood by Thirty-eighth Welsh Division&mdash;Capture of Trones
Wood by Eighteenth Division</p>
<p class="first">THE terrible fighting just described, during which the German
line was broken at its southern end, was but the opening of a most desperate
battle, which extended of the over many months. This, while it cost very heavy
losses on both sides, exacted such a toll from the Germans in prisoners and
lost material, as well as in casualties, that it is probable that their army
would have been largely disorganised had not the wet weather of October come to
hamper the operations. As it was, the letters of the soldiers and the
intercepted messages of the Generals show an amount of demoralisation which
proves the mighty pressure applied by the allied armies. It was a battle which
was seldom general throughout the curve into which the attackers had
encroached, but which confined itself to this or that limited objective
&mdash;to the north, to the east, or to the south, the blow falling the more
suddenly, since during the whole of this time the Allies preserved the command
of the air to an extent which actually enabled them to push their guns forward
across the open. Sometimes it was a fortified village which was carried.
Sometimes it was the trenches between villages, so that the garrisons might
feel in danger of being cut off. Sometimes&mdash;the worst obstacle of
all&mdash;it was one of the patches of wood dotted over the country-side, which
had to be cleared of the enemy's stubborn infantry and machine-gunners. But
whatever the task might be, it may be stated generally that it was always
carried out, if not at the first, then at the second, third, or some subsequent
attempt. It may also be said that never once during all that time did a yard of
ground which had been taken by the Allies pass permanently back to the enemy.
Before the winter had fallen more than forty villages had been carried and held
by the attack&mdash;but not one by the counter-attack. The losses were heavy,
sometimes very heavy, but so perfect now was the co-ordination between infantry
and guns, and so masterful the allied artillery, that it is highly probable
that at last the defence was losing as many as the attack. Those deep ravines
which had enabled the Germans to escape the effects of the early bombardments
no longer existed in the new lines, and the superficial ditches which now
formed the successive lines of defence offered little protection from a fire
directed by a most efficient air service. On the other hand, since the German
air service had been beaten out of the sky, the sight of the German gunners was
dim, and became entirely blind when by their successive advances the Allies had
pushed them over the low ridges which formed their rearward positions. The map,
however skilfully used, is a poor substitute for the observation officer and
the aeroplane.</p>
<p>Standing on the edge of this welter, and gazing at this long haze info which
vigorous divisions continually plunge, relieving exhausted units, only to
stagger out in their turn, rent and torn, while yet others press to the front,
one feels appalled at the difficulty of following such complex operations and
of conveying them clearly and in their due order to the mind of the reader.
Some fixed system must evidently be followed if the narrative is to remain
intelligible and the relation of the various actions to each other to be made
evident. Therefore the course of events will still, so far as possible, be
traced from the north, and each incident be brought to some sort of natural
pause before we pass onwards down the line. We can at once eliminate the whole
northern portion of the British line from the Gommecourt salient down to
Albert, since for that long stretch attack had changed definitely to defence,
and we start our narrative from the south of the Albert-Bapaume road. From that
point four villages immediately faced the old British line, and each was now a
centre of fighting. From the north they were La Boiselle, Fricourt, Mametz, and
Montauban. The latter had been held against a strong counter-attack on the
early morning of July 2, and it was firmly in the possession of the Thirtieth
Division. Mametz was held by the Seventh Division, who were pushing on to the
north, driving a weak resistance before them. Fricourt had been deserted by the
morning of July 2, and had been occupied by the Seventeenth Division, who also
at once pushed on towards the woodlands behind. La Boiselle was closely
assailed with part of the Thirty-fourth Division to the south of it, and the
Twelfth and Nineteenth Divisions with other troops all round it. These four
villages and the gaps between them represented the break in the German front
line.</p>
<p>The second German main line ran through the Bazentins and Longueval, and it
was reached and carried by the British Army upon July 14. The intervening
fortnight between the battle of the front and of the second line was occupied
in clearing the many obstacles, consisting for the most part of woods and
subsidiary trenches which filled the space between the two lines, and also in
attacking the two villages of Ovillers and Contalmaison, which hampered
operations upon the left wing. It will help the reader very much to understand
these apparently complex movements if he will realise that they divide
themselves into three distinct groups of activity, counting from the north of
the line. The first group is concerned with the capture of Ovillers, and in it
the Twelfth, Nineteenth, Thirty-second, and Twenty-fifth Divisions are
concerned. The second group is connected with the capture of the strong
position which is bastioned by Contalmaison upon one side and Mametz Wood at
the other, with the Quadrangle system of trenches between. In this very severe
conflict the Twenty-third, Seventeenth, Seventh, and Thirty-eighth Divisions
were engaged. Finally there is the group of operations by which the right wing
was advanced through Bernafoy Wood and up to Trones Wood. In these, the Ninth,
Thirtieth, and Eighteenth Divisions were chiefly concerned. We shall now take
each of these in turn, beginning with the northern one, the taking of Ovillers,
and carrying each narrative to a definite term. Before embarking upon this
account it should be mentioned that the of the two northern corps of
Rawlinson's army&mdash;the Eighth and Tenth&mdash;were from now onwards
detached as a separate Fifth Army under Sir Hubert Gough, one of the most
rising commanders in the Service. The functions of this Army were to hold the
line from La Boiselle to Serre, and to form a defensive flank and pivot for the
Third, Fifteenth, and Thirteenth Corps to the south.</p>
<p>We shall first follow the further fortunes of the troops which operated in
the north. Upon July 3 there was a short but severe action upon that part of
the old British line immediately to the left of the gap which had been broken.
In this action, which began at 6 A.M., the Thirty-second Division, already
greatly weakened by its exertions two days before, together with the 75th
Brigade, lent them by the Twenty-fifth Division, tried to widen the rent in
the' German line by tearing open that portion of it which had been so fatal to
the Eighth Division. The attack failed, however, though most bravely delivered,
and the difficulties proved once more to be unsurmountable. The attempt cost us
heavy casualties, a considerable proportion of which fell upon the 75th
Brigade, especially upon the 11th Cheshires, whose colonel was killed, and upon
the 2nd South Lancashires, who ran into wire and were held up there. The 8th
Borders reached their objective, but after one-and-a-half hours were forced to
let go of it. The operation proved that whatever misfortunes had befallen the
Germans to the south, they were still rooted as firmly as ever in their old
positions. The same lesson was to be taught us on the same morning at an
adjacent portion of the line.</p>
<p>This episode was at the immediate south of the unsuccessful attack just
described. It has already been stated that the Twelfth, the English division
which had seen so much hard fighting at Loos, had taken over part of the
trenches of the Eighth Division, and so found themselves facing Ovillers. Their
chances of a successful advance upon the village were increased by the fact
that the Nineteenth Division, after hard fighting, had got into La Boiselle to
the south, and so occupied a flank to their advance.</p>
<p>Some further definition is required as to the situation at La Boiselle, how
it was brought about, and its extreme importance to the general plan of
operations. When the left of the Thirty-fourth Division had failed to hold the
village, while some mixed units of the right brigade had established themselves
within the German lines as already narrated, it became very vital to help them
by a renewed attempt upon the village itself. For this purpose the Nineteenth
Division had moved forward, a unit which had not yet been seriously engaged. It
was under the command of a fighting Irish dragoon, whose whimsical expedient
for moving forwards the stragglers at St. Quentin has been recorded in a
previous volume. On the evening of July 1, one battalion of this division, the
9th Cheshires, had got into the German front line trench near the village, but
they were isolated there and hard put to it to hold their own during a long and
desperate night. On the following afternoon, about 4 o'clock, two of their
fellow-battalions of the 58th Brigade, the 9th Royal Welsh Fusiliers and the
6th Wilts, charged suddenly straight across the open at the village, while by a
clever device the British barrage was turned elsewhere with the effect of
misleading the German barrage which played upon the wrong area. By 9 P.M. on
July 2 the south end of the village had been captured, but the resistance was
still very fierce. Early next morning the whole of the division was drawn into
this street fighting, and gradually the Germans were pushed back. There was one
desperate counter-attack during which the British line was hard put to it to
hold its own, and the house-to-house fighting continued throughout the whole
day and night. Two British colonels, one of the 7th South Lancashires and the
other of the 8th Gloucesters, particularly distinguished themselves in this
close fighting. The latter, a dragoon like his commander, was a hard soldier
who had left an eye in Somaliland and a hand at Ypres, but the sight of him in
this day of battle, tearing out the safety-pin of bombs with his teeth and
hurling them with his remaining hand, was one which gave heart to his men.
Slowly the Germans were worn down, but the fighting was fierce and the British
losses heavy, including three commanding officers, Wedgwood of the North
Staffords, Royston Piggott of the 10th Worcesters, and Heath of the 10th
Warwicks, the first two killed, the latter wounded. In the midst of the
infantry fighting a single gun of the 19th Battery galloped with extraordinary
gallantry right into the village and engaged the enemy point-blank with
splendid effect. For this fine performance Captain Campbell and ten men of the
gun's crew received decorations. By the evening of the 6th the whole village
was solidly consolidated by the Nineteenth Division, they had broken up a
strong counter-attack from the direction of Pozi&egrave;res, and they had
extended their conquest so as to include the redoubt called Heligoland. We must
turn, however, to the attack which had in the meanwhile been prepared upon the
line to the immediate north of La Boiselle by the Twelfth Division.</p>
<p>This attack was carried out at three in the morning of July 7 by the 35th
and the 37th Brigades. The fighting line from the right consisted of the 5th
Berks, 7th Suffolks, 6th Queen's Surrey, and 6th West Kent, with the other
battalions in close support. Unhappily, there was a group of machine-guns in
some broken ground to the north of La Boiselle, which had not yet been reached
by the Nineteenth Division, and the fire of these guns was so deadly that the
battalions who got across were too weak to withstand a counter-attack of German
bombers. They were compelled, after a hard struggle, to fall back to the
British line. One curious benefit arose in an unexpected way from the
operation, for part of the 9th Essex, losing its way in the dark, stumbled upon
the rear of the German defenders of the northern edge of La Boiselle, by which
happy chance they took 200 prisoners, helped the Nineteenth in their task, and
participated in a victory instead of a check.</p>
<p>It was evident that before the assault was renewed some dispositions should
be made to silence the guns which made the passage perilous. With this in view,
another brigade, the 74th from the Twenty-fifth Division, was allotted to the
commander of the Twelfth Division, by whom it was placed between his own
position and that held by the Nineteenth at La Boiselle. It was arranged that
these fresh troops should attack at eight o'clock in the morning of of the July
7, approaching Ovillers from the south, and overrunning the noxious
machine-guns, while at 8:30 the 36th Brigade, hitherto in reserve, should
advance upon Ovillers from the west. By this difference of half an hour in the
attack it was hoped that the 74th would have got the guns before the 36th had
started.</p>
<p>After an hour's bombardment the signal was given and the 74th Brigade came
away with a rush, headed by the 13th Cheshires and 9th North Lancashires, with
the 2nd Irish Rifles and 11th Lancashire Fusiliers in support. The advance
found the Germans both in front and on either flank of them, but in spite of a
withering fire they pushed on for their mark. Nearly every officer of the 13th
Cheshires from Colonel Finch down to Somerset, the junior subaltern, was hit.
Half-way between La Boiselle and Ovillers the attack was brought to a halt, and
the men found such cover as they could among the shell holes. Their supporting
lines had come up, but beyond some bombing parties there was no further advance
during the day. Fifty yards away the untaken machine-gun emplacements lay in
front of them, while Ovillers itself was about 600 yards distant upon their
left front.</p>
<p>In the meantime, after waiting half an hour, the 36th Brigade had advanced.
The machine-guns were, however, still active on either flank of them, and on
their immediate front lay the rubbish-heap which had once been a village, a
mass of ruins now. But amid those ruins lay the Fusiliers of the Prussian
Guard&mdash;reputed to be among the best soldiers in Europe, and every chink
was an embrasure for rifle or machine-gun. The advance was one which may have
been matched in the glorious annals of the British infantry, but can never have
been excelled. The front line consisted of the 8th and 9th Royal Fusiliers, one
upon each wing, the 7th Sussex in the centre, and the 11th Middlesex in
support&mdash;south-country battalions all. They had lain waiting for the
signal in trenches which were beaten to pieces by a terrific German shelling.
There were considerable casualties before the first man sprang from fire-step
to parapet. As they crossed No Man's Land bullets beat upon them from every
side. The advance was rendered more frightful by the heavy weather, which held
down the fumes of the poison shells, so that the craters in which men took
refuge were often found to be traps from which they never again emerged. Many
of the wounded met their death in this terrible fashion. Still the thin lines
went forward, for nothing would stop them save death or the voice of their
company officers. They were up and over the first German line. A blast of fire
staggered them for a moment, and then with a splendid rally they were into the
second trench, and had seized the line of hedges and walls which skirt the
western edge of the village. Five hundred men were left out of those who had
sprung from the British trench; but the 500 still went forward. The two
Fusilier battalions had hardly the strength of a company between them, and the
leaders were all down&mdash;but every man was a leader that day. Their spirit
was invincible. An officer has recorded how a desperately wounded man called
out, "Are the trenches taken, sir?" On hearing that they were, he fell back and
cried, "Thank God! for nothing else matters." In the centre the Sussex men
still numbered nearly 300, and their colonel aided and directed while they
consolidated the ground. One hundred and fifty were hit as they did so, but the
handful who were left defied every effort of shell, bomb, or bayonet to put
them out. A lodgment had been made, and nothing now could save the village. By
a wise provision, seeing that no supplies could reach them, every man had been
loaded up with twenty bombs, and had been instructed to use every captured
German bomb or cartridge before any of his own. As dusk fell, two companies of
the supporting Middlesex battalion were sent up, under heavy fire, to thicken
the line, which was further strengthened next day by two battalions from the
37th Brigade, while the 75th Brigade prolonged it to the south. In the morning
of July 9 the Twelfth Division, sorely stricken but triumphant, was drawn from
the line, leaving the northern half of the Ovillers front to the Thirty-second
Division and the southern half to the Twenty-fifth, the scattered brigades of
which were now reunited under one general.</p>
<p>That commander had found himself during these operations in a difficult
position, as the 74th Brigade had been moved from him and allotted to the
Twelfth Division, and the Seventy-fifth by the Thirty-second Division. None the
less, he had carried on vigorously with his remaining Brigade&mdash;the 7th,
and had enlarged and strengthened the British position in the Leipzig salient.
During July 5 and 6 the 1st Wilts and the 3rd Worcesters had both broadened and
extended their fronts by means of surprise attacks very well carried out. On
the 7th they pushed forward, as part of the general scheme of extension upon
that day, advancing with such dash and determination that they got ahead of the
German barrage and secured a valuable trench.</p>
<p>When upon Sunday, July 9, the Thirty-second Division had entirely taken over
from the Twelfth on the west of Ovillers, the 14th Brigade were in the post of
honour on the edge of the village. The 2nd Manchesters on the left and the 15th
Highland Light Infantry on the right, formed the advanced line with the 1st
Dorsets in support, while the 19th Lancashire Fusiliers were chiefly occupied
in the necessary and dangerous work of carrying forward munitions and supplies.
Meanwhile, the pioneer battalion, the 17th Northumberland Fusiliers, worked
hard to join up the old front trench with the new trenches round Ovillers. It
should be mentioned, as an example of the spirit animating the British Army,
that Colonel Pears of this battalion had been invalided home for cancer, that
he managed to return to his men for this battle, and that shortly afterwards he
died of the disease.</p>
<p>On July 10 at noon the 14th Brigade advanced upon Ovillers from the west,
carrying on the task which had been so well begun by the 36th Brigade. The
assailants could change their ranks, but this advantage was denied to the
defenders, for a persistent day and night barrage cut them off from their
companions in the north. None the less, there was no perceptible weakening of
the defence, and the Prussian Guard lived up to their own high traditions. A
number of them had already been captured in the trenches, mature soldiers of
exceptional physique. Their fire was as murderous as ever, and the 2nd
Manchesters on the north or left of the line suffered severely. The 15th
Highlanders were more fortunate made good progress. The situation had been
improved by an advance at 9 P.M. upon this date, July 10, by the 2nd
Inniskilling Fusiliers from the Sixth Division, higher up the line, who made a
lodgment north-west of Ovillers, which enabled a Russian sap to be opened up
from the British front line. The Inniskillings lost 150 men out of two
companies engaged, but they created a new and promising line of attack.</p>
<p>The British were now well into the village, both on the south and on the
west, but the fighting was closer and more sanguinary than ever. Bombardments
alternated with attacks, during which the British won the outlying ruins, and
fought on from one stone heap to another, or down into the cellars below, where
the desperate German Guardsmen fought to the last until overwhelmed with bombs
from above, or stabbed by the bayonets of the furious stormers. The depleted
74th Brigade of the Twenty-fifth Division had been brought back to its work
upon July 10, and on the 12th the 14th Brigade was relieved by the 96th of the
same Thirty-second Division. On the night of July 12 fresh ground was gained by
a surge forward of the 2nd South Lancashires of the 75th Brigade, and of the
19th Lancashire Fusiliers, these two battalions pushing the British line almost
up to Ovillers Church. Again, on the night of the 13th the 3rd Worcesters and
8th Borders made advances, the latter capturing a strong point which blocked
the way to further progress. On the 14th, however, the 10th Cheshires had a
set-back, losing a number of men. Again, on the night of July 14 the 1st
Dorsets cut still further into the limited area into which the German
resistance had been compressed. On the night of the 15th the Thirty-second
Division was drawn out, after a fortnight of incessant loss, and was replaced
by the Forty-eighth Division of South Midland Territorials, the 143rd Brigade
consisting entirely of Warwick battalions, being placed under the orders of the
General of the Twenty-fifth Division. The village, a splintered rubbish-heap,
with the church raising a stumpy wall, a few feet high, in the middle of it,
was now very closely pressed upon all sides. The German cellars and dug-outs
were still inhabited, however, and within them the Guardsmen were as dangerous
as wolves at bay. On the night of July 15-16 a final attack was arranged. It
was to be carried through by the 74th, 75th, and 143rd Brigades, and was timed
for 1 A.M. For a moment it threatened disaster, as the 5th Warwicks got forward
into such a position that they were cut off from supplies, but a strong effort
was made by their comrades, who closed in all day until 6 P.M., when the
remains of the garrison surrendered. Two German officers and 125 men were all
who remained unhurt in this desperate business; and it is on record that one of
the officers expended his last bomb by hurling it at his own men on seeing that
they had surrendered. Eight machine guns were taken. It is said that the
British soldiers saluted the haggard and grimy survivors as they were led out
among the ruins. It was certainly a very fine defence. After the capture of the
village, the northern and eastern outskirts were cleared by the men of the
Forty-eighth Territorial Division, which was partly accomplished by a night
attack of the 4th Gloucesters. From now onwards till July 29 this Division was
engaged in very arduous work, pushing north and and east, and covering the
flank of the Australians in their advance upon Pozi&egrave;res.</p>
<p>So much for the first group of operations in the intermediate German
position. We shall now pass to the second, which is concerned with the strong
fortified line formed by the Quadrangle system of trenches between Contalmaison
upon our left and Mametz Wood upon our right.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned under the operations of the Twenty-first Division in
the last chapter that the 51st Brigade passed through the deserted village of
Fricourt upon the morning of July 2, taking about 100 prisoners.</p>
<p>On debouching at the eastern end they swung to the right, the 7th Lincolns
attacking Fricourt Wood, and the 8th South Staffords, Fricourt Farm. The wood
proved to be a tangle of smashed trees, which was hardly penetrable, and a
heavy fire stopped the Lincolns. The colonel, however, surmounted the
difficulty by detaching an officer and a party of men to outflank the wood,
which had the effect of driving out the Germans. The South Staffords were also
successful in storming the farm, but could not for the moment get farther.
Several hundreds of prisoners from the 111th Regiment and three guns were
captured during this advance, but the men were very exhausted at the end of it,
having been three nights without rest. Early next day (July 3) the advance was
resumed, the 51st Brigade still to the fore, working in co-operation with the
62nd Brigade of the Twenty-first Division upon their left. By hard fighting,
the Staffords, Lincolns, and Sherwoods pushed their way into Railway Alley and
Railway Copse, while the 7th Borders established themselves in Bottom Wood. The
operations came to a climax when in the afternoon a battalion of the 186th
Prussian Regiment, nearly 600 strong, was caught between the two Brigades in
Crucifix Trench and had to surrender; altogether the 51st Brigade had done a
very strenuous and successful spell of duty. The ground gained was consolidated
by the 77th Field Company, Royal Engineers.</p>
<p>The 62nd Brigade of the Twenty-first Division, supported by the 63rd, had
moved parallel to the 51st Brigade, the 1st Lincolns, 10th Yorkshires, and two
battalions of Northumberland Fusiliers advancing upon Shelter Wood and carrying
it by storm. It was a fine bit of woodland fighting, and the first intimation
to the Germans that their fortified forests would no more stop British infantry
than their village strongholds could do. The enemy, both here and in front of
the Seventeenth Division, were of very different stuff from the veterans of
Ovillers, and surrendered in groups as soon as their machine-guns had failed to
stop the disciplined rush of their assailants. After this advance, the
Twenty-first Division was drawn out of line for a rest, and the Seventeenth
extending to the left was in touch with the regular 24th Brigade, forming the
right of Babington's Twenty-third Division, who were closing in upon
Contalmaison. On the right the 17th were in touch with the 22nd Brigade of the
Seventh Division, which was pushing up towards the dark and sinister clumps of
woodland which barred their way. On the night of July 5 an advance was made,
the Seventh Division upon Mametz Wood, and the Seventeenth upon the Quadrangle
Trench, connecting the wood with Contalmaison. The attack upon the wood itself
had no success, though the 1st Royal Welsh Fusiliers reached their objective,
but the 52nd Brigade was entirely successful at Quadrangle Trench, where two
battalions&mdash;the 9th Northumberland Fusiliers and 10th Lancashire
Fusiliers&mdash;crept up within a hundred yards unobserved and then carried the
whole position with a splendid rush. It was at once consolidated.</p>
<p>The Twenty-third Division had advanced upon the left and were close to
Contalmaison. On the night of July 5 the Seventh Division was drawn out and the
Thirty-eighth Welsh Division took over the line which faced Mametz Wood.</p>
<p>The Seventeenth Division, after its capture of the Quadrangle Trench, was
faced by a second very dangerous and difficult line called the Quadrangle
Support, the relative position of which is shown upon the diagram on the next
page.</p>
<p>It is clear that if either Mametz Wood or Contalmaison were to fall, this
trench would become untenable for the Germans, but until those two bastions, or
at least one of them, was in our hands, there was such a smashing fire beating
down upon an open advance of 600 yards, that no harder task could possibly be
given to a Division. The trench was slightly over the brow of a slope, so that
when the guns played upon it the garrison were able to sUp quickly away and
take refuge in Mametz Wood, coming back again in time to meet an assault which
they were well aware could only be delivered by troops which had passed through
an ordeal of fire which must shake and weaken them.</p>

"Quadrangle Position, July 5-11, 1916"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Quadrangle Position, July 5-11, 1916</p>
<br>
<p>It seemed that the best chance to bring a striking force up to the trench
was to make the attempt at night, so at 2 A.M. of July 7 the 9th Northumberland
Fusiliers and 10th Lancashire Fusiliers, the same battalions which had already
taken Quadrangle Trench, advanced through the darkness of an inclement night
upon their objective. The enemy proved, however, to be in great force, and
their trench was stuffed with men who were themselves contemplating an attack.
A party of Lancashire Fusiliers got into Pearl Alley, which is on the left near
Contalmaison, but the village stands on a slight eminence, and from it the
trench and the approaches can be swept by fire. The British attack was driven
back with loss, and was followed up by the 9th Grenadiers of the Prussian
Guard, who were in turn driven back by the left of the British line, consisting
of the 10th Lancashire Fusiliers and some of the 1st Worcesters. In the morning
another attempt was made upon Quadrangle Support, this time by the 9th West
Ridings and the 12th Manchesters. Small parties got up to Acid Drop Copse,
close to Contalmaison, but they were too weak to hold on. At the end of this
attack the 52nd Brigade, which had been so badly mauled, was drawn out and the
51st put back in its place.</p>
<p>This severe fighting at the Quadrangle was part of a wider action, which was
to include an attack by the Twenty-third Division upon Contalmaison and an
attack by the Thirty-eighth upon Mametz Wood. The Contalmaison attack won its
way into the north-west side of the village at 11 o'clock on the morning of
July 7, but by 12 o'clock it had been held and eventually repulsed. By 4:30 the
24th Brigade of the Twenty-third Division, which was on the immediate left of
the Seventeenth Division, had been driven of the back to its trenches, the 1st
Worcesters, 2nd East Lancashires, and 2nd Northamptons suffering heavily.</p>
<p>Whilst the Contalmaison attack had failed upon the left, that upon Mametz
Wood had no better success upon the right. It was to have been carried out by
the Thirty-eighth Welsh Division, but in its approach such opposition was
encountered to the wood that the 16th Welsh (City of Cardiff) and 10th South
Wales Borderers could not get forward. Meanwhile, the 50th Brigade from the
Seventeenth Division had been told off to co-operate with this attack, and
naturally found themselves with their right flank in the air, the 7th East
Yorks suffering severely in consequence. None the less, some advance was made
upon this side.</p>
<p>In the night of July 7 a third attack was made upon Quadrangle Support, with
no better result than the others. On this occasion the 51st Brigade had
relieved the 52nd, and it was the 10th Sherwood Foresters which endured the
heavy losses, and persevered until they were within bomb-throw of their
objective, losing Major Hall Brown, a gallant Ceylon planter, and many officers
and men. At the same hour the 50th Brigade had again tried to gain ground in
the direction of Mametz Wood, but had failed on account of uncut wire. The
military difficulties of the situation during this day were greatly enhanced by
the state of the ground, owing to most unseasonable heavy rain, which left four
feet of mud in some of the trenches. Altogether, when one considers the want of
success at Ovillers, the repulse at Contalmaison, the three checks in one day
at the Quadrangle, and the delay of the attack on Mametz Wood, the events of
July 7 showed that the task of the British, even inside a broken German line,
was still a very heavy one. General Horne upon the line and Sir Douglas Haig
behind it must both have felt the strain that night.</p>
<p>At six in the morning of July 8 the undefeatable Seventeenth Division was
again hard at work encompassing the downfall of its old opponents in Quadrangle
Support. Since it could not be approached above ground, it was planned that two
brigades, the 51st and the 50th, should endeavour to bomb their way from each
side up those trenches which were in their hands. It is wonderful that troops
which had already endured so much, and whose nerve might well be shattered and
their hearts broken by successive failures, should still be able to carry out a
form of attack which of all others call for dash and reckless courage. It was
done, none the less, and with some success, the bombers blasting their way up
Pearl Alley on the left to the point where it joins on to the Quadrangle
Support. The bombers of the 7th Lincolns did particularly well. "Every
attempted attack by the Boche was met by them with the most extraordinary
Berserker fury. They utterly cowed the enemy." So wrote an experienced
spectator. On the right the 50th Brigade made some progress also up Quadrangle
Alley. Artillery fire, however, put a term to the advance in both instances,
the guns of Contalmaison dominating the whole position. In the evening a fresh
bombing attack was made by the same troops, whose exertions seem really to have
reached the limit of human capacity. This time the 7th Borders actually reached
Quadrangle Support, but were unable to get farther. The same evening some of
the 50th Brigade bombed down Wood Trench towards Mametz Wood, so as to
facilitate the coming attack by the Thirty-eighth Division. On July 9 both
Brigades again tried to bomb their way into Quadrangle Support, and were again
held up by the enemy's fire. This was the sixth separate attempt upon the same
objective by the same soldiers&mdash;an example surely of the wonderful
material of which the New Armies were composed.</p>
<p>But their labours were not yet done. Though both brigades were worn to
shadows, it was still a point of honour to hold to their work. At 11:20 that
night a surprise attack was made across the open under the cover of night. The
8th South Staffords on the left&mdash;charging with a yell of
"Staffords!"&mdash;reached the point where Pearl Alley joins the Quadrangle
Support (see Diagram), and held on most desperately. The 50th Brigade on the
right were checked and could give no assistance. The men upon the left strove
hard to win their way down Quadrangle Support, but most of the officers were
down, the losses were heavy, and the most that they could do was to hold on to
the junction with Pearl Alley. The 50th were ready to go forward again to help
them, and the Yorkshire men were already on the move; but day was slowly
breaking and it was doubtful if the trench could be held under the guns of
Contalmaison. The attack upon the right was therefore stopped, and the left
held on as best it might, the South Staffords, having lost grievously, nearly
all their officers, including the Adjutant, Coleridge, being on the ground.</p>
<p>We may now leave this heroic tragedy of the of the Quadrangle and turn our
attention to what had been going on at Mametz Wood upon the right, which was
really the key to the situation. It has already been stated that the wood had
been attacked in vain by a brigade of the Seventh Division, and that the
Thirty-eighth Welsh Division had found some difficulty in even approaching it.
It was indeed a formidable obstacle upon the path of the army. An officer has
described how he used to gaze from afar upon the immense bulk, the vast
denseness and darkness of Mametz Wood, and wonder, knowing the manifold dangers
which lurked beneath its shadows, whether it was indeed within human power to
take it. Such was the first terrible task to which the Welshmen of the New Army
were called. It was done, but one out of every three men who did it found the
grave or the hospital before the survivors saw the light shine between the
further tree-trunks.</p>
<p>As the Welshmen came into the line they had the Seventeenth Division upon
their left, facing Quadrangle Support, and the Eighteenth upon their right at
Caterpillar Wood. When at 4:15 on the morning of July 10 all was ready for the
assault, the Third Division had relieved the Eighteenth on the right, but the
Seventeenth was, as we have seen, still in its position, and was fighting on
the western edge of the wood.</p>
<p>The attack of the Welshmen started from White Trench, which lies south-east
of the wood and meanders along the brow of a sharp ridge. Since it was dug by
the enemy it was of little use to the attack, for no rifle fire could be
brought to bear from it upon the edge of the wood, while troops coming over the
hill and down the slope were dreadfully exposed. Apart from the German riflemen
and machine-gunners, who lay thick among the shell-blasted stumps of trees,
there was such a tangle of thick undergrowth and fallen trunks lying at every
conceivable angle that it would take a strong and active man to make his way
through the wood with a fowling-piece for his equipment and a pheasant for his
objective. No troops could have had a more desperate task&mdash;the more so as
the German second line was only a few hundred yards from the north end of the
wood, whence they could reinforce it at their pleasure.</p>
<p>The wood is divided by a central ride running north and south. All to the
west of this was allotted to the 113th Brigade, a unit of Welsh Fusilier
battalions commanded by a young brigadier who is more likely to win honour than
decorations, since he started the War with both the V.C. and the D.S.O. The
114th Brigade, comprising four battalions of the Welsh Regiment, was to carry
the eastern half of the wood, the attack being from the south. The front line
of attack, counting from the right, consisted of the 13th Welsh (2nd Rhonddas),
14th Welsh (Swansea), with its left on the central ride, and 16th Royal Welsh
Fusiliers in the van of the 113th Brigade. About 4:30 in the morning the
barrage lifted from the shadowy edge of the wood, and the infantry pushed
forward with all the Cymric fire which burns in that ancient race as fiercely
as ever it has done, as every field of manly sport will show. It was a
magnificent spectacle, for wave after wave of men could be seen advancing
without hesitation and without a break over a distance which in some places was
not less than 500 yards.</p>
<p>The Swansea men in the centre broke into the wood without a check, a
lieutenant of that battalion charging down two machine-guns and capturing both
at the cost of a wound to himself. The 13th on the right won their way also
into the wood, but were held for a time, and were reinforced by the 15th
(Carmarthens). Here for hours along the whole breadth of the wood the Welsh
infantry strove desperately to crawl or burst through the tangle of tree-trunks
in the face of the deadly and invisible machine-guns. Some of the 15th got
forward through a gap, but found themselves isolated, and had great difficulty
in joining up with their own battle line once more. Eventually, in the centre
and right, the three battalions formed a line just south of the most southern
cross ride from its junction with the main ride.</p>
<p>On the left, the 16th Welsh Fusiliers had lost heavily before reaching the
trees, their colonel, Garden, falling at the head of his men. The circumstances
of his death should be recorded. His Welsh Fusiliers, before entering action,
sang a hymn in Welsh, upon which the colonel addressed them, saying, "Boys,
make your peace with God! We are going to take that position, and some of us
won't come back. But we are going to take it." Tying his handkerchief to his
stick he added, "This will show you where I am." He was hit as he waved them on
with his impromptu flag; but he rose, advanced, was hit again, and fell
dead.</p>
<br>
<div align="center"><a id="map3" name="map3"><img src=
"12-Doyle-British-Campaign/H243-03.jpg" title="Mametz Wood"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Mametz Wood</p>
<br>
<p>Thickened by the support of the 15th Royal Welsh Fusiliers, the line rushed
on, and occupied the end of the wood until they were abreast of their comrades
on the right. Once among the trees, all cohesion was lost among the chaos of
tangled branches and splintered trunks, every man getting on as best he he
might, with officers rallying and leading forward small groups, who tripped and
scrambled onwards against any knot of Germans whom they could see. On this edge
of the wood some of the Fusiliers bombed their way along Strip Trench, which
outlines the south-western edge, in an endeavour to join hands with the 50th
Brigade on their left. At about 6:30 the south end of the wood had been
cleared, and the Welshmen, flushed with success, were swarming out at the
central ride. A number of prisoners, some hale, some wounded, had been taken.
At 7 o'clock the 113th were in touch with the 114th on the right, and with the
50th on the left.</p>
<p>Further advance was made difficult by the fact that the fire from the
untaken Wood Support Trench upon the left swept across the ride. The losses of
the two Fusilier battalions had been so heavy that they were halted while their
comrades of the 13th Royal Welsh Fusiliers, under Colonel Flower, who was
killed by a shell, attacked Wood Support&mdash;eventually capturing the gun
which had wrought such damage, and about 50 Germans. This small body had
succeeded, as so often before and since, in holding up a Brigade and
disorganising an advance. Until the machine-gun is checkmated by the
bullet-proof advance, the defensive will maintain an overpowering and
disproportionate advantage.</p>
<p>The 10th Welsh had now come up to reinforce the left of the 114th Brigade,
losing their colonel, Rickets, as they advanced into the wood. The 19th Welsh
Pioneer Battalion also came forward to consolidate what had been won. There was
a considerable pause in the advance, during which two battalions &mdash; the
17th Welsh Fusiliers and the 10th South Wales Borderers from the Reserve
Brigade, 115th&mdash;came up to thicken the line. At about four, the attack was
renewed, until at least two-thirds of the wood had been gained. The South Wales
Borderers worked up the eastern side, pushing the defenders into the open,
where they were shot down by British machine-guns in Caterpillar Wood and
Marlborough Wood. About 50 yards from the northern end the khaki line was at
last held up and remained there, crouching in shell-holes or behind broken
trunks. The main resistance came from a trench outside the wood, and it was
eventually determined to bombard it, for which purpose the troops were
withdrawn some hundreds of yards. Late in the evening there was another gallant
attempt to get the edge of the wood, but the trench was as venomous as ever,
and the main German second line behind it was sweeping the underwood with
bullets, so the advance was halted for the night.</p>
<p>During the night the 115th Brigade had come to the front, and in the morning
of July 11 had relieved the 113th and 114th Brigades. The relief in a thick
wood, swept by bullets, and upon a dark night in the close presence of a
formidable enemy, was a most difficult operation. The morning was spent in
reconnaissance, and it was only at 3. 15 P.M. that the advance could be made
upon the main German defence, a trench just outside the north end of the wood.
About 4 o'clock the Brigade swept on, and after a sharp bayonet fight gained
the trench towards the north-east, but the Germans still held the centre and
swept with their fire the portion in our possession. The 11th South Wales
Borderers (2nd Gwents) held on splendidly, in spite of their heavy losses. The
situation was now such, with only 300 yards to go to reach the German second
line, that it was deemed well to relieve the Thirty-eighth Division by the
Twenty-first Division, who had been selected for the coming battle. This change
was carried out by the morning of July 12.</p>
<p>The action of the Thirty-eighth Division in capturing Mametz Wood had been a
very fine one, and the fruit of their victory was not only an important
advance, but 398 prisoners, one field gun, three heavy guns, a howitzer and a
number of smaller pieces. It was the largest wood in the Somme district, and
the importance attached to it by the Germans may be gathered from the fact that
men of five different German regiments, the 3rd Lehr, 16th Bavarians, 77th,
83rd, and 122nd, were identified among our opponents. Among many instances of
individual valour should be mentioned that of a colonel of the Divisional
Staff, who twice, revolver in hand, led the troops on where there was some
temporary check or confusion. It is impossible to imagine anything more
difficult and involved than some of this fighting, for apart from the abattis
and other natural impediments of a tangled wood, the place was a perfect
rabbit-warren of trenches, and had occasional land mines in it, which were
exploded&mdash;some of them prematurely, so that it was the retreating Germans
who received the full force of the blast. Burning petrol was also used
continually in the defence, and frequently proved to be a two-edged weapon.
Some of the garrison stood to their work with extraordinary courage, and
nothing but the most devoted valour upon the part of their assailants could
have driven them out. "Every man of them was killed where he stood," said a
Welsh Fusilier, in of the describing the resistance of one group. "They refused
offers of quarter right to the last, and died with cheers for the Kaiser or
words of defiance on their lips. They were brave men, and we were very sorry
indeed to have to kill them, for we could not but admire them for their
courage." Such words give honour both to victors and vanquished. The German
losses were undoubtedly very heavy&mdash;probably not less than those of the
Welsh Division.</p>
<p>Though the Welsh Division had overrun Mametz Wood from south to north, there
was still one angle in the north-west which had lain out of their course, and
had not been taken by them. This part of the wood was occupied upon the evening
of July 11 by the 62nd Brigade of the Twenty-first Division, which had already
performed such notable services upon the Somme. Eight field-guns were
discovered in this part of the wood and were captured by the Brigade.</p>
<p>The situation had now greatly improved for the Seventeenth Division in front
of Quadrangle Support, for not only was Mametz Wood mostly in the hands of the
Welsh, but the Twenty-third Division on the left, who after their temporary
check at Contalmaison had fallen back upon the line Peake Alley &mdash;Birch
Tree Wood&mdash;Shelter Wood, now came forward again and occupied Bailiff Wood
upon the north of Contalmaison. Under these circumstances, the 50th Brigade
upon the right again attempted to get forward in order to keep level with the
Welsh in the wood. Connection had not yet been made at that point, however, and
the 7th East Yorks, who were the leading battalion, suffered heavy losses
before being compelled to abandon the attempt.</p>
<p>Victory, however, was at last coming to reward the living and vindicate the
dead. At four in the afternoon of July 10, the Twenty-third Division advanced
from Bailiff Wood for its second assault upon Contalmaison. This time
everything went to perfection, and the much-enduring infantry were able to take
possession of the village, while a counter-attack by the third Reserve Division
of the Prussian Guards came under concentrated artillery fire, and was
completely disorganised and destroyed. It was the wounded of the Guard from
this attack who were seen at Potsdam, and described by Mr. Curtin, the American
journalist, in one of the most brilliant articles of the War. Carried into
furniture vans, they were conveyed to their hospitals with every secrecy, in
order to conceal from the populace the results of the encounter between the
famous Corps and those men of the New Army who for more than a year had been
the favourite butt of the <i>Witz-Bl&auml;tter</i> of Berlin. Old Father Time
has a humour of his own, and his laugh is usually the last. Besides the Guard
the 70th Jaeger and the 110th, 114th, and 119th Regiments were included in this
defeat.</p>
<p>The two bastions having fallen, the problem of the Quadrangle Support became
a very different one, and the 51st Brigade, joining up with the right of the
Twenty-third Division in the evening, was able to get hold of the left end of
it. Even now, however, the Germans fought hard to the right, and both the 7th
East Yorks and the 6th Dorsets had to push strongly before they could win
through. They were encouraged in their efforts when, in the waning light, they
were able to see small bodies of the enemy retiring in the distance out of the
fringe of the wood. By ten o'clock that night the long task had been
accomplished, and the dead might sleep in peace, for Quadrangle Support was in
the hands of the Seventeenth Division. They were relieved by the Twenty-first
Division upon July 11.</p>
<p>At or about the same time as the relief of the Seventeenth Division, the
Twenty-third upon their left were also relieved, their line being taken over by
the First Division. Since the capture of Contalmaison and the heavy repulse of
the German Guard Division the British had made further progress, so that both
Pearl Wood and Contalmaison Villa to the north of the village were firmly in
their hands. The instructions to the First Division were to endeavour to
improve this advantage, and an advance was at once made which, occurring as it
did upon the night of July 15, may be best described under the heading which
treats of the breaking of the second German line.</p>
<p>Having dealt with the operations upon the left and those in the centre of
the intermediate German position, we will now turn to those upon the right,
which are concerned with the Eighteenth and the Thirtieth Divisions, supported
by the Ninth. After the fall of Montauban, these Divisions advanced, the one
upon Caterpillar Wood, and the other to Bernafoy Wood, both of which were
occupied. For the occupation of Bernafoy Wood the 27th Brigade of the Ninth
Division had been put at the disposal of the commander of the Thirtieth, and
this force occupied the position without much loss, but were exposed afterwards
to a most deadly shell-fire, which caused heavy losses to the two front
battalions&mdash;the 6th King's Own Scottish Borderers and the the 6th Scots
Rifles. The wood was held, however, together with three guns, which were found
within it. On July 5 the Thirtieth Division handed over that line to the Ninth.
On that date they sustained the heavy loss of Colonels Trotter and
Smith&mdash;both killed by distant shell-fire.</p>
<p>The rest of the Thirtieth Division only lasted for a very few days, and upon
July 7 they were facing the enemy position from Malzhorn Farm upon the right to
Trones Wood upon the left, and were about to be initiated in that terrible wood
fighting which cost us so dear. There is no fighting in the world which is more
awesome to the mind and more exhausting to the body than such combats as these
amid the ghostly atmosphere of ruined woods, with Death lurking in the shadows
on every hand, and the thresh of the shells beating without cessation by night
and by day. Trones, Mametz, High Wood, Delville &mdash;never has the quiet,
steadfast courage of the British soldier been put to a more searching test than
in those haunts of gloom and horror. In the case of Trones Wood some account
must be given of the peculiar tactical difficulties of the situation, and then
we shall turn to the sombre but glorious narrative of the successive
attacks.</p>
<p>The tactical problem was a remarkable one. The wood was connected up on the
German side by good lines of trenches with Malzhorn Farm on the south, with
Guillemont on the east, and with Waterlot Farm on the north&mdash;each of these
points being from 400 to 700 yards away. It was also commanded by a large
number of heavy guns. The result was that if the British stormers held the wood
in strength, they were shelled out with heavy losses. If, on the other hand,
the wood were lightly held, then the German infantry pouring in from the east
and north could drive them out. The British, on the other hand, had no trenches
leading up to the wood, though in other respects the Germans found the same
difficulties in holding the place that they did. It was a terrible contest in
tenacity between the infantry of the two nations, and if in the end the British
won it must at least be admitted that there was no evidence of any
demoralisation among the Germans on account of the destruction of their main
line. They fought well, were well led, and were admirably supported by their
guns.</p>
<p>The first attack upon Trones Wood was carried out from the south upon July 8
by the 21st Brigade. There was no suspicion then of the strength of the German
position, and the attack was repulsed within a couple of hours, the 2nd Yorks
being the chief sufferers.</p>
<p>There was more success upon the right of the line where the French were
attacking Malzhorn Farm. A company of the 2nd Wilts made their way successfully
to help our Allies, and gained a lodgment in the German trenches which connect
Malzhorn Farm with the south end of Trones Wood. With the aid of some of the
19th Manchesters this position was extended, and two German counter attacks
were crushed by rifle- fire. The position in this southern trench was
permanently held, and it acted like a self-registering gauge for the combat in
Trones Wood, for when the British held the wood the whole Southern Trench was
British, while a German success in the wood always led to a contraction in the
holding of the trench.</p>
<p>At one o'clock upon July 8 the 21st Brigade renewed their attempt, attacking
with the 2nd Wiltshires in the lead from the side of Bernafoy Wood. The advance
was a fine one, but Colonel Gillson was badly wounded, and his successor in
command. Captain Mumford, was killed. About three o'clock the 18th and 19th
Manchesters came up in support. German bombers were driving down from the
north, and the fighting was very severe. In the evening some of the Liverpools
came up to strengthen the line, and it was determined to draw out the weakened
21st, and replace it by the 90th Brigade. At the same time a party of the 2nd
Scots Fusiliers of this Brigade took over Malzhorn Trench, and rushed the
farmhouse itself, capturing 67 prisoners. The whole of the trench was
afterwards cleared up with two machine-guns and 100 more prisoners. It was a
fine bit of work, worthy of that splendid battalion.</p>
<p>Upon July 9 at 6.40 A.M. began the third attack upon Trones Wood led by the
17th Manchesters. They took over the footing already held, and by eight o'clock
they had extended it along the eastern edge, practically clearing the wood of
German infantry. There followed, however, a terrific bombardment, which caused
such losses that the 17th and their comrades of the 18th were ordered to fall
back once more, with the result that the Scots Fusiliers had to give up the
northern end of their Malzhorn Trench. An enemy counter-attack at 4:30 P.M. had
no success. A fresh British attack (the fourth) was at once organised, and
carried out by the 16th Manchesters, who at 6.40 P.M. got into the south end of
the wood once more, finding a scattered fringe of their comrades who had held
on there. Some South African Highlanders from the Ninth Division came up to
help them during the night. This fine battalion lost many men, including their
colonel, Jones, while supporting the attack from Bernafoy Wood. In the morning
the position was better, but a gap had been left between the Manchesters in the
wood and the Scots in the trench, through which the enemy made their way. After
much confused fighting and very heavy shelling, the evening of July 10 found
the wood once more with the Germans.</p>
<p>In the early morning of July 11 the only remaining British Brigade, the
89th, took up the running. At 3:50 the 2nd Bedfords advanced to the attack.
Aided by the 19th King's Liverpools, the wood was once again carried and
cleared of the enemy, but once again a terrific shell-fall weakened the troops
to a point where they could not resist a strong attack. The Bedfords fought
magnificently, and had lost 50 per cent of their effectives before being
compelled to withdraw their line. The south-east corner of the wood was carried
by the swarming enemy, but the south-west corner was still in the hands of our
utterly weary and yet tenacious infantry. At 9:30 the same evening the 17th
King's Liverpools pushed the Germans back once more, and consolidated the
ground won at the southern end. So the matter stood when the exhausted division
was withdrawn for a short rest, while the Eighteenth Division took up their
difficult task. The Lancashire men had left it unfinished, but their conduct
had been heroic, and they had left their successors that one corner of
consolidated ground which was needed as a jumping-off place for a successful
attack.</p>
<p>It was the 55th Brigade of the Eighteenth Division which first came up to
take over the fighting line. A great responsibility was placed upon the general
officer commanding, for the general attack upon the German line had been fixed
for July 14, and it was impossible to proceed with it until the British held
securely the covering line upon the flank. Both Trones Wood and the Malzhorn
Trench were therefore of much more than local importance, so that when Haig
found himself at so late a date as July 12 without command of this position, it
was a very serious matter which might have far-reaching consequences. The
orders now were that within a day, at all costs, Trones Wood must be in British
hands, and to the 55th, strengthened by two battalions of the 54th Brigade, was
given the desperate task. The situation was rendered more difficult by the
urgency of the call, which gave the leaders no time in which to get acquainted
with the ground.</p>

<p class="caption">Trones Wood: Attack of 54th Brigade, July 13, 1916</p>
<br>
<p>The German defence had become a strong one. They had formed three strong
points, marked S1, S2, and S3 in the Diagram, p. 141. These, together with
several trenches, dotted here and there, broke up every attack, and when once
order was broken it was almost impossible in the tangle and obscurity for the
troops to preserve any cohesion or direction. Those troops which penetrated
between the strong points found themselves with the enemy in their rear and
were in a disorganised condition, which was only overcome by the individual
bravery of the men, who refused to be appalled by the difficult situation in
which they found themselves. The attack of the 55th Brigade was made from of
the the sunken road immediately south of the wood, and it ran at once into so
heavy a barrage that it lost heavily before it had reached even the edge of its
objective. The 7th West Kents, who formed the attacking force, were not to be
denied, however, and they pushed forward through a deepening gloom, for it was
seven in the evening before the signal had been given. Whilst the Kents fought
up from the south, the Queen's Surreys attempted to wan a lodgment on the
north-west where the Longueval Alley led up from Bernafoy Wood. They also
suffered heavily from the barrage, and only a few brave men reached the top of
the wood and held on there for some hours. The West Kents passed the line of
strong points and then lost touch with each other, until they had resolved
themselves into two or three separate groups holding together as best they
could in the darkness with the enemy all round them, and with the
communications cut behind them. The telephone wires had all been broken by the
barrage, and the anxious commanders could only know that the attack had failed,
that no word came back from the front, and that a British battalion had been
swallowed up by the wood.</p>
<p>The orders were peremptory, however, that the position should be taken, and
General Maxse, without hesitation, threw a second of his brigades into the
dangerous venture. It was the 54th Brigade which moved to the attack. It was
just past midnight when the soldiers went. forward. The actual assault was
carried out from south to north, on the same line as the advance of the West
Kents. The storming battalions were the 6th Northamptons and 12th Middlesex,
the former to advance direct through the and the latter to clean up behind them
and to form a defensive flank on the right.</p>
<p>The attack was a fine feat of arms. Though heavily hit by the barrage, the
Northamptons, closely followed by two companies of the Middlesex, pushed their
way into the wood and onwards. It was pitch dark, and the men were stumbling
continually over the fallen trees and the numerous dead bodies which lay among
the undergrowth. None the less, they kept touch, and plodded steadily onwards.
The gallant Clark was shot, but another officer led the Northamptons against
the central strong point, for it had been wisely determined to leave no enemy
in the rear. Shortly after dawn on July 14 this point was carried, and the
Northamptons were able to get forward. By 8 o'clock the wood was full of
scattered groups of British infantry, but the situation was so confused that
the colonel went forward and rallied them into a single line which formed
across the wood. This line advanced until it came level with the strong point S
3, which was captured. A number of the enemy then streamed out of the eastern
side of the wood, making for Guillemont. These men came under British
machine-gun fire and lost heavily. The remaining strong point at S1 had been
taken by a mixed group of Buffs and Middlesex about 9 A.M. These three strong
points having been occupied, the whole wood was now swept clear and was
permanently occupied, though still subjected to very heavy shell fire by the
enemy. Thus, the right flank of the army was covered, and the important
operations of July 14 were enabled to go forward without danger of the of
molestation. Of the two gallant battalions who mainly achieved this important
result, the losses of the Northamptons were about 300, and of the Middlesex
about half that amount.</p>
<p>There was an epilogue which was as honourable to the troops concerned as the
main attack had been. This concerns the fate of the men of West Kent, who, as
will be remembered, had been cut off in the wood. The main body of these, under
the regimental adjutant, together with a few men of the Queen's, formed a small
defensive position and held out in the hope of relief. They were about 200 all
told, and their position seemed so hopeless that every excuse might have been
found for surrender. They held out all night, however, and in the morning they
were successfully relieved by the advance of the 54th Brigade. It is true that
no severe attack was made upon them during the night, but their undaunted front
may have had something to do with their immunity. Once, in the early dawn, a
German officer actually came up to them under the impression that they were his
own men&mdash;his last mistake upon earth. It is notable that the badges of six
different German regiments were found in the wood, which seemed to indicate
that it was held by picked men or volunteers from many units. "To the death!"
was their password for the night, and to their honour be it said that they were
mostly true to it. So also were the British stormers, of whom Sir Henry
Rawlinson said: "The night attack on and final capture of Trones Wood were
feats of arms which will rank high among the best achievements of the British
Army."</p>
<p>An account of this fortnight of desperate and almost continuous fighting is
necessarily concerned chiefly with the deeds of the infantry, but it may fitly
end with a word as to the grand work of the artillery, without whom in modern
warfare all the valour and devotion of the foot-soldier are but a useless
self-sacrifice. Nothing could exceed the endurance and the technical efficiency
of the gunners. No finer tribute could be paid them than that published at the
time from one of their own officers, which speaks with heart and with
knowledge: "They worked their guns with great accuracy and effect without a
moment's cessation by day or by night for ten days, and I don't believe any
artillery have ever had a higher or a longer test or have done it more
splendidly. And these gunners, when the order came that we must pull out and go
with the infantry&mdash;do you think they were glad or willing? Devil a bit!
They were sick as muck and only desired to stay on and continue killing Boches.
And these men a year ago not even soldiers&mdash;much less gunners! Isn't it
magnificent&mdash;and is it not enough to make the commander of such men
uplifted?" No cold and measured judgment of the historian can ever convey their
greatness with the conviction produced by one who stood by them in the thick of
the battle and rejoiced in the manhood of those whom he had himself trained and
led.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap6" name="chap6">VI. THE BATTLE
OF THE SOMME<br>
The Breaking of the Second Line. July 14, 1916</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">The great night advance&mdash;The Leicester Brigade at
Bazentin&mdash;Assault by Seventh Division&mdash;Success of the Third
Division&mdash;Desperate fight of Ninth Division at Longueval &mdash;
Operations of First Division on flank&mdash;Cavalry advance</p>
<p class="first">WITH the fall of Mametz Wood, the impending capture of Trones
Wood upon the right, and the close investment of Ovillers upon the left flank,
the army could now face the second line of German defences. The ground in front
of them sloped gently upwards until it reached the edge of a rolling plateau.
Upon this edge were three villages: Little Bazentin upon the left, Grand
Bazentin upon the centre, and Longueval upon the right, all nestling among
orchards and flanked by woods. Through these lay the enemy's position,
extending to Pozi&egrave;res upon the one side, and through Guillemont to the
French junction on the other. These two flanks were for the time to be
disregarded, and it was determined to strike a heavy frontal blow which would,
as it was hoped, crush in the whole middle of their line, leaving the sides to
be dealt with at our leisure. It was a most formidable obstacle, for all three
villages were as strong as the German sappers could make them, and were
connected up with great lines of trenches, the whole front which was to be
attacked covering about 6000 yards. A small wood screened Little Bazentin on
the left, while behind Longueval, facing the right attack, was a larger
plantation which, under the name of Delville Wood, has won for itself a
terrible and glorious name in British military history.</p>
<p>The heavy guns had been advanced and the destruction of the German wire and
trenches had begun upon July 11. On the evening of the 13th the troops mustered
for the battle. They were all divisions which had already been heavily engaged,
and some of them had endured losses in the last fortnight which might have
seemed to be sufficient to put them out of action. None the less they were not
only eager for the fight, but they were, as it proved, capable of performing
the most arduous and delicate of all operations, a night march in the face of
the enemy. More than a thousand yards of clear ground lay at many points
between the British outposts and the German trenches. To cover it in daylight
meant, as they had so often learned, a heavy loss. It was ordered, therefore,
that the troops should move up to within striking distance in the darkness, and
dash home with the first glimmer of morning light. There was no confusion, no
loss of touch as 25,000 stormers took up their stations, and so little sound
that the Germans seem to have been unaware of the great gathering in their
immediate front. It was ticklish work, lying for hours within point-blank range
with no cover, but the men endured it as best they might. With the first faint
dawn the long line sprang to their feet and with a cheer dashed forward at the
German trenches, while the barrage rose and went roaring to eastward whence
help might come to the hard-pressed German defence.</p>
<p>On the extreme left of the section attacked was the First Regular Division,
which took no part in the actual advance but held the flank in the
neighbourhood of Contalmaison Villa, and at one period of the day sent forward
its right-hand battalion, the 1st North Lancashires, to aid their neighbours in
the fight.</p>
<p>The left of the line of actual attack was formed by the Twenty-first
Division opposite to Bazentin-le-Petit. This attack was carried out upon a
single brigade front, and the Brigade in question was the 110th from the
Thirty-seventh Division. This division made no appearance as a unit in the
Battle of the Somme, but was several times engaged in its separate brigades. On
this occasion the 110th, consisting entirely of men of Leicester, took the
place of the 63rd Brigade, much reduced by previous fighting. Their immediate
objective was the north end of Bazentin-le-Petit village and the whole of the
wood of that name. Led by the 8th and 9th Leicesters the brigade showed, as has
so often been shown before, that the British soldier never fights better than
in his first engagement. Owing to the co-operation of the First Division and to
a very effective smoke screen upon their left, their advance was not attended
with heavy loss in the earlier stages, and they were able to flow over the open
and into the trenches opposite, capturing some 500 prisoners. They continued to
fight their way with splendid steadiness through the wood and held it for the
remainder of the day. Their greatest trouble came from a single German
strong-point which was 200 yards away from the corner of the wood, and,
therefore, beyond their objective. The machine-guns in this redoubt caused
great loss whenever the edge of the wood was approached. This strong-point was
destroyed next day, but meanwhile the position was consolidated and was firmly
held for the next four days, after which the division was withdrawn for a
rest.</p>
<p>On the right of the Twenty-first Division lay the Seventh Division, to which
had been assigned the assault of the Bazentin-le-Petit village. The leading
brigade was the 20th, and the storming battalions, the 8th Devons and 2nd
Borders, crept up to their mark in the darkness of a very obscure night. At
3.25 the barrage was lifted, and so instantaneous was the attack that there was
hardly an interval between the last of the shrapnel and the first of the
stormers. The whole front line was captured in an instant, and the splendid
infantry rushed on without a pause to the second line, springing into the
trenches once more at the moment that the gunners raised their pieces. In ten
minutes both of these powerful lines had fallen. Several dug-outs were found to
be crammed with the enemy, including the colonel of the Lehr Battalion, and
with the machine-guns which they had been unable to hoist into their places
before the wave had broken over them. When these were cleared, the advance was
carried on into Bazentin-le-Grand Wood, which was soon occupied from end to
end. A line in front of the wood was taken up and consolidated.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the 22nd Brigade had taken up the work, the 2nd Warwicks
pushing forward and occupying, without any opposition from the disorganised
enemy, the Circus Trench, while the 2nd of the Royal Irish advanced to the
attack of the village of Bazentin-le-Petit. Their leading company rushed the
position with great dash, capturing the colonel commanding the garrison, and
about 100 of his men. By 7:30 the place was in their hands, and the leading
company had pushed into a trench on the far side of it, getting into touch with
the Leicesters on their left.</p>
<p>The Germans were by no means done with, however, and they were massing
thickly to the north and north-east of the houses where some scattered orchards
shrouded their numbers and their dispositions. As the right of the brigade
seemed to be in the air, a brave sergeant of the 2nd Warwicks set off to
establish touch with the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, who formed the left unit
of the Third Division upon the right. As he returned he spotted a German
machine-gun in a cellar, entered it, killed the gunner, and captured four guns.
The wings of the two divisions were then able to co-operate and to clear the
ground in front of them.</p>
<p>The Irishmen in the advance were still in the air, however, having got well
ahead of the line, and they were now assailed by a furious fire from High
"Wood, followed by a determined infantry assault. This enfilade fire caused
heavy losses, and the few survivors of those who garrisoned the exposed trench
were withdrawn to the shelter afforded by the outskirts of the village. There
and elsewhere the Lewis guns had proved invaluable, for every man of
intelligence in the battalion had been trained to their use, and in spite of
gunners being knocked out, there was never any lack of men to take their place.
The German counter-attack pushed on, however, and entered the village, which
was desperately defended not only by the scattered infantrymen who had been
driven back to it, but also by the consolidating party from the 54th Field
Company Royal Engineers and half the 24th Manchester Pioneer Battalion. At this
period of the action a crowd of men from various battalions had been driven
down to the south end of the village in temporary disorganisation due to the
rapidity of the advance and the sudden severity of the counterattack. These men
were re- formed by the adjutant of the Irish, and were led by him against the
advancing Germans, whom they drove back with the bayonet, finally establishing
themselves on the northern edge of Bazentin-le-Petit Wood, which they held
until relieved later by the 2nd Gordons of the 20th Brigade. At the same time
the village itself was cleared by the 2nd Warwicks, while the 1st Welsh
Fusiliers drove the Germans out of the line between the windmill and the
cemetery. The trench held originally by the Irish was retaken, and in it was
found a British officer, who had been badly wounded and left for a time in the
hands of the enemy. He reported that they would not dress him, and prodded at
him with their bayonets, but that an officer had stopped them from killing him.
No further attempt was made by the Germans to regain the position of Bazentin.
The losses, especially those of the Royal Irish, had been very heavy during the
latter part of the engagement.</p>
<p>Much had been done, but the heavy task of the Seventh Division was not yet
at an end. At 3:20 P.M. the reserve Brigade (91st) were ordered to attack the
formidable obstacle of High Wood, the 100th Brigade of the Thirty-third
Division (Landon) co-operating from the left side, while a handful of cavalry
from the 7th Dragoon Guards and 20th Deccan Horse made an exhilarating, if
premature, appearance upon the right flank, to which some allusion is made at
the end of this chapter. The front line of the 91st Brigade, consisting of the
2nd Queen's Surrey and 1st South Staffords, marched forward in the traditional
style of the British line, taking no notice of an enfilade fire from the Switch
Trench, and beating back a sortie from the wood. At the same time the Brigadier
of the 100th Brigade upon the left pushed forward his two leading battalions,
the 1st Queen's Surrey and the 9th Highland Light Infantry, to seize and hold
the road which led from High Wood to Bazentin-le-Petit. This was done in the
late evening of July 14, while their comrades of the Seventh Division
successfully reached the south end of the wood, taking three field guns and 100
prisoners. The Queen's and part of the Highland Light Infantry were firmly in
possession of the connecting road, but the right flank of the Highlanders was
held up owing to the fact that the north-west of the wood was still in the
hands of the enemy and commanded their advance. We will return to the situation
which developed in this part of the field during the succeeding days after we
have taken a fuller view of the doings upon the rest of the line during the
battle of July 14. It may be said here, however, that the facility with which a
footing was established in High Wood proved to be as fallacious as the parallel
case of Mametz Wood, and that many a weary week was to pass, and many a brave
man give his heart's blood, before it was finally to be included in the British
lines. For the present, it may be stated that the 91st Brigade could not hold
the wood because it was enfiladed by the uncaptured Switch Trench, and that
they therefore retired after dusk on the 15th.</p>
<p>To return to the story of the main battle. The centre of the attack was
carried out by the Third Division, one of the most famous units in the Army,
though it now only retained three of the veteran battalions which had held the
line at Mons. The task of the Third Division was to break the centre of the
German line from Grand Bazentin upon the left where it touched the Seventh to
Longueval on the right where it joined with the Ninth Division. The 8th Brigade
was on the right, the 9th upon the left, while the 76th was in support. The
attacking troops advanced in the darkness in fours, with strong patrols in
front, and deployed within 200 yards of the German wire, capturing a German
patrol which blundered into their ranks. Upon the word being given at the first
faint gleam of dawn, the leading battalions trudged forward in the slow,
determined fashion which had been found to be more effective than the
spectacular charge. From the left the front line consisted of the 12th West
Yorkshires, the 13th King's Liverpools, the 7th Shropshires, and the 8th East
Yorks. The wire upon the right was found to be very partially cut, and the line
of stormers was held up under a murderous fire. There were gaps here and there,
however, so that the colonel at the head of his Shropshires was able to force a
passage at one point, while two gallant platoons of the East Yorkshires got
through at another, and pushed boldly on into the German line. The main body,
however, were forced for a time to take cover and keep up a fire upon the
enemies' heads as they peered occasionally from over the parapets.</p>
<p>The left brigade had been more fortunate, finding the wire to be well cut.
The front trench was not strongly held, and was easily carried. Both the King's
Liverpools and the West Yorkshires got through, but as they had separated in
the advance the greater part of the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers were thrust
into the gap and restored the line. These men, supported by Stokes guns,
carried the village of Grand Bazentin by 6:30 A.M. There was a deadly fire from
the Grand Bazentin Wood upon the left, but as the Seventh Division advanced
this died away, and the 12th West Yorkshires were able to get round to the
north edge of the village, but could get no farther on account of the hold-up
of the 8th Brigade upon the right. There was a considerable delay, but at last
by 1 P.M. a renewed bombardment had cut the wires, and strong bombing parties
from the supporting battalions, the 2nd Royal Scots and 1st Scots Fusiliers,
worked down the front trench from each end. The whole brigade was then able to
advance across the German front line, which was at once consolidated.</p>
<p>The losses in this attack had been heavy, the 12th West Yorkshires alone
having 15 officers, including their colonel, and 350 men out of action. The
results, however, were solid, as not only was the whole front of the German
position crushed in, but 36 officers with 650 men were taken, together with
four small howitzers, four field-guns, and fourteen machine-guns. A
counter-attack was inevitable and consolidation was pushed forward with furious
energy. "Every one was digging like madmen, all mixed up with the dead and the
dying." One counter-attack of some hundreds of brave men did charge towards
them in the afternoon, but were scattered to the winds by a concentration of
fire. The position was permanently held.</p>
<p>The Ninth Division was on the immediate right of the Third, facing
Longueval, a straggling village which lay against the sinister background of
Delville Wood. The Division was, as will be remembered, the first of the new
armies, and had distinguished itself greatly at Loos. It had been entirely a
Highland Division, but it had undergone a picturesque change by the
substitution of the South African Infantry Brigade in place of the 28th. The
attack upon Longueval was carried out by the 26th Brigade, the 8th Black Watch
and 10th Argyll and Sutherlands in the lead, with the 9th Seaforths in support
and the 5th ,Camerons in reserve. The advance was so fine as to rouse the
deepest admiration from an experienced French officer who observed it. "Who
would believe," he wrote, "that only a few months ago not one of these men knew
anything of the soldier's profession? They carried themselves as superbly as
the Old Guard. Once I was near enough to see their faces as they deployed for
attack under the devastating fire rained on them... Their teeth were set and
their eyes were fixed firmly on the goal towards which they were advancing.
They were determined to achieve their object, and nothing but death would stop
them... Only those who were seriously hit thought of dropping out. The others
pressed proudly on, regardless of the pain they suffered, and took part in the
final charge in which the enemy were driven from the position." Such a of the
tribute from a soldier to soldiers is indeed a glory.</p>
<p>The village and the trenches around it were taken with a splendid rush, but
the fighting among the houses was of a desperate character, "more so," says the
same observer, "than any I had seen before." The Germans refused to give or
take quarter. When the Highlanders broke the line they cut off those who held
the trench. The officer in command offered quarter. The German commander
refused. "I and my men," he replied, "have orders to defend this ground with
our lives. German soldiers know how to obey orders. We thank you for your
offer, but we die where we stand." When the Highlanders finally took possession
of the trench, all but a mere handful of the defenders were dead. It is
episodes like this which would make us ready to take a German by the hand if it
were not that his country's hand is red with innocent blood.</p>
<p>The defence was not everywhere equally desperate. As the Highlanders dashed
past the trenches and into the scattered group of houses which marked the
village, grey figures darted round corners, or rushed out with hands to heaven.
Many prisoners were taken. Here and there groups of brave men sold their lives
dearly, especially in some ruins at the east end of the village. The blast of
fire from this place was so hot that for a moment the advance was staggered;
but a brave piper ran to the front, and the joyous lilt of "The Campbells are
coming" sent the clansmen flooding onwards once more. Neither bullets, bombs,
nor liquid fire could stop them, and the last German was stabbed or shot amid
the broken walls of his shattered fort.</p>
<p>The main part or west of Longueval was now in the hands of the Scotsmen, but
the place is peculiarly shaped, tailing away in a thin line to the northwards,
the scattered houses in that direction being commanded by the wood, which runs
right up to them on their southern side. It was clear that no complete conquest
could be made until this wood also was in the hands of our stormers. The
operation was a difficult one, and far too large to be carried out upon that
day. The South African Brigade was therefore ordered up from Montauban, with
instructions that they should attack Delville Wood at dawn of July 15.</p>
<p>Here we may break off the narrative of the battle of July 14, though it is
difficult to do so, since these operations shade imperceptibly into each other,
and the fighting never really came to an end. The main results, however, had
become clear by that evening, and they amounted to a very great success,
unalloyed by any failure. Every division had carried its point and added to its
glories. Four villages, three woods, 6000 yards of front, and 2000 of depth had
been added to our lines. Two thousand more prisoners had been taken, bringing
the total for the fortnight to the substantial figure of 10,000; while twelve
heavy and forty-two field-guns had also been taken during that time. Above all,
the British had got their grip firmly upon the edge of the plateau, though many
a weary day of fighting was to follow before the tenacious enemy had been
driven from it, and the whole position was in British hands.</p>
<p>The reader is to understand clearly that though the operations of July 14
crushed in the face of the German line along the whole central position, the
flanks both to the right and to the left were still inviolate. Upon the German
right the whole range of powerful fortifications which extended through
Pozi&egrave;res to Thiepval were untouched, while upon the German left the
equally formidable line stretching from Longueval through Waterlot Farm and
Guillemont to Falfemont Farm was also intact. It is correct, then, to say that
the German second line had been stormed and penetrated, but it had not been
captured throughout its full extent, and the greater part of the autumn
campaign was to pass before this had been accomplished. The reduction of the
German right wing will be recounted in the chapters which deal with Gough's
army, to whom the task was assigned. That of the left wing is covered by the
narrative, which gives some details of the numerous, bloody, and protracted
attacks which ended in the capture of Guillemont.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a word may be said as to the operations of the First Division, who
had been upon the left of the attack upon July 14, and had covered that flank
without attempting an advance. Upon the night of July 15 they moved forward to
attack the continuation of the German second line system between the captured
Bazentin and the uncaptured Pozi&egrave;res. The attack was made by the 3rd
Brigade, the 2nd Munsters being to the left, the 1st South Wales Borderers to
the right, and the 1st Gloucesters in the centre with the 2nd Welsh in reserve.
No less than 1200 yards of No Man's Land had to be crossed, but this was the
more easy since both Pearl Wood and Contalmaison Villa were occupied. A daring
daylight reconnaissance by the colonel of the Gloucesters greatly helped the
advance. The men were marched silently in platoons along the road, and then
re-formed into line on the far side of the enemy's barrage, a manoeuvre which
in the darkness called for great steadiness and discipline, the line being
dressed on a shaded lamp in the wood. On the word the eager troops pushed on
with such speed that they crossed the German front trenches and were into the
second before their own barrage had properly lifted. Pushing forward again,
they were soon some hundreds of yards past their objective, where they halted
close to the formidable Switch Line, having occupied all of the second line
system in their front. Their formation was now so dense, and they were so close
to the German machine-guns, that there was a possibility of disaster, which was
increased by the Welsh Borderers losing direction and charging towards a body
of men whom they dimly saw in front of them, who proved to be the Gloucesters.
Fine restraint upon both sides prevented a catastrophe. Officers and men were
now keen to push on and to attack the Switch Line, from which flares were
rising; but prudence forbade the opening up of an entirely new objective, and
the men were drawn back to the captured German trenches. So ended a successful
and almost bloodless operation.</p>
<p>It has been stated in the account of the action of July 14 that at one stage
of the battle the cavalry advanced, but it was impossible to stop the
description of a large movement to follow the fortunes of this small tactical
stroke. None the less the matter was important, as being the first blood lost
or drawn by cavalry, as cavalry, since the early months of the War. The idea
was, that by a sudden move forward a small body of horse might establish itself
in advance of the general line, and occupy a position which it could hold until
the slower infantry came forward to take it over. This was actually done, and
the movement may therefore be claimed as a successful experiment. The two
detachments from the Deccan Horse and 7th Dragoon Guards galloped three miles
from the rear, so as to be under observation as short a time as possible,
passed swiftly through the lines of the astonished and jubilant infantry, and
riding right into the enemy's position upon our right centre, established
themselves in a strong point, and, aided by a friendly monoplane, beat off the
German attacks. The advance was at six in the evening, and it was able to hold
on until nightfall and to hand over in the early morning to the infantry. Some
40 Germans fell to lance or sabre, and a few were taken prisoners by the daring
cavaliers, who suffered somewhat heavily, as they might well expect to do in so
novel and desperate a venture.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII. THE
BATTLE OF THE SOMME<br>
July 14 to July 31</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Gradual advance of First Division&mdash;Hard fighting of
Thirty-third Division at High Wood&mdash;The South Africans in Delville
Wood&mdash;The great German counter-attack&mdash;Splendid work of 26th
Brigade&mdash;Capture of Delville Wood by 98th Brigade&mdash;Indecisive
fighting on the Guillemont front</p>
<p class="first">THE central fact of the situation after the battle of Bazentin
was that although the second German line had been broken, the gap made was
little more than three miles wide, and must be greatly extended upon of the
either flank before a general advance upon the third line could take place.
This meant that the left wing must push out in the Pozi&egrave;res direction,
and that the right wing must get Ginchy and Guillemont. For the time the
central British position was not an advantageous one, as it formed a long
salient bending from High Wood through Delville Wood to Guillemont, so placed
that it was open to direct observation all along, and exposed to converging
fire which could be directed with all the more accuracy as it was upon points
so well known to the Germans, into which the guns, communications, and reserves
were now crammed. Sir Douglas Haig's great difficulties were increased by a
long spell of wet and cloudy weather, which neutralised his advantages in the
air. Everything was against the British General except the excellence of his
artillery and the spirit of his troops.</p>
<p>The French upon the right, whose tally of guns and prisoners were up to date
higher than those of the British, had an equally hard front to attack,
including the four strong villages of Maurepas, Le Forest, Raucourt, and
Fregicourt, with many woods and systems of trenches. Their whole work in the
battle had been worthy of their military history, and could not be surpassed,
either in the dispositions of General Foch or in the valour of his men. Neither
their infantry nor ours had ever relinquished one square yard that they had
wrenched from the tight grip of the invader.</p>
<p>In each area of the battle of July 14 some pressing task was left to be
accomplished, and the fighting was very severe at certain points for some days
later. We shall first turn to the north of the line, where new divisions had
come into action. One of these already mentioned was the First Division. It was
indeed pleasing and reassuring to observe how many of the new divisional
generals were men whose names recalled good service as regimental officers.
Many who now wore the crossed swords upon their shoulders had been battalion
commanders in 1914. It is indeed well with an army when neither seniority nor
interest but good hard service upon the field of battle puts officers in charge
of the lives of men.</p>
<p>The First Division had taken the place of the Twenty-third after the fall of
Contalmaison, and had pushed its way up until it was level with the line of
their comrades on the right, whence in the manner described at the end of the
last chapter they drove their line forward upon July 15. On the 20th they
received a rebuff, however, the 1st Northants being held up by a very
formidable German trench called Munster Alley. The ground already gained was
consolidated, however, and the division lay with its left touching the
Australians on the right of Gough's army, and its right connected with the
Thirty-third Division, whose doings at High Wood will presently be considered.
For the purpose of continuity of narrative it will be best to continue with a
short summary of the doings of the First Division upon the left wing of the
advance, their general task being to hold that flank against German
counter-attacks, and to push forward wherever possible. It was continuous hard
work which, like so many of these operations, could gain little credit, since
there was no fixed point but only a maze of trenches in front of them. The
storming of a nameless ditch may well call for as high military virtue as the
taking of a historic village, and yet it seems a slighter thing in the lines of
a bulletin. Munster Alley and the great Switch Line faced the First Division,
two most formidable obstacles. On July 23, in the early morning, the 2nd
Brigade of the First Division attacked the Switch Line, in conjunction with the
Australians, on the left, and the Nineteenth Division to the right. The attack
was held up, Colonel Bircham of the 2nd Rifles and many officers and men being
killed. Colonel Bircham was a particularly gallant officer, who exposed himself
fearlessly upon every occasion, and it is on record that when remonstrated with
by his adjutant for his reckless disregard of danger, he answered, "You know as
well as I do where a colonel of the 60th ought to be." Such lives are an
example and such deaths an inspiration. Altogether the 2nd Rifles lost about
250 men in this night attack, and the other first line battalions&mdash;the 2nd
Sussex, 10th Gloucesters, and 1st Cameron Highlanders&mdash;were all hard hit.
The failure seems to have been partly due to misdirection in the dark.</p>
<p>Upon July 25 the 1st South Wales Borderers of the 3rd Brigade attacked
Munster Alley, but were again unable to get forward on account of the
machine-guns. Nothing daunted, the 2nd Welsh had another fling at Munster Alley
next day, and actually took it, but had not weight enough to consolidate and to
hold it. On the other hand, the British line was held inviolate, and a strong
German attack upon July 25 towards Pozi&egrave;res was repulsed with loss.</p>
<p>The Twenty-third Division relieved the First and were in turn relieved by
the Fifteenth in this sector, which faced the Switch Trench and Martinpuich.
The Switch Line was exposed to a very heavy fire for several days, at the end
of which it was attacked by this famous division, the same in number at least
as that which had left nearly two-thirds of its rank and file upon the bloody
slopes of Hill 70. On August 12 the advance was carried out with great dash:
the 45th Brigade upon the left and the 46th upon the right. The attack was only
partially successful, and the 46th Brigade was held up through the fact that
the Germans had themselves been in the act of attack, so that the trenches were
very strongly held. The operations continued, however, and the initial gains
were enlarged, until upon August 20 the whole Switch Line fell and was
permanently consolidated.</p>
<p>Leaving this left sector we must turn to the Thirty-third Division on its
right, two battalions of which had got forward on July 15, as far as the line
of the road connecting High Wood with Little Bazentin. The right flank of the
Highland Light Infantry had been held up by fire from this wood, and in the
evening the 91st Brigade of the Seventh Division had evacuated the southern
edge of the wood in order to allow of bombardment. That was the position on the
night of July 15.</p>
<p>The line of the road was held all night, and early next morning the advance
was ordered upon the German Switch Trench in front. It was hoped that the wood
had been cleared during the night, but in the morning the Highlanders found
themselves still galled by the continual fire upon their right. It was clear
that the attack could not go forward with such an impediment upon the
flank&mdash;one more instance of a brigade being held up by a handful of
concealed men. It was hoped that the enemy had been silenced, and the attack
was made, but no sooner had it developed than a murderous fire burst from the
wood, making it impossible for the Highlanders to get along farther than the
road. The 1st Queen's, however, being farther from the wood were able to get on
to the Switch Trench, but found it heavily wired and stiff with men. Such a
battalion does not take "No" easily, and their colonel, with a large proportion
of their officers and men, was stretched in front of the fatal wire before it
became evident that further perseverance would mean destruction. The 16th
Rifles and half the 2nd Worcesters, the remaining battalions of the 100th
Brigade, were brought up, but not further advance was possible until the wire
could be cut by the guns. About four in the afternoon of July 16 the remains of
the brigade were back in the road from which they had started. The attack had
failed, partly from the enfilade fire of High Wood, partly from the impassable
wire.</p>
<p>The 98th Brigade was on the left of the 100th, filling up the gap to
Bazentin village. They had extended their right in order to help their sorely
tried comrades, and they had themselves advanced upon the line of the Switch
Trench&mdash;the 1st Middlesex leading, with the 4th Suffolk in support. The
2nd Argyll and Sutherlands with the 4th King's Liverpool were in reserve. They
got well forward, but ceased their advance when it was found that no progress
could be made upon the right. Thus, for the time, the division was brought to a
stand. That night the 19th Brigade relieved the 100th, which had been very hard
hit in this action. After the change the 1st Scottish Rifles and the 20th Royal
Fusiliers formed the front line of the 19th Brigade, the Rifles in touch with
the 22nd Brigade of the 7th upon their right, while the Fusiliers were in touch
with the 98th Brigade upon their left.</p>
<p>The general situation did not admit of an immediate attack, and the Germans
took advantage of the pause to strengthen and slightly to advance their
position. On July 17 the hard-worked Twenty-first Division upon the left was
drawn out, and both the Thirty-third and Seventh had to extend their fronts. On
the other hand, the First Division came in upon the left and occupied a portion
of the Bazentin-le-Petit Wood. The position at that time was roughly that the
Seventh Division covered the front from High Wood to Bazentin Grand, the
Thirty-third Division from Bazentin Grand to Bazentin Petit, the First was from
their left to Pozi&egrave;res.</p>
<p>Upon July 18 there was a very heavy German attack upon Delville Wood, which
is treated elsewhere. This was accompanied by a severe barrage fire upon the
Bazentins and upon Mametz Wood, which continued all day. That night the
Nineteenth Division came into line, taking over Bazentin Petit, both village
and wood. The Thirty-third Division moved to the right and took some pressure
off the Seventh, which had done such long and arduous service. These incessant
changes may seem wearisome to the reader, but without a careful record of them
the operations would become chaos to any one who endeavoured to follow them in
detail. It is to be emphasised that though divisions continually changed, the
corps to which they temporarily belonged did not change, or only at long
intervals, so that when you are within its area you can always rely upon it
that in this particular case Horne of the Fifteenth Corps is the actual brain
which has the immediate control of the battle.</p>
<p>As the pressure upon Congreve's Thirteenth Corps on the right at Delville
Wood and elsewhere was considerable, it was now deemed advisable to attack
strongly by the Fifteenth Corps. The units for attack were the Thirty-third
Division upon the left, and the depleted Seventh upon their right. There was to
be no attack upon the left of the Thirty-third Division, but the 56th Brigade
of the Nineteenth Division was handed over to the 33rd Division to strengthen
the force. The objectives to be attacked were once again High Wood (Bois des
Foureaux), Switch Trench, and the connecting trench between them. The Seventh
Division attacked east of the wood on the line between it and Delville
Wood.</p>
<p>The assault upon High Wood was assigned to the 19th Brigade. The 2nd
Worcesters of the 98th Brigade were pushed out so as to cover the left flank of
the assaulting column. At 2 A.M. of July 20 the two advance battalions of
stormers, the 5th Scottish Rifles on the right, the 1st Scottish Rifles upon
the left, were formed up in open ground outside the British wire. Preceded by
scouts, they went silently forward through the gloom until they approached the
south-western edge of the wood. A terrific bombardment was going on, and even
those stout northern hearts might have quailed at the unknown dangers of that
darksome wood, lit from moment to moment by the red glare of the shells. As the
barrage lifted, the wave of infantry rushed forward, the 5th Scottish Rifles
making for the eastern edge, while the 1st Regular Battalion pushed on in the
endeavour to win through and secure the northern edge.</p>
<p>It was speedily found that the tenacious enemy had by no means loosened his
grip of the wood. A portion of the Switch Trench runs through it, and this was
strongly held, a line of spurting flames amid the shadow of the shattered
trees. Machine-guns and wire were everywhere. None the less, the dour Scots
stuck to their point, though the wood was littered with their dead. Both to
east and to north they slowly pushed their way onwards to their objectives. It
was a contest of iron wills, and every yard won was paid for in blood. By 9
o'clock the whole of the southern half of the wood had been cleared, the
leading troops being helped by the 20th Fusiliers, who followed behind them,
clearing up the lurking Germans. At that hour the northern end of the wood was
still strongly held by the enemy, while the stormers had become much
disorganised through loss of officers and through the utter confusion and
disintegration which a night attack through a wood must necessarily entail.</p>
<p>The remaining battalion of the 19th Brigade, the 2nd Welsh Fusiliers, was,
at this critical moment, thrown into the fight. A heavy barrage was falling,
and considerable losses were met with before the wood was entered; but the
Fusiliers went forward with splendid steadiness and dash, their colonel taking
entire local command. In the early afternoon, having got abreast of the
exhausted Scottish Rifles, who had been under the hottest fire for nearly
twelve hours, the Welsh attacked the north end of the wood, their advance being
preceded by a continuous fire from our Stokes mortars, that portable heavy
artillery which has served us so well. The enemy was still unabashed, but the
advance was irresistible, and by 7 P.M. the British were for a time in
possession of the whole of the blood-sodden plantation. It was a splendid
passage of arms, in which every devilry which an obstinate and ingenious
defence could command was overcome by the inexorable British infantry. The grim
pertinacity of the Scots who stood that long night of terror, and the dash of
the Welsh who carried on the wave when it was at the ebb, were equally fine;
and solid, too, was the work of the public school lads of the 20th Fusiliers,
who gleaned behind the line. So terrific was the shell-fire of the disappointed
Germans upon the north end of the wood, that it was impossible to hold it; but
the southern part was consolidated by the 18th Middlesex Pioneer Battalion and
by the 11th Company Royal Engineers.</p>
<p>Whilst the Thirty-third Division stormed High Wood, their neighbours upon
the right, the Seventh Division, depleted by heavy losses but still full of
spirit, had been given the arduous and important task of capturing the roads
running south-west from High Wood to Longueval. The assaulting battalions, the
2nd Gordons on the left and the 8th Devons on the right, Aberdeen and Plymouth
in one battle line, advanced and took their first objective through a heavy
barrage. Advancing farther, they attempted to dig in, but they had got ahead of
the attack upon the left, and all the machine-guns both of Switch Trench and of
High Wood were available to take them in flank and rear. It was a deadly
business&mdash;so deadly that out of the two leading platoons of Gordons only
one wounded officer and five men ever got back. Finally, the whole line had to
crawl back in small groups to the first objective, which was being
consolidated. That evening, the Fifth Division took over the lines of the
Seventh, who were at last drawn out for a rest. The relief was marked by one
serious mishap, as Colonel Gordon, commanding a battalion of his clansmen, was
killed by a German shell.</p>
<p>It has been stated that the 56th Brigade of the Nineteenth Division had been
placed under the orders of the Thirty-third Division during these operations.
Its role was to cover the left flank of the attack and to keep the Germans busy
in the Switch Line position. With this object the 56th Brigade, with the 57th
Brigade upon its left, advanced its front line upon the night of July 22, a
movement in which the 7th South Lancashires upon The the right of the 56th
Brigade were in close touch with the 2nd Worcesters upon the left of the 100th
Brigade. Going forward in the darkness with German trenches in front of them
and a raking fire from High Wood beating upon their flank the Lancashire men
lost heavily and were unable to gain a footing in the enemy's position. This
brigade had already suffered heavily from shell-fire in its advance to the
front trenches. Two deaths which occurred during this short episode may be
cited as examples of the stuff which went to the building up of Britain's new
armies. Under the shell-fire fell brave old Lieutenant Webb, a subaltern in the
field, a Master of Foxhounds at home, father of another dead subaltern, and 64
years old. In the night operation, gallantly leading his company, and showing
his comrades in the dark how to keep direction by astronomy, fell Captain
Gerard Garvin, student, poet, essayist, and soldier, just 20 years of age. A
book might be written which would be a national inspiration dealing with the
lives of those glorious youths who united all that is beautiful in the mind
with all that is virile in the body, giving it unreservedly in their country's
cause. They are lives which are more reminiscent of Sydney, Spencer, and the
finer of the Elizabethans than anything we could have hoped to evolve in these
later days. Raymond Asquith, Rupert Brooke, Charles Lister, Gerard Garvin,
Julian Grenfell, Donald Hankey, Francis Ledwidge, Neil Primrose, these are some
at least of this finest flower of British culture and valour, men who
sacrificed to the need of the present their inheritance as the natural leaders
of the future.</p>
<p>Though the Nineteenth Division was able to make no progress upon the night
of July 22, upon the next night one of their brigades, the 58th, reinforced by
two other battalions, made a strong movement forward, capturing the strong
point upon the edge of the wood which had wrought the mischief the night
before, and also through the fine work of the 10th Warwicks and 7th King's Own
carrying the whole British line permanently forward upon the right, though they
could make no headway upon the left. Some conception of the services of the
Nineteenth Division may be gathered from the fact that during the month of July
it had lost 6500 casualties.</p>
<p>The Thirty-third Division was given a well deserved rest after their fine
exploit in High Wood. During seven days' fighting it had lost heavily in
officers and men. Of individual battalions the heaviest sufferers had been the
two Scottish Rifle battalions, the 20th Royal Fusiliers, the 1st Queen's
Surrey, 9th Highland Light Infantry, and very specially the 16th King's Royal
Rifles.</p>
<p>Whilst this very severe fighting had been going on upon the left centre of
the British advance, an even more arduous struggle had engaged our troops upon
the right, where the Germans had a considerable advantage, since the whole of
Delville Wood and Longueval formed the apex of a salient which jutted out into
their position, and was open to a converging artillery fire from several
directions. This terrible fight, which reduced the Ninth Scottish Division to
about the strength of a brigade, and which caused heavy losses also to the
Third Division, who struck in from the left flank in order to help their
comrades, was carried on from the time when the Highland Brigade captured the
greater part of the village of Longueval, as already described in the general
attack upon July 14.</p>
<p>On the morning after the village was taken, the South African Brigade had
been ordered to attack Delville Wood. This fine brigade, under a South African
veteran, was composed of four battalions, the first representing the Cape
Colony, the second Natal and the Orange River, the third the Transvaal, and the
fourth the South African Scotsmen. If South Africa could only give battalions
where others gave brigades or divisions, it is to be remembered that she had
campaigns upon her own frontiers in which her manhood was deeply engaged. The
European contingent was mostly British, but it contained an appreciable
proportion of Boers, who fought with all the stubborn gallantry which we have
good reason to associate with the name. Apart from the infantry, it should be
mentioned that South Africa had sent six heavy batteries, a fine hospital, and
many labour detachments and special services, including a signalling company
which had the reputation of being the very best in the army, every man having
been a civilian expert.</p>
<p>The South Africans advanced at dawn, and their broad line of skirmishers
pushed its way rapidly through the wood, sweeping all opposition before it. By
noon they occupied the whole tract with the exception of the north-west corner.
This was the corner which abutted upon the houses north of Longueval, and the
murderous machine-guns in these buildings held the Africans off. By night, the
whole perimeter of the wood had been occupied, and the brigade was stretched
round the edges of the trees and undergrowth. Already they were suffering
heavily, not only from the Longueval guns upon their left, but from the heavy
German artillery which had their range to a nicety and against which there was
no defence. With patient valour they held their line, and endured the long
horror of the shell-fall during the night.</p>
<p>Whilst the South Africans were occupying Delville Wood, the 27th Brigade had
a task which was as arduous, and met in as heroic a mood, as that of their
comrades on the day before. Their attack was upon the orchards and houses to
the north and east of Longueval, which had been organised into formidable
strong points and garrisoned by desperate men. These strong points were
especially dangerous on account of the support which they could give to a
counter-attack, and it was thus that they did us great mischief. The Scottish
Borderers, Scots Fusiliers, and Royal Scots worked slowly forward during the
day, at considerable cost to themselves. Every house was a fortress mutually
supporting every other one, and each had to be taken by assault. "I saw one
party of half-a-dozen Royal Scots rush headlong into a house with a yell,
though there were Germans at every window. Three minutes later one of the six
came out again, but no more shots ever came from that house." Such episodes,
with ever-varying results, made up that long day of desperate fighting, which
was rendered more difficult by the heavy German bombardment. The enemy appeared
to be resigned to the loss of the Bazentins, but all their energy and guns were
concentrated upon the reconquest of Longueval and Delville Wood. Through the
whole of the 16th the shelling was terribly severe, the missiles pitching from
three separate directions into the projecting salient. Furious assaults and
heavy shell-falls alternated for several days, while clouds of bombers faced
each other in a deadly and never-ending pelting match. It was observed as
typical of the methods of each nation that while the Germans all threw together
with mechanical and effective precision, the British opened out and fought as
each man judged best. This fighting in the wood was very desperate and swayed
back and forwards.</p>
<p>"It was desperate hand-to-hand work. The enemy had no thought of giving in.
Each man took advantage of the protection offered by the trees, and fought
until he was knocked out. The wood seemed swarming with demons, who fought us
tooth and nail." The British and Africans were driven deeper into the wood.
Then again they would win their way forwards until they could see the open
country through the broken trunks of the lacerated trees. Then the fulness of
their tide would be reached, no fresh wave would come to carry them forwards,
and slowly the ebb drew them back once more into the village and the forest. In
this mixed fighting the Transvaal battalion took 3 officers and 130 men
prisoners, but their losses, and those of the other African units, were very
heavy. The senior officer in the firing line behaved with great gallantry,
rallying his ever-dwindling forces again and again. A joint attack on the
evening of July 16 by the Cape men, the South African Scots, and the 11th Royal
Scots upon the north-west of the wood and the north of the village was held up
by wire and machine-guns, but the German counter-attacks had no better fate.
During the whole of the 17th the situation remained unchanged, but the strain
upon the men was very severe, and they were faced by fresh divisions coming up
from Bapaume. The Brigadier himself made his way into the wood, and reported to
the Divisional Commander the extremely critical state of affairs.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 18 the Third Division were able to give some very
valuable help to the hard-pressed Ninth. At the break of day the 1st Gordons,
supported by the 8th King's Liverpools, both from the 76th Brigade, made a
sudden and furious attack upon those German strong points to the north of the
village which were an ever-present source of loss and of danger. "Now and
again," says a remarkable anonymous account of the incident, "during a lull in
the roar of battle, you could hear a strong Northern voice call out: 'On,
Gor-r-r-dons, on!' thrilling out the r's as only Scotsmen can. The men seldom
answered save by increasing their speed towards the goal. Occasionally some of
them called out the battle-cry heard so often from the throats of the Gordons:
'Scotland for ever!'... They were out of sight over the parapet for a long
time, but we could hear at intervals that cry of 'On, Gor-r-r-dons, on!' varied
with yells of 'Scotland for ever!' and the strains of the pipes. Then we saw
Highlanders reappear over the parapet. With them were groups of German
prisoners."</p>
<p>The assault won a great deal of ground down the north-west edge of Delville
Wood and in the north of the village; but there were heavy losses, and two of
the strong points were still intact. All day the bombardment was continuous and
deadly, until 4:30 in the afternoon, when a great German infantry attack came
sweeping from the east, driving down through the wood and pushing before it
with an irresistible momentum the scattered bodies of Scottish and African
infantry, worn out by losses and fatigue. For a time it submerged both wood and
village, and the foremost grey waves emerged even to the west of the village,
where they were beaten down by the Lewis guns of the defenders. The southern
edge of the wood was still held by the British, however, and here the gallant
26th Brigade threw itself desperately upon the victorious enemy, and stormed
forward with all the impetuosity of their original attack. The Germans were
first checked and then thrown back, and the south end of the wood remained in
British hands. A finer or more successful local counter-attack has seldom been
delivered, and it was by a brigade which had already endured losses which made
it more fit for a rest-camp than for a battle line. After this second exploit
the four splendid battalions were but remnants, the Black Watch having lost
very heavily, while the Argylls, the Seaforths, and the Camerons were in no
better case. Truly it can never be said that the grand records of the historic
regular regiments have had anything but renewed lustre from the deeds of those
civilian soldiers who, for a time, were privileged to bear their names.</p>
<p>Whilst this severe battle had been in progress, the losses of the South
Africans in Delville Wood had been terrible, and they had fought with the
energy of desperate men for every yard of ground. Stands were made in the
successive rides of the wood by the colonel and his men. During the whole of
the 19th these fine soldiers held on against heavy pressure.</p>
<p>The colonel was the only officer of his regiment to return. Even the
Newfoundlanders had hardly a more bloody baptism of fire than the South
Africans, or emerged from it with more glory.</p>
<p>The situation now was that the south of the wood was held by the British,
but the north, including the greater part of the village, was still held by the
Germans. The worn-out Ninth Division, still full of spirit, but lacking sadly
in numbers, was brought out of line upon July 19, and the Eighteenth English
Division, fresh from its own great ordeal in Trones Wood, came forward to take
its place. At seven in the morning of the 19th the 53rd Brigade attacked from
the south, the situation being so pressing that there was no time for artillery
preparation. The infantry went forward without it, and no higher ordeal could
be demanded of them. It was evident that there was great danger of the strong
German column breaking through to westward and so outflanking the whole British
line. Only a British attack from north and from south could prevent its
progress, so that the Third Division were called upon for the one, and the
Eighteenth for the other. This wood of infamous memory is cut in two by one
broad ride, named Princes Street, dividing it into two halves, north and south
(<i>vide</i> p. 181). The southern half was now attacked by the 8th Norfolks,
who worked their way steadily forward in a long fringe of bombers and riflemen.
The Brigade-Major, Markes, and many officers and men fell in the advance. After
a pause, with the help of their Lewis guns, the Norfolks pushed forward again,
and by 2 o'clock had made their way up to Princes Street along most of the
line, pushing the enemy down into the south-eastern corner. The remaining
battalions of the brigade, the 10th Essex on the right and the 6th Berkshires
on the left, tried to fight their way through the northern portion, while the
8th Suffolk attacked the village. Half of the of the village up to the
cross-roads in the centre was taken by the Suffolk, but their comrades on the
right were held up by the heavy machine-gun fire, and at 5 P.M. were compelled
to dig themselves in. They maintained their new positions, under a terrific
shell-fire, for three weary and tragic days, at the end of which they were
relieved by the 4th Royal Fusiliers, a veteran battalion which had fired some
of the first shots of the War.</p>
<p>These Fusiliers belonged to the Third Division which had, as already said,
been attacking from the north side of the wood, while the Eighteenth were on
the south side. On July 19 this attack had been developed by the 2nd Suffolk
and the 10th Welsh Fusiliers, the two remaining battalions of the 76th Brigade.
The advance was made at early dawn, and the Welsh Fusiliers were at once
attacked by German infantry, whom they repulsed. The attack was unfortunate
from the start, and half of the Suffolks who penetrated the village were never
able to extricate themselves again. The Welsh Fusiliers carried on, but its
wing was now in the air, and the machine-guns were very deadly. The advance was
held up and had to be withdrawn. In this affair fell one of the most promising
of the younger officers of the British army, a man who would have attained the
very highest had he lived, Brigade-Major Congreve, of the 76th Brigade, whose
father commanded the adjacent Thirteenth Corps. His death arose from one of his
many acts of rash and yet purposeful valour, for he pushed forward alone to
find out what had become of the missing Suffolks, and so met his end from some
lurking sniper.</p>
<p>On July 20 matters had come to a temporary equilibrium in Delville Wood,
where amid the litter of corpses which were strewn from end to end of that
dreadful grove, lines of British and German infantry held each other in check,
neither able to advance, because to do so was to come under the murderous fire
of the other. The Third Division, worn as it was, was still hard at work, for
to the south-west of Longueval a long line of hostile trenches connected up
with Guillemont, the fortified farm of Waterlot in the middle of them. It was
to these lines that these battle-weary men were now turned. An attack was
pending upon Guillemont by the Thirtieth Division, and the object of the Third
Division was to cut the trench line to the east of the village, and so help the
attack. The advance was carried out with great spirit upon July 22 by the 2nd
Royal Scots, and though they were unable to attain their full objective, they
seized and consolidated a post midway between Waterlot Farm and the railway,
driving back a German battalion which endeavoured to thrust them out. On July
23 Guillemont was attacked by the 21st Brigade of the Thirtieth Division. The
right of the attack consisting of the 19th Manchesters got into the village,
but few got out again; and the left made no progress, the 2nd Yorkshires losing
direction to the east and sweeping in upon the ground already held by the 2nd
Royal Scots and other battalions of the 8th Brigade. The resistance shown by
Guillemont proved that the siege of that village would be a serious operation
and that it was not to be carried by the <i>coup-de-main</i> of a tired
division, however valiantly urged. The successive attempts to occupy it,
culminating in complete success, will be recorded at a later stage.</p>
<p>On the same date, July 23, another attempt was made by mixed battalions of
the Third Division upon Longueval. This was carried out with the co-operation
of the 95th Brigade, Fifth Division, upon the left. The attack on the village
itself from the south was held up, and the battalions engaged, including the
1st Northumberland Fusiliers, 12th West Yorkshires, and 13th King's Liverpools,
all endured considerable losses. Two battalions of the Thirty-fifth Division
(Bantams), the 17th Royal Scots and 17th West Yorks, took part in this attack.
There had been some movement all along the line during that day from High Wood
in the north-east to Guillemont in the south-west; but nowhere was there any
substantial progress. It was clear that the enemy was holding hard to his
present line, and that very careful observation and renewed bombardment would
be required before the infantry could be expected to move him. Thus, the
advance of July 14, brilliant as it had been, had given less durable results
than had been hoped, for no further ground had been gained in a week's
fighting, while Longueval, which had been ours, had for a time passed back to
the enemy. No one, however, who had studied General Haig's methods during the
1914 fighting at Ypres could, for a moment, believe that he would be balked of
his aims, and the sequel was to show that he had lost none of the audacious
tenacity which he had shown on those fateful days, nor had his well-tried
instrument of war lost its power of fighting its way through a difficult
position. The struggle at Longueval had been a desperate one, and the German
return upon July 18 was undoubtedly the most severe reaction encountered by us
during the whole of the Somme fighting; and yet after the fluctuations which
have been described it finished with the position entirely in the hands of the
British. On the days which followed the attack of July 23 the Thirteenth
Brigade of the Fifth Division pushed its way gradually through the north end of
the village, the 1st Norfolks bearing the brunt of the fighting. They were
relieved on the 27th by the 95th Brigade, who took the final posts on the north
and east of the houses, the 1st East Surreys holding the northern front. The
12th Gloucesters particularly distinguished themselves on this occasion,
holding on to three outlying captured posts under a very heavy fire. The three
isolated platoons maintained themselves with great constancy, and were all
retrieved, though two out of three officers and the greater part of the men
were casualties. This battalion lost 320 men in these operations, which were
made more costly and difficult by the fact that Longueval was so exaggerated a
salient that it might more properly be called a corner, the Germans directing
their very accurate fire from the intact tower of Ginchy Church.</p>
<p>The Second Division had now been brought down to the Somme battle-front, and
upon July 26 they took over from the Third Division in the area of Delville
Wood. So complicated was the position at the point occupied, that one officer
has described his company as being under fire from the north, south, east, and
west, the latter being presumably due to the fact that the distant fire of the
British heavies fell occasionally among the front line infantry. At seven in
the morning of July 27 the 99th Brigade, now attached to the Second Division,
was ordered to improve our position in the wood, and made a determined advance
with the 1st Rifles upon the right, and the 23rd Fusiliers upon the left, the
1st Berkshires and 22nd Royal Fusiliers being in support. Moving forward behind
a strong barrage, the two battalions were able with moderate loss to force
their way up to the line of Princes Street, and to make good this advanced
position. A trench full of dead or wounded Germans with two splintered
machine-guns showed that the artillery had found its mark, and many more were
shot down as they retired to their further trenches. The 1st Berkshires held a
defensive flank upon the right, but German bombers swarmed in between them and
the Rifles, developing a dangerous counter-attack, which was finally beaten off
after a sharp fight, in which Captain Howell of the latter battalion was
mortally wounded after organising a splendid defence, in which he was greatly
helped by a sergeant. At 11 o'clock the left flank of the advance was also very
heavily attacked at short range, and the two companies of the Rifles on that
side were in sore straits until reinforced by bombers from the 23rd Fusiliers,
and also by the whole of the 22nd Fusiliers. The German barrage fell thickly
behind the British advance, and it was a difficult and costly matter to send
forward the necessary supports, but before evening part of the 17th Fusiliers
and of the 17th Middlesex from the 5th Brigade had pushed forward and relieved
the exhausted front line. It was a most notable advance and a heroic subsequent
defence, with some of the stiffest fighting that even Delville Wood had ever
witnessed. The East Anglian Field Company Royal Engineers consolidated the line
taken. The 1st Rifles, upon whom the greater part of the pressure had fallen,
lost 14 officers, including their excellent adjutant, Captain Brocklehurst, and
more than 300 men. The immediate conduct of the local operations depended upon
the colonel of this battalion. The great result of the fight was that Delville
Wood was now in British hands, from which it never again reverted. It is a name
which will ever remain as a symbol of tragic glory in the records of the Ninth,
the Third, the Eighteenth, and finally of the Second Divisions. Nowhere in all
this desperate war did the British bulldog and the German wolf-hound meet in a
more prolonged and fearful grapple. It should not be forgotten in our military
annals that though the 99th Brigade actually captured the wood, their work
would have been impossible had it not been for the fine advance of the 95th
Brigade of the Fifth Division already recorded upon their Longueval flank.</p>

<p class="caption">Map of Delville Wood</p>
<br>
<p>We shall now turn our attention to what had been going on in the extreme
right-hand part of the line, where in conjunction with the French three of our
divisions, the 55th Lancashire Territorials, the 35th Bantams, and the
hard-worked 30th, had been attacking with no great success the strong German
line which lay in front of us after the capture of Trones Wood. The centre of
this defence was the village of Guillemont, which, as already mentioned, had
been unsuccessfully attacked by the 21st Brigade upon July 23. About this date
the Thirty-sixth Bantam Division had a repulse at the Malzhorn Farm to the
south of Guillemont, both the 104th and 105th Brigades being hard hit, and many
of the brave little men being left in front of the German machine-guns.</p>
<p>A week later a much more elaborate attack was made upon it by the rest of
the Thirtieth Division, strengthened by one brigade (the 106th) of the
Thirty-fifth Division. This attack was carried out in cooperation with an
advance of the Second Division upon Guillemont Station to the left of the
village, and an advance of the French upon the right at Falfemont and
Malzhorn.</p>
<p>The frontal advance upon Guillemont from the Trones Wood direction appears
to have been about as difficult an operation as could be conceived in modern
warfare. Everything helped the defence and nothing the attack. The approach was
a glacis 700 yards in width, which was absolutely commanded by the guns in the
village, and also by those placed obliquely to north and south. There was no
cover of any kind. Prudence would no doubt have suggested that we should make
good in the north at Longueval and thus outflank the whole German line of
defence. It was essential, however, to fit our plans in with those of the
French, and it was understood that those were such as to demand a very special,
and if needs be, a self-immolating effort upon the right of the line.</p>
<p>The attack had been arranged for the morning of July 30, and it was carried
out in spite of the fact that during the first few hours the fog was so dense
that it was hard to see more than a few yards. This made the keeping of
direction across so broad a space as 700 yards very difficult; while on the
right, where the advance was for more than a mile and had to be coordinated
with the troops of our Allies, it was so complex a matter that there was
considerable danger at one time that the fight in this quarter would resolve
itself into a duel between the right of the British Thirtieth and the left of
the French Thirty-ninth Division.</p>
<p>The 89th Brigade advanced upon the right and the 90th upon the left, the
latter being directed straight for the village. The two leading battalions, the
2nd Scots Fusiliers and the 18th Manchesters, reached it and established
themselves firmly in its western suburbs; but the German barrage fell so
thickly behind them that neither help nor munitions could reach them.
Lieutenant Murray, who was sent back to report their critical situation, found
Germans wandering about behind the line, and was compelled to shoot several in
making his way through. He carried the news that the attack of the Second
Division upon the station had apparently failed, that the machine-gun fire from
the north was deadly, and that both battalions were in peril. The Scots had
captured 50 and the Manchesters 100 prisoners, but they were penned in and
unable to get on. Two companies of the 17th Manchesters made their way with
heavy loss through the fatal barrage, but failed to alleviate the situation. It
would appear that in the fog the Scots were entirely surrounded, and that they
fought, as is their wont, while a cartridge lasted. Their last message was,
that their ranks and munition supply were both thin, their front line broken,
the shelling hard, and the situation critical. None of these men ever returned,
and the only survivors of this battalion of splendid memories were the wounded
in No Man's Land and the Headquarter Staff. It was the second time that the 2nd
Royal Scots Fusiliers had fought to the last man in this war. Of the 18th
Manchesters few returned, and two companies of the 16th Manchesters were not
more fortunate. They got into the village on the extreme north, and found
themselves in touch with the 17th Royal Fusiliers of the Second Division; but
neither battalion could make good its position. It was one of the tragic
episodes of the great Somme battle.</p>
<p>The 89th Brigade upon their right had troubles of their own, but they were
less formidable than those of their comrades. As already described, they had
the greatest difficulty in finding their true position amid the fog. Their
action began successfully by a company of the 2nd Bedford s, together with a
French company, rushing an isolated German trench and killing 70 men who
occupied it. This was a small detached operation, for the front line of the
advancing brigade was formed by the 19th Manchesters on the left, and by the
20th on the right, the latter in touch with the French 153rd of the line. The
19th reached the south-eastern corner of Guillemont, failed to get in touch
with the Scots Fusiliers, and found both its flanks in the air. It had
eventually to fall back, having lost Major Rolls, its commander, and many
officers and men. The 20th Manchesters advanced upon the German Malzhorn
Trenches and carried the front one, killing many of the occupants. In going
forward from this point they lost 200 of their number while passing down a
bullet-swept slope. Three out of four company commanders had fallen. Beyond the
slope was a sunken road, and at this point a young lieutenant, Musker, found
himself in command with mixed men from three battalions under his orders.
Twelve runners sent back with messages were all shot, which will give some idea
of the severity of the barrage. Musker showed good powers of leadership, and
consolidated his position in the road, but was unfortunately killed, the
command then devolving of the upon a sub-lieutenant. The Bedfords came up to
reinforce, and some permanent advance was established in this quarter&mdash;all
that was gained by this very sanguinary engagement, which cost about 3000 men.
The Bantams lost heavily also in this action though they only played the humble
role of carriers to the storming brigades.</p>
<p>The whole of the fighting chronicled in this chapter may be taken as an
aftermath of the action of July 14, and as an endeavour upon our part to
enlarge our gains and upon the part of the Germans to push us out from what we
had won. The encroachment upon High Wood upon the left, the desperate defence
and final clearing of Delville Wood in the centre, and the attempt to drive the
Germans from Guillemont upon the right&mdash;an attempt which was brought later
to a successful conclusion&mdash;are all part of one system of operations
designed for the one end.</p>
<p>It should be remarked that during all this fighting upon the Somme continual
demonstrations, amounting in some cases to small battles, occurred along the
northern line to keep the Germans employed. The most serious of these occurred
in the Eleventh Corps district near Fromelles, opposite the Aubers Ridge. Here
the Second Australians upon the left, and the Sixty-first British Division upon
the right, a unit of second-line Territorial battalions, largely from the West
country, made a most gallant attack and carried the German line for a time, but
were compelled, upon July 20, the day following the attack. to fall back once
more, as the gun positions upon the Aubers Ridge commanded the newly-taken
trenches. It was particularly hard upon the Australians, whose grip upon the
German position was firm while the two brigades of the Sixty-first, though they
behaved with great gallantry, had been less successful in the assault.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap8" name="chap8">VIII. THE
BATTLE OF THE SOMME<br>
The Operations of Gough's Army upon<br>
the Northern Flank up to September 15</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Advance, Australia!&mdash;Capture of Pozi&egrave;res
&mdash;Fine work of Forty-eighth Division&mdash;Relief of Australia by
Canada&mdash;Steady advance of Gough's Army&mdash;Capture of Courcelette</p>
<p class="first">ALL the fighting which has been described was carried out by
Rawlinson's Fourth Army, consisting of the Third, the Fifteenth, and the
Thirteenth Corps. A new element was now, however, introduced upon the left
flank. It will be remembered that Sir Hubert Gough had been given a Fifth or
reserve army, consisting of the Eighth and Tenth Corps, with which to hold the
flank. Of these, the Tenth, including the Forty-ninth, Forty-eighth, and First
Australian Divisions, was now pushed forward into the fighting, with the
intention of attacking Pozi&egrave;res and widening the British front.</p>
<p>This was the first serious appearance of the Australians upon a European
battle-field, and it may be said at once that the high reputation which they
had gained as dogged and dashing fighters in the Gallipoli campaign was fully
endorsed in France.</p>
<p>From General Birdwood, their admirable leader, down through every unit of
their divisions, there ran an indomitable spirit, united to an individuality
and readiness of resource which made them soldiers of the highest type. Their
physique, too, was extraordinarily fine, and even the stay-at-home Londoner who
had seen the lithe figures and the eager, clean-cut, aquiline faces under the
broad-rimmed hats, bringing a touch of romance into our drab streets, would
need no assurance that the men were splendid. A nation of sportsmen had changed
themselves very easily into a nation of soldiers. Of all the strange turns of
fate in this extraordinary war, surely there are few more quaint than that the
black-fellow call of "Cooee!" should many a time have resounded at the crisis
of a European battle.</p>
<p>As the First Australian Division lay upon July 22, it had the straggling and
strongly entrenched village of Pozi&egrave;res in front of it. Upon the right
they were in touch with the First Division filling the gap between
Pozi&egrave;res and Bazentin, as described at the beginning of Chapter VII. On
their left was the Forty-eighth Division of South Midland Territorials. The
village had been reduced to a mere rubbish-heap by the guns, but was none the
less dangerous on that account.</p>
<p>On the early morning of July 23, before it was light, the Australians made
their first eruption into the Somme fighting. "The difficulty," as their
chronicler truly declares, "was not to get the men forward, but to hold them."
With an eager rush the men of New South Wales overwhelmed the front trench
across the face of the village. It was dotted with German bodies, killed by the
artillery. The second trench in the village itself was found to be obliterated
in places. It was occupied as far as possible after a sharp hand-to-hand fight,
and daylight found the Australians, chiefly Victorians, in full possession of
the southern and western end of the village. There was no counter-attack during
July 23, and the day was spent in consolidating and in rounding-up prisoners
from the dug-outs. For three days there was very heavy German shelling, but the
division had served too long an apprenticeship to be shaken by such means. They
lay low and held on tightly.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 25, came the first German attack, but it was broken up so
completely by the British barrage that the Australians had only distant
glimpses of the enemy infantry crawling from under the sleet which beat upon
them. The merciless pounding of the bombardment continued, and then again in
the late afternoon came another infantry attack, which was again scattered by
the dominant all-observing guns. Up to now 150 prisoners, including two German
colonels, had fallen into our hands.</p>
<p>Whilst the Australians had been attacking Pozi&egrave;res from the south,
the Forty-eighth Division had made a similar advance from the south-west, and
had made good the ground upon the left side of the Albert-Bapaume road,
including the western outskirts of the village and part of the Leipzig salient.
In our admiration for our kinsmen from across the seas we must not forget, nor
will they, that these lads from the very heart of rural England went step by
step with them up Pozi&egrave;res Hill, and shared the victory which awaited
them upon it.</p>
<p>The 143rd Brigade, consisting entirely of Warwick battalions (5, 6, 7, and
8), the 144th of Glosters (4 and 6) and Worcesters (7 and 8), and the 145th
from The Gloucester (5), Buckingham, Oxford and Buckingham (4), and Berkshire
(4), took it in turns to surge against the formidable German line, showing the
greatest valour and perseverance, overcoming difficulty after difficulty, and
always getting slowly forward from the first movement upon July 22, until upon
July 26 they had overcome every obstacle and joined hands with the Australians
at the cemetery which marks the north end of the village of Pozi&egrave;res.
Many prisoners and a fine extension of the line were the fruits of their
exertions. The 5th Royal Sussex Pioneer Battalion, amidst considerable
difficulties and heavy shell-fire, consolidated all that had been won. The 4th
Gloucesters and 7th Worcesters particularly distinguished themselves at this
time by their persistent day-by-day work against the German trench line.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 26 the Australian advance was resumed. There were two
obstacles immediately in front&mdash;the one a strong redoubt, the other a line
of trench. The redoubt was most gallantly attacked by the men of Queensland and
of South Australia, and was overwhelmed by their bombs. The Victorians,
meanwhile, had won their way into the trench, but as it communicated by many
runways with the main German system behind, an endless flow of reinforcements
were able to come into it, and the length of the trench enabled the Germans to
attack upon both flanks. It was a most bloody and desperate conflict which
swung and swayed down the long ditches, and sometimes over the edges of them
into the bullet-swept levels between. Men threw and threw until they were so
arm-weary that not another bomb could be lifted. If ever there were born
natural bombers it must surely be among the countrymen of Spofforth and
Trumble&mdash;and so it proved at that terrible international by
Pozi&egrave;res village. A British aeroplane swooped down out of the misty
morning, and gave signals of help and advice from above, so as to dam that
ever-moving stream of reinforcement.</p>
<p>The trenches in dispute were of no vital importance themselves, but they
were the outposts of the great German second line which stretched behind its
broad apron of barbed wire within a few hundred yards to the north-east of the
village. The ground sloped upwards, and the Germans were on the crest. This was
the next objective of the Australians, and was attacked by their Second
Division on July 29. On the flank of the hill to the left the Victorians won a
lodgment, but the main position was still impregnable &mdash;and almost
unapproachable. Sullenly and slowly the infantry fell back to their own
trenches, leaving many of their best and bravest before or among the fatal
wires.</p>
<p>The position had been improved upon the left, however, by an advance of the
Forty-eighth Division. The Warwick Brigade upon their right made no great
progress, but the 145th Brigade upon the left took the trench in front of it
and pushed that flank well forward. This successful attack was at seven in the
evening of July 27. The leading battalions were the 4th Berks upon the right
and the 6th Gloucesters on the left, and these two sturdy battalions captured
all their objectives. A number of the 5th Regiment of the Prussian Guard were
killed or captured in this affair. As the whole line had to turn half left
after leaving the taking-off trench, it was a fine piece of disciplined
fighting. General Gough was a personal witness of this attack,</p>
<p>On August 4, six days later, the Australians came back to the attack with
all the dour pertinacity of their breed. This time their success was
triumphant. A steady bombardment had laid the German front open, and in the
dark of the night the Australian infantry, advancing over their own dead,
rushed the position, surprising the Germans at a moment when a relief was being
carried out. Many of the Germans who had been expecting a rest from their
labours got one indeed&mdash;but it was in England rather than in their own
rear. With the early morning the Australians were on the Pozi&egrave;res Ridge,
and one of the few remaining observation posts of the enemy had passed from him
for ever. In front of them was the land of promise &mdash;the long slope seamed
by German trenches, the distant German camps, the churches and villages of that
captive France which they had come so far to redeem.</p>
<p>Once again the left flank of the Australians was in close co-operation with
a British Division. The Forty-eighth had been withdrawn and replaced by the
Twelfth, a division which was rapidly acquiring a very solid reputation in the
army. The men of the 7th Sussex upon the right and those of Surrey and of Kent
upon the left were in the front of the battle-line, which rolled slowly up the
slope of Pozi&egrave;res, continually driving the German resistance before it.
The ground gained early in August was some 2000 yards of frontage with a depth
of 400 yards, and though the whole ridge, and the windmill which marks it, had
not yet been cleared, the fact that the British had a good foothold upon it was
of the utmost strategical importance, apart from the continual stream of
prisoners who fell into their hands. The Sussex battalion linked up with the
Australians, and nothing could have been closer than the co-operation between
the two, so much so that it is on record that with a glorious recklessness a
bunch of Australians pushed forward without orders in order to keep the Sussex
men company in one of their attacks. The South Saxons have again and again
shown that there is no more solid military material in England. It is said that
a rampant pig with "We won't be druv!" as a motto was an old emblem of that
ancient county. Her sons assuredly lived up to the legend during the War.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th and of the 7th two counter-attacks stormed up to
the new British line. The first was small and easily repelled, a sporadic
effort by some gallant hot-headed officer, who died in the venture, clicking
his Mauser to the last. The second was serious, for three battalions came very
gallantly forwards, and a sudden rush of 1500 Germans, some of whom carried
<i>Flammenwerfer</i>, burst into the trenches at two separate points, making
prisoners of some 50 Australians who were cut off from their comrades. The
attack was bravely delivered in broad daylight, the enemy coming on in good
line in the face of severe fire; but the Australians, with their usual
individuality, rallied, and not only repulsed the enemy, but captured many of
them, besides recapturing the prisoners whom they had taken. This was the
supreme German attempt to recapture the position, but they were by no means
able to reconcile themselves to the loss of it, and came on again and again in
smaller assaults spread over several days, which had no result save to increase
their already very heavy losses in this region.</p>
<p>This <i>Flammenwerfer</i> attack had broken also upon the outposts of the
36th Brigade to the left, eight of these infernal machines coming forward with
a throng of bombers behind them. The captain of the 9thRoyal Fusiliers, instead
of awaiting the attack in a crowded trench, rushed his men forward in the open,
where they shot down the flame-bearers before they could bring their devilish
squirts to bear. The bombers, who had followed the advance, led the flight. On
this day 127 Germans who had been caught in a pocket between the British
trenches were forced to surrender, after a very creditable resistance. On
August 12 the Twelfth Division attacked once more upon a broad front, the 35th
Brigade upon the right, the 37th upon the left. The result of the attack was a
satisfactory accession of ground, for although the Surreys and West Kents were
held up, the Norfolks and Essex attained their objective and held it. Some 40
prisoners and a useful line of trench were the results. That night the 48th
South Midlanders replaced the Twelfth Division once more, resuming their old
station upon the left of the Australians, whose various divisions rang changes
upon each other, men from every corner of the great island continent, from the
burning plains of the Northern Territories to the wind-swept hills of Tasmania,
relieving each other in the ever-advancing line of trenches and strong points
which slowly ate into the German front. One day it was the West Australians who
blew back an attack with their rifle fire. On the next it was the Melbourne men
who had rushed another position. On the summit of the Ridge was the stump of an
old windmill, which lay now between the two lines, and it was towards this and
along the slope of the crest that the advance was gradually creeping. It is
worth noting that in this part of the line some sort of amenity was introduced
concerning the wounded, and that neither party sniped the other so long as a
Red Cross flag was shown. It is grievous to think that such a condition needs
to be recorded.</p>
<p>August 10 and 11 witnessed two night attacks by the 4th and 6th Gloucesters
respectively, neither of which made much progress. The Territorials of the
Forty-eighth Division still kept step, however, with the Australians in all
that desperate advance up the long slope of Pozi&egrave;res Hill, the two units
striving in a generous rivalry of valour, which ended in deep mutual confidence
and esteem.</p>
<p>On August 14 the enemy counter-attacked with some vigour, and momentarily
regained a trench near the windmill. On the 15th the line had been restored. On
the 17th there was a strong attack in six successive lines upon the
Forty-eighth British and the First Australian Divisions, but it had no result.
On the 18th, however, the 5th and 6th Warwicks paid a return visit with great
success, carrying three lines of trenches and capturing 600 prisoners. This was
a very fine exploit, carried out at 5 P.M. of a summer evening.</p>
<p>It was about this date that a new movement began upon the British left,
which extended their line of battle. Since the capture of Ovillers, a month
before, the flank of the army to the left of the attack upon Pozi&egrave;res
had been guarded by the Forty-ninth Division of Yorks Territorials, but no
attack had been attempted in this quarter. On August 18 of the the Twenty-fifth
Division relieved the Forty-ninth, and an advance upon a small scale which
gradually assumed more importance was started in the direction of Thiepval, the
German village fortress of sinister reputation, which lay upon the left flank
on the hither side of the River Ancre. Upon this General Gough had now fixed a
menacing gaze, and though his advance was gradual, it was none the less
inexorable until his aim had been attained; and not only Thiepval itself but
the important heights to the north and east of it which dominate the valley of
the Ancre were in the hands of his persevering troops. The first obstacles in
his path were a stronghold named the Leipzig Redoubt, and to the east of it a
widespread farm, now spread even wider by British shells. This nest of snipers
and machine-guns was known as Mouquet Farm. Upon the 19th, as part of the
general attack along the line, which will be more fully dealt with elsewhere,
not only was our Pozi&egrave;res front pushed forward past the windmill for 300
yards, but the 1st Wiltshires of the Twenty-fifth Division, operating upon the
left of the Forty-eighth, which in turn was on the left of the Australians,
made an important lodgment on the high ground to the south of Thiepval. The
Forty-eighth Division also made some advance, the 4th Gloucesters upon the
night of the 19th capturing 400 yards of trench with 200 prisoners. Their
comrades of the 6th Battalion had less fortune, however, in an attack upon the
German trenches on August 22, when they had two companies partially destroyed
by machine-gun fire, while every officer engaged was hit, including Major
Coates, who was killed. On this same day there was again an Australian advance
near Pozi&egrave;res, whilst at the other end of the line, which was biting
like acid into the German defences, the Twenty-fifth Division began to encroach
upon the Leipzig salient, and were within 1000 yards of Thiepval. In this
entirely successful attack a new invention, the push pipe-line, was used for
the first time with some success, having the double effect of blowing up the
enemy's strong point, and of forming a rudimentary communication trench in the
track of its explosion. In this connection it may be stated generally that
while the Germans, with their objects clear in front of them, had used before
the War far greater ingenuity than the British in warlike invention, as witness
the poison gas, <i>Minenwerfer</i> and flame-throwers, their methods became
stereotyped after War broke out; while the more individual Britons showed
greater ingenuity and constructive ability, so that by the end of 1916 they had
attained a superiority upon nearly every point. Their heavy artillery, light
machine-guns, aeroplanes, bombs, trench-mortars, and gas apparatus were all of
the very best; and in their tanks they were soon to take an entirely new
departure in warfare. It is as difficult in our British system to fix the
responsibility for good as for evil, but there is ample evidence of a great
discriminating intelligence in the heart of our affairs.</p>
<p>The Hindenburg Trench was the immediate object of these attacks, and on
August 24 a stretch of it, containing 150 occupants, was carried. A pocket of
Germans was left at one end of it, who held on manfully and made a successful
resistance against a Company of the 8th North Lancashires, who tried to rush
them. Ultimately, however, these brave men were all taken or killed.</p>
<p>Day by day the line crept on, and before the end of the month the 1000 yards
had become 500, whilst every advance yielded some new trench with a crop of
prisoners. The enemy was fully alive, however, to the great importance of the
Thiepval position, which would give the British guns an opportunity of raking
Beaumont Hamel and their other strongholds upon the north of the Ancre. A very
strong counterattack was made, therefore, by some battalions of the Prussian
Guard on the evening of August 25, preceded by a shattering bombardment. The
attack&mdash;the edge of which was blunted by the British barrage&mdash;fell
mainly upon the 7th Brigade of the Twenty-fifth Division. The result was a
German defeat, and the menacing line drew ever nearer to Thiepval, though an
attack by the North Lanes upon the Prussian Fusilier Guards upon August 28 was
not successful. On the day before, however, the Forty-eighth Division upon the
right of the Twenty-fifth made a successful advance, taking a good line of
trench with 100 of the redoubtable Guards. Between Thiepval and Pozi&egrave;res
the ruins of Mouquet Farm had been taken by the West Australians and the
Tasmanians, and was found to be a perfect warren of snipers, so that it was
some time before it was absolutely clear. On the Pozi&egrave;res Ridge ground
and prisoners were continually being gained, and the trenches between the Ridge
and Mouquet Farm were cleared by Queensland on the right and by Tasmania on the
left. It was a most spirited fight, where Australian and Prussian stood up to
each other within short bomb-throw. But nothing could stand against the fire of
the attack. The whole line of trench upon the right was captured. There was a
dangerous gap, however, upon the the Tasmanian left, and this the Tasmanians
were compelled to endure for two days and nights, during which they were hard
pressed by never-ending shelling and incessant German attacks. It is on record
that their constant reports of their parlous state sent on to headquarters
concluded always with the words: "But we will hold on." If Tasmania needs a
motto, she could find no better one, for her sons lived and died up to it
during those terrible hours. When at last they were relieved, their numbers
were sorely reduced, but their ground was still intact. At the other side of
the gap, however, the West Australians, hard pressed by an overpowering
bombardment, had been pushed out from Mouquet Farm, which came back into German
hands, whence it was destined soon to pass.</p>
<p>It was during this severe fighting that a little scene occurred which, as
described by Mr. Bean, the very able Australian chronicler, must stir the blood
of every Imperialist. A single officer "of middle age, erect, tough as wire,
with lines on his face such as hard fighting and responsibility leave on every
soldier," appeared in the Australian communication trenches, asking to see the
officer-in-charge. He spoke the same tongue but with a different intonation as
he explained his mission. He was the forerunner of the relieving force, and the
First Division of Canada was taking over the line from Australia&mdash;a line
which was destined to bring glory to each of them. Surely a great historical
picture might be made in more peaceful times of this first contact of the two
great nations of the future, Separated by half the world from each other, and
yet coming together amid blood and fire at the call of the race. An hour later,
Canadian Highlanders in a long buoyant line were pushing swiftly forward to
occupy the trenches which Australia had won and held. "Australians and
Canadians," says Mr. Bean, "fought for thirty-six hours in those trenches
inexorably mixed, working under each other's officers. Their wounded helped
each other from the front. Their dead lie, and will lie, through all the
centuries, hastily buried, beside the tumbled trenches and shell-holes where,
fighting as mates, they died." So ended the Australian epic upon the Somme. It
is to be remembered that the New Zealanders formed an entirely separate
division, whose doings will presently be considered.</p>
<p>Whilst the Overseas troops had been fighting hard before Pozi&egrave;res,
there had been a considerable movement upon their left to attack northwards
along the Thiepval Spur. This was carried out by the Thirty ninth Division
north of the Ancre, the Forty-ninth and the Twenty-fifth upon September 3. Some
ground was gained, but the losses were heavy, especially in the 75th Brigade,
where the 2nd South Lancashires suffered considerably. This battalion had been
in shallow trenches exposed to fire and weather for six days previous to the
attack, and was greatly worn. This attack was part of the general battle of
September 3, but from Mouquet Farm northwards it cannot be said to have given
any adequate return for our losses.</p>
<p>Our narrative of the events upon the left wing of the army has now got in
front of the general account, but as the operations of General Gough's force
have definite objectives of their own, the story may now be continued up to
September 15, after which we can leave this flank altogether for a time and
concentrate upon the happenings in the centre, and especially of the upon the
right flank where Delville Wood, Ginchy and Guillemont had presented such
impediments to the advance. At or about the time, September 4, when the
Canadians took over the lines of the Australians at Pozi&egrave;res and Mouquet
Farm, the Eleventh British Division, the First English Division of the New
Army, which had come back from hard service in the East, relieved the
Twenty-fifth Division upon the Canadian left. For a week there was quiet upon
this part of the line, for a great forward move along the whole eleven-mile
front had been planned for September 15, and this was the lull before the
storm. On the evening before this great assault, the Eleventh Division crept up
to and carried the main German stronghold, called the Wonderwork, which lay
between them and Thiepval. There was some sharp bayonet work, and the defeated
garrison flying towards Thiepval ran into the barrage so that the enemy losses
were heavy, while the British line crept up to within 350 yards of the village.
This advance stopped for ever the flank fire by which the Germans were able to
make Mouquet Farm almost untenable, and the Canadians were able to occupy it.
The capture of the Wonderwork was carried out by Price's 32nd Infantry Brigade
of Yorkshire troops. The most of the work and the heaviest losses fell upon the
9th West Yorks, but the 8th West Ridings and the 6th Yorks were both engaged,
the latter losing their colonel, Forsyth. The total casualties came to 26
officers and 742 men.</p>
<p>On September 15 the Eleventh Division held the flank in front of Thiepval,
but the Second and Third Canadian Divisions shared in the general advance, and
pushed forward their line over the Pozi&egrave;res Ridge and down for 1000
yards of the slope in front, joining hands with the Fifteenth Scottish Division
in Martinpuich upon the right. This fine advance crossed several German
trenches, took the fortified position of the Sugar Refinery, and eventually
included in its scope the village of Courcelette, which had not been included
in the original scheme. All Canada, from Halifax in the east to Vancouver in
the west, was represented in this victory; and it was particularly pleasing
that the crowning achievement&mdash;the capture of Courcelette&mdash;was
carried out largely by the 22nd Battalion of the 5th Brigade French Canadians
of the Second Division. French Canada, like Ireland, has been diverted somewhat
by petty internal influences from taking a wide and worthy view of the great
struggle against German conquest, but it can truly be said in both cases that
the fine quality of those who came did much to atone for the apathy of those
who stayed. Thirteen hundred German prisoners were brought back by the
Canadians. During the Courcelette operations, the Third Canadian Division was
working upon the left flank of the Second as it attacked the village,
protecting it from enfilade attack. The work and the losses in this useful
movement fell chiefly upon the 8th Brigade.</p>
<p>This considerable victory was, as will afterwards be shown, typical of what
had occurred along the whole line upon that great day of battle and victory. It
was followed, so far as the Canadians were concerned, by a day of heavy
sacrifice and imperfect success. The Third Division, still operating upon the
left of the Second, endeavoured to carry the formidable Zollern Trench and
Zollern Redoubt to the north of Courcelette. The 7th and 9th Brigades were in
the attacking line, but the former was held up from the beginning. The latter
got forward, but found itself confronted by the inevitable barbed wire, which
stayed its progress. No good was done, and two gallant battalions, the 60th
(Montreal) and the 52nd (New Ontario), lost 800 men between them. The operation
was suspended until it could be renewed upon a larger scale and a broader
front.</p>
<p>At this point we may suspend our account of the operations of Gough's Fifth
Army, while we return to the Fourth Army upon the south, and bring the record
of its work up to this same date. Afterwards, we shall return to the Fifth Army
and describe the successful operations by which it cleared the Thiepval Ridge,
gained command of the Ancre Valley, and finally created a situation which was
directly responsible for the great German retreat in the early spring of
1917.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX. THE BATTLE
OF THE SOMME<br>
August 1 to September 15</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Continued attempts of Thirty-third Division on High Wood
&mdash;Cooperation of First Division&mdash;Operation of Fourteenth Division on
fringe of Delville Wood&mdash;Attack by Twenty-fourth Division on
Guillemont&mdash;Capture of Guillemont by 47th and 59th Brigades &mdash;
Capture of Ginchy by Sixteenth Irish Division</p>
<p class="first">AFTER the very hard fighting which accompanied and followed
the big attack of July 14, continuing without a real break to the end of the
month, there was a lull of a couple of weeks, which were employed by the German
commentators in consoling articles to prove that the allied offensive was at an
end, and by the Allies in bringing forward their guns and preparing for a
renewed effort. The middle of August heard the drum fire break out again and
the operations were continued, but on a local rather than a general scale. Many
isolated positions had to be mastered before a general surge forward could be
expected or attempted, and experience was to prove that it is precisely those
isolated operations which are most difficult and costly, since they always mean
that the whole concentration of the German guns can be turned upon the point
which is endangered.</p>
<p>It will simplify the following operations to the reader if he will remember
that the whole left wing of the army is excluded, being treated separately as
Gough's flank advance. We only deal therefore with Rawlinson's Army. The front
which faces us may be divided into several well-defined areas, each of which is
in turn subjected to attack. There is High Wood on the extreme left, with the
Intermediate Trench and the Switch Trench within it, or to its north. There is
the line of trenches, Switch Trench, Wood Trench, Tea Trench, etc., linking up
High Wood with Delville Wood. There is the north-eastern fringe of Delville
Wood, there are the trenches between Delville Wood and Ginchy, there is Ginchy
itself, there are the trenches between Ginchy and Guillemont, there is
Guillemont itself, and finally there is a stretch of trench between Guillemont
and the French left at Falfemont. This is the formidable barrier which was
attacked again and again at various points between August 1 and September 15 as
will now be told.</p>
<p>August 16 witnessed another attack by the Thirty-third Division upon High
Wood, a position which had once already been almost entirely in their hands,
but which had proved to be untenable on account of the concentration of fire
which the German guns could bring to bear upon its limited space. None the
less, it was determined that it should be once again attempted, for it was so
situated that its machine guns raked any advance between it and Delville Wood.
The attack upon this occasion was carried out on the eastern side by the 98th
Brigade, strengthened for the work by the addition of the 20th Royal Fusiliers
and a wing of the 1st Middlesex. It might well seem depressing to the soldiers
to be still facing an obstacle which they had carried a month before, but if
this portion of the British line was stationary it had gained ground upon
either wing, and it might also be urged that in a combat destined to be ended
by military exhaustion it is the continued fighting rather than the local
result that counts. If High Wood had cost and was to cost us dearly to attack,
it assuredly was not cheap to defend; and if their artillery had made it too
deadly for our occupation our own guns must also have taken high toll of the
German garrison. Such broader views are easy for the detached reasoner in
dug-out or in study, but to the troops who faced the ill-omened litter of
broken tree-trunks and decaying bodies it might well seem disheartening that
this sinister grove should still bar the way.</p>
<p>At 2:45 in the afternoon the infantry advanced, the 4th King's Liverpool
upon the left and the 4th Suffolks on the right, keeping well up to the
friendly shelter of their own pelting barrage. The enemy, however, had at once
established a powerful counter barrage, which caused heavy losses, especially
to the King's, most of whose officers were hit early in the action. The two
leading company commanders were killed and the advance held up. The Suffolks
had got forward rather better, and part of them seized the German trench called
Wood Lane to the south-east of the wood, but unhappily the only surviving
officer with the party was killed in the trench, and the men being exposed to
bombing attacks and to heavy enfilade fire from the eastern corner of High Wood
were compelled to fall back after holding the trench for fifty minutes.</p>
<p>These two battalions had attacked upon the flank of the wood. The wood
itself was entered by three companies of the Argyll and Sutherlands, who found
it laced with wire and full of machine-guns. The Highlanders stuck gamely to
their task, and some of them&mdash;little groups of desperate men
&mdash;actually crossed the wood, but their losses were heavy and, as is usual
in forest fighting, all cohesion and direction became impossible. The whole
attack was hung up. The 20th Royal Fusiliers, one of the public school
battalions, was sent forward therefore to get the line moving once again. They
shared in the losses, but were unable to retrieve the situation. So worn were
the battalions that there was some question whether the 98th Brigade could hold
its own line if there should be a vigorous counter-attack. The 19th Brigade was
therefore brought up to support and eventually to relieve their comrades. The
losses of the 98th amounted to over 2000 men, showing how manfully they had
attempted a task which the result showed to be above their strength. The causes
of the failure were undoubtedly the uncut wire in the wood, and that our
gunners had been unsuccessful in beating down the machine-guns of the
enemy.</p>
<p>Whilst the Thirty-third Division had been making these vigorous attacks upon
High Wood, a corresponding movement had taken place upon the north side of the
wood, where the First Division had come into line upon August 15, taking the
place of the Thirty-fourth Division. They plunged at once into action, for the
2nd Brigade upon August 16 made a successful advance, the 1st Northants and 2nd
Sussex pushing the line on for some hundreds of yards at considerable cost to
themselves, and driving back a half-hearted counter-attack, which endeavoured
to throw them out of their new gains. This attack was renewed with much greater
weight, however, upon August 17, and both the 1st and 2nd Brigades were driven
back for a few hours. In the afternoon they rallied and regained most of the
lost ground. Immediately in font of them stretched a long German trench termed
the Intermediate Trench, being the chief one between the second and third
lines. Towards evening the 1st Brigade attacked this trench, the 1st Black
Watch being the most advanced battalion. There was a hard fight, but the
position was still too strong. Next morning, August 18, the gallant Highlanders
were back at it once more, but the day was very misty, and the advance seems to
have lost its exact bearings. The left company stumbled upon a pocket of 30
Germans, whom it took or killed, but could not find the trench. The right
company got into the trench, but were not numerous enough to resist a very
vigorous bombing attack, which reestablished the German garrison. The 8th
Berkshires pushed forward to try their luck, but a smoke cloud thrown out by a
division on the left came drifting down and the attack was enveloped in it,
losing both cohesion and direction. The Intermediate Trench was still German in
the evening.</p>
<p>Although the 1st Brigade had been held up at this point the 2nd Brigade had
made some progress upon their right, for a successful attack was made by the
1st Northamptons and by the 1st North Lancashires upon a German trench to the
north-west of High Wood. Colonel Longridge of the staff, a valuable officer,
was killed in this affair, but the place was taken, and a strong point
established. During the night two platoons of the Northamptons made an
audacious attempt to steal an advance by creeping forwards 400 yards and
digging in under the very noses of the Germans, on a small ridge which was of
tactical importance. There was a considerable bickering all day round this
point, the Sussex endeavouring to help their old battle-mates to hold the fort,
but the supports were too distant, and eventually the garrison had to regain
their own line.</p>
<p>Upon August 20 there was a severe German attack upon the line of the First
Division, which was held at the time by the 1st Northamptons and the 2nd
Rifles. The advance developed in great force, driving in the outpost line and
part of the Northamptons. The brave old "Cobblers" were a very seasoned
battalion, and took a great deal of shifting from their shallow trench,
hand-to-hand fighting taking place along the line. With the help of two
companies of the Rifles the advance was stayed on the Northampton front; but a
second attack developed out of High Wood upon the right flank of the Rifles.
Two platoons under Lieutenant Stokes showed great gallantry in holding up this
sudden and dangerous incursion. The platoons were relieved by the Gloucesters,
but as there was no officer with the relief, Stokes remained on with the new
garrison, and helped to drive back two more attacks, showing a splendid
disregard for all danger, until he was finally killed by a shell. Captain
Johnstone, who had led the Riflemen in their relief of the Northamptons, was
also killed, while Major Atkinson and 130 men of the Rifles were hit. The
losses of the Northamptons were even more heavy, but the German advance came to
nought.</p>
<p>At the risk of carrying the account of the operations near High Wood and
between High Wood and the west edge of Delville Wood to a point which will
compel a considerable return in order to bring up the narrative of the rest of
the line, we shall still continue them to the date of the great advance of
September 15, when the whole vast array from Pozi&egrave;res upon the left to
Leuze Wood upon the right heaved itself forward, and local attacks gave place
to a big concerted movement. We shall therefore continue to follow the fortunes
of the First Division in their hard task in front of the Intermediate Trench.
After the failure of their attempt to get forward upon August 19 the action
died down, and for four days there was no fresh advance. The 3rd Brigade had
come up into the front line, and upon August 24 the Munsters made an attempt
upon the German trench without success. Colonel Lyon lost his life in this
affair. Upon August 25 another battalion of the Brigade, the South Wales
Borderers, made a bombing attack, and again were in the trench and once again
were driven out. They were not to be denied, however, and upon August 26
actually occupied 180 yards of it, taking one of the deadly guns which had
wrought such damage. On the 27th a German counter-attack was heavily repulsed,
but an attempt of the South Wales Borderers to improve their success was also a
failure. On the evening of this day the Fifteenth Scottish Division took over
the position in front of the Intermediate Trench, the First Division moving to
the right and enabling the Thirty-third Division upon its flank to move also to
the right. The Fifteenth Division was able in very tempestuous weather partly
to outflank the Intermediate Trench, with the result that upon the afternoon of
August 30 the remains of the garrison, finding that they were in a trap,
surrendered. Two machine-guns with 140 men were taken.</p>
<p>Upon August 12 the Fourteenth Light Division, of the which in spite of its
initial misfortune at Hooge had won the name of being one of the finest
divisions of the New Army, came up into line. Its first station was in the
Delville Wood area, which was still a most difficult section, in spite of our
occupation of the wood. Orchards lay upon its fringes, and the German trenches
around it swept the edges with fire, while several German strong points lay
just outside it. An attempt was made by the Fourteenth Division to enlarge an
area outside Longueval upon August 18. At 2:45 that day the 41st Brigade
advanced upon the right of the Thirty-third Division with Orchard Trench as an
objective, while the 43rd Brigade kept pace with them to the north and east of
the wood. The German front trenches were carried without much difficulty, but,
as usual, the process of consolidation was an expensive one. The men in small
groups dug themselves in as best they could under fire from both flanks. The
7th Rifle Brigade upon the extreme left of the line was in the air, and their
left company was almost entirely destroyed. The new line was held, however, and
knotted together with three strong points which defied German attack. This was
attempted upon the 19th, but was a total failure. In these operations the
Fourteenth Division took 279 prisoners.</p>
<p>For the sake of consecutive narrative, the doings in the High Wood and
Delville Wood district have been given without a break, but in order to bring
the rest of the chronicle level one has to turn back a few days and turn our
attention to the long right flank of the army, from Longueval in the north to
Falfemont, where we joined on to the French in the south.</p>
<p>The northern angle of this position was, as has already explained, extremely
disadvantageous to us, forming an almost fantastic peninsula, which jutted out
into the German positions. Even if their infantry could not carry it, their
guns could at all times rake it from three sides, and could command the whole
Montauban valley, along which our supplies were bound to pass. Therefore it
became very necessary to get more elbow-room along this line.</p>
<p>South-east of Delville Wood was the strongly-fortified village of Ginchy,
and between the wood and the village were what may be called the "Alcoholic"
system of trenches, where the long and powerful Beer Trench, stretching a few
hundred yards north of the wood, was connected up with Vat Alley, Hop Alley,
and Ale Alley, the whole forming a formidable labyrinth. To the south of Ginchy
lay the very strongly organised village of Guillemont, which could not be
approached save over a long quarter of a mile of open ground. Ginchy and
Guillemont were linked up in a strong line, of which Waterlot Farm and
Guillemont Station were two nodal points. South of Guillemont came Wedge Wood
and finally Falfemont Farm, where the right of Rawlinson's Fourth Army joined
on to the French. The whole of this long line was most powerfully defended,
both by material appliances and by that constant human valour without which all
appliances are useless. How to push it back was the pressing and difficult
question which now faced the British commanders. Guillemont had already been
attacked upon July 30 by the Thirtieth Division as described in a previous
chapter. This attack had been most valiantly urged, but the losses had been
heavy, and the gains small. The Second Division had relieved of the Thirtieth
on this point, and were in turn relieved upon August 10 by the Twenty-fourth, a
division which had seen a good deal of rough service in that famous
forcing-house for young soldiers&mdash;the Ypres salient.</p>
<p>A few days later it closed in upon Guillemont with orders to reconnoitre and
then attack. A partial attack was made upon August 16 upon the outskirts of the
village by the 72nd Brigade, which was rather in the nature of a reconnaissance
in force. The place was found to be very strong and the advancing troops drew
oft after incurring some losses, which were heaviest in the 9th East Surreys,
who came under a blast of machine-gun fire, and dropped nine officers and over
200 men. The division drew off, broadened their front of attack, and came on
again upon August 18 in a wide advance which covered the whole enemy line,
striking not only at the village itself, but at the station, quarry, and farm
to the north of it, covering a front of nearly a mile.</p>
<p>The 73rd Brigade attacked the village and the quarry. The right attack was
led by the 13th Middlesex and supported by the 2nd Leinster, but it had no
success, and ended in heavy losses, especially to the English regiment. The men
who got across were unable to penetrate, and after a hand-to-hand fight were
driven back. Upon the left of the brigade things went better. The attack upon
that side was led by the 7th Northants, supported by the 9th Sussex. The
Cobblers had lost their colonel from a wound in the morning. This colonel was
the famous international three-quarter Mobbs, who gave one more illustration of
the fact that the fine sportsman turns rapidly into the fine soldier. His
successor had been a few hours in command. The direction of the fight was none
the less admirable. The Midlanders dashed with great fire across the 300 yards
of open which separated them from the Quarries, while the Sussex crowded up
into the advanced trenches, sending on company after company in response to
demands for help. The British barrage had lifted, and it was no easy matter in
face of the flank fire to get the men across, so that only a percentage reached
the hard-pressed firing-line upon the other side. The colonel of the Sussex
held back therefore, and sent his third company over as dusk fell, so that they
came in on the flank of the Northamptons with little loss, while the fourth
followed later with supplies. The lodgment made by the leading battalions was
secured, and some ground to the north of the village passed into British
hands.</p>
<p>Although Guillemont itself remained for the moment with the Germans, the
assault of the Twenty-fourth Division had a success along the whole of the rest
of the line and greatly improved the position of the British upon this flank.
The 17th Brigade had attacked the station and after a severe fight had captured
it, the 3rd Rifle Brigade especially distinguishing itself in this affair.
Farther still to the north the line of trenches leading up to and in front of
Waterlot Farm had fallen also to the 17th Brigade, the 8th Buffs having the
heavier share of the work. These attacks, which cost the division more than
3000 men, were carried out in co-operation with French attacks to the south and
east of Guillemont, the net result being partly to isolate that stubborn
village and turn it into a salient on the German line.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fourth Division was now drawn out for a short period, and the
Twentieth replaced it and held firmly to the conquered line.</p>
<p>The Germans were acutely uneasy as to the erosion of their line which was
going on from Longueval to Guillemont, and upon August 23 endeavoured to win
back the ground gained at Guillemont Station, but their counter-attack,
stronger as usual in its artillery preparation than in its infantry advance,
had no success, though it cost the Twentieth Division some heavy losses. It was
one clear sign of the degeneration of the German soldier that the overture
should so continually be better than the performance. The machines were as
formidable as ever, but the human element was slowly wilting, and that subtle
sentiment was developing upon either side which means the ascendancy of one and
the decline of the other. The ease with which the prisoners surrendered, the
frequent failure to hold ground and the constant failure to gain it, all
pointed to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Upon August 24 a very widespread and determined attempt was made by the
British to enlarge their area on the right wing, and the attack extended along
the whole line to the north of Guillemont. It was carried out by three
divisions, the Thirty-third which had side-stepped to the right, and now
covered the ground to the immediate left of Delville Wood, the Fourteenth Light
Division which covered the north of Delville Wood and the Alcohol system of
trenches, and finally the Twentieth Division covering Ginchy and the rest of
the line down to Guillemont.</p>
<p>Describing these operations from the left of our line, the first unit of
attack was the 100th Brigade, which had for its objective Tea Trench and other
German defences which were to the north-west of Delville Wood, The
Longueval-Flers road separated their right flank from the left flank of the
42nd Brigade of the Fourteenth Division. In order to carry out the attack the
three leading battalions of the Brigade had to be crowded forward into a narrow
front before daylight upon August 24.</p>
<p>All day they lay there, but towards evening the bombardment which they
endured changed into an immense barrage which fell like a steel guillotine in
front of our line, the British counter battery work being unable to check it.
Shortly before 7 o'clock in the evening the leading companies of the attack
belonging from the left to the 1st Queen's, 16th Rifles and 2nd Worcesters,
crept forward until they were on the edge of the barrage. At 7 o'clock they
took the plunge, advancing with brisk alacrity into that terrible pelt of
missiles. By 7:30 the Queen's had established themselves in the German position
and were bombing their way up Wood Lane Trench. The other two battalions had
also at that hour got well forward, and the 42nd Brigade of the Fourteenth
Division upon the right had been equally successful. The new positions were at
once consolidated by the 9th Highland Light Infantry and by parties of the
222nd Field Company, together with the 18th Middlesex pioneers, under a very
heavy fire. The Worcesters were in good touch with the 16th Rifles upon their
left, but a considerable and dangerous gap had formed between the left of the
Rifles and the right of the Queen's&mdash;a gap which might have let in a fatal
counter-attack had it not been for the admirable barrage of the artillery,
which beat down each of the attempted advance. A trench was at once put in hand
to link up the new line, the sappers labouring at it during the night, but the
gap had not been entirely closed by the morning. The assaulting battalions were
then relieved, and the 98th Brigade took the place of their comrades of the
100th. Thus ended this very successful little advance, the result being to push
forward and strengthen our position between the two woods. The casualties were
not high, and this fact was due to the fine co-operation of the guns, and to a
very effective smoke barrage thrown out between the left wing of the attack and
the machine-guns of High Wood.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Division had advanced upon the immediate right of the
Longueval-Flers road, the 42nd Brigade upon the left keeping in touch w^th the
100th, while the 41st Brigade upon the right had not only to reach its own
objective, but to act as a protective flank against the Germans in the village
of Ginchy. The 43rd Brigade was in reserve, but contributed one battalion, the
6th Yorkshire Light Infantry, to strengthening the reserve of the 42nd Brigade,
whose formidable task was the carrying of the outlying fringe of Delville Wood.
At last that tragic grove, the scene of such a prolonged struggle, was to be
utterly cleared from our front. Three gallant battalions of the 42nd
Brigade&mdash;the 5th Oxford and Bucks on the left, the 5th Shropshires in the
centre, and the 9th Rifles upon the right &mdash; swept forward with the
bayonet in the good old style and cleared it from end to end, helped greatly by
the accurate barrage behind which they advanced. The German counter-barrage was
heavy, but the troops tramped through it with no more deflection than if it had
been a rainstorm, though a trail of dead and wounded marked their path. Every
officer of the Rifle battalion was hit. The first barrier was a trench cut 150
yards from the north of the wood and called Inner Trench. This was taken at the
first rush, the enemy surrendering freely. Two gallant N.C.O.'s of the Rifles,
Sergeant Hamp and Corporal Ord, rushed up a machine-gun at the cost of their
own lives. One party of 50 men of the enemy seem to have taken up arms again
after three of the storming lines had passed, and to have blazed into their
backs with a machine-gun, but a fourth line swept over them and all were
engulfed. The Oxford and Bucks on the left of the line moved forward
splendidly, picking up 200 prisoners as they passed, clearing the edge of the
wood and digging in about 200 yards to the north of it, the 89th F Company
Royal Engineers and the 11th King's Liverpool consolidating the position. The
enemy's opposition upon the right flank had, however, been very much sterner
and more successful, so that the flank battalion of the 42nd Brigade and the
Rifle battalions of the 41st Brigade had all fallen short of their final
objectives.</p>
<p>Altogether the day was a great success, for the losses were not excessive,
and the gains though not sensational were general all along the line and
prepared the way for the successful assaults of the next week. The fact that
the right flank had not come on as far as the left, caused each successive
battalion to find itself with its right flank exposed, but the line was held by
a clever readjustment under heavy fire, by which the flank battalions faced
half right with the Oxfords still in the advanced position joining up with the
Thirty-third Division, while the line slanting, but unbroken, sloped backwards
to Inner Trench upon the right.</p>
<p>The eastern corner of Deville Wood was still dominated by a strong point,
but upon the rain-swept evening of August 27 this was finally cleared out by
the 43rd Brigade of the Fourteenth Division, the 6th Somerset, Yorkshire and
Cornwall battalions of light infantry, together with the 10th Durhams, all
doing good service.</p>
<p>The remains of the hard-worked Seventh Division had been thrust in front of
those Alcohol trenches which still remained intact, filling up the gap
separating Delville Wood from Ginchy. The 22nd Brigade was on the left, and
shared in the advance of the 43rd, the 1st Welsh Fusiliers capturing Hop Alley,
Beer Trench, and part of Vat Alley. The impending attack upon Ginchy, which was
to co-operate with the attack upon Guillemont farther south, was forestalled
and postponed by a very strong advance of the German infantry upon the north
and north-east of Delville Wood. The 91st Brigade had relieved the 22nd, and
the brunt of this attack outside the wood fell upon the 1st South Staffords,
who repulsed the onslaught on three separate occasions, enduring a heavy
shelling between each German advance. Upon the fourth attack the persevering
German infantry succeeded in penetrating the north-east corner of the wood and
regaining Hop Alley. The 2nd Queen's relieved the exhausted Staffords, and at
noon of September 2 made a vigorous bombing attack which had some success,
though the assailants were considerably mystified by the appearance of a party
of Germans who had dressed themselves in the khaki and helmets taken the night
before. This powerful attack fell also upon the Twentieth Division, and upon
the Fourteenth to the right of the Seventh, but although it inflicted heavy
losses, especially upon the 60th Brigade of the Twentieth Division, it failed
to gain any ground or to obtain any strategic advantage.</p>
<p>On September 3 at noon the attack upon Ginchy was carried out by the 22nd
Brigade, the 1st Welsh Fusiliers attacking to the north of the village, the
20th Manchesters moving on to the village itself, and the 2nd Warwicks on to
the trenches to the west of the village. The Manchesters succeeded about one
o'clock in forcing their way into the village, sending back 200 of the garrison
as prisoners. The first rush behind the barrage sustained few casualties, and
it was not until the Manchesters in their fiery eagerness began to push on
beyond their mark that they ran into a very severe fire from the north, which
mowed down their ranks, including nearly all their officers. The Welsh
Fusiliers upon the left had been unable to get forward, and as a consequence
the Manchester men were in so precarious a position and so reduced in numbers
that they had to fall back through the village, while the 2nd Royal Irish, who
had passed on as far as Ginchy Telegraph, had now to retire, as their rear was
in danger. The 2nd Warwicks, however, held on to the south of the village, and
refused to be dislodged, keeping their position there against all attacks until
the night of September 5. In the afternoon, two companies of the Irish
attempted to retrieve the situation by a renewed advance upon the village, but
their losses were heavy, and they could not get farther than the western
outskirts. The casualties during the day were severe, and in the night it was
thought advisable to replace the 22nd by the 20th Brigade. The latter made a
fresh attack upon the village at eight in the morning of September 4 by the 9th
Devons, but again it was found impossible, in the face of the inexorable
machine-guns, to effect a permanent lodgment. The 2nd Queen's, however, on the
left of the Brigade, improved our position at the north-eastern corner of
Delville Wood. There was a short lull in the fighting, and then at 5:30 A.M.
upon the 6th the 2nd Gordons stormed into the orchards round the village, but
had to dig themselves in upon the western edge. At 2 P.M. they again attacked,
aided by two companies of the 9th Devons, getting as far as the middle of the
village, and capturing some prisoners, but the Germans came back with so heavy
a counter-attack that the evening found our troops back in their own front line
once more. On the night of September 7 the division was taken out&mdash;the
16th (Irish) and 55th moving up to the Ginchy Front.</p>
<p>This severe fighting by the Seventh Division from the 3rd onwards was an
excellent example of how a force may be called upon to sacrifice itself without
seeing the object of its sacrifice until it learns the general plans of the
Commander. The assaults upon Ginchy, unsuccessful at the moment, were of the
greatest value as leading to the capture of Guillemont in the south. The task
allotted to the Seventh Division was a very difficult one, involving an advance
from a salient with the left flank exposed, and the magnitude of this task was
greatly increased by the truly execrable weather. If no successful efforts were
made to counter-attack upon Guillemont, the reason undoubtedly lay in the
absorption of the German strength at Ginchy.</p>
<p>On this same day the battle raged from Ginchy along the whole right of our
line through Waterlot Farm, Guillemont and Falfemont Farm to the left flank of
the French. The annexed diagram will give some idea of the forces engaged and
their several objectives on September 3.</p>

<p class="caption">Attack on German Left Flank, September 3, 1916</p>
<br>
<p>As will be seen by this plan, the Fifth Division formed the unit next to the
French, and the 13th Brigade were ordered to help our gallant allies in
attacking the extreme southern point at Falfemont, while the 95th Brigade
covered the ground between their comrades of the 13th and the village of
Guillemont. The advance was made shortly after mid-day, and though the
operations were long, bloody, and difficult, the famous old division,
inheritors of the glories of Mons and Le Cateau, was not to be denied. The
resistance was very strenuous, and only the most devoted constancy could have
eventually overcome it. To follow the fortunes of the 13th Brigade first it may
be briefly stated that upon Sunday, September 3, they first gained the
Falfemont Farm, and then lost it again. That night they were reinforced by
three battalions of the 15th Brigade, and were able next day to push in between
the Farm and Guillemont, pressing the defenders upon every side. It was a
widespread building, with many loopholed outhouses, and one of these fell after
the other until only the central ruin, still spouting fire like an anchored
battleship, remained in the hands of the defenders. Their position was
hopeless, however, and by the morning of September 5 the changes in the line to
the north of them, and especially the loss of Guillemont, caused them to
evacuate the position.</p>
<p>The advance of the 95th Brigade upon the left of the Fifth Division had been
a very gallant one, though the objectives which they so bravely won were
nameless lines of trenches and a sunken road. The first line of the attack was
formed by the 1st Duke of Cornwall's on the left, and the 12th Gloucesters upon
the right, closely followed by the 1st Devons and 1st East Surreys. They were
in close touch with the 69th Brigades of the Twentieth Division, who were
attacking Guillemont upon their left. Within two hours of the first attack all
three objectives had been captured, and the remains of the victorious
battalions were digging in upon the line Ginchy&mdash;Wedge Wood. The losses
were heavy in each battalion, but particularly so in the 12th Gloucesters. For
a time they were under fire from both the British and the German batteries. Yet
they held on to their ultimate objective, and the following extract from the
impression which they produced upon an experienced regular colonel is worth
quoting, if only to show the pitch of soldiership to which our amateur
volunteers had reached.</p>
<p>"The battalion came on in their extended lines as steadily as on parade,
and, without wavering, though suffering heavy losses, passed through a hot
German barrage in the most gallant manner. The lines were also much troubled by
long-range machine-gun fire from the direction of Fallemont, but although gaps
appeared and the fines were rapidly thinning out, I never saw the slightest
sign of wavering. No troops could have carried through such a difficult task
with more indifference to consequences." Gloucestershire was once the favourite
forcing-ground for the champions of the British ring. The old fighting breed
still lives. Altogether the 95th Brigade advanced 3000 yards in this action,
and was responsible for the capture both of Wedge Wood and of Leuze Wood.</p>
<p>Upon the left of the Fifth Division the difficult task of storming
Guillemont had been entrusted to the Rifle and Rifle Brigade battalions of the
59th Brigade upon the right, and to the 47th Brigade of the Sixteenth Irish
Division. This brigade had come temporarily under the command of General
Douglas Smith upon the left, taking the place of the 60th Brigade, which had
lost heavily in strength from cold, wet, and continual German gassing and
bombardment. The 61st was in divisional reserve. The attack was ordered for
noon. Profiting by previous experiences it was planned that the whole village
should not be rushed at once, but that the attack should proceed with method in
three definite stages. The guns of the Sixth and of the Twenty-fourth Divisions
joined in the preliminary bombardment. At noon, the infantry leapt over their
parapets and charged home. The enemy was taken unawares. The 10th and 11th
Rifle Brigade with the 10th and 11th King's Royal Rifles, supported by the 6th
Oxford and Bucks, carried all before them on the south and west of the village,
while the Leinsters, Connaughts, and Royal Irish did as much in the north. The
Quarries, which was a nest of machine-guns, was taken in their stride. No more
valiant or successful advance had been seen during the War, and it may take a
place beside the attack of the 36th Brigade at Ovillers as a classical example
of what British infantry can do with all the odds against them. The Riflemen
fought in grim silence, but the Irish went through with a wild Celtic yell
which, blending with the scream of their pipes, must have added one more to the
horrors of the shaken and hard-pressed garrison. Neck and neck the two
brigades, English and Irish, went through the German line. Hand-to-hand fights
took place in the village, but all resistance was soon beaten down. By 12:30
the first objectives were solid, and at 1:20 the whole village was taken and
the survivors of the enemy streaming out to eastward. The English losses were
heavy and equally distributed. The Irish were also heavy, especially in the
case of the 6th Connaughts, who also lost their colonel. At this time, through
the failure of recruiting in Ireland, these brave battalions were below full
strength, in spite of which within six days they stormed or helped to storm two
of the strongest villages upon the line. One hardly knows which emotion is
stronger&mdash;one's pride in those who went, or one's contempt for those who
bided at home. No one admired the splendid dash of the Irish stormers more
heartily than the British Riflemen, who kept pace with them in their desperate
venture. Equally brave, they were more deliberate in their methods, with the
result that more than once pockets of fighting Germans who had been overrun by
the Irish, but were still venomous, were cleared up by the Riflemen on the
flank. So infectious, however, was the fiery dash of the Irish, that Mr. Philip
Gibbs has left it on record in one of his admirable letters that an English
sergeant of Rifles complained that he had almost blown his teeth away in
whistling his men back from overrunning their objectives. The garrison, it may
be remarked, were chiefly Hanoverian, and once again our men were amused and
amazed to see "Gibraltar" printed upon their hats, a reminiscence of the days
when they formed part of the British army.</p>
<p>Whilst the attack had been in progress, two battalions of the 61st Brigade,
the 7th Somersets and 12th King's Liverpools, were in close support, advancing
steadily through the German barrage. The enemy were, as already shown, strongly
held at Ginchy on the left flank of the Guillemont advance, but in spite of
their preoccupations they made strong attempts at a counter-attack from this
direction, which fell upon the Connaughts, who had been reinforced by two
companies of the 12th King's. This small flanking force pushed out posts which
behaved with great gallantry, holding off the enemy until evening, though at
considerable loss to themselves. One of these posts, under Sergeant Jones of
the 12th King's, was cut off by the Germans and held out for two days without
food or water&mdash;a deed for which the sergeant received the Victoria Cross.
On September 4 the positions were put into a state of defence, and on the 5th
the Twentieth Division drew out of the line after their fine deed of arms.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Division had been in support upon the left during the attack
upon Guillemont, and the 43rd Brigade had moved up to the northern edge of the
village itself, losing a number of officers and men, including the colonel of
the 6th Somersets, who, though badly wounded, remained with his battalion until
it had consolidated its new position. A German advance was attempted at this
point about 8 P.M., but the 43rd Brigade helped to drive it back. It may be
said that the whole of September 3 was a series of small victories, making in
the aggregate a very considerable one, and breaking down the whole of the flank
German defences.</p>
<p>The Irish Division was now brought up to face Ginchy, the one point still
untaken upon the second line, whilst the Fifth Division pursued its victorious
way up to Leuze Wood and to the lower corner of Bouleaux Wood, always in close
touch with the French upon their right. The 47th Brigade of the Irish had
already lost near half its numbers, and other units of the division, both
infantry and sappers, especially the 7th and 8th Irish Fusiliers, had lost
heavily in supporting the Fifth Division in its attack, but the battalions were
still full of fight.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon of September 9 the final attack upon Ginchy by the
Irish tore that village from the close grip of its Bavarian and Pomeranian
garrison. The Fifty-fifth Division made a supporting attack upon the left, but
the main advance was left for the now depleted but indomitable division. It
dashed forward upon a two-brigade front, the 47th upon the right and the 48th
upon the left, the brigades being strengthened by three battalions of the 49th,
so that practically all the reserves were in the line from the start, but the
commander had the comforting assurance that the Guards were moving up in his
rear. On the right the first wave consisted of the 6th Royal Irish and the 8th
Munsters, who dashed forward with great gallantry but were held up by
machine-guns. The same fire held up the 1st Munsters upon the right of the 48th
Brigade, but some natural cover was found which enabled them to continue to
advance. On their left the 7th Irish Rifles and 7th Irish Fusiliers had broken
into the German line in the first determined advance.</p>
<p>By six in the evening the 8th and 9th Dublins had reinforced the attack and
had pushed on into the village, where the 156th Field Company Royal Engineers
at once consolidated&mdash;a swift measure which was fully justified since two
attacks stormed out of the darkness of the night and were beaten back into it
again. Next morning the Sixteenth Division was relieved by the Guards and
returned for the time from the line which they had so materially helped to
enlarge and consolidate. Their losses had been heavy. Five battalion commanders
were among the casualties. They fell out of the line upon September 10. A few
days earlier the Fifth Division had been relieved by the Fifty-sixth.</p>
<p>The total effect of these operations had been to extend the whole British
position for several thousand yards in frontage and nearly a mile in depth. At
least 2000 more prisoners had fallen into our hands. The attack of July 14 had
broken in the centre of the German second line, but the two flanks had held
firm. The fall of Pozi&egrave;res upon our left before the Australians and the
Forty-eighth Division, and of Guillemont upon our right before the Twentieth
and Fifth, meant that the flanks also had gone, and that the whole front was
now clear. A third strong line ran through Warlencourt and Le Transloy, but
very numerous impediments&mdash;woods, villages, and trenches &mdash;lay in
front of the army before they could reach it. It proved, however, that the
worst impediment of all&mdash;vile weather and a premature winter&mdash;was to
be the only real obstacle to the complete success of the army.</p>
<p>In order to complete this description of these widespread operations, which
are difficult to synchronise and bring into any settled plan, one must return
to what was going on upon the left of Delville Wood. Towards the end of August
the Thirty-third Division, which had covered the line between Delville and High
Woods, was relieved by the Twenty-fourth. Upon the left of the Twenty-fourth
the First Division was still continuing that series of operations upon High
Wood which have been already described. On their left in turn was the Fifteenth
Scottish Division, the left unit of Rawlinson's Army. They were busy from this
time onwards in digging their assembly trenches for the great assault.</p>
<p>The first incident which calls for attention was a very sudden and violent
German attack upon August 31 upon the Twenty-fourth Division. The German
onslaught met with some success at first, as it burst through the line of the
13th Middlesex, a battalion which had lost heavily in the attack upon
Guillemont ten days before, and was for the moment more fit for a rest-camp
than the forefront of the battle. The 9th Sussex, who were on the right of the
Middlesex, stood firm, and the German advance, which had penetrated some
distance down the long communication trench which is known as Plum Street, was
eventually brought to a halt. This result was partly brought about by the
initiative and determination of a 2nd Lieutenant of the Middlesex, "a little
pale-faced fellow," who carried off a Lewis gun, and worked it from different
positions down the trench, continually holding up the Germans and giving time
for the Sussex men to gather such a force at the end of Plum Street as
prevented the Germans from debouching into the larger trenches which led down
towards Longueval. The attack had been equally severe upon the 72nd Brigade,
who held the right of the division, which included the northern end of Delville
Wood. They entirely repulsed the Germans with great loss, the 8th Queen's
Surrey being the battalion which bore the brunt of the fight.</p>
<p>On the next day, September 1, the 17th Brigade came up to restore the
situation on the left, and by evening the position had been almost cleared. On
the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th there were fresh German attacks, but the line was now
firmly held and no impression was made. None the less, the fighting had been
costly, and the depleted division had 2000 more names upon its roll of honour.
It was drawn out shortly afterwards, but its artillery, which was left in the
line, had the misfortune to lose its distinguished chief. General Phillpotts,
upon September 8.</p>
<p>We shall now move a mile eastwards to follow the First Division in its
difficult and, as it proved, impossible task of improving our position as
regards High Wood, a spot which caused us more delay and loss than any other
upon the German line.</p>
<p>On September 3 a strong attack by the whole of the 1st Brigade was made upon
the wood, which was gridironed with trenches and studded with strong points.
The immediate objectives were the main trench in the wood and the trenches to
the southeast of the wood. The 1st Camerons, supported by the 8th Berks,
advanced upon the right, the Black Watch, supported by the 10th Gloucesters, on
the left. The attack had considerable success, which could not, however, be
maintained. The battalions on the right won home, but the consolidating parties
were delayed. On the left, the attack was only partially successful, being held
up at a large mine-crater. When eventually a strong German counter-attack swept
forward from the north-east of High Wood, the British had to fall back to their
own original line, taking, however, 80 German prisoners with them. The ground
had been won, but there had not been weight enough to hold it. The losses of
the two Highland battalions were severe.</p>
<p>On September 8 the 3rd Brigade penetrated into the western part of High
Wood, but again it was found impossible to make more than a temporary lodgment.
The 2nd Welsh, 1st South Wales Borderers and 1st Gloucesters were all involved
in this affair, as was the 9th Black Watch of the Fifteenth Division, who
played a very gallant part. Next day the attack was renewed with the 2nd
Brigade upon the right, the 3rd upon the left. In the centre the 1st Northants
captured the crater, but were driven out of it later in the day, after a hard
fight. On the left the Munsters and Gloucesters were held up by machine-gun
fire. On the right the advance of the 2nd Sussex and of the 2nd Rifles met with
gratifying success. The important trench called Wood Lane was stormed, with a
loss to the assailants of a couple of hundred men, after the hostile
machine-guns had been deftly put out of action by our trench-mortars. The
Rifles were in touch not only with their comrades of Sussex upon the left, but
with the 5th King's Liverpool upon the right, so that the line was complete. It
was consolidated that night by the 1st North Lancashires and was permanently
held, an attempt at counterattack next day being crushed by our barrage. After
this little victory the First Division was relieved upon the evening of
September 10 by the New Zealanders.</p>

BATTLE OF THE SOMME<br>
Breaking of the Third Line, September 15</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Capture of Martinpuich by Fifteenth Division &mdash;
Advance of Fiftieth Division&mdash;Capture of High Wood by Forty-seventh
Division&mdash;Splendid advance of New Zealanders&mdash;Capture of Flers by
Forty-first Division&mdash;Advance of the Light Division&mdash;Arduous work of
the Guards and Sixth Divisions&mdash;Capture of Quadrilateral &mdash;Work of
Fifty-sixth Division on flank&mdash;Debut of the tanks</p>
<p class="first">THE Army had been temporarily exhausted by its extreme efforts
and the consequent losses, but was greatly buoyed up by the certainty that with
their excellent artillery and their predominant air service they were
inflicting more punishment than they were receiving. Steadily from week to week
the tale of prisoners and of captured guns had been growing, the British and
the French keeping curiously level in the numbers of their trophies. Fresh
divisions, ardent for battle, were streaming down from the Northern line, while
old divisions, already badly hammered, filled up rapidly with eager drafts, and
were battle-worthy once again in a period which would have been pronounced
absolutely impossible by any military critic before the War. All the rearward
villages were choked with the supports. There was rumour also of some new
agency to be used, and wondrous stories were whispered as to its nature and its
powers. The men were in high heart, therefore, and by the middle of September
Rawlinson's Fourth Army, which now included three corps, was ready to spring
forward once again. The main German line was miles behind them, and the
headquarters of British brigades and divisions now nested comfortably in those
commodious dug-outs which two years of unremitting German labour had
constructed&mdash;monuments for many a year to come of their industry and of
their failure. It was realised that the obstacles in front, however formidable,
could not possibly be so difficult as those which had already been surmounted;
and yet our aeroplanes were able to report that the whole country was still
slashed across and across in a fanciful lacework of intricate patterns in which
fire, support, and communication trenches formed one great network of
defence.</p>
<p>The left flank of the Army was formed by Gough's Fifth Army, which had
pushed forward in the manner already described, the Second Corps (Jacob) and
the Canadians (Byng) being in the line upon September 15. On their immediate
right, and joining them in the trenches which face Martinpuich, was Pulteney's
Third Corps, which covered the whole line down to High Wood. From the
north-west of High Wood to the trenches opposite Flers, Horne's long-suffering
Fifteenth Corps still urged the attack which it had commenced upon July 1. The
units, it is true, had changed, but it is difficult to exaggerate the long
strain which had been borne by this commander and his staff. An appreciation of
it was shown by his elevation to the command of the First Army at the
conclusion of the operations. From the right of Horne's Corps to the point of i
unction with the French the line was filled by the Fourteenth Corps, under Lord
Cavan of Ypres fame. In the movement, then, which we are immediately
considering, it is the Third, Fifteenth, and Fourteenth Corps which are
concerned. AVe shall take them as usual from the left, and follow the fortunes
of each until their immediate operations reached some definite term. It is a
gigantic movement upon which we look, for from the Eleventh Division in the
Thiepval sector to the left, along ten miles of crowded trenches to the
Fifty-sixth Division near Combles upon the right, twelve divisions, or about
120,000 infantry, were straining on the leash as the minute hand crawled
towards zero and the shell streams swept ever swifter overhead.</p>
<p>The three divisions which formed the Third Corps were, counting from the
left, the Fifteenth, the Fiftieth, and the Forty-seventh. Of these, the Scots
Division was faced by the strong line of defence in front of Martinpuich and
the village of that name. The north of England territorials were opposite to
the various German trenches which linked Martinpuich to High Wood. The
Londoners were faced by the ghastly charnel-house of High Wood itself, taken
and retaken so often, but still mainly in German hands. At 6:20 A.M. the
assault went forward along the line.</p>
<p>The Fifteenth Division, which had been strengthened by the 103rd Brigade,
advanced upon the line of trenches which separated them from Martinpuich, the
46th Brigade being upon the left and the 45th upon the right. The 10th Highland
Light Infantry upon the left of the 46th Brigade were in close touch with the
Canadians upon their left, forming the right-hand unit of Gough's Army. This
brigade, consisting of Highland Light Infantry, Scots Borderers, and Scottish
Rifles, swarmed over the German defences while their comrades upon the right,
including Royal Scots, Scots Fusiliers, Camerons, and Argylls, were no less
successful. The fact that the whole line was engaged removed the old bugbears
of enfilade fire which had broken up so many of our advances. The German
barrage was heavy, but the advance was so swift and the close fight of the
trenches came so quickly, that it was less effective than of old. A creeping
barrage from the British guns, going forward at a pace of fifty yards a minute,
kept in front of the infantry, whose eager feet were ever on the edge of the
shrapnel. With the 44th Highland Brigade in close support the whole division
swept roaring over the trenches, and with hardly a pause flooded into
Martinpuich, where they met the fringe of the Canadians, whose main advance was
to the north-west of the village.</p>

<p class="caption">Final Position at Capture of Martinpuich</p>
<br>
<p>It was a magnificent advance, and the more noteworthy as the men of the 15th
Division had already been for six unbroken weeks in the line, digging, working,
fighting, and continually under shell-fire. Some groups of Germans in the
village attempted a short and hopeless resistance, but the greater number threw
their arms down and their hands up. It is said that a detachment of six Argylls
got into Martinpuich some little time before their comrades, owing to some gap
in the defences, and that they not only held their own there, but were found
when reinforced to be mounting guard over fifty prisoners. Among many anecdotes
of military virtue may be cited that of a sergeant of this same battalion,
which combined within one episode all the qualities which distinguish the very
best type of British soldier. He first attacked single-handed a number of
German dug-outs. From one of these a German officer was emerging with his hands
up. A soldier dashed forward in act to kill him, upon which the sergeant
threatened his comrade with the bomb which he held in his hand. The German
officer, as a sign of gratitude, presented Cunningham on the spot with his Iron
Cross, which the sergeant at once despatched home to be sold for the benefit of
the wounded. It was a quaintly beautiful exhibition of a noble nature.Immediate
steps were taken to consolidate the village and to connect up firmly with the
Fiftieth Division on the line of Starfish Trench, and with the Canadians on the
line of Gunpit Trench, the general final position being as shown in the
diagram. The trophies upon this occasion amounted to 13 machine-guns, 3
field-guns, 3 heavy howitzers, and about 700 prisoners. There was a
counter-attack upon the morning of September 16, which was easily repulsed: and
afterwards, save for constant heavy shelling, the village was left in the hands
of the victors, until a few days later the Fifteenth was relieved by the
Twenty-third Division.</p>
<p>Whilst this brilliant advance had been conducted upon their left, the
Fiftieth Division, the same north country Territorial Division which had done
such vital service during the gas battle at Ypres, had carried the trenches
opposed to them. They had no village or fixed point at their front with which
their success can be linked; but it may be said generally that they kept the
centre level with the two victorious wings, and that in the evening of
September 15 they extended from the Starfish trench on the left to the new
position of the Forty-seventh Division upon the right. This position was a
magnificent one, for High Wood had been finally taken, and the British line had
been carried forward by these splendid London battalions, until in the evening
the 140th Brigade upon the right had been able to join up with the New
Zealanders upon the Flers line. Advancing upon a one-brigade front, with the
6th and 15th London in the lead, the London territorials, after one slight
check, rushed the wood, and by 11 o'clock not only had it in their complete
possession but had won 150 yards beyond it, where they consolidated. Two tanks
which had been allotted to them were unfortunately unable to make their way
through that terrible chaos of fallen trees, irregular trenches, deep
shell-holes, and putrescent decay, which extended for a third of a mile from
south to north. The wood now passed permanently into British hands, and the
Forty-seventh Division has the honour of the final capture; but in justice to
the Thirty-third and other brave divisions which had at different times taken
and then lost it, it must be remembered that it was a very much more difficult
proposition to hold it when there was no general attack, and when the guns of
the whole German line could concentrate upon the task of making it
uninhabitable.</p>
<p>So much for the capture of High Wood by the Forty-seventh Division. Speaking
generally, it may be said that each of the three divisions forming Pulteney's
Third Corps was equally successful in reaching and in retaining the objectives
assigned for the attack.</p>
<p>The dividing line between the Third Corps and Horne's Fifteenth Corps was to
the south of High Wood in the neighbourhood of Drop Trench. The order of the
divisions in the latter corps from the left was the New Zealanders, the
Forty-first Division, and the Fourteenth Light Division. We shall follow each
in its turn.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Division had confirmed in France the high reputation which
their predecessors had founded in South Africa, and which they had themselves
renewed on the Gallipoli peninsula. They were troops with a splendid spirit,
and no Londoner who has seen their tall lithe figures with the crimson hatbands
which distinguish them from other oversea troops, needs to be told how fine was
their physique. They were fortunate, too, in a divisional commander of great
dash and gallantry. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in this,
their first serious battle, they carried themselves with great distinction and
made good the objective which had been assigned to them.</p>
<p>This objective was the famous Switch Trench between High Wood and Delville
Wood, a section which was held by the Fourth Bavarian Division. Good as the
Bavarians are, they had no chance when it came to close quarters with the
stalwart men of Auckland and Otago, who formed the 2nd Brigade in the front
line of the New Zealand battle. The irresistible fire which they had to face
was heavy and deadly, especially for the Otagos, who were on the left near High
Wood. They poured on, however, in an unbroken array, springing down into Switch
Trench, bayoneting part of the garrison, sending back the survivors as
prisoners, and rapidly forming up once more for a fresh advance. The New
Zealand Rifle Brigade passed over the captured trench and lay down under the
barrage 300 yards beyond it, whence at 6.40 they went forward upon a new
advance with such impetuosity that they could hardly be kept out of the of the
friendly fire in front of them. The next obstacle, Fat Trench, was easily
surmounted, and by noon the Flers Trench and Flers Support Trench had both
fallen to this fine advance. The village of Flers was not in the direct line of
the advance, but the fringe of the New Zealanders passed through the edge of
it, and connected up with the Forty-first Division who had occupied it.</p>
<p>When, as will presently be shown, the left-hand brigade of this division was
temporarily driven back by a sharp German counter-attack, the New Zealanders
were bare upon their right, while a gap existed also upon their left. In spite
of this they held on to their advanced position to the north-west of the
village, the line being strengthened by battalions from Wellington, Hawke's
Bay, and West Coast, who pushed forward into the fight.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 1 6th the reserve brigade had come up and the advance
was renewed as far as Grove Alley upon the left, the Canterbury battalion
clearing and holding the new ground, with the Aucklanders and Otagos in
immediate support. With this new advance the New Zealanders had come forward
3000 yards in two days&mdash;a notable performance&mdash;and were within short
striking distance of the great German systems of Gird Trench and Gird Support.
Two German counters that evening, one upon the Rifle Brigade and the other on
the 1st Wellington battalion, had no success.</p>
<p>On the right of the New Zealanders was the Forty-first Division under one of
the heroes of the original Seventh Division. His objective after surmounting
the German trench lines was the fortified village of Flers. His artillery
support was particularly strong, for his C.R.A. had under him the very
efficient guns of the Twenty-first Division, as well as those of his own unit.
The infantry advance was carried out with the 122nd Brigade on the left, the
124th on the right, and the 123rd in reserve. All the battalions save one were
South of England, and most of them from the home counties, a district which has
furnished some of the finest infantry of the War. As they advanced they were in
close touch with the 2nd New Zealanders upon the left and with the 41st Brigade
upon the right. The first objective* Tea Support Trench, was rapidly overrun by
the Royal Riflemen, Hampshire, and Queen's Surrey battalions who formed the
front line. The garrison surrendered. The continuation of Switch Trench
stretched now in front of them, and both front brigades, with a ten minutes'
interval in favour of the left one, made good the sections in front of them.
The division was fortunate in its tanks, for seven out of ten got over the
first line, and some survived for the whole day, spreading dismay in front of
them and amused appreciation behind. The resistance was by no means desperate
save by a few machine-gunners, who were finally scared or butted out of their
emplacements by the iron monsters. Two tanks did good service, cutting the wire
to the west of Flers road, and the village was opened up to the stormers, who
rushed into it shortly after eight o'clock. One tank went up the east side of
the village and crushed in two houses containing machine-guns, while another
one passed down the main street; and yet another cleared up the west side.
Nowhere upon this day of battle did these engines of warfare justify themselves
so well as at Flers.</p>
<p>By ten o'clock the village was cleared and consolidated, but the German guns
were very active, and there was a strong counter-attack from fresh infantry,
which fell heavily upon the already worn troops who had now passed beyond the
village and got as far as the Box and Cox trenches. There had been a large
number of officer casualties. Shortly after ten o'clock an officer of the 18th
King's Royal Rifles had got far forward with a mixed party of 100 men with some
Lewis guns, and had established a strong point at Box and Cox, which he held
until about one. During those three hours the shell-fall was very severe. The
division had become somewhat scattered, partly owing to the street fighting in
Flers and partly because the 124th Brigade upon the right, although it had kept
touch with the 41st Brigade, had lost touch with its own comrades upon the
left. Finding that its left flank was open, it fell back and took up the line
of the Sunken Road, a quarter of a mile south of Flers, where it remained.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the 122nd Brigade was in some trouble. The pressure of
counter-attack in front of it had become so heavy that there was a general
falling back of the more advanced units. This retrograde movement was stopped
by the Brigade-Major, who collected a section of the 228th Field Company of
Royal Engineers, together with little groups of mixed battalions in Flers
Trench, and sent them forward again, working in conjunction with the New
Zealand 3rd (Rifle) Brigade to the north end of the village, avoiding the
centre of Flers, which was flaring and flaming with shells like the live crater
of a volcano, these troops skirted the flank of the houses and by 2 P.M. had
arrived once more at the north and north-west of the hamlet. Five Vickers guns
were brought up, and the position made good by 2 P.M., the Brigadier-General
being personally most active in this reorganisation of his line.</p>
<p>Whilst the 122nd Brigade had met and overcome this momentary set-back, the
124th upon the right had endured a similar experience and had come out of it
with equal constancy. Shortly after one they had fallen back to Flers Trench,
where they were rallied by their Brigadier, and moved forward again accompanied
by some stray units of the Fourteenth Division. About 3 P.M. they were
reinforced by two fresh companies of the 23rd Middlesex from the reserve
brigade. By half-past four the whole of the remains of the division were north
of Flers in a ragged but indomitable line, steadily winning ground once more,
and pushing back the German attack. By half-past six they had got level with
Flea Trench and Hogshead, and were close to the great Gird Trench. Some of the
124th tried hard to establish themselves in this important work, but lost
heavily from a irresistible established in a cornfield upon their right. At
seven o'clock the advanced line was consolidated, and the scattered units
reorganised so far as the want of officers would permit. Very many of the
latter, including Colonel Ash of the 23rd Middlesex, had been killed or
wounded. The 11th Queen's, from the reserve brigade, was sent up to strengthen
the front posts, while an officer of the same battalion was placed in charge of
the Flers defences. No tank was left intact in the evening, but they had amply
justified themselves and done brilliant work in this section of the
battlefield.</p>
<p>The morning of September 16 saw a forward movement in this quarter upon the
Gird Trench, which was shared in by the divisions upon both wings. The 64th
Brigade of the Twenty-first Division had been placed under the orders of the
General commanding the Forty-first for the purpose of this attack, so that the
subsequent losses fell upon the North-country men. The advance got forward
about 200 yards and established itself close to the great trench, but the
losses were heavy, the machine-guns active, and farther progress was for the
moment impossible. The 9th Yorkshire Light Infantry and 15th Durham Light
Infantry were the chief sufferers in this affair. Upon September 17 the
Fifty-fifth Division relieved the Forty-first, whose record for the battle was
certainly a glorious one, as in one day they had taken Tea Support, Switch
Trench, Flers Trench, Flers village, Box and Cox and Flea Trench, any one of
which might be considered an achievement. How great their efforts were may be
measured by the fact that nearly 50 per cent had fallen. The losses of the
124th were almost as heavy, and those of the 123rd were considerable.
Altogether 149 officers out of 251 and 2994 out of about 7500 were killed or
wounded. The opponents both of the Forty-first and of the Fourteenth Divisions
were the Fifth Bavarian Division, who held the German line from Flers to
Ginchy, and must have been well-nigh annihilated in the action.</p>
<p>The story of the Fourteenth Light Division has been to some extent told in
recounting the experiences of the Forty-first Division, as the two advanced
side by side upon prolongations of the same trenches, with equal dangers and
equal successes. No village fell within the sphere of their actual operations,
though a complete victory would have brought them to Guedecourt, but it was
part of their task to sweep up the German trenches to the north of Delville
Wood, especially the Tea Support and the Switch Trench. This task was committed
to the 41st Brigade, consisting entirely of Rifle Brigade or Royal Rifle
Battalions. The advance was for 500 yards downhill, and then up a long slope of
700 yards, which leads to a plateau about 200 yards across, with the Switch
Trench in the centre of it. The Riflemen swept over this space with a splendid
dash which showed that they had inherited all those qualities of the old 60th
which were cultivated by Sir John Moore and celebrated by Napier, qualities
which were always shared by their comrades of the Rifle Brigade. Regardless of
the enemy's fire, and so eager that they occasionally were struck on the backs
by their own shrapnel, the long thin lines pushed forward in perfect formation,
the 8th Rifles and 8th Rifle Brigade in front, with the 7th Battalions of the
same regiments in close support.</p>
<p>By ten o'clock they had cleared the network of trenches in front of them and
gone forward 2000 yards. The main attack was carried on by the 42nd Brigade,
composed also of Riflemen with the 5th Oxford and Bucks and 5th Shropshires.
This brigade pushed on, keeping in close touch with the Forty-first Division
upon-the left, but gradually losing touch with the Guards upon their fight, so
that a dangerous gap was created. It was covered by the 7th Divisional
Artillery as well as by its own guns. In its advance it passed through the
ranks of its fellow-brigade, which had cleared the first trenches up to and
including the line of the Switch Trench. The front line from the left consisted
of the 5th Shropshires and 9th Rifle Brigade, with the 5th Oxford and Bucks and
9th Rifles behind. From the beginning the brigade was under heavy fire, and the
colonel of the Oxfords was twice wounded, which did not prevent him from still
leading his battalion. The first obstacle. Gap Trench, was safely carried, and
the line swept onwards to Bulls Road where they were cheered by the sight of a
tank engaging and silencing a German battery, though it was itself destroyed in
the moment of victory. The losses in the two rifle battalions were especially
heavy as the right flank was exposed owing to the gap which had formed. This
deadly fire held up the flank, with the result that the Shropshires and Oxfords
who were less exposed to it soon found themselves considerably in advance of
their comrades, where they formed a line which was extended about mid-day by
the arrival of the 9th Rifles. At this period large reinforcements of the enemy
were seen flocking into Gird Trench and Gird Support Trench in front. So strong
were they that they attempted a counter-attack upon the right front of the 42nd
Brigade, but this was brought to a stand, and finally broken up by rifle and
Lewis-gun fire. The supporting 43rd Brigade came up in the evening and took
over the ground gained, together with four German guns which had been captured.
The final result, therefore, was that the division had won its way to the edge
of that Gird Trench which represented the next great task which should be
attempted by the Army&mdash;a task which, as already shown, was attempted by
three divisions upon the morning of September 16, but proved to be too
formidable for the their depleted and wearied ranks.</p>
<p>This fine advance of the Fourteenth Division brought them over the low ridge
which had faced them. "It was a grand sight," says a Rifleman, "to see the
promised land lying green at one's feet, with Germans moving across the open,
and ammunition waggons going at a trot to and from their batteries, but the
grandest sight of the day was seeing the battalions advance, the men dancing
along only too anxious to get to close grips with the enemy."</p>
<p>Among many brave deeds recorded of the division there was none finer than
those of a captain and a corporal, both of the Medical Service, who stayed in
the open all day in spite of wounds, tending those who were hardly worse than
themselves.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 16 there was an advance of the 43rd Brigade,
consisting of Somerset, Durham, Cornish, and Yorkshire Light Infantry, which
succeeded in establishing itself in the Gird Trench, though they found it
impossible to get as far as the Gird Support. This successful advance was
supported by the Shropshire and Oxford battalions of the 42nd Brigade, who
established flank protections and got into touch with the Guards in Gap Trench
upon the right. The Fourteenth Division was withdrawn from the line after this,
and their place taken by the Twenty-first.</p>
<p>We have now briefly considered the operations carried out during this great
battle by Horne's Fifteenth Corps. Upon their right, stretching from the
neighbourhood of Ginchy to the left of the French Army in the neighbourhood of
Combles, was Cavan's Fourteenth Corps, which contained in its battle line the
Guards, the Sixth Division, and the 56th London Territorial Division. Taking
them, as always, from of the the left, we will begin by tracing the progress of
the Guards.</p>
<p>The Guards Division had taken over the Ginchy Section some days previously
from the Irish Division, and had at once found themselves involved in very
[heavy fighting, which left them a good deal weakened [for the great advance.
They were faced by a strong system of trenches, and especially by one
stronghold upon their right front, called the Quadrilateral, which was a most
formidable thorn, not only in their side but also in that of the Sixth Division
upon the right. On September 13 and 14 these two divisions strove hard, and
sustained heavy losses in the endeavour to clear their front of, and to
outflank, this serious obstacle, and some account of these preliminary
operations may be here introduced, although, as explained, they were antecedent
to the general engagement. The attack upon the German trenches on the evening
of September 13 was begun by the Sixth Division, which advanced with the 71st
Brigade upon the left, the Sixteenth upon the right, and the Eighteenth in
reserve. For 500 yards the advance was successful until it reached the sunken
road which leads from Ginchy to Leuze Wood. Here the leading battalions of the
71st Brigade, the 2nd Sherwood Foresters upon the left and the 9th Suffolk upon
the right, were held up by a furious fire which caused them heavy losses. The
8th Bedford, one of the leading battalions of the 16th Brigade, was also
heavily punished. Many officers fell, including Major Mack of the Suffolks, a
civilian-bred soldier over sixty years of age, who had distinguished himself by
his fiery courage. The 2nd Brigade of Guards had advanced upon the left, near
Ginchy Telegraph, and had also forced their way as far as the road, where they
were held up partly by a terrific barrage from the north-east and partly by the
murderous fire from the Quadrangle. The whole line dug in upon the ground they
had won and waited for a farther push in the morning. In this action No. 2
Company of the 2nd Irish Guards suffered heavy casualties from close-range
fire.</p>
<p>On September 14 a second attempt was made to get forward, the action being a
purely local one, but extending over a considerable space from Ginchy to near
Leuze Wood, with its centre on the line of Ginchy Telegraph. The 3rd Brigade of
Guards came into action this morning and made some progress in the orchard
north of Ginchy. At the same time, the 2nd Sherwoods got astride of the little
railway which intersected their position. The gains were inconsiderable,
however, which could not be said for the losses, mostly due to machine-gun fire
from the Quadrangle. The fact that this point was still untaken gave the whole
Fourteenth Corps a very difficult start for the general action upon September
15 to which we now come.</p>
<p>On the signal for the general advance the Guards Division advanced on the
front between Delville Wood and Ginchy. The 1st Guards Brigade was on the left,
the 2nd on the right, and the 3rd in reserve. The front line of battalions
counting from the left were the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Coldstreams with the 3rd
Grenadiers as right flank. Behind, in the second line from the left, were the
1st Irish, 2nd Grenadiers, 2nd Irish, and 1st Scots. Disregarding the
Quadrilateral upon their right, which was holding up the Sixth Division, the
Guards swept magnificently onwards, losing many officers and men, but never
their direction or formation. From 6:20 in the morning until 4 P.M. they
overcame one obstacle after another, and continually advanced, though the
progress was unequal at different points on the line. There was a short sharp
bout of hand-to-hand fighting in the front line trench, but the rush of the
heavy disciplined Guardsmen was irresistible, and the defenders were soon
overwhelmed. In this melee the battalions got badly mixed up, part of the 2nd
Irish getting carried away by the 1st Brigade. The 1st Brigade found a more
formidable obstacle in front of them in Vat Alley, but this also was cleared
after a struggle, the left-hand I units getting mixed with the right-hand units
of the Fourteenth Division. About one o'clock the 3rd Coldstreams on the
extreme left were held up by a wired strong point. They were weak in numbers
and almost without officers, so they dug in as best they could and waited. On
the right the 2nd Brigade made good progress, and about mid-day its leading
line topped the low ridge and saw the land of promise beyond, the green slope
leading up to Lesboeufs, and in the middle of the slope, not more than a
thousand yards away, a battery of field-guns raining shrapnel upon them. They
could get no farther, and they consolidated at this point, digging in under
heavy shell-fire. The German infantry was seen at one time marching down in
artillery formation for a counter-attack, but the movement was soon dispersed.
In the evening the front line, terribly worn and consisting of a jumble of
exhausted men, held on firmly to the last inch that they had won. Too weak to
advance and too proud to retire, they lay under the torment of the shells and
waited for dusk. The colonel of the 3rd Coldstreams, in temporary command of
his brigade, had sent back during the afternoon for help, and the 2nd Scots
were sent up from the 3rd Brigade, but the German barrage was so terrific that
they sustained very heavy losses, including Colonel Tempest, Wynne-Finch, the
adjutant, and many other officers. The battalion, or what remained of it,
arrived in time to help to crush a dangerous counter-attack, which was sweeping
down from between Guedecourt and Lesboeufs, a repulse which was entirely
inflicted by rifle and Lewis-gun fire. A lieutenant seems to have been the
senior officer present at this critical moment, and to have met it as our
subalterns have so often met large emergencies during the War. The advanced
line was held until upon the next day the 60th Brigade, and finally the whole
of the Twentieth Division, took over the new positions, which may be regarded
as a protective flank line in continuation of that of the Fifty-sixth Division.
It should be mentioned that the 61st Brigade of the Twentieth Division had been
lent to the Guards during the battle, and had done very sterling and essential
work. For a short time the Guards were rested after this splendid but costly
service.</p>
<p>In the meantime the gallant Sixth Division was left face to face with the
hardest problem of all, the Quadrilateral trenches, which, as the name would
indicate, were as formidable in the flanks or rear as in front. With a tenacity
which was worthy of the traditions of this great division it settled down to
the task of clearing its front, meeting with check after check, but carrying on
day and night until the thing was done. On the first assault upon September 15,
the 1st Leicesters of the 71st Brigade were able to make some progress, but the
8th Bedford of the 16th Brigade, who shared the attack, were completely held up
at the starting-point by the terrific fire, while the 1st Buffs had heavy
losses in endeavouring to come up to their aid. By about mid-day a mixture of
battalions, which numbered about 200 of the York and Lancasters, 50 Buffs and
50 Bedfords, had made their way into the advanced German line, but the
Quadrilateral was still intact. The General, seeing the certain losses and
uncertain results which must follow from a frontal attack, determined to work
round the obstacle, and before evening the 16th Brigade, which had already lost
1200 men, was ready for the advance. The 18th Brigade had gone forward past the
Quadrilateral upon the left, working up to the Ginchy-Morval road, and in close
touch with the 1st Scots Guards on the extreme flank of the Guards Division. It
now worked down towards the north face of the German stronghold, and in the
course of September 16 the 2nd Durham Light Infantry, by a bold advance laid
hold of the northern trench of the Quadrilateral down to within a hundred yards
of the Ginchy-Morval road. Here they were relieved by the 1st West Yorks, who
took over the task upon the 17th, keeping up constant pressure upon the
garrison whose resistance was admirable. These brave men belonged to the One
hundred and eighty-fifth German Division. By this time they were isolated, as
the British wave had rolled far past them on either side, but their spirit was
as high as ever. A second trench to the north of the work was rushed upon
September 17 by the Leicesters, who bayoneted fifty Germans in a hand-to-hand
conflict. Early in the morning of September 18 came the end when, British
battalions, led by the 1st Shropshire Light Infantry, closed suddenly in and
stormed the position. Seven machine-guns (five of which fell to the
Shropshires) and a few hundred exhausted or wounded prisoners represented the
trophies of this very difficult operation. The Sixth Division now connected up
with the Twentieth upon their left, and with the Fifty-sixth upon their right,
after which, upon September 19, they handed over their front for a time to the
Fifth Division.</p>
<p>There now only remains the Fifty-sixth Division upon the extreme right of
the Army&mdash;the division which contained many of the crack London
Territorial Battalions, re-formed and reinforced since its terrible losses at
the Gommecourt Salient upon July 1. In following the fortunes of this fine
division upon September 15, it is necessary to go back for some days, as a
series of operations had been undertaken before the great battle, which were as
arduous as the battle itself. On coming into the line on September 9, the
division had at once been given the task of advancing that wing of the Army.
Upon that date the 168th and 169th Brigades were attacking upon the line of the
road which connects Ginchy with Combles, the general objects of the advance
being gradually to outflank Combles on the one side and the Quadrilateral upon
the other. Some ground was permanently gained by both brigades upon that day,
the Victoria Rifles and the 4th London doing most of the fighting.</p>

<p class="caption">Attack on Quadrilateral, September 15, 1916</p>
<br>
<p>Upon September 10 the advance was continued, a scattered clump of trees
called Leuze Wood being The the immediate obstacle in front of the right-hand
brigade, while the left-hand brigade was trying to get into touch with the
division upon their left, and were confronted by the continuation of the same
system of trenches. The 169th Brigade upon the right was advancing through
Leuze Wood, and suffered heavy losses before reaching its objective. On the
left the London Scottish and the Rangers were extending east along the Ginchy
road, endeavouring to link up with the Guards, for there was an awkward gap at
that date between the divisions. This was filled, however, by the advent of the
Fifth and subsequently of the Sixth Division. The object of all the above
operations was to get the right flank of the Army into its allotted position
for the battle to come. Upon September 15 the London Division went forward with
the whole line at 6:20 in the morning, the 167th Brigade on the left, the 169th
upon the right. The original direction of advance had been north and south, but
it soon became almost from west to east as the division, pivoting upon Leuze
Wood, swung round to attack Bouleaux Wood to the north of it, and to hold a
defensive flank for the whole army. Their front was a very narrow one to allow
for the fact that their essential work was lateral.</p>
<p>The 167th Brigade fought its way bravely into Bouleaux Wood, where they
endured the usual horrors of this forest fighting, which came especially upon
the 7th Middlesex battalion, who lost 400 men, chiefly from the fire of unseen
machine-guns. There was a very heavy barrage between Ginchy and Bouleaux Wood
so that all reserves and supports endured heavy losses before they could get
up. By mid-day the 1st London and the 8th were involved in the wood and some
progress was being made, while the 2nd London The of the 169th Brigade had
taken and consolidated a trench near the Sunken Road, but a further attack upon
a second trench to the east of Leuze Wood, two days later, was a failure. On
this same day, September 18, the 168th Brigade relieved the 167th in Bouleaux
Wood, while the whole division, like one blade of a scissors, edged its way
eastwards towards Combles to meet the French Second Division, who were closing
in from the other side. Already rumours were current that the Germans were
evacuating this important little town, but many very active German trenches and
strong points still lay all round it, through which the Allies, from either
side, were endeavouring to force their way. On the night of September 18-19,
the 5th Cheshires, pioneer battalion of the division, constructed a long trench
parallel to Bouleaux Wood, which formed a defensive flank for the operations.
The whole of this wood had now been cleared with the exception of the extreme
northern corner. Here we may leave the Fifty-sixth Division, for the fall of
Combles will fit in more properly to our next survey, when we shall have once
again to go down the whole line from left to right and to show one more stage
in the advance.</p>
<p>This Battle of Flers may be said to mark an epoch in military history on
account of the use of the so-called tank, an instrument which had no vital
effect upon the course of the fight, but which was obviously capable of being
much enlarged, and of being made in every way more formidable. It had been a
common criticism up to this date that our military equipment had always been an
imitation, very belated, of that of our enemy. Now at last Great Britain,
warming to the War, was giving her inventive and manufacturing as well as her
military talents full scope&mdash;and the tank was the first-born of her fancy.
It is a matter of history that Britain has been the inventor of processes and
Germany the adapter of them, so that we had a valuable asset in that direction
could we break through our bonds of red tape and get without hindrance from the
thinker in his study to the fighter in the trench. Those who have had the
experience of discussing any military problem in the Press, and have found by
the next post fifty letters from men of all ranks and professions, presenting
solutions for it, can best understand how active is the inventive brain of the
country. In this instance, Mr. Winston Churchill is said, during his tenure of
office, to have first conceived the idea of the tanks, but the actual details
were worked out by a number of men. Especially they are owing to Colonel Stern,
a civilian before the War, who used his knowledge of motor manufacture and his
great organising ability to put the construction through in the shortest time,
to Commander d'Eyncourt of the Navy, and to Colonel Swinton, R.E., who looked
after the crews and equipment. On an average six of these engines, strange
modern resuscitations of the war-chariots of our ancestors, were allotted to
each division. The whole affair was frankly experimental, and many got into
trouble through the breakdown of machinery, the limits of carrying capacity,
and the slipping of the caterpillar driving-bands at the sides. Their pace,
too, was against them, as they could only go twenty yards per minute as against
the fifty of the infantry. Hence they had to be sent ahead down lanes in the
barrage, with the result that the element of surprise was lessened. Their
vision also was very defective, and they were bad neighbours, as they drew
fire. The result was a very mixed report from various Divisional Commanders,
some of whom swore by, and others at them. The net result, however, was summed
up by the words of commendation from General Haig in his despatch, and there
were some cases, as at Flers itself, where the work done was simply invaluable,
and the machine-guns were nosed out and rooted up before they could do any
damage. The adventures of individual tanks could, and no doubt will, fill a
volume to themselves, some of them, either in ignorance or recklessness,
wandering deep into the enemy's lines, and amazing rearward batteries by their
sudden uncouth appearance. Several were destroyed, but none actually fell into
the German hands. Enough was done to show their possibilities, and also to
prove that the Navy and the Flying Service had not sufficed to exhaust our
amazing supply of high-spirited youths ready to undertake the most
nerve-shaking tasks so long as a touch of sport gave them a flavour. The very
names of these land cruisers, <i>Cr&egrave;me de Menthe</i> and the like,
showed the joyous, debonair spirit in which their crews faced the unknown
dangers of their new calling.</p>
<p>Summing up the events of September 15, it was without any doubt the greatest
British victory, though not the most important, which had been gained up to
date in the War. July 1 was the most important, and all subsequent ones arose
from it, since it was then that the Chinese Wall of Germany was breached. July
14 was also a considerable victory, but it was only a portion of the line which
was attacked, and that portion was partly regained for a time by the German
counter-attacks. The battle of September 15, however, was on as huge a scale as
that of July 1, but was devoid of those long stretches of untaken trench which
made us pay so heavy a price for our victory. From the Pozi&egrave;res Ridge
upon the left to Bouleaux Wood upon the right twelve divisions moved forward to
victory, and, save in the small section of the Quadrilateral, everything gave
way at once to that majestic advance. The ultimate objectives had been
carefully defined, for the Battle of Loos had taught us that the infantry must
not outrun the guns, but this pre-ordained limit was attained at almost every
spot. Martinpuich, High Wood, Flers, Delville, and Leuze Wood, all passed
permanently within the British lines, and the trophies of victory amounted to
5000 prisoners and a dozen guns. At this stage no less than 21,000 prisoners
had been taken by the British and 34,000 by the French since the great series
of battles was commenced upon July 1.</p>

GAINING OF THE THIEPVAL RIDGE</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Assault on Thiepval by Eighteenth Division&mdash;Heavy
fighting&mdash;Cooperation of Eleventh Division&mdash;Fall of Thiepval
&mdash;Fall of Schwaben Redoubt&mdash;Taking of Stuff Redoubt &mdash; Important
gains on the Ridge</p>
<p class="first">HAVING treated the successful advance made by Rawlinson's
Fourth Army upon September 15, it would be well before continuing the narrative
of their further efforts to return to Gough's Army upon the north, the right
Canadian wing of which had captured Courcelette, but which was occupied in the
main with the advance upon the Thiepval Ridge.</p>
<p>The actual capture of Thiepval was an operation of such importance that it
must be treated in some detail. The village, or rather the position, was a
thorn in the side of the British, as it lay with its veteran garrison of
W&uuml;rtembergers, girdled round and flanked by formidable systems of trenches
upon the extreme left of their line. Just above Thiepval was a long slope
ending in a marked ridge, which was topped by the Schwaben Redoubt. Both armies
recognised the extreme importance of this position, since its capture would
mean a fire-command over all the German positions to the north of the Ancre,
while without it the British could never reap the full result of their success
in breaking the line upon July 1. For this reason, instructions had been given
to the picked German troops who held it to resist at all costs, even to the
death. They had massed at least four hundred guns in order to beat down every
assault. Yet the attempt must be made, and it was assigned to Jacob's Second
Corps, the actual Divisions engaged being the Eighteenth and the Eleventh, both
of them units recruited in the South of England. The latter was distinguished
as the first English Division of the New Armies, while the former had already
gained great distinction in the early days of the Somme battle when they
captured Trones Wood. They were supported in their difficult venture by a
considerable concentration of artillery, which included the guns of the
Twenty-fifth and Forty-ninth Divisions as well as their own. Jacob, their Corps
leader, was an officer who had risen from the command of an Anglo Indian
Brigade to that of a Corps within two years. The whole operation, like all
others in this region, was under the direction of Sir Hubert Gough.</p>

<p class="caption">Plan illustrating the Capture of Thiepval, September 26,
October 5, 1916</p>
<br>
<p>Every possible preparation was made for the assault, and all the
requirements of prolonged warfare were used to minimise the losses and ensure
the success of the storm-troops. Four tanks were brought up to co-operate, and
one of them, as will be shown, was of vital use at a critical moment.
Instructions were given to the advancing battalions to let their own shrapnel
strike within a few yards of their toes as they advanced, huddling in a thick
line behind the screen of falling bullets which beat down the machine-guns in
front. With fine judgment in some cases the supports were taken out of the
advanced trenches and concealed here or there so that the answering barrage of
the enemy fell upon emptiness. So war-wise were the British, and so cool their
dispositions, that certain of the enemy trenches were actually exempted from
bombardment, so that they might form an intact nucleus of defence when the
place was taken.</p>
<p>The Canadian Corps were to attack from Courcelette upon the right, but their
advance was only indirectly concerned with Thiepval Village, being directed
towards the ridge which runs north-west of Courcelette to the Schwaben Redoubt.
Next to the Canadians on the left was the Eleventh Division, and on their left
the Thirteenth, which had been strengthened by the addition of the 146th
Brigade of the Forty-ninth Division. The latter brigade held the original
British front line during the action so as to release the whole of the
Eighteenth Division for the advance. The immediate objective of this division
was Thiepval Village, to be followed by the Schwaben Redoubt. Those of the
Eleventh Division on its right were Zollern and Stuff Redoubts.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth Division assaulted with two brigades, the 53rd on the right,
the 54th on the left, each being confronted by a network of trenches backed by
portions of the shattered village. The advance was from south to north, and at
right angles to the original British trench line. The hour of fate was 12.35 in
the afternoon of September 26.</p>
<p>The average breadth of No Man's Land was 250 yards, which was crossed by
these steady troops at a slow, plodding walk, the pace being regulated by the
searching barrage, which lingered over every shell hole in front of them.
Through the hard work of the sappers and Sussex pioneers, the assembly trenches
had been pushed well out, otherwise the task would have been more
formidable.</p>
<p>Following the fortunes of the 53rd Brigade upon the right, its movements
were supposed to synchronise with those of the 33rd Brigade upon the left flank
of the Eleventh Division. The right advanced battalion was the 8th Suffolk,
with the 10th Essex upon the left, each of them in six waves. Close at their
heels came the 8th Norfolk, whose task was to search dug-outs and generally to
consolidate the ground won. The front line of stormers rolled over Joseph
Trench, which was the German advanced position, but before they had reached it
there was a strange eruption of half-dressed unarmed Germans yelling with
terror and bolting through the barrage. Many of them dashed through the stolid
Suffolks, who took no notice of them, but let them pass. Others lost their
nerve like rabbits at a battle, and darted here and there between the lines
until the shrapnel found them. It was an omen of victory that such clear signs
of shaken moral should be evident so early in the day. There was sterner stuff
behind, however, as our men were speedily to learn.</p>
<p>The advance went steadily forward, cleaning up the trenches as it went, and
crossing Schwaben Trench, Zollern Trench, and Bulgar Trench, in each of which
there was sharp resistance, only quelled by the immediate presence of our Lewis
guns, or occasionally by the rush of a few determined men with bayonets. It was
2:30 before the advance was brought to a temporary stand by machine-gun fire
from the right. After that hour a small party of Suffolks under Lieutenant
Mason got forward some distance ahead, and made a strong point which they held
till evening, this gallant young officer falling under the enemy's fire.</p>
<p>The The success of the Suffolks upon the right was equalled by that of the
Essex on the left, passing through the eastern portion of Thiepval without
great loss, for the usual machine-gun fire seemed to have been stamped out by
the British guns. The whole of this fine advance of the 53rd Brigade covered
about 1000 yards in depth and accounted for a great number of the enemy in
killed, wounded, and prisoners. The advance made and the cost paid both showed
that our officers and soldiers were learning the lessons of modern warfare with
that swift adaptability which Britain has shown in every phase of this terrific
and prolonged test. This old, old nation's blood has flowed into so many
younger ones that her own vitality might well be exhausted; but she has, on the
contrary, above all the combatants, given evidence of the supple elasticity of
youth, moulding herself in an instant to every movement of the grim giant with
whom she fought.</p>
<p>Great as had been the success of the 53rd Brigade, it was not possible for
them to get on to the Schwaben Redoubt, their ultimate objective, because, as
will be shown, matters were more difficult upon the left, and one corner of the
village was still in German possession. They ended the day, therefore, with two
battalions consolidating the Zollern Line, a third in support in the Schwaben
Trench, and a fourth, the 6th Berks, bringing up munitions and food to their
exhausted but victorious comrades. The front line was much mixed, but the men
were in good heart, and a visit from their Brigadier in the early morning of
the 27th did much to reassure them. To carry on the story of this brigade to
the conclusion of the attack it may be added that the whole of the 27th was
spent on consolidation and on a daring reconnaissance by a captain of the 53rd
Trench Mortar Battery, who crawled forward alone, and made it clear by his
report that a new concerted effort was necessary before the Brigade could
advance.</p>
<p>We shall now return to 12.35 P.M. on September 26, and follow the 54th
Brigade upon the left. The advance was carried out by the 12th Middlesex, with
instructions to attack the village, and by the 11th Royal Fusiliers, whose task
was to clear the maze of trenches and dug-outs upon the west of the village,
while the 6th Northamptons were to be in close support. So difficult was the
task, that a frontage of only 300 yards was allotted to the Brigade, so as to
ensure weight of attack&mdash;the Fusiliers having a front line of one
platoon.</p>
<p>The advance ran constantly into a network of trenches with nodal strong
points which were held with resolution and could only be carried by fierce
hand-to-hand fighting. Captain Thompson, Lieutenants Miall-Smith and Cornaby,
and many of their Fusiliers in the leading company, were killed or wounded in
this desperate business. So stern was the fight that the Fusiliers on the left
got far behind their own barrage, and also behind their Middlesex comrades on
the right, who swept up as far as the ch&acirc;teau before they were brought to
a temporary halt. Here, at the very vital moment, one of the tanks, the only
one still available, came gliding forward and put out of action the
machine-guns of the ch&acirc;teau, breaking down in the effort, and remaining
on the scene of its success. Across the whole front of the advance there were
now a series of small conflicts at close quarters, so stubborn that the left
wing of the Fusiliers was held stationary in constant combat for the rest of
the day. Extraordinary initiative was shown by privates of both leading
battalions when left without officers in this scattered fighting, and here, no
doubt, we have a result depending upon the formed educated stuff which went to
the making of such troops as these London units of the new armies. Private
Edwards and Private Ryder each gained their V.C. at this stage of the action by
single-handed advances which carried forward the line. Corporal Tovey lost his
life in a similar gallant venture, bayoneting single-handed the crew of a
machine-gun and silencing it. Fierce battles raged round garrisoned dug-outs,
where no quarter was given or taken on either side. One considerable garrison
refused to surrender and perished horribly in the flames of their wood-lined
refuge. Those who fled from their refuges were cut down by Lewis guns, a
lieutenant of the Fusiliers getting 50 in this manner. This officer also
distinguished himself by his use of a captured map, which enabled him to lead
his men to the central telephone installation, where 20 operators were seized
by a corporal and two files of Fusiliers, who afterwards put the wires out of
gear.</p>
<p>These great results had not been obtained without heavy losses. Colonel Carr
of the Fusiliers, Major Hudson, and the Adjutant had all fallen. About three in
the afternoon the village had all been cleared save the north-west corner, but
the battalions were very mixed, the barrage deadly, the order of the attack out
of gear, and the position still insecure. The 54th Brigade was well up with the
53rd upon the right, but upon the left it was held up as already described. The
German egg bombs were falling in this area as thick as snowballs in a schoolboy
battle, while the more formidable stick bombs were often to be seen, twenty at
a time, in the air.</p>
<p>A great deal now depended upon the supports, as the front line was evidently
spent and held. The immediate support was the 6th Northamptons. In moving
forward it lost both Colonel Ripley and the Adjutant, and many officers fell,
two companies being left entirely to the charge of the sergeants, who rose
finely to their responsibilities. When by four o'clock the battalion had got up
through the barrage, there were only two unwounded company officers left
standing, both second lieutenants. It was one more demonstration of the fact
that a modern barrage can create a zone through which it is practically
impossible for unarmoured troops to move. The result was that the battalion was
so weak by the time it got up, that it was less a support to others than a unit
which was in need of support. The three depleted battalions simply held their
line, therefore, until night, and under the cover of darkness they were all
drawn off, and the remaining battalion, the 7th Bedfords, took their place.
That this could be done at night in strange trenches within a few yards of the
German line is a feat which soldiers will best appreciate. The result was that
as day broke on the 27th the Germans were faced not by a fringe of exhausted
men, but by a perfectly fresh battalion which was ready and eager for immediate
attack.</p>
<p>The whole of Thiepval had been taken upon the 26th, save only the north-west
corner, and it was upon this that two companies of the Bedfords were now
directed, their objectives being defined for them by a captain who had fought
over the ground the day before. Thanks to the gallant leadership of another
captain and of Lieutenant Adlam (the latter gaining his Victoria Cross), the
place was carried at small loss, and this last refuge of the Thiepval Germans
was cleared out. It was a glorious achievement, for by it this very strong
point, held against all attacks, French or British, for two years, passed
permanently into our hands. The losses were not excessive for such a gain,
amounting to about 1500 men. Those of the Germans were very much heavier, and
included 600 prisoners drawn from four different regiments. Over 1000 dead were
counted.</p>
<p>We will now hark back to 12.35 P.M., the hour of assault, and follow the
fortunes of the Eleventh or first English Division of the New Armies which was
advancing, upon the right of the Eighteenth Division. Within half an hour of
the assault the 33rd Brigade and the 34th had crossed both the Joseph and the
Schwaben Trenches, the 6th Borders, 9th Sherwood Foresters, 8th Northumberland
Fusiliers, and 9th Lancashire Fusiliers forming the front line. Keeping some
sort of touch with Maxse's men on the left they pushed on until their right
wing was held up by violent machine-gun fire from the Zollern Redoubt and from
Mouquet Farm, the losses falling especially upon the 5th Dorsets. Between six
and seven in the evening a mixed body of troops from the division, assisted by
the machine-guns of two stranded tanks, attacked Mouquet and finally carried
it.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth Division had still a very formidable task before it to be
undertaken with the co-operation of the Eleventh upon its right. This was the
capture of the formidable stronghold, made up of many trenches and called the
Schwaben Redoubt. It was a thousand yards distant up a long broken slope. No
time was lost in tackling this new labour, and at 1 P.M. on September 28 the
troops moved forward once again, the same brigades being used, but the worn
battalions being replaced by fresh units drawn from the 55th Brigade. The 53rd
Brigade on the right had the undefeatable Suffolks and the 7th Queen's Surreys
in the van with Norfolks and Essex behind. The 54th upon a narrower front had
the 7th Bedfords in front, with the 5th West Yorks from the Forty-ninth
Division in immediate support, the Buffs and East Surrey being in Divisional
Reserve. The Germans had got a captive balloon into the air, but their gunnery
was not particularly improved thereby.</p>
<p>At the first rush the Suffolk and Queen's on the right took Bulgar and
Martin Trenches, while the Eleventh Division took Hessian. By 2:30 Market
Trench had also fallen. The troops were now well up to Schwaben, and small
groups of men pushed their way home in spite of a furious resistance. The
Eleventh Division had won home on the right, and the Suffolks were in touch
with them and with the Queen's, so that the position before evening was
thoroughly sound. Part of this enormous stronghold was still in German hands,
however, and all our efforts could not give us complete control.</p>
<p>Upon the left the 7th Bedfords, leading the 54th Brigade, had made a very
notable advance, crossing Market Trench and getting well up to the western face
of the great Redoubt. The Reserves, however, lost direction amid the chaos of
shell-holes and trenches, drifting away to the left. The Schwaben was occupied
at several points, and the first-fruits of that commanding position were at
once picked, for the light machine-guns were turned upon the German fugitives
as they they rushed with bent backs down the sloping trenches which led to St.
Pierre Divion. The West Yorkshires were well up, and for a time these two
battalions and the Germans seem to have equally divided this portion of the
trench between them. There was stark fighting everywhere with bomb and bayonet,
neither side flinching, and both so mixed up that neither German nor British
commanders could tell how the units lay. In such a case a General can only
trust to his men, and a British General seldom trusts in vain.</p>
<p>As night fell in this confused scene where along the whole line the
Eighteenth Division had reached its objective but had not cleared it, attempts
were made to bring up new men, the Berkshires, a battalion of young drafts,
relieving the Suffolks on the right. In the morning two local counter-attacks
by the Germans succeeded in enlarging their area. At the same time the 55th
Brigade took over the front, the four battalions being reunited under their
own! Brigadier. It was clear that the German line was thickening, for it was a
matter of desperate urgency to them to recover the Redoubt. They still held the
northern end of the labyrinth. On September 30 the East Surreys, moving up
behind a massive barrage, took it by storm, but were driven out again before
they could get their roots down. The Germans, encouraged by their success,
surged south again, but could make no headway. On October 1 the tide set
northwards once more, and the Buffs gained some ground. From then till October
5, when the Eighteenth Division was relieved by the Thirty-ninth, there were
incessant alarms and excursions, having the net result that at the latter date
the whole Redoubt with the exception of one small section, afterwards taken by
the Thirty-ninth, was in our hands. So ended for the moment the splendid
service of the Eighteenth Division. Nearly 2000 officers and men had fallen in
the Schwaben operations, apart from the 1500 paid for Thiepval. It is certain,
however, that the Schwaben garrison had suffered as much, and they left 232
prisoners in the hands of the victors.</p>
<p>For the purpose of continuity of narrative, we have kept our attention fixed
upon the Eighteenth Division, but the Eleventh Division, which we have left at
Mouquet Farm some pages before, had been doing equally good work upon the
right. In the afternoon of September 27 the 6th Borders, rushing suddenly from
Zollern Trench, made a lodgment in Hessian Trench, to which they resolutely
clung. On their left the 6th Yorks and 9th West Yorks had also advanced and
gained permanent ground, winning their way into the southern edge of Stuff
Redoubt. Here they had to face a desperate counter-attack, but Captain White,
with a mixed party of the battalions named, held on against all odds, winning
his V.C. by his extraordinary exertions. During the whole of September 29 the
pressure at this point was extreme, but the divisional artillery showed itself
to be extremely efficient, and covered the exhausted infantry with a most
comforting barrage.</p>
<p>The 32nd Brigade was now brought up, and on September 30 the advance was
resumed, the whole of this brigade and the 6th Lincolns and 7th South Staffords
of the 33rd being strongly engaged. The results were admirable, as the whole of
Hessian Trench and the south of Stuff Redoubt were occupied. That night the
Eleventh Division was relieved by the Twenty-fifth, and it will now be told how
the conquest of the Ridge was finally achieved. The Eleventh withdrew after
having done splendid work and sustained losses of 144 officers and 3500 men.
Their prisoners amounted to 30 officers and 1125 of all ranks, with a great
number of machine-guns and trench mortars.</p>
<p>After the fall of Thiepval and the operations which immediately followed it
the front British line in this quarter ran approximately east and west along
the Thiepval-Courcelette ridge. As far as part of the front was concerned we
had observation over the Valley of the Ancre, but in another part the Germans
still held on to the Stuff Redoubt, and thence for a stretch they were still on
the crest and had the observation. The Stuff Redoubt itself on the southern
face had been occupied by the Eleventh, when the Schwaben Redoubt was taken by
the Eighteenth Division, but the northern faces of both were still in the hands
of the enemy. These had now to be taken in order to clear up the line. A
further stronghold, called The Mounds, immediately to the north, came also
within the operation.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fifth Division had, as stated, relieved the Eleventh, and this
new task was handed over to it. Upon October 9 the first attack was made by the
10th Cheshires, and although their full objective was not reached, the result
was satisfactory, a lodgment being made and 100 of the garrison captured, with
slight casualties to the stormers, thanks to the good barrage and the
workmanlike way in which they took advantage of it. A strong attempt on the
part of the Germans to prevent consolidation and to throw out the intruders was
quite unsuccessful.</p>

"Stuff Redoubt System, showing Hessian, Regina, and Stuff"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Stuff Redoubt System, showing Hessian, Regina, and Stuff</p>
<br>
<p>The 8th North Lancs were now placed in the position of the Cheshires, while
the Thirty-ninth Division upon the left joined in the pressure. Upon October 10
an attack was made by the 1 6th Sherwoods supported by the 17th Rifles of the
117th Brigade; but it had no success. On the 12th there was a renewed attack by
units of the 118th Brigade, chiefly the 4th Black Watch. This succeeded in
advancing the line for a short distance, and upon October 15 it repulsed two
local counter-attacks. Upon the right the 8th North Lanes upon October 14 had a
very successful advance, in which they carried with moderate loss the stretch
of line opposite, as well as the position called The Mounds. Two machine-guns
and 125 prisoners were taken.</p>
<p>The British now had observation along the whole ridge with a line of
observation posts pushed out beyond the crest. There were formidable obstacles
upon their right front, however, where the Regina Trench and a heavily
fortified quadrilateral system lay in front of the troops already mentioned,
and also of the Canadians on the Courcelette line. In order to get ready for
the next advance there was some sidestepping of units, the hard- worked
Eighteenth coming in on the right next the Canadians, the Twenty-fifth moving
along, and the Thirty-ninth coming closer on the left. On October 8 the
Canadians had a sharp action, in which the Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta,
and Winnipeg Battalions showed their usual resolution, and took a couple of
hundred prisoners, but were unable to gain much ground. A concerted movement of
the whole line was now organised.</p>
<p>The great Stuff Trench, which was roughly a continuation of the Regina, was
opposite the centre of the attack, and was distant some 300 yards from the
British front. The barrage arrangements coordinated by the Second Corps
(Jacob), to which these units now belonged, worked most admirably. The attack
was made all along the line and was eminently successful. At 12.35 upon October
21 the general advance began, and at 4:30 the whole objective, including Stuff
and Regina, was in the hands of the British and Canadians. It was a fine
victory, with 20 machine-guns and 1000 prisoners of the 5th Ersatz and
Twenty-eighth Bavarian Divisions as trophies. So rapid was the consolidation
that before morning trenches were opened out between the captured line and the
old British position. A curious incident in this most successful attack was
that the 8th Border Regiment advanced at least a thousand yards beyond its
objective, but was successful in getting back. By this brilliant little action
the enemy was finally driven down upon a three-mile front north of Thiepval and
Courcelette, until he had no foothold left save the marshes to the south of the
Ancre, where he cowered in enfiladed trenches for that final clearing up which
was only delayed by the weather. It should be added that on this same date,
October 21, the left of the British line, formed by the Thirty-ninth Division,
was attacked by storm-troops of the German Twenty-eighth Reserve Division,
armed with <i>Flammenwerfer</i> and supported by 60 light batteries. The attack
was formidable, and twice got into the British line, but was twice driven out
again, leaving many prisoners and trophies behind. The Sussex and Hampshire
troops of the 116th Brigade, aided by the 17th Rifles, stood Splendidly to
their work, and ended by holding every inch of their ground, and adding a new
German trench which was carried by the 14th Hants.</p>
<p>From this time onwards this northern section of the line was quiet save for
small readjustments, until the great effort upon November 13, which brought the
autumn campaign to a close with the considerable victory of Beaumont Hamel.
From the point which the Second Corps had now reached it could command with its
guns the Valley of the Ancre to the north of it, including some of those
positions which had repulsed our attack upon July 1 and were still in German
hands. So completely did we now outflank them from the south that it must have
been evident to any student of the map that Haig was sure, sooner or later, to
make a strong infantry advance over the ground which was so completely
controlled by his artillery. It was the German appreciation of this fact which
had caused their desperate efforts at successive lines of defence to hold us
back from gaining complete command of the crest of the slope. It will be told
in the final chapter of this volume how this command was utilised, and a bold
step was taken towards rolling up the German positions from the south&mdash;a
step which was so successful that it was in all probability the immediate cause
of that general retirement of the whole German front which was the first great
event in the campaign of 1917.</p>

BATTLE OF THE SOMME<br>
From September 15 to the Battle of the Ancre</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">Capture of Eaucourt&mdash;Varying character of German
resistance&mdash;Hard trench fighting along the line&mdash;Dreadful climatic
conditions&mdash;The meteorological trenches&mdash;Hazy Trench &mdash;Zenith
Trench&mdash;General observations&mdash;General von Arnim's report</p>
<p class="first">HAVING described the Battle of Flers, which began upon
September 15 and which extended over one, two, or three days according to the
completeness of the local victory, or the difficulty of reaching any definite
limit, we will now turn once more to the left of the line (always excepting
Gough's flanking army, which has been treated elsewhere), and we shall follow
the deeds of the successive divisions in each sector up to the end of the
operations. We will begin with the Third Corps, who abutted upon the Canadians
in the Martinpuich sector, and covered the line up to Drop Alley, north-east of
High Wood, where they joined up with the Fifteenth Corps.</p>
<p>The line on this western section was less active than on the right, where
the great villages of Combles, Lesboeufs, and Morval were obvious marks for the
advance. After the battle of September 15, the Twenty-third Division, relieving
the Fifteenth, took its station at the extreme left of the line, just north of
Martinpuich. To the right of the Twenty-third, occupying the Starfish and Prue
system of trenches,</p>
<p>On their right was the First, who had relieved the Forty-seventh Division,
the victors of High Wood, these three divisions, Twenty-third, Fiftieth, and
First, now formed the Third Corps. Their fighting patrols were thrown well out
during the days after the battle, and their front posts were as far north as
Crescent Alley and Hook Trench. The general attack of September 25, which
amounted to a considerable battle, did not seriously affect this portion of the
line. The only operation of note before the^end of the month was an attack upon
a farm in the front of their line by the 70th Brigade of the Twenty-third
Division&mdash;a brigade which had greatly distinguished itself during the time
it had fought with the Eighth Division upon July 1. This attack failed the
first time, but it was repeated with success at dawn upon September 29, and the
line moved forward to that limited extent. Another small advance was made by
the First Division on the night of September 25, east of Eaucourt, when a piece
of trench was carried by the gallantry of a platoon of the 2nd Rifles,
consisting almost entirely of Rhodesian volunteers, samples of those wandering
Britons who have played a part in this War which can never be chronicled. The
way in which the distant sons, prodigal or otherwise, came back to the help of
their hard-pressed mother is one of the most beautiful chapters in the history
of the Empire.</p>
<p>The Flers front-line trench bends away from the British position as it
trends towards the north-west, so that although it had been made good over a
large portion in the Battle of Flers, it was still intact opposite the Third
Corps. Upon October 1, however, it was attacked, and was taken without any
great difficulty, though the Fiftieth in the centre had to fight hard for their
section. The storming battalions, after re-forming, continued their advance,
and occupied the line between Le Sars and Flers. The village of Eaucourt lay in
their path, and was well guarded upon the west by uncut wire, but a tank rolled
its majestic path across it and the shouting infantry crowded close behind. The
141st Brigade of the Forty-seventh Division, which had come back once again
into the line, was the first to enter this village, which was the sixteenth
torn by the British from the grip of the invaders since the breaking of the
line, while the French captures stood at an even higher figure. There was a
strong counter-attack upon Eaucourt during the night, accompanied by a shortage
of bombs owing to the fact that the store had been destroyed by an unlucky
shell. The Germans for the time regained the village, and the ruins were partly
occupied by both armies until October 3, when the British line, once more
gathering volume and momentum, rolled over it for the last time. It had been
stoutly defended by men of a German reserve division, and its capture had cost
us dear. One of the mysteries of the fighting at this stage was the very varied
quality of the resistance, so that the advancing British were never sure
whether they would find themselves faced by demoralised poltroons, capable of
throwing up their hands by the hundred, or by splendid infantry, who would
fight to the death with the courage of despair.</p>
<p>Having won Eaucourt, the next village which, faced the British line in this
sector was Le Sars, immediately to the north-west. The advance upon this was
carried out amid rain and slush which made military operations almost
impossible. It was again found that the resistance was very spirited, but the
place was none the less carried and consolidated upon October 7.</p>
<p>In the week preceding the final assault there was hard fighting, during
which the 70th Brigade won its way forward into a favourable position for the
attack. The 8th York and Lancasters particularly distinguished themselves by
their gallantry in clearing by bombing the outlying German defences. Major
Sawyer and Lieutenant de Burgh of that battalion winning the Cross for their
fine leadership upon that occasion. The decisive attack was carried out by the
other two brigades of the Twenty-third Division, which advanced upon the
village, whilst the Forty-seventh Division made an attempt upon the formidable
Butte of Warlencourt. The latter venture met with no success, but the former
was brilliantly carried out. The advance was made by the 68th Brigade upon the
right and the 69th upon the left, the Martinpuich-Warlencourt road being the
dividing line between the two divisions. The attack was at 1:45 P.M., and in
broad daylight the battalions concerned, notably the 12th and 13th Durhams and
the 9th Yorks, clambered over their sodden sandbags and waded through the mud
which separated them from the Germans. The numbers were so reduced that the
companies formed only two weak platoons, but none the less they advanced very
steadily. Captain Blake, leading the first company of Durhams, was shot dead;
but another captain took over both companies and led them straight at the
village, both the 12th Durhams and 9th Yorks reaching the sunken road in front
of the houses at about the same moment. They worked their way down this and
bombed many Germans in their dug-outs. Here, as elsewhere, experience proved
that this system of taking refuge from shell-fire in deep burrows has very
serious military disadvantages, not merely on account of the difficulty of
getting out, but from the more serious objection that the men, being trained to
avoid danger, continued to shrink from it when it was essential that they
should rush out and face it. The yellow faces and flaccid appearance of our
prisoners showed also the physical results of a troglodytic life.</p>
<p>A single tank which had accompanied the advance was set on fire by a shell,
but the infantry pressed on undismayed, and well backed up by the 10th and 11th
Northumberland Fusiliers and 8th Seaforths, they soon seized the whole village
and firmly consolidated their position. The success was partly due to the fine
handling of machine-guns, which turned the favourite weapon of the Germans
against themselves. Five of these guns, 8 officers, and 450 men were taken
during the operation.</p>
<p>The Forty-seventh Division, meanwhile, in attempting to make similar
progress upon the right was held up by very heavy rifle and machine-gun fire.
Immediately afterwards, this division, much worn by its splendid service, was
taken out of the line, being replaced by the Ninth Scottish Division. Their
companion Division, the Fifteenth, had come back upon their left. The weather
now became so abominable and the mud so abysmal, that all prospect of farther
progress in this section had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The old prehistoric mark called the Butte of Warlencourt, which had long
stood up as a goal in front of the British trenches, proved really to be the
final mark of the advance until a new season should dawn.</p>
<p>Upon October 12 there was an attempt to get forward, but the conditions were
impossible, and the results unsatisfactory. In this affair the gallant Ninth
Division had considerable losses, their advance being conducted with the 26th
Brigade upon the right and the South Africans upon the left. Some small gain
was achieved by the former, but the latter were held up by a deadly machine-gun
fire. The Thirtieth Division was upon the right of the Ninth at this period,
and twice endeavoured to get forwards&mdash;once upon the 12th and once upon
the 18th; but neither of these attempts had good success, partly owing to the
very bad weather, and partly to the excellent resistance of the Sixth Bavarian
Reserve Division, which is described by those who have fought against it as one
of the very best divisions in the German army. On the 20th a fresh attack was
made by the 27th Brigade with no success and heavy losses to the 6th Scottish
Borderers. Early in November a renewed attempt was made by the Fiftieth
Division to advance in this quarter, but the country was a morass and no
progress was possible. The Canadians, Forty-eighth and Fiftieth Divisions, who
held the Le Sars front, were condemned to inactivity. From that time onwards
the line of the Third Corps was undisturbed, save for a strong counter-attack
upon November 6, which neutralised a small advance made upon the 5th. Le Sars
and Eaucourt were consolidated and continued to be the British advanced posts
in this quarter. The conditions of mud and discomfort can only be described as
appalling.</p>
<p>Having briefly traced the work of the Third Corps The from the action of
September 15 to the coming of the of the winter, we shall now turn to the
Fifteenth Corps upon the right and follow their operations from the same date.
It will be remembered that the New Zealanders formed the left-hand division,
and that they had advanced so finely that by the evening of September 16 they
were up to, but not in, Goose Alley and Factory Corner, from which the) were
within striking distance of the Gird System.</p>
<p>Before attacking this, however, it was necessary to get a firmer hold of
Flers Trench, which in its western reaches was still in the hands of the
Germans. It was a desperate business of bombing from traverse to traverse and
overcoming successive barricades upon a very narrow front where a few
determined men could hold up a company. This difficult business was taken in
hand at 8:30 on the night of September 21 by the 2nd Canterbury Battalion, who
advanced down the trench. It was a Homeric conflict, which lasted for the whole
night, where men stood up to each other at close quarters, clearing away the
dead and dying in order to make room for fresh combatants in the front line.
Down Flers Trench and Drop Alley raged the long struggle, with crash and flare
of bombs, snarl of machine-guns, shrill whistles from rallying officers, and
shouts from the furious men. The New Zealand Black Watch had gained a portion
of the trench, but the German reinforcements streamed down a communication
trench which opened behind them, and found themselves between the two bodies of
New Zealanders. It was a great fight, but by morning it had been definitely
decided in favour of the men from oversea. The long section of Flers Trench was
cleared and part of Goose Alley, opening out of it, was held. No less than 350
German dead were picked up, and a handful of prisoners were left with the
victors. The New Zealand losses were about 150 of all ranks.</p>
<p>On September 25 the New Zealanders tightened their grip upon Goose Alley,
which connects up the Flers and the Gird Systems of trenches. In the meantime
the divisions upon their right were moving to the north-east of Flers towards
the village of Guedecourt, which lay upon the farther side of the Gird
Trenches. The actual attack upon the village was committed to the Twenty-first
Division, who advanced on a two-brigade front, the 110th Leicester Brigade
making straight for the village itself, while the 64th Brigade upon its right,
strengthened by the inclusion of the 1st Lincolns, was ordered to occupy 1000
yards of front to the right. The two brigades were not equally fortunate. The
Leicester brigade, by a fine advance, pierced the Gird Trench, and made their
way beyond it. The 64th Brigade was held up by uncut wire, which they could not
penetrate. The result was that the Leicesters, being heavily counter-attacked,
and having their flanks open, were forced back as far as the Gird Trench, to
which they clung. The position in the evening was a curious one, for we held
the Gird Trench at two different points, but between them lay a stretch of 1000
yards still occupied by the Germans and faced with uncut wire. Orders reached
the Divisional General during the night that at all costs the position must be
carried. By a happy inspiration he sent for a tank from Flers, and ordered the
Leicesters to bomb down Gird Trench in co-operation with the tank, which
crawled along parapet. A strong point had been erected at the far end of the
trench, and the Germans as they rushed away from the danger ran into a deadly
machine-gun fire. The upshot was that a great number were killed, while 8
officers and 362 men were taken, with a loss to the attackers of 5 wounded. To
add to the quaintness of the operation, an aeroplane flew low over the trench
during its progress, helping with its bombs to make the victory complete. The
result was far more than the capture of the trench, for the 64th Brigade, led
by the Durhams, at once swept forward and captured their objective, while the
110th Brigade upon the left reached Guedecourt under happier auspices and
remained in possession of the village.</p>
<p>Although the Gird line had been pierced at this point, it was held in its
western length, and this was attacked upon September 27 by the New Zealanders
and the Fifty-fifth Lancashire Territorial Division, both of which gained their
objectives, so that the whole end of this great trench system from a point
north of Flers passed definitely into the British possession.</p>
<p>On October 1 there was a fresh general advance which led to no great change
in this part of the line, save that both the New Zealanders and the
Twenty-first Division improved their position, the latter getting as far as
Bayonet Trench. Shortly afterwards the New Zealanders were drawn out, having
been 23 consecutive days in the line, and earned themselves a great reputation.
"The division has won universal confidence and admiration," said Sir Douglas
Haig. "No praise can be too high for such troops."</p>
<p>We now turn to the Fourteenth Corps, which filled the remainder of the
British line up to the point of its junction with the French. During the battle
the division of Guards had, as will be remembered, held the left of this line,
but on the day after it was replaced for a short time by the Twentieth
Division, whose 61st Brigade, especially the 7th Cornwalls and 12th King's,
were heavily engaged. The 60th Brigade had pushed up into the fighting line,
and received a strong German counter-attack in the morning of the 17th, which
broke down before the rifles of the 6th Shropshire Light Infantry. In the
afternoon the 59th Brigade advanced upon the left and the 60th upon the right,
closing in upon the Morval position. The 12th King's Royal Rifles of the latter
brigade was held up by a strong point and lost heavily, but the general effect
was to bring the British line nearer to the doomed village. Twice upon the
18th, German counter-attacks swarmed down upon the exposed right flank of the
60th Brigade, but each time they were blown back by the fire of the 12th Rifle
Brigade and the 12th Rifles. The 59th Brigade had made no progress, the two
Rifle Brigade battalions (10th and 11th) having particularly heavy losses upon
the 17th, but they were holding their line strongly. It was impossible to do
more for the moment, for the Sixth Division upon their right was still hung up,
as already described, by the Quadrilateral. Shortly after that obstacle had
been overcome, the Guards took over once more from the Twentieth, and were
ready in conjunction with the Sixth and Fifth Divisions for a serious advance
upon Morval and Lesboeufs.</p>
<p>On September 22 the 3rd Guards Brigade was in touch with the Twenty-first
Division upon the left, which was now holding Gird Trench and Gird Support as
far north as Watling Street. On this day the 4th Grenadiers, reverting after
centuries to the weapon which their name implies, were bombing their way up Gas
Alley, which leads towards Lesboeufs. On the 23rd the Twenty-first on the left,
the Guards in the centre, and the Sixth Division were advancing and steadily
gaining ground to the north-east, capturing Needle Trench, which is an
off-shoot from the Gird System. On the 24th the Germans counter-attacked upon
the 16th Brigade, the blow falling upon the 1st Buffs, who lost four bays of
their trench for a short period, but speedily drove the intruders out once
more. The 14th Durham Light Infantry also drove off an attack. The Fifth
Division was now coming up on the right of the Sixth, and played a considerable
part in the decisive attack upon September 25.</p>
<p>On this date an advance of the four divisions on this section of the line
carried all before it, the Twenty-first being north of Delville Wood, the 3rd
Brigade of the Guards operating on the German trenches between Guedecourt and
Lesboeufs, the 1st Brigade of Guards upon the left of the village of Lesboeufs,
the Sixth Division upon the right of Lesboeufs, and the Fifth Division on
Morval.</p>
<p>In this attack the 4th Grenadiers upon the extreme left of the Guards were
badly punished, for the Twenty-first upon their left had been held up, but the
rest came along well, the 1st Welsh forming a defensive flank upon the left
while the other battalions reached their full objective and dug in, unmolested
save by our own barrage. The 1st Irish and 3rd Coldstream, who were on the left
of the 1st Brigade, also got through without heavy loss and occupied the
trenches to the immediate north and north-east of Lesboeufs.</p>
<p>The 2nd Grenadiers, who led the right of the Brigade, with their supporting
battalion the 2nd Coldstream, headed straight for the village, and were held up
for a time by uncut wire, but the general attack upon the right was progressing
at a rate which soon took the pressure off them.</p>
<p>The British infantry were swarming round Lesboeufs in the early afternoon,
and about 3:15 the 1st West Yorks of the 18th Brigade penetrated into it,
establishing touch with the Guards upon their left. They were closely followed
by their old battle companions, the 2nd Durham Light Infantry. The German
resistance was weaker than usual, and the casualties were not severe. On the
Morval front the 15th Brigade of the Fifth Division, with the 95th Brigade upon
their right, were making a steady and irresistible advance upon Morval. The 1st
Norfolks and 1st Cheshires were in the front, and the latter battalion was the
first to break into the village with the 1st Bedfords, 2nd Scots Borderers, and
16th Royal Welsh Fusiliers in close support. The 1st Cheshires particularly
distinguished itself; and it was in this action that Private Jones performed
his almost incredible feat of capturing single-handed and bringing in four
officers and 102 men of the 146th W&uuml;rtemberg Regiment, including four
wearers of the famous Iron Cross. The details of this extraordinary affair,
where one determined and heavily-armed man terrorised a large company taken at
a disadvantage, read more like the romantic exploit of some Western desperado
who cries "Hands up!" to a drove of tourists, than any operation of war. Jones
was awarded the V.C, and it can have been seldom won in such sensational
fashion.</p>
<p>Whilst the 15th Brigade of the Fifth Division attacked the village of Morval
the 95th Brigade of the same division carried the German trenches to the west
of it. This dashing piece of work was accomplished by the 1st Devons and the
1st East Surreys. When they had reached their objective, the 12th Gloucesters
were sent through them to occupy and consolidate the south side of the village.
This they carried out with a loss of 80 men. In the evening a company of the
6th Argylls, together with the 2nd Home Company Royal Engineers, pushed on past
the village and made a strong point against the expected counter-attack; while
the 15th Brigade extended and got into touch with the 2nd York and Lancasters
of the Sixth Division upon their left. It was a great day of complete victory
with no regrets to cloud it, for the prisoners were many, the casualties were
comparatively few, and two more village sites were included by one forward
spring within the British area. The Town Major of Morval stood by his charge to
the last and formed one of the trophies. On the 26th the Germans came back upon
the Guards at about one o'clock, but their effort was a fiasco, for the
advancing lines came under the concentrated fire of six batteries of the 7th
Divisional Artillery. Seldom have Germans stampeded more thoroughly. "Hundreds
of the enemy can be seen retiring in disorder over the whole front. They are
rushing towards Beaulencourt in the wildest disorder." Such was the report from
a forward observer. At the same time a tank cleared the obstacles in front of
the Twenty-first Division and the whole line was straight again. The British
consolidated their positions firmly, for it was already evident that they were
likely to be permanent ones. The Guards and Fifth Division were taken out of
the line shortly afterwards, the Twentieth Division coming in once more upon
September 26, while upon September 27 the French took over part of the line,
pushing the Twentieth Division to the left, where they took over the ground
formerly held by the Twenty-first. Upon October 1 the 61st Brigade was ordered
to push forward advanced posts and occupy a line preparatory to future
operations. This was well carried out and proved of great importance when a
week later attacks were made upon Cloudy and Rainbow Trenches.</p>
<p>Leaving this victorious section of the line for the moment, we must turn our
attention to the hardworked and splendid Fifty-sixth Division upon their right,
whose operations were really more connected with those of the French on their
right than with their comrades of the Fourteenth Corps upon the left. By a
happy chance it was the French division of the same number with which they were
associated during much of the time. It will be remembered that at the close of
the Flers action (September 15 and on), the Fifty-sixth Division was holding a
defensive flank to the south, in the region of Bouleaux Wood, part of which was
still held by the Germans. They were also closing in to the southwards, so as
to co-operate with the French, who were approaching Combles from the other
side. On September 25, while the Fifth were advancing upon Morval, the
Fifty-sixth played an important part, for the 168th, their left brigade,
carried the remainder of Bouleaux Wood, and so screened the flank of the Fifth
Division. One hundred men and four machine-guns were captured in this movement.
On the 26th, as the woods were at last clear, the division turned all its
attention to Combles, and at 3:15 in the afternoon of that day fighting patrols
of the 169th Brigade met patrols of the French in the central square of the
town. The Germans had cleverly evacuated it, and the booty was far less than
had been hoped for, but none the less its capture was of great importance, for
it was the largest place that had yet been wrenched out of the iron grasp of
Germany. After the fall of Combles the French, as already stated, threw out
their left wing upon that side so as to take over the ground which had been
covered by the Fifty-sixth Division, and afterwards by the Fifth Division.</p>
<p>On September 30 the Fifty-sixth Division took over from the Guards, and
again found itself upon the right of the British line, and in touch w4th the
new dispositions of the French. On its left was the Twentieth Division, and on
their left the Sixth. These three divisions now found themselves opposite to a
long line of trenches, to which various meteorological names had been given,
though the actual meteorological conditions at the time formed a greater
obstacle than the defences in front of them. A simple diagram will show more
clearly than any words how these formidable trenches lay with regard to the
British advance.</p>

<br>
<p>It may well seem to the reader that the defenders are bound to have the best
of the argument when they can thus exchange one line for another, and as
quickly as they are beaten out of one set of strongholds confront their enemy
with another one. No doubt so long as the lines are stoutly held this is true
as regards the rate of advance. But as far as it concerns the losses which mark
that vital attrition which was wearing Germany to the bone it was very
different, These trenches were not like the old permanent fortifications where
German officers in a 30-foot dug-out could smile over the caricatures in
<i>Ulk</i> and smoke an indolent cigarette, while the impotent British shells
pitted the earth-surface far above them. There was no such shelter in these
hastily-constructed burrows, while the guns which raked and pounded them grew
stronger and more numerous from day to day. Let the machine-gun do its worst,
the heavy gun is still the master of the field, for the machine-gun can only
levy its toll when circumstances favour it, while day or night the heavy gun is
a constant dread. We have had to mourn the swathes of our dead in the open, but
the Germans lay as thick amid the clay and chalk of the Picardy ditches. With
fine manhood they clung to them and beat back our infantry where they could,
but the tales of deserters, the letters found on the wounded, and the condition
of the trenches when taken, all told the same story of terrible loss.</p>
<p>On October 7 there was an infantry attack upon this trench system in which
the Forty-first, Twelfth, Twentieth, and Fifty-sixth Divisions, together with
the French, all took part in the order named from the left. The weather was
most execrable, and its vileness told entirely against the Allies, since it was
they who had to move, and since the superior gun-power needed for a modern
attack was largely neutralised by the difficulty in using aircraft observation.
The attack was at 1:45 P.M., when the troops advanced under a heavy barrage
along the whole sodden and slippery front. The results were unequal, though the
infantry behaved everywhere with their wonted valour and perseverance.</p>
<p>The 122nd Brigade upon the extreme left of the attack could only get on
about a hundred yards, so heavy was the fire; while the 124th to the right of
them could do little better, and eventually dug in at a point 200 yards short
of the Bayonet Trench, which was their immediate objective. Seventy officers
and nearly 1300 men fell during this attack of the Forty-first Division, which
was handicapped in many ways, for the men were weary, it was too cloudy for
reconnaissance, the battalions were already depleted, and the enemy was fresh
and unshaken. The success of the Twelfth Division upon the right of the
Forty-first was little better. The 36th and 37th Brigades endured heavy losses,
especially in the case of the two Royal Fusilier battalions and of the 6th
Buffs, whose colonel greatly distinguished himself. In spite of every effort
and considerable loss there were no permanent gains of importance at this
point.</p>
<p>Things went better, however, with the Twentieth Division upon the right. The
two brigades in the front line were the 61st upon the left and the 60th on the
right. The leading battalions, counting from the left, were the 7th Yorks Light
Infantry, 12th King's Liverpool, 6th Oxford and Bucks, and 12th Rifle Brigade.
The troops had to endure a considerable shelling before leaving their trenches,
but it seemed only to add additional fire to their advance, which swept over
the low ridge in front of them, and took a long stretch of Rainbow Trench. The
right attack was slower than the left, as it ran into a dip of the ground in
which the Germans had some cleverly-sited wire entanglement, unseen and
untouched by our guns. Nothing daunted, the Oxford and Bucks proceeded to cut
lanes through the wire under heavy fire, and one officer of the battalion had
actually succeeded in crawling under it when he was shot at point-blank range
from the German trench. The front line had now done its work and rested in
Rainbow, while the second line &mdash; consisting, from the left, of the 7th
Somersets, 7th Cornwalls, 6th Shropshires, and 12th Rifles&mdash;swept onwards
in splendid form, capturing both Cloudy and Misty Trenches. There the
victorious infantry dug themselves in on the forward slope of the ridge. The
brigades were ahead of their comrades, with the result that their flanks were
exposed, they suffered from enfilade fire, and it was necessary to form
defensive flanks. Two counter attacks were made during the day, but both were
beaten of!. The prisoners captured in this fine advance were 5 officers and 187
men, with 5 machine guns and 2 trench-mortars. By the morning of the 8th strong
points had been made and the whole line was defiant of recapture.</p>
<p>The Fifty-sixth Division had advanced with equal valour upon the right and
had made good progress, though its gains had not been so substantial as those
of the Twentieth. The 167th Brigade had attacked upon the left and the 168th
upon the right. They ended with the 7th Middlesex, their flank battalion upon
the left in touch with the Twentieth . Division in Rainbow, while the London
Scots on the extreme right were in touch with the French in Hazy Trench. The
fighting was bitter, however, the men wearied, and the conditions abominable.
All the battalions lost heavily, the 4th London being the chief sufferer, for
it was on the left flank of the 168th Brigade and was held up by a particularly
murderous machine-gun. In the evening a strong German counter-attack, rushing
in upon Hazy Trench behind a thick shower of bombs, drove back both the 168th
Brigade and the French to their own original line. For the time the advance had
failed upon the right.</p>
<p>The 167th Brigade had held on to Rainbow and were now bombing their way down
Spectrum. They held their ground there during the night, and on October 8 were
still advancing, though the 3rd London coming up to reinforce ran into a heavy
barrage and were sadly cut up. The British barrage was found to be practically
useless because the guns had been brought up too near. The 169th Brigade had
come up on the right and was hotly engaged, the London Rifle Brigade getting up
close to Hazy and digging in parallel to it, with their left in touch with the
Victorias. The Germans, however, were still holding Hazy, nor could it be said
in the evening that the British were holding either of the more advanced
trenches, Dewdrop or Rainy. In the evening the London Rifle Brigade were forced
to leave their new trench because it was enfiladed from Hazy, and to make their
way back to their old departure trenches as best they could, dragging with them
a captured machine-gun as a souvenir of a long and bloody day's work. On
October 9 the British held none of the points in dispute in this section on the
right, save only a portion of Spectrum. There was a pause in this long and
desperate fight which was conducted by tired infantry fighting in front of
tired guns, and which left the survivors of both sides plastered with mud from
head to heel. When it was resumed, the two British divisions, the Twentieth and
Fifty-sixth, which had done such long service in the line, and were greatly
reduced, had been withdrawn. The Fourth Division had taken the place of the
Londoners, while the Sixth, itself very worn, had relieved the Twentieth.</p>
<p>On October 12 both these divisions delivered an attack together with the
French and with the Fifteenth Corps upon their left. The 14th Durham Light
Infantry were in Rainbow on the left and were in touch with the 1st West Yorks
of the 18th Brigade upon their right, but could find no one upon their left,
while the German pressure was very strong. The 18th Brigade worked along
Rainbow, therefore, until it got into touch with the Twelfth Division upon
their left. The Twelfth Division had been lent the 88th Brigade of the
Twenty-ninth Division, and this gallant body, so terribly cut up on July 1, had
an instalment of revenge. They won their objective, and it is pleasant to add
that the Newfoundlanders especially distinguished themselves. The 16th Brigade
upon the right attacked Zenith Trench, the 2nd York and Lancaster leading the
rush. The position could not be held, however, by battalions which were
depleted by weeks of constant strain and loss. A report from a company officer
says: "The few unwounded sheltered in trench holes and returned in the dusk.
The fire was too strong to allow them to dig in. The Brigade line is therefore
the same as before the attack."</p>
<p>Whilst the Sixth Division had been making this difficult and fruitless
attack the Fourth Division upon their right had been equally heavily engaged in
this horrible maze of mud-sodden trenches, without obtaining any more
favourable result. The 12th Brigade fought on the immediate right of the 16th,
some of them reaching Spectrum, and some of them Zenith. The 2nd West Ridings
and 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers were the heaviest sufferers, the latter holding a
line of shell-holes in front of Spectrum where they were exposed to a terrible
barrage. The 10th Brigade were on their right, and one battalion, the 1st
Warwick, reached Foggy, but was unable to hold it under the crushing fire. By
the evening of October 13, however, the whole of Spectrum had at last been
seized, and the enemy, who attempted to bomb along it from Dewdrop, were
repulsed. On October 18, the 88th Brigade again had a success, the 2nd Hants
and 4th Worcesters doing particularly well. For a time the fighting died down,
the British licking their wounds and sharpening their claws for a fresh grapple
with these redoubtable trenches.</p>
<p>This came upon October 23, when there was an advance at 2:45 in the
afternoon by the Fourth Division upon the right and the Eighth Division upon
the left. The three-brigade front covered by the Eighth Division is indicated
by the fact that the 2nd East Lancashires, the left battalion of the left
brigade (24th), was directed upon the junction between Mild and Cloudy, while
the right brigade (23rd) had Zenith for its objective. The first attack of the
left brigade failed, but the second brought them into Cloudy. By 4:15 the 2nd
Scots Rifles of the 23rd Brigade had penetrated the right of Zenith, and some
small parties had even moved on to Orion beyond. The central brigade (25th) had
won its way up to Misty, the 2nd Lincolns, 2nd Berks, and 2nd Rifle Brigade in
the lead. In the meantime the East Lancashires on the left were endeavouring to
bomb their way down the maze of trenches, filled with yard-deep mud, which
separated them from their comrades. The fighting was desperate, however, and
the losses considerable. The 2nd Lin coins had got detached in the labyrinth,
and were out of touch with their companions. At 6:45 the Germans came again in
strength and those of the Scots Rifles who had gained Orion were driven back.
The casualties in this splendid battalion, which had suffered so often and so
much, were once again very severe.</p>
<p>The Fourth Division had also had a hard fight upon the right and had made no
great progress. The French upon their right had been held up after an initial
advance. The 12th Brigade attacked Dewdrop, but were unable to hold it. The
11th had seized Hazy, but their grip of it was still precarious. Every position
was raked with machine-guns and clogged with the all-pervading and often
impassable morass. In mud and blood and driving rain, amid dirt and death,
through day and night, the long death-grapple never ceased until exhaustion and
winter brought a short surcease.</p>
<p>Upon the 24th the hard-earned gains in these trenches were consolidated. In
the sector of the Eighth Division they were substantial and justified the hope
that this obdurate line would go the way of all the others which had barred the
army. Had it been earlier in the season it would have been easy to wait for
clear weather, beat them into pulp with heavy guns, and then under a good
barrage capture them by assault. But this could not be done, for Sir Douglas
Haig could not afford to wait, with winter coming on and only a few weeks or
days left in which to bring his men forward to their final line. The general
position upon October 24 was that the 2nd Middlesex of the 24th Brigade held
Zenith in part, that the 25th Brigade was in Gusty and held part of Misty,
while the 23rd Brigade had made no advance upon the right but their left was in
Cloudy and Mild.</p>
<p>Upon this date the Thirty-third Division came up to relieve the Fourth, and
upon September 28 it made a brilliant advance which altered the whole situation
in this section. At 7 A.M. on that date the 4th King's Liverpool of the 98th
Brigade by a sudden dash carried the whole of Dewdrop, taking 100 prisoners.
The 19th Brigade upon the right kept up with the advance, and before evening
Frosty, Gunpits, and Dewdrop had all been included in the British line. There
was a pause after this advance, and then upon November 5 there was another
advance of the Thirty-third, together with the French. Again there was a good
gain, which was effected by the 100th Brigade on the right, and the 19th upon
the left. Mirage, Boritzka, and Hazy were all reported as being at last in our
hands. The 5th Scottish Rifles, 16th King's Royal Rifles, and 20th Fusiliers
all distinguished themselves, and all &mdash;especially the
last-named&mdash;met with considerable losses in this attack. The Seventeenth
Division, which had for a few days taken the place of the Eighth, joined in
this advance and extended the ground upon their front, the fighting falling
chiefly to the 50th Brigade, in which the 7th York and 7th East York were the
principal sufferers. Great work was also done by the 51st Brigade, the 7th
Borders and the 7th Lincolns particularly distinguishing themselves. These
battalions not only cleared up Zenith Trench, but upon the Germans countering
they reserved their fire until the stormers were within 40 yards of them, and
then mowed down several hundreds of them, "The men marched back seven miles
last night," wrote one of the officers, "after fighting for forty-eight hours
without sleep, singing at the tops of their voices all the way. Priceless
fellows!"</p>
<p>On November 7 the Eighth Division was at work again, taking 1100 yards of
front, 5 machine-guns, and 80 prisoners. The season was now far advanced and
prematurely wet and cold, so that winter lines were formed by the British in
this quarter with the village of Le Transloy in their immediate front. Over the
rest of the line facing north there had been no serious attempt at advance
during this period, and the only fighting to be recorded was on the part of the
Anzac Corps, who came in at the end of October, and took over the whole front
of the Fifteenth Corps in the centre of the line. These troops joined the
attack already recorded upon November 5, and captured that portion of Gird
Support Trench which was not yet in our possession. For a time they held
Bayonet Trench, but were driven out by a strong bombing attack by the 5th
Regiment of the Fourth Prussian Guards Division. The Australians and the 50th
Brigade worked in close co-operation during these hard days, and it is pleasing
to find the high opinion which they entertained of each other, "On several
occasions," says an Australian, "we had to rely on Yorkshire grit to support
our division at critical moments, and the Tikes never failed us once. We owe a
big debt to the East Yorkshires in particular. We found them the most loyal of
comrades." This sentiment was heartily reciprocated by the Imperial troops.</p>
<p>The fighting now died down in this quarter and the winter lull had set in,
leaving the front British trenches some hundreds of yards from Le Transloy and
the Bapaume road. It would be an ungenerous of the Briton who would not admit
that in holding us off from it so long, even if we make every allowance for the
weather and its disastrous consequences to the attack, the Germans performed a
fine feat of arms. It was done by fresh units which had not suffered from the
gruelling which their comrades had received upon the Somme, and which would no
doubt have been worn down in time, as the others had been, but they fought with
great tenacity and certainly prevented our winter line from being as far
forward as we had hoped.</p>
<p>Whilst giving the German army every credit for its tenacious resistance and
for the hard digging by which it constructed so many lines of defence that five
months of hard fighting and a dozen separate victories had been unable to carry
the attackers through them, we must still insist upon the stupendous
achievement of the British. Nearly every division had passed through the fiery
ordeal of the Somme, many of them twice and thrice, and each had retired with
fresh honour and new records of victory. Apart from great days of battle like
July 1, July 14, September 15, and September 26, when many miles of German
trench were carried with a corresponding number of prisoners and guns, there
was a separate epic round each village and wood, so that the names of many of
them will find immortality in military history. High Wood, Trones Wood, Mametz
Wood, and Deville Wood each represents a very terrible local battle. So, too,
do such village names as Ovillers, Contalmaison, Pozi&egrave;res, Thiepval,
Longueval, Ginchy, and especially Guillemont. Every one of these stern contests
ended with the British infantry in its objective, and in no single case were
they ever driven out again.</p>
<p>So much for the tactical results of the actions. As to the strategic effect,
that was only clearly seen when the threat of renewed operations in the spring
caused the German army to abandon all the positions which the Somme advance had
made untenable, and to fall back upon a new line many miles to the rear. The
Battle of the Marne was the turning-point of the first great German levy, the
Battle of the Somme that of the second. In each case the retirement was only
partial, but each clearly marked a fresh step in the struggle, upward for the
Allies, downward for the Central Powers.</p>
<p>In the credit for this result the first place must be given to the
efficiency of British leadership, which was admirable in its perseverance and
in its general conception, but had, it must be admitted, not yet attained that
skill in the avoidance of losses which was gradually taught by our terrible
experiences and made possible by our growing strength in artillery. The severe
preliminary bombardment controlled by the direct observation which is only
possible after air supremacy has been attained, the counter-battery work to
reduce the enemy's fire, the creeping barrage to cover the infantry, the
discipline and courage which enable infantry to advance with shrapnel upon
their very toes, the use of smoke clouds against flank fire, the swift advance
of the barrage when a trench has fallen so as to head off fugitives and stifle
the counterattack, all these devices were constantly improving with practice,
until in the arts of attack the British Army stood ahead even of their comrades
of France. An intercepted communication in the shape of a report from General
von Arnim, commanding the Fourth German Army, giving his experience of the
prolonged battle, speaks of British military efficiency in every arm in a
manner which must have surprised the General Staff if they were really of
opinion that General Haig's army was capable of defence but not of attack. This
report, with its account of the dash and tenacity of the British infantry and
of the efficiency of its munitions, is as handsome a testimonial as one
adversary ever paid to another, and might be called magnanimous were it not
that it was meant for no eye save that of his superiors.</p>
<p>But all our leadership would have been vain had it not been supported by the
high efficiency of every branch of the services, and by the general excellence
of the materiel. As to the actual value of the troops, it can only be said with
the most absolute truth that the infantry, artillery, and sappers all lived up
to the highest traditions of the Old Army, and that the Flying Corps set up a
fresh record of tradition, which their successors may emulate but can never
surpass. The materiel was, perhaps, the greatest surprise both to friend and
foe. We are accustomed in British history to find the soldier retrieving by his
stubborn valour the difficulties caused by the sluggish methods of those who
should supply his needs. Thanks to the labours of the Ministry of Munitions, of
Sir William Robertson, and of countless devoted workers of both sexes, toiling
with brain and with hand, this was no longer so. That great German army which
two years before held every possible advantage that its prolonged preparation
and busy factories could give it, had now, as General von Arnim's report
admits, fallen into the inferior place. It was a magnificent achievement upon
which the British nation may well pride itself, if one may ever pride oneself
on anything in a drama so mighty that human powers seem but the instruments of
the huge contending spiritual forces behind them. The fact remains that after
two years of national effort the British artillery was undoubtedly superior to
that of the Germans, the British Stokes trench-mortars and light Lewis
machine-guns were the best in Europe, the British aeroplanes were unsurpassed,
the British Mills bomb was superior to any other, and the British tanks were an
entirely new departure in the art of War. It was the British brain as well as
the British heart and arm which was fashioning the future history of
mankind.</p>

BATTLE OF THE ANCRE<br>
November 13, 1916</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">The last effort&mdash;Failure in the north&mdash;Fine work
of the Thirty-ninth, Fifty-first, and Sixty-third Divisions &mdash; Surrounding
of German Fort&mdash;Capture of Beaumont Hamel &mdash; Commander
Freyberg&mdash;Last operations of the season&mdash;General survey&mdash;"The
unwarlike Islanders"</p>
<p class="first">THIS considerable British victory may well have a name of its
own, though it was merely an extension of gigantic effort upon the Somme. The
fact, however, that it was fought upon the banks of a small subsidiary stream,
and also that it was separated by a month or more from any other serious
engagement, give it a place of its own in the narrative of the War. It has
already been shown at the conclusion of the chapter which deals with the flank
operations by the Fifth Army, commanded by Sir Hubert Gough, that the British
position after the capture of the Schwaben and other redoubts which defended
the high ground to the north of Thiepval was such that the guns were able to
take the German front line to the north of the Ancre in enfilade and almost in
rear. Under such circumstances it might well seem that their trenches were
untenable, but their position, although difficult, was alleviated by the fact
that they had been able partly to find and partly to make a series of
excavations in the chalk and clay soil of the district which of the gave them
almost complete protection against the heaviest shell-fire. Whole battalions
led a troglodytic life in subterranean caverns from which they were trained to
rush forth upon the alarm of an infantry advance. It was clear, however, that
if the alarm should be too short their refuges might very easily become traps,
as has so often been the case in the German lines of defence. The safety from
shells is dearly paid for when a squad of furious stormers with Mills bombs in
their hands and death in their faces glare in from the door. Their minds were
kept easy, however, by the knowledge that broad fields of barbed wire, so rusty
and so thick that they resembled ploughland from a distance, lay between them
and the British. A very large garrison drawn from seven divisions, one of them
being the 2nd Guards Reserve, held this dangerous salient in the German
line.</p>
<p>For the attack General Gough had mustered two Army Corps of six divisions,
three of which, forming the Second Corps, were to advance from the south under
General Jacob, having the almost impassable mud slopes of the Ancre in front of
them. Three others of the Fifth Corps, under General E. A. Fanshawe, were to
storm the German line north of the Ancre. This latter movement was to be
directed not only from the new British positions, but also from the old lines
as far north as Serre. The advance from the west divided the enemy's gun-power,
and distracted his attention from the south, so that its failure and the loss
which that failure involved, were part of the price paid for the victory.</p>
<p>After a two days' bombardment, which started on November 11, and which
uprooted the greater part of the German wire, the actual attack was made at six
in the foggy, misty morning of November 13. It is inconceivable that the
Germans were not standing to arms, since dawn had long been the hour of doom,
and the furious drum-fire was certainly the overture to a battle. The thick
weather, however, shrouded the British movements, and the actual rush of the
infantry seems at the end to have been a surprise. Both in the western and
southern advance, which covered respectively 5000 and 3000 yards, every
refinement of artillery barrage which years of experience could suggest was
used to form such a downpour as would protect the assailants, and beat the
German riflemen and gunners back into their burrows.</p>
<p>Of the three divisions which attacked the old German line from the west, the
most northern was the Thirty-first, with as objective the second and third
German line, and to form a defensive flank between Gommecourt and Serre. This
division, which contained some splendid North-country battalions from great
Yorkshire towns, advanced with great intrepidity. So skilful was the barrage
arranged that the 12th East Yorkshires on the left and 13th East Yorkshires on
the right (10th and 11th East Yorkshires in reserve), belonging to the 92nd
Brigade, had little difficulty in reaching the German front line, which was
quickly mopped up. The going between the first and second line was so heavy,
and the German snipers so numerous, that the barrage got ahead of the advancing
waves, but after a sharp rifle fight the second line was captured, which was
the final objective of the left (12th East Yorkshires) battalion. The 13th East
Yorkshires, whose final objective was the third German line, had a very severe
fight before reaching that position. Owing to the failure of the division on
the right of the 13th East Yorkshires to get forward, the Germans later on put
in several heavy bombing counter-attacks against their right flank, which
eventually drove them back to the second line, where they took up their
position alongside the 12th, and for the remainder of the day repulsed numerous
counter-attacks. As soon as the 12th East Yorkshires on the left had reached
their objectives they consolidated it, and with the aid of the 93rd Brigade, to
whom was attached the Machine-Gun Sections of the Lucknow and Sialkote Cavalry
Brigades, beat off a very strong counter-attack which developed about 9:30
A.M., practically wiping it out and several minor ones during the day.</p>
<p>At 2:30 P.M. the German bombardment against the 92nd became very intense,
and was kept up till 5:30 P.M., in spite of which the 12th and 13th East
Yorkshires stuck to their gains. It was only at 9 P.M. when the Divisional
General saw that there was no prospect of the division on the right advancing
that the 12th and 13th were ordered to fall back to their original line.</p>
<p>The experience of the Third Division upon the right or south of the
Thirty-first was a very trying one. There is a strip of Picardy between those
lines from Serre to the Ancre, where more Britons have given their lives for
their country and for the cause of humanity than in any area in this or any
other war. Twice it has been the scene of tragic losses, on July 1, and vet
again on November 13, though, as already said, it is well in each case to
regard the general result rather than the local tragedy.</p>
<p>Once again the Third Division gave itself freely and unselfishly for the
common cause. In this case, also, the cause of the scanty results lay in the
heavy ground and the uncut wire. In the case of the 76th Brigade, which may be
taken as typical of its neighbours, it advanced to the immediate south of the
93rd, and experienced even more difficult conditions. The 2nd Suffolks and the
10th Welsh Fusiliers were in the van, but the 8th Royal Lancasters and 1st
Gordons came up in support, the whole thick line of men clustering in front of
the wire and endeavouring to hack a way. Sergeants and officers were seen in
front of the obstacle endeavouring to find some way through. Here and there a
few pushful men, both from the 76th Brigade and from the 9th upon its right,
did succeed in passing, but none of these ever returned. Finally, a retreat was
ordered through a pelting barrage, and even in their own front-line trenches
the troops were exposed to a furious shell-fall. It was an unfortunate business
and the losses were heavy.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the right of the Third Division was the Second Division,
which attacked with the 5th and 6th Brigades in the van, the latter being on
the immediate flank of the Third Division, and sharing in the obstacles which
faced that division and the check which resulted from them. The immediate
objective was the great Munich Trench lurking within its far-flung spider-web
of wire. Although all of the 6th Brigade save the right-hand battalion were
brought to a stand, and wound up in their own trenches, the 5th Brigade got
well forward and might have got farther had it not meant the exposure of their
left flank. In the evening the 99th Brigade, the victors of Delville Wood, were
brought up with orders to form a defensive flank to the north, while they
furnished two battalions for a farther advance to continue the success gained
by the 5th Brigade. In the early morning of November 14 these two units, the
1st Rifles and 1st Berkshires, advanced in a proper November fog, which caused
some misdirection, and eventually the failure of the attack, for two smaller
trenches were carried under the impression that each was the Munich. Some
ground and prisoners were, however, gained, but not the main objective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to return to the narrative of the previous day, a very different
tale was to be told of those divisions which were operating farther to the
south, where the ridge between Serre and Beaumont Hamel sheltered the attack
from the formidable German gun-power at Pusieux and Bucquoy in the north.</p>
<p>Of the three divisions attacking from the south the Thirty-ninth was to the
south of the Ancre, the Sixty-Third Naval Division upon its left on the north
bank of the Ancre, and the Fifty-first Highland Division still farther to the
left opposite Beaumont Hamel. The task of the Thirty-ninth Division was to
clear out the Germans who held on to the Hansa line, the last German trench
system between the British front and the river. Their chief protection was the
almost incredible condition of the ground, which consisted of tenacious mud of
varying and occasionally of dangerous depth. Munitions could only be got across
it upon pack-horses, on special paths. In spite of these difficulties, the
Thirty-ninth Division carried the lines of trenches and the village of St.
Pierre Divion as well, the resistance being far from heroic. The attack was
made by the 117th Brigade, which advanced with such speed that the front waves,
consisting of the 16th Rifle Brigade upon the right and the 17th Sherwood
Foresters upon the left, were into the German trenches before the barrage could
fall. It did fall, however, and did great harm to the supports, both the 17th
Rifles and 16th Sherwoods losing heavily, especially the former. The British
line was pushed right up to the river, and the survivors of the
garrison&mdash;some 1400 in number&mdash;were compelled to lay down their arms.
This attack to the south of the river was an isolated, self-contained
operation, apart from the larger and more serious movement on the north
bank.</p>
<p>The right of the main assault was carried out by the gallant Sixty-third
Royal Naval Division, whose emergency baptism of fire at Antwerp has been
mentioned in this narrative, though its subsequent splendid services at
Gallipoli have not come within its scope. After the evacuation of Gallipoli and
the subsequent redistribution of the eastern army, at least three fine
divisions, the Eleventh, the Forty-second, and the Naval, besides the splendid
Australian and New Zealand infantry, were transferred to the French front. This
action of the Ancre was the first opportunity which these volunteer sailors had
had of showing upon a large European stage those qualities which had won them
fame elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Naval Division attacked to the immediate north of the Ancre, having the
river upon their right. The lines of assault were formed under cover of
darkness, for the assembly trenches were inadequate and the ground occupied was
under direct observation from the German lines. The division in this formation
was a thick mass of 10,000 infantry on a front of about 1600 yards with a depth
of 300. Fortunately, the screen of the weather covered them completely, and
there was little and random shelling during the night, but the men were stiff
and chilled by their long vigil, during which they might neither speak nor
smoke. At last, just before dawn, the crash of the barrage told that the hour
had come, and the lines moved forward, keeping well up to the shower of
shrapnel which crept on at the rate of 100 yards in five minutes, searching
every hollow and crevice of the ground.</p>
<p>The first objective was the enemy's front-line system of triple trenches.
The second was a road in the hollow behind called Station Road, with trenches
on either side of it. The third was the trenches which fringed the village of
Beaucourt. The fourth, which was only to be attempted after the third was
consolidated, was the village itself, which lies among trees upon the north
side of the river.</p>
<p>The advance of the 189th Brigade on the right of the Naval Division,
consisting of the Hood, Hawke, Nelson, and Drake battalions, was comparatively
easy, as they were partly protected from flank fire by the dead ground formed
by the low-lying northern slope down to the river. With great dash and vigour
they carried the successive lines of trenches, and before mid-day they were
consolidating the third objective with the village in their immediate
front.</p>
<p>A much more difficult task confronted the centre of the advance, consisting
of the left half of the right brigade, and the right half of the 188th Brigade,
which contained the 1st and 2nd Battalions of Marines, the Ansons and the
Howes. In the very track of their course lay a formidable German redoubt,
bristling with machine-guns, and so concealed that neither the observers nor
the bombardment had spotted it. This serious obstacle caused heavy losses to
the central attack, and as it completely commanded their advance it held them
to such cover as they could find. The left of the advance got past the redoubt,
however, and reached the sunken road, where they were in close touch with the
Scotsmen upon their left. Thus at this period of the advance the Naval Division
formed a deep curve with its right wing well forward, its centre held back, and
its left wing nearly as far advanced as its right. The mist was so thick that
it was very difficult to tell from the rear what was going on in the battle,
but the 190th Brigade held in reserve was aware that some hitch had occurred,
and pushing forward in the hope of retrieving it, found itself involved in the
fierce fighting round the redoubt, where it also was exposed to heavy loss.
This brigade, it may be mentioned, was not naval, but contained the 1st
Honourable Artillery Company, the 4th Bedfords, 7th Royal Fusiliers, and 10th
Dublins. The German fort could not be reduced, nor could progress be made in
the centre in face of its machine-guns; but the infantry, which had passed it
on either side, extended along the Sunken Road behind it, and joined hands so
as to cut it off. The whole German second line was then in their possession,
and the right third of their third line as well. The enemy still held firm,
however, in the centre of the first-line system, and showed no signs of
weakening, although they must have known that British troops were in their
rear. An attempt was made to re-bombard this portion of the line, but it was
difficult for the gunners without aerial observation to locate the exact
portion of the line which still remained with the enemy, and there was great
danger of the shells falling among our own infantry. About three in the
afternoon the conclusion was reached that it was better for the time to leave
this great pocket of Germans alone, cutting them off from either escape or
reinforcement.</p>
<p>The 111th Brigade from the Thirty-seventh Division was therefore sent up,
battalion by battalion, along the river-bank until it passed the central
obstacle and reached the Sunken Road. Thence the 13th Rifles were sent forward
with orders to reach the advanced line, where the Hoods and Drakes, somewhat
reduced in numbers but not in spirit, were lying in front of Beaucourt. It was
dark before these changes could be made. The Riflemen, when they had attained
their position, rested their right upon the Ancre, and prolonged their left,
clearing the Germans out in that direction. This movement to the left was
strengthened in the early morning when the 13th Rifle Brigade and the 13th
Royal Fusiliers of the same brigade came up to join in, whilst the H.A.C. also
advanced and took up a position on the right of the naval men.</p>
<p>About seven o'clock the assault upon the village was ordered, under the
direction and leadership of Commander Freyberg of the Hoods, already twice
wounded, and wounded once again before his task was finished. Sailors and
Riflemen rushed forward at the signal, and dashed with fierce impetuosity over
the German line and down the streets of the hamlet. The Honourable Artillery
Company upon the right joined in the charge. It was completely successful, the
houses were rapidly cleared, the dug-outs taken, and many hundreds of prisoners
secured. The Riflemen emerging on the farther side of the village immediately
dug in under the direction of their only remaining company officer. A
footbridge was at the same time thrown across the Ancre, so as to connect up
with the Thirty-ninth Division on the south.</p>
<p>The German redoubt had held out manfully until its line of retreat was
entirely cut off, and even then showed signs of continued resistance. The tanks
had already won such a position in the army that they had become one of the
last resources of the commander who was in difficulties. During the night of
November 13 three of these engines were sent for to help in reducing the
intractable German centre. Their performance was typical both of their weakness
and of their value in this early stage of their evolution. One was hit and
disabled before ever it crossed the lines. A second stuck in the mud and
refused to budge. The third won its way over the German front line and so
terrorised the obstinate garrison that they were finally induced to lay down
their arms. Eight hundred prisoners came from this one pocket, and the whole
capture of the Naval Division amounted to nearly 2000 men.</p>
<p>The advance of the Fifty-first Highland Territorial Division upon the
immediate left of the Naval Division had been equally successful, and had ended
in the capture of the important village of Beaumont Hamel with all its network
of caverns, a great store of machine-guns, and 1500 of the garrison. The
objectives of the division may be said to have been the continuation of those
of the Naval Division, substituting Beaumont Hamel for Beaucourt, but the
position was complicated by a deep ravine, called after its shape the Y Ravine,
which ran down from the village to the German trenches. The ground over which
the advance was made was still littered with the skeletons clad in rags which
represented the men who had fallen in the attack of July 1. Now, after five
months, they were gloriously avenged. The rush of the division was headed by
the 153rd Brigade, with the 4th and 7th Gordons in the lead. These two fine
battalions carried the front German lines, but on reaching the Sunken Road they
gave place to the 6th and 7th Black Watch behind them, who carried the attack
up the Y Ravine and on to Beaumont, while the Seaforths and Argylls of the
other brigades, with their staunch Lowland comrades of the 9th Royal Scots,
thickened the line of attack, and gave it the weight to carry each successive
obstacle. Only in the Y Ravine was there any momentary check to the fiery
advance. There for a short time the Germans stood stoutly to their task, and
there was some of that man-to-man work which the Scotsman loves. Then the last
signs of resistance died out, and before the late afternoon the whole position
was in the hands of the assailants, who pushed on and occupied the low ridge to
the north which separates it from Serre. One curious incident connected with
the close of the action was, that a mopping-up party of Gordons in one of the
front lines of trenches were suddenly surprised and captured by a considerable
body of Germans, who emerged suddenly from an underground tunnel. In the
evening, however, the positions were reversed, and the prisoners were rescued,
while the Germans had to surrender to the victors. Fifteen hundred prisoners
and 54 machine-guns were the spoils of the Fifty-first Division; but these were
considerably increased when the dug-outs were more carefully examined next day.
Altogether nearly 7000 officers and men were captured in the course of the
action.</p>
<p>Whilst the considerable action of Beaumont Hamel was fought upon the left,
the various divisions upon the south of the river forming the remainder of
Gough's Fifth Army all made a forward movement and gained ground. Of these
divisions, the Thirty-ninth, whose doings have already been described, was
nearest to the main battle, and was most heavily engaged, winning a complete
success. Upon its right in the order given were the Nineteenth and the
Eighteenth, connecting up with Rawlinson's Fourth Army upon the right. These
various divisions all moved their lines forward in the direction of the
river-bank, with the villages of Grandcourt and Petit Miraumont in their front.
These movements were rather in the nature of a feint and a demonstration, so
that they were not accompanied by any severe fighting. It had been planned,
however, that as these divisions advanced to the north the space which would be
left, between Gough's right and Rawlinson's left should be filled up by the
Thirty-second Division, which, should push on in the direction of Lys. This
movement gave rise to some severe fighting in which the historical 14th Brigade
sustained some heavy losses. The immediate obstacle in front of the division
was a powerful system of trenches lying amid morasses caused by the recent
heavy rains, and known as the Munich Line, with the Frankfort line behind it.
Upon November 17 the division took over the advanced trenches, while the
Eighteenth Division side-stepped to the left. The Thirty-second Division had
formed its line for attack, with the 14th Brigade upon the left and the 97th
upon the right, the leading battalions from left to right being the 15th
Highland Light Infantry, the 2nd Manchesters, the 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry,
and another battalion of H.L.I. The advance was to have been upon the 17th, but
from the beginning a series of misfortunes occurred, arising largely from the
weather, the condition of the trenches, and the severe German barrage behind
the line, which made all preparations difficult and costly. The attack was
postponed till the 18th, and even then the advancing battalions were short of
bombs, without which trench fighting becomes impossible. The ground behind the
troops was so awful that one mile in an hour was considered remarkable progress
for an unladen messenger; while the enemy's fire was so severe that of six
runners sent with a despatch only the last arrived unwounded. The Germans in
front appeared to be both numerous and full of fight, and upon the 17th they
made a vain attack upon the advanced line 'of the 14th Brigade. Two companies
of the Manchesters sustained upon this day the losses of half their number as
they lay, an object lesson in silent patient discipline in the muddy bottom of
a shell-swept ditch.</p>
<p>At 6:10 in the morning of the 18th an advance was made, but the bomb
supplies had not yet come up and the disadvantages were great. None the less,
the first line of German trenches was successfully carried by the Manchesters,
but the 15th Highland Light Infantry were held up by wire and were unable to
get forward, while the Yorkshire Light Infantry upon the right got through at
some points and were held at others. The Manchesters even penetrated to the
second line of trenches and sprang into them, but the fatal want of bombs tied
their hands, and a counter-attack of the Germans retook the position. The
Highland Light Infantry had fallen back upon Serre Trench, and were pressed by
a party of the enemy, but fortunately some of the 1st Dorsets came up from the
rear with some bombs, and the situation was saved. In the meantime the position
of those Manchesters and Yorkshiremen who had got forward as far as the second
trench, and were exposed without bombs to a bombing attack, was very serious.
They had taken a number of prisoners and some of these they managed to send
back, but the greater part of the British were bombed to pieces, and all died
where they fought or were taken by the enemy. A single survivor who returned
from the final stand made by these gallant men stated that he was the last man
who had crawled out of the trench, and that his comrades lay dead or dying in a
group in front of a blazing dug-out, the woodwork of which had taken fire. A
patrol next day came upon the bodies of an officer and forty men who had died
fighting to the last in a single group.</p>
<p>On the left of the Thirty-second Division some movement forward had been
necessary upon the part both of the Eighteenth Division and of the Nineteenth,
in order to keep the left flank of Jacob's Second Corps on the south of the
river level with the right flank of Fanshawe's Fifth Corps upon the northern
bank. This operation did not involve much work upon the part of the Eighteenth,
but the movement of the Nineteenth was difficult and complex, with Grandcourt
as a possible objective. It meant an attack upon a maze of trenches under the
worst possible terrestrial conditions, while the advance had really to be in
three The different directions&mdash;due north, north-east, and almost due
east. The 57th Brigade, strengthened by the 7th South Lancashires of the 56th
Brigade, was chosen for the difficult task. At 6 A.M. upon November 18 in a
sharp snow-storm the advance began.</p>
<p>It was the last concerted operation of the year, but it was not
unfortunately destined for success. The garrison of the trenches appear to have
been as numerous as the stormers and far more advantageously placed. The ground
was such that an advance over it without opposition would have been no easy
matter. Upon the left two battalions, the 7th South Lanes and the 8th
Gloucesters, old battle companions of La Boiselle, pushed vigorously forward
and seized the western outskirt of Grandcourt, where they held on against every
attempt to dislodge them. Stick bombs, egg bombs, rifle-grenades, and every
sort of evil missile crashed and splintered around them, but they had in
command two leaders who might be trusted to hold what they had taken. Only next
evening when the rest of the attack had definitely failed did these two
battalions withdraw to a new line on the immediate west of the village, taking
150 prisoners with them.</p>
<p>The other three battalions had fared ill owing to numerical weakness, lack
of knowledge of the ground, loss of direction, bad weather, and deadly machine
guns. Half of the 8th North Staffords won their way through to the objective,
but their comrades could not support them, and they were so isolated that,
after a gallant resistance, they were nearly all destroyed or captured, under
very much the same circumstances as the 2nd Manchesters upon the preceding day.
The commander of the North Staffords, Colonel Anderson, a gallant South
African, and several other officers were wounded and taken. Colonel Torrie of
the 7th East Lancashires was also killed in this engagement. An attempt upon
the part of the 9th Cheshires later in the evening to get into touch with their
lost comrades only served to swell the casualty lists, for it was dark before
it was initiated, and all direction was impossible amid the labyrinth of
mud-channels which faced them. Two days later the Nineteenth Division was
relieved by the Eleventh. It is difficult to exaggerate the extreme hardships
which had been endured by the whole of Jacob's corps during these operations
amid the viscid mud slopes of the Ancre. Napoleon in Poland had never better
cause to curse the fourth element. The front trenches were mere gutters, and
every attempt to deepen them only deepened the stagnant pool within. The
communications were little better. The mud was on the men's bodies, in their
food, and for ever clogging both their feet and their weapons. The hostile
shelling was continuous. It was a nightmare chapter of the campaign. Winter had
now settled down once more cheerless and prolonged. There was much to be done
in those months of gloom &mdash;divisions to be refilled, fresh divisions to be
brought out, munitions of every sort to be stored for the days of wrath to
come. But apart from the preparations for the future, the army was never quiet,
for one long succession of trench raids, exploratory attacks, and bombardments
helped to retain that ascendancy which had been gained in the long Battle of
the Somme. Before the narrative passes to the German retreat of 1917, and the
dramatic battles which followed it, it would be well to take a brief survey of
the other events which had occurred during the last half of the year, all of
which reacted more or less directly upon the campaign in the west.</p>
<p>The chief of these is undoubtedly the magnificent French recovery at Verdun.
As already stated, the German pressure was very severe in June, but it was
rapidly lessened by the counter-pressure of the Allied advance upon the Somme.
In their attempt to hold back the Franco-British advance the Germans denuded
their Verdun line to an extent which weakened it so much that, far from
advancing, it could not hold its own. In two splendid assaults upon October 24
and December 15, the first yielding 5000 prisoners and the second 11,000 with
115 guns, the French drove the Germans back until a considerable portion of
their former hard-won gains had disappeared. Considering the efforts which
France was making upon the Somme it was a splendid achievement, and it may
fairly be added to the credit of the Somme Battle, since without it, it could
hardly have been possible.</p>
<p>The second considerable factor was one of those great Russian advances
which, alternating with equally great Russian retreats, each of them coming
with a constant rhythm, made the war of the Eastern Front resemble some sort of
majestic and terrible tide, with an ebb and flow which left death and
destruction strewn over those unhappy border countries. On this occasion the
advance was in the Brody and Stanislau direction, and was pushed with such
energy and success by the fiery Brusiloff that nearly 400,000 prisoners
&mdash;or perhaps Slavonic refugees would be a more accurate description
&mdash;were taken by our Allies. The movement extended from June to September,
and might have been a vital one, had it not been for the political
disorganisation and treachery in the rear.</p>
<p>Italian armies had in the meanwhile given a splendid account of themselves,
as every one who had seen them in the field, predicted that they would. Though
hard pressed by a severe Austrian attack in the Trentino in May, they rallied
and held the enemy before he could debouch upon the plains. Then with three
hard blows delivered upon August 6 to August 9, where they took the town of
Gorizia and 12,000 prisoners, on October 10, and on November 1 they broke the
Austrian lines and inflicted heavy losses upon them. The coming of winter saw
them well upon their way to Trieste.</p>
<p>On August 4 the British forces in Egypt defeated a fresh Turco-German attack
upon that country. The battle was near Romani, east of the Suez Canal, and it
ended in a creditable victory and the capture of 2500 prisoners. This was the
end of the serious menace for Egypt, and the operations in this quarter, which
were carried on by General Murray, were confined from this time forwards to
clearing up the Sinai peninsula, where various Turkish posts were dispersed or
taken, and in advancing our line to the Palestine Frontier.</p>
<p>On August 8 our brave little ally, Portugal, threw her sword into the scale
of freedom, and so gave military continuity to the traditions of the two
nations. It would have rejoiced the austere soul of the great Duke to see the
descendants of his much-valued Ca&ccedil;adores, fighting once more beside the
great-grandsons of the Riflemen and Guardsmen of the Peninsula. Two divisions
appeared in France, where they soon made a reputation for steadiness and
valour.</p>
<p>In the East another valiant little nation had also ranged herself with the
Allies, and was destined, alas, to meet her ruin through circumstances which
were largely beyond her own control. Upon August 27 Romania declared war, and
with a full reliance upon help which never reached her, advanced at once into
the south of Hungary. Her initial successes changed to defeat, and her brave
soldiers, who were poorly provided with modern appliances of war, were driven
back before the pressure of Falkenhayn's army in the west and Mackensen's,
which eventually crossed the Danube, from the south. On December 6 Bucharest
fell, and by the end of the year the Romanians had been driven to the Russian
border, where, an army without a country, they hung on, exactly as the Belgians
had done, to the extreme edge of their ravaged fatherland. To their Western
allies, who were powerless to help them, it was one of the most painful
incidents of the War.</p>
<p>The Salonica expedition had been much hampered by the sinister attitude of
the Greeks, whose position upon the left rear of Sarrail's forces made an
advance dangerous, and a retreat destructive. King Constantine, following the
example of his brother-in-law of Berlin, had freed himself from all
constitutional ties, refused to summon a parliament, and followed his own
private predilections and interests by helping our enemies, even to the point
of surrendering a considerable portion of his own kingdom, including a whole
army corps and the port of Kavala, to the hereditary enemy, the Bulgarian.
Never in history has a nation been so betrayed by its king, and never, it may
be added, did a nation which had been free allow itself so tamely to be robbed
of its freedom.</p>
<p>Venezelos, however, showed himself to be a great patriot, shook the dust of
Athens from his feet, and departed to Salonica, where he raised the flag of a
fighting national party, to which the whole nation was eventually rallied.
Meanwhile, however, the task of General Sarrail was rendered more difficult, in
spite of which he succeeded in regaining Monastir and establishing himself
firmly within the old Serbian frontier&mdash;a result which was largely due to
the splendid military qualities of the remains of the Serbian army.</p>
<p>On December 12 the German Empire proposed negotiations for peace, but as
these were apparently to be founded upon the war-map as it then stood, and as
they were accompanied by congratulatory messages about victory from the Kaiser
to his troops, they were naturally not regarded as serious by the Allies. Our
only guarantee that a nation will not make war whenever it likes is its
knowledge that it cannot make peace when it likes, and this was the lesson
which Germany was now to learn. By the unanimous decision of all the Allied
nations no peace was possible which did not include terms which the Germans
were still very far from considering&mdash;restitution of invaded countries,
reparation for harm done, and adequate guarantees against similar unprovoked
aggression in the future. Without these three conditions the War would indeed
have been fought in vain.</p>
<p>This same month of December saw two of the great protagonists who had
commenced the War retire from that stage upon which each had played a worthy
part. The one was Mr. Asquith, who, weary from long labours, gave place to the
fresh energy of Mr. Lloyd George. The other was "Father" Joffre, who bore upon
his thick shoulders the whole weight of the early campaigns. Both of the names
will live honourably in history.</p>
<p>And now as the year drew to its close, Germany, wounded and weary, saw as
she glared round her at her enemies, a portent which must have struck a chill
to her heart. Russian strength had been discounted and that of France was no
new thing. But whence came this apparition upon her Western flank&mdash;a host
raised, as it seemed, from nowhere, and yet already bidding fair to be equal to
her own? Her public were still ignorant and blind, bemused by the journals
which had told them so long, and with such humorous detail, that the British
army was a paper army, the creature of a dream. Treitschke's foolish phrase,
"The unwarlike Islanders," still lingered pleasantly in their memory. But the
rulers, the men who knew, what must have been their feelings as they gazed upon
that stupendous array, that vision of doom, a hundred miles from wing to wing,
gleaming with two million bayonets, canopied with aeroplanes, fringed with
iron-clad motor monsters, and backed by an artillery which numbered its guns by
the thousand? Kitchener lay deep in the Orkney waves, but truly his spirit was
thundering at their gates. His brain it was who first planted these seeds, but
how could they have grown had the tolerant, long-suffering British nation not
been made ready for it by all those long years of Teutonic insult, the ravings
of crazy professors, and the insults of unbalanced publicists? All of these had
a part in raising that great host, but others, too, can claim their share: the
baby-killers of Scarborough, the Zeppelin murderers, the submarine pirates, all
the agents of ruthlessness. Among them they had put life and spirit into this
avenging apparition, where even now it could be said that every man in the
battle line had come there of his own free will. Years of folly and of crime
were crying for a just retribution. The instrument was here and the hour was
drawing on.</p>
