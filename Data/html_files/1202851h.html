  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">James Crawshay, Englishman of the type usually described in
  transatlantic circles as "some Britisher," lolled apparently at his ease upon
  the couch of the too-resplendent sitting room in the Hotel Magnificent,
  Chicago. Hobson, his American fellow traveler, on the other hand, betrayed
  his anxiety by his nervous pacing up and down the apartment. Both men bore
  traces in their appearance of the long journey which they had only just
  completed.</p>

  <p>"I think," Crawshay decided, yawning, "that I shall have a bath. I feel
  gritty, and my collar&mdash;heavens, what a sight! Your trains, Hobson, may
  be magnificent, but your coal is filthy. I will have a bath while your
  friend, the policeman, makes up his mind whether to come and see us or
  not."</p>

  <p>His companion treated the suggestion with scant courtesy.</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort," was his almost fierce objection. "We've
  got to wait right here until Chief of Police Downs comes along. There's
  something crooked about this business, something I don't understand, and the
  sooner we get to the bottom of it, the better."</p>

  <p>The Englishman pacified himself with a whisky and soda which a waiter had
  just brought in. He added several lumps of ice and drained the contents of
  the tumbler with a little murmur of appreciation.</p>

  <p>"It will be confoundedly annoying," he admitted quietly, "if we've had all
  this journey for nothing."</p>

  <p>Hobson moistened his dry lips with his tongue. The whisky and soda and the
  great bucket of ice stood temptingly at his elbow, but he appeared to ignore
  their existence. He was a man of ample build, with a big, clean-shaven face,
  a square jaw and deep-set eyes, a man devoted to and wholly engrossed by his
  work.</p>

  <p>"See here, Crawshay," he exclaimed, "if that dispatch was a fake, if we've
  been brought here on a fool's errand, they haven't done it for nothing. If
  they've brought it off against us, you mark my words, we're left&mdash;we're
  bamboozled&mdash;we're a couple of lost loons! There's nothing left for us
  but to sell candy to small boys or find a job on a farm."</p>

  <p>"You're such a pessimist," the Englishman yawned.</p>

  <p>"Pessimist!" was the angry retort. "I'll just ask you one question, my
  son. Where's Downs?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly think," Crawshay admitted, "that under the circumstances he
  might have been at the station to meet us."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't even talk through the 'phone," Hobson pointed out. "I had to
  explain who we were to one of his inspectors. No one seemed to know a
  goldarned thing about us."</p>

  <p>"They sent for him right away when you explained who you were," Crawshay
  reminded his companion.</p>

  <p>Hobson found no comfort whatever in the reflection.</p>

  <p>"Of course they did," he replied brusquely. "There's scarcely likely to be
  a chief of police of any city in the United States who wouldn't get a move on
  when he knew that Sam Hobson was waiting for a word. I haven't been in the
  Secret Service of this country for fifteen years for nothing. He'll come fast
  enough as soon as he knows I'm waiting, but all the same, what I want to know
  is, if that dispatch was on the square, why he wasn't at the station to meet
  us, and if it wasn't on the square, how the hell do we come out of this?"</p>

  <p>Their conversation was interrupted by the tinkle of the telephone which
  stood upon the table between them, the instrument which both men had been
  watching anxiously. Hobson snatched up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Police headquarters speaking? Right! Yes, this is Sam Hobson. I'm here
  with Crawshay, of the English Secret Service. We got your
  dispatch.&mdash;What's that?&mdash;Well?&mdash;Chief Downs is on the way,
  eh?&mdash;Just started? Good! We're waiting for him."</p>

  <p>Hobson replaced the receiver upon the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Downs is coming right along," he announced. "I tell you what it is, Mr.
  Crawshay," he went on, recommencing his walk up and down the apartment, "I
  don't feel happy to be so far away from the coast. That's what scares me.
  Chicago's just about the place they'd land us, if this is a hanky-panky
  trick. We're twenty hours from New York, and the <i>City of Boston</i> sails
  to-morrow at five o'clock."</p>

  <p>The Englishman shook himself and rose from his recumbent position upon the
  sofa. He was a man of youthful middle-age, colourless, with pleasant face, a
  somewhat discontented mouth, but keen grey eyes. He had been sent out from
  Scotland Yard at the beginning of the war to assist in certain work at the
  English Embassy. So far his opportunities had not been many, or marked with
  any brilliant success, and it seemed to him that the gloom of failure was
  already settling down upon their present expedition.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe, then, any more than I do, that when a certain box we
  know of is opened at the Foreign Office in London, it will contain the papers
  we are after?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I do not," was the vigorous reply. "I think they have been
  playing a huge game of bluff on us. That's why I am so worried about this
  trip. I wouldn't mind betting you the best dinner you ever ate at Delmonico's
  or at your English Savoy that that box with the broken seals they all got so
  excited about doesn't contain a single one of the papers that we're after.
  Why, those blasted Teutons wanted us to believe it! That's why some of the
  seals were broken, and why the old man himself hung about like a hen that's
  lost one of its chickens. They want us to believe that we've got the goods
  right in that box, and to hold up the search for a time while they get the
  genuine stuff out of the country. I admit right here, Mr. Crawshay, that it
  was you who put this into my head at Halifax. I couldn't swallow it then, but
  when Downs didn't meet us at the depot here, it came over me like a flash
  that you were right that we were being flimflammed."</p>

  <p>"We ought, perhaps, to have separated," the Englishman ruminated. "I ought
  to have gone to New York and you come here. On the other hand, you must
  remember that all the evidence which we have managed to collect points to
  Chicago as having been the headquarters of the whole organisation."</p>

  <p>"Sure!" the American admitted. "And there's another point about it, too.
  If this outsider who has taken on the job for them should really turn out to
  be Jocelyn Thew, I'd have banked on his working the scheme from Chicago. He
  knows the back ways of the city, or rather he used to, like a rat. Gee, it
  would be a queer thing if after all these years one were to get the bracelets
  on him!"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see," Crawshay remarked, "how such a person as this Jocelyn
  Thew, of whom you have spoken several times, could have become associated
  with an affair of this sort. Both the Germans and the Austrians at Washington
  had the name of being exceedingly particular with regard to the status of
  their agents, and he must be entirely a newcomer in international matters.
  From the <i>dossier</i> you handed me, Jocelyn Thew reads more like a kind of
  modern swashbuckler spoiling for a fight than a person likely to make a
  success of a secret service job."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry," Hobson replied. "Jocelyn Thew could hold his own at any
  court in Europe with any of you embassy swaggerers. There's nothing known
  about his family, but they say that his father was an English aristocrat, and
  he looks like it, too."</p>

  <p>"It was you yourself who called him a criminal, the first time you spoke
  of him," Crawshay reminded his companion.</p>

  <p>"And a criminal he is at heart, without a doubt," the American declared
  impressively.</p>

  <p>"Has he ever been in prison?"</p>

  <p>"He has had the luck of Old Harry," Hobson grumbled. "In New York they all
  believed that it was he who shot Graves, the Pittsburg millionaire. The
  Treasury Department will have it that he was the head of that Fourteenth
  Street gang of coiners, and I've a pal down at Baltimore who is ready to take
  his oath that he planned the theft of the Vanderloon jewels&mdash;and brought
  it off, too! But I tell you this, sir. When the trouble comes, whoever gets
  nabbed it's never Jocelyn Thew. He's the slickest thing that ever came down
  the pike."</p>

  <p>"He is well off, then?"</p>

  <p>"They say that he brought half a million from Mexico," Hobson declared.
  "How he brought money out of that country, neither I nor anybody else on the
  Force can imagine. But he did it. I know the stockbroker down-town who
  handles his investments.&mdash;Here's our man at last!"</p>

  <p>The door was opened by the floor waiter, who held it while a thin, dark
  man, dressed in civilian clothes of most correct cut, passed in. Hobson
  gripped him at once by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Chief Downs," he said, "this is my friend Mr. Crawshay, who is connected
  with the English Embassy over here. You can shake hands with him later. We're
  on a job of business, and the first thing before us is to get an answer from
  you to a certain question. Did you send this dispatch or did you not?"</p>

  <p>Hobson handed over to the newcomer the crumpled telegraph form which he
  had just produced from his pocket. The latter glanced through it and shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"It's a plant," he announced. "I'm sorry if the use of my name has misled
  you in any way, but it was quite unauthorised. I know nothing whatever about
  the matter."</p>

  <p>Hobson remained for a moment silent, silent with sick and angry
  astonishment. Crawshay had glanced towards the clock and was standing now
  with his finger upon the bell.</p>

  <p>"Is it a big thing?" the Chicago man enquired.</p>

  <p>"It's the biggest thing ever known in this country," Hobson groaned. "It's
  what is known as the Number Three Berlin plant."</p>

  <p>"You didn't get the stuff at Halifax, then?" Downs asked.</p>

  <p>"We didn't," Hobson replied bitterly. "We've sent a representative over to
  sit on the box with the broken seals till they can open it at the Foreign
  Office in London, but I never believed they'd find anything there. I'm damned
  certain they won't now!"</p>

  <p>A waiter had answered the bell.</p>

  <p>"Don't have our luggage brought up," Crawshay directed. "We are leaving
  for New York to-night. That's so, isn't it, Hobson?" he added, turning to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"You bet!" was the grim reply. "I'd give a thousand dollars to be there
  now."</p>

  <p>"The Limited's sold out," the man told them. "There are two or three
  persons who've been disappointed, staying on here till to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I'll get you on the train," Downs promised. "I can do as much as that for
  you, anyway. I'll stop and go on to the station with you from here. I'm very
  sorry about this, Hobson," he continued, fingering the dispatch. "We shall
  have to get right along to the station, but if there's anything I can do
  after you've left, command me."</p>

  <p>"You might wire New York," Hobson suggested, as he struggled into his
  overcoat. "Tell 'em to look out for the <i>City of Boston</i>, and to hold
  her up for me if they can. I've got it in my bones that Jocelyn Thew is
  running this show and that he is on that steamer."</p>

  <p>"Those fellows at Washington must have collected some useful stuff," Chief
  Downs observed, as the three men left the room and stepped into the elevator.
  "They've been working on their job since before the war, and there isn't a
  harbour on the east or west coast that they haven't got sized up. They've
  spent a million dollars in graft since January, and there's a rumour that the
  new Navy Department scheme for dealing with submarines, which was only
  adopted last month, is there among the rest."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" Crawshay asked indolently.</p>

  <p>The Chief of Police glanced first at his questioner and then at
  Hobson.</p>

  <p>"What else should there be?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"No idea," the Englishman replied. "Secret Service papers of the usual
  description, I suppose. By-the-by, I hear that this man Jocelyn Thew has
  stated openly that he is going to take all the papers he wants with him into
  Germany, and that there isn't a living soul can stop him."</p>

  <p>Hobson's square jaw was set a little tighter, and his narrow eyes
  flashed.</p>

  <p>"That's some boast to make," he muttered. "Kind of a challenge, isn't it?
  What do you say, Mr. Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay, who had been gazing out of the window of the taxicab, looked
  back again. His tone was almost indifferent.</p>

  <p>"If Chief Downs can get us on the Limited," he said, "and if we catch the
  <i>City of Boston</i>, I think perhaps we might have a chance of making Mr.
  Jocelyn Thew eat his words."</p>

  <p>The Chief smiled. The taxicab had turned in through the entrance gates of
  the great station.</p>

  <p>"I have heard men as well-known in their profession as you, Hobson, and
  you too, Mr. Crawshay, speak like that about Jocelyn Thew, but when the game
  was played out they seem to have lost the odd trick. Either the fellow isn't
  a criminal at all but loves to haunt shady places and pose as one, or he is
  just the cleverest of all the crooks who ever worked the States. Some of my
  best men have thought that they had a case against him and have come to
  grief."</p>

  <p>"They've never caught him with the goods, because they've never been the
  right way about it," Hobson declared confidently.</p>

  <p>"And you think you are going to break his record?" Downs asked, with a
  doubtful smile. "If you find him on the <i>City of Boston</i>, you know, the
  stuff you're after won't be in his pocketbook or in the lining of his steamer
  trunk."</p>

  <p>The three men were hurrying out to the platform now, where the great
  train, a blaze of light and luxury, was standing upon the track. Captain
  Downs made his way to where the Pullman conductor was standing and engaged
  him in a brief but earnest conversation. A car porter was summoned, and in a
  few moments Crawshay and Hobson found themselves standing on the steps of one
  of the cars. They leaned over to make their adieux to Chief Downs. Crawshay
  added a few words to his farewell.</p>

  <p>"I quite appreciate all your remarks about Jocelyn Thew," he said. "One is
  liable to be disappointed, of course, but I still feel that if we can catch
  that steamer it might be an exceedingly interesting voyage."</p>

  <p>"If you're on time you may do it," was the brief reply. "All the
  same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The gong had sounded and the train was gliding slowly out of the station.
  Crawshay leaned over the iron gate of the car.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," he begged. "Don't mind my feelings."</p>

  <p>Chief Downs waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he confessed, "that my money would be on Jocelyn Thew."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At just about the hour when Crawshay and Hobson were
  receiving the visit of Chief Downs in the Chicago hotel an English butler
  accepted with due respect the card of a very distinguished-looking and
  exceedingly well-turned-out caller at the big, brownstone Beverley house in
  Riverside Drive, New York.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley is just back from the hospital, sir," the former announced.
  "If you will come this way, I will see that your card is sent to her at
  once."</p>

  <p>The caller&mdash;Mr. Jocelyn Thew was the name upon the
  card&mdash;followed the servant across the white stone circular hall, with
  its banked-up profusion of hothouse flowers and its air of elegant emptiness,
  into a somewhat austere but very dignified apartment, the walls of which were
  lined to the ceiling with books.</p>

  <p>"I will let Miss Beverley have your card at once, sir," the man promised
  him again, "if you will be so kind as to take a seat for a few moments."</p>

  <p>The visitor, left to himself, stood upon the hearthrug with his hands
  behind his back, waiting for news of the young lady whom he had come to
  visit. At first sight he certainly was a most prepossessing-looking person.
  His face, if a little hard, was distinguished by a strength which for the
  size of his features was somewhat surprising. His chin was like a piece of
  iron, and although his mouth had more sensitive and softer lines, his
  dark-blue eyes and jet-black eyebrows completed a general impression of
  vigour and forcefulness. His figure was a little thin but lithe, and his
  movements showed all the suppleness of a man who has continued the pursuit of
  athletics into early middle-life. His hair, only slightly streaked with grey,
  was thick and plentiful. His clothes were carefully chosen and well tailored.
  He had the air of a man used to mixing with the best people, to eating and
  drinking the best, to living in the best fashion, recognising nothing less as
  his due in life. Yet as he stood there waiting for his visitor, listening
  intently for the sound of her footsteps outside, he permitted himself a
  moment of retrospection, and there was a gleam of very different things in
  his face, a touch almost of the savage in the clenched teeth and sudden
  tightening of the lips. One might have gathered that this man was living
  through a period of strain.</p>

  <p>The entrance of the young lady of the house, after a delay of about ten
  minutes, was noiseless and unannounced. Her visitor, however, was prepared
  for it. She came towards him with an air of pleasant enquiry in her very
  charming face&mdash;a young woman in the early twenties, of little more than
  medium height, with complexion inclined to be pale, deep grey eyes, and a
  profusion of dark brown, almost copper-coloured hair. She carried herself
  delightfully and her little smile of welcome was wonderfully attractive,
  although her deportment and manner were a little serious for her years.</p>

  <p>"You wish to see me?" she asked. "I am Miss Beverley&mdash;Miss Katharine
  Beverley." "Sometimes known as Sister Katharine," her visitor remarked, with
  a smile.</p>

  <p>"More often than by my own name," she assented. "Do you come from the
  hospital?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head and glanced behind her to be sure that the door was
  closed.</p>

  <p>"Please do not think that my coming means any trouble, Miss Beverley," he
  said, "but if you look at me more closely you will perhaps recognise me. You
  will perhaps remember&mdash;a promise."</p>

  <p>He stepped a little forward from his position of obscurity to where the
  strong afternoon sunlight found its subdued way through the Holland blinds.
  The politely interrogative smile faded from her lips. She seemed to pass
  through a moment of terror, a moment during which her thoughts were numbed.
  She sank into the chair which her visitor gravely held out for her, and by
  degrees she recovered her powers of speech.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," she begged. "The name upon the card should have warned
  me&mdash;but I had no idea&mdash;I was not expecting a visit from you."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he acquiesced smoothly, "and I beg you not to discompose
  yourself. My visit bodes you no harm&mdash;neither you nor any one belonging
  to you."</p>

  <p>"I was foolish," she confessed. "I have been working overtime at the
  hospital lately&mdash;we have sent so many of our nurses to France. My nerves
  are not quite what they should be."</p>

  <p>He bowed sympathetically. His tone and demeanour were alike
  reassuring.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," he said. "Still, some day or other I suppose you
  expected a visit from me?"</p>

  <p>"In a way I certainly did," she admitted. "You must let me know presently,
  please, exactly what I can do. Don't think because I was startled to see you
  that I wish to repudiate my debt. I have never ceased to be grateful to you
  for your wonderful behaviour on that ghastly night."</p>

  <p>"Please do not refer to it," he begged. "Your brother, I hope, is
  well?"</p>

  <p>"He is well and doing famously," she replied. "I suppose you know that he
  is in France?"</p>

  <p>"In France?" he repeated. "No, I had not heard."</p>

  <p>"He joined the Canadian Flying Corps," she went on, "and he got his wings
  almost at once. He finds the life out there wonderful. I never receive a
  letter from him," she concluded, her eyes growing very soft, "that I do not
  feel a little thrill of gratitude to you."</p>

  <p>He bowed.</p>

  <p>"That is very pleasant," he murmured. "And now we come to the object of my
  visit. Your surmise was correct. I have come to ask you to redeem your
  word."</p>

  <p>"And you find me not only ready but anxious to do so," she told him
  earnestly. "If it is a matter&mdash;pardon me&mdash;of money, you have only
  to say how much. If there is any other service you require, you have only to
  name it."</p>

  <p>"You make things easy for me," he acknowledged, "but may I add that it is
  only what I expected. The service which I have come to claim from you is one
  which is not capable of full explanation but which will cause you little
  inconvenience and less hardship. You will find it, without doubt, surprising,
  but I need not add that it will be entirely innocent in its character."</p>

  <p>"Then there seems to be very little left," she declared, smiling up at him
  from the depths of her chair, "but to name it. I do wish you would sit down,
  and are you quite sure that you won't have some tea or something?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head gravely and made no movement towards the chair which she
  had indicated. For some reason or other, notwithstanding her manifest
  encouragement, he seemed to wish to keep their interview on a purely formal
  basis.</p>

  <p>"Let me repeat," he continued, "that I shall offer you no comprehensive
  explanations, because they would not be truthful, nor are they altogether
  necessary. In Ward Number Fourteen of your hospital&mdash;you have been so
  splendid a patroness that every one calls St. Agnes's your hospital&mdash;a
  serious operation was performed to-day upon an Englishman named
  Phillips."</p>

  <p>"I remember hearing about it," she assented. "The man is, I understand,
  very ill."</p>

  <p>"He is so ill that he has but one wish left in life," Jocelyn Thew told
  her gravely. "That wish is to die in England. Just as you are at the present
  moment in my debt for a certain service rendered, so am I in his. He has
  called upon me to pay. He has begged me to make all the arrangements for his
  immediate transportation to his native country." She nodded
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"It is a very natural wish," she observed, "so long as it does not
  endanger his life."</p>

  <p>"It does not endanger his life," her visitor replied, "because that is
  already forfeit. I come now to the condition which involves you, which
  explains my presence here this afternoon. It is also his earnest desire that
  you should attend him so far as London as his nurse."</p>

  <p>The look of vague apprehension which had brought a questioning frown into
  Katharine Beverley's face faded away. It was succeeded by an expression of
  blank and complete surprise.</p>

  <p>"That I should nurse him&mdash;should cross with him to London?" she
  repeated. "Why, I do not know this man Phillips. I never saw him in my life!
  I have not even been in Ward Fourteen since he was brought there."</p>

  <p>"But he," Jocelyn Thew explained, "has seen you. He has been a visitor at
  your hospital before he was received there as a patient. He has received from
  various doctors wonderful accounts of your skill. Besides this, he is a
  superstitious man, and he has been very much impressed by the fact that you
  have never lost a patient. If you had been one of your own probationers, the
  question of a fee would have presented no difficulties, although he
  personally is, I believe, a poor man. As it is, however, his strange craving
  for your services has become a charge upon me."</p>

  <p>"It is the most extraordinary request I ever heard in my life," Katharine
  murmured. "If I had ever seen or spoken to the man, I could have understood
  it better, but as it is, I find it impossible to understand."</p>

  <p>"You must look upon it," Jocelyn Thew told her, "as one of those strange
  fancies which comes sometimes to men who are living in the shadowland of
  approaching death. There is one material circumstance, however, which may
  make the suggestion even more disconcerting for you. The steamer upon which
  we hope to sail leaves at four o'clock to-morrow afternoon."</p>

  <p>The idea in this new aspect was so ludicrous that she simply laughed at
  him.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Jocelyn Thew!" she exclaimed. "You can't possibly be in
  earnest! You mean that you expect me to leave New York with less than
  twenty-four hours' notice, and go all the way to London in attendance upon a
  stranger, especially in these awful times? Why, the thing isn't
  reasonable&mdash;or possible! I have just consented to take the chairmanship
  of a committee to form field hospitals throughout the country,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"May I interrupt for one moment?" her visitor begged.</p>

  <p>The stream of words seemed to fall away from her lips. There was a touch
  of Jocelyn Thew's other manner&mdash;perhaps more than a touch. She looked at
  him and she shivered. She had seen him look like that once before.</p>

  <p>"Your attitude is perfectly reasonable," he continued, "but on the other
  hand I must ask you to carry your thoughts back some little time. I shall beg
  you to remember that I have a certain right to ask this or any other service
  from you." "I admit it," she confessed hastily, "but&mdash;there is something
  so outlandish in the whole suggestion. There are a score of nurses in the
  hospital to any one of whom you are welcome, who are all much cleverer than
  I. What possible advantage to the man can it be, especially if he is
  seriously ill, to have a partially-trained nurse with him when he might have
  the best in the world?"</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "I mentioned that this is not a matter for reasoning
  or argument. It is you who are required, and no one else. I may remind you,"
  he went on, "that this service is a very much smaller one than I might have
  asked you, and, so far as you and I are concerned, it clears our debt."</p>

  <p>"Clears our debt," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"For ever!"</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes for several moments. For some reason or other, this
  last reflection seemed to bring her no particular relief. When she opened
  them again, her decision was written in her face.</p>

  <p>"I consent, of course," she acquiesced quietly. "Is there anything more to
  tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," he replied, "only this. You should send your baggage on
  board the City of Boston as early as possible to-morrow morning. Every
  arrangement has been made for transporting Phillips in his bed, as he lies,
  from the hospital to the boat. The doctor who has been in attendance will
  accompany him to England, but it is important that you should be at the
  hospital and should drive in the ambulance from there to the dock. I shall
  ask very little of you in the way of duplicity. What is necessary you will
  not, I think, refuse. You will be considered to have had some former interest
  in Phillips, to account for your voyage, and you will reconcile yourself to
  the fact that I shall not at any time approach the sick man, or be known as
  an acquaintance of his on board the ship."</p>

  <p>His words disturbed her. She felt herself being drawn under the shadow of
  some mystery.</p>

  <p>"There is something in all this," she said, "which reminds me of the time
  when Richard was your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the time when we met
  before."</p>

  <p>He leaned towards her, understanding very well what was in her mind.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing criminal in this enterprise&mdash;even in my share of
  it," he assured her. "What there is in it which necessitates secrecy is
  political, and that need not concern you. You see," he went on, a little
  bitterly, "I have changed my role. I am no longer the despair of the New York
  police. I am the quarry of a race of men who, if they could catch me, would
  not wait to arrest. That may happen even before we reach Liverpool. If it
  does, it will not affect you. Your duty is to stay with a dying man until he
  reaches the shelter of his home. You will leave him there, and you will be
  free of him and of me."</p>

  <p>"So far as regards our two selves," she enquired, "do we meet as strangers
  upon the steamer?"</p>

  <p>He considered the matter for a few moments before answering. She felt
  another poignant thrill of recollection. He had looked at her like this just
  before he had bent his back to the task of saving her brother's life and
  liberty, looked at her like this the moment before the unsuspected revolver
  had flashed from the pocket of his dress-coat and had covered the man who had
  suddenly declared himself their foe. She felt her cheeks burn for a moment.
  There was something magnetic, curiously troublous about his eyes and his
  faint smile.</p>

  <p>"I cannot deny myself so much," he said. "Even if our opportunities for
  meeting upon the steamer are few, I shall still have the pleasure of a New
  York acquaintance with Miss Beverley. You need not be afraid," he went on.
  "In this wonderful country of yours, the improbable frequently happens. I
  have before now visited at the houses of some whom you call your
  friends."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked him. "I should look upon it as the most natural thing
  in the world that we were acquainted. But why do you say 'your country'? Are
  you not an American?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a very faint smile, a smile which had nothing in it
  of pleasantness or mirth.</p>

  <p>"I have so few secrets," he said. "The only one which I elect to keep is
  the secret of my nationality."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Then you can no longer," she observed, "be considered what my brother and
  I once thought you&mdash;a man of mysteries&mdash;for with your voice and
  accent it is very certain that you are either English or American."</p>

  <p>"If it affords you any further clue, then," he replied, "let me confide in
  you that if there is one country in this world which I detest, it is England;
  one race of people whom I abominate, it is the English."</p>

  <p>She showed her surprise frankly, but his manner encouraged no further
  confidence. She touched the bell, and he bowed over her fingers.</p>

  <p>"My friend Phillips," he said, in formal accents, as the butler stood upon
  the threshold, "will never live, I fear, to offer you all the gratitude he
  feels, but you are doing a very kind and a very wonderful action, Miss
  Beverley, and one which I think will bring its own reward."</p>

  <p>He passed out of the room, leaving Katharine a prey to a curious tangle of
  emotions. She watched him almost feverishly until he had disappeared,
  listened to his footsteps in the hall and the closing of the front door. Then
  she hurried to the window, watched him descend the row of steps, pass down
  the little drive and hail a taxicab. It was not until he was out of sight
  that she became in any way like herself. Then she broke into a little
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Heavens alive!" she exclaimed to herself. "Now I have to find Aunt Molly
  and tell her that I am going to Europe to-morrow with a perfect
  stranger!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Jocelyn Thew descended presently from his taxicab
  outside one of the largest and most cosmopolitan hotels in New York&mdash;or
  the world. He made his way with the air of an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> to the
  bar, the precincts of which, at that time in the late afternoon, were crowded
  by a motley gathering. He ordered a Scotch highball, and gently insinuated
  himself into the proximity of a group of newspaper men with whom he seemed to
  have some slight acquaintance. It was curious how, since his arrival in this
  democratic meeting-place, his manners and deportment seemed to have slipped
  to a lower grade. He seemed as though by an effort of will to have lost
  something of his natural air of distinction, to be treading the earth upon a
  lower plane. He saluted the barkeeper by his Christian name, listened with
  apparent interest to an exceedingly commonplace story from one of his
  neighbours, and upon its conclusion drew a little nearer to the group.</p>

  <p>"Say," he exclaimed confidentially, "if I felt in the humour for it I
  could hand you boys out a great scoop."</p>

  <p>They were on him like a pack of hungry though dubious wolves. He pushed
  his glass out of sight, accepted one of the drinks pressed upon him, and
  leaned nonchalantly against the counter.</p>

  <p>"What should you say," he began, "to Miss Katharine Beverley, the New York
  society young lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sister Katharine of St. Agnes's?" one of them interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Daughter of old Joe Beverley, the multi-millionaire?" another
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Both right," Jocelyn Thew acquiesced. "What should you say to that young
  woman leaving her hospital and her house in Riverside Drive, breaking all her
  engagements at less than twenty-four hours' notice, to take a sick Englishman
  whom no one knows anything about, back to Liverpool on the <i>City of
  Boston</i> to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"The story's good enough," a ferret-faced little man at his elbow
  acknowledged, "but is it true?"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew regarded his questioner with an air of pained surprise.</p>

  <p>"It's Gospel," he assured them all, "but you don't need to take my word.
  You go right along up and enquire at the Beverley house to-night, and you'll
  find that she is packing. Made up her mind just an hour ago. I'm about the
  only one in the know."</p>

  <p>"Who's the man, anyway?" one of the little group asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," Jocelyn Thew replied mysteriously. "You've got to find
  that out for yourself, boys. All I can tell you is that he's an Englishman,
  and she has known him for a long time&mdash;kind of love stunt, I imagine.
  She wasn't having any, but now he's at death's door she seems to have
  relented. Anyway, she is breaking every engagement she's got, giving up her
  chairmanship of the War Hospitals Committee, and she isn't going to leave him
  while he's alive. There's no other nurse going, so it'll be a night and day
  job for her."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the chap, anyway?" another questioner
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"No one knows for sure," was the cautious reply. "He's been operated upon
  for appendicitis, but I fancy there are complications. Not much chance for
  him, from what I have heard."</p>

  <p>The little crowd of men melted away. Jocelyn Thew smiled to himself on his
  way out, as he watched four of them climb into a taxicab.</p>

  <p>"That establishes Phillips all right as Miss Beverley's
  prot&eacute;g&eacute;," he murmured, as he turned into Fifth Avenue. "And
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short in his reflections. His careful scrutiny of the
  heterogeneous crowd gathered together around the bar had revealed to him no
  unfamiliar type save the little man who at that moment was ambling along on
  the other side of the way. Jocelyn Thew slackened his pace somewhat and
  watched him keenly. He was short, he wore a cheap ready-made suit of some
  plain material, and a straw hat tilted on the back of his head. He had round
  cheeks, he shambled rather than walked, and his vacuous countenance seemed
  both good-natured and unintelligent. To all appearances a more harmless
  person never breathed, yet Jocelyn Thew, as he studied him earnestly, felt
  that slight tightening of the nerves which came to him almost instinctively
  in moments of danger. He changed his purpose and turned down Fifth Avenue
  instead of up. The little man, it appeared, had business in the same
  direction. Jocelyn Thew walked the length of several blocks in leisurely
  fashion and then entered an hotel, studiously avoiding looking behind him. He
  made his way into a telephone booth and looked through the glass door. His
  follower in a few moments was visible, making apparently some aimless enquiry
  across the counter. Jocelyn Thew turned his back upon him and asked the
  operator for a number.</p>

  <p>"Number 238 Park waiting," the latter announced, a few moments later.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew reentered the box and took up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"That you, Rentoul?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Speaking," was the guarded reply. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew. Say, what's wrong with you? Don't go away."</p>

  <p>"What is it? Speak quickly, please."</p>

  <p>"You seem rather nervy up there. I'm off to Europe to-morrow on the
  <i>City of Boston</i>, and I should like to see you before I go."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come up here, then?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not," Jocelyn Thew observed laconically. "The fact of it is, I
  have a friend around who doesn't seem to care about losing sight of me. If
  you are going to be anywhere around near Jimmy's, about seven
  o'clock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That goes," was the somewhat agitated reply. "Ring off now. There's some
  one else waiting to speak."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew paid for his telephone call and walked leisurely out of the
  hotel with a smile upon his lips. The stimulus of danger was like wine to
  him. The little man was choosing a cigar at the stall. As he leaned down to
  light it, Jocelyn Thew's practiced eye caught the shape of a revolver in his
  hip pocket.</p>

  <p>"English," he murmured softly to himself. "Probably one of Crawshay's lot,
  preparing a report for him when he returns from Chicago."</p>

  <p>With an anticipatory smile, he entered upon the task of shaking off his
  unwelcome follower. He passed with the confident air of a member into a big
  club situated in an adjoining block, left it almost at once by a side
  entrance, found a taxicab, drove to a subway station up-town, and finally
  caught an express back again to Fourteenth Street. Here he entered without
  hesitation a small, foreign-looking restaurant which intruded upon the
  pavement only a few yards from the iron staircase by which he descended from
  the station. There were two faded evergreen shrubs in cracked pots at the
  bottom of the steps, soiled muslin curtains drawn across the lower half of
  the windows, dejected-looking green shutters which, had the appearance of
  being permanently nailed against the walls, and a general air of foreign and
  tawdry profligacy. Jocelyn Thew stepped into a room on the right-hand side of
  the entrance and, making his way to the window, glanced cautiously out. There
  was no sign anywhere of the little man. Then he turned towards the bar,
  around which a motley group of Italians and Hungarians were gathered. The
  linen-clad negro who presided there met his questioning glance with a slight
  nod, and the visitor passed without hesitation through a curtained opening to
  the rear of the place, along a passage, up a flight of narrow stairs until he
  arrived at a door on the first landing. He knocked and was at once bidden to
  enter. For a moment he listened as though to the sounds below. Then he
  slipped into the room and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The apartment was everything which might have been expected, save for the
  profusion of flowers. The girl who greeted him, however, was different. She
  was of medium height and dark, with dark brown hair plaited close back from
  an almost ivory-coloured forehead. Her grey eyes were soft and framed in dark
  lines. Her eyebrows were noticeable, her mouth full but shapely. Her
  discontented expression changed entirely as she held out both her hands to
  her visitor. Her welcome was eager, almost passionate.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thew!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He held up his hand as though to check further speech, and listened for a
  moment intently.</p>

  <p>"How are things here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Quiet," she assured him. "You couldn't have come at a better time. Every
  one's away. Is there anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I am being followed," he told her, "and I don't like it&mdash;just now,
  at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Any one else coming?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Rentoul," he told her. "He is in a mortal fright at having to come. They
  found his wireless, and they are watching his house. I must see him, though,
  before I go away."</p>

  <p>"Going away?" she echoed. "When? When are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he replied, "I sail for London."</p>

  <p>She seemed for a moment absolutely speechless, consumed by a sort of
  silent passion that found no outlet in words. She gripped a fancy mat which
  covered an ornate table by her side, and dragged a begilded vase on to the
  floor without even noticing it. She leaned towards him. The little lines at
  the sides of her eyes were suddenly deep-riven like scars. Her eyes
  themselves were smouldering with fire.</p>

  <p>"You are going to England!"</p>

  <p>"That is what I propose," he assented. "I am sailing on the <i>City of
  Boston</i> to-morrow afternoon."</p>

  <p>"But the risk!" she faltered. "I thought that you dared not set foot in
  England."</p>

  <p>"There is risk," he admitted. "It is not easy to amuse oneself anywhere
  without it. I have been offered a hundred thousand pounds to superintend the
  conveyance of certain documents and a certain letter to Berlin. The adventure
  appeals to me, and I have undertaken it. Until I found this man following me
  this afternoon, I really believed that we had put every one off the track. I
  know for a fact that most of the American officials believe that the papers
  for which they have searched so long and anxiously are in that trunk with the
  broken seals which they found at Halifax."</p>

  <p>"What about the Englishman, Crawshay, and Sam Hobson?" the girl asked.</p>

  <p>"They are not quite so credulous," he replied, "but at the present moment
  they are in Chicago, and if we get off at four o'clock punctually to-morrow
  afternoon, I scarcely think I shall be troubled with their presence on the
  <i>City of Boston</i>." "I have been reading about the trunk," the girl said.
  "Is it really a fake?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," he assured her. "There is not a single document in it which
  concerns either us or our friends. Everything that is of vital importance
  will be on the <i>City of Boston</i> to-morrow and under my charge."</p>

  <p>She looked at him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Thew," she exclaimed, "you are clever, I know&mdash;even
  wonderful&mdash;but what possible chance have you of getting those things
  through&mdash;on an American steamer, too!"</p>

  <p>"I have to take my risks, of course," he admitted coolly, "but the game is
  worth it. I can't live without excitement, as you know, and it's getting
  harder and harder to find on this side of the ocean. Besides, there is the
  money. I can think of several uses for a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>She caught his wrist suddenly and leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Can I come with you?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't advise a sea voyage just now, Nora," he said. "It isn't
  exactly a picnic, nowadays. Besides, if you come on the <i>City of Boston</i>
  there will be more than one danger to be faced."</p>

  <p>"Danger!" she exclaimed contemptuously. "Have I ever shown myself afraid?
  Have we any of us&mdash;my brother or father or I&mdash;hesitated to run any
  possible risk when it was worth while? This house has been yours, and we in
  it, to do what you will with. It isn't a matter of danger&mdash;you know
  that. I come or go as you bid me." He met the fierce enquiry of her eyes
  without flinching. Only his tone was a little kinder as he answered her.</p>

  <p>"I think, Nora," he said, "that you had better stay."</p>

  <p>There was a timid but persistent knocking at the door, and, in response to
  Nora's invitation, a fat and bloated man entered the room hurriedly. He sank
  into a chair and mopped the perspiration from his forehead. Jocelyn Thew
  watched him with an air of contemptuous amusement.</p>

  <p>"You seem distressed, Rentoul," he remarked. "Has anything gone
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>"But it is terrible, this!" the newcomer declared. "Anything gone wrong,
  indeed! Listen. The police have made themselves free of my house. My
  beautiful wireless&mdash;it was only a hobby&mdash;it has gone! They open my
  letters. They will ruin me. Never did I think that this would arrive! There
  has been some terrible bungling!"</p>

  <p>"And you," Jocelyn Thew retorted, "seem to have been the arch
  bungler."</p>

  <p>"I? But what have I done?" Rentoul demanded, wringing his hands. "I have
  always obeyed orders. Even a hint has been enough. I have spent a great deal
  of money&mdash;much more than I could afford. What have I done wrong?"</p>

  <p>"You have talked too much, for one thing," was the cold reply, "but we
  haven't time for recriminations now. How did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"I came in my car. You will perhaps say that it was not wise, but I could
  not have stood the subway. My nerves are all rotten." Jocelyn Thew's tone and
  gesture were smoothly disdainful.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he agreed. "You have lost what you call your nerve.
  You had better send for the newspaper men, give them plenty of champagne, and
  explain what a loyal American citizen you are. Have you burnt
  everything?"</p>

  <p>"Every scrap of paper in the house which concerns a certain matter is
  burnt," Rentoul declared.</p>

  <p>"It would be!"</p>

  <p>"But I am in the right," the agitated man protested vigorously. "For five
  years we have worked and with good result. It is finished with us now for the
  present. There is no one who would dare to continue. Five long years, mind
  you, Mr. Jocelyn Thew. That is worth something, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever it may be worth," was the somewhat grim reply, "will be decided
  within the next fortnight. That doesn't concern you, though."</p>

  <p>"You are not staying over here now that the war has come?"</p>

  <p>"Not I! But listen. There is no need for you to know where I am going, and
  I am not going to tell you. There is no need for you to remember that you
  ever knew me in your life. There is no need for you to remember any of the
  work in which you have been engaged. Your propaganda has developed a few
  strong men in this country and discovered a good deal of pulp. You are part
  of the pulp. There is only one other thing. If you should be heard of,
  Rentoul, shall we say telephoning, or calling upon the police here, offering
  to sell&mdash;No, by God, you don't!" The man's furtive tug at his hip pocket
  was almost pathetic in its futility. Jocelyn Thew had him by the throat,
  holding him with one hand well away from him, a quivering mass of
  discoloured, terrified flesh.</p>

  <p>"Now you know," he continued coolly, "why I sent for you, Rentoul. Now you
  know why I rather preferred to see you here to coming to your Fifth Avenue
  mansion. I don't like traps&mdash;I don't like traitors."</p>

  <p>"I give you my word," the breathless man began, "my word of
  honour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Neither would interest me," the other interrupted grimly. "You are to be
  trusted just as far as you can be seen, just as far as your own safety and
  welfare depend upon your fidelity. You needn't be so terrified," he went on
  as, leaning over, he took the revolver from Rentoul's pocket, drew out the
  cartridges and threw it upon the table. "You've earned any ugly thing that
  might be coming to you, but I should think it very probable that you will be
  able to go on over-feeding your filthy carcass for a few more years. First of
  all, though, perhaps you had better tell me exactly why you have an
  appointment with Mr. Harrison, from Police Headquarters, at eleven o'clock
  to-morrow morning?"</p>

  <p>Rentoul was white to the lips.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to explain about the wireless," he faltered.</p>

  <p>"That sounds very probable," was the contemptuous reply. "What else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew shrugged his shoulders. His victim cowered before him. For
  the first time the girl moved. She came a little nearer, and there was fury
  in her eyes as she looked down upon the terrified man.</p>

  <p>"We could keep him here," she whispered. "Ned Grimes and some of the
  others will be in soon. There are plenty of ways of getting rid of him for a
  time."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be worth while," Thew said simply. "One doesn't commit crimes
  for such carrion."</p>

  <p>Rentoul had struggled into a sitting posture. He was dabbing feebly at his
  forehead with an overperfumed handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to make peace at Headquarters," he whined. "I want to be left
  alone. I should not have told them anything."</p>

  <p>"That may or may not be," Jocelyn Thew replied. "All that I am fairly sure
  of is that you will keep your mouth shut now. You know," he went on, his
  voice growing a shade more menacing, "that I never threaten where I do not
  perform. I may not be over here myself, but there will be a few men left in
  New York, and one word from your lips&mdash;even a hint&mdash;and your life
  will pay the forfeit within twenty-four hours. You will be watched for a
  time&mdash;you and a few others of your kidney&mdash;watched until the time
  has gone by when anything you could say or do would be of account."</p>

  <p>"Have you anything more to say to me?" the man stammered. "I feel
  faint."</p>

  <p>His persecutor threw open the door.</p>

  <p>"Nothing! Get into your car and drive home. Keep out of sight and hearing
  for a time. You are no particular ornament nor any use to any country, but
  remember that everything you have done, you have done when the country of
  your birth was in trouble and the country of your adoption was at peace. The
  situation is altered. The country of which you are a naturalised citizen is
  now at war. You had better remember it, and decide for yourself where your
  duty lies."</p>

  <p>They listened to his heavy footsteps as he descended the stairs. Then the
  girl turned to her companion.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thew," she began, "you are not a German or an Austrian, yet you are
  doing their work, risking your life every day. Is it for money?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "in a general way it is not for money."</p>

  <p>"What is it, then?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He stood looking out across the roofs and at the distant skyscrapers. She
  watched him without speaking. She knew very well that his eyes saw nothing of
  the landscape. He was looking back into some world of his own fancy, back,
  perhaps, into the shadows of his own life, concerning which no word that she
  or any one else in the city had ever heard had passed his lips.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The two men&mdash;Crawshay and Sam Hobson&mdash;still a
  little breathless, stood at the end of the dock, gazing out towards the
  river. Around them was a slowly dispersing crowd of sightseers, friends and
  relations of the passengers on board the great American liner, ploughing her
  way down the river amidst the shrieks and hoots of her attendant tugs. Out on
  the horizon, beyond the Statue of Liberty, two long, grey, sinister shapes
  were waiting. Hobson glanced at them gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Guess those are our destroyers going to take the <i>City of Boston</i>
  some of the way across," he observed. "To think, with all this fuss about,
  that she must go and start an hour before her time!"</p>

  <p>"It's filthy luck," the Englishman muttered.</p>

  <p>The crowd grew thinner and thinner, yet the two men made no movement
  towards departure. It seemed to Crawshay impossible that after all they had
  gone through they should have failed. The journey in the fast motor car,
  after a breakdown of the Chicago Limited, rushing through the night like some
  live monster, tearing now through a plain of level lights, as they passed
  through some great city, vomiting fire and flame into the black darkness of
  the country places. It was like the ride of madmen, and more than once they
  had both hung on to their seats in something which was almost terror. "How
  are we going?" Crawshay had asked perpetually.</p>

  <p>"Still that infernal half-hour," was the continual reply. "We are doing
  seventy, but we don't seem to be able to work it down."</p>

  <p>A powerful automobile had taken them through the streets of New York, and
  lay now a wreck in one of the streets a mile from the dock. They had finished
  the journey in a taxicab, and the finish had been this&mdash;half an hour
  late! Yet they lingered, with their eyes fixed upon the disappearing
  ship.</p>

  <p>"I guess there's nothing more we can do," Hobson said at last grudgingly.
  "We can lay it up for them on the other side, and we can talk to her all the
  way to Liverpool on the wireless, but if there is any scoop to be made the
  others'll get it&mdash;not us."</p>

  <p>"If only we could have got on board!" Crawshay muttered. "It's no use
  thinking of a tug, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The American shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She's too far out," he replied gloomily. "There's nothing to be hired
  that could catch her."</p>

  <p>Crawshay's hand had suddenly stolen to his chin. There was a queer light
  in his eyes. He clutched at his companion's arm.</p>

  <p>"You're wrong, Hobson," he exclaimed. "There is! Come right along with me.
  We can talk as we go."</p>

  <p>"Are you crazy?" the American demanded.</p>

  <p>"Not quite," the other answered. "Hurry up, man."</p>

  <p>"Where to?" "To New Jersey. I've got Government orders, endorsed by your
  own Secretary of War. It's a hundred to one they won't listen to me, but
  we've got to try it."</p>

  <p>He was already dragging his companion down the wooden way. His whole
  expression had changed. His face was alight with the joy of an idea. Already
  Hobson, upon whom the germ of that idea had dawned, began to be infected with
  his enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"It's a gorgeous stunt," he acknowledged, as he followed his companion
  into a taxicab. "If we bring it off, it's going to knock the movies
  silly."</p>

  <p>Katharine, weary at last of waving her hand to the indistinct blur of
  faces upon the dock, picked up the great clusters of roses which late
  arrivals had thrust into her arms at the last moment, and descended to her
  stateroom upon the saloon deck. She spent only a few minutes looking at the
  arrangement of her things, and then knocked at the door of the stateroom
  exactly opposite. A thick-browed, heavy-looking man, sombrely and
  professionally dressed, opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Are you wanting me, Doctor Gant?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The patient is asleep," he announced in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Katharine stepped inside and stood looking down upon the pale, almost
  ghastly face of the man stretched at full length upon the bed.</p>

  <p>"Why, I remember him perfectly," she exclaimed. "He was in Number Three
  Ward for some time. Surely he was a clerk at one of the drygoods stores
  down-town?"</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very likely."</p>

  <p>"I remember the case," Katharine continued,&mdash;"appendicitis, followed
  by pneumonia, and complicated by angina pectoris."</p>

  <p>"You have it precisely."</p>

  <p>Katharine's eyes were full of perplexity.</p>

  <p>"But the man is in very poor circumstances," she remarked. "How on earth
  can he afford a trip like this? He was on the free list at the hospital."</p>

  <p>The doctor frowned.</p>

  <p>"That is not my business," he said. "My fees are paid, and the steamer
  tickets appear to be in order. He probably has wealthy friends."</p>

  <p>Katharine looked down once more at the sleeping man. His face was
  insignificant, his expression peevish, his features without the animation of
  any high purpose.</p>

  <p>"I really cannot understand," she murmured, "how he became a
  friend&mdash;a friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A friend of whom?" the doctor enquired.</p>

  <p>Katharine reflected and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I was indiscreet," she confessed. "I dare say you know as much
  about him as I do. At what time would you like me to come and help you change
  the bandages?"</p>

  <p>"I shall change them alone," the doctor replied.</p>

  <p>"I prefer to."</p>

  <p>Katharine glanced up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Surely you are not in earnest?" she asked. "What else am I here for? I
  suppose you realise that I am fully qualified?"</p>

  <p>The doctor unbent a little.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly well aware of that. Miss Beverley," he said, "and it may
  be that there are times when I shall be glad of your help, and in any case,"
  he went on, "I shall have to ask you to take a share in the night watching.
  But the surgical part of the case has been a great responsibility, and I
  couldn't afford to have the slightest thing in the world happen to one of my
  bandages."</p>

  <p>Katharine nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of Nurse Lynn," she observed. "But really I am very
  careful."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," the doctor acknowledged, "but so long as I am here,
  with nothing else to do and a very heavy fee if by any chance I bring my man
  through, I may just as well see to these things myself. At any moment I might
  need your help, and I am very happy, Miss Beverley, to think that I shall
  have some one like you to fall back upon. My great hope," he went on, "is
  that we may get him across without a touch of the angina."</p>

  <p>"Will he ever get well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"One can never tell," he said. "It is just one of these cases which are
  very close to the borderland. With luck he may pull through, may even become
  a fairly strong man again, but he doesn't look as though he had much of a
  physique. Sometime or other the day will come when life or death for him will
  depend entirely upon his will."</p>

  <p>She nodded and moved away. "My stateroom is just opposite, if you want me
  at any time, doctor," she said.</p>

  <p>He bowed and closed the door after her. Katharine made her way into her
  cabin, sat on her steamer trunk and looked around a little helplessly. The
  confusion of thought in which she had come on board was only increased by
  this introduction to doctor and patient. A presentiment of strange and
  imminent happenings kept her seated there long after the dressing bugle had
  sounded.</p>

  <p>The <i>City of Boston</i> was four hours out of harbour, with her course
  set direct for Liverpool. The passengers, of whom there were only a very
  moderate number, had taken possession of their staterooms, examined their
  lifebelts, eaten their first meal, and were now, at eight o'clock on a fine
  June evening, mostly strolling about the deck or reclining in steamer chairs.
  There was none of the old-time feeling that a six-days' holiday was before
  them, a six-days' freedom from all anxiety and care. Even in these first few
  hours of their enterprise a certain strain of suppressed excitement was
  almost universally noticeable. There was no escaping from grim facts, and the
  facts were brought home to them all the time by those two businesslike
  destroyers flying the Stars and Stripes, and whose decks were swept
  continually by a deluge of green salt water. Amongst the few people who
  conversed there was but one subject of conversation, a subject which every
  one affected to treat lightly, and yet which no one managed to discuss
  without signs of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"This thing will get on all our nerves before we are over," Brand, a
  breezy newspaper man from the West, observed. "What with boat drill three
  times a day, and lifebelt parade going on all the time on the deck, one
  doesn't get a chance to forget that we are liable to get a torpedo in our
  side at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, these little gnats of Uncle Sam's will look after us!" a more
  cheerful <i>confr&egrave;re</i> observed. "Come into the smoking room and
  I'll buy you a drink."</p>

  <p>A good deal of courage seemed to be sought in that direction, and
  presently, although the afterglow of the sunset was still brilliant, the
  decks were almost deserted. On the starboard side, only a man and a woman
  remained, and gradually, as though with a certain unwillingness, they drifted
  closer together. The woman, who wore a black and white check coat over her
  blue serge steamer dress, and a small black hat from which she had pushed
  back the veil, was leaning over the side of the steamer, her head supported
  by her hand, looking steadily into the mass of red and orange clouds. The
  man, who was smoking a cigar, with both hands in his ulster pockets, seemed
  as though he would have passed her, but without turning her head she held out
  her hand and beckoned him to her side.</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to wonder whether you were an absentee," Katharine
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have been making friends with the captain," Jocelyn Thew replied.</p>

  <p>"Please arrange my chair," she begged. "I should like to sit down."</p>

  <p>He did as he was asked, arranging her rugs with the care of an old
  traveler. All his movements were very deliberate, even the searching way in
  which his eyes swept the long row of empty chairs on either side of them, and
  the care with which he fastened two open portholes above their heads. Finally
  he accepted her invitation and sat by her side.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you once before," she observed, "just before we started."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"You were standing on the upper deck," she continued, "a little away from
  the others. You had your glasses glued to your eyes and you watched the dock.
  You had the air of one looking for a late arrival. Do you know of any one who
  has missed the boat?"</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>"A friend?"</p>

  <p>"No, an enemy," he answered equably.</p>

  <p>She turned her head a little. It was obvious that he was speaking the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"So you have enemies?"</p>

  <p>"A great many," he acknowledged, "one in particular just now. Perhaps," he
  went on, "I should say an opponent."</p>

  <p>"If that is so," she remarked, after a moment's pause, "you should be glad
  that he missed the boat."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am," he admitted. "It was part of my plan that he should miss it."</p>

  <p>She moved uneasily in her chair.</p>

  <p>"So you haven't finished with adventures yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not just yet."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Then she turned her head a little, leaning it
  still on the back of the chair but watching him as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I have seen my patient," she told him. "I have also had some conversation
  with the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to think," she continued, "that you must be a
  philanthropist."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You hinted," she went on, "that your friend was in poor circumstances.
  You did not tell me, though, that you were paying the whole expenses of this
  trip, just so that the man should see his home and his family before he
  died."</p>

  <p>"I told you that the care of him was a charge upon me," Jocelyn Thew
  reminded her. "That amounts to the same thing, doesn't it? I was clever
  enough, anyhow, to get a good nurse at a small fee."</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure," she replied, "that I shall not charge you
  something outrageous. You are probably a millionaire."</p>

  <p>"Whatever you charge me," he promised, "I shall try to pay."</p>

  <p>The two journalists, refreshed and encouraged by their libation, strolled
  past arm in arm.</p>

  <p>"Queer sort of voyage, this, for a man on the point of death," the
  Westerner observed. "They brought a chap on here, an hour before we sailed,
  in an ambulance, with a doctor and a hospital nurse. Had to be carried every
  foot of the way."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with him?" the other enquired.</p>

  <p>"He was only operated upon for appendicitis a fortnight ago, and they say
  that he has angina pectoris amongst other complications. They brought him
  straight from the hospital. Seems he's crazy to get back to England to
  die."</p>

  <p>The two men passed out of hearing. Jocelyn flicked the ash from the
  cigarette which he had lighted.</p>

  <p>"Sounds a queer sort of story, the way they tell it," he observed,
  glancing at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," she replied. "Men have done this sort of thing
  before&mdash;but it isn't often," she went on, "that a man has done it for
  the sake of another man."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"You have the old-fashioned idea of man's devotion to woman. Can't you
  believe that there may be ties between two men stronger even than between a
  man and the woman he loves?"</p>

  <p>"I can believe that," she assented, "but the men must have something in
  common. I should find it hard to believe, for instance, that they existed
  between you and the man downstairs."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders very slightly.</p>

  <p>"You forget," he observed, "that a man does not look at his best after
  such an illness as Phillips has had. You find him, perhaps, a little
  insignificant. You are probably aware of his vocation and station in
  life."</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"And these things," he went on, "make it difficult for you to believe that
  there is any great tie between us two. Yet it is the exception which proves
  the rule, you know. I will not say that your patient has ever saved my life
  or performed any immortal action, yet believe me he has courage and a grit
  you would scarcely believe in, and I am speaking seriously when I tell you
  that not only I but others are under deep obligations to him."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet with the air of one who has closed the subject.
  Katharine also threw off her rugs.</p>

  <p>"You are going to walk?" she asked. "Please take me with you. I don't know
  why, but I feel restless this evening."</p>

  <p>They paced side by side up and down the deck, pausing now and then to
  watch the destroyers and indulging in a very spasmodic conversation. At their
  fourth promenade, as they reached the stern extremity of their deck, the
  woman paused, and, holding to the railing with one hand, looked steadily back
  towards New York. The colour was fading slowly from the sky now, but it was
  still marvellously clear.</p>

  <p>"Are you homesick for what lies beneath those clouds?" he enquired
  lightly.</p>

  <p>She took no immediate account of his words. Her eyes were fixed upon one
  spot in that distant curtain of sky. Suddenly she pointed with her
  finger.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" she asked. "No, the mast's dipping now&mdash;you can't see.
  There&mdash;the other side."</p>

  <p>He followed her outstretched finger, and slowly his fine black eyebrows
  grew closer and closer together. Far away, at a certain spot in the clear
  evening sky, was a little speck of black, hidden every now and then by the
  mast of the ship as she rolled, but distinctly there all the time, a little
  smudge in an amber setting, too small for a cloud, yet a visible and tangible
  object. Katharine felt her companion's arm tighten upon hers, and she saw his
  face grow like a piece of marble.</p>

  <p>"It's a seaplane," he muttered, "coming from the New Jersey coast."</p>

  <p>Through that mysterious agency by means of which news travels on board
  ship as though supernaturally conveyed, the deck was crowded in a very few
  moments by practically every passenger and most of the officers. Every form
  of telescope and field-glass was directed towards the now clearly visible
  seaplane. Speculations were everywhere to be heard.</p>

  <p>"Come to warn us of a submarine," was the first suggestion.</p>

  <p>"They'd use the wireless," was the prompt reminder.</p>

  <p>"But seaplanes can spot the submarines under the sea," one of the
  journalists reminded the bystanders. "They're a better escort than any
  destroyer."</p>

  <p>"She can't come all the way across the Atlantic, though," Brand
  observed.</p>

  <p>"It's some new device of Uncle Sam's they are testing, perhaps," his
  friend suggested. "Gee! You can hear her now quite plainly. There are two of
  them in the car&mdash;a pilot and an observer. Wonder what the captain thinks
  about it."</p>

  <p>The captain on the bridge was talking to his chief officer. Fragments of
  their conversation were apparently overheard, for it was soon rumoured around
  that the captain had expressed his opinion that this was simply part of some
  maneuvres they were carrying out from the New Jersey Aviation Station.
  Jocelyn Thew watched the blue fire about the mast.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether that's she talking to us," he observed. "One would have
  to be pretty nippy with one's fingers to work aboard on one of those small
  things."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose she is bringing us a message?" Katharine asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"They could do that by wireless from the shore," he replied. "Hullo, we're
  slowing down!"</p>

  <p>The little crowd was now bubbling over with excitement. The speed of the
  steamer had, without a doubt, been slackened, and a boat was being lowered.
  Brand and his companion, immensely happy, were already dotting down their
  notes for the wireless. The seaplane was gently skimming the water almost
  alongside, and barely fifty yards away. The pilot and his companion were
  clearly visible. The passengers lined the whole length of the steamer,
  leaning over to watch the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of this strange scene.</p>

  <p>"It's a newspaper scoop," one man suggested.</p>

  <p>The idea was not favourably entertained.</p>

  <p>"No newspaper would be allowed to make use of a Government seaplane,"
  Brand pointed out. "Apart from that, they wouldn't dare to stop a steamer out
  here."</p>

  <p>"There's the boat!" some one else exclaimed, pointing to one of the ship's
  lifeboats which had shot out towards the plane. "She must be going to pick
  one of the men up!"</p>

  <p>The steamer was merely drifting now, and its strange visitor had alighted
  upon the water, rushing along a little way in front and leaving two long,
  milky paths of white foam behind. Both the pilot and the passenger were
  drenched by every wave. They watched the latter as he was taken off, and
  their eyes followed the return of the lifeboat. Almost immediately afterwards
  the plane, increasing its speed, rushed across the surface of the water and
  rose again.</p>

  <p>"Prettiest sight I ever saw in my life," Brand declared
  enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"We live in wonderful times," his friend agreed, looking longingly at the
  wireless office. "I guess we must get a look at this chap, anyway," he added.
  "He's the first man who has overtaken an American liner so far from land like
  this before."</p>

  <p>The man who clambered a few minutes later up the ladder of the steamer had
  not the appearance of one who has performed a heroic action. His clothes had
  shrunk upon his body, and the sea water was oozing from him in all
  directions. His face was blue with cold and almost unrecognisable.
  Nevertheless, Jocelyn Thew, who was one of the most eager of the sightseers,
  attained a certain measure of conviction as he shut up his glasses with a
  snap and turned to his companion.</p>

  <p>"An Englishman," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I can't go so far as that," he admitted, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he was the man for whom you were looking before the steamer started,"
  she declared confidently.</p>

  <p>"Seems a little rough luck to be caught up like this out in the ocean," he
  grumbled. "I don't know that the man's likely to do me any particular harm,"
  he added, "but I'd just as soon he wasn't on board."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the captain had hurried his belated passenger into his room,
  and the ship saw no more of him that night. By degrees the excitement
  simmered down. Jocelyn escorted his companion to the gangway and bade her
  good night.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure," she protested, "that I am ready to go down
  yet."</p>

  <p>"You must show a little interest in your patient," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"But the doctor has already as good as told me to keep away."</p>

  <p>"Gant is a peculiar fellow," he told her. "By this time he has probably
  changed his mind and needs your help. Besides, I am anxious to hear what they
  say in the smoking room concerning this extraordinary visitor."</p>

  <p>She looked around. They were absolutely alone.</p>

  <p>"Who is he," she asked, "and what does his coming mean to you?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Crawshay," Jocelyn replied. "He is an ex-Scotland Yard man
  who came over here to work for the English Secret Service."</p>

  <p>"What does he want here?" she whispered, a little hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn raised his cap as he turned away.</p>

  <p>"Me," he answered. "He'll probably be disappointed, though."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay found himself a popular hero when at a few minutes
  before eleven o'clock the next morning he made his appearance on deck. With
  little regard to the weather, which was fine and warm, he was clad in a thick
  grey suit and a voluminous overcoat. The fact that his borrowed hat was
  several sizes too large for him detracted a little from the dignity of his
  appearance, a misfortune for which he endeavoured to atone by a distinct
  aloofness of manner. The newspaper men, however, were not to be denied.</p>

  <p>"Say, Mr. Crawshay," Brand began, stopping him as soon as he had emerged
  from the companionway, "I'd like to shake hands with you. My name's Brand.
  I'm a newspaper man."</p>

  <p>Crawshay shook hands, although he showed no particular enthusiasm about
  the proceeding.</p>

  <p>"And I am Clark, of the Minneapolis <i>Record</i>" the small, dark man,
  who was generally by Brand's side, added. "Put it there, sir."</p>

  <p>Crawshay put it there with an incipient reluctance which the two men were
  not slow to note.</p>

  <p>"Kind of shock to you yesterday, no doubt," Brand began. "It was a fine,
  plucky thing to do, sir. Ever flown before?"</p>

  <p>"Never," Crawshay confessed. "The sensation was&mdash;er&mdash;entirely
  new to me. I found the descent upon the water most uncomfortable." "Soaked
  your shore clothes, eh?" Brand observed.</p>

  <p>"I was not attired for the proceeding," Crawshay admitted. "I was, in
  fact, very inappropriately dressed. I was wearing a thin flannel suit, which
  was completely ruined, and I do not think that I shall ever be warm
  again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brand glanced longingly at his wrist watch and sighed.</p>

  <p>"I make it a rule, sir," he said, "never to drink before twelve o'clock,
  but there is no rule without an exception. If you think that a double jigger
  of gin, with a little lemon and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Crawshay begged. "I have no sympathy with the weird compounds
  produced by your bartenders. As a matter of fact, I take nothing at all
  except with my meals. I am going to sit in this sunshine and try and recover
  my normal temperature."</p>

  <p>"There are a few of the boys on board," Brand continued insinuatingly,
  "who would like to join in our little chat, if you wouldn't mind their
  stepping round."</p>

  <p>"I have no desire for a chat with any one," Crawshay objected. "I came up
  on deck to rest. Kindly ask me what you want to know and leave me alone for a
  time."</p>

  <p>"Then what in thunder sent you here after an American liner on a
  seaplane?" Brand demanded. "That's about the long and short of what we're
  aching to know, I think."</p>

  <p>"You've hit it, Ned, as usual," Mr. Clark, of the Minneapolis
  <i>Record</i>, acquiesced. Crawshay drew his rug about him a little
  peevishly.</p>

  <p>"My name," he said, "is Charles Reginald Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"We got that from the captain," Brand replied. "Very nice name, too."</p>

  <p>"I have been attached," Crawshay went on, "to the British Embassy at
  Washington."</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" Brand murmured.</p>

  <p>"I am returning home," Crawshay continued, "because I intend to join the
  British Army, I was unfortunate enough to miss the boat, and being in company
  with a person of authority and influence, he suggested, partly in joke, that
  I should try to persuade one of the pilots of your new seaplanes at Jersey to
  bring me out. He further bet me five hundred dollars that I would not attempt
  the flight. I am one of those sort of people," Crawshay confessed
  meditatively, "who rise to a bet as to no other thing in life. I suppose it
  comes from our inherited sporting instincts. I accepted the bet and here I
  am."</p>

  <p>"In time to save the British Army, eh?" Brand observed.</p>

  <p>"In time to take my rightful place amongst the defenders of my country,"
  was the dignified rebuke. "Incidentally, I have won a hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"Would you do it again for the same money?" Clark asked guilefully.</p>

  <p>The Englishman coughed.</p>

  <p>"I must confess," he said, "that it is not an experience I am anxious to
  repeat."</p>

  <p>Brand rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he concluded, "I offer you my congratulations on your trip.
  We shall just dot a few words together concerning it for the New York
  newspapers. Anything you'd like to add?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay stroked his upper lip.</p>

  <p>"You can say," he pronounced with dignity, "that I found the trip most
  enjoyable. And by-the-by, you had better put a word in about the skill of the
  pilot&mdash;Lieutenant T. Johnson, I believe his name was. I have no
  experience in such matters, and I found him once or twice a little
  unsympathetic when I complained of bumps, but the young man did his
  best&mdash;of that I am convinced."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brand's tongue slowly crept round the outside of his mouth. He met the
  eye of his friend Mr. Clark and indulged in a wink. He had the air of a man
  who felt relieved by the operation.</p>

  <p>"We are very much obliged to you, Mr. Crawshay," he declared. "You have
  done something to brighten this trip, anyway."</p>

  <p>"A little later," Crawshay announced, "either just before your luncheon or
  dinner hour, if you and your friends would meet me in the smoking room, I
  should be delighted to remember in the customary fashion that I have won a
  rather considerable wager."</p>

  <p>"Come, that's bully," Brand declared, with a little real feeling in his
  tone. "I tell you, Clark," he added, as they made their way along the deck to
  the writing room, "you've got to prick these damned Britishers pretty hard,
  but they've generally got a bit of the right feeling somewhere tucked away.
  He'll have a swollen head for the rest of this voyage, though." Crawshay
  watched the two men disappear, out of the corner of his eye. Then he rose to
  his feet and commenced a little promenade about the sunny portion of the
  deck. After two or three turns he found himself face to face with Jocelyn
  Thew, who had just issued from the companionway.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Late Passenger!" the latter exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Crawshay paused and looked him up and down.</p>

  <p>"Do I know you, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure that you do," Jocelyn replied, "but after yesterday the
  whole world knows Mr. Reginald Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you, I am sure," Crawshay murmured. "What I did really
  wasn't worth making a fuss about."</p>

  <p>"You had an uncomfortable ride, I fear?" Jocelyn continued.</p>

  <p>"I was most unsuitably attired," Crawshay hastened to explain. "If,
  instead of asking me very absurd questions at the aerodrome, they had
  provided me with some garments calculated to exclude the salt water, I should
  be able to look back upon the trip with more pleasurable feelings."</p>

  <p>"Pity you had to make it, wasn't it?" Jocelyn observed, falling into step
  with him.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely follow you, Mr.&mdash;Ought I to know your name? I have a
  shocking memory."</p>

  <p>"My name is Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jocelyn Thew," Crawshay concluded.</p>

  <p>"I mean that it was a pity you missed the boat, you and Hobson, wasn't it?
  What was the weather like in Chicago?" "Hot," Crawshay replied. "I was hotter
  there than I ever expect to be again in this world."</p>

  <p>"A long, tiring journey, too, from Halifax."</p>

  <p>"Not only that, sir," Crawshay agreed, "but a dirty journey. I like to
  travel with the windows down&mdash;cold water and fresh air, you know, for us
  English people&mdash;but the soft coal you burn in your engines is the most
  appalling uncleanly stuff I have ever met."</p>

  <p>"Still, you got here," Jocelyn reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I got here," Crawshay agreed with an air of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"And you can take a bath three times a day, if you feel like it, on
  board," Jocelyn continued. "I'm afraid you won't find much else to do."</p>

  <p>"One can never tell," Crawshay sighed. "I have started on ocean trips
  sometimes which promised absolutely nothing in the way of entertainment, and
  I have discovered myself, before the end of the journey, thoroughly
  interested and amused."</p>

  <p>"Nothing like looking on the bright side of things," Jocelyn observed.</p>

  <p>Crawshay turned his head and contemplated his companion for a few moments.
  Jocelyn Thew, notwithstanding his fine, slim figure, his well-cut clothes and
  lean, handsome face, carried always with him some nameless, unanalysable air
  of the man who has played the explorer, who has peered into strange places,
  who has handled the reins which guide the white horse of life as well as the
  black horse of death.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure," he said, in a tone of kindly approval, "that I shall
  find you a most interesting companion on this trip. You and I must have a
  little further conversation together. I have won a considerable sum of money,
  I may say, by my&mdash;er&mdash;exploit, and I have invited some of these
  newspaper fellows to take a drink with me before luncheon in the smoking
  room. I hope you will join us?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," Jocelyn accepted. "A drink with a friend, and a
  little mutual toast, is always a pleasure."</p>

  <p>Crawshay paused. They were standing outside the entrance to the captain's
  cabin.</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," he said. "Exercise your ingenuity, Mr. Jocelyn
  Thew, and think out a toast that we can both drink sincerely. You will excuse
  me? I am going in to talk to the captain for a few minutes. There are a few
  matters concerning my personal comfort which need his attention. I find the
  purser," he added, dropping his voice, "an excellent fellow, no doubt, but
  just a trifle unsympathetic, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt you are right," Jocelyn agreed. "We will meet again,
  then, just before one o'clock."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay knocked at the door of the captain's room, received
  a stentorian invitation to enter, and sank a little plaintively into a vacant
  easy-chair. The purser, who had been in close confabulation with his chief,
  hastily took his leave.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, sir," the visitor said languidly.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Crawshay," the captain replied. "Feeling a little
  stronger this morning, I hope?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay sighed.</p>

  <p>"The memory of that experience," he began, settling down in his
  chair,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well, well, you ought to have got over that by this time," the captain
  interrupted. "What can I do for you, Mr. Crawshay? I have been yarning with
  the purser a little longer than usual, this morning, and I have some rounds
  to do."</p>

  <p>"I must not stand in the way of your daily avocation," the newcomer said
  gloomily. "I really dropped in chiefly to see if by any chance you had had a
  wireless message about me."</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>"No message, eh? Now, do you know, that seems to me exceedingly strange,"
  Crawshay ruminated.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why it should," was the somewhat brusque reply. "I have no
  doubt that the New York papers have some wonderful headlines&mdash;'How an
  Englishman catches the steamer!' or 'An English diplomatist, eager to
  fight'&mdash;and all that sort of thing. But apart from the spectacular side
  of it, I don't suppose they consider your adventure of national
  interest."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, it is the development of a new era," Crawshay replied,
  with dignity. "Just consider what actually happened. I miss the steamer,
  owing to the breakdown of the Chicago Limited and a subsequent automobile
  accident. I arrive at the dock whilst you are in the shadow of the Statue of
  Liberty. What do I do? What no one else has ever done before! I fly after
  you! Romance has never pictured such a thing. I am a pioneer, Captain."</p>

  <p>The Captain grinned.</p>

  <p>"You've been pretty sorry for yourself ever since," he observed.</p>

  <p>"I must confess that I made up my mind to the heroic deed in a rash
  moment," Crawshay acknowledged. "I am a person of strong and unconquerable
  impulses. You see, that exceedingly disagreeable American policeman who was
  sent up to Halifax on a fool's errand with me, and who subsequently led me on
  another to Chicago, bet me five hundred dollars, as we stood upon the dock,
  that I couldn't catch that steamer. Now if there is one thing," he went on,
  crossing his legs, "which excites my interest more than another, it is a
  bet."</p>

  <p>"That and your accent," the captain said, smiling, "are two of your most
  prominent British traits, Mr. Crawshay." The latter took out his eyeglass and
  polished it.</p>

  <p>"I have others," he retorted, "but never mind. I understood you to say, I
  think, that you have heard nothing by wireless about me?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>The captain glanced at his clock and showed some signs of impatience. His
  visitor, however, remained blandly imperturbable.</p>

  <p>"I see that you have only one operator in the wireless room," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I happened to be walking by last night, and I glanced in."</p>

  <p>"We are short-handed," the captain explained.</p>

  <p>"Quite naturally," Crawshay replied. "Now with reference to this young
  man, I watched him coming down the steps from his office this morning. You
  may be surprised to hear, Captain, that I found him unprepossessing&mdash;in
  fact I might almost say that I took a dislike to him."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he would be very much disturbed if he knew your opinion," was
  the faintly sarcastic reply. "He happens to be a young man with exceptionally
  good credentials."</p>

  <p>"Credentials," Crawshay observed blandly, "in which I have no
  faith&mdash;no faith whatever."</p>

  <p>The captain turned his head suddenly. There was a new expression in his
  face as he looked keenly at his visitor.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Mr. Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. I see you have been smoking a pipe, Captain. You will
  forgive me if I light one of these perfectly damnable cigarettes which are
  all I have been able to buy on board.&mdash;Thank you.&mdash;I talk better
  when I smoke."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that you talk a great deal of nonsense," the captain
  declared bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Intermingled at times," the other insisted, "with a word or two of sense.
  Now I am going to repeat that I have very little faith in this wireless
  operator of yours. At three o'clock this morning&mdash;I don't wish to tie
  myself down, Captain, so I will say in the vicinity of that hour&mdash;he
  received a message&mdash;a long one, I should imagine. I put it to you,
  sir&mdash;was that dispatch for you?"</p>

  <p>"No," the captain admitted, "I had no message at that hour or since."</p>

  <p>"Very-well, then," Crawshay continued, loosening a little muffler at his
  throat, "I suppose you can ascertain from the purser if any message was
  delivered to any one of your passengers?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly can," the captain admitted, "but to tell you the truth, sir,
  I scarcely see how this concerns you."</p>

  <p>"I am endeavouring," his visitor replied, with a little wave of his hand,
  "to justify my statement. Enquire of the purser, I beg you. It will do no
  harm."</p>

  <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders, touched the bell and despatched his
  steward for Mr. Dix, the purser, who, happening to be on the deck outside,
  made an immediate appearance.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dix," the captain asked him, "can you tell me if you have received
  any wireless message intended for any one of the passengers at or since three
  o'clock this morning?" "Not one, sir."</p>

  <p>Crawshay's smile was beatific and triumphant. He relit his cigarette which
  had gone out, and, crossing his legs, made himself a little more
  comfortable.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," he said, "what I should like to know is, what became of
  that message which made very pretty illuminations around your conductor, or
  whatever you call it, for at least a quarter of an hour this morning?"</p>

  <p>"The message may merely have been an intercepted one," the purser pointed
  out. "It may not have been fur us at all."</p>

  <p>"I had an idea," Crawshay persisted, with bland and officious precision,
  "that even intercepted messages, especially in time of war, were referred to
  some person of authority on board. Apart from that, however, the message I
  refer to was written down and delivered to one of your passengers. I happened
  to see your operator leave his office with an envelope in his hand."</p>

  <p>"At three o'clock in the morning?" the captain observed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"At about a quarter of an hour past that time," the other assented.</p>

  <p>"And what on earth were you doing about on deck?"</p>

  <p>"I have strange habits," Crawshay confessed. "On board ship I indulge
  them. I like to sleep when I feel like it, and to wander about when I feel
  inclined. After my extraordinary, my remarkable experience of yesterday, I
  was not disposed for slumber." "It appears to me, sir," the purser
  intervened, "that on board this ship you seem to do a great deal of walking
  about, considering you have only been with us for a little more than twelve
  hours."</p>

  <p>"Liver," Crawshay explained confidentially. "I suffer intensely from my
  liver. Gentle and continual exercise is my greatest help."</p>

  <p>The captain turned towards his junior officer.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dix," he suggested, "perhaps it will clear this little matter up if
  we send for Robins. You might just step out yourself and bring him
  round."</p>

  <p>Crawshay extended an eager hand.</p>

  <p>"I beg that you will do nothing of the sort," he pleaded.</p>

  <p>"But why not?" the captain demanded. "You have made a definite charge
  against a wireless operator on the ship. He ought to be placed in the
  position to be able to refute it if he can."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt," Crawshay agreed, "that in course of time he will be
  given that opportunity. At present it would be indiscreet."</p>

  <p>"And why?"</p>

  <p>"Because there will be other messages, and one is driven to the conclusion
  that it would be exceedingly interesting to lay hands on one of these
  messages, no record of which is kept, of which the purser is not informed,
  and which are delivered secretly to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, to whom?" the captain demanded.</p>

  <p>"To a passenger on board this steamer."</p>

  <p>The captain shook his head. His whole expression was one of
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" he exclaimed. "If Robins has failed in his duty, which I still
  take the liberty of doubting, I must cross-question him at once."</p>

  <p>Crawshay assumed the air of a pained invalid whose wishes have been
  thwarted.</p>

  <p>"You must really oblige me by doing nothing of the sort," he begged. "I am
  sure that my way is best. Besides, you make me feel like an
  eavesdropper&mdash;a common informer, and that sort of thing, you know."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I cannot allow any question of sentiment to stand
  between me and the discipline of my ship," was the somewhat uncompromising
  reply.</p>

  <p>Crawshay sighed, and with languid fingers unbuttoned his overcoat and
  coat. Then, from some mysterious place in the neighbourhood of his breast
  pocket, he produced an envelope containing a single half-sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"Read that, sir, if you please," he begged.</p>

  <p>The captain accepted the envelope with some reluctance, straightened out
  its contents, read the few words it contained several times, and handed back
  the missive. He stood for a moment like a man in a dream. Crawshay returned
  the envelope to his pocket and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be getting along," he observed. "We'll have another little
  chat, Captain, later on. I must take my matutinal stroll, or I know how I
  shall feel about luncheon time. Besides, there are some exuberant persons on
  board who are expecting me to offer them refreshment about one o'clock, out
  of my winnings, and, attached to your wonderful country as I am, Captain, I
  must admit that cocktails do not agree with me." "One has to get used to
  them," the captain murmured absently.</p>

  <p>"I am most unfortunate, too, in the size of my feet," Crawshay continued
  dolefully, looking down at them. "If there is one thing I thoroughly dislike,
  it is being on board ship without rubber overshoes&mdash;a product of your
  country, Captain, which I must confess that I appreciate more than your
  cocktails. Good morning, sir. I hope I haven't kept you from your rounds.
  Dear me!" he added, in a tone of vexation, as he passed through the door, "I
  believe that I have been sitting in a draught all the time. I feel quite
  shivery."</p>

  <p>He shambled down the deck. The purser lingered behind with an enquiring
  expression in his eyes, but his chief did not take the hint.</p>

  <p>"Dix," he said solemnly, as he put on his cap and started out on his
  rounds, "I was right. This is going to be a very queer voyage indeed!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay walked slowly along the deck until he found a
  completely sheltered spot. Then he summoned the deck steward and
  superintended the arrangement of his deck chair, which was almost hidden
  under a heap of rugs. He had just adjusted a pair of spectacles and was
  preparing to settle down when Katharine, in her nurse's uniform, issued from
  the companionway and stood for a moment looking about her. Crawshay at once
  raised his cap.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Beverley," he said. "You do not recognise me, of
  course, but my name is Crawshay. I had the pleasure of meeting you once at
  Washington."</p>

  <p>"I remember you quite well, Mr. Crawshay," she replied, glancing with some
  amusement at his muffled-up state. "Besides, you must remember that you are
  the hero of the ship. I suppose I ought to congratulate you upon your
  wonderful descent upon us yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Pray don't mention it," Crawshay murmured. "The chance just came my way.
  I&mdash;er&mdash;" he went on, gazing hard at her uniform, "I was not aware
  that you were personally interested in nursing."</p>

  <p>"That shows how little you know about me, Mr. Crawshay." "I have heard,"
  he admitted, "of your wonderful deeds of philanthropy, also that you entirely
  support a large hospital in New York, but I had no idea that you interested
  yourself personally in the&mdash;er&mdash;may I say most feminine and
  charming avocation of nursing?"</p>

  <p>"I have been a probationer," she told him, "in my own hospital, and I am
  at the present moment in attendance upon a patient on board this
  steamer."</p>

  <p>"You amaze me!" he exclaimed. "You&mdash;did I understand you to say that
  you were in personal attendance upon a patient?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, Mr. Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, forgive my astonishment," he continued. "I had no idea. At
  any rate I am glad that your patient's state of health permits you to leave
  him for a time."</p>

  <p>Her expression became a little graver.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," she sighed, "my patient is very ill indeed, I am
  afraid. However, the doctor shares the responsibility with me, and he is
  staying with him now for half an hour."</p>

  <p>"May I, in that case," he begged, "share your promenade?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," she acquiesced, without enthusiasm. "You will have to
  take off some of your coats, though."</p>

  <p>"I am suffering from chill," he explained. "I sometimes think that I shall
  never be warm again, after my experience of yesterday."</p>

  <p>He divested himself, however, of his outside coat, arranged his muffler
  carefully, thrust his hands into his pockets, and fell into step by her side.
  "I am interested," he observed, "in illness. What exactly is the matter with
  your charge?"</p>

  <p>"He has had a bad operation," she replied, "and there are
  complications."</p>

  <p>"Dear me! Dear me!" Crawshay exclaimed, in a shocked tone. "And in such a
  state he chooses to make a perilous voyage like this?"</p>

  <p>"That is rather his affair, is it not?" she said drily.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," her companion agreed. "Precisely! I should not, perhaps, have
  made the remark. Sickness, however, interests me very much. I have the
  misfortune not to be strong myself, and my own ailments occupy a good deal of
  my attention."</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"You suffer from nerves, don't you?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Hideously," he assented.</p>

  <p>"And yet," she continued, still watching him in a puzzled fashion, "you
  made that extraordinary voyage through the air to catch this steamer. That
  doesn't seem to me to be at all the sort of thing a nervous person would
  do."</p>

  <p>"It was for a bet," he explained confidentially. "The only occasion upon
  which I forget my nerves is when there is a bet to be lost or won. At the
  time," he went on, "my deportment was, I think, all that could have been
  desired. The sensations of which I was undoubtedly conscious I contrived to
  adequately conceal. The after-shock, however, has, I must admit, been
  considerable."</p>

  <p>"Was it really so terribly important," she enquired, "that you should be
  in London next week?"</p>

  <p>"The War Office made a special point of it," he assured her. "Got to join
  up, you know, directly I arrive."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," she enquired after a brief pause, "that you will enjoy
  soldiering better than pseudo-diplomacy? I don't exactly know how to refer to
  your work. I only remember that when we were introduced I was told that you
  had something to do with the Secret Service."</p>

  <p>They were leaning over the side of the steamer, and she glanced curiously
  at his long, rather sunken face, at the uncertain mouth, and at the eyes,
  carefully concealed behind a pair of green spectacles. He seemed, somehow, to
  have aged since they had first met, a year ago, in Washington.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," he confided, "I am a little tired of my job.
  Neither fish nor fowl, don't you know. I took an observation course at
  Scotland Yard, but I suppose I am too slow-witted for what they call
  secret-service work over here."</p>

  <p>"America wouldn't provide you with many opportunities, would it?" she
  observed.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," he replied. "I am much more at home upon the
  Continent. The Secret Service in America, as we understand it, does not
  exist. One finds oneself continually in collaboration with police inspectors,
  and people who naturally do not understand one's point of view. At any rate,"
  he concluded, with a little sigh, "if I have any talents, they haven't come
  to the front in Washington. I don't believe that dear old Sir Richard was at
  all sorry to see the last of me." "And you think you will prefer your new
  profession?"</p>

  <p>"Soldiering? Well, I shall have to train up a bit and see. Beastly ugly
  work they seem to make of it, nowadays. I don't mind roughing it up to the
  extent of my capacity, but I do think that the advice of one's medical man
  should be taken into consideration."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him openly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said, "I can't picture you campaigning in France!"</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth I can't picture it myself," he confessed frankly.
  "The stories I have heard with reference to the absence of physical comforts
  are something appalling. By-the-by," he went on, as though the idea had
  suddenly occurred to him, "I can't think how your patient can rest, anyhow,
  after an operation, on beds like there are on this steamer. I call it
  positively disgraceful of the company to impose such mattresses upon their
  patrons. My bones positively ache this morning."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Phillips has his own mattress," she told him, "or rather one of the
  hospital ones. He was carried straight into the ambulance from the ward."</p>

  <p>"Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Phillips," Crawshay repeated. "Have I ever met
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I should think not."</p>

  <p>"He is, of course, a very great friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you should suppose that."</p>

  <p>"Come, come," he remonstrated, "I suppose I am an infernally curious,
  prying sort of chap, but when one thinks of you, a society belle of America,
  you know, and, further, the patroness of that great hospital, crossing the
  Atlantic yourself in charge of a favoured patient, one can't help&mdash;can
  one?"</p>

  <p>"Can one what?" she asked coolly.</p>

  <p>"Scenting a romance or a mystery," he replied. "In any case, Mr. Phillips
  must be a man of some determination, to risk so much just for the sake of
  getting home."</p>

  <p>She turned and recommenced their promenade.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether you realise that it isn't etiquette to question a nurse
  about her patient," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I am very sorry," he assured her. "I didn't imagine that my
  questions were in any way offensive. I told you from the first that I was
  always interested in invalids and cases of illness."</p>

  <p>She turned her head and looked at him. Her glance was reproving, her
  manner impatient.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Crawshay," she said, "I think that you are one of the most
  inquisitive people I ever met."</p>

  <p>"It really isn't inquisitiveness," he protested. "It's just obstinacy. I
  hate to leave a problem unexplained."</p>

  <p>"Then to prevent any further misunderstanding, Mr. Crawshay," she
  concluded, a little coldly, "let me tell you that there are private reasons
  which make any further questioning on your part, concerning this matter,
  impertinent."</p>

  <p>Crawshay lifted his cap. He had the air of a man who has received a rebuff
  which he takes in ill part.</p>

  <p>"I will not risk your further displeasure, Miss Beverley," he said,
  stopping by his steamer chair. "I trust that you will enjoy the remainder of
  your promenade. Good morning!"</p>

  <p>He summoned the deck steward to arrange his rugs, and lay back in his
  steamer chair, eating broth which he loathed, and watching Jocelyn Thew and
  Katharine Beverley through spectacles which somewhat impaired his vision. The
  two had strolled together to the side of the ship to watch a shoal of
  porpoises go by.</p>

  <p>"I see that you are acquainted with our hero of the seaplane," Jocelyn
  Thew remarked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I met him once at Washington and once at the polo games."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you think of him?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," she confessed, "I scarcely know how to think of him. I must say,
  though, that in a general way I should think any profession would suit him
  better than diplomacy."</p>

  <p>"You find him stupid?"</p>

  <p>"I do," she admitted, "and in a particularly British way."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn glanced thoughtfully across at Crawshay, who was contemplating his
  empty cup with apparent regret.</p>

  <p>"You will not think that I am taking a liberty, Miss Beverley, if I ask
  you a question?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I? Is it so very personal?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, it isn't personal at all. I was only going to ask
  you if you would mind telling me what our friend Mr. Crawshay was talking to
  you about just now?" "Are you really interested?" she asked, with an air of
  faint surprise. "Well, if you must know, he was asking questions about my
  patient. He appears to be something of a hypochondriac himself, and he is
  very interested in illnesses."</p>

  <p>"He has the air of one who takes care of himself," Jocelyn observed, with
  a faint smile. "However, one mustn't judge. He may be delicate."</p>

  <p>"I think he is an old woman," she remarked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"He rather gives one that impression, doesn't he?" Jocelyn agreed.
  "By-the-by, there wasn't much you could tell him about your patient, was
  there?"</p>

  <p>"There really isn't anything at all," she replied. "I just mentioned his
  condition, and as Mr. Crawshay still seemed curious, I reminded him that it
  was not etiquette to question a nurse about her patients."</p>

  <p>"Most discreet," Jocelyn declared. "As a matter of fact," he went on, "I
  have scarcely thought it worth while to mention it to you, because I knew
  exactly the sort of answer you would make to any too curious questions, but
  there is a reason, and a very serious reason, why my friend Phillips wishes
  to avoid so far as possible all manner of notice and questions."</p>

  <p>"You call him your friend Phillips," she remarked, "yet you don't seem to
  have been near him since we started."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I intend to," he replied. "That is the other point concerning
  which I wish to speak to you. You may think it very extraordinary, and I
  offer no explanation, but I do not wish it known to&mdash;say, Mr. Crawshay,
  or any other casual enquirer, that I have any acquaintance with or interest
  in Phillips."</p>

  <p>"The subject is dismissed," she promised lightly. "I am not in the least
  an inquisitive person. I understand perfectly, and my lips are sealed."</p>

  <p>His little smile of thanks momentarily transformed his expression. Her
  eyes became softer as they met his.</p>

  <p>"Now please walk with me for a little time," she begged, "and let us leave
  off talking of these grizzly subjects. You've really taken very little notice
  of me so far, and I have been rather looking forward to the voyage. You have
  traveled so much that I am quite sure you could be a most interesting
  companion if you wished to be."</p>

  <p>He obeyed at once, falling easily into step with her, and talking lightly
  enough about the voyage, their fellow passengers, and other trifling
  subjects. Her occasional attempts to lead the conversation into more serious
  channels, even to the subject of his travels, he avoided, however, with a
  curious persistency. Once she stopped short and forced him to look at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jocelyn Thew," she complained, "tell me why you persist in treating
  me like a child?"</p>

  <p>Then for the first time his tone became graver.</p>

  <p>"I want to treat you and think of you," he said, "in the only way that is
  possible for me."</p>

  <p>"Explain, please," she begged.</p>

  <p>He led her again to the side of the ship. The sea had freshened, and the
  spray flew past them like salt diamonds.</p>

  <p>"Since it has pleased you to refer to the subject, Miss Beverley," he said
  seriously, "I will explain so far as I am able. I suppose that I have
  committed nearly every one of the crimes which our abbreviated dictionary of
  modern life enumerates. If the truth were known about me, and I were judged
  by certain prevailing laws, not only my reputation but my life might be in
  serious danger. But there is one crime which I have not committed and which I
  do not intend to commit, one pain which I have avoided all my life myself,
  and avoided inflicting upon others. I think you must know what I refer
  to."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that I do not," she told him frankly. "In any case I
  hate ambiguity. Do please tell me exactly what you mean."</p>

  <p>"I was referring to my attitude towards your sex," he replied.</p>

  <p>There was a faint twinkle in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"That sounds so ponderous," she murmured. "Don't you like us, then?"</p>

  <p>"There are circumstances in my life," he said, "which prevent my even
  considering the subject."</p>

  <p>She turned and looked him full in the eyes. Her very sweet mouth was
  suddenly pathetic, her eyes were full of gentle resentment.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe," she said firmly, "that you have done a single thing in
  life of which you ought to be ashamed. I do not believe one of the hard
  things you have said about yourself. I am not a child. I am a
  woman&mdash;twenty-six years old&mdash;and I like to choose my own friends. I
  should like you to be my friend, Mr. Thew."</p>

  <p>He murmured a few words entirely conventional. Nothing in his expression
  responded in the least to the appeal of her words. His face had grown like
  granite. He turned to the purser, who was strolling by. As though
  unconsciously, the finer qualities of his voice had gone as he engaged the
  latter in some trivial conversation.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That night at dinner time a stranger appeared at the
  captain's table. A dark, thick-browed man, in morning clothes of professional
  cut, was shown by one of the saloon stewards to a seat which had hitherto
  been vacant. Crawshay, whose place was nearly opposite, leaned across at once
  with an air of interest.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Doctor," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, sir," was the somewhat gruff reply.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see that you are able to come in and join us," Crawshay
  continued, unabashed. "You are, I believe, the physician in attendance on Mr.
  Phillips. I am very interested in illnesses. As a matter of fact, I am a
  great invalid myself."</p>

  <p>The doctor contented himself with a muttered monosyllable which was not
  brimful of sympathy.</p>

  <p>"This is a very remarkable expedition of yours," Crawshay went on. "I am a
  man of very little sentiment myself&mdash;one place to me is very much like
  another&mdash;so I do not understand this wild desire on the part of an
  invalid to risk his life by undertaking such a journey. It is a great feat,
  however. It shows what can be accomplished by a man of determination, even
  when he is on the point of death." "Who said that my patient was on the point
  of death?" the doctor demanded brusquely.</p>

  <p>"It is common report," Crawshay assured him. "Besides, as you know, the
  New York press got hold of the story before you started, and the facts were
  in all the evening papers."</p>

  <p>"What facts?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you read them? Most interesting!" Crawshay continued. "They all
  took the same line, and agreed that it was an absolutely unprecedented
  occurrence for a man to embark upon an ocean voyage only a few days after an
  operation for appendicitis, with double pneumonia behind, and angina pectoris
  intervening. Almost as unusual," Crawshay concluded with a little bow, "as
  the fact of his being escorted by the most distinguished amateur nurse in the
  world, and a physician of such distinction as Doctor&mdash;Doctor&mdash;Dear
  me, how extraordinary! For the moment I must confess that your name has
  escaped me."</p>

  <p>The heavy-browed man leaned forward a little deliberately towards his
  <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>. His was not an attractive personality. His features
  were large and of bulldog type. His forehead was low, and his eyes, which
  gave one the impression of being clear and penetrating, were concealed by
  heavy spectacles. His hands only, which were well-shaped and cared for, might
  have indicated his profession.</p>

  <p>"My name," he said, "is Gant&mdash;Doctor James H. Gant. You are not, I
  presume, a medical man yourself?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A most admirable profession," he declared, "but one which I should never
  have the nerve to follow."</p>

  <p>"You do not, therefore, appreciate the fact," Doctor Gant continued, "that
  a medical man, especially one connected with a hospital of such high standing
  as St. Agnes's, does not discuss his patient's ailments with strangers."</p>

  <p>"No offence, Doctor&mdash;no offence," Crawshay protested across the
  table. "Mine is just the natural interest in a fellow sufferer of a man who
  has known most of the ailments to which we weak humans are subject."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, as we have the pleasure of your company this evening," the
  captain intervened, "Miss Beverley will be an absentee?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley at the present moment is taking my place," the doctor
  replied. "She insisted upon it. Personally, I am used to eating at all times
  and in all manner of places."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, during which Crawshay discussed the subject of
  inoculation for colds in the head with his neighbour on the other side, and
  the doctor showed a very formidable capacity for making up for any meals
  which he might have missed by too rigid an attention to his patient. The
  captain presently addressed him again.</p>

  <p>"Have you met our ship's doctor yet?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I have had that honour," Doctor Gant acknowledged. "He was good enough to
  call upon me yesterday and offer his assistance should I require it."</p>

  <p>"A very clever fellow, I believe," the captain observed.</p>

  <p>"He impressed me some," the other confessed. "If any further complications
  should arise, it will be a relief for me to consult him."</p>

  <p>The subject of the sick man dropped. Crawshay walked out of the saloon
  with the captain and left him at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I'll take the liberty of paying you a short call presently, Captain, if I
  may," he said. "I just want to fetch my wraps. And by-the-by, did I tell you
  that I have been fortunate enough to find a pair of rubbers that just fit me,
  at the barber's? One of the greatest blessings on board ship, Captain,
  believe me, is the barber's shop. It's like a bijou Harrod's or
  Whiteley's&mdash;anything you want, from an elephant to a needle, you know.
  In about ten minutes, Captain, if I shan't be disturbing you."</p>

  <p>The captain found the purser on deck and took him into his cabin.</p>

  <p>"I saw you speaking to Doctor Gant in the gangway," the former observed.
  "I wonder what he really thinks about his patient?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can tell you that, sir, without betraying any confidences," the
  purser replied. "Unless a miracle happens, there'll be a burial before we get
  across. Poor fellow, it seems too bad after such an effort."</p>

  <p>The captain nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"After all, I can understand this hankering of a man to die in his own
  country," he said. "I had a brother once the same way. They brought him home
  from Australia, dying all the way, as they believed, but directly he set foot
  in England he seemed to take on a new lease of life&mdash;lived for years
  afterwards." "Is that so?" the purser remarked. "Well, this fellow ought to
  have a chance. It's a short voyage, and he has his own doctor and nurse to
  look after him."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope they'll keep him alive, then. I hate the burial service at
  sea."</p>

  <p>The captain turned aside and filled his pipe thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Dix," he continued, "as you know, I am not a superstitious man, but there
  seems to be something about this trip I can't fathom."</p>

  <p>"Meaning, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there's this wireless business, first of all. We shall close it up
  in about thirty-six hours, you know, and in the meantime I have been
  expecting half a dozen messages, not one of which has come through."</p>

  <p>"Young fellow of the highest character, Robins," the purser remarked
  drily.</p>

  <p>"That may be," the captain agreed, "and yet I can't get rid of my
  premonition. I wouldn't mind laying you anything you like, Dix, that we don't
  sight a submarine, and shouldn't, even if we hadn't our guns trained."</p>

  <p>"That's one comfort, anyway. Being a family man, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about your family, Dix," the captain interrupted
  irritably, "but just at the present moment I am more interested in what is
  going on in my ship. I begin to believe that Mr. Crawshay's voyage through
  the air wasn't altogether a piece of bravado, after all."</p>

  <p>The purser smiled a little incredulously. "He sent round this evening to
  know if I could lend him some flannel pyjamas," he said,&mdash;"says all the
  things that have been collected together for him are too thin. That man makes
  me tired, sir."</p>

  <p>"He makes me wonder."</p>

  <p>"How's that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can't size him up," the captain declared. "There isn't a soul
  on board who isn't laughing at him and saying what a sissy he is. They say he
  has smuggled an extra lifebelt into his cabin, and spends half his time being
  seasick and the other half looking out for submarines."</p>

  <p>"That's the sort of fellow he seems to me, anyway," the purser
  observed.</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I've quite made up my mind," the captain pronounced. "I
  suppose you know, Dix, that he was connected with the Secret Service at the
  English Embassy?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it," Dix replied, "but if he has been, Lord help us! No
  wonder the Germans have got ahead of us every time!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he was much of a success," the other continued, "and as a
  matter of fact he is on his way back to England now to do his bit of
  soldiering. All the same, Dix, he gave me a turn the other day."</p>

  <p>"How's that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Showed me an order, signed by a person I won't name," the captain went
  on, lowering his voice, "requesting me to practically run the ship according
  to his directions&mdash;making him a kind of Almighty boss."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dix opened his lips and closed them again. His eyes were wide open
  with astonishment. There was an indecisive knock at the door, which at a
  gesture from the captain he opened. Wrapped in a huge overcoat, with a cap
  buttoned around his ears and a scarf nearly up to his mouth, Crawshay stood
  there, seeking admittance.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly fortunate to find you both here," the newcomer observed,
  as he removed his cap. "Captain, may I have a few minutes' conversation with
  you and Mr. Dix?"</p>

  <p>"Delighted," the captain acquiesced, "so long as you don't keep me more
  than twenty minutes. I am due on the bridge at nine o'clock."</p>

  <p>"I will endeavour not to be prolix," Crawshay continued, carefully
  removing his rubbers, unfastening his scarf and loosening his overcoat. "A
  damp night! I fear that we may have fog."</p>

  <p>"This all comes off the twenty minutes," the captain reminded him.</p>

  <p>Crawshay smiled appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"Into the heart of things, then! Let me tell you that I suspect a
  conspiracy on board this boat."</p>

  <p>"Of what nature?" the captain asked swiftly.</p>

  <p>"It is my opinion," Crawshay said deliberately, "that the result of the
  whole accumulated work of the German Secret Service, compiled since the
  beginning of the war by means of Secret Service agents, criminals, and
  patriotic Germans and Austrians resident in the States, is upon this
  ship."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" the purser murmured, without reproof from his chief.</p>

  <p>"It was believed," Crawshay continued, "that these documents, together
  with a letter of vital importance, were on the steamer which conveyed the
  personnel of the late German Ambassador to Europe. The steamer was delayed at
  Halifax and a more or less complete search was made. I was present on behalf
  of the English Embassy, but I did not join personally in the search. You have
  all heard that the seals of a tin chest belonging to a neutral country had
  been tampered with. The chiefs of my department, and the head of the American
  Secret Service, firmly believe that the missing papers are in that chest and
  will be discovered when the chest is opened in London. That is not a belief
  which I share."</p>

  <p>"And your reasons, Mr. Crawshay?" the captain asked.</p>

  <p>"First, because Hobson and I were decoyed to Chicago by a bogus telegram,
  evidently with the idea that we should find it impossible to catch or search
  this steamer. Secondly, because there is on board just the one man whom I
  believe capable of conceiving and carrying out a task as difficult as this
  one would be."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" the captain demanded.</p>

  <p>"A very inoffensive, well-mannered and exceedingly well-informed
  individual who is travelling in this steamer under, I believe, his own
  name&mdash;Mr. Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew!" the captain murmured.</p>

  <p>"Thew!" the purser repeated.</p>

  <p>"Now I tell you that I have definite suspicions of this man," Crawshay
  continued, "because I know that for some reason or other he hates England,
  although he has the appearance of being an Englishman. I know that he has
  been friendly with enemy agents in New York, and I know that he has been in
  recent communication with enemy headquarters at Washington. Therefore, as I
  say, I suspect Mr. Jocelyn Thew. I also suspect Robins, the wireless
  operator, because I am convinced that he has received messages of which he
  has taken no record. I now pass on to the remainder of my suspicions, for
  which I frankly admit that I have nothing but surmise. I suspect Mr.
  Phillips, Doctor Gant and Miss Katharine Beverley."</p>

  <p>The last shock proved too much for the captain. For the first time there
  was distinct incredulity in his face.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Crawshay," he protested, "supposing you are right, and
  that you are on the track of a conspiracy, how do you account for a physician
  from the finest hospital in New York and one of the best-known young ladies
  in America being mixed up in it?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay acknowledged the difficulties of the supposition.</p>

  <p>"As regards the physician," he said thoughtfully, "I must confess that I
  am without information concerning him, a fact which increases my suspicion of
  Robins, for I should have had his <i>dossier</i>, and also that of the man
  Phillips, by wireless twenty-four hours ago."</p>

  <p>"What about Miss Beverley then?" the captain enquired. "Her family is not
  only one of the oldest in America, but they are real Puritan, Anglo-Saxon
  stock, white through and through. She has a dozen relatives in Congress, who
  have all been working for war with Germany for the last two years. She also
  has, as she told me herself, a brother and four cousins fighting on the
  French front&mdash;the brother in the Canadian Flying Corps, and the cousins
  in the English Army."</p>

  <p>"There I must confess that you have me," Crawshay admitted. "What you say
  is perfectly true. That is one of the mysteries. No plot would be worth
  solving, you know, if it hadn't a few mysteries in it."</p>

  <p>"If you will allow me a word, Mr. Crawshay," the purser intervened, "I
  think you will have to leave Doctor Gant and his patient and Miss Beverley
  out of your speculations. I have our own ship doctor's word for it that Mr.
  Phillips' condition is exactly as has been stated. Mr. Jocelyn Thew may or
  may not be a suspicious character. Anything you suggest in the way of
  watching him can be done. But as regards the other three, I trust that you
  will not wish their comfort interfered with in any respect."</p>

  <p>"Beyond the search to which every one on board will have to be subjected,"
  Crawshay replied, "I shall not interfere in any respect with the three people
  in question. Mr. Jocelyn Thew, however, is different. He is a man who has led
  a most adventurous life. He seems to have travelled in every part of the
  globe, wherever there was trouble brewing or a little fighting to be
  done."</p>

  <p>"Why do you connect him with the present enterprise?" the captain
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Because," Crawshay answered, "the wireless message of which your man
  Robins took no record, and concerning which you have kept silence at my
  request, was delivered to Mr. Jocelyn Thew. Because, too," he went on, "it is
  my very earnest belief that at somewhere in the small hours of this morning
  there will be another message, and Mr. Jocelyn Thew will be on deck to
  receive it."</p>

  <p>The captain knocked out the ashes of his pipe a little apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"If half what you suspect is true, Mr. Crawshay," he said, "you will
  forgive my saying so, but Jocelyn Thew is not a man you ought to tackle
  without assistance."</p>

  <p>There was a peculiar glitter in Crawshay's deep-set eyes. For a single
  moment a new-born strength seemed to deepen the lines in his face&mdash;a
  transforming change.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry, Captain," he remarked coolly. "I am not taking too
  many chances, and if our friend Mr. Jocelyn Thew should turn out to be the
  man I believe him to be, I would rather tackle him alone."</p>

  <p>"Why," Mr. Dix demanded, "should anything in the shape of violence take
  place? The ship can be searched, every article of baggage ransacked, and
  every passenger made to run the gauntlet."</p>

  <p>Crawshay smiled.</p>

  <p>"The search you speak of is already arranged for, Mr. Dix," he said; "long
  cables from my friend Hobson have already reached Liverpool&mdash;but the
  efficacy of such a proposed search would depend a little, would it not, upon
  whether we reach Liverpool?" "But if we were submarined," the captain pointed
  out, "the papers would go to the bottom."</p>

  <p>Crawshay leaned forward and whispered one word in the captain's ear. The
  latter sat for a moment as though paralysed.</p>

  <p>"What's to prevent that fellow Robins bringing her right on to our track?"
  Crawshay demanded. "That is the reason I spent last night listening for the
  wireless. It's the reason I'm going to do the same to-night."</p>

  <p>The captain sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"We'll run no risks about this," he declared firmly. "We'll dismantle the
  apparatus. I'd never hold up my head again if the <i>Von Blucher</i> got
  us!"</p>

  <p>Crawshay held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Captain," he said, "but we want proof. Leave it to me, and if
  things are as I suspect, we'll have that proof&mdash;probably before
  to-morrow morning," he added, glancing at the chart.</p>

  <p>There was a call down the deck, a knock at the door. The captain took up
  his oilskins regretfully.</p>

  <p>"You will remember," Crawshay enjoined, "that little mandate I showed
  you?"</p>

  <p>The captain nodded grimly.</p>

  <p>"I am in your hands," he admitted. "Don't forget that the safety of the
  ship may be in your hands, too!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Crawshay whispered, "even more than the safety of the
  ship."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Robins, the wireless operator, bent closer over his
  instrument, and the blue fires flashed from the masthead of the steamer,
  cutting their way through the darkness into the black spaces beyond. The
  little room was lit by a dull oil light, the door was fast-closed and locked.
  Away into the night sped one continual message.</p>

  <p>"Steamship <i>City of Boston</i>, lat.... long.... lying four points to
  northward of usual course. Reply."</p>

  <p>A time came when the young man ceased from his labours and sat up with a
  yawn. He stretched out his hand and lit a cigarette, walked to the little
  round window which commanded the deck, gazed out of it steadily, and turned
  back once more to his chair before the instrument. Then something happened. A
  greater shock than any that lay in the blue lightning which he had been
  generating was awaiting him. His right hand was suddenly gripped and held on
  to the table. He found himself gazing straight down the black bore of a small
  but uncommonly ugly-looking revolver. A voice which seemed remarkable for its
  convincing qualities, addressed him.</p>

  <p>"If you speak a word, Robins, move, or show signs of any attempt to
  struggle, I shall shoot you. I have the right and the power." Robins, a young
  man of nerve, whose name stood high on an official list of those who might be
  relied upon for any desperate enterprise, sat like a numbed thing. Dim
  visions of the face of this man, only a few feet away from his own, assailed
  him under some very different guise. It was Crawshay the man, stripped for
  action, whose lean, strong fingers were gripping the butt of that revolver,
  and whose eyes were holding him like gimlets.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you are wise, answer me a few questions," Crawshay began. "I'd
  have brought the captain with me, but I thought we might do better business
  alone. You've been advertising the ship's whereabouts. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I've only been giving the usual calls," the young man muttered.</p>

  <p>"Don't lie to me," was the grim reply. "Your wireless was supposed to be
  silent from yesterday midday except for the purpose of receiving calls. I ask
  you again, why and to whom were you advertising our whereabouts and
  course?"</p>

  <p>Robins looked at the revolver, looked at Crawshay, and was dimly conscious
  of a damp feeling about his forehead. Nevertheless, his lips were screwed
  together, and he remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Come," Crawshay went on, "we'll have a common-sense talk. I am an agent
  of the British Secret Service. I have unlimited powers upon this ship, power
  to put a bullet through your head if I choose, and not a soul to question it.
  The game's up so far as you are concerned. You have received messages on this
  steamer of which you have kept no record, but which you have delivered
  secretly to a certain passenger. Of that I may or may not speak later on. At
  present I am more interested in your operations of to-night. You are
  signalling the information of our whereabouts for some definite reason. What
  is it? Were you trying to pick up the <i>Blucher?</i>"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't trying to pick up anybody," the young man faltered.</p>

  <p>Crawshay's fingers gripped him by the shoulder. His very
  determined-looking mouth had suddenly become a ring of steel.</p>

  <p>"If you don't give me a different answer in ten seconds, Robins, I'll blow
  your brains all over the cabin!"</p>

  <p>The young man broke.</p>

  <p>"I was trying to pick up the <i>Blucher</i>," he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I thought," Crawshay muttered. "That's the game,
  without a doubt. What are you? An Englishman?"</p>

  <p>"I am not!" was the almost fierce reply. "Blast England!"</p>

  <p>Crawshay looked into the black eyes, suddenly lit with an ugly fire, and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said. "Robins, your name, eh? Any relation to the young
  Sinn Feiner who was shot in Dublin a few months ago?"</p>

  <p>"Brother."</p>

  <p>"That may save your life later on," Crawshay observed coolly. "Now you can
  do one of three things. You can come with me to the captain, be put in irons
  and shot as soon as we land&mdash;or before, if the <i>Blucher</i> finds us;
  or you can send the message which I shall give you; or you can end your days
  where you sit."</p>

  <p>"What message?" the young man demanded.</p>

  <p>"You will send out a general call, as before, repeating the latitude and
  longitude with a difference of exactly three points, and you will repeat the
  altered course, only you will substitute the word 'south' for the word
  'north.'"</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes suddenly gleamed as he turned towards the instrument,
  but Crawshay smiled with grim understanding.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you that I understand the wireless," he said impressively.
  "You will give the message exactly as I have told you or we finish things up
  on the spot. I think you had better. It's a matter of compulsion, you
  know&mdash;in fact I'll explain matters to Mr. Jocelyn Thew, if you
  like."</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes were round with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. You needn't look so terrified. It isn't you who have given
  away. Now what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>The young man swung round to his instrument. Crawshay released his hand,
  stepping a little back.</p>

  <p>"You are going to send the message, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" was the sullen reply.</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Crawshay exclaimed, cautiously subsiding into a chair. "Now
  you'll go on every ten minutes until I tell you to stop."</p>

  <p>Robins bent over his task, and again the crackling waves broke away from
  their prison. Once his finger hesitated. He glanced surreptitiously at
  Crawshay. "Four degrees south," Crawshay repeated softly.</p>

  <p>The night wore on. Every ten minutes the message was sent. Then there
  followed a brief silence, spent generally by Robins with his head drooped
  upon his clasped arms; by Crawshay in unceasing vigil. Just as the first
  faint gleam of daylight stole into the little turret chamber, came the
  long-waited-for reply. The young man wrote down the few lines and passed them
  over. Crawshay, who had risen to his feet, glanced at them, nodded, and
  thrust the paper into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"That seems quite satisfactory," he said coldly. "Now ask the
  <i>Blucher</i> her exact course?"</p>

  <p>Robins sat for a moment motionless. He felt Crawshay's presence towering
  over him, felt again the spell of his softly-spoken command.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste any time, please. Do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>Robins obeyed. In less than a quarter of an hour he handed over another
  slip of paper. Crawshay thrust it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"That concludes our business," he said. "Now let me see if I remember
  enough of this apparatus to put it out of action."</p>

  <p>He bent over the instrument, removed some plugs, turned some screws, and
  finally placed in his pocket a small concealed part of the mechanism. Then he
  turned towards Robins.</p>

  <p>"You can leave here now," he directed. "I shall lock the place up."</p>

  <p>Robins had in some measure recovered himself. He was a quiet, hollow-eyed
  young person, with thick black hair and a thin frame, about which the uniform
  of the ship hung loosely. "You are the man who boarded the steamer from a
  seaplane, aren't you, and pretended afterwards to be such a ninny?"</p>

  <p>"I am," Crawshay acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"How did you get on to this?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he replied, "that is a matter concerning which I fear that you
  will have to restrain your curiosity."</p>

  <p>"How did you get in here?"</p>

  <p>"By means of a duplicate key which I obtained from the purser. I hid in
  your bunk there and drew the curtains. Quite a comfortable mattress, yours.
  You'll have to change your sleeping quarters, though."</p>

  <p>"What is going to happen to me?" the young man enquired.</p>

  <p>"Probably nothing extreme. You were philosophical enough to accept the
  situation. If," Crawshay went on more slowly, "you had falsified a single
  word of those messages, your end would have been somewhat abrupt and your
  destination according to your past life. As it is, you can go where you
  choose now and report to the captain later on in the morning, after I have
  had a talk with him."</p>

  <p>"My kit is all in here."</p>

  <p>Crawshay laid his hand upon the operator's shoulder in peremptory
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"Then you will have to do without it for the present," he replied coolly.
  "Outside."</p>

  <p>The young man turned on his heel and disappeared without a word. Crawshay
  glanced once more at the dismantled instrument, then followed Robins on to
  the deck, carefully locking the door behind him. A grey, stormy morning was
  just breaking, with piles of angry clouds creeping up, and showers of spray
  breaking over the ship on the weather side. He chose a sheltered spot and
  stood for a few moments breathing in the strong salt air. Notwithstanding his
  success, he was unaccountably depressed. As far as he could see across the
  grey waste of waters, there was no sign of any passing ship, but the eastern
  horizon was blurred by a low-hanging bank of sinister-looking clouds.
  Suddenly a voice rang out, hailing him. It was the captain descending from
  the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Come and have a cup of coffee with me in my room, Mr. Crawshay," he
  invited.</p>

  <p>Crawshay felt himself suddenly back again in the world of real happenings.
  His depression passed as though by magic. After all, he had won the first
  trick, and the next move was already forming up in his mind.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The captain sank into his easy-chair a little wearily. It
  had been a long and rather trying vigil. His steward filled two cups with
  coffee and at a sign from his master withdrew.</p>

  <p>"Any news?"</p>

  <p>"I have been compelled," Crawshay announced, stirring his coffee, "to
  dismantle your wireless."</p>

  <p>"The devil you have!"</p>

  <p>"Also, to speak words of wisdom to young Robins. I detected him signalling
  our location to the <i>Blucher</i>."</p>

  <p>The captain set down his coffee cup.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crawshay," he said, "this is a very serious accusation."</p>

  <p>"It isn't an accusation at all&mdash;it's a fact," Crawshay replied.
  "Luckily, he hadn't picked her up when I got there. He signalled our exact
  location and our course a dozen times or more, without response. Then I took
  a hand in the game."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what happened?" the captain enquired.</p>

  <p>"Well, I borrowed a key from Mr. Dix, and whilst the young man was down at
  his supper I concealed myself in his bunk. I listened to him for a short
  time, and then I intervened."</p>

  <p>"Did he make any trouble?"</p>

  <p>"He had no chance," Crawshay explained, a little grimly. "I was first off
  the mark. On this piece of paper," he added, smoothing it out, "you will find
  Robins' calculations as to our whereabouts, which I took as being correct.
  These, you understand, were not picked up. Lower down you will see the
  message which he sent under my superintendence later on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Superintendence?" the captain interrupted.</p>

  <p>"At the point of my revolver," Crawshay explained. "This message was
  picked up by the <i>Blucher</i>."</p>

  <p>The captain scanned the calculations eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Wish you'd given us a little more room," he muttered. "However, it will
  be all right unless we get fog. We might blunder into one another then."</p>

  <p>"This little incident," Crawshay continued, crossing his legs, "confirms
  certain impressions with which I came on board. I think that the scheme was
  to get the documents on board this steamer, and then, in order to avoid the
  inevitable search at Liverpool, I fancy it was arranged that the
  <i>Blucher</i> should be on the lookout for us and take over the messenger,
  whoever he may be, and the documents. It's a straightforward, simple little
  scheme, which we have now to look at from our own point of view. In the first
  place, the <i>Blucher</i> is now very much less likely to capture us. In the
  second place, I would suggest that in case the <i>Blucher</i> should happen
  to blunder across us, we make the search at once instead of in
  Liverpool."</p>

  <p>"What, search every one on board?" the captain asked.</p>

  <p>"Suspected persons only."</p>

  <p>"Exactly who are they?" "First and foremost, Mr. Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Phillips and his entourage."</p>

  <p>"What, the man who is supposed to be dying?"</p>

  <p>"I will admit," Crawshay said, "that this is more or less guesswork, but I
  suspect every one with whom Jocelyn speaks."</p>

  <p>"Great heavens, you are not thinking of Miss Beverley!" the captain
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I fail utterly to understand her acquaintance with Jocelyn Thew,"
  Crawshay confided. "I do not propose, however, that you interfere with these
  people for the moment. What I do ask is that Jocelyn Thew's effects are
  searched, and at once."</p>

  <p>"It's a thing that's never happened before on any steamer I've commanded,"
  the captain said reluctantly, "but if it has to be done, I will do it
  myself."</p>

  <p>"What chance of fog is there?" his companion enquired.</p>

  <p>"We shall get some within twenty-four hours, for certain. It's coming up
  from the west now."</p>

  <p>"Then the sooner you make a start with Mr. Jocelyn Thew, the better,"
  Crawshay suggested. "I don't think there's one chance in a hundred that he'd
  have those documents in any place where we should be likely to find them by
  any ordinary search, but you can never tell. The cleverest men often adopt
  the most obvious methods."</p>

  <p>The captain yawned.</p>

  <p>"I'll have two hours' sleep," he decided, "then Dix and I will tackle the
  job. I don't suppose you want to be in it?" "I should prefer not," Crawshay
  replied. "I'll follow your example," he added, rising to his feet.</p>

  <p>The habits of Mr. Jocelyn Thew on shore were doubtless most regular, but
  on board ship he had developed a proclivity for sleeping until long after the
  first breakfast gong. About half-past eight that morning, he was awakened
  from a sound sleep by a tap on his door, and instead of the steward with his
  hot water, no less a person entered than the captain, followed by the purser.
  Jocelyn sat up in his bunk and rubbed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, gentlemen," he said. "Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>The captain undid the catch of the door and closed it behind him.</p>

  <p>"Are you sufficiently awake to listen to a few words from me on a subject
  of importance, Mr. Thew?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," the captain proceeded, "I shall commence by taking you
  into my confidence. There is an impression on the part of the British and
  American Secret Services that an attempt is being made to convey documents of
  great importance, and containing treasonable matter, to Europe by some one on
  board this ship."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew, who was attired in silk pyjamas of very excellent quality,
  swung himself out of the bunk and sat upon the side of it. The captain was an
  observant man and of somewhat luxuriant tastes himself, and he fully
  appreciated the texture and quality of the suspected man's night apparel.
  "This sounds remarkably interesting," Jocelyn said. "Very kind of you,
  Captain, I am sure, to come and tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"My visit," the captain continued, a little drily, "had a more definite
  object. It is my duty to explain to you that the circumstances of this voyage
  are unprecedented. We are going to take liberties with our passengers which
  in normal times would not be dreamed of."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew pushed the knob with his left hand and let some cold water
  run into his basin. Then he dabbed his eyes for several moments with his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I seem to be awake," he remarked. "Tell me about these liberties,
  Captain?"</p>

  <p>"To begin with, I am going to search your stateroom and baggage&mdash;or
  rather they are going to be searched under my supervision. Your trunk from
  the hold has already been brought up and is in the gangway."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," Jocelyn said, sitting, as Mr. Dix expressed it
  afterwards, like a tiger about to spring, "that you've been listening to that
  crazy loon, Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"I am not at liberty," the captain rejoined, "to divulge the source from
  which my information came. I am only able to acquaint you with my intentions,
  and to trust that you will offer no obstruction."</p>

  <p>"The obstruction which I could offer against the captain of a ship and his
  crew would be a waste of energy," Jocelyn observed, with fine sarcasm. "At
  the same time, I protest most bitterly against my things being touched. Any
  search you deemed necessary could be undertaken at Liverpool by the Customs
  officers in the usual way. I consider that this entrance into my stateroom on
  the high seas, and this arbitrary resolve of yours to acquaint yourself with
  the nature of my belongings is indefensible and a gross insult."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you take it this way, Mr. Thew," the captain regretted.
  "Any complaints you feel it right to make can be addressed to the company's
  agents in Liverpool. At present I must proceed with what I conceive to be my
  duty. Do you care to hand Mr. Dix your keys?"</p>

  <p>"I will see Mr. Dix damned first!" Jocelyn assured him.</p>

  <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders, called to the steward, who was waiting
  outside, and the search commenced. They opened drawers, they turned up the
  carpet. They invited Jocelyn Thew to sit upon the couch whilst they ripped
  open the bed, and they invited him to return to the bed whilst they ripped up
  the couch. His personal belongings, his dressing-case and his steamer trunk
  were gone through with painstaking care. His trunk, which was then dragged
  in, was ransacked from top to bottom. In due course the search was concluded,
  and except that his wearing apparel seemed chosen with extraordinary care and
  taste, nothing in any way suspicious was discovered. The captain made haste
  to acknowledge the fact.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Thew," he announced, "I have done my duty and you are out of it
  with a clean sheet. Have you any objection to answering a few questions?"
  "Every objection in the world," Jocelyn Thew replied.</p>

  <p>The purser ventured to intervene.</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr. Thew," he said, "you're an Englishman, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>A light flashed in Thew's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I shall break the promise I made to the captain just now," he declared,
  "and answer that one question, at any rate. I thank God I am not!"</p>

  <p>Both men were a little startled. Jocelyn's cold, clear voice, his manner
  and bearing, were all so essentially Saxon. The captain, however, recovered
  himself quickly.</p>

  <p>"If the tone of your voice is any index to your feelings, Mr. Thew," he
  said, "you appear to have some grudge against England. In that case you can
  scarcely wonder at the suspicions which have attached themselves to you."</p>

  <p>"Suspicions!" Jocelyn repeated sarcastically. "Well, present my
  compliments to the wonderful Mr. Crawshay! I presume that I am at liberty now
  to take my bath?"</p>

  <p>"In one moment, Mr. Thew. Even though you do not choose to answer them,
  there are certain questions I intend to ask. The first is, are you prepared
  to produce the Marconigram which you received last evening?"</p>

  <p>"How do you know that I received one?"</p>

  <p>"The fact has come to my knowledge," the captain said drily.</p>

  <p>"You had better ask the operator about it."</p>

  <p>"The operator is at the present moment under arrest," was the terse reply.
  If the news were a shock to Thew, he showed it in none of the ordinary ways.
  His face seemed to fall for a moment into harder lines. His mouth tightened
  and his eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Under arrest?" he repeated. "More of Crawshay's tomfoolery, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"More of Mr. Crawshay's tomfoolery," the captain acknowledged. "Robins is
  accused of having received a Marconigram of which he took no note, and which
  he handed to a passenger. He is also accused of attempting to communicate
  with an enemy raider."</p>

  <p>A peculiar smile parted Jocelyn's lips.</p>

  <p>"You seem to wish to make this steamer of yours the <i>mise-en-scene</i>of
  a dime novel, Captain," he observed. "I accept the part of villain with
  resignation&mdash;but I should like to have my bath."</p>

  <p>"You don't propose to tell me, then," his questioner persisted, "the
  contents of that message?"</p>

  <p>"I have no recollection of having received one," Jocelyn replied coolly.
  "You are making me very late for breakfast."</p>

  <p>They left him with a brusque word of farewell, to which he did not reply.
  Jocelyn, in a dark-green silk dressing gown, with a huge sponge and various
  silver-topped bottles, departed for the bathroom. The captain and the purser
  strolled up on deck.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that fellow, Dix?" the former asked.</p>

  <p>The purser coughed.</p>

  <p>"If you ask me, sir," he replied, "I think that Mr. Crawshay has got hold
  of the wrong end of the stick."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Katharine came on deck that morning in a somewhat disturbed
  frame of mind. It was beginning to dawn upon her that her position as sick
  nurse to Mr. Phillips was meant to be a sinecure. She was allowed to sit by
  the sick man's side sometimes whilst the doctor took a promenade or ate a
  meal in the saloon, but apart from that, the usual exercise of her duties was
  not required from her. She was forced to admit that there was something
  mysterious about the little stateroom, the suffering man, and the doctor who
  watched him speechlessly night and day.</p>

  <p>She was conscious presently that Crawshay, who had been walking up and
  down the deck, had stopped before the chair on which she lay extended. She
  greeted him without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Are you taking one of your health constitutionals, Mr. Crawshay?" she
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether," he replied. "May I sit down for a moment?"</p>

  <p>"Of course! I don't think any one sits in that chair."</p>

  <p>He took his place by her side, deliberately removed his muffler and
  unfastened his overcoat. It struck her, from the first moment she heard his
  voice, that his manner was somehow altered. She was altogether unprepared,
  however, for the almost stern directness of his first question. "Miss
  Beverley," he began, "will you allow me to ask you how long you have known
  Mr. Jocelyn Thew?"</p>

  <p>She turned her head towards him and remained speechless for a moment. It
  seemed to her that she was looking into the face of a stranger. The little
  droop of the mouth had gone. The half-vacuous, half-bored expression had
  given place to something altogether new. The lines of his face had all
  tightened up, his eyes were hard and bright. She found herself quite unable
  to answer him in the manner she had intended.</p>

  <p>"Are you asking me that question seriously, Mr. Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>"I am," he assured her. "I have grave reasons for asking it."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I do not understand you," she replied stiffly.</p>

  <p>"You must change your attitude, if you please, Miss Beverley," Crawshay
  persisted. "Believe me, I am not trying to be impertinent. I am asking a
  question the necessity for which I am in a position to justify."</p>

  <p>"You bewilder me!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"That is simply because you looked upon me as a different sort of person.
  To tell you the truth, I should very much have preferred that you continued
  to look upon me as a different sort of person during this voyage, but I
  cannot see my way clear to keep silence on this one point. I wish to inform
  you, if you do not know it already, that Mr. Jocelyn Thew is a dangerous
  person for you to know, or for you to be associated with in any shape or
  form." She would have risen to her feet but he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Please look at me," he begged.</p>

  <p>She obeyed, half against her will.</p>

  <p>"I want you to ask yourself," he went on, "whether you do not believe that
  I am your well-wisher. What I am saying to you, I am saying to save you from
  a position which later on you might bitterly regret."</p>

  <p>She was conscious of a quality in his tone and manner entirely strange to
  her, and she found any form of answer exceedingly difficult. The anger which
  she would have preferred to have affected seemed, in the face of his
  earnestness, out of place.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," she said, "that you are assuming something which does
  not exist. I am not on specially intimate terms with Mr. Jocelyn Thew. I have
  not talked to him any more than to any other casual passenger."</p>

  <p>"Is that quite honest?" he asked quietly. "Isn't it true that Jocelyn Thew
  is interested in your mysterious patient?"</p>

  <p>She started.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I say," he replied. "I happen also to have very grave
  suspicions concerning the presence on this ship of Mr. Phillips and his
  doctor."</p>

  <p>Her fingers gripped the side of her deck chair. She leaned a little
  towards him.</p>

  <p>"What concern is all this of yours?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," he answered. "I am risking more than I should like to say in
  telling you as much as I have told you. I cannot believe that you would
  consciously associate yourself with a disgraceful and unpatriotic conspiracy.
  That is why I have chosen to risk a great deal in speaking to you in this
  way. Tell me what possible consideration was brought to bear upon you to
  induce you to accept your present situation?"</p>

  <p>Katharine sat quite still. The thoughts were chasing one another through
  her brain. Then she was conscious of a strange thing. Her companion's whole
  expression seemed suddenly to have changed. Without her noticing any
  movement, his monocle was in his left eye, his lip had fallen a little. He
  was looking querulously out seaward.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe," he declared, "that the captain has any idea about the
  weather prospects. Look at those clouds coming up. I don't know how you are
  feeling, Miss Beverley, but I am conscious of a distinct chill."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew had come to a standstill before them. He was wearing no
  overcoat and was bare-headed.</p>

  <p>"I guess that chill is somewhere in your imagination, Mr. Crawshay," he
  observed. "You are pretty strong in that line, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay struggled to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I have some ideas," he confessed modestly. "I spend my idle moments, even
  here, weaving a little fiction."</p>

  <p>"And recounting it, I dare say," Jocelyn ventured.</p>

  <p>"I am like all artists," Crawshay sighed. "I love an audience. I must
  express myself to something. I will wish you good evening, Miss Beverley. I
  feel inclined to take a little walk, in case it becomes too rough later
  on."</p>

  <p>He shuffled away, once more the perfect prototype of the <i>malade
  imaginaire</i>. Jocelyn Thew watched him in silence until he had disappeared.
  Then he turned and seated himself by the girl's side.</p>

  <p>"I find myself," he remarked ruminatively, "still a little troubled as to
  the precise amount of intelligence which our friend Mr. Crawshay might be
  said to possess. I wonder if I might ask; without your considering it a
  liberty, what he was talking to you about?"</p>

  <p>"About you," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>"Warning me against you."</p>

  <p>"Dear me! Aren't you terrified?"</p>

  <p>"I am not terrified," she replied, "but I think it best to tell you that
  he also has suspicions, absurd though it may seem, of Phillips and the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Why not the purser and captain, while he's about it?" Jocelyn said
  coolly. "Every one on this boat seems to have got the nerves. They searched
  my stateroom this morning."</p>

  <p>"Searched your stateroom?" she repeated. "Do you mean while you were
  out?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," he replied. "They dragged me up at half-past eight this
  morning&mdash;the captain, purser and a steward&mdash;fetched up my trunk and
  searched all my possessions."</p>

  <p>"What for?" she asked, with a sudden chill.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her reassuringly. "Something they didn't find! Something," he
  added, after a slight pause, "which they never will find!"</p>

  <p>Towards midday, Jocelyn Thew abandoned a game of shuffleboard, and,
  leaning against the side of the vessel, gazed steadily up at the wireless
  operating room. The lightnings had been playing around the mast for the last
  ten minutes without effect. He turned towards one of the ship's officers who
  was passing.</p>

  <p>"Anything gone wrong with the wireless?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"The operator's ill, sir," was the prompt reply. "We've only one on board,
  as it happens, so we are rather in a mess."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn strolled away aft, considering the situation. He found Crawshay
  seated in an elaborate deck chair and immersed in a novel.</p>

  <p>"I hear the wireless has gone wrong," he remarked, stopping in front of
  him.</p>

  <p>Crawshay glanced up blandly.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he demanded. "Wireless? Why, it's been going all the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"There has been no one there to take the messages, though. If anything
  happens to us, we shall be in a nice pickle."</p>

  <p>Crawshay shivered.</p>

  <p>"I wish you people wouldn't suggest such things," he said, a little
  testily. "I was just trying to get all thought of this most perilous voyage
  out of my mind, with the help of a novel here. From which do you seriously
  consider we have most to fear," he went on, "mines, submarines, or predatory
  vessels of the type of the <i>Blucher</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The latter, I should think," Jocelyn replied. "They say that submarines
  are scarcely venturing so far out just now."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Jocelyn Thew was apparently engaged in trying
  to fit a cigarette into his holder.</p>

  <p>"Specially hard luck on you," he remarked presently, "if anything happened
  when you've taken so much trouble to get on board."</p>

  <p>"It would be exceedingly annoying," Crawshay declared, with vigour, "added
  to which I am not in a state of health to endure a voyage in a small boat. I
  have been this morning to look at our places, in case of accident. I find
  that I am expected to wield an oar long enough to break my back."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew smiled. The other man's peevishness seemed too natural to be
  assumed.</p>

  <p>"I expect you'll be glad enough to do your bit, if anything does happen to
  us," he observed.</p>

  <p>"By-the-by," Crawshay asked, "I wonder what will become of that poor
  fellow downstairs&mdash;the man who is supposed to be dying, I mean&mdash;if
  trouble comes?"</p>

  <p>"I heard them discussing it at breakfast time," Jocelyn Thew replied. "I
  understand that he has asked specially to be allowed to remain where he is.
  There would of course be not the slightest chance of saving his life. The
  doctor who is with him&mdash;Gant, I think his name is&mdash;told us that
  anything in the shape of a rough sea, even, would mean the end of him. He
  quite understands this himself." Crawshay assented gravely.</p>

  <p>"It seems a little brutal but it is common sense," he declared. "In times
  of great stress, too, one becomes primitive, and the primitive instinct is
  for the strong to save himself. I am not ashamed to confess," he concluded,
  "that I have secured an extra lifebelt."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn glanced, for a moment scornfully down at the man who had now
  picked up his novel again and was busy reading. Crawshay represented so much
  the things that he despised in life. It was impossible to treat or consider
  him in any way as a rival to be feared. He passed down the deck and made his
  way below to the doctor's room. He found the latter in the act of starting
  off to see a patient.</p>

  <p>"I came around to ask after Robins, the young Marconi man," Jocelyn
  explained. "I hear that he was taken ill last night."</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at his questioner keenly.</p>

  <p>"That is so," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>"I have not thoroughly diagnosed his complaint as yet," was the careful
  reply. "I can tell you for a certainty, though, that he will not be able to
  work for two or three days."</p>

  <p>"It seems very sudden," Jocelyn Thew persisted.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I had some slight acquaintance with him, and I
  always thought that he was a remarkably strong young fellow."</p>

  <p>The doctor, who had completed his preparations for departure, picked up
  his cap and politely showed his visitor out. "You wouldn't care," the latter
  suggested, "to let me go down and have a look at him? I can't call myself a
  medical man, but I know something about sickness and I am quite interested in
  young Robins."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I shall need a second opinion at present, thank you,"
  the doctor rejoined, a little drily. "If you wish to see him later on, you
  must get permission from the captain. Good morning, Mr. Thew."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew strolled thoughtfully away, found a retired spot upon the
  promenade deck behind a boat, lit a very black cigar, and, drawing his
  field-glasses from his pocket, searched the horizon carefully. There was no
  sign of any passing steamer, not even the faintest wisp of black smoke
  anywhere upon the horizon. It was Wednesday to-day, and they had left New
  York on Saturday. He drew a sheet of paper from his pocket and made a few
  calculations. It was the day and past the time upon which things were due to
  happen....</p>

  <p>The day wore on very much as most days do on an Atlantic voyage in early
  summer. The little handful of passengers, who seemed for the moment to have
  cast all anxieties to the winds, played shuffleboard and quoits, lunched with
  vigorous appetites, drank tea out on deck, and indulged in strenuous
  before-dinner promenades. The sun shone all day, the sea remained wonderfully
  calm. Not a trace of any other steamer was visible from morning until early
  nightfall, and Jocelyn Thew walked restlessly about with a grim look upon his
  face. At dinner time the captain hinted at fog, and looked doubtfully out of
  the open porthole at the oily-looking waste of waters.</p>

  <p>"Another night on the bridge for me, I think," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"By-the-by, Captain," he asked, "now that the shipping is so reduced, do
  you alter speed for fog?"</p>

  <p>The captain filled his glass from the jug of lemonade which, was always
  before him.</p>

  <p>"Do we alter our speed, eh?" he repeated. "You must remember," he went on,
  "that we have Miss Beverley on board. We couldn't afford to give Miss
  Beverley a fright."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn accepted the evasion with a slight bow. Katharine, who had come in
  to dine a little late and seemed graver than usual, smiled at the
  captain.</p>

  <p>"Am I the most precious thing on this steamer?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Gallantry," the captain replied, "compels me to say yes!"</p>

  <p>"Only gallantry? Have we such a wonderful cargo, then?"</p>

  <p>"There are times," was the cautious reply, "when not even the captain
  knows exactly what he is carrying."</p>

  <p>"You remind me," Jocelyn Thew observed, "of a voyage I once made from Port
  Elizabeth to New York, with half-a-dozen I.D.B's on board, and as many
  detectives, watching them day and night."</p>

  <p>The captain nodded.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the detectives arrested the lot of them, I think, got hold of them on
  the last day." The captain rose from his place.</p>

  <p>"Queer thing," he remarked, "but the law generally does come out on
  top."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn followed his example a few minutes later, and Katharine purposely
  joined him on the way out. She led her companion to the corner where her
  steamer chair had been placed, and motioned him to sit by her side. They were
  on the weather side of the ship, with a slight breeze in their faces and a
  canopy over their heads which deadened sound. She leaned a little
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Smoke, please." she begged. "I mean it&mdash;see."</p>

  <p>She lit a cigarette and he followed suit.</p>

  <p>"Not a cigar?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I keep them for my hard thinking times."</p>

  <p>"Then you were thinking very hard this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I was," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"And gazing very earnestly out of those field-glasses of yours."</p>

  <p>"Quite true."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thew," she said abruptly, "it is my impression, although for some
  reason or other I am scarcely allowed to go near him, that Mr. Phillips is
  dying."</p>

  <p>"One knew, of course, that there was that risk," Jocelyn Thew reminded
  her.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that he can possibly live for twenty-four hours," she
  continued. "I was allowed to sit with him for a short time early this
  morning. He is beginning to wander in his mind, to speak of his wife and a
  sum of money." Jocelyn's fine eyebrows came a little closer together.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in his appearance or speech indicate the man of wealth or even of
  birth. I begin to wonder whether I know the whole truth about this frantic
  desire of his to reach England before he dies?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Jocelyn Thew said thoughtfully, "that you have been talking
  again to Mr. Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "and he has been warning me against you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Jocelyn ruminated, "the man has a certain amount of puppy-dog
  intelligence."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand Mr. Crawshay at all," she confessed. "My acquaintance
  with him before we met on this steamer was of the slightest, but his manner
  of coming certainly led one to believe that he was a man of courage and
  determination. Since then he has crawled about in an overcoat and rubber
  shoes, and groaned about his ailments until one feels inclined to laugh at
  him. Last night he was different again. He was entirely serious, and he spoke
  to me about you."</p>

  <p>"Do you need to be warned against me?" he asked grimly. "Have I ever
  sailed under false colours?"</p>

  <p>"Don't," she begged, looking at him with a little quiver of the lips and a
  wonderfully soft light in her eyes. "You have never deceived me in any way
  except, if at all, as regards this voyage. I made up my mind this evening
  that I would ask you, if you cared to tell me, to take me into your
  confidence about this man who is dying down below, and his strange journey. I
  need scarcely add that I should respect that confidence."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he answered. "You ask an impossibility."</p>

  <p>"Then there is some sort of conspiracy going on?" she persisted. "Let me
  ask you a straightforward question. Is it not true that you have made me an
  unknowing participator in an illegal act?"</p>

  <p>"It is," he admitted. "I was very sorry to have to do so but it was
  necessary. Without your assistance, I should never have been allowed to bring
  Phillips across the Atlantic."</p>

  <p>"What difference do I make?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You lend an air of respectability and credibility to the whole thing," he
  told her. "You are a person of repute, of distinguished social position, and
  the object of a good deal of admiration in your own country. The doctor who
  accompanies you comes from your own hospital. No one would believe it
  possible that either of you could be concerned in any sort of conspiracy. If
  that ass Crawshay had not got on board, I am convinced that there would never
  have been a breath of suspicion."</p>

  <p>She shivered a little.</p>

  <p>"Is it quite kind to bring me into an affair of this sort?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is a world," he declared cruelly, "in which we fight always for our
  own hand or go under. I am fighting for mine, and if I have occasionally to
  sacrifice a friend as well as an enemy, I do not hesitate."</p>

  <p>"What has the world done to you," she demanded, "that you should speak so
  bitterly?" "Better not ask me that."</p>

  <p>"How will the man Phillips' death affect your plans?"</p>

  <p>"It will make very little difference either way," he assured her. "We
  rather expected him to die."</p>

  <p>"And you won't take me any further into your confidence?"</p>

  <p>"No further. Your task will be completed at Liverpool. So long as you
  leave this steamer in company with the doctor and the ambulance, if Phillips
  is still alive, you will be free to return home whenever you please."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "You see, I accept my position. I shall go through
  with what I have promised, whatever Mr. Crawshay may say. Won't you in return
  treat me, if not as a confederate, as a friend?"</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at her, met the appealing glance of her soft eyes for
  a moment and looked suddenly away.</p>

  <p>"I do not belong to the ranks of those, Miss Beverley, from whom it is
  well for you to choose your friends."</p>

  <p>"But why should I not make my own choice?" she insisted. "I have always
  been my own mistress. I have lived with my own ideas, I have declined to be
  subject to any one's authority. I am an independent person. Can't you treat
  me as such?"</p>

  <p>"There are facts," he said, "which can never be ignored. You belong to the
  world of wealthy, gently born men and women who comprise what is called
  Society. I belong, and have belonged all my life, to a race of outcasts."
  "Don't!" she begged.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he repeated doggedly.</p>

  <p>"But what do you mean by outcasts?"</p>

  <p>"Criminals, if you like it better. I have broken the law more than once.
  There is an unexecuted warrant out against me at the present moment. You may
  even see me marched off this steamer at Liverpool between two policemen."</p>

  <p>"But why?" she asked passionately. "Why? What is the motive of it all? Is
  it money?"</p>

  <p>"I am not in need of money," he told her, "but I have a great and sacred
  use for all I can lay my fingers on. If I succeed in my present enterprise, I
  shall receive a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I value Jerry's life and future at more than that," she declared. "Will
  you make a fresh start, Mr. Jocelyn Thew, with twice that sum of money to
  your credit?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, but there was a curious change creeping into his face.
  For the first time she saw how soft a man's dark-blue eyes may sometimes
  become. The slight trembling of his parted lips, too, seemed to unlock all
  the cruel, hard lines of his face. He had suddenly the appearance of a person
  of temperament&mdash;a poet, even a dreamer.</p>

  <p>"I could not take money from you, Miss Beverley," he said, "or from any
  other woman in the world."</p>

  <p>"Upon no conditions?" she whispered softly.</p>

  <p>"Upon no conditions," he repeated.</p>

  <p>The breeze had dropped, and twilight had followed swiftly upon the misty
  sunset. There was something a little ghostly about the light in which they
  sat. "I am stifled," she declared abruptly. "Come and walk."</p>

  <p>They paced up and down the deck once or twice in silence. Then he paused
  as they drew near their chairs.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley," he said, "in case this should be the last time that we
  talk confidentially&mdash;so that we may put a seal, in fact, upon the
  subject of which we have spoken to-night&mdash;I would like to tell you that
  you have made me feel, during this last half-hour, an emotion which I have
  not felt for many years. And I want to tell you this. I am a lawbreaker. When
  I told you that there was a warrant out against me at the present moment, I
  told you the truth. The charge against me is a true one, and the penalty is
  one I shall never pay. I must go on to the end, and I shall do so because I
  have a driving impulse behind, a hate which only action can soothe. But all
  my sins have been against men and the doings of men. You will understand me,
  will you not, when I say that I can neither take your money, nor accept your
  friendship after this voyage is over? You, on your side, can remember that
  you have paid a debt."</p>

  <p>She sank a little wearily into her chair and looked out through the
  gathering mists. It seemed part of her fancy that they gathered him in, for
  she heard no sound of retreating footsteps. Yet when she spoke his name, a
  few moments later, she found that she was alone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Throughout the night reigned an almost sepulchral silence,
  and when the morning broke, the <i>City of Boston</i>, at a scarcely reduced
  speed, was ploughing her way through great banks of white fog. The decks, the
  promenade rails, every exposed part of the steamer, were glistening with wet.
  Up on the bridge, three officers besides the captain stood with eyes fixed in
  grim concentration upon the dense curtains of mist which seemed to shut them
  off altogether from the outer world. Jocelyn Thew and Crawshay met in the
  companionway, a few minutes after breakfast.</p>

  <p>"I can see no object in the disuse of the hooter," Crawshay declared
  querulously. "Nothing at sea could be worse than a collision. We are simply
  taking our lives in our hands, tearing along like this at sixteen knots an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there supposed to be a German raider out?" the other enquired.</p>

  <p>"I think it is exceedingly doubtful whether there is really one in the
  Atlantic at all. The English gunboats patrol these seas. Besides, we are
  armed ourselves, and she wouldn't be likely to tackle us."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew had leaned a little forward. He was listening intently. At
  the same time, one of the figures upon the bridge, his hand to his ear,
  turned in the same direction.</p>

  <p>"There's some one who doesn't mind letting their whereabouts be known," he
  whispered, after a moment's pause. "Can't you hear a hooter?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay listened but shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Can't hear a thing," he declared laconically. "I've a cold in my head
  coming on, and it always affects my hearing."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew stepped on tiptoe across the deck as far as the rail and
  returned in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"There's a steamer calling, away on the starboard bow," he announced. "She
  seems to be getting nearer, too. I wonder we don't alter our course."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose it's the captain's business whether he chooses to answer
  or not," Crawshay remarked. "I shall go down to my cabin. This gazing at
  nothing gets on my nerves."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew returned to his damp vigil. Leaning over the wet wooden rail,
  he drew a little diagram on the back of an envelope and worked out some
  figures. Then he listened once more, the slight frown upon his forehead
  deepening. Finally he tore up his sketch and made his way to the doctor's
  room. The doctor was seated at his desk and glanced up enquiringly as his
  visitor entered.</p>

  <p>"I just looked in to see how young Robins was getting on," Jocelyn
  explained.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he is in rather a bad way," was the grave reply.</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of his illness?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. His manner became a little vague.</p>

  <p>"I must remind you, Mr. Thew," he said, "that a doctor is not always at
  liberty to discuss the ailments of his patients. On board ship this custom
  becomes more, even, than mere etiquette. It is, in fact, against the
  regulations of the company for us to discuss the maladies of any passenger
  upon the steamer."</p>

  <p>"I recognise the truth of all that you say," Jocelyn Thew agreed, "but it
  happens that I know the young man and his people. Naturally, therefore, I
  take an interest in him, and I am sure they would think it strange if,
  travelling upon the same steamer, I did not make these very ordinary
  enquiries."</p>

  <p>"You know his people, do you?" the doctor repeated. "Where does he come
  from, Mr. Thew?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere over New Jersey way," was the glib reply, "but I used to meet
  his father often in New York. There can be no mystery about his illness, can
  there, doctor&mdash;no reason why I should not go and see him?"</p>

  <p>"I have placed the young man in quarantine," was the brief explanation,
  "and until he is released no one can go near him."</p>

  <p>"Something catching, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Something that might turn out to be catching."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew shrugged his shoulders and accepted what amounted almost to a
  little nod of dismissal. He ascended the staircase thoughtfully and came face
  to face with Katharine Beverley, issuing from the music room. She greeted him
  with a little exclamation of relief.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thew," she exclaimed, "I have been looking for you everywhere. Doctor
  Gant thinks," she added, lowering her voice, "that if you wish to see his
  patient alive, you had better come at once." "There is a change in his
  condition, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she told him gravely.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment thinking rapidly. The girl shivered a little as she
  watched the change in his face. Her hospital training had not lessened her
  awe and sympathy in the face of death, and it was so entirely obvious that
  Jocelyn Thew was considering only what influence upon his plans this event
  might have. Finally he turned and descended the stairs by her side.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure that it is wise of me to come," he said. "However,
  if he is asking for me I suppose I had better."</p>

  <p>They made their way into the commodious stateroom upon the saloon deck,
  which had been secured for the sick man. He lay upon a small hospital bed,
  nothing of him visible save his haggard face, with its ill-grown beard. His
  eyes were watching the door, and he showed some signs of gratification at
  Jocelyn's entrance. Gant, who was standing over the bed, turned
  apologetically towards the latter.</p>

  <p>"It's the money," he whispered. "He is worrying about that. I was obliged
  to send for you. He called out your name just now, and the ship's doctor was
  hanging around."</p>

  <p>The newcomer drew a stool to the side of the bed, opened a pocketbook and
  counted out a great wad of notes. The dying man watched him with every
  appearance of interest.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand dollars," the former said at last. "That should bring in
  about eleven hundred and fifty pounds. Now watch me, Phillips."</p>

  <p>He took an envelope from his pocket, thrust the notes inside, gummed down
  the flap, and, drawing a fountain pen from his pocket, wrote an address. The
  dying man watched him and nodded feebly.</p>

  <p>"These," Jocelyn continued, "are for your wife. The packet shall be
  delivered to her within twelve hours of our landing in Liverpool. You can
  keep it under your pillow and hand it over to Miss Beverley here. You trust
  her?"</p>

  <p>The man on the bed nodded feebly and turned slightly towards Katharine.
  She bent over him.</p>

  <p>"I shall see myself," she promised, "that the money is properly
  delivered."</p>

  <p>Phillips smiled and closed his eyes. It was obvious that he had no more to
  say. Jocelyn Thew stole softly out, followed, a moment later, by
  Katharine.</p>

  <p>"The doctor thinks I am better away," she whispered. "He won't speak
  again. Poor fellow!"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn stepped softly up the stairs and drew a little breath of relief as
  they reached the promenade deck without meeting any one. Both seemed to feel
  the desire for fresh air, and they stepped outside for a moment. There were
  tears in Katharine's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, a little timidly, "I don't understand this at all,
  but it is terribly tragic. Do you think that he would have lived if he had
  not undertaken the journey?"</p>

  <p>"It was absolutely impossible," her companion assured her. "He was a dying
  man from the moment the operation was finished."</p>

  <p>"Will he be buried at sea?"</p>

  <p>"I think not. He was exceedingly anxious to be buried at his home near
  Chester. It isn't a pleasant thing to talk about," Jocelyn went on, "but they
  brought his coffin on board with him. It's lying in the companionway now,
  covered over with a rug."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"It's a horrible day altogether," she declared, looking out into the
  seemingly endless banks of mist.</p>

  <p>"Entirely my opinion, Miss Beverley," a voice said in her ear. "I find it
  most depressing&mdash;and unhealthy. And listen.&mdash;Do you hear that?"</p>

  <p>They all listened intently. Again they could hear the hooting of a steamer
  in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Between ourselves," Crawshay went on confidentially, "the captain seems
  to me rather worried. That steamer has been following us for hours. She is
  evidently waiting for the fog to lift, to see who we are."</p>

  <p>"How does she know about us?" Katharine asked. "We haven't blown our
  hooter once."</p>

  <p>"We don't need to," was the fractious reply. "That's where we are being
  over-careful. She can hear our engines distinctly."</p>

  <p>"Who does the captain think she is, then?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay's voice was dropped to a mysterious pitch, but though he leaned
  towards the girl, his eyes were fixed upon her companion.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't go as far as to express a definite opinion, but he thinks that
  it might be that German raider&mdash;the <i>Blucher</i>, isn't it? She can
  steal about quite safely in the fog, and she can tell by the beat of the
  engines whether she is near a man-of-war or not."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of Jocelyn's face twitched, but there was a momentary gleam
  in his eyes of which Crawshay took swift note. He glanced aft to where the
  two seamen were standing by the side of their guns.</p>

  <p>"If it really is the German raider," he remarked, "they might as well fire
  off a popgun as that thing. She is supposed to be armed with four six-inch
  guns and two torpedo tubes."</p>

  <p>Crawshay nodded.</p>

  <p>"So I told the captain. We might have a go at a submarine, but the raider
  would sink us in two minutes if we tried to tackle her. What a beastly voyage
  this is!" he went on, in a depressed tone. "I can't get over the fact that I
  risked my life to get on board, too."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew, with a little word of excuse, had swung around and
  disappeared. Katharine looked at her companion curiously.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that it really is the raider, Mr. Crawshay?" she
  enquired.</p>

  <p>He hesitated. In Jocelyn's absence his manner seemed to undergo some
  subtle change, his tone to become crisper and less querulous.</p>

  <p>"We had some reason to hope," he said cautiously, "that she was on a
  different course. It is just possible, however, that in changing it she might
  have struck this bank of fog and preferred to hang about for a time."</p>

  <p>"What will happen if she finds us?"</p>

  <p>"That depends entirely upon circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," Katharine continued, "that you know more about this
  matter than you feel inclined to divulge."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he admitted. "Nowadays, every one has to learn discretion."</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary with me?" "It is necessary with any friend of Mr. Jocelyn
  Thew," he told her didactically.</p>

  <p>"What a suspicious person you are!" she exclaimed, a little scornfully.
  "You are just like all your countrymen. You get hold of an idea and nothing
  can shake it. Mr. Jocelyn Thew, I dare say, possesses a past. I know for a
  fact that he has been engaged in all sorts of adventures during his life.
  But&mdash;at your instigation, I suppose&mdash;they have already searched his
  person, his stateroom, and every article of luggage he has. After that, why
  not leave him alone?"</p>

  <p>"Because he is an extremely clever person."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not satisfied yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"Am I, may I ask, under suspicion?" she enquired, with faint sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"I should not like to say," he replied glibly, "that you were altogether
  free from it."</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"I should not worry about the army if I were you," she advised. "I am
  quite sure that secret-service work is the natural outlet for your
  talents."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised," he confided, "if headquarters didn't insist
  upon my taking it up permanently. It will depend a little, of course, upon
  what success I have during this voyage."</p>

  <p>She laughed in his face and turned away.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what I find so interesting about you, Mr. Crawshay," she
  said. "You must be either very much cleverer than you seem, or very much more
  foolish. You keep me continually guessing as to which it is."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Towards six o'clock that evening, without any apparent
  change in the situation, Captain Jones descended from the bridge and
  signalled to Crawshay, whom he passed on the deck, to follow him into his
  room. The great ship was still going at full speed through a sea which was as
  smooth as glass.</p>

  <p>"Getting out of it, aren't we?" Crawshay enquired.</p>

  <p>The captain nodded. His hair and beard were soaked with moisture, and
  there were beads of wet all over his face. Otherwise he seemed little the
  worse for his long vigil. In his eyes, however, was a new anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Another five miles," he confided, "should see us in clear weather."</p>

  <p>"Steamer's still following us, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Sticking to us like a leech," was the terse reply. "She is not out of any
  American port. She must have just picked us up. She isn't any ordinary cargo
  steamer, either, or she couldn't make the speed."</p>

  <p>"I've worked it out by your chart," Crawshay declared, "and it might very
  well be the Blucher. I don't think I made the altered course wide enough, and
  she might very well have been hanging about a bit when she struck the fog and
  heard our engines."</p>

  <p>The captain lit a pipe. "I am not in the habit, as you may imagine, of
  discussing the conduct of my ship with any one, Mr. Crawshay," he said, "but
  you come to me with very absolute credentials, and it's rather a comfort to
  have some one standing by with whom one can share the responsibility. You see
  my couple of guns? They are about as useful as catapults against the
  <i>Blucher</i>, whereas, on the other hand, she could sink us easily with a
  couple of volleys."</p>

  <p>"Just so," Crawshay agreed. "What about speed, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"If our reports are trustworthy, we might be able to squeeze out one more
  knot than she can do," was the doubtful reply, "but, you see, she'll follow
  us out of this last bank of fog practically within rifle range. I've altered
  my course three or four times so as to get a start, but she hangs on like
  grim death. That's what makes me so sure that it's the <i>Blucher</i>."</p>

  <p>"Want my advice?" Crawshay asked.</p>

  <p>"That's the idea," the captain acquiesced.</p>

  <p>"Stoke her up, then, and drive full speed ahead. Take no notice of any
  signals. Make for home with the last ounce you can squeeze out of her."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," Captain Jones observed, "but there will be at
  least half an hour during which we shall be within effective range. She might
  sink us a dozen times over."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I don't think she will."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"If the theory upon which I started this wild-goose chase is correct,"
  Crawshay explained, "there is something on board this ship infinitely more
  valuable than the ship itself to Germany. That is why I think that she will
  strain every nerve to try and capture you, of course, but she will never sink
  you, because if she did she would lose everything her Secret Service have
  worked for in Germany ever since, and even before the commencement of the
  war."</p>

  <p>"It's an idea," the captain admitted, with a gleam in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's common sense," Crawshay urged. "When I left Halifax, I was ready to
  take twenty-five to one that we'd been sold. I wouldn't mind laying
  twenty-five to one now that what we are in search of is somewhere on board
  this steamer. If that is so, the <i>Blucher</i> will never dare to sink you,
  because there will still remain the chance of the person on board who is in
  charge of the documents getting away with them at the other end, whereas down
  at the bottom of the Atlantic they would be of no use to any one."</p>

  <p>"I see your point of view," the other agreed.</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better take my tip," Crawshay continued. "There isn't a
  passenger on board who didn't know the risk they were running when they
  started, and I'm sure no one will blame you for not surrendering your ship
  like a dummy directly you're asked. They're a pretty sporting lot in the
  saloon, you know. All those newspaper men are real good fellows."</p>

  <p>The captain's face brightened.</p>

  <p>"Next to fighting her," he soliloquised, stroking his beard,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The idea of fighting her is ridiculous," Crawshay interrupted. "Look
  here, you haven't any time to lose. Send to the engineer and let him give it
  to them straight down below. I'll give a tenner apiece to the stokers, if we
  get clear, and if my advice turns out wrong, I'll see you through it,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"We can leg it at a trifle over nineteen knots," Captain Jones declared,
  as he picked up his cap, "and, anyway, anything's better than having one of
  those short-haired, smooth-tongued, blustering Germans on board."</p>

  <p>He hurried off, and Crawshay followed him on deck to watch developments.
  Already, through what seemed to be an opening in the walls of fog, there was
  a vision in front of clear blue sea on which a still concealed sun was
  shining. Soon they passed out into a new temperature of pleasant warmth, with
  a skyline ahead, hard and clear. The passengers came crowding on deck. Every
  one leaned over the starboard rail, looking towards the place whence the
  sound of the hooting was still proceeding. Suddenly a steamer crept out of
  the fog mountain and drew clear, barely half a mile away. The first glimpse
  at her was final. She had cast off all disguise. Her false forecastle was
  thrown back, and the sun glittered upon three exceedingly formidable-looking
  guns, trained upon the <i>City of Boston</i>. A row of signals, already
  hoisted, were fluttering from her mast.</p>

  <p>"It's the <i>Blucher</i>, by God!" Sam West muttered.</p>

  <p>"We're nabbed!" his little friend groaned.</p>

  <p>"Wonder what they'll do with us."</p>

  <p>Every eye was upturned now to the mast for the answering signals. To the
  universal surprise, none were hoisted. The captain stood upon the bridge with
  his glass focussed upon the raider. He gave no orders, only the black smoke
  was beginning to belch now from the funnels, and little pieces of smut and
  burning coal blew down the deck. Jocelyn Thew, who was standing a little
  apart, frowned to himself. He had seen Crawshay and the captain come out of
  the latter's cabin together.</p>

  <p>The blue lightnings were playing now unchecked about the top of the
  Marconi room. Another more imperative signal flew from the pirate ship. A
  minute later there was a puff of white smoke, a loud report, and a shell
  burst in the sea, fifty yards ahead. Crawshay edged up to where Jocelyn Thew
  was standing.</p>

  <p>"This is a damned unpleasant affair," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is," was the grim reply.</p>

  <p>"You know it's the <i>Blucher</i>?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt about that."</p>

  <p>"What on earth are we up to?" Crawshay continued, in a dissatisfied tone.
  "We haven't even replied to her signals."</p>

  <p>"It appears to me," Jocelyn Thew pronounced irritably, "that we are going
  to try and get away. I never heard of such lunacy. They can blow us to pieces
  if they want to."</p>

  <p>Crawshay shivered.</p>

  <p>"I think," he protested, "that some one ought to remonstrate with the
  captain. Look, there's another shell coming! Damned ugly things!"</p>

  <p>There was another puff of white smoke, and this time the projectile fell
  within a steamer's length of them, sending a great fountain of water into the
  air. "They are giving us plenty of warning," Jocelyn Thew observed coolly. "I
  suppose we shall get the next one amidships."</p>

  <p>"I find it most upsetting," his companion declared. "I am going down to
  the cabin to get my lifebelt."</p>

  <p>He turned away. Presently there was another line of signals, more shots,
  some across the bows of the steamer, some right over her, a few aft.
  Nevertheless, the <i>City of Boston</i> stood on her course, and the distance
  between the two steamers gradually widened. Katharine, who had come up on
  deck, stood by Jocelyn Thew's side.</p>

  <p>"Is this really the way that they shoot," she asked, "or aren't they
  trying to hit us?"</p>

  <p>"They are not trying," he told her. "If they were, every shot they fired
  at this range would be sufficient to send us to the bottom."</p>

  <p>"Why aren't they trying?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"There's a reason for that, which I can't at the moment explain," was the
  gloomy reply. "They want to capture us, not sink us! What I can't understand,
  though, is how the captain here found that out."</p>

  <p>"How is it that you are so well-informed?" Katharine asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"You had better not enquire, Miss Beverley. It's just as well not to know
  too much of these things. Here's Mr. Crawshay," he added. "Perhaps he'll tell
  you."</p>

  <p>Crawshay appeared, hugging his lifebelt, on which he seated himself
  gingerly.</p>

  <p>"Can't imagine what the captain's up to," he complained. "A chap who
  understands those little flags has just told me that they've threatened to
  blow us to pieces if we go on.&mdash;Here comes another shell!" he groaned.
  "Two to one they've got us this time!&mdash;Ugh!"</p>

  <p>They all ducked to avoid a shower of spray. When they stood upright again,
  Katharine studied the newcomer for a minute critically. There was a certain
  air of strain about most of the passengers. Even Jocelyn Thew's firm hand had
  trembled, a moment ago, as he had lowered his glasses. Crawshay, seated upon
  his lifebelt, with a mackintosh buttoned around him, his eyeglass firmly
  adjusted, his mouth querulous, was not exactly an impressive-looking object.
  Yet she wondered.</p>

  <p>"Give me your hand," she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>He obeyed at once. The fingers were cool and firm.</p>

  <p>"Why do you pretend to be afraid?" she demanded. "You aren't in the
  least."</p>

  <p>"Amateur theatricals," he replied tersely, "coupled with a certain amount
  of self-control. I am a cool-tempered fellow at most times.&mdash;Jove, this
  one's meant for us, I believe!"</p>

  <p>They all ducked instinctively. The shell, however, fell short. Crawshay
  measured the distance between the two steamers with his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dashed if I don't believe we're giving them the slip!" he exclaimed. "I
  wonder why in thunder they're letting us off like this! The captain must have
  known something."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew turned around and looked reflectively at the speaker. For a
  single moment Crawshay's muscles tingled with the apprehension of danger.
  There was a smouldering light in the other's eyes, such a light as might
  gleam in the tiger's eyes before his spring. Crawshay's hand slipped to his
  hip pocket. So for a moment they remained. Then Jocelyn Thew shrugged his
  shoulders, and the tense moment was past.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be some one on this ship," he said quietly, "who knows
  more than is good for him."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The <i>City of Boston</i> passed through the danger zone in
  safety, and dropped anchor in the Mersey only a few hours later than the time
  of her expected arrival. Towards the close of a somewhat uproarious dinner,
  during which many bottles of champagne were emptied to various toasts,
  Captain Jones quite unexpectedly entered the saloon, and, waving his hand in
  response to the cheers which greeted him, made his way to his usual table,
  from which he addressed the little company.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "I have an announcement to make to which
  I beg you will listen with patience. Both the English and the American
  police, whether with reason or not, as we may presently determine, have come
  to the conclusion that a large number of very important documents, collected
  in America by the agents of a foreign power, have been smuggled across the
  Atlantic upon this ship, in the hope that they may eventually reach Germany.
  In a quarter of an hour's time, a number of plainclothes policemen will be on
  board. I am going to ask you, as loyal British and American subjects, to
  subject yourselves, without resistance or complaint, to any search which they
  may choose to make. I may add that my own person, luggage and cabin will be
  the first object of their attention." The captain, having delivered his
  address, left the saloon again amidst a little buzz of voices. There had
  probably never been a voyage across the Atlantic in which a matter of forty
  passengers had been treated to so many rumours and whispers of strange
  happenings. Sam West got up and spoke a few words, counselling the ready
  assent of every one there to submit to anything that was thought necessary.
  He briefly commented upon their unexplained but fortuitous escape from the
  raider, and heaped congratulations upon their captain. Very soon after he had
  resumed his seat, the shrill whistle of a tug alongside indicated the arrival
  of visitors. A steward passed back and forth amongst the passengers with a
  universal request&mdash;all were asked to repair to their staterooms. Twenty-
  seven exceedingly alert-looking men thereupon commenced their task.</p>

  <p>Seated upon the couch in her room, with a cup of coffee by her side and a
  cigarette between her lips, Katharine listened to the conversation which
  passed in the opposite room, the one which had been tenanted by Phillips. For
  some reason, the end of the voyage, instead of bringing her the relief which
  she had expected, had only increased her nervous excitement. She was filled
  with an extraordinary prescience of some coming crisis. She found herself
  trembling as she listened to Doctor Gant's harsh voice and the smooth accents
  of his interlocutor.</p>

  <p>"Well, that completes our search of your belongings, Doctor Gant," the
  latter's voice observed. "Now I want to ask a few questions with reference to
  the Mr. Phillips who I understand died the day before yesterday under your
  charge." "That is so," Doctor Gant agreed. "He had no luggage, as we only
  made up our minds to undertake the journey with him at the last moment. The
  few oddments he used on the voyage, we burned."</p>

  <p>"And the body, I understand,&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can examine it at once, if you will," the doctor interrupted. "We
  have purposely left the coffin lid only partly screwed down. I should like to
  say, however, that before arranging the deceased for burial, I asked the
  ship's doctor to make an examination with me of the coffin and the garments
  which I used. He signed the certificate, and he will be ready to answer any
  questions."</p>

  <p>"That seems entirely satisfactory," the detective confessed. "I will just
  have the coffin lid off for a few moments, and will see the doctor before I
  leave the ship."</p>

  <p>The men left the room together and were absent some ten minutes. Presently
  the detective returned to Katharine's room, and with him came Crawshay.
  Katharine had discarded the nurse's costume which she had usually worn on
  board ship, and was wearing the black tailor-made suit in which she had
  expected to land. In the dim light, her pallor and nervous condition almost
  startled Crawshay.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive my intrusion," he said. "I have just been explaining
  your presence here to Mr. Brightman, the detective, and I don't think he will
  trouble you for more than a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"Please treat me exactly as the others," she begged.</p>

  <p>The search proceeded for a few moments in silence. Then the detective
  looked up from the dressing case which he was examining. In his hand he held
  the envelope addressed to Mrs. Phillips.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling me what this is, Miss Beverley?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is a roll of bills," she replied, "that belonged to Mr. Phillips. I
  promised to see them handed over to his wife."</p>

  <p>Brightman glanced at the address and balanced the envelope on the palm of
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"It is against the law," he told her, "for a passenger to be the bearer of
  any sealed letter."</p>

  <p>Katharine shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," she said, "but the packet which you have did not come
  from America at all. It was sealed up on board this ship at the time when I
  accepted the charge of its delivery. There is no letter or communication of
  any sort inside."</p>

  <p>"You will not object," the detective enquired, "to my opening it?"</p>

  <p>She frowned impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," she repeated, "that I saw the notes put inside an
  empty envelope. Mr. Crawshay will tell you that my word is to be relied
  upon."</p>

  <p>"Implicitly, Miss Beverley," Crawshay pronounced emphatically, "but under
  the circumstances I think no harm would be done if you allowed our friend
  just to glance inside. The notes can easily be sealed up in another
  envelope."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like," she acquiesced coolly. "You will find nothing but
  bills there."</p>

  <p>Brightman tore open the envelope and glanced inside as though he did not
  intend further to disturb it. Suddenly his face changed. He shook out the
  contents upon the little table. They all three looked at the pile of papers
  with varying expressions. In Katharine's face there was nothing but blank
  bewilderment, in Crawshay's something of horror, in the detective's a faint
  gleam of triumph. He pressed his finger down on the heading of the first
  sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"I am not much of a German scholar," he observed. "How do you translate
  that, Mr. Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay was silent for several moments. Then in a perfectly mechanical
  tone he read out the heading:</p>

  <p>"'List of our agents in New York and district who may be absolutely
  trusted for any enterprise.'"</p>

  <p>There was another dead silence, a silence, on Katharine's part, of
  complete mental paralysis. Crawshay's face had lost all its smooth petulance.
  He was like a man who had received a blow.</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," Katharine faltered at last. "That packet has not
  been out of my possession, and I saw the notes put into it."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" Crawshay demanded.</p>

  <p>"By Mr. Phillips," she declared steadfastly, "by Mr. Phillips and Doctor
  Gant together."</p>

  <p>The detective turned the envelope over in his hand.</p>

  <p>"The bills seem to have disappeared," he observed.</p>

  <p>"They were in that envelope," Katharine persisted. "I have never seen
  those papers before in my life."</p>

  <p>Brightman's face remained immovable. One by one he slipped the papers back
  into the envelope, thrust them into his breast pocket, and, turning round,
  locked the door.</p>

  <p>"You must forgive me if the rest of our investigations may seem
  unnecessarily severe, Miss Beverley," he said.</p>

  <p>Katharine sank back upon the sofa. She was utterly bewildered by the
  events of the last few minutes. The search of her belongings was now being
  conducted with ruthless persistence. Her head was buried in her hands. She
  did not even glance at the contents of her trunk, which were now overflowing
  the room. Suddenly she was conscious of another pause in the proceedings, a
  half-spoken exclamation from the detective. She looked up. From within the
  folds of an evening gown he had withdrawn a small, official-looking dispatch
  box of black tin, tied with red tape, and with great seals hanging from
  either end.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Katharine stared at it with wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen it before," she declared.</p>

  <p>There was another painful, significant silence. Crawshay bent forward and
  examined the seals through his glass.</p>

  <p>"This," he announced presently, "is the official seal of a neutral
  Embassy. You see how the packet is addressed?"</p>

  <p>"I see," the detective admitted, "but, considering the way in which we
  have found it, you are not suggesting, I hope, that we should not open
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Opened it certainly must be," Crawshay admitted, "but not by us in this
  manner. When you have finished your search, I should be glad if you will
  bring both packets with you to the captain's room."</p>

  <p>Brightman silently resumed his labours. Nothing further, however, was
  found. The two men stood up together.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley," Brightman began gravely,&mdash;</p>

  <p>Crawshay laid his hand upon the man's arm.</p>

  <p>"Wait for a moment," he begged. "I wish to have a few words with you
  outside. We shall be back before long, Miss Beverley."</p>

  <p>The two men disappeared. Katharine, with a sinking of the heart, heard the
  key turn on the outside of her stateroom. She watched the lock slip into its
  place with an indescribable sense of humiliation. She had been
  guilty&mdash;of what?</p>

  <p>She lost count of time, but it was certain that only a few minutes could
  have passed before a strange thing happened. The sight of that lock, which
  seemed somehow to shut her off from the world of reasonable, honest men and
  women, had fascinated her. She was sitting watching it, her chin resting upon
  her hands, something of the horror still in her eyes, when without sound, or
  any visible explanation, she saw it glide back to its place. The door was
  opened and closed. Jocelyn Thew was standing in her stateroom.</p>

  <p>"You?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I am not disappointed in you, I am sure," he said softly. "You will keep
  still. You will not say a word. I have risked the whole success of a great
  enterprise to come and say these few words to you. I am ashamed and sorry for
  what you are suffering, but I want to tell you this. Nothing serious will
  happen&mdash;nothing serious can happen to you. Everything is not as it
  seems. Will you believe that? Look at me. Will you believe that?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes. Once more there was that change in his face which had
  seemed so wonderful to her. The blue of his eyes was soft, his mouth almost
  tremulous. She answered him almost as though mesmerised.</p>

  <p>"I will believe it," she promised.</p>

  <p>As silently and mysteriously as he had come, he turned and left her. She
  watched the latch. She saw the lock creep silently once more into its place.
  She heard no movement outside, but Jocelyn Thew had gone.</p>

  <p>During the few remaining minutes of her solitude, Katharine felt a curious
  change in the atmosphere of the little disordered stateroom, in her own dazed
  and bruised feelings. She seemed somehow to be playing a part in a little
  drama which had nothing to do with real life. All her fears had vanished. She
  rose from her place, smoothed her disordered hair carefully, bathed her
  temples with eau-de-cologne, adjusted her hat and veil, and, turning on the
  reading lamp, opened a novel. She actually managed to read a couple of pages
  before there was a knock at the door and the two men reappeared. She laid
  down her book and greeted them quite coolly.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you come to pronounce sentence upon me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Our authority scarcely goes so far," Brightman replied. "I am going on
  shore now, Miss Beverley, to fetch the consul of the country to which this
  packet is addressed. It will be opened in his presence. In the meantime, Mr.
  Crawshay has given his parole for you. You will therefore be free of the
  ship, but it will be, I am afraid, my duty to ask you to come with me to the
  police station for a further examination, on my return."</p>

  <p>"I am sure I shall like to come very much," she said sweetly, "but if you
  go on asking me questions forever, I am afraid you won't come any nearer
  solving the problem of how that box got into my trunk, or how those bills got
  changed into those queer-looking little slips of papers. However, that of
  course is your affair."</p>

  <p>The detective departed with a stiff bow. Crawshay, however, lingered.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going with your friend?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>He ignored the question.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley," he said, "you will forgive me saying that I find the
  present position exceedingly painful."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she demanded. "I don't see how you are suffering by it."</p>

  <p>"It was at my instigation," he went on, "that suspicion was first directed
  against your travelling companions. I am convinced that the first idea was to
  get these documents off the ship upon the person of Phillips, if alive, or in
  his coffin if dead. The instigators of this abominable conspiracy have taken
  fright and have made you their victim. Certainly," he went on, "it was a
  shrewd idea. I myself suggested to Brightman that your things might remain
  undisturbed. But for the finding of that envelope, your trunk would certainly
  not have been opened. You see the position I have placed myself in. I am
  driven to ask you a question. Did you know of the presence of those papers
  and dispatch box amongst your belongings?"</p>

  <p>"I had no idea of it," she answered fervently.</p>

  <p>He drew a little breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"You realise, of course," he went on, "that there is only one man who
  could have placed them there?"</p>

  <p>"And who is that?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"And why do you single him out?"</p>

  <p>"Because," Crawshay told her patiently, "we had evidence in America to
  show that he was working with our enemies. It is true that he has not been
  associated to any extent with the German espionage system in America, but he
  has been well-known always as a reckless adventurer, ready to sell his life
  in any doubtful cause, so long as it promised excitement and profit. It was
  known to us that he had come into touch with a certain man in Washington who
  has been looking after the interests of his country in America. It was to
  shadow Jocelyn Thew that I came on this steamer. His friends cleverly fooled
  Hobson and me, and landed us in Chicago too late, as they thought, to catch
  the boat. That is why I made that somewhat melodramatic journey after you on
  the seaplane. Do please consider this matter reasonably, Miss Beverley. It
  was perfectly easy for him to slip across and place these things in your
  luggage as soon as he found that his original scheme was likely to go wrong.
  You were the one person on the steamer whom he reckoned would be safe from
  suspicion. You were part of his plot from the very first, and no more than
  that."</p>

  <p>"I cannot believe this," she said slowly.</p>

  <p>Crawshay's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"It is no business of mine, Miss Beverley," he declared, "but if you will
  forgive my saying so, you must be infatuated by this man. The evidence is
  perfectly clear. You are a prominent citizeness of a great country, and you
  have been made an accessory to an act of treason against that country. Yet,
  with plain facts in my hands, it seems impossible for me to shake your faith
  in this person. What is the reason of it? What hold had he upon you that he
  should have induced you to leave your work and your home and betray your
  country?"</p>

  <p>"He has no hold upon me at all," she replied indignantly. "Since you are
  so persistent, I will tell you the truth. I once saw him do a splendid thing,
  a deed which saved me from great unhappiness."</p>

  <p>"There we have it then at last!" Crawshay exclaimed eagerly. "You are
  under obligations to him."</p>

  <p>"I certainly am," she acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"And he has taken advantage of it," Crawshay continued, "to make you his
  tool."</p>

  <p>"Whatever he has done," she replied, "rests between Jocelyn Thew and me. I
  am not in the least disposed to excuse myself or to beg for mercy from you.
  If you represent the law, directly or indirectly, I do not ask for any
  favours. I shall be perfectly ready to go to your police station whenever I
  am sent for." There was a knock at the door. They both turned around. In
  reply to Katharine's mechanical "Come in," Jocelyn Thew entered.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "was I mistaken or did I hear my name?"</p>

  <p>"We were speaking of you," Crawshay admitted, turning towards him, "but I
  do not think that either Miss Beverley or I have anything to say to you at
  the moment."</p>

  <p>"That's rather a pity," was the cool reply, "because you may not see me
  again. I was looking for Miss Beverley, in fact, to say good-by. We are
  docking in half an hour, and those who have been searched can go on shore, if
  they like to leave their hold luggage. As I have been searched twice in the
  most thorough and effective fashion, I have my pass out."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you are going away altogether to-night?" Katharine
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Only so far as the Adelphi," he told her. "I have some friends to see who
  live near Liverpool, so I shall probably stay there for two or three
  days."</p>

  <p>"I was coming to look for you on deck presently," Crawshay intervened,
  "but if your departure is so imminent, I will say what I have to say to you
  here."</p>

  <p>"That would seem advisable," Jocelyn Thew agreed.</p>

  <p>"I think it is only right that you should know, sir," Crawshay continued,
  "that a very serious position has arisen here in which Miss Beverley is
  unfortunately involved. Incriminating documents have been found in her
  luggage, placed there obviously by some unscrupulous person, who was in
  search of a safe hiding-place."</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" Jocelyn Thew asked, looking past Crawshay to
  Katharine.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that it is," she assented.</p>

  <p>"The person who placed them there," Crawshay proceeded, the anger
  gathering in his tone, "may believe for the present that he has been able to
  escape from his dangerous position by this dastardly attempt to incriminate a
  woman. He may, on the other hand, find that his immunity will last but a very
  short time."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew nodded in calm acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"I am at a loss," he said, "to account for your somewhat melodramatic
  tone, but I really do not think that Miss Beverley has very much to
  fear."</p>

  <p>"There I agree with you," Crawshay declared. "She has not so much to fear
  as the criminal who is responsible for what has happened. He may think that
  he has escaped by saddling his crime upon a woman's shoulders. On the other
  hand, he may discover that this attempt, which only aggravates his position,
  will turn out to be futile."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew held out his hand towards Katharine.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "the tone of this conversation takes one back to the
  atmosphere of the dear old Drury Lane melodrama. I feel, somehow or other,"
  he went on, looking into Katharine's eyes, "that our friend here has cast me
  for the part of the villain and you for the injured heroine. I am wondering
  whether I dare ask you for a farewell greeting?"</p>

  <p>Katharine did not hesitate for a moment. Her shapely, ringless hand was
  grasped firmly by his brown, lean fingers. She felt the pressure of a signet
  ring, the slight tightening of his grip as he leaned a little towards her.
  Again she was conscious of that feeling of exuberant life and complete
  confidence which had transformed her whole and humiliating situation so short
  a time ago.</p>

  <p>"The injured heroine is always forgiving," she declared,&mdash;"even
  though she may have nothing to forgive. Good-by, Mr. Thew, and good fortune
  to you!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The morning&mdash;grey, slightly wet&mdash;broke upon
  Liverpool docks, the ugliest place in the ugliest city of Europe. A thin
  stream of people descended at irregular intervals down the gangway from the
  <i>City of Boston</i> to the dock, and disappeared in various directions.
  Amongst the first came a melancholy little procession&mdash;a coffin carried
  by two ship's stewards, with Doctor Gant in solitary attendance behind. After
  the passengers came a sprinkling of the ship's officers, all very smart and
  in a great hurry. Then there was a pause of several hours. About midday, two
  men&mdash;Brightman and a stranger&mdash;came down the covered way into the
  dock and boarded the steamer. They were shown at once into the captain's
  room, where Crawshay and Captain Jones were awaiting them.</p>

  <p>"This," Brightman said, introducing his companion, "is Mr. Andelsen. I was
  fortunate enough to find him on the point of leaving for London."</p>

  <p>Mr. Andelsen shook hands and accepted a chair. Upon the table in front of
  the captain was the sealed dispatch box. Crawshay had a suggestion to
  make.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that Miss Beverley should be here herself when this
  is opened."</p>

  <p>"I have no objection," Brightman assented.</p>

  <p>The captain rang for his steward and sent down a message. Mr.
  Andelsen&mdash;a tall, thin man, dressed in a sombre grey suit&mdash;handled
  the seals for a moment, looked at the address of the box, and shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I could not take upon myself the responsibility of opening this," he
  declared. "It is certainly the seal of the Embassy of my country, but the box
  is addressed specifically to our Foreign Secretary at the Capital."</p>

  <p>"We quite appreciate that," Crawshay admitted. "The captain, I believe, is
  not asking you to break it. We simply wish you to be present while we do so,
  in order to prove that no disrespect is intended to your country, and in
  order that you yourself may have an opportunity of taking a note of the
  contents."</p>

  <p>"So long as it is understood that I am only here as a witness," the consul
  acquiesced, a little doubtfully, "I am quite willing to remain."</p>

  <p>Katharine was presently ushered in. She was dressed for landing in a smart
  tailor-made suit, and her appearance was entirely cheerful. Crawshay stepped
  forward and handed her a chair.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," she said, "this all seems very formidable! Am I under arrest or
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"The captain is about to open the dispatch box found in your trunk, Miss
  Beverley," Crawshay explained, "in the presence of Mr. Andelsen here, who
  represents the country whose seals are attached. I have already expressed my
  opinion that this box has been surreptitiously placed amongst your
  belongings, and although, of course, our chief object was to gain possession
  of it, I regret very much the position in which you are placed."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Mr. Crawshay," she rejoined, without much feeling. "It
  is certainly a fact that I never saw the box before it was dragged out of my
  trunk yesterday."</p>

  <p>The captain broke the seals, untied the tape, and with a chisel and hammer
  knocked the top off the box. They all, with the exception of Katharine,
  gathered around him breathlessly as he shook out the contents on to the
  table. They were all sharers in the same shock of surprise as the neatly
  folded packets of ordinary writing paper were one by one disclosed. Crawshay
  seized one and dragged it to the light. The captain kept on picking them up
  and throwing them down again. Brightman mechanically followed his
  example.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing's a bluff!" Crawshay exclaimed. "These sheets of paper
  are all blank! There isn't any trace even of invisible ink."</p>

  <p>The consul rose to his feet with a heavy frown.</p>

  <p>"This is a very obvious practical joke," he said angrily. "It seems a pity
  that I should have been compelled to miss my train to town."</p>

  <p>"A practical joke!" the captain repeated. "If it is I'm damned if I
  understand the point of it!"</p>

  <p>"Give me the envelope which held the notes," Crawshay demanded.</p>

  <p>The captain unlocked his safe and produced it. Crawshay glanced through
  some of the documents hastily.</p>

  <p>"These are all bogus, too!" he exclaimed. "There are no such streets as
  this in New York&mdash;no such names. The whole thing's a sell!"</p>

  <p>"But what the&mdash;what in thunder does it all mean?" the captain
  demanded, pulling himself up as he glanced towards Katharine.</p>

  <p>Brightman, who had scarcely spoken a word, leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Probably," he said drily, "it means that some one a little cleverer than
  us has got away with the real stuff whilst we played around with this
  rubbish."</p>

  <p>"But how?" Crawshay expostulated. "Not a soul has left this ship who
  hasn't been searched to the skin. The luggage in the hold is going out trunk
  by trunk, after every cubic foot has been ransacked. We have had a guard at
  every gangway since we were docked."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. The ship's doctor entered. He glanced at
  the little company and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Captain," he said, "could I have a word with you?"</p>

  <p>The captain moved towards the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Ship's business, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"It's just a queer idea of mine about these papers," the doctor confessed.
  "It's perhaps scarcely worth mentioning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better come in and tell us about it," the captain insisted. "That's
  what we're all talking about at the present moment."</p>

  <p>Crawshay closed the door behind the newcomer, whose manner was still to
  some extent apologetic.</p>

  <p>"It's really rather a mad idea," the latter began, "and I understand you
  found a part of what you were searching for, at any rate. But you know the
  man Phillips, who'd been operated upon for appendicitis&mdash;your patient,
  Miss Beverley, who died during the voyage?"</p>

  <p>"What about him?" the captain demanded.</p>

  <p>"Just one thing," the Doctor continued. "There was no doubt whatever that
  he had been operated upon for appendicitis, there was no doubt about the
  complications, there was no doubt about his death. I helped Doctor
  Gant&mdash;who seemed a very reasonable person, and who is known to me as one
  of the physicians at Miss Beverley's hospital&mdash;in various small details,
  and at his request I went over the clothing of the dead man and even knocked
  the coffin to see that it hadn't a double bottom. Doctor Gant appeared to
  welcome investigation in every shape and form, and yet, now that it's all
  over, there is one curious thing which rather bothers me."</p>

  <p>"Get on with it, man," the captain admonished. "Can't you see that we're
  all in a fever about this business?"</p>

  <p>The doctor produced from his pocket a small strip of very fine quality
  bandaging.</p>

  <p>"It's just this," he explained. "They left this fragment of bandaging in
  the stateroom. Phillips was bound up with it around the wound, as was quite
  natural, but it isn't ordinary stuff, you see. It's made double like a tube,
  with silk inside. He must have had a dozen yards of this around his leg and
  side, which of course was not disturbed. It's a horrible idea to a layman, I
  know," he went on, turning apologetically to Katharine,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Captain, will you send at once for the steward," Crawshay interrupted,
  "who carried the coffin out?"</p>

  <p>The captain sent a message to the lower deck. Katharine was leaning a
  little forward, intensely interested.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, Miss Beverley, you can throw some light upon this?" the former
  enquired&mdash;"in your capacity as nurse, I mean."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that I cannot," she replied. "As a matter of fact, I was never
  allowed to touch the bandages. Doctor Gant did all that himself."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen any bandaging of this sort?" Brightman asked, showing
  her the fragment which he had taken from the doctor's fingers.</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>Crawshay drew a little breath between his teeth. He was on the point of
  speech when a steward knocked at the door. The captain called him in.</p>

  <p>"Harrison," he asked, "were you one of the stewards who was looking after
  Doctor Gant?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man replied.</p>

  <p>"You helped to carry the coffin out, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"That's so, sir. We were off at six o'clock this morning."</p>

  <p>"Was there a hearse waiting?"</p>

  <p>The steward shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There was a big motor car outside, sir. We put the coffin in that and the
  doctor drove off with it&mdash;said he was to take it down to the place where
  the man had lived, for burial."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where that was?"</p>

  <p>"No idea, sir."</p>

  <p>The captain glanced towards Brightman.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to ask the man any questions?"</p>

  <p>"Questions? No, sir!" the detective replied bitterly. "We've been
  done&mdash;that's all there is about it. Never mind, they've only got six
  hours' start. We'll have that car traced, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does any one know what time Mr. Jocelyn Thew left the steamer?" Crawshay
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"He got away last night," the steward replied. "There were three or four
  of them went up to the Adelphi to sleep. Some of them came back for their
  baggage this morning, but I haven't seen Mr. Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>Katharine rose to her feet. Her tone and expression were impenetrable.</p>

  <p>"Am I still suspect?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Crawshay glanced at Brightman, who shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There is no charge against you. Miss Beverley," he admitted stiffly. "So
  far as I am concerned, you are at liberty to leave the ship whenever you
  please."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand to the captain.</p>

  <p>"I can't make up my mind, Captain," she said, smiling at him delightfully,
  "as to what sort of a voyage I have had on this steamer, but I do
  congratulate you on that escape from the raider. Good-by!"</p>

  <p>Crawshay walked with her along the deserted deck as far as the
  gangway.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot offer my escort any further, Miss Beverley," he
  regretted. "I must have a little conversation with Brightman here."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered. "I quite understand. Perhaps we may meet in
  London. It seems a pity, doesn't it," she went on sympathetically, "that that
  wonderful voyage of yours was taken for nothing? Some one on this ship has
  been very clever indeed."</p>

  <p>"Some one has," Crawshay replied bitterly, "and you and I both know who it
  is, Miss Beverley. But," he went on, holding the gangway railing as she
  turned to descend, "it's only the first part of the game that's over. Our
  friend has won on the sea, but I have an idea that we shall have him on land.
  We shall have him yet, and we'll catch him red-handed if I have anything to
  do with it. Will you wish us luck?"</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at him. Her lips parted as though she were about to
  speak. Instead she broke into a little laugh, and, turning away, descended
  the gangway. From the dock she looked up again at Crawshay.</p>

  <p>"Do come and look me up if you are in town," she begged. "I shall stay at
  Claridge's, and I shall be interested to hear how you get on."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The <i>City of Boston</i> docked in Liverpool on Sunday
  night. On Tuesday, at five o'clock in the afternoon, Crawshay, who had been
  waiting at Euston Station for a quarter of an hour or so, almost dragged
  Brightman out of the long train which drew slowly into the station.</p>

  <p>"We'll take a taxi somewhere," the former said. "It's the safest place to
  talk in. Any other luggage?"</p>

  <p>"Only the bag I'm carrying," the detective replied. "I have got some more
  stuff coming up, if you want me to keep on this job."</p>

  <p>"I think I shall," Crawshay told him. "I want to hear how you got on. I
  gathered from your first telegram that you were on the track. Where did you
  mean to stay?"</p>

  <p>"I've no choice."</p>

  <p>"The Savoy, then," Crawshay decided. "Jocelyn Thew is staying there, and
  you may be able to keep an eye on him. Here we are.
  Taxi?&mdash;Savoy!&mdash;Now, Brightman."</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to make a long story of it, sir," Brightman observed,
  as they drove off.</p>

  <p>"Just the things that count, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Well, we got on the track of the car all right," the detective began,
  "and traced it to a small village called Frisby, the other side of Chester,
  and to the house of a Mrs. Phillips, a woman in poor circumstances who had
  just removed from Liverpool. She was the widow, all right. She showed us
  letters, and plenty of them, from her husband in New York. It appears that
  Gant alone had brought the coffin, which was left at the cemetery, and the
  funeral will have taken place t his afternoon. Mrs. Phillips was full of his
  praises, and it seems that he had paid her over the whole of the money you
  spoke about&mdash;five thousand dollars."</p>

  <p>"There was no chicanery so far, then," Crawshay observed. "The man was
  dead, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Brightman declared, "and his death seems to have taken place
  exactly according to the certificate. Here comes the point, however. With the
  aid of the local police and the doctor whom we called in, the bandage around
  the wound was removed. We found in its place a perfectly fresh one, bought in
  Liverpool, not in the least resembling the silk-lined fragment which the
  ship's doctor brought into the cabin."</p>

  <p>Crawshay looked gloomily out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Well, I imagine that that settles the question of how the papers got into
  England," he sighed.</p>

  <p>"Our job, I suppose," the detective reminded him, "is to see that they
  don't get out again."</p>

  <p>"Precisely!"</p>

  <p>"In a sense," Brightman continued, "that is a toughish job, isn't it,
  because whoever has them now can make as many copies as he chooses, and one
  set would be certain to get through."</p>

  <p>"As against that," Crawshay explained, "some of the most valuable
  documents are signed letters, of which only the originals would be worth
  anything. There are also some exceedingly complicated diagrams of New York
  harbours, a plan of all the battleships in existence and projected, a
  wonderful submarine destroyer, and a new heavy gun. These things are very
  complicated, and to carry conviction must be in the original. Besides that,"
  he added, dropping his voice, "there is the one most important thing of all,
  but of which as yet no one has spoken, and of which I dare scarcely speak
  even to you."</p>

  <p>"Is it in the shape of a drawing?" Brightman asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not," was the whispered reply. "It is a letter, written by the
  greatest man in one of the greatest countries in the world, to the greatest
  personage in Europe. There is a secret reward offered of half a million
  dollars for the return of that letter alone."</p>

  <p>"The affair seems worth looking into," Brightman remarked, stroking his
  little black moustache.</p>

  <p>"I can promise you that the governments on both sides will pay
  handsomely," Crawshay assured him. "I have had my chance but let it slip. You
  know I had my training at Scotland Yard, but out in the States I found that I
  simply had to forget all that I knew. Their methods are entirely different
  from ours, and you see what a failure I have made of it. I have let them get
  away with the papers under my very nose."</p>

  <p>"I can't see that you were very much to blame, Mr. Crawshay," the
  detective observed. "It was a unique trick, and very cleverly worked
  out."</p>

  <p>They had turned off the main thoroughfare and were now brought to a
  standstill in the courtyard leading to the Savoy. Suddenly Crawshay gripped
  his companion by the arm and directed his attention to a man who was buying
  some roses in the florist's shop.</p>

  <p>"You see that man?" he said. "Watch him carefully. I'll tell you why when
  we get inside."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Mr. Brightman and Jocelyn Thew met over the gorgeous cluster
  of red roses which the girl was in the act of removing from the window, and
  from that moment the struggle which was to come assumed a different
  character. Brightman's thin mouth seemed to have tightened until the line of
  red had almost disappeared. There was a flush upon his sallow cheeks. The
  hand which was gripping his walking stick went white about the knickles. But
  in Jocelyn Thew there was no change save a little added glitter in the eyes.
  There was nothing else to indicate that the recognition was mutual.</p>

  <p>"Well, what about him?" Brightman asked, as their taxicab moved on. "What
  does he call himself?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jocelyn Thew is his name," Crawshay replied. "He was on the steamer.
  It is he, and not Gant, whom we have to make for. The plot which we have to
  unravel, which Gant and Phillips, and, unwittingly, Miss Beverley carried
  through, was of his scheming."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jocelyn Thew," the detective repeated as they passed through the
  swing doors. "So that is how he calls himself now!"</p>

  <p>"You know him?"</p>

  <p>"Know him!" Brightman repeated bitterly. "The last time I saw him I could
  have sworn that I had him booked for Sing Sing prison. He got out of it, as
  he always has done. Some one else paid. It was the greatest failure I had
  when I was in the States. So he is in this thing, is he?"</p>

  <p>"He is not only very much in it," Crawshay replied, "but he is the brains
  of the whole expedition. He is the man to whom Gant delivered those documents
  some time last night."</p>

  <p>They found two easy-chairs in the smoking room and ordered cocktails. Mr.
  Brightman sat forward in his chair. He was one of those men whose
  individuality seems to rise to any call made upon it. He was indifferently
  dressed, by no means good-looking, and he had started life as a policeman.
  Just now, however, he seemed to sink quite naturally into his surroundings.
  Nothing about his appearance seemed worthy of note except the determination
  of his very dogged mouth.</p>

  <p>"I accepted your commission a short time ago, Mr. Crawshay," he said,
  "with the interest which one always feels in Government business of a
  remunerative character. I tell you now that I would have taken it on eagerly
  if there had not been a penny hanging to it. I can't tell you exactly why I
  feel so bitterly about him, but if I can really get my hands on to the man
  who calls himself Jocelyn Thew, it will be one of the happiest days of my
  life."</p>

  <p>"You really know something about him, then? He really is a bad lot?"
  Crawshay asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The worst that ever breathed," Brightman declared, "the bravest, coolest,
  best-bred scoundrel who ever mocked the guardians of the law. Mind you, I am
  not saying that he hasn't done other things. He has travelled and fought in
  many countries, but when he comes back to civilisation he can't rest. The
  world has to hear of him. Things move in New York underground. The moment he
  takes rooms at the Carlton-Ritz, things happen in a way that they have never
  happened before, and we know that there's genius at the back of it all, and
  Jocelyn Thew smiles in our faces. I tell you that if anything could have kept
  me in America, although I very much prefer Liverpool, the chance of laying my
  hands on this man would have done it."</p>

  <p>Through the swing doors, almost as Brightman had concluded his speech,
  came Jocelyn Thew. He was dressed in light tweeds, carefully fashioned by an
  English tailor. His tie and collar, his grey Homburg hat with its black band,
  his beautifully polished and not too new brown shoes, were exactly according
  to the decrees of Bond Street. He seemed to be making his way to the bar, but
  at the sight of them he paused and strolled across the room towards them.</p>

  <p>"Getting your land legs, Mr. Crawshay?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, thank you. You finished your business in Liverpool quickly,
  I see."</p>

  <p>"More urgent business brought me to London. I dined and spent last
  evening, by-the-by, with Doctor Gant&mdash;the doctor who was in attendance
  upon that poor fellow who died on the way over."</p>

  <p>"A very ingenious gentleman," Crawshay observed drily.</p>

  <p>"Ah! you appreciate that, do you?" Jocelyn Thew replied, with a faint
  smile. "You should go and cultivate his acquaintance. He is staying over at
  the Regent Palace Hotel."</p>

  <p>"One doesn't always attach oneself to the wrong person, Mr. Thew."</p>

  <p>"Even the stupidest people in the world," Jocelyn Thew agreed, "can
  scarcely make mistakes all the time, can they? By the way," he went on,
  turning towards the detective, "is it my fancy or have I not had the pleasure
  of meeting Mr. Brightman in America? I fancied so when I saw him board the
  steamer in the Mersey on Sunday, but it did not fall to my lot to receive the
  benefit of his offices."</p>

  <p>"I was just telling Mr. Crawshay that I had had the pleasure of
  professional dealings with you," Brightman said drily. "I was also lamenting
  the fact that they had not ended according to my desires."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brightman was always ambitious," the newcomer observed, with gentle
  satire. "He is, I am sure, a most persevering and intelligent member of his
  profession, but he flies high."</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged for your commendation," Brightman said bluntly. "As
  regards professions, I was just explaining to Mr. Crawshay that you were
  almost at the top of the tree in yours."</p>

  <p>"If you have discovered my profession," Jocelyn Thew replied, "you have
  succeeded where my dearest friends have failed. Pray do not make a secret of
  it, Mr. Brightman."</p>

  <p>"I have heard you called an adventurer," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"It is a term with which I will not quarrel," Jocelyn declared. "I
  certainly am one of those who appreciate adventures, who have no pleasure in
  sitting down in these grey-walled, fog-hung cities, and crawling about with
  one's nose on the pavements like a dog following an unclean smell. No, that
  has not been my life. I have sought fortune in most quarters of the globe,
  sometimes found it and sometimes lost it, sometimes with one weapon in my
  hand and sometimes with another. So perhaps you are right, Mr. Brightman,
  when you call me an adventurer."</p>

  <p>"These very uncomfortable times," Crawshay remarked, "rather limit the
  sphere in which one may look for stirring events."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong, believe me," Jocelyn Thew replied earnestly. "The stories
  of the Arabian Nights would seem tame, if one had the power of seeing what
  goes on around us in the most unsuspected places. But we are digressing. Mr.
  Brightman and I were speaking together. It occurred to me, from what he said,
  that he has not quite the right idea as to my aspirations, as to the place I
  desire to fill in life. I shall try to give him an opportunity to form a
  saner judgment."</p>

  <p>"It will give me the utmost pleasure to accept it," the detective
  confessed, with ill-concealed acerbity.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew sighed lightly. He had seated himself upon the arm of a
  neighbouring easy-chair and was resting his hand upon the head of a cane he
  was carrying.</p>

  <p>"If our friend Brightman here has a fault," he said, "in the execution of
  his daily duties, it is that he brings to bear into his task a certain amount
  of prejudice, from which the mind of the ideal detector of crime should be
  free. Now you would scarcely believe it, Mr. Crawshay, I am sure, to judge
  from his amiable exterior, but Mr. Brightman is capable of very strong
  dislikes, of one of which, alas! I am the object. Now this is not as it
  should be. You see what might happen, supposing Mr. Brightman were engaged to
  watch a little coterie, or, in plainer parlance, a little gang of supposed
  misdemeanants. If by any possible stretch of his imagination he could connect
  me with them, I should be the one he would go for all the time, and although
  I perhaps carry my fair burden of those peccadilloes to which the law,
  rightly or wrongly, takes exception, still, in this particular instance I
  might be the innocent one, and in Mr. Brightman's too great eagerness to
  fasten evil things upon me, the real culprit might escape.&mdash;Thank you,
  Mr. Crawshay," he added, accepting the cocktail which the waiter had
  presented. "Let us drink a little toast together. Shall we say 'Success to
  Mr. Brightman's latest enterprise, whatever it may be!'"</p>

  <p>Crawshay glanced at his companion.</p>

  <p>"I think we can humour our friend by drinking that toast, Brightman," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I shall drink it with great pleasure," the detective agreed.</p>

  <p>They set down their empty glasses. Jocelyn Thew rose regretfully to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I fear," he said, "that I must tear myself away. We shall meet again, I
  trust. And, Mr. Brightman, a word with you. If you are in town for a holiday,
  if you have no business to worry you just at present, why not practise on me
  for a time? Watch me. Find out the daily incidents of my life. See what
  company I keep, where I spend my spare time&mdash;you know&mdash;and all the
  rest of it. I can assure you that although I am not the great criminal you
  fancy me, I am a most interesting person to study. Take my advice, Mr.
  Brightman. Keep your eye upon me."</p>

  <p>They watched him on the way to the door&mdash;a little languid but
  exceedingly pleasant to look upon, exceedingly distinguished and
  prepossessing. A look of half unwilling admiration crept into Brightman's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Whatever that man really may be," he declared, "he is a great
  artist."</p>

  <p>The swing door leading from the room into the caf&eacute; was pushed open,
  and a woman entered. She stood for a moment looking around until her eyes
  fell upon Jocelyn Thew. Crawshay suddenly gripped the detective's arm.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything for us in this, my friend?" he whispered. "Watch
  Jocelyn Thew's face!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a few seconds Jocelyn Thew was certainly taken aback.
  His little start, his look of blank astonishment, were coupled with a certain
  loss of poise which Crawshay had been quick to note. But, after all, the
  interlude was brief enough.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what does this mean, Nora?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Her vivid brown eyes were fastened upon his face, eager to understand his
  attitude, a little defiant, a little appealing. There was nothing to be
  gathered from his expression, however. After that first moment he was
  entirely himself&mdash;well-mannered, unemotional, cold.</p>

  <p>"I came over on the <i>Baltic</i>," she explained, "I guessed I'd find you
  here. Fourteenth Street was getting a little sultry. The old man hopped it to
  San Francisco the day you left."</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he invited.</p>

  <p>They found places on a lounge and were served with cocktails. The girl
  sipped hers disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>"Rum stuff, this," she declared. "I guess I'll have to get my shaker
  out."</p>

  <p>"You are staying here, then?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she replied, with a faint note of truculence in her tone. "You
  know I'm not short of money, and I guessed it was where I should find
  you."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"That is very nice and companionable of you," he said, "and naturally I
  shall be very glad to be of any assistance possible whilst you are over here,
  but I hope you will remember, Nora, that I did not encourage you to
  come."</p>

  <p>"I'm wise enough about that," she admitted. "I never expected you to care
  two pins whether you ever saw me again or not, and I know quite well," she
  went on hastily, "that I haven't any right to follow you, or anything of that
  sort. But honestly, Mr. Thew, we were being watched down there, and New York
  wasn't exactly healthy."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he assented, "no doubt you are right. They have awkward methods of
  cross-examination there, although I don't think they'd get much out of you,
  Nora."</p>

  <p>"I'd no fancy to have them try," she admitted. "Besides, I've never had
  that trip to Europe that uncle and I were always talking about, and it seemed
  to me that if I wanted to see the old country whole, now or never was the
  time. You may all be a German colony over here by next year."</p>

  <p>"I have no right or any desire," he told her quietly, "to interfere in any
  way with your plans, but I must warn you that just at present I am living in
  the utmost jeopardy. I have no friends to whom I can introduce you, nor any
  of my own time or attentions to offer. Unless you choose to exercise tact, I
  might find your presence here not only embarrassing but a positive hindrance
  to my plans."</p>

  <p>"I guess I can lie close," she replied, looking at him through half-closed
  eyes. "Just how am I to size that up, though?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her appraisingly, a little cruelly. The effect of her
  beautiful figure was almost ruined by the cheap and unbecoming clothes in
  which she was attired. Her hat, with its huge hatpins and ultra-fashionable
  height, was hideous. She exuded perfumes. Her silk stockings and suede shoes
  were the only reasonable things about her. The former she was displaying with
  some recklessness as she leaned back upon the settee.</p>

  <p>"I once told you," he said calmly, "that there was no woman in the world
  for whom I felt the slightest affection."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"That is no longer the case."</p>

  <p>Her eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary for you to know," he answered coldly. "She happens,
  however, to be concerned in the business which I have on hand. She has been
  of great assistance to me, and she may yet be the means of helping me to
  final success. I cannot afford to have her upset by any false
  impressions."</p>

  <p>She looked at him almost wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"If you're not the limit!" she exclaimed. "Nothing matters to you except
  to succeed. You tell me in one breath that you care for a woman for the first
  time in your life, and in the next you speak of using her as your tool!"</p>

  <p>"You perhaps find that incomprehensible," he observed. "I do not blame
  you. At present, however, I have only one object in life, and that is to
  succeed in the business I have on hand. Whatever I may find it necessary to
  do to attain my ends, I shall do."</p>

  <p>She had gone a little pale, and her white teeth were holding down her full
  under lip.</p>

  <p>"Buy me another cocktail," she demanded.</p>

  <p>He obeyed, and she drank it at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"So you are not going to be nice to me?" she asked in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"That depends upon what you call nice," he answered. "I am rather up
  against a blank wall. Even if I succeed, I remain in this country at very
  considerable personal danger. I am not sure that even for your sake, Nora, it
  is well for you to associate with me. Why not go home? You'll find some of
  your people still there&mdash;and an old sweetheart or two, very likely."</p>

  <p>"It isn't a very warm welcome," she remarked, a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"You have taken me by surprise," he reminded her. "I had not the slightest
  idea of your coming."</p>

  <p>"I know that," she sighed. "I suppose I ought not to have hoped for
  anything more. You've never been any different to me than to any of the
  others. You treat us all, men and women, just alike. You are gracious or
  cold, just according to how much we can help. I sometimes wonder, Mr. Jocelyn
  Thew, whether you have a heart at all."</p>

  <p>For a single moment he looked at her kindly. His hand even patted hers. It
  was a curious revelation. He was a kindly ordinary human being.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Nora," he said, "I am not quite so bad as that! But for many years I
  have had a great, driving impulse inside me, and at the back of it the most
  wonderful incentive in all the world. You know what that is, Nora&mdash;or
  perhaps you don't. To a woman it would be love, I suppose. To a man it is
  hate."</p>

  <p>She drew a little further away from him, as though something which had
  flamed in his eyes for a moment had frightened her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she murmured, "you are like that."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew was himself again almost at once.</p>

  <p>"Since we understand one another, Nora," he said, a little more kindly,
  "let me tell you that I am really very glad to see you, although you did give
  me rather a shock just now. I want you, if you will, to turn your head to the
  left. You see those two men&mdash;one seated in the easy-chair and the other
  on its arm?"</p>

  <p>"I see them."</p>

  <p>"They are the two men," he continued, "who are out to spoil my show if
  they can. You may see them again under very different circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I shan't forget," she murmured. "The dark one looks like Brightman, the
  detective you were up against in that Fall River business&mdash;the man who
  believed that you were the High Priest of crime in New York."</p>

  <p>"You have a good memory," he remarked. "It is the same man."</p>

  <p>"And the other," she continued, with a sudden added interest in her
  tone&mdash;"Why, that's the Englishman who had me turned off from the hotel
  in Washington. Don't you remember, I went there for a month on trial as
  telephone operator, just before the election? You remember why. That
  Englishman was always dropping in. Used to bring me flowers now and then, but
  I felt certain from the first he was suspicious. He got me turned off just as
  things were getting interesting."</p>

  <p>"Right again," Jocelyn Thew told her. "His name is Crawshay. He is the man
  who was sent out from Scotland Yard to the English Embassy. He crossed with
  me on the steamer. We had our first little bout there."</p>

  <p>"Who won?"</p>

  <p>"The first trick fell to me," he acknowledged grimly.</p>

  <p>"And so will the second and the third," she murmured. "He may be brainy,
  though he doesn't look it with that monacle and the peering way he has, but
  you're too clever for them all, Jocelyn Thew. You'll win."</p>

  <p>He smiled very faintly.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "this time I have to win or throw in my chips. Now if you
  like we'll have some lunch, and afterwards, if you'll forgive my taking the
  liberty of mentioning it, you had better buy some clothes."</p>

  <p>"You don't like this black silk?" she asked wistfully. "I got it at a
  store up-town, and they told me these sort of skirts were all the rage over
  here."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can see for yourself they aren't," he remarked, a little drily.
  "London is a queer place in many ways, especially about clothes. You're
  either right or you're wrong, and you've got to be right, Nora. We'll see
  about it presently."</p>

  <p>They left the room together. Crawshay looked after them with interest.</p>

  <p>"This affair," he told his companion, "grows hourly more and more
  interesting. You've been up against Jocelyn Thew, you tell me. Well, I am
  perfectly certain that that girl, whose coming gave him such a start, was a
  young woman I had turned away from an hotel in Washington. She was in the
  game then&mdash;more locally, perhaps, but still in the same game. I used to
  sit and talk to her in the afternoons sometimes. Finest brown eyes I ever saw
  in my life. I wonder if there is anything between her and Jocelyn Thew," he
  added, looking through the door with a faintly disapproving note in his
  tone,&mdash;a note which a woman would have recognised at once as
  jealousy.</p>

  <p>"If you ask me, I should say no," the other answered. "I've kept tabs on
  Jocelyn Thew for a bit, and I've had his <i>dossier</i>. There's never been a
  woman's name mentioned in connection with him&mdash;don't seem as though he'd
  ever moved round or taken a meal with one all the time he was in New York. To
  tell you the truth, Mr. Crawshay, that's just what makes it so difficult to
  get your hands on a man you want. Nine times out of ten it's through the
  women we get home. The man who stands clear of them has an extra chance or
  two&mdash;Say, what time this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Come to my rooms at 178, St. James's Street, at seven o'clock," Crawshay
  directed. "I've a little investigation to make before then."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay took a taxicab from the Savoy to Claridge's Hotel,
  sent up his card and was conducted to Katharine Beverley's sitting room on
  the first floor. She kept him waiting for a few moments, and he felt a sudden
  instinct of curiosity as he noticed the great pile of red roses which a maid
  had only just finished arranging. When she came in, he looked towards her in
  surprise. She appeared to have grown thinner, and there were dark rims under
  her eyes. Her words of greeting were colourless. She seemed almost afraid to
  meet his steady gaze.</p>

  <p>"I ought to apologise for calling in the morning," he said, "but I
  ventured to do so, hoping that you would come out and have some lunch with
  me."</p>

  <p>"I really don't feel well enough," she replied. "London is not agreeing
  with me at all."</p>

  <p>"You are ill?" he exclaimed, with some concern.</p>

  <p>She looked at the closed door through which the maid had issued.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly ill. I have some anxieties," she answered. "It is kind of you
  to keep your promise and come. Please tell me exactly what happened? You know
  how interested I am."</p>

  <p>"I have unfortunately nothing to report but failure," he replied.
  "Everything seems to have happened exactly as the doctor on the ship
  suggested. The detectives at Liverpool were quite smart. We were able to
  trace the car without much difficulty, and the body of your patient Phillips
  was found at his home, the other side of Chester. We obtained permission to
  make an examination, and we found that, just as we expected, fresh bandages
  had been put on only a few hours previously."</p>

  <p>"And Doctor Gant?"</p>

  <p>"He is at an hotel in London. He is watched night and day, but he seems to
  divide his time between genuine sight-seeing and trying to arrange for his
  passage home. Naturally, the whole of his effects have been searched, but
  without the slightest result."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and Mr. Jocelyn Thew?"</p>

  <p>"His business in Liverpool seems to have detained him a very short time.
  He is staying now at the Savoy Hotel. Needless to say, his effects too have
  been thoroughly searched, without result."</p>

  <p>"You know that he sent me these?" she asked, glancing towards the
  roses.</p>

  <p>"I saw him buying them."</p>

  <p>Her fingers had strayed over one of the blossoms, and he noticed that
  while they talked she was convulsively crushing it into pulp.</p>

  <p>"Were these detectives from Liverpool," she asked, "able to keep any watch
  upon Doctor Gant and Mr. Jocelyn Thew after&mdash;Chester?"</p>

  <p>"To some extent. There is no doubt that Jocelyn Thew spent the first night
  in Liverpool. After that he travelled to London and took up his residence at
  the Savoy. Here Doctor Gant, who had travelled up from Chester, called upon
  him, late in the afternoon of the day of his arrival. They spent some time
  together, and subsequently the doctor took a room at the Regent Palace Hotel.
  The two men dined together at the Savoy grill, and took a box at the Alhambra
  music-hall, where they spent the evening. They appear to have returned to
  Jocelyn Thew's rooms, had a whisky and soda each and separated. There is no
  record of their having spoken to any other person or visited any other
  place."</p>

  <p>"And their rooms have been searched?"</p>

  <p>"By the most skilled men we have."</p>

  <p>She pulled another of the roses to pieces.</p>

  <p>"So it comes to this," she said. "All these documents, of whose existence
  both you and the American police knew, have been brought from America to
  England, and even now you cannot locate them."</p>

  <p>"At present we cannot," he confessed drily, "but I am not prepared to
  admit for a single moment that they are ever likely to reach their
  destination."</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew is very clever," she reminded him calmly.</p>

  <p>"I am tired of being told so," he replied, with a touch of irritation in
  his tone.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"You probably need your luncheon! If you care to come downstairs with me,"
  she invited, "we can finish our conversation."</p>

  <p>"I shall be only too pleased."</p>

  <p>Katharine Beverley's table was in a quiet corner, and she sat with her
  back to the window, but even under such circumstances the change in her
  during the last few days was noticeable. There was a frightened light in her
  eyes, her cheeks were entirely colourless, her hands seemed almost
  transparent. Such a change in so short a time seemed almost incredible.
  Crawshay found himself unable to ignore it.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to see you looking so unwell," he observed
  sympathetically. "I am afraid the shock of your voyage across the Atlantic
  has been too much for you."</p>

  <p>"I am terribly disturbed," she confessed. "I am disappointed, too, in Mr.
  Jocelyn Thew. One hates to be made use of so flagrantly."</p>

  <p>"You really knew nothing, then, until those things were discovered in your
  stateroom?"</p>

  <p>"That question," she replied, "I am not going to answer."</p>

  <p>"But the main part of the plot?" he persisted, "the bandages?"</p>

  <p>"Doctor Gant never allowed me to touch them. That is what I found so
  inexplicable,&mdash;what first set me wondering."</p>

  <p>"The whole scheme was very cleverly thought out," Crawshay pronounced,
  "but if you will forgive my repeating a previous speculation, Miss Beverley,
  the greatest mystery about it all, to me, is how you, Miss Katharine
  Beverley, whose name and reputation in New York stands so high, were induced
  to leave your work, your social engagements and your home, at a time like
  this, when your country really has claims upon you, to act as ordinary sick
  nurse to a New York clerk of humble means who turns out to have been nothing
  but the tool of Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"I am still unable to explain that," she told him.</p>

  <p>He realised the state of tension in which she was and suddenly abandoned
  the whole subject. He spoke of the theatres, asked of her friends in town,
  discussed the news of the day, and made no further allusion of any sort to
  the mystery which surrounded them. It was not until after they had been
  served with their coffee in the lounge that he reverted to more serious
  matters.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley," he said, "for your own sake I am exceedingly unwilling to
  leave you like this. I may seem to you to be an inquisitor, but believe me I
  am a friendly one. I cannot see that you have anything to lose in being frank
  with me. I wish to help you. I wish to relieve the anxiety from which I know
  that you are suffering. Give me your confidence."</p>

  <p>"You ask a very difficult thing," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Difficult but not impossible," he insisted. "I can quite understand that
  your discovery of the fact that you had been made use of to assist in the
  bringing to England of treasonable documents is of itself likely to be a
  severe shock to you, but, if you will permit me to say so, it is not
  sufficient to account for your present state of nerves."</p>

  <p>"You don't know all that is happening," she replied, in some agitation.
  "There is a very astute lady detective who has a room near mine, and a man
  who shadows me every time I come in or go out. I am expecting every moment
  that the manager will ask me to leave the hotel."</p>

  <p>"That is all very annoying, of course," he acknowledged sympathetically,
  "and yet I believe that at the back of your head there is still something
  else troubling you."</p>

  <p>"You are very observant," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"In your case," he replied, "close observation is scarcely necessary. Why,
  it is only four days since we left the steamer, and you look simply the wreck
  of yourself."</p>

  <p>"A great deal has happened since then," she confessed.</p>

  <p>He seized upon the admission.</p>

  <p>"You see, I was right.&mdash;There is something else! Miss Beverley, I am
  your friend. You must confide in me."</p>

  <p>"It would be useless," she assured him sadly.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be sure of that," he insisted. "If this espionage gets on your
  nerves, I believe that I have influence enough to have it removed, provided
  that you will let me bring a friend of mine to see you here and ask you a few
  questions."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is not the espionage alone," she declared. "I am confronted with
  something altogether different, something about which I cannot speak."</p>

  <p>"Is this man Jocelyn Thew connected with it in any way?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She winced.</p>

  <p>"Why should you ask that question?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is perfectly clear," he continued, "that Jocelyn Thew
  exercises some sort of unholy influence over you, an influence, I may add,
  which it is my intention to destroy."</p>

  <p>She smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"If you can destroy anything that Jocelyn Thew means to keep alive," she
  began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't believe that Jocelyn Thew is infallible," he
  interrupted. "I have had a long experience of diplomatists and plotters and
  even criminals, and I can assure you that no man breathing is possessed of
  more than ordinary human powers. Jocelyn Thew has brought it off against us
  this time, but then, you see, one must lose a trick now and then. It is the
  next step which counts."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the next step will be all right!" she replied, with a hard little
  laugh. "He has brought his spoils to England, although there must have been
  twenty or thirty detectives on board, and you won't be able to stop his
  disposing of them exactly as he likes."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you," he assured her confidently. "That, however, is
  not what I want to talk about. You are in a false position. In the struggle
  which is going on now, your heart and soul should be with us and against
  Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were lit with a momentary terror.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose for a moment," she said, "that my sympathies are not
  with my own country and our joint cause?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," he replied. "On the other hand, your actions should follow upon
  your sympathies. There is something sinister in your present state. I want
  you to tell me just what the terror is that is sitting in your heart, that
  has changed you like this. Jocelyn Thew has some hold upon you. If so, you
  need a man to stand by your side. Can't you treat me as a friend?"</p>

  <p>She softened at his words. For a moment she sat quite silent.</p>

  <p>"I can only repeat to you what I told you once before," she said. "If you
  are picturing Jocelyn Thew to yourself as a blackmailer, or anything of that
  sort, you are wrong. I am under the very deepest obligations to him."</p>

  <p>"But surely," he protested, "you have paid your debt, whatever it
  was?"</p>

  <p>"He admits it."</p>

  <p>"And yet the terror remains?"</p>

  <p>"It remains," she repeated sadly.</p>

  <p>Crawshay meditated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Miss Beverley," he said, "I have a friend who is chief in this
  country of a department which I will not name. Will you dine with me to-night
  and let me invite him to meet you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is a very kind thought," she declared, "but I am engaged. Mr. Jocelyn
  Thew is dining here."</p>

  <p>Crawshay's face for a moment was very black indeed. He rose slowly to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I know that you mean to be kind," she continued, "and I fear that I must
  seem very ungrateful. Believe me, I am not. I am simply faced with one of
  those terrible problems which must be solved, and yet which admit of no help
  from any living person."</p>

  <p>Crawshay's attitude had grown perceptibly stiffer.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry indeed, Miss Beverley," he said, "that you cannot give me
  your confidence. I am very sorry for my own sake, and I am sorry for
  yours."</p>

  <p>"Is that a threat?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You know the old proverb," he answered, as he bowed over her fingers.
  "'Those who are not on my side are against me.'"</p>

  <p>"You are going to treat me as an enemy?"</p>

  <p>"Until you prove yourself to be a friend."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At a quarter to eight that evening, a young man who had made
  fitful appearances in the lounge of Claridge's Restaurant during the last
  half-hour went to the telephone and rang up a certain West End number.</p>

  <p>"Are these Mr. Crawshay's rooms?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crawshay speaking," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Brightman there?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay turned away from the telephone and handed the receiver to the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"What news, Henshaw?" the latter enquired.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley dines at her usual table, sir, at eight o'clock," was the
  reply. "The table is set for three."</p>

  <p>"For three?" Brightman exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"For three?" Crawshay echoed, turning from the sideboard, where he had
  been in the act of mixing some cocktails.</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure the third place isn't a mistake?" Brightman asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure, sir," was the prompt reply. "I am acquainted with one of the
  head waiters here, and I understand that two gentlemen are expected."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir. Miss Beverley sent away two parcels this afternoon, which
  were searched downstairs. They were quite unimportant."</p>

  <p>"I shall expect to hear from you again," Brightman directed, "within half
  an hour. If the third person is a stranger, try and find out his name."</p>

  <p>"I'll manage that all right, Mr. Brightman. The young lady has just come
  down. I'll be getting back into the lounge."</p>

  <p>Brightman turned around to Crawshay, who was in the act of shaking the
  cocktails.</p>

  <p>"A third party," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Interesting," Crawshay declared, "very interesting! Perhaps the
  intermediary. It might possibly be Doctor Gant, though."</p>

  <p>The detective shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Three quarters of an hour ago," he said, "Doctor Gant went into Gatti's
  for a chop. He was quite alone and in morning clothes."</p>

  <p>Crawshay poured the amber-coloured liquid which he had been shaking into a
  frosted glass, handed it to his companion and filled one for himself.</p>

  <p>"Here's hell to Jocelyn Thew, anyway!" he exclaimed, with a note of real
  feeling in his tone.</p>

  <p>"If I thought," Brightman declared, "that drinking that toast would bring
  him any nearer to it, I should become a confirmed drunkard. As it is,
  sir&mdash;my congratulations! A very excellent mixture!"</p>

  <p>He set down his glass empty and Crawshay turned away to light a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"No," he decided, "I don't think that it would be Doctor Gant. Jocelyn
  Thew has finished with him all right. He did his job well and faithfully, but
  he was only a hired tool. Speculation, however, is useless. We must wait for
  Henshaw's news. Perhaps this third guest, whoever he may be, may give us a
  clue as to Jocelyn Thew's influence over Miss Beverley."</p>

  <p>The telephone rang a few minutes later. Crawshay this time took up the
  receiver, and Brightman the spare one which hung by the side. It was Henshaw
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Miss Beverley has just gone in to dinner," he announced. "She is
  accompanied by Mr. Jocelyn Thew and a young officer in the uniform of a
  Flight Commander."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?" Crawshay asked.</p>

  <p>"I have had no opportunity of finding out yet," was the reply. "I believe
  that he is staying in the hotel, and he seems to be on very intimate terms
  with Miss Beverley."</p>

  <p>"On no account lose sight of the party," Crawshay directed, "and try and
  find out the young soldier's name. Wasn't he introduced to Jocelyn Thew?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," was the prompt reply. "They shook hands very much like
  old friends."</p>

  <p>"Go back and watch," Crawshay directed. "I must know his name. The sooner
  you can find out, the better. I want to get away within a few minutes, if I
  can."</p>

  <p>They left the instrument. Crawshay, who seemed a little nervous, took a
  cigarette from an open box which he passed across to his companion, and
  strolled up and down the room for a few moments with his hands in his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"A young officer," he remarked, "presumably English, known to both Miss
  Beverley and Jocelyn Thew, seems rather a puzzle. He may be the connecting
  link. I hope to goodness your man won't be long, Brightman."</p>

  <p>"Are you in a hurry?" the detective asked.</p>

  <p>Crawshay nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want to get round to the Savoy," he announced.</p>

  <p>Brightman smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Were you thinking about the young lady, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I thought it might be useful to renew my acquaintance with her," Crawshay
  explained, a little laboriously. "I shouldn't think she'd go out alone."</p>

  <p>"She has probably made some friends by this time," Brightman observed.</p>

  <p>Crawshay dropped his eyeglass and polished it.</p>

  <p>"From my experience of the young lady," he said, a little stiffly, "I
  should think it improbable. I happened to meet her twice in New York, and she
  struck me as being an extraordinarily well-behaved and, in her natural way,
  very attractive person."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose that she came to Europe after Jocelyn Thew?" Brightman
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn Jocelyn Thew!" Crawshay replied. "I should think it most
  unlikely. You and I have both seen the man's <i>dossier</i>. Most
  cold-blooded person alive."</p>

  <p>The telephone broke in once more upon their conversation. Crawshay took up
  the receiver. It was Henshaw speaking.</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake about the uniform, sir," he announced. "The young man is
  in the Canadian Flying Corps and he is the young lady's brother. He is called
  Captain Beverley."</p>

  <p>"Her brother!" Crawshay exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"The connecting link!" Brightman murmured.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the little dinner at Claridge's, of which sketchy tidings were
  being conveyed to the two occupants of Crawshay's flat by Henshaw, was
  settling down, so far as the two men were concerned, into a cheery enough
  meal. There had been a little strangeness at first, but Jocelyn Thew's hearty
  welcome of his young friend, and his genuine pleasure at seeing him, had
  quickly broken the ice. Katharine, however, although she had a shade more
  colour than earlier in the day, had sometimes the air of a Banquo at the
  feast. She listened almost feverishly to Jocelyn Thew, whenever he seemed
  inclined to turn the conversation into a certain channel, and she watched her
  brother a little anxiously as the waiter filled up his glass, unchecked,
  every few minutes. The likeness between the two was apparent enough, although
  marked by certain differences. Beverley was tall, of exceedingly powerful
  build, and with a fresh, strong face which would have been remarkably
  attractive but for the weak mouth and the slightly puffy cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I can't conceive anything more fortunate than this meeting," Jocelyn Thew
  declared, as he inspected the cigars which had been brought round to him,
  with the air of a connoisseur. "Quite an extraordinary coincidence, too, that
  you should turn up in London on five days' leave, the very day that your
  sister arrives from the States. Tell me, are you right up at the front?"</p>

  <p>"Right beyond it, most days," was the cheerful reply. "We spend most of
  our time over the German lines."</p>

  <p>"Lucky fellow!" Jocelyn Thew sighed. "You are getting now what a few years
  ago one had to defy the law for&mdash;real, thrilling sensations. It's a life
  for men, yours."</p>

  <p>The young man's hand shook a little as he raised his glass. He looked
  towards Jocelyn Thew almost appealingly.</p>

  <p>"It's a splendid life," he assented, talking rapidly and with the air of
  one who wishes to stifle conversation. "I had hard work to get my wings, but
  I guess I'm all right now. The engine part of it never gave me any trouble,
  but I suffered from a kind of sickness the first few times I went up. It's a
  gorgeous sensation, flying. The worst of it is we never know when those
  cunning Germans aren't coming out with something fresh. They stung us up last
  week with a dozen planes of an entirely new pattern, two hundred and fifty
  horse-power engines on a small frame. Gee, they gave some of our elderly
  machines a touching up, I can tell you!"</p>

  <p>"So you fly over the German lines most days, eh?" Jocelyn Thew
  ruminated.</p>

  <p>"We dropped a few thousand copies of the President's speech last Monday,"
  the young man told them. "That ought to give them something to think about.
  They only know just what they are told. The last batch of prisoners that were
  brought in firmly believed that one of their armies had landed in England and
  that London was on the point of falling."</p>

  <p>"All war," Jocelyn Thew said didactically, "is carried on under a cloud of
  misconception."</p>

  <p>The young man stretched himself out. He had dined well and his courage was
  returning. He asked a question which up till then he had felt inclined to
  shirk.</p>

  <p>"What licks me," he declared suddenly, "is finding you two over here. What
  ever brought you across, Katharine?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Katharine seemed uncertain how to answer. It
  was Jocelyn Thew who took up the challenge.</p>

  <p>"A little over a fortnight ago," he explained, "I called upon your sister
  in New York. I begged her to perform a certain service for me. She consented.
  The execution of that service brought her across from New York on board the
  <i>City of Boston</i>."</p>

  <p>"But have you two been seeing anything of one another, then? You never
  mentioned Thew in any of your letters, Katharine?"</p>

  <p>"Your sister and I have not met since a certain memorable occasion,"
  Jocelyn Thew replied.</p>

  <p>The young man shivered and drained his glass.</p>

  <p>"What was this service?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Your sister played sick nurse upon the steamer to a person in whom I was
  interested, and who was operated upon in her hospital," Jocelyn Thew
  explained. "He was an Englishman, and very anxious to reach his own country
  before he died."</p>

  <p>"I can't quite catch on to it," Beverley admitted.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew glanced carelessly around. His manner was the reverse of
  suspicious, but he only resumed his speech when he was sure that not even a
  waiter was within hearing.</p>

  <p>"It happened to form part of an important plan of mine," he said, "that a
  man who was dangerously ill should be brought over to England without raising
  any suspicion as to his <i>bona fides</i>. I made use of your sister's name
  and social position to ensure this. There has been, as I think you have often
  acknowledged, Beverley, a debt owing from you to me. Half of that debt your
  sister has paid."</p>

  <p>"You haven't been getting Katharine mixed up in any crooked business?" her
  brother demanded excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Your sister ran no risk whatever," Jocelyn Thew assured him. "She
  performed her share of the bargain excellently. It is just possible," he
  continued, with a glint of fire in his eyes and a peculiar, cold emphasis
  creeping into his words, "that it may fall to your lot to wipe out the
  remainder of the debt."</p>

  <p>Beverley moved in his chair uneasily.</p>

  <p>"You will remember," he said, "that things have changed. I am not a free
  agent now. I entered upon this fighting business as an adventure, but, my
  God, Thew, it's got into my blood! I've seen things, felt things. I don't
  want anything to come between me and the glorious life I live day by
  day."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"That's the proper spirit, Beverley," he declared. "I always knew you had
  pluck. Quite the proper spirit! Your sister showed the same courage when the
  necessity came."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't bring me into this, please!" she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have been brought into it," her brother observed grimly, "and
  I'm not sure that I am satisfied. I can pay my own debts."</p>

  <p>There was a note of rising anger in his tone. Katharine laid her fingers
  upon his hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't imagine things, please, Dick," she begged. "It is my own
  foolishness if I am disturbed. I really had nothing to do. Mr. Thew has been
  most considerate."</p>

  <p>"In any case," Jocelyn Thew went on, "I think that the matter had better
  be discussed another time, when we are alone. We might have to make reference
  to things which are best not mentioned in a public place."</p>

  <p>For a moment the young man's eyes challenged his. Then they fell. He
  shivered a little.</p>

  <p>"Why ever speak of them?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, we'll see," Jocelyn Thew observed. "Now what about an hour or
  two at a music-hall? I have a box at the Alhambra."</p>

  <p>Katharine rose at once to her feet. They all made their way into the
  lounge. Whilst they waited for her to fetch her cloak, Beverley swung round
  to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "for myself it doesn't matter&mdash;you know
  that&mdash;but what game are you playing? I don't know much about your life,
  of course, before those few days, but on your own showing you were out for
  big things. Are you known here? Is it anything&mdash;anything against the
  law, this business you're on? I don't care for myself&mdash;you know that.
  It's Katharine I'm thinking of."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew knocked the ash from his cigar. He smiled deprecatingly at
  his companion. Certainly there was no man in that very fashionable restaurant
  who looked less like a criminal.</p>

  <p>"My dear Beverley," he expostulated, "you must remember that I am an
  exceedingly clever person. I am suspected of any number of misdemeanours. I
  will not say that there are not one or two of which I have not been guilty,
  but I have never left behind me any proof. I dare say the English police over
  here look on me sometimes just as hungrily as the New York ones. They feel in
  their hearts that I am an adventurer. They feel that I have been connected
  with some curious enterprises, both in the States and various other countries
  of the globe. They know very well that where there has been fighting and loot
  and danger, I have generally followed under my own flag. They know all this,
  but they can prove nothing against me. They can only watch me, and that they
  do wherever I am. They are watching me now, every hour of the day."</p>

  <p>"It isn't," the young man commenced, with a sudden break in his
  tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, my young friend," he said, "the curtain fell upon that little
  episode. I doubt whether there is even a police record of it. It isn't the
  lives of individuals I am juggling with to-day. It's the life of a
  nation."</p>

  <p>"Are you a spy?" Beverley asked him hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Your sister," Jocelyn Thew pointed out, "is waiting for us."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay, having the good fortune to find, as he issued from
  his rooms, a taxicab whose driver's ideas of speed were in accordance with
  his own impatience, managed to reach the Savoy at a few minutes before eight.
  He entered the hotel by the Court entrance. An insignificant-looking young
  man with a fair moustache and watery eyes touched him on the shoulder as he
  passed through the Court lobby. Crawshay glanced lazily around and assured
  himself that they were unobserved.</p>

  <p>"Anything fresh?" he asked laconically.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. We have searched Miss Sharey's rooms thoroughly, and two of our
  men have been over Thew's apartments again."</p>

  <p>"Miss Sharey up-stairs?"</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't been up for some hours," he reported.</p>

  <p>Crawshay nodded and strolled on. He left his coat and hat in charge of the
  attendant, and entered the grill room. Here, however, he met with
  disappointment. The place was crowded but his search was methodical. There
  was no sign there of Nora Sharey. He climbed the few stairs and entered the
  smoking room. Seated in an armchair, reading a novel, he discovered the young
  lady of whom he was in search.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room at a slow saunter, as though on his way to the bar,
  and paused before the girl's chair. She laid down her book and looked up at
  him. Her smile at once assured him of a welcome.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that I am not altogether forgotten, Miss Sharey," he said,
  holding out his hand which she promptly accepted. "I suppose it still is Miss
  Sharey, is it? I hope so."</p>

  <p>"I guess the name's all right," she replied. "Glad to see you don't bear
  any ill-will against me, Mr. Crawshay. You Englishmen sometimes get so
  peevish when things don't go quite your way, and you weren't saying nice
  things to me last time we met."</p>

  <p>Crawshay smiled and glanced at the seat by her side. She made room for
  him, and he subsided into the vacant space with a little sigh of content.</p>

  <p>"A man's profession," he confided, "sometimes makes large and repugnant
  demands upon him."</p>

  <p>"If that means you are sorry you were rude to me last time we met down in
  Fourteenth Street," she said, "I guess I may as well accept your apology. You
  were a trifle disappointed then, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"We acted," Crawshay explained, with studied laboriousness,&mdash;"my
  friends and I acted, that is to say&mdash;upon inconclusive information.
  America at that time, you see, was a neutral Power, and the facilities
  granted us by the New York police were limited in their character. My
  department was thoroughly convinced that the&mdash;er&mdash;restaurant of
  which your father was the proprietor was something more than the ordinary
  meeting place of that section of your country-people who carried their enmity
  towards my country to an unreasonable extent."</p>

  <p>She looked at him admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Say, you know how to talk!" she observed. "What about getting an innocent
  girl turned out of a job at Washington, though?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay stroked his long chin reflectively.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't yarn!" she interrupted. "I'm not squealing. You knew very well
  that I'd no need to take a post as telephone operator, and you did your duty
  when you got me turned off. It was very clever of you," she went on, "to
  tumble to me."</p>

  <p>Crawshay accepted the compliment with a smile.</p>

  <p>"If you will permit me to say so, Miss Sharey," he declared, "you are what
  we call in this country a good sportsman."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can keep on the tracks all right," she assented. "I guess I am a
  little easier to deal with, for instance, than your friend Mr. Jocelyn
  Thew."</p>

  <p>Crawshay frowned. His expression became gloomier.</p>

  <p>"I am bound to confess, Miss Sharey," he sighed, "that your friend Mr.
  Jocelyn Thew has been the disappointment of my life."</p>

  <p>"Some brains, eh?"</p>

  <p>"He has brains, courage and luck," Crawshay pronounced. "Against these
  three things it is very hard work to bring off&mdash;shall I say a
  <i>coup</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The man who gets the better of Jocelyn Thew," she declared, with a little
  laugh, "deserves all the nuts. He is a sure winner every time. You're up
  against him now, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"More or less," Crawshay confessed. "I crossed on the steamer with
  him."</p>

  <p>"I bet that didn't do you much good!"</p>

  <p>"I lost the first game," Crawshay confessed candidly. "I see that you know
  all about it."</p>

  <p>"No need to put me wiser than I am," the girl observed carelessly.
  "Jocelyn Thew's no talker."</p>

  <p>"Not unless it serves his purpose. It is astonishing," Crawshay went on
  reflectively, "how the science of detection has changed during the last ten
  years. When I was an apprentice at it&mdash;and though you may not think it.
  Miss Sharey, I am a professional, not an amateur, although I am generally
  employed on Government business&mdash;secrecy was our watchword. We hid in
  corners, we were stealthy, we always posed as being something we weren't. We
  should have denied emphatically having the slightest interest in the person
  under surveillance. In these days, however, everything is changed. We play
  the game with the cards upon the table&mdash;all except the last two or
  three, perhaps&mdash;and curiously enough, I am not at all sure that it
  doesn't add finesse to the game."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"You're dead right," she acknowledged. "Take us two, for instance. You
  know very well that Jocelyn Thew is a pal of mine. You know very well that I
  shall see him within the next twenty-four hours. You know very well that
  you're out to hunt him to the death, and you know that I know it. Every
  question you ask me has a purpose, yet we talk here just as chance
  acquaintances might&mdash;I, a girl whom you rather like the look
  of&mdash;you do like the look of me, don't you, Mr. Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay had no need to be subtle. His eyes and tone betrayed his
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"I have thoroughly disliked you ever since you were too clever for me in
  New York," he confessed, "and I have been in love with you all the time."</p>

  <p>"And you," she continued, with a little gleam of appreciation in her eyes,
  "are a very pleasant-looking, smart, agreeable Englishman, who looks as
  though he knew almost enough to ask a poor girl out to dinner."</p>

  <p>Crawshay glanced at his wrist watch.</p>

  <p>"It is you who have the science of detection," he declared. "You have read
  my thoughts. Do you wish to change your clothes first, or shall we turn in at
  a grill room?"</p>

  <p>She rose promptly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I'm all for the glad rags," she insisted. "I bought a heap of clothes in
  Bond Street this afternoon, and I don't know how many chances I shall have of
  wearing them. I am a quick dresser, and I shan't keep you more than a quarter
  of an hour. But just one moment first."</p>

  <p>Crawshay stood attentively by her side.</p>

  <p>"I am at your service," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"It's all in the game," she went on, "for you to take me out to dinner, of
  course, but I guess I needn't tell you that there's nothing doing in the
  information way. You've fixed it up in your mind, I dare say, that I am mad
  with Jocelyn Thew. I may be or I may not, but that doesn't make me any the
  more likely to come in on your side of the game."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crawshay's gesture was entirely convincing.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Sharey," he said softly, "I am going to take a holiday.
  Business is one thing and pleasure is another. For this evening I am going to
  put business out of my mind. The sentiment at which I hinted a few moments
  ago, has, I can assure you, a very real existence."</p>

  <p>"Hinted?" she laughed. "Guess there wasn't much hint about it. You said
  you were in love with me."</p>

  <p>"I am," Crawshay sighed.</p>

  <p>Her eyes danced joyously.</p>

  <p>"You shall tell me all about it over dinner," she declared. "I've got a
  peach of a black gown&mdash;you won't mind if I am twenty minutes?"</p>

  <p>"I shall mind every moment that you are away," Crawshay replied, "but I
  can pass the time. I will telephone and have a cocktail."</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"I can guess whom you are going to telephone to."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;but not what I am going to say."</p>

  <p>"You are going to telephone to that chap with the dark
  moustache&mdash;Brightman, isn't it? I can hear you on the wire. 'Say, boys,'
  you'll begin, 'I'm on to a good thing! Everything's looking lovely. I'm
  taking little Nora Sharey, of Fourteenth Street, out to dine&mdash;girl who
  came over to Europe after Jocelyn Thew, you know. Good business, eh?'"</p>

  <p>Crawshay laughed tolerantly. The girl's humour pleased him.</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," he declared. "If I told them that, they'd expect
  something from me which I know I shan't get. You are right about the person,
  though. I am going to telephone to Brightman."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to say?" she challenged him.</p>

  <p>"I am just going to tell him," Crawshay confided, "that Jocelyn Thew is
  dining with Miss Beverley and her brother, more red roses and a corner table
  in the restaurant, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what else?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said, "if I went on I might put just one card too many on
  the table, eh?"</p>

  <p>"We'll let it go at that, then," she decided. "After all, you know, I am
  not coming exactly like a lamb to the slaughter. There are a few things you'd
  like to get to know from me about Jocelyn Thew, but there are also a few
  things I should like to worm out of you. We'll see which wins. And, Mr.
  Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"Miss Sharey?" he murmured, bending down to her as he held the door
  open.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind confessing that it depends a great deal upon what brand of
  champagne you fancy."</p>

  <p>"<i>Mum cordon rouge</i>?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace as she turned away.</p>

  <p>"I am rather beginning to fancy your chance," she declared.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay, about half an hour later, piloted his companion to
  the table which he had engaged in the restaurant with all the <i>savoir
  faire</i> of a redoubtable man about town. She was, in her way, an
  exceedingly striking figure in a black satin gown on which was enscrolled one
  immense cluster of flowers. Her neck and arms, very fully visible, were
  irreproachable. Her blue-black hair, simply arranged but magnificent,
  triumphed over the fashions of the coiffeur. The transition from Fourteenth
  Street to her present surroundings seemed to have been accomplished without
  the slightest hitch. She leaned forward to smell the great cluster of white
  roses which he had ordered in from the adjoining florist's.</p>

  <p>"The one flower I love," she sighed. "I always fall for white roses."</p>

  <p>Crawshay's eyes twinkled as he took his place.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember your English history?" he asked. "This is perhaps
  destined to become a battle of red and white roses&mdash;red roses at
  Claridge's and white roses here."</p>

  <p>"Which won&mdash;in history?" she asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"That I won't tell you," he said, "in case you should be superstitious. At
  the same time, I am bound to confess that if we could both of us hear exactly
  what Jocelyn Thew is saying to-night across those red roses, I think perhaps
  that I should back the House of York."</p>

  <p>"So that's the stunt, is it?" she remarked coolly. "You want to make me
  jealous of Katharine Beverley?"</p>

  <p>"The cleverest and hardest men in the world," Crawshay observed,
  "generally meet with their Waterloo at the hands of your sex. So far as I am
  concerned, I am myself in distress. I am jealous of Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"You're bearing up!"</p>

  <p>"I am bearing up," Crawshay rejoined, "because I am hoping that with
  kindness and consideration, and with opportunity to prove to you what a
  domestic and faithful person I am, you will perceive that of the two men I am
  the more worthy."</p>

  <p>"Think something of yourself, don't you?" she observed.</p>

  <p>"I have cultivated this confidence," he told her. "In my younger days I
  was over-diffident."</p>

  <p>"Guess you're older than I thought you, then."</p>

  <p>"I am thirty-seven years old," he declared, "and I was well brought
  up."</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew," she said reflectively, "is forty."</p>

  <p>"I did not bring you here," he declared, "to discuss the age of my
  unworthy rival. I brought you to tell me whether you consider that this
  <i>Lobster Americaine</i> reminds you at all of Delmonico's, and to prove to
  you that we can, if we put our minds to it and speak plain and simple words
  to the <i>sommelier</i>, serve our champagne as iced even as you like
  it."</p>

  <p>Nora was not wanting in appreciation.</p>

  <p>"It's the best thing I've had to eat since I left New York, and for some
  time before that," she assured him. "There hasn't been much Delmonico's for
  me during the last few months. Too many of your lot poking about Fourteenth
  Street."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"After all," he said, "that was bound to come to an end when America
  declared war. You people did the only wise thing&mdash;brother to San
  Francisco, eh, your father to Chicago, and you over here?"</p>

  <p>"You do know things," she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I am a perfect dictionary as to your movements," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Have you anything to do with the fact that my rooms have been searched by
  the police?" she asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Indirectly I fear so," he confessed. "You see, up to the present we
  haven't the least idea as to what has become of all those documents and plans
  which Mr. Jocelyn Thew so very cleverly brought over to this country."</p>

  <p>"Don't know where he's tucked them away, eh?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"That's a fact," Crawshay confessed. "We discovered, a trifle too late,
  how they were brought over, but what has become of them since Jocelyn Thew's
  arrival in London we do not know. Every one concerned has been searched, no
  deposit has been made at any hotel or in any of the ordinary places where one
  might conceal securities. They have momentarily vanished."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"Well," she exclaimed, "he does put it over you, doesn't he? I wonder
  whether you think that I am going to be any use to you&mdash;that you'll trap
  Jocelyn Thew through me?"</p>

  <p>"Not now," he answered. "I used to think so once."</p>

  <p>"Why have you changed your mind?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he told her bluntly, "I used once to think that you and he
  cared for one another."</p>

  <p>"And now?"</p>

  <p>"I have changed my mind," he admitted. "You know him so well that I need
  not remind you that where women are concerned he seems to have shown few
  signs of weakness. Personally, I have a theory that the time has come when he
  is likely to go the way of all other men."</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table. Those wonderful brown eyes of hers were lit
  with an indescribable interest. Crawshay for a moment lost the thread of his
  thoughts. They were certainly the most beautiful eyes he had ever looked
  into.</p>

  <p>"You think there is anything between those two&mdash;Katharine Beverley
  and him?"</p>

  <p>"The consideration of that point," Crawshay continued, resuming his usual
  manner, "although it lies off the track of my present investigation, presents
  some points of interest. She can be of no further use to him in his present
  scheme. She certainly would not aid him in the concealment of any of his
  spoils, nor could she become an intermediary in forwarding them to their
  destination. Yet he has sent her roses every day she has been in England, and
  dined with her two nights following. You, who know him better than I do, will
  agree that such a course is unusual with him."</p>

  <p>"But Dick Beverley is with them to-night, you told me," she reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"That scarcely alters the situation," Crawshay pointed out, "because his
  coming was quite unexpected. If anything, it rather strengthens my point of
  view. Beverley is very much a young man of the world, and he probably knows
  Jocelyn Thew's reputation. He certainly would not consent to meet him in this
  friendly fashion, in company with his sister, unless the latter
  insisted."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't need to insist," Nora said, watching the champagne poured
  into her glass. "Unless you're kidding me, you don't seem to be able to see
  much further than your nose. Katharine Beverley didn't come across the
  Atlantic for her health, and Dick Beverley didn't join that little dinner
  party for nothing to-night. They both of them did as they were told, and they
  had to do it."</p>

  <p>"This, I must confess," Crawshay murmured, smoothly and mendaciously,
  "puzzles me. Your idea is, then, that Jocelyn Thew has some hold over
  them?"</p>

  <p>She laughed at him a little contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to make me believe," she said, "that you are not wise
  about that. It isn't clever, you know, to treat me as a simpleton."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he confessed humbly, "that it is I who am the simpleton.
  You think, then, that the red roses are more emblematic of warfare than of
  love?"</p>

  <p>Nora shrugged her shoulders and was silent for several moments. Her
  companion changed the subject abruptly, pointed out to her several theatrical
  celebrities, told her an entertaining story, and talked nonsense until the
  smile came back to her lips. It was Nora herself who returned to the subject
  of the Beverleys, reopening it with a certain abruptness which showed that it
  had never been far from her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"See here, Mr. Crawshay," she said, "you seem to me to be wasting a lot of
  time worrying round a subject, when I don't know whether a straightforward
  question wouldn't clear it up for you. If you want to know what there is
  between those three, Jocelyn Thew and the two Beverleys, I don't know that I
  mind telling you. It's probably what you asked me to dine with you for,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Sharey!" Crawshay protested, with genuine earnestness. "I
  can assure you that I had only one object in asking you to spend the evening
  with me."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him over the glass which she had just raised to her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"The pleasure of talking to you&mdash;of being with you."</p>

  <p>"You're easily satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not so easily as I seem," he whispered, leaning a little forward
  in his place. "If only I were sure that you were not in love with Jocelyn
  Thew!"</p>

  <p>"If you think that I am," she observed, "why are you always slinging that
  Beverley girl at me?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said coolly, "to make you jealous. All's fair in love and
  war, you know."</p>

  <p>"I see. Then what you really want is to make love to me yourself? I'm
  sitting here and taking notice. Go right ahead."</p>

  <p>Crawshay let himself go for a few moments, and his companion listened to
  him approvingly.</p>

  <p>"It sounds quite like the real thing," she sighed, "but I never trust you
  Englishmen. You seem to acquire the habit of talking love to us girls just as
  easily as you drink a cocktail. You know that if I were to put my little hand
  in yours this moment across the table, you wouldn't know what to do with
  it."</p>

  <p>"Try me," Crawshay begged.</p>

  <p>She held it out&mdash;a long, rather thin, capable woman's hand, manicured
  a few hours ago in the latest fashion, but ringless. Crawshay promptly raised
  it to his lips. She snatched it away, half amused, half vexed, and glanced
  furtively around.</p>

  <p>"If you did that in an American restaurant," she told him, "you'd stand
  some chance of getting yourself laughed at."</p>

  <p>"It's quite the custom over here and on the Continent," he assured her
  equably. "It means&mdash;well, just as much as you want it to mean."</p>

  <p>She sighed and looked at her fingers reflectively.</p>

  <p>"What you'd like me to tell you, then," she suggested, raising her eyes
  and looking at him thoughtfully, "is that I've never wasted a thought on
  Jocelyn Thew, but that Mr. Reginald Crawshay is it with a capital 'I'?"</p>

  <p>"It would make me very happy," he assured her with much conviction.</p>

  <p>She laughed at him very softly. Little sparks seemed to flash from her
  eyes, and her teeth were wonderful.</p>

  <p>"You're very nice, anyway," she declared, "although I am not sure that I
  believe in you as much as I'd like to. I'll just tell you as much as I know.
  It really doesn't amount to anything. It was just after Jocelyn Thew had come
  back from Nicaragua and Dick Beverley was having a flare-up of his own in New
  York. They came together, those two, when Dick was in a tight corner. I don't
  know the story, but I know that Jocelyn Thew played the white man. Dick
  Beverley owes him perhaps his life, perhaps only his liberty, and his sister
  knows it. That's how those three stand to one another."</p>

  <p>"I ought to have puzzled that out myself," Crawshay said humbly.</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," she retorted drily, "that you didn't, long ago."</p>

  <p>"Surmises are of very little interest by the side of facts," he reminded
  her. "I like to have something solid to build upon."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"If I were a sentimental sort of girl," she declared, "I could take a
  fancy to you, Mr. Crawshay."</p>

  <p>"Now you're laughing at me," he protested. "However, I'm going right on
  with it and then we will dismiss all serious subjects. Miss Beverley has
  certainly quit herself of any obligation to Jocelyn Thew. Richard Beverley is
  no longer free. Besides, he has only a couple of days in England, so there's
  very little chance of his being of use. Yet," he continued impressively, "I
  happen to know that every hour just now is of the greatest importance to
  Jocelyn Thew. Why does he spend another entire evening with these two?"</p>

  <p>"Say, which of us is the detective&mdash;you or me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Professionally, I suppose I am," he admitted. "Just now, however, I
  consider myself as indulging in the relaxation of private life."</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table towards him, her chin supported by her
  clenched hands.</p>

  <p>"Then relax all you want to," she begged, with a smile of invitation.
  "We'll drop the other stunt, if you don't mind. And please remember, though
  I've never enjoyed a dinner more in my life, that we don't want to be too
  late for the Empire."</p>

  <p>Crawshay returned to his rooms about one o'clock the next morning, with
  his hat a little on the back of his head, and wearing, very much against his
  prejudice, a white rose in his buttonhole. Brightman, who was awaiting him
  there, looked up eagerly at his entrance.</p>

  <p>"Any luck, Mr. Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay laid his hat and coat upon the table and mixed himself a whisky
  and soda.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he replied thoughtfully. "Are you any good at English
  history, Brightman?"</p>

  <p>"I won an exhibition in my younger days," the detective replied. "I used
  to consider myself rather great on history."</p>

  <p>"Who won the Wars of the Roses?"</p>

  <p>"The Lancastrians, of course."</p>

  <p>Crawshay nodded.</p>

  <p>"They were the chaps with the red roses, weren't they?" he observed.
  "Brightman, I fancy we are going to reverse that. I am laying five to one
  that I've found out how Jocelyn Thew counts on getting his spoils into
  Germany."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The dinner of the red roses, as though in emulation of its
  rival entertainment, seemed on its way to complete success. Jocelyn Thew,
  from whose manner there seemed to have departed much of the austerity of the
  previous evening, had never been a more brilliant companion. He, who spoke so
  seldom of his own doings, told story after story of his wanderings in distant
  countries, until even Katharine lost her fears of the situation and abandoned
  herself to the enjoyment of the moment. His tone was kindlier and his manner
  more natural. He spoke with regret of Richard Beverley's departure in a
  couple of days, and only once did he hint at anything in the least
  disturbing.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful feat, that of you flying men," he remarked, "dropping ten
  thousand copies of Wilson's speech over the German lines. I am not sure that
  it isn't rather a dangerous precedent, though."</p>

  <p>"Why dangerous?" Katharine enquired.</p>

  <p>"Because," he answered coolly, "it might suggest a possible means of
  communication with Germany to a person, say, like myself."</p>

  <p>"But you are not a flying man," Katharine reminded him.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"It would not be necessary," he observed, "for me to be my own
  messenger."</p>

  <p>There was a brief and rather a blank silence. The shadow of a new fear had
  arisen in Katharine's heart. The brother and sister exchanged quick
  glances.</p>

  <p>"I believe I am right," their host went on, a few minutes later, "in
  presuming that you have told Richard here the details of our little adventure
  upon the <i>City of Boston</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I have told him everything," Katharine acknowledged. "You don't mind
  that, do you? I felt that I had to."</p>

  <p>"You were quite right," Jocelyn Thew assented. "There is no reason for you
  to keep anything secret from Richard."</p>

  <p>The young man was conscious of a sudden recrudescence of anger, the
  flaming up again of his first resentment.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing was a rotten business, Thew," he declared. "I should
  never have resented your making use of me in any way you wished, but to make
  a tool of Katharine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," Jocelyn Thew interrupted, smoothly but with a dangerous
  glitter in his eyes, "please don't go on. I have an idea that you were going
  to say something offensive. Better not. Your sister came to no real harm. She
  never ran any real risk."</p>

  <p>"It depends upon the way you look at these things," the young man replied
  gloomily. "Katharine tells me that she is watched at her hotel day and night,
  and that she has come under the suspicion of the Government for being
  concerned in this affair."</p>

  <p>"That really isn't of much account," the other assured him. "You
  yourself," he went on, "came very nearly under suspicion once for something
  infinitely more serious."</p>

  <p>It was a chill note in the warmth of their festivities. Katharine glanced
  reproachfully at her host, and he seemed to realise at once his lapse.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, both of you," he begged. "I fear that I am a little irritable
  to-night. This constant espionage gets on one's nerves. Look at them all
  around us,&mdash;Crawshay in the corner, trying his best to get something
  incriminating out of Nora Sharey; Brightman smoking a cigar out there, with
  his eyes wandering all the time through the glass screen towards this table;
  and the young man who seemed to haunt your hotel, Miss Beverley&mdash;Henshaw
  I believe his name is&mdash;you see him dining there with his back turned
  ostentatiously towards us and a little pocket mirror by his side. There are
  three pairs of eyes that scarcely ever leave us. I don't know whether they
  expect me to produce my spoils from my pocket and lay them upon the table, or
  whether one of them is a student of the lip language and hopes to learn the
  secrets of our conversation. Bah! They are very stupid, this professional
  potpourri of secret-service agents and detectives. Can't you hear them, how
  they will whisper in the lobby after we have left? 'Jocelyn Thew is
  entertaining a young Flying Corps man on leave from the front, the brother of
  Miss Beverley, who has already helped him. What does that mean?' Then they
  will put their fingers to their noses and you, too, will probably be watched,
  Dick. They will congratulate themselves upon possessing the subtlety of the
  Devil. They will see through my scheme. They will say&mdash;'This young man
  is to drop the documents behind the German lines!' Don't be alarmed, Richard,
  if you find a secret service man in your bedroom when you get home
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Katharine laughed almost joyously.</p>

  <p>"Then you're not going to ask Dick to do anything of that sort?" she
  demanded, her tone indicating an immense relief.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to ask your brother to do anything which is so palpably
  obvious," he replied. "His help I am certainly going to engage, but in a
  manner which is very unlikely to bring trouble upon him. I promise you
  that."</p>

  <p>She suddenly leaned across the table. The cloud had passed from her
  features, the dull weight from her heart. Her eyes were more eloquent even
  than her tremulous lips.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thew," she said, "do you know that I have always had one conviction
  about you, and that is that all these strange adventures in which you have
  taken part&mdash;some of them, as you yourself have acknowledged, more
  creditable than others&mdash;you have entered into chiefly from that spirit
  of adventure, just the spirit in which Dick here," she added with a little
  shiver, "made his mistake. Why can't you satisfy that part of your nature as
  Dick is doing? This war, upon which we Americans looked so coldly at first,
  has become almost a holy war, a twentieth-century crusade. Why don't you join
  one of these irregular forces and fight?"</p>

  <p>Then they both witnessed what they had never before seen in Jocelyn Thew.
  They saw his eyes blaze with a sudden concentrated fury. They saw his lips
  part and something that was almost a snarl transform and disfigure his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"Fight for England?" he exclaimed bitterly. "I would sooner cut off my
  right hand!"</p>

  <p>His words left them at first speechless. He, too, after his little
  outburst seemed shaken, lacking in his usual <i>sangfroid</i>. It was
  Katharine who first recovered herself.</p>

  <p>"But you are English?" she protested wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Am I?" he replied. "Will you forgive me if I beg you to change the
  subject?"</p>

  <p>The subject was effectually changed for them by the advent of some of
  Richard Beverley's brothers in arms. It was some time before they passed on.
  Then a little note almost of tragedy concluded the feast. A tall and elderly
  man, gaunt, with sunken cheeks, silver-white hair, complexion curiously
  waxen, and big, dark eyes, left the table where he had been sitting with a
  few Americans and came over towards them. His advance was measured, almost
  abnormally slow. His manner would have been melodramatic but for its intense
  earnestness. He stood at their table for a few seconds before speaking, his
  eyes fixed upon Jocelyn Thew's in a curious, almost unnatural stare.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me," he said. "I must be speaking to Sir Denis
  Cathley?"</p>

  <p>Neither of the two young people, who were filled with wonder at the
  strange appearance of the newcomer, noticed Jocelyn Thew's sudden grip of the
  tablecloth, the tightening of his frame, the ominous contraction of his
  eyebrows as for a moment he sat there speechless. Then he was himself again.
  He shook his head courteously.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he replied, "that you must be making some mistake. My name
  is Jocelyn Thew."</p>

  <p>"And mine," the stranger announced, "is Michael Dilwyn. Is that name known
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly well," Jocelyn Thew acknowledged. "I was present at the
  production of your last play in New York. I have since read with much
  regret," he went on courteously, "of the losses you have sustained."</p>

  <p>The old man's wonderful eyes flashed for a moment.</p>

  <p>"They are losses I am proud to endure, sir," he said. "But I did not come
  to speak of myself. I came to speak to Sir Denis Cathley."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is a likeness which deceives you," he declared.</p>

  <p>"A likeness!" the other repeated. "Nine weeks ago I stood in a ruined
  mansion&mdash;so dilapidated, in fact, that one corner of it is open to the
  skies. I listened to the roar of the Atlantic as I heard it in the same place
  fifty years ago. A herdsman and his wife, perhaps a girl or two, live
  somewhere in the back quarters. The only apartment in any sort of
  preservation is the one sometimes called the picture gallery and sometimes
  the banqueting hall. You should visit this ruined mansion, sir. You should
  visit it before you give me the lie when I call you Sir Denis Cathley."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew's hand for a moment shielded part of his face, as though he
  found the electric light a little strong. From behind the shelter of his palm
  his eyes met the eyes of his visitor. The latter suddenly turned and bowed to
  Katharine.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive an old man," he begged courteously, "who has seen much
  trouble lately, for his ill manners. Perhaps your friend here, your friend
  whose name is not Sir Denis Cathley, can explain to you why I felt some
  emotion at the sight of so wonderful a likeness."</p>

  <p>He bowed, murmured some broken words in reply to Katharine's kindly little
  speech, and moved away. Jocelyn Thew's eyes watched him with a curious
  softness.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he acknowledged, "I can tell you why, if he really saw a likeness
  in me to the person he spoke of, it might remind him of strange things. You
  know him by name, of course&mdash;Michael Dilwyn?"</p>

  <p>"He wrote the wonderful Sinn Fein play, 'The New Green,' didn't he?"
  Katharine asked eagerly. "I heard you mention it to him. My aunt and I were
  there at the first night."</p>

  <p>"He wrote that and some more wonderful poetry. He has spent more than half
  his life working for the cause of Ireland. He was the father and patriarch of
  the last rising. One of his sons was shot at Dublin."</p>

  <p>"And who is Sir Denis Cathley?"</p>

  <p>"The Cathleys are another so-called revolutionary family," Jocelyn Thew
  explained. "The late Sir Denis, the father of the man whom he supposed me to
  be, was Michael Dilwyn's closest friend. They, too, have paid a heavy price
  for their patriotism or their rebellious instincts, whichever way you choose
  to look at the matter."</p>

  <p>"I think," Katharine declared, "that Mr. Dilwyn is the most
  picturesque-looking man I ever saw. I don't believe that even now he is
  altogether convinced as to your identity."</p>

  <p>"He has probably reached an age," was the cool reply, "when his memory
  begins to suffer.&mdash;Ah! I see our friend Crawshay is taking counsel with
  Henshaw. They are looking in this direction. Richard, my young friend, you
  are in a bad way. Suspicion is beginning to fasten upon you. Believe me, one
  of my parasites will be on your track to-night. I can almost convince myself
  as to their present subject of conversation. They are preening themselves
  upon having seen through my subtle scheme. I am very sure they are asking
  themselves&mdash;'When is the transfer of documents to take place?'"</p>

  <p>"It may all seem very humorous to you," the young man remarked, a little
  sullenly, "but it leaves a sort of nasty flavour in one's mouth, all the
  same. If they were to suspect me of trying to drop documents over the German
  lines except under instructions, it would mean a court-martial, even though
  they were unable to prove anything, and a firing party in five minutes if
  they were."</p>

  <p>"Take heart, my young friend," Jocelyn Thew advised him, "and do not
  refuse the Courvoisier brandy which our saintly friend with the chain is
  proffering. If it is not indeed a relic of the Napoleonic era, it is at least
  drinkable. And listen&mdash;this may help you to drink it with zest&mdash;I
  am not going to ask you to drop any documents over the German lines."</p>

  <p>The thankfulness in Katharine's face was reflected in her brother's.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" he exclaimed, helping himself liberally to the
  brandy. "You know I'd find it hard to refuse you anything, Thew, but there
  are limits. Besides, you are never really out of sight there. We go out in
  squadrons, and from the height we fly at nothing I could drop would be very
  likely to reach its destination."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew smiled coldly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Richard," he said, "I am not going to make you an unwilling
  partner in any foolhardy scheme such as you are thinking of, because that is
  just the Obvious thing that our friends who take so much interest in us would
  expect and prepare for. All the same, there is just a trifling commission
  which I will ask you to undertake for me, and which I will explain to you
  later. When do you leave?"</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock train from Charing Cross on Monday night," the young man
  replied. "I have to fly on Tuesday morning."</p>

  <p>"Then if it pleases you we will all dine here that night," Jocelyn Thew
  suggested, "and I will take you on to the Alhambra for an hour. Doctor Gant
  and I were there our first night in town, and we found the performance
  excellent. You will honour me, Miss Beverley?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," she answered, "but I am not at all sure that you
  will be able to get seats at the Alhambra."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There is a great benefit performance there on Monday night," she told
  him. "The house is closed now for rehearsals. All the stalls have gone
  already, and the boxes are to be sold by auction at the Theatrical
  F&ecirc;te."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew was for a moment grave.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad that you told me this," he said, "but I think that I can
  nevertheless promise you the stage box for Monday night. I have a call on it.
  We must all meet once more. It is just possible that I may have a pleasant
  surprise for both of you."</p>

  <p>"Do give us an idea what it is," she begged.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. Somehow, since the coming of Michael Dilwyn, a tired
  look had crept into his eyes. He seemed to have lost all his old vivacity. He
  had paid the bill some time before and they strolled together now into the
  lounge. Katharine was carrying half a dozen of the roses, which the waiter
  had pressed into her hand.</p>

  <p>"To-night," she said, looking up into his face and dropping her voice a
  little, "I am feeling so much happier&mdash;happier than I have felt for a
  long time. Why do you keep us both, Mr. Thew, in such a state of uneasiness?
  You give us so little of your real confidence, so little of your real self.
  Sometimes it seems as though you deliberately try to make yourself out a
  harder, crueller person than you really are. Why do you do that?"</p>

  <p>For a moment she fancied that the impossible had happened, that she had
  penetrated the armour of that steadfast and studied indifference.</p>

  <p>"We are all just a little the fools of circumstance," he sighed. "A will
  to succeed sometimes, if it is strong enough, crushes out things we would
  like to keep alive."</p>

  <p>She thrust one of the blossoms which she was carrying through his
  buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"I know you will hate that," she whispered, "but you can take it out the
  moment you have gotten rid of us. Dick and I are going on now, you know, to
  the Esholt House dance. Shall I thank you for your dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Or I you for your company?" he murmured, bowing over her fingers.</p>

  <p>They took their leave, and Jocelyn Thew, almost as though against his
  will, walked back into the foyer, after a few minutes of hesitation, and sat
  there twirling the rose between his fingers, with his eyes fixed upon the
  interior of the restaurant. He had the air of one waiting.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Crawshay was awakened the next morning a little before the
  customary hour by his servant, who held out a card.</p>

  <p>"Gentleman would like a word with you at once, sir," the latter
  announced.</p>

  <p>Crawshay glanced at the card, slipped out of bed, and, attired in his
  dressing gown and slippers, made an apologetic entrance into the sitting
  room. The young man who was waiting there received him kindly, but obviously
  disapproved of the pattern of his dressing gown.</p>

  <p>"Chief wants a word with you, sir," he announced. "He is keeping from ten
  to ten-thirty."</p>

  <p>"I will be there," Crawshay promised, "on the stroke of ten."</p>

  <p>"Then I need not detain you further," his visitor remarked, making a
  graceful exit.</p>

  <p>Crawshay bathed, shaved and breakfasted, and at five minutes before ten
  entered an imposing-looking building and sent up his card to a very great
  man, who had a fancy for being spoken of in his department as Mr. Brown.
  After a very brief delay, he was admitted to the august presence. Mr. Brown
  waved his secretaries from the room, shook hands kindly with Crawshay and
  motioned him to a chair close to his own.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Crawshay," he said, "this is the first time I have had the pleasure
  of meeting you, but we have received at various times excellent reports as to
  your work at Washington."</p>

  <p>"I am very pleased to hear it, sir."</p>

  <p>"From what I gather as to the present situation, however," the great man
  continued, "I imagine that you were more successful in the conventional
  secret service work than you have been in the very grave business I have sent
  for you to discuss."</p>

  <p>"I should like to point out, sir," Crawshay begged, "that that foolish
  journey to Halifax was undertaken entirely against my convictions. I
  protested at the time! Neither had I any confidence in the summons to
  Chicago."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown took the circumstance into gracious consideration.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear that," he said, "and I must admit that your recovery
  was almost brilliant. A sense of humour," he went on, "sometimes obtrudes
  itself into the most serious incidents, and the idea of your boarding that
  steamer from a seaplane and then getting to work upon your investigations
  will always remain to me one of the priceless unrecorded incidents of the
  war. But to put the matter into plain words, our enemies got the better of
  you."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," was the honest confession.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt," the right honourable gentleman continued, "that the
  person who took charge of this affair is exceedingly clever. He appears to
  have resource and daring. Personally, I, like you, never believed for a
  moment that the whole of the records of German espionage in America for the
  last three years, would be found upon the same steamer as that by which the
  departing ambassadorial staff travelled. However, I can quite see that under
  the circumstances you had to yield to the convictions of those who were
  already in charge of the affair."</p>

  <p>"You have had full reports, sir, I suppose?" Crawshay asked. "You know the
  manner in which the documents were brought into this country?"</p>

  <p>"A ghastly business," Mr. Brown acknowledged, "ingenious but ghastly. Yes,
  Mr. Crawshay," he went on, "I think I have been kept pretty well posted up
  till now. I have sent for you because I am not sure whether one point has
  been sufficiently impressed upon you. As you are of course aware, there are
  many documents and details connected with this propaganda which are of
  immense value to the police of New York, but there is just one&mdash;a letter
  written in a moment of impulse by one great personage to another, and
  stolen&mdash;which might do the cause of the Allies incalculable harm if it
  were to fall into the wrong hands."</p>

  <p>"I had a hint of this, sir. Mason knew of it, too. His idea was that they
  would be quite willing to destroy all the rest of the treasonable stuff they
  have, if they could be sure of getting this one letter through."</p>

  <p>"The documents have been in England now," Mr. Brown observed, "for some
  days. Have you formed any theory at all as to where they may be
  concealed?"</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly frank," Crawshay confessed, "I have not. Doctor Gant,
  Jocelyn Thew, a young woman called Nora Sharey, and Miss Beverley are the
  four people possibly implicated in their disappearance, although of these two
  I consider Miss Sharey and Miss Beverley out of the question. Nevertheless,
  their rooms and every scrap of property they possess have been searched
  thoroughly, and their movements since they arrived in London are absolutely
  tabulated. Not one of them has written a letter or dispatched a parcel which
  has not been investigated, nor have they made a call or even entered a shop
  without being watched. It seems absolutely impossible that they can have
  taken any steps towards the disposal of the documents since Jocelyn Thew
  arrived in London."</p>

  <p>"Have they given any indication of their future plans?"</p>

  <p>"Doctor Gant," Crawshay replied, "has booked a passage back in the
  American boat which sails for Liverpool early to-morrow morning. We shall
  escort him there, and his effects will be searched once more in Liverpool.
  Otherwise, we have no intention of detaining him. He and Miss Beverley were
  simply the tools of the other man."</p>

  <p>"And the other man?"</p>

  <p>"He has shown no signs of making any move whatsoever. He lives, to all
  appearance, the perfectly normal life of a man of leisure. I understand that
  he is entirely a newcomer to this sort of business, but he is, without a
  doubt, the most modern thing in secret service. He lives quite openly at a
  small suite in the Savoy Court. He never makes the slightest concealment
  about any of his movements. We know how he has spent every second of his time
  since we first took up the search, and I can assure you that there is not a
  single suspicious incident recorded against him."</p>

  <p>"You are satisfied," Mr. Brown asked, "with the aid which you are getting
  from Scotland Yard?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Crawshay declared. "Brightman, too&mdash;the man who came
  down with me from Liverpool&mdash;has done excellent work."</p>

  <p>"And notwithstanding all this," was the somewhat grave criticism, "you
  have not the slightest idea where these documents are to be found?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," Crawshay confessed. "All that I do feel convinced of
  is that they have not left the country."</p>

  <p>The great man leaned back a little wearily in his chair. There were some
  decoded cables, lying under a paper weight by his side, imploring him in the
  strongest possible terms to make use of every means within his power to solve
  this mystery,&mdash;a personal appeal from a man whose good will might sway
  the balance of the future. He was used to wonderful service in every
  department he controlled. His present sense of impotence was galling.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Mr. Crawshay," he asked, "how long was the gap of time between
  your losing sight of Jocelyn Thew and when you picked him up in London?"</p>

  <p>"Very short indeed," was the emphatic reply. "Jocelyn Thew must have left
  the <i>City of Boston</i> at about eight o'clock on Monday morning. He met
  Gant at five o'clock that evening at Crewe station. Gant had come direct from
  Frisby, the little village near Chester where he had left the body of
  Phillips. It is obvious, therefore, that Gant had the papers with him when he
  joined Jocelyn Thew. They travelled to London together but parted at Euston,
  Gant going to a cheap hotel in the vicinity of Regent Street, whilst Thew
  drove to the Savoy. Gant called at the Savoy Hotel at nine o'clock that
  evening, and the two men dined together in the grill room and took a box at a
  music hall&mdash;the Alhambra. Up to this time neither of them had received a
  visitor or dispatched a message&mdash;Thew, in fact, had spent more than an
  hour in the barber's shop. They returned from the Alhambra together, went up
  to Thew's rooms, had a drink and separated half an hour later. This, of
  course, is in a sense posthumous information, but Scotland Yard have it
  tabulated down to the slightest detail, and we are unable to find a single
  suspicious circumstance in connection with the movements of either man. At
  four o'clock the following morning, when both men were asleep in their rooms,
  the cordon was drawn around them. Since then they haven't had a chance."</p>

  <p>"The fact that the papers are not in the possession of either of them,"
  Mr. Brown said reflectively, "proves that they made some move of which you
  have no record."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Crawshay agreed, "but it must have been a move of so slight a
  character that chance may reveal it to us at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Describe Jocelyn Thew to me," Mr. Brown begged.</p>

  <p>"He has every appearance," Crawshay declared, "of being a man of breeding.
  He is scarcely middle-aged&mdash;tall and of athletic build. He dresses well,
  speaks well, and I should take him anywhere for an English public school and
  college man."</p>

  <p>"Did New York give you his record?"</p>

  <p>"In a cloudy sort of way. He seems to have had a most interesting career,
  ranching out West, fighting in Mexico, fighting in several of the Central
  American states, and fighting, I shrewdly suspect, against England in South
  Africa. He seems to have been a sort of stormy petrel, and to have turned up
  in any place where there was trouble. In New York the police always suspected
  him of being connected with some great criminal movements, but they were
  never able to lay even a finger upon him. He lived at one of the best hotels
  in the city, disappeared sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks, sometimes
  for a year, but always returned quite quietly, with apparently any amount of
  money to spend, and that queer look which comes to a man who has been up
  against big things."</p>

  <p>"He is an Englishman, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"He must be. His accent and manners and appearance are all
  unmistakable."</p>

  <p>"How long was he suspected of being in the pay of our enemies before this
  thing transpired?"</p>

  <p>"Only a very short time. There was a little gang in New
  York&mdash;Rentoul, the man who had the wireless in Fifth Avenue, was in
  it&mdash;and they used to meet at a place in Fourteenth Street, belonging to
  an old man named Sharey. That's where Miss Sharey comes into the business.
  There were some queer things done there, but they don't concern this
  business, and New York has the records of them."</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew," Mr. Brown repeated slowly to himself. "Where did you say
  he was staying?"</p>

  <p>"At the Savoy Court."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown looked fixedly at the cables, fluttering a little in the breeze
  which blew in through the half-open window.</p>

  <p>"All this isn't very encouraging, Mr. Crawshay," he sighed.</p>

  <p>"Up to the present no," the former admitted. "Yet I can promise you one
  thing, sir. Those papers shall not leave the country."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you speak with so much confidence," Mr. Brown observed
  drily. "Mr. Jocelyn Thew seems at any rate to have managed to secrete them
  without difficulty."</p>

  <p>"That may be so," Crawshay acknowledged, "and yet I am convinced of one
  thing. They are disposed of in some perfectly obvious way, and within the
  next forty-eight hours he will make some effort to repossess himself of them.
  If he does, he will fail."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you for coming to see me," he said. "You are
  doing your best, I know, and I beg you, Mr. Crawshay, never for a moment to
  let your efforts relax. The mechanical side of the watch that is being kept
  upon these people I know we can rely upon, but you must remember that you are
  the brains of this enterprise. Your little band of watchers will be quiet
  enough to see the things that happen and the things that exist. It is you who
  must watch for the things which don't happen."</p>

  <p>Crawshay smiled slightly as he rose to take his leave.</p>

  <p>"I do not as a rule suffer from over-confidence, sir," he said, "but I
  think I can promise you that by Wednesday night not only will the papers be
  in our hands, but Mr. Jocelyn Thew will be so disposed of that he will be no
  longer an object of anxiety to us."</p>

  <p>"Get on with the good work, then," was Mr. Brown's laconic farewell.</p>

  <p>Late on the following afternoon, Jocelyn Thew and Gant paced the long
  platform at Euston, by the side of which the special for the American boat
  was already drawn up. Curiously enough, in their immediate vicinity Mr.
  Brightman was also seeing a friend off, and on the outskirts of the little
  throng Mr. Henshaw was taking an intelligent interest in the scene.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, after all," Jocelyn Thew declared, "you are right to go. You
  have been very useful, and you have, without a doubt, earned your thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"It was easy money," the other admitted, "but even now I am nervous. I
  shall be glad to be back once more in my own country."</p>

  <p>"You are certainly right to go," the other repeated. "If you had been
  different, if you had been one of those men after my own heart," Jocelyn Thew
  went on, resting his hand for a moment upon Gant's shoulder, "one of those
  who, apart from thought of gain or hope of profit, love adventure for its own
  sake, I should have begged you to stay with me. I would have sent you on
  bogus errands to mysterious places. I would have twisted the brains of those
  who have fastened upon us in a hundred different fashions. But alas, my
  friend, you are not like that!"</p>

  <p>"I am not," Gant admitted, gruffly but heartily. "I have done a job for
  you, and you have paid me very well. I am glad to have done it, because I
  love Germany and I do not love England. Apart from that my work is finished.
  I like to go home. I am happiest with my wife and family."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," his companion agreed. "I know your type, Gant,&mdash;in fact,
  I chose you because of it. You like, as you say, to do your job and finish
  with it,&mdash;and you have finished."</p>

  <p>The doctor turned for a moment deliberately round and looked at his
  companion. He was a heavy-browed, unimaginative, quiet-living man. The things
  which passed before his eyes counted with him, and little else. The thousand
  pounds which he was taking home was more than he had been able to save
  throughout his life. To him it represented immense things. He would probably
  not spend a dollar more, or indulge in a single luxury, yet the money was
  there in the background, a warm, comforting thing.</p>

  <p>"You have still," he said, "a desperate part to play. Can you tell me
  honestly that you enjoy it, that you have no fear?"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew repeated the word almost wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Fear! Do you really know me so little, my friend of few perceptions?
  Listen and I will confess something. I have fought for my life at least a
  dozen times, fought against odds which seemed almost hopeless. I have seen
  death with hungry, outstretched arms, within a few seconds' reach of me, but
  I have never felt fear. I do not know what it is. The length of one's life is
  purely a relative thing. It will come in ten or twenty years, if not
  to-morrow. Why not to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"If you put it like that," Gant grunted, "why not to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Or at any moment, if you will. I am quite ready, as ready as I ever shall
  be. If I fail to bring off what I desire within the next few days, there will
  be an end of me. Do I look as though I were worrying about that?"</p>

  <p>"You don't indeed," the doctor agreed. "You ought to have been in my
  profession. You might have become the greatest surgeon in the world."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Even that is possible," he admitted. "Unfortunately, there was a cloud
  over my early days, a cloud heavy enough even to prevent my offering my
  services to the world through the medium of any of the recognized
  professions. So you see, Gant, I had to invent one of my own. What would you
  call it, I wonder?&mdash;Buccaneer? Adventurer? Explorer? Perhaps my enemies
  would find a more unkind word.&mdash;Now you had better step in and take your
  seat. Behold the creatures of our friend Brightman and the satellites of the
  aristocratic Crawshay close in upon us! They listen for farewell words. Is
  this your carriage? Very well. Here comes your porter, hungry for
  remuneration. Shall I give them a hint, Gant?"</p>

  <p>There flashed in the hunted man's eyes for a moment a gleam of almost
  demoniacal humour.</p>

  <p>Gant glowered at him. "You are mad!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Not I, my dear friend," Jocelyn Thew assured him, as he gripped his hand
  in a farewell salute. "Believe me, it is not I who am mad. It is these stupid
  people who search for what they can never find. They lift up the Stars and
  Stripes and find nothing. They lift up the Union Jack; again nothing. They
  try the Tricolour; <i>rien de tout</i>. But if they have the sense to try the
  Crescent&mdash;eh, Gant?&mdash;Well, a safe voyage to you, man. Sleep in your
  waistcoat, and remember me to every one in New York. I can't promise when I
  shall be back. I have taken a fancy to England. Still, one never
  knows.&mdash;Good-by."</p>

  <p>Thew watched the long train crawl out of the station, waved his hand in
  farewell, forced a greeting upon the reluctant Brightman, whom he passed
  examining the magazines upon a bookstall, and, summoning a taxi, was duly
  deposited at the Alhambra Theatre. He made his way to the box office.</p>

  <p>"I have called," he explained to the young man, "to see you about Box A on
  Monday night. I understand that there is a benefit performance."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, sir," the young man replied, "and I ought to have explained the
  matter to you at the time, when you engaged the box. If you will remember,
  although you took it for a week, you only paid for five nights. I omitted to
  tell you that for Monday night the box is not ours to dispose of."</p>

  <p>"It isn't yet sold, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir. The boxes will be disposed of by auction to-morrow
  afternoon at the Theatrical Garden Party. Mr. Bobby is going to act as
  auctioneer."</p>

  <p>"I see," Jocelyn Thew said thoughtfully. "The performance is, I believe,
  on behalf of the Red Cross?"</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"In that case, supposing I offer you now one hundred guineas for the
  box?"</p>

  <p>"Very generous indeed, sir," the young man admitted, "but we are pledged
  to allow all the boxes to be sold by Mr. Bobby. I think that if you are
  prepared to go to that sum, you will have no difficulty in securing it."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of going to the Theatrical Garden Party," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"You could perhaps get a friend to bid for you, sir," the young man
  suggested. "We hope to get fifty guineas for the large boxes, but I should
  think an offer such as yours would secure any one of them."</p>

  <p>"I rather dislike the publicity of an auction," Jocelyn Thew observed, as
  he turned to take his leave. "However, if charity demands it, I suppose one
  must waive one's prejudices."</p>

  <p>He strolled out and hesitated for a moment on the pavement. A curious
  change had taken place in what a few hours ago had seemed to be a perfect
  summer day. The clouds were thick in the sky, a few drops of rain were
  already falling, and a cold wind, like the presage of a storm, was bending
  the trees in the square. For a single moment he was conscious of an
  unsuspected weakness. A wave of depression swept in upon him. An unreasoning
  premonition of failure laid a cold hand upon his heart. He met the careless
  gaze of an apparent loiterer who was studying the placards without derision,
  almost with apprehension. Then he ground his heel into the pavement and
  re-entered his taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Savoy," he directed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Captain Richard Beverley, on his way through the hotel
  smoking room to the Savoy bar, stopped short. He looked at the girl who had
  half risen from her seat on the couch with a sudden impulse of half startled
  recognition. Her little smile of welcome was entirely convincing.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Nora Sharey!" he exclaimed. "Nora!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I am glad you've recognised me at last," she said, laughing. "I
  tried to make you see me last night in the restaurant, but you wouldn't
  look."</p>

  <p>He seemed a little dazed, even after he had saluted mechanically, held her
  hand for a moment and sank into the place by her side.</p>

  <p>"Nora Sharey!" he repeated. "Why, it was really you, then, dining last
  night with that fellow Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it was," she replied, "and I recognised you at once, even in
  your uniform."</p>

  <p>"You know that Jocelyn Thew is here? You saw him with us last night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know."</p>

  <p>"Stop a moment," Richard Beverley went on. "Let me think, Nora. Jocelyn
  Thew must have seen you dining with Crawshay. How does that work out?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't mind," she replied. "Let that stuff alone for a time. I want
  to look at you. You're fine, Dick, but what does it all mean?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't stick the ranch after the war broke out," he confessed. "I
  moved up into Canada and took on flying."</p>

  <p>"You are fighting out there in France?"</p>

  <p>"Have been for six months. Some sport, I can tell you, Nora. I've got a
  little machine gun that's a perfect daisy. Gee! I've got to pull up. The
  hardest work we fellows have sometimes is to remember that we mustn't talk
  about our job. They used to call me undisciplined. I'm getting it into my
  bones now, though.&mdash;Why, Nora, this is queer! I guess we're going to
  have a cocktail together, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. He called to a waiter and gave an order. Then he turned and
  looked at her appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"You're looking fine," he declared.</p>

  <p>She smiled with pleasure at the undoubted admiration in his tone. In the
  new and fashionable clothes which she had purchased during the last few days,
  the artistically coiffured hair, the smart hat and carefully-thought-out
  details of her toilette, she was a transformed being, in no way different
  from the half a dozen other young ladies who were gathered with their escorts
  at the further end of the room.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think so," she replied. "Seems to me I've had nothing else
  to do since I got here but buy frocks and things."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in a puzzled fashion.</p>

  <p>"You didn't come over with Jocelyn Thew, did you, Nora?" "Of course I
  didn't," she answered indignantly. "If you want to know the truth, it looked
  as though there was going to be trouble at Fourteenth Street. Dad made a move
  out West, and I had a fancy for making a little trip this way."</p>

  <p>"Kind of lonesome, isn't it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In a way," she sighed. "Still, I am going on presently to where I fancy I
  shall meet a few friends."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile," he remarked, "you are still friendly with Jocelyn Thew,
  and you dined last night, didn't you, with the man who has sworn to hunt him
  down?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You know what I think of Jocelyn Thew," she said. "I'm crazy about him,
  and always shall be, but I've never seen him look twice at a woman yet in his
  life, and never expect to. Dick!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Nora?"</p>

  <p>"May I ask you a question&mdash;straight?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"Don't think I mean to say a word against Jocelyn Thew. He's a white man
  through and through, and I think if there was any woman in the world he cared
  for, she would be his slave. But he's a desperate man. Even now the police
  are trying to draw their net around him. It was all very well for you, when
  you were painting New York red, to choose your friends where it pleased you,
  but your sister&mdash;she's different, isn't she?&mdash;what they call over
  on our side a society belle. I am not saying that there is a single person in
  the world too good for Jocelyn Thew to sit down with, but at the present
  moment&mdash;well, he's hard up against it. Things might happen to him, you
  know, Dick."</p>

  <p>For a moment the young man was silent. His eyes seemed to look through the
  walls of the room, seemed to conjure up some spectre from which a moment
  later he shrank.</p>

  <p>"You see, Nora," he explained, dropping his voice a little, "there was
  just one time when Jocelyn Thew stood by me like a brick. I was hard up
  against it and he saved me."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little closer to him.</p>

  <p>"I have often wondered," she murmured. "That was the affair down at the
  Murchison country house, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Richard Beverley assented silently.</p>

  <p>"Guess we'll drink these cocktails," he said, watching the waiter
  approach. "Flying takes something out of you all the time, you know, Nora,
  and although when I am up my nerves are like a rock, I sometimes feel a
  little shaky at leave time."</p>

  <p>"Drink?" she asked tersely.</p>

  <p>"I've quit that more or less," he assured her. "Still, I have been taking
  some these last few days. Finding Katharine over here with Jocelyn Thew
  hanging around gave me kind of a shock."</p>

  <p>"You weren't best pleased to see them together, I should think, were
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted, a little sullenly.</p>

  <p>"You're angry with him, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Kind of," he confessed. "I wouldn't have complained at anything he'd
  asked me to do, but it was a low-down trick to get Katharine into this
  trouble." His eyes shone out with a dull anger. She watched him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Dick, you're not the boy you were," she sighed. "Guess you're sorry you
  ever came to that supper party at the Knickerbocker, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He turned and looked at her. He was only twenty-two years old, but there
  were things in his face from which a man might have shrunk.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am sorry," he confessed. "I am not blaming anybody but I shall be
  sorry all my life."</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn Thew treated you very much as he did me," she went on. "He
  carried you off your feet. You thought him the most wonderful thing that ever
  lived. It was the same with me. He has never given as much of himself as his
  little finger, never even looked at me as though I were a human being, but
  I'd have scrubbed floors for him a month after we first met. It was just the
  same with you, only you were a man. You'd have committed murder for his sake,
  a week after that party."</p>

  <p>"Murder!"</p>

  <p>He gave a sudden start, a start that amazed her. His hand was upon her
  shoulder. His eyes, red with fury, were blazing into hers.</p>

  <p>"What's that you're saying, Nora? What's that?"</p>

  <p>She was speechless, paralysed by that little staccato cry. A group of
  people near looked around. She laughed shrilly to cover the intensity of the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"No need to get excited!" she exclaimed. "Pull yourself together," she
  went on, under her breath. "Waiter, two more cocktails." He recovered himself
  almost at once, but the strained look was there about his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Nerves, you see," he muttered. "I shall be all right again when I get
  back to France."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand gently upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she said, "you are often upon my conscience. You were such a nice
  boy, back in those days. Everything that's happened to you seems to have
  happened since you met Jocelyn Thew that night. He has got some sort of a
  hold, hasn't he? What is it?"</p>

  <p>The young man moistened his dry lips. The waiter brought their cocktails
  and he drank his greedily.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, Nora," he promised. "Perhaps it'll do me good to listen
  how the story sounds as I tell it. First of all, let us have the thing
  straight. Jocelyn Thew never helped me into trouble. I was in it, right up to
  the neck, when I met him."</p>

  <p>"You kept it to yourself," she murmured curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because I was a fool," he answered, "and because I believed I could pull
  things straight. But anyway, I was owing Dan Murchison seventy thousand I'd
  lost at poker. He was kind of shepherding me. He was a rough sort, Dan, and
  he had an ambitious wife, and I had a name he liked. Well, he was giving a
  week-end party down at that place of his on the Hudson. He asked me, or
  rather he ordered me down. I was only too glad to go. Then Mrs. Murchison
  chipped in&mdash;wanted my sister, wanted to put it in the paper. Katharine
  kicked, of course. So did I. Murchison for the first time showed his
  teeth&mdash;and we both went. Jocelyn Thew was another of the guests."</p>

  <p>"Tough, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Hell! On the way down&mdash;I don't know why, but I was feeling pretty
  desperate&mdash;I told Jocelyn Thew how I stood with Murchison. He listened
  but he didn't say much. He never does. It was a rotten party&mdash;common
  people, one or two professional gamblers, a lot of florid, noisy,
  overdressed, giggling women. After the women were supposed to have gone to
  bed, we sat down to what Dan Murchison called a friendly game&mdash;a hundred
  dollars ante, and a thousand rise. Jocelyn Thew played, three other men, and
  Murchison. After about an hour of it, I'd lost over twenty thousand dollars.
  The others had it between them, except Jocelyn, and about his play there was
  a very curious thing. He put in his ante regularly when it came to him, but
  he never made a single bet. Murchison turned to him once.</p>

  <p>"'Say, you must be having rotten cards, Mr. Thew,' he said.</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn shook his head very deliberately. I can hear his reply even now.
  Kind of quiet it was and deliberate.</p>

  <p>"'I don't fancy my chances of winning at this game.'</p>

  <p>"I knew what he meant later. I didn't tumble to it at the time. We played
  till two o'clock. God knows how much I'd lost! Then Murchison called the game
  off. He locked up his winnings in a little safe let into the wall. I was
  standing by him, drinking, and I saw the combination. Jocelyn Thew was
  sitting quite by himself, as though deep in thought.&mdash;We all got up to
  bed somehow. I sat for some hours at the open window. Pretty soon I got
  sober, and I began to realise what had happened. And all the time I thought
  of that safe, chock full of money, and the combination ready set. I heard
  Katharine moving about in her room, and I knew that she was waiting for me to
  go and say good night. I wouldn't. I put on a short jacket instead of my
  dress coat, and I took an electric torch out of my dressing case and I went
  down-stairs. I'd made up my mind, Nora. I meant to rob that safe."</p>

  <p>She was carried away by his narrative. He had let himself go now, speaking
  in short, quick sentences. Yet his plain words seemed to paint with a
  marvellous vividness the story he told. It seemed to her that she could see
  it all, could realise what he went through.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Dick," she whispered. "I understand."</p>

  <p>"Well, I got down into the room all right, and I got the safe open, and
  there was the money, and, right facing me, my letters and bonds, and pretty
  well a hundred thousand dollars in cash. And then I saw the lights flare up,
  and Murchison was there in his shirt and trousers.</p>

  <p>"'So that's your game, is it, Richard Beverley?' he said.</p>

  <p>"There were two of the others with him who'd been playing cards. There
  they were, three strong men, and I was a thief! I felt limp. I hadn't an
  ounce of resistance in me. Murchison stood there, showing his ugly teeth, his
  small eyes full of anger.</p>

  <p>"'So you're a thief, are you, Richard Beverley?' he went on.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't speak. At that moment they could have done just what they
  liked with me. And then the door opened very quietly and closed again.
  Jocelyn Thew came in. I saw Murchison's face. I tell you, Nora, it was
  something you wouldn't forget in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"'Is anything wrong?' Jocelyn Thew asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"One of the guests pointed to Murchison and me.</p>

  <p>"'We heard footsteps,' he explained. 'Dan called me and I followed him
  down. Young Beverley there was at the safe.'</p>

  <p>"'Probably helping himself,' Jocelyn said, in that same smooth, dangerous
  tone, 'to his own money.'</p>

  <p>"'To what?' Murchison cried.</p>

  <p>"'To his own money,' Jocelyn repeated, coming a little nearer. 'You know,
  Murchison, well enough what I mean&mdash;you and your two confederates here.
  You're nothing more nor less than common card sharpers. I took a pack of your
  cards up-stairs. I needn't say anything more. I think you'd better give the
  boy back his money. I meant to wait until to-morrow. Fate seems to have
  anticipated me. How much did you lose, Richard?'</p>

  <p>"Dan Murchison strode up to him and I saw one of the other men go for his
  hip pocket.</p>

  <p>"'Will you take that back?' Murchison demanded.</p>

  <p>"'Not on your life!' Thew replied.</p>

  <p>"Murchison went for him, but he hadn't a dog's chance. I never saw such a
  blow in my life. Jocelyn hit him on the point of the chin and he went over
  like a log&mdash;cut his head against the fender. He lay there groaning, and
  I&mdash;I swear to you, Nora, that I'm not a coward, but I couldn't
  move&mdash;my knees were shaking. The two of them went for Jocelyn, and
  before they could get there the door opened and a third man came
  in&mdash;Jake Hannaway, the most dangerous of the lot. Jocelyn kept the other
  two off and half turned his head towards me, where I was standing like a
  gibbering, nerveless lunatic.</p>

  <p>"'I think you'd better take a hand, Richard,' he said."</p>

  <p>Nora gasped a little and laid her hand upon his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Dick," she begged,&mdash;"not for a moment. I can't bear it. Just
  a moment."</p>

  <p>She clutched at the side of the settee. Richard Beverley simply sat still,
  looking through the walls of the room. There was not the slightest change in
  his face. He just waited until Nora whispered to him. Then he went on.</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you about the fight," he said. "I wasn't much use at first.
  Jocelyn was there, taking two of them on, and butting in sometimes against
  Hannaway, who'd tackled me. Then I began to get my strength back, and I think
  I should have settled Hannaway, but the door opened softly and I saw
  Katharine's face. She gave a little shriek, and Jake Hannaway got me just at
  the back of the head. I was pretty well done in, but Thew suddenly swung
  round and caught Jake Hannaway very nearly where he had hit Murchison. Down
  he went like a log. I stood there swaying. I can see the room now&mdash;a
  table overthrown, glasses and flower vases all over the floor, and those two
  men looking as though they meant to murder Thew. They rushed at him together.
  He dodged one, but his strength was going. Then for the first time he sprang
  clear of them, got his back to the wall.&mdash;I won't spin it out&mdash;he
  shot one of them through the shoulder. The other one had had enough and tried
  to bolt. Jocelyn Thew was just too quick for him. He flung a heavy
  candlestick and got him somewhere on the neck. There they all were
  now&mdash;Murchison sitting up and dabbing his face, half conscious, one of
  the others groaning and streaming with blood, the other lying&mdash;just as
  though he were dead. Jocelyn turned and spoke to Katharine&mdash;I can hear
  his voice now&mdash;I swear, Nora, there wasn't a quaver in it&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I am afraid, Miss Beverley,' he said, 'that your brother has unwittingly
  brought you into a den of thieves. I had my suspicions, and my car, instead
  of being at the garage, is under the shrubs there. One moment.'</p>

  <p>"He stepped out into the hall, brought a coat and threw it around her.
  Then he turned to me.</p>

  <p>"'Empty the safe, Richard,' he ordered.</p>

  <p>"I obeyed him. There was all the money I owed Murchison there, and a lot
  of other stuff. We stepped out of the French windows. Jocelyn moved the leg
  of one of those men on one side and held the window open for Katharine to
  pass through. I tell you he set the switch and started his car without a
  tremor. Katharine was nearly fainting. I was still fogged. He drove us into
  New York with scarcely a word. It was daylight when we reached our house in
  Riverside Drive. He drove up to the front door.</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps if you don't mind, Richard,' he said, 'you could lend me an
  overcoat. People are quite content to accept us as night joy-riders, but I am
  scarcely respectable for anything in the shape of a close examination.'</p>

  <p>"Then I saw that he was all over blood on one side. Katharine took him
  away and sponged him, although he laughed at it. Then he had me in the study
  and together we went through the stuff we'd brought away. He made me keep
  what Murchison had done me out of, and the rest he made into a packet,
  addressed ready for posting and left it on the table.</p>

  <p>"'For anything else that may happen, Dick,' he said, 'we must take our
  chance. I have had my suspicions of that man Murchison for a long time. My
  own opinion is that we shall hear nothing more about the matter.'"</p>

  <p>Nora turned and looked at her companion with big, startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"But it was Jake Hannaway," she exclaimed, "whom they accused of making a
  row!"</p>

  <p>He stopped her, without impatience but firmly.</p>

  <p>"Jake Hannaway died the next day," he said. "I must have hit him harder
  than I thought&mdash;or Jocelyn did! He had no relatives, no friends.
  Murchison put the whole trouble down to him, admitted that there was a row
  over a game of cards, and a free fight. The other two swore to exactly the
  same story. Our names&mdash;mine and Jocelyn's, were never brought in.
  Murchison never came near me again. I have never seen him since. That's the
  whole story."</p>

  <p>"What about the police examination?" she asked curiously. "I know no more
  than you do," he replied. "I expect Murchison had a pull, and he was
  terrified of Jocelyn Thew. I&mdash;I went to Jake Hannaway's funeral," the
  young man went on, with a slight quiver in his tone. "I've seen his face,
  Nora, up in the clouds. I've seen it when I've been flying ten thousand feet
  up. Suddenly a little piece of black sky would open and I'd see him looking
  down at me!"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. From somewhere through the repeatedly opened
  swing doors came the rise and fall of music, played from a distant orchestra.
  There were peals of laughter from a cheerful party at the other end of the
  little room. Nora patted her companion's arm gently, and his eyes and manner
  became more natural.</p>

  <p>"It's done me good to tell you this," he said, half apologetically.
  "Katharine's the only other living creature I've dared to speak to about it,
  and she was there&mdash;she saw! Nora, that man can fight like a tiger!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she whispered. "Here he comes."</p>

  <p>The swing door was opened and Jocelyn Thew, back from his visit to the box
  office at the Alhambra, entered the room. He raised his eye brows a little as
  he saw the pair. Then he advanced towards them.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, for the moment I had quite forgotten," he confided, as he
  sank into an easy-chair by their side. "Of course, you two are old
  acquaintances."</p>

  <p>Nora murmured something. Richard Beverley rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd better be getting along," he said. "It's been fine to see you
  again, Nora," he added, taking her hand in his. "See you later, Thew."</p>

  <p>He nodded with something of his old jauntiness and swung out of the room.
  They both watched him in silence.</p>

  <p>"Not quite the young man he was," Jocelyn Thew observed thoughtfully. "Is
  it my fancy, I wonder, or does he drink a few too many cocktails when he is
  on leave?"</p>

  <p>"Richard Beverley's all right," Nora answered. "He is more sensitive than
  he seems, and there's an ugly little corner in his life to live down. He is
  doing the best he can to atone. Jocelyn," she went on, with a sudden
  earnestness in her tone, "you're going to leave him alone, aren't you? You
  haven't any scheme in your head for making use of him?"</p>

  <p>"One never knows," was the cool reply.</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Jocelyn," she said, "you're a hard man. You set your hand to a task and
  you don't care whom in the world you sacrifice to gain your end. You were a
  fine friend to Richard Beverley once, but surely his sister has done her best
  to pay his debt? Don't do anything that will make him ashamed of the uniform
  he wears."</p>

  <p>"Very pretty," he murmured approvingly, "but I must take you back to your
  own words&mdash;they were true enough. When I have a task to perform, when I
  pledge myself to a certain thing, I do it, and I must make use of those whom
  fate puts in my way. Richard Beverley and his sister are a very attractive
  couple, but if circumstances decree that they are the pawns by means of which
  I can win the game, then I must make use of them.&mdash;Dear me," he added,
  "my friend Crawshay! I fear that I shall be <i>de trop</i>."</p>

  <p>Nora turned to greet the newcomer, and Thew sauntered away with a little
  bow of farewell, quite courteous, even gracious. With the handle of the door
  in his hand, however, he paused and came back.</p>

  <p>"My friend Crawshay," he said, "one word with you."</p>

  <p>Crawshay turned around.</p>

  <p>"With pleasure!"</p>

  <p>"Those henchmen of yours&mdash;they are so stupid, so flagrantly obvious.
  I am a good-tempered person, but they irritated me this afternoon at
  Euston."</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" Crawshay asked. "However, you must not let them get on
  your nerves. They follow you about only as a matter of form. We must keep up
  the old legends, you know. When," he added, dropping his eyeglass and
  polishing it slowly, "when we really come to the end of this most fascinating
  little episode, I do not fancy that you will have cause to complain of our
  methods."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your cryptic words have struck the right note," he confessed. "The thrill
  of fear is in my veins. One more word, though. Miss Nora Sharey is an old
  friend of mine. There is a tie between us at which you could not guess.
  Lavish your attentions on her in the hope of hearing something which will
  prove to your advantage, but do not trifle with her affections. If you do, I
  shall constitute myself her guardian and there will be trouble,
  Crawshay&mdash;trouble."</p>

  <p>Once more he turned away, with a smile at Nora and a little nod to
  Crawshay. He passed through the door and disappeared, erect, lithe and
  graceful. Nora looked after him, and her eyes were filled with
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"I think," she sighed, "although I am getting fonder of you every moment,
  Mr. Crawshay," she added, as she saw from underneath the tissue paper the
  huge bunch of white roses he was carrying, "that my money will go on Jocelyn
  Thew."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">About three-thirty on the following afternoon, in the
  grounds devoted to the much advertised Red Cross Sale, that eminent comedian,
  Mr. Joseph Bobby, mounted to the temporary rostrum which had been erected for
  him at the rear of one of the largest tents, amidst a little storm of half
  facetious applause. He repaid the general expectation by gazing steadfastly
  at a few friends amongst the audience in his usual inimitable fashion, and by
  indulging in a few minutes of gagging chaff before he proceeded to business.
  A little way off, a military band was playing popular selections. The broad
  avenues between the marquees were crowded with streams of pretty women in
  fancy dresses, and mankind with a little money in his pocket was having a
  particularly uneasy time. There was nothing to distinguish this from any
  other of the Red Cross f&ecirc;tes of the season, except, perhaps, its added
  magnificence.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," the comedian began, "I am here to sell by auction
  the boxes at the Alhambra Theatre for to-night, when, as you know, there will
  be the greatest performance ever given by the largest number of star
  artistes&mdash;myself included. Owing to a slight difference of opinion with
  the management, who, as you are probably aware, ladies and gentlemen, are the
  thickest-headed set of blighters in existence&mdash;" Loud cries of "No!"
  from the managing director in the front row.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;I have only the four large boxes to dispose of. I shall start with
  Box B. Who will make me an offer for Box B? Who will offer me, say,
  twenty-five guineas to start the bidding?"</p>

  <p>Half-a-dozen offers were immediately made, and Box B was disposed of for
  thirty-five guineas. Boxes C and D fetched a little more.</p>

  <p>"We now come," the auctioneer concluded impressively, "to the
  <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>, if I may so call it. Box A
  is&mdash;well, you all know Box A, ladies and gentlemen, so I will simply say
  that it is the best box in the house. It will hold all the friends any man
  breathing has any use for. It would hold the largest family who ever received
  the Queen's bounty. Box A is one of those elastic boxes, ladies and
  gentlemen, which have no limit. You can fill it chock full, and if the right
  person knocks at the door there will still be room for another. Who will
  start the bidding at forty guineas?"</p>

  <p>"I will give you fifty," Jocelyn Thew said, promptly raising his hand.</p>

  <p>The auctioneer leaned forward, expecting to see a familiar face. He saw
  instead a very distinguished-looking and remarkably well-turned-out stranger,
  smiling pleasantly at him from the front row of the audience.</p>

  <p>"You are a man, sir," the former declared warmly. "You are giving me a
  good push off. Fifty guineas is bidden, ladies and gentlemen, for Box A."</p>

  <p>"I'll go to fifty-five," a well-known racing man called out from the rear.
  "Not a penny more, Joe, so don't get faking the bidding."</p>

  <p>The comedian assumed an air of grieved surprise.</p>

  <p>"That from you I did not expect, Mr. Mason," he said. "However, that you
  may have no cause for complaint, I am prepared to knock Box A down to you for
  fifty-five guineas, barring any advance."</p>

  <p>"Sixty," Jocelyn Thew bid.</p>

  <p>The auctioneer noted the advance with thanks. Then he looked towards the
  betting man, who shook his head. The auctioneer, who was rather wanting to
  get away, raised his hammer with an air of finality.</p>

  <p>"Going at sixty guineas, then."</p>

  <p>"Sixty-five," a new bidder intervened.</p>

  <p>The comedian, with his hammer already poised in the air, paused in some
  surprise. A clean-shaven man in dark grey clothes and a bowler hat, a man who
  had somehow the air of being a little out of his element in this galaxy of
  pleasure seekers, caught his eye.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-five you said, sir. Very good. Going at sixty-five."</p>

  <p>"Seventy," Jocelyn Thew bid.</p>

  <p>"Seventy-five."</p>

  <p>"Eighty."</p>

  <p>"Eighty-five."</p>

  <p>"Ninety."</p>

  <p>"Ninety-five."</p>

  <p>"One hundred guineas," Jocelyn Thew bid, turning with a good-natured smile
  to glance at his opponent.</p>

  <p>The auctioneer drew himself up. The contest had begun to interest him.
  Every one in the room was standing on tiptoe to watch.</p>

  <p>"One hundred guineas is bid by my friend in the front," he declared. "A
  very princely offer. Shall I knock it down at that?"</p>

  <p>One hundred and twenty was promptly bidden by the newcomer. Jocelyn Thew
  smiled up at the auctioneer.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I've invited my party so I suppose I'll have to stick to
  it. I'll make it a hundred and fifty."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and sixty."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and seventy-five."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty."</p>

  <p>The comedian's flow of badinage had ceased. An intense silence reigned in
  the marquee. He, in common with many of the others, was beginning to
  recognise a note of something unusual in this duel.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty guineas is a very handsome sum for the box," he
  said, leaning forward. "Perhaps some arrangement could be made, Mr.
  &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My name is Jocelyn Thew. The two hundred and fifty guineas bid is mine. I
  have the notes here ready."</p>

  <p>The auctioneer turned towards the other bidder appealingly.</p>

  <p>"I am acting under instructions," the latter said, "and I am not at
  liberty to make any arrangements to share the box."</p>

  <p>"In that case, the bid against you at the present moment is two hundred
  and fifty guineas," the auctioneer told him. "Of course, the more money we
  get, the better&mdash;the Red Cross can do with it&mdash;but it seems to me
  that the present bid is adequate. If no arrangement is possible, however, I
  must continue the auction."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and seventy-five guineas."</p>

  <p>"Three hundred," Jocelyn Thew replied coolly. "One moment, Mr. Bobby."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward and whispered in the comedian's ear. The latter nodded
  and turned to the rival bidder.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand, sir," he enquired, "that this is strictly a cash
  affair? I must have notes for the amount at the conclusion of the sale."</p>

  <p>"You will have to wait until I get them, then," was the anxious reply. "I
  only brought two hundred and fifty with me."</p>

  <p>The comedian shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There can be no question of waiting," he decided. "If two hundred and
  fifty guineas is all that you have with you, then the box must go to the
  other gentleman for three hundred guineas."</p>

  <p>"If we'd only thought of mentioning the matter of cash before," Jocelyn
  Thew said pleasantly, "it seems to me that I might have saved a little money.
  However, I don't grudge it to the cause."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur of applause, and before any further word could
  be said, the auctioneer's hammer dropped. Jocelyn Thew stepped up to his side
  and counted out three hundred guineas in notes, receiving in return the
  admission ticket for the box. The comedian shook hands with him.</p>

  <p>"A very generous contribution, sir," he declared. "I shall do myself the
  pleasure of remembering it to-night."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew made some suitable reply and strolled leisurely off, his eyes
  searching everywhere for his unsuccessful rival. He found him at last in the
  main avenue, on his way to the principal exit, and touched him on the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"One moment, sir," he begged.</p>

  <p>The young man paused. When he saw who his interlocutor was, however, he
  attempted to hurry on.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me," he began, "I am pressed for time."</p>

  <p>"I will walk with you as far as the gate," Jocelyn Thew said. "I am very
  curious concerning your bidding for Box A. Can't you let me know for whom you
  were trying to buy it? It is possible that I might feel inclined to
  resell."</p>

  <p>"My instructions were to buy the box by auction, and to go up to five
  hundred pounds for it," was the somewhat hesitating reply. "I am
  unfortunately not in a position to divulge the name of my client."</p>

  <p>"You can at least tell me your own name, or the name of the firm whom you
  represent?"</p>

  <p>The young man quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you nothing," he said firmly. "Good afternoon!"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew strolled thoughtfully back, made a few purchases wherever he
  was accosted, but had always the air of a man who is seeking to solve some
  problem. Issuing from one of the tents, he came suddenly face to face with
  Katharine and her brother.</p>

  <p>"You are too late for the auction," the latter declared, as they shook
  hands, "and you wouldn't have got your box, anyhow. Do you know what it
  fetched?"</p>

  <p>"Three hundred guineas," Jocelyn Thew replied with a smile. "I bought it
  at that."</p>

  <p>They both stared at him.</p>

  <p>"For three hundred guineas?" Richard repeated.</p>

  <p>"I was rather lucky to get it at that. There was an anonymous bidder who
  fortunately hadn't got the cash with him, or I gathered that he was willing
  to go to a great deal more."</p>

  <p>They stood for a moment in silence. Katharine laughed a little
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A little obstinacy on the part of a millionaire, I suppose," Jocelyn Thew
  replied carelessly. "By-the-by, if it suits you we will meet at the theatre
  this evening, instead of dining. I know that you will like to have a little
  time alone with your brother, as he is off to-night, Miss Beverley, and I
  have a business friend coming in to see me about dinner time. I shall be in
  the box, awaiting you, say at half-past eight. You'll be close to Charing
  Cross, won't you, Richard, and you won't have to leave until ten
  o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," the young man agreed. "It's a jolly good send-off for
  me."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew made his farewells and strolled down one of the narrow
  avenues which led to the exit. About half-way down, he came suddenly face to
  face with Nora and Crawshay. They all three stood together, talking, for a
  few moments. Suddenly Crawshay, who appeared to see some one in the crowd,
  turned away. "Will you excuse me for one moment, Miss Sharey?" he said.
  "Perhaps Mr. Thew will take care of you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Jocelyn Thew observed, as he watched Crawshay disappear, "you
  need some taking care of, eh, Nora?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. Her eyes sought his. She looked at him
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Well," she exclaimed, "London's a dull place all alone. So's life."</p>

  <p>"I am not interfering in your choice of residence or companionship," he
  replied, "although it seems strange that you, whom I think I may call my
  friend, should choose to amuse yourself with the one person in life who is my
  open enemy, the one man who has sworn to bring about my downfall."</p>

  <p>"There isn't any man in the world will ever do that," she declared, "and
  you know it. You are afraid of no one. You've no cause to be."</p>

  <p>"That may be true," he agreed, "but since we have the opportunity of these
  few moments' conversation, Nora, there is one thing I wish to say to you. I
  place no embargo upon your friendship with Mr. Crawshay. I do not presume to
  dictate to you even as to the subjects of your conversation with him. Tell
  him what pleases you. Talk to him about me, if you will&mdash;you will find
  him always interested. But there is one thing. If your lips should ever
  breathe a word of that other name of mine, or of those other things connected
  with my personal history of which you know, I warn you, Nora, that it will be
  a very bad day for you. It will be the one unforgivable thing, and I never
  forgive." Nora shivered, although the afternoon sun was streaming down upon
  them. Her cheeks were a little paler.</p>

  <p>"No," she murmured, "I know that. You would never forgive. You are as hard
  as the rocks. All the time since I have known you, I have tried to soften you
  ever so little, just because I was fool enough to like you, fool enough to
  believe that it was just suffering which had made you what you are. That
  belongs to the past. When I think of you now, my heart is like a stone,
  because I know that there is no love in you, nor any of those other things
  for which a woman craves. I should be very sorry indeed, Jocelyn Thew, for
  any woman who ever cared for you, and for her own sake I pray very much that
  there is no one at the present moment who does."</p>

  <p>A light breeze was blowing over the place. They were standing a little
  apart, in the shadow of a tree, and the hum of conversation and laughter, the
  noisy appeals of the vendors of flowers and other trifles, the strident
  voices from a distant stage, the far-off strains of swaying music, seemed
  blended together in an insistent and not inharmonious chorus. Jocelyn Thew
  stood as though listening to them for a moment. His eyes were following a
  tall figure in white, walking, a little listlessly by her brother's side.
  When he spoke, his tone was unusually soft.</p>

  <p>"I always told you what you seem to have discovered, Nora," he said. "I
  always told you that behind the driving force of my life was much hate but no
  love, nor any capacity for love. That may not have been my fault. If we were
  in another place," he went on, "I somehow feel that I might tell you what I
  have never told anybody else&mdash;the real story that lay behind the things
  you know of, things the memory of which was brought back to me only last
  night. Even now that may come, but for the present, Nora, remember. What you
  know of me that lies behind that curtain, must never pass your lips."</p>

  <p>"I promise," she murmured. "Here comes Mr. Crawshay."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew raised his hat, smiled at Nora and strolled away. He smiled
  also a little to himself, but not so pleasantly. The man from whom Crawshay
  had just parted, and with whom he had been in close conversation, was the man
  who had been bidding against him for Box A at the Alhambra that night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">From six o'clock until half an hour before the time fixed
  for the commencement of the performance, a steady crowd of people elbowed and
  pushed their way that night into the cheaper parts of the Alhambra
  Music-hall. Soon afterwards, the earliest arrivals presented themselves at
  the front of the house. Brightman and Crawshay arrived together, and made
  their way at once to the manager's office, the former noticing, with a little
  glint of recognition which amounted to scarcely more than a droop of the
  eyes, two or three sturdy looking men who had the appearance of being a
  little unused to their evening clothes, and who were loitering about in the
  vestibule.</p>

  <p>The manager greeted his two visitors without enthusiasm. He was a small,
  worried-looking man, with pale face, hooked nose and shiny black hair. He had
  recently changed his name from Jonas to Joyce, without materially affecting
  the impression which he made upon the stranger.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Crawshay," Brightman began, "who has charge from the
  Government point of view, of the little matter you and I know about."</p>

  <p>The manager shook hands limply.</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, Mr. Crawshay," he said, "but a little disturbed at the
  cause. I must say that I hope you will find your impressions ill-founded. I
  don't like things of this sort happening in my house."</p>

  <p>"Might happen anywhere," Mr. Brightman declared, with an attempt at
  cheerfulness. "By-the-by, Mr. Joyce, I hope you got my note?"</p>

  <p>The manager nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he assented, "I've made all the arrangements you wished, and the
  box has not been entered except by the cleaner."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thew himself, then, has made no attempt to visit it?" Crawshay
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not to my knowledge," was the brusque reply.</p>

  <p>The two men took their leave, strolled along the vestibule, glanced at the
  closed door of the box and made their way down into the stalls.</p>

  <p>"Our friend must be exceedingly confident," Brightman remarked
  musingly.</p>

  <p>"Or else we are on the wrong tack," Crawshay put in.</p>

  <p>"As to that we shall see! I don't like to seem over-sanguine," Brightman
  went on, "but my impression is that he is rather up against it."</p>

  <p>"All I can say is that he is taking it very coolly, then!"</p>

  <p>"To all appearance, yes. But whereas it is quite true that he has made no
  attempt to get at the box, Joyce didn't tell us&mdash;as a matter of fact, I
  don't suppose he knows&mdash;that three times Jocelyn Thew has visited the
  theatre under some pretext or other, and spotted my men about. From
  half-an-hour after his bid at the fete, that box has been as inaccessible to
  him as though it had been walled up."</p>

  <p>They took their seats in the stalls, which were now rapidly filling. About
  five minutes later, Jocelyn Thew arrived alone. The box opener brought him
  from the vestibule, and an amateur programme seller accepted his
  sovereign&mdash;both, in view of the many rumours floating about the place,
  regarding him with much curiosity. Without any appearance of hurry he entered
  the much-discussed box, divested himself of his coat and hat, and stood for a
  moment in full view, looking around the house. His eyes rested for a moment
  upon the figures of the two men below, and a very grim smile parted his lips.
  He stepped a little into the background and remained for some time out of
  sight. Brightman's interest became intense.</p>

  <p>"From this moment he is our man," he whispered. "All the same, I should
  have liked to have seen where he has hidden the papers. I went round the box
  myself without finding a thing."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew had hung up his coat and hat upon one of the pegs, and for a
  few seconds remained as though listening. Then he turned the key of the door,
  and, taking the heavy curtain up in his hand, searched it for a few moments
  until he arrived at a certain spot in one of the bottom folds. With a
  penknife which he drew from his pocket, he cut through some improvised
  stitches, thrust his hand into the opening and drew out a small packet, which
  he buttoned up in his pocket. In less than a minute he had let the curtain
  fall again and unlocked the door. Almost immediately afterwards there was a
  knock.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he invited.</p>

  <p>Katharine and her brother entered, the former in a gown of black net
  designed by the greatest of French modistes, and Richard in active service
  uniform.</p>

  <p>"We are abominably early, of course," Katharine declared, as they shook
  hands, "but I love to see the people arrive, and as it is Dick's last evening
  he couldn't bear the thought of losing a minute of it."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew busied himself in establishing his guests comfortably. He
  himself remained standing behind Katharine's chair, a little in the
  background.</p>

  <p>"We are going to have a great performance to-night," he observed. "Exactly
  what time does your train go, Richard?"</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock from Charing Cross."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew thrust his hand into his pocket, and Richard, rising to his
  feet, stepped back into the shadows of the box. Something passed between
  them. Katharine turned her head and clutched nervously at the programme which
  lay before her. She was looking towards them, and her face was as pale as
  death. Her host stepped forward at once and smiled pleasantly down at
  her.</p>

  <p>"You will not forget," he whispered, "that we are likely be the centre of
  observation to-night. I see that our friends Brightman and Crawshay are
  already amongst the audience."</p>

  <p>Katharine picked up her program and affected to examine it. "If only
  to-night were over!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"It is strange that you should feel like that," he observed, drawing his
  chair up to the front of the box and leaning towards her in conversational
  fashion. "Now to me half the evils of life lie in anticipation. When the time
  of danger actually arrives, those evils seem to take to themselves wings and
  fly away. Take the case of a great actress on her first night, an emotional
  and temperamental woman, besieged by fears until the curtain rises, and then
  carried away by her genius even unto the heights. Our curtain has risen, Miss
  Beverley. All we can do is to pray that the gods may look our way."</p>

  <p>She studied him thoughtfully for a moment. It was obvious that he was not
  exaggerating. His granite-like face had never seemed more immovable. His tone
  was perfectly steady, his manner the manner of one looking forward to a
  pleasant evening. Yet he knew quite well what she, too, guessed&mdash;that
  his enemies were closing in around him, that the box itself was surrounded,
  that notwithstanding all his ingenuity and all his resource, a crisis had
  come which seemed insuperable. She was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of
  the pity of it. All the admiration she had ever felt for his strange
  insouciance, his almost bravado-like coolness, his mastery over events,
  seemed suddenly to resolve itself into more definite and more
  clearly-comprehended emotion. It was the great pity of it all which suddenly
  appealed to her. She leaned a little forward.</p>

  <p>"You have called this our last evening," she whispered. "Tell me one
  thing, won't you? Tell me why it must be?"</p>

  <p>The softness in her eyes was unmistakable, and his own face for a moment
  relaxed wonderfully. Again there was that gleam almost of tenderness in his
  deep-blue eyes. Nevertheless, he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Whether I succeed or whether I fail," he said simply, "to-night ends our
  associations. Don't you understand," he went on, "that if I pass from the
  shadow of this danger, there is another more imminent, more certain?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a single moment, and his voice, which had grown softer,
  became suddenly almost musical. Katharine, who was listening intently,
  realised like a flash that for the first moment the mask had fallen away.</p>

  <p>"I have lived for many years with that other danger," he went on. "It has
  lain like a shadow always in front of my path. Perhaps that is why I have
  become what I am, why I have never dared to hope for the other things which
  are dear to every one."</p>

  <p>Her hand suddenly gripped his. They sat there for a moment in a strange,
  disturbing silence. Then the orchestra ceased, the curtain was rung up, the
  performance, which was in the nature of a music-hall show, with frequent
  turns and changes, commenced. Popular favourites from every department of the
  theatrical world, each in turn claimed attention and applause. Katharine
  watched it all with an interest always strained, a gaiety somewhat
  hysterical; Jocelyn Thew with the measured pleasure of a critic; Richard with
  uproarious, if sometimes a little unreal merriment. The time slipped by
  apparently unnoticed. Suddenly Richard glanced at his wrist-watch and stood
  up.</p>

  <p>"I must go," he declared. "I had no idea that it was so late." Katharine's
  fingers clutched the program which lay crumpled up in her hand. She looked at
  her brother with almost frightened eyes. Their host, too, had risen to his
  feet, and down-stairs in the stalls two men had slipped out of their places.
  Jocelyn Thew threw back his head with a little familiar gesture. The light of
  battle was in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Richard is right," he observed. "It is twenty minutes to ten."</p>

  <p>"My servant will meet me down there with my kit and get me a seat," the
  young man said. "I shall have plenty of time, but I think I had better make a
  start."</p>

  <p>Katharine came into the back of the box and threw her arms around her
  brother's neck. He stooped and kissed her on the lips and forehead.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, Katharine," he begged. "There is nothing to worry about."</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," Jocelyn Thew echoed. "The most serious contingency
  that I can see at present is that you may have to find your way home
  alone."</p>

  <p>"The number of the car is twenty," Beverley said, handing a ticket to his
  sister. "I'll send you a wire from Folkestone."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew suddenly held out his hand. His eyes were still flashing with
  the light of anticipated battle, but there was something else in his face
  reminiscent of that momentary softening.</p>

  <p>"Mine, I fear," he murmured, "may be but a wireless message, but I hope
  that you will get it."</p>

  <p>They departed, and Katharine, drawing her chair into the back of the box,
  faced many anxious moments of solitude. The two men made their way in
  leisurely fashion along the vestibule and turned upstairs towards the
  refreshment room. Half-way up, however, Jocelyn Thew laid his hand upon his
  companion's arm.</p>

  <p>"Dick," he said, "I think if I were you I wouldn't have another. You've
  only just time to catch your train, as it is."</p>

  <p>"Must have a farewell glass, old fellow," the young man protested.</p>

  <p>His companion was firm, however, and Beverley turned reluctantly away.
  They walked arm in arm down the broad entrance lounge towards the glass
  doors. It seemed to have become suddenly evident that Jocelyn Thew's words
  were not without point. Richard stumbled once and walked with marked
  unsteadiness. Just before they reached the doors, Brightman, with a tall,
  stalwart-looking friend, slipped past them on the right. Another man fell
  almost into line upon the left, and jostled the young officer as he did so.
  The latter glanced at both of them a little truculently.</p>

  <p>"Say, don't push me!" he exclaimed threateningly. "You keep clear."</p>

  <p>Neither of the men took any notice. The nearer one, in fact, closed in and
  almost prevented Beverley's further progress. Brightman leaned across.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Captain Beverley," he said, "but we wish to ask you a
  question. Will you step into the box office with us?"</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I will!" the young man answered. "I have a matter of ten
  minutes to catch my train at Charing Cross, and I'm not going to break my
  leave for you blighters."</p>

  <p>Crawshay, who had been lingering in the background, drew a little
  nearer.</p>

  <p>"Forgive my intervention, Captain Beverley," he said, "but the matter will
  be explained to the military authorities if by chance you should miss your
  train. I am afraid that we must insist upon your acceding to our
  request."</p>

  <p>Then followed a few seconds' most wonderful pandemonium. Jocelyn Thew's
  efforts seemed of the slightest, yet Mr. Brightman lay on his back upon the
  floor, and his stalwart companion, although he himself was not ignorant of
  Oriental arts, lay on his side for a moment, helpless. Richard, if not so
  subtle, was equally successful. His great fist shot out, and the man whose
  hand would have gripped his arm went staggering back, caught his foot in the
  edge of the carpet, and fell over upon the tesselated pavement. There were
  two swing doors, and Richard, with a spring, went for the right-hand one. The
  commissionaire guarding the other rushed to help his companion bar the exit.
  The two plainclothes policemen, whose recovery was instantaneous, scrambled
  to their feet and dashed after him, followed by Crawshay. Jocelyn Thew,
  scarcely accelerating his walk, strolled through the left-hand door, crossed
  the pavement of the Strand and vanished.</p>

  <p>Fortune was both kind and unkind to Richard in those next few breathless
  minutes. An old football player, his bent head and iron shoulder were
  sufficient for the commissionaires, and, plunging directly Across the
  pavement and the street, he leapt into a taxi which was crawling along in the
  direction of Charing Cross.</p>

  <p>"Give you a sovereign to get to Charing Cross in three minutes," he cried
  out, and the man, accepting the spirit of the thing, thrust in his clutch,
  eagerly. For a moment it seemed as though temporarily, at any rate, Richard
  would get clear away. In about fifty yards, however, there was a slight
  block. The door of the taxicab was wrenched open, and one of the men who were
  chasing him essayed to enter. Richard sent him without difficulty crashing
  back into the street, only to find that simultaneously the other door had
  been opened, and that his hands were held from behind in a grip of iron. At
  the same time he looked into the muzzle of Crawshay's revolver.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," the latter commanded.</p>

  <p>Brightman, too, was in the taxicab, and one of the other men had his foot
  upon the step. With a shrug of the shoulders, the young man accepted the
  inevitable and obeyed. Brightman leaned out of the window, gave a direction
  to the driver, and the taxicab was driven slowly in through the assembling
  crowd. Richard leaned back in his corner and glared at his two
  companions.</p>

  <p>"Say, this is nice behaviour to an officer!" he exclaimed truculently. "I
  am on my way to catch the leave train. How dare you interfere with me!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Crawshay remarked, "we may consider that the time has arrived
  for explanations."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better out with them quick," Richard continued angrily. "I am
  an officer in His Britannic Majesty's Service, come over to fight for you
  because you can't do your own job. Do you get that, Crawshay?"</p>

  <p>"I am listening."</p>

  <p>"I am on my way to catch the ten o'clock train from Charing Cross,"
  Richard went on. "If I don't catch it, my leave will be broken."</p>

  <p>"I feel sure," Crawshay remarked drily, "that the authorities will
  recognise the fact that you made every effort to do so. As a matter of fact,
  there will be a supplementary train leaving at ten-forty-five, which it is
  possible that you may be able to catch. Explanations such as I have to offer
  are not to be given in a taxicab. I have therefore directed the man to drive
  to my rooms, I trust that you will come quietly. If the result of our
  conversation is satisfactory, as I remarked before, you can still catch your
  train."</p>

  <p>Richard glanced at the man seated opposite to him&mdash;a great strong
  fellow who was obviously now prepared for any surprise; at Brightman, who,
  lithe and tense, seemed watching his every movement; at the little revolver
  which Crawshay, although he kept it out of sight, was still holding.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me I'm up against it," he muttered. "You'll have to pay for it
  afterwards, you fellows, I can tell you that."</p>

  <p>They accepted his decision in silence, and a few minutes later they
  descended outside the little block of flats in which Crawshay's rooms were
  situated. Richard made no further attempt to escape, stepped into the lift of
  his own accord, and threw himself into an easy-chair as soon as the little
  party entered Crawshay's sitting room. There was a gloomy frown upon his
  forehead, but the sight of a whisky decanter and a soda-water syphon upon the
  sideboard, appeared to cheer him up.</p>

  <p>"I think," he suggested tentatively, "that after the excitement of the
  last half-hour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will allow me to offer you a whisky and soda," Crawshay begged,
  mixing it and bringing it himself. "When you have drunk it, I have to tell
  you that it is our intention to search you."</p>

  <p>"What the devil for?" the young man demanded, with the tumbler still in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"We suspect you of having in your possession certain documents of a
  treasonous nature."</p>

  <p>"Documents?" Richard jeered. "Don't talk nonsense! And treasonous to whom?
  I am an American citizen."</p>

  <p>"That," Crawshay reminded him, "is entirely contrary to your declaration
  when a commission in His Majesty's Flying Corps was granted to you. The
  immediate question, however, is are you going to submit to search or
  not?"</p>

  <p>Richard glanced at that ominous glitter in Crawshay's right hand, glanced
  at Brightman, and at the giant who was standing barely a yard away, and
  shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you must do what you want to," he acquiesced sullenly, "but
  you'll have to answer for it&mdash;I can tell you that. It's a damnable
  liberty!"</p>

  <p>He drank up his whisky and soda and set down the empty glass. The search
  which proceeded took a very few moments. Soon upon the table was gathered the
  usual collection of such articles as a man in Richard's position might be
  expected to possess, and last of all, from the inside of his vest, next to
  his skin, was drawn a long blue envelope, fastened at either end with a
  peculiar green seal. Crawshay's heart beat fast as he watched it placed upon
  the table. Richard seemed to have lost much of his truculence of manner.</p>

  <p>"That packet," he declared, "is my personal property. It contains nothing
  of any moment whatever, nothing which would be of the least interest to
  you."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Brightman promised, "it will be returned to you. Mr.
  Crawshay," he added, turning towards him, "I must ask you, as you represent
  the Government in this matter, to break these seals and acquaint yourself
  with the nature of the contents of this envelope, which I have reason to
  suppose was handed to Captain Beverley by Jocelyn Thew, a few minutes
  ago."</p>

  <p>Crawshay took the envelope into his hands.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Captain Beverley," he declared, "but I must do as Mr.
  Brightman has suggested. This man Jocelyn Thew, with whom you have been in
  constant association, is under very grave suspicion of having brought to
  England documents of a treasonable nature."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Richard said defiantly, "you must do as you d&mdash;&mdash;d
  well please. My time will come afterwards."</p>

  <p>Crawshay broke the seal, thrust his hand into the envelope and drew out a
  pile of closely folded papers. One by one he laid them upon the table and
  smoothed them out. Even before he had glanced at the first one, a queer
  presentiment seemed suddenly to chill the blood in his veins. His eyes became
  a trifle distended. They were all there now, a score or more of sheets of
  thin foreign note paper, covered with hand-writing of a distinctly feminine
  type. The two men read&mdash;Richard Beverley watched them scowling!</p>

  <p>"What the mischief little May Boswell's letters have to do with you
  fellows, I can't imagine!" he muttered. "Go on reading, you bounders! Much
  good may they do you!"</p>

  <p>There were minutes of breathless silence. Then Crawshay, as the last sheet
  slipped through his fingers, glanced stealthily into Brightman's face, saw
  him bite through his lips till the blood came and strike the table with his
  clenched fist.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he exclaimed, snatching up the telephone receiver. "Jocelyn Thew
  has done us again!"</p>

  <p>"And you let him walk out!" Crawshay groaned.</p>

  <p>"We'll find him," Brightman shouted. "Here, Central! Give me Scotland
  Yard. Scotland Yard, quick! Johnson, you take a taxi to the Savoy."</p>

  <p>Unnoticed, Richard Beverley had risen to his feet and helped himself to
  another whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"If you are now convinced," he said, turning towards them, "that I am
  carrying nothing more treasonable than the love letters of my best girl, I
  should be glad to know what you have to say to me on the subject of my
  detention?"</p>

  <p>Crawshay for once forgot his manners.</p>

  <p>"Damn your detention!" he replied. "Get off and catch your train."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the extreme edge of a stony and wide-spreading moor,
  Jocelyn Thew suddenly brought the ancient motor-car which he was driving to a
  somewhat abrupt and perilous standstill. He stood up in his seat,
  unrecognisable, transformed. From his face had passed the repression of many
  years. His lips were gentle and quivering as a woman's, his eyes seemed to
  have grown larger and softer as they swept with a greedy, passionate gaze the
  view at his feet. All that was hard and cruel seemed to have passed suddenly
  from his face. He was like a poet or a prophet, gazing down upon the land of
  his desires.</p>

  <p>Behind him lay the rolling moor, cloven by that one ribbonlike stretch of
  uneven road, broken here and there with great masses of lichen-covered grey
  rock, by huge clumps of purple heather, long, glittering streaks of yellow
  gorse. The morning was young, and little shrouds of white mist were still
  hanging around. His own clothes were damp. Little beads of moisture were upon
  his face. But below, where the Atlantic billows came thundering in upon a
  rock-strewn coast, the sun, slowly gathering strength, seemed to be rolling
  aside the feathery grey clouds. Downwards, split with great ravines, the road
  now sloped abruptly to a little plateau of farmland, on the seaward edge of
  which stood the ruins of a grey castle. Dotted here and there about that
  pastoral strip and on the opposite hillside, were a few white-washed
  cottages. Beyond these no human habitation, no other sign of life.</p>

  <p>The traveller gazed downwards till he suddenly found a new mist before his
  eyes. Nothing was changed. Everywhere he looked upon familiar objects. There
  was the little harbour where he had moored his boat, scarcely more than a
  pool surrounded by those huge masses of jagged rocks; the fields where he had
  played, the cave in the cliffs where he had sat and dreamed. This was his own
  little corner, the land which his forefathers had sworn to deliver, the land
  for which his father had died, for which he had become an exile, to which he
  returned with the price of death upon his head.</p>

  <p>After a while he slipped down from the car, examined the brakes, mounted
  to his seat and commenced the precipitous descent. Skilful driver though he
  was, more than once he was compelled to turn into the cliff side of the road
  in order to check his gathering speed. At last, however, he reached the
  lowlands in safety. On the left-hand side now was the rock-strewn beach, and
  the almost deafening roar of the Atlantic. On the right and in front, fields,
  no longer like patchwork but showing some signs of cultivation; here and
  there, indeed, the stooping forms of labourers&mdash;men, drab-coloured,
  unnoticeable; women in bright green and scarlet shawls and short petticoats.
  He passed a little row of whitewashed cottages, from whose doorways and
  windows the children and old people stared at him with strange eyes. One old
  man who met his gaze crossed himself hastily and disappeared. Jocelyn Thew
  looked after him with a bitter smile upon his lips. He knew so well the cause
  of the terror.</p>

  <p>He came at last to the great gates leading to the ruined castle, gates
  whose pillars were surmounted by huge griffins. He looked at the deserted
  lodges, the coat of arms, nothing of which remained but a few drooping
  fragments. He shook the iron gates, which still held together, in vain.
  Finally he drove the car through an opening in the straggling fence, and up
  the long, grass-grown avenue, until he reached the building itself. Here he
  descended, walked along the weed-framed flags to the arched front door, by
  the side of which hung the rusty and broken fragments of a bell, at which he
  pulled for some moments in vain. To all appearances the place was entirely
  deserted. No one answered his shout, or the wheezy summons of the cracked and
  feeble bell. He passed along the front, barely out of reach of the spray
  which a strong west wind was bringing from seaward, looked in through
  deserted windows till he came at last to a great crack in the walls, through
  which he stepped into a ruined apartment. It was thus that he entered the
  home in which he had been born.</p>

  <p>He made his way into a stone passage, along which he passed until a door
  on his right yielded to his touch. In front of him now were what had been the
  state apartments, stretching along the whole front of the castle save the
  little corner where he had entered. Here was dilapidation supreme, complete.
  The white, stone-flagged floor knew no covering save here and there a strip
  of torn matting. The walls were stained with damp. At long intervals were
  tables and chairs of jet-black oak, in all sorts and states of decay. On one
  or two remained the fragments of some crimson velvet,&mdash;on the back of
  one, remnants of a coat of arms! And here, entirely in keeping with the scene
  of desolation, were the first signs of human life&mdash;an old man with a
  grey beard, leaning upon a stick, who walked slowly back and forth, mumbling
  to himself.</p>

  <p>A new light broke across Jocelyn Thew's face as he listened, and the tears
  stood in his eyes. The man was reciting Gaelic verses, verses familiar to him
  from childhood. The whole desolate picture seemed to envisage thoughts which
  he had never been able to drive from his mind, seemed in the person of this
  old man to breathe such incomparable, unalterable fidelity that he felt
  himself suddenly a traitor who had slipped unworthily away and hidden from a
  righteous doom. Better that his blood had been spilt and his bones buried in
  the soil of the land than to have become a fugitive, to have placed an ocean
  between himself and the voices to which this old man had listened, day by day
  and night by night, through the years!</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew stole softly out of the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Timothy," he called quietly.</p>

  <p>The old man paused in his walk. Then he came forward towards the speaker
  and dropped on one knee. His face showed no surprise, though his eyes were
  strange and almost terribly brilliant.</p>

  <p>"The Cathley!" he exclaimed. "God is good!"</p>

  <p>He kissed his master's hand, which he had seized with almost frantic joy.
  Jocelyn Thew raised him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You recognised me then, Timothy?"</p>

  <p>"There is no Cathley in the world," the old man answered passionately,
  "would ever rise up before me and call himself by any other name."</p>

  <p>"Am I safe here, Timothy, for a day or two?"</p>

  <p>The old man's scorn was a wonderful thing.</p>

  <p>"Safe!" he repeated. "Safe! There is just a dozen miles or so of the
  Kingdom of Ireland where the stranger who came on evil business would
  disappear, and it's our pride that we are the centre of it."</p>

  <p>"They've held on, then, in these parts?"</p>

  <p>"Hold on? Why, the fire that smouldered has become a blaze," was the eager
  response. "Ireland is our country here. Why&mdash;you know?"</p>

  <p>"Know what?" Jocelyn Thew demanded. "You must treat me as a stranger,
  Timothy, I have been living under a false name. News has failed me for
  years."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know," the old man went on eagerly, "that they meet here in the
  castle, the men who count&mdash;Hagen, the poet, Matlaske, the lawyer,
  Indewick, Michael Dilwyn, Harrison, and the great O'Clory himself?"</p>

  <p>"I thought O'Clory was in prison since the Sinn Fein rising."</p>

  <p>"In prison, aye, but they daren't keep him there!" was the fierce reply.
  "They had a taste then of the things that are ablaze through the country. The
  O'Clory and the others will be here to-night, under your own roof. Aye, and
  the guard will be out, and there'll be no Englishman dare come within a dozen
  miles!"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew walked away to one of the great windows and looked out
  seaward. The old servant limped over to his side.</p>

  <p>"Your honour," he said, his voice shaking even as the hands which clasped
  his stick, "this is a wonderful day&mdash;sure, a wonderful day!"</p>

  <p>"For me, too, Timothy!"</p>

  <p>"You've been a weary time gone. Maybe you've lain hidden across the seas
  there&mdash;you've heard nothing."</p>

  <p>"I've heard little enough, Timothy," his master told him sadly. "There
  came a time when I put the newspapers away from me. I did it that I might
  keep sane."</p>

  <p>"You've missed much then, Sir Denis. There has been cruelty and
  wickedness, treason and murder afoot, but the spirit of the dear land has
  never even flickered in these parts. The arms we sent to Dublin were landed
  in yonder bay, and there was none to stop them, either, though they laid
  hands on that poor madman who well-nigh brought us all to ruin. There's
  strange craft rides there now, where your honour's looking."</p>

  <p>A silence fell between the two men. Presently the steward withdrew.</p>

  <p>"I'll be seeing after your honour's room," he murmured "and there's others
  to tell. There's a drop of something left, too, in the cellars, thank
  God!"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn Thew listened to the retreating footsteps and then for a moment
  pushed open the window. There was the old roar once more, which seemed to
  have dwelt in his ears; the salt sting, the scream of the pebbles, the cry of
  a wheeling gull. There was the headland round which he had sailed his yacht,
  the moorland over which he had wandered with his gun, the meadow round which
  he had tried the wild young horses. In those few seconds of ecstatic joy, he
  seemed for the first time to realise all that he had suffered during his long
  exile.</p>

  <p>More and more unreal seemed to grow the world in which Sir Denis Jocelyn
  Cathley passed that day. Time after time, the great hall in which he had
  played when a boy, draughty now but still moderately weather-tight, had
  echoed to the roars of welcome from old associates. But the climax of it all
  came later on, when he sat at the head of the long, black oak table,
  presiding over what was surely the strangest feast ever prepared and given to
  the strangest gathering of guests. The tablecloth of fine linen was patched
  and mended&mdash;here and there still in holes. Some of the dishes were of
  silver and others of kitchen china. There were knives and forks beautifully
  shaped and fashioned, mingled with the horn-handled ware of the kitchen;
  silver plate and common pewter side by side; priceless glass and common
  tumblers; fragments of beautiful china and here and there white delf,
  borrowed from a neighbouring farm. The fare was simple but plentiful; the
  only drink whisky and some ancient Marsala, in dust-covered bottles, produced
  by Timothy with great pride and served with his own hand. The roar which had
  greeted the first drinking of Sir Denis' health had scarcely died away when
  Michael Dilwyn led the way to the final sensation.</p>

  <p>"Denis, my boy," he said, "there's a trifle of mystery about you yet. Will
  you tell me then, why, when I spoke to you at the Savoy Restaurant the other
  night, you denied your own identity? Told me your name was Thew, or something
  like it, and I your father's oldest friend, and your own, too!"</p>

  <p>A sudden flood of recollection unlocked some of the fears in Denis
  Cathley's breast.</p>

  <p>"I have not used the name of Cathley for many years," he said. "Was it
  likely that I should own to it there, in the heart of London, with a price
  upon my head, and half a dozen people within earshot? I came back to England
  at the risk of my life, on a special errand. I scarcely dared to hope that I
  might meet any of you. I just wanted twelve hours here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop, lad!" Dilwyn interrupted. "What's that about a price on your head?
  You've missed none of our letters, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"Letters?" Sir Denis repeated. "I have had no word from this country, not
  even from Timothy here, for over three years and a half."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur of wonder. The truth was beginning to dawn upon
  them.</p>

  <p>"It'll be the censor, maybe," Michael Dilwyn murmured. "Tell us, Denis
  Cathley, what brought you back, then? What was this special errand you spoke
  of?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing I can discuss, even with you," was the grim answer. "It was a big
  risk, in more ways than one, but if to-night keeps calm I'll bring it
  off."</p>

  <p>"You've had no letters for three years," Michael Dilwyn repeated. "Why,
  d&mdash;&mdash;n it, boy," he exclaimed, striking the table with his fist,
  "maybe you don't know, then? You haven't heard of it?"</p>

  <p>"Heard of what?" Sir Denis demanded.</p>

  <p>"Your pardon!"</p>

  <p>"My&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"Your pardon," was the hoarse reply, "signed and sealed a year ago, before
  the Dublin matter. Things aren't as bad as they were! There's a different
  spirit abroad.&mdash;Pass him the Madeira, Hagan. Sure, this has unnerved
  him!"</p>

  <p>Sir Denis drank mechanically, drank until he felt the fire of the old wine
  in his veins. He set the glass down empty.</p>

  <p>"My pardon!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"It's true," Hagan assured him. "You were one of a dozen. I wrote you with
  my own hand to the last address we had from you, somewhere out on the west
  coast of America. Dilwyn's right enough. England has a Government at last.
  There are men there who want to find the truth. They know what we are and
  what we stand for. You can judge what I mean when I tell you that we speak as
  we please here, openly, and no one ventures to disturb us. Denis, they've
  begun to see the truth. Dilwyn here will tell you the same thing. He was in
  Downing Street only last week."</p>

  <p>"I was indeed&mdash;I, Michael Dilwyn, the outlaw!&mdash;and they listened
  to me."</p>

  <p>"The days are coming," Hagan continued, "for which we've pawned our lands,
  our relatives, and some of us our liberty. Please God there isn't one here
  that won't see a free Ireland! We've hammered it into their dull Saxon
  brains. It's been a long, drear night, but the dawn's breaking."</p>

  <p>"And I am pardoned!" Sir Denis repeated wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been to these three years, man, that you've heard
  nothing?" Michael Dilwyn asked.</p>

  <p>"In Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua, Uraguay. You're right. I've been out of the
  world. I crept out of it deliberately. When I left here, nothing seemed so
  hopeless as the thought that a time of justice might come. I cut myself off
  even from news. I have lived without a name and without a future."</p>

  <p>"Maybe for the best," Hagan declared cheerfully. "Remember that it's but
  twelve months ago since your pardon was signed, and you'd have done ill to
  have found your way back before then.&mdash;But what about this mission you
  spoke of?"</p>

  <p>Sir Denis looked down the table. Of servants there was only old Timothy at
  the sideboard, and of those who were gathered around his board there was not
  one whom he could doubt.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you about that," he promised, leaning a little forward. "You
  have read of the documents and the famous stolen letter which were supposed
  to have been brought over to England in a certain trunk, protected by the
  seal of a neutral country?"</p>

  <p>"Why, sure!" Michael Dilwyn murmured under his breath. "The box was to
  have been opened at Downing Street, but one heard nothing more of it."</p>

  <p>"The stolen letter," Hagan remarked, "was supposed to have been indiscreet
  enough to have brought about the ruin of a great man in America."</p>

  <p>Sir Denis nodded.</p>

  <p>"You've got the story all right," he said. "Well, those papers never were
  in that trunk. I brought them over myself in the <i>City of Boston</i>. I
  brought them over under the nose of a Secret Service man, and although the
  steamer and all of us on board were searched from head to foot in the Mersey
  before we were permitted to land."</p>

  <p>"And where are they now?" Michael Dilwyn asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Denis drew a long envelope from his pocket and laid it upon the table
  before him. Almost as he did so, another little sensation brought them all to
  their feet. They hurried to the window. From about a mile out seaward, a blue
  ball, followed by another, had shot up into the sky. Sir Denis watched for a
  moment steadily. Then he pointed to a bonfire which had been lighted on the
  beach.</p>

  <p>"That," he pointed out, "is my signal, and there is the answer. The
  documents you have all read about are in that envelope."</p>

  <p>There was a queer, protracted silence, a silence of doubt and
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>"It will be a German submarine, that," Michael Dilwyn declared. "She has
  come to pick up your papers, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"That's true," was the quiet answer. "I was to light the fire on the beach
  the moment I arrived. The blue balls were to be my answer."</p>

  <p>The O'Clory, a big, silent man, leaned over and laid his hand on his
  host's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"For the moment I do not know," Sir Denis confessed. "Advise me, all of
  you. I undertook this enterprise partly because of its danger, partly for a
  great sum of money which I should have handed over to our cause, partly
  because if I succeeded it would hurt England. Now I have come back and I find
  you all moved by a different spirit."</p>

  <p>"There isn't a man in this island," Michael Dilwyn said slowly, "who has
  hated England as I have. She has been our oppressor for generations, and in
  return we have given her the best of our sons, their life-blood, their
  genius, their souls. And yet, with it all there is a bond. Our children have
  married theirs, and when we've looked together over the side, we've seen the
  same things. We've made use of Germans, Denis, but I tell you frankly I hate
  them. There are two things every Irishman loves&mdash;justice and
  courage&mdash;and England went into this war in the great manner. She has
  done big things, and I tell you, in a sneaking sort of way we're proud. I am
  honest with you, you see, Denis. You can guess, from what I've said, what I'd
  do with that packet."</p>

  <p>Sir Denis turned to the O'Clory.</p>

  <p>"And you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My boy," was the reply, "sure Michael's right. I've hated England, I've
  shouldered a rifle against her, I've talked treason up and down the country,
  and I've known the inside of a prison. I've spat at her authority. I've said
  in plain words what I think of her&mdash;fat, commerce-ridden, smug, selfish.
  I've watched her bleed and been glad of it, but at the bottom of my heart I'd
  have liked to have seen her outstretched hand. Denis, lad, that's coming.
  We've got to remember that we, too, are a proud, obstinate, pig-headed race.
  We've got to meet that hand half-way, and when the moment comes I'd like to
  be the first to raise the boys round here and give the Germans hell!"</p>

  <p>Another blue ball shot up into the sky. Sir Denis took the packet of
  papers from the table and stood by the great open stone hearth. Michael
  Dilwyn moved to his side, a gaunt, impressive figure.</p>

  <p>"You're doing the right thing, Denis," he declared. "What fighting we've
  done, and any that we may still have to do with England, we'll do it on the
  surface. I was down at Queenstown when they brought in some of the bodies
  from the <i>Lusitania</i>. To Hell with such tricks! There's no Irishman yet
  has ever joined hands with those who war against women and babies."</p>

  <p>Denis drew a log of burning wood out on to the hearth and laid the packet
  deliberately upon it. He stood there watching the smoke curl upwards as the
  envelope shrivelled and the flames crept from one end to the other.</p>

  <p>"That seems a queer thing to do," he observed, with a dry little laugh.
  "I've carried my life in my hands for those papers, and there's a hundred
  thousand pounds waiting for them, not a mile away."</p>

  <p>"Blood-money, boy," the O'Clory reminded him, "and anyway there's a touch
  of the evil thing about strangers' gold.&mdash;Eh, but who's this?"</p>

  <p>A large motor-car had suddenly flashed by the window. With the instinct of
  past dangers, the little gathering of men drew close together. There was the
  sound of an impatient voice in the hall. The door was opened hurriedly and
  Crawshay stepped in. "It is a gentleman in a great hurry, your honour,"
  Timothy explained.</p>

  <p>Crawshay, dour and threatening, came a little further into the room.
  Behind him in the hall was a vision of his escort. Sir Denis looked up from
  the hearth with a poker in his hand.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he observed, "it seems to be your unfortunate destiny to be
  always five minutes too late in life."</p>

  <p>Crawshay's outstretched hand pointed denouncingly through the window
  towards the bay.</p>

  <p>"If I am too late this time," he declared, "then an act of treason has
  been committed. You know what it means, I suppose, to communicate with the
  enemy?"</p>

  <p>Denis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"As yet," he said, "we have held no communication with our visitors. If
  you doubt my word, come down on your knees with me and examine these
  ashes."</p>

  <p>Crawshay, with a little exclamation, crossed the floor and crouched down
  by the other's side. A word or two in the topmost document stared at him. The
  seal of the envelope had melted, and a little thread of green wax had made a
  strange pattern upon the stones.</p>

  <p>"Is this the end, then?" he demanded in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"It is the end," was the solemn reply. "Perhaps if you take the ashes away
  with you, you will be able to consider that honours are divided."</p>

  <p>"You burnt them&mdash;yourself?" Crawshay muttered, still wondering.
  "Every gentleman in this room," Denis replied, "is witness of the fact that I
  destroyed unopened the packet which I brought from America, barely five
  minutes ago."</p>

  <p>Crawshay stood upright once more. He was convinced but puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what induced you to do this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We will tell you presently. As for the submarine outside, well, as you
  see, he is still sending up blue lights."</p>

  <p>Crawshay gathered the ashes together and thrust them into an envelope.</p>

  <p>"Your friend will be trying some of our Irish whisky, Denis," Michael
  Dilwyn invited. "We are hoping to make the brand more popular in England
  before long."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One by one, the next morning, in all manner of vehicles, the
  guests left the Castle. Sir Denis bade them farewell, parting with some of
  them in the leaky hall of his ancestors, and with others out in the
  stone-flagged courtyard. Crawshay alone lingered, with the obvious air of
  having something further to say to his host. The two men strolled down
  together seaward to where the great rocks lay thick upon the stormy
  beach.</p>

  <p>"These," Sir Denis pointed out, "are supposed to be the marbles with which
  the great giant Cathley used to play. Tradition is a little vague upon the
  subject, but according to some of the legends he was actually an ancestor,
  and according to others a kind of patron saint.... Just look at my house,
  Crawshay! What would you do with a place like that?"</p>

  <p>They turned and faced its crumbling front, majestic in places, squalid in
  others, one whole wing open to the rain and winds, one great turret still as
  solid and strong as the rocks themselves.</p>

  <p>"It would depend very much," Crawshay replied, "upon the extremely sordid
  question of how much money I had to spend. If I had enough, I should
  certainly restore it. It's a wonderful situation."</p>

  <p>The eyes of its owner glowed as he swept the outline of the storm-battered
  country and passed on to the rich strip of walled-in fields above.</p>

  <p>"It is my home," he said simply. "I shall live in no other place. If this
  matter which we discussed last night should indeed prove to have a solid
  foundation, if this even should be the beginning of the end of the great
  struggle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it is," Crawshay interrupted. "How can you doubt it if you have read
  the papers during the last six months?"</p>

  <p>"I have scarcely glanced at an English newspaper for ten years," was his
  companion's reply. "I fled to America, hating England as a man might do some
  poisonous reptile, sternly determined never to set foot upon her shores
  again. I left without hope. It seemed to me that she was implacable. The war
  has changed many things."</p>

  <p>"You are right," Crawshay admitted. "In many respects it has changed the
  English character. We look now a little further afield. We have lost some of
  our stubborn over-confidence. We have grown in many respects more spiritual.
  We have learnt what it means to make sacrifices, sacrifices not for gold but
  for a righteous cause. And as far as regards this country of yours, Sir
  Denis," he continued, "I was only remarking a few days ago that the greatest
  opponents of Home Rule who have ever mounted a political platform in England
  have completely changed their views. There is only one idea to-day, and that
  is to let Ireland settle her own affairs. Such trouble as remains lies in
  your own country. Convert Ulster and you are free."</p>

  <p>"You heard what was said last night?" Sir Denis reminded his companion.
  "The O'Clory believes that that is already done."</p>

  <p>The faintest of white mists was being burnt away now by the strengthening
  sun. Long, green waves came rolling in from the Atlantic. Distant rocks
  gleamed purple in the gathering sunshine. The green of the fields grew
  deeper, the colouring on the moors warmer. Crawshay lit a cigarette and
  leaned back against a rock.</p>

  <p>"Over in America," he observed, "I heard all sorts of stories about you.
  The man Hobson, with whom I was sent to Halifax, and who dragged me off to
  Chicago, seemed to think that if he could once get his hand on your shoulder
  there were other charges which you might have to answer. Brightman, that
  Liverpool man, had the same idea. I am mentioning this for your own sake, Sir
  Denis."</p>

  <p>The latter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows how I've kept clear," he declared, "but there isn't a thing
  against me. I sailed close to the wind in Mexico. I'd have fought for them
  against America if they'd really meant business, but they didn't. I was too
  late for the Boer War or I'd have been in that for a certainty. I went
  through South America, but the little fighting I did there doesn't amount to
  anything. After I came back to the States I ran some close shaves, I admit,
  but I kept clear of the law. Then I got in with some Germans at Washington.
  They knew who I was, and they knew very well how I felt about England. I did
  a few things for them&mdash;nothing risky. They were keeping me for something
  big. That came along, as you know. They offered me the job of bringing these
  things to England, and I took it on."</p>

  <p>"For an amateur," Crawshay confessed, "you certainly did wonderfully. I am
  not a professional detective myself, but you fairly beat us on the sea, and
  you practically beat us on land as well."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing succeeds like simplicity," Denis declared. "I gambled
  upon it that no one would think of searching the curtains of the music hall
  box in which Gant and I spent apparently a jovial evening. No one
  did&mdash;until it was too late. Then I felt perfectly certain that both you
  and Brightman would believe I was trying to get hold of Richard Beverley. The
  poor fellow thought so himself for some time."</p>

  <p>"There is just one question," Crawshay said, after a moment's pause,
  "which I'd like to ask. It's about Nora Sharey."</p>

  <p>Sir Denis glanced at his companion with a faint smile. He suddenly
  realised the purport of his lingering.</p>

  <p>"Well, what about her?"</p>

  <p>"She seems to have followed you very quickly from New York."</p>

  <p>"Must you put it like that? Her father and brother were connected with the
  German Secret Service in New York, and on the declaration of war they had to
  hide. She could scarcely stay there alone."</p>

  <p>"She might have gone with her father to Chicago," Crawshay observed.</p>

  <p>"You must remember that she, too, is Irish," Sir Denis pointed out. "I am
  not at all sure that she wasn't a little homesick. By-the-by, are you
  interested in her?"</p>

  <p>"Since you ask me," Crawshay replied, "I am."</p>

  <p>Sir Denis threw away his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said quietly, "if I tell you that I am delighted to hear
  it, for your own sake as well as hers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all I have been hanging about to hear," Crawshay interrupted,
  turning towards the castle. "I suppose we shall meet again in London?"</p>

  <p>"I think not. They talk about sending me to the Dublin Convention here.
  Until they want me, I don't think I shall move."</p>

  <p>Crawshay looked around him. The prospect in its way was beautiful, but
  save for a few bending figures in the distant fields, there was no sign of
  any human being.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to stand this for long," he remarked. "You've lived too
  turbulent a life to vegetate here."</p>

  <p>Sir Denis laughed softly but with a new ring of real happiness.</p>

  <p>"It's clear that you are not an Irishman!" he declared. "I've been away
  for over ten years. I can just breathe this air, wander about on the beach
  here, walk on that moorland, watch the sea, poke about amongst my old ruins,
  send for the priest and talk to him, get my tenants together and hear what
  they have to say&mdash;I can do these things, Crawshay, and breathe the
  atmosphere of it all down into my lungs and be content. It's just
  Ireland&mdash;that's all.&mdash;You hurry back to your own bloated,
  over-rich, smoke-disfigured, town-ruined country, and spend your money on
  restaurants and theatres if you want to. You're welcome."</p>

  <p>Sir Denis' words sounded convincing enough, but his companion only smiled
  as he brought his car out of a dilapidated coach-house, from amidst the ruins
  of a score of carriages.</p>

  <p>"All the same," he observed, as he leaned over and shook hands with his
  host, "I should never be surprised to come across you in that
  smoke-disfigured den of infamy! Look me up when you come, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Sir Denis promised. "And&mdash;my regards to Nora!"</p>

  <p>Richard Beverley, after his first embrace, held his sister's hands for a
  moment and looked into her face.</p>

  <p>"Why, Katharine," he exclaimed, "London's not agreeing with you! You look
  pale."</p>

  <p>She laughed carelessly.</p>

  <p>"It was the heat last month," she told him. "I shall be all right now. How
  well you're looking!"</p>

  <p>"I'm fine," he admitted. "It's a great life, Katharine. I'm kind of
  worried about you, though."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing whatever the matter with me," she assured him, "except
  that I want some work. In a few days' time now I shall have it. I have eighty
  nurses on the way from the hospital, with doctors and dressers and a complete
  St. Agnes's outfit. They sailed yesterday, and I shall go across to Havre to
  meet them."</p>

  <p>"Good for you!" Richard exclaimed. "Say, Katharine, what about lunch?"</p>

  <p>"You must be starving," she declared. "We'll go down and have it. I feel
  better already, Dick. I think I must have been lonely."</p>

  <p>They went arm in arm down-stairs and lunched cheerfully. Towards the end
  of the meal, he asked the question which had been on his lips more than
  once.</p>

  <p>"Heard anything of Jocelyn Thew?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>Richard sighed thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What a waste!" he exclaimed. "A man like that ought to be doing great
  things. Katharine, you ought to have seen their faces when they searched me
  and found I was only carrying out a packet of old love letters, and it dawned
  upon them that he'd got away with the goods! I wonder if they ever caught
  him."</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't we have heard of it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. If he'd been caught under certain circumstances, he
  might have been shot on sight and we should never have heard a word. Not that
  that's likely, of course," he went on, suddenly realising her pallor. "What a
  clumsy ass I am, Katharine! We should have heard of it one way or
  another.&mdash;Do you see who's sitting over there in a corner?"</p>

  <p>Katharine looked across the room and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The face of the man in khaki seems familiar," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"That's Crawshay, the fellow whom Jocelyn Thew fooled. He was married last
  week to the girl with him. Nora Sharey, her name was. She came from New
  York."</p>

  <p>"They seem very happy," Katharine observed, watching them as they left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Crawshay's a good fellow enough," her brother remarked, "and the girl's
  all right, although at one time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short, but his sister's eyes were fixed upon him
  enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"At one time," he continued, "I used to think that she was mad about
  Jocelyn Thew. Not that that made any difference so far as he was concerned.
  He never seemed to find time or place in his life for women."</p>

  <p>They finished their luncheon and made their way up-stairs once more to
  Katharine's sitting room. Richard stretched himself in any easy-chair and lit
  a cigar with an air of huge content.</p>

  <p>"I am to be transferred when our first division comes across," he told
  her. "Our Squadron Commander's going to make that all right with the W.O.
  We've had some grand flights lately, I can tell you, Katharine."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door, a few moments later. The waiter entered,
  bearing a card upon a tray, which he handed to Katharine. She read it with a
  perplexed frown.</p>

  <p>"Sir Denis Cathley.&mdash;But I don't know of any one of that name," she
  declared, glancing up. "Are you sure that he wants to see me?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better explain," a quiet voice interposed from outside.
  "May I come in?"</p>

  <p>Katharine gave a little cry and Richard sprang to his feet. Sir Denis
  pushed past the waiter. For a moment Katharine had swayed upon her feet. "I
  am so sorry," he said earnestly. "Please forgive me, Miss Beverley, and do
  sit down. It was an absurd thing to force my way upon you like this. Only,
  you see," he went on, as he helped her to a chair, "the circumstances which
  required my use of a partially assumed name have changed. I ought to have
  written you and explained. Naturally you thought I was dead, or at the other
  end of the world."</p>

  <p>Katharine smiled a little weakly. She was back again in her chair, but Sir
  Denis seemed to have forgotten to release her hand, which she made no effort
  to withdraw.</p>

  <p>"It was perfectly ridiculous of me," she murmured, "but I was just telling
  Dick&mdash;he is back again for another four days' leave and we were talking
  about you at luncheon time&mdash;that I wasn't feeling very well, and your
  coming in like that was quite a shock. I am absolutely all right now. Do
  please sit down and explain," she begged, motioning him to a chair.</p>

  <p>The waiter had disappeared. Sir Denis shook hands with Richard, who
  wheeled an easy-chair forward for him. He sat down between them and commenced
  his explanation.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on, "as a criminal I am really rather a fraud. When I
  tell you that I am an Irishman&mdash;perhaps you may have guessed it from my
  name&mdash;and a rabid one, a Sinn Feiner, and that for ten years I have
  lived with a sentence probably of death hanging over me, you will perhaps
  understand my hatred of England and my somewhat morbid demeanour
  generally."</p>

  <p>Katharine was speechless. Richard Beverley indulged in a long whistle.</p>

  <p>"So that's the explanation!" he exclaimed. "That was why you got mixed up
  with that German crew, eh?"</p>

  <p>"That," Sir Denis admitted, "was the reason for my attempted
  enterprise."</p>

  <p>"Attempted?" Richard protested. "But you brought it off, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"The end of the affair was really curious," Sir Denis explained. "I
  suppose, in a way, I did bring it off. I caught the mail train from Euston
  that night, got away with the papers and took them where I always meant
  to&mdash;to my old home on the west coast of Ireland. There, whilst I was
  waiting to keep an appointment with a German U-boat, I found out what happens
  to a man who has sworn an oath that he will never again look inside an
  English newspaper, and been obstinate enough to keep his word."</p>

  <p>"Say, this is interesting!" Richard declared enthusiastically. "Why, of
  course, there have been great changes, haven't there? You Irish are going to
  have all that you want, after all."</p>

  <p>"It looks like it," Sir Denis assented. "I found that my home was the
  rendezvous of a lot of my old associates, only instead of meeting underneath
  trapdoors at the risk of their lives, they were meeting quite openly and
  without fear of molestation. From them I heard that the Government had
  granted me, together with some others, a free pardon many months ago. I
  heard, too, of the coming Convention and of the altered spirit in English
  politics. I heard of these things just in time, for the U-boat was waiting
  outside in the bay."</p>

  <p>"You didn't part with the stuff?" Richard exclaimed eagerly.</p>

  <p>Sir Denis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I burnt the papers upon my hearth," he told them. "Crawshay ran me to
  ground there, but his coming wasn't necessary. A great deal besides the ashes
  of those documents went up in smoke that night."</p>

  <p>Richard Beverley had risen to his feet and was pacing up and down the
  room. He found some vent for his feelings by wringing his friend's hand.</p>

  <p>"If this doesn't beat the band!" he exclaimed. "My head isn't strong
  enough to take it all in. So Crawshay found you out?"</p>

  <p>"He arrived," Sir Denis replied, "to find the papers burning upon the
  hearth. As a matter of fact, he took the ashes with him."</p>

  <p>"He didn't arrest you, then, after all? There was no charge made?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. He was perfectly satisfied. He stayed until the next
  morning and we parted friends. A few days ago I had his wedding cards. You
  know whom he married?"</p>

  <p>"Saw them together down-stairs," Richard declared. "I'm off in a moment to
  see if I can get hold of Crawshay and shake his hand.&mdash;So you're Sir
  Denis Cathley, eh, and you've chucked that other game altogether?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," the other replied&mdash;"Sir Denis Jocelyn Cathley. As a
  matter of fact, I am up in town to arrange for some one else to take my place
  at the Convention. I am not much use as a maker of laws. They've promised me
  a commission in the Irish Guards. That will be settled in a few days. Then I
  shall go back home to see what I can do amongst my tenantry, and
  afterwards&mdash;well," he concluded, with a little gleam in his dark eyes,
  "they promise me I shall go out with the first drafts of the new
  battalion."</p>

  <p>Richard gripped his friend's hand once again and turned towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"It's great!" he declared. "I must try and catch Crawshay before he
  goes."</p>

  <p>He hurried out. The door was closed. Sir Denis turned at once towards
  Katharine. He rose to his feet and leaned over her chair. His voice was not
  quite so steady.</p>

  <p>"So much that I had thought lost for ever," he said, "has come back to me.
  So much that I had never thought to realise in this world seems to be coming
  true. Is it too late for me to ask for the one greatest thing of all of the
  only person who could count&mdash;who ever has counted? You know so well,
  Katharine, that even as a soured and disappointed man I loved you, and now it
  is just you, and you only, who could give me&mdash;what I want in life."</p>

  <p>She laid her fingers upon his shoulders. Her eyes shone as he drew her
  into his arms.</p>

  <p>"I ought to keep you waiting such a long time," she murmured, "because I
  had to ask you first&mdash;for your friendship, and you weren't very kind to
  die. But I can't."</p>
