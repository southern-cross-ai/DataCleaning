  <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p>Francis Ledsam, alert, well-satisfied with himself and the world, the echo
  of a little buzz of congratulations still in his ears, paused on the steps of
  the modern Temple of Justice to light a cigarette before calling for a taxi
  to take him to his club. Visions of a whisky and soda&mdash;his throat was a
  little parched&mdash;and a rubber of easy-going bridge at his favourite
  table, were already before his eyes. A woman who had followed him from the
  Court touched him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Can I speak to you for a moment, Mr. Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>The barrister frowned slightly as he swung around to confront his
  questioner. It was such a familiar form of address.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked, a little curtly.</p>

  <p>"A few minutes' conversation with you," was the calm reply. "The matter is
  important."</p>

  <p>The woman's tone and manner, notwithstanding her plain, inconspicuous
  clothes, commanded attention. Francis Ledsam was a little puzzled. Small
  things meant much to him in life, and he had been looking forward almost with
  the zest of a schoolboy to that hour of relaxation at his club. He was
  impatient of even a brief delay, a sentiment which he tried to express in his
  response.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to speak to me about?" he repeated bluntly. "I shall be
  in my rooms in the Temple to-morrow morning, any time after eleven."</p>

  <p>"It is necessary for me to speak to you now," she insisted. "There is a
  tea-shop across the way. Please accompany me there."</p>

  <p>Ledsam, a little surprised at the coolness of her request, subjected his
  accoster to a closer scrutiny. As he did so, his irritation diminished. He
  shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"If you really have business with me," he said, "I will give you a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>They crossed the street together, the woman self-possessed, negative,
  wholly without the embarrassment of one performing an unusual action. Her
  companion felt the awakening of curiosity. Zealously though she had, to all
  appearance, endeavoured to conceal the fact, she was without a doubt
  personable. Her voice and manner lacked nothing of refinement. Yet her
  attraction to Francis Ledsam, who, although a perfectly normal human being,
  was no seeker after promiscuous adventures, did not lie in these externals.
  As a barrister whose success at the criminal bar had been phenomenal, he had
  attained to a certain knowledge of human nature. He was able, at any rate, to
  realise that this woman was no imposter. He knew that she had vital things to
  say.</p>

  <p>They passed into the tea-shop and found an empty corner. Ledsam hung up
  his hat and gave an order. The woman slowly began to remove her gloves. When
  she pushed back her veil, her vis-a-vis received almost a shock. She was
  quite as good-looking as he had imagined, but she was far younger&mdash;she
  was indeed little more than a girl. Her eyes were of a deep shade of hazel
  brown, her eyebrows were delicately marked, her features and poise admirable.
  Yet her skin was entirely colourless. She was as pale as one whose eyes have
  been closed in death. Her lips, although in no way highly coloured, were like
  streaks of scarlet blossom upon a marble image. The contrast between her
  appearance and that of her companion was curiously marked. Francis Ledsam
  conformed in no way to the accepted physical type of his profession. He was
  over six feet in height, broad-shouldered and powerfully made. His features
  were cast in a large mould, he was of fair, almost sandy complexion, even his
  mouth was more humourous than incisive. His eyes alone, grey and exceedingly
  magnetic, suggested the gifts which without a doubt lay behind his massive
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"I am anxious to avoid any possible mistake," she began. "Your name is
  Francis Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>"It is," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"You are the very successful criminal barrister," she continued, "who has
  just been paid an extravagant fee to defend Oliver Hilditch."</p>

  <p>"I might take exception to the term 'extravagant'," Ledsam observed drily.
  "Otherwise, your information appears to be singularly correct. I do not know
  whether you have heard the verdict. If not, you may be interested to know
  that I succeeded in obtaining the man's acquittal."</p>

  <p>"I know that you did," the woman replied. "I was in the Court when the
  verdict was brought in. It has since occurred to me that I should like you to
  understand exactly what you have done, the responsibility you have
  incurred."</p>

  <p>Ledsam raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Responsibility?" he repeated. "What I have done is simple enough. I have
  earned a very large fee and won my case."</p>

  <p>"You have secured the acquittal of Oliver Hilditch," she persisted. "He is
  by this time a free man. Now I am going to speak to you of that
  responsibility. I am going to tell you a little about the man who owes his
  freedom to your eloquence."</p>

  <p>It was exactly twenty minutes after their entrance into the teashop when
  the woman finished her monologue. She began to draw on her gloves again.
  Before them were two untasted cups of tea and an untouched plate of bread and
  butter. From a corner of the room the waitress was watching them
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Francis Ledsam exclaimed at last, suddenly realising his
  whereabouts. "Do you mean to affirm solemnly that what you have been telling
  me is the truth?"</p>

  <p>The woman continued to button her gloves. "It is the truth," she said.</p>

  <p>Ledsam sat up and looked around him. He was a little dazed. He had almost
  the feeling of a man recovering from the influence of some anaesthetic.
  Before his eyes were still passing visions of terrible deeds, of naked, ugly
  passion, of man's unscrupulous savagery. During those few minutes he had been
  transported to New York and Paris, London and Rome. Crimes had been spoken of
  which made the murder for which Oliver Hilditch had just been tried seem like
  a trifling indiscretion. Hard though his mentality, sternly matter-of-fact as
  was his outlook, he was still unable to fully believe in himself, his
  surroundings, or in this woman who had just dropped a veil over her ashen
  cheeks. Reason persisted in asserting itself.</p>

  <p>"But if you knew all this," he demanded, "why on earth didn't you come
  forward and give evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she answered calmly, as she rose to her feet, "my evidence
  would not have been admissible. I am Oliver Hilditch's wife."</p><a name=

  <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p>Francis Ledsam arrived at his club, the Sheridan, an hour later than he
  had anticipated. He nodded to the veteran hall-porter, hung up his hat and
  stick, and climbed the great staircase to the card-room without any distinct
  recollection of performing any of these simple and reasonable actions. In the
  cardroom he exchanged a few greetings with friends, accepted without comment
  or without the slightest tinge of gratification a little chorus of chafing
  congratulations upon his latest triumph, and left the room without any
  inclination to play, although there was a vacant place at his favourite
  table. From sheer purposelessness he wandered back again into the hall, and
  here came his first gleam of returning sensation. He came face to face with
  his most intimate friend, Andrew Wilmore. The latter, who had just hung up
  his coat and hat, greeted him with a growl of welcome.</p>

  <p>"So you've brought it off again, Francis!"</p>

  <p>"Touch and go," the barrister remarked. "I managed to squeak home."</p>

  <p>Wilmore laid his hand upon his friend's shoulder and led the way towards
  two easy-chairs in the lounge.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what it is, old chap," he confided, "you'll be making yourself
  unpopular before long. Another criminal at large, thanks to that glib tongue
  and subtle brain of yours. The crooks of London will present you with a
  testimonial when you're made a judge."</p>

  <p>"So you think that Oliver Hilditch was guilty, then?" Francis asked
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, how do I know or care?" was the indifferent reply. "I
  shouldn't have thought that there had been any doubt about it. You probably
  know, anyway."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I didn't when I got up to make my speech," Francis
  assured his friend emphatically. "The fellow was given an opportunity of
  making a clean breast of it, of course&mdash;Wensley, his lawyer, advised him
  to, in fact&mdash;but the story he told me was precisely the story he told at
  the inquest."</p>

  <p>They were established now in their easy-chairs, and Wilmore summoned a
  waiter.</p>

  <p>"Two large whiskies and sodas," he ordered. "Francis," he went on,
  studying his companion intently, "what's the matter with you? You don't look
  as though your few days in the country last week had done you any good."</p>

  <p>Francis glanced around as though to be sure that they were alone.</p>

  <p>"I was all right when I came up, Andrew," he muttered. "This case has
  upset me."</p>

  <p>"Upset you? But why the dickens should it?" the other demanded, in a
  puzzled tone. "It was quite an ordinary case, in its way, and you won
  it."</p>

  <p>"I won it," Francis admitted.</p>

  <p>"Your defence was the most ingenious thing I ever heard."</p>

  <p>"Mostly suggested, now I come to think of it," the barrister remarked
  grimly, "by the prisoner himself."</p>

  <p>"But why are you upset about it, anyway?" Wilmore persisted.</p>

  <p>Francis rose to his feet, shook himself, and with his elbow resting upon
  the mantelpiece leaned down towards his friend. He could not rid himself
  altogether of this sense of unreality. He had the feeling that he had passed
  through one of the great crises of his life.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, Andrew. You're about the only man in the world I could
  tell. I've gone crazy."</p>

  <p>"I thought you looked as though you'd been seeing spooks," Wilmore
  murmured sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I have seen a spook," Francis rejoined, with almost passionate
  seriousness, "a spook who lifted an invisible curtain with invisible fingers,
  and pointed to such a drama of horrors as De Quincey, Poe and Sue combined
  could never have imagined. Oliver Hilditch was guilty, Andrew. He murdered
  the man Jordan&mdash;murdered him in cold blood."</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised to hear that," was the somewhat puzzled reply.</p>

  <p>"He was guilty, Andrew, not only of the murder of this man, his partner,
  but of innumerable other crimes and brutalities," Francis went on. "He is a
  fiend in human form, if ever there was one, and I have set him loose once
  more to prey upon Society. I am morally responsible for his next robbery, his
  next murder, the continued purgatory of those forced to associate with
  him."</p>

  <p>"You're dotty, Francis," his friend declared shortly.</p>

  <p>"I told you I was crazy," was the desperate reply. "So would you be if
  you'd sat opposite that woman for half-an-hour, and heard her story."</p>

  <p>"What woman?" Wilmore demanded, leaning forward in his chair and gazing at
  his friend with increasing uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"A woman who met me outside the Court and told me the story of Oliver
  Hilditch's life."</p>

  <p>"A stranger?"</p>

  <p>"A complete stranger to me. It transpired that she was his wife."</p>

  <p>Wilmore lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Believe her?"</p>

  <p>"There are times when one doesn't believe or disbelieve," Francis
  answered. "One knows."</p>

  <p>Wilmore nodded.</p>

  <p>"All the same, you're crazy," he declared. "Even if you did save the
  fellow from the gallows, you were only doing your job, doing your duty to the
  best of poor ability. You had no reason to believe him guilty."</p>

  <p>"That's just as it happened," Francis pointed out. "I really didn't care
  at the time whether he was or not. I had to proceed on the assumption that he
  was not, of course, but on the other hand I should have fought just as hard
  for him if I had known him to be guilty."</p>

  <p>"And you wouldn't now&mdash;to-morrow, say?"</p>

  <p>"Never again."</p>

  <p>"Because of that woman's story?"</p>

  <p>"Because of the woman."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Then Wilmore asked a very obvious question.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a person was she?"</p>

  <p>Francis Ledsam was several moments before he replied. The question was one
  which he had been expecting, one which he had already asked himself many
  times, yet he was unprepared with any definite reply.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could answer you, Andrew," his friend confessed. "As a matter of
  fact, I can't. I can only speak of the impression she left upon me, and you
  are about the only person breathing to whom I could speak of that."</p>

  <p>Wilmore nodded sympathetically. He knew that, man of the world though
  Francis Ledsam appeared, he was nevertheless a highly imaginative person,
  something of an idealist as regards women, unwilling as a rule to discuss
  them, keeping them, in a general way, outside his daily life.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, old fellow," he invited. "You know I understand."</p>

  <p>"She left the impression upon me," Francis continued quietly, "of a woman
  who had ceased to live. She was young, she was beautiful, she had all the
  gifts&mdash;culture, poise and breeding&mdash;but she had ceased to live. We
  sat with a marble table between us, and a few feet of oil-covered floor.
  Those few feet, Andrew, were like an impassable gulf. She spoke from the
  shores of another world. I listened and answered, spoke and listened again.
  And when she told her story, she went. I can't shake off the effect she had
  upon me, Andrew. I feel as though I had taken a step to the right or to the
  left over the edge of the world."</p>

  <p>Andrew Wilmore studied his friend thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He was full of sympathy and understanding. His one desire at that moment
  was not to make a mistake. He decided to leave unasked the obvious
  question.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said simply. "Are you dining anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of staying on here," was the indifferent reply.</p>

  <p>"We won't do anything of the sort," Wilmore insisted. "There's scarcely a
  soul in to-night, and the place is too humpy for a man who's been seeing
  spooks. Get back to your rooms and change. I'll wait here."</p>

  <p>"What about you?"</p>

  <p>"I have some clothes in my locker. Don't be long. And, by-the-bye, which
  shall it be&mdash;Bohemia or Mayfair? I'll telephone for a table. London's so
  infernally full, these days."</p>

  <p>Francis hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I really don't care," he confessed. "Now I think of it, I shall be glad
  to get away from here, though. I don't want any more congratulations on
  saving Oliver Hilditch's life. Let's go where we are least likely to meet any
  one we know."</p>

  <p>"Respectability and a starched shirt-front, then," Wilmore decided. "We'll
  go to Claridge's."</p><a name="ch03"

  <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p>The two men occupied a table set against the wall, not far from the
  entrance to the restaurant, and throughout the progress of the earlier part
  of their meal were able to watch the constant incoming stream of their
  fellow-guests. They were, in their way, an interesting contrast physically,
  neither of them good-looking according to ordinary standards, but both with
  many pleasant characteristics. Andrew Wilmore, slight and dark, with sallow
  cheeks and brown eyes, looked very much what he was&mdash;a moderately
  successful journalist and writer of stories, a keen golfer, a bachelor who
  preferred a pipe to cigars, and lived at Richmond because he could not find a
  flat in London which he could afford, large enough for his somewhat expansive
  habits. Francis Ledsam was of a sturdier type, with features perhaps better
  known to the world owing to the constant activities of the cartoonist. His
  reputation during the last few years had carried him, notwithstanding his
  comparative youth&mdash;he was only thirty-five years of age&mdash;into the
  very front ranks of his profession, and his income was one of which men spoke
  with bated breath. He came of a family of landed proprietors, whose younger
  sons for generations had drifted always either to the Bar or the Law, and his
  name was well known in the purlieus of Lincoln's Inn before he himself had
  made it famous. He was a persistent refuser of invitations, and his
  acquaintances in the fashionable world were comparatively few. Yet every now
  and then he felt a mild interest in the people whom his companion assiduously
  pointed out to him.</p>

  <p>"A fashionable restaurant, Francis, is rather like your Law
  Courts&mdash;it levels people up," the latter remarked. "Louis, the
  head-waiter, is the judge, and the position allotted in the room is the
  sentence. I wonder who is going to have the little table next but one to us.
  Some favoured person, evidently."</p>

  <p>Francis glanced in the direction indicated without curiosity. The table in
  question was laid for two and was distinguished by a wonderful cluster of red
  roses.</p>

  <p>"Why is it," the novelist continued speculatively, "that, whenever we take
  another man's wife out, we think it necessary to order red roses?"</p>

  <p>"And why is it," Francis queried, a little grimly, "that a dear fellow
  like you, Andrew, believes it his duty to talk of trifles for his pal's sake,
  when all the time he is thinking of something else? I know you're dying to
  talk about the Hilditch case, aren't you? Well, go ahead."</p>

  <p>"I'm only interested in this last development," Wilmore confessed. "Of
  course, I read the newspaper reports. To tell you the truth, for a murder
  trial it seemed to me to rather lack colour."</p>

  <p>"It was a very simple and straightforward case," Francis said slowly.
  "Oliver Hilditch is the principal partner in an American financial company
  which has recently opened offices in the West End. He seems to have arrived
  in England about two years ago, to have taken a house in Hill Street, and to
  have spent a great deal of money. A month or so ago, his partner from New
  York arrived in London, a man named Jordan of whom nothing was known. It has
  since transpired, however, that his journey to Europe was undertaken because
  he was unable to obtain certain figures relating to the business, from
  Hilditch. Oliver Hilditch met him at Southampton, travelled with him to
  London and found him a room at the Savoy. The next day, the whole of the time
  seems to have been spent in the office, and it is certain, from the evidence
  of the clerk, that some disagreement took place between the two men. They
  dined together, however, apparently on good terms, at the Cafe Royal, and
  parted in Regent Street soon after ten. At twelve o'clock, Jordan's body was
  picked up on the pavement in Hill Street, within a few paces of Heidrich's
  door. He had been stabbed through the heart with some needle-like weapon, and
  was quite dead."</p>

  <p>"Was there any vital cause of quarrel between them?" Wilmore enquired.</p>

  <p>"Impossible to say," Francis replied. "The financial position of the
  company depends entirely upon the value of a large quantity of speculative
  bonds, but as there was only one clerk employed, it was impossible to get at
  any figures. Hilditch declared that Jordan had only a small share in the
  business, from which he had drawn a considerable income for years, and that
  he had not the slightest cause for complaint."</p>

  <p>"What were Hilditch's movements that evening?" Wilmore asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul seems to have seen him after he left Regent Street," was the
  somewhat puzzled answer. "His own story was quite straightforward and has
  never been contradicted. He let himself into his house with a latch-key after
  his return from the Cafe Royal, drank a whisky and soda in the library, and
  went to bed before half-past eleven. The whole affair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Francis broke off abruptly in the middle of his sentence. He sat with his
  eyes fixed upon the door, silent and speechless.</p>

  <p>"What in Heaven's name is the matter, old fellow?" Wilmore demanded,
  gazing at his companion in blank amazement.</p>

  <p>The latter pulled himself together with an effort. The sight of the two
  new arrivals talking to Louis on the threshold of the restaurant, seemed for
  the moment to have drawn every scrap of colour from his cheeks. Nevertheless,
  his recovery was almost instantaneous.</p>

  <p>"If you want to know any more," he said calmly, "you had better go and ask
  him to tell you the whole story himself. There he is."</p>

  <p>"And the woman with him?" Wilmore exclaimed under his breath.</p>

  <p>"His wife!"</p><a name="ch04"

  <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p>To reach their table, the one concerning which Francis and his friend had
  been speculating, the new arrivals, piloted by Louis, had to pass within a
  few feet of the two men. The woman, serene, coldly beautiful, dressed like a
  Frenchwoman in unrelieved black, with extraordinary attention to details,
  passed them by with a careless glance and subsided into the chair which Louis
  was holding. Her companion, however, as he recognised Francis hesitated. His
  expression of somewhat austere gloom was lightened. A pleasant but tentative
  smile parted his lips. He ventured upon a salutation, half a nod, half a more
  formal bow, a salutation which Francis instinctively returned. Andrew Wilmore
  looked on with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"So that is Oliver Hilditch," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"That is the man," Francis observed, "of whom last evening half the people
  in this restaurant were probably asking themselves whether or not he was
  guilty of murder. To-night they will be wondering what he is going to order
  for dinner. It is a strange world."</p>

  <p>"Strange indeed," Wilmore assented. "This afternoon he was in the dock,
  with his fate in the balance&mdash;the condemned cell or a favoured table at
  Claridge's. And your meeting! One can imagine him gripping your hands, with
  tears in his eyes, his voice broken with emotion, sobbing out his thanks. And
  instead you exchange polite bows. I would not have missed this situation for
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Tradesman!" Francis scoffed. "One can guess already at the plot of your
  next novel."</p>

  <p>"He has courage," Wilmore declared. "He has also a very beautiful
  companion. Were you serious, Francis, when you told me that that was his
  wife?"</p>

  <p>"She herself was my informant," was the quiet reply.</p>

  <p>Wilmore was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"But she passed you just now without even a glance of recognition, and I
  thought you told me at the club this afternoon that all your knowledge of his
  evil ways came from her. Besides, she looks at least twenty years younger
  than he does."</p>

  <p>Francis, who had been watching his glass filled with champagne, raised it
  to his lips and drank its contents steadily to the last drop.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you what I know, Andrew," he said, as he set down the
  empty glass. "The woman who is with him now is the woman who spoke to me
  outside the Old Bailey this afternoon. We went to a tea-shop together. She
  told me the story of his career. I have never listened to so horrible a
  recital in my life."</p>

  <p>"And yet they are here together, dining tete-a-tete, on a night when it
  must have needed more than ordinary courage for either of them to have been
  seen in public at all," Wilmore pointed out.</p>

  <p>"It is as astounding to me as it is to you," Francis confessed. "From the
  way she spoke, I should never have dreamed that they were living
  together."</p>

  <p>"And from his appearance," Wilmore remarked, as he called the waiter to
  bring some cigarettes, "I should never have imagined that he was anything
  else save a high-principled, well-born, straightforward sort of chap. I never
  saw a less criminal type of face."</p>

  <p>They each in turn glanced at the subject of their discussion. Oliver
  Hilditch's good-looks had been the subject of many press comments during the
  last few days. They were certainly undeniable. His face was a little lined
  but his hair was thick and brown. His features were regular, his forehead
  high and thoughtful, his mouth a trifle thin but straight and shapely.
  Francis gazed at him like a man entranced. The hours seemed to have slipped
  away. He was back in the tea-shop, listening to the woman who spoke of
  terrible things. He felt again his shivering abhorrence of her cold, clearly
  narrated story. Again he shrank from the horrors from which with merciless
  fingers she had stripped the coverings. He seemed to see once more the agony
  in her white face, to hear the eternal pain aching and throbbing in her
  monotonous tone. He rose suddenly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Andrew," he begged, "tell the fellow to bring the bill outside. We'll
  have our coffee and liqueurs there."</p>

  <p>Wilmore acquiesced willingly enough, but even as they turned towards the
  door Francis realised what was in store for him. Oliver Hilditch had risen to
  his feet. With a courteous little gesture he intercepted the passer-by.
  Francis found himself standing side by side with the man for whose life he
  had pleaded that afternoon, within a few feet of the woman whose terrible
  story seemed to have poisoned the very atmosphere he breathed, to have shown
  him a new horror in life, to have temporarily, at any rate, undermined every
  joy and ambition he possessed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," Hilditch said, speaking with quiet dignity, "I hope that you
  will forgive the liberty I take in speaking to you here. I looked for you the
  moment I was free this afternoon, but found that you had left the Court. I
  owe you my good name, probably my life. Thanks are poor things but they must
  be spoken."</p>

  <p>"You owe me nothing at all," Francis replied, in a tone which even he
  found harsh. "I had a brief before me and a cause to plead. It was a chapter
  out of my daily work."</p>

  <p>"That work can be well done or ill," the other reminded him gently. "In
  your case, my presence here proves how well it was done. I wish to present
  you to my wife, who shares my gratitude."</p>

  <p>Francis bowed to the woman, who now, at her husband's words, raised her
  eyes. For the first time he saw her smile. It seemed to him that the effort
  made her less beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Your pleading was very wonderful, Mr. Ledsam," she said, a very subtle
  note of mockery faintly apparent in her tone. "We poor mortals find it
  difficult to understand that with you all that show of passionate earnestness
  is merely&mdash;what did you call it?&mdash;a chapter in your day's work? It
  is a great gift to be able to argue from the brain and plead as though from
  the heart."</p>

  <p>"We will not detain Mr. Ledsam," Oliver Hilditch interposed, a little
  hastily. "He perhaps does not care to be addressed in public by a client who
  still carries with him the atmosphere of the prison. My wife and I wondered,
  Mr. Ledsam, whether you would be good enough to dine with us one night. I
  think I could interest you by telling you more about my case than you know at
  present, and it would give us a further opportunity, and a more seemly one,
  for expressing our gratitude."</p>

  <p>Francis had recovered himself by this time. He was after all a man of
  parts, and though he still had the feeling that he had been through one of
  the most momentous days of his life, his savoir faire was making its
  inevitable reappearance. He knew very well that the idea of that dinner would
  be horrible to him. He also knew that he would willingly cancel every
  engagement he had rather than miss it.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Are we fortunate enough to find you disengaged," Hilditch suggested,
  "to-morrow evening?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite free," was the ready response.</p>

  <p>"That suits you, Margaret?" Hilditch asked, turning courteously to his
  wife.</p>

  <p>For a single moment her eyes were fixed upon those of her prospective
  guest. He read their message which pleaded for his refusal, and he denied
  it.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow evening will suit me as well as any other," she acquiesced,
  after a brief pause.</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock, then&mdash;number 10 b, Hill Street," Hilditch
  concluded.</p>

  <p>Francis bowed and turned away with a murmured word of polite assent.
  Outside, he found Wilmore deep in the discussion of the merits of various old
  brandies with an interested maitre d'hotel.</p>

  <p>"Any choice, Francis?" his host enquired.</p>

  <p>"None whatever," was the prompt reply, "only, for God's sake, give me a
  double one quickly!"</p>

  <p>The two men were on the point of departure when Oliver Hilditch and his
  wife left the restaurant. As though conscious that they had become the
  subject of discussion, as indeed was the case, thanks to the busy whispering
  of the various waiters, they passed without lingering through the lounge into
  the entrance hall, where Francis and Andrew Wilmore were already waiting for
  a taxicab. Almost as they appeared, a new arrival was ushered through the
  main entrance, followed by porters carrying luggage. He brushed past Francis
  so closely that the latter looked into his face, half attracted and half
  repelled by the waxen-like complexion, the piercing eyes, and the dignified
  carriage of the man whose arrival seemed to be creating some stir in the
  hotel. A reception clerk and a deputy manager had already hastened forward.
  The newcomer waved them back for a moment. Bareheaded, he had taken Margaret
  Hilditch's hands in his and raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>"I came as quickly as I could," he said. "There was the usual delay, of
  course, at Marseilles, and the trains on were terrible. So all has ended
  well."</p>

  <p>Oliver Hilditch, standing by, remained speechless. It seemed for a moment
  as though his self-control were subjected to a severe strain.</p>

  <p>"I had the good fortune," he interposed, in a low tone, "to be wonderfully
  defended. Mr. Ledsam here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced around. Francis, with some idea of what was coming, obeyed an
  imaginary summons from the head-porter, touched Andrew Wilmore upon the
  shoulder, and hastened without a backward glance through the swing-doors.
  Wilmore turned up his coat-collar and looked doubtfully up at the rain.</p>

  <p>"I say, old chap," he protested, "you don't really mean to walk?"</p>

  <p>Francis thrust his hand through his friend's arm and wheeled him round
  into Davies Street.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what the mischief we do, Andrew," he confided, "but couldn't
  you see what was going to happen? Oliver Hilditch was going to introduce me
  as his preserver to the man who had just arrived!"</p>

  <p>"Are you afflicted with modesty, all of a sudden?" Wilmore grumbled.</p>

  <p>"No, remorse," was the terse reply.</p><a name="ch05"

  <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p>Indecision had never been one of Francis Ledsam's faults, but four times
  during the following day he wrote out a carefully worded telegraphic message
  to Mrs. Oliver Hilditch, 10 b, Hill Street, regretting his inability to dine
  that night, and each time he destroyed it. He carried the first message
  around Richmond golf course with him, intending to dispatch his caddy with it
  immediately on the conclusion of the round. The fresh air, however, and the
  concentration required by the game, seemed to dispel the nervous
  apprehensions with which he had anticipated his visit, and over an aperitif
  in the club bar he tore the telegram into small pieces and found himself even
  able to derive a certain half-fearful pleasure from the thought of meeting
  again the woman who, together with her terrible story, had never for one
  moment been out of his thoughts. Andrew Wilmore, who had observed his action,
  spoke of it as they settled down to lunch.</p>

  <p>"So you are going to keep your engagement tonight, Francis?" he
  observed.</p>

  <p>The latter nodded.</p>

  <p>"After all, why not?" he asked, a little defiantly. "It ought to be
  interesting."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's nothing of the sordid criminal, at any rate, about Oliver
  Hilditch," Wilmore declared. "Neither, if one comes to think of it, does his
  wife appear to be the prototype of suffering virtue. I wonder if you are wise
  to go, Francis?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the man who had asked himself that question a dozen times
  already, demanded.</p>

  <p>"Because," Wilmore replied coolly, "underneath that steely hardness of
  manner for which your profession is responsible, you have a vein of
  sentiment, of chivalrous sentiment, I should say, which some day or other is
  bound to get you into trouble. The woman is beautiful enough to turn any
  one's head. As a matter of fact, I believe that you are more than half in
  love with her already."</p>

  <p>Francis Ledsam sat where the sunlight fell upon his strong, forceful face,
  shone, too, upon the table with its simple but pleasant appointments, upon
  the tankard of beer by his side, upon the plate of roast beef to which he was
  already doing ample justice. He laughed with the easy confidence of a man
  awakened from some haunting nightmare, relieved to find his feet once more
  firm upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"I have been a fool to take the whole matter so seriously, Andrew," he
  declared. "I expect to walk back to Clarges Street to-night, disillusioned.
  The man will probably present me with a gold pencil-case, and the
  woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what about the woman?" Wilmore asked, after a brief pause.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know!" Francis declared, a little impatiently. "The woman is
  the mystery, of course. Probably my brain was a little over-excited when I
  came out of Court, and what I imagined to be an epic was nothing more than a
  tissue of exaggerations from a disappointed wife. I'm sure I'm doing the
  right thing to go there.... What about a four-ball this afternoon,
  Andrew?"</p>

  <p>The four-ball match was played and won in normal fashion. The two men
  returned to town together afterwards, Wilmore to the club and Francis to his
  rooms in Clarges Street to prepare for dinner. At a few minutes to eight he
  rang the bell of number 10 b, Hill Street, and found his host and hostess
  awaiting him in the small drawing-room into which he was ushered. It seemed
  to him that the woman, still colourless, again marvellously gowned, greeted
  him coldly. His host, however, was almost too effusive. There was no other
  guest, but the prompt announcement of dinner dispelled what might have been a
  few moments of embarrassment after Oliver Hilditch's almost too cordial
  greeting. The woman laid her fingers upon her guest's coat-sleeve. The trio
  crossed the little hall almost in silence.</p>

  <p>Dinner was served in a small white Georgian dining-room, with every
  appurtenance of almost Sybaritic luxury. The only light in the room was
  thrown upon the table by two purple-shaded electric lamps, and the servants
  who waited seemed to pass backwards and forwards like shadows in some
  mysterious twilight&mdash;even the faces of the three diners themselves were
  out of the little pool of light until they leaned forward. The dinner was
  chosen with taste and restraint, the wines were not only costly but rare. A
  watchful butler, attended now and then by a trim parlour-maid, superintended
  the service. Only once, when she ordered a bowl of flowers removed from the
  table, did their mistress address either of them. Conversation after the
  first few amenities speedily became almost a monologue. One man talked whilst
  the others listened, and the man who talked was Oliver Hilditch. He possessed
  the rare gift of imparting colour and actuality in a few phrases to the
  strange places of which he spoke, of bringing the very thrill of strange
  happenings into the shadowy room. It seemed that there was scarcely a country
  of the world which he had not visited, a country, that is to say, where men
  congregate, for he admitted from the first that he was a city worshipper,
  that the empty places possessed no charm for him.</p>

  <p>"I am not even a sportsman," he confessed once, half apologetically, in
  reply to a question from his guest. "I have passed down the great rivers of
  the world without a thought of salmon, and I have driven through the forest
  lands and across the mountains behind a giant locomotive, without a thought
  of the beasts which might be lurking there, waiting to be killed. My only
  desire has been to reach the next place where men and women were."</p>

  <p>"Irrespective of nationality?" Francis queried.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. I have never minded much of what race&mdash;I have the trick
  of tongues rather strangely developed&mdash;but I like the feeling of human
  beings around me. I like the smell and sound and atmosphere of a great city.
  Then all my senses are awake, but life becomes almost turgid in my veins
  during the dreary hours of passing from one place to another."</p>

  <p>"Do you rule out scenery as well as sport from amongst the joys of
  travel?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"I am ashamed to make such a confession," his host answered, "but I have
  never lingered for a single unnecessary moment to look at the most wonderful
  landscape in the world. On the other hand, I have lounged for hours in the
  narrowest streets of Pekin, in the markets of Shanghai, along Broadway in New
  York, on the boulevards in Paris, outside the Auditorium in Chicago. These
  are the obvious places where humanity presses the thickest, but I know of
  others. Some day we will talk of them."</p>

  <p>Francis, too, although that evening, through sheer lack of sympathy, he
  refused to admit it, shared to some extent Hilditch's passionate interest in
  his fellow-creatures, and notwithstanding the strange confusion of thought
  into which he had been thrown during the last twenty-four hours, he felt
  something of the pungency of life, the thrill of new and appealing
  surroundings, as he sat in his high-backed chair, sipping his wonderful wine,
  eating almost mechanically what was set before him, fascinated through all
  his being by his strange company.</p>

  <p>For three days he had cast occasional glances at this man, seated in the
  criminal dock with a gaoler on either side of him, his fine, nervous features
  gaining an added distinction from the sordidness of his surroundings. Now, in
  the garb of civilisation, seated amidst luxury to which he was obviously
  accustomed, with a becoming light upon his face and this strange, fascinating
  flow of words proceeding always from his lips, the man, from every external
  point of view, seemed amongst the chosen ones of the world. The contrast was
  in itself amazing. And then the woman! Francis looked at her but seldom, and
  when he did it was with a curious sense of mental disturbance; poignant but
  unanalysable.</p>

  <p>It was amazing to see her here, opposite the man of whom she had told him
  that ghastly story, mistress of his house, to all appearance his consort,
  apparently engrossed in his polished conversation, yet with that subtle
  withholding of her real self which Francis rather imagined than felt, and
  which somehow seemed to imply her fierce resentment of her husband's re-entry
  into the arena of life. It was a situation so strange that Francis, becoming
  more and more subject to its influence, was inclined to wonder whether he had
  not met with some accident on his way from the Court, and whether this was
  not one of the heated nightmares following unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he asked his host, during one of the brief pauses in the
  conversation, "have you ever tried to analyse this interest of yours in human
  beings and crowded cities, this hatred of solitude and empty spaces?"</p>

  <p>Oliver Hilditch smiled thoughtfully, and gazed at a salted almond which he
  was just balancing between the tips of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said simply, "it is because I have no soul."</p><a name=

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p>The three diners lingered for only a short time over their dessert.
  Afterwards, they passed together into a very delightful library on the other
  side of the round, stone-paved hall. Hilditch excused himself for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I have some cigars which I keep in my dressing-room," he explained, "and
  which I am anxious for you to try. There is an electric stove there and I can
  regulate the temperature."</p>

  <p>He departed, closing the door behind him. Francis came a little further
  into the room. His hostess, who had subsided into an easy-chair and was
  holding a screen between her face and the fire, motioned him to, seat himself
  opposite. He did so without words. He felt curiously and ridiculously
  tongue-tied. He fell to studying the woman instead of attempting the banality
  of pointless speech. From the smooth gloss of her burnished hair, to the
  daintiness of her low, black brocaded shoes, she represented, so far as her
  physical and outward self were concerned, absolute perfection. No ornament
  was amiss, no line or curve of her figure other than perfectly graceful. Yet
  even the fire's glow which she had seemed to dread brought no flush of colour
  to her cheeks. Her appearance of complete lifelessness remained. It was as
  though some sort of crust had formed about her being, a condition which her
  very physical perfection seemed to render the more incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>"You are surprised to see me here living with my husband, after what I
  told you yesterday afternoon?" she said calmly, breaking at last the silence
  which had reigned between them.</p>

  <p>"I am," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"It seems unnatural to you, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely."</p>

  <p>"You still believe all that I told you?"</p>

  <p>"I must."</p>

  <p>She looked at the door and raised her head a little, as though either
  listening or adjudging the time before her husband would return. Then she
  glanced across at him once more.</p>

  <p>"Hatred," she said, "does not always drive away. Sometimes it attracts.
  Sometimes the person who hates can scarcely bear the other out of his sight.
  That is where hate and love are somewhat alike."</p>

  <p>The room was warm but Francis was conscious of shivering. She raised her
  finger warningly. It seemed typical of the woman, somehow, that the message
  could not be conveyed by any glance or gesture.</p>

  <p>"He is coming," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Oliver Hilditch reappeared, carrying cigars wrapped in gold foil which he
  had brought with him from Cuba, the tobacco of which was a revelation to his
  guest. The two men smoked and sipped their coffee and brandy. The woman sat
  with half-closed eyes. It was obvious that Hilditch was still in the mood for
  speech.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, Mr. Ledsam," he said, "why I am so happy to have you
  here this evening. In the first place, I desire to tender you once more my
  thanks for your very brilliant efforts on my behalf. The very fact that I am
  able to offer you hospitality at all is without a doubt due to these."</p>

  <p>"I only did what I was paid to do," Francis insisted, a little harshly.
  "You must remember that these things come in the day's work with us."</p>

  <p>His host nodded.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he murmured. "There was another reason, too, why I was
  anxious to meet you, Mr. Ledsam," he continued. "You have gathered already
  that I am something of a crank. I have a profound detestation of all
  sentimentality and affected morals. It is a relief to me to come into contact
  with a man who is free from that bourgeois incubus to modern
  enterprise&mdash;a conscience."</p>

  <p>"Is that your estimate of me?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not? You practise your profession in the criminal courts, do you
  not?"</p>

  <p>"That is well-known," was the brief reply.</p>

  <p>"What measure of conscience can a man have," Oliver Hilditch argued
  blandly, "who pleads for the innocent and guilty alike with the same
  simulated fervour? Confess, now, Mr. Ledsam&mdash;there is no object in being
  hypocritical in this matter&mdash;have you not often pleaded for the guilty
  as though you believed them innocent?"</p>

  <p>"That has sometimes been my duty," Francis acknowledged.</p>

  <p>Hilditch laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"It is all part of the great hypocrisy of society," he proclaimed. "You
  have an extra glass of champagne for dinner at night and are congratulated by
  your friends because you have helped some poor devil to cheat the law, while
  all the time you know perfectly well, and so do your high-minded friends,
  that your whole attitude during those two hours of eloquence has been a lie.
  That is what first attracted me to you, Mr. Ledsam."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it," Francis commented coldly. "The ethics of my
  profession&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His host stopped him with a little wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>"Spare me that," he begged. "While we are on the subject, though, I have a
  question to ask you. My lawyer told me, directly after he had briefed you,
  that, although it would make no real difference to your pleading, it would be
  just as well for me to keep up my bluff of being innocent, even in private
  conversation with you. Why was that?"</p>

  <p>"For the very obvious reason," Francis told him, "that we are not all such
  rogues and vagabonds as you seem to think. There is more satisfaction to me,
  at any rate, in saving an innocent man's life than a guilty one's."</p>

  <p>Hilditch laughed as though amused.</p>

  <p>"Come," he threatened, "I am going to be ill-natured. You have shown signs
  of smugness, a quality which I detest. I am going to rob you of some part of
  your self-satisfaction. Of course I killed Jordan. I killed him in the very
  chair in which you are now sitting."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's intense silence. The woman was still fanning herself
  lazily. Francis leaned forward in his place.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to hear this!" he exclaimed harshly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish," his host replied, rising to his feet and strolling
  across the room. "You know the whole trouble of the prosecution. They
  couldn't discover the weapon, or anything like it, with which the deed was
  done. Now I'll show you something ingenious."</p>

  <p>Francis followed the other's movements with fascinated eyes. The woman
  scarcely turned her head. Hilditch paused at the further end of the room,
  where there were a couple of gun cases, some fishing rods and a bag, of golf
  clubs. From the latter he extracted a very ordinary-looking putter, and with
  it in his hands strolled back to them.</p>

  <p>"Do you play golf, Ledsam?" he asked. "What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>Francis took the putter into his hand. It was a very ordinary club, which
  had apparently seen a good deal of service, so much, indeed, that the leather
  wrapping at the top was commencing to unroll. The maker's name was on the
  back of the blade, also the name of the professional from whom it had been
  purchased. Francis swung the implement mechanically with his wrists.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be nothing extraordinary about the club," he pronounced.
  "It is very much like a cleek I putt with myself."</p>

  <p>"Yet it contains a secret which would most certainly have hanged me,"
  Oliver Hilditch declared pleasantly. "See!"</p>

  <p>He held the shaft firmly in one hand and bent the blade away from it. In a
  moment or two it yielded and he commenced to unscrew it. A little exclamation
  escaped from Francis' lips. The woman looked on with tired eyes.</p>

  <p>"The join in the steel," Hilditch pointed out, "is so fine as to be
  undistinguishable by the naked eye. Yet when the blade comes off, like this,
  you see that although the weight is absolutely adjusted, the inside is
  hollow. The dagger itself is encased in this cotton wool to avoid any
  rattling. I put it away in rather a hurry the last time I used it, and as you
  see I forgot to clean it."</p>

  <p>Francis staggered back and gripped at the mantelpiece. His eyes were
  filled with horror. Very slowly, and with the air of one engaged upon some
  interesting task, Oliver Hilditch had removed the blood-stained sheath of
  cotton wool from around the thin blade of a marvellous-looking stiletto, on
  which was also a long stain of encrusted blood.</p>

  <p>"There is a handle," he went on, "which is perhaps the most ingenious
  thing of all. You touch a spring here, and behold!"</p>

  <p>He pressed down two tiny supports which opened upon hinges about four
  inches from the top of the handle. There was now a complete hilt.</p>

  <p>"With this little weapon," he explained, "the point is so sharpened and
  the steel so wonderful that it is not necessary to stab. It has the
  perfection of a surgical instrument. You have only to lean it against a
  certain point in a man's anatomy, lunge ever so little and the whole thing is
  done. Come here, Mr. Ledsam, and I will show you the exact spot."</p>

  <p>Francis made no movement. His eyes were fixed upon the weapon.</p>

  <p>"If I had only known!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, if you had," the other protested soothingly, "you know
  perfectly well that it would not have made the slightest difference. Perhaps
  that little break in your voice would not have come quite so naturally, the
  little sweep of your arm towards me, the man whom a moment's thoughtlessness
  might sweep into Eternity, would have been a little stiffer, but what matter?
  You would still have done your best and you would probably still have
  succeeded. You don't care about trifling with Eternity, eh? Very well, I will
  find the place for you."</p>

  <p>Hilditch's fingers strayed along his shirt-front until he found a certain
  spot. Then he leaned the dagger against it, his forefinger and second finger
  pressed against the hilt. His eyes were fixed upon his guest's. He seemed
  genuinely interested. Francis, glancing away for a moment, was suddenly
  conscious of a new horror. The woman had leaned a little forward in her
  easy-chair until she had attained almost a crouching position. Her eyes
  seemed to be measuring the distance from where she sat to that quivering
  thread of steel.</p>

  <p>"You see, Ledsam," his host went on, "that point driven now at that angle
  would go clean through the vital part of my heart. And it needs no force,
  either&mdash;just the slow pressure of these two fingers. What did you say,
  Margaret?" he enquired, breaking off abruptly.</p>

  <p>The woman was seated upon the very edge of her chair, her eyes rivetted
  upon the dagger. There was no change in her face, not a tremor in her
  tone.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing," she replied. "I did not speak at all. I was just
  watching."</p>

  <p>Hilditch turned back to his guest.</p>

  <p>"These two fingers," he repeated, "and a flick of the wrist&mdash;very
  little more than would be necessary for a thirty yard putt right across the
  green."</p>

  <p>Francis had recovered himself, had found his bearings to a certain
  extent.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you have told me this, Mr. Hilditch," he said, a little
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" was the puzzled reply. "I thought you would be interested."</p>

  <p>"I am interested to this extent," Francis declared, "I shall accept no
  more cases such as yours unless I am convinced of my client's innocence. I
  look upon your confession to me as being in the worst possible taste, and I
  regret very much my efforts on your behalf."</p>

  <p>The woman was listening intently. Hilditch's expression was one of cynical
  wonder. Francis rose to his feet and moved across to his hostess.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Hilditch," he said, "will you allow me to make my apologies? Your
  husband and I have arrived at an understanding&mdash;or perhaps I should say
  a misunderstanding&mdash;which renders the acceptance of any further
  hospitality on my part impossible."</p>

  <p>She held out the tips of her fingers.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," she observed, with gentle sarcasm, "that you barristers
  were such purists morally. I thought you were rather proud of being the last
  hope of the criminal classes."</p>

  <p>"Madam," Francis replied, "I am not proud of having saved the life of a
  self-confessed murderer, even though that man may be your husband."</p>

  <p>Hilditch was laughing softly to himself as he escorted his departing guest
  to the door.</p>

  <p>"You have a quaint sense of humour," Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," Oliver Hilditch begged, "but your last few words rather
  appealed to me. You must be a person of very scanty perceptions if you could
  spend the evening here and not understand that my death is the one thing in
  the world which would make my wife happy."</p>

  <p>Francis walked home with these last words ringing in his ears. They seemed
  with him even in that brief period of troubled sleep which came to him when
  he had regained his rooms and turned in. They were there in the middle of the
  night when he was awakened, shivering, by the shrill summons of his telephone
  bell. He stood quaking before the instrument in his pajamas. It was the voice
  which, by reason of some ghastly premonition, he had dreaded to
  hear&mdash;level, composed, emotionless.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam?" she enquired.</p>

  <p>"I am Francis Ledsam," he assented. "Who wants me?"</p>

  <p>"It is Margaret Hilditch speaking," she announced. "I felt that I must
  ring up and tell you of a very strange thing which happened after you left
  this evening."</p>

  <p>"Go on," he begged hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"After you left," she went on, "my husband persisted in playing with that
  curious dagger. He laid it against his heart, and seated himself in the chair
  which Mr. Jordan had occupied, in the same attitude. It was what he called a
  reconstruction. While he was holding it there, I think that he must have had
  a fit, or it may have been remorse, we shall never know. He called out and I
  hurried across the room to him. I tried to snatch the dagger away&mdash;I did
  so, in fact&mdash;but I must have been too late. He had already applied that
  slight movement of the fingers which was necessary. The doctor has just left.
  He says that death must have been instantaneous."</p>

  <p>"But this is horrible!" Francis cried out into the well of darkness.</p>

  <p>"A person is on the way from Scotland Yard," the voice continued, without
  change or tremor. "When he has satisfied himself, I am going to bed. He is
  here now. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Francis tried to speak again but his words beat against a wall of silence.
  He sat upon the edge of the bed, shivering. In that moment of agony he seemed
  to hear again the echo of Oliver Hilditch's mocking words:</p>

  <p>"My death is the one thing in the world which would make my wife
  happy!"</p><a name="ch07"

  <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p>There was a good deal of speculation at the Sheridan Club, of which he was
  a popular and much envied member, as to the cause for the complete
  disappearance from their midst of Francis Ledsam since the culmination of the
  Hilditch tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Sent back four topping briefs, to my knowledge, last week," one of the
  legal luminaries of the place announced to a little group of friends and
  fellow-members over a before-dinner cocktail.</p>

  <p>"Griggs offered him the defence of William Bull, the Chippenham murderer,
  and he refused it," another remarked. "Griggs wrote him personally, and the
  reply came from the Brancaster Golf Club! It isn't like Ledsam to be taking
  golfing holidays in the middle of the session."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong with Ledsam," declared a gruff voice from the
  corner. "And don't gossip, you fellows, at the top of your voices like a lot
  of old women. He'll be calling here for me in a moment or two."</p>

  <p>They all looked around. Andrew Wilmore rose slowly to his feet and emerged
  from behind the sheets of an evening paper. He laid his hand upon the
  shoulder of a friend, and glanced towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Ledsam's had a touch of nerves," he confided. "There's been nothing else
  the matter with him. We've been down at the Dormy House at Brancaster and
  he's as right as a trivet now. That Hilditch affair did him in
  completely."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why," one of the bystanders observed. "He got Hilditch off
  all right. One of the finest addresses to a jury I ever heard."</p>

  <p>"That's just the point," Wilmore explained "You see, Ledsam had no idea
  that Hilditch was really guilty, and for two hours that afternoon he
  literally fought for his life, and in the end wrested a verdict from the
  jury, against the judge's summing up, by sheer magnetism or eloquence or
  whatever you fellows like to call it. The very night after, Hilditch
  confesses his guilt and commits suicide."</p>

  <p>"I still don't see where Ledsam's worry comes in," the legal luminary
  remarked. "The fact that the man was guilty is rather a feather in the cap of
  his counsel. Shows how jolly good his pleading must have been."</p>

  <p>"Just so," Wilmore agreed, "but Ledsam, as you know, is a very
  conscientious sort of fellow, and very sensitive, too. The whole thing was a
  shock to him."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a queer experience," a novelist remarked from the
  outskirts of the group, "to dine with a man whose life you have juggled away
  from the law, and then have him explain his crime to you, and the exact
  manner of its accomplishment. Seems to bring one amongst the goats,
  somehow."</p>

  <p>"Bit of a shock, no doubt," the lawyer assented, "but I still don't
  understand Ledsam's sending back all his briefs. He's not going to chuck the
  profession, is he?"</p>

  <p>"Not by any means," Wilmore declared. "I think he has an idea, though,
  that he doesn't want to accept any briefs unless he is convinced that the
  person whom he has to represent is innocent, and lawyers don't like that sort
  of thing, you know. You can't pick and choose, even when you have Leadsam's
  gifts."</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is," the novelist commented, "Francis Ledsam isn't callous
  enough to be associated with you money-grubbing dispensers of the law. He'd
  be all right as Public Prosecutor, a sort of Sir Galahad waving the banner of
  virtue, but he hates to stuff his pockets at the expense of the criminal
  classes."</p>

  <p>"Who the mischief are the criminal classes?" a police court magistrate
  demanded. "Personally, I call war profiteering criminal, I call a good many
  Stock Exchange deals criminal, and," he added, turning to a member of the
  committee who was hovering in the background, "I call it criminal to expect
  us to drink French vermouth like this."</p>

  <p>"There is another point of view," the latter retorted. "I call it a crime
  to expect a body of intelligent men to administer without emolument to the
  greed of such a crowd of rotters. You'll get the right stuff next week."</p>

  <p>The hall-porter approached and addressed Wilmore.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam is outside in a taxi, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Outside in a taxi?" the lawyer repeated. "Why on earth can't he come
  in?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard such rot," another declared. "Let's go and rope him
  in."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam desired me to say, sir," the hall porter continued, "to any of
  his friends who might be here, that he will be in to lunch to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me till then," Wilmore begged. "He'll be all right directly.
  He's simply altering his bearings and taking his time about it. If he's
  promised to lunch here to-morrow, he will. He's as near as possible through
  the wood. Coming up in the train, he suggested a little conversation to-night
  and afterwards the normal life. He means it, too. There's nothing neurotic
  about Ledsam."</p>

  <p>The magistrate nodded.</p>

  <p>"Run along, then, my merry Andrew," he said, "but see that Ledsam keeps
  his word about to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Andrew Wilmore plunged boldly into the forbidden subject later on that
  evening, as the two men sat side by side at one of the wall tables in Soto's
  famous club restaurant. They had consumed an excellent dinner. An empty
  champagne bottle had just been removed, double liqueur brandies had taken its
  place. Francis, with an air of complete and even exuberant humanity, had lit
  a huge cigar. The moment seemed propitious.</p>

  <p>"Francis," his friend began, "they say at the club that you refused to be
  briefed in the Chippenham affair."</p>

  <p>"Quite true," was the calm reply. "I told Griggs that I wouldn't have
  anything to do with it."</p>

  <p>Wilmore knew then that all was well. Francis' old air of strength and
  decision had returned. His voice was firm, his eyes were clear and bright.
  His manner seemed even to invite questioning.</p>

  <p>"I think I know why," Wilmore said, "but I should like you to tell me in
  your own words."</p>

  <p>Francis glanced around as though to be sure that they were not
  overheard.</p>

  <p>"Because," he replied, dropping his voice a little but still speaking with
  great distinctness, "William Bull is a cunning and dangerous criminal whom I
  should prefer to see hanged."</p>

  <p>"You know that?"</p>

  <p>"I know that."</p>

  <p>"It would be a great achievement to get him off," Wilmore persisted. "The
  evidence is very weak in places."</p>

  <p>"I believe that I could get him off," was the confident reply. "That is
  why I will not touch the brief. I think," Francis continued, "that I have
  already conveyed it to you indirectly, but here you are in plain words,
  Andrew. I have made up my mind that I will defend no man in future unless I
  am convinced of his innocence."</p>

  <p>"That means&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It means practically the end of my career at the bar," Francis admitted.
  "I realise that absolutely: Fortunately, as you know, I am not dependent upon
  my earnings, and I have had a wonderful ten years."</p>

  <p>"This is all because of the Hilditch affair, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely."</p>

  <p>Wilmore was still a little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"You seem to imagine that you have something on your conscience as regards
  that business," he said boldly.</p>

  <p>"I have," was the calm reply.</p>

  <p>"Come," Wilmore protested, "I don't quite follow your line of thought.
  Granted that Hilditch was a desperate criminal whom by the exercise of your
  special gifts you saved from the law, surely his tragic death balanced the
  account between you and Society?"</p>

  <p>"It might have done," Francis admitted, "if he had really committed
  suicide."</p>

  <p>Wilmore was genuinely startled. He looked at his companion curiously.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean, old chap?" he demanded. "Your own evidence at
  the inquest was practically conclusive as to that."</p>

  <p>Francis glanced around him with apparent indifference but in reality with
  keen and stealthy care. On their right was a glass division, through which
  the sound of their voices could not possibly penetrate. On their left was an
  empty space, and a table beyond was occupied by a well-known cinema magnate
  engaged in testing the attractions in daily life of a would-be film star.
  Nevertheless, Francis' voice was scarcely raised above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"My evidence at the coroner's inquest," he confided, "was a subtly
  concocted tissue of lies. I committed perjury freely. That is the real reason
  why I've been a little on the nervy side lately, and why I took these few
  months out of harness."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Wilmore exclaimed, setting down untasted the glass of brandy
  which he had just raised to his lips.</p>

  <p>"I want to finish this matter up," Francis continued calmly, "by making a
  clean breast of it to you, because from to-night I am starting afresh, with
  new interests in my life, what will practically amount to a new career. That
  is why I preferred not to dine at the club to-night, although I am looking
  forward to seeing them all again. I wanted instead to have this conversation
  with you. I lied at the inquest when I said that the relations between Oliver
  Hilditch and his wife that night seemed perfectly normal. I lied when I said
  that I knew of no cause for ill-will between them. I lied when I said that I
  left them on friendly terms. I lied when I said that Oliver Hilditch seemed
  depressed and nervous. I lied when I said that he expressed the deepest
  remorse for what he had done. There was every indication that night, of the
  hate which I happen to know existed between the woman and the man. I have not
  the faintest doubt in my mind but that she murdered him. In my judgment, she
  was perfectly justified in doing so."</p>

  <p>There followed a brief but enforced silence as some late arrivals passed
  their table. The room was well-ventilated but Andrew Wilmore felt suddenly
  hot and choking. A woman, one of the little group of newcomers, glanced
  towards Francis curiously.</p>

  <p>"Francis Ledsam, the criminal barrister," her companion
  whispered,&mdash;"the man who got Oliver Hilditch off. The man with him is
  Andrew Wilmore, the novelist. Discussing a case, I expect."</p><a name="ch08"
        id="ch08"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p>The little party of late diners passed on their way to the further end of
  the room, leaving a wave of artificiality behind, or was it, Andrew Wilmore
  wondered, in a moment of half-dazed speculation, that it was they and the
  rest of the gay company who represented the real things, and he and his
  companion who were playing a sombre part in some unreal and gloomier world.
  Francis' voice, however, when he recommenced his diatribe, was calm and
  matter-of-fact enough.</p>

  <p>"You see," he continued, argumentatively, "I was morally and actually
  responsible for the man's being brought back into Society. And far worse than
  that, I was responsible for his being thrust back again upon his wife. Ergo,
  I was also responsible for what she did that night. The matter seems as plain
  as a pikestaff to me. I did what I could to atone, rightly or wrongly it
  doesn't matter, because it is over and done with. There you are, old fellow,
  now you know what's been making me nervy. I've committed wholesale perjury,
  but I acted according to my conscience and I think according to justice. The
  thing has worried me, I admit, but it has passed, and I'm glad it's off my
  chest. One more liqueur, Andrew, and if you want to we'll talk about my plans
  for the future."</p>

  <p>The brandy was brought. Wilmore studied his friend curiously, not without
  some relief. Francis had lost the harassed and nervous appearance upon which
  his club friends had commented, which had been noticeable, even, to a
  diminishing extent, upon the golf course at Brancaster. He was alert and
  eager. He had the air of a man upon the threshold of some enterprise dear to
  his heart.</p>

  <p>"I have been through a queer experience," Francis continued presently, as
  he sipped his second liqueur. "Not only had I rather less than twelve hours
  to make up my mind whether I should commit a serious offence against the law,
  but a sensation which I always hoped that I might experience, has come to me
  in what I suppose I must call most unfortunate fashion."</p>

  <p>"The woman?" Wilmore ventured.</p>

  <p>Francis assented gloomily. There was a moment's silence. Wilmore, the
  metaphysician, saw then a strange thing. He saw a light steal across his
  friend's stern face. He saw his eyes for a moment soften, the hard mouth
  relax, something incredible, transforming, shine, as it were, out of the
  man's soul in that moment of self-revelation. It was gone like the momentary
  passing of a strange gleam of sunshine across a leaden sea, but those few
  seconds were sufficient. Wilmore knew well enough what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Oliver Hilditch's wife," Francis went on, after a few minutes' pause,
  "presents an enigma which at present I cannot hope to solve. The fact that
  she received her husband back again, knowing what he was and what he was
  capable of, is inexplicable to me. The woman herself is a mystery. I do not
  know what lies behind her extraordinary immobility. Feeling she must have,
  and courage, or she would never have dared to have ridded herself of the
  scourge of her life. But beyond that my judgment tells me nothing. I only
  know that sooner or later I shall seek her out. I shall discover all that I
  want to know, one way or the other. It may be for happiness&mdash;it may be
  the end of the things that count."</p>

  <p>"I guessed this," Wilmore admitted, with a little shiver which he was
  wholly unable to repress.</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then keep it to yourself, my dear fellow," he begged, "like everything
  else I am telling you tonight. I have come out of my experience changed in
  many ways," he continued, "but, leaving out that one secret chapter, this is
  the dominant factor which looms up before me. I bring into life a new
  aversion, almost a passion, Andrew, born in a tea-shop in the city, and
  ministered to by all that has happened since. I have lost that sort of
  indifference which my profession engenders towards crime. I am at war with
  the criminal, sometimes, I hope, in the Courts of Justice, but forever out of
  them. I am no longer indifferent as to whether men do good or evil so long as
  they do not cross my path. I am a hunter of sin. I am out to destroy. There's
  a touch of melodrama in this for you, Andrew," he concluded, with a little
  laugh, "but, my God, I'm in earnest!"</p>

  <p>"What does this mean so far as regards the routine of your daily life?"
  Wilmore asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, it brings us to the point we discussed down at Brancaster," Francis
  replied. "It will affect my work to this extent. I shall not accept any brief
  unless, after reading the evidence, I feel convinced that the accused is
  innocent."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," Wilmore observed, "but you know what it will mean,
  don't you? Lawyers aren't likely to single you out for a brief without ever
  feeling sure whether you will accept it or not."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't worry me," Francis declared. "I don't need the fees,
  fortunately, and I can always pick up enough work to keep me going by
  attending Sessions. One thing I can promise you&mdash;I certainly shall not
  sit in my rooms and wait for things to happen. Mine is a militant spirit and
  it needs the outlet of action."</p>

  <p>"Action, yes, but how?" Wilmore queried. "You can't be always hanging
  about the courts, waiting for the chance of defending some poor devil who's
  been wrongfully accused&mdash;there aren't enough of them, for one thing. On
  the other hand, you can't walk down Regent Street, brandishing a two-edged
  sword and hunting for pickpockets."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so flamboyant, I can assure you, Andrew," he replied; "nor shall
  I play the amateur detective with his mouth open for mysteries. But listen,"
  he went on earnestly. "I've had some experience, as you know, and,
  notwithstanding the Oliver Hilditch's of the world, I can generally tell a
  criminal when I meet him face to face. There are plenty of them about, too,
  Andrew&mdash;as many in this place as any other. I am not going to be content
  with a negative position as regards evildoers. I am going to set my heel on
  as many of the human vermin of this city as I can find."</p>

  <p>"A laudable, a most exhilarating and delightful pursuit! `human vermin,'
  too, is excellent. It opens up a new and fascinating vista for the modern
  sportsman. My congratulations!"</p>

  <p>It was an interruption of peculiar and wonderful significance, but Francis
  did not for the moment appreciate the fact. Turning his head, he simply saw a
  complete stranger seated unaccountably at the next table, who had butted into
  a private conversation and whose tone of gentle sarcasm, therefore, was the
  more offensive.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you, sir," he demanded, "and where did you come
  from?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer showed no resentment at Francis' little outburst. He simply
  smiled with deprecating amiability&mdash;a tall, spare man, with lean, hard
  face, complexion almost unnaturally white; black hair, plentifully
  besprinkled with grey; a thin, cynical mouth, notwithstanding its distinctly
  humourous curve, and keen, almost brilliant dark eyes. He was dressed in
  ordinary dinner garb; his linen and jewellery was indeed in the best possible
  taste. Francis, at his second glance, was troubled with a vague sense of
  familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Let me answer your last question first, sir," the intruder begged. "I was
  seated alone, several tables away, when the couple next to you went out, and
  having had pointed out to me the other evening at Claridge's Hotel, and
  knowing well by repute, the great barrister, Mr. Francis Ledsam, and his
  friend the world-famed novelist, Mr. Andrew Wilmore,
  I&mdash;er&mdash;unobtrusively made my way, half a yard at a time, in your
  direction&mdash;and here I am. I came stealthily, you may object? Without a
  doubt. If I had come in any other fashion, I should have disturbed a
  conversation in which I was much interested."</p>

  <p>"Could you find it convenient," Francis asked, with icy politeness, "to
  return to your own table, stealthily or not, as you choose?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer showed no signs of moving.</p>

  <p>"In after years," he declared, "you would be the first to regret the fact
  if I did so. This is a momentous meeting. It gives me an opportunity of
  expressing my deep gratitude to you, Mr. Ledsam, for the wonderful evidence
  you tendered at the inquest upon the body of my son-in-law, Oliver
  Hilditch."</p>

  <p>Francis turned in his place and looked steadily at this unsought-for
  companion, learning nothing, however, from the half-mocking smile and
  imperturbable expression.</p>

  <p>"Your son-in-law?" he repeated. "Do you mean to say that you are the
  father of&mdash;of Oliver Hilditch's wife?"</p>

  <p>"Widow," the other corrected gently. "I have that honour. You will
  understand, therefore, that I feel myself on this, the first opportunity,
  compelled to tender my sincere thanks for evidence so chivalrously offered,
  so flawlessly truthful."</p>

  <p>Francis was a man accustomed to self-control, but he clenched his hands so
  that his finger nails dug into his flesh. He was filled with an insane and
  unreasoning resentment against this man whose words were biting into his
  conscience. Nevertheless, he kept his tone level.</p>

  <p>"I do not desire your gratitude," he said, "nor, if you will permit me to
  say so, your further acquaintance."</p>

  <p>The stranger shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," he protested. "We were bound, in any case, to know one
  another. Shall I tell you why? You have just declared yourself anxious to set
  your heel upon the criminals of the world. I have the distinction of being
  perhaps the most famous patron of that maligned class now living&mdash;and my
  neck is at your service."</p>

  <p>"You appear to me," Francis said suavely, "to be a buffoon."</p>

  <p>It might have been fancy, but Francis could have sworn that he saw the
  glitter of a sovereign malevolence in the other's dark eyes. If so, it was
  but a passing weakness, for a moment later the half good-natured, half
  cynical smile was back again upon the man's lips.</p>

  <p>"If so, I am at least a buffoon of parts," was the prompt rejoinder. "I
  will, if you choose, prove myself."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Wilmore was leaning forward in his place,
  studying the newcomer earnestly. An impatient invective was somehow stifled
  upon Francis' lips.</p>

  <p>"Within a few yards of this place, sometime before the closing hour
  to-night," the intruder continued, earnestly yet with a curious absence of
  any human quality in his hard tone, "there will be a disturbance, and
  probably what you would call a crime will be committed. Will you use your
  vaunted gifts to hunt down the desperate criminal, and, in your own
  picturesque phraseology, set your heel upon his neck? Success may bring you
  fame, and the trail may lead&mdash;well, who knows where?"</p>

  <p>Afterwards, both Francis and Andrew Wilmore marvelled at themselves,
  unable at any time to find any reasonable explanation of their conduct, for
  they answered this man neither with ridicule, rudeness nor civility. They
  simply stared at him, impressed with the convincing arrogance of his
  challenge and unable to find words of reply. They received his mocking
  farewell without any form of reciprocation or sign of resentment. They
  watched him leave the room, a dignified, distinguished figure, sped on his
  way with marks of the deepest respect by waiters, maitres d'hotels and even
  the manager himself. They behaved, indeed, as they both admitted afterwards,
  like a couple of moonstruck idiots. When he had finally disappeared, however,
  they looked at one another and the spell was broken.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" Francis exclaimed. "Soto, come here at once."</p>

  <p>The manager hastened smilingly to their table.</p>

  <p>"Soto," Francis invoked, "tell us quickly&mdash;tell us the name of the
  gentleman who has just gone out, and who he is?"</p>

  <p>Soto was amazed.</p>

  <p>"You don't know Sir Timothy Brast, sir?" he exclaimed. "Why, he is
  supposed to be one of the richest men in the world! He spends money like
  water. They say that when he is in England, his place down the river alone
  costs a thousand pounds a week. When he gives a party here, we can find
  nothing good enough. He is our most generous client."</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy Brast," Wilmore repeated. "Yes, I have heard of him."</p>

  <p>"Why, everybody knows Sir Timothy," Soto went on eloquently. "He is the
  greatest living patron of boxing. He found the money for the last
  international fight."</p>

  <p>"Does he often come in alone like this?" Francis asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Either alone," Soto replied, "or with a very large party. He entertains
  magnificently."</p>

  <p>"I've seen his name in the paper in connection with something or other,
  during the last few weeks," Wilmore remarked reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Probably about two months ago, sir," Soto suggested. "He gave a donation
  of ten thousand pounds to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
  Animals, and they made him a Vice President.... In one moment, sir."</p>

  <p>The manager hurried away to receive a newly-arrived guest. Francis and his
  friend exchanged a wondering glance.</p>

  <p>"Father of Oliver Hilditch's wife," Wilmore observed, "the most munificent
  patron of boxing in the world, Vice President of the Society for the
  Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and self-confessed arch-criminal! He pulled
  our legs pretty well!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Francis assented absently.</p>

  <p>Wilmore glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"What about moving on somewhere?" he suggested. "We might go into the
  Alhambra for half-an-hour, if you like. The last act of the show is the
  best."</p>

  <p>Francis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We've got to see this thing out," he replied. "Have you forgotten that
  our friend promised us a sensation before we left?"</p>

  <p>Wilmore began to laugh a little derisively. Then, suddenly aware of some
  lack of sympathy between himself and his friend, he broke off and glanced
  curiously at the latter.</p>

  <p>"You're not taking him seriously, are you?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I am," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe that he was getting at us?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a moment."</p>

  <p>"You believe that something is going to happen here in this place, or
  quite close?"</p>

  <p>"I am convinced of it," was the calm reply.</p>

  <p>Wilmore was silent. For a moment he was troubled with his old fears as to
  his friend's condition. A glance, however, at Francis' set face and equable,
  watchful air, reassured him.</p>

  <p>"We must see the thing through, of course, then," he assented. "Let us see
  if we can spot the actors in the coming drama."</p><a name="ch09"

  <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p>It happened that the two men, waiting in the vestibule of the restaurant
  for Francis' car to crawl up to the entrance through the fog which had
  unexpectedly rolled up, heard the slight altercation which was afterwards
  referred to as preceding the tragedy. The two young people concerned were
  standing only a few feet away, the girl pretty, a little peevish, an ordinary
  type; her companion, whose boyish features were marred with dissipation, a
  very passable example of the young man about town going a little beyond his
  tether.</p>

  <p>"It's no good standing here, Victor!" the girl exclaimed, frowning. "The
  commissionaire's been gone ages already, and there are two others before us
  for taxis."</p>

  <p>"We can't walk," her escort replied gloomily. "It's a foul night. Nothing
  to do but wait, what? Let's go back and have another drink."</p>

  <p>The girl stamped her satin-shod foot impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," she expostulated. "You know I promised Clara we'd be
  there early."</p>

  <p>"All very well," the young man grumbled, "but what can we do? We shall
  have to wait our turn."</p>

  <p>"Why can't you slip out and look for a taxi yourself?" she suggested. "Do,
  Victor," she added, squeezing his arm. "You're so clever at picking them
  up."</p>

  <p>He made a little grimace, but lit a cigarette and turned up his coat
  collar.</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best," he promised. "Don't go on without me."</p>

  <p>"Try up towards Charing Cross Road, not the other way," she advised
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Right-oh!" he replied, which illuminative form of assent, a word spoken
  as he plunged unwillingly into the thick obscurity on the other side of the
  revolving doors, was probably the last he ever uttered on earth.</p>

  <p>Left alone, the girl began to shiver, as though suddenly cold. She turned
  around and glanced hurriedly back into the restaurant. At that moment she met
  the steady, questioning scrutiny of Francis' eyes. She stood as though
  transfixed. Then came the sound which every one talked of for months
  afterwards, the sound which no one who heard it ever forgot&mdash;the death
  cry of Victor Bidlake, followed a second afterwards by a muffled report. A
  strain of frenzied surprise seemed mingled with the horror. Afterwards,
  silence.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of some commotion outside, the sound of hurried
  footsteps and agitated voices. Then a terrible little procession appeared.
  Something&mdash;it seemed to be a shapeless heap of clothes&mdash;was carried
  in and laid upon the floor, in the little space between the revolving doors
  and the inner entrance. Two blue-liveried attendants kept back the horrified
  but curious crowd. Francis, vaguely recognised as being somehow or other
  connected with the law, was one of the few people allowed to remain whilst a
  doctor, fetched out from the dancing-room, kneeled over the prostrate form.
  He felt that he knew beforehand the horrible verdict which the latter
  whispered in his ear after his brief examination.</p>

  <p>"Quite dead! A ghastly business!"</p>

  <p>Francis gazed at the hole in the shirt-front, disfigured also by a
  scorching stain.</p>

  <p>"A bullet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Fired within a foot of the poor fellow's heart," he whispered. "The
  murderer wasn't taking any chances, whoever he was."</p>

  <p>"Have the police been sent for?"</p>

  <p>The head-porter stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"There was a policeman within a few yards of the spot, sir," he replied.
  "He's gone down to keep every one away from the place where we found the
  body. We've telephoned to Scotland Yard for an inspector."</p>

  <p>The doctor rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more can be done," he pronounced. "Keep the people out of here
  whilst I go and fetch my hat and coat. Afterwards, I'll take the body to the
  mortuary when the ambulance arrives."</p>

  <p>An attendant pushed his way through the crowd of people on the inner side
  of the door.</p>

  <p>"Miss Daisy Hyslop, young lady who was with Mr. Bidlake, has just fainted
  in the ladies' room, sir," he announced. "Could you come?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be there immediately," the doctor promised.</p>

  <p>The rest of the proceedings followed a normal course. The police arrived,
  took various notes, the ambulance followed a little later, the body was
  removed, and the little crowd of guests, still infected with a sort of awed
  excitement, were allowed to take their leave. Francis and Wilmore drove
  almost in silence to the former's rooms in Clarges Street.</p>

  <p>"Come up and have a drink, Andrew," Francis invited.</p>

  <p>"I need it," was the half-choked response.</p>

  <p>Francis led the way in silence up the two flights of stairs into his
  sitting-room, mixed whiskies and sodas from the decanter and syphon which
  stood upon the sideboard, and motioned his friend to an easy-chair. Then he
  gave form to the thought which had been haunting them both.</p>

  <p>"What about our friend Sir Timothy Brast?" he enquired. "Do you believe
  now that he was pulling our legs?"</p>

  <p>Wilmore dabbed his forehead with his handkerchief. It was a chilly
  evening, but there were drops of perspiration still standing there.</p>

  <p>"Francis," he confessed, "it's horrible! I don't think realism like this
  attracts me. It's horrible! What are we going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing for the present," was the brief reply. "If we were to tell our
  story, we should only be laughed at. What there is to be done falls to my
  lot."</p>

  <p>"Had the police anything to say about it?" Wilmore asked.</p>

  <p>"Only a few words," Francis replied. "Shopland has it in hand. A good man
  but unimaginative. I've come across him in one or two cases lately. You'll
  find a little bit like this in the papers to-morrow: 'The murder is believed
  to have been committed by one of the gang of desperadoes who have infested
  the west-end during the last few months.' You remember the assault in the
  Albany Court Yard, and the sandbagging in Shepherd Market only last
  week?"</p>

  <p>"That seems to let Sir Timothy out," Wilmore remarked.</p>

  <p>"There are many motives for crime besides robbery," Francis declared.
  "Don't be afraid, Andrew, that I am going to turn amateur detective and make
  the unravelment of this case all the more difficult for Scotland Yard. If I
  interfere, it will be on a certainty. Andrew, don't think I'm mad but I've
  taken up the challenge our great philanthropist flung at me to-night. I've
  very little interest in who killed this boy Victor Bidlake, or why, but I'm
  convinced of one thing&mdash;Brast knew about it, and if he is posing as a
  patron of crime on a great scale, sooner or later I shall get him. He may
  think himself safe, and he may have the courage of Beelzebub&mdash;he seems
  rather that type&mdash;but if my presentiment about him&mdash;comes true, his
  number's up. I can almost divine the meaning of his breaking in upon our
  conversation to-night. He needs an enemy&mdash;he is thirsting for danger. He
  has found it!"</p>

  <p>Wilmore filled his pipe thoughtfully. At the first whiff of tobacco he
  began to feel more normal.</p>

  <p>"After all, Francis," he said, "aren't we a little overstrung to-night?
  Sir Timothy Brast is no adventurer. He is a prince in the city, a persona
  grata wherever he chooses to go. He isn't a hanger-on in Society. He isn't
  even dependent upon Bohemia for his entertainment. You can't seriously
  imagine that a man with his possessions is likely to risk his life and
  liberty in becoming the inspiration of a band of cutthroats?"</p>

  <p>Francis smiled. He, too, had lit his pipe and had thrown himself into his
  favourite chair. He smiled confidently across at his friend.</p>

  <p>"A millionaire with brains," he argued, "is just the one person in the
  world likely to weary of all ordinary forms of diversion. I begin to remember
  things about him already. Haven't you heard about his wonderful parties down
  at The Walled House?"</p>

  <p>Wilmore struck the table by his side with his clenched fist.</p>

  <p>"By George, that's it!" he exclaimed. "Who hasn't!"</p>

  <p>"I remember Baker talking about one last year," Francis continued, "never
  any details, but all kinds of mysterious hints&mdash;a sort of mixture
  between a Roman orgy and a chapter from the 'Arabian Nights'&mdash;singers
  from Petrograd, dancers from Africa and fighting men from Chicago."</p>

  <p>"The fellow's magnificent, at any rate," Wilmore remarked.</p>

  <p>His host smoked furiously for a moment.</p>

  <p>"That's the worst of these multi-millionaires," he declared. "They think
  they can rule the world, traffic in human souls, buy morals, mock at the law.
  We shall see!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know the thing that I found most interesting about him?" Wilmore
  asked.</p>

  <p>"His black opals," the other suggested. "You're by the way of being a
  collector, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Wilmore shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The fact that he is the father of Oliver Hilditch's widow."</p>

  <p>Francis sat quite still for a moment. There was a complete change in his
  expression. He looked like a man who has received a shock.</p>

  <p>"I forgot that," he muttered.</p><a name="ch10"

  <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p>Francis met Shopland one morning about a week later, on his way from
  Clarges Street to his chambers in the Temple. The detective raised his hat
  and would have passed on, but Francis accosted him.</p>

  <p>"Any progress, Mr. Shopland?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>The detective fingered his small, sandy moustache. He was an
  insignificant-looking little man, undersized, with thin frame and watery
  eyes. His mouth, however, was hard, and there were some tell-tale little
  lines at its corners.</p>

  <p>"None whatever, I am sorry to say, Mr. Ledsam," he admitted. "At present
  we are quite in the dark."</p>

  <p>"You found the weapon, I hear?"</p>

  <p>Shopland nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was just an ordinary service revolver, dating from the time of the
  war, exactly like a hundred thousand others. The enquiries we were able to
  make from it came to nothing."</p>

  <p>"Where was it picked up?"</p>

  <p>"In the middle of the waste plot of ground next to Soto's. The murderer
  evidently threw it there the moment he had discharged it. He must have been
  wearing rubber-soled shoes, for not a soul heard him go."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, after a slight pause, "whether it ever occurred to
  you to interview Miss Daisy Hyslop, the young lady who was with Bidlake on
  the night of his murder?"</p>

  <p>"I called upon her the day afterwards," the detective answered.</p>

  <p>"She had nothing to say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

  <p>"Indirectly, of course," Francis continued, "the poor girl was the cause
  of his death. If she had not insisted upon his going out for a taxicab, the
  man who was loitering about would probably have never got hold of him."</p>

  <p>The detective glanced up furtively at the speaker. He seemed to reflect
  for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I gathered," he said, "in conversation with the commissionaire, that Miss
  Hyslop was a little impatient that night. It seems, however, that she was
  anxious to get to a ball which was being given down in Kensington."</p>

  <p>"There was a ball, was there?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," the detective replied. "It was given by a Miss Clara
  Bultiwell. She happens to remember urging Miss Hyslop to come on as early as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"So that's that," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Just so, Mr. Ledsam," the detective murmured.</p>

  <p>They were walking along the Mall now, eastwards. The detective, who seemed
  to have been just a saunterer, had accommodated himself to Francis'
  destination.</p>

  <p>"Let me see, there was nothing stolen from the young man's person, was
  there?" Francis asked presently.</p>

  <p>"Apparently nothing at all, sir."</p>

  <p>"And I gather that you have made every possible enquiry as to the young
  man's relations with his friends?"</p>

  <p>"So far as one can learn, sir, they seem to have been perfectly
  amicable."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Francis remarked presently, "this may have been quite a
  purposeless affair. The deed may have been committed by a man who was
  practically a lunatic, without any motive or reason whatever."</p>

  <p>"Precisely so, sir," the detective agreed.</p>

  <p>"But, all the same, I don't think it was."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I, sir."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Shopland," he said, "if there is no further external evidence to be
  collected, I suggest that there is only one person likely to prove of
  assistance to you."</p>

  <p>"And that one person, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Daisy Hyslop."</p>

  <p>"The young lady whom I have already seen?"</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"The young lady whom you have already seen," he assented. "At the same
  time, Mr. Shopland, we must remember this. If Miss Hyslop has any knowledge
  of the facts which are behind Mr. Bidlake's murder, it is more likely to be
  to her interest to keep them to herself, than to give them away to the police
  free gratis and for nothing. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely, sir."</p>

  <p>"That being so," Francis continued, "I am going to make a proposition to
  you for what it is worth. Where were you going when I met you this morning,
  Shopland?"</p>

  <p>"To call upon you in Clarges Street, sir."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you if you would be so kind as to call upon Miss Daisy
  Hyslop, sir."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Great minds," he murmured. "I will see the young lady this afternoon,
  Shopland."</p>

  <p>The detective raised his hat. They had reached the spot where his
  companion turned off by the Horse Guards Parade.</p>

  <p>"I may hope to hear from you, then, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Within the course of a day or two, perhaps earlier," Francis
  promised.</p>

  <p>Francis continued his walk along the Embankment to his chambers in the
  Temple. He glanced in the outer office as he passed to his consulting
  room.</p>

  <p>"Anything fresh, Angrave?" he asked his head-clerk.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever, sir," was the quiet reply.</p>

  <p>He passed on to his own den&mdash;a bare room with long windows looking
  out over the gardens. He glanced at the two or three letters which lay on his
  desk, none of them of the least interest, and leaning back in his chair
  commenced to fill his pipe. There was a knock at the door. Fawsitt, a young
  beginner at the bar, in whom he had taken some interest and who deviled for
  him, presented himself.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a word with you, Mr. Ledsam?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," was the prompt response. "Sit down."</p>

  <p>Fawsitt seated himself on the other side of the table. He had a long, thin
  face, dark, narrow eyes, unwholesome complexion, a slightly hooked nose, and
  teeth discoloured through constant smoking. His fingers, too, bore the
  tell-tale yellow stains.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," he said, "I think, with your permission, I should like to
  leave at the end of my next three months."</p>

  <p>Francis glanced across at him.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to hear that, Fawsitt. Are you going to work for any one else?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't made arrangements yet, sir," the young man replied. "I thought
  of offering myself to Mr. Barnes."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to leave me?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"There isn't enough for me to do, sir."</p>

  <p>Francis lit his pipe.</p>

  <p>"It's probably just a lull, Fawsitt," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, sir."</p>

  <p>"The devil! You've been gossiping with some of these solicitors' clerks,
  Fawsitt."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't call it gossiping, sir. I am always interested to hear
  anything that may concern our&mdash;my future. I have reason to believe, sir,
  that we are being passed over for briefs."</p>

  <p>"The reason being?"</p>

  <p>"One can't pick and choose, sir. One shouldn't, anyway."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"You evidently don't approve of any measure of personal choice as to the
  work which one takes up."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do not, sir, in our profession. The only brief I would refuse
  would be a losing or an ill-paid one. I don't conceive it to be our business
  to prejudge a case."</p>

  <p>"I see," Francis murmured. "Go on, Fawsitt."</p>

  <p>"There's a rumour about," the young man continued, "that you are only
  going to plead where the chances are that your client is innocent."</p>

  <p>"There's some truth in that," Francis admitted.</p>

  <p>"If I could leave a little before the three months, sir, I should be
  glad," Fawsitt said. "I look at the matter from an entirely different point
  of view."</p>

  <p>"You shall leave when you like, of course, Fawsitt, but tell me what that
  point of view is?"</p>

  <p>"Just this, sir. The simplest-minded idiot who ever stammered through his
  address, can get an innocent prisoner off if he knows enough of the facts and
  the law. To my mind, the real triumph in our profession is to be able to
  unwind the meshes of damning facts and force a verdict for an indubitably
  guilty client."</p>

  <p>"How does the moral side of that appeal to you?" his senior enquired.</p>

  <p>"I didn't become a barrister to study morals, or even to consider them,"
  was the somewhat caustic reply. "When once a brief is in my mind, it is a
  matter of brain, cunning and resource. The guiltier a man, the greater the
  success if you can get him off."</p>

  <p>"And turn him loose again upon Society?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't our job to consider that, sir. The moral question is only
  confusing in the matter. Our job is to make use of the law for the benefit of
  our client. That's what we're paid for. That's the measure of our success or
  failure."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very reasonably put, Fawsitt," he conceded. "I'll give you a letter to
  Barnes whenever you like."</p>

  <p>"I should be glad if you would do so, sir," the young man said. "I'm only
  wasting my time here...."</p>

  <p>Francis wrote a letter of recommendation to Barnes, the great K.C.,
  considered a stray brief which had found its way in, and strolled up towards
  the Milan as the hour approached luncheon-time. In the American bar of that
  palatial hotel he found the young man he was looking for&mdash;a
  flaxen-haired youth who was seated upon one of the small tables, with his
  feet upon a chair, laying down the law to a little group of acquaintances. He
  greeted Francis cordially but without that due measure of respect which
  nineteen should accord to thirty-five.</p>

  <p>"Cheerio, my elderly relative!" he exclaimed. "Have a cocktail."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"Come into this corner with me for a moment, Charles," he invited. "I have
  a word for your ear."</p>

  <p>The young man rose and sat by his uncle's side on a settee.</p>

  <p>"In my declining years," the latter began, "I find myself reverting to the
  follies of youth. I require a letter of introduction from you to a young lady
  of your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"The devil! Not one of my own special little pets, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is Miss Daisy Hyslop," Francis announced.</p>

  <p>Lord Charles Southover pursed his lips and whistled. He glanced at Francis
  sideways.</p>

  <p>"Is this the beginning of a campaign amongst the butterflies," he
  enquired, "because, if so, I feel it my duty, uncle, to address to you a few
  words of solemn warning. Miss Daisy Hyslop is hot stuff."</p>

  <p>"Look here, young fellow," Francis said equably, "I don't know what the
  state of your exchequer is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I owe you forty," Lord Charles interrupted. "Spring another tenner, make
  it fifty, that is, and the letter of introduction I will write for you will
  bring tears of gratitude to your eyes."</p>

  <p>"I'll spring the tenner," Francis promised, "but you'll write just what I
  tell you&mdash;no more and no less."</p>

  <p>"Anything extra for keeping mum at home?" the young man ventured
  tentatively.</p>

  <p>"You're a nice sort of nephew to have!" Francis declared. "Abandon these
  futile attempts at blackmail and just come this way to the
  writing-table."</p>

  <p>"You've got the tenner with you?" the young man asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>Francis produced a well-filled pocketbook. His nephew led the way to a
  writing-table, lit a cigarette which he stuck into the corner of his mouth,
  and in painstaking fashion wrote the few lines which Francis dictated. The
  ten pounds changed hands.</p>

  <p>"Have one with me for luck?" the young man invited brightly. "No? Perhaps
  you're right," he added, in valedictory fashion. "You'd better keep your head
  clear for Daisy!"</p><a name="ch11"
        id="ch11"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a>

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p>Miss Daisy Hyslop received Francis that afternoon, in the sitting-room of
  her little suite at the Milan. Her welcoming smile was plaintive and a little
  subdued, her manner undeniably gracious. She was dressed in black, a
  wonderful background for her really gorgeous hair, and her deportment
  indicated a recent loss.</p>

  <p>"How nice of you to come and see me," she murmured, with a lingering touch
  of the fingers. "Do take that easy-chair, please, and sit down and talk to
  me. Your roses were beautiful, but whatever made you send them to me?"</p>

  <p>"Impulse," he answered.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Then please yield to such impulses as often as you feel them," she
  begged. "I adore flowers. Just now, too," she added, with a little sigh,
  "anything is welcome which helps to keep my mind off my own affairs."</p>

  <p>"It was very good of you to let me come," he declared. "I can quite
  understand that you don't feel like seeing many people just now."</p>

  <p>Francis' manner, although deferential and courteous, had nevertheless some
  quality of aloofness in it to which she was unused and which she was quick to
  recognise. The smile, faded from her face. She seemed suddenly not quite so
  young.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I seen you before somewhere quite lately?" she asked, a little
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"You saw me at Soto's, the night that Victor Bidlake was murdered," he
  reminded her. "I stood quite close to you both while you were waiting for
  your taxi."</p>

  <p>The animation evoked by this call from a presumably new admirer, suddenly
  left her. She became nervous and constrained. She glanced again at his
  card.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me," she begged, "that you have come to ask me any questions
  about that night! I simply could not bear it. The police have been here
  twice, and I had nothing to tell them, absolutely nothing."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he assented soothingly. "Police have such a clumsy way of
  expecting valuable information for nothing. I'm always glad to hear of their
  being disappointed."</p>

  <p>She studied her visitor for a moment carefully. Then she turned to the
  table by her side, picked up a note and read it through.</p>

  <p>"Lord Southover tells me here," she said, "that you are just a pal of his
  who wants to make my acquaintance. He doesn't say why."</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" Francis asked good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>She moved in her chair a little nervously, crossing and uncrossing her
  legs more than once. Her white silk stockings underneath her black skirt were
  exceedingly effective, a fact of which she never lost consciousness, although
  at that moment she was scarcely inspired to play the coquette.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to think it wasn't," she admitted frankly.</p>

  <p>"I've seen you repeatedly upon the stage," he told her, "and, though
  musical comedy is rather out of my line, I have always admired you
  immensely."</p>

  <p>She studied him once more almost wistfully.</p>

  <p>"You look very nice," she acknowledged, "but you don't look at all the
  kind of man who admires girls who do the sort of rubbish I do on the
  stage."</p>

  <p>"What do I look like?" he asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"A man with a purpose," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I begin to think," he ventured, "that we shall get on. You are really a
  very astute young lady."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure you're not one of these amateur detectives one reads
  about?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he assured her. "I will confess that I am interested in
  Victor Bidlake's death, and I should like to discover the truth about it, but
  I have a reason for that which I may tell you some day. It has nothing
  whatever to do with the young man himself. To the best of my belief, I never
  saw or heard of him before in my life. My interest lies with another person.
  You have lost a great friend, I know. If you felt disposed to tell me the
  whole story, it might make such a difference."</p>

  <p>She sighed. Her confidence was returning&mdash;also her self-pity. The
  latter at once betrayed itself.</p>

  <p>"You see," she confided, "Victor and I were engaged to be married, so
  naturally I let him help me a little. I shan't be able to stay on here now.
  They are bothering me about their bill already," she added, with a
  side-glance at an envelope which stood on a table by her side.</p>

  <p>He drew a little nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hyslop&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Daisy," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Miss Daisy Hyslop, then," he continued, smiling, "I suggested just now
  that I did not want to come and bother you for information without any
  return. If I can be of any assistance to you in that matter," he added,
  glancing towards the envelope, "I shall be very pleased."</p>

  <p>She sighed gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Just till Victor's people return to town," she said. "I know that they
  mean to do something for me."</p>

  <p>"How much?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred pounds would keep me going," she told him.</p>

  <p>He wrote out a cheque. Miss Hyslop drew a sigh of relief as she laid it on
  one side with the envelope. Then she swung round in her chair to face him
  where he sat at the writing-table.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you will think that what I have to tell is very
  insignificant," she confessed. "Victor was one of those boys who always
  fancied themselves bored. He was bored with polo, bored with motoring, bored
  with the country and bored with town. Then quite suddenly during the last few
  weeks he seemed changed. All that he would tell me was that he had found a
  new interest in life. I don't know what it was but I don't think it was a
  nice one. He seemed to drop all his old friends, too, and go about with a new
  set altogether&mdash;not a nice set at all. He used to stay out all night,
  and he quite gave up going to dances and places where he could take me. Once
  or twice he came here in the afternoon, dead beat, without having been to bed
  at all, and before he could say half-a-dozen words he was asleep in my
  easy-chair. He used to mutter such horrible things that I had to wake him
  up."</p>

  <p>"Was he ever short of money?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not seriously," she answered. "He was quite well-off, besides what his
  people allowed him. I was going to have a wonderful settlement as soon as our
  engagement was announced. However, to go on with what I was telling you, the
  very night before&mdash;it happened&mdash;he came in to see me, looking like
  nothing on earth. He cried like a baby, behaved like a lunatic, and called
  himself all manner of names. He had had a great deal too much to drink, and I
  gathered that he had seen something horrible. It was then he asked me to dine
  with him the next night, and told me that he was going to break altogether
  with his new friends. Something in connection with them seemed to have given
  him a terrible fright."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded. He had the tact to abandon his curiosity at this precise
  point.</p>

  <p>"The old story," he declared, "bad company and rotten habits. I suppose
  some one got to know that the young man usually carried a great deal of money
  about with him."</p>

  <p>"It was so foolish of him," she assented eagerly: "I warned him about it
  so often. The police won't listen to it but I am absolutely certain that he
  was robbed. I noticed when he paid the bill that he had a great wad of
  bank-notes which were never discovered afterwards."</p>

  <p>Francis rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing to-night?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she acknowledged eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Then let's dine somewhere and see the show at the Frivolity," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"You dear man!" she assented with enthusiasm. "The one thing I wanted to
  do, and the one person I wanted to do it with."</p><a name="ch12"

  <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p>It was after leaving Miss Daisy Hyslop's flat that the event to which
  Francis Ledsam had been looking forward more than anything else in the world,
  happened. It came about entirely by chance. There were no taxis in the
  Strand. Francis himself had finished work for the day, and feeling
  disinclined for his usual rubber of bridge, he strolled homewards along the
  Mall. At the corner of Green Park, he came face to face with the woman who
  for the last few months had scarcely been out of his thoughts. Even in that
  first moment he realised to his pain that she would have avoided him if she
  could. They met, however, where the path narrowed, and he left her no chance
  to avoid him. That curious impulse of conventionality which opens a
  conversation always with cut and dried banalities, saved them perhaps from a
  certain amount of embarrassment. Without any conscious suggestion, they found
  themselves walking side by side.</p>

  <p>"I have been wanting to see you very much indeed," he said. "I even went
  so far as to wonder whether I dared call."</p>

  <p>"Why should you?" she asked. "Our acquaintance began and ended in tragedy.
  There is scarcely any purpose in carrying it further."</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a moment before replying. She was wearing black, but
  scarcely the black of a woman who sorrows. She was still frigidly beautiful,
  redolent, in all the details of her toilette, of that almost negative
  perfection which he had learnt to expect from her. She suggested to him still
  that same sense of aloofness from the actualities of life.</p>

  <p>"I prefer not to believe that it is ended," he protested. "Have you so
  many friends that you have no room for one who has never consciously done you
  any harm?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with some faint curiosity in her immobile features.</p>

  <p>"Harm? No! On the contrary, I suppose I ought to thank you for your
  evidence at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Some part of it was the truth," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she admitted drily. "You told it very cleverly."</p>

  <p>He looked her in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"My profession helped me to be a good witness," he said. "As for the gist
  of my evidence, that was between my conscience and myself."</p>

  <p>"Your conscience?" she repeated. "Are there really men who possess such
  things?"</p>

  <p>"I hope you will discover that for yourself some day," he answered. "Tell
  me your plans? Where are you living?"</p>

  <p>"For the present with my father in Curzon Street."</p>

  <p>"With Sir Timothy Brast?"</p>

  <p>She assented.</p>

  <p>"You know him?" she asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Very slightly," Francis replied. "We talked together, some nights ago, at
  Soto's Restaurant. I am afraid that I did not make a very favourable
  impression upon him. I gathered, too, that he has somewhat eccentric
  tastes."</p>

  <p>"I do not see a great deal of my father," she said. "We met, a few months
  ago, for the first time since my marriage, and things have been a little
  difficult between us&mdash;just at first. He really scarcely ever puts in an
  appearance at Curzon Street. I dare say you have heard that he makes a hobby
  of an amazing country house which he has down the river."</p>

  <p>"The Walled House?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see you have heard of it. All London, they tell me, gossips about the
  entertainments there."</p>

  <p>"Are they really so wonderful?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have never been to one," she replied. "As a matter of fact, I have
  spent scarcely any time in England since my marriage. My husband, as I
  remember he told you, was fond of travelling."</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the warm spring air he was conscious of a certain
  chilliness. Her level, indifferent tone seemed to him almost abnormally
  callous. A horrible realisation flashed for a moment in his brain. She was
  speaking of the man whom she had killed!</p>

  <p>"Your father overheard a remark of mine," Francis told her. "I was at
  Soto's with a friend&mdash;Andrew Wilmore, the novelist&mdash;and to tell you
  the truth we were speaking of the shock I experienced when I realised that I
  had been devoting every effort of which I was capable, to saving the life
  of&mdash;shall we say a criminal? Your father heard me say, in rather a
  flamboyant manner, perhaps, that in future I declared war against all crime
  and all criminals."</p>

  <p>She smiled very faintly, a smile which had in it no single element of joy
  or humour.</p>

  <p>"I can quite understand my father intervening," she said. "He poses as
  being rather a patron of artistically-perpetrated crime. Sue is his favourite
  author, and I believe that he has exceedingly grim ideas as to duelling and
  fighting generally. He was in prison once for six months at New Orleans for
  killing a man who insulted my mother. Nothing in the world would ever have
  convinced him that he had not done a perfectly legitimate thing."</p>

  <p>"I am expecting to find him quite an interesting study, when I know him
  better," Francis pronounced. "My only fear is that he will count me an
  unfriendly person and refuse to have anything to do with me."</p>

  <p>"I am not at all sure," she said indifferently, "that it would not be very
  much better for you if he did."</p>

  <p>"I cannot admit that," he answered, smiling. "I think that our paths in
  life are too far apart for either of us to influence the other. You don't
  share his tastes, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Which ones?" she asked, after a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"Well, boxing for one," he replied. "They tell me that he is the greatest
  living patron of the ring, both here and in America."</p>

  <p>"I have never been to a fight in my life," she confessed. "I hope that I
  never may."</p>

  <p>"I can't go so far as that," he declared, "but boxing isn't altogether one
  of my hobbies. Can't we leave your father and his tastes alone for the
  present? I would rather talk about&mdash;ourselves. Tell me what you care
  about most in life?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she answered listlessly.</p>

  <p>"But that is only a phase," he persisted. "You have had terrible trials, I
  know, and they must have affected your outlook on life, but you are still
  young, and while one is young life is always worth having."</p>

  <p>"I thought so once," she assented. "I don't now."</p>

  <p>"But there must be&mdash;there will be compensations," he assured her. "I
  know that just now you are suffering from the reaction&mdash;after all you
  have gone through. The memory of that will pass."</p>

  <p>"The memory of what I have gone through will never pass," she
  answered.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's intense silence, a silence pregnant with reminiscent
  drama. The little room rose up before his memory&mdash;the woman's hopeless,
  hating eyes, the quivering thread of steel, the dead man's mocking words. He
  seemed at that moment to see into the recesses of her mind. Was it remorse
  that troubled her, he wondered? Did she lack strength to realise that in that
  half-hour at the inquest he had placed on record for ever his judgment of her
  deed? Even to think of it now was morbid. Although he would never have
  confessed it even to himself, there was growing daily in his mind some idea
  of reward. She had never thanked him&mdash;he hoped that she never
  would&mdash;but he had surely a right to claim some measure of her thoughts,
  some light place in her life.</p>

  <p>"Please look at me," he begged, a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>She turned her head in some surprise. Francis was almost handsome in the
  clear Spring sunlight, his face alight with animation, his deep-set grey eyes
  full of amused yet anxious solicitude. Even as she appreciated these things
  and became dimly conscious of his eager interest, her perturbation seemed to
  grow.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she ventured.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like a person who knew what he was talking about?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"On the whole, I should say that you did," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," he went on cheerfully, "believe me when I say that the
  shadow which depresses you all the time now will pass. I say this
  confidently," he added, his voice softening, "because I hope to be allowed to
  help. Haven't you guessed that I am very glad indeed to see you again?"</p>

  <p>She came to a sudden standstill. They had just passed through Lansdowne
  Passage and were in the quiet end of Curzon Street.</p>

  <p>"But you must not talk to me like that!" she expostulated.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded. "We have met under strange and untoward
  circumstances, but are you so very different from other women?"</p>

  <p>For a single moment she seemed infinitely more human, startled, a little
  nervous, exquisitely sympathetic to an amazing and unexpected impression. She
  seemed to look with glad but terrified eyes towards the vision of possible
  things&mdash;and then to realise that it was but a trick of the fancy and to
  come shivering back to the world of actualities.</p>

  <p>"I am very different," she said quietly. "I have lived my life. What I
  lack in years has been made up to me in horror. I have no desire now but to
  get rid of this aftermath of years as smoothly and quickly as possible. I do
  not wish any man, Mr. Ledsam, to talk to me as you are doing."</p>

  <p>"You will not accept my friendship?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," she replied.</p>

  <p>"May I be allowed to call upon you?" he went on, doggedly.</p>

  <p>"I do not receive visitors," she answered.</p>

  <p>They were walking slowly up Curzon Street now. She had given him every
  opportunity to leave her, opportunities to which he was persistently blind.
  Her obstinacy had been a shock to him.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "but I cannot accept my dismissal like this. I
  shall appeal to your father. However much he may dislike me, he has at least
  common-sense."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a touch of the old horror in her coldly-questioning
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"In your way you have been kind to me," she admitted. "Let me in return
  give you a word of advice. Let me beg you to have nothing whatever to do with
  my father, in friendship or in enmity. Either might be equally disastrous.
  Either, in the long run, is likely to cost you dear."</p>

  <p>"If that is your opinion of your father, why do you live with him?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She had become entirely callous again. Her smile, with its mocking
  quality, reminded him for a moment of the man whom they were discussing.</p>

  <p>"Because I am a luxury and comfort-loving parasite," she answered
  deliberately, "because my father gladly pays my accounts at Lucille and Worth
  and Reville, because I have never learnt to do without things. And please
  remember this. My father, so far as I am concerned, has no faults. He is a
  generous and courteous companion. Nevertheless, number 70 b, Curzon Street is
  no place for people who desire to lead normal lives."</p>

  <p>And with that she was gone. Her gesture of dismissal was so complete and
  final that he had no courage for further argument. He had lost her almost as
  soon as he had found her.</p><a name="ch13"

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p>Four men were discussing the verdict at the adjourned inquest upon Victor
  Bidlake, at Soto's American Bar about a fortnight later. They were Robert
  Fairfax, a young actor in musical comedy, Peter Jacks, a cinema producer,
  Gerald Morse, a dress designer, and Sidney Voss, a musical composer and
  librettist, all habitues of the place and members of the little circle
  towards which the dead man had seemed, during the last few weeks of his life,
  to have become attracted. At a table a short distance away, Francis Ledsam
  was seated with a cocktail and a dish of almonds before him. He seemed to be
  studying an evening paper and to be taking but the scantiest notice of the
  conversation at the bar.</p>

  <p>"It just shows," Peter Jacks declared, "that crime is the easiest game in
  the world. Given a reasonable amount of intelligence, and a murderer's
  business is about as simple as a sandwich-man's."</p>

  <p>"The police," Gerald Morse, a pale-faced, anaemic-looking youth, declared,
  "rely upon two things, circumstantial evidence and motive. In the present
  case there is no circumstantial evidence, and as to motive, poor old Victor
  was too big a fool to have an enemy in the world."</p>

  <p>Sidney Voss, who was up for the Sheridan Club and had once been there,
  glanced respectfully across at Francis.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know something about crime and criminals, Mr. Ledsam," he
  said. "Have you any theory about the affair?"</p>

  <p>Francis set down the glass from which he had been drinking, and, folding
  up the evening paper, laid it by the side of him.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he answered calmly, "I have."</p>

  <p>The few words, simply spoken, yet in their way charged with menace,
  thrilled through the little room. Fairfax swung round upon his stool, a tall,
  aggressive-looking youth whose good-looks were half eaten up with
  dissipation. His eyes were unnaturally bright, the cloudy remains in his
  glass indicated absinthe.</p>

  <p>"Listen, you fellows!" he exclaimed. "Mr. Francis Ledsam, the great
  criminal barrister, is going to solve the mystery of poor old Victor's death
  for us!"</p>

  <p>The three other young men all turned around from the bar. Their eyes and
  whole attention seemed rivetted upon Francis. No one seemed to notice the
  newcomer who passed quietly to a chair in the background, although he was a
  person of some note and interest to all of them. Imperturbable and immaculate
  as ever, Sir Timothy Brast smiled amiably upon the little gathering, summoned
  a waiter and ordered a Dry Martini.</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely promise to do that," Francis said slowly, his eyes resting
  for a second or two upon each of the four faces. "Exact solutions are a
  little out of my line. I think I can promise to give you a shock, though, if
  you're strong enough to stand it."</p>

  <p>There was another of those curiously charged silences. The bartender
  paused with the cocktail shaker still in his hand. Voss began to beat
  nervously upon the counter with his knuckles.</p>

  <p>"We can stand anything but suspense," he declared. "Get on with your
  shock-giving."</p>

  <p>"I believe that the person responsible for the death of Victor Bidlake is
  in this room at the present moment," Francis declared.</p>

  <p>Again the silence, curious, tense and dramatic. Little Jimmy, the
  bartender, who had leaned forward to listen, stood with his mouth slightly
  open and the cocktail-shaker which was in his hand leaked drops upon the
  counter. The first conscious impulse of everybody seemed to be to glance
  suspiciously around the room. The four young men at the bar, Jimmy and one
  waiter, Francis and Sir Timothy Brast, were its only occupants.</p>

  <p>"I say, you know, that's a bit thick, isn't it?" Sidney Voss stammered at
  last. "I wasn't in the place at all, I was in Manchester, but it's a bit
  rough on these other chaps, Victor's pals."</p>

  <p>"I was dining at the Cafe Royal," Jacks declared, loudly.</p>

  <p>Morse drew a little breath.</p>

  <p>"Every one knows that I was at Brighton," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I went home directly the bar here closed," Jimmy said, in a still dazed
  tone. "I heard nothing about it till the next morning."</p>

  <p>"Alibis by the bushel," Fairfax laughed harshly. "As for me, I was doing
  my show&mdash;every one knows that. I was never in the place at all."</p>

  <p>"The murder was not committed in the place," Francis commented calmly.</p>

  <p>Fairfax slid off his stool. A spot of colour blazed in his pale cheeks,
  the glass which he was holding snapped in his fingers. He seemed suddenly
  possessed.</p>

  <p>"I say, what the hell are you getting at?" he cried. "Are you accusing
  me&mdash;or any of us Victor's pals?"</p>

  <p>"I accuse no one," Francis replied, unperturbed. "You invited a statement
  from me and I made it."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy Brast rose from his place and made his way to the end of the
  counter, next to Fairfax and nearest Francis. He addressed the former. There
  was an inscrutable smile upon his lips, his manner was reassuring.</p>

  <p>"Young gentleman," he begged, "pray do not disturb yourself. I will answer
  for it that neither you nor any of your friends are the objects of Mr.
  Leadsam's suspicion. Without a doubt, it is I to whom his somewhat bold
  statement refers."</p>

  <p>They all stared at him, immersed in another crisis, bereft of speech. He
  tapped a cigarette upon the counter and lit it. Fairfax, whose glass had just
  been refilled by the bartender, was still ghastly pale, shaking with
  nervousness and breathing hoarsely. Francis, tense and alert in his chair,
  watched the speaker but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"You see," Sir Timothy continued, addressing himself to the four young men
  at the bar, "I happen to have two special aversions in life. One is sweet
  champagne and the other amateur detectives&mdash;their stories, their methods
  and everything about them. I chanced to sit upstairs in the restaurant,
  within hearing of Mr. Ledsam and his friend Mr. Wilmore, the novelist, the
  other night, and I heard Mr. Ledsam, very much to my chagrin, announce his
  intention of abandoning a career in which he has, if he will allow me to say
  so,"&mdash;with a courteous bow to Francis&mdash;"attained considerable
  distinction, to indulge in the moth-eaten, flamboyant and melodramatic antics
  of the lesser Sherlock Holmes. I fear that I could not resist the opportunity
  of&mdash;I think you young men call it&mdash;pulling his leg."</p>

  <p>Every one was listening intently, including Shopland, who had just drifted
  into the room and subsided into a chair near Francis.</p>

  <p>"I moved my place, therefore," Sir Timothy continued, "and I whispered in
  Mr. Ledsam's ear some rodomontade to the effect that if he were planning to
  be the giant crime-detector of the world, I was by ambition the
  arch-criminal&mdash;or words to that effect. And to give emphasis to my
  words, I wound up by prophesying a crime in the immediate vicinity of the
  place within a few hours."</p>

  <p>"A somewhat significant prophecy, under the circumstances," Francis
  remarked, reaching out for a dish of salted almonds and drawing them towards
  him.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"I will confess," he admitted, "that I had not in my mind an affair of
  such dimensions. My harmless remark, however, has produced cataclysmic
  effects. The conversation to which I refer took place on the night of young
  Bidlake's murder, and Mr. Ledsam, with my somewhat, I confess, bombastic
  words in his memory, has pitched upon me as the bloodthirsty murderer."</p>

  <p>"Hold on for a moment, sir," Peter Jacks begged, wiping the perspiration
  from his forehead. "We've got to have another drink quick. Poor old Bobby
  here looks knocked all of a heap, and I'm kind of jumpy myself. You'll join
  us, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I thank you," was the courteous reply. "I do not as a rule indulge to the
  extent of more than one cocktail, but I will recognise the present as an
  exceptional occasion. To continue, then," he went on, after the glasses had
  been filled, "I have during the last few weeks experienced the ceaseless and
  lynx-eyed watch of Mr. Ledsam and presumably his myrmidons. I do not know
  whether you are all acquainted with my name, but in case you are not, let me
  introduce myself. I am Sir Timothy Brast, Chairman, as I dare say you know,
  of the United Transvaal Gold Mines, Chairman, also, of two of the principal
  hospitals in London, Vice President of the Society for the Prevention of
  Cruelty to Animals, a patron of sport in many forms, a traveller in many
  countries, and a recipient of the honour of knighthood from His Majesty, in
  recognition of my services for various philanthropic works. These facts,
  however, have availed me nothing now that the bungling amateur investigator
  into crime has pointed the finger of suspicion towards me. My servants and
  neighbours have alike been plagued to death with cunning questions as to my
  life and habits. I have been watched in the streets and watched in my
  harmless amusements. My simple life has been peered into from every
  perspective and direction. In short, I am suspect. Mr. Ledsam's terrifying
  statement a few minutes ago was directed towards me and me only."</p>

  <p>There were murmurs of sympathy from the four young men, who each in his
  own fashion appeared to derive consolation from Sir Timothy's frank and
  somewhat caustic statement. Francis, who had listened unmoved to this flow of
  words, glanced towards the door behind which dark figures seemed to be
  looming.</p>

  <p>"That is all you have to say, Sir Timothy?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>"For the present, yes," was the guarded reply. "I trust that I have
  succeeded in setting these young gentlemen's minds at ease."</p>

  <p>"There is one of them," Francis said gravely, "whose mind not even your
  soothing words could lighten."</p>

  <p>Shopland had risen unobtrusively to his feet. He laid his hand suddenly on
  Fairfax's shoulder and whispered in his ear. Fairfax, after his first start,
  seemed cool enough. He stretched out his hand towards the glass which as yet
  he had not touched; covered it with his fingers for a moment and drained its
  contents. The gently sarcastic smile left Sir Timothy's lips. His eyebrows
  met in a quick frown, his eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>A policeman in plain clothes had advanced from the door. The manager
  hovered in the background. Shopland saw that all was well.</p>

  <p>"It means," he announced, "that I have just arrested Mr. Robert Fairfax
  here on a charge of wilful murder. There is a way out through the kitchens, I
  believe. Take his other arm, Holmes. Now, gentlemen, if you please."</p>

  <p>There were a few bewildered exclamations&mdash;then a dramatic hush.
  Fairfax had fallen forward on his stool. He seemed to have relapsed into a
  comatose state. Every scrap of colour was drained from his sallow cheeks, his
  eyes were covered with a film and he was breathing heavily. The detective
  snatched up the glass from which the young man had been drinking, and smelt
  it.</p>

  <p>"I saw him drop a tablet in just now," Jimmy faltered. "I thought it was
  one of the digestion pills he uses sometimes."</p>

  <p>Shopland and the policeman placed their hands underneath the armpits of
  the unconscious man.</p>

  <p>"He's done, sir," the former whispered to Francis. "We'll try and get him
  to the station if we can."</p><a name="ch14"

  <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p>The greatest tragedies in the world, provided they happen to other people,
  have singularly little effect upon the externals of our own lives. There was
  certainly not a soul in Soto's that night who did not know that Bobby Fairfax
  had been arrested in the bar below for the murder of Victor Bidlake, had
  taken poison and died on the way to the police station. Yet the same number
  of dinners were ordered and eaten, the same quantity of wine drunk. The
  management considered that they had shown marvellous delicacy of feeling by
  restraining the orchestra from their usual musical gymnastics until after the
  service of dinner. Conversation, in consequence, buzzed louder than ever. One
  speculation in particular absorbed the attention of every single person in
  the room&mdash;why had Bobby Fairfax, at the zenith of a very successful
  career, risked the gallows and actually accepted death for the sake of
  killing Victor Bidlake, a young man with whom, so far as anybody knew, he had
  no cause of quarrel whatever? There were many theories, many people who knew
  the real facts and whispered them into a neighbour's ear, only to have them
  contradicted a few moments later. Yet, curiously enough, the two men who knew
  most about it were the two most silent men in the room, for each was dining
  alone. Francis, who had remained only in the hope that something of the sort
  might happen, was conscious of a queer sense of excitement when, with the
  service of coffee, Sir Timothy, glass in hand, moved up from a table lower
  down and with a word of apology took the vacant place by his side. It was
  what he had desired, and yet he felt a thrill almost of fear at Sir Timothy's
  murmured words. He felt that he was in the company of one who, if not an
  enemy, at any rate had no friendly feeling towards him.</p>

  <p>"My congratulations, Mr. Ledsam," Sir Timothy said quietly. "You appear to
  have started your career with a success."</p>

  <p>"Only a partial one," Francis acknowledged, "and as a matter of fact I
  deny that I have started in any new career. It was easy enough to make use of
  a fluke and direct the intelligence of others towards the right person, but
  when the real significance of the thing still eludes you, one can scarcely
  claim a triumph."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy gently knocked the ash from the very fine cigar which he was
  smoking.</p>

  <p>"Still, your groundwork was good," he observed.</p>

  <p>Francis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That," he admitted, "was due to chance."</p>

  <p>"Shall we exchange notes?" Sir Timothy suggested gently. "It might be
  interesting."</p>

  <p>"As you will," Francis assented. "There is no particular secret in the way
  I stumbled upon the truth. I was dining here that night, as you know, with
  Andrew Wilmore, and while he was ordering the dinner and talking to some
  friends, I went down to the American Bar to have a cocktail. Miss Daisy
  Hyslop and Fairfax were seated there alone and talking confidentially.
  Fairfax was insisting that Miss Hyslop should do something which puzzled her.
  She consented reluctantly, and Fairfax then hurried off to the theatre. Later
  on, Miss Hyslop and the unfortunate young man occupied a table close to ours,
  and I happened to notice that she made a point of leaving the restaurant at a
  particular time. While they were waiting in the vestibule she grew very
  impatient. I was standing behind them and I saw her glance at the clock just
  before she insisted upon her companion's going out himself to look for a
  taxicab. Ergo, one enquires at Fairfax's theatre. For that exact
  three-quarters of an hour he is off the stage. At that point my interest in
  the matter ceases. Scotland Yard was quite capable of the rest."</p>

  <p>"Disappointing," Sir Timothy murmured. "I thought at first that you were
  over-modest. I find that I was mistaken. It was chance alone which set you on
  the right track."</p>

  <p>"Well, there is my story, at any rate," Francis declared. "With how much
  of your knowledge of the affair are you going to indulge me?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy slowly revolved his brandy glass.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I will tell you this. The two young men concerned,
  Bidlake and Fairfax, were both guests of mine recently at my country house.
  They had discovered for one another a very fierce and reasonable antipathy.
  With that recurrence to primitivism with which I have always been a hearty
  sympathiser, they agreed, instead of going round their little world making
  sneering remarks about each other, to fight it out."</p>

  <p>"At your suggestion, I presume?" Francis interposed.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Sir Timothy assented. "I recommended that course, and I
  offered them facilities for bringing the matter to a crisis. The fight,
  indeed, was to have come off the day after the unfortunate episode which
  anticipated it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that you knew&mdash;" Francis began.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy checked him quietly but effectively.</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing," he said, "except this. They were neither of them young
  men of much stomach, and I knew that the one who was the greater coward would
  probably try to anticipate the matter by attacking the other first if he
  could. I knew that Fairfax was the greater coward&mdash;not that there was
  much to choose between them&mdash;and I also knew that he was the injured
  person. That is really all there is about it. My somewhat theatrical
  statement to you was based upon probability, and not upon any certain
  foreknowledge. As you see, it came off."</p>

  <p>"And the cause of their quarrel?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"There might have been a hundred reasons," Sir Timothy observed. "As a
  matter of fact, it was the eternal one. There is no need to mention a woman's
  name, so we will let it go at that."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence&mdash;a strange, unforgettable moment for
  Francis Ledsam, who seemed by some curious trick of the imagination to have
  been carried away into an impossible and grotesque world. The hum of eager
  conversation, the popping of corks, the little trills of feminine laughter,
  all blended into one sensual and not unmusical chorus, seemed to fade from
  his ears. He fancied himself in some subterranean place of vast dimensions,
  through the grim galleries of which men and women with evil faces crept like
  animals. And towering above them, unreal in size, his scornful face an
  epitome of sin, the knout which he wielded symbolical and ghastly, driving
  his motley flock with the leer of the evil shepherd, was the man from whom he
  had already learnt to recoil with horror. The picture came and went in a
  flash. Francis found himself accepting a courteously offered cigar from his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"You see, the story is very much like many others," Sir Timothy murmured,
  as he lit a fresh Cigar himself and leaned back with the obvious enjoyment of
  the cultivated smoker. "In every country of the world, the animal world as
  well as the human world, the male resents his female being taken from him.
  Directly he ceases to resent it, he becomes degenerate. Surely you must agree
  with me, Mr. Leddam?"</p>

  <p>"It comes to this, then," Francis pronounced deliberately, "that you
  stage-managed the whole affair."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is my belief, Mr. Ledsam," he said, "that you grow more and more
  intelligent every hour."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy glanced presently at his thin gold watch and put it back in
  his pocket regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he sighed, "I fear that I must tear myself away. I particularly
  want to hear the last act of 'Louise.' The new Frenchwoman sings, and my
  daughter is alone. You will excuse me."</p>

  <p>Francis nodded silently. His companion's careless words had brought a
  sudden dazzling vision into his mind. Sir Timothy scrawled his name at the
  foot of his bill.</p>

  <p>"It is one of my axioms in life, Mr. Ledsam," he continued, "that there is
  more pleasure to be derived from the society of one's enemies than one's
  friends. If I thought you sufficiently educated in the outside ways of the
  world to appreciate this, I would ask if you cared to accompany me?"</p>

  <p>Francis did not hesitate for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy," he said, "I have the greatest detestation for you, and I am
  firmly convinced that you represent all the things in life abhorrent to me.
  On the other hand, I should very much like to hear the last act of 'Louise,'
  and it would give me the greatest pleasure to meet your daughter. So long as
  there is no misunderstanding."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy laughed.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "we will get our hats. I am becoming more and more
  grateful to you, Mr. Ledsam. You are supplying something in my life which I
  have lacked. You appeal alike to my sense of humour and my imagination. We
  will visit the opera together."</p><a name="ch15"

  <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p>The two men left Soto's together, very much in the fashion of two ordinary
  acquaintances sallying out to spend the evening together. Sir Timothy's
  Rolls-Royce limousine was in attendance, and in a few minutes they were
  threading the purlieus of Covent Garden. It was here that an incident
  occurred which afforded Francis considerable food for thought during the next
  few days.</p>

  <p>It was a Friday night, and one or two waggons laden with vegetable produce
  were already threading their way through the difficult thoroughfares.
  Suddenly Sir Timothy, who was looking out of the window, pressed the button
  of the car, which was at once brought to a standstill. Before the footman
  could reach the door Sir Timothy was out in the street. For the first time
  Francis saw him angry. His eyes were blazing. His voice&mdash;Francis had
  followed him at once into the street&mdash;shook with passion. His hand had
  fallen heavily upon the shoulder of a huge carter, who, with whip in hand,
  was belabouring a thin scarecrow of a horse.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you doing?" Sir Timothy demanded.</p>

  <p>The man stared at his questioner, and the instinctive antagonism of race
  vibrated in his truculent reply. The carter was a beery-faced, untidy-looking
  brute, but powerfully built and with huge shoulders. Sir Timothy, straight as
  a dart, without overcoat or any covering to his thin evening clothes, looked
  like a stripling in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I'm whippin' 'er, if yer want to know," was the carter's reply. "I've got
  to get up the 'ill, 'aven't I? Garn and mind yer own business!"</p>

  <p>"This is my business," Sir Timothy declared, laying his hand upon the neck
  of the horse. "I am an official of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
  to Animals. You are laying yourself open to a fine for your treatment of this
  poor brute."</p>

  <p>"I'll lay myself open for a fine for the treatment of something else, if
  you don't quid 'old of my 'oss," the carter retorted, throwing his whip back
  into the waggon and coming a step nearer. "D'yer 'ear? I don't want any
  swells interferin' with my business. You 'op it. Is that strite enough? 'Op
  it, quick!"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy's anger seemed to have abated. There was even the beginning of
  a smile upon his lips. All the time his hand caressed the neck of the horse.
  Francis noticed with amazement that the poor brute had raised his head and
  seemed to be making some faint effort at reciprocation.</p>

  <p>"My good man," Sir Timothy said, "you seem to be one of those brutal
  persons unfit to be trusted with an animal. However&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The carter had heard quite enough. Sir Timothy's tone seemed to madden
  him. He clenched his fist and rushed in.</p>

  <p>"You take that for interferin', you big toff!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>The result of the man's effort at pugilism was almost ridiculous. His arms
  appeared to go round like windmills beating the air. It really seemed as
  though he had rushed upon the point of Sir Timothy's knuckles, which had
  suddenly shot out like the piston of an engine. The carter lay on his back
  for a moment. Then he staggered viciously to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Don't," Sir Timothy begged, as he saw signs of another attack. "I don't
  want to hurt you. I have been amateur champion of two countries. Not quite
  fair, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Wot d'yer want to come interferin' with a chap's business for?" the man
  growled, dabbing his cheek with a filthy handkerchief but keeping at a
  respectful distance.</p>

  <p>"It happens to be my business also," Sir Timothy replied, "to interfere
  whenever I see animals ill-treated. Now I don't want to be unreasonable. That
  animal has done all the work it ought to do in this world. How much is she
  worth to you?"</p>

  <p>Through the man's beer-clogged brain a gleam of cunning began to find its
  way. He looked at the Rolls-Royce, with the two motionless servants on the
  box, at Francis standing by, at Sir Timothy, even to his thick understanding
  the very prototype of a "toff."</p>

  <p>"That 'oss," he said, "ain't what she was, it's true, but there's a lot of
  work in 'er yet. She may not be much to look at but she's worth forty quid to
  me&mdash;ay, and one to spit on!"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy counted out some notes from the pocketbook which he had
  produced, and handed them to the man.</p>

  <p>"Here are fifty pounds," he said. "The mare is mine. Johnson!"</p>

  <p>The second man sprang from his seat and came round.</p>

  <p>"Unharness that mare," his master ordered, "help the man push his trolley
  back out of the way, then lead the animal to the mews in Curzon Street. See
  that she is well bedded down and has a good feed of corn. To-morrow I shall
  send her down to the country, but I will come and have a look at her
  first."</p>

  <p>The man touched his hat and hastened to commence his task. The carter, who
  had been busy counting the notes, thrust them into his pocket with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Good luck to yer, guvnor!" he shouted out, in valedictory fashion. "'Ope
  I meets yer again when I've an old crock on the go."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy turned his head.</p>

  <p>"If ever I happen to meet you, my good man," he threatened, "using your
  whip upon a poor beast who's doing his best, I promise you you won't get up
  in two minutes, or twenty.... We might walk the last few yards, Mr.
  Ledsam."</p>

  <p>The latter acquiesced at once, and in a moment or two they were underneath
  the portico of the Opera House. Sir Timothy had begun to talk about the opera
  but Francis was a little distrait. His companion glanced at him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"You are puzzled, Mr. Ledsam?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Very," was the prompt response.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are one of these primitive Anglo-Saxons," he said, "who can see the
  simple things with big eyes, but who are terribly worried at an unfamiliar
  constituent. You have summed me up in your mind as a hardened brute, a
  criminal by predilection, a patron of murderers. Ergo, you ask yourself why
  should I trouble to save a poor beast of a horse from being chastised, and go
  out of my way to provide her with a safe asylum for the rest of her life?
  Shall I help you, Mr. Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," Francis confessed.</p>

  <p>They had passed now through the entrance to the Opera House and were in
  the corridor leading to the grand tier boxes. On every side Sir Timothy had
  been received with marks of deep respect. Two bowing attendants were
  preceding them. Sir Timothy leaned towards his companion.</p>

  <p>"Because," he whispered, "I like animals better than human beings."</p>

  <p>Margaret Hilditch, her chair pushed back into the recesses of the box,
  scarcely turned her head at her father's entrance.</p>

  <p>"I have brought an acquaintance of yours, Margaret," the latter announced,
  as he hung up his hat. "You remember Mr. Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>Francis drew a little breath of relief as he bowed over her hand. For the
  second time her inordinate composure had been assailed. She was her usual
  calm and indifferent self almost immediately, but the gleam of surprise, and
  he fancied not unpleasant surprise, had been unmistakable.</p>

  <p>"Are you a devotee, Mr. Ledsam?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am fond of music," Francis answered, "especially this opera."</p>

  <p>She motioned to the chair in the front of the box, facing the stage.</p>

  <p>"You must sit there," she insisted. "I prefer always to remain here, and
  my father always likes to face the audience. I really believe," she went on,
  "that he likes to catch the eye of the journalist who writes little gossipy
  items, and to see his name in print."</p>

  <p>"But you yourself?" Francis ventured.</p>

  <p>"I fancy that my reasons for preferring seclusion should be obvious
  enough," she replied, a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>"My daughter is inclined, I fear, to be a little morbid," Sir Timothy
  said, settling down in his place.</p>

  <p>Francis made no reply. A triangular conversation of this sort was almost
  impossible. The members of the orchestra were already climbing up to their
  places, in preparation for the overture to the last act. Sir Timothy rose to
  his feet.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me for a moment," he begged. "I see a lady to whom I must
  pay my respects."</p>

  <p>Francis drew a sigh of relief at his departure. He turned at once to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Did you mind my coming?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mind it?" she repeated, with almost insolent nonchalance. "Why should it
  affect me in any way? My father's friends come and go. I have no interest in
  any of them."</p>

  <p>"But," he protested, "I want you to be interested in me."</p>

  <p>She moved a little uneasily in her place. Her tone, nevertheless, remained
  icy.</p>

  <p>"Could you possibly manage to avoid personalities in your conversation,
  Mr. Ledsam?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"I have tried already to tell you how I feel about such things."</p>

  <p>She was certainly difficult. Francis realised that with a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"Were you surprised to see me with your father?" he asked, a little
  inanely.</p>

  <p>"I cannot conceive what you two have found in common," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps our interest in you," he replied. "By-the-bye, I have just seen
  him perform a quixotic but a very fine action," Francis said. "He stopped a
  carter from thrashing his horse; knocked him down, bought the horse from him
  and sent it home."</p>

  <p>She was mildly interested.</p>

  <p>"An amiable side of my father's character which no one would suspect," she
  remarked. "The entire park of his country house at Hatch End is given over to
  broken-down animals."</p>

  <p>"I am one of those," he confessed, "who find this trait amazing."</p>

  <p>"And I am another," she remarked coolly. "If any one settled down
  seriously to try and understand my father, he would need the spectacles of a
  De Quincey, the outlook of a Voltaire, and the callousness of a Borgia. You
  see, he doesn't lend himself to any of the recognised standards."</p>

  <p>"Neither do you," he said boldly.</p>

  <p>She looked away from him across the House, to where Sir Timothy was
  talking to a man and woman in one of the ground-floor boxes. Francis
  recognised them with some surprise&mdash;an agricultural Duke and his
  daughter, Lady Cynthia Milton, one of the most, beautiful and famous young
  women in London.</p>

  <p>"Your father goes far afield for his friends," Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"My father has no friends," she replied. "He has many acquaintances. I
  doubt whether he has a single confidant. I expect Cynthia is trying to
  persuade him to invite her to his next party at The Walled House."</p>

  <p>"I should think she would fail, won't she?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why should you think that?"</p>

  <p>Francis shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"Your father's entertainments have the reputation of being somewhat
  unique," he remarked. "You do not, by-the-bye, attend them yourself."</p>

  <p>"You must remember that I have had very few opportunities so far," she
  observed. "Besides, Cynthia has tastes which I do not share."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"She goes to the National Sporting Club. She once travelled, I know, over
  a hundred miles to go to a bull fight."</p>

  <p>"On the whole," Francis said, "I am glad that you do not share her
  tastes."</p>

  <p>"You know her?" Margaret enquired.</p>

  <p>"Indifferently well," Francis replied. "I knew her when she was a child,
  and we seem to come together every now and then at long intervals. As a
  debutante she was charming. Lately it seems to me that she has got into the
  wrong set."</p>

  <p>"What do you call the wrong set?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Please don't think that I am laying down the law," he said. "I have been
  out so little, the last few years, that I ought not, perhaps, to criticise.
  Lady Cynthia, however, seems to me to belong to the extreme section of the
  younger generation, the section who have a sort of craze for the unusual,
  whose taste in art and living is distorted and bizarre. You know what I mean,
  don't you&mdash;black drawing-rooms, futurist wall-papers, opium dens and a
  cocaine box! It's to some extent affectation, of course, but it's a folly
  that claims its victims."</p>

  <p>She studied him for a moment attentively. His leanness was the leanness of
  muscular strength and condition, his face was full of vigour and
  determination.</p>

  <p>"You at least have escaped the abnormal," she remarked. "I am not quite
  sure how the entertainments at The Walled House would appeal to you, but if
  my father should invite you there, I should advise you not to go."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know why I should trouble to give you advice," she said.
  "As a matter of fact, I don't care whether you go or not. In any case, you
  are scarcely likely to be asked."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I agree with you," he protested. "Your father seems to
  have taken quite a fancy to me."</p>

  <p>"And you?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Well, I like the way he bought that horse," Francis admitted. "And I am
  beginning to realise that there may be something in the theory which he
  advanced when he invited me to accompany him here this evening&mdash;that
  there is a certain piquancy in one's intercourse with an enemy, which
  friendship lacks. There may be complexities in his character which as yet I
  have not appreciated."</p>

  <p>The curtain had gone up and the last act of the opera had commenced. She
  leaned back in her chair. Without a word or even a gesture, he understood
  that a curtain had been let down between them. He obeyed her unspoken wish
  and relapsed into silence. Her very absorption, after all, was a hopeful
  sign. She would have him believe that she felt nothing, that she was living
  outside all the passion and sentiment of life. Yet she was absorbed in the
  music.... Sir Timothy came back and seated himself silently. It was not until
  the tumult of applause which broke out after the great song of the French
  ouvrier, that a word passed between them.</p>

  <p>"Cavalisti is better," Sir Timothy commented. "This man has not the
  breadth of passion. At times he is merely peevish."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Cavalisti would be too egotistical for the part," she said quietly. "It
  is difficult."</p>

  <p>Not another word was spoken until the curtain fell. Francis lingered for a
  moment over the arrangement of her cloak. Sir Timothy was already outside,
  talking to some acquaintances.</p>

  <p>"It has been a great pleasure to see you like this unexpectedly," he said,
  a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine why," she answered, with an undernote of trouble in her
  tone. "Remember the advice I gave you before. No good can come of any
  friendship between my father and you."</p>

  <p>"There is this much of good in it, at any rate," he answered, as he held
  open the door for her. "It might give me the chance of seeing you
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"That is not a matter worth considering," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I find it very much worth considering," he whispered, losing his head for
  a moment as they stood close together in the dim light of the box, and a
  sudden sense of the sweetness of her thrilled his pulses. "There isn't
  anything in the world I want so much as to see you oftener&mdash;to have my
  chance."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary glow in her eyes. Her lips quivered. The few words
  which he saw framed there&mdash;he fancied of reproof&mdash;remained
  unspoken. Sir Timothy was waiting for them at the entrance.</p>

  <p>"I have been asking Mrs. Hilditch's permission to call in Curzon Street,"
  Francis said boldly.</p>

  <p>"I am sure my daughter will be delighted," was the cold but courteous
  reply.</p>

  <p>Margaret herself made no comment. The car drew up and she stepped into
  it&mdash;a tall, slim figure, wonderfully graceful in her unrelieved black,
  her hair gleaming as though with some sort of burnish, as she passed
  underneath the electric light. She looked back at him with a smile of
  farewell as he stood bareheaded upon the steps, a smile which reminded him
  somehow of her father, a little sardonic, a little tender, having in it some
  faintly challenging quality. The car rolled away. People around were
  gossiping&mdash;rather freely.</p>

  <p>"The wife of that man Oliver Hilditch," he heard a woman say, "the man who
  was tried for murder, and committed suicide the night after his acquittal.
  Why, that can't be much more than three months ago."</p>

  <p>"If you are the daughter of a millionaire," her escort observed, "you can
  defy convention."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was Sir Timothy Brast," another man was saying. "He's supposed
  to be worth a cool five millions."</p>

  <p>"If the truth about him were known," his companion confided, dropping his
  voice, "it would cost him all that to keep out of the Old Bailey. They say
  that his orgies at Hatch End&mdash;Our taxi. Come on, Sharpe."</p>

  <p>Francis strolled thoughtfully homewards.</p><a name="ch16"

  <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p>Francis Ledsam was himself again, the lightest-hearted and most popular
  member of his club, still a brilliant figure in the courts, although his
  appearances there were less frequent, still devoting the greater portion of
  his time, to his profession, although his work in connection with it had
  become less spectacular. One morning, at the corner of Clarges Street and
  Curzon Street, about three weeks after his visit to the Opera, he came face
  to face with Sir Timothy Brast.</p>

  <p>"Well, my altruistic peerer into other people's affairs, how goes it?" the
  latter enquired pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"How does it seem, my arch-criminal, to be still breathing God's fresh
  air?" Francis retorted in the same vein. "Make the most of it. It may not
  last for ever."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled. He was looking exceedingly well that morning, the very
  prototype of a man contented with life and his part in it. He was wearing a
  morning coat and silk hat, his patent boots were faultlessly polished, his
  trousers pressed to perfection, his grey silk tie neat and fashionable.
  Notwithstanding his waxenlike pallor, his slim figure and lithe, athletic
  walk seemed to speak of good health.</p>

  <p>"You may catch the minnow," he murmured. "The big fish swim on.
  By-the-bye," he added, "I do not notice that your sledge-hammer blows at
  crime are having much effect. Two undetected murders last week, and one the
  week before. What are you about, my astute friend?"</p>

  <p>"Those are matters for Scotland Yard," Francis replied, with an
  indifferent little wave of the hand which held his cigarette. "Details are
  for the professional. I seek that corner in Hell where the thunders are
  welded and the poison gases mixed. In other words, I seek for the brains of
  crime."</p>

  <p>"Believe me, we do not see enough of one another, my young friend," Sir
  Timothy said earnestly. "You interest me more and more every time we meet. I
  like your allegories, I like your confidence, which in any one except a
  genius would seem blatant. When can we dine together and talk about
  crime?"</p>

  <p>"The sooner the better," Francis replied promptly. "Invite me, and I will
  cancel any other engagement I might happen to have."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy considered for a moment. The June sunshine was streaming down
  upon them and the atmosphere was a little oppressive.</p>

  <p>"Will you dine with me at Hatch End to-night?" he asked. "My daughter and
  I will be alone."</p>

  <p>"I should be delighted," Francis replied promptly. "I ought to tell you,
  perhaps, that I have called three times upon your daughter but have not been
  fortunate enough to find her at home."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy was politely apologetic.</p>

  <p>"I fear that my daughter is a little inclined to be morbid," he confessed.
  "Society is good for her. I will undertake that you are a welcome guest."</p>

  <p>"At what time do I come and how shall I find your house?" Francis
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"You motor down, I suppose?" Sir Timothy observed. "Good! In Hatch End any
  one will direct you. We dine at eight. You had better come down as soon as
  you have finished your day's work. Bring a suitcase and spend the night."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," Francis replied.</p>

  <p>"Do not," Sir Timothy continued, "court disappointment by
  over-anticipation. You have without doubt heard of my little gatherings at
  Hatch End. They are viewed, I am told, with grave suspicion, alike by the
  moralists of the City and, I fear, the police. I am not inviting you to one
  of those gatherings. They are for people with other tastes. My daughter and I
  have been spending a few days alone in the little bungalow by the side of my
  larger house. That is where you will find us&mdash;The Sanctuary, we call
  it."</p>

  <p>"Some day," Francis ventured, "I shall hope to be asked to one of your
  more notorious gatherings. For the present occasion I much prefer the
  entertainment you offer."</p>

  <p>"Then we are both content," Sir Timothy said, smiling. "Au revoir!"</p>

  <p>Francis walked across Green Park, along the Mall, down Horse Guards
  Parade, along the Embankment to his rooms on the fringe of the Temple. Here
  he found his clerk awaiting his arrival in some disturbance of spirit.</p>

  <p>"There is a young gentleman here to see you, sir," he announced. "Mr.
  Reginald Wilmore his name is, I think."</p>

  <p>"Wilmore?" Francis repeated. "What have you done with him?"</p>

  <p>"He is in your room, sir. He seems very impatient. He has been out two or
  three times to know how long I thought you would be."</p>

  <p>Francis passed down the stone passage and entered his room, a large, shady
  apartment at the back of the building. To his surprise it was empty. He was
  on the point of calling to his clerk when he saw that the writing-paper on
  his desk had been disturbed. He went over and read a few lines written in a
  boy's hasty writing:</p>

  <p>DEAR Mr. LEDSAM:</p>

  <p>I am in a very strange predicament and I have come to ask your advice. You
  know my brother Andrew well, and you may remember playing tennis with me last
  year. I am compelled&mdash;</p>

  <p>At that point the letter terminated abruptly. There was a blot and a
  smudge. The pen lay where it seemed to have rolled&mdash;on the floor. The
  ink was not yet dry. Francis called to his clerk.</p>

  <p>"Angrave," he said, "Mr. Wilmore is not here."</p>

  <p>The clerk looked around in obvious surprise.</p>

  <p>"It isn't five minutes since he came out to my office, sir!" he exclaimed.
  "I heard him go back again afterwards."</p>

  <p>Francis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he decided not to wait and you didn't hear him go by."</p>

  <p>Angrave shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not see how he could have left the place without my hearing him,
  sir," he declared. "The door of my office has been open all the time, and I
  sit opposite to it. Besides, on these stone floors one can hear any one so
  distinctly."</p>

  <p>"Then what," Francis asked, "has become of him?"</p>

  <p>The clerk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any idea, sir," he confessed.</p>

  <p>Francis plunged into his work and forgot all about the matter. He was
  reminded of it, however, at luncheon-time, when, on entering the dining-room
  of the club, he saw Andrew Wilmore seated alone at one of the small tables
  near the wall. He went over to him at once.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Andrew," he greeted him, "what are you doing here by
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Bit hipped, old fellow," was the depressed reply. "Sit down, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>Francis sat down and ordered his lunch.</p>

  <p>"By-the-bye," he said, "I had rather a mysterious visit this morning from
  your brother Reggie."</p>

  <p>Wilmore stared at him for a moment, half in relief, half in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Francis, you don't say so!" he exclaimed. "How was he? What did
  he want? Tell me about it at once? We've been worried to death about the
  boy."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't see him," Francis explained. "He
  arrived before I reached my rooms&mdash;as you know, I don't live
  there&mdash;waited some time, began to write me this note,"&mdash;drawing the
  sheet of paper from his pocket&mdash;"and when I got there had disappeared
  without leaving a message or anything."</p>

  <p>Wilmore adjusted his pince nez with trembling fingers. Then he read the
  few lines through.</p>

  <p>"Francis," he said, when he had finished them, "do you know that this is
  the first word we've heard of him for three days?"</p>

  <p>"Great heavens!" Francis exclaimed. "He was living with his mother, wasn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Down at Kensington, but he hasn't been there since Monday," Andrew
  replied. "His mother is in a terrible state. And now this, I don't understand
  it at all."</p>

  <p>"Was the boy hard up?"</p>

  <p>"Not more than most young fellows are," was the puzzled reply. "His
  allowance was due in a few days, too. He had money in the bank, I feel sure.
  He was saving up for a motorcar."</p>

  <p>"Haven't I seen him once or twice at restaurants lately?" Francis
  enquired. "Soto's, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely," his brother assented. "Why not? He's fond of dancing, and
  we none of us ever encouraged him to be a stay-at-home."</p>

  <p>"Any particular girl was he interested in?"</p>

  <p>"Not that we know of. Like most young fellows of his age, he was rather
  keen on young women with some connection with the stage, but I don't believe
  there was any one in particular. Reggie was too fond of games to waste much
  time that way. He's at the gymnasium three evenings a week."</p>

  <p>"I wish I'd been at the office a few minutes earlier this morning,"
  Francis observed. "I tell you what, Andrew. I have some pals down at Scotland
  Yard, and I'll go down and see them this afternoon. They'll want a
  photograph, and to ask a few questions, I dare say, but I shouldn't talk
  about the matter too much."</p>

  <p>"You're very kind, Francis," his friend replied, "but it isn't so easy to
  sit tight. I was going to the police myself this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Take my advice and leave it to me," Francis begged. "I have a particular
  pal down at Scotland Yard who I know will be interested, and I want him to
  take up the case."</p>

  <p>"You haven't any theory, I suppose?" Wilmore asked, a little
  wistfully.</p>

  <p>Francis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not the ghost of one," he admitted. "The reason I am advising you to keep
  as quiet as possible, though, is just this. If you create a lot of interest
  in a disappearance, you have to satisfy the public curiosity when the mystery
  is solved."</p>

  <p>"I see," Wilmore murmured. "All the same, I can't imagine Reggie getting
  mixed up in anything discreditable."</p>

  <p>"Neither can I, from what I remember of the boy," Francis agreed. "Let me
  see, what was he doing in the City?"</p>

  <p>"He was with Jameson &amp; Scott, the stockbrokers," Wilmore replied. "He
  was only learning the business and he had no responsibilities. Curiously
  enough, though, when I went to see Mr. Jameson he pointed out one or two
  little matters that Reggie had attended to, which looked as though he were
  clearing up, somehow or other."</p>

  <p>"He left no message there, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not a line or a word. He gave the porter five shillings, though, on the
  afternoon before he disappeared&mdash;a man who has done some odd jobs for
  him."</p>

  <p>"Well, a voluntary disappearance is better than an involuntary one,"
  Francis remarked. "What was his usual programme when he left the office?"</p>

  <p>"He either went to Queen's and played racquets, or he went straight to his
  gymnasium in the Holborn. I telephoned to Queen's. He didn't call there on
  the Wednesday night, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Where's the gymnasium?"</p>

  <p>"At 147 a Holborn. A lot of city young men go there late in the evening,
  but Reggie got off earlier than most of them and used to have the place
  pretty well to himself. I think that's why he stuck to it."</p>

  <p>Francis made a note of the address.</p>

  <p>"I'll get Shopland to step down there some time," he said. "Or better
  still, finish your lunch and we'll take a taxi there ourselves. I'm going to
  the country later on, but I've half-an-hour to spare. We can go without our
  coffee and be there in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"A great idea," Wilmore acquiesced. "It's probably the last place Reggie
  visited, anyway."</p><a name="ch17"

  <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p>The gymnasium itself was a source of immense surprise to both Francis and
  Wilmore. It stretched along the entire top storey of a long block of
  buildings, and was elaborately fitted with bathrooms, a restaurant and a
  reading-room. The trapezes, bars, and all the usual appointments were of the
  best possible quality. The manager, a powerful-looking man dressed with the
  precision of the prosperous city magnate, came out of his office to greet
  them.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, gentlemen?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"First of all," Francis replied, "accept our heartiest congratulations
  upon your wonderful gymnasium."</p>

  <p>The man bowed.</p>

  <p>"It is the best appointed in the country, sir," he said proudly.
  "Absolutely no expense has been spared in fitting it up. Every one of our
  appliances is of the latest possible description, and our bathrooms are an
  exact copy of those in a famous Philadelphia club."</p>

  <p>"What is the subscription?" Wilmore asked.</p>

  <p>"Five shillings a year."</p>

  <p>"And how many members?"</p>

  <p>"Two thousand."</p>

  <p>The manager smiled as he saw his two visitors exchange puzzled
  glances.</p>

  <p>"Needless to say, sir," he added, "we are not self-supporting. We have
  very generous patrons."</p>

  <p>"I lave heard my brother speak of this place as being quite wonderful,"
  Wilmore remarked, "but I had no idea that it was upon this scale."</p>

  <p>"Is your brother a member?" the man asked.</p>

  <p>"He is. To tell you the truth, we came here to ask you a question about
  him."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"Reginald Wilmore. He was here, I think, last Wednesday night."</p>

  <p>While Wilmore talked, Francis watched. He was conscious of a curious
  change in the man's deportment at the mention of Reginald Wilmore's name.
  From being full of bumptious, almost condescending good-nature, his
  expression had changed into one of stony incivility. There was something
  almost sinister in the tightly-closed lips and the suspicious gleam in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"What questions did you wish to ask?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Reginald Wilmore has disappeared," Francis explained simply. "He came
  here on leaving the office last Monday. He has not been seen or heard of
  since."</p>

  <p>"Well?" the manager asked.</p>

  <p>"We came to ask whether you happen to remember his being here on that
  evening, and whether he gave any one here any indication of his future
  movements. We thought, perhaps, that the instructor who was with him might
  have some information."</p>

  <p>"Not a chance," was the uncompromising reply. "I remember Mr. Wilmore
  being here perfectly. He was doing double turns on the high bar. I saw more
  of him myself than any one. I was with him when he went down to have his
  swim."</p>

  <p>"Did he seem in his usual spirits?" Wilmore ventured.</p>

  <p>"I don't notice what spirits my pupils are in," the man answered, a little
  insolently. "There was nothing the matter with him so far as I know."</p>

  <p>"He didn't say anything about going away?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. You'll excuse me, gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment," Francis interrupted. "We came here ourselves sooner than
  send a detective. Enquiries are bound to be made as to the young man's
  disappearance, and we have reason to know that this is the last place at
  which he was heard of. It is not unreasonable, therefore, is it, that we
  should come to you for information?"</p>

  <p>"Reasonable or unreasonable, I haven't got any," the man declared gruffly.
  "If Mr. Wilmore's cleared out, he's cleared out for some reason of his own.
  It's not my business and I don't know anything about it."</p>

  <p>"You understand," Francis persisted, "that our interest in young Mr.
  Wilmore is entirely a friendly one?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether it's friendly or unfriendly. I tell you I don't know
  anything about him. And," he added, pressing his thumb upon the button for
  the lift, "I'll wish you two gentlemen good afternoon. I've business to
  attend to."</p>

  <p>Francis looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I seen you somewhere before?" he asked, a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I can't say. My name is John Maclane."</p>

  <p>"Heavy-weight champion about seven years ago?"</p>

  <p>"I was," the man acknowledged. "You may have seen me in the ring. Now,
  gentlemen, if you please."</p>

  <p>The lift had stopped opposite to them. The manager's gesture of dismissal
  was final.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Mr. Maclane, if we have annoyed you with our questions,"
  Francis said. "I wish you could remember a little more of Mr. Wilmore's last
  visit."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't, and that's all there is to it," was the blunt reply. "As
  to being annoyed, I am only annoyed when my time's wasted. Take these gents
  down, Jim. Good afternoon!"</p>

  <p>The door was slammed to and they shot downwards. Francis turned to the
  lift man.</p>

  <p>"Do you know a Mr. Wilmore who comes here sometimes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not likely!" the man scoffed. "They're comin' and goin' all the time from
  four o'clock in the afternoon till eleven at night. If I heard a name I
  shouldn't remember it. This way out, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Wilmore's hand was in his pocket but the man turned deliberately away.
  They walked out into the street.</p>

  <p>"For downright incivility," the former observed, "commend me to the
  attendants of a young men's gymnasium!"</p>

  <p>Francis smiled.</p>

  <p>"All the same, old fellow," he said, "if you worry for another five
  minutes about Reggie, you're an ass."</p>

  <p>At six o'clock that evening Francis turned his two-seater into a winding
  drive bordered with rhododendrons, and pulled up before the porch of a
  charming two-storied bungalow, covered with creepers, and with French-windows
  opening from every room onto the lawns. A man-servant who had heard the
  approach of the car was already standing in the porch. Sir Timothy, in white
  flannels and a panama hat, strolled across the lawn to greet his approaching
  guest.</p>

  <p>"Excellently timed, my young friend," he said. "You will have time for
  your first cocktail before you change. My daughter you know, of course. Lady
  Cynthia Milton I think you also know."</p>

  <p>Francis shook hands with the two girls who were lying under the cedar
  tree. Margaret Hilditch seemed to him more wonderful than ever in her white
  serge boating clothes. Lady Cynthia, who had apparently just arrived from
  some function in town, was still wearing muslin and a large hat.</p>

  <p>"I am always afraid that Mr. Ledsam will have forgotten me," she observed,
  as she gave him her hand. "The last time I met you was at the Old Bailey,
  when you had been cheating the gallows of a very respectable wife murderer.
  Poynings, I think his name was."</p>

  <p>"I remember it perfectly," Francis assented. "We danced together that
  night, I remember, at your aunt's, Mrs. Malcolm's, and you were intensely
  curious to know how Poynings had spent his evening."</p>

  <p>"Lady Cynthia's reminder is perhaps a little unfortunate," Sir Timothy
  observed. "Mr. Ledsam is no longer the last hope of the enterprising
  criminal. He has turned over a new leaf. To secure the services of his silver
  tongue, you have to lay at his feet no longer the bags of gold from your
  ill-gotten gains but the white flower of the blameless life."</p>

  <p>"This is all in the worst possible taste," Margaret Hilditch declared, in
  her cold, expressionless tone. "You might consider my feelings."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia only laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Margaret," she said, "if I thought that you had any, I should
  never believe that you were your father's daughter. Here's to them, anyway,"
  she added, accepting the cocktail from the tray which the butler had just
  brought out. "Mr. Ledsam, are you going to attach yourself to me, or has
  Margaret annexed you?"</p>

  <p>"I have offered myself to Mrs. Hilditch," Francis rejoined promptly, "but
  so far I have made no impression."</p>

  <p>"Try her with a punt and a concertina after dinner," Lady Cynthia
  suggested. "After all, I came down here to better my acquaintance with my
  host. You flirted with me disgracefully when I was a debutante, and have
  never taken any notice of me since. I hate infidelity in a man. Sir Timothy,
  I shall devote myself to you. Can you play a concertina?"</p>

  <p>"Where the higher forms of music are concerned," he replied, "I have no
  technical ability. I should prefer to sit at your feet."</p>

  <p>"While I punt, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"There are backwaters," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia sipped her cocktail appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how it is," she observed, "that in these days, although we have
  become callous to everything else in life, cocktails and flirtations still
  attract us. You shall take me to a backwater after dinner, Sir Timothy. I
  shall wear my silver-grey and take an armful of those black cushions from the
  drawing-room. In that half light, there is no telling what success I may not
  achieve."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy sighed.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he said, "before dinner is over you will probably have changed
  your mind."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," she admitted, "but you must remember that Mr. Ledsam is my
  only alternative, and I am not at all sure that he likes me. I am not
  sufficiently Victorian for his taste."</p>

  <p>The dressing-bell rang. Sir Timothy passed his arm through Francis'.</p>

  <p>"The sentimental side of my domain;" he said, "the others may show you. My
  rose garden across the stream has been very much admired. I am now going to
  give you a glimpse of The Walled House, an edifice the possession of which
  has made me more or less famous."</p>

  <p>He led the way through a little shrubbery, across a further strip of
  garden and through a door in a high wall, which he opened with a key attached
  to his watch-chain. They were in an open park now, studded with magnificent
  trees, in the further corner of which stood an imposing mansion, with a great
  domed roof in the centre, and broad stone terraces, one of which led down to
  the river. The house itself was an amazingly blended mixture of old and new,
  with great wings supported by pillars thrown out on either side. It seemed to
  have been built without regard to any definite period of architecture, and
  yet to have attained a certain coherency&mdash;a far-reaching structure, with
  long lines of outbuildings. In the park itself were a score or more of
  horses, and in the distance beyond a long line of loose boxes with open
  doors. Even as they stood there, a grey sorrel mare had trotted up to their
  side and laid her head against Sir Timothy's shoulder. He caressed her
  surreptitiously, affecting not to notice the approach of other animals from
  all quarters.</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce you to The Walled House," its owner observed, "so
  called, I imagine, because this wall, which is a great deal older than you or
  I, completely encloses the estate. Of course, you remember the old house, The
  Walled Palace, they called it? It belonged for many years to the Lynton
  family, and afterwards to the Crown."</p>

  <p>"I remember reading of your purchase," Francis said, "and of course I
  remember the old mansion. You seem to have wiped it out pretty
  effectually."</p>

  <p>"I was obliged to play the vandal," his host confessed. "In its previous
  state, the house was picturesque but uninhabitable. As you see it now, it is
  an exact reproduction of the country home of one of the lesser known of the
  Borgias&mdash;Sodina, I believe the lady's name was. You will find inside
  some beautiful arches, and a sense of space which all modern houses lack. It
  cost me a great deal of money, and it is inhabited, when I am in Europe,
  about once a fortnight. You know the river name for it? 'Timothy's
  Folly!"'</p>

  <p>"But what on earth made you build it, so long as you don't care to live
  there?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Well," he explained, "I like sometimes to entertain, and I like to
  entertain, when I do, on a grand scale. In London, if I give a party, the
  invitations are almost automatic. I become there a very insignificant link in
  the chain of what is known as Society, and Society practically helps itself
  to my entertainment, and sees that everything is done according to rule. Down
  here things are entirely different. An invitation to The Walled House is a
  personal matter. Society has nothing whatever to do with my functions here.
  The reception-rooms, too, are arranged according to my own ideas. I have, as
  you may have heard, the finest private gymnasium in England. The ballroom and
  music-room and private theatre, too, are famous."</p>

  <p>"And do you mean to say that you keep that huge place empty?" Francis
  asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I have a suite of rooms there which I occasionally occupy," Sir Timothy
  replied, "and there are always thirty or forty servants and attendants of
  different sorts who have their quarters there. I suppose that my daughter and
  I would be there at the present moment but for the fact that we own this
  cottage. Both she and I, for residential purposes, prefer the atmosphere
  there."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely wonder at it," Francis agreed.</p>

  <p>They were surrounded now by various quadrupeds. As well as the horses,
  half-a-dozen of which were standing patiently by Sir Timothy's side, several
  dogs had made their appearance and after a little preliminary enthusiasm had
  settled down at his feet. He leaned over and whispered something in the ear
  of the mare who had come first. She trotted off, and the others followed suit
  in a curious little procession. Sir Timothy watched them, keeping his head
  turned away from Francis.</p>

  <p>"You recognise the mare the third from the end?" he pointed out. "That is
  the animal I bought in Covent Garden. You see how she has filled out?"</p>

  <p>"I should never have recognised her," the other confessed.</p>

  <p>"Even Nero had his weaknesses," Sir Timothy remarked, waving the dogs
  away. "My animals' quarters are well worth a visit, if you have time. There
  is a small hospital, too, which is quite up to date."</p>

  <p>"Do any of the horses work at all?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a very human thing about my favourites," he said. "In the
  gardens on the other side of the house we have very extensive lawns, and my
  head groom thought he would make use of one of a my horses who had recovered
  from a serious accident and was really quite a strong beast, for one of the
  machines. He found the idea quite a success, and now he no sooner appears in
  the park with a halter than, instead of stampeding, practically every one of
  those horses comes cantering up with the true volunteering spirit. The one
  which he selects, arches his neck and goes off to work with a whole string of
  the others following. Dodsley&mdash;that is my groom's name&mdash;tells me
  that he does a great deal more mowing now than he need, simply because they
  worry him for the work. Gratitude, you see, Mr. Ledsam, sheer gratitude. If
  you were to provide a dozen alms-houses for your poor dependants, I wonder
  how many of them would be anxious to mow your lawn.... Come, let me show you
  your room now."</p>

  <p>They passed back through the postern-gate into the gardens of The
  Sanctuary. Sir Timothy led the way towards the house.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you decided to spend the night, Mr. Ledsam," he said. "The
  river sounds a terribly hackneyed place to the Londoner, but it has beauties
  which only those who live with it can discover. Mind your head. My ceilings
  are low."</p>

  <p>Francis followed his host along many passages, up and down stairs, until
  he reached a little suite of rooms at the extreme end of the building. The
  man-servant who had unpacked his bag stood waiting. Sir Timothy glanced
  around critically.</p>

  <p>"Small but compact," he remarked. "There is a little sitting-room down
  that stair, and a bathroom beyond. If the flowers annoy you, throw them out
  of the window. And if you prefer to bathe in the river to-morrow morning,
  Brooks here will show you the diving pool. I am wearing a short coat myself
  to-night, but do as you please. We dine at half-past eight."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy disappeared with a courteous little inclination of the head.
  Francis dismissed the manservant at once as being out of keeping with his
  quaint and fascinating surroundings. The tiny room with its flowers, its
  perfume of lavender, its old-fashioned chintzes, and its fragrant linen,
  might still have been a room in a cottage. The sitting-room, with its veranda
  looking down upon the river, was provided with cigars, whisky and soda and
  cigarettes; a bookcase, with a rare copy of Rabelais, an original Surtees, a
  large paper Decameron, and a few other classics. Down another couple of steps
  was a perfectly white bathroom, with shower and plunge. Francis wandered from
  room to room, and finally threw himself into a chair on the veranda to smoke
  a cigarette. From the river below him came now and then the sound of voices.
  Through the trees on his right he could catch a glimpse, here and there, of
  the strange pillars and green domed roof of the Borghese villa.</p><a name=

  <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p>It was one of those faultless June evenings when the only mission of the
  faintly stirring breeze seems to be to carry perfumes from garden to garden
  and to make the lightest of music amongst the rustling leaves. The
  dinner-table had been set out of doors, underneath the odorous cedar-tree.
  Above, the sky was an arc of the deepest blue through which the web of stars
  had scarcely yet found its way. Every now and then came the sound of the
  splash of oars from the river; more rarely still, the murmur of light voices
  as a punt passed up the stream. The little party at The Sanctuary sat over
  their coffee and liqueurs long after the fall of the first twilight, till the
  points of their cigarettes glowed like little specks of fire through the
  enveloping darkness. Conversation had been from the first curiously
  desultory, edited, in a way, Francis felt, for his benefit. There was an
  atmosphere about his host and Lady Cynthia, shared in a negative way by
  Margaret Hilditch, which baffled Francis. It seemed to establish more than a
  lack of sympathy&mdash;to suggest, even, a life lived upon a different plane.
  Yet every now and then their references to everyday happenings were trite
  enough. Sir Timothy had assailed the recent craze for drugs, a diatribe to
  which Lady Cynthia had listened in silence for reasons which Francis could
  surmise.</p>

  <p>"If one must soothe the senses," Sir Timothy declared, "for the purpose of
  forgetting a distasteful or painful present, I cannot see why the average
  mind does not turn to the contemplation of beauty in some shape or other. A
  night like to-night is surely sedative enough. Watch these lights, drink in
  these perfumes, listen to the fall and flow of the water long enough, and you
  would arrive at precisely the same mental inertia as though you had taken a
  dose of cocaine, with far less harmful an aftermath."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Cocaine is in one's dressing-room," she objected, "and beauty is hard to
  seek in Grosvenor Square."</p>

  <p>"The common mistake of all men," Sir Timothy continued, "and women, too,
  for the matter of that, is that we will persist in formulating doctrines for
  other people. Every man or woman is an entity of humanity, with a separate
  heaven and a separate hell. No two people can breathe the same air in the
  same way, or see the same picture with the same eyes."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia rose to her feet and shook out the folds of her diaphanous
  gown, daring alike in its shapelessness and scantiness. She lit a cigarette
  and laid her hand upon Sir Timothy's arm.</p>

  <p>"Come," she said, "must I remind you of your promise? You are to show me
  the stables at The Walled House before it is dark."</p>

  <p>"You would see them better in the morning," he reminded her, rising with
  some reluctance to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she answered, "but I have a fancy to see them now."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy looked back at the table.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," he said, "will you look after Mr. Ledsam for a little time?
  You will excuse us, Ledsam? We shall not be gone long."</p>

  <p>They moved away together towards the shrubbery and the door in the wall
  behind. Francis resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Are you not also curious to penetrate the mysteries behind the wall, Mr.
  Ledsam?" Margaret asked.</p>

  <p>"Not so curious but that I would much prefer to remain here," he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"With me?"</p>

  <p>"With you."</p>

  <p>She knocked the ash from her cigarette. She was looking directly at him,
  and he fancied that there was a gleam of curiosity in her beautiful eyes.
  There was certainly a little more abandon about her attitude. She was leaning
  back in a corner of her high-backed chair, and her gown, although it lacked
  the daring of Lady Cynthia's, seemed to rest about her like a cloud of
  blue-grey smoke.</p>

  <p>"What a curious meal!" she murmured. "Can you solve a puzzle for me, Mr.
  Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>"I would do anything for you that I could," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, then, why my father asked you here to-night? I can understand
  his bringing you to the opera, that was just a whim of the moment, but an
  invitation down here savours of deliberation. Studiously polite though you
  are to one another, one is conscious all the time of the hostility beneath
  the surface."</p>

  <p>"I think that so far as your father is concerned, it is part of his
  peculiar disposition," Francis replied. "You remember he once said that he
  was tired of entertaining his friends&mdash;that there was more pleasure in
  having an enemy at the board."</p>

  <p>"Are you an enemy, Mr. Ledsam?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He rose a little abruptly to his feet, ignoring her question. There were
  servants hovering in the background.</p>

  <p>"Will you walk with me in the gardens?" he begged. "Or may I take you upon
  the river?"</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet. For a moment she seemed to hesitate.</p>

  <p>"The river, I think," she decided. "Will you wait for three minutes while
  I get a wrap. You will find some punts moored to the landing-stage there in
  the stream. I like the very largest and most comfortable."</p>

  <p>Francis strolled to the edge of the stream, and made his choice of punts.
  Soon a servant appeared with his arms full of cushions, and a moment or two
  later, Margaret herself, wrapped in an ermine cloak. She smiled a little
  deprecatingly as she picked her way across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh at me for being such a chilly mortal, please," she enjoined.
  "And don't be afraid that I am going to propose a long expedition. I want to
  go to a little backwater in the next stream."</p>

  <p>She settled herself in the stern and they glided down the narrow
  thoroughfare. The rose bushes from the garden almost lapped the water as they
  passed. Behind, the long low cottage, the deserted dinner-table, the smooth
  lawn with its beds of scarlet geraniums and drooping lilac shrubs in the
  background, seemed like a scene from fairyland, to attain a perfection of
  detail unreal, almost theatrical.</p>

  <p>"To the right when you reach the river, please," she directed. "You will
  find there is scarcely any current. We turn up the next stream."</p>

  <p>There was something almost mysterious, a little impressive, about the
  broad expanse of river into which they presently turned. Opposite were woods
  and then a sloping lawn. From a house hidden in the distance they heard the
  sound of a woman singing. They even caught the murmurs of applause as she
  concluded. Then there was silence, only the soft gurgling of the water cloven
  by the punt pole. They glided past the front of the great unlit house, past
  another strip of woodland, and then up a narrow stream.</p>

  <p>"To the left here," she directed, "and then stop."</p>

  <p>They bumped against the bank. The little backwater into which they had
  turned seemed to terminate in a bed of lilies whose faint fragrance almost
  enveloped them. The trees on either side made a little arch of darkness.</p>

  <p>"Please ship your pole and listen," Margaret said dreamily. "Make yourself
  as comfortable as you can. There are plenty of cushions behind you. This is
  where I come for silence."</p>

  <p>Francis obeyed her orders without remark. For a few moments, speech seemed
  impossible. The darkness was so intense that although he was acutely
  conscious of her presence there, only a few feet away, nothing but the barest
  outline of her form was visible. The silence which she had brought him to
  seek was all around them. There was just the faintest splash of water from
  the spot where the stream and the river met, the distant barking of a dog,
  the occasional croaking of a frog from somewhere in the midst of the bed of
  lilies. Otherwise the silence and the darkness were like a shroud. Francis
  leaned forward in his place. His hands, which gripped the sides of the punt,
  were hot. The serenity of the night mocked him.</p>

  <p>"So this is your paradise," he said, a little hoarsely.</p>

  <p>She made no answer. Her silence seemed to him more thrilling than words.
  He leaned forward. His hands fell upon the soft fur which encompassed her.
  They rested there. Still she did not speak. He tightened his grasp, moved
  further forward, the passion surging through his veins, his breath almost
  failing him. He was so near now that he heard her breathing, saw her face, as
  pale as ever. Her lips were a little parted, her eyes looked out, as it
  seemed to him, half in fear, half in hope. He bent lower still. She neither
  shrank away nor invited him.</p>

  <p>"Dear!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>Her arms stole from underneath the cloak, her fingers rested upon his
  shoulders. He scarcely knew whether it was a caress or whether she were
  holding him from her. In any case it was too late. With a little sob of
  passion his lips were pressed to hers. Even as she closed her eyes, the scent
  of the lilies seemed to intoxicate him.</p>

  <p>He was back in his place without conscious movement. His pulses were
  quivering, the passion singing in his blood, the joy of her faint caress
  living proudly in his memory. It had been the moment of his life, and yet
  even now he felt sick at heart with fears, with the torment of her
  passiveness. She had lain there in his arms, he had felt the thrill of her
  body, some quaint inspiration had told him that she had sought for joy in
  that moment and had not wholly failed. Yet his anxiety was tumultuous,
  overwhelming. Then she spoke, and his heart leaped again. Her voice was more
  natural. It was not a voice which he had ever heard before.</p>

  <p>"Give me a cigarette, please&mdash;and I want to go back."</p>

  <p>He leaned over her again, struck a match with trembling fingers and gave
  her the cigarette. She smiled at him very faintly.</p>

  <p>"Please go back now," she begged. "Smoke yourself, take me home slowly and
  say nothing."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, but his knees were shaking when he stood up. Slowly, a foot at
  a time, they passed from the mesh of the lilies out into the broad stream.
  Almost as they did so, the yellow rim of the moon came up over the low hills.
  As they turned into their own stream, the light was strong enough for him to
  see her face. She lay there like a ghost, her eyes half closed, the only
  touch of colour in the shining strands of her beautiful hair. She roused
  herself a little as they swung around. He paused, leaning upon the pole.</p>

  <p>"You are not angry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not angry," she answered. "Why should I be? But I cannot talk to
  you about it tonight."</p>

  <p>They glided to the edge of the landing-stage. A servant appeared and
  secured the punt.</p>

  <p>"Is Sir Timothy back yet?" Margaret enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, madam."</p>

  <p>She turned to Francis.</p>

  <p>"Please go and have a whisky and soda in the smoking-room," she said,
  pointing to the open French windows. "I am going to my favourite seat. You
  will find me just across the bridge there."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, filled with a passionate disinclination to leave her side
  even for a moment. She seemed to understand but she pointed once more to the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I should like very much," she added, "to be alone for five minutes. If
  you will come and find me then&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>Francis stepped through the French windows into the smoking-room, where
  all the paraphernalia for satisfying thirst were set out upon the sideboard.
  He helped himself to whisky and soda and drank it absently, with his eyes
  fixed upon the clock. In five minutes he stepped once more back into the
  gardens, soft and brilliant now in the moonlight. As he did so, he heard the
  click of the gate in the wall, and footsteps. His host, with Lady Cynthia
  upon his arm, came into sight and crossed the lawn towards him. Francis,
  filled though his mind was with other thoughts, paused for a moment and
  glanced towards them curiously. Lady Cynthia seemed for a moment to have lost
  all her weariness. Her eyes were very bright, she walked with a new spring in
  her movements. Even her voice, as she addressed Francis, seemed altered.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy has been showing me some of the wonders of his villa&mdash;do
  you call it a villa or a palace?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly not a palace," Sir Timothy protested, "and I fear that it
  has scarcely the atmosphere of a villa. It is an attempt to combine certain
  ideas of my own with the requirements of modern entertainment. Come and have
  a drink with us, Ledsam."</p>

  <p>"I have just had one," Francis replied. "Mrs. Hilditch is in the rose
  garden and I am on my way to join her."</p>

  <p>He passed on and the two moved towards the open French windows. He crossed
  the rustic bridge that led into the flower garden, turned down the pergola
  and came to a sudden standstill before the seat which Margaret had indicated.
  It was empty, but in the corner lay the long-stalked lily which she had
  picked in the backwater. He stood there for a moment, transfixed. There were
  other seats and chairs in the garden, but he knew before he started his
  search that it was in vain. She had gone. The flower, drooping a little now
  though the stalk was still wet with the moisture of the river, seemed to him
  like her farewell.</p><a name="ch19"

  <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p>Francis was surprised, when he descended for breakfast the next morning,
  to find the table laid for one only. The butler who was waiting, handed him
  the daily papers and wheeled the electric heater to his side.</p>

  <p>"Is no one else breakfasting?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy and Mrs. Hilditch are always served in their rooms, sir. Her
  ladyship is taking her coffee upstairs."</p>

  <p>Francis ate his breakfast, glanced through the Times, lit a cigarette and
  went round to the garage for his car. The butler met him as he drove up
  before the porch.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy begs you to excuse him this morning, sir," he announced. "His
  secretary has arrived from town with a very large correspondence which they
  are now engaged upon."</p>

  <p>"And Mrs. Hilditch?" Francis ventured.</p>

  <p>"I have not seen her maid this morning, sir," the man replied, "but Mrs.
  Hilditch never rises before midday. Sir Timothy hopes that you slept well,
  sir, and would like you to sign the visitors' book."</p>

  <p>Francis signed his name mechanically, and was turning away when Lady
  Cynthia called to him from the stairs. She was dressed for travelling and
  followed by a maid, carrying her dressing-case.</p>

  <p>"Will you take me up to town, Mr. Ledsam?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Delighted," he answered.</p>

  <p>Their dressing-cases were strapped together behind and Lady Cynthia sank
  into the cushions by his side. They drove away from the house, Francis with a
  backward glance of regret. The striped sun-blinds had been lowered over all
  the windows, thrushes and blackbirds were twittering on the lawn, the air was
  sweet with the perfume of flowers, a boatman was busy with the boats. Out
  beyond, through the trees, the river wound its placid way.</p>

  <p>"Quite a little paradise," Lady Cynthia murmured.</p>

  <p>"Delightful," her companion assented. "I suppose great wealth has its
  obligations, but why any human being should rear such a structure as what he
  calls his Borghese villa, when he has a charming place like that to live in,
  I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>Her silence was significant, almost purposeful. She unwound the veil from
  her motoring turban, took it off altogether and attached it to the cushions
  of the car with a hatpin.</p>

  <p>"There," she said, leaning back, "you can now gaze upon a horrible example
  to the young women of to-day. You can see the ravages which late hours,
  innumerable cocktails, a thirst for excitement, a contempt of the simple
  pleasures of life, have worked upon my once comely features. I was quite
  good-looking, you know, in the days you first knew me."</p>

  <p>"You were the most beautiful debutante of your season," he agreed.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of me now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She met his gaze without flinching. Her face was unnaturally thin, with
  disfiguring hollows underneath her cheekbones; her lips lacked colour; even
  her eyes were lustreless. Her hair seemed to lack brilliancy. Only her silken
  eyebrows remained unimpaired, and a certain charm of expression which nothing
  seemed able to destroy.</p>

  <p>"You look tired," he said.</p>

  <p>"Be honest, my dear man," she rejoined drily. "I am a physical wreck,
  dependent upon cosmetics for the looks which I am still clever enough to palm
  off on the uninitiated."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you lead a quieter life?" he asked. "A month or so in the
  country would put you all right."</p>

  <p>She laughed a little hardly. Then for a moment she looked at him
  appraisingly.</p>

  <p>"I was going to speak to you of nerves," she said, "but how would you ever
  understand? You look as though you had not a nerve in your body. I can't
  think how you manage it, living in London. I suppose you do exercises and
  take care of what you eat and drink."</p>

  <p>"I do nothing of the sort," he assured her indignantly. "I eat and drink
  whatever I fancy. I have always had a direct object in life&mdash;my
  work&mdash;and I believe that has kept me fit and well. Nerve troubles come
  as a rule, I think, from the under-used brain."</p>

  <p>"I must have been born with a butterfly disposition," she said. "I am
  quite sure that mine come because I find it so hard to be amused. I am sure I
  am most enterprising. I try whatever comes along, but nothing satisfies
  me."</p>

  <p>"Why not try being in love with one of these men who've been in love with
  you all their lives?"</p>

  <p>She laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"The men who have cared for me and have been worth caring about," she
  said, "gave me up years ago. I mocked at them when they were in earnest,
  scoffed at sentiment, and told them frankly that when I married it would only
  be to find a refuge for broader life. The right sort wouldn't have anything
  to say to me after that, and I do not blame them. And here is the torture of
  it. I can't stand the wrong sort near me&mdash;physically, I mean. Mind, I
  believe I'm attracted towards people with criminal tastes and propensities. I
  believe that is what first led me towards Sir Timothy. Every taste I ever had
  in life seems to have become besmirched. I'm all the time full of the craving
  to do horrible things, but all the same I can't bear to be touched. That's
  the torment of it. I wonder if you can understand?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can," he answered. "Your trouble lies in having the wrong
  friends and in lack of self-discipline. If you were my sister, I'd take you
  away for a fortnight and put you on the road to being cured."</p>

  <p>"Then I wish I were your sister," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Don't think I'm unsympathetic," he went on, "because I'm not. Wait till
  we've got into the main road here and I'll try and explain."</p>

  <p>They were passing along a country lane, so narrow that twigs from the
  hedges, wreathed here and there in wild roses, brushed almost against their
  cheeks. On their left was the sound of a reaping-machine and the perfume of
  new-mown hay. The sun was growing stronger at every moment. A transitory
  gleam of pleasure softened her face.</p>

  <p>"It is ages since I smelt honeysuckle," she confessed, "except in a
  perfumer's shop. I was wondering what it reminded me of."</p>

  <p>"That," he said, as they turned out into the broad main road, with its
  long vista of telegraph poles, "is because you have been neglecting the real
  for the sham, flowers themselves for their artificially distilled perfume.
  What I was going to try and put into words without sounding too priggish,
  Lady Cynthia," he went on, "is this. It is just you people who are cursed
  with a restless brain who are in the most dangerous position, nowadays. The
  things which keep us healthy and normal physically&mdash;games, farces,
  dinner-parties of young people, fresh air and exercise&mdash;are the very
  things which after a time fail to satisfy the person with imagination. You
  want more out of life, always the something you don't understand, the
  something beyond. And so you keep on trying new things, and for every new
  thing you try, you drop an old one. Isn't it something like that?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," she admitted wearily.</p>

  <p>"Drugs take the place of wholesome wine," he went on, warming to his
  subject. "The hideous fascination of flirting with the uncouth or the
  impossible some way or another, stimulates a passion which simple means have
  ceased to gratify. You seek for the unusual in every way&mdash;in food, in
  the substitution of absinthe for your harmless Martini, of cocaine for your
  stimulating champagne. There is a horrible wave of all this sort of thing
  going on to-day in many places, and I am afraid," he concluded, "that a great
  many of our very nicest young women are caught up in it."</p>

  <p>"Guilty," she confessed. "Now cure me."</p>

  <p>"I could point out the promised land, but how, could I lead you to it?" he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"You don't like me well enough," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"I like you better than you believe," he assured her, slackening his speed
  a little. "We have met, I suppose, a dozen times in our lives. I have danced
  with you here and there, talked nonsense once, I remember, at a musical
  reception&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tried to flirt with you then," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was in the midst of a great case," he said, "and everything that
  happened to me outside it was swept out of my mind day by day. What I was
  going to say is that I have always liked you, from the moment when your
  mother presented me to you at your first dance."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd told me so," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't have made any difference," he declared. "I wasn't in a
  position to think of a duke's daughter, in those days. I don't suppose I am
  now."</p>

  <p>"Try," she begged hopefully.</p>

  <p>He smiled back at her. The reawakening of her sense of humour was
  something.</p>

  <p>"Too late," he regretted. "During the last month or so the thing has come
  to me which we all look forward to, only I don't think fate has treated me
  kindly. I have always loved normal ways and normal people, and the woman I
  care for is different."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about her?" she insisted.</p>

  <p>"You will be very surprised when I tell you her name," he said. "It is
  Margaret Hilditch."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment in blank astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" she exclaimed. "Oliver Hilditch's wife!"</p>

  <p>"I can't help that," he declared, a little doggedly. "She's had a
  miserable time, I know. She was married to a scamp. I'm not quite sure that
  her father isn't as bad a one. Those things don't make any difference."</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't with you," she said softly. "Tell me, did you say anything
  to her last night?"</p>

  <p>"I did," he replied. "I began when we were out alone together. She gave me
  no encouragement to speak of, but at any rate she knows."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia leaned a little forward in her place.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where she is now?"</p>

  <p>He was a little startled.</p>

  <p>"Down at the cottage, I suppose. The butler told me that she never rose
  before midday."</p>

  <p>"Then for once the butler was mistaken," his companion told him. "Margaret
  Hilditch left at six o'clock this morning. I saw her in travelling clothes
  get into the car and drive away."</p>

  <p>"She left the cottage this morning before us?" Francis repeated,
  amazed.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that she did," Lady Cynthia insisted. "I never sleep,
  amongst my other peculiarities," she went on bitterly, "and I was lying on a
  couch by the side of the open window when the car came for her. She stopped
  it at the bend of the avenue&mdash;so that it shouldn't wake us up, I
  suppose. I saw her get in and drive away."</p>

  <p>Francis was silent for several moments. Lady Cynthia watched him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," she observed, "in whatever mood she went away this morning,
  you have evidently succeeded in doing what I have never seen any one else
  do&mdash;breaking through her indifference. I shouldn't have thought that
  anything short of an earthquake would have stirred Margaret, these days."</p>

  <p>"These days?" he repeated quickly. "How long have you known her?"</p>

  <p>"We were at school together for a short time," she told him. "It was while
  her father was in South America. Margaret was a very different person in
  those days."</p>

  <p>"However was she induced to marry a person like Oliver Hilditch?" Francis
  speculated.</p>

  <p>His companion shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" she answered indifferently. "Are you going to drop me?"</p>

  <p>"Wherever you like."</p>

  <p>"Take me on to Grosvenor Square, if you will, then," she begged, "and
  deposit me at the ancestral mansion. I am really rather annoyed about
  Margaret," she went on, rearranging her veil. "I had begun to have hopes that
  you might have revived my taste for normal things."</p>

  <p>"If I had had the slightest intimation&mdash;" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"It would have made no difference," she interrupted dolefully. "Now I come
  to think of it, the Margaret whom I used to know&mdash;and there must be
  plenty of her left yet&mdash;is just the right type of woman for you."</p>

  <p>They drew up outside the house in Grosvenor Square. Lady Cynthia held out
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"Come and see me one afternoon, will you?" she invited.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to very much," he replied.</p>

  <p>She lingered on the steps and waved her hand to him&mdash;a graceful,
  somewhat insolent gesture.</p>

  <p>"All the same, I think I shall do my best to make you forget Margaret,"
  she called out. "Thanks for the lift up. A bientot!"</p><a name="ch20"

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p>Francis drove direct from Grosvenor Square to his chambers in the Temple,
  and found Shopland, his friend from Scotland Yard, awaiting his arrival.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite, I am sorry, to say," was the other's reluctant
  admission.</p>

  <p>Francis hung up his hat, threw himself into his easy-chair and lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"The lad's brother is one of my oldest friends, Shopland," he said. "He is
  naturally in a state of great distress."</p>

  <p>The detective scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I said 'nothing definite' just now, sir," he observed. "As a rule, I
  never mention suspicions, but with you it is a different matter. I haven't
  discovered the slightest trace of Mr. Reginald Wilmore, or the slightest
  reason for his disappearance. He seems to have been a well-conducted young
  gentleman, a little extravagant, perhaps, but able to pay his way and with
  nothing whatever against him. Nothing whatever, that is to say, except one
  almost insignificant thing."</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"A slight tendency towards bad company, sir. I have heard of his being
  about with one or two whom we are keeping our eye upon."</p>

  <p>"Bobby Fairfax's lot, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>Shopland nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was with Jacks and Miss Daisy Hyslop, a night or two before he
  disappeared. I am not sure that a young man named Morse wasn't of the party,
  too."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that lot?" Francis asked curiously. "Are they
  gamesters, dope fiends, or simply vicious?"</p>

  <p>The detective was silent. He was gazing intently at his rather square-toed
  shoes.</p>

  <p>"There are rumours, sir," he said, presently, "of things going on in the
  West End which want looking into very badly&mdash;very badly indeed. You will
  remember speaking to me of Sir Timothy Brast?"</p>

  <p>"I remember quite well," Francis acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to go on," the other continued. "I am working almost on your
  own lines, Mr. Ledsam, groping in the dark to find a clue, as it were, but
  I'm beginning to have ideas about Sir Timothy Brast, just ideas."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he stands on rather queer terms with some of his acquaintances,
  sir. Now you saw, down at Soto's Bar, the night we arrested Mr. Fairfax, that
  not one of those young men there spoke to Sir Timothy as though they were
  acquainted, nor he to them. Yet I happened to find out that every one of
  them, including Mr. Fairfax himself, was present at a party Sir Timothy Brast
  gave at his house down the river a week or two before."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there isn't much in that," Francis declared. "Sir Timothy has
  the name of being an eccentric person everywhere, especially in this
  respect&mdash;he never notices acquaintances. I heard, only the other day,
  that while he was wonderfully hospitable and charming to all his guests, he
  never remembered them outside his house."</p>

  <p>Shopland nodded.</p>

  <p>"A convenient eccentricity," he remarked, a little drily. "I have heard
  the same thing myself. You spent the night at his country cottage, did you
  not, Mr. Ledsam? Did he offer to show you over The Walled House?"</p>

  <p>"How the dickens did you know I was down there?" Francis demanded, with
  some surprise. "I was just thinking as I drove up that I hadn't left my
  address either here or at Clarges Street."</p>

  <p>"Next time you visit Sir Timothy," the detective observed, "I should
  advise you to do so. I knew you were there, Mr. Ledsam, because I was in the
  neighbourhood myself. I have been doing a little fishing, and keeping my eye
  on that wonderful estate of Sir Timothy's."</p>

  <p>Francis was interested.</p>

  <p>"Shopland," he said, "I believe that our intelligences, such as they are,
  are akin."</p>

  <p>"What do you suspect Sir Timothy of?" the detective asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I suspect him of nothing," Francis replied. "He is simply, to my mind, an
  incomprehensible, somewhat sinister figure, who might be capable of anything.
  He may have very excellent qualities which he contrives to conceal, or he may
  be an arch-criminal. His personality absolutely puzzles me."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and Angrave appeared. Apparently he had
  forgotten Shopland's presence, for he ushered in another visitor.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy Brast to see you, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>The moment was one of trial to every one, admirably borne. Shopland
  remained in his chair, with only a casual glance at the newcomer. Francis
  rose to his feet with a half-stifled expression of anger at the clumsiness of
  his clerk. Sir Timothy, well-shaven and groomed, attired in a
  perfectly-fitting suit of grey flannel, nodded to Francis in friendly fashion
  and laid his Homburg hat upon the table with the air of a familiar.</p>

  <p>"My dear Ledsam," he said, "I do hope that you will excuse this early
  call. I could only have been an hour behind you on the road. I dare say you
  can guess what I have come to see you about. Can we have a word
  together?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," was the ready reply. "You remember my friend Shopland, Sir
  Timothy? It was Mr. Shopland who arrested young Fairfax that night at
  Soto's."</p>

  <p>"I remember him perfectly," Sir Timothy declared. "I fancied, directly I
  entered, that your face was familiar," he added, turning to Shopland. "I am
  rather ashamed of myself about that night. My little outburst must have
  sounded almost ridiculous to you two. To tell you the truth, I quite failed
  at that time to give Mr. Ledsam credit for gifts which I have since
  discovered him to possess."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Shopland and I are now discussing another matter," Francis went on,
  pushing a box of cigarettes towards Sir Timothy, who was leaning against the
  table in an easy attitude. "Don't go, Shopland, for a minute. We were
  consulting together about the disappearance of a young man, Reggie Wilmore,
  the brother of a friend of mine&mdash;Andrew Wilmore, the novelist."</p>

  <p>"Disappearance?" Sir Timothy repeated, as he lit a cigarette. "That is
  rather a vague term."</p>

  <p>"The young man has been missing from home for over a week," Francis said,
  "and left no trace whatever of his whereabouts. He was not in financial
  trouble, he does not seem to have been entangled with any young woman, he had
  not quarrelled with his people, and he seems to have been on the best of
  terms with the principal at the house of business where he was employed. His
  disappearance, therefore, is, to say the least of it, mysterious."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy assented gravely.</p>

  <p>"The lack of motive to which you allude," he pointed out, "makes the case
  interesting. Still, one must remember that London is certainly the city of
  modern mysteries. If a new 'Arabian Nights' were written, it might well be
  about London. I dare say Mr. Shopland will agree with me," he continued,
  turning courteously towards the detective, "that disappearances of this sort
  are not nearly so uncommon as the uninitiated would believe. For one that is
  reported in the papers, there are half-a-dozen which are not. Your late Chief
  Commissioner, by-the-bye," he added meditatively, "once a very intimate
  friend of mine, was my informant."</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose they disappear to?" Francis enquired.</p>

  <p>"Who can tell?" was the speculative reply. "For an adventurous youth there
  are a thousand doors which lead to romance. Besides, the lives of none of us
  are quite so simple as they seem. Even youth has its secret chapters. This
  young man, for instance, might be on his way to Australia, happy in the
  knowledge that he has escaped from some murky chapter of life which will now
  never be known. He may write to his friends, giving them a hint. The whole
  thing will blow over."</p>

  <p>"There may be cases such as you suggest, Sir Timothy," the detective said
  quietly. "Our investigations, so far as regards the young man in question,
  however, do not point that way."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy turned over his cigarette to look at the name of the
  maker.</p>

  <p>"Excellent tobacco," he murmured. "By-the-bye, what did you say the young
  man's name was?"</p>

  <p>"Reginald Wilmore," Francis told him.</p>

  <p>"A good name," Sir Timothy murmured. "I am sure I wish you both every good
  fortune in your quest. Would it be too much to ask you now, Mr. Ledsam, for
  that single minute alone?"</p>

  <p>"By no means," Francis answered.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait in the office, if I may," Shopland suggested, rising to his
  feet. "I want to have another word with you before I go."</p>

  <p>"My business with Mr. Ledsam is of a family nature," Sir Timothy said
  apologetically, as Shopland passed out. "I will not keep him for more than a
  moment."</p>

  <p>Shopland closed the door behind him. Sir Timothy waited until he heard his
  departing footsteps. Then he turned back to Francis.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," he said, "I have come to ask you if you know anything of my
  daughter's whereabouts?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," Francis replied. "I was on the point of ringing you up
  to ask you the same question."</p>

  <p>"Did she tell you that she was leaving The Sanctuary?"</p>

  <p>"She gave me not the slightest intimation of it," Francis assured his
  questioner, "in fact she invited me to meet her in the rose garden last
  night. When I arrived there, she was gone. I have heard nothing from her
  since."</p>

  <p>"You spent the evening with her?"</p>

  <p>"To my great content."</p>

  <p>"What happened between you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened. I took the opportunity, however, of letting your
  daughter understand the nature of my feelings for her."</p>

  <p>"Dear me! May I ask what they are?"</p>

  <p>"I will translate them into facts," Francis replied. "I wish your daughter
  to become my wife."</p>

  <p>"You amaze me!" Sir Timothy exclaimed, with the old mocking smile at his
  lips. "How can you possibly contemplate association with the daughter of a
  man whom you suspect and distrust as you do me?"</p>

  <p>"If I suspect and distrust you, it is your own fault," Francis reminded
  him. "You have declared yourself to be a criminal and a friend of criminals.
  I am inclined to believe that you have spoken the truth. I care for that fact
  just as little as I care for the fact that you are a millionaire, or that
  Margaret has been married to a murderer. I intend her to become my wife."</p>

  <p>"Did you encourage her to leave me?"</p>

  <p>"I did not. I had not the slightest idea that she had left The Sanctuary
  until Lady Cynthia told me, halfway to London this morning."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy was silent for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea in your own mind," he persisted, "as to where she has
  gone and for what purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest in the world," Francis declared. "I am just as anxious
  to hear from her; and to know where she is, as you seem to be."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am disappointed," he admitted. "I had hoped to obtain some information
  from you. I must try in another direction."</p>

  <p>"Since you are here, Sir Timothy," Francis said, as his visitor prepared
  to depart, "may I ask whether you have any objection to my marrying your
  daughter?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy frowned.</p>

  <p>"The question places me in a somewhat difficult position," he replied
  coldly. "In a certain sense I have a liking for you. You are not quite the
  ingenuous nincompoop I took you for on the night of our first meeting. On the
  other hand, you have prejudices against me. My harmless confession of
  sympathy with criminals and their ways seems to have stirred up a cloud of
  suspicion in your mind. You even employ a detective to show the world what a
  fool he can look, sitting in a punt attempting to fish, with one eye on the
  supposed abode of crime."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing whatever to do with the details of Shopland's
  investigations," Francis protested. "He is in search of Reggie Wilmore."</p>

  <p>"Does he think I have secret dungeons in my new abode," Sir Timothy
  demanded, "or oubliettes in which I keep and starve brainless youths for some
  nameless purpose? Be reasonable, Mr. Ledsam. What the devil benefit could
  accrue to me from abducting or imprisoning or in any way laying my criminal
  hand upon this young man?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever that we have been able to discover as yet," Francis
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"A leaning towards melodrama, admirable in its way, needs the leaven of a
  well-balanced discretion and a sense of humour," Sir Timothy observed. "The
  latter quality is as a rule singularly absent amongst the myrmidons of
  Scotland Yard. I do not think that Mr. Shopland will catch even fish in the
  neighbourhood of The Walled House. As regards your matrimonial proposal, let
  us waive that until my daughter returns."</p>

  <p>"As you will," Francis agreed. "I will be frank to this extent, at any
  rate. If I can persuade your daughter to marry me, your consent will not
  affect the matter."</p>

  <p>"I can leave Margaret a matter of two million pounds," Sir Timothy said
  pensively.</p>

  <p>"I have enough money to support my wife myself," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Utopian but foolish," Sir Timothy declared. "All the same, Mr. Ledsam,
  let me tell you this. You have a curious attraction for me. When I was asked
  why I had invited you to The Sanctuary last night, I frankly could not answer
  the question. I didn't know. I don't know. Your dislike of me doesn't seem to
  affect the question. I was glad to have you there last night. It pleases me
  to hear you talk, to hear your views of things. I feel that I shall have to
  be very careful, Mr. Ledsam, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or what?" Francis demanded.</p>

  <p>"Or I shall even welcome the idea of having you for a son-in-law," Sir
  Timothy concluded reluctantly. "Make my excuses to Mr. Shopland. Au
  revoir!"</p>

  <p>Shopland came in as the door closed behind the departing visitor. He
  listened to all that Francis had to say, without comment.</p>

  <p>"If The Walled House," he said at last, "is so carefully guarded that Sir
  Timothy has been informed of my watching the place and has been made aware of
  my mild questionings, it must be because there is something to conceal. I may
  or may not be on the track of Mr. Reginald Wilmore, but," the detective
  concluded, "of one thing I am becoming convinced&mdash;The Walled House will
  pay for watching."</p><a name="ch21"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p>It was a day when chance was kind to Francis. After leaving his rooms at
  the Temple, he made a call at one of the great clubs in Pall Mall, to enquire
  as to the whereabouts of a friend. On his way back towards the Sheridan, he
  came face to face with Margaret Hilditch, issuing from the doors of one of
  the great steamship companies. For a moment he almost failed to recognise
  her. She reminded him more of the woman of the tea-shop. Her costume, neat
  and correct though it was, was studiously unobtrusive. Her motoring veil,
  too, was obviously worn to assist her in escaping notice.</p>

  <p>She, too, came to a standstill at seeing him. Her first ejaculations
  betrayed a surprise which bordered on consternation. Then Francis, with a
  sudden inspiration, pointed to the long envelope which she was carrying in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"You have been to book a passage somewhere!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>The monosyllable was in her usual level tone. Nevertheless, he could see
  that she was shaken:</p>

  <p>"You were going away without seeing me again?"' he asked
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She looked up and down a little helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I owe you no explanation for my conduct," she said. "Please let me
  pass."</p>

  <p>"Could we talk for a few minutes, please?" he begged. "Tell me where you
  were going?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, back to lunch, I suppose," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Your father has been up, looking for you," he told her.</p>

  <p>"I telephoned to The Sanctuary," she replied. "He had just left."</p>

  <p>"I am very anxious," he continued, "not to distress you, but I cannot let
  you go away like this. Will you come to my rooms and let us talk for a little
  time?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer. Somehow, he realised that speech just then was
  difficult. He called a taxi and handed her in. They drove to Clarges Street
  in silence. He led the way up the stairs, gave some quick orders to his
  servant whom he met coming down, ushered her into his sitting-room and saw
  her ensconced in an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Please take off that terrible veil," he begged.</p>

  <p>"It is pinned on to my hat," she told him.</p>

  <p>"Then off with both," he insisted. "You can't eat luncheon like that. I'm
  not going to try and bully you. If you've booked your passage to Timbuctoo
  and you really want to go&mdash;why, you must. I only want the chance of
  letting you know that I am coming after you."</p>

  <p>She took off her hat and veil and threw them on to the sofa, glancing
  sideways at a mirror let into the door of a cabinet.</p>

  <p>"My hair is awful," she declared:</p>

  <p>He laughed gaily, and turned around from the sideboard, where he was busy
  mixing cocktails.</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens for that touch of humanity!" he exclaimed. "A woman who can
  bother about her hair when she takes her hat off, is never past praying for.
  Please drink this."</p>

  <p>She obeyed. He took the empty glass away from her. Then he came over to
  the hearthrug by her side.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that I kissed you last night?" he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I do," she answered. "That is why I have just paid eighty-four pounds for
  a passage to Buenos Ayres."</p>

  <p>"I should have enjoyed the trip," he said. "Still, I'm glad I haven't to
  go."</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that you would have come after me?" she asked
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course I should," he assured her. "Believe me, there isn't such an
  obstinate person in the world as the man of early middle-age who suddenly
  discovers the woman he means to marry."</p>

  <p>"But you can't marry me," she protested.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I was Oliver Hilditch's wife, for one thing."</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "if you had been Beelzebub's wife, it wouldn't make
  the least difference to me. You haven't given me much of a chance to tell you
  so yet, Margaret, but I love you."</p>

  <p>She sat a little forward in her chair. Her eyes were fixed upon his
  wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"But how can you?" she exclaimed. "You know, nothing of me except my
  associations, and they have been horrible. What is there to love in me? I am
  a frozen-up woman. Everything is dead here," she went on, clasping her hand
  to her heart. "I have no sentiment, no passion, nothing but an animal desire
  to live my life luxuriously and quickly."</p>

  <p>He smiled confidently. Then, with very little warning, he sank on one
  knee, drew her face to his, kissed her lips and then her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you so sure of all these things, Margaret?" he whispered. "Don't you
  think it is, perhaps, because there has been no one to care for you as I
  do&mdash;as I shall&mdash;to the end of my days? The lily you left on your
  chair last night was like you&mdash;fair and stately and beautiful, but a
  little bruised. You will come back as it has done, come back to the world. My
  love will bring you. My care. Believe it, please!"</p>

  <p>Then he saw the first signs of change in her face. There was the faintest
  shade of almost shell-like pink underneath the creamy-white of her cheeks.
  Her lips were trembling a little, her eyes were misty. With a sudden
  passionate little impulse, her arms were around his neck, her lips sought his
  of their own accord.</p>

  <p>"Let me forget," she sobbed. "Kiss me let me forget!"</p>

  <p>Francis' servant was both heavy-footed and discreet. When he entered the
  room with a tray, his master was standing at the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"I've done the best I could, sir," he announced, a little apologetically.
  "Shall I lay the cloth?"</p>

  <p>"Leave everything on the tray, Brooks," Francis directed. "We will help
  ourselves. In an hour's time bring coffee."</p>

  <p>The man glanced around the room.</p>

  <p>"There are glasses on the sideboard, sir, and the corkscrew is here. I
  think you will have everything you want."</p>

  <p>He departed, closing the door behind him. Francis held out his hands to
  Margaret. She rose slowly to her feet, looked in the glass helplessly and
  then back at him. She was very beautiful but a little dazed.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to have luncheon?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered. "Did you think I meant to starve you?"</p>

  <p>He picked up the long envelope which she had dropped upon the carpet, and
  threw it on to the sofa. Then he drew up two chairs to the table, and opened
  a small bottle of champagne.</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't mind a picnic," he said. "Really, Brooks hasn't done so
  badly&mdash;pate de foie gras, hot toast and Devonshire butter. Let me spread
  some for you. A cold chicken afterwards, and some strawberries. Please be
  hungry, Margaret."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him. It occurred to him suddenly, with a little pang, that
  he had never heard her laugh before. It was like music.</p>

  <p>"I'm too happy," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Believe me," he assured her, as he buttered a piece of toast, "happiness
  and hunger might well be twins. They go so well together. Misery can take
  away one's appetite. Happiness, when one gets over the gulpiness of it, is
  the best tonic in the world. And I never saw any one, dear, with whom
  happiness agreed so well," he added, pausing in his task to bend over and
  kiss her. "Do you know you are the most beautiful thing on earth? It is a
  lucky thing we are going to live in England, and that these are sober,
  matter-of-fact days, or I should find myself committed to fighting duels all
  the time."</p>

  <p>She had a momentary relapse. A look of terror suddenly altered her face.
  She caught at his wrist.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she cried. "Don't talk about such things!"</p>

  <p>He was a little bewildered. The moment passed. She laughed almost
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," she begged, "but I hate the thought of fighting of any sort.
  Some day I'll explain."</p>

  <p>"Clumsy ass I was!" he declared, completing his task and setting the
  result before her. "Now how's that for a first course? Drink a little of your
  wine."</p>

  <p>He leaned his glass against hers.</p>

  <p>"My love," he whispered, "my love now, dear, and always, and you'll find
  it quite strong enough," he went on, "to keep you from all the ugly things.
  And now away with sentiment. I had a very excellent but solitary breakfast
  this morning, and it seems a long time ago."</p>

  <p>"It seems amazing to think that you spent last night at The Sanctuary,"
  she reflected.</p>

  <p>"And that you and I were in a punt," he reminded her, "in the pool of
  darkness where the trees met, and the lilies leaned over to us."</p>

  <p>"And you nearly upset the punt."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort! As a matter of fact, I was very careful. But," he
  proceeded, with a sudden wave of memory, "I don't think my heart will ever
  beat normally again. It seemed as though it would tear its way out of my side
  when I leaned towards you, and you knew, and you lay still."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"You surely didn't expect I was going to get up? It was quite
  encouragement enough to remain passive. As a matter of fact," she went on, "I
  couldn't have moved. I couldn't have uttered a sound. I suppose I must have
  been like one of those poor birds you read about, when some devouring animal
  crouches for its last spring."</p>

  <p>"Compliments already!" he remarked. "You won't forget that my name is
  Francis, will you? Try and practise it while I carve the chicken."</p>

  <p>"You carve very badly, Francis," she told him demurely.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "thank heavens we shall be able to afford a butler!
  By-the-bye, I told your father this morning that I was going to marry you,
  and he didn't seem to think it possible because he had two million
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"Braggart!" she murmured. "When did you see my father?"</p>

  <p>"He came to my rooms in the Temple soon after I arrived this morning. He
  seemed to think I might know where you were. I dare say he won't like me for
  a son-in-law," Francis continued with a smile. "I can't help that. He
  shouldn't have let me go out with you in a punt."</p>

  <p>There was a discreet knock at the door. Brooks made his apologetic and
  somewhat troubled entrance.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy Brast is here to see you, sir," he announced. "I ventured to
  say that you were not at home&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I happened to know otherwise," a still voice remarked from outside.
  "May I come in, Mr. Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy stepped past the servant, who at a sign from Francis
  disappeared, closing the door behind him.</p><a name="ch22"
        id="ch22"><!--Chapter Anchor--></a>

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p>After his first glance at Sir Timothy, Francis' only thought was for
  Margaret. To his intense relief, she showed no signs whatever of terror, or
  of any relapse to her former state. She was entirely mistress of herself and
  the occasion. Sir Timothy's face was cold and terrible.</p>

  <p>"I must apologise for this second intrusion, Mr. Ledsam," he said
  cuttingly. "I think you will admit that the circumstances warrant it. Am I to
  understand that you lied to me this morning?"</p>

  <p>"You are to understand nothing of the sort," Francis answered. "I told you
  everything I knew at that time of your daughter's movements."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Sir Timothy murmured. "This little banquet, then, was
  unpremeditated?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," Francis replied. "Here is the exact truth, so far as I am
  concerned. I met your daughter little more than an hour ago, coming out of a
  steamship office, where she had booked a passage to Buenos Ayres to get away
  from me. I was fortunate enough to induce her to change her mind. She has
  consented instead to remain in England as my wife. We were, as you see,
  celebrating the occasion."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy laid his hat upon the sideboard and slowly removed his
  gloves.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that this pint bottle does not represent your cellar.
  I will drink a glass of wine with you, and with your permission make myself a
  pate sandwich. I was just sitting down to luncheon when I received the
  information which brought me here."</p>

  <p>Francis produced another bottle of wine from the sideboard and filled his
  visitor's glass.</p>

  <p>"You will drink, I hope, to our happiness," he said.</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," Sir Timothy declared, helping himself
  with care to the pate. "I have no superstitions about breaking bread with an
  enemy, or I should not have asked you to visit me at The Sanctuary, Mr.
  Ledsam. I object to your marriage with my daughter, and I shall take what
  steps I can to prevent it."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy did not at once reply. He seemed to be enjoying his sandwich;
  he also appreciated the flavour of his wine.</p>

  <p>"Your question," he said, "strikes me as being a little ingenuous. You are
  at the present moment suspecting me of crimes beyond number. You encourage
  Scotland Yard detectives to make asses of themselves in my stream. Your
  myrmidons scramble on to the top of my walls and try to bribe my servants to
  disclose the mysteries of my household. You have accepted to the fullest
  extent my volunteered statement that I am a patron of crime. You are, in
  short&mdash;forgive me if I help myself to a little more of this
  pate&mdash;engaged in a strenuous attempt to bring me to justice."</p>

  <p>"None of these things affects your daughter," Francis pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," Sir Timothy objected. "You are a great and shining light of
  the English law. People speak of you as a future Chancellor. How can you
  contemplate an alliance with the widow of one criminal and the daughter of
  another?"</p>

  <p>"As to Margaret being Oliver Hilditch's widow," Francis replied, "you were
  responsible for that, and no one else. He was your protege; you gave your
  consent to the marriage. As to your being her father, that again is not
  Margaret's fault. I should marry her if Oliver Hilditch had been three times
  the villain he was, and if you were the Devil himself."</p>

  <p>"I am getting quite to like you, Mr. Ledsam," Sir Timothy declared,
  helping himself to another piece of toast and commencing to butter it.
  "Margaret, what have you to say about all this?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to say," she answered. "Francis is speaking for me. I
  never dreamed that after what I have gone through I should be able to care
  for any one again in this world. I do care, and I am very happy about it. All
  last night I lay awake, making up my mind to run away, and this morning I
  actually booked my passage to Buenos Ayres. Then we met&mdash;just outside
  the steamship office&mdash;and I knew at once that I was making a mistake. I
  shall marry Francis exactly when he wants me to."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy passed his glass towards his proposed son-in-law.</p>

  <p>"Might one suggest," he began&mdash;"thank you very much. This is of
  course very upsetting to me. I seem to be set completely at defiance. It is a
  very excellent wine, this, and a wonderful vintage."</p>

  <p>Francis bent over Margaret.</p>

  <p>"Please finish your lunch, dear," he begged. "It is perhaps just as well
  that your father came. We shall know exactly where we are."</p>

  <p>"Just so," Sir Timothy agreed.</p>

  <p>There was a queer constrained silence for several moments. Then Sir
  Timothy leaned back in his chair and with a word of apology lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Let us," he said, "consider the situation. Margaret is my daughter. You
  wish to marry her. Margaret is of age and has been married before. She is at
  liberty, therefore, to make her own choice. You agree with me so far?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," Francis assented.</p>

  <p>"It happens," Sir Timothy went on, "that I disapprove of her choice. She
  desires to marry a young man who belongs to a profession which I detest, and
  whose efforts in life are directed towards the extermination of a class of
  people for whom I have every sympathy. To me he represents the smug as
  against the human, the artificially moral as against the freethinker. He is
  also my personal enemy. I am therefore naturally desirous that my daughter
  should not marry this young man."</p>

  <p>"We will let it go at that," Francis commented, "but I should like to
  point out to you that the antagonism between us is in no way personal. You
  have declared yourself for forces with which I am at enmity, like any other
  decent-living citizen. Your declaration might at any time be amended."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy bowed.</p>

  <p>"The situation is stated," he said. "I will ask you this question as a
  matter of form. Do you recognise my right to forbid your marriage with my
  daughter, Mr. Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>"I most certainly do not," was the forcible reply.</p>

  <p>"Have I any rights at all?" Sir Timothy asked. "Margaret has lived under
  my roof whenever it has suited her to do so. Since she has taken up her
  residence at Curzon Street, she has been her own mistress, her banking
  account has known no limit whatsoever. I may be a person of evil disposition,
  but I have shown no unkindness to her."</p>

  <p>"It is quite true," Margaret Admitted, turning a little pale. "Since I
  have been alone, you have been kindness itself."</p>

  <p>"Then let me repeat my question," Sir Timothy went on, "have I the right
  to any consideration at all?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Francis replied. "Short of keeping us apart, you have the ordinary
  rights of a parent."</p>

  <p>"Then I ask you to delay the announcement of your engagement, or taking
  any further steps concerning it, for fourteen days," Sir Timothy said. "I
  place no restrictions on your movements during that time. Such hospitality as
  you, Mr. Ledsam, care to accept at my hands, is at your disposal. I am
  Bohemian enough, indeed, to find nothing to complain of in such little
  celebrations as you are at present indulging in&mdash;most excellent pate,
  that. But I request that no announcement of your engagement be made, or any
  further arrangements made concerning it, for that fourteen days."</p>

  <p>"I am quite willing, father," Margaret acquiesced.</p>

  <p>"And I, sir," Francis echoed.</p>

  <p>"In which case," Sir Timothy concluded, rising to his feet, lighting a
  cigarette and taking up his hat and gloves, "I shall go peaceably away. You
  will admit, I trust," he added, with that peculiar smile at the corner of his
  lips, "that I have not in any way tried to come the heavy father? I can even
  command a certain amount of respect, Margaret, for a young man who is able to
  inaugurate his engagement by an impromptu meal of such perfection. I wish you
  both good morning. Any invitation which Margaret extends, Ledsam, please
  consider as confirmed by me."</p>

  <p>He closed the door softly. They heard his footsteps descending the stairs.
  Francis leaned once more over Margaret. She seemed still dazed, confused with
  new thoughts. She responded, however, readily to his touch, yielded to his
  caress with an almost pathetic eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she murmured, as his arms closed around her, "I want to
  forget."</p><a name="ch23"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p>There followed a brief period of time, the most wonderful of his life, the
  happiest of hers. They took advantage of Sir Timothy's absolute license, and
  spent long days at The Sanctuary, ideal lovers' days, with their punt moored
  at night amongst the lilies, where her kisses seemed to come to him with an
  aroma and wonder born of the spot. Then there came a morning when he found a
  cloud on her face. She was looking at the great wall, and away at the minaret
  beyond. They had heard from the butler that Sir Timothy had spent the night
  at the villa, and that preparations were on hand for another of his wonderful
  parties. Francis, who was swift to read her thoughts, led her away into the
  rose garden where once she had failed him.</p>

  <p>"You have been looking over the wall, Margaret," he said
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a little twitch at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"Francis dear," she confessed, "I am afraid you are right. I cannot even
  look towards The Walled House without wondering why it was built&mdash;or
  catch a glimpse of that dome without stupid guesses as to what may go on
  underneath."</p>

  <p>"I think very likely," he said soothingly, "we have both exaggerated the
  seriousness of your father's hobbies. We know that he has a wonderful
  gymnasium there, but the only definite rumour I have ever heard about the
  place is that men fight there who have a grudge against one another, and that
  they are not too particular about the weight of the gloves. That doesn't
  appeal to us, you know, Margaret, but it isn't criminal."</p>

  <p>"If that were all!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I dare say it is," he declared. "London, as you know, is a hot-bed of
  gossip. Everything that goes on is ridiculously exaggerated, and I think that
  it rather appeals to your father's curious sense of humour to pose as the
  law-breaker."</p>

  <p>She pressed his arm a little. The day was overcast, a slight rain was
  beginning to fall.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she whispered, "we had a perfect day here yesterday. Now the
  sun has gone and I am shivery."</p>

  <p>He understood in a moment.</p>

  <p>"We'll lunch at Ranelagh," he suggested. "It is almost on the way up. Then
  we can see what the weather is like. If it is bad, we can dine in town
  tonight and do a theatre."</p>

  <p>"You are a dear," she told him fervently. "I am going in to get
  ready."</p>

  <p>Francis went round to the garage for his car, and brought it to the front.
  While he was sitting there, Sir Timothy came through the door in the wall. He
  was smoking a cigar and he was holding an umbrella to protect his white
  flannel suit. He was as usual wonderfully groomed and turned out, but he
  walked as though he were tired, and his smile, as he greeted Francis, lacked
  a little of its usual light-hearted mockery.</p>

  <p>"Are you going up to town?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Francis pointed to the grey skies.</p>

  <p>"Just for the day," he answered. "Lady Cynthia went by the early train. We
  missed you last night."</p>

  <p>"I came down late," Sir Timothy explained, "and I found it more convenient
  to stay at The Walled House. I hope you find that Grover looks after you
  while I am away? He has carte blanche so far as regards my cellar."</p>

  <p>"We have been wonderfully served," Francis assured him.</p>

  <p>In the distance they could hear the sound of hammering on the other side
  of the wall. Francis moved his head in that direction.</p>

  <p>"I hear that they are preparing for another of your wonderful
  entertainments over there," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"On Thursday," Sir Timothy assented. "I shall have something to say to you
  about it later on."</p>

  <p>"Am I to take it that I am likely to receive an invitation?" Francis
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I should think it possible," was the calm reply.</p>

  <p>"What about Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"My entertainment would not appeal to her," Sir Timothy declared. "The
  women whom I have been in the habit of asking are not women of Margaret's
  type."</p>

  <p>"And Lady Cynthia?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"I find myself in some difficulty as regards Lady Cynthia," he admitted.
  "I am the guardian of nobody's morals, nor am I the censor of their tastes,
  but my entertainments are for men. The women whom I have hitherto asked have
  been women in whom I have taken no personal interest. They are necessary to
  form a picturesque background for my rooms, in the same way that I look to
  the gardeners to supply the floral decorations. Lady Cynthia's instincts,
  however, are somewhat adventurous. She would scarcely be content to remain a
  decoration."</p>

  <p>"The issuing of your invitations," Francis remarked, "is of course a
  matter which concerns nobody else except yourself. If you do decide to favour
  me with one, I shall be delighted to come, provided Margaret has no
  objection."</p>

  <p>"Such a reservation promises well for the future," Sir Timothy observed,
  with gentle sarcasm. "Here comes Margaret, looking very well, I am glad to
  see."</p>

  <p>Margaret came forward to greet her father before stepping into the car.
  They exchanged only a few sentences, but Francis, whose interest in their
  relations was almost abnormally keen, fancied that he could detect signs of
  some change in their demeanour towards one another. The cold propriety of
  deportment which had characterised her former attitude towards her father,
  seemed to have given place to something more uncertain, to something less
  formal, something which left room even for a measure of cordiality. She
  looked at him differently. It was as though some evil thought which lived in
  her heart concerning him had perished.</p>

  <p>"You are busy over there, father?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In a way," he replied. "We are preparing for some festivities on
  Thursday."</p>

  <p>Her face fell.</p>

  <p>"Another party?"</p>

  <p>"One more," he replied. "Perhaps the last&mdash;for the present, at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>She waited as though expecting him to explain. He changed the subject,
  however.</p>

  <p>"I think you are wise to run up to town this morning," he said, glancing
  up at the grey skies. "By-the-bye, if you dine at Curzon Street to-night, do
  ask Hedges to serve you some of the '99 Cliquot. A marvellous wine, as you
  doubtless know, Ledsam, but it should be drunk. Au revoir!"</p>

  <p>Francis, after a pleasant lunch at Ranelagh, and having arranged with
  Margaret to dine with her in Curzon Street, spent an hour or two that
  afternoon at his chambers. As he was leaving, just before five, he came face
  to face with Shopland descending from a taxi.</p>

  <p>"Are you busy, Mr. Ledsam?" the latter enquired. "Can you spare me
  half-an-hour?"</p>

  <p>"An hour, if you like," Francis assented.</p>

  <p>Shopland gave the driver an address and the two men seated themselves in
  the taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" Francis asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," was the cautious reply. "It will not be long, however."</p>

  <p>"Before you discover Reggie Wilmore?"</p>

  <p>The detective smiled in a superior way.</p>

  <p>"I am no longer particularly interested in Mr. Reginald Wilmore," he
  declared. "I have come to the conclusion that his disappearance is not a
  serious affair."</p>

  <p>"It's serious enough for his relatives," Francis objected.</p>

  <p>"Not if they understood the situation," the detective rejoined. "Assure
  them from me that nothing of consequence has happened to that young man. I
  have made enquiries at the gymnasium in Holborn, and in other directions. I
  am convinced that his absence from home is voluntary, and that there is no
  cause for alarm as to his welfare."</p>

  <p>"Then the sooner you make your way down to Kensington and tell his mother
  so, the better," Francis said, a little severely. "Don't forget that I put
  you on to this."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, sir," the detective acquiesced, "and I am grateful to you.
  The fact of it is that in making my preliminary investigations with regard to
  the disappearance of Mr. Wilmore, I have stumbled upon a bigger thing. Before
  many weeks are past, I hope to be able to unearth one of the greatest
  scandals of modern times."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Francis muttered.</p>

  <p>He looked thoughtfully, almost anxiously at his companion. Shopland's face
  reflected to the full his usual confidence. He had the air of a man buoyant
  with hope and with stifled self-satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I am engaged," he continued, "upon a study of the methods and habits of
  one whom I believe to be a great criminal. I think that when I place my
  prisoner in the bar, Wainwright and these other great artists in crime will
  fade from the memory."</p>

  <p>"Is Sir Timothy Brast your man?" Francis asked quietly.</p>

  <p>His companion frowned portentously.</p>

  <p>"No names," he begged.</p>

  <p>"Considering that it was I who first put you on to him," Francis
  expostulated, "I don't think you need be so sparing of your confidence."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," the detective assured him, "I shall tell you everything that
  is possible. At the same time, I will be frank with you. You are right when
  you say that it was you who first directed my attention towards Sir Timothy
  Brast. Since that time, however, your own relations with him, to an onlooker,
  have become a little puzzling."</p>

  <p>"I see," Francis murmured. "You've been spying on me?"</p>

  <p>Shopland shook his head in deprecating fashion.</p>

  <p>"A study of Sir Timothy during the last month," he said, "has brought you
  many a time into the focus."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going to now?" Francis asked, a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Just a side show, sir. It's one of those outside things I have come
  across which give light and shade to the whole affair. We get out here, if
  you please."</p>

  <p>The two men stepped on to the pavement. They were in a street a little
  north of Wardour Street, where the shops for the most part were of a
  miscellaneous variety. Exactly in front of them, the space behind a large
  plate-glass window had been transformed into a sort of show-place for dogs.
  There were twenty or thirty of them there, of all breeds and varieties.</p>

  <p>"What the mischief is this?" Francis demanded.</p>

  <p>"Come in and make enquiries," Shopland replied. "I can promise that you
  will find it interesting. It's a sort of dog's home."</p>

  <p>Francis followed his companion into the place. A pleasant-looking,
  middle-aged woman came forward and greeted the latter.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling my friend what you told me the other day?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," she replied. "We collect stray animals here, sir," she
  continued, turning to Francis. "Every one who has a dog or a cat he can't
  afford to keep, or which he wants to get rid of, may bring it to us. We have
  agents all the time in the streets, and if any official of the Society for
  the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals brings us news of a dog or a cat being
  ill-treated, we either purchase it or acquire it in some way or other and
  keep it here."</p>

  <p>"But your dogs in the window," Francis observed, "all seem to be in
  wonderful condition."</p>

  <p>The woman smiled.</p>

  <p>"We have a large dog and cat hospital behind," she explained, "and a
  veterinary surgeon who is always in attendance. The animals are treated there
  as they are brought in, and fed up if they are out of condition. When they
  are ready to sell, we show them."</p>

  <p>"But is this a commercial undertaking," Francis enquired carefully, "or is
  it a branch of the S.P.C.A.?"</p>

  <p>"It's quite a private affair, sir," the woman told him. "We charge only
  five shillings for the dogs and half-a-crown for the cats, but every one who
  has one must sign our book, promising to give it a good home, and has to be
  either known to us or to produce references. We do not attempt, of course, to
  snake a profit."</p>

  <p>"Who on earth is responsible for the upkeep?"</p>

  <p>"We are not allowed to mention any names here, sir, but as a matter of
  fact I think that your friend knows. He met the gentleman in here one day.
  Would you care to have a look at the hospital, sir?"</p>

  <p>Francis spent a quarter of an hour wandering around. When they left the
  place, Shopland turned to him with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," he said, "shall I tell you at whose expense that place is
  run?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess," Francis replied. "I should say that Sir Timothy
  Brast was responsible for it."</p>

  <p>The detective nodded. He was a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>"You know about his collection of broken-down horses in the park at The
  Walled House, too, then, I suppose? They come whinnying after him like a
  flock of sheep whenever he shows himself."</p>

  <p>"I know about them, too," Francis admitted. "I was present once when he
  got out of his car, knocked a carter down who was ill-treating a horse,
  bought it on the spot and sent it home."</p>

  <p>Shopland smiled, inscrutably yet with the air of one vastly pleased.</p>

  <p>"These little side-shows," he said, "are what help to make this, which I
  believe will be the greatest case of my life, so supremely interesting. Any
  one of my fraternity," he continued, with an air of satisfaction, "can take
  hold of a thread and follow it step by step, and wind up with the handcuffs,
  as I did myself with the young man Fairfax. But a case like this, which
  includes a study of temperament, requires something more."</p>

  <p>They were seated once more in the taxicab, on their way westward. Francis
  for the first time was conscious of an utterly new sensation with regard to
  his companion. He watched him through half-closed eyes&mdash;an
  insignificant-looking little man whose clothes, though neat, were ill-chosen,
  and whose tie was an offense. There was nothing in the face to denote unusual
  intelligence, but the eyes were small and cunning and the mouth dogged.
  Francis looked away out of the window. A sudden flash of realisation had come
  to him, a wave of unreasoning but positive dislike.</p>

  <p>"When do you hope to bring your case to an end?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man smiled once more, and the very smile irritated his companion.</p>

  <p>"Within the course of the next few days, sir," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And the charge?"</p>

  <p>The detective turned around.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," he said, "we have been old friends, if you will allow me to
  use the word, ever since I was promoted to my present position in the Force.
  You have trusted me with a good many cases, and I acknowledge myself your
  debtor, but in the matter of Sir Timothy Brast, you will forgive my saying
  with all respect, sir, that our ways seem to lie a little apart."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me why you have arrived at that conclusion?" Francis asked.
  "It was I who first incited you to set a watch upon Sir Timothy. It was to
  you I first mentioned certain suspicions I myself had with regard to him. I
  treated you with every confidence. Why do you now withhold yours from
  me?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite true, Mr. Ledsam," Shopland admitted, "that it was you who
  first pointed out Sir Timothy as an interesting study for my profession, but
  that was a matter of months ago. If you will forgive my saying so, your
  relations with Sir Timothy have altered since then. You have been his guest
  at The Sanctuary, and there is a rumour, sir&mdash;you will pardon me if I
  seem to be taking a liberty&mdash;that you are engaged to be married to his
  daughter, Oliver Hilditch's widow."</p>

  <p>"You seem to be tolerably well informed as to my affairs, Shopland,"
  Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"Only so far as regards your associations with Sir Timothy," was the
  deprecating reply. "If you will excuse me, sir, this is where I should like
  to descend."</p>

  <p>"You have no message for Mr. Wilmore, then?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite, sir, but you can assure him of this. His brother is not
  likely to come to any particular harm. I have no absolute information to
  offer, but it is my impression that Mr. Reginald Wilmore will be home before
  a week is past. Good afternoon, sir."</p>

  <p>Shopland stepped out of the taxicab and, raising his hat, walked quickly
  away. Francis directed the man to drive to Clarges Street. As they drove off,
  he was conscious of a folded piece of paper in the corner where his late
  companion had been seated. He picked it up, opened it, realised that it was a
  letter from a firm of lawyers, addressed to Shopland, and deliberately read
  it through. It was dated from a small town not far from Hatch End:</p>
  <pre>
  DEAR SIR:

  Mr. John Phillips of this firm, who is coroner for the
district, has desired me to answer the enquiry contained in your
official letter of the 13th. The number of inquests held upon bodies
recovered from the Thames in the neighbourhood to which you allude,
during the present year has been seven. Four of these have been
identified. Concerning the remaining three nothing has ever been heard.
Such particulars as are on our file will be available to any accredited
representative of the police at any time.

                    Faithfully yours,
                                    PHILLIPS &amp; SON.
</pre>

  <p>The taxicab came to a sudden stop. Francis glanced up. Very breathless,
  Shopland put his head in at the window.</p>

  <p>"I dropped a letter," he gasped.</p>

  <p>Francis folded it up and handed it to him.</p>

  <p>"What about these three unidentified people, Shopland?" he asked, looking
  at him intently.</p>

  <p>The man frowned angrily. There was a note of defiance in his tone as he
  stowed the letter away in his pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"There were two men and one woman," he replied, "all three of the upper
  classes. The bodies were recovered from Wilson's lock, some three hundred
  yards from The Walled House."</p>

  <p>"Do they form part of your case?" Francis persisted.</p>

  <p>Shopland stepped back.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," he said, "I told you, some little time ago, that so far as
  this particular case was concerned I had no confidences to share with you. I
  am sorry that you saw that letter. Since you did, however, I hope you will
  not take it as a liberty from one in my position if I advise you most
  strenuously to do nothing which might impede the course of the law. Good day,
  sir!"</p><a name="ch24"

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p>Francis, in that pleasant half-hour before dinner which he spent in
  Margaret's sitting-room, told her of the dogs' home near Wardour Street. She
  listened sympathetically to his description of the place.</p>

  <p>"I had never heard of it," she acknowledged, "but I am not in anyway
  surprised. My father spends at least an hour of every day, when he is down at
  Hatch End, amongst the horses, and every time a fresh crock is brought down,
  he is as interested as though it were a new toy."</p>

  <p>"It is a remarkable trait in a very remarkable character," Francis
  commented.</p>

  <p>"I could tell you many things that would surprise you," Margaret
  continued. "One night, for instance, when we were staying at The Sanctuary,
  he and I were going out to dine with some neighbours and he heard a cat
  mewing in the hedge somewhere. He stopped the car, got out himself, found
  that the cat had been caught in a trap, released it, and sent me on to the
  dinner alone whilst he took the animal back to the veterinary surgeon at The
  Walled House. He was simply white with fury whilst he was tying up the poor
  thing's leg. I couldn't help asking him what he would have done if he could
  have found the farmer who set the trap. He looked up at me and I was almost
  frightened. 'I should have killed him,' he said,&mdash;and I believe he meant
  it. And, Francis, the very next day we were motoring to London and saw a
  terrible accident. A motor bicyclist came down a side road at full speed and
  ran into a motor-lorry. My father got out of the car, helped them lift the
  body from under the wheels of the lorry, and came back absolutely unmoved.
  'Serve the silly young fool right!' was his only remark. He was so horribly
  callous that I could scarcely bear to sit by his side. Do you understand
  that?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't easy," he admitted.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Margaret glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Surely dinner can't be served already!" she exclaimed. "Come in."</p>

  <p>Very much to their surprise, it was Sir Timothy himself who entered. He
  was in evening dress and wearing several orders, one of which Francis noted
  with surprise.</p>

  <p>"My apologies," he said. "Hedges told me that there were cocktails here,
  and as I am on my way to a rather weary dinner, I thought I might inflict
  myself upon you for a moment."</p>

  <p>Margaret rose at once to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I am a shocking hostess," she declared. "Hedges brought the things in
  twenty minutes ago."</p>

  <p>She took up the silver receptacle, shook it vigorously and filled three
  glasses. Sir Timothy accepted his and bowed to them both.</p>

  <p>"My best wishes," he said. "Really, when one comes to think of it, however
  much it may be against my inclinations I scarcely see how I shall be able to
  withhold my consent. I believe that you both have at heart the flair for
  domesticity. This little picture, and the thought of your tete-a-tete dinner,
  almost touches me."</p>

  <p>"Don't make fun of us, father," Margaret begged. "Tell us where you are
  going in all that splendour?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"A month or so ago," he explained, "I was chosen to induct a scion of
  Royalty into the understanding of fighting as it is indulged in at the
  National Sporting Club. This, I suppose, is my reward&mdash;an invitation to
  something in the nature of a State dinner, which, to tell you the truth, I
  had forgotten until my secretary pointed it out to me this afternoon. I have
  grave fears of being bored or of misbehaving myself. I have, as Ledsam here
  knows, a distressing habit of truthfulness, especially to new acquaintances.
  However, we must hope for the best. By-the-bye, Ledsam, in case you should
  have forgotten, I have spoken to Hedges about the '99 Cliquot."</p>

  <p>"Shall we see you here later?" Margaret asked, after Francis had murmured
  his thanks.</p>

  <p>"I shall probably return direct to Hatch End," Sir Timothy replied. "There
  are various little matters down there which are interesting me just now
  preparations for my party. Au revoir! A delicious cocktail, but I am inclined
  to resent the Angostura."</p>

  <p>He sauntered out, after a glance at the clock. They heard his footsteps as
  he descended the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, what manner of a man is your father?" Francis asked
  impulsively.</p>

  <p>"I am his daughter and I do not know," Margaret answered. "Before he came,
  I was going to speak to you of a strange misunderstanding which has existed
  between us and which has just been removed. Now I have a fancy to leave it
  until later. You will not mind?"</p>

  <p>"When you choose," Francis assented. "Nothing will make any difference. We
  are past the days when fathers or even mothers count seriously in the things
  that exist between two people like you and me, who have felt life. Whatever
  your father may be, whatever he may turn out to be, you are the woman I
  love&mdash;you are the woman who is going to be my wife."</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You have an amazing gift," she whispered, "of saying just the thing one
  loves to hear in the way that convinces."</p>

  <p>Dinner was served to them in the smaller of the two dining-rooms, an
  exquisite meal, made more wonderful still by the wine, which Hedges himself
  dispensed with jealous care. The presence of servants, with its restraining
  influence upon conversation, was not altogether unwelcome to Francis. He and
  Margaret had had so little opportunity for general conversation that to
  discuss other than personal subjects in this pleasant, leisurely way had its
  charm. They spoke of music, of which she knew far more than he; of foreign
  travel, where they met on common ground, for each had only the tourist's
  knowledge of Europe, and each was anxious for a more individual acquaintance
  with it. She had tastes in books which delighted him, a knowledge of games
  which promised a common resource. It was only whilst they were talking that
  he realised with a shock how young she was, how few the years that lay
  between her serene school-days and the tempestuous years of her married life.
  Her school-days in Naples were most redolent of delightful memories. She
  broke off once or twice into the language, and he listened with delight to
  her soft accent. Finally the time came when dessert was set upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"I have ordered coffee up in the little sitting-room again," she said, a
  little shyly. "Do you mind, or would you rather have it here?"</p>

  <p>"I much prefer it there," he assured her.</p>

  <p>They sat before an open window, looking out upon some elm trees in the
  boughs of which town sparrows twittered, and with a background of roofs and
  chimneys. Margaret's coffee was untasted, even her cigarette lay unlit by her
  side. There was a touch of the old horror upon her face. The fingers which he
  drew into his were as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>"You must have wondered sometimes," she began, "why I ever married Oliver
  Hilditch."</p>

  <p>"You were very young," he reminded her, with a little shiver, "and very
  inexperienced. I suppose he appealed to you in some way or another."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't that," she replied. "He came to visit, me at Eastbourne, and he
  certainly knew all the tricks of making himself attractive and agreeable. But
  he never won my heart&mdash;he never even seriously took my fancy. I married
  him because I believed that by doing so I was obeying my father's
  wishes."</p>

  <p>"Where was your father at the time, then?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"In South America. Oliver Hilditch was nothing more than a discharged
  employ&eacute; of his, discharged for dishonesty. He had to leave South
  America; within a week to escape prosecution, and on the way to Europe he
  concocted the plot which very nearly ruined my life. He forged a letter from
  my father, begging me, if I found it in any way possible, to listen to Oliver
  Hilditch's proposals, and hinting guardedly at a very serious financial
  crisis which it was in his power to avert. It never occurred to me or to my
  chaperon to question his bona fides. He had lived under the same roof as my
  father, and knew all the intimate details of his life. He was very clever and
  I suppose I was a fool. I remember thinking I was doing quite a heroic action
  when I went to the registrar with him. What it led to you know."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's throbbing silence. Francis, notwithstanding his deep
  pity, was conscious of an overwhelming sensation of relief. She had never
  cared for Oliver Hilditch! She had never pretended to! He put the thought
  into words.</p>

  <p>"You never cared for him, then?"</p>

  <p>"I tried to," she replied simply, "but I found it impossible. Within a
  week of our marriage I hated him."</p>

  <p>Francis leaned back, his eyes half closed. In his ears was the sonorous
  roar of Piccadilly, the hooting of motor-cars, close at hand the rustling of
  a faint wind in the elm trees. It was a wonderful moment. The nightmare with
  which he had grappled so fiercely, which he had overthrown, but whose ghost
  still sometimes walked by his side, had lost its chief and most poignant
  terror. She had been tricked into the marriage. She had never cared or
  pretended to care. The primal horror of that tragedy which he had figured so
  often to himself, seemed to have departed with the thought. Its shadow must
  always remain, but in time his conscience would acquiesce in the
  pronouncement of his reason. It was the hand of justice, not any human hand,
  which had slain Oliver Hilditch.</p>

  <p>"What did your father say when he discovered the truth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He did not know it until he came to England&mdash;on the day that Oliver
  Hilditch was acquitted. My husband always pretended that he had a special
  mail bag going out to South America, so he took away all the letters I wrote
  to my father, and he took care that I received none except one or two which I
  know now were forgeries. He had friends in South America himself who helped
  him&mdash;one a typist in my father's office, of whom I discovered
  afterwards&mdash;but that really doesn't matter. He was a wonderful master of
  deceit."</p>

  <p>Francis suddenly took her hands. He had an overwhelming desire to escape
  from the miasma of those ugly days, with their train of attendant thoughts
  and speculations.</p>

  <p>"Let us talk about ourselves," he whispered.</p>

  <p>After that, the evening glided away incoherently, with no sustained
  conversation, but with an increasing sense of well-being, of soothed nerves
  and happiness, flaming seconds of passion, sign-posts of the wonderful world
  which lay before them. They sat in the cool silence until the lights of the
  returning taxicabs and motor-cars became more frequent, until the stars crept
  into the sky and the yellow arc of the moon stole up over the tops of the
  houses. Presently they saw Sir Timothy's Rolls-Royce glide up to the front
  door below and Sir Timothy himself enter the house, followed by another man
  whose appearance was somehow familiar.</p>

  <p>"Your father has changed his mind," Francis observed.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he has called for something," she suggested, "or he may want to
  change his clothes before he goes down to the country."</p>

  <p>Presently, however, there was a knock at the door. Hedges made his
  diffident appearance.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he began, addressing Francis. "Sir Timothy has
  been asking if you are still here. He would be very glad if you could spare
  him a moment in the library."</p>

  <p>Francis rose at once to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I was just leaving," he said. "I will look in at the library and see Sir
  Timothy on my way out."</p><a name="ch25"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p>Sir Timothy was standing upon the hearthrug of the very wonderful
  apartment which he called his library. By his side, on a black marble
  pedestal, stood a small statue by Rodin. Behind him, lit by a shielded
  electric light, was a Vandyck, "A Portrait of a Gentleman Unknown," and
  Francis, as he hesitated for a moment upon the threshold, was struck by a
  sudden quaint likeness between the face of the man in the picture, with his
  sunken cheeks, his supercilious smile, his narrowed but powerful eyes, to the
  face of Sir Timothy himself. There was something of the same spirit
  there&mdash;the lawless buccaneer, perhaps the criminal.</p>

  <p>"You asked for me, Sir Timothy," Francis said.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled.</p>

  <p>"I was fortunate to find that you had not left," he answered. "I want you
  to be present at this forthcoming interview. You are to a certain extent in
  the game. I thought it might amuse you."</p>

  <p>Francis for the first time was aware that his host was not alone. The
  room, with its odd splashes of light, was full of shadows, and he saw now
  that in an easy-chair a little distance away from Sir Timothy, a girl was
  seated. Behind her, still standing, with his hat in his hand, was a man.
  Francis recognised them both with surprise.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hyslop!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She nodded a little defiantly. Sir Timothy smiled. "Ah!" he said. "You
  know the young lady, without a doubt. Mr. Shopland, your coadjutor in various
  works of philanthropy, you recognise, of course? I do not mind confessing to
  you, Ledsam, that I am very much afraid of Mr. Shopland. I am not at all sure
  that he has not a warrant for my arrest in his pocket."</p>

  <p>The detective came a little further into the light. He was attired in an
  ill-fitting dinner suit, a soft-fronted shirt of unpleasing design, a collar
  of the wrong shape, and a badly arranged tie. He seemed, nevertheless, very
  pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>"I came on here, Mr. Ledsam, at Sir Timothy's desire," he said. "I should
  like you to understand," he added, with a covert glance of warning, "that I
  have been devoting every effort, during the last few days, to the discovery
  of your friend's brother, Mr. Reginald Wilmore."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear it," Francis replied shortly. "The boy's brother
  is one of my greatest friends."</p>

  <p>"I have come to the conclusion," the detective pronounced, "that the young
  man has been abducted, and is being detained at The Walled House against his
  will for some illegal purpose."</p>

  <p>"In other respects," Sir Timothy said, stretching out his hand towards a
  cedar-wood box of cigarettes and selecting one, "this man seems quite sane. I
  have watched him very closely on the way here, but I could see no signs of
  mental aberration. I do not think, at any rate, that he is dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy," Shopland explained, with some anger in his tone, "declines
  to take me seriously. I can of course apply for a search warrant, as I shall
  do, but it occurred to me to be one of those cases which could be better
  dealt with, up to a certain point, without recourse to the extremities of the
  law."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy, who had lit his cigarette, presented a wholly undisturbed
  front.</p>

  <p>"What I cannot quite understand," he said, "is the exact meaning of that
  word 'abduction.' Why should I be suspected of forcibly removing a harmless
  and worthy young man from his regular avocation, and, as you term it,
  abducting him, which I presume means keeping him bound and gagged and
  imprisoned? I do not eat young men. I do not even care for the society of
  young men. I am not naturally a gregarious person, but I think I would go so
  far," he added, with a bow towards Miss Hyslop, "as to say that I prefer the
  society of young women. Satisfy my curiosity, therefore, I beg of you. For
  what reason do you suppose that I have been concerned in the disappearance of
  this Mr. Reginald Wilmore?"</p>

  <p>Francis opened his lips, but Shopland, with a warning glance,
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"I work sometimes as a private person, sir," he said, "but it is not to be
  forgotten that I am an officer of the law. It is not for us to state motives
  or even to afford explanations for our behaviour. I have watched your house
  at Hatch End, Sir Timothy, and I have come to the conclusion that unless you
  are willing to discuss this matter with me in a different spirit, I am
  justified in asking the magistrates for a search warrant."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy sighed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," he said, "I think, after all, that yours is the most
  interesting end of this espionage business. It is you who search for motives,
  is it not, and pass them on to our more automatic friend, who does the rest.
  May I ask, have you supplied the motive in the present case?"</p>

  <p>"I have failed to discover any motive at all for Reginald Wilmore's
  disappearance," Francis admitted, "nor have I at any time been able to
  connect you with it. Mr. Shopland's efforts, however, although he has not
  seen well to take me into his entire confidence, have my warmest approval and
  sympathy. Although I have accepted your very generous hospitality, Sir
  Timothy, I think there has been no misunderstanding between us on this
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Most correct," Sir Timothy murmured. "The trouble seems to be, so far as
  I am concerned, that no one will tell me exactly of what I am suspected? I am
  to give Mr. Shopland the run of my house, or he will make his appearance in
  the magistrate's court and the evening papers will have placards with
  marvellous headlines at my expense. How will it run, Mr. Shopland&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
  "'MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
    MILLIONAIRE'S HOUSE TO BE SEARCHED.'"
</pre>

  <p>"We do not necessarily acquaint the press with our procedure," Shopland
  rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," Sir Timothy continued, "I have known awkward consequences
  arise from a search warrant too rashly applied for or granted. However, we
  are scarcely being polite. So far, Miss Hyslop has had very little to
  say."</p>

  <p>The young lady was not altogether at her ease.</p>

  <p>"I have had very little to say," she repeated, "because I did not expect
  an audience."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy drew a letter from his pocket, opened it and adjusted his
  eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said. "After leaving my dinner-party tonight, I called
  at the club and found this note. Quite an inviting little affair, you see
  young lady's writing, faint but very delicate perfume, excellent stationery,
  Milan Court&mdash;the home of adventures!"</p>
  <pre>
  "DEAR SIR TIMOTHY BRAST:

  "Although I am not known to you personally, there is a
certain matter concerning which information has come into my possession,
which I should like to discuss with you. Will you call and see me as
soon as possible?"                              Sincerely yours,
                                 "DAISY HYSLOP."
</pre>

  <p>"On receipt of this note," Sir Timothy continued, folding it up, "I
  telephoned to the young lady and as I was fortunate enough to find her at
  home I asked her to come here. I then took the liberty of introducing myself
  to Mr. Shopland, whose interest in my evening has been unvarying, and whose
  uninvited company I have been compelled to bear with, and suggested that, as
  I was on my way back to Curzon Street, he had better come in and have a drink
  and tell me what it was all about. I arranged that he should find Miss Hyslop
  here, and for a person of observation, which I flatter myself to be, it was
  easy to discover the interesting fact that Mr. Shopland and Miss Daisy Hyslop
  were not strangers.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, young lady," Sir Timothy went on. "You see, I have placed
  myself entirely in your hands. Never mind the presence of these two
  gentlemen. Tell me exactly what you wanted to say to me?"</p>

  <p>"The matter is of no great importance," Miss Hyslop declared, "in any case
  I should not discuss it before these two gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Don't go for a moment, please," Sir Timothy begged, as she showed signs
  of departure. "Listen. I want to make a suggestion to you. There is an
  impression abroad that I was interested in the two young men, Victor Bidlake
  and Fairfax, and that I knew something of their quarrel. You were an intimate
  friend of young Bidlake's and presumably in his confidence. It occurs to me,
  therefore, that Mr. Shopland might very well have visited you in search of
  information, linking me up with that unfortunate affair. Hence your little
  note to me."</p>

  <p>Miss Hyslop rose to her feet. She had the appearance of being very angry
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to insinuate&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Madam, I insinuate nothing," Sir Timothy interrupted sternly. "I only
  desire to suggest this. You are a young lady whose manner of living, I
  gather, is to a certain extent precarious. It must have seemed to you a
  likelier source of profit to withhold any information you might have to give
  at the solicitation of a rich man, than to give it free gratis and for
  nothing to a detective. Now am I right?"</p>

  <p>Miss Hyslop turned towards the door. She had the air of a person who had
  been entirely misunderstood.</p>

  <p>"I wrote you out of kindness, Sir Timothy," she said in an aggrieved
  manner. "I shall have nothing more to say on the matter&mdash;to you, at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy sighed.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, turning to the others, "I have lost my chance of
  conciliating a witness. My cheque-book remains locked up and she has gone
  over to your side."</p>

  <p>She turned around suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You know that you made Bobby Fairfax kill Victor!" she almost
  shouted.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled in triumph.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he begged, "let us now be friends again. I desired
  to know your trump card. For that reason I fear that I have been a little
  brutal. Now please don't hurry away. You have shot your bolt. Already Mr.
  Shopland is turning the thing over in his mind. Was I lurking outside that
  night, Mr. Shopland, to guide that young man's flabby arm? He scarcely seemed
  man enough for a murderer, did he, when he sat quaking on that stool in
  Soto's Bar while Mr. Ledsam tortured him? I beg you again not to hurry, Miss
  Hyslop. At any rate wait while my servants fetch you a taxi. It was clouding
  over when I came in. We may even have a thunderstorm."</p>

  <p>"I want to get out of this house," Daisy Hyslop declared. "I think you are
  all horrible. Mr. Ledsam did behave like a gentleman when he came to see me,
  and Mr. Shopland asked questions civilly. But you&mdash;" she added, turning
  round to Sir Timothy.</p>

  <p>"Hush, my dear," he interrupted, holding out his hand. "Don't abuse me. I
  am not angry with you&mdash;not in the least&mdash;and I am going to prove
  it. I shall oppose any search warrant which you might apply for, Mr.
  Shopland, and I think I can oppose it with success. But I invite you two,
  Miss Hyslop and Mr. Ledsam, to my party on Thursday night. Once under my roof
  you shall have carte blanche. You can wander where you please, knock the
  walls for secret hiding-places, stamp upon the floor for oubliettes. Upstairs
  or down, the cellars and the lofts, the grounds and the park, the whole of my
  domain is for you from midnight on Thursday until four o'clock. What do you
  say, Mr. Shopland? Does my offer satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>The detective hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I should prefer an invitation for myself," he declared bluntly.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Alas, my dear Mr. Shopland," he regretted, "that is impossible! If I had
  only myself to consider I would not hesitate. Personally I like you. You
  amuse me more than any one I have met for a long time. But unfortunately I
  have my guests to consider! You must be satisfied with Mr. Ledsam's
  report."</p>

  <p>Shopland stroked his stubbly moustache. It was obvious that he was not in
  the least disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"There are three days between now and then," he reflected.</p>

  <p>"During those three days, of course," Sir Timothy said drily, "I shall do
  my best to obliterate all traces of my various crimes. Still, you are a
  clever detective, and you can give Mr. Ledsam a few hints. Take my advice.
  You won't get that search warrant, and if you apply for it none of you will
  be at my party."</p>

  <p>"I accept," Shopland decided.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy crossed the room, unlocked the drawer of a magnificent
  writing-table, and from a little packet drew out two cards of invitation.
  They were of small size but thick, and the colour was a brilliant scarlet. On
  one he wrote the name of Francis, the other he filled in for Miss Hyslop.</p>

  <p>"Miss Daisy Hyslop," he said, "shall we drink a glass of wine together on
  Thursday evening, and will you decide that although, perhaps, I am not a very
  satisfactory correspondent, I can at least be an amiable host?"</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes glistened. She knew very well that the possession of that
  card meant that for the next few days she would be the envy of every one of
  her acquaintances.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sir Timothy," she replied eagerly. "You have quite
  misunderstood me but I should like to come to your party."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy handed over the cards. He rang for a servant and bowed the
  others out. Francis he detained for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Our little duel, my friend, marches," he said. "After Thursday night we
  will speak again of this matter concerning Margaret. You will know then what
  you have to face."</p>

  <p>Margaret herself opened the door and looked in.</p>

  <p>"What have those people been doing here?" she asked. "What is
  happening?"</p>

  <p>Her father unlocked his drawer once more and drew out another of the red
  cards.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," he said, "Ledsam here has accepted my invitation for Thursday
  night. You have never, up till now, honoured me, nor have I ever asked you. I
  suggest that for the first part of the entertainment, you give me the
  pleasure of your company."</p>

  <p>"For the first part?"</p>

  <p>"For the first part only," he repeated, as he wrote her name upon the
  card.</p>

  <p>"What about Francis?" she asked. "Is he to stay all the time?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled. He locked up his drawer and slipped the key into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Ledsam and I," he said, "have promised one another a more complete mutual
  understanding on Thursday night. I may not be able to part with him quite so
  soon."</p><a name="ch26"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p>Bored and listless, like a tired and drooping lily in the arms of her
  somewhat athletic partner, Lady Cynthia brought her dance to a somewhat
  abrupt conclusion.</p>

  <p>"There is some one in the lounge there to whom I wish to speak," she said.
  "Perhaps you won't mind if we finish later. The floor seems sticky tonight,
  or my feet are heavy."</p>

  <p>Her partner made the best of it, as Lady Cynthia's partners, nowadays,
  generally had to. She even dispensed with his escort, and walked across the
  lounge of Claridge's alone. Sir Timothy rose to his feet. He had been sitting
  in a corner, half sheltered by a pillar, and had fancied himself unseen.</p>

  <p>"What a relief!" she exclaimed. "Another turn and I should have fainted
  through sheer boredom."</p>

  <p>"Yet you are quite wonderful dancing," he said. "I have been watching you
  for some time."</p>

  <p>"It is one of my expiring efforts," she declared, sinking into the chair
  by his side. "You know whose party it is, of course? Old Lady Torrington's.
  Quite a boy and girl affair. Twenty-four of us had dinner in the worst corner
  of the room. I can hear the old lady ordering the dinner now. Charles with a
  long menu. She shakes her head and taps him on the wrist with her fan.
  'Monsieur Charles, I am a poor woman. Give me what there is&mdash;a small,
  plain dinner&mdash;and charge me at your minimum.' The dinner was very small
  and very plain, the champagne was horribly sweet. My partner talked of a new
  drill, his last innings for the Household Brigade, and a wonderful round of
  golf he played last Sunday week. I was turned on to dance with a man who
  asked me to marry him, a year ago, and I could feel him vibrating with
  gratitude, as he looked at me, that I had refused. I suppose I am very
  haggard."</p>

  <p>"Does that matter, nowadays?" Sir Timothy asked.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it does. The bone and the hank of hair stuff is played out.
  The dairy-maid style is coming in. Plump little Fanny Torrington had a great
  success to-night, in one of those simple white dresses, you know, which look
  like a sack with a hole cut in the top. What are you doing here by
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I have an engagement in a few minutes," he explained. "My car is waiting
  now. I looked in at the club to dine, found my favourite table taken and
  nearly every man I ever disliked sidling up to tell me that he hears I am
  giving a wonderful party on Thursday. I decided not to dine there, after all,
  and Charles found me a corner here. I am going in five minutes."</p>

  <p>"Where to?" she asked. "Can't I come with you?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not," he answered. "I am going down in the East End."</p>

  <p>"Adventuring?"</p>

  <p>"More or less," he admitted.</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia became beautiful. She was always beautiful when she was not
  tired.</p>

  <p>"Take me with you, please," she begged.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not to be done!"</p>

  <p>"Don't shake your head like that," she enjoined, with a little grimace.
  "People will think I am trying to borrow money from you and that you are
  refusing me! Just take me with you some of the way. I shall scream if I go
  back into that dancing-room again."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"If there is any amusement to you in a rather dull drive
  eastwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was on her feet with the soft, graceful speed which had made her so
  much admired before her present listlessness had set in.</p>

  <p>"I'll get my cloak," she said.</p>

  <p>They drove along the Embankment, citywards. The heat of the city seemed to
  rise from the pavements. The wall of the Embankment was lined with people,
  leaning over to catch the languid breeze that crept up with the tide. They
  crossed the river and threaded their way through a nightmare of squalid
  streets, where half-dressed men and women hung from the top windows and were
  even to be seen upon the roof, struggling for air. The car at last pulled up
  at the corner of a long street.</p>

  <p>"I am going down here," Sir Timothy announced. "I shall be gone perhaps an
  hour. The neighbourhood is not a fit one for you to be left alone in. I shall
  have time to send you home. The car will be back here for me by the time I
  require it."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" she asked curiously. "Why can't I come with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I am going where I cannot take you," was the firm reply. "I told you that
  before I started."</p>

  <p>"I shall sit here and wait for you," she decided. "I rather like the
  neighbourhood. There is a gentleman in shirt-sleeves, leaning over the rail
  of the roof there, who has his eye on me. I believe I shall be a success
  here&mdash;which is more than I can say of a little further westwards."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy smiled slightly. He had exchanged his hat for a tweed cap, and
  had put on a long dustcoat.</p>

  <p>"There is no gauge by which you may know the measure of your success," he
  said. "If there were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If there were?" she asked, leaning a little forward and looking at him
  with a touch of the old brilliancy in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"If there were," he said, with a little show of mock gallantry, "a very
  jealously-guarded secret might escape me. I think you will be quite all right
  here," he continued. "It is an open thoroughfare, and I see two policemen at
  the corner. Hassell, my chauffeur, too, is a reliable fellow. We will be back
  within the hour."</p>

  <p>"We?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>He indicated a man who had silently made his appearance during the
  conversation and was standing waiting on the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"Just a companion. I do not advise you to wait. If you insist&mdash;au
  revoir!"</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia leaned back in a corner of the car.</p>

  <p>Through half-closed eyes she watched the two men on their way down the
  crowded thoroughfare&mdash;Sir Timothy tall, thin as a lath, yet with a
  certain elegance of bearing; the man at his side shorter, his hands thrust
  into the pockets of his coat, his manner one of subservience. She wondered
  languidly as to their errand in this unsavoury neighbourhood. Then she closed
  her eyes altogether and wondered about many things.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy and his companion walked along the crowded, squalid street
  without speech. Presently they turned to the right and stopped in front of a
  public-house of some pretensions.</p>

  <p>"This is the place?" Sir Timothy asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>Both men entered. Sir Timothy made his way to the counter, his companion
  to a table near, where he took a seat and ordered a drink. Sir Timothy did
  the same. He was wedged in between a heterogeneous crowd of shabby, depressed
  but apparently not ill-natured men and women. A man in a flannel shirt and
  pair of shabby plaid trousers, which owed their precarious position to a pair
  of worn-out braces, turned a beery eye upon the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"I'll 'ave one with you, guvnor," he said.</p>

  <p>"You shall indeed," Sir Timothy assented.</p>

  <p>"Strike me lucky but I've touched first time!" the man exclaimed. "I'll
  'ave a double tot of whisky," he added, addressing the barman. "Will it run
  to it, guvnor?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," was the cordial reply, "and the same to your friends, if you
  will answer a question."</p>

  <p>"Troop up, lads," the man shouted. "We've a toff 'ere. He ain't a
  'tec&mdash;I know the cut of them. Out with the question."</p>

  <p>"Serve every one who desires it with drinks," Sir Timothy directed the
  barman. "My question is easily answered. Is this the place which a man whom I
  understand they call Billy the Tanner frequents?"</p>

  <p>The question appeared to produce an almost uncomfortable sensation. The
  enthusiasm for the free drinks, however, was only slightly damped, and a
  small forest of grimy hands was extended across the counter.</p>

  <p>"Don't you ask no questions about 'im, guvnor," Sir Timothy's immediate
  companion advised earnestly. "He'd kill you as soon as look at you. When
  Billy the Tanner's in a quarrelsome mood, I've see 'im empty this place and
  the whole street, quicker than if a mad dog was loose. 'E's a fair and 'oly
  terror, 'e is. 'E about killed 'is wife, three nights ago, but there ain't a
  living soul as 'd dare to stand in the witness-box about it."</p>

  <p>"Why don't the police take a hand in the matter if the man is such a
  nuisance?" Sir Timothy asked.</p>

  <p>His new acquaintance, gripping a thick tumbler of spirits and water with a
  hand deeply encrusted with the stains of his trade, scoffed.</p>

  <p>"Police! Why, 'e'd take on any three of the police round these parts!" he
  declared. "Police! You tell one on 'em that Billy the Tanner's on the
  rampage, and you'll see 'em 'op it. Cheero, guvnor and don't you get curious
  about Billy. It ain't 'ealthy."</p>

  <p>The swing-door was suddenly opened. A touslehaired urchin shoved his face
  in.</p>

  <p>"Billy the Tanner's coming!" he shouted. "Cave, all! He's been 'avin' a
  rare to-do in Smith's Court."</p>

  <p>Then a curious thing happened. The little crowd at the bar seemed somehow
  to melt away. Half-a-dozen left precipitately by the door. Half-a-dozen more
  slunk through an inner entrance into some room beyond. Sir Timothy's
  neighbour set down his tumbler empty. He was the last to leave.</p>

  <p>"If you're going to stop 'ere, guvnor," he begged fervently, "you keep a
  still tongue in your 'ead. Billy ain't particular who it is. 'E'd kill 'is
  own mother, if 'e felt like it. 'E'll swing some day, sure as I stand 'ere,
  but 'e'll do a bit more mischief first. 'Op it with me, guvnor, or get inside
  there."</p>

  <p>"Jim's right," the man behind the bar agreed. "He's a very nasty customer,
  Bill the Tanner, sir. If he's coming down, I'd clear out for a moment. You
  can go in the guvnor's sitting-room, if you like."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Billy the Tanner will not hurt me," he said. "As a matter of fact, I came
  down to see him."</p>

  <p>His new friend hesitated no longer but made for the door through which
  most of his companions had already disappeared. The barman leaned across the
  counter.</p>

  <p>"Guvnor," he whispered hoarsely, "I don't know what the game is, but I've
  given you the office. Billy won't stand no truck from any one. He's a holy
  terror."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy nodded.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's ominous silence. The barman withdrew to the further
  end of his domain and busied himself cleaning some glasses. Suddenly the door
  was swung open. A man entered whose appearance alone was calculated to
  inspire a certain amount of fear. He was tall, but his height escaped notice
  by reason of the extraordinary breadth of his shoulders. He had a coarse and
  vicious face, a crop of red hair, and an unshaven growth of the same upon his
  face. He wore what appeared to be the popular dress in the
  neighbourhood&mdash;a pair of trousers suspended by a belt, and a dirty
  flannel shirt. His hands and even his chest, where the shirt fell away, were
  discoloured by yellow stains. He looked around the room at first with an air
  of disappointment. Then he caught sight of Sir Timothy standing at the
  counter, and he brightened up.</p>

  <p>"Where's all the crowd, Tom?" he asked the barman.</p>

  <p>"Scared of you, I reckon," was the brief reply. "There was plenty here a
  few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Scared of me, eh?" the other repeated, staring hard at Sir Timothy. "Did
  you 'ear that, guvnor?"</p>

  <p>"I heard it," Sir Timothy acquiesced.</p>

  <p>Billy the Tanner began to cheer up. He walked all round this stranger.</p>

  <p>"A toff! A big toff! I'll 'ave a drink with you, guvnor," he declared,
  with a note of incipient truculence in his tone.</p>

  <p>The barman had already reached up for two glasses but Sir Timothy shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he said.</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. The barman made despairing signs at Sir
  Timothy. Billy the Tanner was moistening his lips with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Because I don't know you and I don't like you," was the bland reply.</p>

  <p>Billy the Tanner wasted small time upon preliminaries. He spat upon his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I dunno you and I don't like you," he retorted. "D'yer know wot I'm going
  to do?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," Sir Timothy confessed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make you look so that your own mother wouldn't know
  you&mdash;then I'm going to pitch you into the street," he added, with an
  evil grin. "That's wot we does with big toffs who come 'anging around
  'ere."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" Sir Timothy said calmly. "Perhaps my friend may have something
  to say about that."</p>

  <p>The man of war was beginning to be worked up.</p>

  <p>"Where's your big friend?" he shouted. "Come on! I'll take on the two of
  you."</p>

  <p>The man who had met Sir Timothy in the street had risen to his feet. He
  strolled up to the two. Billy the Tanner eyed him hungrily.</p>

  <p>"The two of you, d'yer 'ear?" he shouted. "And 'ere's just a flick for the
  toff to be going on with!"</p>

  <p>He delivered a sudden blow at Sir Timothy&mdash;a full, vicious, jabbing
  blow which had laid many a man of the neighbourhood in the gutter. To his
  amazement, the chin at which he had aimed seemed to have mysteriously
  disappeared. Sir Timothy himself was standing about half-a-yard further away.
  Billy the Tanner was too used to the game to be off his balance, but he
  received at that moment the surprise of his life. With the flat of his hand
  full open, Sir Timothy struck him across the cheek such a blow that it
  resounded through the place, a blow that brought both the inner doors ajar,
  that brought peering eyes from every direction. There was a moment's silence.
  The man's fists were clenched now, there was murder in his face. Sir Timothy
  stepped on one side.</p>

  <p>"I am not a fighter," he said coolly, leaning back against the marble
  table. "My friend will deal with you."</p>

  <p>Billy the Tanner glared at the newcomer, who had glided in between him and
  Sir Timothy.</p>

  <p>"You can come and join in, too," he shouted to Sir Timothy. "I'll knock
  your big head into pulp when I've done with this little job!"</p>

  <p>The bully knew in precisely thirty seconds what had happened to him. So
  did the crowds who pressed back into the place through the inner door. So did
  the barman. So did the landlord, who had made a cautious appearance through a
  trapdoor. Billy the Tanner, for the first time in his life, was fighting a
  better man. For two years he had been the terror of the neighbourhood, and he
  showed now that at least he had courage. His smattering of science, however,
  appeared only ridiculous. Once, through sheer strength and blundering force,
  he broke down his opponent's guard and struck him in the place that had
  dispatched many a man before&mdash;just over the heart. His present opponent
  scarcely winced, and Billy the Tanner paid the penalty then for his years of
  bullying. His antagonist paused for a single second, as though unnerved by
  the blow. Red fire seemed to stream from his eyes. Then it was all over. With
  a sickening crash, Billy the Tanner went down upon the sanded floor. It was
  no matter of a count for him. He lay there like a dead man, and from the two
  doors the hidden spectators streamed into the room. Sir Timothy laid some
  money upon the table.</p>

  <p>"This fellow insulted me and my friend," he said. "You see, he has paid
  the penalty. If he misbehaves again, the same thing will happen to him. I am
  leaving some money here with your barman. I shall be glad for every one to
  drink with me. Presently, perhaps, you had better send for an ambulance or a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>A little storm of enthusiastic excitement, evidenced for the most part in
  expletives of a lurid note, covered the retreat of Sir Timothy and his
  companion. Out in the street a small crowd was rushing towards the place. A
  couple of policemen seemed to be trying to make up their minds whether it was
  a fine night. An inspector hurried up to them.</p>

  <p>"What's doing in 'The Rising Sun'?" he demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>"Some one's giving Billy the Tanner a hiding," one of the policemen
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Honest?"</p>

  <p>"A fair, ripe, knock-out hiding," was the emphatic confirmation. "I looked
  in at the window."</p>

  <p>The inspector grinned.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you had the sense not to interfere," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy and his companion reached the car. The latter took a seat by
  the chauffeur. Sir Timothy stepped in. It struck him that Lady Cynthia was a
  little breathless. Her eyes, too, were marvellously bright. Wrapped around
  her knees was the chauffeur's coat.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" she declared. "I haven't had such a wonderful five minutes
  since I can remember! You are a dear to have brought me, Sir Timothy."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Mean?" she laughed, as the car swung around and they glided away. "You
  didn't suppose I was going to sit here and watch you depart upon a mysterious
  errand? I borrowed your chauffeur's coat and his cap, and slunk down after
  you. I can assure you I looked the most wonderful female apache you ever saw!
  And I saw the fight. It was better than any of the prize fights I have ever
  been to. The real thing is better than the sham, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy leaned back in his place and remained silent. Soon they passed
  out of the land of tired people, of stalls decked out with unsavoury
  provender, of foetid smells and unwholesome-looking houses. They passed
  through a street of silent warehouses on to the Embankment. A stronger breeze
  came down between the curving arc of lights.</p>

  <p>"You are not sorry that you brought me?" Lady Cynthia asked, suddenly
  holding out her hand.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy took it in his. For some reason or other, he made no answer at
  all.</p><a name="ch27"

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p>The car stopped in front of the great house in Grosvenor Square. Lady
  Cynthia turned to her companion.</p>

  <p>"You must come in, please," she said. "I insist, if it is only for five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy followed her across the hall to a curved recess, where the
  footman who had admitted them touched a bell, and a small automatic lift came
  down.</p>

  <p>"I am taking you to my own quarters," she explained. "They are rather cut
  off but I like them&mdash;especially on hot nights."</p>

  <p>They glided up to the extreme top of the house. She opened the gates and
  led the way into what was practically an attic sitting-room, decorated in
  black and white. Wide-flung doors opened onto the leads, where comfortable
  chairs, a small table and an electric standard were arranged. They were far
  above the tops of the other houses, and looked into the green of the
  Park.</p>

  <p>"This is where I bring very few people," she said. "This is where, even
  after my twenty-eight years of fraudulent life, I am sometimes myself.
  Wait."</p>

  <p>There were feminine drinks and sandwiches arranged on the table. She
  opened the cupboard of a small sideboard just inside the sitting-room,
  however, and produced whisky and a syphon of soda. There was a pail of ice in
  a cool corner. From somewhere in the distance came the music of violins
  floating through the window of a house where a dance was in progress. They
  could catch a glimpse of the striped awning and the long line of waiting
  vehicles with their twin eyes of fire. She curled herself up on a settee,
  flung a cushion at Sir Timothy, who was already ensconced in a luxurious
  easy-chair, and with a tumbler of iced sherbet in one hand, and a cigarette
  in the other, looked across at him.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," she said, "that you have not to-night dispelled an
  illusion."</p>

  <p>"What manner of one?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Above all things," she went on, "I have always looked upon you as wicked.
  Most people do. I think that is one reason why so many of the women find you
  attractive. I suppose it is why I have found you attractive."</p>

  <p>The smile was back upon his lips. He bowed a little, and, leaning forward,
  dropped a chunk of ice into his whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"Dear Lady Cynthia," he murmured, "don't tell me that I am going to slip
  back in your estimation into some normal place."</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure," she said deliberately. "I have always looked upon
  you as a kind of amateur criminal, a man who loved black things and dark
  ways. You know how weary one gets of the ordinary code of morals in these
  days. You were such a delightful antidote. And now, I am not sure that you
  have not shaken my faith in you."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"You really seem to have been engaged to-night in a very sporting and
  philanthropic enterprise. I imagined you visiting some den of vice and mixing
  as an equal with these terrible people who never seem to cross the bridges. I
  was perfectly thrilled when I put on your chauffeur's coat and hat and
  followed you."</p>

  <p>"The story of my little adventure is a simple one," Sir Timothy said. "I
  do not think it greatly affects my character. I believe, as a matter of fact,
  that I am just as wicked as you would have me be, but I have friends in every
  walk of life, and, as you know, I like to peer into the unexpected places. I
  had heard of this man Billy the Tanner. He beats women, and has established a
  perfect reign of terror in the court and neighbourhood where he lives. I fear
  I must agree with you that there were some elements of morality&mdash;of
  conforming, at any rate, to the recognised standards of justice&mdash;in what
  I did. You know, of course, that I am a great patron of every form of boxing,
  fencing, and the various arts of self-defence and attack. I just took along
  one of the men from my gymnasium who I knew was equal to the job, to give
  this fellow a lesson."</p>

  <p>"He did it all right," Lady Cynthia murmured.</p>

  <p>"But this is where I think I re-establish myself," Sir Timothy continued,
  the peculiar nature of his smile reasserting itself. "I did not do this for
  the sake of the neighbourhood. I did not do it from any sense of justice at
  all. I did it to provide for myself an enjoyable and delectable
  spectacle."</p>

  <p>She smiled lazily.</p>

  <p>"That does rather let you out," she admitted. "However, on the whole I am
  disappointed. I am afraid that you are not so bad as people think."</p>

  <p>"People?" he repeated. "Francis Ledsam, for instance&mdash;my son-in-law
  in posse?"</p>

  <p>"Francis Ledsam is one of those few rather brilliant persons who have
  contrived to keep sane without becoming a prig," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"You know why?" he reminded her. "Francis Ledsam has been a tremendous
  worker. It is work which keeps a man sane. Brilliancy without the capacity
  for work drives people to the madhouse."</p>

  <p>"Where we are all going, I suppose," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Not you," he answered. "You have just enough&mdash;I don't know what we
  moderns call it&mdash;soul, shall I say?&mdash;to keep you from the muddy
  ways."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and leaned over the rails. Sir Timothy watched her
  thoughtfully. Her figure, notwithstanding its suggestions of delicate
  maturity, was still as slim as a young girl's. She was looking across the
  tree-tops towards an angry bank of clouds&mdash;long, pencil-like streaks of
  black on a purple background. Below, in the street, a taxi passed with
  grinding of brakes and noisy horn. The rail against which she leaned looked
  very flimsy. Sir Timothy stretched out his hand and held her arm.</p>

  <p>"My nerves are going with my old age," he apologised. "That support seems
  too fragile."</p>

  <p>She did not move. The touch of his fingers grew firmer.</p>

  <p>"We have entered upon an allegory," she murmured. "You are preserving me
  from the depths."</p>

  <p>He laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>"I!" he exclaimed, with a sudden touch of real and fierce bitterness which
  brought the light dancing into her eyes and a spot of colour to her cheeks.
  "I preserve you! Why, you can never hear my name without thinking of sin, of
  crime of some sort! Do you seriously expect me to ever preserve any one from
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"You haven't made any very violent attempts to corrupt me," she reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"Women don't enter much into my scheme of life," he declared. "They played
  a great part once. It was a woman, I think, who first headed me off from the
  pastures of virtue."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said softly. "It was Margaret's mother."</p>

  <p>His voice rang out like a pistol-shot.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?"</p>

  <p>She turned away from the rail and threw herself back in her chair. His
  hand, however, she still kept in hers.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Joe was Minister at Rio, you know, the year it all happened," she
  explained. "He told us the story years ago&mdash;how you came back from
  Europe and found things were not just as they should be between Margaret's
  mother and your partner, and how you killed your partner."</p>

  <p>His nostrils quivered a little. One felt that the fire of suffering had
  touched him again for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I killed him," he admitted. "That is part of my creed. The men who
  defend their honour in the Law Courts are men I know nothing of. This man
  would have wronged me and robbed me of my honour. I bade him defend himself
  in any way he thought well. It was his life or mine. He was a poor fighter
  and I killed him."</p>

  <p>"And Margaret's mother died from the shock."</p>

  <p>"She died soon afterwards."</p>

  <p>The stars grew paler. The passing vehicles, with their brilliant lights,
  grew fewer and fewer. The breeze which had been so welcome at first, turned
  into a cold night wind. She led the way back into the room.</p>

  <p>"I must go," he announced.</p>

  <p>"You must go," she echoed, looking up at him. "Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>She was so close to him that his embrace, sudden and passionate though it
  was, came about almost naturally. She lay in his arms with perfect content
  and raised her lips to his.</p>

  <p>He broke away. He was himself again, self-furious.</p>

  <p>"Lady Cynthia," he said, "I owe you my most humble apologies. The evil
  that is in me does not as a rule break out in this direction."</p>

  <p>"You dear, foolish person," she laughed, "that was good, not evil. You
  like me, don't you? But I know you do. There is one crime you have always
  forgotten to develop&mdash;you haven't the simplest idea in the world how to
  lie."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I like you," he admitted. "I have the most absurd feeling for you
  that any man ever found it impossible to put into words. We have indeed
  strayed outside the world of natural things," he added.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she murmured. "I never felt more natural or normal in my life. I
  can assure you that I am loving it. I feel like muslin gowns and primroses
  and the scent of those first March violets underneath a warm hedge where the
  sun comes sometimes. I feel very natural indeed, Sir Timothy."</p>

  <p>"What about me?" he asked harshly. "In three weeks' time I shall be fifty
  years old."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"And in no time at all I shall be thirty&mdash;and entering upon a
  terrible period of spinsterhood!"</p>

  <p>"Spinsterhood!" he scoffed. "Why, whenever the Society papers are at a
  loss for a paragraph, they report a few more offers of marriage to the
  ever-beautiful Lady Cynthia."</p>

  <p>"Don't be sarcastic," she begged. "I haven't yet had the offer of marriage
  I want, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"You'll get one you don't want in a moment," he warned her.</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she laughed nervously. "How am I to preserve my romantic notions
  of you as the emperor of the criminal world, if you kiss me as you did just
  now&mdash;you kissed me rather well&mdash;and then ask me to marry you? It
  isn't your role. You must light a cigarette now, pat the back of my hand, and
  swagger off to another of your haunts of vice."</p>

  <p>"In other words, I am not to propose?" Sir Timothy said slowly.</p>

  <p>"You see how decadent I am," she sighed. "I want to toy with my pleasures.
  Besides, there's that scamp of a brother of mine coming up to have a
  drink&mdash;I saw him get out of a taxi&mdash;and you couldn't get it through
  in time, not with dignity."</p>

  <p>The rattle of the lift as it stopped was plainly audible. He stooped and
  kissed her fingers.</p>

  <p>"I fear some day," he murmured, "I shall be a great disappointment to
  you."</p><a name="ch28"

  <br>

  <h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p>There was a great deal of discussion, the following morning at the
  Sheridan Club, during the gossipy half-hour which preceded luncheon,
  concerning Sir Timothy Brast's forthcoming entertainment. One of the men,
  Philip Baker, who had been for many years the editor of a famous sporting
  weekly, had a ticket of invitation which he displayed to an envious little
  crowd.</p>

  <p>"You fellows who get invitations to these parties," a famous actor
  declared, "are the most elusive chaps on earth. Half London is dying to know
  what really goes on there, and yet, if by any chance one comes across a
  prospective or retrospective guest, he is as dumb about it as though it were
  some Masonic function. We've got you this time, Baler, though. We'll put you
  under the inquisition on Friday morning."</p>

  <p>"There a won't be any need," the other replied. "One hears a great deal of
  rot talked about these affairs, but so far as I know, nothing very much out
  of the way goes on. There are always one or two pretty stiff fights in the
  gymnasium, and you get the best variety show and supper in the world."</p>

  <p>"Why is there this aroma of mystery hanging about the affair, then?" some
  one asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, for one or two reasons," Baker answered. "One, no doubt, is because
  Sir Timothy has a great idea of arranging the fights himself, and the
  opponents actually don't know until the fight begins whom they are meeting,
  and sometimes not even then. There has been some gossiping, too, about the
  rules, and the weight of the gloves, but that I know, nothing about."</p>

  <p>"And the rest of the show?" a younger member enquired. "Is it simply
  dancing and music and that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Just a variety entertainment," the proud possessor of the scarlet-hued
  ticket declared. "Sir Timothy always has something up his sleeve. Last year,
  for instance, he had those six African girls over from Paris in that queer
  dance which they wouldn't allow in London at all. This time no one knows what
  is going to happen. The house, as you know, is absolutely surrounded by that
  hideous stone wall, and from what I have heard, reporters who try to get in
  aren't treated too kindly. Here's Ledsam. Very likely he knows more about
  it."</p>

  <p>"Ledsam," some one demanded, as Francis joined the group, "are you going
  to Sir Timothy Brast's show to-morrow night?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," Francis replied, producing his strip of pasteboard.</p>

  <p>"Ever been before?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what sort of a show it's going to be?" the actor
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest idea. I don't think any one does. That's rather a
  feature of the affair, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is the envious outsider who has never received an invitation, like
  myself," some one remarked, "who probably spreads these rumours, for one
  always hears it hinted that some disgraceful and illegal exhibition is on tap
  there&mdash;a new sort of drugging party, or some novel form of
  debauchery."</p>

  <p>"I don't think," Francis said quietly, "that Sir Timothy is quite that
  sort of man."</p>

  <p>"Dash it all, what sort of man is he?" the actor demanded. "They tell me
  that financially he is utterly unscrupulous, although he is rolling in money.
  He has the most Mephistophelian expression of any man I ever met&mdash;looks
  as though he'd set his heel on any one's neck for the sport of it&mdash;and
  yet they say he has given at least fifty thousand pounds to the Society for
  the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and that the whole of the park round
  that estate of his down the river is full of lamed and decrepit beasts which
  he has bought himself off the streets."</p>

  <p>"The man must have an interesting personality," a novelist who had joined
  the party observed. "Of course, you know that he was in prison for six
  months?"</p>

  <p>"What for?" some one asked.</p>

  <p>"Murder, only they brought it in manslaughter," was the terse reply. "He
  killed his partner. It was many years ago, and no one knows all the facts of
  the story."</p>

  <p>"I am not holding a brief for Sir Timothy," Francis remarked, as he sipped
  his cocktail. "As a matter of fact, he and I are very much at cross-purposes.
  But as regards that particular instance, I am not sure that he was very much
  to be blamed, any more than you can blame any injured person who takes the
  law into his own hands."</p>

  <p>"He isn't a man I should care to have for an enemy," Baker declared.</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll shake the truth out of you fellows, somehow or other," one of
  the group threatened. "On Friday morning we are going to have the whole
  truth&mdash;none of this Masonic secrecy which Baker indulged in last
  year."</p>

  <p>The men drifted in to luncheon and Francis, leaving them, took a taxi on
  to the Ritz. Looking about in the vestibule for Margaret, he came face to
  face with Lady Cynthia. She was dressed with her usual distinction in a gown
  of yellow muslin and a beflowered hat, and was the cynosure of a good many
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"One would almost imagine, Lady Cynthia," he said, as they exchanged
  greetings, "that you had found that elixir we were talking about."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have," she answered, smiling. "Are you looking for Margaret?
  She is somewhere about. We were just having a chat when I was literally
  carried off by that terrible Lanchester woman. Let's find her."</p>

  <p>They strolled up into the lounge. Margaret came to meet them. Her smile,
  as she gave Francis her left hand, transformed and softened her whole
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind my having asked Cynthia to lunch with us?" she said. "I
  really couldn't get rid of the girl. She came in to see me this morning the
  most aggressively cheerful person I ever knew. I believe that she had an
  adventure last night. All that she will tell me is that she dined and danced
  at Claridge's with a party of the dullest people in town."</p>

  <p>A tall, familiar figure passed down the vestibule. Lady Cynthia gave a
  little start, and Francis, who happened to be watching her, was amazed at her
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Your father, Margaret!" she pointed out. "I wonder if he is lunching
  here."</p>

  <p>"He told me that he was lunching somewhere with a South American
  friend&mdash;one of his partners, I believe," Margaret replied. "I expect he
  is looking for him."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy caught sight of them, hesitated for a moment and came slowly
  in their direction.</p>

  <p>"Have you found your friend?" Margaret asked.</p>

  <p>"The poor fellow is ill in bed," her father answered. "I was just
  regretting that I had sent the car away, or I should have gone back to Hatch
  End."</p>

  <p>"Stay and lunch with us," Lady Cynthia begged, a little impetuously.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very pleased if you will," Francis put in. "I'll go and tell
  the waiter to enlarge my table."</p>

  <p>He hurried off. On his way back, a page-boy touched him on the arm.</p>

  <p>"If you please, sir," he announced, "you are wanted on the telephone."</p>

  <p>"I?" Francis exclaimed. "Some mistake, I should think. Nobody knows that I
  am here."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," the boy said. "This way, sir."</p>

  <p>Francis walked down the vestibule to the row of telephone boxes at the
  further end. The attendant who was standing outside, indicated one of them
  and motioned the boy to go away. Francis stepped inside. The man followed,
  closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"I am asking your pardon, sir, for taking a great liberty," he confessed.
  "No one wants you on the telephone. I wished to speak to you."</p>

  <p>Francis looked at him in surprise. The man was evidently agitated. Somehow
  or other, his face was vaguely familiar.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what do you want with me?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"I was butler to Mr. Hilditch, sir," the man replied. "I waited upon you
  the night you dined there, sir&mdash;the night of Mr. Hilditch's death."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I have a revelation to make with regard to that night, sir," the man went
  on, "which I should like to place in your hands. It is a very serious matter,
  and there are reasons why something must be done about it at once. Can I come
  and see you at your rooms, sir?"</p>

  <p>Francis studied the man for a moment intently. He was evidently
  agitated&mdash;evidently, too, in very bad health. His furtive manner was
  against him. On the other hand, that might have arisen from nervousness.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in at half-past three, number 13 b, Clarges Street," Francis
  told him.</p>

  <p>"I can get off for half-an-hour then, sir," the man replied. "I shall be
  very glad to come. I must apologise for having troubled you, sir."</p>

  <p>Francis went slowly back to his trio of guests. All the way down the
  carpeted vestibule he was haunted by the grim shadow of a spectral fear. The
  frozen horror of that ghastly evening was before him like a hateful tableau.
  Hilditch's mocking words rang in his cars: "My death is the one thing in the
  world which would make my wife happy." The Court scene, with all its gloomy
  tragedy, rose before his eyes&mdash;only in the dock, instead of Hilditch, he
  saw another!</p><a name="ch29"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p>There were incidents connected with that luncheon which Francis always
  remembered. In the first place, Sir Timothy was a great deal more silent than
  usual. A certain vein of half-cynical, half-amusing comment upon things and
  people of the moment, which seemed, whenever he cared to exert himself, to
  flow from his lips without effort, had deserted him. He sat where the rather
  brilliant light from the high windows fell upon his face, and Francis
  wondered more than once whether there were not some change there, perhaps
  some prescience of trouble to come, which had subdued him and made him
  unusually thoughtful. Another slighter but more amusing feature of the
  luncheon was the number of people who stopped to shake hands with Sir Timothy
  and made more or less clumsy efforts to obtain an invitation to his coming
  entertainment. Sir Timothy's reply to these various hints was barely cordial.
  The most he ever promised was that he would consult with his secretary and
  see if their numbers were already full. Lady Cynthia, as a somewhat blatant
  but discomfited Peer of the Realm took his awkward leave of them, laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I think they all deserve what they get," she declared. "I
  never heard such brazen impudence in my life&mdash;from people who ought to
  know better, too."</p>

  <p>Lord Meadowson, a sporting peer, who was one of Sir Timothy's few
  intimates, came over to the table. He paid his respects to the two ladies and
  Francis, and turned a little eagerly to Sir Timothy.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy nodded.</p>

  <p>"We shall be quite prepared for you," he said. "Better bring your
  cheque-book."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" the other exclaimed. "As I hadn't heard anything, I was
  beginning to wonder whether you would be ready with your end of the
  show."</p>

  <p>"There will be no hitch so far as we are concerned," Sir Timothy assured
  him.</p>

  <p>"More mysteries?" Margaret enquired, as Meadowson departed with a smile of
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Her father shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely that," he replied. "It is a little wager between Lord Meadowson
  and myself which is to be settled to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Lady Torrington, a fussy little woman, her hostess of the night before, on
  her way down the room stopped and shook hands with Lady Cynthia.</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear," she exclaimed, "wherever did you vanish to last night?
  Claude told us all that, in the middle of a dance with him, you excused
  yourself for a moment and he never saw you again. I quite expected to read in
  the papers this morning that you had eloped."</p>

  <p>"Precisely what I did," Lady Cynthia declared. "The only trouble was that
  my partner had had enough of me before the evening was over, and deposited me
  once more in Grosvenor Square. It is really very humiliating," she went on
  meditatively, "how every one always returns me."</p>

  <p>"You talk such nonsense, Cynthia!" Lady Torrington exclaimed, a little
  pettishly. "However, you found your way home all right?"</p>

  <p>"Quite safely, thank you. I was going to write you a note this afternoon.
  I went away on an impulse. All I can say is that I am sorry. Do forgive
  me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" was the somewhat chilly reply. "Somehow or other, you seem to
  have earned the right to do exactly as you choose. Some of my young men whom
  you had promised to dance with, were disappointed, but after all, I suppose
  that doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"Not much," Lady Cynthia assented sweetly. "I think a few disappointments
  are good for most of the young men of to-day."</p>

  <p>"What did you do last night, Cynthia?" Margaret asked her presently, when
  Lady Torrington had passed on.</p>

  <p>"I eloped with your father," Lady Cynthia confessed, smiling across at Sir
  Timothy. "We went for a little drive together and I had a most amusing time.
  The only trouble was, as I have been complaining to that tiresome woman, he
  brought me home again."</p>

  <p>"But where did you go to?" Margaret persisted.</p>

  <p>"It was an errand of charity," Sir Timothy declared.</p>

  <p>"It sounds very mysterious," Francis observed. "Is that all we are to be
  told?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Sir Timothy complained, "that very few people sympathise
  with my hobbies or my prosecution of them. That is why such little incidents
  as last night's generally remain undisclosed. If you really wish to know what
  happened," he went on, after a moment's pause, "I will tell you. As you know,
  I have a great many friends amongst the boxing fraternity, and I happened to
  hear of a man down in the East End who has made himself a terror to the whole
  community in which he lives. I took Peter Fields, my gymnasium instructor,
  down to the East End last night, and Peter Fields&mdash;dealt with him."</p>

  <p>"There was a fight?" Margaret exclaimed, with a little shudder.</p>

  <p>"There was a fight," Sir Timothy repeated, "if you can call it such.
  Fields gave him some part of the punishment he deserved."</p>

  <p>"And you were there, Cynthia?"</p>

  <p>"I left Lady Cynthia in the car," Sir Timothy explained. "She most
  improperly bribed my chauffeur to lend her his coat and hat, and followed
  me."</p>

  <p>"You actually saw the fight, then?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"I did," Lady Cynthia admitted. "I saw it from the beginning to the
  end."</p>

  <p>Margaret looked across the table curiously. It seemed to her that her
  friend had turned a little paler.</p>

  <p>"Did you like it?" she asked simply.</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia was silent for a moment. She glanced at Sir Timothy. He, too,
  was waiting for her answer with evident interest.</p>

  <p>"I was thrilled," she acknowledged. "That was the pleasurable part of it I
  have been so, used to looking on at shows that bored me, listening to
  conversations that wearied me, attempting sensations which were repellent,
  that I just welcomed feeling, when it came&mdash;feeling of any sort. I was
  excited. I forgot everything else. I was so fascinated that I could not look
  away. But if you ask me whether I liked it, and I have to answer truthfully,
  I hated it! I felt nothing of the sort at the time, but when I tried to sleep
  I found myself shivering. It was justice, I know, but it was ugly."</p>

  <p>She watched Sir Timothy, as she made her confession, a little wistfully.
  He said nothing, but there was a very curious change in his expression. He
  smiled at her in an altogether unfamiliar way.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she said, appealing to him, "that you are very disappointed
  in me?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he answered, "I am delighted."</p>

  <p>"You mean that?" she asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I do," he declared. "Companionship between our sexes is very delightful
  so far as it goes, but the fundamental differences between a man's outlook
  and tastes and a woman's should never be bridged over. I myself do not wish
  to learn to knit. I do not care for the womenkind in whom I am interested to
  appreciate and understand fighting."</p>

  <p>Margaret looked across the table in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You are most surprising this morning, father," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I am perhaps misunderstood," he sighed, "perhaps have acquired a
  reputation for greater callousness than I possess. Personally, I love
  fighting. I was born a fighter, and I should find no happier way of ending my
  life than fighting, but, to put it bluntly, fighting is a man's job."</p>

  <p>"What about women going to see fights at the National Sporting Club?" Lady
  Cynthia asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is their own affair, but if you ask my opinion I do not approve of
  it," Sir Timothy replied. "I am indifferent upon the subject, because I am
  indifferent upon the subject of the generality of your sex," he added, with a
  little smile, "but I simply hold that it is not a taste which should be
  developed in women, and if they do develop it, it is at the expense of those
  very qualities which make them most attractive."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia took a cigarette from her case and leaned over to Francis for
  a light.</p>

  <p>"The world is changing," she declared. "I cannot bear many more shocks. I
  fancied that I had written myself for ever out of Sir Timothy's good books
  because of my confession just now."</p>

  <p>He smiled across at her. His words were words of courteous badinage, but
  Lady Cynthia was conscious of a strange little sense of pleasure.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he assured her, "you found your way just a little
  further into my heart."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, in a general sort of way," Margaret observed, leaning
  back in her chair, "that you and my father are becoming extraordinarily
  friendly, Cynthia."</p>

  <p>"I am hopefully in love with your father," Lady Cynthia confessed. "It has
  been coming on for a long time. I suspected it the first time I ever met him.
  Now I am absolutely certain."</p>

  <p>"It's quite a new idea," Margaret remarked. "Shall we like her in the
  family, Francis?"</p>

  <p>"No airs!" Lady Cynthia warned her. "You two are not properly engaged yet.
  It may devolve upon me to give my consent."</p>

  <p>"In that case," Francis replied, "I hope that we may at least count upon
  your influence with Sir Timothy?"</p>

  <p>"If you'll return the compliment and urge my suit with him," Lady Cynthia
  laughed. "I am afraid he can't quite make up his mind about me, and I am so
  nice. I haven't flirted nearly so much as people think, and my instincts are
  really quite domestic."</p>

  <p>"My position," Sir Timothy remarked, as he made an unsuccessful attempt to
  possess himself of the bill which Francis had called for, "is becoming a
  little difficult."</p>

  <p>"Not really difficult," Lady Cynthia objected, "because the real decision
  rests in your hands."</p>

  <p>"Just listen to the woman!" Margaret exclaimed. "Do you realise, father,
  that Cynthia is making the most brazen advances to you? And I was going to
  ask her if she'd like to come back to The Sanctuary with us this
  evening!"</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia was suddenly eager. Margaret glanced across at her father.
  Sir Timothy seemed almost imperceptibly to stiffen a little.</p>

  <p>"Margaret has carte blanche at The Sanctuary as regards her visitors," he
  said. "I am afraid that I shall be busy over at The Walled House."</p>

  <p>"But you'd come and dine with us?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy hesitated. An issue which had been looming in his mind for
  many hours seemed to be suddenly joined.</p>

  <p>"Please!" Lady Cynthia begged.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy followed the example of the others and rose to his feet. He
  avoided Lady Cynthia's eyes. He seemed suddenly a little tired.</p>

  <p>"I will come and dine," he assented quietly. "I am afraid that I cannot
  promise more than that. Lady Cynthia, as she knows, is always welcome at The
  Sanctuary."</p><a name="ch30"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p>Punctual to his appointment that afternoon, the man who had sought an
  interview with Francis was shown into the latter's study in Clarges
  Street.</p>

  <p>He wore an overcoat over his livery, and directly he entered the room
  Francis was struck by his intense pallor. He had been trying feverishly to
  assure himself that all that the man required was the usual sort of help, or
  assistance into a hospital. Yet there was something furtive in his visitor's
  manner, something which suggested the bearer of a guilty secret.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me what you want as quickly as you can," Francis begged. "I
  am due to start down into the country in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you long, sir," the man replied. "The matter is rather a
  serious one."</p>

  <p>"Are you ill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>"You had better sit down."</p>

  <p>The man relapsed gratefully into a chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave out everything that doesn't count, sir," he said. "I'll be as
  brief as I can. I want you to go back to the night I waited upon you at
  dinner the night Mr. Oliver Hilditch was found dead. You gave evidence. The
  jury brought it in 'suicide.' It wasn't suicide at all, sir. Mr. Hilditch was
  murdered."</p>

  <p>The sense of horror against which he had been struggling during the last
  few hours, crept once more through the whole being of the man who listened.
  He was face to face once more with that terrible issue. Had he perjured
  himself in vain? Was the whole structure of his dreams about to collapse, to
  fall about his ears?</p>

  <p>"By whom?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>"By Sir Timothy Brast, sir."</p>

  <p>Francis, who had been standing with his hand upon the table, felt suddenly
  inclined to laugh. Facile though his brain was, the change of issues was too
  tremendous for him to readily assimilate it. He picked up a cigarette from an
  open box, with shaking fingers, lit it, and threw himself into an easy-chair.
  He was all the time quite unconscious of what he was doing.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy Brast?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man reiterated. "I wish to tell you the whole story."</p>

  <p>"I am listening," Francis assured him.</p>

  <p>"That evening before dinner, Sir Timothy Brast called to see Mr. Hilditch,
  and a very stormy interview took place. I do not know the rights of that,
  sir. I only know that there was a fierce quarrel. Mrs. Hilditch came in and
  Sir Timothy left the house. His last words to Mr. Hilditch were, 'You will
  hear from me again.' As you know, sir&mdash;I mean as you remember, if you
  followed the evidence&mdash;all the servants slept at the back of the house.
  I slept in the butler's room downstairs, next to the plate pantry. I was
  awake when you left, sitting in my easy-chair, reading. Ten minutes after you
  had left, there was a sound at the front door as though some one had knocked
  with their knuckles. I got up, to open it but Mr. Hilditch was before me. He
  admitted Sir Timothy. They went back into the library together. It struck me
  that Mr. Hilditch had had a great deal to drink, and there was a queer look
  on Sir Timothy's face that I didn't understand. I stepped into the little
  room which communicates with the library by folding doors. There was a chink
  already between the two. I got a knife from the pantry and widened it until I
  could see through. I heard very little of the conversation but there was no
  quarrel. Mr. Hilditch took up the weapon which you know about, sat in a chair
  and held it to his heart. I heard him say something like this. 'This ought to
  appeal to you, Sir Timothy. You're a specialist in this sort of thing. One
  little touch, and there you are.' Mrs. Hilditch said something about putting
  it away. My master turned to Sir Timothy and said something in a low tone.
  Suddenly Sir Timothy leaned over. He caught hold of Mr. Hilditch's hand which
  held the hilt of the dagger, and and&mdash;well, he just drove it in, sir.
  Then he stood away. Mrs. Hilditch sprang up and would have screamed, but Sir
  Timothy placed his hand over her mouth. In a moment I heard her say, 'What
  have you done?' Sir Timothy looked at Mr. Hilditch quite calmly. 'I have
  ridded the world of a verminous creature,' he said. My knees began to shake.
  My nerves were always bad. I crept back into my room, took off my clothes and
  got into bed. I had just put the light out when they called for me."</p>

  <p>Francis was himself again. There was an immense relief, a joy in his
  heart. He had never for a single moment blamed Margaret, but he had never for
  a single moment forgotten. It was a closed chapter but the stain was on its
  pages. It was wonderful to tear it out and scatter the fragments.</p>

  <p>"I remember you at the inquest," he said. "Your name is John Walter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Your evidence was very different."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"You kept all this to yourself."</p>

  <p>"I did, sir. I thought it best."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what has happened since?"</p>

  <p>The man looked down at the table.</p>

  <p>"I have always been a poor man, sir," he said. "I have had bad luck
  whenever I've made a try to start at anything. I thought there seemed a
  chance for me here. I went to Sir Timothy and I told him everything."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy never turned a hair, sir. When I had finished he was very
  short with me, almost curt. 'You have behaved like a man of sense, Walter,'
  he said. 'How much?' I hesitated for some time. Then I could see he was
  getting impatient. I doubled what I had thought of first. 'A thousand pounds,
  sir,' I said. Sir Timothy he went to a safe in the wall and he counted out a
  thousand pounds in notes, there and then. He brought them over to me.
  'Walter,' he said, 'there is your thousand pounds. For that sum I understand
  you promise to keep what you saw to yourself?' 'Yes, sir,' I agreed. 'Take
  it, then,' he said, 'but I want you to understand this. There have been many
  attempts but no one yet has ever succeeded in blackmailing me. No one ever
  will. I give you this thousand pounds willingly. It is what you have asked
  for. Never let me see your face again. If you come to me starving, it will be
  useless. I shall not part with another penny.'"</p>

  <p>The man's simple way of telling his story, his speech, slow and uneven on
  account of his faltering breath, seemed all to add to the dramatic nature of
  his disclosure. Francis found himself sitting like a child who listens to a
  fairy story.</p>

  <p>"And then?" he asked simply.</p>

  <p>"I went off with the money," Walter continued, "and I had cruel bad luck.
  I put it into a pub. I was robbed a little, I drank a little, my wife wasn't
  any good. I lost it all, sir. I found myself destitute. I went back to Sir
  Timothy."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>The man shifted his feet nervously. He seemed to have come to the
  difficult part of his story.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy was as hard as nails," he said slowly. "He saw me. The moment
  I had finished, he rang the bell. 'Hedges,' he said to the manservant who
  came in, 'this man has come here to try and blackmail me. Throw him out. If
  he gives any trouble, send for the police. If he shows himself here again,
  send for the police."'</p>

  <p>"What happened then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I nearly blurted out the whole story," the man confessed, "and then
  I remembered that wouldn't do me any good, so I went away. I got a job at the
  Ritz, but I was took ill a few days afterwards. I went to see a doctor. From
  him I got my death-warrant, sir."</p>

  <p>"Is it heart?"</p>

  <p>"It's heart, sir," the man acknowledged. "The doctor told me I might snuff
  out at any moment. I can't live, anyway, for more than a year. I've got a
  little girl."</p>

  <p>"Now just why have you come to see me?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"For just this, sir," the man replied. "Here's my account of what
  happened," he went on, drawing some sheets of foolscap from his pocket. "It's
  written in my own hand and there are two witnesses to my signature&mdash;one
  a clergyman, sir, and the other a doctor, they thinking it was a will or
  something. I had it in my mind to send that to Scotland Yard, and then I
  remembered that I hadn't a penny to leave my little girl. I began to
  wonder&mdash;think as meanly of me as you like, sir&mdash;how I could still
  make some money out of this. I happened to know that you were none too
  friendly disposed towards Sir Timothy. This confession of mine, if it
  wouldn't mean hanging, would mean imprisonment for the rest of his life. You
  could make a better bargain with him than me, sir. Do you want to hold him in
  your power? If so, you can have this confession, all signed and everything,
  for two hundred pounds, and as I live, sir, that two hundred pounds is to pay
  for my funeral, and the balance for my little girl."</p>

  <p>Francis took the papers and glanced them through.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I buy this document from you," he said, "what is its actual
  value? You could write out another confession, get that signed, and sell it
  to another of Sir Timothy's enemies, or you could still go to Scotland Yard
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't do that, sir, I assure you," the man declared nervously, "not
  on my solemn oath. I want simply to be quit of the whole matter and have a
  little money for the child."</p>

  <p>Francis considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"There is only one way I can see," he said, "to make this document worth
  the money to me. If you will sign a confession that any statement you have
  made as to the death of Mr. Hilditch is entirely imaginary, that you did not
  see Sir Timothy in the house that night, that you went to bed at your usual
  time and slept until you were awakened, and that you only made this charge
  for the purpose of extorting money&mdash;if you will sign a confession to
  that effect and give it me with these papers, I will pay you the two hundred
  pounds and I will never use the confession unless you repeat the charge."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, sir," the man assented.</p>

  <p>Francis drew up a document, which his visitor read through and signed.
  Then he wrote out an open cheque.</p>

  <p>"My servant shall take you to the bank in a taxi," he said. "They would
  scarcely pay you this unless you were identified. We understand one
  another?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, sir!"</p>

  <p>Francis rang the bell, gave his servant the necessary orders, and
  dismissed the two men. Half-an-hour later, already changed into flannels, he
  was on his way into the country.</p><a name="ch31"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p>Sir Timothy walked that evening amongst the shadows. Two hours ago, the
  last of the workmen from the great furnishing and catering establishments who
  undertook the management of his famous entertainments, had ceased work for
  the day and driven off in the motor-brakes hired to take them to the nearest
  town. The long, low wing whose use no one was able absolutely to divine, was
  still full of animation, but the great reception-rooms and stately hall were
  silent and empty. In the gymnasium, an enormous apartment as large as an
  ordinary concert hall, two or three electricians were still at work, directed
  by the man who had accompanied Sir Timothy to the East End on the night
  before. The former crossed the room, his footsteps awaking strange
  echoes.</p>

  <p>"There will be seating for fifty, sir, and standing room for fifty," he
  announced. "I have had the ring slightly enlarged, as you suggested, and the
  lighting is being altered so that the start is exactly north and south."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy nodded thoughtfully. The beautiful oak floor of the place was
  littered with sawdust and shavings of wood. Several tiers of seats had been
  arranged on the space usually occupied by swings, punching-balls and other
  artifices. On a slightly raised dais at the further end was an exact replica
  of a ring, corded around and with sawdust upon the floor. Upon the walls hung
  a marvellous collection of weapons of every description, from the modern
  rifle to the curved and terrible knife used by the most savage of known
  tribes.</p>

  <p>"How are things in the quarters?" Sir Timothy asked.</p>

  <p>"Every one is well, sir. Doctor Ballantyne arrived this afternoon. His
  report is excellent."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy nodded and turned away. He looked into the great gallery, its
  waxen floors shining with polish, ready for the feet of the dancers on the
  morrow; looked into a beautiful concert-room, with an organ that reached to
  the roof; glanced into the banquetting hall, which extended far into the
  winter-garden; made his way up the broad stairs, turned down a little
  corridor, unlocked a door and passed into his own suite. There was a small
  dining-room, a library, a bedroom, and a bathroom fitted with every sort of
  device. A man-servant who had heard him enter, hurried from his own apartment
  across the way.</p>

  <p>"You are not dining here, sir?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I am dining late at The Sanctuary," he replied. "I just strolled over
  to see how the preparations were going on. I shall be sleeping over there,
  too. Any prowlers?"</p>

  <p>"Photographer brought some steps and photographed the horses in the park
  from the top of the wall this afternoon, sir," the man announced. "Jenkins
  let him go. Two or three pressmen sent in their cards to you, but they were
  not allowed to pass the lodge."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy nodded. Soon he left the house and crossed the park towards
  The Sanctuary. He was followed all the way by horses, of which there were
  more than thirty in the great enclosure. One mare greeted him with a neigh of
  welcome and plodded slowly after him. Another pressed her nose against his
  shoulder and walked by his side, with his hand upon her neck. Sir Timothy
  looked a little nervously around, but the park itself lay almost like a deep
  green pool, unobserved, and invisible from anywhere except the house itself.
  He spoke a few words to each of the horses, and, producing his key, passed
  through the door in the wall into The Sanctuary garden, closing it quickly as
  he recognised Francis standing under the cedar-tree.</p>

  <p>"Has Lady Cynthia arrived yet?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Francis replied. "Margaret will be here in a minute. She told
  me to say that cocktails are here and that she has ordered dinner served on
  the terrace."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" Sir Timothy murmured. "Let me try one of your
  cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"Everything ready for the great show to-morrow night?" Francis asked, as
  he served the cocktails.</p>

  <p>"Everything is in order. I wonder, really," Sir Timothy went on, looking
  at Francis curiously, "what you expect to see?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think we any of us have any definite idea," Francis replied. "We
  have all, of course, made our guesses."</p>

  <p>"You will probably be disappointed," Sir Timothy warned him. "For some
  reason or other&mdash;perhaps I have encouraged the idea&mdash;people look
  upon my parties as mysterious orgies where things take place which may not be
  spoken of. They are right to some extent. I break the law, without a doubt,
  but I break it, I am afraid, in rather a disappointing fashion."</p>

  <p>A limousine covered in dust raced in at the open gates and came to a
  standstill with a grinding of brakes. Lady Cynthia stepped lightly out and
  came across the lawn to them.</p>

  <p>"I am hot and dusty and I was disagreeable," she confided, "but the peace
  of this wonderful place, and the sight of that beautiful silver thing have
  cheered me. May I have a cocktail before I go up to change? I am a little
  late, I know," she went on, "but that wretched garden-party! I thought my
  turn would never come to receive my few words. Mother would have been
  broken-hearted if I had left without them. What slaves we are to royalty! Now
  shall I hurry and change? You men have the air of wanting your dinner, and I
  am rather that way myself. You look tired, dear host," she added, a little
  hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"The heat," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Why you ever leave this spot I can't imagine," she declared, as she
  turned away, with a lingering glance around. "It seems like Paradise to come
  here and breathe this air. London is like a furnace."</p>

  <p>The two men were alone again. In Francis' pocket were the two documents,
  which he had not yet made up his mind how to use. Margaret came out to them
  presently, and he strolled away with her towards the rose garden.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," he said, "is it my fancy or has there been a change in your
  father during the last few days?"</p>

  <p>"There is a change of some sort," she admitted. "I cannot describe it. I
  only know it is there. He seems much more thoughtful and less hard. The
  change would be an improvement," she went on, "except that somehow or other
  it makes me feel uneasy. It is as though he were grappling with some
  crisis."</p>

  <p>They came to a standstill at the end of the pergola, where the masses of
  drooping roses made the air almost faint with their perfume. Margaret
  stretched out her hand, plucked a handful of the creamy petals and held them
  against her cheek. A thrush was singing noisily. A few yards away they heard
  the soft swish of the river.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she asked curiously, "my father still speaks of you as being in
  some respects an enemy. What does he mean?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you exactly," he answered. "The first time I ever spoke to
  your father I was dining at Soto's. I was talking to Andrew Wilmore. It was
  only a short time after you had told me the story of Oliver Hilditch, a story
  which made me realise the horror of spending one's life keeping men like that
  out of the clutch of the law."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," she begged.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was talking to Andrew. I told him that in future I should accept
  no case unless I not only believed in but was convinced of the innocence of
  my client. I added that I was at war with crime. I think, perhaps, I was so
  deeply in earnest that I may have sounded a little flamboyant. At any rate,
  your father, who had overheard me, moved up to our table. I think he deduced
  from what I was saying that I was going to turn into a sort of amateur
  crime-investigator, a person who I gathered later was particularly obnoxious
  to him. At any rate, he held out a challenge. 'If you are a man who hates
  crime,' he said, or something like it, 'I am one who loves it.' He then went
  on to prophesy that a crime would be committed close to where we were, within
  an hour or so, and he challenged me to discover the assassin. That night
  Victor Bidlake was murdered just outside Soto's."</p>

  <p>"I remember! Do you mean to tell me, then," Margaret went on, with a
  little shiver, "that father told you this was going to happen?"</p>

  <p>"He certainly did," Francis replied. "How his knowledge came I am not
  sure&mdash;yet. But he certainly knew."</p>

  <p>"Have you anything else against him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There was the disappearance of Andrew Wilmore's younger brother, Reginald
  Wilmore. I have no right to connect your father with that, but Shopland, the
  Scotland Yard detective, who has charge of the case, seems to believe that
  the young man was brought into this neighbourhood, and some other indirect
  evidence which came into my hands does seem to point towards your father
  being concerned in the matter. I appealed to him at once but he only laughed
  at me. That matter, too, remains a mystery."</p>

  <p>Margaret was thoughtful for a moment. Then she turned towards the house.
  They heard the soft ringing of the gong.</p>

  <p>"Will you believe me when I tell you this?" she begged, as they passed arm
  in arm down the pergola. "I am terrified of my father, though in many ways he
  is almost princely in his generosity and in the broad view he takes of
  things. Then his kindness to all dumb animals, and the way they love him, is
  the most amazing thing I ever knew. If we were alone here to-night, every
  animal in the house would be around his chair. He has even the cats locked up
  if we have visitors, so that no one shall see it. But I am quite honest when
  I tell you this&mdash;I do not believe that my father has the ordinary
  outlook upon crime. I believe that there is a good deal more of the Old
  Testament about him than the New."</p>

  <p>"And this change which we were speaking about?" he asked, lowering his
  voice as they reached the lawn.</p>

  <p>"I believe that somehow or other the end is coming," she said. "Francis,
  forgive me if I tell you this&mdash;or rather let me be forgiven&mdash;but I
  know of one crime my father has committed, and it makes me fear that there
  may be others. And I have the feeling, somehow, that the end is close at hand
  and that he feels it, just as we might feel a thunder-storm in the air."</p>

  <p>"I am going to prove the immemorial selfishness of my sex," he whispered,
  as they drew near the little table. "Promise me one thing and I don't care if
  your father is Beelzebub himself. Promise me that, whatever happens, it shall
  not make any difference to us?"</p>

  <p>She smiled at him very wonderfully, a smile which had to take the place of
  words, for there were servants now within hearing, and Sir Timothy himself
  was standing in the doorway.</p><a name="ch32"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p>Lady Cynthia and Sir Timothy strolled after dinner to the bottom of the
  lawn and watched the punt which Francis was propelling turn from the stream
  into the river.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly idyllic," Lady Cynthia sighed.</p>

  <p>"We have another punt," her companion suggested.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am one of those unselfish people," she declared, "whose idea of repose
  is not only to rest oneself but to see others rest. I think these two chairs,
  plenty of cigarettes, and you in your most gracious and discoursive mood,
  will fill my soul with content."</p>

  <p>"Your decision relieves my mind," her companion declared, as he arranged
  the cushions behind her back. "I rather fancy myself with a pair of sculls,
  but a punt-pole never appealed to me. We will sit here and enjoy the peace.
  To-morrow night you will find it all disturbed&mdash;music and raucous voices
  and the stampede of my poor, frightened horses in the park. This is really a
  very gracious silence."</p>

  <p>"Are those two really going to marry?" Lady Cynthia asked, moving her head
  lazily in the direction of the disappearing punt.</p>

  <p>"I imagine so."</p>

  <p>"And you? What are you going to do then?"</p>

  <p>"I am planning a long cruise. I telegraphed to Southampton to-day. I am
  having my yacht provisioned and prepared. I think I shall go over to South
  America."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Alone?" she asked presently.</p>

  <p>"I am always alone," he answered.</p>

  <p>"That is rather a matter of your own choice, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so. I have always found it hard to make friends. Enemies seem to
  be more in my line."</p>

  <p>"I have not found it difficult to become your friend," she reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>"You are one of my few successes," he replied.</p>

  <p>She leaned back with half-closed eyes. There was nothing new about their
  environment&mdash;the clusters of roses, the perfume of the lilies in the
  rock garden, the even sweeter fragrance of the trim border of mignonette.
  Away in the distance, the night was made momentarily ugly by the sound of a
  gramophone on a passing launch, yet this discordant note seemed only to bring
  the perfection of present things closer. Back across the velvety lawn,
  through the feathery strips of foliage, the lights of The Sanctuary, shaded
  and subdued, were dimly visible. The dining-table under the cedar-tree had
  already been cleared. Hedges, newly arrived from town to play the major domo,
  was putting the finishing touches to a little array of cool drinks. And
  beyond, dimly seen but always there, the wall. She turned to him
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You build a wall around your life," she said, "like the wall which
  encircles your mystery house. Last night I thought that I could see a little
  way over the top. To-night you are different."</p>

  <p>"If I am different," he answered quietly, "it is because, for the first
  time for many years, I have found myself wondering whether the life I had
  planned for myself, the things which I had planned should make life for me,
  are the best. I have had doubts&mdash;perhaps I might say regrets."</p>

  <p>"I should like to go to South America," Lady Cynthia declared softly.</p>

  <p>He finished the cigarette which he was smoking and deliberately threw away
  the stump. Then he turned and looked at her. His face seemed harder than
  ever, clean-cut, the face of a man able to defy Fate, but she saw something
  in his eyes which she had never seen before.</p>

  <p>"Dear child," he said, "if I could roll back the years, if from all my
  deeds of sin, as the world knows sin, I could cancel one, there is nothing in
  the world would make me happier than to ask you to come with me as my
  cherished companion to just whatever part of the world you cared for. But I
  have been playing pitch and toss with fortune all my life, since the great
  trouble came which changed me so much. Even at this moment, the coin is in
  the air which may decide my fate."</p>

  <p>"You mean?" she ventured.</p>

  <p>"I mean," he continued, "that after the event of which we spoke last
  night, nothing in life has been more than an incident, and I have striven to
  find distraction by means which none of you&mdash;not even you, Lady Cynthia,
  with all your breadth of outlook and all your craving after new
  things&mdash;would justify."</p>

  <p>"Nothing that you may have done troubles me in the least," she assured
  him. "I do wish that you could put it all out of your mind and let me help
  you to make a fresh start."</p>

  <p>"I may put the thing itself out of my mind," he answered sadly, "but the
  consequences remain."</p>

  <p>"There is a consequence which threatens?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment. When he spoke again, he had recovered all his
  courage.</p>

  <p>"There is the coin in the air of which I spoke," he replied. "Let us
  forget it for a moment. Of the minor things I will make you my judge. Ledsam
  and Margaret are coming to my party to-morrow night. You, too, shall be my
  guest. Such secrets as lie on the other side of that wall shall be yours.
  After that, if I survive your judgment of them, and if the coin which I have
  thrown into the air comes, down to the tune I call&mdash;after that&mdash;I
  will remind you of something which happened last night&mdash;of something
  which, if I live for many years, I shall never forget."</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him. Her eyes were heavy with longing. Her arms, sweet
  and white in the dusky twilight, stole hesitatingly out.</p>

  <p>"Last night was so long ago. Won't you take a later memory?"</p>

  <p>Once again she lay in his arms, still and content.</p>

  <p>As they crossed the lawn, an hour or so later, they were confronted by
  Hedges&mdash;who hastened, in fact, to meet them.</p>

  <p>"You are being asked for on the telephone, sir," he announced. "It is a
  trunk call. I have switched it through to the study."</p>

  <p>"Any name?" Sir Timothy asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. His eyes sought his master's respectfully but charged
  with meaning.</p>

  <p>"The person refuses to give his name, sir, but I fancied that I recognised
  his voice. I think it would be as well for you to speak, sir."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>"You shall go and answer your telephone call," she said, "and leave Hedges
  to serve me with one of these strange drinks. I believe I see some of my
  favourite orangeade."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy made his way into the house and into the low, oak-beamed study
  with its dark furniture and latticed windows. The telephone bell began to
  ring again as he entered. He took up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy?" a rather hoarse, strained voice asked.</p>

  <p>"I am speaking," Sir Timothy replied. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>The man at the other end spoke as though he were out of breath.
  Nevertheless, what he said was distinct enough.</p>

  <p>"I am John Walter."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I am just ringing you up," the voice went on, "to give you what's called
  a sporting chance. There's a boat from Southampton midday tomorrow. If you're
  wise, you'll catch it. Or better still, get off on your own yacht. They carry
  a wireless now, these big steamers. Don't give a criminal much of a chance,
  does it?"</p>

  <p>"I am to understand, then," Sir Timothy said calmly, "that you have laid
  your information?"</p>

  <p>"I've parted with it and serve you right," was the bitter reply. "I'm not
  saying that you're not a brave man, Sir Timothy, but there's such a thing as
  being foolhardy, and that's what you are. I wasn't asking you for half your
  fortune, nor even a dab of it, but if your life wasn't worth a few hundred
  pounds&mdash;you, with all that money&mdash;well, it wasn't worth saving. So
  now you know. I've spent ninepence to give you a chance to hop it, because I
  met a gent who has been good to me. I've had a good dinner and I feel
  merciful. So there you are."</p>

  <p>"Do I gather," Sir Timothy asked, in a perfectly level tone, "that the
  deed is already done?"</p>

  <p>"It's already done and done thoroughly," was the uncompromising answer.
  "I'm not ringing up to ask you to change your mind. If you were to offer me
  five thousand now, or ten, I couldn't stop the bally thing. You've a sporting
  chance of getting away if you start at once. That's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>"You have nothing more to say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing! Only I wish to God I'd never stepped into that Mayfair agency. I
  wish I'd never gone to Mrs. Hilditch's as a temporary butler. I wish I'd
  never seen any one of you! That's all. You can go to Hell which way you like,
  only, if you take my advice, you'll go by the way of South America. The
  scaffold isn't every man's fancy."</p>

  <p>There was a burr of the instrument and then silence. Sir Timothy carefully
  replaced the receiver, paused on his way out of the room to smell a great
  bowl of lavender, and passed back into the garden.</p>

  <p>"More applicants for invitations?" Lady Cynthia enquired lazily.</p>

  <p>Her host smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly! Although," he added, "as a matter of fact my party would
  have been perhaps a little more complete with the presence of the person to
  whom I have been speaking."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia pointed to the stream, down which the punt was slowly
  drifting. The moon had gone behind a cloud, and Francis' figure, as he stood
  there, was undefined and ghostly. A thought seemed to flash into her mind.
  She leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Once," she said, "he told me that he was your enemy."</p>

  <p>"The term is a little melodramatic," Sir Timothy protested. "We look at
  certain things from opposite points of view. You see, my prospective
  son-in-law, if ever he becomes that, represents the law&mdash;the Law with a
  capital 'L'&mdash;which recognises no human errors or weaknesses, and judges
  crime out of the musty books of the law-givers of old. He makes of the law a
  mechanical thing which can neither bend nor give, and he judges humanity from
  the same standpoint. Yet at heart he is a good fellow and I like him."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"My weakness lies the other way," he confessed, "and my sympathy is with
  those who do not fear to make their own laws."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand, white and spectral in the momentary gloom. At the
  other end of the lawn, Francis and Margaret were disembarking from the
  punt.</p>

  <p>"Does it sound too shockingly obvious," she murmured, "if I say that I
  want to make you my law?"</p><a name="ch33"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

  <p>It would have puzzled anybody, except, perhaps, Lady Cynthia herself, to
  have detected the slightest alteration in Sir Timothy's demeanour during the
  following day, when he made fitful appearances at The Sanctuary, or at the
  dinner which was served a little earlier than usual, before his final
  departure for the scene of the festivities. Once he paused in the act of
  helping himself to some dish and listened for a moment to the sound of voices
  in the hall, and when a taxicab drove up he set down his glass and again
  betrayed some interest.</p>

  <p>"The maid with my frock, thank heavens!" Lady Cynthia announced, glancing
  out of the window. "My last anxiety is removed. I am looking forward now to a
  wonderful night."</p>

  <p>"You may very easily be disappointed," her host warned her. "My
  entertainments appeal more, as a rule, to men."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you be thoroughly original and issue no invitations to women at
  all?" Margaret enquired.</p>

  <p>"For the same reason that you adorn your rooms and the dinner-table with
  flowers," he answered. "One needs them&mdash;as a relief. Apart from that, I
  am really proud of my dancing-room, and there again, you see, your sex is
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"We are flattered," Margaret declared, with a little bow. "It does seem
  queer to think that you should own what Cynthia's cousin, Davy Hinton, once
  told me was the best floor in London, and that I have never danced on
  it."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," Lady Cynthia put in. "There might have been some excuse for not
  asking you, Margaret, but why an ultra-Bohemian like myself has had to beg
  and plead for an invitation, I really cannot imagine."</p>

  <p>"You might find," Sir Timothy said, "you may even now&mdash;that some of
  my men guests are not altogether to your liking."</p>

  <p>"Quite content to take my risk," Lady Cynthia declared cheerfully. "The
  man with the best manners I ever met&mdash;it was at one of Maggie's studio
  dances, too&mdash;was a bookmaker. And a retired prize-fighter brought me
  home once from an Albert Hall dance."</p>

  <p>"How did he behave?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>"He was wistful but restrained," Lady Cynthia replied, "quite the
  gentleman, in fact."</p>

  <p>"You encourage me to hope for the best," Sir Timothy said, rising to his
  feet. "You will excuse me now? I have a few final preparations to make."</p>

  <p>"Are we to be allowed," Margaret enquired, "to come across the park?"</p>

  <p>"You would not find it convenient," her father assured her. "You had
  better order a car, say for ten o'clock. Don't forget to bring your cards of
  invitation, and find me immediately you arrive. I wish to direct your
  proceedings to some extent."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia strolled across with him to the postern-gate and stood by his
  side after he had opened it. Several of the animals, grazing in different
  parts of the park, pricked up their ears at the sound. An old mare came
  hobbling towards him; a flea-bitten grey came trotting down the field, his
  head in the air, neighing loudly.</p>

  <p>"You waste a great deal of tenderness upon your animal friends, dear
  host," she murmured.</p>

  <p>He deliberately looked away from her.</p>

  <p>"The reciprocation, at any rate, has its disadvantages," he remarked,
  glancing a little disconsolately at the brown hairs upon his coat-sleeve. "I
  shall have to find another coat before I can receive my guests&mdash;which is
  a further reason," he added, "why I must hurry."</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the great gates of The Walled House, two men in livery
  were standing. One of them examined with care the red cards of invitation,
  and as soon as he was satisfied the gates were opened by some unseen agency.
  The moment the car had passed through, they were closed again.</p>

  <p>"Father seems thoroughly mediaeval over this business," Margaret remarked,
  looking about her with interest. "What a quaint courtyard, too! It really is
  quite Italian."</p>

  <p>"It seems almost incredible that you have never been here!" Lady Cynthia
  exclaimed. "Curiosity would have brought me if I had had to climb over the
  wall!"</p>

  <p>"It does seem absurd in one way," Margaret agreed, "but, as a matter of
  fact, my father's attitude about the place has always rather set me against
  it. I didn't feel that there was any pleasure to be gained by coming here. I
  won't tell you really what I did think. We must keep to our bargain. We are
  not to anticipate."</p>

  <p>At the front entrance, under the covered portico, the white tickets which
  they had received in exchange for their tickets of invitation, were carefully
  collected by another man, who stopped the car a few yards from the broad,
  curving steps. After that, there was no more suggestion of inhospitality. The
  front doors, which were of enormous size and height, seemed to have been
  removed, and in the great domed hall beyond Sir Timothy was already receiving
  his guests. Being without wraps, the little party made an immediate entrance.
  Sir Timothy, who was talking to one of the best-known of the foreign
  ambassadors, took a step forward to meet them.</p>

  <p>"Welcome," he said, "you, the most unique party, at least, amongst my
  guests. Prince, may I present you to my daughter, Mrs. Hilditch? Lady Cynthia
  Milton and Mr. Ledsam you know, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Your father has just been preparing me for this pleasure," the Prince
  remarked, with a smile. "I am delighted that his views as regards these
  wonderful parties are becoming a little more&mdash;would it be correct to say
  latitudinarian? He has certainly been very strict up to now."</p>

  <p>"It is the first time I have been vouchsafed an invitation," Margaret
  confessed.</p>

  <p>"You will find much to interest you," the Prince observed. "For myself, I
  love the sport of which your father is so noble a patron. That, without
  doubt, though, is a side of his entertainment of which you will know
  nothing."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy, choosing a moment's respite from the inflowing stream of
  guests, came once more across to them.</p>

  <p>"I am going to leave you, my honoured guests from The Sanctuary," he said,
  with a faint smile, "to yourselves for a short time. In the room to your
  left, supper is being served. In front is the dancing-gallery. To the right,
  as you see, is the lounge leading into the winter-garden. The gymnasium is
  closed until midnight. Any other part of the place please explore at your
  leisure, but I am going to ask you one thing. I want you to meet me in a room
  which I will show you, at a quarter to twelve."</p>

  <p>He led them down one of the corridors which opened from the hall. Before
  the first door on the right a man-servant was standing as though on sentry
  duty. Sir Timothy tapped the panel of the door with his forefinger.</p>

  <p>"This is my sanctum," he announced. "I allow no one in here without
  special permission. I find it useful to have a place to which one can come
  and rest quite quietly sometimes. Williams here has no other duty except to
  guard the entrance. Williams, you will allow this gentleman and these two
  ladies to pass in at a quarter to twelve."</p>

  <p>The man looked at them searchingly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," he said. "No one else?"</p>

  <p>"No one, under any pretext."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy hurried back to the hall, and the others followed him in more
  leisurely fashion. They were all three full of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I never dreamed," Margaret declared, as she looked around her, "that I
  should ever find myself inside this house. It has always seemed to me like
  one great bluebeard's chamber. If ever my father spoke of it at all, it was
  as of a place which he intended to convert into a sort of miniature
  Hell."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy leaned back to speak to them as they passed.</p>

  <p>"You will find a friend over there, Ledsam," he said.</p>

  <p>Wilmore turned around and faced them. The two men exchanged somewhat
  surprised greetings.</p>

  <p>"No idea that I was coming until this afternoon," Wilmore explained. "I
  got my card at five o'clock, with a note from Sir Timothy's secretary. I am
  racking my brains to imagine what it can mean."</p>

  <p>"We're all a little addled," Francis confessed. "Come and join our tour of
  exploration. You know Lady Cynthia. Let me present you to Mrs. Hilditch."</p>

  <p>The introduction was effected and they all, strolled on together. Margaret
  and Lady Cynthia led the way into the winter-garden, a palace of glass, tall
  palms, banks of exotics, flowering shrubs of every description, and a
  fountain, with wonderfully carved water nymphs, brought with its basin from
  Italy. Hidden in the foliage, a small orchestra was playing very softly. The
  atmosphere of the place was languorous and delicious.</p>

  <p>"Leave us here," Margaret insisted, with a little exclamation of content.
  "Neither Cynthia nor I want to go any further. Come back and fetch us in time
  for our appointment."</p>

  <p>The two men wandered off. The place was indeed a marvel of architecture, a
  country house, of which only the shell remained, modernised and made
  wonderful by the genius of a great architect. The first room which they
  entered when they left the winter-garden, was as large as a small restaurant,
  panelled in cream colour, with a marvellous ceiling. There were tables of
  various sizes laid for supper, rows of champagne bottles in ice buckets, and
  servants eagerly waiting for orders. Already a sprinkling of the guests had
  found their way here. The two men crossed the floor to the cocktail bar in
  the far corner, behind which a familiar face grinned at them. It was Jimmy,
  the bartender from Soto's, who stood there with a wonderful array of bottles
  on a walnut table.</p>

  <p>"If it were not a perfectly fatuous question, I should ask what you were
  doing here, Jimmy?" Francis remarked.</p>

  <p>"I always come for Sir Timothy's big parties, sir," Jimmy explained. "Your
  first visit, isn't it, sir?"</p>

  <p>"My first," Francis assented.</p>

  <p>"And mine," his companion echoed.</p>

  <p>"What can I have the pleasure of making for you, sir?" the man
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"A difficult question," Francis admitted. "It is barely an hour and a half
  since we finished diner. On the other hand, we are certainly going to have
  some supper some time or other."</p>

  <p>Jimmy nodded understandingly.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me, sir," he begged.</p>

  <p>He served them with a foaming white concoction in tall glasses. A genuine
  lime bobbed up and down in the liquid.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy has the limes sent over from his own estate in South
  America," Jimmy announced. "You will find some things in that drink you don't
  often taste."</p>

  <p>The two men sipped their beverage and pronounced it delightful. Jimmy
  leaned a little across the table.</p>

  <p>"A big thing on to-night, isn't there, sir?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Is there?" Francis replied. "You mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy motioned towards the open window, close to which the river was
  flowing by.</p>

  <p>"You going down, sir?"</p>

  <p>Francis shook his head dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>The bartender looked with narrowed eyes from one to the other of the two
  men. Then he suddenly froze up. Wilmore leaned a little further over the
  impromptu counter.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy," he asked, "what goes on here besides dancing and boxing and
  gambling?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard of any gambling," Jimmy answered, shaking his head. "Sir
  Timothy doesn't care about cards being played here at all."</p>

  <p>"What is the principal entertainment, then?" Francis demanded. "The
  boxing?"</p>

  <p>The bartender shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No one understands very much about this house, sir," he said, "except
  that it offers the most wonderful entertainment in Europe. That is for the
  guests to find out, though. We servants have to attend to our duties. Will
  you let me mix you another drink, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," Francis answered. "The last was too good to spoil. But you
  haven't answered my question, Jimmy. What did you mean when you asked if we
  were going down?"</p>

  <p>Jimmy's face had become wooden.</p>

  <p>"I meant nothing, sir," he said. "Sorry I spoke."</p>

  <p>The two men turned away. They recognised many acquaintances in the
  supper-room, and in the long gallery beyond, where many couples were dancing
  now to the music of a wonderful orchestra. By slow stages they made their way
  back to the winter-garden, where Lady Cynthia and Margaret were still lost in
  admiration of their surroundings. They all walked the whole length of the
  place. Beyond, down a flight of stone steps, was a short, paved way to the
  river. A large electric launch was moored at the quay. The grounds outside
  were dimly illuminated with cunningly-hidden electric lights shining through
  purple-coloured globes into the cloudy darkness. In the background,
  enveloping the whole of the house and reaching to the river on either side,
  the great wall loomed up, unlit, menacing almost in its suggestions. A couple
  of loiterers stood within a few yards of them, looking at the launch.</p>

  <p>"There she is, ready for her errand, whatever it may be," one said to the
  other curiously. "We couldn't play the stowaway, I suppose, could we?"</p>

  <p>"Dicky Bell did that once," the other answered. "Sir Timothy has only one
  way with intruders. He was thrown into the river and jolly nearly
  drowned."</p>

  <p>The two men passed out of hearing.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what part the launch plays in the night's entertainment,"
  Wilmore observed.</p>

  <p>Francis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I have given up wondering," he said. "Margaret, do you hear that
  music?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Are we really to dance?" she murmured. "Do you want to make a girl of me
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I shouldn't be a magician, should I?" he answered.</p>

  <p>They passed into the ballroom and danced for some time. The music was
  seductive and perfect, without any of the blatant notes of too many of the
  popular orchestras. The floor seemed to sway under their feet.</p>

  <p>"This is a new joy come back into life!" Margaret exclaimed, as they
  rested for a moment.</p>

  <p>"The first of many," he assured her.</p>

  <p>They stood in the archway between the winter-garden and the
  dancing-gallery, from which they could command a view of the passing crowds.
  Francis scanned the faces of the men and women with intense interest. Many of
  them were known to him by sight, others were strangers. There was a judge, a
  Cabinet Minister, various members of the aristocracy, a sprinkling from the
  foreign legations, and although the stage was not largely represented, there
  were one or two well-known actors. The guests seemed to belong to no
  universal social order, but to Francis, watching them almost eagerly, they
  all seemed to have something of the same expression, the same slight air of
  weariness, of restless and unsatisfied desires.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that the place is real, or that these people we see are
  not supers," Margaret whispered.</p>

  <p>"I feel every moment that a clock will strike and that it will all fade
  away."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm too material for such imaginings," Francis replied, "but
  there is a quaintly artificial air about it all. We must go and look for
  Wilmore and Lady Cynthia."</p>

  <p>They turned back into the enervating atmosphere of the winter-garden, and
  came suddenly face to face with Sir Timothy, who had escorted a little party
  of his guests to see the fountain, and was now returning alone.</p>

  <p>"You have been dancing, I am glad to see," the latter observed. "I trust
  that you are amusing yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"Excellently, thank you," Francis replied.</p>

  <p>"And so far," Sir Timothy went on, with a faint smile, "you find my
  entertainment normal? You have no question yet which you would like to
  ask?"</p>

  <p>"Only one&mdash;what do you do with your launch up the river on moonless
  nights, Sir Timothy?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy's momentary silence was full of ominous significance.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ledsam," he said, after a brief pause, "I have given you almost carte
  blanche to explore my domains here. Concerning the launch, however, I think
  that you had better ask no questions at present."</p>

  <p>"You are using it to-night?" Francis persisted.</p>

  <p>"Will you come and see, my venturesome guest?"</p>

  <p>"With great pleasure," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"That," he said, "is one of the matters of which we will speak at a
  quarter to twelve. Meanwhile, let me show you something. It may amuse you as
  it has done me."</p>

  <p>The three moved back towards one of the arched openings which led into the
  ballroom.</p>

  <p>"Observe, if you please," their host continued, "the third couple who pass
  us. The girl is wearing green&mdash;the very little that she does wear. Watch
  the man, and see if he reminds you of any one."</p>

  <p>Francis did as he was bidden. The girl was a well-known member of the
  chorus of one of the principal musical comedies, and she seemed to be
  thoroughly enjoying both the dance and her partner. The latter appeared to be
  of a somewhat ordinary type, sallow, with rather puffy cheeks, and eyes
  almost unnaturally dark. He danced vigorously and he talked all the time.
  Something about him was vaguely familiar to Francis, but he failed to place
  him.</p>

  <p>"Notwithstanding all my precautions," Sir Timothy continued, "there,
  fondly believing himself to be unnoticed, is an emissary of Scotland Yard.
  Really, of all the obvious, the dry-as-dust,
  hunt-your-criminal-by-rule-of-three kind of people I ever met, the class of
  detective to which this man belongs can produce the most blatant
  examples."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about him?" Francis asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I have not yet made up my mind," he said. "I happen to know that he has
  been laying his plans for weeks to get here, frequenting Soto's and other
  restaurants, and scraping acquaintances with some of my friends. The Duke of
  Tadchester brought him&mdash;won a few hundreds from him at baccarat, I
  suppose. His grace will never again find these doors open to him."</p>

  <p>Francis' attention had wandered. He was gazing fixedly at the man whom Sir
  Timothy had pointed out.</p>

  <p>"You still do not fully recognise our friend," the latter observed
  carelessly. "He calls himself Manuel Loito, and he professes to be a Cuban.
  His real name I understood, when you introduced us, to be Shopland."</p>

  <p>"Great heavens, so it is!" Francis exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Let us leave him to his precarious pleasures," Sir Timothy suggested. "I
  am free for a few moments. We will wander round together."</p>

  <p>They found Lady Cynthia and Wilmore, and looked in at the supper-room,
  where people were waiting now for tables, a babel of sound and gaiety. The
  grounds and winter-gardens were crowded. Their guide led the way to a large
  apartment on the other side of the hall, from which the sound of music was
  proceeding.</p>

  <p>"My theatre," he said. "I wonder what is going on."</p>

  <p>They passed inside. There was a small stage with steps leading down to the
  floor, easy-chairs and round tables everywhere, and waiters serving
  refreshments. A girl was dancing. Sir Timothy watched her approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Nadia Ellistoff," he told them. "She was in the last Russian ballet, and
  she is waiting now for the rest of the company to start again at Covent
  Garden. You see, it is Metzger who plays there. They improvise. Rather a
  wonderful performance, I think."</p>

  <p>They watched her breathlessly, a spirit in grey tulle, with great black
  eyes now and then half closed.</p>

  <p>"It is 'Wind before Dawn,'" Lady Cynthia whispered. "I heard him play it
  two days after he composed it, only there are variations now. She is the soul
  of the south wind."</p>

  <p>The curtain went down amidst rapturous applause. The dancer had left the
  stage, floating away into some sort of wonderfully-contrived nebulous
  background. Within a few moments, the principal comedian of the day was
  telling stories. Sir Timothy led them away.</p>

  <p>"But how on earth do you get all these people?" Lady Cynthia asked.</p>

  <p>"It is arranged for me," Sir Timothy replied. "I have an agent who sees to
  it all. Every man or woman who is asked to perform, has a credit at Cartier's
  for a hundred guineas. I pay no fees. They select some little keepsake."</p>

  <p>Margaret laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"No wonder they call this place a sort of Arabian Nights!" she
  declared.</p>

  <p>"Well, there isn't much else for you to see," Sir Timothy said
  thoughtfully. "My gymnasium, which is one of the principal features here, is
  closed just now for a special performance, of which I will speak in a moment.
  The concert hall I see they are using for an overflow dance-room. What you
  have seen, with the grounds and the winter-garden, comprises almost
  everything."</p>

  <p>They moved back through the hall with difficulty. People were now crowding
  in. Lady Cynthia laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Why, it is like a gala night at the Opera, Sir Timothy!" she exclaimed.
  "How dare you pretend that this is Bohemia!"</p>

  <p>"It has never been I who have described my entertainments," he reminded
  her. "They have been called everything&mdash;orgies,
  debauches&mdash;everything you can think of. I have never ventured myself to
  describe them."</p>

  <p>Their passage was difficult. Every now and then Sir Timothy was compelled
  to shake hands with some of his newly-arriving guests. At last, however, they
  reached the little sitting-room. Sir Timothy turned back to Wilmore, who
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You had better come in, too, Mr. Wilmore, if you will," he invited. "You
  were with Ledsam, the first day we met, and something which I have to say now
  may interest you."</p>

  <p>"If I am not intruding," Wilmore murmured.</p>

  <p>They entered the room, still jealously guarded. Sir Timothy closed the
  door behind them.</p><a name="ch34"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

  <p>The apartment was one belonging to the older portion of the house, and had
  been, in fact, an annex to the great library. The walls were oak-panelled,
  and hung with a collection of old prints. There were some easy-chairs, a
  writing-table, and some well-laden bookcases. There were one or two bronze
  statues of gladiators, a wonderful study of two wrestlers, no minor
  ornaments. Sir Timothy plunged at once into what he had to say.</p>

  <p>"I promised you, Lady Cynthia, and you, Ledsam," he said, "to divulge
  exactly the truth as regards these much-talked-of entertainments here. You,
  Margaret, under present circumstances, are equally interested. You, Wilmore,
  are Ledsam's friend, and you happen to have an interest in this particular
  party. Therefore, I am glad to have you all here together. The superficial
  part of my entertainment you have seen. The part which renders it necessary
  for me to keep closed doors, I shall now explain. I give prizes here of
  considerable value for boxing contests which are conducted under rules of our
  own. One is due to take place in a very few minutes. The contests vary in
  character, but I may say that the chief officials of the National Sporting
  Club are usually to be found here, only, of course, in an unofficial
  capacity. The difference between the contests arranged by me, and others, is
  that my men are here to fight. They use sometimes an illegal weight of glove
  and they sometimes hurt one another. If any two of the boxing fraternity have
  a grudge against one another, and that often happens, they are permitted here
  to fight it out, under the strictest control as regards fairness, but
  practically without gloves at all. You heard of the accident, for instance,
  to Norris? That happened in my gymnasium. He was knocked out by Burgin. It
  was a wonderful fight.</p>

  <p>"However, I pass on. There is another class of contest which frequently
  takes place here. Two boxers place themselves unreservedly in my hands. The
  details of the match are arranged without their knowledge. They come into the
  ring without knowing whom they are going to fight. Sometimes they never know,
  for my men wear masks. Then we have private matches. There is one to-night.
  Lord Meadowson and I have a wager of a thousand guineas. He has brought
  to-night from the East End a boxer who, according to the terms of our bet,
  has never before engaged in a professional contest. I have brought an amateur
  under the same conditions. The weight is within a few pounds the same,
  neither has ever seen the other, only in this case the fight is with
  regulation gloves and under Queensberry rules."</p>

  <p>"Who is your amateur, Sir Timothy?" Wilmore asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"Your brother, Mr. Wilmore," was the prompt reply. "You shall see the
  fight if I have your promise not to attempt in any way to interfere."</p>

  <p>Wilmore rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me," he demanded, "that my brother has been decoyed
  here, kept here against his will, to provide amusement for your guests?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wilmore, I beg that you will be reasonable," Sir Timothy
  expostulated. "I saw your brother box at his gymnasium in Holborn. My agent
  made him the offer of this fight. One of my conditions had to be that he came
  here to train and that whilst he was here he held no communication whatever
  with the outside world. My trainer has ideas of his own and this he insists
  upon. Your brother in the end acquiesced. He was at first difficult to deal
  with as regards this condition, and he did, in fact, I believe, Mr. Ledsam,
  pay a visit to your office, with the object of asking you to become an
  intermediary between him and his relatives."</p>

  <p>"He began a letter to me," Francis interposed, "and then mysteriously
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"The mystery is easily explained," Sir Timothy continued. "My trainer,
  Roger Hagon, a Varsity blue, and the best heavyweight of his year, occupies
  the chambers above yours. He saw from the window the arrival of Reginald
  Wilmore&mdash;which was according to instructions, as they were to come down
  to Hatch End together&mdash;went down the stairs to meet him, and, to cut a
  long story short, fetched him out of your office, Ledsam, without allowing
  him to finish his letter. This absolute isolation seems a curious condition,
  perhaps, but Hagon insists upon it, and I can assure you that he knows his
  business. The mystery, as you have termed it, of his disappearance that
  morning, is that he went upstairs with Hagon for several hours to undergo a
  medical examination, instead of leaving the building forthwith."</p>

  <p>"Queer thing I never thought of Hagon," Francis remarked. "As a matter of
  fact, I never see him in the Temple, and I thought that he had left."</p>

  <p>"May I ask," Wilmore intervened, "when my brother will be free to return
  to his home?"</p>

  <p>"To-night, directly the fight is over," Sir Timothy replied. "Should he be
  successful, he will take with him a sum of money sufficient to start him in
  any business he chooses to enter."</p>

  <p>Wilmore frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"But surely," he protested, "that would make him a professional
  pugilist?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Sir Timothy replied. "For one thing, the match is a private
  one in a private house, and for another the money is a gift. There is no
  purse. If your brother loses, he gets nothing. Will you see the fight, Mr.
  Wilmore?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will see it," was the somewhat reluctant assent.</p>

  <p>"You will give me your word not to interfere in any way?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not interfere," Wilmore promised. "If they are wearing regulation
  gloves, and the weights are about equal, and the conditions are what you say,
  it is the last thing I should wish to do."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" Sir Timothy exclaimed. "Now to pass on. There is one other
  feature of my entertainments concerning which I have something to say&mdash;a
  series of performances which takes place on my launch at odd times. There is
  one fixed for tonight. I can say little about it except that it is unusual. I
  am going to ask you, Lady Cynthia, and you, Ledsam, to witness it. When you
  have seen that, you know everything. Then you and I, Ledsam, can call one
  another's hands. I shall have something else to say to you, but that is
  outside the doings here."</p>

  <p>"Are we to see the fight in the gymnasium?" Lady Cynthia enquired.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not allow women there under any conditions," he said. "You and
  Margaret had better stay here whilst that takes place. It will probably be
  over in twenty minutes. It will be time then for us to find our way to the
  launch. After that, if you have any appetite, supper. I will order some
  caviare sandwiches for you," Sir Timothy went on, ringing the bell, "and some
  wine."</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is really a very wonderful party," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Their host ushered the two men across the hall, now comparatively
  deserted, for every one had settled down to his or her chosen
  amusement&mdash;down a long passage, through a private door which he unlocked
  with a Yale key, and into the gymnasium. There were less than fifty
  spectators seated around the ring, and Francis, glancing at them hastily,
  fancied that he recognised nearly every one of them. There was Baker, a
  judge, a couple of actors, Lord Meadowson, the most renowned of sporting
  peers, and a dozen who followed in his footsteps; a little man who had once
  been amateur champion in the bantam class, and who was now considered the
  finest judge of boxing in the world; a theatrical manager, the present
  amateur boxing champion, and a sprinkling of others. Sir Timothy and his
  companions took their chairs amidst a buzz of welcome. Almost immediately,
  the man who was in charge of the proceedings, and whose name was Harrison,
  rose from his place.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "this is a sporting contest, but one under usual
  rules and usual conditions. An amateur, who tips the scales at twelve stone
  seven, who has never engaged in a boxing contest in his life, is matched
  against a young man from a different sphere of life, who intends to adopt the
  ring as his profession, but who has never as yet fought in public. Names,
  gentlemen, as you know, are seldom mentioned here. I will only say that the
  first in the ring is the nominee of our friend and host, Sir Timothy Brast;
  second comes the nominee of Lord Meadowson."</p>

  <p>Wilmore, notwithstanding his pre-knowledge, gave a little gasp. The young
  man who stood now within a few yards of him, carelessly swinging his gloves
  in his hand, was without a doubt his missing brother. He looked well and in
  the pink of condition; not only well but entirely confident and at his ease.
  His opponent, on the other hand, a sturdier man, a few inches shorter, was
  nervous and awkward, though none the less determined-looking. Sir Timothy
  rose and whispered in Harrison's ear. The latter nodded. In a very few
  moments the preliminaries were concluded, the fight begun.</p><a name="ch35"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

  <p>Francis, glad of a moment or two's solitude in which to rearrange his
  somewhat distorted sensations, found an empty space in the stern of the
  launch and stood leaning over the rail. His pulses were still tingling with
  the indubitable excitement of the last half-hour. It was all there, even now,
  before his eyes like a cinematograph picture&mdash;the duel between those two
  men, a duel of knowledge, of strength, of science, of courage. From beginning
  to end, there had been no moment when Francis had felt that he was looking on
  at what was in any way a degrading or immoral spectacle. Each man had fought
  in his way to win. Young Wilmore, graceful as a panther, with a keen, joyous
  desire of youth for supremacy written in his face and in the dogged lines of
  his mouth; the budding champion from the East End less graceful, perhaps, but
  with even more strength and at least as much determination, had certainly
  done his best to justify his selection. There were no points to be scored.
  There had been no undue feinting, no holding, few of the tricks of the
  professional ring. It was a fight to a finish, or until Harrison gave the
  word. And the better man had won. But even that knock-out blow which Reggie
  Wilmore had delivered after a wonderful feint, had had little that was cruel
  in it. There was something beautiful almost in the strength and grace with
  which it had been delivered&mdash;the breathless eagerness, the waiting, the
  end.</p>

  <p>Francis felt a touch upon his arm and looked around. A tall, sad-faced
  looking woman, whom he had noticed with a vague sense of familiarity in the
  dancing-room, was standing by his side.</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten me, Mr. Ledsam," she said.</p>

  <p>"For the moment," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I am Isabel Culbridge," she told him, watching his face.</p>

  <p>"Lady Isabel?" Francis repeated incredulously. "But surely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Better not contradict me," she interrupted. "Look again."</p>

  <p>Francis looked again.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," he said. "It is some time, is it not, since we
  met?"</p>

  <p>She stood by his side, and for a few moments neither of them spoke. The
  little orchestra in the bows had commenced to play softly, but there was none
  of the merriment amongst the handful of men and women generally associated
  with a midnight river picnic. The moon was temporarily obscured, and it
  seemed as though some artist's hand had so dealt with the few electric lights
  that the men, with their pale faces and white shirt-fronts, and the three or
  four women, most of them, as it happened, wearing black, were like some
  ghostly figures in some sombre procession. Only the music kept up the
  pretence that this was in any way an ordinary excursion. Amongst the human
  element there was an air of tenseness which seemed rather to increase as they
  passed into the shadowy reaches of the river.</p>

  <p>"You have been ill, I am afraid?" Francis said tentatively.</p>

  <p>"If you will," she answered, "but my illness is of the soul. I have become
  one of a type," she went on, "of which you will find many examples here. We
  started life thinking that it was clever to despise the conventional and the
  known and to seek always for the daring and the unknown. New experiences were
  what we craved for. I married a wonderful husband. I broke his heart and
  still looked for new things. I had a daughter of whom I was fond&mdash;she
  ran away with my chauffeur and left me; a son whom I adored, and he was
  killed in the war; a lover who told me that he worshipped me, who spent every
  penny I had and made me the laughing-stock of town. I am still looking for
  new things."</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy's parties are generally supposed to provide them," Francis
  observed.</p>

  <p>The woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"So far they seem very much like anybody's else," she said. "The fight
  might have been amusing, but no women were allowed. The rest was very
  wonderful in its way, but that is all. I am still hoping for what we are to
  see downstairs."</p>

  <p>They heard Sir Timothy's voice a few yards away, and turned to look at
  him. He had just come from below, and had paused opposite a man who had been
  standing a little apart from the others, one of the few who was wearing an
  overcoat, as though he felt the cold. In the background were the two servants
  who had guarded the gangway.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Manuel Loito," Sir Timothy said&mdash;"or shall I say Mr.
  Shopland?&mdash;my invited guests are welcome. I have only one method of
  dealing with uninvited ones."</p>

  <p>The two men suddenly stepped forward. Shopland made no protest, attempted
  no struggle. They lifted him off his feet as though he were a baby, and a
  moment later there was a splash in the water. They threw a life-belt after
  him.</p>

  <p>"Always humane, you see," Sir Timothy remarked, as he leaned over the
  side. "Ah! I see that even in his overcoat our friend is swimmer enough to
  reach the bank. You find our methods harsh, Ledsam?" he asked, turning a
  challenging gaze towards the latter.</p>

  <p>Francis, who had been watching Shopland come to the surface, shrugged his
  shoulders. He delayed answering for a moment while he watched the detective,
  disdaining the life-belt, swim to the opposite shore.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that under the circumstances," Francis said, "he was prepared
  to take his risk."</p>

  <p>"You should know best about that," Sir Timothy rejoined. "I wonder whether
  you would mind looking after Lady Cynthia? I shall be busy for a few
  moments."</p>

  <p>Francis stepped across the deck towards where Lady Cynthia had been
  sitting by her host's side. They had passed into the mouth of a tree-hung
  strip of the river. The engine was suddenly shut off. A gong was sounded.
  There was a murmur, almost a sob of relief, as the little sprinkling of men
  and women rose hastily to their feet and made their way towards the
  companion-way. Downstairs, in the saloon, with its white satinwood panels and
  rows of swing chairs, heavy curtains were drawn across the portholes, all
  outside light was shut out from the place. At the further end, raised
  slightly from the floor, was a sanded circle. Sir Timothy made his way to one
  of the pillars by its side and turned around to face the little company of
  his guests. His voice, though it seemed scarcely raised above a whisper, was
  extraordinarily clear and distinct. Even Francis, who, with Lady Cynthia, had
  found seats only just inside the door, could hear every word he said.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he began, "you have often before been my guests at such
  small fights as we have been able to arrange in as unorthodox a manner as
  possible between professional boxers. There has been some novelty about them,
  but on the last occasion I think it was generally observed that they had
  become a little too professional, a little ultra-scientific. There was
  something which they lacked. With that something I am hoping to provide you
  to-night. Thank you, Sir Edgar," he murmured, leaning down towards his
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>He held his cigarette in the flame of a match which the other had kindled.
  Francis, who was watching intently, was puzzled at the expression with which
  for a moment, as he straightened himself, Sir Timothy glanced down the room,
  seeking for Lady Cynthia's eyes. In a sense it was as though he were seeking
  for something he needed&mdash;approbation, sympathy, understanding.</p>

  <p>"Our hobby, as you know, has been reality," he continued. "That is what we
  have not always been able to achieve. Tonight I offer you reality. There are
  two men here, one an East End coster, the other an Italian until lately
  associated with an itinerant vehicle of musical production. These two men
  have not outlived sensation as I fancy so many of us have. They hate one
  another to the death. I forget their surnames, but Guiseppe has stolen Jim's
  girl, is living with her at the present moment, and proposes to keep her. Jim
  has sworn to have the lives of both of them. Jim's career, in its way, is
  interesting to us. He has spent already six years in prison for manslaughter,
  and a year for a brutal assault upon a constable. Guiseppe was tried in his
  native country for a particularly fiendish murder, and escaped, owing, I
  believe, to some legal technicality. That, however, has nothing to do with
  the matter. These men have sworn to fight to the death, and the girl, I
  understand, is willing to return to Jim if he should be successful, or to
  remain with Guiseppe if he should show himself able to retain her. The fight
  between these men, my friends, has been transferred from Seven Dials for your
  entertainment. It will take place before you here and now."</p>

  <p>There was a little shiver amongst the audience. Francis, almost to his
  horror, was unable to resist the feeling of queer excitement which stole
  through his veins. A few yards away, Lady Isabel seemed to have become
  transformed. She was leaning forward in her chair, her eyes glowing, her lips
  parted, rejuvenated, dehumanised. Francis' immediate companion, however,
  rather surprised him. Her eyes were fixed intently upon Sir Timothy's. She
  seemed to have been weighing every word he had spoken. There was none of that
  hungry pleasure in her face which shone from the other woman's and was
  reflected in the faces of many of the others. She seemed to be bracing
  herself for a shock. Sir Timothy looked over his shoulder towards the door
  which opened upon the sanded space.</p>

  <p>"You can bring your men along," he directed.</p>

  <p>One of the attendants promptly made his appearance. He was holding tightly
  by the arm a man of apparently thirty years of age, shabbily dressed,
  barefooted, without collar or necktie, with a mass of black hair which looked
  as though it had escaped the care of any barber for many weeks. His
  complexion was sallow; he had high cheekbones and a receding chin, which gave
  him rather the appearance of a fox. He shrank a little from the lights as
  though they hurt his eyes, and all the time he looked furtively back to the
  door, through which in a moment or two his rival was presently escorted. The
  latter was a young man of stockier build, ill-conditioned, and with the
  brutal face of the lowest of his class. Two of his front teeth were missing,
  and there was a livid mark on the side of his cheek. He looked neither to the
  right nor to the left. His eyes were fixed upon the other man, and they
  looked death.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who first appeared," Sir Timothy observed, stepping up into
  the sanded space but still half facing the audience, "is Guiseppe, the
  Lothario of this little act. The other is Jim, the wronged husband. You know
  their story. Now, Jim," he added, turning towards the Englishman, "I put in
  your trousers pocket these notes, two hundred pounds, you will perceive. I
  place in the trousers pocket of Guiseppe here notes to the same amount. I
  understand you have a little quarrel to fight out. The one who wins will
  naturally help himself to the other's money, together with that other little
  reward which I imagine was the first cause of your quarrel. Now... let them
  go."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy resumed his seat and leaned back in leisurely fashion. The two
  attendants solemnly released their captives. There was a moment's intense
  silence. The two men seemed fencing for position. There was something
  stealthy and horrible about their movements as they crept around one another.
  Francis realised what it was almost as the little sobbing breath from those
  of the audience who still retained any emotion, showed him that they, too,
  foresaw what was going to happen. Both men had drawn knives from their belts.
  It was murder which had been let loose.</p>

  <p>Francis found himself almost immediately upon his feet. His whole being
  seemed crying out for interference. Lady Cynthia's death-white face and
  pleading eyes seemed like the echo of his own passionate aversion to what was
  taking place. Then he met Sir Timothy's gaze across the room and he
  remembered his promise. Under no conditions was he to protest or interfere.
  He set his teeth and resumed his seat. The fight went on. There were little
  sobs and tremors of excitement, strange banks of silence. Both men seemed out
  of condition. The sound of their hoarse breathing was easily heard against
  the curtain of spellbound silence. For a time their knives stabbed the empty
  air, but from the first the end seemed certain. The Englishman attacked
  wildly. His adversary waited his time, content with avoiding the murderous
  blows struck at him, striving all the time to steal underneath the other's
  guard. And then, almost without warning, it was all over. Jim was on his back
  in a crumpled heap. There was a horrid stain upon his coat. The other man was
  kneeling by his side, hate, glaring out of his eyes, guiding all the time the
  rising and falling of his knife. There was one more shriek&mdash;then silence
  only the sound of the victor's breathing as he rose slowly from his ghastly
  task. Sir Timothy rose to his feet and waved his hand. The curtain went
  down.</p>

  <p>"On deck, if you please, ladies and gentlemen," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>No one stirred. A woman began to sob. A fat, unhealthy-looking man in
  front of Francis reeled over in a dead faint. Two other of the guests near
  had risen from their seats and were shouting aimlessly like lunatics. Even
  Francis was conscious of that temporary imprisonment of the body due to his
  lacerated nerves. Only the clinging of Lady Cynthia to his arm kept him from
  rushing from the spot.</p>

  <p>"You are faint?" he whispered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Upstairs&mdash;air," she faltered.</p>

  <p>They rose to their feet. The sound of Sir Timothy's voice reached them as
  they ascended the stairs.</p>

  <p>"On deck, every one, if you please," he insisted. "Refreshments are being
  served there. There are inquisitive people who watch my launch, and it is
  inadvisable to remain here long."</p>

  <p>People hurried out then as though their one desire was to escape from the
  scene of the tragedy. Lady Cynthia, still clinging to Francis' arm, led him
  to the furthermost corner of the launch. There were real tears in her eyes,
  her breath was coming in little sobs.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was horrible!" she cried. "Horrible! Mr. Ledsam&mdash;I can't help
  it&mdash;I never want to speak to Sir Timothy again!"</p>

  <p>One final horror arrested for a moment the sound of voices. There was a
  dull splash in the river. Something had been thrown overboard. The orchestra
  began to play dance music. Conversation suddenly burst out. Every one was
  hysterical. A Peer of the Realm, red-eyed and shaking like an aspen leaf, was
  drinking champagne out of the bottle. Every one seemed to be trying to outvie
  the other in loud conversation, in outrageous mirth. Lady Isabel, with a
  glass of champagne in her hand, leaned back towards Francis.</p>

  <p>"Well," she asked, "how are you feeling, Mr. Ledsam?"</p>

  <p>"As though I had spent half-an-hour in Hell," he answered.</p>

  <p>She screamed with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Hear this man," she called out, "who will send any poor ragamuffin to the
  gallows if his fee is large enough! Of course," she added, turning back to
  him, "I ought to remember you are a normal person and to-night's
  entertainment was not for normal persons. For myself I am grateful to Sir
  Timothy. For a few moments of this aching aftermath of life, I forgot."</p>

  <p>Suddenly all the lights around the launch flamed out, the music stopped.
  Sir Timothy came up on deck. On either side of him was a man in ordinary
  dinner clothes. The babel of voices ceased. Everyone was oppressed by some
  vague likeness. A breathless silence ensued.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," Sir Timothy said, and once more the smile upon his
  lips assumed its most mocking curve, "let me introduce you to the two artists
  who have given us to-night such a realistic performance, Signor Guiseppe
  Elito and Signor Carlos Marlini. I had the good fortune," he went on, "to
  witness this very marvellous performance in a small music-hall at Palermo,
  and I was able to induce the two actors to pay us a visit over here. Steward,
  these gentlemen will take a glass of champagne."</p>

  <p>The two Sicilians raised their glasses and bowed expectantly to the little
  company. They received, however, a much greater tribute to their performance
  than the applause which they had been expecting. There reigned everywhere a
  deadly, stupefied silence. Only a half-stifled sob broke from Lady Cynthia's
  lips as she leaned over the rail, her face buried in her hands, her whole
  frame shaking.</p><a name="ch36"

  <h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

  <p>Francis and Margaret sat in the rose garden on the following morning.
  Their conversation was a little disjointed, as the conversation of lovers in
  a secluded and beautiful spot should be, but they came back often to the
  subject of Sir Timothy.</p>

  <p>"If I have misunderstood your father," Francis, declared, "and I admit
  that I have, it has been to some extent his own fault. To me he was always
  the deliberate scoffer against any code of morals, a rebel against the law
  even if not a criminal in actual deeds. I honestly believed that The Walled
  House was the scene of disreputable orgies, that your father was behind
  Fairfax in that cold-blooded murder, and that he was responsible in some
  sinister way for the disappearance of Reggie Wilmore. Most of these things
  seem to have been shams, like the fight last night."</p>

  <p>She moved uneasily in her place.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I did not see that," she said, with a shiver.</p>

  <p>"I think," he went on, "that the reason why your father insisted upon Lady
  Cynthia's and my presence there was that he meant it as a sort of allegory.
  Half the vices in life he claims are unreal."</p>

  <p>Margaret passed her arm through his and leaned a little towards him.</p>

  <p>"If you knew just one thing I have never told you," she confided, "I think
  that you would feel sorry for him. I do, more and more every day, because in
  a way that one thing is my fault."</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the warm sunshine, she suddenly shivered. Francis took her
  hands in his. They were cold and lifeless.</p>

  <p>"I know that one thing, dear," he told her quietly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him stonily. There was a questioning fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know that your fattier killed Oliver Hilditch."</p>

  <p>She suddenly broke out into a stream of words. There was passion in her
  tone and in her eyes. She was almost the accuser.</p>

  <p>"My father was right, then!" she exclaimed. "He told me this morning that
  he believed that it was to you or to your friend at Scotland Yard that Walter
  had told his story. But you don't know you don't know how terrible the
  temptation was how&mdash;you see I say it quite coolly&mdash;how Oliver
  Hilditch deserved to die. He was trusted by my father in South America and he
  deceived him, he forged the letters which induced me to marry him. It was
  part of his scheme of revenge. This was the first time we had any of us met
  since. I told my father the truth that afternoon. He knew for the first time
  how my marriage came about. My husband had prayed me to keep silent. I
  refused. Then he became like a devil. We were there, we three, that night
  after you left, and Francis, as I live, if my father had not killed him, I
  should have!"</p>

  <p>"There was a time when I believed that you had," he reminded her. "I
  didn't behave like a pedagogic upholder of the letter of the law then, did
  I?"</p>

  <p>She drew closer to him.</p>

  <p>"You were wonderful," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Dearest, your father has nothing to fear from me," he assured her
  tenderly. "On the contrary, I think that I can show him the way to
  safety."</p>

  <p>She rose impulsively to her feet.</p>

  <p>"He will be here directly," she said. "He promised to come across at
  half-past twelve. Let us go and meet him. But, Francis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For a single moment she crept into his arms. Their lips met, her eyes
  shone into his. He held her away from him a moment later. The change was
  amazing. She was no longer a tired woman. She had become a girl again. Her
  eyes were soft with happiness, the little lines had gone from about her
  mouth, she walked with all the spring of youth and happiness.</p>

  <p>"It is marvellous," she whispered. "I never dreamed that I should ever be
  happy again."</p>

  <p>They crossed the rustic bridge which led on to the lawn. Lady Cynthia came
  out of the house to meet them. She showed no signs of fatigue, but her eyes
  and her tone were full of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," she cried, "do you know that the hall is filled with your
  father's luggage, and that the car is ordered to take him to Southampton
  directly after lunch?"</p>

  <p>Margaret and Francis exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Sir Timothy may change his mind," the latter observed. "I have news for
  him directly he arrives."</p>

  <p>On the other side of the wall they heard the whinnying of the old mare,
  the sound of galloping feet from all directions.</p>

  <p>"Here he comes!" Lady Cynthia exclaimed. "I shall go and meet him."</p>

  <p>Francis laid his hand upon her arm.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a word with him first," he begged.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to say anything&mdash;that will make him want to go
  away?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell him something which I think will keep him at
  home."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy came through the postern-gate, a moment or two later. He waved
  his hat and crossed the lawn in their direction. Francis went alone to meet
  him and, as he drew near, was conscious of a little shock. His host, although
  he held himself bravely, seemed to have aged in the night.</p>

  <p>"I want one word with you, sir, in your study, please," Francis said.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shrugged his shoulders and led the way. He turned to wave his
  hand once more to Margaret and Lady Cynthia, however, and he looked with
  approval at the luncheon-table which a couple of servants were laying under
  the cedar tree.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful thing, these alfresco meals," he declared. "I hope Hedges won't
  forget the maraschino with the melons. Come into my den, Ledsam."</p>

  <p>He led the way in courtly fashion. He was the ideal host leading a valued
  guest to his sanctum for a few moments' pleasant conversation. But when they
  arrived in the little beamed room and the door was closed, his manner
  changed. He looked searchingly, almost challengingly at Francis.</p>

  <p>"You have news for me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Francis answered.</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy shrugged his shoulders. He threw himself a little wearily into
  an easy-chair. His hands strayed out towards a cigarette box. He selected one
  and lit it.</p>

  <p>"I expected your friend, Mr. Shopland," he murmured. "I hope he is none
  the worse for his ducking."</p>

  <p>"Shopland is a fool," Francis replied. "He has nothing to do with this
  affair, anyway. I have something to give you, Sir Timothy."</p>

  <p>He took the two papers from his pocket and handed them over.</p>

  <p>"I bought these from John Walter the day before yesterday," he continued.
  "I gave him two hundred pounds for them. The money was just in time. He
  caught a steamer for Australia late in the afternoon. I had this wireless
  from him this morning."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy studied the two documents, read the wireless. There was little
  change in his face. Only for a single moment his lips quivered.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" he asked, rising to his feet with the documents in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"It means that those papers are yours to do what you like with. I drafted
  the second one so that you should be absolutely secure against any further
  attempt at blackmail. As a matter of fact, though, Walter is on his last
  legs. I doubt whether he will live to land in Australia."</p>

  <p>"You know that I killed Oliver Hilditch?" Sir Timothy said, his eyes fixed
  upon the other's.</p>

  <p>"I know that you killed Oliver Hilditch," Francis repeated. "If I had been
  Margaret's father, I think that I should have done the same."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy seemed suddenly very much younger. The droop of his lips was
  no longer pathetic. There was a little humourous twitch there.</p>

  <p>"You, the great upholder of the law?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I have heard the story of Oliver Hilditch's life," Francis replied. "I
  was partially responsible for saving him from the gallows. I repeat what I
  have said. And if you will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. Sir Timothy hesitated for one moment. Instead of
  taking it, he laid his hand upon Francis' shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Ledsam," he said, "we have thought wrong things of one another. I thought
  you a prig, moral to your finger-tips with the morality of the law and the
  small places. Perhaps I was tempted for that reason to give you a wrong
  impression of myself. But you must understand this. Though I have had my
  standard and lived up to it all my life, I am something of a black sheep. A
  man stole my wife. I did not trouble the Law Courts. I killed him."</p>

  <p>"I have the blood of generations of lawyers in my veins," Francis
  declared, "but I have read many a divorce case in which I think it would have
  been better and finer if the two men had met as you and that man met."</p>

  <p>"I was born with the love of fighting in my bones," Sir Timothy went on.
  "In my younger days, I fought in every small war in the southern hemisphere.
  I fought, as you know, in our own war. I have loved to see men fight honestly
  and fairly."</p>

  <p>"It is a man's hobby," Francis pronounced.</p>

  <p>"I encouraged you deliberately to think," Sir Timothy went on, "what half
  the world thinks that&mdash;my parties at The Walled House were mysterious
  orgies of vice. They have, as a matter of fact, never been anything of the
  sort. The tragedies which are supposed to have taken place on my launch have
  been just as much mock tragedies as last night's, only I have not previously
  chosen to take the audiences into my confidence. The greatest pugilists in
  the world have fought in my gymnasium, often, if you will, under illegal
  conditions, but there has never been a fight that was not fair."</p>

  <p>"I believe that," Francis said.</p>

  <p>"And there is another matter for which I take some blame," Sir Timothy
  went on, "the matter of Fairfax and Victor Bidlake. They were neither of them
  young men for whose loss the world is any the worse. Fairfax to some extent
  imposed upon me. He was brought to The Walled House by a friend who should
  have known better. He sought my confidence. The story he told was exactly
  that of the mock drama upon the launch. Bidlake had taken his wife. He had no
  wish to appeal to the Courts. He wished to fight, a point of view with which
  I entirely sympathised. I arranged a fight between the two. Bidlake funked it
  and never turned up. My advice to Fairfax was, whenever he met Bidlake, to
  give him the soundest thrashing he could. That night at Soto's I caught sight
  of Fairfax some time before dinner. He was talking to the woman who had been
  his wife, and he had evidently been drinking. He drew me on one side.
  'To-night,' he told me, 'I am going to settle accounts with Bidlake.'
  'Where?' I asked. 'Here,' he answered. He went out to the theatre, I upstairs
  to dine. That was the extent of the knowledge I possessed which enabled me to
  predict some unwonted happening that night. Fairfax was a bedrugged and
  bedrunken decadent who had not the courage afterwards to face what he had
  done. That is all."</p>

  <p>The hand slipped from Francis' shoulder. Francis, with a smile, held out
  his own. They stood there for a moment with clasped hands&mdash;a queer,
  detached moment, as it seemed to Francis, in a life which during the last few
  months had been full of vivid sensations. From outside came the lazy sounds
  of the drowsy summer morning&mdash;the distant humming of a mowing machine,
  the drone of a reaper in the field beyond, the twittering of birds in the
  trees, even the soft lapping of the stream against the stone steps. The man
  whose hand he was holding seemed to Francis to have become somehow
  transformed. It was as though he had dropped a mask and were showing a more
  human, a more kindly self. Francis wondered no longer at the halting gallop
  of the horses in the field.</p>

  <p>"You'll be good to Margaret?" Sir Timothy begged. "She's had a wretched
  time."</p>

  <p>Francis smiled confidently.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make up for it, sir," he promised. "And this South American
  trip," he continued, as they turned towards the French windows, "you'll call
  that off?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure."</p>

  <p>When they reached the garden, Lady Cynthia was alone. She scarcely glanced
  at Francis. Her eyes were anxiously fixed upon his companion.</p>

  <p>"Margaret has gone in to make the cocktails herself," she explained. "We
  have both sworn off absinthe for the rest of our lives, and we know Hedges
  can't be trusted to make one without."</p>

  <p>"I'll go and help her," Francis declared.</p>

  <p>Lady Cynthia passed her arm through Sir Timothy's.</p>

  <p>"I want to know about South America," she begged. "The sight of those
  trunks worries me."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy's casual reply was obviously a subterfuge. They crossed the
  lawn and the rustic bridge, almost in silence, passing underneath the pergola
  of roses to the sheltered garden at the further end. Then Lady Cynthia
  paused.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to South America," she pleaded, "alone?"</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy took her hands.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "listen, please, to my confession. I am a fraud. I am
  not a purveyor of new sensations for a decadent troop of weary, fashionable
  people. I am a fraud sometimes even to myself. I have had good luck in
  material things. I have had bad luck in the precious, the sentimental side of
  life. It has made something of an artificial character of me, on the surface
  at any rate. I am really a simple, elderly man who loves fresh air, clean,
  honest things, games, and a healthy life. I have no ambitions except those
  connected with sport. I don't even want to climb to the topmost niches in the
  world of finance. I think you have looked at me through the wrong-coloured
  spectacles. You have had a whimsical fancy for a character which does not
  exist."</p>

  <p>"What I have seen," Lady Cynthia answered, "I have seen through no
  spectacles at all&mdash;with my own eyes. But what I have seen, even, does
  not count. There is something else."</p>

  <p>"I am within a few weeks of my fiftieth birthday," Sir Timothy reminded
  her, "and you, I believe, are twenty-nine."</p>

  <p>"My dear man," Lady Cynthia assured him fervently, "you are the only
  person in the world who can keep me from feeling forty-nine."</p>

  <p>"And your people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Heavens! My people, for the first time in their lives, will count me a
  brilliant success," Lady Cynthia declared. "You'll probably have to lend dad
  money, and I shall be looked upon as the fairy child who has restored the
  family fortunes."</p>

  <p>Sir Timothy leaned a little towards her.</p>

  <p>"Last of all," he said, and this time his voice was not quite so steady,
  "are you really sure that you care for me, dear, because I have loved you so
  long, and I have wanted love so badly, and it is so hard to
  believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was the moment, it seemed to her, for which she had prayed. She was in
  his arms, tired no longer, with all the splendid fire of life in her love-lit
  eyes and throbbing pulses. Around them the bees were humming, and a soft
  summer breeze shook the roses and brought little wafts of perfume from the
  carnation bed.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in life," Lady Cynthia murmured brokenly, "so wonderful
  as this."</p>

  <p>Francis and Margaret came out from the house, the former carrying a silver
  tray. They had spent a considerable time over their task, but Lady Cynthia
  and Sir Timothy were still absent. Hedges followed them, a little
  worried.</p>

  <p>"Shall I ring the gong, madam?" he asked Margaret. "Cook has taken such
  pains with her omelette."</p>

  <p>"I think you had better, Hedges," Margaret assented.</p>

  <p>The gong rang out&mdash;and rang again. Presently Lady Cynthia and Sir
  Timothy appeared upon the bridge and crossed the lawn. They were walking a
  little apart. Lady Cynthia was looking down at some roses which she had
  gathered. Sir Timothy's unconcern seemed a trifle overdone. Margaret laughed
  very softly.</p>

  <p>"A stepmother, Francis!" she whispered. "Just fancy Cynthia as a
  stepmother!"</p>
