<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER ONE. THE FUNCTION OF THE
NOVEL IN THE MODERN WORLD</h2>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>One finds&mdash;or at any rate I have always
found&mdash;English History relatively easy to grasp because in
it it is not difficult to see a pattern of what some one has
called Freedom slowly broadening down from precedent to
precedent. One may or may not agree with the statement, one may
or may not like the fact, if it is a fact, that it sets forth;
but at least it gives us that pattern, some sort of jumping-off
place, something by which one may measure and co-relate various
phases of the story. The histories of most other races are more
difficult to grasp or follow because they are less systematized
and more an affair of individuals. One may be aware that the
pre-Revolution history of France is an affair of power gradually
centralizing itself on the throne, and that the Fronde was an
episode in that progression. Nevertheless, the Fronde with its
violent personalities, its purely individual intrigues, its
Cardinals, Queens, Cond&eacute;s, Chevreuses and the rest, was a
baffling affair to follow, and obscures the issue which doubtless
was that, all power being concentrated under one hat, the neck
which supported the head which supported that hat was easy to
strike off.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the History of Literature&mdash;and to
that of the Novel in particular, almost the exact inverse is the
case. Whereas almost every country other than England&mdash;or
indeed every race other than Anglo-Saxondom&mdash;has a tradition
of literature in which some sort of precedent broadens down into
some other, it would appear that however docile the Anglo-Saxon
may be in the hands of politicians or leaders&mdash;usually of a
Leftwards complexion&mdash;the moment any aesthetic discipline
proposes itself for his direction he becomes at least as
refractory as any Cond&eacute; and almost more intriguing than
any Chevreuse.</p>
<p>Any sort of English writer takes any sort of pen and on any
sort of paper with in his hair whatever sort of vine-leaves you
will and at his elbow any nectar from metheglin to Chateau Yquem
or pale ale, writes any sort of story in any sort of
method&mdash;or in any sort of mixture of any half-dozen methods.
So, if he have any of the temperament of an artist, you have a
Fielding or a Trollope, a Samuel Butler or a George Meredith,
each rising as a separate peak but each absolutely without
interrelation with any other.</p>
<p>That was never better exemplified than quite lately when you
had&mdash;all living simultaneously but all, alas, now
dead&mdash;Thomas Hardy, George Meredith, Henry James, Joseph
Conrad, and Mark Twain. Each was a considerable figure but each
sat, as it were, alone on his little peak surrounded by his lay
satellites, and each was entirely uninfluenced by the work of all
the others&mdash;two solitary Englishmen, two Americans and one
alien. Whether or no there was any resultant literary movement I
am about to try to trace for you, looking at the matter with the
eyes of a craftsman surveying his own particular job.</p>
<p>In the case of any other country or race such a proceeding
would be comparatively easy. In France, for instance, living at
the same time as, but all predeceasing, the distinguished
Anglo-Saxons and the alien of genius that I have named above, you
had Flaubert, Maupassant, Turgenev, the Goncourt brothers,
Gautier, Daudet&mdash;six Frenchmen and an alien of beautiful
genius. They all met frequently, dining together almost weekly at
Br&eacute;bant's&mdash;where Henry James in the wake of Turgenev
dined from time to time too. With amiability, with acidity, with
passion or frenzies of hatred they discussed words, cadences,
forms, progressions of effect&mdash;or the cannon-strokes with
which one concludes short short-stories. They were during those
meetings indifferent to fame, wealth, the course of public
affairs, ruin, death. For them there was only one enduring
Kingdom&mdash;that of the Arts&mdash;and only one Republic that
shall be everlasting: the Republic of Letters.</p>
<p>The resultant literary movement&mdash;for with their deaths it
crossed the Channel&mdash;I shall endeavour to trace, and the
enterprise will concern itself with the modern English novel. For
the Art of Writing is an affair as international as are all the
other Arts&mdash;as International, as Co-operative and as
mutually uniting. Shakespeare could not have written as he did
had not Boccaccio, Petrarch, and Plutarch preceded him, nor could
Flaubert have written <i>Madame Bovary</i> as he wrote it had
there not been before then the <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> of
Richardson. Nor yet could Conrad have written <i>Heart of
Darkness</i> or <i>Lord Jim</i> had Flaubert not written
<i>Bouvard et P&eacute;cuchet</i> or Alphonse Daudet,
<i>Jack.</i></p>
<p>It is, at any rate, in this spirit that, in this small
monograph, I shall present to you my reflections on the English
Novel&mdash;which is the same thing as the Novel&mdash;and the
pattern that, for me, it seems to make down the short ages during
which it has existed. It will differ very widely from the
conclusions arrived at&mdash;and above all from the estimates
formed by&mdash;my predecessors in this field who have seldom
themselves been imaginative writers let alone novelists, and who,
by the exigencies of their professions, have usually been what it
is the custom to call academic. That I cannot help. For the
benefit of the reader who wishes to know what is generally
thought of these subjects I have tried to state along with my own
differing conclusions what that general thought is. If, I mean, I
belabour the winking lewdness of <i>Tom Jones,</i> I am careful
to point out that most of my professional predecessors or
contemporaries beatify Fielding because of his refreshing
carelessness in most matters to which decent men pay attention.
The young, earnest student of literature for professional
purposes should, if he desires good marks, write in his thesis
for examination pretty well the opposite of what I have here set
down. But, in the end, it is as useful to have something that
will awaken you by its disagreements with yourself as to live for
ever in concord with somnolent elders. It gives you another point
of view, though you may return to the plane from which you
started. I was once watching a painter painting a field of
medicinal poppies which from where he sat appeared quite black.
Suddenly, he grasped me by the wrist and dragged me up a small
hill. From there that field appeared dark-purple shot with gold.
I said: "It doesn't make any difference, does it, to your
composition?" He answered: "No, it doesn't make any difference,
but I wish the d&mdash;d things would not do it, for, when I have
finished, I shall have to come up here and do them all over
again!"</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>Since the day when Thackeray obsequiously apologized to the
world and his readers for being a mere novelist, in the interests
of a pompous social system which decreed that the novel should
not be seriously regarded and the novelist himself be stigmatized
as something detrimental to good order and the decorous
employment of spare time&mdash;since, then, Thackeray poked fun
at the greatest of all his books which may well be regarded, if
you will, as the greatest work in the English language, an
immense change has occurred in the relative place accorded to the
Novel in the Anglo-Saxon social cosmogony. Because, as novelist,
Thackeray felt his social position insecure, he must attempt to
retrieve himself by poking fun at his book and so proving that at
least he did not take the Novel seriously, his heart being in the
right place be his occupation never so ungentlemanly. So he must
needs write his epilogue as to the showman rolling up his
marionettes in green baize and the rest of it.</p>
<p>To-day, however, even the most fugitive of novelists takes his
work more seriously and, perhaps all unconsciously, the public
accords to the more serious amongst the novelists an attention
that formerly it accorded solely to politicians, preachers,
scientists, medical men, and the like. This is because the novel
has become indispensable to the understanding of life.</p>
<p>It is, that is to say, the only source to which you can turn
in order to ascertain how your fellows spend their entire lives.
I use the words "entire lives" advisedly.</p>
<p>In older days&mdash;dating back to improvement in
locomotion&mdash;it was possible for anyone, whatever his
station, to observe, at any rate roughly as it were, a complete
cross-section of the lives from cradle to coffin of a whole
social order. In England up to the days of the stage-coach,
families were planted on the land practically to all eternity and
even within my memory it was nearly impossible for the
agricultural labourer to move from one parish&mdash;nay, from one
farm to another. One of the most vivid of my souvenirs as a boy
was seeing a ploughman weep on a great down. He was weeping
because he had five children and a bad master who paid him
thirteen and six a week and he was utterly unable to get together
the guinea that it would cost him to hire a farm wagon and move
his sticks of furniture to another and better farm. Nevertheless
that man knew more about human lives and their tides and
vicissitudes than I or any other town-dweller in an age of
shiftings.</p>
<p>He could follow the lives of local peer, local squire, doctor,
lawyer, gentleman-farmer, tenant farmer, butcher, baker, barber,
parson, gamekeeper, water-warden, and so on right down to those
of the great bulk of the population, his fellows and equals. He
could follow them from the time the kid-glove was affixed to the
door-knocker as a symbol of birth and until the passing-bell
heralded their disappearance into the clay in the shadow of the
church-walls. And although that was more emphatically true in
Great Britain, the first home of the English novel, it was almost
equally true&mdash;<i>mutatis mutandis</i>&mdash;of the earlier
settled colonial districts in the United States. Until, say, the
early forties of the nineteenth century it must have been almost
equally difficult to remove from Rochester, N.Y., as from the
Rochester of Dickens, and as difficult to move from the
Birmingham that gave to the world the word Brummagem as a term of
contempt, as from the Birmingham in a. Southern State of the
North American Republic.</p>
<p>Then, with ease of locomotion came the habit of
flux&mdash;which is infinitely more developed to-day in the
United States than in Great Britain. In London and the urban
districts that house by far the greater bulk of the English
population the prevalence of the seven years' lease has hitherto
tended to anchor families in one spot for at least that length of
time, but even that space is not sufficient to give a family much
insight into the lives and habits of its neighbours. In any case
it is significant that novel-reading is almost infinitely more a
permanent habit in the United States than in Great Britain, and
the position of the imaginative writer in so far more
satisfactory.</p>
<p>In observing a social phenomenon like the novel these social
changes must be considered. The fact is that gossip is a
necessity for keeping the mind of humanity as it were aerated and
where, owing to lack of sufficiently intimate circumstances in
communities gossip cannot exist, its place must be
supplied&mdash;and it is supplied by the novel. You may say that
for the great cities of to-day its place is taken by what in the
United States is called the "tabloid" and in England the "yellow"
or "gutter" Press. But these skilful sensational renderings of
merely individual misfortunes, necessary as they are to human
existence and sanity in the great cities, are yet too highly
coloured by their producers, and the instances themselves are too
far from the normal to be of any great educational value. An
occasional phrase in, say, a Peaches-Browning case may now and
then ring true, but the sound common sense of great publics is
aware that these affairs are too often merely put-up jobs to
attach any importance to them as casting light on normal human
motives.</p>
<p>The servant of a country parsonage leaning over the yew-hedge
giving on the turnpike and saying that the vicar's wife was
carrying on something dreadful with Doctor Lambert might convey
some sort of view of life, ethics, morals, and the rest to
another young woman; but the minute dissection by
commonplace-minded reporters of the actions and agonies of a lady
who essays first unsuccessfully to poison her husband and finally
dispatches him with a club&mdash;these minute dissections are not
only usually read with a grain of salt, but not unusually, too,
they are speedily forgotten. Scenes on the other hand presented
with even a minimum of artistry will remain in the mind as long
as life lasts: <i>Ivanhoe</i> must permanently represent
mediaevalism for a great proportion of the inhabitants of the
globe, though Scott was a very poor artist; and the death of Emma
Bovary will remain horrific in the reader's mind, whilst the
murder of yesterday is on the morrow forgotten.</p>
<p>It is this relative difference in the permanence of impression
that distinguishes the work of the novelist as artist from all
the other arts and pursuits of the world. <i>Trilby,</i> for
instance, was no great shakes of a book in the great scale of
things, but an American gentleman asserted to me the other day
that that work did more to cosmopolitanize the populations of the
Eastern States than any movement of an international nature that
has been seen since the Declaration of Independence. I don't know
if that is true, but it usefully puts a point of view&mdash;and I
am not the one to deny it.</p>
<p>It is, in short, unbearable to exist without some view of life
as a whole, for one finds oneself daily in predicaments in which
some sort of a pointer is absolutely necessary. Even though no
novel known to you may exactly meet your given case, the novel
does supply that cloud of human instances without which the soul
feels unsafe in its adventures and the normal mind fairly easily
discerns what events or characters in its fugitive novels are
meretricious in relation to life however entertaining they may be
as fiction.</p>
<p>That the republic&mdash;the body politic&mdash;has need of
these human-filtered insights into lives is amply proved by the
present vogue of what I will call novelized biography. Lives of
every imaginable type of human being from Shelley to Washington
are nowadays consumed with singular voracity, and if some of the
impeccable immortals are in the upshot docked of their pedestals
there can, I think, be little doubt that, in the process, the
public consciousness of life is at once deepened and rendered
more down to the ground. And the human mind is such a curiously
two-sided affair that, along with down-to-the-ground renderings,
it is perfectly able to accept at once the liveliest efforts of
hero-worshippers, denigrators, or whitewashers. The amiable
mendacities of the parson who gave to us the little axe and the
cherry-tree are to-day well known to be the sheerest inventions;
the signal reputed to have been given at the battle of Trafalgar
is far more soul-stirring than the actual rather stilted message
that Lord Nelson composed. And even if Henri IV of France never
uttered his celebrated words about the chicken in the pot,
humanity must have invented them&mdash;and that too must have
been the case with the cherry-tree. In the days when these
catch-phrases received worldwide acceptance the public was in
fact doing for itself what to-day is left to the writer of
fiction.</p>
<p>For the practised novelist knows that when he is introducing a
character to his reader it is expedient that the first speech of
that character should be an abstract statement&mdash;and an
abstract statement striking strongly the note of that character.
First impressions are the strongest of all, and once you have
established in that way the character of one of your figures you
will find it very hard to change it. So humanity, feeling the
need for great typical figures with whose example to exhort their
children or to guide themselves, adopts with avidity, invents or
modifies the abstract catchwords by which that figure will stand
or fall. What Nelson actually desired to say was: "The country
confidently anticipates that in this vicissitude every man of the
fleet will perform his functions with accuracy and
courage!"&mdash;or something equally stiff, formal and in accord
with what was the late eighteenth-century idea of fine writing.
Signal flags, however, would not run to it: the signaller did his
best, and so we have Nelson. Had the signal gone out as Nelson
conceived it, not Southey nor any portraitist could have given
him to us. Or had Gilbert Stuart's too faithful rendering of the
facial effects of badly-fitting false teeth been what we first
knew of Washington our views of the Father of His Country would
be immensely modified. But the folk-improved or adopted sayings
were the first things that at school or before school we heard of
these heroic figures of our self-made novel, and neither
denigrator nor whitewasher will ever much change them for us, any
more than the probably false verdict of posterity on John
Lackland who had Dante to damn him will ever be reversed.</p>
<p>As to whether the sweeping away of the humaner classical
letters in the interests of the applied sciences as a means of
culture is a good thing or a bad there must be two
opinions&mdash;but there is no doubt that by getting rid of
Plutarch the change will extraordinarily influence humanity.
Ethics, morality, rules of life must of necessity be profoundly
modified and destandardized. For I suppose that no human being
from the end of the Dark Ages to the beginning of the late
War&mdash;no human being in the Western World who was fitting
himself for a career as member of the ruling-classes&mdash;was
not profoundly influenced by that earliest of all
novelist-biographers. And, if you sweep away Marcus Aurelius as
altruist-moralist, the Greek Anthology as a standard of poetry,
Livy as novelist-historian, Cicero as rhetorician, and Pericles
as heaven-born statesman, you will make a cleavage between the
world cosmos of to-day and that of all preceding ages such as no
modern inventions and researches of the material world have
operated. For though swiftening of means of locomotion may have
deprived humanity of knowledge of mankind, it did little to
change the species of generalizations that mankind itself drew
from its more meagre human instances. Till the abolition of
classical culture in the Western World the ruling-classes went on
measuring Gladstone or the late Theodore Roosevelt by Plutarchian
standards&mdash;but neither post-1918 King George V nor any
future President of the United States can hope to escape by that
easy touchstone. From the beginnings of industrialism till 1918
we went on rolling round within the immense gyrations of
buzzings, clicks, rattles, and bangs that is modern life under
the auspices of the applied sciences; we went on contentedly
spinning round like worms within madly whirling walnuts. But as a
guide the great figure had gone.</p>
<p>There is not only no such figure in the world as Washington,
Nelson, or even Napoleon&mdash;but there is no chance that such a
figure can ever arise again. Nay, even the legendary figures that
remain have lost at least half of their appeal. A statue of
Washington adorns the front of the National Gallery in Trafalgar
Square, but it is doubtful if one in a thousand of the passers-by
have even heard of the axe and the cherry-tree, let alone knowing
anything of his tenacity, single-mindedness, and moral courage.
And who in the North American Republic has heard of Nelson and
his signal? For the matter of that, as I have elsewhere related,
a young lady science graduate of a very distinguished Eastern
University was lately heard to ask when she caught sight of the
dome of the Invalides: "Who <i>was</i> this Napollyong they talk
so much about here?" Of course pronunciation may have had
something to do with that. But it was in 1923 that the question
was asked, and since then a popularizing novel-biography of
Napoleon has had an immense vogue in the United States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is to be doubted if ever again figures will be
known to the whole world. It is possible that my distinguished
namesake is so known because of his popularization of a cheap
form of transport, and there are prize-fighters, aviators, and
performers for the cinema. But these scarcely fill in the
departments of public morals and ethical codes the places that
used to be occupied by Pericles, Cicero, and Lucius Junius
Brutus.</p>
<p>I am not writing in the least ironically, nor in the least in
the spirit of the <i>laudator temporis acti.</i> We have scrapped
a whole culture; the Greek Anthology and Tibullus and Catullus
have gone the way of the earliest locomotive and the first Tin
Lizzie. We have, then, to supply their places&mdash;and there is
only the novel that for the moment seems in the least likely or
equipped so to do. That at least cheers me, my whole life having
been devoted to the cause of the Novel&mdash;I don't mean to the
writing of works of fiction but to the furthering of the views
that I am here giving you.</p>
<p>One must live in, one must face with equanimity, the
circumstances of one's own age. I regret that the figures of
Tibullus and our Saviour do not occupy on the stage of the lives
of men the place that they did in the days of my
childhood&mdash;but I have courageously to face the fact that
they do not. For it is obvious that it is not to the parson and
hardly to the priest that one would go for counsel as to one's
material life; still less could the spirit of Alcestis' address
to her bed inspire the young woman to-day contemplating
matrimony.</p>
<p>In short, if you look abroad upon the world you will see that
the department of life that was formerly attended upon by
classical culture has to-day little but the modern work of the
imagination to solace it. And that the solace of Literature and
the Arts is necessary for&mdash;is a craving of&mdash;humanity
few but the most hardened captains of industry or the most
arrogant of professors of Applied Science will be found to deny.
Our joint Anglo-Saxon civilization to-day is a fairly savage and
materialistic affair, but it is also an affair relatively new and
untried. It is perhaps more materialistic than was the
civilization of Ancient Rome and a little less savage than the
early Dark Ages. But both these former periods of human activity
had in the end to develop arts and that, it is probable, will be
the case with us. The Romans, it is true, relied for their arts
mostly on Greek slaves or on such imitators of the Greeks as
Horace and Virgil, and the Dark Ages almost solely on Churchmen
who led precarious existences in hidden valleys. But the
respective futures of these Ages are worth considering for our
present purposes. For the break-up of the Roman Empire for which
innumerable reasons have been found by innumerable pundits
remains at least as mysterious as it was before the first
ancestor of Mommsen first dug up his first tile and upon it wrote
his first monograph. Mommsen, to be sure, used to tell us that
Rome disappeared because it had no Hohenzollern family to guide
its destinies&mdash;and that may be true enough. Gibbon ascribed
to Christianity the Fall of the Roman Empire and People; others
of the learned have laid that catastrophe at the door of
difficulties of communication, of the lack of a modern banking
system, of the want of organization of the system of Imperial
Finances, or of a mysterious and unexplained slackness that
overcame alike the Western and Eastern Empires&mdash;a slackness
due to the pleasures of the table, the wine-cup, of sex and the
like.</p>
<p>But we, as upholders of the Arts, the Moralist having been
pretty well blotted out as a national or international factor by
the avalanche that in 1914 began to overwhelm alike classical
culture and revealed religion, we then might just as well ascribe
the Fall of Rome to the inartistic materialism of the true-Roman
citizen as to any other cause. For the function of the Arts in
the State&mdash;apart from the consideration of
aesthetics&mdash;is so to aerate the mind of the taxpayer as to
make him less dull a boy. Or if you like, it is by removing him
from his own immediate affairs and immersing him in those of his
fellows to give him a better view of the complicated predicaments
that surround him. A financier, that is to say, who turns from
the bewildering and complicated antics of a maze of tape from
tickers, or a realtor who turns from the consideration of corner
lots and the tangled and exhausting intrigues that shall make the
new boulevard of his city run through land controlled by his
interests&mdash;both these pillars of the modern State may be
expected to return as it were with minds refreshed if, taking a
short respite from their arduous and necessary tasks, they lose
themselves for a moment in the consideration of the adventures
and predicaments of the <i>Babbitt</i> of Mr. Sinclair Lewis or
the attempts at escape from the chair of the central character of
Mr. Dreiser's <i>American Tragedy.</i></p>
<p>I permit myself to mention the works of friends of my own
because I must have illustrations for my theme and those
illustrations must be works of to-day of sufficient likelihood to
last long enough not to be forgotten at the next fall of the
leaf&mdash;and Mr. Lewis and Mr. Dreiser are so much more my
personal friends than immersed in my own particular little
technical swim that they are more apposite to my immediate
purpose than would be, say, the authors of <i>The Sun Also
Rises</i> or of <i>My Heart and My Flesh</i>&mdash;or of
<i>Ulysses.</i></p>

<p>Arrived at that particular five-cornered plot in the territory
of the Novel I have foreshadowed the end of this small monograph.
For, having traced the gradual course of the development from
Apuleius to Joseph Conrad, having followed it from the Rome of
Petronius Arbiter to the Spain of Lope da Vega, to the London of
Defoe and Richardson, to the Paris of Diderot, Stendhal, and
Flaubert&mdash;with side glances at the Cockaigne of Thackeray
and Dickens and the Russia of Turgenev, Dostoieffsky and
Tchekov&mdash;and back again to the London of Conrad, Henry
James, and Stephen Crane&mdash;which last two writers America
will not whole-heartedly accept as American, whilst England won't
accept them at all&mdash;having followed the devious course of
the thin stream of development of the novel from the
Mediterranean to the Bay of Biscay, from the Bay of Biscay to the
Port of London and so backwards and forwards across the English
Channel, I shall leave it and you with a bump and with some
regret at the gateway to the Middle-West&mdash;say at about
Altoona. For it is there that the Novel, throughout the Ages the
poor Cinderella of the Arts, is nowadays erecting itself into the
sole guide and monitor of the world.</p>
<p>I should like to have allowed myself to say a few words about
the modern Middle-Western development, which is for the moment
the final stage, of the art to whose furtherance I have obscurely
devoted my half-century of existence. But I am condemned like
Moses only to perceive that Promised Land. This is a monograph on
the English Novel&mdash;which includes <i>The House of the Seven
Gables</i> or <i>What Maisie Knew,</i> not on the Middle-Western
Novel of to-day which very emphatically doesn't include&mdash;oh,
say <i>Riceynan Steps</i> and <i>Mr. Britling Sees it
Through.</i></p>
<p>I should like to observe for the benefit of the Lay Reader, to
whom I am addressing myself&mdash;for the Professional Critic
will pay no attention to anything that I say, contenting himself
with cutting me to pieces with whips of scorpions for having
allowed my head to pop up at all&mdash;to the Lay Reader I should
like to point out that what I am about to write is highly
controversial and that he must take none of it too much <i>au
pied de la lettre.</i> I don't mean to say that it will not be
written with almost ferocious seriousness. But what follows are
suggestions not dictates, for in perusing this sort of book the
reader must be prepared to do a great deal of the work
himself&mdash;within his own mind.</p>
<p>If I choose to write that great imaginative literature began
in England with Archbishop Warham in the sixteenth century and
ended with the death of Thomas Vaughan, the Silurist, in the
first year of the eighteenth century, to come to life again with
Joseph Conrad and the Yellow Book about 1892, and once more to
disappear on the fourth of August, 1914&mdash;if I choose to
write those extreme statements it is because I <i>want</i> the
Reader mentally to object to them the names of Swift, Keats,
Thackeray, Browning, Swinburne, Meredith&mdash;or even those of
Messrs. Galsworthy, Bennett, Wells and, say, Virginia Woolf. I
<i>want</i> the Lay Reader to make those mental reservations for
himself. I should hate to be a professor, I should hate to be
taken as dogmatizing, and I should still more hate that what
dogmatizing I do perforce indulge in should be unquestioningly
accepted by any poor victim.</p>
<p>So that if I should say&mdash;as I probably shall&mdash;that,
along with all his contemporaries, as a constructive artist even
of the picaresque school, Dickens was contemptible, or if I say
that Meredith as a stylist in comparison with Henry James was
simply detestable, or that the conception of novel-writing as an
art began for Anglo-Saxondom with Joseph Conrad, or that
<i>Babbitt</i> dealt a shrewder blow at the pre-war idealization
of the industrial system and the idolatry of materialism than
<i>Don Quixote</i> at sixteenth-century vestiges of the chivalric
spirit, or that <i>The Time of Man</i> is the most beautiful
individual piece of writing that has as yet come out of America,
or that <i>The Lighthouse</i> is the only piece of
British&mdash;as opposed to English&mdash;writing that has
latterly excited my craftsman's mind&mdash;the only piece since
the decline and death of Conrad...if I commit myself to all these
statements the reader must at once violently object that I am a
log-roller writing up my personal friends&mdash;though I never
knew, or even know anyone that knew, Miss Virginia Woolf. He must
object that I have forgotten not only Trollope in my aspersions
on mid-Victorian novelists, but that I have also forgotten Mr.
George Moore. (Alas, I always forget Mr. George Moore, who is
probably the greatest and most dispassionate technician that
English Literature has ever seen.)</p>
<p>He must make all these objections for himself as violently as
possible: then, in reaction, thinking it over he will probably
find that there is something in what I say. At any rate, he will
have a sort of rudimentary map of the Kingdom of the Art of
Letters in his mind. The old-fashioned maps had their advantages.
Their cartographer left in his plans blank spaces in places where
his enemies dwelt and labelled them: "Here be Crocodiles," "Here
be Stenches!" or "Anthropophagi! Avoid this Land!"&mdash;and that
was useful because it told you what parts of the earth were
pernicious to that type of Cartographer. So, if you were of his
type, you avoided territories by him miscalled. On the other
hand, if you disliked the sort of fellow that that map-maker was,
you adventured into the territory labelled "of the Anthropophagi"
to find it inhabited solely by sirens, into the Land of Stenches
to find it distinguished by the most beneficent of chalybeate
springs, or amongst the Crocodiles, who were charming people,
ready at any moment to shed tears over your depleted pockets,
your lost loves, or your rheumatic-gout!</p>
<p>It is with a map of that sort that I am trying to provide you.
No other sort is of the remotest value. Nor is it even possible,
critics being human.</p>
<p>I am looking at the last page of a Manual of English
Literature compiled by a critic who takes himself and is taken
very seriously indeed. I read:</p>
<p><i>"His work often decadent, appealing to senses; a pessimist.
Lacks restraint; small variety in mood!"</i></p>
<p>Think of that as the last word&mdash;the very last
word&mdash;of a Manual of English Literature for the use of the
English Classes of the most numerically attended University in
the Universe! Could I at my worst do worse? Or so badly!</p>
<p>For that is that writer's critical estimate&mdash;that is all
that thirty thousand pupils of a State University are given as an
appraisal of&mdash;Algernon Charles Swinburne!</p>
<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER TWO. TOWARDS DEFOE</h2>
<p>It is not part of my purpose&mdash;nor within the scope of a
short manual would it be possible!&mdash;to trace the influence
of the <i>Golden Ass</i> or the <i>Satirical</i> on the course or
development of the novel&mdash;and indeed their influences
probably came into action so late that the effect was rather to
give coloration to the pastiches of later writers like the late
Mr. Walter Pater or the very much living Mr. Ezra Pound. It is
the same, to all intents and purposes, with such mediaeval
compilations of short-stories as the <i>Decameron,</i> the
<i>Heptameron</i> or the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles.</i> The
<i>Decameron</i> must in particular have been as enormously read
in the course of centuries as <i>Madame Bovary,</i> but, except
for the <i>Heptameron</i> and the rest of the works of that
tradition, it can have led to no developments but merely to a few
imitations such as the <i>Contes Drolatiques</i> of Balzac.</p>
<p>To our immediate purpose they are germane solely as indicating
the desire&mdash;the necessity&mdash;that humanity has always
experienced for fiction of one kind or another, if merely as an
expedient for clarifying the mind The mediaeval European
intellect seems to have been able to appreciate these
crystallizing shocks only in smallish doses, and in Europe it was
not until sixteenth-century Spain that humanity seems to have
been able to sustain its interest for the course of a long
tale&mdash;a series of rambling incidents in the life of one or
of one or two central characters. And again it was not until the
middle nineteenth century in France and the very late nineteenth
or early twentieth that in England the mind of the public could
be expected to take in the rendering&mdash;not the
narrating&mdash;of a work whose central character was not an
individual of slightly superhuman proportions. Still less could
it take in an Affair whose participants, as befits a democratic
age, if not all exactly equal in the parts they play in the
Affair's development, are at least nearly all as normally similar
in aspirations, virtues and vices as is usual in one's
surrounding humanity.</p>
<p>Let us for a moment consider the difference&mdash;if
difference there be&mdash;between the apparently artless tale and
the novel that fulfills my definition of the functions of the
work of fiction in the modern body politic. The artless tale,
then, is nothing but a <i>conte</i>&mdash;a thing told to keep
the hearers gasping or at least engrossed. Told verbally it is
usually short, but professional story-tellers have been
found&mdash;as in the case of the group-authors of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>&mdash;to make them very long indeed. And the habit of
telling very long tales that are practically serials still
persists in Eastern bazaars.</p>
<p>You may say that listening to tales for the mere purpose of
being thrilled or engrossed has nothing to do with the gaining of
vicarious experience, so that the stories of the <i>Decameron</i>
or the ordinary novels of commerce were and are of no value to
the body politic, but a little reflection will show that the
reverse is the case in practice. Human experience is built up by
the averaging out of a great many cases&mdash;some inclining, as
it were, to the extreme right, some to the extreme left, and the
majority probably approaching the normal.</p>
<p>Personally, on the face of it, I ought to be glad if, in the
interests of non-commercial literature, the novel of commerce
could be suppressed, but as a matter of fact I should be the
first to lament such a catastrophe. Humanity, in fact, needs
care-free entertainment&mdash;and in search of it it seldom goes
very far wrong. That is proved by the fact that, ever since books
were books, the great public has devoured with avidity only two
kinds of work&mdash;the very worst from the point of view of the
literary artists, and the very best! The four most popular books
the world over at any given moment since, say, eighteen-sixty
have always been the <i>Pilgrim's Progress, Madame Bovary</i> and
two sempiternally changing works of egregious silliness and
popularity. But whereas the so-called popular books change with
the turn of each year, the more serious works continue to stand
at the head of the best-sellers of the world year in and year
out.</p>
<p>That is a consideration to which we may return; the point that
I wish to make here is that when <i>contes</i> and
<i>nouvelles</i> of the type to be found in the <i>Decameron</i>
were of an almost boundless popularity, not only had the serious
novel no existence but the reprehension that the Victorian
moralist and industrialist expressed also found then no
expression. As I am never tired of relating, my grand-aunt Eliza
was the first utterer of the famous saying: "Sooner than be idle
I'd take a book and read"; but that utterance, perfectly normal
and applauded about 1860 when it was first presented to the
world, is to-day purely risible and could not in serious
earnestness be uttered in the household of any family more
comfortable in its circumstances than those of the lower-paid
manual labourer.</p>
<p>It would have been equally unthinkable at any date from the
tenth century to the early nineteenth. During those nine
centuries, in fact, the professional moralist was only too glad
to enlist the services of the fiction-teller under the sacred
banners of Faith and Good Works, and although towards the end of
the eighteenth century the habits of young ladies who lay
day-long on sofas reading the thousandfold novels of popular
female authors from Aphra Behn to Sarah Fielding&mdash;although
that habit was lightly satirized by dramatists and occasionally
scourged in the sermons of nonconformist divines, these
occurrences were very sporadic and altogether too infrequent to
form a national habit. Indeed, until the nineteenth century was
under way it might even be advanced that the writers of such
works of fiction as the <i>Pilgrim's Progress, Rasselas,</i> or
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> were eagerly sought as allies by the
professional, ecclesiastical, or nonconformist moralist.</p>
<p>And that was even more pronouncedly the case in days still
earlier when in Europe a universal and all-powerful church
dictated the morals of gentle and simple alike. Indeed, whatever
may or may not be said of Catholicism in the way of praise or
blame, it cannot be alleged that when she was all-powerful she
was ever afraid of the Arts or afraid to employ them for her own
purposes. The Moralities of the Nun Hrotswitha, the mystery plays
and mummings of every town-guild in the Middle Ages, are alone
overwhelming evidence that the church, representing the
professional moralists of five or six centuries, was only too
glad to avail itself of forms of art as an indispensable means of
spreading her teachings. Nor indeed until the Puritan Divines of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries turned upon the art of
fiction as presented on the stage did that form of art do
anything other than bend itself willingly to the services of
morality. For you might say that the drama of Wycherley and
Killigrew was as much a protest against the oppression of the
then professional moralist as any spontaneous movement for the
supply of lecherous fiction to the public. The greater part of
the plays of the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists&mdash;by far
the greater part&mdash;consisted of works of profound&mdash;and
quite conventional&mdash;moral purpose; the earlier drama, and
even the pace-egging and mumming of country shows, were nothing
but pietistic pronouncements put as picturesquely-and as
alluringly spiced with alliterations in the prosody and low
comedy in the plots&mdash;as the fiction-writers of the day could
contrive. Hell always yawned before the audience beneath the high
trestle-boards and stages of these shows; in the flies Heaven and
its denizens were always visible, whilst in what would to-day be
called the wings there waited perpetually visible, on the one
hand the Devil ready to pitchfork the wicked into the lower story
of the stage&mdash;and Man's Good Angel to conduct him to the
Better Place. And clowns and characters called Vices were always
ready to endure the drubbings that, enlivening the public, were
the portion of the mildly wicked and foolish.</p>
<p>No, decidedly the mediaeval and early renaissance art of
fiction, quite as much as Matthew Arnold, was on the side of the
angels.</p>
<p>It might be as well here to point out that until the
Restoration and its comedies brought scenery and attempts at
scenic realism to the stage, the Play and the Novel were
practically the same form. Or it might be better to put it that
the Novel was the direct development of the play&mdash;a
development made possible by the art of printing. In effect the
plays of Shakespeare were novels written for recitation, and
that, naturally, was still more the case with the works of
Shakespeare's predecessors. And it is significant that as reading
became more common with the establishment of Edward VI's grammar
schools, the play itself became less a matter of rantings and by
degrees even a medium for fine writing. <i>Gorboduc</i> and
<i>Ferrex and Porrex</i> or <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> were
products of either a stilted classicism or of a boisterous,
native spirit of knockabout buffoonery, puns, and ribald jests.
The classical motive issued presently into a mode of over-written
elegance that speedily proved itself unreadable: then Lyly gave
place to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>It has always seemed obvious to me&mdash;as a private
conviction for which I have no wish to do battle and which I have
no wish to force on the reader as any more than a
suggestion&mdash;that Shakespeare himself regretted the literary
chastity of his muse. I mean that Shakespeare, as gentleman and
one wishing to sport his coat-of-arms in the very best social and
scholastic circles, deprecated the passing of the Unities and of
bombast and wished that the popular taste would have let him make
a living by verse in the style of the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> and
the more florid poems that decorate the last pages of editions of
his works. His speeches to the players in <i>Hamlet</i> and all
his life as far as it is known would seem to indicate that. But
it is not until you can bring yourself to regard not merely the
plays of Shakespeare but the whole post-Lylian Elizabethan and
Jacobean drama as novels written for recitation that the great
mystery of Shakespeare's life seems to become reasonably
explicable. For the great mystery of Shakespeare as novelist is
simply: "Why did Shakespeare never correct his proofs?"</p>
<p>Beside this amazing enormity all questions as to the identity
of Mr. W. H. or the Dark Lady or Mary Fitton or of the motives of
the sonnets become paler and more ineffectual than any ghosts.
For they at least don't matter. But that the greatest writer of
all time should not have taken the trouble ever to read his own
works in print, preferring to retire to Stratford, sue out his
coat armour and so, on his profits as theatre owner, become
titularly and legally a Gentleman&mdash;that, if you think about
it and have ever known an author, is the most amazing phenomenon
known to the history of Literature. Napoleon at St. Helena,
renaming himself Monsieur Dupont and shuddering at the mention of
Austerlitz, would not be more astonishing. For this novelist
never blotted a line and never saw his work through the
press!</p>
<p>On the face of it the plays of Shakespeare read extravagantly
well but, on the modern stage, play extravagantly badly. I have
never in my life been more bored and appalled than at having to
sit through an uncut performance of <i>Hamlet,</i> given by the
most noted performers in the world in front of a gigantic real
castle. It was terrifying and it lasted from nine at night till
four in the morning. There was the real castle, the real moon,
real armour dating back to Shakespeare's days, real banners of
the epoch; real soldiers played the troops of
Fortinbras&mdash;and to add a touch of reality of another sort,
in the middle of the performance real Communist groundlings
demonstrated for Saccho and Vanzetti!</p>
<p>But the point was that, with the real castle, pump and the
rest, all Shakespeare's descriptions became intolerable pleonasms
and gave a singular unreality to the characters that uttered
them. For normal humanity does not talk of patines of bright gold
when considering the night skies: it says "Look at the stars,"
and possibly adds: "Aren't they jolly?" The stars in fact do the
rest: and in this given case the castle of Avignon, the Rhone,
and the moon were admirably prepared to replace all that anyone's
descriptions could do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have never in my life been so overwhelmed
as by a ranted performance given by capable actors in modern
dress in a rather bare modern studio that had galleries round
it&mdash;a condition pretty well reproducing that of the
Shakespearean stage. Hero and heroine and subordinate characters
bellowed rhetorical periods, floods of bombast; they threw their
arms about, raved, fell down, and staggered to their feet. The
effect, as I have said, was overwhelming; no such other utter
tragedy has ever presented itself to the world for three hundred
years; the grief of the heroine was so insufferable that you
could not sit in your place; when the hero died you groaned
aloud. Yet the play was only Kyd's <i>Spanish</i> Tragedy,
ranking as a pretty poor work and to-day very difficult to
read.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, on the other hand, does read extravagantly well
through the greater part of his work&mdash;but large portions of
the plays must pay the penalty of all works intended for one
medium and presented in another. The sheer silliness of
many&mdash;of most of his plots except in the Chronicle
Plays&mdash;their sheer silliness and negligence regarded from
the point of view of the art of the novel, become technical merit
when it is a matter of recitation; bareness of plot is then a
necessity, the mind having no time to turn back and pick up
merely suggested clues. And of course a great deal of his work
must have seemed to a man of his own delicacy of temperament much
more the merest writing down to the groundlings or coarse
flatterings of those in authority than that caviare to the
general that he hoped to provide.</p>
<p>So that his inattention to the printing of his plays may very
conceivably have proceeded from sheer disgust at them&mdash;a
frame of mind not unfamiliar to the artist when viewing his work
in the light of his own ideals. Or of course it remains open to
us&mdash;all things in the case of Shakespeare being open to
us&mdash;to consider that he really regarded his work as
commercial trivia that had much better be ignored in the later
stages of his aggrandizement to the state of gentility. That
frame of mind is so usual in the British novelist and ever since
novels have been translated or written in England has proved so
disastrous to the art itself that it is quite conceivable that
the first&mdash;and the greatest&mdash;of them all may have
shared in that national characteristic.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the assertion that the Elizabethan and
Jacobean play answered in advance the call from the public for
the novel that was so soon to come may very well be regarded as
fact. And indeed the same may be regarded as true of all
pre-Elizabethan or rather pre-Edwardian English literature. Or it
might be more just to say that, the Grammar School spreading at
once the capacity and the taste for reading, the enhanced
national wealth of the age of Drake and countenanced piracy in
Elizabeth's day made the purchase and dissemination of books a
possibility amongst a very much wider class of the public.</p>
<p>We may then regard the rule of thumb definition of the novel
as a printed book of some length telling one tale or relating the
adventures of one single personage as reasonably acceptable. In
that case you get an instance at once of supply created by demand
and of that supply being rendered possible by the fact that
education and material production arrived almost hand in hand.
For although printing was available as a means of spreading
knowledge almost a couple of centuries earlier, the exiguity of
material wealth and leisure, the turmoil and the scarcity of
labour of the centuries of pestilence, dynastic wars, and turmoil
that preceded the firm establishment of the Tudors on the throne
infinitely delayed and indeed indefinitely put back the clock of
culture in these kingdoms.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, we may say that Chaucer, the first English
writer of sustained imaginative pieces, was also the first
English writer for the Press&mdash;a writer, that is to say, for
the individual reader in his closet rather than a composer of
lays, ballads, roundels, or even epics, for recitation. The
dictum should be accepted with caution. That it is on the whole
just is nevertheless demonstrable by the comparison of the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> or <i>Troilus and Cresseide</i> with say
the <i>Faerie Queene</i> or Drayton's <i>Polyolbion.</i> That the
work of Chaucer is readable, whereas the epics of Spenser and
Drayton practically defy perusal, is not merely a matter of
difference of greatness in the respective authors. Chaucer was an
infinitely greater writer than either of his successors: his
character-drawing is extraordinary, his sense of beauty
overwhelming, his minutely observing mind stalls off the
possibility of dullness in his pages. And read to himself by an
individual reader the work of Spenser is intolerably pompous,
allegorical and dull, and that of Drayton all too pedestrian
because of his lack of any powers of selection. But, if you will
read the longer works of Chaucer aloud you will find him a little
difficult to follow simply because of that very minuteness of
observation and that very lack of dullness; the others, on the
other hand, gain immensely by reading aloud or by
recitation&mdash;both Spenser and Drayton taking on a sort of
jolly robustness that is even to-day by no means disagreeable and
that may well have been enormously engrossing in the mouth of a
good reader reading to audiences that had little to do but listen
and lacked the power of reading for themselves.</p>
<p>In the matter of the consumption of literature, in fact, the
English world had gone back several generations between the ages
of Chaucer and Spenser&mdash;if, that is to say, you regard the
evolution of the printed book and the arrival of the novel as
Progress, for it is quite open to you to regard the disappearance
of oral poetry and the epic as retrogression. Nevertheless, it is
fairly true to say that Chaucer with Caxton, the first printer,
as an intimate wrote far more definitely for the Press than did
any of the Elizabethan imaginative writers. Except in the
internal style and the outward effect of his work there is of
course no evidence that Chaucer considered definitely that the
coming of the printing press called for a change in the technique
of the imaginative writer&mdash;but it would not be utterly
fanciful to imagine that he did at least consider himself a
writer destined to have a great number of individual readers
rather than vast audiences destined to listen to recitals of his
work.</p>
<p>To what extent I am right in advancing the suggestion that
Eastern and Eastern-European audiences had tougher brain-stuffs
than their Anglo-Saxon contemporaries, at any rate in the matter
of listening to recitals of tales in prose or verse, the reader
may decide for himself. The suggestion is nevertheless handy as
presenting a certain not unuseful image. We may say that the
printing press killed alike the epic and all forms of metrical
romance, or we may say that the epic and the metrical romance are
essentially foreign to the taste of the Occidental
reader&mdash;and the second statement is in effect merely a
repetition in other terms of the first.</p>
<p>Into that I do not propose to go. It is sufficient to say that
when I do make the assertion I find myself, as it were
unexpectedly, in company with the academic critic of to-day and
yesterday. At any rate, quite orthodox authorities have not
unusually asserted that Romaunts or Romances were, in England at
least, intended for the personal reading of the mediaeval courtly
and clerical individual, whilst the shorter lays, virelais,
ballads, and the like were aimed, as being less fatiguing, at
popular and numerous audiences. This seems to be merely common
sense. On the other hand, very long metrical or prose
compositions did simultaneously appeal to Oriental audiences and
it is not unusual in academic circles to describe the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> themselves as "Oriental in origin," which
seems queer but may for the moment pass.</p>
<p>What, however, I am anxious to establish&mdash;at the risk of
a certain prolixity&mdash;is the fact that an appetite for
fiction amounting also to an expression of a necessity has, at
least since the Dark Ages till the present day, distinguished all
humanity. The reason probably is, as I have already hinted, that
we need accounts of human life not so much as matter from which
to draw morals for our own particular cases but rather as
something that will take us outside ourselves and, as it were, to
a height from which we may the better observe ourselves and our
neighbours. The moral is usually thrown in by the moralist who
nevertheless insists or at any rate asserts that moralizing is
the sole purpose of his life and work. But the Morality Plays of
the Nun Hrotswitha, the Mysteries of every English town from
Salisbury to Lytham, the terrifically moralizing novels from
<i>Guzman d'Alfarache</i> to the history of <i>Moll Flanders,</i>
were simply evidence of the fact that humanity did not want
moralizing and did want fiction. They represent the moralist
throwing up the sponge and trying to get a pinch of salt on to
the tail of that difficult bird, man. It is obvious that large
audiences in days of complete boredom could be found for the
sermons of ranting monks and violent reformers. But even at that
the appeal was largely fictional and what the audiences went to
hear&mdash;as was the case with, say, Savonarola&mdash;was rather
semi-hysterical and lively descriptions of the sufferings of
souls in eternal flame than any doctrinal discourses on the life
and teachings of Him Whose message was: "Neither do I condemn
thee!"</p>
<p>So, gradually, fiction emerging with timidity from under the
wing of the Church itself took such prentice flights in the
direction of pure rendering of life as picaresque novels like
<i>Don Quixote.</i> It is, however, doubtful if the adventures of
the knight of la Mancha would have got past the Index had not the
Church been called in in the person of the parish priest who in
the end burns the poor hero's books of romance; and from that
point of view Cervantes may be regarded as simply drawing the
cord of conventional morality closer round the necks of the
unfortunate public. The romance of <i>The Seven Champions of
Christendom</i> had to be burned not because it was a silly book
but because its morality was insufficiently puritan, the Church
of Rome in the throes of the Catholic Reaction having to prove
itself at least as puritan as the Anabaptists of M&uuml;nster. So
the body that tolerated Rabelais good-naturedly had to invent an
<i>auto da f&eacute;</i> in order to deal with Amadis de Gaul;
and Cervantes, for all the world like a seventeenth-century
Thackeray, had to attune his satire to the pipe of a reacting
church. Fiction, in short, had to pay an always greater tribute
to morality as it escaped from being the mere servant of
established religion.</p>
<p>In effect the Church&mdash;and then the Churches&mdash;said to
the novel, the play, the romance, and the ballad: "We are too
busy cutting each other's throats and inventing newer theologies,
to bother any more about artistic productions. In the meantime we
will remove the benefit of clergy that used to shield those who
could manipulate a pen. You may write and compose what lay
fictions you like, but the rack, the faggot or the pillory will
attend you if you publish anything that we <i>don't</i> like."
And the novelist, always a timid creature and in England avid of
social consideration, was quick to take the hint. So Don
Quichotte de la Mancha, the only gentleman produced by the genius
of Cervantes, and indeed by all the genius of that age, had to
become a pitiable lunatic. Yet it is impossible that a man of the
perspicacity of the writer of that work could not have seen that
the Don, wiping curds from his benign and tranquil countenance,
was godlike in comparison to the crooks and gross
peasants&mdash;the cats and monkeys!&mdash;that surrounded him.
Nevertheless the Don must go!</p>
<p>With those Spaniards, then, the novel approached some sort of
rendering of life and that sort of rendering was soon enough to
make its appearance in England. It crossed the Bay of Biscay and
the Channel with a picaresque work of a prodigious popularity in
its day&mdash;<i>Guzman d' Alfarache</i> or the <i>Story of a
Rogue.</i> Less picaresque in the true sense of being the
strung-together life of a <i>picaro</i> or professional
thief&mdash;less picaresque than the immortal <i>Lazarillo de
Tormes</i> and less achingly tragic as a presentation of the life
of the brothel and wine-shop than <i>Celestina,</i> the work of
Hermann Alemannos, whose name betrays his Teutonic origin, was
much more suited to the Anglo-Saxon taste than either one of the
other three Spanish books that I have selected for mention.</p>
<p>The true Spanish genius is for us obviously too austere. Our
public could, it is true, guffaw over the discomfitures of the
knight of the Woeful Countenance and the manoeuvre by which
Lazarillo gets rid of his blind master who himself was the most
ferocious of scoundrels; and the suicide from the tower in
<i>Celestina</i> may have excited disagreeable emotions in the
English reader who preferred to think that punishment for sins
was a matter of the hereafter. But the remorseless, essentially
Spanish black and white of the greater novels was no more for the
English public or the English litterateur than are <i>Titus
Andronicus</i> and <i>Pericles</i> when they can get the
<i>Comedy of Errors</i> or the <i>Midsummer Night's
Dream.</i></p>
<p><i>Guzman d'Alfarache,</i> on the other hand, was a wilderness
of enormous passages of trite morality enlivened here and there
with episodes of cozening and purse-cutting and it has always
been a matter of speculation to me&mdash;for I have known these
works ever since I was a very small child&mdash;to what extent
the seventeenth-century public really liked the moralizings, to
what extent it was merely hypocrisy, and to what extent, again,
readers were really tricked by the tiny ha'-pennyworth of sack
into consuming the intolerable quantity of very dry bread.
Obviously in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mere length
was not a deterrent, because there was an immense amount of time
for vacant minds to fill in and relatively very few books. So
that just as in distant colonies we will read home newspapers
with all the advertisements they contain three and four times
over, so the subjects of the James's, Charles's, and early
George's would accept almost anything that could be read or
listened to and probably from being attuned to prolixities they
would have disliked anything crisp if anything crisp had been to
be found.</p>
<p>That is perhaps a vain speculation, but a short consideration
of the first great English novelist, who was for a time at least
nearly solely novelist, would lead one to believe that such was
indeed the case. Defoe was born about the time of the restoration
of Charles II&mdash;that is to say, in 1660 or 1661&mdash;and
died in 1731, aged in consequence about seventy. And it is
interesting to note that his novels were all produced in the last
twelve years of his life&mdash;as an expedient for procuring
bread and butter after bankruptcy produced by too ingenious
speculations both financial and philosophical.</p>
<p>That gets rid of the theory we might otherwise have
entertained that he was a Restoration novelist in the sense that
the friends of Charles II were Restoration dramatists.
Nevertheless, the active portions of Defoe's life were so passed
in the seventeenth century that it comes naturally to think of
him rather as Jacobean than Georgian or eighteenth century. It
is, that is to say, not in the pomposity of the eighteenth
century that Captain Singleton or Colonel Jack or Moll Flanders
seem to be clothed. They were rather mobile, swaggering,
piratical creatures seated on barrels and smoking their yards of
clay than strutters in brocades and ruffles. And probably Defoe's
ideal was the substantial London merchant, sturdily planted over
his stout calves on square feet. That was his ideal because he
had himself lamentably failed in attaining to it.</p>
<p>His financial ideas are said to have found favour in
succeeding ages; his plans for increasing the national revenues,
like Swift's, it is said, would have been admirable could they
have been adopted. So his moralities are practical rather than
theological&mdash;it was to the respectable suffrages of the
merchants that his pious passages addressed themselves. Thus his
moralizings may have been less hypocritical than those of most of
his contemporaries, his predecessors or descendants; but the
aspiring after respectability was none the less as marked.</p>
<p>What, however, is in him the most interesting from our special
point of view of tracing the development of the art of the novel
is the fact that Defoe may be called the first English or foreign
writer to strive after some sort of satisfactory convention for
the novel. He aimed, that is to say, at being convincing&mdash;at
convincing his reader that he was reading of real adventures set
in the, as it were, official biographies of real individuals.
Such fictitious documents as <i>The Apparition of Mrs. Veal,</i>
the <i>Memoirs of a Cavalier,</i> or the <i>History of the Plague
in London</i> are very near to historic forgeries and ought
perhaps to be regarded as fictitious journalism. For, whatever
else he was or wasn't, Defoe was the first great journalist.</p>
<p>His <i>Review of the Affairs of France,</i> which was a
periodical news-pamphlet devoting itself to foreign affairs and
what to-day we should call Town Topics, was no doubt Defoe's
introduction to fiction. When, that is to say, foreign news ran
out he filled in his space with the chronicles of an invented
Scandalous Club and there, a little in the style of La
Bruy&egrave;re and still more in the style of the later
<i>Tatlers, Ramblers,</i> and <i>Spectators,</i> he presented the
Town with slightly scandalous anecdotes of characters purely
fictitious or suggested faintly by well-known living men.</p>
<p>From that to inventing false news as in the case of the
<i>Mrs. Veal</i> fascicule and from that again to the production
of sham autobiography like <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a very
obvious progression. Few journalists would make it to-day, but
to-day news being more common is more easily checked. Be that as
it may, there is no doubt that, whether it were his intention or
no, he did evolve a convention for fiction that up to a certain
point was effective enough. That he intended so to do there is
not, as was on the other hand the case with his great successor
Samuel Richardson, any evidence. On the contrary, there is a good
deal of evidence that several of his works of fiction were really
intended as mystifications or frauds on the public.</p>
<p>That does not interfere with the artistic merit of his work,
which was very great. For whether you set out to hypnotize the
public into believing for the time being that they have attended
at a scene, or trick them into believing that they have read real
memoirs when the memoirs are fictitious, the artistic, if not the
ethical, results are nearly equal. There is, however, this
difference:</p>
<p>If you should read <i>Salammbo</i> and should be asked if you
had ever been in Carthage before its destruction by the Romans
you might almost answer in the affirmative with truth, whereas in
the same scale of things if you were asked if you had been
present at the Fire of London and had read Defoe's <i>History</i>
you could not answer more than that you had read a very authentic
account by an eye-witness. And inasmuch as an authentic
rendering&mdash;a rendering made with extreme artistic
skill&mdash;will give you more the sense of having been present
at an event than if you had actually been corporeally present,
whereas the reading of the most skilful of literary forgeries
will only leave you with the sense that you have read a book, the
artistic rendering is the more valuable to you and therefore the
greater achievement. I once heard a couple of French marine
engineers agreeing that although they had traversed the Indian
Ocean many times and had several times passed through, or through
the fringes of, typhoons, neither of them had ever been in one
till they had read Conrad's <i>Typhoon.</i> And indeed I have
myself had the singular experience of looking out at dawn from a
tent-flap and seeing the tents of a sleeping army running up into
deep woods. And having just been reading Stephen Crane's <i>Red
Badge of Courage,</i> which opens with the description of the
dawn breaking on the tents of a sleeping army, for some minutes I
was confused, not being able to understand why the one or two men
that I saw about were dressed in our khaki instead of in the blue
of the Federal troops of the United States during the Civil War.
That is what I mean by saying that one might answer with truth
that one had been present at a rendered scene although one might
never physically have been present there. For to me it is certain
that I was at that given moment more present at the preparation
of a battle somewhere near Gettysburg in the 'sixties of last
century than actually amongst British troops in support at a
battle that was then proceeding in the Belgian Salient in
September, 1916.</p>
<p>To produce that or similar effects is the ambition of the
novel of to-day.</p>
<p>Two centuries before&mdash;by, say, 1716&mdash;the novel had
proceeded but a very little way. I should say that Bunyan in the
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> and still more in <i>The Holy War</i>
had gone as far as any writer till that day and dying in 1688 he
anticipated Defoe as novelist by at least a generation.
Ostensibly the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> is an allegorical work
just as the English Bible is a theological or even a doctrinal
one; but just as in the Morality Plays which were produced by
professionally religious writers or actors and the Mysteries
which were religious spectacles produced and acted under the
direction of clerics by members of the professedly lay
Guilds&mdash;just as in those productions the real attraction was
the imaginative presentation of realities rather than the pious
aspirations of authors or producers, so it is strongly to be
suspected that the realistically human appeal of the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> far outweighs the moral or religious interests.
Indeed in <i>The Holy War</i>, which is an allegorical
presentation of the eternal struggle between the unseen forces
that make for good and evil on earth, the presentation of
seventeenth-century warfare is for long passages so realistic
that one might accuse Bunyan of having thrown up the moral sponge
and of taking a pagan pleasure in fighting for fighting's sake.
He renders, in short, battles of the Great Rebellion in which he
took part or on whose outskirts he was present. He rendered them
and did not write about them.</p>
<p>But the moral fervour and fierce sincerity of Bunyan are so
far above suspicion that the mere fact that at times he was
carried away in a sheer outburst of the artist's spirit and love
of terrestrial aspects for the mere sake of those
aspects&mdash;his moral fervour is so great and so deserving of
respect that no slightest tang of hypocrisy can attach to him any
more than it can attach to the translators of the English Bible.
And, if we except Smollett and possibly Samuel Richardson who was
the real great precursor of the modern novel, we cannot say as
much for any other English novelist who wrote before the later
years of the nineteenth century. For it is impossible to absolve
such writers as Defoe, Fielding, or Thackeray from the charge of
deliberately writing with their tongues in their cheeks passages
of virtuous aspirations that were in no way any aspirations of
theirs and that in consequence very seriously detracted from the
value of their works as art.</p>
<p>With Bunyan that was not the case. He desired to inculcate
certain moral teachings and he had the sense to see that the best
way to inculcate a doctrine and to get it deep into the brain and
marrow of the reader was to make him be vicariously present at
scenes the contemplation of which would cause certain moral or
practical ideas to arise in the mind. And the deservedly
prodigious&mdash;the deservedly unrivalled popular appeal of the
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> is sufficient testimony at once to the
immense skill and the unparalleledly simple moral fervour of its
author. For the reader attending on the episode of the Slough of
Despond is actually in a bog a little way away from his native
town and the man who reads of Giant Despair is in all truth
confronted with either Gog or Magog of the Lord Mayor's
procession in the very flesh. At any rate, it is to be remembered
that, the world over, together with the <i>Imitation of
Christ</i> and <i>Madame Bovary,</i> the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> is the most read book in Christendom. And this we
must put down to the artistic skill&mdash;to the power of
presentation and of rendering of the author.</p>
<p>For there is no other criterion of art but success, and the
more lasting the success the better the art. I wish to strike
that note very strongly because as soon as one begins to talk
about an art misinterpretations come creeping in and one is at
once suspected of at the least asserting one's possession of
superior knowledges or&mdash;let us say&mdash;of high-hafting
one's neighbour. Nothing is less true. The knowledge of the art
of novel writing is open to every one who takes the trouble to
like one book better than another and the literary tastes of men
are fairly identical the world over and throughout time. The
great art of the world is found in books that are familiar to
millions, if not the world over, then, at any rate, down several
ages of several continents.</p>
<p>The difference between Bunyan and his predecessors is one more
than anything of whole-heartedness and if there is only one work
of fiction&mdash;for one can hardly call the Bible a work of
fiction&mdash;if there is one work of prose fiction in England
that, written before the birth of Bunyan, has survived to our
time it is Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> and that survives
because Malory whole-heartedly and unassumingly collected such
legends of the Arthurian cycle as he liked and wrote them down
simply and without flourishes. Otherwise, none of the
pre-Elizabethan prose romances could to-day be read with any
other than archaeological pleasure, nor could any of the prose
fiction which began to be mildly abundant in late Elizabethan and
early Jacobean days. I suppose you might read Deloney's <i>Jack
of Newbury</i> with some pleasure if you were interested in
Elizabethan guild or household mysteries. But I cannot imagine
anyone reading for pleasure either <i>Euphues</i> or Greene's
<i>Menaphon,</i> either Lodge's <i>Rosalynde</i> or even Sidney's
<i>Arcadia.</i> One may glance at them from time to time, more or
less in order to keep one's end up against the literary
archeologist, but they would all, including <i>Amadis de
Gaul,</i> prove intolerable as books for "reading in"&mdash;to
use an old phrase which meant a long, long, engrossed perusal.
Nash's <i>Jack of Wilton</i> has been compared to <i>Don
Quixote,</i> but there is no sense in reading the Englishman's
satire of forgotten manners when one can re-read Cervantes'
satire on things that are at the root of the human heart.</p>
<p>The difference between Malory and the earlier romances or
<i>Euphues</i> or <i>Menaphon</i> is simply the difference in the
relative sincerities of their authors. Malory records what a
simple mediaeval knight liked and to some extent how he looked at
the world: it is modest and, its author being wrapped up in his
subject, the work has no eye to the modes of the time&mdash;or to
displaying the cleverness of the writer. You can engross yourself
in the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> if your tastes lie in the least in
Malory's direction and, except that finally you may arrive at the
conclusion that he was a modest and pleasant gentleman, you need
never give the author a thought.</p>
<p>With <i>Amadis de Gaul</i> or <i>Euphues,</i> on the other
hand, you are for ever thinking of the cleverness of the author.
And you are meant to think of the cleverness of the author, and
so you are in the case of <i>Rosalynde</i> and an enormous
proportion of the Elizabethan drama. The prose and even the blank
verse of that age sparkled with trope, metaphor, image, simile,
plays upon words, conceits and every type of verbal felicity, so
that the last thing that comes to the mind in the case of almost
any work of that age is the subject treated of.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands&mdash;nay millions&mdash;of readers have
read the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>
without giving a thought to or even knowing the name of Defoe or
Bunyan. I asked the other day in France a child who was reading
about Crusoe who had written it and she replied: "Je crois que
c'est par...par Madame de S&eacute;gur...Ou non: peut-&ecirc;tre,
Madame d'Aulnoy. Enfin, je n'y ai jamais pens&eacute;." And that
is about the highest compliment that could be paid to Defoe. I
may as well add the same child's comment on the story itself. She
did not much like <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> because, she said, the
sufferings depicted in it were true. She liked, like all
children, to read of sufferings, bloodsheddings, and horrors but
only as long as she could believe that they were invented,
whereas she was of opinion that the prolonged loneliness and
fears of Crusoe had actually occurred. Similarly she found the
story of the Crucifixion insupportable. The root of all adult
criticism is to be found in those revelations.</p>
<p>As long, that is to say, as a work remains in fashion you can
be contented to read it in order to remain in the fashion
yourself. It matters very little to you that whereas <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> is just <i>Robinson Crusoe,</i> or <i>Othello</i> just
<i>Othello, Euphues</i> is Lyly's <i>Euphues,</i> the <i>Groat's
Forth of Wit</i> Greene's <i>Groat's Worth</i> or the <i>Spanish
Tragedy</i> Kyd's <i>Spanish Tragedy.</i> For it is impossible to
talk of almost any sixteenth-century work without prefixing the
author's name, if the name is known&mdash;simply because the
attraction, and even the attraction that it once had, lies and
lay in the verbal juggleries of the author. I must have read
<i>Euphues</i> once at least right through and have looked into
it several times&mdash;but I have not the least idea what it is
all about. And even although I have read Lyly's <i>Campaspe</i>
once or twice, I remember only that the plot is a classical plot
and the lyric:</p>
<blockquote>Cupid and my Campaspe played<br>
At cards for kisses, Cupid paid...</blockquote>
<p>The fact is that with Elizabeth English became a supple and
easily employable language and, making the discovery that words
could be played with as if they were oranges or gilt balls to be
tossed half a dozen together in the air, mankind rushed upon it
as colts will dash into suddenly opened rich and easy pastures.
So it was, for the rich and cultured, much more a matter of who
could kick heels the higher and most flourish tail and mane than
any ambition of carrying burdens or drawing loads.</p>
<p>In the end, however, what humanity needs is that burdens
should be carried, and provided that things get from place to
place the name of carter or horse is of very secondary
importance. If it is in the fashion we will go down to the meadow
and watch the colts cavorting: but all the while we are aware
that the business of words as of colts or of the arts is to carry
things and we tire reasonably soon of watching horse-play! For if
I say: "I am hungry," the business of those words is to carry
that information to you, and if you read the <i>Iliad</i> it is
that the art of that epic may make Hecuba significant to you.
Consider the prose of Cranmer!</p>
<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER THREE. TOWARDS
FLAUBERT</h2>
<p>It may at first sight seem curious that a section of a small
work devoted to the English&mdash;and of course the
American&mdash;Novel should be captioned with the name of a
French novelist. But in the first place the art and still more
the frame of mind of the Sage of Croisset are so deep-embedded in
the art and frame of mind of the English and still more of the
American novelist and all thought of the great, Nordic work of
"that poor dear Gustave," as Mr. Henry James used to call him, is
so cast out of all French literary practices or aspirations
to-day that if Flaubert is not an English novelist his Titanic
and Norman ghost has no place at all. To state one of those
half-truths that are infinitely illuminating, you may say that
without <i>Madame Bovary, Babbitt</i> could never have existed
and without <i>Bouvard et Pecuchet</i> there could have been no
<i>Way of All Flesh.</i> For all I know Mr. Sinclair Lewis may
never have read a word of Flaubert and I will bet my hat that,
for the purposes of this discussion, the shade of Samuel Butler
would declare that he knew no French at all. But the point is
that, without those two works in French, those two national
monuments in English could hardly at this time exist or weigh
with the public since the public would not be prepared for
them.</p>
<p>Let us go a step further and declare that without Cranmer we
should have had another three centuries to wait for Flaubert,
Henry James, Stephen Crane, Joseph Conrad, Mr. John Galsworthy,
and my friend "Red" Lewis. For without the English Prayer Book
and its follower in date and style the English Bible, with or
without Cranmer's suppressed preface, and without the followers
in date and style of Defoe, Bunyan, and Samuel Richardson, how
should we have to-day any English prose, novel-form or any
English frame of mind? Or any Anglo-American Concord literature;
or any British Empire or any Anglo-Saxon anything?</p>
<p>You may say that that is stretching things a little. And yet I
do not know that it is. Let us make concessions. If you will
concede to me my little point about the descent of the English
Novel from Cranmer's prayer book and the English
Bible&mdash;which cannot matter to you at all, I will willingly
concede to you that it was the phraseology if not the doctrine of
the Book of Common Prayer and the frame of mind of the Old
Testament As By Law Appointed that gave to England the Empire of
India and to the world the United States of North America, those
two shining products of English stiff-necknedness and
non-theological Bible-reading. For how without the Books of Kings
could either Clive or, say, Andrew Jackson have found heart or
courage to continue in their courses? Of course a thought or so
might be given to North's <i>Plutarch</i> that was published in
1579.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, what I am here getting at is the fact that
preceding and underlying the ornate florescences of Lyly and the
prodigious formlessnesses of Spenser and preceding and underlying
the incredible verbal felicity and neat plottings of Shakespeare
himself went the stream of dogged, menacing prose and the
realist's native imagery of those two religious compilations. And
that subterranean stream immensely fecundated&mdash;to make no
larger claim&mdash;at once the Anglo-Saxon national character and
the literature that is to be found in the English language.</p>
<p>I am aware that here we are on ticklish ground and that
reformers and the advanced generally deny with a great deal of
heat that literature has any influence at all on peoples. I
remember once being furiously lectured by the most moral and one
of the most advanced of English novelists&mdash;being furiously
and minatorily taken to task because mildly and to make
conversation I alleged that <i>Don Quixote</i> had something to
do with the passing of the sham chivalric spirit in Europe. The
lecture was indeed so furious that, being a non-combative person
and caring nothing about the matter, I have from that day to this
rather given up considering the subject at all. You see, my
friend the novelist was so notoriously virtuous and benevolent
that hitherto I should have hated to hurt his feelings by
advancing that anyone could be influenced by any book at all. For
what he alleged, like an apostle announcing some kind of creed,
was that populaces influence literature&mdash;that Cervantes was
produced because a widespread spirit of mockery for chivalry,
real or sham, was so abroad in the world that <i>Don Quixote</i>
was written merely in answer to a demand, as articles on the
Calcutta Sweepstake are written about the time when Derby Day
approaches.</p>
<p>As to that I am no authority and the reader must settle for
himself whether that hen or that egg came first&mdash;I mean
whether the spirit of the English populace demanded first the
English Prayer Book and the English Bible and demanded afterwards
in due course the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> and <i>Robinson
Crusoe,</i> or whether the English Bible so influenced the
English people that they demanded in due course the works of
Bunyan and Defoe. Or as a third proposition: Did the English
Bible so influence Bunyan and both so influence Defoe that in the
end the product was <i>Pamela,</i> the short tales of Diderot,
the novels of Stendhal, Flaubert, and his successors and so on
until the novel of to-day was arrived at?</p>
<p>As I have said, I do not immensely care about the matter.
Bunyan may never have read the Bible, Defoe may never have read
Bunyan, or Richardson Defoe. But it makes such a convenient
pattern to assume that writers are descended the one from the
other that I mean to assume it and the reader must modify the
theory how he will.</p>
<p>Regarded from that point of view, in pre- as in
post-Elizabethan days and underlying Elizabethan days themselves,
you did have that stern but decorated prose and that
determination to rely on illustrations, parables, and images
drawn solely from material to be found about normal people the
world over and throughout time; simultaneously, on the surface of
things you had a courtlier and more elaborated prose which had
the Sublime as its ideal and nothing less vulgar than passages
modelled on Juvenal or the plays of Plautus for its light relief.
The Bible says: "Take us the little foxes, the foxes that eat our
grapes" as an illustration of love, and "He shall feed his sheep"
as the highest expression of the divine functionings of the
Saviour. The <i>Faerie Queene</i> cannot deal with any fox or any
hound of lower extraction than Cerberus and the only redeemer who
could have saved the world for the writers of Romances was, in
his panoply, King Arthur with Lancelot, Gawain, and the rest of
his apostles all pricking over the plains of Camelot.</p>
<p>So let us say that it was to the homespun illustrations, the
simple imagery and the stern diction of the Bible that we owe
Bunyan&mdash;for obviously Bunyan read the Scriptures, year in
and year out, during a lifetime of Bedford Gaol, of persecution
and turmoil, whereas the only remains of the courtlier modes are
found to come from North's <i>Plutarch</i> which influenced
profoundly Shakespeare and possibly Sir Thomas Browne. But
Shakespeare obviously could not have any successors and Browne
found none till R. L. S. came to be his sedulous ape. So that the
influence of North's translation remained, if profound, at least
rather ethical than literary&mdash;until it was finally ousted by
the versions of the Langhornes and Church's of days much more
modern.</p>
<p>Our space not being boundless we must now skip to Richardson.
For Richardson I have the profoundest respect that amounts as
nearly as possible to an affection&mdash;if that is to say it is
possible to have an affection for a man whose death preceded
one's birth by one hundred and twelve years. I do not apologize
for the fact that <i>Pamela</i> is my personal favourite, whereas
the graver critics and mankind in general prefer <i>Clarissa.</i>
By that the reader need not be guided, but he should certainly
pay a good deal of attention to the works of Richardson&mdash;and
indeed to Richardson himself.</p>
<p>That tranquil person came into the world in
1689&mdash;twenty-seven or eight years after the birth of Defoe
and one year after the death of Bunyan. But whereas both of his
predecessors seem to strike notes almost entirely of the
seventeenth century, Richardson seems to be absolutely of the
eighteenth and, with him, sentimentality was born in the world of
the novel. That perhaps was necessary to an age that banished if
not conventional, then at least doctrinal, moralizings to its
collections of sermons in volume form. For them of course there
was a prodigious demand.</p>
<p>Of course, too, it would be wrong to assert that moralizing
found no place in the novels of Richardson since the high moral
purpose breathes from every pore of his pages. But it was not
with moralizing that he made his primary appeal as had been the
case with Bunyan, nor was it likely that had he so done he would
have found many readers. No, it is his sentimentalizing that is
his E string.</p>
<p>Against that I have nothing to say. Anglo-Saxons are
sentimentalists before everything and in all their arts, and it
is probable that without sentimentality as an ingredient no
Anglo-Saxon artist could work: certainly he could have no appeal.
To produce national masterpieces in paint Turner must bathe his
canvases deep in that gentle fluid; the English lyric is a marvel
of sentimentality and so is English domestic architecture with
its mellow&mdash;or mellowed!&mdash;red brick, its dove-cotes,
its south walls for netted fruits. So the first of modern
novelists must be one of the greatest of sentimentalists. And on
those lines his appeal is universal and everlasting.</p>
<p>Only to-day an American left the ship on which I am writing in
the port of Lisbon and, I happening to mention because he was in
my mind the name of Richardson, this American&mdash;professor at
that and practitioner of a sister art&mdash;this American
gentleman assured me solemnly that he read <i>Clarissa
Harlowe</i> at least twice every year and cried often during each
reading. Now there must be some reason for this phenomenon, which
appears very singular. It is not, however, rare, for the hottest
literary discussions I have ever had in England&mdash;where, of
course, the discussion of literature is not in good
form&mdash;have been with laymen like professors or lawyers as to
the relative merits of <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Clarissa.</i></p>
<p>For me, I read Richardson for a hearty and wholesome dose of
sentimentality and if one does that one may as well have that
quality laid on as thickly as it will go. And it seems to me that
the history of a serving-maid who resists her master's efforts at
seduction and ultimately forces him to marry her is a more
sentimental affair than that of a young lady of quality who
permits herself to be seduced by a relatively commonplace
Lothario. For myself I have always felt inclined to cheer over
the success of the one young female rather than to weep for the
tribulations of the other. Pamela certainly seems to be the more
sporting character of the two.</p>
<p>Still, one should perhaps not read Richardson for his sporting
quality, and that sort of thing is really no affair of mine. The
main point is that Samuel Richardson is still read and read with
enthusiasm. I have even met persons who were engrossed by the
conversations in the Cedar Parlour of <i>Sir Charles
Grandison.</i></p>
<p>That Richardson's tender muse was at times too much for the
robuster and more cynical taste of his age is proved by the fact
that Fielding's first famous novel was begun as a parody on the
first famous novel of Richardson. By that date the novel of
commerce was well on the way to the market and young ladies lying
on sofas reading the latest fiction or furiously sending their
maids to the circulating libraries for the next five volumes of
their latest favourite&mdash;such young ladies were familiar
features of the social landscape. Literature had, in fact, become
a sound, if not an immensely lucrative, proposition.</p>
<p>And it is pleasant to think that, happy as he was in
everything that he touched, Richardson was not only novelist but
printer and publisher and quite a warm business man in either
capacity. He was, too, a favourite correspondent and companion of
innumerable young ladies who consulted him as to their amatory
predicaments and because of that he is not only the first
novelist in the modern sense of the word but also the first
literary feminist. You might call him an eighteenth-century Henry
James and not go so far wrong.</p>
<p>At any rate, he stands alone as a modern novelist and had in
England neither appreciable imitators nor rivals until the
arrival on the scene of the author of the <i>Barchester
Towers</i> series.</p>
<p>Except for Smollett&mdash;whom it is hopeless to expect
Anglo-Saxon readers to appreciate or to consume, the main stream
of development of the novel passed once more to the Continent of
Europe. Smollett begat Captain Marryat, who was one of the
greatest of English novelists and is therefore regarded as a
writer for boys, Smollett himself being most prized by the
purveyors of books called "curious" in second-hand
catalogues.</p>
<p>Before, however, considering Diderot, Stendhal, Chateaubriand,
and Flaubert, all avowed followers of the author of
<i>Clarissa,</i> it might be as well to think a little about
Fielding&mdash;as at once a dreadful example of how not to do
things and as the begetter of Thackeray and the product that it
is convenient to call the nuvvle as opposed to the novel. For at
about the date of the births of Napoleon, Wellington, Ney, and
many others who began the modern world, and just a little after
the death of Richardson, and just a little before the birth of
the North American Republic, and still a little more before the
Caesarian operation that produced the French Republic, distinct
cleavages began to make themselves observed in the fields of
writing, these eventually hardening themselves into the three
main streams of the Literature of Escape from the everyday world;
into the commercial product that Mamma selected for your reading,
that it is convenient to call the nuvvle and that formed the
immense bulk of the reading matter, and finally into the modern
novel which does not avoid the problems of the day and is written
with some literary skill. This last Richardson begat.</p>
<p>And it is convenient to say that Defoe, in spite of his
moralizations, was the first writer of the Literature of Escape,
just as Smollett and Marryat may be described as carrying it on
and the young H. G. Wells and the young Rudyard Kipling as
bringing it&mdash;at any rate temporarily&mdash;to a triumphant
close.</p>
<p>Were it not that they were avowed moralizers of a
middle-to-lower-middle-class type, the Fielding-to-Thackeray
lineage of writers might also be regarded as purveyors of the
Literature of Escape, but their continually brought-in passages
of moralizations are such a nuisance that they cannot be ignored.
Though they were both amateurs in the sense that neither knew how
to write or cared anything about it, Thackeray at times projected
his scenes so wonderfully that now and then he trembles
dreadfully excitingly on the point of passing from the stage of
purveyor of the nuvvle to that of the real novelist. And it is to
be said for Fielding that although <i>Tom Jones</i> contains an
immense amount of rather nauseous special-pleading, the author
does pack most of it away into solid wads of hypocrisy at the
headings of Parts or Chapters. These can in consequence be
skipped and the picaresque story with its mildly salacious
details can without difficulty be followed. One might indeed
almost say that Fielding was a natural story-teller, whereas
Thackeray was none at all. Fielding at least, like a story-teller
in a school dormitory, does manage to lose himself in details of
people running into and out of each others' bedrooms in hotel
corridors at night&mdash;something like that. But Thackeray never
could: the dread spectre of the Athenaeum Club was for ever in
his background.</p>
<p>And I imagine that the greatest literary crime ever committed
was Thackeray's sudden, apologetic incursion of himself into his
matchless account of the manoeuvres of Becky Sharp on Waterloo
day in Brussels. The greatest crime that anyone perhaps ever
committed! For the motive of most crimes is so obscure, so
pathological or so fatalized by hereditary weakness, that there
is almost nothing that cannot be pardoned once one has dived
beneath the calm surface of things. But Thackeray as
child-murderer can never be forgiven: the deeper you delve into
the hidden springs of his offence the more unforgivable does he
appear.</p>
<p>I had better perhaps explain the cause of all this emotion for
the benefit of the lay reader who has not yet got at what I am
writing about.</p>
<p>The struggle&mdash;the aspiration&mdash;of the novelist down
the ages has been to evolve a water-tight convention for the
framework of the novel. He aspires&mdash;and for centuries has
aspired&mdash;so to construct his stories and so to manage their
surfaces that the carried-away and rapt reader shall really think
himself to be in Brussels on the first of Waterloo days or in
Grand Central Station waiting for the Knickerbocker Express to
come in from Boston though actually he may be sitting in a cane
lounge on a beach of Bermuda in December. This is not easy.</p>
<p>Of the three major novelists that we have hitherto examined
each in his own way had a try, consciously or unconsciously, at
performing this conjuring trick. Bunyan tried to do it&mdash;and
succeeded remarkably well&mdash;by the simplest of story-teller's
devices. He just told on in simple language, using such simple
images that the reader, astonished and charmed to find the
circumstances of his own life typified in words and glorified by
print, is seized by the homely narrative and carried clean out of
himself into the world of that singular and glorious tinker.</p>
<p>Defoe, on the other hand, in the conscious or unconscious
effort to achieve a convention for the novel, adopted the
biographical or autobiographical form, relying on the
verisimilitude of the details that he invented to confirm the
reader in the belief that his characters had really existed and
so to awaken the sympathy that makes books readable. And had he
possessed a little more power of projection or a little more
subtlety in presenting his figures and had his writing been a
little less pedestrian his works might have gained and held the
power to arouse a great deal more enthusiasm than they actually
do.</p>
<p>Richardson, going a good deal further, has left it on record
that he was actually bothered by the problem of the novelistic
convention and that he racked his brain a long time before
arriving at the one he finally adopted. He asked himself, that is
to say, how the reader was to be convinced that the
author&mdash;and by analogy still more his characters&mdash;how
could they know all the details that go to making up a book? If,
to reduce the matter to its most elementary form, Sir Charles
Grandison is walking in the Yew Walk, how can he know what
characters are present and what conversations are being carried
on in the Cedar Parlour, and since, to satisfy the reader, the
author is to be supposed to be cognizant of all that passes in
his novel, how is <i>he</i> to know simultaneously what is
happening in both places?</p>
<p>That at least is what bothered Richardson and what has
bothered all other novelists since his day, though until quite
lately no English novelist made any serious attempt to attack the
problem. The method that Richardson with characteristically
homespun common sense eventually worked out was simply to cast
the whole novel into correspondence, the characters exchanging
letters as to events and as to their psychologies with other
characters or with anyone to whom a letter could be handily
addressed. In that way any character who was needed to know
anything could be given the information and the author had only
to let it be supposed that he had an unusual knack of getting
hold of the correspondence of other people to convince the reader
for all eighteenth-century purposes. For in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, as every one knows, every one from Madame
de Sevign&eacute; upwards and downwards addressed to every one
else letters of prodigious length and in the most excruciating
detail&mdash;and Richardson himself, as we have seen, had a
prodigious knowledge of the prodigious letters that
eighteenth-century young ladies could address to even unknown
correspondents once their hearts and feelings were touched. So
that although to-day the letter is one of the worst of methods
that exist for telling a story if the dictates of probability are
to be considered, Richardson may be considered to have done very
well indeed with his peculiar form.</p>
<p>To its disadvantages in other hands we shall come in due time,
but meanwhile enormous applause is due to the author of
<i>Pamela</i> for having given the matter any thought at all. And
in any case his is a figure so sympathetic and so craftsmanlike
that we do well to love him. He is sound, quiet, without fuss,
going about his work as a carpenter goes about making a chair and
in the end turning out an article of supreme symmetry and
consistence. I know of no other figure in English
literature&mdash;if it be not that of Trollope&mdash;who so
suggests the two supreme artists of the world&mdash;Holbein and
Bach.</p>
<p>It would be hyperbole to suggest that Richardson is as great
in his art as either of the other two. He had neither their power
over their materials nor their sense of the beauty of natural
things. Our gratitude to him nevertheless should be great, for he
worked with the simplest materials and manoeuvred only the most
normal of characters in the most commonplace of events and yet
contrived to engross the minds of a large section of mankind. How
to do that is the problem that, Richardson having been dead a
century and a half, still engrosses the novelist.</p>
<p>And what more than anything is impressive about his figure is
that one knows almost nothing about it: he is as little overdrawn
as are his characters, whereas the besetting sin of almost all
other English novelists from Fielding to George Meredith is that
they seem to cut their characters out with hatchets and to colour
them with the brushes of house-painters and, never, even at that,
being able to let them alone, they are perpetually pushing their
own faces and winking at you over the shoulders of Young Blifil,
Uncle Toby, the Widow Wadman, Dick Swiveller, the Marchioness,
Becky Sharp, Evan Harrington, and the rest. That is usually
applauded by orthodox Anglo-Saxon criticism and to talk of the
gallery of portraits left by this or that novelist is considered
to be high praise indeed. But, as a matter of fact, the
overdrawing of characters is merely a symptom of the laziness and
contempt for their vehicle that is the too usual hall-mark of the
English writer of nuvvles. And that it should be tremendously
applauded is a symptom of the disdain that the English critic
really feels for the novel. If English painting consisted of
nothing but the caricatures of Rowlandson, Gillray, or
Cruikshank, the art-critic would discover very soon that that
grew monotonous, but since it is merely a matter of prose-fiction
it is easily accepted as good enough; that which is too stupid to
be said in any other way being consigned to the novel.</p>
<p>Of course if you choose to consider Swift and, say, Beckford
as novelists you do arrive at something that you must, as you
might say, chew upon&mdash;at something that has some mental
dignity; and Smollett presents you with problems of humanity that
are at least worth consideration. And naturally great vital
spirits like Dickens, floundering away in oceans of words and
eccentricities, will from time to time hit upon collocations of
words and confrontations of characters that are unsurpassed in
the literature of any time or nation. But from the death of Swift
to the publication of <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> there is very
little to be found in the English novel that is not slightly
unworthy of the whole attention of a grown-up man&mdash;say of a
grown-up Frenchman.</p>
<p>I have adumbrated somewhere&mdash;in some previous
pessimism!&mdash;the perturbation that must beset any Anglo-Saxon
who desired to point out to almost any grown-up foreigner of
average intelligence the glories of the English novel before,
say, the day of the <i>Yellow Book.</i> Let us then examine with
a little more attention the chief lights of that Institution
between, say, 1745, the year of the death of Swift, and, say,
1890, when the <i>Yellow Book</i> was well on the way.</p>
<p>Swift himself is obviously one of those solitary figures like,
in their different ways, Shakespeare or Smollett or the author of
<i>The Way of All Flesh.</i> In a sense he resembles Bunyan, that
is to say he wrote allegories which, as a literary <i>genre,</i>
are usually tiresome and unconvincing; but in his case, as in
that of Bunyan, his fierce powers of observation and rendering
carry him, as it were, in spite of himself, into the realms of
realism. It is to be doubted if Swift ever aimed&mdash;as did,
say, Mr. H. G. Wells in, say, <i>The First Men in the
Moon,</i>&mdash;at giving the reader the sense of vicarious
experience. Nevertheless he got there all the same and the
corrosive nature of his misanthropy almost aids the sense of
reality with which he overwhelms us. The "purpose" of
<i>Gulliver's Travels</i> was no doubt philosophic, as the
purpose of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> was moral; but Lilliput
is as real to us as the Slough of Despond and the Yahoos are the
figures of the most horrible experience of every man who has come
across them.</p>
<p>So that if to your intelligent&mdash;and of course slightly
cynical&mdash;foreigner you presented <i>Gulliver</i> and left it
at that he might remain edified or horror-struck according as his
individual frame of mind were pessimist or the other thing. But
supposing you were to present him with the Steele-cum-Addison
collaboration of the <i>Tatler</i> or the <i>Spectator</i> or
with <i>Tom Jones</i> itself, which was written about a quarter
of a century later than <i>Gulliver</i> and thirty years or so
after the last number of the <i>Spectator</i> appeared in 1714:
and supposing you added&mdash;yes, certainly, suppose you add
<i>Tristram Shandy</i> and the <i>Sentimental Journey,</i> the
first appearing or being written between 1760 and 1767 and the
second being published in 1768! Keep up your sleeve Tobias
Smollett whose <i>Humphry Clinker</i> was published three years
after the <i>Sentimental Journey</i> and in the year of
Smollett's death at the age of fifty. And let us conclude this
immediate inquiry of ours as ending with the awful name of the
Wizard of the North who was born in the year of Smollett's death
and lived to be sixty.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Defoe in his <i>Advice from the Scandalous
Club,</i> that was a "feature" of his periodical <i>Review of the
Affairs of France,</i> very little anticipated&mdash;but by five
years, indeed&mdash;what may be regarded as the fiction of the
Addison-Steele collaboration. One is so apt to regard Defoe as of
the seventeenth and Addison as of the eighteenth centuries that
this appears rather astonishing, but actually the <i>Review</i>
ran from 1704 to 1715 and the <i>Tatler</i> plus <i>Spectator</i>
from 1709 to 1714. Defoe's publication was so essentially
commercial and the other two so essentially social that the
matter is rather one of chronology than comparison.</p>
<p>The fact that the novel had not yet begun as a commercial
"proposition" to come into its own reduced Addison and Steele no
doubt from the rank of novelists to those of draftsmen of
"characters." The novels of Defoe were "faked" memoirs and the
other fiction of the period mostly consisted of equally "faked"
memoirs of persons of quality, court-mistresses, and the like.
And the "characters" and sham correspondence about social
questions of the day that characterized the <i>Spectator</i> may
well be considered as developments of those popular, fictitious
productions. Sir Roger de Coverley, Will Wimble, and the rest are
as it were the characters of a novel, standing about and waiting
for employment as the leaden soldiers of a child await their
owner's orders to fall in.</p>
<p>The idea of sustained fiction might indeed, if you liked and
if you analysed the matter very closely, be said not by any means
yet to have reached the public consciousness, and though for us
<i>Clarissa</i> may seem to be the first of novels, its peculiar
form&mdash;of correspondence&mdash;may well, in the public mind
of its day, have given it the aspect of the last of the spurious
memoirs. And, considering the nature of the future influence of
Richardson over the French realists from Diderot to Flaubert, it
may be more accurate to regard that aspect as the truer one. For,
in effect, the French realist movement from Diderot's <i>Le Neveu
de Rameau</i> to <i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i> and again to
<i>Madame Bovary</i> may in the last event be regarded as much
more a movement for the production of fictitious memoirs than the
narration of sustained tales, the difference between Richardson,
Flaubert, and Joseph Conrad or Turgenev being simply one of form.
Richardson, that is to say, tried to assure you that Clarissa was
a real person by the mechanical device of publishing her letters,
whilst Flaubert and his school try to hypnotize you into
believing in their characters by methods of projection rather
than of narration.</p>
<p>And the trouble with the English nuvvelist from Fielding to
Meredith is that not one of them cares whether you quite believe
in their characters or not. If you had told Flaubert or Conrad in
the midst of their passionate composings that you were not
convinced of the reality of Homais or Tuan Jim, as like as not
they would have called you out and shot you, and in similar
circumstances Richardson would have showed himself extremely
disagreeable. But Fielding, Thackeray, or Meredith would have
cared relatively little about that, though any one of them would
have knocked you down if they could, supposing you had suggested
that he was not a "gentleman." So would any English novelist
to-day.</p>
<p>That of course is admirable in its effect on Anglo-Saxon
literary-social life where anyone taking pen in hand becomes
<i>ipso facto</i> an esquire for all users of type-writing
machines. But it is bitter bad for the English novel.</p>
<p>It is bitter bad for the English novel because&mdash;as is the
case with all human enterprises&mdash;the art of the novel is so
difficult a thing that unless a man's whole energies are given to
it he had much better otherwise occupy himself. For if
Shakespeare's ambitions for coat-armour had antedated instead of
coming after <i>The Tempest,</i> where should we be today? We
have to thank our stars that he was probably first a lousy,
adulterous, poaching scoundrel&mdash;like Villon!</p>
<p>The lot of the novelist is, in fact, hard&mdash;but not harder
than that of any other man. If you put it to bakers,
tram-conductors, politicians, or musicians that they must be
first bakers and the rest and then gentlemen, they will sigh, but
admit it. It is almost only the English novelist who will aspire
at being first gentleman and then craftsman&mdash;or even not
craftsman at all since it is not really gentlemanly to think of
being anything but a gentleman.</p>
<p>This is an incisive way of putting a truth that might perhaps
be more wrapped up in social or material generalizations, but it
is none the less a hard truth, and if you consider the case of
Fielding, connected with the best families, placeman and
diplomatist in a small way, and compare him with Smollett who was
socially nothing at all with no chance of a change, you will see
that truth all the more clearly.</p>
<p>God forbid that I should say anything really condemnatory of
any book by any brother-novelist, alive or dead. One is here to
commend all that one can commend and to leave the rest alone. But
there are few books that I more cordially dislike than <i>Tom
Jones.</i> That is no critical pronouncement but merely a
statement of a personal prejudice: one may dislike grape-fruit
and yet acknowledge its admirable qualities, or one may, as I do,
dislike the quality of goose-flesh that reading Mr. George Moore
will confer on one's skin and yet acknowledge Mr. Moore as easily
the greatest of living technicians.</p>
<p>But as regards <i>Tom Jones</i> my personal dislike goes along
with a certain cold-blooded, critical condemnation. I dislike Tom
Jones, the character, because he is a lewd, stupid, and
treacherous phenomenon; I dislike Fielding, his chronicler,
because he is a bad sort of hypocrite. Had Fielding been in the
least genuine in his moral aspirations it is Blifil that he would
have painted attractively and Jones who would have come to the
electric chair, as would have been the case had Jones lived
to-day.</p>
<p>Of course that is merely saying that Fielding liked a type
that I dislike&mdash;but what appalls me in view of the serious,
cynical foreigner that I have postulated our taking about with us
is the extremely thin nature of all the character-drawing, of all
the events and of all the catastrophes. Is it to be seriously
believed that Tom Jones's benefactor would have turned upon him
on the flimsy nature of the evidence adduced against him, or,
equally, is it to be believed that Tom Jones's young woman would
have again taken up with him after all the eye-openers she had
had, she being represented as a girl of spirit? It simply isn't
in any world of any seriousness at all. The fact, in short, is
that Tom Jones is a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; figure, the
catastrophes the merest invention without any pretence at being
convincing and even the mere morality of the most leering and
disastrous kind.</p>
<p>For myself, I am no moralist: I consider that if you do what
you want you must take what you get for it and that if you deny
yourself things you will be better off than if you don't. But
fellows like Fielding, and to some extent Thackeray, who pretend
that if you are a gay drunkard, lecher, squanderer of your goods
and fumbler in placket-holes you will eventually find a
benevolent uncle, concealed father or benefactor who will shower
on you bags of tens of thousands of guineas, estates and the
hands of adorable mistresses&mdash;those fellows are dangers to
the body politic and horribly bad constructors of plots.</p>
<p>It is all very well to say that such happy endings were the
convention of the day, that you find them in the <i>School for
Scandal, The Vicar of Wakefield</i> and in every
eighteenth-century romance that you pick up out of the twopenny
book-box, and it is all very well to say that the public demands
a happy ending. But the really great writer is not bound by the
conventions of his day, nor, if he desires to give his reader a
happy ending, need he select a wastrel like Jones as the
recipient of his too easily bestowed favours.</p>
<p>If, in short, we are to regard Fielding as a serious writer
writing for grown-up people, we must regard him also as a rather
intolerable scoundrel with perhaps <i>Jonathan Mild</i> to his
credit. But <i>Jonathan Wild</i> is of another category and,
neither winking nor leering, might be regarded as the finger on
the wall, pointing out what happens to the Tom Joneses of the
world if their case is regarded with any seriousness.</p>
<p>But the fact is that for a century and a half after the death
of Fielding nothing in the Anglo-Saxon world was further from
anyone, either novelist or layman, than the idea that the novel
could be taken seriously. It was a thing a little above a
fairy-tale for children, a little above a puppet-play; and, if
not actually as damned socially and clerically as the actor who
could not be either received at court or buried in consecrated
ground, the novelist was practically without what the French call
an <i>&eacute;tat civil</i> because his was not a serious
profession. In England that state of things still pertains. In
the demobilization forms after the late War the novelist was
actually placed in the eighteenth category&mdash;along with
gipsies, vagrants, and other non-productive persons; and my last
public act in Great Britain being to allow my name to be placed
on a list of voters, when I gave my avocation to the political
agent as being that of a novelist, he exclaimed: "Oh, don't say
that, sir. Say 'Gentleman'!" He was anxious that his list should
appear as serious as possible.</p>
<p>That being the state of things and the novelist being human
for you cannot be a novelist and lack the ordinary aspirations of
the human being!&mdash;for that century and a half the
Anglo-Saxon public had the novels that it deserved. I do not mean
to say that generous spirits lacked amongst the ranks of
fiction-writers. That great genius, Dickens, thrashed oppressions
and shams with the resplendent fury of an Isaiah; and that
singular megalomaniac, Charles Reade, did, with <i>It Is Never
Too Late to Mend,</i> really succeed in modifying the system of
solitary confinement in English gaols. And you have had <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin.</i> But those works of propaganda had either no
literary value at all or when, as in the case of Dickens, they
did have the literary value that genius can infuse into work
however faulty, their work itself suffered by the very intensity
of their reforming passions.</p>
<p>That tendency alone has deprived the novel in Anglo-Saxondom
of almost all the artistic or even the social value that it might
have had, since it became a vehicle for preventing the
comfortable classes thinking of unpleasant subjects whilst
presenting their agreeable somnolences with the warming
possibilities of considering their neighbours' defects. It
became, that is to say, the week-day, post-prandial sermon
preached by a family divine above all anxious to avoid giving
offence to those who provided his daily bread. And gentlemanly
reformer, the British novelist consciously or unconsciously
remains to this day&mdash;in the great bulk.</p>
<p>That Dickens, on the other hand, had, any more than Bunyan,
any <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> at all should never for a
moment be thought. His was an agonized soul shuddering at the
tortures that, as a poor child, he had seen inflicted on the
sufferings of non-comfortable humanity in the horrible
days&mdash;for the under-dog!&mdash;of the last years of the
reigns of the Georges and of the early years of the reign of
Queen Victoria. All the horrors of insanitation, filth,
child-labour, imprisonment for debt, the gallows for petty theft,
the hulks and the rest he had himself witnessed or endured and at
these horrors he lashed with the mad enthusiasm of a wolf that
snaps at the insupportable whip of the trainer. His novels were
probably&mdash;at least in the beginning&mdash;relatively nothing
to him; if he could have found any other way he would have poured
out his feelings as readily in that. But, happening on the novel
and having a matchless command of English, he took the simple
course of presenting you with villains all black, heroes all
white and ringletted heroines all pink. He had to
see&mdash;though that is to reverse the colours&mdash;the world
in terms of Legrees, Uncle Toms, or Amelia Osbornes.</p>
<p>That, in effect, was the beginning of the end, the novel
becoming <i>the</i> vehicle for the reform of abuses. And it is
astonishing how short has been the career of the novel as an art
compared with that of pottery-moulding, baking, weaving, or any
other human avocation. You may say that it began with Richardson
and ended&mdash;for the time being and as far as Anglo-Saxondom
is concerned&mdash;with <i>Oliver Twist,</i> which, significantly
enough, appeared in the first year of Victoria's spacious
reign.</p>
<p>Richardson, that is to say, did have an artistic convention of
sorts, did try in some way to render life, did deal almost
exclusively in neither very moral nor very immoral personages,
but there almost all attempts at rendering life or the normal
almost came to an end. <i>The Vicar of Wakefield,</i> "noted for
purity and optimism," says my official guide to dates, was an
obviously Richardsonian <i>pastiche;</i> Henry Mackenzie's <i>Man
of Feeling</i> may be said to have exaggerated Richardson's
tearful sentimentality; and Smollett ("marked by coarseness and
brutality") whose first book was published eight years after the
publication of <i>Pamela</i> and in the same year as
<i>Clarissa,</i> undoubtedly had a shot at rendering the same
world that Richardson rendered. It is not as absurd as it may
seem to say that <i>Pamela</i> suggested <i>Roderick Random;</i>
it certainly suggested <i>Madame Bovary</i>&mdash;and
<i>Babbitt!</i></p>
<p>It would, however, undoubtedly be absurd to suggest to the
public that Smollett was a greater artist or a greater novelist
than either Fielding or Dickens: and yet, if the novel is to be
regarded as a rendering of life, there is not much way out of it.
He remains, however, and will probably always remain, an isolated
figure. He was bitter, and as he rendered what he had seen and
since what he had seen had been coarse and brutal, those will be
the epithets that Anglo-Saxondom will for ever bestow on him. He
wrote about the sea in a period glorious for England's
sea-history&mdash;but in spite of that he could hardly be
regarded&mdash;as is Marryat&mdash;as a writer for boys. The life
of which he treated was too remote from to-day for the reader
interested in the renderings of the life of to-day to read of it
with any enthusiasm; he was little less virulent than Swift and,
if he is even less read, he receives even less lip-service. So no
doubt he is contented.</p>
<p>Marryat&mdash;as a writer read by boys, men being already too
dulled in the sense at twenty to appreciate him&mdash;has
probably, through the boys, exercised the greatest influence on
the English character that any writer ever did exercise. His
magnificent gifts of drawing&mdash;not
exaggerating&mdash;character and of getting an atmosphere have so
worked that few of us have not been to sea in frigates before the
age of eighteen and come in some way in contact with
non-comfortable men and women. I have seldom been so impressed as
when, the other day, I re-read <i>Peter Simple</i> for my
pleasure. It was to come into contact with a man who could write
and see and feel. For me, nothing in <i>War and Peace</i> is as
valuable as the boat cutting-out expeditions of Marryat and for
me he remains the greatest of English novelists. His name is not
even mentioned in the manual of literary dates with which I have
just been refreshing my memory.</p>
<p>I do not, however, dwell at any length on either Smollett or
Marryat because, great as for me they seem, they still remain
individual figures leaving very little trace on the traditions of
English literature&mdash;and that indeed was the case with
Fenimore Cooper who was one of the most beautiful pure stylists
that the English language has yet excited into writing. There is
in <i>The Two Admirals</i> a passage descriptive of mists rising
from the sails and cordage of battleships as seen from the turf
of cliff-tops at dawn, that remains for me one of the
incomparable passages in the language. And, whilst I am about the
matter of pure style, I may as well explain here why lately I
mentioned that I was then writing in Lisbon harbour. That
apparently egotistic excrescence was due to the fact that I liked
to remember that&mdash;no, not Fielding&mdash;but Beckford once
lay in Lisbon harbour and wrote most beautiful prose there.
Beckford is known only as the author of <i>Vathek,</i> which is,
to be sure, most remarkable as a <i>tour de force</i>&mdash;and
which is usually bound up with <i>Rasselas</i> in popular
reprints; but he is also the author of <i>Letters from
Portugal</i> which might almost be regarded as a novel, such an
admirable autobiographical portrait do they give of their writer
in his adventurous progress from the city of Camoens and Vasco da
Gama to the monastery of Batalha.</p>
<p>Prose, I suppose, is to some extent the business of a writer
on the English Novel, so I suppose I may be pardoned my
digression about Beckford and make the note that if I wanted to
put together a small, exquisitely pleasing fascicule of admirable
because simple English prose I should take a passage from the
suppressed Preface to the Bible, a passage from Henry V's address
to his soldiers before Agincourt, one from Clarendon, one from
<i>Gulliver,</i> one from Johnson's <i>Life of Drake,</i> the
passage from Cooper that I have mentioned above, and one from the
<i>Letters from Portugal,</i> one from Maine's <i>Ancient
Law</i>&mdash;and then one from any book of W. H. Hudson. The
English language is not very distinguished for its prose, but
that would make a very admirable little volume! One might almost
add the opening description of the village from White's
<i>Selborne.</i></p>
<p>It is of course impossible to exhaust the topic of the English
novel from Fielding to Henry James in a few paragraphs of a small
book. But the topic of main currents of that literature is more
easily got rid of simply because there are practically no main
currents at all. There are some good writers, but of a Tradition
practically no trace. The writers who spring most immediately to
the imagination as being somewhere near in their works to the
main stream of the international novel&mdash;for the Novel is
after all an international affair&mdash;the most unforgettable
writers of that type are two or three women. That I suppose is
because, whilst the men ran about actively intent on proving that
they were gentlemen or in improving the ungentle world, the women
had to prove that they were not unladylike and so remained at
home and looked at life, without any very immediate aim at
publicity or even at publication.</p>
<p>At any rate, if you take Miss Burney's <i>Evelina,</i> Miss
Edgeworth's <i>Castle Rackrent,</i> Miss Austen's <i>Sense and
Sensibility,</i> Mrs. Gaskell's <i>Mary Barton,</i> George
Eliot's <i>Scenes from Clerical Life,</i> and Miss Bront&euml;'s
<i>Villette,</i> you do get something of a kinship, if not much
of a tradition, and if you add to them the <i>Barchester
Towers</i> series of Trollope and the works of Mark Rutherford
and George Gissing you do get, too, some attempts at rendering
English life that are above the attention of adults with the
mentality of French boys of sixteen. At rendering, that is to
say, rather than at the mere relating of a more or less arbitrary
tale so turned as to ensure a complacent view of life and carried
on by characters that as a rule are&mdash;six feet high and
gliding two inches above the ground!</p>
<p>That is, of course, an arbitrary generalization as to all the
English nuvvles that string out from, say, Scott to, say, the
late Marion Crawford. But if sweeping it is not <i>completely</i>
unfair. Obviously even Scott's <i>Antiquary</i> is worth
consideration if one had the time, or <i>The Cloister and the
Hearth,</i> or let us say <i>Lorna Doone.</i> That last work I
read over twelve times when I was a boy and from the beginning:
"If any man would hear a plain tale told plainly, I John Ridd of
the parish of Oare" to the end; I dare say I could recite half
the book to-day. But then Blackmore was a market-gardener! Let me
lay on his altar these alms for oblivion, for I suppose that few
people to-day read of the Doones of Badgeworthy or of how John
Ridd took his Lorna home in the great snows.</p>
<p>In short, if you omit Dickens and Thackeray as immense
amateurs who wrote from time to time very admirable passages, and
if you do not like the works&mdash;from <i>Evelina</i> to <i>New
Grub Street</i>&mdash;that I have mentioned in my last paragraph
but two, the amount of work that you can read in English produced
between 1799 and 1899 or so will seem extremely
small&mdash;supposing you to be of any at all adult tastes or of
any seriousness of approach to literary matters.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you are indifferent to whether you are
convinced by what you read and care little with what you occupy
your spare time and desire to fill up your hours with an
occupation calling for as little mental concentration as, say, a
game of golf, I dare say you could agreeably narcotize yourself
still with <i>Bob Roy</i> or <i>The Tower of London</i> or <i>The
Woman in White</i> or, say, <i>Rudder Grange.</i></p>
<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER FOUR. TO JOSEPH
CONRAD</h2>
<p>Thus in Mid-Victorian years there established itself for all
the world to see&mdash;The English Nuvvle.</p>
<p>And inasmuch as this phenomenon was really, in the last event,
combined&mdash;and no doubt unconscious&mdash;socio-political
propaganda, it was accepted by the whole world&mdash;and by the
whole world even more than by England. For if, as it were, you
shut your eyes and consider what images are brought up before you
by the words The English Novel you will see a Manor House,
inhabited by the Best People: Sir Thomas, amiable but not bright;
Lady Charlotte, benevolent, charitable, in an ample crinoline, an
Earl's daughter; the Misses Jean and Charlotte as pure as dew
within lily-chalices; Mr. Tom&mdash;not absolutely satisfactory;
Mr. Edward, always satisfactory; pigeons, shorthorns, a
rose-garden, a still-room, a house-keeper, a rectory. And you
will see a whole countryside, a whole continent, a whole world so
conducted that those amiable but not bright personages shall lead
amiable, idle, and almost blameless existences in an atmosphere
of curtsyings and cap-touchings. It was a world-ideal: you found
households modelling themselves upon it in the Government of
Kiev, in the State of Massachusetts, in Pomerania, in the
department of the Var. So that God's Englishman of the novels of
William Black&mdash;God's drooping-bearded Englishman with his
crinolined or be-bustled consort, carrying fly-fishing rods and
croquet mallets, became the type which the whole world sighingly
aped. For these nuvvlesto which nobody surely could
object&mdash;were read in Sarajevo as in Potsdam, in Washington
as on the Berkshire downs. They were works written for the
would-be gentry by the near-gentry which latter, if their books
proved sufficiently acceptable, might almost aspire to such
establishments as they described and, in the second generation,
to authentic gentrydom. The writer himself, like Shakespeare,
would as a rule have to content himself with a grant of arms from
the College of Heralds. But one could always, if one were a
novelist, dazzle one's mind with the idea that Edward Bulwer
Lytton, author of <i>The Last Day of Pompeii,</i> became
successively Sir Edward Bulwer, and Lord, Lytton, and Benjamin
Disraeli, also a novelist, Earl of Beaconsfield and favourite of
his Sovereign.</p>
<p>The nuvvles, naturally, differed in subject and even sometimes
in treatment. <i>The Woman in White</i> was, I think, written in
letters for all the world like <i>Clarissa;
Esmond</i>&mdash;which described the founding of a county-family
in Virginia, U.S.A.&mdash;was autobiographical; or you might have
several characters each speaking in solid autobiographical wads;
or several diarists. There was, in fact, no literary convention
in particular&mdash;there was only the point of view.
<i>Romola</i> and <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> had to be
recognized as of the same ethical family as <i>Pelham</i> or
<i>Lorna Doone</i> or they would not do at all.</p>
<p>Occasionally disturbing breaths swept across the trout-ponds.
The newest novel of Thackeray might cause a great deal of
trepidating discussion under the breath, or the latest passionate
outpouring of Dickens might cause Mamma to ask dear Papa whether
Lucy and Emily ought really to be allowed to read it. Steerforth
and Little Em'ly came <i>very</i> near the Knuckle: but the
lap-dog died amongst such lamentations and the first heroine so
delicately, and such refined retribution overtook alike
Steerforth and the young woman that, if <i>Copperfield</i> itself
was put on the index of the young ladies' boudoir, <i>Bleak
House</i> which "introduced Society" could not be kept from the
fair denizens of that bechintzed sanctuary. I believe, however,
that <i>Great Expectations,</i> the last of Dickens' works to
show his passionate compassion for the underdog, had a pretty
rough passage.</p>
<p>I came into the world myself at about the hey-day of this
national phenomenon, but, by the time I had any real literary
consciousness, its supremacy was beginning to be already
challenged. My own mother enjoined on me the reading of <i>Silas
Marner, The Mill on the Floss, Wuthering Heights, Sidonia the
Sorceress, Lorna Doone, The Woman in White, The Moonstone, Diana
of the Crossways,</i> and <i>Far From the Madding Crowd.</i> But
then my mother was "advanced" and never wore a crinoline. My
father thought Dickens was vulgar and though he did not forbid me
to read he certainly deprecated my expressing any enthusiasm
for&mdash;<i>Bleak House.</i> He thought too&mdash;I don't know
why&mdash;that Robert Louis Stevenson was meretricious, except
for the Inland Voyage. My grandfather, who was considerably more
"advanced" than either my father or my mother, first recommended
me to read&mdash;when I was about seventeen&mdash;<i>Madame
Bovary, Tartarin de Tarascon</i> and <i>Tartarin sur les
Alpes.</i> He was pleased when at school they gave us the
<i>Lettres de mon Moulin</i> of Daudet and a little later made me
read <i>Roderick Random, Humphry Clinker, Snarleyyow, Midshipman
Easy,</i> Waterton's <i>Wanderings in South America,</i> which
was all the same as a novel. My uncle William Rossetti gave me
<i>The Castle of Otranto, Caleb Williams, Frankenstein</i> and
another novel of Meinhold's&mdash;<i>The Amber Witch.</i> I
inherited from my uncle Oliver Madox Brown a large number of
translations from the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish.
Trollope I had to find out for myself, oddly enough. I suppose my
own family were too advanced to care to advocate the reading of
projections of the lives of the cathedral clergy. That, at any
rate, was the reading of a boy of from twelve to eighteen of
fairly advanced family in the 'eighties of last century. It will
be observed that, with the possible exception of Wilkie Collins'
two books, these were all works that would not normally be read
in Middle Class families, either because of social
outspokennesses, individuality of outlook, or difficulties of
style. But even for my family it was then possible to go too far.
I remember my mother being seriously perturbed because at the age
of thirteen or so I was kissed at a tea-party by Mrs. Lynn Lynton
whose gleaming spectacles certainly frightened me and whose
novels advocated the Revolt of the Daughters of that day-and, if
it had lain within the ideas of right and wrong of my family to
forbid anyone to read anything, I should certainly have been
forbidden to read the works of Rhoda Broughton, who advocated the
giving of latchkeys to women.</p>
<p>Nemesis was by then on the way.</p>
<p>The newer ideas began with the cheapening of the products of
the press&mdash;and I dare say that cheapening was a good deal
hastened by the pirating of American works. I remember still with
delight the shilling edition&mdash;it was bound in scarlet
paper&mdash;in which I first purchased at the age of fourteen in
a place called Malvern Wells, Artemus Ward's <i>Among the
Mormons,</i> Sam Slick's <i>The Clockmaker,</i> Mark Twain's
<i>Mississippi Pilot,</i> Carleton's <i>Farm Ballads,</i> and
ever so many other American books which I suppose must have been
pirated or they could scarcely have been sold for a shilling.
And, though I was ready at the injunctions of my family to read
Lope da Vega or Smollett, nothing would have induced me to spend
sixpence on taking out from a circulating library the
three-volume novels of William Black, Besant and Rice and the
other purveyors of the nuvvle when by saving up my pocket-money I
could buy for a shilling&mdash;or ninepence net&mdash;the
<i>Biglow Ballads</i> or <i>Hans Breitmann.</i></p>
<p>So that of the novel of commerce of those days I really know
very little&mdash;and I do not think that there is very much
about it that anyone need know. That it existed in great numbers
in three volumes apiece was obvious. In every little town in
England there was in those days a circulating library and in
every circulating library in every town were shelves on shelves
of obfusc bindings&mdash;but even the literary textbooks of
to-day give you no more names for the Victorian period than
Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, the Bront&euml;s, Charles
Kingsley, Robert Louis Stevenson (who died in 1894), George
Meredith and Thomas Hardy. So that even the official list is a
pretty meagre one and if I rack my brains really hard I cannot
add many names to it. I have already given you Black, Blackmore,
Besant and Rice who collaborated&mdash;and of writers of
considerable merit, Mark Rutherford and Samuel Butler, but
neither of these really belong to the period&mdash;and Jane
Austen really precedes it, though we may well say that she
originated the novel of the country-house that was
followed&mdash;at such great intervals&mdash;by the swarm of
commercial writers.</p>
<p>That all the commercial writers who solidly turned out solid
three-deckers produced absolute rubbish need not be assumed. Miss
Braddon, authoress of <i>Lady Audley's Secret,</i> did honest,
sound journeyman's work, year in, year out, during a very long
life&mdash;and obviously such a writer as Mrs. Gaskell will not
ever be entirely forgotten, if only on account of
<i>Cranford.</i> I wish, myself, that more weight attached to her
<i>Mary Barton,</i> a grim-and indeed an extraordinarily
painful&mdash;account of Mid-Victorian labour troubles.</p>
<p>And of course there is Trollope.</p>
<p>Trollope and Miss Austen&mdash;like Shakespeare and
Richardson&mdash;stand so absolutely alone that nothing very
profitable can be said about them by a writer analysing British
fiction in search of traces of main-currents of tradition. They
were both so aloof, so engrossed, so contemplative&mdash;and so
masterly&mdash;that beyond saying that some people prefer <i>The
Warden</i> to <i>Framley Parsonage</i> and <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i> to <i>Pride and Prejudice,</i> and that others
think the reverse, there is very little to be said. These at
least are authentic writers: they neither flare out into passages
that are all super-genius&mdash;as in Dickens' passage about the
dry leaves at Mr. Peck-sniff's back-door, nor do they descend to
the intolerable banalities of the endings of<i>Copperfield</i> or
<i>Vanity Fair.</i> But, as in the case of Turgenev, the aspiring
writer can learn very little of either. These novelists write
well, know how to construct a novel so as to keep the interest
going with every word until the last page&mdash;but after that
all you can say is that they were just temperaments, and quiet
ones at that. Inimitable&mdash;that is what they are. You could
imitate Oscar Wilde&mdash;but never Trollope giving you the
still, slow stream of English country and small-town life. Nor
could anyone else ever give you such pure agony of interest and
engrossment as you can get out of the financial troubles over a
few pounds of the poor clergyman in <i>Framley Parsonage.</i> I
shiver every time that I think of that book.</p>
<p>But once those tributes are paid it is astonishing to look
back on the course of the novel in England from the earliest
times to say,1895, Bunyan, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett,
and then the few Victorians of whom we have been treating. It is
an astonishingly small crop, even if you let me add Marryat and
add for yourselves the other solitary figure of Mark Twain, one
of the greatest prose-writers the English language has
produced.</p>
<p>In the meantime, across the Channel, the main stream of the
Novel pursued its slow course.</p>
<p>It had begun with Richardson. His vogue with the French would
be incomprehensible if we were not able to consider that the
French Revolution was, in the end, a sentimental movement, basing
itself on civic, parental, filial, and rhetorical virtues. If the
French beheaded Marie Antoinette it was in order that Monsieur
Durand, stay-maker of the Passage Choiseul, might be sufficiently
well-fed to utter tearful homilies to his children; for homilies
uttered by starving peasants with their bones pushing through
their skins and rags&mdash;such homilies would little impress
their children with the solid advantages of virtuous careers. And
the moment you consider pre-revolutionary France from that angle
the appeal of the author of <i>Pamela</i> becomes instantly
blindingly clear.</p>
<p>At any rate, Diderot wrote <i>Rameau's Nephew</i> as a direct
imitation of that work of Richardson and a whole school of the
contemporaries of Diderot imitated <i>Rameau's Nephew.</i> The
influence, again, of Richardson is plainly visible in
Chateaubriand&mdash;for without Richardson how could he have
written long passages like: "How sad it is to think that eyes
that are too old to see have not yet outlived the ability to shed
tears," and the like. And if the Richardsonian influence upon
Stendhal does not so immediately spring to the eye, we know from
Stendhal's letters that it was extremely profound.</p>
<p>It was to Diderot&mdash;and still more to Stendhal&mdash;that
the Novel owes its next great step forward. That consisted in the
discovery that words put into the mouth of a character need not
be considered as having the personal backing of the author. At
that point it became suddenly evident that the Novel as such was
capable of being regarded as a means of profoundly serious and
many-sided discussion and therefore a medium of profoundly
serious investigation into the human case. It came into its
own.</p>
<p>It is obvious of course that before the day of Diderot authors
had put into the mouths of their characters sentiments with which
they themselves could not be imagined to sympathize. But that was
done only by characters marked "villain," all the sympathetic
characters having to utter sentiments which were either those of
the author or those with which the author imagined the solid
middle classes would agree. Young Mr. Blifil, Mrs. Slipslop, and
the rest might say very wicked things, but they were so obviously
wicked and absurd that no one could take them with any
seriousness either as pronouncements or as worthy to be taken as
the author's opinion: Mr. Allworthy or Amelia Dobbin, on the
other hand, could never utter anything without the reader having
to exclaim: <i>"How</i> virtuous!"...And consider the material
success that always awaited the good!</p>
<p>By the time the thirty years or so that stretched between 1790
and 1820 had impinged on the world it had gradually become
evident, on the Continent at least, that so many differing codes
of morality could synchronize in the same era, in the same nation
and even in the same small community&mdash;it had become so
evident that if Simeon Stylites and Oliver Cromwell were saints,
Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha and several Chinese philosophers
were very good men, that the Novel, if it was at all to express
its day, must express itself through figures less amateurishly
blacked than Uriah Heep and less sedulously whited than the
Cherryble brothers.</p>
<p>Changes in literary methods are brought about very slowly and
permeate more slowly still into the taste of the more or less
unlettered classes who make up the bulk of the desirable readers
for an author. As a rule the process begins with the younger
writers who find tiresome or ludicrous the accepted work of their
day; a little later the more experienced of readers, tiring in
their turn of accepted methods in the works they consume, turn
with relief to the younger writers, the professorial and
established critics still thundering violently against the
younger schools. For, everywhere but in England, schools
establish themselves as soon as restlessnesses betray themselves
in artistic circles. The more experienced readers, in spite of
the critics, spreading abroad amongst the larger classes of the
relatively unlettered the taste for the newer modes, at first
that larger class become converts and then the professional
critics whose bread and butter depends on their following the
public taste. So a school is established and for a time holds its
own. Then it gives place to other modes.</p>
<p>That is the quite invariable process with all the products and
all the methods, of all the arts. But naturally, as the arts grow
older, their practitioners have a better chance of evolving newer
and sounder methods, for the number of their predecessors has
inevitably increased. Bunyan must evolve his method for himself;
Defoe could study Bunyan; Richardson, Bunyan and Defoe; Diderot,
Richardson and his predecessors; Stendhal could draw on the
experience of four generations; Flaubert on that of five; Conrad
on that of six. This of course is a source of danger to weaker
brethren, for in each generation an enormous amount of insipid
art is turned out by inferior students receiving their
instruction at the hands of academic instructors. That cannot be
helped. But the fact remains that to a real master possessed of a
real individuality the study of the methods of his predecessors
must be of enormous use. Anyone at all instructed, reading the
work of Conrad, must find evidence of an almost lifelong and
almost incredibly minute study of writers preceding him and the
amount of reading and of study&mdash;for they are not the same
thing&mdash;that must have gone to the making of the author of
<i>Ulysses,</i> who is certainly the greatest of all prose
virtuosi of the word&mdash;that beggars the imagination!</p>
<p>So it happened that in France from, say, the 'fifties to the
early 'nineties of the last century, you had a place of dignity
found for the hitherto despised Novel&mdash;and in consequence
you very speedily found an accepted convention. For once an
occupation is discovered to be dignified you will very soon find
that investigators of methods are at work upon it. The game of
marbles was, in my hey-day, regarded as an occupation solely for
little boys; but with the institution some few years ago of an
international championship it came in for the most serious of
study by grown men, and the photographs of last year's
world-contest that a little time ago filled the public prints,
showed the competitors to be white-headed, grey-bearded, or very
rotund of figure. The champion was eventually found, as far as I
can remember, in a gentleman of sixty and over.</p>
<p>So with <i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i> it became evident to the
world that the novel of discussion or of investigation was a
possibility and, with that discovery, the great novels began to
come. The discussions to be found in the very few works of
fiction by Diderot were naturally experimental and amateurish.
Like Richardson he was tremendously on the side of the more or
less patriarchal and civic angels. Nevertheless, he could give
you a parasite talking in favour of his profession or a rogue
justifying his courses with a sincerity and a reasonable
ingenuousness that differed extremely from the exaggerated
speeches of the villains of the Fielding, the Dickens, or the
commercial, nuvvle. Stendhal, on the other hand, being what one
might call a cold Nietzschean&mdash;or it might be more just to
say that Nietzsche was a warmed-up Stendhalean&mdash;Stendhal,
then, swung the balance rather to the other extreme, tending to
make his detrimentals argumentatively masterly and his
conventionally virtuous characters banal and impotent.</p>
<p>At any rate, with or after Stendhal, it became evident that,
if the novel was to have what is called <i>vraisemblance,</i> if
it was so to render life as to engross its reader, the novelist
must not take sides either with the virtuous whose virtues cause
them to prosper or with the vicious whose very virtues drive them
always nearer and nearer to the gallows or the pauper's grave.
That does not say that the author need abstain from letting his
conventionally virtuous characters prosper to any thinkable
extent. For however scientifically the matter be considered,
material if not intellectual honesty, sobriety, continence,
frugality, parsimony, and the other material virtues will give
any man a better chance of fourteen thousand&mdash;pounds or
dollars&mdash;a year than if he should be, however intellectually
honest, financially unsound, or a drunkard or a dreamer or one
who never talks about the baths he takes. The publisher, in fact,
has a better chance of both terrestrial and skyey mansions than
the novelist.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the novelist must not, by taking sides, exhibit
his preferences. He must not show his publisher as all shining
benevolence and well-soaped chastity without pointing out that
his fellows, the unwashed, incontinent, wastrel Villons of the
world, sometimes practise Robin Hoodish generosities and
sometimes smooth with their works the pillows of the agonized and
sleepless. And in between the starving Chatterton and the august
house of, say, Longmans, Norton, Hurst, Rees, and Co.&mdash;who
did not publish Chatterton&mdash;he must place and set in motion
the teeming world of averagely sensual, averagely kindly,
averagely cruel, averagely honest, averagely imbecile human
beings whose providentially appointed mission would seem to be to
turn into the stuff that fills graveyards. So that it is not so
much the function of the novelist to hold the balance straight
as, dispensing with all scales or instruments for measuring, to
show all the human beings of his creation going about their
avocations. He has, that is to say, to render and not to tell.
(If I say, "The wicked Mr. Blank shot nice Blanche's dear cat!"
that is telling. If I say: "Blank raised his rifle and aimed it
at the quivering, black-burdened topmost bough of the
cherry-tree. After the report a spattered bunch of scarlet and
black quiverings dropped from branch to branch to pancake itself
on the orchard grass!" that is rather bad rendering, but still
rendering. Or if I say Monsieur Chose was a vulgar, coarse, obese
and presumptuous fellow&mdash;that is telling. But if I say, "He
was a gentleman with red whiskers that always preceded him
through a doorway," there you have him rendered&mdash;as
Maupassant rendered him.)</p>
<p>It was Flaubert who most shiningly preached the doctrine of
the novelist as Creator who should have a Creator's aloofness,
rendering the world as he sees it, uttering no comments,
falsifying no issues and carrying the subject&mdash;the
Affair&mdash;he has selected for rendering, remorselessly out to
its logical conclusion.</p>
<p>There came thus into existence the novel of Aloofness. It had
even in France something of a struggle for that existence and the
author of <i>Madame Bovary</i> which was the first great novel
logically&mdash;and indeed passionately&mdash;to carry out this
theory, had to face a criminal prosecution because in the opinion
of the Government of Napoleon III a book that is not actively on
the side of constituted authority and of established morality is
of necessity dangerous to morals and subversive of good
government.</p>
<p>That view&mdash;it is still largely entertained by the
academic critics of Anglo-Saxondom&mdash;is of course imbecile,
but it is not without a certain basis in the sentiments of common
humanity. It is normal for poor, badgered men to desire to read
of a sort of representative type who, as hero of a book, shall
triumph over all obstacles with surprising ease and as if with
the backing of a deity. In that way they can dream of easy ends
for themselves. So they will dislike authors who do not side with
their own types. And as constituted governments and academic
bodies are made up of what the French call <i>hommes moyen
sensuels,</i> such corporations will do what they can to prevent
novelists from not taking sides with agreeable characters.</p>
<p>To the theory of Aloofness added itself, by a very natural
process, the other theory that the story of a novel should be the
history of an Affair and not a tale in which a central character
with an attendant female should be followed through a certain
space of time until the book comes to a happy end on a note of
matrimony or to an unhappy end&mdash;represented by a death. That
latter&mdash;the normal practice of the earlier novelist and
still the normal expedient of the novel of commerce or of
escape&mdash;is again imbecile, but again designed to satisfy a
very natural human desire for finality. We have a natural desire
to be kidded into thinking that for nice agreeable persons like
ourselves life will finally bring us to a stage where an
admirably planned villa, a sempiternally charming&mdash;and yet
changing&mdash;companion, and a sufficiency of bathrooms,
automobiles, gramophones radios, and grand pianos to establish us
well in the forefront of the class to which we hope to belong,
shall witness the long, uneventful, fortunate and effortless
closing years of out lives. And our desire to be kidded into that
belief is all the stronger in that whenever we do examine with
any minuteness into the lives of our fellow human beings
practically nothing of the sort ever happens to them. So we say:
"Life is too sad for us to want to read books that remind us of
it!"</p>
<p>But that is the justification for the novel of Aloofness,
rendering not the arbitrary felicities of a central character but
the singular normalities of an Affair. Normal humanity, deprived
of the possibility of viewing either lives or life, makes
naturally for a pessimism that demands relief either in the drugs
of the happy endings of falsified fictions or in the anodynes of
superstition&mdash;one habit being as fatal to the human
intelligence as the other. But there is no need to entertain the
belief that life is sad any more than there is any benefit to be
derived from the contemplation of fictitious and banal joys. The
French peasant long ago evolved the rule that life is never
either as good or as bad as one expects it to be and so the
French peasant, like every proper man, faces life with
composure&mdash;and reads <i>Madame Bovary,</i> whilst the
English, say, lawyer has never got beyond <i>The Three
Musketeers.</i></p>
<p>The progress from the one to the other is simple and logical
enough. If you no longer allow yourself to take sides with your
characters you begin very soon to see that such a thing as a hero
does not exist&mdash;a discovery that even Thackeray could make.
And, from there to seeing that it is not individuals but
enterprises or groups that succeed or fail is a very small step
to take. And then immediately there suggests itself the other
fact that it is not the mere death and still less the mere
marriage of an individual that brings to an end either a group or
an enterprise. It is perhaps going too far to say that <i>no</i>
man is indispensable, but it is far more usual to find that, when
a seemingly indispensable individual disappears for one reason or
another from an enterprise, that adventure proceeds with
equanimity and very little shock. I suppose the most co-operative
and at the same time the most one-man concern of to-day is the
newspaper or the periodical publication, and I suppose that in my
time I must have been acquainted with something at least of the
affairs of at least a hundred journals or periodicals each of
them of necessity more or less autocratically conducted, simply
because a journal running along and having to appear on a stated
day, it is hardly ever practicable to get together an editorial
committee soon enough to make momentous decisions that may have
to be arrived at in a minute or two. Yet almost the first
discovery that the most strong-minded of editors makes after he
has got the periodical of his founding running for a month or two
is that it is the periodical that has taken charge&mdash;and the
most notable fact of journalism is that even when the most noted
of editors suddenly dies his paper in the immense majority of
cases goes on running in perfect tranquillity and with no
apparent change for a period sufficiently long to make it
perfectly manifest that the great man was not in the least
indispensable.</p>
<p>And, as with newspapers, so with nearly all the other
enterprises of life. I am not of course saying that no great man
exists or no founder of great enterprises, though I should
imagine that there must be even more mute inglorious Miltons than
ever got a chance of putting their epics before the public.
Still, the evolver of a new process or a revived combination does
exist and not infrequently does get his chance: and there is no
particular reason why the serious novelist should not select the
Affair of a successful individual for treatment. That he seldom
does so is usually because, having studied the cases of
successful men, he is apt to come to the conclusion that they are
not unseldom neither edifying as histories nor psychologically
very interesting. Alexander, that is to say, may have sighed for
new worlds to conquer, but it is probable that he would have
bartered several of his empires for the certainty of a little
peace at his own fireside and an improved digestion.</p>
<p>Flaubert, then, gave us <i>Madame Bovary,</i> which may be
described as the first great novel that aimed at aloofness. That
it did not succeed in its aim, Flaubert being in the end so
fascinated by his Emma that beside her and the ingenuous weakness
of her genuine romanticism every other character in the book is
either hypocritical, mean or meanly imbecile&mdash;that it did
not succeed in that aim is not to be wondered at when we consider
the great, buoyant, and essentially optimist figure that he was.
And indeed, all authors being men, it is very unlikely that the
completely aloof novel will ever see the light. If you want to be
a novelist you must first be a poet and it is impossible to be a
poet and lack human sympathies or generosity of outlook. In
<i>Education Sentimentale</i>&mdash;which, if I had to decide the
matter, though fortunately I don't, I should call the greatest
novel ever written&mdash;the author of <i>Madame Bovary</i> gave
us a nearly perfect group novel, written from a standpoint of
very nearly complete aloofness. In <i>Bouvard et
P&eacute;cuchet,</i> abandoning as it were human measures of
success and failure, he takes as his hero the imbecility of
co-operative mankind and as his heroine the futility of the
accepted idea, and, being thus as it were detached from the earth
and its standards, he could draw in Bouvard and his mate, two of
the most lovable of human beings that ever set out upon a forlorn
hope. He died in the attempt.</p>
<p>The Flaubert school or group lasted sufficiently long in
France, though, after the late War, its influence was completely
washed out by a sort of eclecticism whose main features it is
very difficult to trace and into whose ramifications I do not
intend to enter, for it has had practically no time to influence
the work of Anglo-Saxon novel writers. Flaubert, Maupassant,
Turgenev, the Gourmonts, Daudet, and the rest of those who had
their places at Br&eacute;bant's died in their allotted years,
the last survivor of any prominence being Anatole France, whose
death was greeted by an outburst of furious hatred in France such
as can seldom have greeted the passing of a distinguished figure.
That was because the French young, saddened and rendered starving
by the War which just preceded France's death, turned with
loathing from the rather <i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i> aloofness of
the author of <i>Histoire Comique.</i> And indeed if we
Anglo-Saxons had suffered in the least as much as those Latins I
might well expect to find myself lynched for writing what I have
done above. I have seldom witnessed anything to equal the dismay
of a great French gathering of <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> when
their honoured guest, an English novelist of distinction and
indeed of internationally public literary functions, told them in
quite immaculate French that all he knew of writing he had from
France, and that all that he had from France he had learned from
the works of Guy de Maupassant! If he had gone round that great
assembly and had, with his glove, flicked each one of the guests
in the face, he could not have caused greater consternation.
Nevertheless it is true that Maupassant must have had more
influence on the Anglo-Saxon writer of to-day than any other
writer of fiction, Henry James possibly excepted.</p>
<p>In England, meantime, slightly before the 1890's, the solid
vogue of&mdash;or the somnolent rumination over&mdash;the
three-volumed nuvvle of commerce had been seriously threatened by
the slow spread of the idea that writing might be an art, by a
tremendous drop in the prices at which books might be sold and by
revolutionary attacks on Victorian conventional morality. The
loosening in morality need not concern us except in so far as it
shook the idea that the novelist must of necessity colour all his
characters with one or other hue, but the drop in the price of
books facilitated at least all sorts of experimental adventures.
Whilst the nuvvle remained a thirty-shilling three-decker
publishers must needs play for safety whether in morals or
methods and neither, say, the <i>Hill-top</i> novels of Grant
Allen, which were pseudo-scientific attacks on conventional
morality, nor yet <i>Almayer's Folly,</i> which was an attempt to
introduce the artistic standards and methods of Flaubert into
Anglo-Saxondom, could have had even the remotest chance of
publication had the novel remained at its former price.</p>
<p>On the other hand, such writers as Wilde, Stevenson, Pater,
and Meredith did, dealing mostly in verbal felicities or
infelicities, begin rather vaguely to perceive that writing was
an art. Neither Wilde nor Pater were novelists in the sense of
devoting the greater part of their time or energies to the art of
fiction, and Stevenson remained an avowed moralist, whilst
Meredith devoted himself to large national
aspirations&mdash;which have nothing to do with art. And all the
four, as I have said, were essentially rather stylists <i>tels
quels</i> than anything else. When Pater, Wilde, or Meredith had
succeeded in a passage in showing what clever fellows they were
they were satisfied and Stevenson, if he had some conception of
how to tell a story, was far more gratified if he had succeeded
in producing a quaint sentence with turns of phrase after the
manner of Sir Thomas Browne than intent on the fact that every
sentence&mdash;nay, every word!&mdash;should carry on the effect
of the story to be told.</p>
<p>But the mere fact that writers were then beginning to pay some
attention to manner rather than to matter or morals&mdash;that
they were intent on being writers rather than
gentlemen&mdash;that mere fact is one to excite lively gratitude
in lands like ours and the job of being a novelist is one of such
excruciating difficulty that it would be ungrateful to ask of
pioneers that they should be more than pioneers.</p>
<p>The effect of their propaganda almost more than of their
achievements, combined with the cheapening of books and the
impingement on Anglo-Saxon shores of French examples of how
things should be done&mdash;for it was not until the late
'eighties that Flaubert, Maupassant, and Turgenev really produced
any overwhelming effect in either England or the United
States&mdash;the effect then of all these factors coming almost
together was an outburst of technical effort such as can have
rarely been witnessed in any other race or time. The idea that
writing was an art and as such had its dignity, that it had
methods to be studied and was therefore such another acknowledged
craft as is shoe-making&mdash;such ideas acted for a time, in the
days of the <i>Yellow Book,</i> like magic on a whole horde of
English&mdash;and still more of American&mdash;writers.</p>
<p>I have of course not here the space to go with any minuteness
into the history of the <i>Yellow Book</i> period. Founded by two
Americans&mdash;Henry James and Henry Harland&mdash;in London
where circumstances were certainly more favourable than they
would have been in, say, New York or Boston, the <i>Yellow
Book</i> did undoubtedly promote an interest in technical matters
that hardly any other periodical or Movement could have done.
James was a direct pupil of Turgenev; Harland and most of the
contributors to the periodical were products rather of a general
"Frenchness" than the students of any one author&mdash;the
products of a blend of Mallarm&eacute;, M&eacute;rim&eacute;e,
Murger, and Maupassant and a Quartier Latin frame of mind and
personal untidiness.</p>
<p>Its defect as a movement was that its supporters, also,
probably aimed rather at displaying personal cleverness than at
the concealment of themselves beneath the surfaces of their
works. They had not yet learnt the sternest of all
lessons&mdash;that the story is the thing, and the story and then
the story, and that there is nothing else that matters in the
world.</p>
<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a><i>L'ENVOI</i></h2>
<h3>IN THE LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY</h3>
<p>When the dust of the <i>Yellow Book</i> period died away with
the trial and disappearance of Wilde there did nevertheless
remain in the public and the literary mind some conception that
novel-writing was an art and that the novel was a vehicle by
means of which every kind of psychological or scientific truth
connected with human life and affairs could be very fittingly
conveyed. Today I imagine that there would not be many found to
deny that it is the vehicle by means of which those truths can be
most fittingly investigated. To that we may some day return.</p>
<p>In the meantime the <i>Yellow Book</i> period also left behind
it three men whose names must for ever stand out for the student
of the history of the English Novel&mdash;they were Henry James,
Stephen Crane, and Joseph Conrad. I do not purpose here to
attempt an estimate of any one of the three; I merely wish to
point out what it was that distinguished them from all of their
predecessors and nearly all of their distinguished
contemporaries. Their distinguished contemporaries are all, most
fortunately, still alive and so beyond the reach of my
pen&mdash;but it must, I imagine, he fairly obvious that, say,
Mr. Wells, Mr. Kipling, Mr. Galsworthy, or Mr. Arnold Bennett are
each solitary figures, ploughing lonely furrows and expressing
their admirable selves in admirable ways known only to
themselves.</p>
<p>About that other triad there was a certain solidarity, a
certain oneness of method and even a certain comradeship. They
lived in the same corner of England, saw each other often and
discussed literary methods more thoroughly and more frequently
than can ever at any other time in England have been the case. To
be sure, not one of the three was English.</p>
<p>Indeed, some ten years or so ago my friend Mr. Wells wrote to
the papers to say that in the first decade of this century a
group of foreigners occupied that corner of England and were
engaged in plotting against the English novel. At the time that
appeared to be the sort of patriotic nonsense that occupied our
minds a good deal just after the War&mdash;but Mr. Wells, as
usual, was right. The extent of the conspiracy was this: the
works of those three writers whose influence on the
Anglo-Saxon-and even to some extent on the British&mdash;novel
was overwhelming&mdash;were united by a common technique and
their literary aims were to all intents exactly the same.</p>
<p>All three treated their characters with aloofness; all three
kept themselves, their comments and their prejudices out of their
works, and all three rendered rather than told. On the whole
those characteristics which never before characterized the
English novel characterize it to-day. No one, that is, would
to-day set out to capture the suffrages of either the more
instructed or of even the almost altogether na&iuml;f with a
novel of the type of those written by the followers of Bunyan,
Defoe, Fielding, Charles Reade, or William Black. No author
would, like Thackeray, to-day intrude his broken nose and myopic
spectacles into the middle of the most thrilling scene he ever
wrote, in order to tell you that, though his heroine was rather a
wrong 'un, his own heart was in his right place.</p>
<p>James, Conrad, and Crane differed from each other in minute
points and indeed in broader characteristics. James was more
introspective, Crane more incisive in his writing, Conrad more
nearly approached the ordinary definition of the poet and was
less remorselessly aloof than either of the others. But their
common, Gallic origin united them, so that they had before all
for their strongest passion the desire to convey vicarious
experience to the reader. Conrad wrote of his literary aim: "It
is above all to make you see," and Crane might have written the
same thing had he ever written about himself. And Henry James
might have written if he could ever have brought himself to write
anything so unqualified about his aims: "It is above all to make
you feel!" At any rate, the common aim was to take the reader,
immerse him in an Affair so completely that he was unconscious
either of the fact that he was reading or of the identity of the
author, so that in the end he might say&mdash;and believe: "I
have been in a drawing-room overlooking Boston Common, in a
drinking saloon in Yellow Sky or beneath the palm leaves of
Palembang! I <i>have</i> been!"</p>
<p>At this aim, to which they certainly attained, they arrived by
certain technical devices or rules. Most of these I have already
foreshadowed and as I am not here writing a technical work, I do
not propose to go into the others at all closely. The only sound
technical rules are those that are founded on a study of what
pleases: if what you write is to please you must see how your
predecessors did it. There can be nothing either highbrow or
recondite about your efforts; the nearer you are to your
fellowman who differs from you only in not having literary
ambitions or gifts, the nearer you are to universality; the
nearer you are to universality the greater you are, the more
nearly you will have justified your existence.</p>
<p>You must therefore write as simply as you can&mdash;with the
extreme of the simplicity that is granted to you, and you must
write of subjects that spring at your throat. But why subjects
appeal to you you have no means of knowing. The appeal of the
subject is nevertheless the only thing that is open to your
native genius&mdash;the only thing as to which you can say: "I
cannot help it: that is what appealed to me!" You must never,
after that, say: "I write like this because I want to," but you
must say: "I write like this because I hope it is what the
unspoiled reader likes!"</p>
<p>Having got your subject you will, if you are prudent, live
with it for a long, long time before you sit down to write it.
During that time you will be doing at odd moments what Conrad
used to call "squeezing the guts out of it." For it is a mistake
to think that what looks like the rendering of an ordinary affair
is ever an artless chronicling. Your "subject" may be just the
merest nothing in the way of intrigue or plot&mdash;but to the
merest nothings in human affairs all the intrigues of the
universe have contributed since first this earth-swung away, a
drop of molten metal, from the first of all principles. Your
"subject" might be no more than a child catching frogs in a swamp
or the emotions of a nervous woman in a thunderstorm, but all the
history of the world has gone to putting child or woman where
they are and up to either subject you might lead with an epic as
thrilling in its end as that of <i>Othello</i> or an episode as
poignant with absolute relief as came to the world on the
eleventh of November, 1918. You have at your disposal heredity,
environment, the concatenation of the effects of the one damn
thing after another that life is&mdash;and Destiny who is blind
and august. Those are the colours of your palette: it is for you
to see that line by line and filament of colour by filament, the
reader's eye is conducted to your culminating point.</p>
<p>That is, then, all that I have to say of the gradual progress
of the English novel&mdash;to the point where it becomes the
Novel. I have traced out as plainly as I could the lines of the
pattern as it appears to me and the reader must use that pattern
for what jumpings off of his own he chooses to make.</p>
<p>That this is not the final stage of the Novel is obvious;
there will be developments that we cannot foresee, strain our
visions how we may. There are probably&mdash;humanity being
stable, change the world how it may&mdash;there are probably
eternal principles for all the arts, but the applications of
those principles are eternally changing, or eternally revolving.
It is, for instance, an obvious and unchanging fact that if an
author intrudes his comments into the middle of his story he will
endanger the illusion conveyed by that story&mdash;but a
generation of readers may come along who would prefer witnessing
the capers of the author to being carried away by stories and
that generation of readers may coincide with a generation of
writers tired of self-obliteration. So you might have a world of
Oscar Wildes or of Lylys. Or you might, again, have a world tired
of the really well constructed novel every word of which carries
its story forward: then you will have a movement towards
diffuseness, backboneless sentences, digressions, and
inchoatenesses.</p>
<p>But, for the moment, the outline that I have traced for you
seems to have got about as far as we ourselves have.</p>
