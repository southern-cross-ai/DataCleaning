  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">This collection of nineteen stories was published without
  Oppenheim's authorisation. When he read the announcement of the new book in
  <i>The Athenaeum</i>, he wrote the following letter to the Editor:</p><br>

  <div style="margin-left:2%; margin-right 30%">
    <p class="note">"Sheringham, Norfolk, July 20, 1912.</p>

    <p class="note">"I am astonished to find that in your issue of July 20th
    Messrs. Ward, Lock &amp; Co. announce, under the heading of '<i>New</i>
    Six-Shilling Fiction,' a volume entitled 'Those Other Days,' of which I am
    the author.</p>

    <p class="note">"The volume in question consists of a considerable number
    of short stories, written by me some fifteen or twenty years ago for
    various newspapers and weekly periodicals.</p>

    <p class="note">"They are published now without my consent, knowledge, or
    benefit; and while the publishers, having acquired the copyright of these
    most ephemeral productions, are no doubt within their right in issuing
    them, I protest most strongly against their being alluded to under the
    heading of 'New Fiction.'</p>

    <p class="note">"I trust that you will give this statement of facts the
    same prominence as the misleading announcement referred to.</p>

    <p class="note">"<span class="smcap">E. Phillips Oppenenheim</span>."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>1.&mdash;THOSE OTHER DAYS</h2>

  <p class="first">Only a few days ago, whilst turning over a musty collection
  of aged volumes, I came across an old philosophical treatise&mdash;a
  translation from the German&mdash;and as I carefully turned over its pages,
  preparatory to throwing it aside, I stumbled across an idea which struck me
  forcibly. The writer, for the purpose of following out some argument, was
  ignoring the possibility of any future state, and was emphasizing the idea
  that in a human life happiness and unhappiness are far more equally balanced
  than the cursory observer would credit or imagine. If a man was afflicted
  with great trials, he was either gifted with great religious faith or
  fortitude of disposition sufficient to annihilate them, or they were followed
  or preceded by a period of corresponding happiness. Desires and
  dispositions were most often in accord with the local surroundings of the
  person, and that altogether the principles of happiness were founded upon a
  retributory basis, evil and good, happiness and unhappiness, existing in
  proportionate quantities, and giving place to each other at regular
  intervals.</p>

  <p>As I close the volume, I half unconsciously applied this idea to my own
  life, and I saw at once how close was the correspondence. For I who write
  this tale am now one of the happiest men on earth, whereas not many years ago
  I was assuredly one of the most miserable. Is it not a feasible idea that the
  calm happiness which now fills my life has come to me as compensation for a
  period of utter and intense misery; so intense that, even now, after many
  peaceful years have passed away, I can scarcely look back upon those other
  days without a shuddering remembrance of their hideous wretchedness?</p>

  <p>This is the story of my great unhappiness. I had left college but two
  years, and had flung myself into my profession with all the energy and
  devotion which youth and love of my following could inspire. I was an artist,
  member of a profession which above all others can fan the impetuous zeal of
  youth into the blazing fire of ambition, such dazzling prizes it offers, so
  easy appears to the sanguine temperament of youth their acquisition. As I
  bent over the easel in my tiny studio, its narrow precincts would oftentimes
  expand before me, the brush would fall from my hands neglected to the floor,
  and I would pace the room with flashing eyes and swelling heart, without a
  glance at my deserted work, full of bright visions and daring hopes, which
  soon became to me precious food for my imagination, fondly cherished and
  jealously kept to myself, while day after day I worked with unremitting toil
  at the masterpiece which was to be the stepping-stone to my fortunes.</p>

  <p>I was well-nigh alone in the world, for I was an orphan. My father died
  when I was still quite young, and him I cannot clearly remember; but my
  mother lived until I was eleven years old, and faint memories of her I can
  and do often recall. She had many trials, poor woman, but never once do I
  remember seeing a frown on her face or hearing an angry word from her lips.
  She bore all her troubles with a fortitude and cheerful resignation rare
  indeed in women, and which still command my wondering admiration whenever I
  reflect upon them.</p>

  <p>Ours was an unhappy childhood. My father, though of good family, and, I
  believe, of high attainments, was not a successful man, and at the age of
  forty, when he died, was only the vicar of a small country village, out of
  the living of which&mdash;barely three hundred a year&mdash;he had not been
  able to save a single penny. Disappointment and poverty had soured his once
  sweet temper, and the latter years of his life were years of discomfort and
  unhappiness to us all, particularly to his long-suffering wife, who had to
  bear, and did bear, without a murmur the exacting whims and fretful
  disposition of a disappointed and, I fear, selfish man.</p>

  <p>With his death ceased our only regular income, and henceforth life became
  a perpetual struggle to my poor mother, who nevertheless&mdash;partly by her
  own efforts and partly by the aid of her brother-in-law, our only surviving
  relation&mdash;managed to bring us up in respectability and even in comfort;
  so much so, indeed, that the dim memories which I still have of this period
  of my childhood are far from unhappy ones. I had only one sister, a year
  younger than myself, and when&mdash;worn out with her struggles, but peaceful
  and cheerful to the end&mdash;my mother died, we felt what it was to be alone
  in the world.</p>

  <p>My uncle, with whom we went to live, was a student, and almost a hermit,
  and took but little notice of us children, who grew up under the care of a
  nurse with better results than might have been expected, for she was a
  conscientious and good woman. Then one day our increasing heights seemed to
  remind him of the necessity of some change in our mode of living, and all
  that evening, contrary to his custom and greatly to our discomfort, he
  remained with us in the sitting-room, silent and absorbed as usual. Just as
  our bed-time was approaching an idea occurred to him, and he started up from
  his easy chair, from the depths of which he had been silently contemplating
  us for the last hour and half, to our infinite wonder and embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Children, it is time you went to school," he declared solemnly. "I wonder
  I never thought of it before;" and the knotty problem solved, he retired to
  his study to resume his accustomed labours, leaving us to discuss eagerly
  this coming change in our lives.</p>

  <p>We went to school&mdash;Lizzie to London, I to a public school of no
  secondary standing. I have nothing particular to say about those days. I did
  not distinguish myself particularly either in the class-room or the
  cricket-field, and the only study which really interested me was drawing, the
  rudiments of which I rapidly acquired. When I had reached the age of
  eighteen, I received the following characteristic letter from my
  uncle:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"ELMHURST, October 22.<br>
  <br>
  "MY DEAR VERNON&mdash;I see by the family Bible that you are now eighteen
  years old, and it occurs to me that you are of an age to form some definite
  idea as to your future. I reproach myself that I have not seen more of you,
  especially at the present time, for I begin to feel my strength leaving me,
  and though I have been for a long while ailing, the doctor's as well as my
  own reason tells me that the end is at hand. The little property I have is
  left to you, and out of it you will have to provide for your sister&mdash;at
  any rate, until she marries. It is not much I have to leave you, barely three
  hundred a year; but you will be able to live on it, and that you may do so
  profitably is my sincere wish. It is time for you now to leave school, and I
  should wish you, whatever profession you may choose to follow, to spend the
  next two years, at least, at college. I am but little competent to advise you
  as to your future, for my own life has been in many ways a failure. But I
  remember always that you come of an old family, whose name has never been
  sullied by trade, and do not seek to amass wealth by unworthy means, or by
  pursuing an unworthy avocation. You will, doubtless, be sought after by many
  at college; for, from reports I have of you, I gather that you possess no
  little of your father's good looks. But do not waste your time there in
  sports and the other pursuits of the rich; for remember that you have your
  own future to carve out and your way to make in the world. Follow out the
  course of reading which you may deem the most serviceable to you in the
  avocation which you decide to embrace, and let it be not too strict, but let
  there be a due, not undue, admixture of recreation, lest you become merely a
  useless bookworm like myself. Be careful of your health, and do not share the
  dissipations of those who will perforce be your associates; and, above all
  things, be careful with whom you enter into friendship. Be not too ambitious
  at this early stage of your life, lest in grasping at the shadow you lose the
  substance. Do not decide hurriedly upon your future, but when you have fully
  made up your mind in what direction your abilities and desires lead you do
  not be tempted by initiatory failure to try some other career, but persevere;
  and may the blessing of an old man, who might have been a better guardian to
  you, assist you.<br>
  <br>
  "Your affectionate uncle,<br>
  <br>
  "ANTHONY HARPENDEN."</p><br>

  <p>When I had read this letter I determined to travel down into Wiltshire on
  the very next day and see my uncle, for those few words concerning his
  illness convinced me that unless I did so at once I should not see him again.
  But by the next post came another letter in a strange handwriting and with an
  ominous black seal, and a few days later Lizzie and I, the sole mourners,
  stood beside the grave of well-nigh the only relation we had in the
  world.</p>

  <p>After the funeral we held a brief discussion as to our plans for the
  future. Lizzie was four years older than I, and we were at that time as
  different both in appearance and manners as brother and sister could well be.
  She possessed to the full extent her mother's evenness of temper and
  unselfishness of disposition, and she was quite content to stop on at
  Elmhurst, my uncle's old home, now ours, with an old housekeeper, her sole
  companion, whilst I went up to Oxford for the two years which my uncle had
  prescribed.</p>

  <p>Those two years passed, at any rate, harmlessly for me, if without any
  special benefit. I increased my classical knowledge considerably, but the
  greater part of my time was given to the prosecution of the hobby which was
  fast becoming a passion with me. I looked eagerly forward to the time of my
  leaving college, when I should have a studio of my own; for I had determined,
  it is needless to say, to become an artist, and with my thoughts so engrossed
  it was a matter of wonder to me that I succeeded in taking my degree.</p>

  <p>When the two years had elapsed, I easily persuaded Lizzie to let Elmhurst,
  and come to live with me near London. We took a small house near Sydenham,
  and then at last my impatient longings were gratified&mdash;I commenced work
  in a studio of my own. For twelve months we lived here quietly, I gaining
  fresh hopes every day, only to despair again when I wandered in to gaze at
  the masterpieces exhibited at the Academy and at the National Gallery, and
  compared them with my own poor work. And yet when I was back again, and alone
  in my little studio, hope would return with all its vigour, flinging fresh
  fuel on the fire of my imaginings, and I would deem again that all was within
  my reach, and that work, hard, unceasing work, could not fail in time to
  bring me the success I coveted.</p>

  <p>Alas! the work in which I trusted to bring me fame brought me instead a
  terrible misfortune&mdash;the misfortune to which I have already referred. I
  fell ill, almost to death, and then, with scarcely any warning, the fairest
  gift of life was taken from me. For, after weeks of half-unconscious pain
  and suspense, there came upon me in the night a sudden darkness, which the
  light of day could not dissipate, and there crept upon me a horrible
  suspicion that I was blind. I could not believe it at first. I cried out in
  my anguish that it must be some terrible nightmare, a passing
  faintness&mdash;anything but the horrible truth. I besought them, with my
  voice choked with sobs, to tell me that it was not true, but I heard no
  encouraging voices bid me hope, only the sound of a woman sobbing quietly by
  my bedside, and answering my piteous appeals with evasive tenderness. Then I
  fell back on my pillows worn out and miserable, and prayed to God that I
  might die.</p>

  <p>For many weeks afterwards my life hung upon a thread, and I felt that I
  cared no longer whether it should snap or no. What was there now which could
  make life precious to me? Nothing, absolutely nothing! Longing visions and
  fond dreams of success in my art, these had been the sole thoughts of my
  existence, the end and aim of all my exertions. The world had held no
  attraction which could win my thoughts for one moment from them, no happiness
  save in dreams of their consummation. As a blind man, I had no desire to
  live.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Fate decreed that I should recover from the fever which had
  brought me to the very verge of death, and slowly there came back to me my
  strength and faculties; all save the one I most coveted&mdash;my sight. Ah!
  the misery of those re-awakening hours, when every day I felt strength
  mustering in my body, and still that horrible darkness before my eyes. I fear
  that in that first period of my convalescence I acted little like a man, for
  I often turned my face to the wall, and first wept, then cursed and swore at
  all who sought to comfort me.</p>

  <p>Then there came over me a dull lethargy&mdash;a passive resignation, which
  from its very contrast to my former state made my nurses uneasy. The doctor,
  too, seemed disturbed at my slow progress, and counselled an immediate change
  of scene. So that, in about a week's time, despite my petulant protestations,
  we removed to a quiet little watering-place on the Norfolk coast. I was
  woefully ill and weak, and every little incident of the journey impressed
  upon me my utter impotency to such an extent that I cried aloud in the
  carriage, and when we reached our journey's end I was very nearly in a
  relapse. Contrary to my expectations, however, almost to my wishes, the air
  of the place soon had a wonderful effect upon me. At the end of the first
  week the bath-chair was dispensed with, and, leaning on Lizzie's arm, I could
  walk down the crazy narrow street, and along the esplanade, on to the cliffs,
  where the strong sea-breeze blowing full in my face brought strength and
  vigour, which, alas! I felt I cared little for now.</p>

  <p>At first I could not be persuaded to take any interest whatever in my
  surroundings; I would do nothing more active than sit and brood, in gloomy
  silence, on my ruined hopes and cheerless future. Those must have been very
  dull days for Lizzie, poor girl, but she never complained, and seldom left me
  for an hour. I was anything but a cheerful companion, for often during a
  whole morning we would sit at the end of the little pier (to which the sea
  comes occasionally) without speaking a word, she intent on her book or
  embroidery, I apparently dozing, but really nursing my bitter thoughts of a
  future which, from a fairyland of promise, had suddenly become a cheerless
  and dismal blank.</p>

  <p>Several weeks we spent in this fashion, while I slowly mended in health,
  and by degrees with the bodily improvement came some slight improvement in my
  spirits. I knew that I should please Lizzie if I appeared to take some slight
  interest in our surroundings; and one morning, for her sake, I asked some
  questions and exhibited some curiosity about the little place, and by the
  tone of her answer I knew that she was pleased. She laid down her knitting
  (we were sitting at the end of the little pier) and described the place
  minutely; told me of its little cluster of grey stone houses with red tiles,
  quaintly built, and nestling, as if for protection from the ever-encroaching
  sea, round the fine old church, which reared its lofty spire from amongst
  them like a veritable tower of protection. She told me of its narrow streets,
  without footway; of the rude flights of steps which led from the little town
  on to the pier or beach, and of the unpretending esplanade, with the green
  bank behind covered with daisies and dandelions. And then she spoke of the
  high cliffs with growing enthusiasm, stretching away on either side, covered
  with soft springy turf, and here and there with bracken, along which one
  could walk for miles, meeting full the strong salt breeze, and getting many
  pleasant views of the sea, wondrously blue, rippling in the little coves
  below. And she told me too of the white lighthouse, built on a hill of green
  turf, which swept its strong light at nighttime far away over the glistening
  waters below.</p>

  <p>And as she spoke of all these places I conjured up to myself fancies as to
  how they really looked, and amused myself by arranging them together in my
  thoughts, like a picture, until I almost fancied, leaning idly against the
  end of the jetty and turning my sightless orbs towards the town, that I could
  really see it stretched out before me just as she had described it; and,
  strange to say, from my well-nursed fancies of it the place seemed to grow
  familiar, and a sort of affection sprang up within me for it. Almost I
  fancied, as I stood there, that I could in truth see as she had described
  them&mdash;the dingy-looking building exactly opposite me, with the words
  Hotel de Paris sprawling along the front; the little plot of deserted lawn in
  front of it, with a few easy chairs and camp-stools placed carelessly about
  for the old people to repose in while they dozed, and blinked, and read their
  papers; and the wicket-gate leading from it unto the esplanade; and the crazy
  wooden steps which led down to the sands. From frequent and vivid description
  all these dwelt in my memory, and I built up for myself in my mind ideas as
  to their appearance and effect, until the whole became as a familiar picture
  to me, in which I took a keen and almost childlike interest. Ah, well I many
  and many a time have I visited Cromer since those few months of my
  convalescence. I have stopped at that old-fashioned but comfortable hotel,
  and spent many happy days upon those bracken-covered cliffs, drinking in the
  strong, exhilarating sea-breeze, than which there is none purer in England. I
  have climbed up the steep little hill to the lighthouse, and admired from its
  summit over and over again the picturesque little town nestling in the hollow
  below, with the blue sea stretching up to its very feet, and laughed at the
  old wooden jetty dignified with the name of pier, most useful as a protection
  from the sun's rays to the loungers on the sands below. Also have I joined in
  the little crowd who at half-past ten block up the narrow little street
  opposite the post-office, awaiting the morning papers; and I have been one of
  the old fogies who have sat on the neglected lawn in front of the hotel, and
  have read my paper, and dozed, and blinked, and gazed at the blue sea
  stretching out before me, steeped in a quiet, passive enjoyment
  incomprehensible to the younger spirits. A quiet, dull hole I have heard the
  place often called, and no doubt with a certain amount of reason; but I love
  it, and am blind to its imperfections, partly because it was here I first
  found consolation from my terrible trouble, partly because the place itself
  is pleasant to me, and partly&mdash;but I must reserve my other reason until
  my story is told.</p>

  <p>Time slipped quietly away, and every day my convalescence became more and
  more assured; and with my returning bodily strength I grew somewhat more
  reconciled to the fact of my existence. True, the future seemed still a
  hopeless blank; but I was content for the time to abandon myself to the
  luxury of breathing the fresh, pure air and feeling the strength stealing
  once more into my frame, and I spent the long summer days lying about on the
  cliffs, or beach, or sitting on the pier, while Lizzie would read to me such
  books as I approved. The daily papers I forbade. The world's events possessed
  but little interest for me, for I deemed myself outside it altogether.
  Neither did I care for novels, and for the first time in my life found
  pleasure in poetry, although Lizzie was at best but an indifferent reader;
  and in such manner the time passed away.</p>

  <p>One morning there came a change into our quiet life. Lizzie had left me
  for a few minutes on the pier while she went into the little town to execute
  some trifling commission. She was gone longer than I expected, and I began to
  get impatient, for solitude was my <i>bête noire</i>, bringing, as it
  naturally did, reflection&mdash;reflection which could not fail to engender
  sad thoughts which I fain would banish and keep away. Just as I was growing
  fretful and uneasy, I heard her voice as she descended the steps, and, to my
  surprise, she was talking to some one who appeared to be accompanying her,
  and then I heard them turn on to the pier, and I knew without doubt that my
  sister had a companion. My first impulse was not of surprise&mdash;although
  it might well have been, for I knew that Lizzie was reserved and adverse to
  chance acquaintances&mdash;but rather of keen and selfish annoyance. Lizzie
  knew that I hated strangers, and, over-sensitive in those early days of my
  trouble, liked nothing so little as sympathy or condolence, however gently
  expressed. I had all the whims and tempers of a spoilt child then; and when I
  heard them coming towards me, I turned my head obstinately away, and, leaning
  over the wooden railing with folded arms, assumed an attitude of deep
  abstraction.</p>

  <p>"Vernon," my sister said pleadingly, laying her hand timidly upon my
  shoulder, "I have met an old school friend;" and I was perforce bound to turn
  my head.</p>

  <p>"My brother Vernon&mdash;Miss Ellis. You have often heard me speak of
  Margaret Ellis, Vernon; this is she."</p>

  <p>I raised my hat, muttering some half-inarticulate words intended to convey
  my pleasure at so unexpected a rencontre. In reality, I was
  annoyed&mdash;sulky, she has since told me, laughingly. Then she spoke in a
  soft, musical voice, which, despite my ill-humour, gave me keen pleasure to
  listen to; for since my blindness every day my hearing seemed to grow more
  sensitive.</p>

  <p>"I was quite delighted to meet your sister just now, Mr. Harpenden," she
  said, "for I am almost alone here, and Cromer is such a very quiet place
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>I assented, but not in words; and she continued rather
  nervously&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Liz has been telling me of your illness, and of its effect. I am very
  sorry."</p>

  <p>I muttered something conventional, and then we all three sat down and
  talked, rather constrainedly at first; but soon my ill-humour vanished, and I
  began to find it very pleasant to listen to that low, melodious
  voice&mdash;so pleasant that I was actually sorry when lunch-time came; and
  when we parted at the top of the steps, with arrangements to meet in the
  afternoon, I was in better spirits than a few hours before I could have
  believed possible.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Margaret Ellis, my sister's old school friend was, like us, an orphan,
  and, like us, a poor one. She had come to Cromer with an aunt, who was a
  confirmed invalid, seldom leaving her room: to whom we were, indeed,
  introduced, but whom we seldom saw. And as she, Mrs. Ellis, preferred the
  attentions of her maid, who had lived with her all her life, to her niece's
  nursing (execrable taste I), Margaret had a great deal of time on her hands,
  most of which she spent with us. And we welcomed her&mdash;Lizzie because
  they were old friends, and I because her coming was a pleasant change, so
  pleasant, indeed, that my worst and most irritable days soon became those on
  which we saw her least often. As a rule, she would join us soon after
  breakfast, and then would come the question, "Pier, sands, or cliffs?"
  Generally in the morning we chose the latter; and as I lounged on the soft
  turf, and bared my head to catch the pure, sweet breeze, listening the while
  to Margaret's musical voice as she read aloud to us, I began to feel that
  life might still, under some circumstances, be endurable. What those
  circumstances involved I did not pause to think. I had had enough of thought
  and misery for a while, and I gave myself up to the enjoyment of the present
  without a single thought of the future, without caring to realize fully the
  consciousness, which now and then faintly troubled me, that it was an unseen
  presence which made the days go by so happily.</p>

  <p>One day I startled Lizzie by asking her to describe her friend. She laid
  down her knitting and considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Well, I scarcely know how to describe her," she began.</p>

  <p>Of course not. How is it, I wonder, that a woman can never describe
  another woman? If she does attempt the task, she gives it you disconnectedly
  and without enthusiasm, until it all sounds like a police description of a
  missing person. I had not the slightest desire to listen to such.</p>

  <p>"I only want to know the colour of her hair and eyes," I told Lizzie. And
  these I soon learnt: soft grey eyes and lightish-coloured hair.</p>

  <p>"You could scarcely call her beautiful," Lizzie continued, "but she is
  certainly interesting."</p>

  <p>I turned away to hide a smile. Not call her beautiful! I knew better, and
  could positively describe her better than Lizzie. True, I was blind; but the
  blind, to make up for their loss of sight, have generally a keen development
  of the other senses, enabling them to lay hold of trifles which would escape
  an ordinary person, and by piecing them together to arrive at conclusions
  mostly correct. I knew that Margaret was tall by her voice, and I could tell
  that she was graceful by her regular, even movements. Then her voice was in
  itself a charm, and fell always like music upon my sensitive ears, lulling me
  into a strange repose at times, and at others fiercely quickening my weak
  pulse. It possessed for me a curious fascination, which I cannot and never
  could describe&mdash;a sort of animal magnetism which drew me to her, and
  when it ceased still seemed to haunt me, and render me as conscious of her
  presence as if she was still speaking. In my imagination I drew her portrait
  with scrupulous exactitude, and so I carried always in my fancy a distinct
  and vivid idea of her personality. It amused me to discover each day by
  careless questionings what she wore, and then, when she had left us, to lean
  back, and, dosing my eyes, to clothe my fancy portrait of her as she had
  appeared that day; and in time I grew to prefer one style of dress for her,
  and laughingly she would humour my whim and adopt the style which pleased me
  best. And so the days passed away with us, bringing little change or
  variation; as, indeed, we needed none, for I believe the quiet life satisfied
  us all.</p>

  <p>One morning Margaret came down to us on the pier earlier than usual, and
  from her excited manner it was not difficult to surmise that something had
  happened. A great oculist had come down to Cromer for a day or two, and was
  stopping at the <i>Hotel de Paris</i>; and Margaret, who had heard of his
  arrival, was eager for me to consult him, for my own doctor had counselled me
  to seek some more competent judge than he directly I was strong enough to
  bear the excitement.</p>

  <p>Dr. Holdsworth was a specialist of great renown, and directly Margaret
  mentioned his name I determined to seek him at once, although I had but
  little hope of any good coming from it. Silently we all three walked down the
  pier and up the steps to the door of the hotel, and there they left me. My
  hand touched Margaret's for a moment as we parted&mdash;only for a
  moment&mdash;but I felt that she was trembling, and a sudden, strange thrill
  of joy passed through me, and made me for a short while almost forgetful of
  my errand; and then there followed with a rush a fierce intense longing to
  know my fate, and somehow I felt that a new interest depended upon the
  verdict I had come to gain. The hall-porter who appeared to answer my ring
  conducted me into a tiny apartment called the smoking-room, and, carefully
  placing a chair for me by the open window, took my card and a message and
  left me to seek Dr. Holdsworth. The minutes that elapsed before the door
  again opened seemed like long hours to me, waiting with feverish excitement
  to know my fate. I heard merry voices from the room above me, and through the
  open window came laughing speeches and quick retorts, to which I listened
  eagerly, with straining ears, leaning out of window and grasping the stone
  sill with my moist hands till they were all bruised and cut. Then my
  attention was diverted to a child playing on the lawn with battledore and
  shuttlecock, and I counted earnestly the number of times the shuttlecock fell
  with dull thud upon the racket, beginning again each time that a cessation of
  the sound and a burst of childish laughter announced that the feathered ball
  had fallen outside the player's reach. My brain seemed on fire. I wondered
  where I was, what I was waiting for, whether it was not all a dream, and in
  nervous desperation I struck myself a blow, and pinched my arms until they
  were black and blue, feeling at the time no pain. Then a horrible idea crept
  over me. I thought that I was a criminal in a prison cell, waiting to be led
  forth to die, and I put my hands up to my neck, almost fancying that I could
  feel the rope around it, and then, just as with an effort I smothered a
  shriek, the door opened, and with it my self-possession returned like a
  flash. I rose and bowed. I apologized to Dr. Holdsworth for intruding upon
  him, and stated my case with all the calmness of a third party, although I
  felt that he was watching me keenly. He listened courteously, and then,
  turning me towards the light, examined both my eyes with a small instrument.
  Then he moved away and rested the instrument upon the table, returning slowly
  to my side; and though I knew that the examination was over, my quivering
  lips refused to frame the question I fain would ask. He did not keep me very
  long in suspense, though, but said, in tones which seemed to me almost
  brutally matter-of-fact&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, but I can do nothing for you. Your case is perfectly
  hopeless."</p>

  <p>I had told myself that I would be prepared for the worst, but, despite my
  efforts, hope had lingered strong within me. With whom does it not linger, I
  wonder, however desperate their strait? The criminal, condemned to die, even
  on the morning of his execution is not without lingering vestiges of hope. A
  reprieve may come at the last moment, the rope may break, something may
  happen to delay the dread finale; and who would grudge him the consolation of
  this faint but precious hope? There are men whom we meet in every-day life
  carrying behind a smiling face and placid exterior burdens utterly
  disproportionate to their strength, and only one thing keeps them alive and
  gives them strength to do it&mdash;hope, hope: to us human beings who, like
  myself, have passed through a furnace of trouble, the greatest gift, the one
  inestimable boon vouchsafed us by a considerate and merciful dispensation.
  The hard-worked man of business, the student, the politician, the invalid,
  the anxious mother, have each their trouble lessened and their lot made
  endurable by this most precious gift. Even if the hope be fallacious, its
  realization impossible, for pity's sake tell them not so; still with weary
  hearts but smiling faces they will struggle on, if not with equanimity, with
  their sufferings allayed and chastened by the fond hopes they cherish.</p>

  <p>Oh, the misery with parting with that hope, of having it torn away by
  ruthless hands, and being left unaided to fight with a terrible,
  overmastering misfortune! That one ray of light extinguished, all seems dark.
  Without hope, life, a thing of light and promise to others, to us becomes a
  meaningless chaos, devoid of interest, and which we feel may pass around us
  and over us, but in which we have no participation.</p>

  <p>Alas for me when I heard those fatal words! For the hope which, despite
  myself, had lingered within me, and which only one hour ago had been fanned
  into a blaze, was now utterly crushed and extinguished, and I also was one of
  those from whom the light of life had been taken.</p>

  <p>Slowly I rose, pressed upon Mr. Holdsworth a fee, which he declined, and
  groped my way towards the door.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Mr. Harpenden," said the doctor, and I paused on the
  threshold. "I have told you that your case is hopeless, and so, in truth, I
  believe it. But I think that it is only right to inform you that there is a
  German, Herr Dondez, who professes to be able to cure cases of glaucoma, such
  as yours. Frankly, I tell you I don't believe it," he continued; "but if you
  have plenty of money to throw away, you might go over and see him. It would
  do you no harm, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"His treatment involves considerable expense, then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It does. His fees are enormous, and his course of treatment necessitates
  heavy expenditure. It would probably cost you a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>The gleam of returning hope was but transitory and at the doctor's words
  it fled. I thanked him and dismissed the subject from my mind at once. A
  thousand pounds was as far out of my reach as one hundred thousand. For even
  had I been able, which I was not, to touch the principal of our little
  fortune, and had the chances of success been much greater, I should have
  hesitated long before I risked so large a share of our income on an issue so
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>Dr. Holdsworth followed me from the room, and guided me down the hall to
  the steps of the hotel, and outside in the street I found Lizzie and Margaret
  waiting for me. They asked no questions, so I suppose my face told them as
  much as they wished to know; and, slipping my arm through Lizzie's, we all
  three turned silently away and walked down the esplanade towards the cliffs.
  Lizzie was crying quietly, and once I fancied that I heard a low sob from the
  other side; but though I strained my ears I heard no repetition of it, so it
  might have been fancy. When we turned on to the cliffs I was glad to lie down
  and rest for a while; but we none of us cared to break the silence, and
  slowly the morning passed away with scarcely a word from any one. Woman is a
  consoling angel, no doubt; but when there is no hope, what consolation can
  she whisper? And with such a terrible trial as mine staring me in the face,
  what could they say to comfort me? So silently and sorrowfully the morning
  passed away, and after lunch, for the first time since Margaret had commenced
  to spend all her time with us, I did not propose starting to meet her; and
  Lizzie, seeing that I made no movement, stayed in also. Sorrows seldom come
  alone, and side by side with mine loomed another, almost as hard to bear as
  the loss of sight; for I knew now that I loved Margaret Ellis, and my love
  must be buried. Not for worlds would I have made her unhappy by telling her
  of my folly; and besides, what would be the use? That she did not know it as
  yet I was assured, for until I had gone in to learn my fate from the famous
  specialist I had not known it myself. It had come upon me like a sudden
  revelation as I felt her trembling hand, and for the moment had made me madly
  happy, then wildly excited, as I had realized that the verdict which I went
  in to hear would decide whether or no I might try to win her; and the verdict
  had been given against me, and I had come out from that interview with
  crushed hopes and with my heart well-nigh broken, for in those few moments
  the happiness of my life had been staked and lost.</p>

  <p>Henceforth I must exist&mdash;living I could no longer call
  it&mdash;without sight, without my beloved art, and without Margaret. Could
  man's lot be harder? I asked myself bitterly. To lose the woman I loved and
  the art I worshipped, to be left without either hope for the future or
  consolation for the present, to pass through life an outsider, never
  participating in its joys and pleasures, a hindrance and encumbrance to
  others, a miserable man myself! Ah! who can depict or realize the
  wretchedness, the utter misery, of the prospect before me?</p>

  <p>Towards evening I roused myself a little and called Lizzie to me. I told
  her what Dr. Holdsworth had said about the German specialist, and for a
  moment she brightened up and urged me to sell out our little fortune and make
  a bold bid for happiness. But I argued with her that in case of failure, and
  failure was almost certain, we should be poverty-stricken for life, which, in
  justice to her, must not be; and I told her Dr. Holdsworth's opinion of this
  man's capacities, and in the end she was convinced, as also was I against my
  will, that it would be money thrown away to no purpose. Then I came to the
  most difficult part of what I had to say, but unwittingly she helped me.</p>

  <p>"And Margaret?" she whispered timidly. Then I knew that she had divined my
  secret.</p>

  <p>"I must not see her," I said hoarsely, turning my head away; for, man
  though I was, the horror of that day had all unwrought me, and there were
  tears in my eyes. I was ashamed that Lizzie should see them, and I motioned
  her away; but I was too late, and I felt her little hand steal into mine, and
  her arm around my neck, as with her voice all unsteady with sobs she tried to
  comfort me.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Vernon, it is cruel!" was all that she could falter out; and then she
  burst into tears, while I&mdash;why should I be ashamed to acknowledge that
  the tears which fell into her handkerchief were not all hers, for I, too, was
  weeping like a child?</p>

  <p>By degrees I recovered myself, and after the fit was over I felt more like
  myself than I had done since the final blow had fallen. I drew Lizzie to me,
  and took her hand in mine.</p>

  <p>"I want to say a few words about Margaret, Liz. You won't ask me any
  questions, there's a dear girl, but just do as I ask you? We must get away
  from this place as soon as possible. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning you had better go to meet her as usual, and say that I
  am not well, that I preferred remaining indoors&mdash;anything. You can leave
  her soon and come back to me. You can easily make some excuse not to meet her
  in the afternoon; and, above all, Liz, be careful not to let her guess at the
  real reason why I wish to avoid her. Promise me that."</p>

  <p>She promised, but not in words, for her eyes were still wet with tears.
  After that we had tea, and in the evening she read to me, and from her
  reading I derived little pleasure. After Margaret's wonderful voice hers
  seemed harsher and more uneven than ever, and I was glad when she laid the
  book down and proposed going to bed. I slept little that night, and on the
  morrow, after breakfast, felt no inclination to go out, so, as we had
  previously arranged, Lizzie started out alone. Before she left I made her
  write a telegram to my doctor in London, asking him his opinion of Dr.
  Holdsworth as an eye specialist, and also asking him whether he knew anything
  of the German, Dondez. Then I got her to write a few lines to a distant
  connection of my father's, an old bachelor, whom we had never seen, telling
  him the circumstances of my case, and asking him for the loan of a thousand
  pounds. Needless to say, I scarcely expected an answer to this last
  letter.</p>

  <p>Long before Lizzie returned came the answer to my telegram:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Holdsworth first in Europe on eye; believe other man a quack."</p>

  <p>Damning confirmation this of my own conclusions.</p>

  <p>At lunch-time Lizzie returned, and, having nothing to conceal from her, I
  asked eagerly whether she had been with Margaret.</p>

  <p>Yes, she had been with her, was all she told me at first; and when I
  questioned her further she did not immediately reply, but throwing her arms
  around my neck sobbed out:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Vernon! are you sure that you are doing right?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," I answered firmly. "Tell me, what did she say?"</p>

  <p>My sister dried her eyes slowly.</p>

  <p>"She said nothing, Vernon; but I think that she was hurt. We need not
  hurry away, after all, unless you like, for she is leaving this week."</p>

  <p>Leaving! The news was like a stab to me; and yet I knew that it was best
  so, and, in my calmer moments, I prayed that we might not come across her
  again during our rambles. Fate decreed otherwise, however; for a few mornings
  later Lizzie left me for a few moments by the low railing above the pier
  while she went into the post-office to get some stamps. She had scarcely been
  gone a moment when I heard a light footstep crossing the esplanade towards
  me, and my heart stood still for a moment and then beat madly. The footsteps
  stopped, and I knew then full well who it was stood beside me, but I affected
  ignorance and toyed carelessly with my stick. But it slipped out of my
  trembling fingers and rolled out of my reach.</p>

  <p>She picked it up and gave it to me.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Harpenden." And then I pretended a little start, as if
  just aware of her presence, and held out my hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Miss Ellis." Not long ago I had called her Margaret without
  reproof; and when I had wished her good-morning, for the life of me I could
  think of nothing else to say, and so we stood for nearly a minute in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Just in time to wish me good-bye," she said lightly, though I fancied
  that there was a tremor in her tones. "We are going away in half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" and I ventured to hope that she had enjoyed her visit, feeling
  all the time as though I were playing with the words.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I enjoyed the first part," she said frankly, "I have been very dull
  the last day or two. Have I offended you, I wonder, Mr. Harpenden?" she said
  hesitatingly. "If so, I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Offended me? Of course not!" I answered, leaning forward and listening
  eagerly for Lizzie's returning footsteps. "I have not been in the humour for
  any one's society but my own the last day or two. I am sorry if I have kept
  Liz away from you."</p>

  <p>"There was no other reason why you wished to avoid me?" she asked in a low
  tone; and I felt that if Lizzie did not come back at once I was lost.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," I answered brusquely. "What a time my sister is buying
  those stamps!"</p>

  <p>I could tell in a moment that it was she who was offended now, but I did
  not care so long as she left me without discovering my secret.</p>

  <p>"Shall I find her for you?" she asked coldly; and, as I bowed my head, she
  turned and left me. Soon they came up together to where I stood, and after a
  minute or two's desultory conversation, a messenger from the hotel summoned
  Margaret. The omnibus was waiting, she must come at once; and so, with a
  hurried good-bye, she left us, and we heard the omnibus roll away. She was
  gone, and silently, hand in hand, Liz and I returned to our seat on the
  cliffs.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Three weeks after Margaret had left Cromer, we also packed up our things
  and returned to London. So long as she had been there the place had possessed
  a sort of fascination for me, and although the last few days had been spent
  in planning to avoid her, I had no wish to leave. Directly she had gone,
  however, I began to find the place intolerable, and longed to get away. The
  weather, too, turned colder, and afforded a good excuse, and so we went back
  to our cottage at Sydenham. Margaret lived with her aunt near Manchester, so
  there was no chance of meeting her in London; and for my part I was glad,
  for, although she was seldom absent from my thoughts, I carefully impressed
  upon myself the fact that our meeting again could bring me nothing but keener
  unhappiness. She wrote to Lizzie occasionally, but Lizzie never read the
  letters to me; indeed, by mutual, though unspoken, consent, we avoided even
  the mention of her name. None the less, however, did she dwell in my
  thoughts, nor could any effort of mine drive away the remembrance of those
  happy days at Cromer. Perhaps the first month or two after our return to
  London was the most unhappy period of my life, for from the moment that Dr.
  Holdsworth had pronounced his verdict I had lost all hope, and my existence
  became a trial to myself, and also, I fear, to Lizzie. Every day was but a
  stereotyped repetition of the preceding one, the only thing to look forward
  to being its close, that I might retire and console myself with the morbid
  reflection that another twenty-four hours of my wretched existence had passed
  away. My sole wish was to die as quickly as possible. With every pleasure in
  life denied me, was it any wonder that such was my great desire? I believe
  that in those days nothing but cowardice, springing from absolute exhaustion
  of body and mind, kept me from by my own hand terminating my weary existence.
  I was too spiritless to make the attempt, or I verily believe that I should
  have done it; and I believe, too, that Lizzie feared something of the sort,
  for she watched me closely, and seldom left my side. Thus the time dragged
  wearily on, every day finding me more apathetic and brooding, and, if
  possible, more miserable. I had given up taking exercise, and my appetite
  began to fail me. Like Job, I turned my face to the wall and prayed that I
  might die. I grew pale, my clothes commenced to hang loosely about me, and
  Lizzie begged hard that I would see a doctor; but I refused, for my wish was
  to die, and my weakness increasing every day, I began to have hopes the end
  was drawing near. Then one morning came a wonderful surprise, which roused me
  of a sudden from my sullen torpor, and brought the colour again to my cheeks
  and the light to my eyes. There was a letter addressed to me, which, as
  usual, Lizzie opened, but she had scarcely read it through when she jumped up
  with a cry of joy and amazement, calling out, "Listen, Vernon!" and then she
  read:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"LINCOLN'S INN, February 2, 18&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  "DEAR SIR&mdash;We are instructed by a client, who desires to remain
  anonymous, to hand to you the enclosed cheque for #1,000, and our client
  further wishes us to state that this sum is to be applied by you to seeking
  the advice of a certain Dr. Dondez, of Utrecht, with reference to a malady of
  the eyes, with which you are afflicted.<br>
  <br>
  "Any further expenses which a temporary residence in Utrecht or fees to Dr.
  Dondez may necessitate will be paid by us on a personal application from you,
  the only stipulation being that you do not attempt to discover our client's
  personality.<br>
  <br>
  "A receipt for the cheque by return of post will much oblige<br>
  <br>
  "Your obedient servants,<br>
  "COLES &amp; GREEN."</p><br>

  <p>The letter slipped from her trembling fingers, and with a low, choking cry
  of joy she flung herself into my arms.</p>

  <p>"Read it again!" I gasped, for I was bewildered and could scarcely believe
  my ears; and recovering herself a little, she dried her streaming eyes, and
  with broken voice and in disjointed sentences read it through again to me.
  There could be no possible mistake; it was all plain enough, and the
  solicitor's cheque for #1,000 lay on the table, as Lizzie over and over again
  assured me.</p>

  <p>"Whom can it be from?" she cried in wondering tones as she laid the letter
  down; but I scarcely heard, and certainly did not answer her. I had risen to
  my feet, and was pacing with unsteady footsteps the little room. "Whom was it
  from?" In those first few moments of reawakened hope, what cared I whom it
  was from? One grand idea filled my whole understanding, and I had no room for
  other thoughts. Within my grasp lay the means of making a glorious effort for
  the recovery of my lost sense, and the very possibility of success was such
  wild and rapturous happiness that it turned me dizzy, intoxicated with a wild
  delirium of hope. It was possible that I might be once more like other men,
  that this eternal darkness might be rolled away from my eyes. To see! Ah, who
  can realize the maddening exhilaration of that thought who have not
  themselves been blind! No parched traveller in the desert longs so eagerly
  for water, no starving man craves so fiercely for bread, as longs the blind
  man for his sight. Imagine, if you can, the wild, unutterable joy which those
  feel who are blind to whom comes a sudden ray of hope that they may escape
  from their miserable blindness, and gaze once more upon the light of heaven
  and the faces of those whom they love. Several times Lizzie spoke to me
  during my restless perambulation, but in vain, for I was in a world of my
  own, and her voice troubled me not; for the first time since my illness, I
  was living indeed, and living thoughts were crowding in upon
  me&mdash;thoughts of what I might yet accomplish in my art, and wild dreams
  of winning Margaret surged madly into my brain. The colour came back to my
  cheeks, and the energy returned to my frame as I paced recklessly to and fro.
  Ah, how sweet life might yet be to me could I but return to it; for I had
  ceased to regard myself as living in my helpless state, and had prayed often
  and often for death to relieve Lizzie of her burden and me of my misery. And
  now again hope lifted the curtain which I had kept resolutely down, and
  showed me life in its most glowing and alluring colours, until I panted to
  join in it and be once more a unit, however insignificant, in the world of my
  fellow-men.</p>

  <p>The remainder of that day seemed like a strange dream to me now, of which
  I can only recollect fragmentary parts, but I know that it was hours before I
  could collect my glowing thoughts and bring them down to the present. When at
  last exhausted, I sank into a chair, Lizzie came and sat beside me.</p>

  <p>"Whom can it be from?" she exclaimed again in wondering tones, the
  prevailing instinct of her sex overcoming even her joy; and for the first
  time I also troubled myself to consider. We both came to the conclusion that
  it must be from my eccentric relation, who had not even answered my letter
  from Cromer. There was no one else, and his eccentricity would account for
  the strange way in which he had conveyed his gift; and so we blessed him
  together, the while we determined to respect his whim and refrain from
  thanking him.</p>

  <p>Early on the morrow we called on Mr. Coles, but our hopes of extracting
  any information from him proved futile, for he was impenetrable. One thing we
  did ascertain, that Mr. Rowland (our relation) was a client of his, and this
  we accepted as proof positive that he was my mysterious benefactor. It was
  some time before I could reconcile myself to the idea of leaving England
  without even writing him a letter of thanks. But Lizzie and I talked the
  matter over well, and we decided that, since he had taken such pains to
  remain unknown, we ought, however incongruous and ungrateful it might appear,
  to fall in with his whim and not let him know that we had divined his
  generosity. And so in less than a fortnight we left England, having promised
  Mr. Coles to let him have news of my progress every week to transmit to my
  unknown friend.</p>

  <p>That anonymous gift was indeed a godsend to me, for in less than twelve
  months my sight was fully restored. A weary time of probation I had, 'tis
  true, but it was rendered less tedious by the sustaining influence of hope
  which had sprung up strong within me, for Herr Dondez from the first
  expressed his conviction that my case, although a grave one, was not
  incurable, and after a month or two's careful nursing I was pronounced strong
  enough for the operation. It was a successful one, and when I came to my
  senses after it, the chaos in front of my eyes was somewhat changed; and when
  on a sudden impulse I lifted my hands, I found that I had on an enormous pair
  of green spectacles, through which, it is true, I could not distinguish
  objects, but nevertheless, I could tell that there was a change, for the
  thick, black, impenetrable darkness had given way to a milder obscurity, not
  half so dense, and I knew that I had entered upon the first stage of my
  recovery.</p>

  <p>Slowly the weeks passed away, Lizzie full of exuberant happiness, and I
  full of a calmer but none the less deep joy. We were in lodgings at Utrecht,
  on the third floor of a tall, old-fashioned house. We were very comfortable,
  but had the place been a veritable dungeon we should scarcely have grumbled,
  for the great happiness which loomed in the immediate future absorbed all our
  thoughts. Every day we would descend the narrow stairs and either walk for an
  hour or two in the square, or drive, according to the weather; and every
  third day we paid a visit to Herr Dondez, who was full of unqualified
  approval of my progress and encouraging assurances of my approaching
  recovery.</p>

  <p>In due course the second stage came, and, confined to my chamber, with the
  blinds drawn closely down, and every chink which could let in the light
  stopped up, my glasses were changed for less thick ones, and a day or two
  later, waking up as usual one morning, I startled Lizzie, who slept in the
  next room, by calling for her loudly, and when she hurried in to me, I
  welcomed her with a passionate cry, of joy.</p>

  <p>"Liz! Liz! It has come at last!&mdash;the armchair, the walls, the
  table&mdash;I can see them all; and you too, Liz! Thank God!" And, overcome,
  I sobbed and laughed in a paroxysm of childish delight, while she stood by
  and joined in my hysterical happiness.</p>

  <p>From that day I passed rapidly through the remaining stages of my
  recovery, and in a few weeks Lizzie and I left for England, I helpless no
  longer, and wearing only a pair of ordinary spectacles, with the assurance of
  being able to dispense with these even before long; and on the homeward
  voyage Lizzie told me a secret, which more than ever filled me with love and
  gratitude to her who had been for so long my gentle and patient nurse. Just
  at the time when my blindness had come upon me, a new happiness had commenced
  to dawn before her, but for my sake she had given it up, and, making a
  sacrifice which only a woman, and a true, faithful woman, could have made,
  she had answered "no" to the man whom she loved, and instead of seeking
  happiness with him, she had devoted herself to the hard and thankless task of
  being my nurse and companion. And what a dull, tedious life hers must have
  been during that weary while, every moment of which was spent in ministering
  to my wants, listening to my fretful complaints, and cheering me through my
  despondent and sulky moods! I know that I was a troublesome charge and a bad
  patient, but she (Lizzie) bore all without a complaint and cheerfully. She,
  too, is happy now; and I know that her happiness is none the less deep and
  perfect because she risked it all without a murmur that she might lighten my
  misery.</p>

  <p>He whom she had loved was a poor man, a curate in a suburb of London; but
  very soon after our return from abroad they were married. They would have had
  me live with them, but I preferred solitude and my art, and I took rooms in a
  quiet part of the metropolis, fitting the chief one up as a studio, and
  commenced again to follow with frantic zeal my beloved pursuit. Before we had
  set foot in England, Lizzie had slipped into my hand a newspaper many months
  old, with a whispered plea for forgiveness that she had kept it from me so
  long, and in it I read of Margaret's marriage to a Manchester millionaire; so
  there was no other object to fill my thoughts. Gradually my eyes grew quite
  strong, and I laboured without ceasing to make up for lost time, for with the
  recovery of my sight had come back to me the glowing dreams and wild ambition
  of my younger days. One sorrow still hung over me, and frequently diverted my
  thoughts for a while, and often the brush would slip from my fingers and I
  would think for hours together of those dreamy days at Cromer. That strange
  passion for my unseen enchantress I had never been able to stamp out, and it
  threw a tinge of sadness around my life, even after the wonderful joy of my
  recovery. I felt sometimes that I would have given everything to have looked
  for once into her face, and to have seen her whom my fancy so strongly
  depicted. And yet, <i>cui bono</i>? In all probability she had forgotten my
  very name; and was she not besides the wife of another man? It were better
  that I should banish from my memory every recollection, however sweet, of
  those happy days, and with such determination I would turn resolutely to my
  canvas and work with renewed energy.</p>

  <p>As the summer drew on and the heat in my little studio became unbearable,
  I began to long for a change and a whiff of sea air. The first place that
  suggested itself was Cromer, and hailing the idea as an inspiration, I
  went.</p>

  <p>It was the first time that I had seen the place, but so accurately had
  Lizzie described it to me that everything seemed familiar, and I felt a keen
  interest in finding out the places to which I had been led&mdash;the little
  wooden jetty, the narrow streets, the bracken-covered cliffs, and the low
  railing in front of the hotel, leaning against which I had fought that battle
  with myself when Margaret's kind questions and low trembling voice had almost
  driven me mad. These all I quickly recognized, and found a curious pleasure
  in seeking out&mdash;a pleasure enhanced by the sweet subtle recollections
  they inspired. And yet there was pain in such recollections, and after the
  first day or two I began to wonder whether I had not been a fool to come.</p>

  <p>One afternoon I sat on the cliffs, halfway between Cromer and Overstrand,
  sketching. I was absorbed in my work, and bending close over my canvas to
  introduce some delicate touches, so that, although I heard voices
  approaching, and stop quite close to me, I did not look up. A minute or two
  passed, and I was just regarding my work with a critical eye, when I was
  startled by a horrified cry of warning, followed by an agonized shriek. I
  sprang to my feet just in time to see a woman struggling for her balance on
  the very verge of the cliff, with her arms stretched out and grasping
  frantically at the empty air in a vain attempt to regain her equilibrium;
  then with a despairing cry she disappeared over the edge. A man, who had
  evidently been her companion, and I reached the spot together, and for a
  moment we stood looking at each other with blanched faces, dreading to glance
  downwards. Then lying flat, on my chest, I peered over the edge with a
  sickening throbbing of my heart, and I saw at once that something very
  extraordinary had happened. The unfortunate woman had been caught by a
  projecting mass of the cliff, scarcely thirty yards down, and was lying there
  all in a heap, apparently unconscious, whilst every moment the lump of earth
  on which she lay threatened to crumble away beneath her weight and plunge her
  down the whole awful distance. I scrambled to my feet. Her companion was
  standing a few yards back with his face buried in his hands, groaning.</p>

  <p>"We may save her yet!" I cried. "Make for the lighthouse yonder and get a
  rope and help. Run, for God's sake, run, or it will be too late!" And with an
  answering gesture he sprang away up the hill.</p>

  <p>Then, slowly and with caution, I commenced to descend the cliff from a
  point a few yards higher up, where just at first starting it was not so
  precipitous. It was a fearful task, and several times, as the loose soil
  crumbled away from beneath my feet, I closed my eyes and gave myself up for
  lost. For once fortune was on my side, however, and by a circuitous route I
  reached a mass of earth which afforded me footing for a moment or two, close
  to where she was lying. Then I ventured to look round and take in the
  prospect. She had evidently either fainted or was seriously hurt, for she lay
  there with closed eyes, all unconscious of her deadly peril, and I saw with
  horror that I was not a moment too soon, for the soil was giving way beneath
  her, and seemed to be about to immediately collapse. Between us, close to
  her, was a bush, and in that lay our only chance. How I was to reach it I
  could not at first imagine; it jutted out at right angles to the cliff, and
  was perfectly inaccessible to me except by a jump, and a jump I soon decided
  it must be. That was a horrid moment. Supposing I missed my footing or my
  grasp, where should I be? The former would avail me nothing unless at the
  same time I grasped the bush, for the frail platform of earth beneath was far
  too narrow and insecure to afford support of itself. Delay was of no avail,
  however, so, screwing up my courage, I jumped, and jumped to a hair's breadth
  where I had intended. The shrub was tough, and grasping it firmly with my
  left hand, I stooped down and passed my disengaged arm round her waist. She
  shivered as she felt my touch, and slowly opening her eyes, fixed them full
  on me with a bewildered, incredulous look slowly appearing in them, and then
  she murmured my name.</p>

  <p>I knew her, and the start I gave nearly cost us both our lives. Thus it
  was, for the first time I saw her, halfway between life and death, with only
  my arm to protect her from a fearful fate and like lightning flashed into my
  mind the sweet, maddening thoughts that if we died we should die together.
  Our awful position, which but a moment before had absorbed my every thought,
  was forgotten like magic. I forgot that unless help came we should surely
  die. I forgot everything save that we were together, Margaret and I, cut off,
  as it were, from the world; and I drew her closer to me, and covered her face
  with passionate kisses. And with her arms around my neck, half-fainting,
  half-sensible as she was, I laughed aloud in reckless disregard of the peril
  which but a moment before had appalled me.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me a lifetime that we hung on there together, and yet they
  told me afterwards that it could have been only a quarter of an hour. Then
  shouts from above roused me from my passionate contemplation, and I saw a
  rope with a sort of noose at the end descending, and knew that in all
  probability we were saved. Carefully I fastened the rope around her, and
  then, bending down once more, I kissed her unrebuked.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Margaret," I whispered; and then I shouted to the men above,
  and slowly she was drawn away from me.</p>

  <p>"You too!" she called out anxiously, as she felt herself moving; and I
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"In a moment; I'm quite safe here," and breathlessly I watched her being
  drawn away from me, until at last she reached the top and disappeared over
  the edge. Then the rope was sent down again, and, fastening it around my own
  waist, I scrambled up the cliff.</p>

  <p>Margaret, ghastly pale and apparently again unconscious, had been placed
  in a Bath-chair; and from amongst the little group which surrounded it her
  husband stepped out, and hurried towards me with outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"You have saved my wife's life, sir," he said warmly, "and I can never
  thank you enough. My name is Hathern;" he handed me a card. "And yours?"</p>

  <p>"Harpenden," I told him, and muttered that he exaggerated my services.</p>

  <p>"Where are you stopping here?" he asked, glancing round at the Bath-chair,
  which was being wheeled away. I told him, and, shaking my passive hand
  heartily, he hurried off, promising to look me up.</p>

  <p>The few loiterers whom the commotion had brought together soon moved away,
  and I was left alone on the scene which had well-nigh witnessed a tragedy.
  Mechanically I gathered up my sketching apparatus, and was moving off, when
  my eyes fell upon something white lying near the edge of the cliff. I crossed
  over to the spot, and found a handkerchief and a letter addressed to Mrs.
  Hathern. The writing on the envelope was familiar, and as I turned it over an
  enclosure dropped out and fluttered to the ground. I stooped to pick it up,
  and with a start recognized my own writing. I held it in my hand&mdash;the
  last letter that I had written to Messrs. Coles &amp; Green, announcing my
  complete recovery, and begging them to try and induce my unknown benefactor
  to declare himself. For a moment I was stupefied, and then the truth burst in
  upon me like a flash. It was Margaret who had sent me the thousand pounds. It
  was Margaret to whom I owed my sight.</p>

  <p>My first impulse was one of overpowering joy. I remembered her low,
  trembling tones, suggestive of an emotion which her words did not express,
  when we had parted at this very place two years ago. In my hand was proof of
  her great interest in me, and I remembered that but a few minutes ago she had
  lain in my arms unresisting, and suffered me to kiss her unchidden; had
  looked at me with a glad smile on her face when death stared us in the face.
  Surely it must be that she loved me. For a moment I revelled in the ecstasy
  of the thought, and then, like the awakening from a dream, came the bitter
  consciousness that the love of Margaret Hathern was a vain thing. The
  Margaret whom I had, whom, alas! I still, loved must be a memory, and a
  memory only. The wife of the Manchester millionaire could be nothing to
  me.</p>

  <p>I returned to my lodgings, and, leaving word that if any one called to see
  me I was out, I sat down and wrote to Mrs. Hathern. I returned to her the
  letters I had found, acknowledging that I had discovered her secret, and
  imploring her to tell me why she had done this thing. Then I packed up my few
  belongings, and prepared to start for London on the morrow; for with the
  remembrance of those few moments of exquisite, delirious joy strong within
  me, I felt that I dared not meet her again. Three times Mr. Hathern called to
  see me, and as he paid his last fruitless visit I watched him from behind the
  curtain, and marvelled to myself how he had been able to win the love of such
  a woman as Margaret. A plain, pompous-looking little man, with keen, almost
  cunning eyes, and unpleasant countenance, the very prototype of what he
  was&mdash;a successful financier. Bah! I let the curtain drop, and returned
  to my seat in a weary disgust to moralize on the madness and iniquity of
  marrying for money.</p>

  <p>Early on the morrow I left for London, and on the following day came the
  letter I was longing to receive. With trembling fingers I tore it
  open&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Vernon," (there was no orthodox commencement), "you bid me
  tell you all the truth, and now that I am married I may do so. To begin,
  then: When we met at Cromer, I pitied you for your trouble, and sympathized
  with you in your great misfortune, and before I left I had begun to care for
  you. I fancied sometimes that you cared for me, but I was never sure. I went
  as near telling you my secret as a woman may and still preserve her
  self-respect, on the morning of my departure. You answered me coldly; and I
  went away in anger, determined to forget you. I did not succeed. Often I
  thought of you, and often I longed to have it within my power to aid you
  towards the recovery of your sight. But I was poor, and as far off possessing
  a thousand pounds as you were. Then John Hathern was introduced to me at a
  friend's house near Manchester, and from that moment I was persecuted. He
  wanted me to marry him, and my aunt and all my friends pressed and implored
  me to accept him until I was driven nearly mad. Just as I grew desperate, an
  idea occurred to me. I cared little what happened to me, for life seemed
  cheerless and dull; so I told John Hathern that I would marry him on one
  condition&mdash;that he would give me a thousand pounds to do exactly as I
  pleased with, and ask no questions as to its disposal. Eagerly he consented;
  so I, caring little what became of me, sold myself for a thousand pounds, and
  sent you the money through a solicitor. Now you know all. I am a miserable
  woman, but I have a great, consolation in the thought that the price of my
  bondage has brought you back your sight. And, Vernon, God forgive me if it is
  wrong; but I have now another consolation, although it is a sad one&mdash;I
  have seen you, and I know that you love me. I knew it when I felt your arms
  around me, hanging on those terrible cliffs; and I would have been content at
  that moment to have died, for I would sooner die than live as I am living
  now. So, Vernon, I cannot thank you much for saving my life; though since it
  was to be saved, I am glad that it was you who saved it. Good-bye! Try and
  forget me; and, if we should ever meet, don 't speak to me. I could not
  refuse to see you if you came, or to speak to you if you addressed me, but,
  oh, Vernon, remember my one request to you&mdash;keep away from me. You know
  why; but let me tell you once more, for I hope and pray that I shall never
  see you again, I love you!<br>
  <br>
  "Good-bye.&mdash;MARGARET."</p><br>

  <p>That same night I left England, and for more than three years I wandered
  all over Europe, a miserable, unhappy man, carrying with me and nursing my
  bitter grief. I had no interest in life; I did nothing. If there had been war
  in any quarter of the globe, I should have enlisted; but there was none, and
  I could find no occupation to drown my sorrow. I stayed at Monaco, and lost
  in one evening every penny I had in the world at the tables; and all that
  night, instead of bemoaning my losses, I was lying awake thinking of
  Margaret. The next day, with a borrowed coin, I won all back, and broke the
  bank; but the flush of success was as powerless as were my losses to win me
  forgetfulness of my grief. Then I moved on to Rome, and here I found the
  first spark of relief. Love of my art came back to the rescue, and I sought
  an outlet for my sorrows by frantically hard work. My pictures began to sell,
  and I advanced rapidly. In little over a year I was able to return to my
  "unknown benefactor," through Messrs. Coles &amp; Green, the thousand pounds
  by means of which I had regained my sight. I moved to Paris, and success
  advanced to fame. Then, after three years' absence, I came back to England,
  and exhibited my masterpiece in the Academy. Success was at my feet now that
  I cared little for it. My picture was the picture of the season; it became
  the fashion, and people flocked to gaze upon it. I was pressed to accept for
  it sums which a few years back would have seemed a fortune; but I was well
  off now, and grimly declined all offers. I had made up my mind to keep that
  picture, and nothing would tempt me to sell. It hangs in my dining-room now,
  and few people enter the room without stopping for a moment to examine it
  more closely. There are the cliffs at Cromer, and, lying in midair, supported
  by a loose mass of stones and earth, and evidently in deadly peril, a woman
  is lying with her face upturned. It is that face which is the charm of the
  picture. Whose face it is I need scarcely say.</p>

  <p>I was not vain of my success, but simply out of pure love for the picture
  I used to go in and look at it for a few minutes every day, regardless of the
  crowds who hustled me and peered over my shoulder to look at the hit of the
  season. One, morning I arrived early, and, save for one woman, the space in
  front of it was deserted. As usual, I lingered there for nearly a quarter of
  an hour, deep in memories which that face and that scene never failed to
  awaken; and then, recalled to myself by the pitching of the people who were
  commencing to crowd around, I turned to go. As I withdrew myself from the
  group, I noticed that the lady who had forestalled me was still intently
  regarding the picture, and it struck me at once that there was something
  familiar in her attitude and figure. At that moment she turned slightly
  round, and then, over the heads and shoulders of a well-dressed mob of
  fashionable men and women, all engaged in criticism of my picture, I caught
  the gaze of the woman who had Inspired it, and Margaret and I stood face to
  face for the second time. I took a hasty step towards her, and then drew
  back; but her glad smile of welcome reassured me, and, faltering out some
  conventional greeting, I extended my hand. We stood for a moment in silence;
  then she pointed to the picture.</p>

  <p>"You have not forgotten, then?"</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget," I answered sadly, and, as if by mutual accord, we
  turned away and passed out into the street, I half-dazed by so sudden a
  rencontre, and scarcely believing that it was she indeed who walked by my
  side. Often had I pictured to myself such a meeting, and had imagined what I
  should say to her, and what she would reply; but now that it had actually
  come to pass my ideas had flown, and speech had deserted me.</p>

  <p>She paused when we reached the street, and so did I, embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Shall I look for your carriage, Mrs. Hathern?" I stammered, glancing down
  the line of vehicles; but she laughed a little, and then grew suddenly
  grave.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have not heard that my husband is dead?" she said softly. "He
  died nearly two years ago, and I can scarcely afford a carriage now," she
  added, with a broken little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" I echoed, and stood on the pavement by her side speechless, while
  the vague possibilities called up by that word rushed into my brain, and a
  sudden thought made my heart beat wildly. "Margaret!" and, seizing her hand,
  I gazed down into her face, unable to say more. She was blushing, but looked
  up for a moment; and when her eyes met mine I knew that my years of probation
  were over, and that my happiness had come at last.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, seated by her side in her humble lodgings, I heard of
  her husband's bankruptcy and death; and how since then she had had a hard
  fight with poverty, as, indeed, her surroundings showed me. The thousand
  pounds which Messrs. Coles &amp; Green had handed to her from me had been a
  godsend, for it had enabled her to pay all her own bills, and had kept her in
  London until she had been able to find a little work to do. And then she told
  me, laughing through her tears, how she had heard of my dicture, and had
  determined to go and see it, although shillings were scarce with her; and
  what came of her going we know.</p>

  <p>Very soon we were married. Lizzie's husband performed the ceremony, and
  Lizzie, now a happy mother, was present. Then we left England for a while,
  visiting many places which Margaret had long wished to see; and on our return
  we finished our honeymoon at Cromer, and I think we enjoyed that last
  fortnight as well as any part of it. We seldom miss visiting it now every
  summer; and although we&mdash;Margaret and I&mdash;are growing older, and our
  children are beginning to rebel, and hint at the superior attractions of the
  Continent, I don't think that she and I will ever tire of it, any more than
  we could tire of one another.</p>

  <p class="first">Calcutta, <i>November</i> 13.&mdash;I have had an adventure
  to-day. I was riding back here from Tom Sadler's place, where a few of us
  have been stopping since last Thursday, when I came upon a young lady in
  distress. She had been trying to ford a swollen stream, and her mare, a
  leggy, narrow-chested brute, had pretty nearly come to grief. It was a close
  thing, and no mistake. They'd have been down the stream anyhow in another
  minute, and I doubt if the great brute wouldn't have dragged her under even
  if she had been able to swim. Of course I managed to pull her out, and found
  her not much the worse for her ducking. I took her home, as she really wasn't
  fit to go alone, but I'm thankful to say that I escaped the parental
  blessing. The old gentleman&mdash;he's a tea-planter&mdash;was out, and I
  pleaded regimental duties as an excuse for hurrying off. Promised to call
  first opportunity.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 20.&mdash;I can't get that girl's face out of my mind. I
  don't know that I ever saw a more lovely one. Strange thing for me to do, but
  I've actually dreamt of her three nights following. What an absurdity!</p>

  <p><i>December</i> 10.&mdash;I wish here most distinctly to affirm that I am
  not a superstitious man. This is a land of weird and fanciful beliefs, but I
  have always prided myself upon my sound common sense. If anything, I am a
  little too much inclined to absolute materialism, and yet what I now set down
  I believe to be the sober truth. I have seen a ghost. Three times during the
  middle of the night last week I have seen a woman in my room, standing just
  inside the door, with her hands stretched out appealingly towards me, and her
  face was the face of the girl whom I dragged out of the water near Tom
  Sadler's place scarcely a month ago. God grant that I may not see it
  again.</p>

  <p><i>June</i> 13.&mdash;As long as I live this day, or rather last night,
  will dwell in my mind. What have I done that I should be thus tormented? My
  nerves are completely shattered, and every one tells me that I look like a
  ghost. Again last night, it, or she, came, and as I sat up in bed I saw her
  scarcely a yard away, and her hands, which she held out as before, were red
  with blood. I saw it dripping slowly on to the floor, and I saw her look of
  horror as she drew back and pointed to the stain. Then I jumped out of bed,
  but she vanished with a last imploring gesture, and there was no stain on the
  mats. Another night like last night, and the fever will have me.</p>

  <p><i>June</i> 13.&mdash;Thank God I have seen no more of it. 'This afternoon
  I am going up country to seek her at the house. I doubt whether I shall find
  her alive.</p>

  <p><i>June</i> 20.&mdash;Just returned. I found the house shut up, and learnt
  that the late proprietor had died five months ago, and that his daughter had
  gone to Europe. I scarcely know whether I dread or long most to see her
  again.</p>

  <p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;The mail has brought me strange news. My uncle and
  cousin have died suddenly, and I am Sir Reginald Shagshaft of Shagshaft
  Castle, Northumberland, and owner of more thousands a year than I have ever
  had hundreds. Good-bye to India, and the army! I sail for England in a
  week.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 20.&mdash;I am at Shagshaft Castle, and a grand old place
  it is, but terribly desolate. It is built on the summit of a cliff, and a
  couple of hundred feet below as wild-looking a grey sea as ever I saw in my
  life thunders in upon a rocky storm-bound coast. When I have set things a
  little in order, I shall go to Paris for a while. The screech of the sea
  gulls alone is enough to give one the horrors, and in all this great place
  there are only three servants, for not a girl in all the country side will
  come here because of the ghost, which is said to inhabit the western wing and
  to walk in the black copse. Mrs. Cross, the housekeeper, seems a decent sort
  of person, but she firmly believes in the ghost, and came to me yesterday
  with tears in her eyes imploring me not to intrude upon its haunts. I ought
  to have humoured her a little, I think; for when I told her that I should
  make a point of finding out all about this ghost with a view to evicting it,
  and that I should fill the place with London servants, she turned as pale as
  a sheet, and very nearly went into hysterics. I have always heard that
  north-country people are superstitious.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 21.&mdash;I can't understand Mrs. Cross at all. To-day she
  would persist in telling me the story of a terrible tragedy which took place
  near here a few months ago&mdash;a man murdered by a girl&mdash;and insisted
  upon my giving my opinion about it. I said that if the story she told was
  true, it served the man right&mdash;and so it did. She seemed unaccountably
  pleased at my answer.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 22.-I walked in the black copse to-night, but saw nothing
  of the ghost. I shall leave here in a week.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 23.&mdash;A touch of my old madness has returned. Unless
  my eyes can lie I have seen this ghost. I was in the garden last night, and
  distinctly saw a white figure move along the battlements of the western tower
  and disappear. It was the figure of a woman, and, strange though it may
  appear, it seemed somehow familiar to me.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 24.&mdash;Again I have seen the ghost. As I live I will
  find out what this means. I have not worn the V.C. for nothing, and no one
  has ever called Colonel Shagshaft a coward. I will stand face to face with
  this tormenting shadow, and with my own hands will find out whether or no my
  senses are mocking me.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 25.&mdash;To-night I stood on the battlements of the
  western wing and waited, with my sword in my hand, for well-nigh three hours.
  It never came. When I descended, I found Mrs. Cross in a fit. It seems
  strange that she should be so anxious. She feared for my safety, she declared
  trembling; and if anything happened to me, strangers would come to the old
  place. For I am the last of the Shagshafts of Shagshaft.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 26.&mdash;This morning I asked Mrs. Cross for an old
  manuscript copy of the history of Shagshaft Castle, as I fancied that I had
  heard something about a secret room in the western wing.</p>

  <p>What a nervous woman she is! I had scarcely got the words out before she
  fainted. There is something all about this which I cannot understand. When
  she came to, she declared solemnly that she had never heard of such a book.
  This must be false, for I have often been told about it; anyhow, I was only
  the more determined to thoroughly explore the western wing, so I commenced at
  once. On the topmost storey, starting from the centre tower, and going to the
  right, I counted thirteen rooms, all large, empty, and in a neglected state.
  When I reached the furthermost, I turned round with a start to find Mrs.
  Cross just behind me. At the sight of her my suspicions were at once
  thoroughly aroused.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Cross," I said quietly, "I am quite aware that I am getting warm; in
  other words, that I shall unearth this precious ghost in something less than
  five minutes. Now let me tell you this," I continued, drawing a small pocket
  revolver: "I am going to put an end to this confounded masquerading once and
  for all."</p>

  <p>She drew close to him.</p>

  <p>"You have found the book!" she gasped. "You know about the secret
  chamber!"</p>

  <p>"Precisely!" I answered. "And it will go ill with its tenant."</p>

  <p>Then she fell on her knees before me.</p>

  <p>"For the love of God don't hurt her, Sir Reginald," she moaned. "Doan't 'e
  give her up; so young as she is and so beautiful, and so innocent like. She'd
  never 'a hurt a hair of old Roger Martin's head if he hadn't offered her an
  insult worse nor death; and she ne'er meant to kill him. He tried to take the
  gun frae 'er, and it went off. What could 'a do when she came to me for help
  but hide her. Oh, Sir Reginald! you're the last Shagshaft o' Shagshaft, but,
  afore God, I'll curse 'ee if 'ee hurt her, or give her up to the law."</p>

  <p>"Stand up, woman, and tell me whom you have been hiding," I cried.</p>

  <p>She trembled all over.</p>

  <p>"Her as killed old Roger Martin, the wickedest man in all the country
  side. Her father left her to his care. Little he could 'a knowed what sort of
  a man he was; and she came from India here last April&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Down fell the revolver from my nerveless fingers, and I bent eagerly
  forward.</p>

  <p>"The date! What was the day of the month when she&mdash;she did this
  deed?"</p>

  <p>"It wur the night o' the eleventh o' June &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped short. My eyes followed hers, and standing in an aperture of
  the wall at the other end of the room, her arms stretched out appealingly to
  me, was the figure of a young girl. I knew her at once, and a cold shiver
  went through me. I had seen her before in her drenched riding-hood on the
  banks of tile Ghooly stream, and I had seen her, too, in this same posture by
  my bedside at the barracks in Calcutta. And yet on that same night she had
  been many thousand miles away. My eyes remained fixed upon
  her&mdash;fascinated. No longer could I call myself a brave man, for I was
  trembling.</p>

  <p>"Sir Reginald Shagshaft, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped short and put her hand to her forehead. Then she moved swiftly
  into the room and threw herself on her knees before me.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is you," she cried joyfully; "you, who saved me from drowning in
  the Ghooly river You will not give me up? You will let me stay here? Before
  God, I swear to you that I never meant to hurt him."</p>

  <p>Her voice failed her, and her lithe, supple frame was convulsed with sobs.
  I spoke as one in a dream.</p>

  <p>"I will not give you up or turn you away," I promised. "I will come to you
  to-morrow, and you shall tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Then I staggered out of the room like a drunken man, and left them weeping
  for joy.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 27.&mdash;Most of the day I have spent with Maud Moray,
  and I have heard her story. Her father had died suddenly and had left her to
  the guardianship of an old Northumbrian squire, a distant relative, whom he
  had never seen. She had come over to England, and had found that her new home
  was a tumble-down farmhouse on a wild, desolate moor, and that her guardian
  was a man of evil repute&mdash;a drunkard, and worse. She was only two miles
  away from Shagshaft Castle, and she had often visited it, and, by her
  wondering praise of its grandeur and antiquity, had first won Mrs. Cross's
  heart. Then had come a terrible night when, flushed with drink, old Roger
  Martin had been sent to his doom by a desperate girl. I pass over her hasty,
  reluctant description of that awful scene. In her horror at what she had done
  her first instinct had been to fly, and she had found her way by the pale
  light of the moon across the bleak moor to Shagshaft Castle. She had lain
  hidden in the black copse, where none dare venture after nightfall, until
  morning, and then she had crept into Mrs. Cross's room and told her terrible
  tale. What could Mrs. Cross do but promise to try and hide her? Roger Martin
  had been her sworn enemy, and the news of his death was a joy to her. There
  and then she had promised to do her best to shield this unhappy girl from the
  consequences of her rash deed. There was a part of the Castle which neither
  man nor woman for many miles round dare visit, for, from time immemorial, it
  has been steadfastly believed to be haunted by the ghost of a former lady of
  Shagshaft. And so she had unlocked the secret chamber which none save she
  knew of, and Maud Moray had taken up her abode there. To increase the awe
  with which that part of the Castle was already looked upon by the rustics,
  she had now and then walked on the battlements at night clad in a white gown.
  So well had she succeeded that one by one the servants had fled away, and had
  left Mrs. Cross almost alone. Then had come the news of my unexpected
  arrival&mdash;I had not written until I arrived in England&mdash;and for a
  while their anxiety had been intense. I shall never forget how Mrs. Cross
  sobbed for joy when I gave that hasty promise or how beautiful she looked on
  her knees before me, with her golden hair streaming down her back, and her
  great blue eyes fixed upon mine, full of passionate entreaty. Justice or no
  justice, no man shall lay a hand upon her in my house.</p>

  <p><i>November</i> 28.&mdash;Mine is a terrible position. I am an officer in
  the service of the Queen, and I am wilfully harbouring a criminal. I learnt
  to-day that there is a warrant out for her arrest, and the whole country is
  being scoured for her. I defy them to find her here. Still I am nervous, and
  live in perpetual dread. Most of the day I have spent with her. She is very
  beautiful.</p>

  <p><i>December</i> 2.-I was never a fatalist, but every idea of mine is
  unhinged by the strange thing which has happened to me. It seems almost as if
  some invisible hand had drawn us together. I give up fighting against it. I
  confess that I am madly in love with Maud Moray. Death alone shall part us; I
  have sworn it.</p>

  <p><i>December</i> 3.&mdash;Another day of wild delirious happiness. She has
  confessed that she loves me. I have given up fighting against fate. Were she
  the blackest-hearted of women, instead of a pure innocent girl driven to
  defend her honour by desperate means, she should still be mine. We will go
  away together, to some far country, where she will be safe, and we can live
  in peace. For her sake I will welcome exile for ever from England and
  home.</p>

  <p><i>December</i> 12.&mdash;I have made plans. There is a steamer starts
  from Liverpool for Buenos Ayres in a month's time. We will go by it. Maud is
  willing and anxious to escape from her confinement. We can be married on
  board. Our chief difficulty will be in getting Maud away from this place.</p>

  <p><i>December</i> 20.&mdash;We have made arrangements about getting Maud
  away. Mrs. Cross has a niece about her height and complexion, whom she is to
  invite to stop here for a few days. Then Maud is to wear her clothes and
  leave in her stead. At Atwick I shall join her, and we shall go straight to
  Liverpool. God grant that there may be no slip! How I long for freedom, and
  to escape from this constant anxiety!</p>

  <p><i>December</i> 25.&mdash;It is Christmas Day, and our last day here. Mrs.
  Cross's niece has arrived. Except that she is not one-tenth part as
  beautiful, she is not unlike Maud. All our arrangements are made. Nothing can
  go wrong; and yet I feel strangely depressed and nervous. The slightest noise
  makes me start. My heart seems dragged down as though by a weight of lead,
  and my blood is like ice. I have been drinking wine, but it does me no good.
  It seems to freeze within me, and I am cold. It must be this cursed damp
  room. 'Twould hold an army, and the table at which I dine would seat two
  hundred. This place is too big: it oppresses me. Good God I...</p>

  <p>I must be ill. I could have sworn that it was she who came out of the
  shadows there, with her arms outstretched, just as I saw her in my room at
  Calcutta. What a superstitious fool I am! Can it be that the twilight is ma
  king a coward of me? It looks like it, for my limbs are trembling, and the
  cold sweat is running down my forehead. I must have some wine.</p>

  <p>Now, I feel better. How strange it seems that in this great place she and
  I are alone! Mrs. Cross and her niece have gone down to the village, and the
  last of the remaining servants left us yesterday. "She couldn't spend
  Christmas day in a haunted house," she said. How the wind is howling through
  those pine trees in the black copse This is certainly the weirdest and the
  dreariest place I was ever in. One can imagine the people being
  superstitious. The moaning of the sea on the beach below is enough to give
  one the melancholies. I feel drowsy. I...</p>

  <p>I have had a sleep and again the nightmare. I fancied that I heard her
  calling to me to save her. It must have been the sighing of the wind in the
  black copse. My God! What a blaze of light! Can it be daytime? Dark figures
  on the lawn! My God! What is this?...</p>

  <p>[END OF DIARY.]</p>

  <p>Fire at Shagshaft Castle! and such a fire Sheets of flame, leaping and
  curling round the grand old towers and blackened walls, shooting torrents of
  sparks high up into the air, bending low before the wild gusts of the
  storm-wind which urged it forward, and casting a red, hellish glare far out
  into the sea below, and high up into the heavens above. Never have the little
  knot of villagers, who are clustering together upon the lawn, seen or
  imagined anything so wildly, so fearfully grand. And from that fast grim pile
  of buildings there comes no sound or sign of life. Almost it seems that those
  within are sleeping the sleep of the dead.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a window on the ground floor is thrown open with a crash, and a
  tall, military-looking man, with a note book in his hand, leaps out on to the
  lawn. He stares for a moment aghast, petrified, at the burning pile. Before
  he can speak or move, there is a low shuddering murmur from those around him,
  and all eyes are riveted upon the western wing.</p>

  <p>"The ghost! The ghost!"</p>

  <p>High up on the battlements of the doomed castle, her figure standing out
  with startling distinctness against the glowing background, a woman, in a
  long white robe, is standing. The flames, which bend and roll towards her, do
  her one good service; every one can see her desperate strait. They can see
  her fair hair streaming in the wind, her white arms stretched imploringly out
  towards one figure on the lawn, and can almost see her lips part in an
  agonized appeal.</p>

  <p>He sees it all, and, with a wild cry which rises high above the roaring
  and crashing of the fire, he dashes through the smoke into the burning
  building. Some try to follow him, and some run for ladders; but all in vain.
  None other save he dare face the sheets of flame, nor will all the rapidly
  procured ladders reach half way to those frowning battlements, and so they
  wait in a breathless silence&mdash;thrilled, but helpless.</p>

  <p>Minutes pass, and the flames are rapidly nearing the woman, who stands
  there motionless, like a Grecian statue. Then there is a wild shout as the
  blackened figure of a man leaps on to the roof by her side. She welcomes him
  with a great cry of joy, and for a moment they disappear, but only to return
  again. Their retreat has been cut off. They are doomed. They stand there,
  against the lurid sky, clasped in one another's arms&mdash;hero and heroine,
  facing death together as they could never have faced it apart. And on the
  lawn below the women are swooning and strong men fall sobbing to the ground
  that their fascinated eyes may not rest upon the awful sight.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>One man alone had nerve enough to look upon it, and, with bated breath, he
  is often called upon to tell the tale. So often, that in that dreary
  Northumbrian village there is not a man, woman, or child who does not know by
  heart the story of how the last Lord of Shagshaft died like a hero amongst
  the ruins of his castle, with the beautiful Shagshaft ghost, for whom he had
  given his life, clasped in his arms.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>3.&mdash;BY LUCK AND A TRICK</h2>

  <p class="first">A dainty blue-eyed little woman was walking restlessly up
  and down over the thick carpet and amongst the miniature fauteuils and
  lounges of one of the prettiest morning-rooms in London. The door, as if by
  design, was standing an inch or two open, and each time as she reached it she
  bent forward her little head, coroneted with a wavy mass of half-golden,
  half-auburn hair, and listened intently for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>She was certainly a very impatient young lady, for though she had been
  here alone for barely a quarter of an hour, her piquant face had already
  commenced to wear a most unbecoming expression of vexed anxiety. Her book and
  fancy-work had long since slipped on to the carpet, and by degrees her
  periods of listening at the door grew more frequent and prolonged. At last
  the sound for which she listened reached her ears. She stepped back into the
  room and drew a long breath, as if of apprehension. In a very short time a
  tall, fair young man, with a most woebegone countenance and altogether
  dejected appearance, pushed open the door and stood on the rug without
  entering.</p>

  <p>"It's all up!" he said, in a tone which exactly matched his downcast
  looks. "I don't know what'll become of me now, and I don't much care. I'm not
  to see you again, you'll be pleased to hear."</p>

  <p>She laughed cheerfully. It sounded a little forced, but it was very
  brave.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense, Geoff! Come in and tell me all about it at once,"
  she commanded.</p>

  <p>Her cousin looked doubtfully up the broad stairs, down which he had just
  descended.</p>

  <p>"The governor will be down in a minute to see if I have cleared off the
  premises," he said bitterly. "There'll be no end of a row if he finds me here
  with you. I think I'd better go."</p>

  <p>Perhaps if she had been a very astute young lady she would have discovered
  from his tone that he had no intention of doing anything of the sort. But she
  was not; or, if she was, her present anxiety had clouded her wits; and, in
  her fear lest he should act upon his words, she pulled him gently into the
  room and shut the door, which was exactly what he desired.</p>

  <p>"You booby! You haven't promised not to speak to me, have you? Sit down
  there, and tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Of course he obeyed his pretty cousin's commands. When had he ever done
  otherwise since the days of their babyhood? at which period her rule had been
  even more rigid and his servitude more complete than now. He flung himself
  into an easy chair and assumed a most lugubrious expression.</p>

  <p>"You're not to pull a long face like that, please, Geoff," she exclaimed,
  drawing a footstool up to the side of his chair and looking very demure.
  "Now, just begin at the beginning, and go right on. Tell me what you said,
  and what he said, and all the rest of it. I expect you must have bungled
  frightfully."</p>

  <p>"I expect I did," he assented disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"Well, here goes. He didn't seem particularly pleased to see me when James
  showed me in&mdash;just shook hands and never asked me to sit down. Of course
  I did; and, to make matters worse, plumped down on that inf&mdash;&mdash;
  beastly little dog he's always got hanging about him. What are you laughing
  at, Jennie? It was no joke, I can tell you!"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose it was&mdash;for poor Tony. Go on, please."</p>

  <p>He let his hand rest for a moment on her head, and commenced stroking her
  hair, as if he found that rather more entertaining than recapitulating his
  recent interview with her father. Presently he drew his hand away with a
  sigh, and continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well, that made him awfully savage. 'Well, sir, and what do you want?' he
  said. I thought I might as well go straight at it, so I said that I wanted
  you. 'What!' he shouted. I repeated that I had come to ask his consent to our
  engagement; and I was just going to try and explain to him how awfully fond
  we were of one another, and all that, you know, when he stopped me, and began
  lecturing away until I thought that I should faint. He wanted to know what my
  income was, as if he didn't know that I have only that three hundred a year
  old Howard left me, besides my pay. 'And I suppose that just keeps you in
  hansoms and cigars?' he said sneeringly. I told him that of course one
  couldn't expect it to do much more; and that seemed to make him worse than
  ever. I don't know why, I'm sure. He fumed about for a minute or two, and
  said all manner of ridiculous things, and then he suddenly cooled down. 'Look
  here, Geoffrey,' he said. 'I'm not particularly anxious that my daughter
  should marry a rich man'&mdash;('Lucky for me,' I thought)&mdash;'but I won't
  have her marry a spendthrift.' Of course I was going to interrupt him there,
  but he wouldn't let me. Then he went on to make remarks about those few
  paltry flowers I've sent you, and the number of horses I keep&mdash;as if a
  fellow wasn't bound to keep a decent animal or two&mdash;and about that share
  in Dermi's moor. Well, I couldn't have got out of that, as I tried to explain
  to him, but he wouldn't listen; in short, he read me a tremendous lecture.
  Then he was good enough to say that I had some good points, and of course he
  didn't forget that I was his nephew, and all that; but he wound up at last by
  saying that he would not have his daughter marry a selfish and extravagant
  man. I must be selfish, he said, because I was extravagant. Ridiculous, isn't
  it? You don't think I'm selfish, do you, Jennie?"</p>

  <p>"You know I don't, Geoff," she exclaimed energetically. "But go on. Did he
  give you no hope at all?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. He wanted to know whether I was in debt. Of course I'm in debt.
  I never remember being out of it since the governor lost the Langton estates,
  and had to cut off my allowance. But, as it happens, I never was so nearly
  clear as I am now."</p>

  <p>"How's that, Geoff? I don't believe that you have been economizing, for
  you only bought that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Jennie, I haven't been economizing. I can't lay claim to so much
  virtue," he confessed with a short laugh. "You won't think any the better of
  me, I'm afraid, when I tell you that Sandown and the Oaks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that horrid betting! But please finish telling me what papa said.</p>

  <p>"Well, when he asked me whether I was in debt, I said I wasn't quite sure
  how I stood. No more I am, you know. I believe he thought that I was
  humbugging him then, for he looked awfully savage. 'Well, look here,
  Geoffrey,' he said, I don't mind my daughter marrying a poor man, but I won't
  let her marry a man with a cart-load of debts round his neck. If you can come
  to me in a week's time and tell me that you don't owe a penny, if you haven't
  a hundred pounds in the world, you shall have Jennie; but not unless.' He
  wouldn't let me say another word, and he wouldn't say another word himself;
  so I had to come away."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you get the money from those horrid Jews? It would be the last
  time, you know!"</p>

  <p>"You little goose," he said, smiling dolefully, "shouldn't I owe it all
  the same? There's only one person in the world whom I could ask to give me
  money&mdash;the governor, of course; and I don't believe he would or could
  raise a quarter of what I want to save his life. Anyhow, I couldn't even ask
  him, unless I promised in some way or other to pay him back; and I mustn't do
  that, or else it would be a loan. I'm afraid it's a hopeless case, Jennie,
  unless that obdurate parent of yours changes his mind. Now, you silly little
  woman, what good will crying do? Leave off, please, come; let me wipe your
  eyes for you."</p>

  <p>"Geoff, don't be stupid. I'm not crying; but it does seem very, very
  horrid, and&mdash;and I can't help thinking that you oughtn't to have been
  quite so extravagant. Do you owe very much money?" she asked pitifully.</p>

  <p>He stroked his long mustaches, and looked down at her disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's a goodish bit," he acknowledged. "I'll tell you what I'll
  do, though," he added suddenly; "I'll go into my accounts and find out. Can I
  see you to-morrow anywhere?"</p>

  <p>A knock at the door, and a servant announced that his Master would be glad
  to see Miss Jeanette at once. She sprang up hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"I must go, Geoff! I shall be at the Turners' all to-morrow afternoon.
  Couldn't you call?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can. I'll be there to lunch, and tell you all about it.
  Good-bye, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Geoff, don't, you silly boy! My hair isn't fit to be seen already. There!
  there's just one kiss for you, and now you really must go;" and, laughing,
  she pushed him out of the room and made her own escape.</p>

  <p>The creditors of Mr. Geoffrey Chester (and they were many) were
  considerably surprised that afternoon by a peremptory request from their
  distinguished client that their accounts should be made up forthwith and sent
  in to him. There was a good deal of speculation amongst them as to the reason
  for this unusual request. Mortnum &amp; Fason's head clerk was afraid that it
  meant bankruptcy; but Mr. Curshore, the celebrated Bond Street tailor,
  scented a wedding, and made out his little account with alacrity. Mr. Fogg,
  the horse-dealer, "ad 'eard as the 17th was down for furrin parts;" while Mr.
  Abraham Moses, to whom a little interest was due, shook his head, and
  prophesied a hoax. With all their diverse opinions, however, they one and all
  did as desired, and accordingly, when Geoffrey Chester sat down to breakfast
  on the following morning, he found a very formidable pile of blue letters
  surmounting his <i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

  <p>"Shall I bring in the waste basket, sir?" his servant inquired, with just
  the suspicion of a grin upon his smooth features.</p>

  <p>He felt a momentary temptation to say "Yes," the blue envelopes looked so
  decidedly uninviting, and it seemed so useless to wade through them. He
  didn't, though. He thought of Jennie, and answered almost
  apologetically&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Not this morning, Burditt. I&mdash;I'm going to look through them."</p>

  <p>The man bowed discreetly and withdrew. It was very dear, he confided to
  the groom, who was waiting below, that one of two things was going to happen:
  either their master was going to marry or he was going through the Bankruptcy
  Court; else why was he going to open those bills? This was an argument which
  Dick acknowledged to be quite unanswerable; and, being a young man of a
  cheerful frame of mind, he brought forward evidence in favour of the first
  proposition. Burditt, on the contrary, being a decided pessimist, adopted the
  latter view, and talked darkly of the Bankruptcy Court and the Board of
  Trade, of Boulogne lodgings and suicide, until the protesting words died away
  on Dick's lips, and he began to feel, as he afterwards acknowledged, "mortal
  uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Captain Chester, in happy ignorance of these dreary
  prognostications, was carefully entering in a small memorandum-book the
  amount at the foot of each document. Then he turned to another part of the
  book, and from a page headed "Bills" took sundry other amounts. Having added
  them up, his task was concluded. He owed in round figures a little over six
  thousand pounds, and all he had towards it was a cheque for two thousand
  guineas, the proceeds of his recent lucky speculations at Sandown. The case
  was hopeless. Without borrowing or selling his commission (that also Mr.
  Durban had barred), how was he to become possessed of four thousand pounds?
  His father was struggling with a heavily encumbered estate, and every day he
  expected a summons home to sign away the entail. To him he could not, of
  course, apply; and, save Mr. Durban, he had no other near relative. If ever a
  man cursed his poverty, Geoffrey Chester did as he flung the memorandum-book
  into a corner, and, catching up his hat, hurried out, he cared very little
  whither.</p>

  <p>There had been a little note from his cousin, almost lost amongst the
  ponderous heap of businesslike epistles, postponing their meeting until
  tomorrow; so he went to the club to lunch. Afterwards, as he sauntered into
  the news-room, he was conscious of some great sensation amongst the men
  present; every one was crowding round a telegram which had just arrived, and
  there was a pretty general air of astonishment and dismay.</p>

  <p>"Anything up?" he inquired laconically. It would take a good deal, he
  thought, to interest him just then. A little fair man looked round, and
  recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! here's Chester! Heard the news?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Just been asking what it was," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, what do you think's won the Leicestershire?"</p>

  <p>"I Haven't the least idea&mdash;Kinsky, I should think."</p>

  <p>"The Monk!"</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>It takes a good deal to upset the equanimity of a captain of Dragoons; but
  Captain Chester felt for just one moment as though he were going to
  faint.</p>

  <p>"Hit hard?" inquired his friend, compassionately. "We all are."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've won two thousand pounds," he said shortly, as he turned on his heel
  and walked away, amidst a general chorus of "Lucky devil!"</p>

  <p>He went into one of the smaller rooms and sat down. It seemed almost past
  credence. The Monk, a horse which he had backed out of pure bravado at a
  hundred to one, and which had since been reported to have gone dead lame, to
  have won a race like this! If only he could raise two thousand pounds
  now!</p>

  <p>He walked down the corridor, and in the entrance-hall ran against the man
  whom he most wished to see.</p>

  <p>"Well, hang it all, Chester, talk about luck!" exclaimed the new-comer.
  "Do you know you've won two thousand pounds from me?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was not likely to forget it.</p>

  <p>"You can afford it, Darton," he said, smiling; "and, by-the-by, it's just
  likely I may want a little cash this week. I know settling day
  isn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, not another word," said Lord Darton good-humouredly. "I
  was hard up myself once, you know. Come into the waiting-room, and I'll write
  you a cheque."</p>

  <p>There were more surprises in store for Geoffrey Chester that day. When he
  returned to his chambers to dress for an evening engagement, he found his
  solicitor seated in his easy chair, waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Captain Chester, you're a very lucky man," he exclaimed, as they shook
  hands. "I have a very pleasant surprise for you."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey threw himself into a chair and stared at the lawyer. He was quite
  sure that there was no one who could have died and left him money, and he
  knew very well that this news could not be about the Monk, for Mr. Scales was
  not likely to know one horse's name from another.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad to hear it," he said. "Let's hear all about it."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. You once had in your employ a servant named Thomas Gretton.
  Ah! I see you remember the name. He was a clever fellow, but he used to bet,
  and of course he lost. To meet his engagements he forged your name to a bill
  for five hundred and fifty pounds. You found it out; and by some means the
  fellow worked upon your generosity to such an extent that you not only took
  up the bill, but started him off to Australia. As it happened you did just
  about the best thing you possibly could have done. By this morning's post I
  received a letter from Gretton, and an order for the amount of the bill and
  interest, amounting altogether to six hundred and twenty pounds one shilling
  and eightpence, with instructions to place the same to the credit of your
  account. Here's the order, and I shall be glad 'if you'll give me a receipt
  at once, as I'm rather in a hurry. Thanks."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Dick was summoned into his master's room.</p>

  <p>"Dick, I want you to take all the animals except Ironsides to Tattersall's
  to-morrow morning in time for the sale. You understand?"</p>

  <p>Dick sorrowfully assented.</p>

  <p>"And me, sir&mdash;am I to go, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Go! Go where?"</p>

  <p>"I thought that you may be a-wanting me to leave, sir, as you was selling
  the animals."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! I wouldn't part with you for the world, Dick," exclaimed his
  master, with a pleasant smile. "There'll be plenty more horses for you
  soon."</p>

  <p>Dick departed to confide to Burditt that there was "summut more in the
  wind than they knowed of," as indeed there was.</p>

  <p>The next day Geoffrey and his cousin met as arranged. This time the
  positions were reversed. It was she who was pale and despondent, while he
  looked happy and sanguine. Her father had quite made up his mind that
  Geoffrey was over head and ears in debt, and that he would not have him for a
  son-in-law. "She had never known him so determined about anything, she told
  him piteously, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey laughed, and stopped her mouth.</p>

  <p>"No treason, Jennie. Listen to my news;" and he told her about the Monk
  and the bank order from Gretton. She listened with sparkling eyes, and
  presently began to share his hopefulness. Soon other callers arrived,
  however, and their <i>tête-á-tête</i> had to be abandoned. It was to be
  renewed, however, on the morrow at the house of another mutual friend.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey Chester was known to ride good horses, and his little stud
  fetched high prices. Still, the proceeds did not come anywhere near fourteen
  hundred pounds; and even when his dog-cart and phaeton had followed he was
  still eight hundred pounds short. A few odds and ends of jewellery brought
  him in two hundred, and he contrived to scrape up a hundred pounds cash. But
  two more days passed, and nothing fresh had turned up. To raise five hundred
  pounds without borrowing, and having nothing to sell, is by no means an easy
  task. It seemed to Geoffrey that he had come to the end of his resources, and
  that he might as well be five thousand pounds short as five hundred. And yet
  to fail now would be maddening. He dared not contemplate such a contingency,
  and yet he hinted at it pretty plainly to his cousin that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he said, "if your father knows that I owe only five hundred
  pounds, he won't be so cruel as to refuse?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head fearfully.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what papa is, Geoffrey. He's so obstinate, and always
  keeps to what he says. Besides, he says it's the principle, and&mdash;and all
  manner of horrid things. You must get that five hundred pounds somehow."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I've told myself so a thousand times," he said ruefully, "but
  I'm no nearer getting it."</p>

  <p>They were both thoughtful for a while. It was she who broke the
  silence.</p>

  <p>"You know, Geoff," she said slowly, "I haven't much jewellery, but I have
  one diamond necklace which is worth ten times as much as we want. But then,
  papa made me promise only the other night that I wouldn't part with it, or
  anything, else."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, that's no good, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know. Look here, Geoff, I've got an idea. I'm afraid it
  isn't right, but&mdash;but listen&mdash;" And she told it him.</p>

  <p>He ridiculed, wondered at, and finally applauded it. A little more
  discussion and they adopted it, subject to the consent of a third party. The
  third party consented at once to play his part, and so it was arranged.</p>

  <p>That evening Mr. Durban took his daughter to Drury Lane. After the
  performance they had a little way to walk to their carriage, and if Mr.
  Durban had not been so very short-sighted, he might have noticed a not
  unfamiliar face&mdash;the face of his nephew's manservant&mdash;very close to
  them several times in the crush, and he might also have observed that his
  daughter's hands seemed busy unfastening something under her opera cloak.
  What he did notice just as they reached home was that his daughter's necklace
  was gone.</p>

  <p>"Jennie, where's your necklace?" he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

  <p>She put her hand to her throat and started. "Papa, it's gone! I must have
  lost it in the crush! What are we to do?"</p>

  <p>They drove back to the theatre, but in vain; they searched the carriage,
  but in vain; and finally drove to Scotland Yard. By ten o'clock next morning
  there were bills out offering five hundred pounds reward for the finder of a
  diamond necklace, description given; and by midday notes for that amount had
  found their way into Geoffrey Chester's hands, and Jennie was rejoicing over
  the return of her necklace. When Mr. Durban returned from the city that
  evening, he found his nephew awaiting him. Geoffrey was prompt to explain his
  presence.</p>

  <p>"You promised me Jennie, sir, if I could tell you that I was free from
  debt, and, on my honour, I am."</p>

  <p>"And you've not sold your commission?" Mr. Durban asked somewhat
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, sir."</p>

  <p>"Humph. Very well, then; I'm a man of my word. Jennie's in the
  drawing-room and dinner will be ready in twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>Exit Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Five years afterwards they told him all about that last five hundred
  pounds. It is his favourite after-dinner story now; and Burditt has very good
  reason to consider that evening which he spent hanging about outside Drury
  Lane Theatre the most fortunate evening of his life. He is quite the head of
  the household at Chester Court; and Mr. Durban, a frequent visitor there,
  never departs without alluding to that little circumstance in a gratifying
  and stolid manner. He was cheated out of his daughter, he declares; and
  Geoffrey acknowledges that he only won his wife by luck and a trick&mdash;his
  luck and her trick. But they all seem very happy about it; and amongst the
  penates at Chester-Court are a handbill, a reward of five hundred pounds for
  a certain diamond necklace, a soiled yellow letter signed "Thomas Gretton,"
  and an engraving of "The Monk."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>4.&mdash;CULBONE TOWER</h2>

  <p class="first">I have written the title of this, my true story, and my eyes
  have wandered for a moment to the mirror which hangs almost directly in front
  of me. Strange that I should find myself smiling when but a short while ago I
  had sat down to my task so full of seriousness and deliberation. Yet so it
  is. I am smiling, and I cannot help myself. Look with me into the mirror, and
  see whether you cannot also find cause for mirth in the incongruity between
  my appearance and the mighty subject of ghosts. What can a somewhat portly,
  good-humoured, and, my friends say, pleasant-looking woman, of little over
  forty years old, know about ghosts? There are no troubled lines in my face,
  no nerveless glitter in my eyes, or look of apprehension lurking about my
  countenance; I am altogether an unromantic looking personage, devoid of
  superstition, lacking in imaginative power, and possessed of a very fair
  supply of common-sense. And yet I alone amongst the living can tell the true
  story of the Ghost of Culbone Tower.</p>

  <p>To do so I must go back to the days of my earliest childhood. I was born
  not many miles from Lynton, on the north coast of Devonshire, and I was an
  only child. Our home was a beautiful one&mdash;beautiful, indeed, seems a
  weak word. The house, perched on a narrow plateau of green turf, literally
  overhung the sea four hundred feet below, and above us a forest of pine trees
  stretched away precipitously to the head of the cliff. The only approach to
  it was by a steep winding path, dangerous after dark, and never safe for
  strangers, of whom, however, we saw none. The place is now a common resort of
  tourists; but in the days of my girlhood tourists were scarce; and if one
  did, by chance, present himself at the lodge gate, old Andrews knew better
  than to admit him. To have done so would have resulted in his instant
  dismissal.</p>

  <p>From the sea our dwelling-place must have seemed perfectly inaccessible,
  owing to the steepness of the cliff above, and the sheer descent. Many a time
  have I seen yachts brought in as near to the rock-strewn coast as the pilot
  would allow, that their owners or passengers might level their glasses with
  wonderment at our strangely situated abode. But I fancy that what most
  excited their wonderment was the curious little tower built on the summit of
  a huge boulder of bracken-covered rock, which seemed ever threatening to fall
  upon us and crush our frail tenement like a house of cards. Who built it, and
  wherefore, no one can tell. There were legends about it, of course, which, at
  a later period, were raked up and eagerly discussed by a terror-stricken
  community. But any authentic record as to its builder or its intended purpose
  was wanting. There it stood, like a Rhenish tower&mdash;massive, picturesque,
  of quaint foreign architecture, and, at the time when I best remember it, an
  object of ceaseless dread and terror to every member of our little household.
  Between it and the house yawned a cleft-like chasm, into the bottom of which,
  at high tide, the sea came curling in. At one time, before my recollection,
  there had been a hand-bridge across; and my father would often go and smoke
  there, and even persuade such of his friends that were sure-footed and free
  from dizziness to accompany him. But that was many years before I reached
  girlhood, and I never thought of it, or heard it mentioned, save with bated
  breath and shuddering awe.</p>

  <p>Well had it earned its evil reputation, for it had been the scene of the
  terrible tragedy which cast a deep gloom over my early life. My father had
  been one of three sons, who had lived with their widowed mother at a place
  called Munster Castle, on the borders of Exmoor, some ten miles inland. Of
  these three sons my father, Frank Catherall, had been the eldest. Next to him
  came Francis, and the name of the younger was Cecil. Like many other mothers,
  Mrs. Catherall leaned most to her youngest son, and failed altogether in
  concealing her preference. All three were strangely alike, in
  disposition&mdash;stern, and reserved, with hot, fierce tempers, but generous
  withal, and passionately devoted to their mother. My father married first,
  and came to live at Glencoombe, where I was born. My mother never got on very
  well with old Mrs. Catherall, but there was no actual unpleasantness, and I
  have faint recollections of some very early visits to Munster Castle. She, on
  her part, never returned these visits, but invariably excused herself on
  account of the peculiar situation of our house an excuse against which we
  could urge nothing, for certainly the descent to it was by no means a
  pleasant one for any one unaccustomed to the cliffs. Both my uncles were
  frequent visitors, however, and were welcomed warmly whenever they came. All
  three brothers seemed to be the closest of friends, and spent most of their
  time fishing, or shooting, or hunting together. They were popular in the
  neighbourhood, and were generally supposed to be as they appeared&mdash;on
  the best of terms.</p>

  <p>One November afternoon&mdash;how well I remember it!&mdash;they had all
  three gone out shooting over Dunkery Beacon. I was sitting at the window,
  wondering how long it would be before they returned, when suddenly the door
  opened, and my father entered the room. Directly I saw him I knew that
  something terrible had happened. His face, usually ruddy and sunburnt, was
  ghastly pale; and he tottered rather than walked into the room. I was curled
  up on the floor reading, but I sprang up at once and ran over to him. I cried
  out to know what had happened. "Don't ask me," he answered in a fearfully
  hollow voice; "don't ask me." He took me in his arms and kissed me a great
  number of times; and when he put me down, he said good-bye. I asked him where
  he was going, but, before he could answer, my mother, who had heard him in
  the hall, came down to know why he had returned so soon, and alone. He
  answered her never a word, but simply kissed her as he had been doing me,
  until she got frightened and began to cling to him and cry. Then he turned
  his head away with a great sob, and rushed out of the room without another
  word. I tried to follow, but he had locked the door. I heard him talking for
  a few moments with Perkins outside, and then he hurried out of the house. My
  mother was ringing the bell violently; but though the servants came to the
  door at once, they could not get us out, for my father had taken the key with
  him in his pocket. While they were trying some other keys, I remembered the
  side window, and running to it, jumped out upon the lawn. What I saw made me
  sink dumb and helpless to the ground. The cry which I tried to force out
  froze upon my lips, and my limbs refused their office. On the other side of
  the chasm, standing on a part of the smooth boulder where I had often heard
  him say that he would not trust himself for a thousand pounds, was my father,
  holding in his hand the little hand-bridge by which he had crossed, and which
  he seemed to have caught up, to prevent Perkins from following him. While I
  watched him he flung the frail piece of carpentry down into the chasm, and
  from side to side I heard it rumble and bump until, with a sickening crash,
  it reached the bottom, and struck against the jagged edge of a rock, when in
  half a dozen rapid strides my father reached the other side of the boulder;
  and it flashed upon me that he meant to cast himself into the sea. For a
  moment he straightened himself, and I saw his powerful, massive form standing
  out as it were against the sky, when throwing his arms over his head with a
  wild, despairing gesture, he crouched down for the spring. I fell on my face,
  faint and trembling; when I looked up again, roused by a horrified shout from
  Perkins, he was gone.</p>

  <p>After that I lost all consciousness, and for weeks I lay between life and
  death. When I slowly regained my senses, I found the one subject which I was
  burning yet dreading to hear about was denied me. No one would talk to me all
  about my father. No one would tell me why he had done that fearful deed. To
  mention the tower before any of the servants was sufficient to send them
  trembling from the room. My mother would faint if I even tried to talk about
  my unhappy father, and Perkins strenuously refused to come near me for fear
  of being questioned.</p>

  <p>As I grew stronger, I began to think it strange that neither of my uncles
  ever came to see us in our great sorrow. When I mentioned this to my mother,
  she was seized with great trembling, and bade me never mention them again. I
  had made up my mind, however, to be kept in ignorance no longer, and I was
  persistent. I would know everything. If they refused to tell me, I would run
  away to Castle Munster and find out from my grandmother, or from the servants
  there. I was so positive that my mother at last gave way, and leaning back in
  her chair amidst frequent storms of sobs and tears, she told me all that had
  happened.</p>

  <p>I listened hungrily, standing back in a far corner of the solemnly
  darkened room, and with my eyes riveted upon the thick folds of crape which
  hung about my mother's frail form, I heard now that scarcely an hour after my
  father had cast himself from the summit of Culbone Tower news came that my
  uncle Francis had been picked up from amongst the rocks below Bossington
  headland, dead, and with unmistakable marks of violence about his throat. An
  inquest was held upon the body, and an old shepherd, who had been ascending
  the hill from Allercombe, deposed, with great reluctance, that he had seen,
  far away from him, the figures of two men struggling together on the verge of
  the cliff, and that one had cast the other over. Then my uncle Cecil had been
  called upon, and in a low tone, and amongst the deep sympathy of every one
  present, he had told his tale. They had all three been shooting together, he
  said, and were returning by the cliffs. There had been a slight
  unpleasantness between his two brothers during the earlier part of the day,
  and it suddenly blazed out again into a fierce quarrel as they stood on
  Bossington headland, prepared to descend into Porlock. He himself had been a
  little way behind at the time of the crisis, adjusting the strap of his
  gaiter, and just as he was straightening himself and preparing to move
  forward the calamity had occurred. He could tell them no more, he said; nor
  could he, for, strong man though he was, he suddenly reeled against the table
  and was carried from the room in a dead faint. There was a profound sensation
  amongst the little body of sympathizing men; but, though the coroner
  pronounced the verdict in a broken voice, and with tears in his eyes, it was
  the only one which they dared give, and it was:</p>

  <p>"Wilful murder against Frank Catherall."</p>

  <p>My first impulse, on hearing this awful story, was to disbelieve it. But
  then I remembered the fiery temper of all the Catheralls, which had led many
  of them in days gone by to commit deeds as rash, if not so sinful. And I
  thought of my father's wild appearance when he had burst in upon us, and of
  his mad climb up to Culbone Tower and its fearful sequel. Then, too, I
  remembered my Uncle Cecil's reluctant evidence, and my heart sank. The web of
  testimony was too closely woven. My father had died a murderer&mdash;had cast
  himself into eternity with the curse of Cain upon his head...</p>

  <p>Slowly the months dragged by at our lonely home, and, as winter drew on, a
  fresh terror crept in upon us. In the middle of the night strange sounds
  often came from the dreary tower which loomed almost over our heads, and with
  the whistling of the November wind came cries and moans which seemed to us,
  listening in awe and trembling, like the outpourings of an anguished spirit.
  Others heard them beside ourselves, and strange tales reached us of a tall,
  majestic figure, in flowing garb and long white beard, which, whenever a
  storm was raging, could be seen standing by the side of the tower, gazing out
  over the furious sea. Such tales as these spread, and one by one our servants
  left us. At first I was incredulous; but one afternoon at dusk, when the wild
  west wind was roaring down the coombs, and sheets of rain were rolling over
  the cliffs in curling clouds, I crept on my hands and knees along our tiny
  strip of lawn, and, soaked through and through, and dreading every moment
  lest I should be blown over the cliffs, I crouched down with my eyes fixed
  upon the tower. Then I too saw it. A chill, more icy than the driving rain or
  the cold earth could give, passed through my shuddering frame as I saw
  suddenly emerge from the tower the tall figure which I had know and loved so
  well. With swift, even footsteps he seemed to pass without effort up the
  slippery, almost perpendicular rock, where I knew that no mortal footsteps
  could tread without slipping and falling backward amongst the wet-bespangled
  heather&mdash;there, in the same place that I had seen him pause before,
  between earth and sky, he stood still for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Father!" I cried, "father!" But the rushing wind driving in my face
  refused to carry the sound, and bore it back over my head. For a moment I
  closed my eyes, and when I re-opened them again the figure was gone. Then I
  knew that I had seen my dead father's spirit.</p>

  <p>For a while I dared not look upon the scene of this terrible apparition;
  and when I told my mother what I had seen, she too was overwhelmed with fear,
  for she was by nature nervous, although I was not. One afternoon, however,
  not many weeks afterwards, I summoned up my courage and walked almost to the
  edge of the chasm, gazing steadily up at the frowning tower above me. There
  was no sign of life there, mortal or ghostly, and gradually I felt my fears
  subside. I was just turning away with a sigh of relief, when I heard the
  shuffle of footsteps, and found Perkins by my side.</p>

  <p>He looked at me narrowly, almost suspiciously, for a moment.</p>

  <p>"What be'st doing here, Miss Lizzie?" he asked, peering up at me from
  underneath his shaggy eyebrows. "Dost want to see t' poor master's ghost?
  You'll no see it in fine weather. He'll only come to us in a storm."</p>

  <p>I shuddered.</p>

  <p>"You have seen it, then?" I exclaimed eagerly. "Perkins, why does he come?
  It is awful!"</p>

  <p>The old man turned round upon me, his voice in trembling anger.</p>

  <p>"Why do 'e come, Miss Lizzie? Ay, you may well ask that. How do 'e think a
  poor spirit can rest in its dark watery grave when it's been so sorely
  wronged? I tell 'e this," he continued hoarsely, holding his withered arms
  out towards the sea, with a dramatic, almost majestic, gesture, "never'll his
  spirit rest quiet, never'll the waves give up his body for decent burial,
  till Master Cecil Catherall takes back his lying words, and the whole world
  knows as my poor dear master was no murderer. I tell 'e that, Miss Lizzie; I
  tell 'e that!"</p>

  <p>He shuffled away, leaving me almost paralysed by his strange words.
  Latterly we had come to look upon Perkins as weak in the head, and he spent
  all his time rambling about the place, no one knew where; but his words were
  spoken with such intense earnestness, that they made a strange impression on
  me. All day long I was restless and uneasy, but in the morning I had come to
  a decision. I would go and see my Uncle Cecil.</p>

  <p>The next morning, before any one was astir, I started on my solitary
  expedition, leaving word only that I had gone for a long walk. Since the day
  of that terrible tragedy we had had no visit or message from either my
  grandmother or my uncle, and I felt not a little nervous at the idea of
  presenting myself before stern old Mrs. Catherall, who disliked my mother,
  and had never taken much notice of me. But for my age I had a wonderful
  amount of resolution, and I never shrank from my self-imposed task. The road
  to Munster Castle lay across a great stretch of moorland, radiant with a
  purple glory and with gleaming yellow gorse in the summer, but barren and
  desolate-looking on that chill November morning. White clouds of mist came
  rolling down from the hills, at times soaking me through, and often I had to
  wade through the swollen streams which flowed across the rough track. Still I
  held on, though at times there came gusts of wind which carried me nearly off
  my feet, and though the path grew no better than the bed of a mountain
  torrent. At times a solitary signpost standing out against the grey sky or
  the black hills cheered me on my way; but not a human being did I meet till,
  after five hours of walking, the dreary towers of Munster Castle rose up
  before me. How my heart throbbed then! I forgot how faint and weary I was as
  I entered the great courtyard and timidly rang the bell. No one answered the
  summons; so, as the door was open, I walked inside and sat down upon one of
  the carved oak chairs. Presently a tall, grave-looking servant came across
  the hall, and started back in amazement at the sight of me. I rose and
  explained my presence.</p>

  <p>"You'll not be able to see Mr. Cecil, Miss," he said, staring at me as
  though I were a wild creature. "He only came home from abroad yesterday; that
  is to say, he was brought home ill. I'll tell Mrs. Catherall, though, if
  you'll be pleased to take a seat. She's with him now."</p>

  <p>He moved away and opened a door on the opposite side of the hall. I
  watched my opportunity, and followed him noiselessly through two great rooms
  into a smaller one, on the threshold of which he paused and said something to
  its inmates in a subdued tone. Before he had finished I had slipped past him
  and had entered the apartment.</p>

  <p>In an invalid's chair, nearly smothered with magnificent furs, and drawn
  up before a blazing fire, lay my Uncle Cecil. His face was thin and haggard,
  and his great brown eyes seemed burning with a fierce but weary light. By his
  side stood my grandmother, majestic and handsome as ever, with her grey hair
  coiled in many plaits about her head, and an angry light gleaming in her
  still bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Child, how dared you come here?" she said in a low tone full of intense
  vibrating anger. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>Before I could answer, my Uncle Cecil had sprung up from his couch with a
  quick, startled exclamation.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he cried, "it is his child! It is Frank's child! What does she
  want?"</p>

  <p>I moved towards him, quivering with excitement, and striving to steady my
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Cecil," I cried, "I have come to you because my father's ghost is
  crying out night and day from Culbone Tower, and Perkins says that it will
  never be quiet until you speak. I am come to know all about the day when
  Uncle Francis was killed."</p>

  <p>Such a cry as mortal lips have seldom uttered burst from my grandmother's
  trembling lips. Uncle Cecil was shaking all over like a man stricken with a
  deadly ague. I gazed from one to the other, frightened, bewildered, yet not
  one whit disposed to withdraw my question.</p>

  <p>It was my grandmother who recovered first.</p>

  <p>"Child," she exclaimed in a tone tremulous with passion, "why have you
  come here with this mad story about your father's ghost? What can your uncle
  know about that miserable day that he has not already declared? Go home at
  once; or, stay, I will send some one home with you," and she stretched out
  her hand towards the bell.</p>

  <p>He stopped her quietly, but firmly. There was a new look in his face which
  I liked little to look upon, although it gave me hope.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said calmly, "the time has come to speak. I will not die with
  this sin upon my conscience. Child! Lizzie your father was no murderer. It
  was I who threw Francis over the cliff."</p>

  <p>I looked at him, and thought that I must be dreaming. With a great sob of
  agony my grandmother had thrown her arms around his neck, and was imploring
  him to be silent.</p>

  <p>"He is raving," she said to me excitedly. "Take no notice of him; he is
  raving. Cecil, my darling, what good can this do? Be silent; oh, be silent,
  for my sake!"</p>

  <p>"Mother, I cannot," he faltered. "God have mercy upon me, I cannot!
  Lizzie, ring the bell!"</p>

  <p>Mechanically I obeyed him. He asked a question of the servant who
  appeared, which was answered in the affirmative. A minute or two later a
  clergyman was shown into the room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Greyson," said my Uncle Cecil, stretching out his hand imploringly to
  where my grandmother kneeled on the floor beside him, "I want you to listen
  to a few words from me. I am going to tell you the truth about my brother
  Francis's death."</p>

  <p>A deep groan from the prostrate figure by his side, and my uncle passed
  his hand across his forehead as though the task was almost beyond his
  strength.</p>

  <p>"On that afternoon," he continued hoarsely, "Francis had spoken bitter but
  just words to me about a matter in which I was much to blame. While we waited
  at Bossington Hill for Frank, who was some distance behind, he recurred to
  the subject, and told me what steps he had decided to take in it. I called
  him an impertinent meddler, and struck him. We closed together, and in the
  struggle I threw my brother over the cliff. Frank came up just in time to
  witness the awful deed. For some minutes we could neither of us speak. Then,
  trembling with horror and fear, I stammered out a few wild words.</p>

  <p>"'Cecil,' he cried, with his hands upon my shoulders, 'God help you! I am
  the only one who saw this. I will die sooner than give evidence against you,
  remember that. Get home now, and say it was an accident.'</p>

  <p>"He rushed away from me, and before I reached home I heard of his death.
  Then the shepherd came to me who had seen the struggle, and I was at my wits'
  end. Frank had died to save me. Should I let his sacrifice be in vain, or
  should I tell a lie which could hurt his memory only? I told the lie, and it
  has killed me; it has eaten the life away within me. I am a dying man, Mr.
  Greyson; and with the knowledge that in a day or two I shall stand before my
  God, I swear that this is the truth. I implore you to fetch a
  magistrate."</p>

  <p>They took but little notice of me; and when Mr. Greyson left them, I
  slipped out, and, heedless of the wind and rain, started homeward. Across the
  bleak, desolate moor I sped, revelling in the wild blasts which swept down
  the mountain's side upon me, for I knew that the storm was increasing, and he
  would be there to-night. I reached home; but, avoiding the house, I stepped
  out on to the tiny strip of lawn, and, holding tightly on to the iron
  railing, crept along towards the chasm. When I reached it, I could see
  nothing but the sea below, curling and hissing, sweeping in with a long
  hungry roar, and dashing its foaming spray far up the side of the cliff.
  Above me the fast-moving leaden clouds seemed descending almost within reach,
  and a hurricane was raging amongst the thickly-grown pine trees, whistling
  with a fierce mirth amongst their slender tops, shaking together with a harsh
  grating the cones, and bending them down like blades of grass. I crouched in
  a corner, waiting in awe till this fierce revelry of the elements should
  subside a little, and straining my eyes through the darkness to catch sight
  of the tower which loomed directly in front of me. Suddenly I heard a voice
  close to my side.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lizzie, what in God's name are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>I peered out into the darkness, and recognized the dim outline of Perkins'
  bent form.</p>

  <p>"Perkins," I cried, "I have been to Castle Munster and seen Uncle Cecil.
  It was he who killed his brother. He is dying; and he has confessed."</p>

  <p>He seized me by the shoulders, with a strange light in his bleared eyes.
  "Be you lying? Tell me quick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is true," I cried, frightened by his vehemence. "The ghost will
  trouble us no longer."</p>

  <p>"The Lord be praised!" he muttered. "God! what's that?"</p>

  <p>Two young pine trees, torn up by their roots, were whirled across the lawn
  close to us, and, smashing through the iron palisading as though it had been
  rotten timber, disappeared over the edge of the cliff.</p>

  <p>The old man fell on his knees, and prayed for a moment or two. Then he
  stood up, holding on to the remnant of the railing.</p>

  <p>"I seen many a storm in my life," he muttered, "but ne'er such a one as
  this. God grant the tower may stand! Miss Lizzie, ye're a brave child. Dare
  yer follow me?"</p>

  <p>I nodded. The wind would have Mocked at my efforts at speech had I
  attempted it.</p>

  <p>"Come, then!" He moved slowly forward to the very verge of the chasm,
  dragging something behind him. I followed on hands and knees.</p>

  <p>He paused and threw a rough plank across to the boulder on which the tower
  stood. He stepped carefully across, and presently I heard his voice from the
  other side.</p>

  <p>"I ha' made it fast, Miss Lizzie. Dare 'e come?" I crept to the edge and
  looked down with a shudder at the black yawning chasm.</p>

  <p>"Shall I see the ghost, Perkins?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," he answered. "See!" and he half roused himself from the bracken
  amongst which he had been crouching, and pointed with a long trembling finger
  towards the tower. To my amazement there was a feeble light burning in the
  topmost chamber.</p>

  <p>"I will come, Perkins," I cried. "Walt for me."</p>

  <p>I knelt down, clinging to a shrub until there was a momentary lull in the
  gusts which came tearing and roaring down the coomb. Then I sprang up, and,
  holding my breath, hurried across the frail little bridge. The moment I was
  in safety we commenced the ascent to the tower; but we had got little more
  than halfway up when another burst of wind and rain came round the corner of
  the coomb, and we had to sink down amongst the wet bracken and dig our
  fingers into the very earth to save ourselves from being carried away and
  swept over the edge of the cliff. There we lay, cowed and shuddering, for
  what seemed to me an interminable while, listening to the wild, melancholy
  shrieking of the wind amongst the pine trees, and the loud angry roaring of
  the furious sea below. At last it seemed to abate a little, and almost on our
  hands and knees we crept up to the door of the tower. My heart was beating
  with a fierce excitement, increased by all that I had gone through during
  that wonderful day, and I seemed to have a distinct consciousness that
  something extraordinary was going to happen.</p>

  <p>Perkins pushed open the door with his foot, and we tumbled together into
  the narrow chamber. A tall figure sprang from the other end of the place
  towards us, and at first I shrank away in an agony of fear; but then I heard
  my name in well-remembered accents, and saw a familiar pair of arms stretched
  out towards me, and my fear died away. "Father," I cried, "father!", and with
  one bound I threw myself into the passionate embrace of the Ghost of Culbone
  Tower.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>That same night, after my tale had been told, my father abandoned his
  self-imposed exile, and returned with me to Glencoombe. On the morrow news
  reached us of my Uncle Cecil's death; but his confession had been signed and
  witnessed, and my father found himself a hero.</p>

  <p>For a while we continued to live at Glencoombe. But so constant was the
  stream of visitors who came to gaze upon the haunted tower, and over the edge
  of the rock on to the shelf-like plateau which had served as a hiding-place,
  that to escape them we moved to Munster Castle, which, since the death of
  Mrs. Catherall&mdash;she had not long survived her favourite son&mdash;had
  become my father's property. And there I lived until my name was no longer
  Catherall, and some one took me away to another part of the country; but
  seldom a year goes by that we do not return for a while to Munster Castle,
  and our stay there never passes without at least one picnic on the heights of
  Culbone Tower.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>5.&mdash;THE THIRTIETH OF AUGUST</h2>

  <p class="first">Although I am not by any means a fatalist, nor have I the
  slightest inclination to worship at the shrine of that mighty but fickle
  goddess Chance, I am, nevertheless, perfectly willing to admit that chance is
  responsible for this revelation. I am not a reader of fiction, nor do I take
  in a single magazine or periodical; yet somehow there fell into my hands a
  few days ago, by one of the most curious of accidents, the current issue of a
  notable magazine, and my fingers, straying listlessly over it, opened it at a
  story which I read from beginning to end without a pause, and which has made
  a most extraordinary impression upon me.</p>

  <p>The author of that story states at the outset that he has written it with
  the sole object of relieving himself of a dreadful secret, and that in doing
  so he has found some consolation. This may be true, or it may be merely the
  cunning statement of a wily writer, who seeks by its means to more
  effectually rivet the attention and increase the interest of his readers. I
  prefer to believe that the former is the case, and that he has set down his
  story in plain, simple language, hoping that, by sharing with the world the
  knowledge of his brief communion with unknown powers, be may gain some
  respite from the ever-increasing agony of torturing recollections. And if
  this be so, and if he has indeed derived some measure of consolation by such
  means, why should I not do likewise? Why should not I also make an effort to
  escape from the haunting sorrow which every year casts a long shadow of gloom
  over my life? I have asked Marguerite, and she is not averse to the idea. We
  hug our terrible secret the doser, because none other knows of it. Let it go
  from us, and perchance it will seem stripped of some of its horrors when we
  know that the world at large is either scoffing at it as an idle sensational
  story, or is dealing out to us its sympathy. Yes, I have decided that it
  shall be done, and Marguerite looks over my shoulder approvingly whilst I
  write these lines.</p>

  <p>If by some strange process there could be expunged from the calendar one
  day&mdash;the thirtieth day of August&mdash;then should I be amongst the
  happiest of men. For what else is there to trouble me? I am rich, and held in
  good esteem amongst my fellows, so that such society that I care for I can
  enjoy. My home is the envy of all men who look upon it, as Marguerite, my
  beloved wife, by far the greatest source of all my happiness, is still the
  same to me as when I wooed her amongst the bending rushes and on the tranquil
  blue waters of Lake Luigi. One cloud alone, the reflection that the
  inexorable hand of time will soon bring round again that hateful date, can
  dim for a moment our serene happiness. And when it comes, we draw closer
  still to each other, and, hand in hand, we suffer in silence. Ah, the misery,
  the deep depressing misery of it!</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Nineteen years ago I saw for the first time Marguerite, my wife.
  Marguerite Ellière she was then&mdash;Marguerite Trevannion is now her name
  but, strange though it may seem, days before I saw her I was wildly in love
  with her.</p>

  <p>It happened thus: I had made up my mind to spend the winter in Rome, and
  had engaged rooms and a studio; for I was something of an artist, though it
  was rather a pastime than a profession with me. I had scarcely settled down
  to my work, however, before a strange mood of dissatisfaction with my
  surroundings and occupation came over me. It was the height of the season,
  and the crowds of fashionable Americans and English people who were crowding
  into Rome seemed to me to stultify the artistic associations of the Italian
  capital, and to render commonplace its most sacred objects. I began to meet
  acquaintances, to be asked out to dinner, to be visited at my studio, and, in
  short, to be subject to the same annoyances to escape which I had wandered
  away from England. For a while I put up with it, though my work and my temper
  suffered seriously. But one morning, after a prolonged visit from a bevy of
  the merest acquaintances, who took up the whole of my working day, and drove
  me to the verge of distraction by their shallow criticisms and shallower
  small-talk, I felt that the limits of my endurance had been passed. On the
  morrow I locked up my studio and left Rome. At first I had some thoughts of
  going northwards, and of burying myself for a season of hard work in one of
  the most retired of the provincial towns. But the chance mention in my
  hearing of a place which I had never visited induced me to decide otherwise.
  I crossed the Straits of Messina, and in three days I found myself in
  Palermo.</p>

  <p>For a fortnight I lived here the life I loved best to lead. I rose early
  and made long excursions into the surrounding country, painted when the whim
  seized me, and in the evenings I smoked my pipe on the Marina, listening to
  the band and drinking in with deep draughts of lazy enjoyment the soft,
  voluptuous air of the long summer nights. I mixed but little with the people,
  and shunned the noisy cafés; but for all that it was not long before I heard
  a piece of news which all Palermo was eagerly engaged in discussing. The
  divine Marguerite was coming&mdash;Marguerite Elliere, the songstress of the
  world, the woman whose favour the monarchs of Europe had vied with each other
  to obtain, that they might listen to the music of her voice; Marguerite, the
  Russian nightingale, the spirit of the north, whose song no man could hear
  and forget&mdash;and, with her, her brute of a husband.</p>

  <p>I was but little interested in the news. Music was the one of the arts
  which I cared least for, and the excitement of the Palermitans seemed to me
  somewhat absurd. Besides, she was not coming to sing at all; she was coming,
  as it was everywhere announced, merely for a change and rest. As a singer I
  might have been prepared to do a certain amount of homage to her (to the
  extent of going to hear her sing, at any rate), but as a woman I could not
  summon up for a single spark of enthusiasm; and so when she arrived, and all
  Palermo flocked round her carriage and strewed her way with flowers, I was
  lounging about the palatial open corridors of the Convent of San Martino,
  many miles away from the scene of her triumphal progress.</p>

  <p>The following night was one which will dwell in my memory for ever. I had
  lingered on the Marina, lounging on a seat at its furthest extremity, until
  it was almost deserted. The band had played the National Hymn&mdash;a strange
  medley of rugged chords it is&mdash;and had departed to enjoy a well-earned
  rest at a late café; the carriages of the Palermitan nobility had long since
  left the esplanade; and save for a few loiterers like myself, who found it
  hard to tear themselves away from the subtle witchery of the southern night,
  every one in Palermo seemed to have retired. But I was so steeped in a sort
  of placid content that until long past midnight I sat there, my eyes drinking
  in the inimitable beauty of the scene&mdash;now dwelling upon the white
  villas and terrace-fronted houses of the old town, deluged with the golden
  light of the southern moon; now wandering over the glittering surface of the
  violet sea, all alight and glowing with the reflection of the star-bespangled
  sky, and more than once resting on the towering rocky promontories which
  stood out in the bay like giant sentinels watching over the repose of the old
  Sicilian town. On the heavy air the lustrous perfume of many sweet-scented
  flowers, mingled with the aromatic odour from the thickly growing cinnamon
  and orange groves, floated and hung about; and, save the low murmur of the
  sea as it swept in upon the yielding sands, there was no sound to break in
  upon the enchantment of the perfect stillness. Surely the mantle of night had
  never fallen upon a fairer scene!</p>

  <p>I had fallen into a sort of dreamy torpor, and my cigar had burnt itself
  out between my fingers. Then all of a sudden I was galvanized into a state of
  acute passionate excitement.</p>

  <p>Across the glistening waters of the bay came a sound which set every nerve
  in my body tingling and every pulse throbbing with a tumult of uncontrollable
  feelings. A human voice I thought at first that it could not be. What human
  heart could have held the sorrow which floated across the still water to my
  ear like the anguished wail of a despairing spirit? And yet, as it grew in
  force, and rose and fell with all the cadence of the most exquisite music, I
  knew that it was a human voice, the voice of a woman, singing out to the
  midnight sky the bitterness of pent-up agony and a breaking heart.</p>

  <p>I rose from my seat breathless and trembling. Others had crept on tip-toe
  to the spot, and stood listening with me; but until the last chord had died
  away the silence amongst us was unbroken. Then some one whispered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is the diva!"</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" I asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>The man looked at me in surprise. Probably I was the only being in Palermo
  who did not know the temporary dwelling-place which Marguerite Elliere and
  her husband, had chosen.</p>

  <p>"There, on the hill of Ulysses," he answered, pointing to what was really
  a huge rock about a quarter of a mile out in the bay. "The villa belongs to
  her husband, Count Muzatti, though he has never occupied it before."</p>

  <p>"Her husband! She is married, then?" I remarked, more for the sake of
  continuing the conversation than from actual ignorance of the fact.</p>

  <p>"Married! poor girl! Yes; she is married to one of the greatest
  blackguards Sicily ever produced. Count Muzatti is a scoundrelly adventurer,
  who lives on his wife's money and ill-treats her. She must be an angel to
  bear it as she does."</p>

  <p>"She must be an angel to sing like that," I remarked absently, with my
  face turned towards the sea, and my eyes straining through the darkness
  towards that vineyard-covered rock.</p>

  <p>My companion&mdash;he was evidently a Palermitan of gentle
  birth&mdash;answered gravely, almost reverently&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Such a gift as hers must raise her high above other women. As an artist
  she is divine, and as a woman she is amongst the best. Scandal has never
  reached her, nor will it ever. She is as faithful to her drunkard husband as
  he is faithless to her. Beast I wish monsieur good-night."</p>

  <p>He raised his hat courteously, and moved away. Late though it was, I did
  not follow him. It seemed as though I could not leave the spot My whole being
  had been stirred by that mournful music into a state of passionate tumult. I
  was in love with a voice.</p>

  <p>On the morrow I saw her. She was coming down the steep sloping vineyard to
  the sea when I sailed by her rocky home dangerously near. A white
  morning-gown hung in straight folds about her tall, slim figure, and her
  deep, full eyes glanced placidly into mine for a moment as I sailed by. It
  was only for a moment, for my too eager gaze startled her, and she turned her
  head away with a gesture which had in it a suspicion of hauteur. But I had
  seen her, and I was satisfied. I knew that her song was indeed the wailing of
  her heart; for a great weariness was written into her perfect face, and the
  light of an ineffable sorrow was reflected from her deep eyes.</p>

  <p>I am a man of strange moods, which in those days of my youth were more my
  master than they are now. I was passionately in love with Marguerite Elliere,
  and I feared to trust myself in the same country with her and her brute of a
  husband. Rapidly I made all my preparations for leaving Sicily, and
  determined that I would do so without seeing her or hearing again the magical
  heart-stirring music of her voice. But fate would have it otherwise. On the
  day before my intended departure I was returning alone from a farewell visit
  to the Convent of San Martino, when, as I neared the last mountain pass
  before the descent into the Plain of Palermo commenced, I heard the sound of
  firearms and the cry of a woman in distress. How it thrilled me! for I knew
  that no other voice save hers had uttered that cry for help. What followed I
  need not dwell upon. When I turned the corner and dashed down the hillside I
  saw her husband making a feeble resistance against a couple of brawny
  black-bearded robbers, whilst another had dared to lay his great coarse hand
  upon her mouth to stop her cries. My sudden appearance amongst them gave me
  an advantage, which their wonder increased when they saw me, in a wild
  passion of anger, deal the man who had touched her such a blow that he fell
  to the ground like a log, with his arm stretched up to the sky, and the last
  word he ever uttered quivering upon his lips. At any rate, when I turned to
  assist her husband, his assailants, not noticing that I was unarmed, fumed,
  and fled.</p>

  <p>It was a strange scene, a strange position for me to be in. We were in the
  middle of a narrow winding road which seemed cut out of the solid rock, shut
  in on one side by a sheer bare ascent, whilst on the other the slope was more
  gradual, and was thickly planted with vineyards and olive trees, through the
  leaves of which we could see the Plain of Palermo stretched out like a
  panorama below. Wild hyacinths of many colours grew out from clefts in the
  hard grey rock, perfuming the air already heavy with the musky aromatic scent
  from the distant orange groves; and away where the western sky stooped to
  meet the silvery waters of the Mediterranean, the sun was sinking down,
  tinging the sea and clouds alike with brilliant streaks of orange and purple.
  It was a fine scene, but I had eyes only for the woman who stood before me
  with an eloquent look of gratitude in her sweet sad eyes, and a winning smile
  parting her lips. If she had been afraid, the fear had surely been but
  transitory, for her statuesque perfect face betrayed no other emotion than of
  slight kindliness towards me.</p>

  <p>"Signor we have much to thank you for," she said in a low musical tone.
  "Is it not so, Albert?"</p>

  <p>She turned to her husband, and my eyes followed hers. I saw a middle-aged
  man, under the middle height, and inclined to corpulency, of whose personal
  appearance it was impossible to form any just idea, for his olive complexion
  was green with fear, and he was still half lying in the road, crouching down
  in the dust with half-closed eyes, and apparently in a state of
  semi-consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt, Albert?" she inquired anxiously.</p>

  <p>He made no immediate answer, and we both moved to his side. He looked up
  at us blinking, and then staggered to his feet with an oath. For a moment I
  forgot that she was his wife, and I made no effort to keep the contempt I
  felt from my face. Perhaps she saw it; at any rate, a faint tinge of pink
  stole into her face, and when she addressed him again her tone was singularly
  cold.</p>

  <p>"Albert, will you not thank this gentleman for his help?"</p>

  <p>He held out a little white hand, which, with its multitude of rings, was
  certainly very unlike a man's; and having at last convinced himself that all
  danger was over, he was certainly voluble enough in his gratitude, and in his
  anger against the ruffians who had dared to molest him. To escape from him I
  knelt down to examine the man whom I had struck. He was dead.</p>

  <p>"Serve him right!" exclaimed the count, spurning the prostrate body with
  his foot. "Dog of a robber!</p>

  <p>"Dead! and you only struck him one blow," she said, in an awed tone. "You
  must be fearfully strong," she added, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"His hands were upon you," I answered in a low voice, and to me it seemed
  justification enough.</p>

  <p>We descended the hill, all three together, to where their carriage was
  waiting; then, while they fetched the body of the dead robber, we rested
  under a clump of olive trees, and afterwards I returned to Palermo with them.
  Count Muzatti pressed me hard to accompany them to their villa; but at first
  I refused&mdash;I felt that I could scarcely trust myself with the man whom I
  had already learned to despise, and the woman whom I loved. But at a word
  from her I was powerless; I went.</p>

  <p>Well do I remember that night. We dined together at a little round table,
  in a deliciously shaded room hung with many-coloured lights which only half
  dispelled the pleasant, dreary twilight. Through the open windows the evening
  breeze stole gently in, with just sufficient vigour to keep the heavy odour
  of hyacinths and aloes and many other wild flowers from becoming oppressive,
  and in our ears there was ever the pleasant, rippling sound of the waves as
  they broke round the corner of the rock and swept in towards the shore.</p>

  <p>At the commencement of the meal my host was inclined to be talkative, and
  his manner was distinctly courteous. But, alas! a change soon came. I saw
  Marguerite's face grow clouded and troubled, and watched her make more than
  one faint ineffectual appeal to her husband. But it was in vain. Time after
  time he emptied his glass with the reckless abandon of an habitual drunkard,
  and from comparative volubility he relapsed gradually but surely into sudden
  boorishness. I glanced from his coarse, sensual face and weak mil eyes into
  the face of the woman who called him husband&mdash;delicate, refined,
  spiritually beautiful, although at that moment contracted with pain, and a
  wild longing came upon me to sever the bond which joined a beast to an angel
  by throwing him out of the wide-open windows into the swiftly running sea
  below. Conversation had altogether ceased between us, and it was a relief to
  me when she rose and, silently placing some cigarettes upon the table, Left
  the room. I dared not remain behind, and so I followed her; but it was with
  the intention of leaving the place at once, for I dared not trust myself
  either with him or her. I had been a fool to come.</p>

  <p>Outside, leaning over the iron railing which skirted the precipitous side
  of the rock, with her sad eyes travelling over the restless sea, I found her,
  and for a while I stood by her side in silence. The land breeze carried to
  our ears the hum of voices, and the faint strains of the band from the
  distant Marina; but the moon had not yet risen, and a long semicircle of
  twinkling light was all we could see of the town. Then I began to talk to
  her, making no mention at first of her husband, but seeking to win her
  forgetfulness for the while of her hideous trouble. And I succeeded, for
  presently it was she who was talking and I listening while she spoke of the
  many countries she had visited, and with an enthusiasm which nothing else
  could provoke, of her beloved art. The hours stole away like minutes to me,
  until at last the time came when I must go. She held out her hand with a
  half-regretful gesture, and I clasped it firmly in mine.</p>

  <p>"I may come and see you again," I begged. "Let me bring my sketches and
  show them to you."</p>

  <p>I think that she would have consented, but that she chanced to look into
  my eyes and to read my secret there. She drew back at once, with all the old
  trouble flooding into her face, and turned a little away from me.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better not," she said in a low tone. "Nay, I would rather
  that you did not."</p>

  <p>A bitter despair laid hold of me, and forced me to speak. I pointed to the
  open window.</p>

  <p>"Will it be always like this for you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She bowed her head. "I am his wife."</p>

  <p>Then I touched her fingers with my lips, and turned away without another
  word. Who was I that I should tempt her?</p>
  <hr>

  <p>High up in one of the least known passes of the Rocky Mountains we had
  pitched our nomad tent. All around and above us were snow-covered peaks, and
  we ourselves looked down upon the clouds, a giddy distance below. With a pipe
  in my mouth I sat taking a rapid sketch, whilst Jack Hallidean, the companion
  of my travels, stood on a ridge a few yards away, with a telescope in his
  hand. Suddenly he called me to him.</p>

  <p>"Phil, what do you make of that?" he exclaimed eagerly, pointing downwards
  to one of the lower ranges and handing me the glass.</p>

  <p>At first I could see nothing but a tiny black speck, but a closer
  examination showed me that it was moving steadily towards us.</p>

  <p>"It's a man," I decided, handing him back the glass.</p>

  <p>"Bravo, Jim!" shouted my companion, throwing his cap in the air and
  shutting up his telescope with a bang. "Splendid fellow, Jim. Said he'd be
  back in a week, and, by Jove! he's done it! Hullo, you fellows, there," he
  shouted to our two guides, who were taking their ease below, "come and make a
  fire here, quick&mdash;a jolly good blaze; Jim's in sight."</p>

  <p>I went on with my sketching with a heavy heart. News from home was nothing
  to me. How I envied Jack Hallidean his cheerful light-heartedness, and the
  pile of letters which I knew he would soon receive.</p>

  <p>In about a couple of hours Jim reached us. Nineteen letters and newspapers
  for Jack; for me a letter from my steward and another from my lawyer. I threw
  myself on the ground in front of the huge fire and carelessly opened one of
  the newspapers which Jack had thrown over to me.</p>

  <p>Politics, marriages, general news. I wandered through the usual routine
  without much interest But suddenly I leaped to my feet with a cry, and,
  clenching the paper in my hand, bent close over the ruddy flames. It was one
  short paragraph which had awakened a sudden passionate interest in the life
  which only a few hours ago had seemed to me a wearisome burden&mdash;one
  short paragraph which told me of another man's death. Count Muzatti had
  committed suicide at Palermo in a drunken frenzy!</p>

  <p>Wild thoughts and hopes surged into my brain, and with the paper clenched
  in my hand I walked rapidly up and down our little camping-ground. Jack's
  hand on my shoulder brought me to myself, and when I looked into his glowing
  face I knew, too, that he had had some great news.</p>

  <p>"Phil," he exclaimed, "I'm beastly sorry, but I want to go back to
  England. The dearest girl in all the world has written to tell
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all right!" I shouted joyfully, grasping him by the hand; "I
  want to go back too!"</p>

  <p>"The deuce you do! Hurrah! England for ever! Why, you old misanthrope, you
  look ten years younger. Let's have a pipe by this glorious fire, and tell me
  all about it."</p>

  <p>I told him, and hand and hand we wished one another luck over the dying
  embers of our signal-fire. In four months we landed at Liverpool.</p>

  <p>I had thought that it would be an easy matter to discover the whereabouts
  of Marguerite Elliere. Events proved that I was mistaken. She had ceased to
  sing in public, and it was thought that she had taken another name. More than
  this I could not learn; and, after more than a year's eager search, it was by
  accident that I discovered her.</p>

  <p>I was staying&mdash;a heavy-hearted wanderer&mdash;within a stone's-throw
  of one of the smallest and least visited of the Italian lakes, and on the
  evening of my arrival, tired though I was, the brilliancy of the night
  tempted me out upon the lake. A fairer night I had never seen. The moon was
  shining with all the clearness of day, but with the softness of a celestial
  eventide, upon the glasslike water, casting across it broad tracts of
  sparkling silvery light; and as I pulled slowly along, leaving in my wake a
  glistening trail, the soft splash of my oars was the only sound to be heard.
  Slowly I rowed on, leaving the lights of the hotel far away behind me, until
  I drew near an island almost in the centre of the lake. As I passed I could
  catch the dim outline of a low picturesque cottage, with lawn sloping right
  down to the water's edge, and the whole nearly hidden by the thickly growing
  trees which surrounded the little habitation. A charming little place I
  thought, and I shipped my oars, whilst I lit my pipe and had another look at
  it. And then the stillness of the night was suddenly broken, and my heart
  gave a great leap, for I knew that my search was over.</p>

  <p>The voice of a woman singing came floating out from the low open windows
  and across the dark waters to my ears. Weirdly fascinating, exquisitely sad,
  there was but one woman in the world who could sing like that, and it was she
  whom I sought.</p>

  <p>Breathless I waited, and the echoes of her song had scarcely died away
  before I saw her coming across the lawn towards me. With a gentle backward
  motion of my oars I sought the shelter of the trees which overhung the water,
  and waited.</p>

  <p>In a moment or two she emerged from the shadows of the trees overhanging
  the garden walk, and stood full in the moonlight. To my dying day I shall
  think of her as I saw her then, leaning on the wooden rail and gazing across
  the lake with all the sorrow and profound melancholy in her marvellous dark
  eyes which her song had expressed. There was that same look&mdash;the look of
  hopeless, unchangeable agony&mdash;still written on her face; but, strange to
  say, it fascinated me more even than her wonderful loveliness. Beauty I had
  often seen, but it had been laughing and gay, dispensing favours, accepting
  homage, and it had never caused my heart to throb or my pulse to beat quicker
  as it did then. Suddenly a change came over her face. She shivered, and a
  spasm of agony seemed for a moment to contort her features, and the horrible
  thought flashed upon me that she meant to cast herself into the lake. As one
  in a dream I stretched my oars to the water, and with one strong swift stroke
  reached the landing stage. I sprang out, stood by her side, and in a voice
  which, despite my efforts to control it, trembled with passion, I called her
  by her name.</p>

  <p>She knew me at once, and a great joy stole in upon me when I saw the
  colour flood her cheeks and a glad light sparkle for a moment in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You! you here! How did you&mdash;?" Her voice faltered, but I understood
  her.</p>

  <p>"I was on the lake, and I heard you sing." Ah! she moved a little away
  from me, and I could see that she was trembling.</p>

  <p>"I am not strong, and you have startled me," she said slowly. "Wait."</p>

  <p>I bowed silently, and she vanished in one of the side walks.</p>

  <p>How long I remained there I cannot tell; it might have been an hour, or it
  might have been only five minutes. For me, time was annihilated. I had but
  one thought&mdash;I had found her; and I should see her again.</p>

  <p>She came back a different being&mdash;a lovely woman, dignified and
  charming&mdash;and she spoke to me in a regular, melodious voice, in which
  was no trace of agitation or distress.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange that we should meet again," she said gently; and so
  unexpectedly. "How is it that you are on the lake so late?"</p>

  <p>She stood by my side with her shapely white arm resting upon the railing,
  a queenly-looking woman, with the features of a Madonna and the eyes of a
  Sappho. I was still half dazed, stupefied by the fascination her presence had
  for me; and I answered mechanically&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am staying at the hotel yonder, and I came out in a boat. I heard you
  singing, and I knew your voice again," I concluded softly.</p>

  <p>There was silence between us. The words that had been burning in my heart
  for years I dared not utter yet. So there was silence.</p>

  <p>It was she at last who broke it.</p>

  <p>"You must go," she said suddenly. "How cold it is getting!" And with a
  little shiver she drew the fleecy white shawl, which covered her head and
  shoulders, a little closer around her.</p>

  <p>I had no excuse to linger, and my tongue seemed tied; so with leaden,
  unwilling footsteps, I turned away. I reached the landing-stage and looked
  around. She was still standing by the railing, and a sudden boldness came to
  me.</p>

  <p>"May I come on the lake and hear you sing again?" I blurted out.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. For one moment the old look of trouble came into her eyes,
  and I thought that she was going to refuse me altogether.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better not," she said slowly, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?" I interrupted eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The lake isn't mine, is it? Good-night."</p>

  <p>I had come to this place weary and disheartened with my long fruitless
  search, intending to make my way slowly southwards to Palermo; but, after my
  first night's adventure I never dreamed of carrying out my plans. Towards
  evening on the morrow I saw her again, concealed in the shadows of the
  drooping trees. I heard again that wonderful music floating out from the
  lonely house, and my heart throbbed, and every pulse in my body quickened
  with the hope of seeing her. She came, and, unchidden, I moored my boat and
  stood once more by her side, dizzy with joy and steeped in the happiness of
  her presence. She feigned anger, and my senses, sharpened by my great love,
  detected the feint, and I stayed. I did not leave until she promised that I
  should see her again on the morrow; and so I did, and many a morrow
  afterwards. Uncounted and unnoticed, the days went by, and gradually there
  dawned upon me a great hope, which filled me with a bewildering and at times
  an overpowering joy. Surely she was learning in some measure to return my
  passionate but unspoken love, for, ever watchful, I saw her eyes commence to
  brighten at my coming, and follow me regretfully when I left. But still I
  kept silent, for I dared not stake my every hope until I was assured of
  success.</p>

  <p>One evening I found her in tears, and with the old look of intense
  melancholy in her face. It cut me to the heart to see her thus, and I
  implored her to tell me whether her grief was not one that I could lessen for
  her. She shook her head, and spoke of a dark, unhappy past. Mad with love, I
  caught her in my arms, and begged that she should forget the past in a future
  which my devotion should make happy. To my horror she turned away from me and
  shook her head. I was passionate, beseeching, imperious, and at last
  jealously suspicious. She bade me go, and I went.</p>

  <p>Long before the next evening came I had repented, and her voice came out
  to me. The window was closed, and I waited in vain. At last I moored my boat,
  and clambering over the low paling, stole down to the house. I looked in
  through the windows. She was lying on a couch, weeping. It was enough for me.
  The window yielded to my impatient hands, and I stood before her. She started
  to her feet, and a glad look of welcome shone for a moment in her face. Then
  she motioned me away with an angry exclamation. But I was reckless with my
  great love. I caught her in my arms and called her mine; dared her to say she
  did not love me, and with her heart beating wildly against mine, burst into a
  passionate, frenzied appeal. She listened to me in silence&mdash;then she
  drew away, and, covering her face with her hands, spoke in a low, troubled
  tone. Again she hinted at a disgraceful past, the shadows of which still
  enveloped her. She would tell me her history, she said, and then we must part
  for ever; but with a great oath I stopped her. Her past was nothing to me.
  Let it be as a sealed book between us. The future was only our concern, and
  without her mine would be a blank.</p>

  <p>Sinned against or sinning, rich or poor, of high or lowly birth, I cared
  not a whit. Let her come to me, and my love should shield her from all
  possible danger, and my name from a hateful past. In the end I prevailed, and
  with a choking cry of joy she threw herself into my arms, and when I left
  that night she was my affianced wife. Then was I the happiest man in the
  world, and full of unclouded bliss were the long days we dreamed away
  together, rowing about the lake, and holding fairy banquets in shady nooks or
  in out-of-the-way corners against the rushes. It was an idyllic courtship,
  ours; and it was to be a short one. In a month we were to be married.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>As August slipped away there came a cloud. Marguerite's =timer changed,
  and the old melancholy look returned at times to her face. I was nervous, and
  spoke of consulting a physician. It was pure morbidness, I assured her; and
  she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"In a week or two it will be over," she whispered; "until then, bear with
  me." But I was ill at ease and perplexed.</p>

  <p>On the last evening but two of the month she made a strange request. She
  bade me at parting not to come on the morrow. I laughed, and thought it a
  jest. As if I could stop away, for even a day! Impossible! Nevertheless, I
  did stay away until the evening. My lawyer, whom I had summoned to meet me at
  the hotel, arrived, and, until late in the day, we were busy putting my
  affairs in order and drawing up the settlements which I had decided to make
  upon my wife. After dinner, however, I was free, and, taking a boat, I rowed
  across the lake. It was a full moon, but every now and then thick black
  clouds, hurrying across the sky, marred its light, and the first part of my
  journey was performed in perfect darkness. As I neared the island, however,
  there was an interlude of light, and I could see, to my joy, Marguerite
  standing on the steps waving her hand to me. I shouted a welcome, and bent
  forward to take a deep, strong stroke, which should carry me to her side,
  when suddenly something rose up in the water between us, and I paused
  horror-struck, whilst the oars nearly slipped away from my nervous fingers. A
  man, only partly dressed, with a white, fiendish-looking face and staring
  black eyes, was swimming on his side towards me; and, as my eyes fell upon
  him, he seemed to raise himself out of the water, and, by the vivid light of
  the moon, I saw the blood streaming out from a wound in his throat. For a
  moment I shrank back, paralysed with fear, for the face was familiar to me. I
  could neither speak nor move while the boat drifted towards him. Then with an
  effort I rose in my seat, and, throwing out an oar, bade him seize it. He
  never stirred. I drew nearer to him, and at last stretched out my hand to
  drag him into the boat. Oh, the horror of that moment! I grasped but the air.
  I thought I had miscalculated the distance, and I tried again, but my hand
  passed through him, meeting with no resistance; then the horrible truth came
  to me like a flash. This was no human form. My blood seemed to freeze within
  me, and, shuddering, I drew back into the boat. Then there was a wild shriek
  from the bank which told me that Marguerite, too, had seen this thing, and I
  saw her fall in a swoon. In a moment I was myself again, and, seizing the
  oars, I made for the landing-stage and leapt on shore. As I hastily secured
  the boat, I glanced round once more. A thick cloud had sailed in front of the
  moon, and the water, which just before had been glittering and sparkling in
  the silver light, was black and sullen. I turned with a shudder to the land,
  and sprang to Marguerite's side.</p>

  <p>Lifeless, I carried her into the house, and for hours the old housekeeper
  and I tried by every means in our power to revive her. At last we were
  successful. She opened her eyes with a faint shiver, and then we carried her
  to her room. I spent the night in the garden, and by sunrise was by her side
  again. She was sleeping peacefully, so I left her undisturbed.</p>

  <p>Later on in the morning she sent for me. I shrank from mentioning the
  awful event of the previous evening. It was she who spoke of it first.
  Calmly, but with a steady resolution, she bade me leave her for ever. It must
  be, she said. She was a guilty woman, and must bear alone the consequences of
  her guilt. She commanded me to leave her.</p>

  <p>Then it was my turn to speak. My calmness and resolution matched hers. I
  refused emphatically to go. No matter her guilt, she had given herself to me,
  and, though she were steeped in crime, mine she should be. I wished to ask no
  questions; I desired no explanations; I simply demanded that she should keep
  her word.</p>

  <p>Then she was driven to her last resource. Bending close over me, she
  whispered that she was a murderess. I refused to believe it. She went on to
  tell me her story. She spoke first of her husband, and told me, what I
  already knew&mdash;told me that he had been an irreclaimable drunkard, who
  had made her life a continued martyrdom. He had squandered her money,
  insulted her, was notoriously unfaithful to her, and even descended to blows.
  Still she had endured, doing all a woman could do to reclaim him, and
  receiving in return fresh insults, fresh blows, and brutal jests from drunken
  lips. At last matters came to a crisis, not very long after my visit to them
  at Palermo. In the middle of a long summer's night he had come home drunk and
  staggered to her apartments. She refused him admission. He burst open the
  door. She sought to pass him and escape, but he prevented her. She wrenched
  herself from his grasp, but he struck her down; and when she arose, sought to
  embrace her with maudlin affection. Mad with fear and loathing, she snatched
  a fancy stiletto from the mantelpiece, and as his arms folded around her, she
  struck blindly at him. He fell to the ground gasping; he was stabbed in the
  throat.</p>

  <p>She rang the bell, and the servants came trooping in; a doctor was hastily
  summoned, and then with his last breath the dying man did the only good
  action of his wasted life.</p>

  <p>"I was mad when I did it," he gasped; "drunken fool that I was. I only
  meant to prick myself to frighten her," and he pointed to his trembling
  wife.</p>

  <p>The words were taken down, and the coroner's verdict of "Suicide when in a
  state of temporary insanity," was unanimous and unquestioned. Thus with his
  last words he had saved her, but the horrible part of the story had yet to
  come. Every year since his death, on that same date, the thirtieth of August,
  as if regretting the impulse which had prompted him to save her, he had come
  back and recalled to her all the hideous recollections of his death. The
  first time she had put it down to a morbid trick of her disordered
  imagination, and, not being superstitious, she had refused to lend credence
  even to her eyes. But the next year on the same date he had come again, and
  since then every year on the thirtieth of August he had appeared, remaining
  only a few minutes, and never speaking, but by his demoniacal visage keeping
  open the hated memory of the past. She had cut herself adrift from the world,
  and with an old housekeeper had buried herself in this lonely house; but life
  was a tedious task, and had she been able to summon the courage, she would
  have ended it by casting herself into the lake. Then I had strayed in upon
  her lonely existence, and for a short while she confessed that she had been
  able almost to forget the ban under which she lay, and had found life
  pleasant. But now it had all come back to her again. I knew her story, and I
  must go. Would I try to forget her?</p>

  <p>When she had finished her story, horrible though it was, I laughed. My
  love was so vehement that I never dreamt of giving her up. She shrank from me
  in wonderment, but I caught her in my arms, and swore that never, even at her
  command, would I leave her. She implored me to remember that evil deed of
  hers. I shook my head. It was an accident, unpremeditated, unintended. I
  refused to think of it. She bade me remember that hideous apparition and its
  yearly visits. I laughed to scorn the idea of fearing or shrinking from
  these. I was adamant.</p>

  <p>At last she yielded, and threw herself into my arms in a passionate fit of
  tears, but with joy and relief in her face. I felt at that moment I had never
  loved her before. She had seemed to me something almost unnatural; now by her
  tears she was a woman, and a woman after my own heart.</p>

  <p>I had won her, and in a month we were married. Marguerite seemed a
  different creature, and I was the happiest man on earth; but when the summer
  came round again, she altered, and when the thirtieth of August arrived she
  was pale and trembling. He came, and hand and hand we passed through the
  terrible ordeal. Then on the morrow we rose with lightened hearts, and looked
  forward to another year of happiness.</p>

  <p>Since then twelve summers have come and gone, and twelve times have we
  faced together that terrible apparition. I have fired pistol shots through
  it&mdash;in vain. I have spent the day on my knees at the altar (I am a Roman
  Catholic), but a sudden faintness has come over me. I have been carried
  outside, and when I have opened my eyes he has been there. I have spent the
  days in all manner of ways, surrounded by friends in the busiest haunts of
  London; but, though visible to us alone, he has come with a sneering smile on
  those death-white lips, as if mocking our efforts to escape. No art can evade
  him, no will elude him. While we live he will come to us, and now we are
  growing more resigned, and we meet him in solitude, encouraged, and consoled
  by one another's presence.</p>

  <p>Two children have we had, and both have died on the thirtieth of August;
  yet are we happy in the great love we have for one another, and happy shall
  we be till the end. And when the day of my death or hers shall come (God
  grant we may die together!), something tells me that it will be on that same
  date, the thirtieth of August.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>6.&mdash;WHO IS MISS BARTON?</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Matthew Ford was a solicitor of a type which seldom
  appear outside the pages of an old-fashioned novel, and which is generally
  supposed to be extinct. He was neither tall nor short, with grey whiskers and
  furrowed face. Summer and winter his attire was always of solemn black, and
  he wore the collars and had the manners of a past generation. Needless to
  say, he was a bachelor, and lived by rule. He was well off. His practice,
  though not large, was a very high-class one, and he had no anxiety to
  increase it. It had been his father's before him, and most of his clients had
  been clients, or were the sons of clients, of his late father. He was quite
  satisfied with his position; and certain it is that if any one ever lived a
  perfectly immaculate life, that person was Mr. Matthew Ford.</p>

  <p>Punctually at ten o'clock on a dull morning towards the end of December he
  was in his private office opening his letters, and methodically sorting them
  into separate piles. It was an apartment bare and somewhat cold-looking, but
  scrupulously clean and neat. One end was lined with a book-case, the titles
  of the contents of which were quite enough to make any ordinary man shiver,
  and the other with a regular assortment of black tin boxes, on which in white
  letters appeared the names of Mr. Ford's chief clients&mdash;and very good
  names they were. It might be said that Mr. Ford looked perfectly in accord
  with the apartment, and the apartment perfectly in accord with Mr. Ford. Both
  gave you the impression of scrupulous neatness, punctilious exactitude, and
  unimpeachable respectability. Such were the characteristics both of the room
  and its occupant.</p>

  <p>Just as Mr. Ford came to the end of his letters there was a tap at the
  door, and, in response to his "Come in," a grey-haired clerk entered and
  deferentially presented a card.</p>

  <p>There were no gay young sprigs in this office serving their articles. All
  the clerks were staid, respectable men, who received high wages, and, knowing
  when they were well off, kept their places. The one who stood before his
  master now could boast of twenty-seven years' faithful service.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Charles Cavenant, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Very good; you can show him in," replied Mr. Ford.</p>

  <p>The new arrival, when he had been somewhat ceremoniously ushered in,
  proved to be a very great contrast to the room and to its owner. Charlie
  Cavenant&mdash;a sub., twenty-two years old&mdash;was a tall, slender young
  man, with the fair face and laughing eyes of a boy. He was most correctly
  attired, and the smell of the gardenia in his coat was a strange one to
  permeate the musty room.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Ford!" he exclaimed in loud, hearty tones, as he drew off his
  sealskin glove and shook hands, a little patronizingly, with the lawyer.
  "You're pretty well?"</p>

  <p>"Much the same as usual, thank you, Mr. Charles. And you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm never anything else. Licks me how any one can keep well in this
  beastly hole, though!" he continued, glancing disparagingly around at the
  dingy walls and out into the narrow court. "Suppose it's use. Heard from the
  governor this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I had just finished reading a letter from Sir Charles as you came in. He
  wants me to go down to the Abbey to-morrow, and stay over Christmas Day."</p>

  <p>"He does I've heard from him myself this morning, and, according to
  instructions received&mdash;that's the legal way of putting it, isn't
  it?&mdash;I'm here to make sure of your going. He wants you to meet Okell,
  and have a chat about the lease and the Langdale property."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford considered for a minute or two.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Charles," he said, after a pause and a glance through the
  diary; "as your father wants me professionally, I shall go. Christmas
  festivities are not much in my line, however, and I'm afraid that I shall be
  somewhat out of place. But that must pass."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's going to be lots of fun; certain to be something that'll
  amuse you. We've got up some theatricals for to-morrow night; that'll be
  worth seeing; and there'll be lots of pretty girls there. It'll be a nice
  little change for you, Mr. Ford. Whit train shall you come down by?"</p>

  <p>"The five o'clock to-morrow afternoon. That is a fast train, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that'll do," replied young Mr. Cavenant rising and extending his
  small, shapely hand across the table. "I mist be off now, Good-morning, Mr.
  Ford. I think I shall run down tonight to finish the arrangements for those
  theatricals. By-the-by, should you care about taking a part? Put you in with
  a nice-looking girl."</p>

  <p>"By no means!" declared the lawyer, almost startled out of his composure
  at the bare idea. "Such a thing would be altogether out of my way. Certainly
  not."</p>

  <p>"Oh, just as you like. Thought perhaps you'd enjoy it. Good-morning;" and
  the young man sauntered out.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he muttered to himself, as he made his way into the street and
  turned westward. "I should like to jolly well stir that old buffer up; it'd
  do him no end of good. He always reminds me of something frozen."</p>

  <p>He paused and drew out a little memorandum-book. Yes, all his commissions
  were executed except one&mdash;a last visit to the costumiers, to finally
  inspect the costumes for the theatricals at Rolleston Abbey. He called a
  hansom and drove to Bond Street.</p>

  <p>Everything was most satisfactory. The costumes were ready to send, and the
  order had been carefully executed. He saw the labels written out, and then
  left the shop. He crossed the pavement, and was just stepping into the
  hansom, when a sudden idea struck him. He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he muttered. "I&mdash;I'm hanged if I don't do it!" and, with a
  hearty laugh, he turned and re-entered the shop.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Cavenant, of Rolleston Abbey, Leicestershire, was one of Mr.
  Ford's oldest and best clients, and a summons from him was not to be
  disregarded. Accordingly, at five minutes to five on the following afternoon,
  behold Mr. Ford comfortably ensconced in the corner seat of an empty
  first-class carriage, with a neat black portmanteau over his head, a rug
  round his knees, a pile of papers by his side, and a reading-lamp carefully
  adjusted in the window-ledge. The lawyer was old-fashioned in his ideas as
  regards railway travelling, and always greatly preferred a carriage to
  himself. The whistle sounded, and he was just congratulating himself upon
  having, by a judicious tip, secured the gratification of his whim, when the
  door was suddenly opened, the guard handed in a lady, and before Mr. Ford
  could open his mouth they were gliding out of St. Pancras station.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford was extremely annoyed. If there was one thing he feared and hated
  more than another it was travelling alone with a woman, and here he was
  locked up with one, at any rate, for an hour. He drew as far as possible back
  into his corner, pulled down his cap, and unfolded <i>The Times</i>. His
  reading did not progress, however for though he had never even glanced at his
  companion since her hurried entrance, he was somehow full of an uneasy
  consciousness that she was watching him. He frowned, tried to rid himself of
  the idea and devote his attention to the paper, but it was useless. He felt
  that he must raise his eyes, and at last he yielded and looked up. His
  suspicions were verified. His companion&mdash;quite a young lady she
  appeared, and most stylishly dressed&mdash;was not only watching him over the
  top of the <i>Queen</i>, but as she caught his glance, actually smiled.</p>

  <p>He turned his head away immediately; and, cold though the carriage was,
  the sweat nearly came to his forehead, and his hands trembled as he gazed
  fixedly at the legal column of The Times, and saw nothing but an inviting
  smile from a fair, mischievous face. Suppose she should speak to him! And
  scarcely had the dreadful idea occurred to him when she did.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think the ventilators must be open?" said a soft, silvery
  voice. "The carriage seems miserably cold."</p>

  <p><i>The Times</i> dropped from his trembling fingers, he rose without a
  word, and solemnly examined the panels over the windows. Then he resumed his
  seat and picked up The Times.</p>

  <p>"They are both closed," he said shortly, affecting all of a sudden to have
  found something deeply interesting in the paper. There was a short silence,
  and he began to breathe more freely. It was a very brief respite,
  however.</p>

  <p>"Is that paper very interesting, Mr. Ford?"</p>

  <p>He looked over its top, startled, not to say alarmed. She was leaning over
  her muff towards him with a most enchanting smile.</p>

  <p>"I was not aware that you knew me," he said, in his most legal tones. "I
  do not remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No! What a memory you must have, Mr. Ford!" she interrupted, "and a
  lawyer, too! Why, I thought they never forgot anything. I met you many years
  ago, I know, but I had hoped that you would not quite have forgotten me."</p>

  <p>This was worse than ever. Oh, why had he not got into the Pullman and
  escaped this? What on earth did this young lady mean by the stress on the
  "quite," and the reproachful look in her eyes? Surely she could not be going
  to make love to him! Good God! the very idea made him shiver.</p>

  <p>He picked up his paper again. "I think there must be some mistake," he
  said, as composedly as he could. "You appear to know my name, but I'm quite
  sure that I don't know yours. You must excuse me; talking in the train always
  makes my head ache, and my paper is, as you remarked, interesting;" and he
  plunged once more into it.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. The young lady did not speak again, and Mr. Ford
  went on with his reading; but he did not progress much. Again that uneasy
  feeling came to him that he was being watched, and that he must look up for a
  second.</p>

  <p>At last he could bear it no longer, and he glanced over the top of his
  paper. The young lady was gazing out of the window into the chaos of
  blackness, and, to his horror, he saw there were tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Despite his frosty coating, Mr. Ford was, after all, a man, and the sight
  of her tears changed his mood at once. Perhaps, after all, he should scarcely
  have been so brusque. He would make amends.</p>

  <p>"Would you care to see the <i>Graphic</i>?" he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>The young lady hurriedly wiped her eyes and turned round. There was a
  constrained look in her face, as if she had been struggling to restrain some
  emotion&mdash;evidently grief&mdash;and the lawyer felt quite
  compunctious.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said gratefully, "but reading makes my eyes ache so. The
  light is bad, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is, very bad," he assented.</p>

  <p>"Now, if talking didn't make your head ache so," she remarked archly, "I
  should very much prefer a chat. You actually don't remember me?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer began to feel uneasy again.</p>

  <p>"I really cannot for the moment," he began. "And you don't remember my
  name, then, I suppose&mdash;Miss Barton, Ella Barton?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, bewildered. "I'm quite convinced," he began, but she
  interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't feel much flattered," she declared. "Fancy your forgetting!
  Men are all alike, I suppose. I wonder if you are married yet?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he said emphatically. "I shouldn't think of doing such a
  thing."</p>

  <p>She threw herself back among the cushions and laughed merrily. Certainly
  she did look most bewitching, and the old lawyer felt very much like a
  thaw.</p>

  <p>"And your sister Charlotte&mdash;does she still keep house for you?"</p>

  <p>Really this young lady's knowledge of his affairs was most astounding!</p>

  <p>"Yes," he assented. "May I ask, do you know her too?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've met her once or twice," acknowledged the young lady, with a
  saucy twinkle in her blue eyes; "but I didn't get on very well with her. I
  don't think she likes young ladies, does she?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford actually smiled a grim smile.</p>

  <p>"She does not; neither do I."</p>

  <p>The young lady looked at him distressed. He hesitated, and was lost.</p>

  <p>"As a rule," he added. She looked up radiant. They reached Bedford, but
  Mr. Ford had abandoned his idea of exchanging carriages. He even glared most
  ferociously at a young man who looked like entering and inquired of his
  companion whether he could get her a cup of tea&mdash;an offer which she
  refused.</p>

  <p>When they had started again, she rose.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to sit opposite you," she said; "I feel miles away over here;"
  and, dragging her rug after her, she took the seat directly opposite him.</p>

  <p>For the first time he had a good look at her, and she cast her eyes down
  modestly.</p>

  <p>"Your face seems familiar to me, somehow," he said meditatively.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must be thankful for small mercies from you, evidently. I'm glad
  you recollect me just a little. Perhaps next time we meet you won't be so
  forgetful, for I'm going to 'stop at Rolleston Abbey, and so, I suppose, are
  you. Jolly, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford made an indefinite reply. This young lady was too much for him,
  after all, and his nervousness suddenly returned in full force. He caught
  hold of his paper, and devoted a desperate amount of attention to the list of
  marriages and births. In less than a minute he felt an electric shock thrill
  through him. A tiny soft hand had caught hold of his, and the paper was
  gently taken away from him.</p>

  <p>"You're not to read any more, please, Mr. Ford; you're to talk to me. It's
  so dull, and I can't read by this light."</p>

  <p>The blue eyes looked at him pleadingly, and Mr. Ford began to feel a very
  pleasant sense of thawing as he suffered the paper to be taken from him.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid&mdash;" he began nervously. "You see, I'm not used to talking
  to young ladies, and I think I'd rather read," stretching his hand out for
  the paper.</p>

  <p>"But I don't please;" and the paper was laughingly withheld from him. "Now
  tell me how long you're going to stop at Rolleston Abbey."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford heaved a deep sigh, and yielded. He made spasmodic efforts at
  conversation, but his companion was an adept, and was quite content to let
  him play the part of admiring listener, which he did to perfection. Not at
  all unpleasant did he find the latter part of that journey, and when they ran
  into Leicester station, he took out his watch with a start.</p>

  <p>"Bless me! I'd no idea we were anywhere near yet," he exclaimed, springing
  up and collecting his things. "Can I look after your luggage, Miss
  Barton?"</p>

  <p>A groom from the Abbey was on the platform, and hurried up to them. Miss
  Barton turned and asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would see after my luggage, Mr. Ford," she said gratefully.
  "Burditt says that the brougham and the dogcart are here. If I could leave
  you to find my luggage and bring it on the brougham, and take the dogcart
  myself, I should be so much obliged. I told you about those horrid
  theatricals to-night, didn't I? I'm so nervous about them, and it will take
  me hours and hours to get ready. Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>Of course he did not; so Miss Barton hurried out into the yard and
  clambered up into the dogcart.</p>

  <p>"Drive like blazes, Tom!" were her somewhat unladylike instructions to the
  man. He grinned and obeyed. In little over twenty minutes the five-mile drive
  was over.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford, in the brougham laden with luggage, was quite half an hour
  behind, but he was greeted warmly on his arrival by Sir Charles and his
  son.</p>

  <p>It must be confessed that the lawyer dressed for dinner that night with
  just a little more care than usual, and was more than a little disappointed
  not to see his travelling companion either in the drawing-room or at dinner.
  His appetite was not so good as usual, and he was a little restless during
  the meal.</p>

  <p>"Had a pleasant journey, Mr. Ford?" inquired Charles Cavenant from the
  other side of the tale.</p>

  <p>"Yes, thanks. By-the-by," he added, with elaborate carelessness, "I had a
  companion, a young lady who was coming here too. Miss Barton, I think her
  name was. Who is Miss Barton?"</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. The lawyer looked round in surprise. Sir Charles
  was palpably smiling, and Lady Cavenant's face was buried in her
  handkerchief. Several of the men were examining their plates very closely,
  and among the younger portion of the guests there was a universal titter.
  What could there be in this bare mention of his most agreeable travelling
  companion to cause this sensation? The lawyer turned a dull brick red, and
  longed for some one to change the subject.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Ford," said Sir Charles at last. "You asked me who
  Miss Barton was? You will meet her at the theatricals after dinner."</p>

  <p>Two or three people began talking all at once, and the lawyer remained
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately after dinner, an adjournment was made to the picture
  gallery to witness the theatricals. Mr. Ford was given one of the foremost
  seats, but Miss Barton did not appear, and the performance seemed to him a
  trifle wearisome. He had even ventured upon a yawn, and was thinking
  regretfully of the cosy smoking-room, when, all of a sudden, he had a great
  surprise. There was a stage entrance. Miss Barton, dressed exactly as she had
  appeared during the journey, had swept upon the boards. The lawyer was
  mystified, and glanced at his programme. There was the explanation&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Miss Barton&mdash;Mr. Charles Cavenant."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ford turned furiously red. He knew that every one was looking at him,
  and glanced up Yes, he was the observed of ail; but there was a half-amused,
  half-anxious look upon their faces, as if they were somewhat fearful how he
  would take the joke. He hesitated, felt desperately angry, then desperately
  foolish, and finally relieved every one's apprehensions by leaning back in
  his chair and laughing heartily.</p>

  <p>"He took it like a perfect old brick," declared Charlie afterwards in the
  smoke-room.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Apr 1901</h3>

  <p class="first">I have lately read in one of our popular magazine a story
  which, for certain reasons, has had a peculiar and fascinating interest for
  me. Its author (I know not who he may be) and I have some thing together in
  common. We have both been brought into immediate connection with phenomenal
  circumstances and powers which neither science, nor nature, nor philosophy
  can account for, and whose origin we shrink' from speculating upon. He has
  been bold, and has told his marvellous story reckless of disbelief or
  ridicule. Why should I not gain courage from his example and relieve myself
  from the secret which for thirty years has hovered over me like a hideous
  nightmare&mdash;often thrust aside, it is true, but ever and anon returning
  and forcing my unwilling remembrance back to the period of my brief contact
  with things which assuredly are not of this world? As I sit here writing
  these lines, prepared to draw aside the curtain from that hitherto jealously
  concealed chapter of my life, I could almost fancy that it were days instead
  of years which separate me from it. The shrinking dread which those feel who,
  like myself and the author of the story to which I have previously alluded,
  have been brought into undesired and undesirable communion with things
  supernatural, is a sensation which time can never lessen nor efface. I am
  fifty-eight years old, an honest God-fearing man, ashamed to look no man in
  the face, and conscious of no wrong doing; and yet there is a recollection of
  one night in my life which, when it chooses to come and haunt me, can bring
  the cold sweat to my forehead and shake with a nervous trembling my strong
  limbs. Save but for this one flaw, my life is a happy one, as well it may be.
  My wife is loving and devoted; my children are what I would have them be; I
  am rich; I have strong interests in life, and I am not without friends whose
  esteem and regard are precious to me. Could I but rid myself of this haunting
  shadow which at times darkens my life, I should style myself a happy man; and
  it is in the hope that, by sharing my secret with the world it will lose some
  of its terrors for me, that I am about to reveal an occurrence'. which I have
  kept jealously locked in my breast for well-nigh thirty years.</p>

  <p>My name is John Tregarron, and at the time to which I am about to allude I
  was in my twenty-eighth year&mdash;a young man of sound constitution and
  moderate habits. I was an orphan, but a rich on and I had just been returned
  to Parliament as the representative of my native town. Modesty would forbid
  my entering into an exhaustive analysis of my character, even were it
  necessary, which it is not. I need only say that I was utterly devoid of
  imagination, and prided myself chiefly upon my stern common sense. If at any
  time any one had told me the story which I am about to relate, I should
  without doubt have considered him insane. Neither solemn affirmations or any
  amount of circumstantial evidence would have induced me to believe it. As a
  rigid materialist I should have scoffed at the idea of accepting as a fact
  that which was utterly irreconcilable with our present conditions of
  existence. Many will do this when they read my simple unvarnished narration
  of an event which befell me. I cannot help that. I am an inexperienced
  writer, and I cannot summon to my aid words of eloquence or use the other
  arts of practised writers who seek to win the credence of their readers. But
  I can set down simply and in as few words as possible what happened to me on
  the 13th of November, 1878, between the hours of half-past three and four
  o'clock in the morning. Those who scoff may scoff. I shall not hear them, and
  at any rate it will be some relief to feel that my secret has gone from
  me.</p>

  <p>On the date which I have mentioned I left the House of Commons, after a
  long and dreary debate, at a few minutes past three o'clock. I had a cup of
  coffee, and then, feeling the want of a little exercise after the long
  confinement, I started to walk to my lodgings in Mayfair.</p>

  <p>It must have been nearly ten minutes past three, when I left St.
  Stephen's, and it was barely four when I was carried into my rooms. During
  that time, by the means of powers the nature of which I shudder to reflect
  upon, I had performed a journey of something like fifteen hundred miles! Ah!
  I can well imagine the incredulous lifting of the eyebrows, and the "pshaw"
  of, I fear, the majority of my readers. And yet, while it is an indubitable
  fact, which my landlady and many others could prove, that I was in London
  during the small hours of that hateful morning, I could yet bring forward
  incontestable evidence that I was also in Italy.</p>

  <p>I walked briskly along through the empty streets, smoking a cigar and
  enjoying the cool air. As I turned into Belton Street my stick caught in a
  grating and slipped from my fingers. I stopped to pick it up, and then
  straightened myself in order to proceed on my way. I had not taken a step
  forwards, however, when I perceived that a sudden strange metamorphosis had
  taken place in my surroundings. I staggered backwards dazed, bewildered,
  alarmed. Had I suddenly gone mad, or was I in the agonies of some torturing
  nightmare? Belton Street, with its rows of red brick houses, its broad
  pavements, and its dull gas-lamps, was gone. I stood in a narrow stone alley
  (it was not wide enough to be called a street), terminating in front of me
  with a high wall, on either side of which, however, were rows of grey stone
  crumbling steps, leading I could not see whither. There was a statue of some
  dull glittering metal at the foot of each flight, and the figures, which
  leaned crouching over towards me, with the Roman broadsword threateningly
  extended, seemed weirdly human in the uncertain moonlight. I myself was in
  the shadow of a vast grey stone building of architecture strange to me, and a
  clumsily-built balcony jutting out above my head threw a slanting shade upon
  the ground beneath, deepening the obscurity in which I stood. It seemed to me
  that the warm odorous air was richer and softer than any which I had breathed
  before, and the moon shone with a mellow golden light in a sky the like of
  which has assuredly never stretched its glittering arc over the smoky
  metropolis.</p>

  <p>At first I thought that this must be some wonderful vision, which would
  fade away directly, and leave me free to pursue my way down Belton Street; so
  I held my breath and waited. Before long, however, I knew that it was no
  vision, but a drama in which I should be called upon to play a part; and
  while I hugged the shadows of that grim dark palace the <i>personnel</i>
  commenced to show themselves. A clumsily-built coach, drawn by a pair of
  horses, whose hoofs, shod with some soft material, gave no notice of their
  approach, drew up at the head of the little street, and two men descended.
  They stood full in the moonlight for a moment, and I saw them distinctly.
  They were dressed after the fashion of some southern nation, and were
  apparently master and servant. He who appeared to be the former was a tall
  dark man, of olive complexion, and with big dark eyes. A long cloak enveloped
  him from head to foot, and from underneath it peeped the scabbard of a sword.
  The other man was shorter and stouter, with curled black mustachios and
  jaunty air; his person, too, was disguised by a long cloak.</p>

  <p>After a few words with the coachman, the two men turned away and plunged
  into the shadows of the street of which I was an unwilling occupant. Almost
  exactly opposite to me they halted, and although I have never considered
  myself a coward, I shrank back against the wall, trembling as though I had
  been seized with an ague. They talked for a moment or two in a low tone, and
  in a strange tongue. Then the shorter man began to hum an opera tune, for
  which his master sharply reproved him. After that there was a deep silence,
  we were all three apparently waiting for something. I shrank from hazarding
  the merest conjecture as to what that something might be; but I could tell
  from the attitude of my opposite neighbours that they were watching the
  steps. Unconsciously my gaze followed theirs. Intuitively I was assured that
  the actors in the next scene of the drama which was unfolding itself before
  me would make their entrance from that.</p>

  <p>At last they came&mdash;an old man and a girl, followed by a manservant
  carrying a lantern, appeared on the top of the steps; and commenced the
  descent. As distinctly as if it had been the noonday sun, the brilliant moon
  showed me the gentle refined face of the old white-haired man, and disclosed
  to me the features of the most radiantly beautiful woman whom I have ever
  seen in real life or on canvas. I am not attempting to write a descriptive
  story, for which indeed I have neither the aptitude nor the ability, so I
  will say no more about her save that her face, as she slowly descended the
  crumbling steps, seemed to me as the face of an angel.</p>

  <p>They approached the spot where the double ambush lay concealed, the old
  man talking concernedly in somewhat faulty English.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange, Carissima, that so suddenly poor Pietro should find
  himself worse. I trust&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The tragedy had begun. In less than a moment the man-servant was lying
  senseless, upon the ground, and the old man was struggling in the grasp of
  the stouter of the two men. His master had seized the girl round the waist,
  and, with one hand over her mouth, was striving to drag her towards the
  carriage.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Trembling and speechless, pale with a fear which was scarcely cowardice, I
  remained without moving, my fascinated eyes rivetted upon the little group.
  They were clear of the shadows, and the expression on the faces of each,
  photographed in my memory with a hideous accuracy, seemed ghost-like and
  unearthly in the pale moonlight. In the old man's face anger and indignation
  shone, but there was no fear, although his struggles to free himself were
  utterly impotent. Passion, wild, mad passion, was blazing in the dark eyes,
  and convulsing the pale face of the taller man, as he strove in rapid words
  of persuasion to induce his prisoner to accompany him to the carriage. In her
  face aversion and hatred were blended with fear, as she struggled to release
  herself, and as he scanned her face with a hungry longing glance his grew
  simply demoniacal. He cried out something to his companion, who nodded and
  drew his sword, as if about to run the old man through The girl saw the
  motion, and, with a wild horror-stricken look redoubled her frantic
  endeavours to break loose. The sword appeared about to be plunged into the
  old man's body, when suddenly my statue-like condition seemed to leave me,
  and the warmth of life returned as if by magic. With one stride I was in the
  middle of the little group, the stout ruffian's sword was whirling twenty
  feet high in the air, and he himself senseless on the ground, from a blow
  with my clenched fist.</p>

  <p>Again I carry in my mind a vivid photograph of the tableau which for a
  second or two existed. Opposite to me stood the girl, released from the rough
  grasp of her captor, her full lips trembling with emotion, and her glorious
  eyes full of a sudden hope, and already telling me their tale of gratitude.
  Almost by her side was her father, gazing at me astonished and open-mouthed,
  and a little to the left was the taller man, his head, out of which his black
  eyes were leaping with wild demoniacal fury, thrust slightly forward towards
  me, and his hand slowly drawing his sword from the scabbard. A tigress who
  has seen her cubs slain before her eyes, and who has now the slayer within
  her reach, might have looked thus as she crouched for the spring.</p>

  <p>I stooped and picked up the sword which had fallen at my feet. Still no
  one spoke or moved. The tableau was broken up at last by the sound of
  advancing footsteps, and I saw that the coachman had left his horses and was
  hurrying towards us.</p>

  <p>"Take her away!" I cried to the old man. "Take her back at once," and I
  pointed to the steps.</p>

  <p>"But you, sir, whom God&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind me. You can bring help."</p>

  <p>They moved a step away, and their late assailant literally sprang upon
  them. I stepped between, our swords dashed together, and his progress was
  arrested.</p>

  <p>I had learnt fencing when a boy, and it had always been a favourite
  exercise with me, but my present adversary was far superior in skill to any
  with whom I had tried conclusions. Had he been cool, I should have been a
  dead man in less than a minute; but he was blind with rage and fury, and came
  at me wildly. At his third thrust I felt a sharp stinging pain in my left
  arm, and knew that his sword had entered it. There was a cry of agony from
  the steps.</p>

  <p>"Father, I will go to him! Shall we leave him there to die, when he has
  saved our lives?"</p>

  <p>What followed is the most miserable part of my story, but surely there are
  excuses for what I did. The instinct of fencing, self-defence, the only
  half-developed consciousness that I was playing a material part in a real
  tragedy&mdash;these all I can plead as my excuses. What happened was really
  this. My assailant in his eager thrust had left his own person undefended. I
  ran my sword through him to the hilt. There was another cry from the girl. I
  stood stupefied, watching the drops of blood fall from the end of my sword to
  the pavement, and the ghastly shade of death pass over the face of the man
  whom I had killed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Then I heard rapid words in my ear, and, looking up, found the girl by my
  side.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, you must fly at once!" She produced a lace handkerchief from her
  pocket, and commenced rapidly binding up my arm. "He deserved it," she said,
  glancing with a shudder to where the dead man lay; "but he is the nephew of
  the Cardinal, and you must fly. You have saved me from death, and my father
  too. Tell me your name?"</p>

  <p>"John Tregarron."</p>

  <p>"Ah! and mine is&mdash;" she broke off, and listened. "The guards are
  coming!" she exclaimed. "That coachman must have fetched them. I must go; and
  you, too. Oh, hurry!"</p>

  <p>"And your name is?" I asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>A buzzing in my ears, blank darkness before my eyes! and an excruciating
  pain in my left arm.</p>

  <p>"And your name is?" I repeated, feebly.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Emerson said you must keep quiet and not disturb yourself."</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes, I was in my own bedroom, with my landlady one side of
  the bed and the doctor the other.</p>

  <p>"How long have I been here, and what is the time?" I inquired. Had it all
  been a dream after all?</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You were found lying in Belton Street, with a stab in the left arm, and
  quite unconscious, at half-past three. A cabman brought you here. It is now
  five o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Was I alone? Was any one found with me?"</p>

  <p>"You were quite alone; and, of course, as soon as you are in a fit state
  to give information, the police will endeavour to find the person who
  assaulted you. Here was a foreign-made sword by your side, and your hand was
  bound up in a lady's lace handkerchief."</p>

  <p>"Where is the handkerchief?" I asked.</p>

  <p>It was given me; a delicate little piece of cambric and lace, stained and
  clotted with blood. In one coiner were the initials.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Burditt, listen to me," I said, turning to my landlady. "If I'm
  going to be ill, I insist upon it that this handkerchief is kept exactly as
  it is. Put it in my drawer there, and don't touch it again. That's right. Now
  I'm going to sleep."</p>

  <p>It was three months before I left my room, a broken-down wreck of a man.
  To the police I declared that the brain fever, which had laid such grim hold
  on me that I had nearly died, had driven from my mind all recollections of
  the events of that night. How false! The merest incident of it then, as now,
  was engraven deep upon my memory, and chief amongst those memories was the
  divine face of the girl whom I had befriended.</p>

  <p>I accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, and renounced the career which a short
  while ago had absorbed my every interest; then I left for the Continent, for
  I decided that Italy should be the scene of my quest, heedless that I ran
  every risk, if my description was published, of being arrested as a murderer.
  Two months I spent in exploring the towns of northern Italy&mdash;in vain. At
  last I came to Florence, and beginning my search in the most out-of-the-way
  parts, as was my wont, on the evening of my second day's stay, there I stood
  again beneath that stone balcony, and the whole scene seemed to rise once
  more before me. I mounted the grey stone steps, and gazed at the brazen
  statues with a peculiar fascination. The whole scene was calm and peaceful
  now in the soft sunlight, and none would have thought that so lately it had
  witnessed a ghostly tragedy. At a particular spot I paused, and looked down
  on the stone flags. Yes, it was there&mdash;a great stain of blood only half
  effaced.</p>

  <p>My guide, who had doubtless been wondering at the interest which the
  little Place possessed for me, now shrugged his shoulders and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Monsieur is looking at those marks of blood. Doubtless he has heard
  of the romantic affair which took place here nearly six months ago?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head, and he proceeded:</p>

  <p>"There is one of our Florentine noblemen, the Count di Fiolessi, who has a
  palazzo not far from the top of those steps. He married an Englishwoman, and
  has a very beautiful daughter, with whom a young Florentine, Signor Mulazzi,
  fell desperately in love. He was a very strange young man; in fact, I have
  heard that he was downright mad. Anyhow, the young lady would have nothing to
  do with him. Well, he laid a very deep plot to carry her off one night. He
  sent a message to the Count di Fiolessi at three o'clock in the morning,
  purporting to come from the Count's brother, who lives but a little distance
  off, and who is an invalid. The message declared that he was dying, and
  summoned the Count and Signorina Adrienne to his bedside. They got up, and,
  attended by a single servant, started off. When they reached this little
  Place, Signor Mulazzi and a hired ruffian pounced upon them. The servant-man
  was thrown down and half-murdered, Signorina Adrienne was being dragged off,
  and her father would have been killed, when a most extraordinary thing
  happens. An Englishman of gigantic stature springs from the Lord knows where,
  knocks the ruffian down with a blow of his fist, which nearly kills him,
  takes his sword, and finally runs Signor Milani, who was one of the best
  swordsmen in Florence, through the body. When the guard came up, Mulazzi was
  dead, and the Englishman had gone, and has never been heard of from that day
  to this. A strange story, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very strange, and this Englishman&mdash;do they still look for him?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; the affair was all hushed up. The outrage which he had attempted
  diverted all sympathy from Mulazzi, and no one but Count di Fiolessi has
  attempted to find the Englishman. On the first day there was a reward
  offered, but it was cancelled directly the Count had given his evidence."</p>

  <p>"We will go back to the hotel," I said abruptly. "I have seen enough for
  to-day."</p>

  <p>I hung about Florence for a week, restless and undecided. Then, as the sun
  was sinking behind the hills one evening, I mounted the steps, and presented
  myself at the Palazzo Fiolessi. A tall servant led me through many anterooms
  and long marble corridors, until we came to a small sitting-room, furnished
  almost in the English fashion. The occupants were on the balcony, and leaving
  me in the middle of the room, the servant advanced to the window and
  announced "Signor Tregarron."</p>

  <p>I will pass over the greeting I received, and the months which I spent at
  the Palazzo Fiolessi, and at the Count's villa near Rome. I am making a
  confession&mdash;not writing a love story. It was agreed between us that the
  events which had brought us together should never be mentioned. They were
  full of painful memories to all of us&mdash;to me they were more than
  painful; but for a while, in the delirium of my love, I was able to escape
  from all thoughts save of Adrienne. Least of all had I thoughts of troubles
  on one soft balmy night, when, as we all three sat in the grounds of the
  Roman villa after a day of dreamy happiness, Adrienne whispered the one word
  which was needed to complete my felicity. Then I took her hand and led her to
  the Count, and he blessed us.</p>

  <p>"My son," he cried. "This is what I have prayed for! Bless you both, my
  children!"</p>

  <p>He went indoors, for he was overcome. But Adrienne and I wandered across
  the smooth lawn, and amongst the marble statuettes, and hand-in-hand we
  watched the golden light from the full southern moon reflected in the dark
  waters of the Tiber flowing below us, and shining upon the vineyards which
  covered the slopes on the other side. Ah, life was very beautiful then!</p>

  <p>I have finished my story. I have given a plain unvarnished account of that
  night's adventure, during which powers unknown to us in this stage of our
  existence revealed themselves to me. I do not expect to gain universal
  credence. But I have won relief for myself. My heart is light again as I read
  these words through and know that soon my secret will be a secret no
  longer&mdash;and&mdash;Adrienne calls me. I must go.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Sileby Grange had received a guest, and old Joseph, the
  butler, heedless of his rheumatics and the cold east wind, hurried out on to
  the broad steps to receive him in person, for Gordon Crawford was a general
  favourite and a frequent visitor.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Joseph? Glad to see you!" exclaimed a tall young man, as
  he sprang down from the dog-cart and walked lightly up the steps. "All well,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes thank you, sir," replied the old man respectfully. "I'm afraid
  there's no one in just now, though," he added apologetically. "They didn't
  expect you quite so soon, and Mr. Dudley he's gone over to Harborough, to see
  about getting the stage fixed for the theatricals."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Carr in?" inquired the young man, divesting himself of his ulster
  and leisurely drawing off his gloves.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. She's gone out to pay some calls, and Mr. Willie and the other
  gentlemen are out after the hounds. Howsomever, they'll be home by the time
  you've changed your things, sir. Will you take anything, Mr. Crawford? A cup
  of tea, or a brandy and seltzer?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. By-the-by, Joseph, is Miss Allnut stopping here?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. There's several of them come on purpose for the theatricals.
  Miss Botsworth's here too, and Dr. Thomson and another young gentleman from
  Sorchester. Miss Allnut's in the study now, sir, if you'd like to see her;
  leastways, I mean the library."</p>

  <p>The information seemed to please Mr. Gordon Crawford.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in and see her," he exclaimed with alacrity. "No, you needn't
  trouble to announce me," he added hastily, as Joseph turned away with that
  intention. "I'm going round by the terrace. Have my traps sent up, there's a
  good fellow, and some hot water. I shan't be more than a minute or two."</p>

  <p>Joseph turned away with a quiet chuckle. "I allus thought he was rare
  sweet on Miss Allnut," he ruminated. "That's what he's come back for, of
  course;" and he descended to the lower regions to impart this delightful
  gossip to his better half.</p>

  <p>Gordon Crawford walked quietly down the wide hall, passed through a
  conservatory, and stepped out on to a terrace, which ran along the side of
  the house. Outside the high French windows of the library he paused and
  looked eagerly in. This is what he saw.</p>

  <p>A girl stood on the hearthrug in the act of indulging in a merry laugh.
  Her small but well-poised head was thrown back and the merriment was shining
  out of her eyes as well as asserting itself from her lips. She was petite in
  stature, but her figure was lithe and exquisitely graceful. Her features,
  though not of classical regularity, were clearly cut and of good type, and
  the bright, piquant expression which animated her face and shone out of her
  blue eyes redeemed her face from the mediocrity of good looks, and made her
  appear irresistibly charming. He watched her for a moment with a pleased,
  happy smile of anticipation, and then raised his hand to knock at the window.
  A movement within the room, however, arrested him, and he remained watching.
  A tall, athletic-looking man in scarlet hunting-coat and tops, splashed from
  head to foot, and evidently just returned from the hunt, had moved to her
  side, and, leaning against the mantelpiece, begun talking earnestly. Her
  laugh died away, and she glanced downwards to where her tiny foot was tracing
  out the pattern of the hearthrug. He moved closer still, and continued
  talking more emphatically than ever, apparently gaining boldness from his
  companion's confusion. He took her hand unchidden, passed his arm round her
  waist, and her sudden joyful cry of "Lionel! dearest Lionel!" penetrated
  through the closed windows. With a barely repressed groan and a white, set
  face, the watcher on the terrace moved away.</p>

  <p>Six months ago Gordon Crawford had met Edith Allnut at this same house. He
  was not a man who, as a rule, contracted sudden likes or dislikes, but in
  less than a week he was hopelessly in love. Her lively conversation and;
  bewitching manners had at first attracted, then completely enslaved him, and
  for a while he lived in a fool's paradise. Then his sense of honour brought
  him a rude awakening. A slight change in her manner, the frequent aversion of
  her blue eyes, which had formerly met him so frankly and fearlessly, warned
  him that unless he wished to behave like a brute he must be gone. Marriage
  was an impossibility for him. He was a well-nigh briefless barrister, without
  fortune, influence, or prospects, and life as it was somewhat of a
  struggle. Under such circumstances, even an engagement was out of the
  question.</p>

  <p>He had met her in the garden on the morning of his departure, and had
  taken leave of her there.</p>

  <p>"You are going away sooner than you intended, Mr. Crawford," she remarked,
  looking away from him.</p>

  <p>He laughed a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I fear that I have taken too long a holiday already," he replied. "I am a
  poor man, you know, Miss Allnut, and life is not tennis and shooting to
  me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is it so hard a thing to be poor, then?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I begin to realize that it is," he said; and, fearful of saying too much,
  he said no more.</p>

  <p>They turned towards the house, and the bright expression had vanished for
  a while from her face.</p>

  <p>"Well, since you must go, Mr. Crawford, goodbye;" and she held out a
  little white hand. He took it, and gazed into her eyes. What he read there he
  never told any one, but he went back to his chambers and worked as he had
  never worked before.</p>

  <p>Barely six months had passed, when an event happened which considerably
  changed the tenor of his life. His father had died some ten years back, a
  poor man, ruined through heavy investments in some silver mines, and his sole
  legacy to his son had been the worthless scrip. One evening, whilst Gordon
  sat alone in his chambers, idly glancing through the columns of the Globe, a
  startling announcement attracted his attention.</p>

  <p>There had been a great find of silver in a Californian mine, the name of
  which seemed familiar to him. Half dazed, he caught up his hat and hurried
  out with the paper in his hand. All the way down the Strand the name rang in
  his ears, shouted out by eager newsboys, and stared him in the face from
  placards and posters. At Charing Cross he ran against his stockbroker, the
  mail whom he most desired to see. In a moment the glad tidings were
  confirmed. He was a rich man.</p>

  <p>Almost the first to congratulate him was his old friend, Dudley Carr, whom
  he ran against coming out of a costumier's in Bond Street. The two men dined
  and spent the evening together.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd come down and spend a day or two with us, old man," Dudley
  had said, as they parted. "We're getting up some theatricals that'll be
  rather fun, and your old flame, Miss Allnut, is stopping with us. Come down
  to-morrow, do."</p>

  <p>The invitation was exactly what Gordon Crawford desired, and accordingly
  on the very next day he had followed his friend down to Sileby Grange.</p>

  <p>He was a man of strong nature, and his penchant for Edith Allnut had been
  no passing fancy. His first thought when he realized his wealth had been of
  her, and his first throb of joy had been caused by the reflection that he
  might now seek to win her. He had hurried down to Sileby Grange full of hope
  and delirious happiness, and he had arrived just in time to see her in
  another man's arms, and hear her lips utter caressingly another man's name.
  What a fool he had been, and what a flirt she was!</p>

  <p>Soon Dudley, all over white and sawdust, came hurrying up from the scene
  of his labours, and welcomed his guest heartily. Then Mrs. Carr, his mother,
  returned, and presently Edith appeared. She welcomed him almost shyly, and
  there was a subdued, half-conscious light in her eyes, which puzzled him. He
  muttered a stereotyped answer to her little speech, cursing her the while
  under his breath for a flirt, and then turned coldly away to continue his
  conversation with Mrs. Carr.</p>

  <p>During dinner he sat glum and silent, eating scarcely anything and
  drinking a great deal more than usual. Opposite him sat Miss Allnut, with an
  unusual colour in her cheeks and a brilliant sparkle in her eyes, talking
  with reckless gaiety to her right-hand neighbour, whom Crawford easily
  recognized as her red-coated cavalier. Afterwards, when Dudley rose and
  proposed joining the ladies, he flatly refused to enter the drawing-room, and
  persuaded good-natured old Colonel Josser to accompany him into the
  billiard-room. For a while they were alone, but suddenly, when they were in
  the midst of the third game, there was the sound of merry voices and
  footsteps outside, and the door was burst open.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to disturb you fellows," Dudley cried out, "but we want to have a
  rehearsal here. No, don't go away, Gordon, there's a good fellow. We want you
  to play the part of criticizing audience. You're a dab hand at this sort of
  thing, you know;" and very unwillingly Gordon Crawford resumed his seat on a
  lounge, and took up a paper. He listened to Dudley's coaching, to the merry
  laughter and badinage, and he felt very sore. Despite his efforts, he could
  not keep his eyes from following Edith, as, clad in a demi-toilet of soft
  black lace, which hung gracefully around her supple figure, she moved
  brightly about, the centre of all the mirth. Bah! how happy they all were,
  and how miserable he was! Suddenly he started, and the paper fell from his
  hand. He leaned forward, with eyes riveted upon the little group.</p>

  <p>Miss Allnut and Mr. Scott (the man whom he had seen with her in the
  library) were alone on the pretended stage. He advanced towards her, leaned
  over the back of the chair, and made an ardent speech; moved closer still,
  and finally, in conventional terms, made her a proposal of marriage. She
  blushed, looked down, and accepted him, whispering "Dearest Lionel!" He put
  his arm around her waist, and then, just as the infuriated guardian entered,
  Dudley stopped the scene.</p>

  <p>"It won't do at all," he declared. "Scott, my dear fellow, you'll excuse
  me, but you must improve in this scene. You're fearfully stiff, and
  Harborough audiences are critical, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"I'm beastly sorry," declared Mr. Scott ruefully. "I'm an awful duffer at
  this sort of thing, I know. Miss Allnut was good enough to rehearse with me
  this afternoon in the library, but she couldn't help laughing at me. I can't
  seem to get into it, somehow."</p>

  <p>"It must be improved upon," Dudley exclaimed decidedly, "or it will spoil
  the piece. Come, let's try again."</p>

  <p>"I say, look here," said Scott, turning round eagerly. "There's your
  friend, Mr. Crawford; he's a dab at acting, you say. Perhaps he would take
  this part. Pitcher's quite as much as I can manage comfortably. Would you
  mind, Mr. Crawford?" he added. "I can assure you that I should take it as a
  special favour," he declared earnestly.</p>

  <p>Miss Allnut drew herself up and frowned, but she caught a sudden appealing
  glance from Gordon Crawford and was silent.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very happy indeed," he assented, "if Mr. Scott really wishes
  it."</p>

  <p>"That's capital," pronounced Dudley, rubbing his hands with pleasure.
  "Here, Gordon, take my book and read your part over with Miss Allnut while we
  go through the other farce. Other end of the room, please, ladies and
  gentlemen, for the "Area Belle.'"</p>

  <p>Miss Allnut looked almost inclined to follow them, but she thought better
  of it.</p>

  <p>"Your part begins here, Mr. Crawford," she said coldly, showing him the
  book. "I think you had better learn it first, and we can rehearse
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I think we'll follow Dudley's suggestion, if you don't mind," he
  objected. "This is my first speech, is it? Thanks."</p>

  <p>"'Maud, I have come to ask you to be my wife. I&mdash;' Oh, bother the
  book!" he exclaimed, softly throwing it down, and glancing across the room to
  where the others stood in a little knot, busy rehearsing their farce. "Edith,
  I came down here to tell you something that I dared not tell you in the
  summer. I was coming to you in the library this afternoon, and I saw you
  rehearsing with that fellow Scott. I didn't know anything about these
  theatricals, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you thought he was making love to me," she said, with a quiet, happy
  smile parting her lips.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!"</p>

  <p>"And that's why you've been so horrid ever since you came," with a sigh of
  relief. "How ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>"Darl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say," cried Dudley, looking round, "I can't hear the words, but the
  attitude is capital. No one could tell that was acting, Scott, could they?"
  he continued innocently; and no one could imagine for the moment why it was
  that Miss Allnut looked so frightfully confused.</p>

  <p>The theatricals took place in due course, and were an immense success.
  Every one knew his or her part, but the number of rehearsals which Gordon
  Crawford and Miss Allnut went in for astonished every one, until an
  interesting little item of news was confided to Mrs. Carr, and spread among
  the guests. Then every one understood it at once.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>9.&mdash;THE MISSING WILL</h2>

  <p class="first">"Mark! Mark!" "Quick, sir! Ah!"</p>

  <p>An exclamation of keen regret from the keeper behind me and another one of
  half-angry surprise from my host, who was shooting next in line to me. I
  raised my gun, and blazed away with both barrels at the covey of birds which
  had been put up almost at my feet, but I was too late&mdash;I missed.</p>

  <p>"What, in the name of wonder, is the matter with you, Dick? Are you
  moonstruck, or have you been having a nap, or what?" demanded Cyril Vaux, my
  friend and host.</p>

  <p>I pointed with my finger across the heather-covered common to the bare,
  rock-strewn hills beyond. High up amongst them was a plain grey-stone
  building, designed after the severest style of early English architecture,
  with straight pointed arches, irregular outline, and with one simple spire
  rising from the midst. Behind, high up on a cone-shaped hill, and forming a
  striking background for the austere-looking edifice, was a rudely carved
  crucifix, standing out with an almost startling vividness against the clear
  October sky.</p>

  <p>"I was looking at that place," I answered; "what is it?"</p>

  <p>Cyril Vaux followed my finger, and a momentary shade passed over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"The monastery," he answered slowly. "Striking piece of architecture,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He had used the correct word. It was striking. We had walked for miles
  over a stretch of open country, which had gradually become more and more
  uncultivated and bleak, and we were now almost on the outside boundary of an
  ancient tract of forest land. The stern, iron-bound hills, the bare grey
  masses of rock piled about in gloomy, fantastic shapes upon the uncultivated
  common, the belts of black, close-growing pine-trees, which stretched
  frowning along the summit of the range of hills beyond&mdash;all these
  surroundings seemed to be in accord with the austere character of the place
  and the vowed lives of its inmates, and to form a grimly appropriate
  framework for it.</p>

  <p>We looked at it for a moment or two in silence&mdash;I with a
  half-fascinated admiration which I took no pains to conceal, Cyril with a
  heavy frown on his darkened face. And while we stood there the chapel bell
  tolled solemnly out for vespers, and far away in the distance we could see
  the white-robed monks slowly wending their way homewards from the fields
  where they had been toiling since break of day.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever go to the place?" I asked; for Cyril Vaux was a Roman
  Catholic, and the head of a great Romanist family.</p>

  <p>"Never," he answered shortly.</p>

  <p>He vouchsafed no further explanation at the moment, and, in the face of
  his clouded brow and abrupt reply, I scarcely liked to question him further.
  But by and bye, when we had turned our backs upon the monastery, and the
  sound of its bell came no longer to our ears, he called me to his side at the
  summit of a sharp eminence.</p>

  <p>"Look down there," he said, pointing with his finger below. "A pretty
  view, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>I agreed with him heartily. At the foot of the hill on which we stood was
  a secluded, thickly wooded valley, bordered by upland slopes of rich
  meadowland and dark plantations, and half hidden amongst the tall trees,
  which formed a scattered circle around it, rose the rugged grey towers of a
  majestic ruin. The remains of a moat, now dry and thickly covered with wild
  flowers, were still just distinguishable, and, from the shape and outline of
  the crumbling walls, I could see at once that this was an ecclesiastical ruin
  of some sort.</p>

  <p>"All that is left of St. Clement's Abbey. A picturesque ruin, isn't it?"
  Cyril remarked, looking down on it with the frown still lingering on his
  ruddy, sunburnt face. "Those walls must be six hundred years old. A
  magnificent ruin!"</p>

  <p>"A magnificent ruin, indeed," I answered enthusiastically. "But you don't
  seem to admire it much, Cyril," I remarked; for after one look downwards he
  had turned away with something very much like a shudder, and was petting his
  favourite dog.</p>

  <p>"Am I likely to admire anything much which reminds me of those cursed
  monks?" he answered, half fiercely.</p>

  <p>I looked at him in blank astonishment. The look seemed to remind him of
  something which he had doubtless forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you don't know much of my family history, do you, Dick?" he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. The last twenty years of my life I had spent in India,
  and since we were boys together at Harrow I had seen nothing of Cyril Vaux
  until a month ago, when we had come across one another in town, and he had
  brought me down to his place for a week's shooting.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll make you master of it in a very few sentences, and then you'll
  understand my words better. My great-uncle, whose death left me the head of
  the family, was the largest landowner and probably the richest man in the
  county. He was also a Roman Catholic, and spent a good deal of his time at
  the monastery. Most unfortunately it happened that soon after his accession
  to the estates a man named Ricaldo came to the monastery, and became
  secretary to the Abbot. He was a Jesuit of the worst type, scheming, cunning,
  ambitious; and he found in my great-uncle, Sir Philip Vaux, an easy tool. The
  large sums which he had always been in the habit of giving to the monastery,
  and which always found their way to Rome, were doubled and trebled. Not
  content with that, Ricaldo got Sir Philip to go to Italy with him, and while
  he was there he made bequests to the Church which necessitated his mortgaging
  every acre of which he was possessed, and also got him to sign a will leaving
  everything to them. Had my uncle died in Rome I should in all probability
  have been a beggar. However, he lived long enough to return to England and to
  quarrel desperately with Ricaldo. The cause of that quarrel has never been
  cleared up, and the rumours which were whispered about at the time, and which
  are still believed in by a good many of the country people, I would rather
  not tell you. At any rate, my uncle is known to have declared that he had
  changed his will and that, with the exception of some reasonable bequests, he
  had left everything to me. One night, about a week after he had executed this
  will, he left Vaux Court, with the vowed intention of walking across to the
  monastery to see the Abbot with reference to some grave charge which he was
  bringing against Ricaldo. From that night he has neither been seen nor heard
  of, and on that same night Ricaldo also disappeared, and has never
  reappeared."</p>

  <p>"And the estates?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Nine-tenths of them went to the monastery," Cyril answered silently. "The
  later will was never found, and the monks claimed every acre which was not
  entailed. That is why I am such a poor man, and can't even live at my own
  house," he added bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose all the country round was searched?" I asked. "Did they leave
  no clue whatever?"</p>

  <p>"None. Their fate is a profound mystery, and will remain so now for ever,"
  Cyril said. "Living or dead, they have both vanished from the face of the
  earth, and the will has gone with them."</p>

  <p>I was silent for a few minutes, and then I changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"These ruins must look fine by moonlight," I remarked. "I should like to
  see them."</p>

  <p>Cyril laughed shortly. "You would find no one in the country willing to be
  your guide after dark," he remarked. "To add to the attractions of the
  neighbourhood, the place is supposed to be haunted."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" I answered, with all the indulgent contempt of a profound
  materialist. I did not believe in ghosts.</p>

  <p>"I see you are incredulous," Cyril said quietly; "you have no belief in
  such things."</p>

  <p>"None," I answered firmly.</p>

  <p>"Neither have I, and yet&mdash;yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet what?" I interrupted. "Have you seen a ghost there?" I added
  banteringly.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure," he continued calmly. "Ah, you needn't look so
  contemptuous, Dick! I know very well that all men of a reasonable turn of
  mind would call it an optical delusion, and yet, standing where we are
  standing now, late at night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and suddenly changed his tone.</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind what I saw, or fancied that I saw; you'd only laugh at me
  if I told you. Hi! Carlo, Ponto, to heel, sir! Morton, we'll try Harrison's
  turnip fields, if there's light enough left. Come along, Dick."</p>

  <p>The sun had set and the autumn twilight was fast descending on the
  hillside. Suddenly I saw a ghastly change come over Cyril's face, and he
  caught me by the coat-sleeve, pointing downwards with a shaking finger. I
  followed his gesture, and for a moment my blood ran cold within me. Down
  amongst the ruined cloisters stood, or seemed to stand, a tall, dark figure,
  with hands stretched up towards the sky, and through the still evening air
  there floated to our ears the awful sound of an agonized human voice slowly
  chanting the "Miserere me." I felt Cyril's great frame quivering in every
  limb as he leaned against me.</p>

  <p>"Come away!" he cried, in a hoarse, choking whisper; "come away!"</p>

  <p>I was rooted to the spot and I could not move. Suddenly Cyril raised his
  gun to his shoulder and, taking a hasty aim, fired. The black-robed figure
  never moved.</p>

  <p>"Let us go down," I whispered.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" Cyril answered. "Come!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the figure, on which my eyes were riveted, disappeared. It made
  no step either backward or forward, nor was there near any pillar behind
  which it could have moved. It seemed as though it had melted into air.</p>

  <p>"You saw that," Cyril muttered hoarsely. "Come away;" and this time I
  yielded.</p>

  <p>We walked homewards with scarcely a word. At dinner-time Cyril ate
  nothing, but drank a good deal, and almost immediately afterwards fell asleep
  in his armchair. I stole softly from the room and up into my own chamber.</p>

  <p>Being by nature and education profoundly incredulous as regards matters
  supernatural, our evening's adventure had filled me with an overpowering
  curiosity&mdash;a curiosity which I made up my mind to satisfy. I looked at
  my watch&mdash;it was barely ten o'clock&mdash;and commenced my preparations.
  First, I carefully loaded my revolver, exchanged my thin shoes for stouter
  boots and wrapped a long inverness cloak around my evening clothes. Then I
  stole softly from the house and made my way across country towards the
  Abbey.</p>

  <p>In about an hour's time I reached the hill from the summit of which Cyril
  had first pointed the Abbey out to me. There was a full moon, but it was
  partly hidden behind a dense bank of clouds, and I could only just discern
  the ruined walls below. Scarcely hesitating, I made my way down a narrow
  footpath into the meadow below, and, scrambling across the moat, stepped over
  some loose stones within the tottering walls of the ruined Abbey.</p>

  <p>I stood still, listening intently. There was no sound save the pattering
  of the thickly growing ivy against the pillars and the hoarse "too-whit" of
  an owl at the further end of the place. I walked up and down over the soft
  turf and amongst the grotesque shadows until I grew somewhat accustomed to
  the strange scene. Then I sat down upon a smooth stone, and, tired out by a
  long day's partridge shooting. I dosed my eyes and fell into a doze.</p>

  <p>I must have slept for more than an hour, for I had scarcely opened my eyes
  before I heard the sad-sounding bells from the monastery behind the hills
  tolling the hour of midnight. As the last of the twelve strokes sounded I
  turned my head slightly, and then started up with a cry of horror frozen upon
  my lips, and staggered backwards against the cold stone walls with numbed
  senses and wildly beating heart. Scarcely half a dozen yards away from me was
  a dark figure, whose fierce, burning eyes were fixed upon me and who stood
  leaning on a long, crimson-stained rapier.</p>

  <p>I could not move or speak, I could only stare with fascinated eyes at the
  awful figure which had stolen silently upon me. From head to foot a monk's
  dark robe concealed his shape, and the cowl was only partially pushed back
  from his head. The face was the face of a living skeleton, wan and emaciated
  to a fearful pitch, and round it hung a mass of unkempt silvery white hair
  and a long matted beard. The fingers which grasped the sword were bones and
  bones only. It was a fearful figure to look upon, and the horror with which
  it filled me will never completely pass away.</p>

  <p>With shaking fingers I drew out my revolver from my pocket and held it out
  until it nearly touched him. Three times I tried to speak, but my dry tongue
  refused its office. At last a few faltering words came.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Answer me, or I shall fire."</p>

  <p>The figure took not the slightest notice of my words or of my pointed
  revolver, but slowly turning round, motioned me to follow. I obeyed, keeping
  close behind him.</p>

  <p>Over the smooth turf, amongst the fragments of tumbled stone and ruined
  pillars, we picked our way until we reached the extreme corner of the ruin,
  where the remains of a tower was still standing. Stooping low, we passed
  through an arched doorway into an apartment now open to the starlit heavens,
  but which had once been a cell. By this time I was beginning to overcome my
  fear.</p>

  <p>"Speak, Father! Monk! or whoever you are!" I demanded. "What do you want
  with me? What&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Silence! Wait!"</p>

  <p>I breathed more freely still. The sound of a human voice, hollow and weak
  though it was, still further reassured me. I stood in silence while he seemed
  to be considering.</p>

  <p>"Stand back!" he said suddenly; and, wondering. I obeyed him.</p>

  <p>He stooped to the ground and drew out from a niche in the wall a heavy
  pickaxe, and with it gave a few weak blows at a certain spot in the wall,
  breathing heavily and trembling at the slight exertion it entailed. A mass of
  stones yielded at last to his feeble blows, and an iron-studded door stood
  revealed. Motioning me to remain where I was, he passed through it and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Soon I heard him descending stone steps, which seemed to lead him down
  into some sort of underground chamber. There was a brief silence, and then he
  commenced the ascent slowly and with many halts. At last he reappeared
  through the door, tottering and exhausted, with ghastly streaks of
  perspiration on his parchment skin, and shaking from head to foot, as though
  with the effect of some fierce excitement. Then I saw that he was dragging
  something after him, and suddenly, with a supreme effort, it was cast down at
  my feet. A deadly faintness stole over me, and I clutched at the damp, cold
  walls of the cell for support; for the moonlight flooded in through the
  gaping apertures showed me the partially dressed skeleton of a man, his arms
  crossed upon his breast, and the bones that had once been fingers wrapped
  round the hilt of a sword.</p>

  <p>A mist swam before my eyes, and it seemed as though the horror of the
  thing would turn me sick, but the trembling voice of the figure opposite to
  me reached my ears, and with a great effort I retained my senses.</p>

  <p>"Thirty years ago I slew him;" and the long bony fingers, quivering in
  every joint, were stretched out towards the skeleton which lay there white
  and gleaming. "Yet not as a murderer did I slay him, but, no less the blame
  to me, I, Francis Ricaldo, slew him in fair fight. I, once a humble monk, a
  vowed servant of God, imperilled for ever the salvation of my soul, and
  fought with him after the manner of fighting men, as I had learnt in the days
  of my youth. His sin was great, though mine was greater. He offended against
  the Holy Church, he would have robbed her of her rights, with a stroke of his
  pen he would have undone the work of many years. It seemed to me right then
  when I met him within these walls at dead of night, and he showed me that
  vile parchment, it seemed to me right then to prevent this thing, though at
  the risk of my immortal soul. Little did I dream that for so devoted but
  mistaken zeal the punishment would have been so heavy. My last hour and my
  bitterest has come. In the name of the Church I restore to the heir of Sir
  Philip Vaux the lands which this man desired should be his. I lay a charge
  upon you, sir&mdash;I know not who you are, but it is one which you dare not
  refuse. Seek out the head of the house of Vaux, show him this skeleton and
  give him these papers. You will do this?"</p>

  <p>"I will," I answered firmly. "And you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To the monastery, quick!" he gasped. "Fetch Father Bertrand&mdash;tell
  them all is over. Tell them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A ghastly change had stolen over his face, and he sank down upon the cold
  turf. With trembling fingers he held a small crucifix before his dimmed eyes,
  and his white lips moved in an inaudible prayer. When the moon emerged from a
  thick bank of clouds, its soft light shining upon his white rigid features
  showed me the face of the dead. I had arrived only just in time to ease the
  conscience of the Ghost of St. Clement's Abbey.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Cyril Vaux is a rich man again, and many are the invitations he sends me
  to visit him at Vaux Court&mdash;but I do not go. Never again shall I look
  upon those wild monastery hills or on the fair ruins of the old Abbey, for
  the horror of that night alone with the dying monk in his secret cell have
  wormed themselves into my very being and filled me with a rooted horror of
  the place. Others may tell the story of the sad-faced hermit dragging out his
  weary thirty years of penance; I cannot.</p>

     id="ch-10"></a>10.&mdash;A MAD CHRISTMAS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Dec 1900<br>
  Illustrated by A. Forestier</h3><img src="1203351h-images/AMadXmas1.jpg"

  <p class="first">Certainly if there is one time more than another when a
  bachelor commences to doubt whether his state of single blessedness is the
  most desirable form of existence, it is at Christmas-time. The joys of the
  season are essentially domestic joys; and every one is either looking forward
  to convivial meetings with a circle of relations and friends, or a happy
  reunion within his own family. At such a time a middle-aged bachelor with no
  relations feels rather out of it.</p>

  <p>Now, although I must plead guilty to ten years of bachelorhood, I never
  was one of the misanthropical type. I was single (observe the past tense) not
  from principle, but merely from force of circumstances; and I was never
  addicted to shutting myself up with my books and a cat and growling cynical
  remarks at the pleasure-seeking world. On the contrary, I am of a somewhat
  jovial disposition, and was always fond of society. Christmas-time I liked to
  spend at a jolly country house, and could turn my hand to charades, dancing,
  romping with the villagers or children, conjuring, and many other
  accomplishments. In fact I may say, with due modesty, that I once heard
  myself described by a country hostess as an "extremely useful sort of
  man."</p>

  <p>The idea of spending Christmas in my solitary rooms, with only my landlady
  and her domestic to talk to, was a contingency which I had never contemplated
  for a moment; but last year I was very nearly brought face to face with it. I
  generally had two or three invitations, at least, to select from, and chose
  the one where I should be likely to meet the most interesting set of people;
  but on this occasion my usual invitations did not arrive. The Harwoods, with
  whom I had spent the Christmas before, had lost a child, and were in
  mourning; the Houldens were wintering at Nice (Mrs. Houlden was delicate),
  and at Houghton Grange both the girls were married, and the Christmas house
  parties were things of the past. These were my stock invitations; and as I
  recollected others amongst my circle of acquaintances to whom something or
  other had happened since last year, it slowly dawned upon me that if I
  desired to avoid a Christmas in London, I had better make arrangements to
  remove myself either to a northern hydropathic establishment which I had
  occasionally honoured by my presence, or to a Brighton hotel, where I was
  sure of falling in with some pleasant company. Just as I had arrived at this
  melancholy decision, however, a letter arrived which afforded me the greatest
  satisfaction. It was an invitation to spend a week or two with my old friend,
  Fred Hallaton, at his place in Leicestershire; and with the vivid
  recollection before me of a pleasant Christmas spent at Gaulby Hall some
  three years ago, I lost no time in penning a cordial assent to the welcome
  invitation. A few days later beheld me, followed by a porter carrying my
  various impediments, on the platform at St. Pancras, prepared to take my
  journey down to Leicester by the 3.30 Manchester and Liverpool express. The
  Pullman was crowded with a pack of noisy schoolboys, so I eschewed it and
  selected an empty first-class carriage. I took possession of my favourite
  corner seat, with my back to the engine, and wrapping my rug round my knees
  and unfolding the <i>Times</i>, glided away from the city of smoke in a
  remarkably good humour, partly inspired, no doubt, by a capital lunch, and
  partly by pleasurable anticipation of my forthcoming visit.</p>

  <p>Fred met me at Leicester station, and I saw with regret that he was
  looking pale and ill, and much thinner than when I had seen him last. He
  seemed pleased to see me, however, and greeted me warmly.</p>

  <p>During our drive to Gaulby, I hazarded a few remarks, with a view to
  ascertaining what sort of a party there was collected at the Hall, but I got
  nothing definite out of him. He was quite unlike his old self, and I came to
  the conclusion that he must be ill. As we drove up the avenue I leaned out of
  the window to gaze at the fine old mansion, and it struck me at once as
  looking cold and uninviting, while the grounds were certainly very much
  neglected. Something seemed wrong all round, and I began to feel almost sorry
  I had come. We overtook Mrs. Hallaton at the Hall door, just returned from a
  walk. She was as gracious and as pleasant as she had ever been to me; but I
  fancied that I could detect in her manner and appearance something of the
  ill-being which seemed to exist around her.</p>

  <p>We all three entered together, and the moment we passed through the door I
  felt convinced that my expectations of a jolly Christmas party were doomed to
  disappointment. There were no decorations about, only one doleful-looking
  servant, and apparently nothing stirring. I felt sure something was wrong,
  but at any rate I consoled myself with the reflection that I had lost little
  by coming, as it had been a choice between this and an hotel. But, all the
  same, I did not feel particularly cheerful as I followed the doleful-looking
  servant upstairs, along wide corridors, across passages, upstairs again, and
  then down a long corridor, until at last I reached my room in the west
  wing.</p>

  <p>My surmises were correct. When I descended, after a prolonged and careful
  toilette, my host was lounging about in a shooting jacket, and he and his
  wife were the only occupants of the room. I was the only guest.</p>

  <p>"I've something very serious to say to you, Neillson," he said slowly
  (Neillson is my Caine). "I'm going to make a confidant of you, if I may, old
  man."</p>

  <p>I bowed my head and listened.</p>

  <p>"You haven't noticed anything particular about my wife I don't suppose,
  have you?" he asked, with a searching glance.</p>

  <p>I admitted that I had thought her strangely silent, and apparently having
  some anxiety weighing on her mind.</p>

  <p>He laughed, a short uncertain laugh, and leaned over to me
  confidentially.</p>

  <p>"I rely upon your discretion, you know, Neillson. I wouldn't have it known
  for the world&mdash;but my wife is mad."</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <img src="1203351h-images/AMadXmas2.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Mad?" I put down the claret jug, and stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, mad!" he repeated impatiently. "It was the sun in India last year
  that did the mischief. She would expose herself to it. The doctor whom I have
  consulted advised me to send her to a private asylum, but I haven't the heart
  to do it. She's perfectly harmless, you know; but, of course, it's an awful
  trial to me."</p>

  <p>I stammered out an expression of sympathy. To tell the truth, I scarcely
  knew what to say. I was bewildered at this painful explanation of the gloom
  which reigned over the house. Presently Fred closed his eyes, and left me to
  digest this strange and unwelcome piece of news. I am naturally somewhat
  selfish, and before very long my sympathy was diverted in some measure from
  my host to myself. It occurred to me that it was by no means a pleasant
  prospect to be a guest in a house, the mistress of which was mad. It was not
  altogether kind of Fred to invite me, I thought, under the circumstances,
  without some explanation of his wife's state. I began to feel quite an
  injured man. The only consolation was the claret, and there was no telling
  how long that would last out. It had struck me that Burditt had been a long
  time bringing up the last bottle. By-the-by, Burditt was an old friend of
  mine. Why shouldn't I look him up and have a chat? I was quite tired of my
  own company, and Fred was fast asleep. So I opened the door softly, and made
  my way down to the hall. As I passed an open door, Mrs. Hallaton appeared and
  beckoned me in. I had no alternative but to obey her invitation.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Neillson," she said in an agitated tone, "as you are going to stop
  here for a day or two, there is something connected with this household which
  you ought to know. Has my husband told you anything?"</p>

  <p>I bowed, and told her gravely that I knew all, and that she had my
  profoundest sympathy.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are surprised that I should ask whether Fred has told you,"
  she said, turning a little away from me. "It seems strange, doesn't it, that
  one should be mad and be conscious of it? It only comes on in fits, and they
  are terrible."</p>

  <p>She shuddered; and so, to tell the truth, did I.</p>

  <p>"Such a phase of madness is probably not incurable," I ventured to suggest
  timidly.</p>

  <p>"Incurable! Of course it is not incurable," she answered vehemently.</p>

  <p>I edged a little towards the door. I had had no experience with talking
  with lunatics, and felt anything but comfortable in my present position. Mrs.
  Hallaton was beginning to look very excited and dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you are frightened, Mr. Neillson," she said a little
  contemptuously, "you can leave us whenever you please. These fits do not come
  on often, but they are anything but pleasant things when they do come
  on."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine so," I assented, devoutly hoping a fit was not then
  pending. Soon I managed to make my adieu, and with a sigh of relief found
  myself once more in the hall. I made my way to Burditt's room, but he had
  gone to bed; and seeing it was nearly eleven o'clock, I decided to follow his
  example, and, preceded by a servant (I could never have found the way
  myself), I mounted again the wide stairs, and threaded the numerous passages
  which led to my room. It was at the end of a wide corridor, on either side of
  which were six doors.</p>

  <p>"Does any one sleep up here?" I asked the man as he bade me
  good-night.</p>

  <p>He pointed to a door exactly opposite mine.</p>

  <p>"That is the master's room, sir," he replied; "and the one at the bottom
  end is Mrs. Hallaton's. No one else sleeps in this part of the house. The
  servants' rooms are all in the north wing."</p>

  <p>I was generally able to sleep at whatever hour I retired; but it was
  early, and the fire looked tempting, so instead of immediately undressing, I
  changed my coat for a smoking jacket, and lighting a pipe, made myself
  comfortable in an easy chair. Soon I heard Mrs. Hallaton's light footsteps
  ascend the stairs, and the door of her room open and dose; and a little while
  afterwards Fred halted outside my door to bid me a cheery good-night, and
  then entered the room opposite.</p>

  <p>How long I sat there I cannot tell, but I fell into a heavy doze; and when
  I woke up with a sudden start, it was with the uneasy consciousness that
  something unusual had awakened me. I sprang to my feet and looked fearfully
  around. The flickering flame of my fire, almost burnt out, was still
  sufficient to show me that no one had entered the room; but while I stood
  there with strained senses, I heard a sound which made my blood run cold
  within me; and, although I am no coward, I shivered with fear. It was the
  half-muffled shriek of a woman in agony, and it came from Mrs. Halleton's
  room. For a moment I was powerless to move; then I hastily unlocked the door,
  and, hurrying down the corridor, knocked at hers. There was no answer. I
  tried the handle, it was locked; but, listening for a moment, I could hear
  the sound of a woman gasping for breath. I rushed back along the corridor to
  Fred's room. The door was dosed, but unlocked, and I threw it open.</p>

  <p>"Fred!" I cried; but Fred was not there, nor had the bed been slept in. A
  candle was burning on the dressing table, and in the right-hand corner of the
  room was what appeared to be a hole in the wall; but when I stood before it I
  saw at once that it was a secret passage running parallel with the corridor.
  Looking down it, I could see a light at the other end, and knowing that it
  must lead into Mrs. Hallaton's room, I caught up the candle, and, bending
  almost double, half ran, half crept along it, until I reached the other
  extremity, and found myself in Mrs. Hallaton's room. I stood upright, and
  glanced half eagerly, half fearfully, around.</p>

  <p>The room was empty, but the window directly opposite to me was open, and
  as my eyes fell upon it, I stood petrified with a dull, sickening horror, and
  the candle dropped with a crash from my nerveless fingers. There was a
  miniature balcony outside the window; and on this stood Fred Hallaton,
  holding in an embrace, which was certainly not of love, the fainting form of
  his wife. The moon was shining full on his face, ghostly and demoniacal, with
  the raging fire of the madman in his eyes, and the imbecile grin of the
  lunatic on his thin lips. In a moment the truth flashed upon me, and as I
  stood there gaping and horror-struck, he saw me, and burst into a fit of wild
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! You, Neillson? What a joke! See what a glorious view of the
  grounds! Come and bend over, man; don't be afraid. Does the height make you
  dizzy? It's made her&mdash;;" and he motioned to the insensible figure of his
  wife, whom he still held clasped in his arms. "Do you know what I am going to
  do with her? I'm going to chuck her over down there;" and he pointed to the
  garden below. "A mad woman is no use to any one. Come and lend me a
  hand."</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Mechanically I rushed to the balcony, and strove to wrench from his
  encircling grasp the fainting form of his wife. Like a flash his imbecile
  grin vanished, and his eyes filled with a malignant fury, as he let go his
  grasp of his wife and sprang at me like a tiger-cat. It was in vain that I
  wrestled with him. His long arms were around me, and held me as if I were in
  a vice. I tried to shout for help, but my tongue cleaved to the roof of my
  mouth, and a faint gurgling was all the sound I could command. Nearer and
  nearer we drew to the parapet's edge, until at last I could see the lawn
  below, studded with flower-beds like the pattern of some fancy work; for
  Gaulby Hall was built high, and we were on the third storey. I felt his hot
  breath in my face, and caught his diabolical look of triumph as he slowly
  forced me backwards against the outside rail, which creaked and swerved with
  my weight, and then my struggling feet seemed to part with the earth as with
  a wild yell of&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Leicester! Leicester!" I opened my eyes and sat up with a start. The
  <i>Times</i> had slipped from my fingers, and the train was slowly steaming
  into Leicester station, and there, standing upon the platform, smiling and
  robust, looking the very picture of health, was Fred Hallaton.</p>

  <p>The Christmas party at Gaulby Hall was the most enjoyable I was ever at,
  and the people (the house was crammed full of visitors) the most entertaining
  and agreeable I ever met. There was one young person especially&mdash;a Miss
  Alice Pratison she was then&mdash;with whom I got on remarkably well. I never
  enjoyed a visit so much in my life as I did that one, nor a ride so much as
  one afternoon when Miss Pratison and I, after a capital run, rode home
  together with her little hand in mine, and our horses very dose together.
  Next Christmas, if Alice doesn't object, I mean to have a jolly little house
  party of my own.</p>

  <p class="first">On a cold grey morning towards the end of November, Hugh
  Escott, barrister-at-law, sat before his untasted breakfast in his London
  chambers reading a letter which brought to him the bitterest disappointment
  his life had known. With trembling fingers he grasped the single sheet of
  notepaper and read it steadily through; then it fluttered down to the carpet,
  and, leaning forward in his chair, he buried his face in his hands.</p>

  <p>It was a very harmless sort of epistle, too. Merely an invitation to spend
  Christmas with his old friend Tom Densleigh at his place in Leicestershire.
  To any one but Hugh Escott it would have seemed impossible that there could
  be anything in such a letter as this to strike him such a blow.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"TURLANGTON, LEICESTERSHIRE,<br>
  <br>
  November 27,<br>
  <br>
  "MY DEAR ESCOTT&mdash;Only this morning my wife was reminding me that it is
  nearly six years since you paid us a visit. How the time has flown! They tell
  me that you are working yourself to death, and though, of course, we are all
  delighted to hear of your becoming so famous, I think it's a great pity you
  don't take more care of yourself. I saw Roberts yesterday, and he told me
  that you were looking like a ghost, though for that matter he doesn't look
  much better himself. These commissions must play the deuce with a man. Now I
  want you to come down here for Christmas, and spend a week or two with us
  quietly. The west covers have scarcely been touched yet, and I can find you a
  capital mount if you care to do any hunting. We shall be quite alone, and Liz
  joins with me in hoping that you will spare us at least a fortnight. We'll
  send you back to town a different man. I shall take no refusal this time.
  Wire or drop me a line on which day you will come, and by what train, and the
  dog-cart and your humble servant shall meet you at Harborough.<br>
  <br>
  "Yours very sincerely,<br>
  <br>
  "TOM DENSLEIGH.<br>
  <br>
  "P.S.&mdash;When I said that we were quite alone I forget that my sister
  Marian, whom no doubt you will remember, is stopping with us, and Sir Harry
  Grover, her <i>fiancé</i>, whose place is only a few miles from here, is
  generally knocking about. We scarcely reckon them as visitors, though. You
  must be sure and come."</p><br>

  <p>"My sister Marian, whom no doubt you will remember, and her
  <i>fiancé</i>." It was there that the sting lay. As he sat in his battered
  old armchair, leaning forwards, with his head clasped between his hands, his
  thoughts went back to a merry Christmas party at Turlangton nearly six years
  ago. He had gone there light-hearted and gay, caring little that he was an
  orphan and poor, and determined, with the abandon of youth, to thoroughly
  enjoy himself. There had been a shy, beautiful girl&mdash;Densleigh's sister,
  whom he had never met before, and had ridden, and danced, and walked with
  her, until her shyness had vanished, and they became close friends. Friends!
  he was twenty-four, and she seventeen, and they were together every day. What
  would you have? The time came when the merry conversation which had flowed
  unceasingly between them was exchanged for long interludes of silence, and
  presently, when they were together, all her former shyness returned in full
  force, and yet she thought not the less of him, nor he of her. So things went
  on until the morning of his departure; and then' when he sought to analyze
  his strange unwillingness to go, the truth flashed in upon him. He was in
  love with Marian Densleigh&mdash;he, Hugh Escott, a poor briefless barrister,
  with no prospects, no position, no money. What was he to do? How could he
  tell her of his love whilst he had nothing to offer? and yet how could he
  leave her?</p>

  <p>There was some shooting on the last day of his visit, and Mrs. Densleigh
  and Marian had driven over to meet them with the luncheon-basket. Just before
  their departure Marian and he found themselves by chance a little separated
  from the others. He was sorely tempted to tell her everything; and with a
  great effort he restrained himself. He talked to her earnestly of himself and
  of his future. "He was going back to London," he said, "with the firm
  determination to fight his way forward to success. It might be many years
  first, but he would succeed, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;" He hesitated and
  said no more, but his eyes met hers, and he knew with a great joy that his
  love was returned, and that she understood him. Joyfully he bent over her and
  kissed her hand. "Some day, Marian," he said, whispering hurriedly, as the
  others came in sight; and she had smiled an answer back to him. Was not this
  a plighted troth?</p>

  <p>That same evening he had gone back to London, and had thrown himself into
  his somewhat neglected work with an energy and zeal which surprised even
  himself. For two years he seemed to make but little headway, but he never
  relaxed his efforts, and his time came at last. He was junior counsel in a
  great civil action, and at the last moment his leader was taken ill. The
  case, which was full of intricate detail and technicalities, was looked upon
  as lost. The Attorney-General himself was on the other side, and was
  confident of success; but he soon found that he had an antagonist to do with
  very unlike an ordinary junior counsel. Towards the end of the case there
  arose a disputed point of law. The Attorney-General was positive, and
  scarcely condescended to argue the matter with the young counsel for the
  defence. The latter, however, to the surprise of every one in the court,
  quoted from memory a whole statute, and cited innumerable authorities in
  support of his argument, and finally handed to the judge books of reference
  which entirely upheld his view of the argument The judge, after a very brief
  consideration, pronounced his verdict. The junior counsel was right and the
  Attorney-General wrong.</p>

  <p>When Hugh Escott left the court that afternoon he knew that he need no
  longer have any fears for the future. In one short hour he had won that for
  which he had been striving for years. He had made a name, and briefs came
  pouring in. Still he worked on with unslackened zeal until he had established
  a splendid practice, and his name began to be heard outside legal circles as
  one of the rising young men of the day. Then, only a few days ago, he had
  said to himself that his time was come. He had succeeded&mdash;succeeded
  beyond his most sanguine dreams. Surely the time had now come when he might
  seek out Marian Densleigh, and redeem that unspoken but sacred promise.</p>

  <p>Such had been his thoughts during the last few days; and now there had
  come this letter: "My sister Marian and her <i>fiancé</i>." There was no
  escape from these words. They told their own tale. The period of probation
  had been too long, and slowly he realized that the object of his unflagging
  zeal and unremitting labours was gone, was unworthy. If only she could have
  trusted him and waited! But it was too late now, and with something which
  sounded very much like a groan, Hugh Escott rose from his chair and paced up
  and down the narrow room.</p>

  <p>Until that moment he had scarcely realized what the memory of those few
  slight words and that single look had been to him. They had been the moving
  impulse of all his efforts, the secret spring of his whole energy, and yet he
  had thought of them but seldom. He had found no time for dreams and fancies,
  however sweet; simply he had always had a distinct consciousness that there
  was some sweet reward to be won by this unceasing toil. And so he had toiled,
  and this was the end of it ail!</p>

  <p>He did not do what most men would have done under the
  circumstances&mdash;refuse his friend's invitation. On the contrary, he
  decided to accept it. He would meet her unflinchingly and with a semblance of
  forgetfulness. She would never guess that it was her memory which had spurred
  him on to so great success. He would make no reference to the past. Let her
  think that as he had been by her forgotten, so also was she forgotten by him;
  and in such frame of mind he travelled down to Turlangton on the very next
  day.</p>

  <p>Tom Densleigh was delighted to see him, and so was his wife, with whom in
  those former days Hugh Escott had been a great favourite. And then, as they
  sat in a corner of the drawing-room drinking afternoon tea and exchanging
  various items of news, the door opened softly, and Marian entered. It was
  dusk, and Mrs. Densleigh had sent away the servant who would have lit the
  lamps (afternoon tea by gaslight was altogether incongruous, she declared),
  and in the gloom of the room his tall, stern form and cold bow seemed as
  severe as he could have wished. It puzzled Mrs. Densleigh a little that the
  young barrister should draw himself up to his full height and knit his brows
  as her sister-in-law advanced out of the shadows with outstretched hand, and
  that he should immediately turn away to continue his conversation with her
  husband. Had she seen Marian's face, too, she might have wondered the more;
  but the merciful twilight hid it.</p>

  <p>Soon the dressing-bell rang, and as he held the door open for Mrs.
  Densleigh and her sister-in-law, Hugh Escott ventured for the first time to
  look steadily at her. He did not find the survey quite in accordance with his
  expectations. The shy girl who had won his heart had developed into a grave
  woman, beautiful, even more beautiful than she had promised to become, but
  with a serious, thoughtful expression, which made tier look older than her
  years. She did not look the sort of woman to forget or to lightly break her
  word; and why, he wondered as her glance rested upon him for a moment, was
  there just a shade of reproach in her clear blue eyes, dying away like a
  flash, and leaving them cold and indifferent? He could not tell.</p>

  <p>He was a long time in his dressing-room, and when he descended he found
  them all assembled in the drawing-room. Marian was standing with her back to
  him, talking to a tall young man with broad shoulders, short thick neck, and
  of somewhat heavy appearance. He turned round as the door opened&mdash;a
  coarse, unintelligent, but good-natured face&mdash;and some one introduced
  Sir Harry Grover to Mr. Escott. This, then, was his successful rival! Almost
  unconsciously he glanced with curling lip at Marian, and caught her furtively
  watching him. She coloured slightly and turned away.</p>

  <p>The dinner appeared to the host and hostess to be a complete success, for
  conversation never flagged for a moment. No one guessed that its principal
  contributor, Hugh Escott, sat there with a heart as heavy as lead, although
  his tongue was as light and brilliant as though talking was to him the
  keenest pleasure. With a malicious intent, of which afterwards he was
  heartily ashamed, he perpetually led the conversation to a higher level than
  is generally maintained at the dinner-table of a country house, and
  continually appealed to his opposite neighbour, Sir Harry Grover, for
  confirmation of, or information on, theories and subjects which it was
  evident were far beyond him. The young baronet, however, was not a whit
  annoyed or discomposed, but ate his dinner with unimpaired appetite, and on
  each occasion of appeal being made to him unblushingly affirmed his complete
  ignorance of the subject under discussion.</p>

  <p>"Not in my line at all," he remarked, in answer to a studiously polite
  query from his vis-a-vis.</p>

  <p>"Ask me to choose a horse or a dog for you, or examine me on the Racing
  Calendar if you like, and I'm your man; but as for literature, or any of
  those&mdash;what d'ye call 'em?&mdash;social questions, why, I'm not in it
  there."</p>

  <p>Hugh Escott's thin lips parted in a slight supercilious smile, and Marian
  bent her head over her plate. So this was the manner of man, he thought, for
  whose sake he had been forgotten&mdash;bah! She was not worth a passing
  regret even. And he turned away towards his host, talking and expounding more
  brilliantly than before; but during the rest of the dinner-time never once
  addressed or even glanced towards Sir Harry Grover.</p>

  <p>During the evening Mrs. Densleigh was in and out of the drawing-room a
  good deal, for one of her children was poorly, and she was a motherly little
  woman. And so it came to pass that Mr. Densleigh had his old friend quite to
  himself; whilst Marian, with Sir Harry lolling by her side, sat on a sofa a
  little apart. She was pretending to be absorbed in her fancy-work, but really
  she was striving to follow the conversation of her brother and his guest; for
  Hugh Escott was telling his friend much that she would like to have heard of
  his life during the last few years, and of the famous men he had met, both in
  his profession and out of it. But he never once turned towards her, or sought
  to embrace her in the conversation. On the contrary, his one object seemed to
  be to ignore her as much as possible.</p>

  <p>By and bye Mr. Densleigh asked his guest a question which astonished him
  not a little:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You've told us nothing about your engagement yet, Escott. I was never
  more astonished in my life than when I heard that you were going to marry
  Fred Matheson's daughter."</p>

  <p>"Marry!" Hugh Escott laughed&mdash;a short bitter laugh&mdash;and glanced,
  perhaps unconsciously, towards the sofa. Marian had not looked up, but her
  fingers had paused in the manipulation of her fancy work, and he could tell
  that she was listening.</p>

  <p>"It's my cousin George Escott, in the Guards, who's going to marry Miss
  Matheson. I never saw the lady but once in my life, and I certainly wasn't
  struck with her. How came you to think that it was me?"</p>

  <p>Tom Densleigh laughed.</p>

  <p>"It was that confounded ass Harrison who told us so," he exclaimed.
  "Always gets hold of the wrong end of the stick, that fellow does! What! you
  off already, Marian?" he added, as his sister approached and held out her
  hand. "Well, you do look rather pale. Headache, I suppose? Good-night. And
  now suppose we adjourn to the smoking-room and have a weed&mdash;eh,
  Grover?"</p>

  <p>They sat up late in Mr. Densleigh's comfortable little den, Sir Harry
  especially smoking many cigars and drinking many brandies and soda. At last,
  however, he rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Mustn't keep that brute of mine waiting any longer," he declared,
  lighting a last cigar. "Good night, Densleigh; good-night, Mr. Escott;" and,
  gulping down the contents of his glass, he made his way to the hall door, in
  front of which his dog-cart had been waiting for more than an hour.</p>

  <p>After his departure Mr. Densleigh and his guest settled down again to that
  most delightful of occupations, the exchanging of old reminiscences. Then,
  after a somewhat prolonged pause, Hugh Escott astonished his friend by asking
  him an abrupt question:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Densleigh, what's your sister going to marry that fellow for?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Densleigh looked thoughtful, and he did not answer for a moment or
  two. The subject was evidently not altogether a pleasant one to him.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, Escott," he said confidentially, "I'm hanged if I
  quite know. I'm confident that she's refused him three or four times, and no
  one was more surprised than myself when she came to me about a month ago and
  said that she was going to marry him. He's not a bad sort of fellow, by any
  means," Mr. Densleigh continued thoughtfully, "and he's awfully fond of her;
  but, all the same, I shouldn't have put him down as Marian's style."</p>

  <p>"Neither should I," he remarked sarcastically. "Well, good-night," he
  added, abruptly terminating the conversation. "About nine in the morning, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Sharp, if you can manage it," Mr. Densleigh observed. "I've told Burditt
  to meet us with the dogs at ten. Good-night."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>There was some shooting arranged for the next morning, and, curiously
  enough, the events of six years ago were repeated. Again they halted for
  lunch at Saddington hill, and again Mrs. Densleigh and Marian drove over to
  meet them in the pony-carriage. Afterwards, Hugh Escott, tired of the
  somewhat noisy conversation of the young baronet and one of his friends, lit
  a cigarette and strolled down the hill, sadly conscious that he was repeating
  the action of six years ago. And while he stood there struggling with sweet
  yet bitter recollections, a voice in his ear caused him to turn round, and
  she was by his side.</p>

  <p>She coloured a little at his questioning glance, and hastened to explain
  her presence. Tom and the others had gone down to Burditt's cottage to look
  at some pups, and had left word that he was to go to them there. She would
  show him the way.</p>

  <p>He detained her as she was moving through the gate.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Miss Densleigh," he said, in a cold, hard tone; "I have not
  yet congratulated you upon your engagement. Let me do so now. Doesn't it
  strike you," he added bitterly, "that this spot is peculiarly appropriate for
  such a purpose?"</p>

  <p>Her blue eyes filled with tears, but she brushed them hastily away.</p>

  <p>"That is scarcely a kind remark, Mr. Escott," she said quietly,
  "and&mdash;and I have not deserved it."</p>

  <p>"Not deserved it!" He turned upon her, his eyes ablaze with indignation
  and his voice trembling with anger. "Not deserved it, when here, upon this
  very spot, you&mdash;you&mdash;but you must remember it. Do you know that
  since that day I have worked and toiled unceasingly, with the one hope and
  reward before me of coming back and claiming you? And yet you say that you do
  not deserve it! Not deserve it," he went on bitterly, "when all that made
  success taste so sweetly and life worth living has been snatched away from me
  by you! Fool that I was to stake all my happiness on the constancy
  of&mdash;of a flirt!"</p>

  <p>She stood before him silent, with downcast eyes and quivering eyelids, and
  at his last words she started and raised her swimming eyes to his, full of a
  half-pained, half-indignant light.</p>

  <p>"I am not a flirt," she said, "and you do not know everything. Listen! I
  was true to you, although through all these years you never sent me one word
  of hope. The time has seemed short to you perhaps, wrapped up in your work;
  but to me, ah, it has seemed an eternity! I know that it was honourable of
  you not to come to me before, but oh, how I wished that you would come, or
  send me just one single word of encouragement! As year after year passed on I
  tortured myself with doubts. I began to fear that your success had made you
  forget me, or that you were growing ambitious and cared only for the honours
  that you were winning; and then&mdash;then Tom came home one day and declared
  that you were engaged. That same night Sir Harry Grover proposed to me for
  the third time, and his mother and every one wanted me to have him so much,
  and I thought it didn't matter much what became of me, so I said yes. It's
  all over now," she added, with a faint sob, "but don't think too hardly of
  me, Hugh."</p>

  <p>The indignation had died out of his face, and though his voice still
  trembled, it was no longer with anger.</p>

  <p>"Marian, I was a brute," he said humbly. "It's all a fearful mistake. Tell
  me you do not care for him, then."</p>

  <p>She turned away, and with a dull, heavy look in her eyes gazed vacantly
  over the rippling waters of the reservoir.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," she said, with a shudder; "Hugh, for God's sake don't ask
  me. You know. It's too late now. I must keep my word."</p>

  <p>They stood together in silence until from the other side of the plantation
  they heard the sound of approaching voices. Then he turned suddenly to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Marian, will you give me one kiss? and then I will go away."</p>

  <p>She lifted her eyes, and with a pang at his heart he watched her sorrowful
  expression change into one of mute reproach.</p>

  <p>"You ought not to ask me, Hugh."</p>

  <p>He bent his head, and kissed instead her hand. For one moment he retained
  it in his, and then they passed through the gate and joined the others.</p>

  <p>By that evening's post there came letters for Hugh Escott, and, holding
  one in his hand (it was a circular of a new club), he made his way into the
  gunroom, where his host was. He was very sorry, he declared, but a most
  important summons from town compelled his immediate return. He must go
  without fail on the morrow.</p>

  <p>Mr. Densleigh was in despair, but his guest was obdurate. At last, very
  unwillingly, he was compelled to give way; but he made a stipulation.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, you shall not go until after tomorrow," he said decidedly.
  "Why, I've had The Rattler trained specially for you, and he's in the very
  pink of condition. You positively must have one run with us."</p>

  <p>So Hugh Escott, loth to disappoint his old friend, consented to put off
  his return to town for one day.</p>

  <p>Every one hunted at Turlangton Grange, from the master down to the
  smallest stable-boy, and it was a very sportsmanlike party which issued from
  the lodge gates at half-past ten on the following morning. The Rattler turned
  out to be a dark bay, thoroughly trained, fast, and a capital fencer; and
  Hugh Escott, as he cantered along the smooth turf by the side of the road,
  felt that it would be his own fault if he failed to give a good account of
  himself with such a mount. Marian was riding a grey, almost thoroughbred, and
  very restless, but thoroughly under control, and by her side rode Sir Harry
  Grover, on a magnificent but evil-looking chestnut, the management of which
  absorbed his whole attention. Mr. Densleigh brought up the rear, keeping a
  respectful distance from the chestnut's heels, and mounted on a bay of
  somewhat lighter colour, and in other respects very similar to The
  Rattler.</p>

  <p>It was a magnificent morning, but the air was a trifle too keen for scent,
  and a good deal of time was flittered away whilst Rolleston Spinneys and
  several adjacent covers were drawn blank. At last, however, a fox was started
  from "John Ball," and, getting clear away, headed for Billesdon. In a moment
  the welcome cry was given, cigars were pitched away, hats pressed down, and
  horses rapidly changed. All the Turlangton party got away in the first
  flight, but after a field or two Hugh Escott took a line slightly to the
  left, losing sight of the others, and, indeed, of most of the field. A very
  short time proved that his counsellor&mdash;an old farmer with whom he had
  been chatting at the cover side&mdash;knew what he was about; for as he
  paused on some rising ground to have a look round, he saw that the fox had
  doubled, and was coming straight towards him, evidently bound for Norton
  Gorse. Almost as the music of the dogs reached his ears, another and a
  different sound caused him to glance quickly over his left shoulder, and he
  gave a great start. In the very next field, with his head low down and the
  bit between his teeth, was Sir Harry Grover's chestnut, galloping with the
  mad pace and reckless abandon of a runaway, whilst Sir Harry had fallen
  forward in his saddle, and was reeling side to side like a drunken man. For a
  moment Hugh Escott watched without moving. His first thought was that the
  brute would gallop itself out in time, if Sir Harry could only keep his seat;
  then suddenly he noticed the rider's peculiar attitude, and it flashed upon
  him that he must be hurt in some way. Almost simultaneously there were faint
  cries of warning from far away behind, "The cutting! the cutting!" and,
  rising in his saddle, Hugh Escott saw for the first time that scarcely two
  hundred yards away there was a deep gully where it had been intended to
  construct a railway siding. Towards this the chestnut, unchecked and
  unguided, was galloping unswervingly.</p>

  <p>For a second he hesitated&mdash;literally it was no longer&mdash;and then
  he dug spurs into The Rattler and lifted him into the next field. There was
  but one thing to be done, and he had determined to do it. Across the field he
  galloped in an oblique direction, only once pausing to rise in his stirrups
  and shout, "Throw yourself off, Sir Harry! Let loose!" But Sir Harry never
  looked up or took the least notice. The Rattler was going magnificently, but
  the chestnut was coming down the field like a fiend, and it seemed to the
  onlookers&mdash;the whole field were in sight now&mdash;that the two horses
  must cannon together on the very brink of the cutting. At the last moment,
  however, a sharp descent gave The Rattler an advantage, and he passed in
  front of the chestnut's panting head and foaming nostrils with a dozen yards
  to spare. One glance showed Escott that Sir Harry was unconscious; then,
  clenching his teeth, he pulled The Rattler on his haunches, and swinging him
  round, leaned over and caught at the baronet's reeling form as he was whirled
  past him. His grasp caught the fainting man around the middle, but the shock
  pulled him off his horse. Still he retained his hold, and locked in one
  another's arms the two men fell to the ground, whilst the chestnut, with a
  wild stagger and horrible snort, went head over heels into the cutting, and
  lay there a sickening mass.</p>

  <p>It was all over. The centre of an anxious, eager group, Hugh Escott was on
  his feet, pale, but unhurt and Sir Harry in a moment staggered up too, almost
  blinded with the blood which flowed from a wound in his temple, but not much
  the worse for his fall. A bough from a tree had struck him whilst jumping a
  hedge, and his horse, a regular brute, feeling the reins slacken, had bolted.
  If it had not been for Mr. Escott, he acknowledged frankly, holding out his
  hand to him, he must have been killed.</p>

  <p>There was a buzz, and more than a buzz, of congratulations. Every one was
  pressing forward to shake hands with Hugh Escott, who, with a faint,
  deprecating smile, was leaning breathless against The Rattler. Then every
  one's attention was suddenly diverted by a fresh sensation. Marian Densleigh,
  who had just ridden up with her brother, had fainted dead away.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a quarter of an hour before she revived, by which time most
  of the strangers had departed, and there remained only the doctor, who had
  been applying the usual restoratives, and the party for Turlangton, all of
  whom had had quite enough hunting for that day. Directly she opened her eyes
  she murmured a question:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Is he safe?"</p>

  <p>Sir Harry, with flushed cheeks, bent over her, and answered for himself;
  but she shook her head impatiently, and looked eagerly round amongst the
  little group.</p>

  <p>"Is Hugh&mdash;Mr. Escott&mdash;safe?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He had been standing a little aside, patting The Rattler, but he heard her
  anxious inquiry, and moved to her side.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Thank God!"</p>

  <p>She caught his hand with a little cry of relief and a glad light in her
  eyes. Then she dropped it suddenly, and he coloured and drew back.</p>

  <p>It was an awkward little scene, but Hugh Escott had no eyes for Sir
  Harry's start or Mr. Densleigh's perplexed look. He had remounted The
  Rattler, and with a muttered excuse about its being bad for Miss Densleigh to
  have too many people crowding round her, he rode slowly away without a single
  glance behind.</p>

  <p>When, an hour later, the others reached home, the following note was put
  into Densleigh's hand:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"MY DEAR DENSLEIGH,-I have just received a telegram which
  summons me at once to town on most important professional business. I have
  taken the liberty of riding The Rattler over to Harborough, as he doesn't
  seem a bit fagged, and I shall only just catch the London train. A thousand
  excuses to Mrs. Densleigh.<br>
  <br>
  "Yours in haste,<br>
  "H. E."</p><br>

  <p>And so Hugh Escott went back to his own town chambers, and plunged once
  more into a labyrinth of work. His arguments and reasonings were as shrewd
  and logical as ever, and his language as forcible; but, for all that, people
  began to notice a change in him. There were deep lines on his forehead and
  under his eyes, and he began to walk with a stoop. He was breaking-up, they
  said. And a very great man indeed, who had listened to the young counsel's
  pleadings from the woolsack, sought an interview with him, and warned him
  against the overwork, which must eventually end in a collapse; and it did.
  There came a day when Mr. Escott's clerk returned all his briefs, with the
  remark that his master was too ill to attend to them, and, knowing no friends
  to whom to write, himself took the management of the sick-room. On the third
  day of his illness a visitor called, and, after a brief talk with the
  landlady, was shown upstairs. The patient was unconscious; but directly Sir
  Harry Grover entered the room he knew him, and started up in bed.</p>

  <p>"What do you want here, Sir Harry Grover?" he called out, his thin form
  shivering and his preternaturally bright eyes seeming almost as if they would
  start out of his head. "What have you done with her&mdash;my Marian? Do you
  hear? Not yours&mdash;Ah! I forgot! I have lost her, lost, lost,
  lost!"&mdash;and suddenly overcome with exhaustion, he sank back in the bed,
  gasping.</p>

  <p>Sir Harry walked to the window with an odd look on his homely features. He
  had been preparing himself for this; but it was a blow. Soon he turned round
  and beckoned the clerk to follow him out of the room. Their conference was
  brief, but satisfactory. In an hour's time a hospital nurse was in
  attendance, with carte blanche to purchase everything necessary for the
  invalid, and a very celebrated physician was put in charge of the case.</p>

  <p>"We shall pull him round," was the doctor's verdict; "but I'm afraid he'll
  never have vitality enough to struggle into convalescence."</p>

  <p>"Get him conscious, and I'll do the rest," was the reply.</p>

  <p>In time he became conscious, and Sir Harry tried his prescription. It
  consisted only of a few words whispered in the patient's ear, but their
  effect was unmistakable. His recovery from that date was rapid, and by
  Christmas Day he could walk about the room leaning on Sir Harry's arm.</p>

  <p>There had been a good deal of surprise at Turlangton Grange that Sir Harry
  Grover had chosen, with only the vaguest of explanations, to spend Christmas
  in London, and Mrs. Densleigh, ascribing to that cause Marian's pale cheeks,
  was not a little vexed. On New Year's Eve, however, there came a telegram
  from the truant. He was returning on that afternoon, he said, and shortly
  after four o'clock his brougham drove up the avenue and footsteps were heard
  in the hall.</p>

  <p>Then there came what was, perhaps, the greatest surprise which easy-going
  Tom Densleigh and his wife had ever received in their lives. When the library
  door opened, who should be leaning on Sir Harry's arm but their old friend,
  Hugh Escott; and their surprise was not lessened when Marian, with a sudden
  cry of joy, sprang to her feet and accepted the embrace, not of Sir Harry,
  but of Hugh Escott.</p>

  <p>It was the young baronet who explained matters.</p>

  <p>"You see," he commenced awkwardly, "I've found out that Marian doesn't
  care for me; and it looks as if she cared for him, doesn't it? Well, of
  course you know he saved my life and all that, and besides, I shouldn't be
  such a brute as to expect her to marry me when she cared for some one else,
  and so I've brought him down for Marian's New Year's present. He don't look
  up to much now, does he?" he remarked critically; "but give him plenty to eat
  and all that, and the doctor says he'll be all right in no time. And I really
  don't care a bit," he wound up, casting an anxious glance round to see how
  his explanation was received.</p>

  <p>There was a universal tendency to laugh.</p>

  <p>"You hear, Hugh, he doesn't care a little bit," said Marian, biting her
  lip. "Flattering for me, isn't it?</p>

  <p>"Well, you know what I mean," explained Sir Harry, a little discomposed,
  but, all the same, under the impression that, except but that little slip, he
  had managed everything very neatly.</p>

  <p>Of course neither Mr. nor Mrs. Densleigh had any objection to make, and
  after the first little awkwardness had worn off they were quite a merry
  little party. Hugh Escott finished his convalescence at Turlangton, and
  before that was over his courtship commenced. Any one in those parts who know
  Mr. and Mrs. Escott&mdash;and there are few who do not&mdash;will tell how
  that ended.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>12.&mdash;AN AUTUMN HOLIDAY</h2>

  <p class="first">With an open letter stretched out before him and a vexed
  look upon his face, Lawrence Feyne sat at breakfast in his town chambers.</p>

  <p>"This decides it," he said softly to himself. "I shan't go to Evington
  Grange. That woman is the most indefatigable matchmaker in the world. What a
  pity she can't realize that I'm not a marrying man."</p>

  <p>He finished his breakfast, and strolled aimlessly to the window. The
  prospect, consisting of chimney-pots in inexhaustible variety, was not
  enticing, and with an impatient exclamation he turned away, and, pausing
  before the miniature pier-glass, earnestly surveyed his own face. A handsome
  face it would have been but for its worn-out, weary expression, and the dark
  rings round his lustreless eyes, which told of nights as well as days spent
  in unceasing toil.</p>

  <p>"Bretton is right," he mused, dropping into a chair. "I must have a
  change, or I shall knock up. I won't go to Evington Grange, though."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell for the breakfast things to be removed, and then sent out
  for a Bradshaw. While he sat studying it, there was a knock at the door, and
  "Mr. Spencer" was announced. Lawrence Feyne threw away his Bradshaw, and
  welcomed his guest cordially.</p>

  <p>"Delighted to see you back again, old man. Had a good time?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer took a chair and a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know exactly about having had a good time," he answered
  deliberately. "I've been very quiet, but I can tell you this, Feyne: I never
  came back to harness feeling more fit than I do now. Look better, don't
  I?"</p>

  <p>Lawrence Feyne contemplated his visitor's robust appearance, and
  acknowledged that he looked a great deal better.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking of a short change myself," he observed. "I don't feel quite
  up to the mark."</p>

  <p>"You don't look it, I can tell you," said Mr. Spencer gravely. "Been
  overworking, as usual, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I haven't been working particularly hard," he declared, "but I've made up
  my mind to have a week's holiday. Where should you go if you were me,
  Spencer?" he continued, stretching out his hand for his Bradshaw. "I want a
  quiet place, you know, where I can be quite alone, and, if necessary, do a
  little work. I did think of running down to Evington Grange for a day or two.
  Sir Francis has asked me lots of times, and I'd quite made up my mind to go;
  in fact, I should have been off this morning if I hadn't had this letter from
  his wife. You know what an inveterate old matchmaker she is. Well, here's a
  long epistle from her come by this post renewing her husband's invitation,
  and mentioning&mdash;quite casually, of course that they are expecting a
  young lady visitor, a very prodigy of learning and good looks. I know what
  all that means, and I shan't go to Evington Grange! I must go somewhere,
  though, hang it!" he concluded disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what, Feyne," exclaimed his friend: "it's an uncommonly lucky
  thing I looked in this morning! I can tell you the very place to
  go&mdash;where I've just come from, in fact!"</p>

  <p>"And where's that?"</p>

  <p>"A lonely farmhouse in the Charnwood Forest
  neighbourhood&mdash;Leicestershire, you know. Charming scenery, bracing air,
  comfortable quarters, and as quiet as you like. Just suit you."</p>

  <p>"I think it will."</p>

  <p>And that same afternoon Lawrence Feyne travelled down into Leicestershire,
  and took up his quarters&mdash;very comfortable quarters he found
  them&mdash;at Mr. Crooks' farm, near Ulverscroft.</p>

  <p>He was only thirty years old, this Lawrence Feyne, but he looked very much
  nearer forty. And no wonder, for he had worked from the day of his entering
  college with the energy of purpose and unremitting zeal of a man who had
  staked every hope and ambition in life upon the success of his labours.</p>

  <p>He had taken a high degree at Oxford, and had come up to London eight
  years back with the firm intention of fighting his way into the foremost
  ranks of the literary profession.</p>

  <p>At thirty years he was London correspondent to half a dozen provincial
  papers of high repute, sub-editor of a well-known weekly review, and was,
  besides, contributing to one of the foremost magazines occasional essays on
  various Greek plays, which were the delight of the classical world. He had
  made a name for himself, and society had opened to him its doors; but such
  was not the reward he coveted.</p>

  <p>Large cheques came to him from publishers and editors; but these he valued
  only as tokens of the success of his work, for he was a rich man without
  them, and could, had he chosen, have lived luxuriously without following any
  profession.</p>

  <p>His sole pleasure in life, however, appeared to be bound up in his work,
  and he lived the idyllic but unhealthy life of a literary hermit.</p>

  <p>He had taken this change just in time to avert an illness, and very soon
  began to feel its benefit.</p>

  <p>He sent for his books, and made up his mind to prolong his stay.</p>

  <p>One evening, about a fortnight after his arrival, just as he had returned
  from a long walk, the unusual sound of a vehicle stopping at the door drew
  him to the window.</p>

  <p>A fly had just arrived, and a lady, evidently young, although he could
  only see her back, was superintending the unloading of her boxes.</p>

  <p>Lawrence Feyne withdrew from the window somewhat annoyed, for only that
  morning Mrs. Crooks had assured him that she took in no other lodgers. When
  she came a short time later to lay the cloth for his evening meal, however,
  she explained the matter.</p>

  <p>The young lady, who had arrived quite unexpectedly, was a guest whom it
  was impossible not to receive. She was a Miss Clare, in whose family she
  (Mrs. Crooks) had been cook for fifteen years; and when she had left, Mr.
  Clare, the young lady's father, had lent the man whom she married enough
  money to start farming with.</p>

  <p>"We's both seen some trouble since them days," continued Mrs. Crooks,
  warming to her subject and suspending for a while her cloth-laying. "My
  'usband, he's a-died, though not before he's paid back Mr. Clare every penny
  he had from him, I'm proud to say; and Miss Edith, she's a-lost both her
  father and mother, poor dear, this many a year back. She often comes down
  here unexpected like, and powerful glad we are to see her, too; but I'm sure
  I never thought she'd be coming yet awhile again. She's a very quiet young
  lady, though, and I'm sure she'll not disturb you," added Mrs. Crooks
  anxiously, for she had no wish to lose so excellent a lodger.</p>

  <p>He hoped not; but, nevertheless, he was sorry to hear of this new arrival.
  He had felt so perfectly free and unrestrained, so completely out of the
  world in this quiet spot, and he feared that the contiguity and constant
  meeting with this young lady would, in a measure, destroy the charm of his
  seclusion. No doubt, too, she was a fashionable young lady, come down to
  recruit her health a little after a course of unusually late hours; for had
  not Mrs. Crooks said that she had come down for a rest?</p>

  <p>The next morning there came a telegram for Lawrence Feyne.</p>

  <p>The editor of the <i>Monthly</i> was particularly anxious to have the next
  of his series of articles for the forthcoming issue.</p>

  <p>It was rather an untimely request, but it was one which could scarcely be
  refused; so, somewhat reluctantly, he unpacked his little case of books and
  glanced them through, at first carelessly, then searchingly, with a frown on
  his face. It was as he had feared. The very book he most wanted he had left
  behind.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crooks herself hurried in, wiping her hands on her apron.</p>

  <p>"I want Tom to ride over to Leicester with a telegram," he said. "Can you
  spare him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can, sir," was the prompt reply. "I do hope there ain't
  anything amiss, sir?" she added anxiously, for telegrams were associated in
  Mrs. Crooks' mind with the most dire calamities.</p>

  <p>Her lodger explained the matter, and Mrs. Crooks looked much relieved, but
  still sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, what a pity!" she exclaimed. "I suppose it ain't a book that my
  Tom 'ud be likely to have&mdash;or the young lady, now? She be powerful
  clever and do always have a sight of books with her."</p>

  <p>Lawrence Feyne laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Tom's quite got to Greek yet," he said. "And the tragedies
  of Aeschylus and Sophocles don't often appear in a young lady's travelling
  library. No, I'll write the telegram out at once, if you'll be so good as to
  tell your son to get ready."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crooks withdrew, but reappeared almost immediately with a volume
  poised gingerly between her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Might this be the book, sir?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>He recognized it with a delighted exclamation. It was even a better
  edition than his own, and was full of valuable marginal notes, copied in a
  firm, decided handwriting.</p>

  <p>"Where on earth did this drop from?" he said, eagerly turning over the
  pages.</p>

  <p>"It's my young lady's, sir&mdash;Miss Clare's. I just told her that how
  you'd come without a Greekish book, which the end was something like 'supper
  please,' and she gave it me at once."</p>

  <p>"It's the most fortunate thing," he declared, settling himself down to
  write. "Pray tell Miss Clare that I'm exceedingly obliged to her; and, Mrs.
  Crooks, don't be alarmed if you hear me about during the night. I have a lot
  of work to do."</p>

  <p>All that day he worked without ceasing, and night came on and passed away,
  and daylight streamed in again at the window before he had finished. Then he
  folded up his work and went to his room.</p>

  <p>His head was throbbing fiercely, but he knew from experience that it was
  useless to seek sleep; so he plunged into his cold bath, and, dressing again
  quickly, turned out for a walk.</p>

  <p>He wandered through the park a little way, and then, turning back, climbed
  up the rocks at the back of the farm, and stood breathing in the pure,
  wholesome air.</p>

  <p>"Down! down! Tory, Rover, to heel! Tory, how dare you, sir! You bad
  dog!"</p>

  <p>Lawrence Feyne turned round abruptly, and found himself almost face to
  face with a girl who had come round the plantation, and thus suddenly upon
  him.</p>

  <p>She half smiled at the suddenness of the rencontre, and he, knowing whom
  she must be, raised his hat. "Good-morning. You are Miss Clare, I think?"</p>

  <p>She nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"And you are Mr. Feyne, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>He bowed.</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you exceedingly for the loan of your book!" he said
  gratefully. "But for your happening to have it, I fear I should have got into
  a row with my publishers. It was a very fortunate chance for me."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad," she remarked, stooping to pat Tory. "Besides, if I had
  not had it, I should probably have missed your essay in the <i>Monthly</i>.
  The good fortune was reciprocal, you see."</p>

  <p>He arched his eyebrows and appeared surprised. "Do you read the
  <i>Monthly</i>, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I was surprised to find you stopping with Hannah&mdash;I mean
  Mrs. Crooks. She told me directly I arrived that there was a great 'writer
  gentleman' from London here, and that I must be very quiet. I hope I have
  been," she asked, with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>He laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"I haven't even heard your voice," he answered her; "and if I had done, it
  would have been a&mdash;by no means an annoyance," he added a little
  awkwardly. "You see, I did not come here to work, and I don't mean to. I want
  a rest."</p>

  <p>"A rest! And yet I believe that you have been up all night writing."</p>

  <p>"I had to write that article, you know," he explained apologetically. "I
  have put away all my books now, though."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are very wise!" she declared. "Charming place this, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>He agreed with her, and after that there was a moment's silence. Then she
  summoned her dogs.</p>

  <p>"I must be going," she said. "We've been up to the top of Old John, and I
  must plead guilty to a ravenous appetite. Come, Tory; come, Rover; breakfast!
  Good-morning, Mr. Feyne!"</p>

  <p>He watched her admiringly as she ran gracefully down the steep path and
  vanished inside the farmhouse. "Who was she, this Miss Clare," he wondered,
  "who read Greek plays and walked with the grace of a Helen?" He felt just a
  little curious as he followed her indoors a few minutes later; and during
  breakfast he caught himself wondering more than once whether he should see
  her again during the day.</p>

  <p>He did. After breakfast he strolled round the back of the farm to the
  lake. She was there sketching, and welcomed him with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Going for a long walk this morning, Mr. Feyne?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet," he replied rather vaguely. "I dare say I shall. Don't
  you find it rather cold sitting still?"</p>

  <p>She confessed that she did.</p>

  <p>"I've only the barn to shade in, though," she added, "and then I shall
  have finished."</p>

  <p>He surveyed the drawing critically, approved of it, and smoked on in
  silence, apparently with the full intention of remaining there.</p>

  <p>"Don't let me keep you, Mr. Feyne, if you are thinking of starting," she
  said, after a long pause. "I shall be half an hour yet."</p>

  <p>"I'm in no hurry, thanks. But perhaps I'm hindering you?" he added.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I'm glad to have some one to talk to. Do you know, I
  thought it would be so delightful to come down here quite by myself for a
  week or two. I am a student, too, in a small way, you know," she added. "I
  came from Girton here."</p>

  <p>He stared at her, not a little surprised. This tall, graceful girl, with
  her clear grey eyes and winning smile, a Girton girl. Was it possible?</p>

  <p>"Do you know, those reference notes in that text-book you lent me were of
  immense service?"</p>

  <p>"I thought they would be," she answered modestly. "And now I have finished
  my drawing," she added, rising.</p>

  <p>"And I must go, I suppose?"&mdash;regretfully. "Don't you want to?" she
  said, gathering up her things.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," he acknowledged. "You see, I want to have a rest even from my
  thoughts for a day or two, and if I go off for a long walk I
  shan't&mdash;that is, if I go alone."</p>

  <p>"Then would you like to take Tory and me with you?" she said
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he replied gratefully. "That is exactly what I should
  like."</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant walk for both of them, and when they returned Lawrence
  Feyne acknowledged to himself that he had never enjoyed a walk more.</p>

  <p>A week passed away, and the two young visitors at Crooks' Farm became
  quite intimate. Only three weeks ago she had taken a degree, she told him one
  day, and had thereupon determined to spend a well-earned holiday with her old
  servant.</p>

  <p>"Although I ought to have gone to see an old friend of my mother's, Lady
  Keck, at Evington Grange. But I don't like her; she is such a meddlesome old
  creature."</p>

  <p>"How strange!" he exclaimed. "I, too, had an invitation there, and, as a
  special inducement, Lady Keck wrote and told me of the probable presence of a
  young lady of stupendous intellectual attainments&mdash;obviously you, Miss
  Clare."</p>

  <p>"And I," she said, laughing, "was invited specially to meet a pedantic
  hermit, who was one of the cleverest men in London&mdash;obviously you."</p>

  <p>"Strange that we should meet, after all!" he remarked, with a certain
  gravity.</p>

  <p>They wandered on in silence until they stood on Old John Hill. She leaned
  against the ruined tower, gazing over the panorama below. And as he stood by
  her side in silence, the truth slowly dawned upon him with an overwhelming,
  bewildering force&mdash;to-morrow was their last day, and he could not let
  her go.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the view lovely, Mr. Feyne?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of the view, Miss Clare," he said quietly. "I was
  thinking of you."</p>

  <p>"Of me?" And the soft grey eyes were turned upon him full of a mild,
  questioning surprise.</p>

  <p>Then they met his and faltered. With a sudden deep blush she looked
  away.</p>

  <p>"Edith," he said, "you know what I would ask you&mdash;to be my wife. Do
  you think you could care for me a little? Tell me!" he pleaded.</p>

  <p>Frankly, she raised her eyes, full of a new-born, tender light, and looked
  him in the face with quivering lips and a happy smile.</p>

  <p>"I think so," she said gently.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-13"
     id="ch-13"></a>13.&mdash;"DARTON'S SUCCESSOR"</h2>

  <p class="first">There were four of us when we first came to Stile's
  Row&mdash;Darton, Fred, Dick, and myself. Fred and I were old chums. We had
  been at college together, and, in palmier days, had shared a studio in St.
  John's Wood. Dick Maynard was a very prince of good fellows, but his career
  as an artist and a Bohemian was, unfortunately, nipped in the bud by an
  inconsiderate great-aunt, who died and left him a fortune. The old life had
  still some fascination for him, however, and when we moved to Stile's Row, he
  took the fourth studio there, and occasionally came and lectured about art.
  Darton, too, had been with us from the first; and, when he left, and his
  rooms stood empty, it was astonishing how little we missed him.</p>

  <p>Our tiny circle seemed only drawn the closer for his defection. Probably,
  as Fred remarked, it was only propinquity which had made him one of us at
  all. He had always had a hankering for the brazen pots of Philistinism.
  Penury had been a source of constant irritation to him. The small privations,
  which we had learnt to look upon as a sort of philosophic tolerance, galled
  him. The jest of empty pockets appealed in no way to his sense of humour. His
  Bohemianism had been only skin-deep. With us it seemed to have passed into
  our blood, and into the very sinews of our daily life. But that we were still
  human, however, we had soon to learn.</p>

  <p>Fred had brought his work into my room, one afternoon, and was standing
  before his easel gazing at an unfinished picture, with a frown upon his
  handsome face. There was a knock at the door. Fred looked at me and
  scowled.</p>

  <p>"It's that grocer Johnny," he remarked savagely. "He said he should come
  this afternoon. Who told him I was up here, I wonder? Meddlesome idiot! Hold
  on a minute!"</p>

  <p>He passed behind the high screen which partitioned off my room, and threw
  himself upon the bed. "Come in!" I called out.</p>

  <p>The door was opened, and a girl crossed the threshold. We did not want to
  see any woman about the place. In this respect we were peculiar, but sincere.
  I went on painting, without a second glance at her.</p>

  <p>"We neither of us want a model," I volunteered; "can't afford to pay them.
  Shut the door, please."</p>

  <p>She closed the door, but remained inside.</p>

  <p>"Can't you?" she said. "I am sorry. But, you see, I'm not a model."</p>

  <p>I turned round, and looked at her. She was tall, and she wore an artist's
  smock over a plain dark dress. As to her appearance, I have never attempted
  to describe her, and I never shall. Dick could do it by the hour. I never
  could. I only know that she was beautiful, and she stood there laughing at
  me.</p>

  <p>"I am your new neighbour," she explained, the corners of her mouth still
  twitching. "I have taken the rooms below, which a Mr. Darton used to have. Do
  you understand stoves? I have been trying to make some tea for half an hour,
  but, <I>voilà</I>! that is all I have succeeded in doing."</p>

  <p>She held up a pair of small, black hands, and laughed. I laughed too. It
  was irresistible.</p>

  <p>"Stoves?" I repeated. "I don't know; I'll come and see, if you like."</p>

  <p>"If you really wouldn't mind! Good gracious! What is that?"</p>

  <p>I followed her startled eyes. In his eagerness to see the new-comer, Fred
  had mounted on to my bed, and was looking over the screen. I frowned at him
  severely.</p>

  <p>"It's my friend," I explained. "He has the room above here, and he was
  working with me when you knocked. And the fact is, we thought you were a dun,
  so he was in retirement. Come out, Fred!"</p>

  <p>Fred appeared with a very red face, and bowed with such dignity as a man
  may who is wearing a dirty smock in lieu of a coat, and carpet slippers. But
  our visitor was very gracious.</p>

  <p>"My name is D'Auxelles," she said. "Come, both of you, and see if you can
  put my stove right, and I will give you some tea. That is, if you are not too
  busy, of course."</p>

  <p>Busy! We scouted the idea, and followed her down to the next floor.
  Darton's room was witnessing a metamorphosis indeed. We found the floor
  strewn with a motley collection of feminine belongings, including an easel,
  and all the paraphernalia of an artist. In the centre was a black iron
  tubular concern, emitting puffs of smoke from the top.</p>

  <p>"It is a patent arrangement," she remarked, looking at it thoughtfully.
  "The man from whom I bought it declared that it would cook anything, from an
  egg to a haunch of mutton. It only wants managing. Here is a book of
  instructions. I have tried to understand them, but I am so stupid!"</p>

  <p>She handed us a little pamphlet. It was all very simple. We went for it
  boldly.</p>

  <p>"I will cut some bread-and-butter and open the jam, while you boil the
  kettle," she proposed. "Perhaps you will be able to make some toast when you
  have found out how the thing works."</p>

  <p>"We will try," I answered dubiously. "The first thing to do is to
  thoroughly master the principle of the thing. Read those instructions again,
  Fred."</p>

  <p>We approached our task with a certain amount of cheerfulness. As time went
  on our faces fell, our complacency deserted us. Fred, with a great smut on
  his left cheek, had commenced to swear to himself softly, but with terrible
  earnestness. I was struggling with an insane desire to seek out the maker of
  the thing and kick him. She came over and stood by our side.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that you are not getting on very well," she remarked. She
  seemed disappointed.</p>

  <p>I rose to my feet. "The fact is, we are not getting on at all," I
  confessed. "There is a big fire in my room. Let us take the things in there
  and boil the kettle."</p>

  <p>"Delightful!" she exclaimed. "Here, hold out your hands."</p>

  <p>She loaded us with plates of bread-and-butter, and scones, and jam. Fred
  loitered behind to help her with the kettle. He muttered something about the
  handle being hot. At the door our eyes met, and he positively blushed. They
  were both carrying the kettle.</p>

  <p>Such an afternoon-tea my studio had never witnessed before. Certainly it
  will never witness anything of the sort again. She sat in my easy-chair, and
  we both waited upon her&mdash;with more than average clumsiness. But she
  enjoyed it. She told us a little about herself&mdash;not much. She was an
  orphan, and she had been living with some relatives in London who bored her.
  They were apparently addicted to the vice of fashionable life.
  Helen&mdash;she told us that we were to call her Helen&mdash;had only one
  desire: it was to become an artist. She did not tell us so point-blank, but
  we gathered that she had run away. That there was anything unusual in her
  having rooms in Stile's Row, Chelsea, she did not seem to appreciate in the
  least. She was sublimely unconscious&mdash;sublimely ignorant. She looked out
  upon life with a naive and eager curiosity. Bohemia was her Promised Land. To
  be a denizen in it seemed to be the limit of her desires. Her sex did not
  seem in the least to embarrass her. She talked to us as an equal and a
  comrade. We were artists. In less than half an hour we had forgotten our
  shabbiness and the poverty of our surroundings. We were all the best of
  friends. It was very surprising.</p>

  <p>After tea, she took out a dainty little cigarette-case, and smoked, while
  we showed her our work, or such part of it as we thought worthy of her
  inspection. Fred accepted a cigarette, and smoked it in lieu of his pipe. He
  told me afterwards that it was the best Egyptian cigarette he had ever
  tasted.</p>

  <p>When she left us, she held out her hand with a little impulsive
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye." she said, looking straight into my eyes. "I am so glad to have
  you two for neighbours, and I am sure that we shall be good friends. It is so
  good of you not to mind having a girl as a fellow-worker!"</p>

  <p>In turn we bowed over her hand. Fred mumbled a little speech, but I said
  nothing. Then we went back to my fire, and smoked, and looked at one another
  stealthily through the twilight. Perhaps the same thought was there with both
  of us. Through the curling smoke from my pipe, as it spread around in faint,
  dim wreaths, I seemed to see something in the future which might come between
  us two&mdash;a little crack in the wall of our treasured
  friendship&mdash;just a scratch, but a scratch which might easily become a
  chasm. And then Fred&mdash;a fellow of great heart was Fred&mdash;laid his
  hand upon that crack, and sealed it up for ever. Through the shadows, I could
  see his soft eyes&mdash;he had woman's eyes&mdash;turned full upon me, and
  his hand thrust forward.</p>

  <p>"Friends!"</p>

  <p>I leaned forward, and clasped his hand.</p>

  <p>"Always!"</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A woman brings change as the spring brings flowers, but with us the change
  was not what we had dreaded. These were the halcyon days of our Bohemianism.
  We had a new comrade&mdash;gay, fascinating, sympathetic. Dick, too, came
  under the charm, Dick, the hardened young misogynist, who railed at women as
  at the plagues of Egypt. But Dick had mixed with women freely, and her
  society was never to him what it was to Fred and myself. Our evenings no
  longer hung fire. We had little dinners at Mariette's&mdash;more than we
  could afford&mdash;and we generally wound up the evening at a music-hall, or
  one of the exhibitions. Fred, somewhat shyly, had brought out a dress coat
  and unearthed a tall hat. I, with a sigh, furbished up my old clothes, for I
  was very poor in those days. Not that Helen ever cost us a penny; she paid
  her share of everything from the start, and she would have been grievously
  offended if we had treated her in any way otherwise than as one of ourselves.
  We even told her of our custom&mdash;the sale of a picture meant a dinner at
  Mariette's, if the price allowed it&mdash;and she clapped her hands with
  delight. But from that time she always seemed to be selling a picture; dainty
  little things they were, too! We seldom saw a purchaser, but her gay little
  summons became a familiar thing. And we went without hesitation. Helen had a
  way of making us do what she wanted. Our constant study was to keep her
  amused and interested, for there was just one disturbing element in the
  happiness of our days. Helen would get tired of her life in a shabby suburban
  street, with only us three men for her companions. She would get tired of it,
  and go away. So we humoured her like a child, watching her face to see if she
  were amused when we took her out, drinking sweet Moselle for dinner without a
  single wry face, holding frequent consultations, and studying her in every
  way that occurred to us. And, on the whole, we succeeded. As to her painting,
  we had no difficulty in keeping her interested in it. We taught her a little,
  and she was always eager to learn. She had talent, and her work, if it was
  not of a very high order, had a charm and originality of her own, She was a
  flower-painter. Often Fred and I found our way to Covent Garden, in the fresh
  spring twilight before the dawn, in search of roses for her, and saw the sun
  rise as we strode homewards together through the dim, silent streets. And on
  those occasions we said very little. But we each knew the other's mind.</p>

  <p>There came a morning when Helen waltzed into my room, waving her hands
  above her head, and, with a fine flourish, came to a standstill before me.
  "Who will come with me into the Land of Goshen?" she cried breathlessly. "I
  want to go to my dressmaker, and to see the rhododendrons in the Park. Who
  will come?"</p>

  <p>She looked at me, but I kept my eyes upon my work. Alas! I had no garments
  for the West.</p>

  <p>"We have only one tall hat between us," I said sorrowfully, "and it will
  not fit me. Fred must be your escort."</p>

  <p>Fred was already tearing off his smock, and handling the clothes-brush.
  She turned away slowly.</p>

  <p>"I shall be ready in ten minutes," she said, without looking at me any
  more. "Don't dare to keep me waiting!"</p>

  <p>I laid down my brush and watched them cross the street. Fred, tall and
  aristocratic, wearing his shabby clothes with an air of a prince, and
  Helen&mdash;what a metamorphosis! she had become a woman of fashion. She was
  wearing the garments of a world which had no kin with ours, wearing them
  gracefully and naturally. I watched them until they were out of sight, and an
  odd thing happened to me. I, a hardened outcast from the world, a wanderer in
  its by-ways, a would-be cynic, became suddenly the slave of an emotional
  crisis. A mist swam before my eyes, a lump crept into my throat. My brush
  slipped from my nerveless fingers. I was leaning against my easel, and my
  head was resting in my clasped hands. This, then, was what I had made of
  life! My best years were stealing away. Middle-age stared me in the face.
  What had I made of myself? What was I?&mdash;a vagabond, a strolling artist,
  a loiterer along the broad avenue, at whose end was the Temple of Fame, with
  my hands in my pockets, while others girded up their loins, and passed me,
  now one by one, now in a stream. The ignominy of content stung me to the
  quick. The sunshine seemed slipping from my life. And I knew whence had come
  this phase of sudden realization. I turned upon myself with a new fury. Fool
  A nameless artist, without money, or repute, a parasite hanging on to a
  little back-corner of the world. What folly! what folly!</p>

  <p>When they returned, I knew at once that something had gone wrong. Helen
  went straight to her room, and Fred came hurrying in to me with a white
  troubled face. He threw off his hat and coat, and commenced filling his pipe
  with trembling fingers.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked softly.</p>

  <p>He answered me with an oath&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We have seen some of her people. They were in the Park. We got into a
  hansom, but they gave chase. One of them has spotted us down. They will find
  her out. They will make her go back!"</p>

  <p>We looked at one another aghast.</p>

  <p>"Go to the window," he directed.</p>

  <p>I went.</p>

  <p>"Is there a fellow in a long coat watching the house?"</p>

  <p>A man in a frock-coat stood opposite, smoking a cigarette, and looking up.
  I pointed him out to Fred.</p>

  <p>"I should like to wring his neck!" muttered Fred, looking over my
  shoulder. "It was he who saw us, that is his carriage at the corner. He is
  waiting for the others."</p>

  <p>A brougham, drawn by a pair of dark horses, turned into the narrow street.
  The man who was waiting handed out a lady, and together they entered the
  house. Helen came running into our room.</p>

  <p>"They have found me out!" she cried sadly. "I shall have to go away!"</p>

  <p>I pointed below. "They have come for you already," I said.</p>

  <p>She was very pale, and her eyes were wonderfully soft.</p>

  <p>"This has been a mad freak of mine," she said, "but I shall never regret
  it&mdash;never! It will be a little corner of my life which I shall cherish.
  You two, and Mr. Dick, have been so good to me. You have been like brothers.
  You will come and see me afterwards, won't you?"</p>

  <p>We promised sadly, and without enthusiasm. She shook hands with us and
  hurried away.</p>

  <p>We heard her greet the new-comers on the landing. They all went together
  into her room. Fred and I looked into each other's eyes. Then he rushed away,
  and I heard the door of his room slam. I was alone!</p>

  <p>I sank into my chair, and I closed my eyes. After all, it was for the
  best. The thing could not have gone on. And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>And then my little chain of reasoning snapped and fell to the ground. I
  saw only her face. I gave way to the strong, sweet delight of memory. I
  fashioned my own picture, and the breath of life seemed to be in it.
  Everything was so real&mdash;her soft, bright voice, the silken rustling of
  her skirts, the dainty trifles of her toilette&mdash;all those soft,
  indefinable suggestions of femininity, which had been like a revelation to
  me. Then&mdash;surely I was dreaming, or had my picture taken
  life?&mdash;there was a light step in the room, the faint swish of a trailing
  skirt, the sweet odour of violets. I kept my eyes half-closed. I would not
  look up or move my head. It was too sweet! I dared not risk losing it. Nearer
  and nearer it came. A woman's soft breath fell upon my cheeks. Something
  touched my lips&mdash;something warm and delicate and trembling. Again the
  swish of a skirt, the opening and dosing of a door.</p>

  <p>Silence!</p>

  <p>I opened my eyes. Of course it was a dream, but on my knee was a little
  cluster of violets.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>In the morning I had a visitor. Fred was away. I turned to meet him, his
  card in my hand, with clenched teeth and white face. He stood and bowed, a
  white-haired, courteous old gentleman. My resentment faded away.</p>

  <p>"You will pardon the liberty&mdash;Mr. Montavon, I believe?"</p>

  <p>I bowed, and pointed to my chair. He looked at it through his eye-glass,
  and declined it politely.</p>

  <p>"I have only a moment," he said. "I am here at the request of the
  guardians of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of Miss D'Auxelles," I said.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows and bowed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Of Miss D'Auxelles. I applaud your discretion, sir; it makes my
  task easier. Her guardians wish me to convey their thanks&mdash;their sincere
  thanks&mdash;to you, for the kindness and consideration which you showed
  their ward in her late most extraordinary escapade. They feel that your
  behaviour, and the behaviour of your friends, whom I regret not to have met,
  was most exceptional. I offer you their most heartfelt gratitude, and from
  the young lady&mdash;this."</p>

  <p>I took the little parcel, and bowed.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing at all exceptional in our treatment to the young lady,"
  I said dryly; "nor can I see that there was anything very extraordinary in
  what you term her escapade.' We are not in the middle-ages!"</p>

  <p>He took up his hat, looking at me fixedly, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will doubtless understand better when you have examined the little
  offering from the young lady," he remarked. "Good-morning, sir."</p>

  <p>He left me with another bow. I tore open the covering of the parcel, and
  slowly opened a jeweller's case. A magnificent opal pin, set with diamonds,
  flashed up at me from a bed of purple velvet. I scarcely noticed it, for I
  was unfolding with trembling fingers a little scrap of paper, on which was a
  single line of writing&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><i>"From your comrade and sister, Helen, Princess
  d'Auxelles."</i></p><br>

  <p>Then I understood.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch-14"
     id="ch-14"></a>14.&mdash;MY LITERARY EXECUTORSHIP</h2>

  <p class="first">Let me first explain how I became acquainted with Mr. Samuel
  Gredson, of 118, Great Russell Street, and the circumstances which led to the
  somewhat embarrassing legacy, part of which I am here endeavouring to relieve
  myself of.</p>

  <p>Like myself he was a book-lover, and it was this common taste which
  brought us together. At every sale of books of any importance since I can
  remember, save one, he had been present, and it was a little incident in
  connection with this one which resulted in our becoming on speaking terms.
  There had been a somewhat meagre attendance, and, in consequence, several
  bargains had fallen in my way. Consequently, when I gathered up my
  newly-acquired treasures and turned to leave the sale-rooms, I was in an
  unusually amiable frame of mind.</p>

  <p>Just as I was on the point of emerging into the street, an incident
  occurred which, had I been in anything less than a seraphic mood for me,
  would certainly have thrown me into a violent temper. I was carelessly run
  into, my worst corn trodden upon, and very nearly upset by an individual who
  was evidently in a desperate hurry, and whose frantic haste seemed to me, to
  say the least of it, reprehensible.</p>

  <p>Now, not being near-sighted myself, I particularly object to being
  collided against, either in the street or anywhere else. I had opened my
  mouth to make a remark which would have been more or less forcible, when I
  recognized my assailant, and closed it again. My anger melted into pity. It
  was my rival and fellow-collector, and he had come too late for the sale.</p>

  <p>Like myself, Mr. Samuel Gredson had escaped the snare of good looks. In
  other words, he was decidedly ugly. Neither had he that repose of demeanour,
  and collectedness of spirit, which a judicious course of philosophy is said
  to impart. He stood on one leg (I had trodden on the toes of his other foot),
  with his mouth wide open, glaring up at me from behind a pair of thick, blue
  spectacles, and clutching convulsively at my arm. As he said nothing I began
  to feel uneasy. The situation was, to say the least of it, peculiar.</p>

  <p>"Are you unwell?" I inquired hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>He found breath to speak at last; but he took no notice of my question,
  which I thought a little rude.</p>

  <p>"Lot 187, is it sold?" he faltered out in a thin squeaky tone.</p>

  <p>"It is," I answered with some dignity. "I am the purchaser."</p>

  <p>He made use of an expression which I feel justified in keeping to myself.
  It sounded very big and very profane, though, from such a little morsel of
  humanity.</p>

  <p>"Will you sell?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>I hesitated. To tell the truth, I had bought the book to sell. It was a
  first edition, and far too expensive for my shelves. He saw the hesitation,
  and a gleam of joy shone in his furrowed face.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," he said, plucking me by the arm. "Not a word! Not a word!
  Come with me!"</p>

  <p>Not being in a particular hurry I humoured him, and allowed myself to be
  dragged into a hansom. During our drive I endeavoured to open the
  negotiations, but he declined to listen to me.</p>

  <p>"Not a word! Not a word!" he repeated, drumming with both fists upon the
  cab apron. I looked at him in amazement, and conceived an opinion with regard
  to his sanity, which, as I have since recalled it, need not be mentioned
  here.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the cab pulled up at 118, Great Russell Street. My
  companion jumped out lightly, paid the driver, and gave a tremendous peal at
  the bell. A man-servant in sober black livery answered it, and, seeing us,
  fell back respectfully. I was hurried across the hall, through a handsomely
  furnished dining-room, in which I have since eaten some excellent dinners,
  and into one of the finest libraries I have ever seen in any private
  house.</p>

  <p>My new friend took me by the arm, and hurried me towards a particular
  section. Here he stooped down and reverently ran his finger along a row of
  ancient calf-bound volumes.</p>

  <p>"Decamerons, first editions, every one of them," he exclaimed, with bated
  breath. "Yours only is wanted to make the set complete. What will you take
  for it?</p>

  <p>"I gave twenty-five guin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will give you fifty," he interrupted, his voice trembling with
  excitement. "It is worth it&mdash;it is dirt cheap."</p>

  <p>"I will take thirty-five," I answered; "neither more nor less. That is its
  value."</p>

  <p>"Done," he cried; and, going to his cabinet, he wrote me a cheque with
  shaking fingers...</p>

  <p>That is how I came to know Samuel Gredson. We were continually meeting one
  another after that, and we became, to a certain extent, intimate. We had a
  common hobby, we were both bachelors, and we were both ugly; besides which
  there were other less important points concerning which we were in sympathy.
  Our meetings were always at his house. Once, I remember, I asked him to dine
  with me; but on that occasion he made himself so disagreeable that I never
  asked him again. To this day his memory is unpopular in my household, amongst
  who it is commonly reported that on leaving he expressed himself as thirsting
  for the blood of my cook. The subject was not afterwards mentioned between
  us; but it was tacitly understood that the hospitality in future should be on
  his side.</p>

  <p>He was at no time a great talker, nor was he in the least communicative.
  He never told me anything of his family or his past history, nor was I in any
  way curious. But now I think of it I can remember more than one occasion
  towards the end of an evening over a farewell pipe, when he had exhibited
  signs of uneasiness, as though he had something in his mind which he was half
  disposed to communicate to me. But having no idea of the tremendous
  revelation which trembled on his lips, I never gave him any encouragement,
  and so that revelation has descended to me as a legacy.</p>

  <p>I was at Leamington when he was taken ill, but I returned to town at once.
  Notwithstanding my haste he was past all articulate speech when I arrived,
  but he was still conscious, and a faint gleam of pleasure struggled across
  his homely face when I entered the room. He drew out a thin, trembling hand
  from underneath the coverlet, and placed it in mine. He tried to speak, but
  it was useless, and the effort snapped the thin thread by which his life had
  been hanging. He closed his eyes and died.</p>

  <p>After the funeral the lawyer read the will to me, and to my surprise I
  found myself the legatee of a handsome sum of money and a long list of
  valuable books from his library, on condition that at my death they were
  passed on with the rest of his collection to the British Museum. There was
  also a sealed letter to me, which from its size and weight I judged to be of
  some length. After the lawyer had offered me his congratulations and
  departed, I ordered in the lamp, and then and there broke the seal, with very
  little idea of what lay in store for me. Word for word, without comment or
  explanation, I here give its contents to the world, according to his
  wish&mdash;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>"MY DEAR HAMILTON&mdash;Some one has remarked in one of those fine musty
  old volumes which you and I prize so much, that the man to whom genius or
  talent has been given, is, as it were, the trustee of a divine charity, and
  that he will be judged hereafter according to the use which he has made of
  his gifts. By a similar process of reasoning the man to whom some hidden
  force of nature has been revealed, is bound to communicate the same to his
  fellows. That I may be acquitted of guilt in this respect, I am leaving you
  this letter as a legacy. Do with it as you think well. I rely altogether upon
  your judgment. But you may take the word of a dying man that its contents are
  a true and faithful narration of what happened to me on the night of October
  the nineteenth, 19&mdash;.</p>

  <p>"I have held my peace during my lifetime for a certain reason. As a
  generation we are only on the threshold of knowledge after many thousand
  years of profound thought and scientific research. But it is a fact we do not
  care to own to. We are sensitive on the subject of our ignorance, and we seek
  to veil it by an affectation of scepticism. The things which are beyond our
  understanding we ridicule. The effects which our puny, half-developed
  reasoning faculties cannot trace back to a definite cause we refuse to
  credit, however plainly they be before our eyes. It is the old story of
  ignorance holding up before her eyes the cloak of narrow-sighted and
  narrow-minded prejudice; and babbling forth with a sweet, but intensely
  provoking imperturbation the same threadbare tale of disbelief in the
  existence of phenomena irreconcilable with her miserable imperfect notions of
  existence. And realizing all this I have held my peace even from you, friend,
  for I have no mind to have my story received with banter and ridicule, to be
  congratulated upon my imagination, and to have my earnestness met by renewed
  incredulity and mirth."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"This then is what I might have told you, Hamilton, you and all the world,
  if I had not been withheld by these considerations, that I myself have been
  for a brief period a shadowy member of that mysterious indefinable
  spirit-land, which is regarded with so much irreverent superstition and
  obstinate scepticism by the unlearned of this ignorant generation. Miraculous
  this may sound; I care not, for it is true.</p>

  <p>"It happened seven years ago on the night of the nineteenth of October,
  19&mdash;, whilst my body lay writhing in the throes of a well-nigh mortal
  sickness, and my life hung upon a thread, there stole over me suddenly a
  feeling of great peace, and a cessation of all pain. The familiar objects in
  my room, and the faces around my bed-side, faded away in a dim mist, and at
  first I thought that it was death. But it was not so. My senses, some of them
  at least, were still with me, and they were evidences that the spirit of life
  was not yet altogether quenched. I seemed for a while to be in a state of
  trance, unable to rightly determine in what conditions or amongst what
  surroundings I was still permitted to exist, until, like the sound of some
  monastery bell over the clear surface of unrippled waters, I heard my own
  name softly breathed, and I awoke from my chaotic torpor. Slowly my senses
  returned to me; I was in my own library, seated in my own easy chair.
  Everything around me was as it had always been, except that a thick layer of
  dust rested upon the furniture, which seemed to me to have become old and
  shabby, whilst long cobwebs hung down from the ceiling, and were stretched
  across my bookcases and shelves. Seated on a high stool by the side of one of
  these latter, was a man with his back to me, evidently absorbed in reading a
  volume which he had just reached down from the shelf. As he appeared to be a
  complete stranger to me, and was at any rate there without my invitation, I
  felt it necessary in some measure to assert myself. Accordingly I cleared my
  throat, and with some slight misgivings gave vent to a little cough. There
  was no result. I repeated it a little louder, and the intruder, for as such I
  regarded him, turned slowly round, and retaining a finger in the book which
  he half closed, gazed mildly down upon me. He certainly was not a
  formidable-looking personage. His frail form was clothed in garments of
  ancient cut and style; but my eyes passed these over carelessly, and dwelt
  upon his mobile oval face, with its gentle expression, half humorous, half
  pathetic, and looked into his soft brown eyes, full of a mild, interested
  inquiry. Where had I seen that face before? Nowhere, I was assured, and yet
  it seemed in a sense familiar, nay, more than familiar, like the face of an
  old friend.</p>

  <p>"I looked at him wondering, and he returned my gaze with a quiet
  curiosity, unmixed with any impatience or annoyance; then he spoke in a low,
  silvery tone, with a faint, yet wonderfully sweet smile, hovering over his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"'You seem surprised to see me here,' he said. 'It is the b&mdash;books;
  and he waved his hand towards the well-filled shelves, which have been the
  one interest and pride of my life.</p>

  <p>"My slight resentment (although I am naturally a choleric man) was all
  disarmed by his gentle speech, and I hastened to reply, 'You are welcome,
  quite welcome. But will you tell me who you are? Your face seems familiar,
  and yet I cannot remember.'</p>

  <p>"He interrupted me with a musical little laugh, 'Ah! you are f&mdash;fresh
  amongst us. Welcome! You should know m&mdash;me if these are all your books.
  You have r&mdash;read this, and this?'</p>

  <p>"He touched two volumes with his forefinger, and looked up at me
  pleasantly. They were the <i>Essays of Elia</i>, and I knew in a moment in
  whose presence I was. I was dumb.</p>

  <p>"'I&mdash;I'm glad you've come this way,' he went on, changing his
  position to a somewhat easier one, and laying down the volume which he had
  been reading.'I&mdash;I've been longing for a g&mdash;g&mdash;gossip with
  some one f&mdash;fresh. Beaconsfield&mdash;I beg his p&mdash;pardon, he was a
  Lord, wasn't he?&mdash;was the last kindred spirit with whom I could
  g&mdash;g&mdash;get a word, and he wouldn't stop. I don't think he
  c&mdash;cared much about me, and d&mdash;directly he saw Burke he rushed off
  after him, and they've b&mdash;b&mdash;been discussing the French
  R&mdash;R&mdash;Revolution ever since. Hang the French R&mdash;Revolution!
  Coleridge talked me sick of it long ago, and then M&mdash;Milton comes and
  hammers it all in a&mdash;again the other way. Seen Coleridge yet?'</p>

  <p>"I shook my head; speech was impossible.</p>

  <p>"'No? Ah, there is something for you to look forward to then. We must get
  him away from K&mdash;Kant for a minute or two and have a c&mdash;chat with
  him. P&mdash;P&mdash;Perhaps you haven't been amongst us l&mdash;long. You
  seem a trifle d&mdash;dazed. I was when I f&mdash;first came,
  c&mdash;c&mdash;couldn't understand it at all. We're here to get rid of our
  b&mdash;bad habits, you know. P&mdash;Punning and swearing were m&mdash;my
  worst, but I am g&mdash;getting out of them fast. It isn't such a very
  unpleasant sort of existence a&mdash;after all.'</p>

  <p>"'And the old familiar faces,' I ventured to ask, 'are they here?'</p>

  <p>"He smiled, as though well pleased at the quotation.</p>

  <p>"'M&mdash;Manning is here,' he said, and old George Dyer, and Talfourd,
  and C&mdash;C&mdash;Crabb Robinson, C&mdash;Coleridge I t&mdash;told you
  of.'</p>

  <p>"'And And Cousin Bridget?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"His lips parted in a sweet, half melancholy smile, as he answered me; it
  was a kind of ethereal smile, which, while it lasted, lent his face an almost
  angelic beauty.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! no, Mary had no faults,' he said softly, none save that
  she&mdash;loved me more than I deserved. I shall s&mdash;see her, some day,
  in a better place.'</p>

  <p>"' And Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson, Massinger, Beaumont and Fletcher, and
  Kit Marlowe, and the others of the old school?' I inquired eagerly. 'Where
  are they? Shall I see them?'</p>

  <p>"He looked more cheerful at me."</p>

  <p>"'Shakespeare is here, but we are not friendly. Beaumont, Massinger,
  Marlowe, Burns, Chapman, Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, and Hartley I see most of.
  Beaumont and Fletcher and M&mdash;Marlowe p&mdash;profess themselves much
  indebted to me. I know n&mdash;not why it should be so. Smollett, too, thinks
  that h&mdash;he owes something to my c&mdash;championship. It is k&mdash;kind
  of them all, but I think that they make too much of m&mdash;my p&mdash;poor
  commendations.'</p>

  <p>"'I should never have read Smollett but for your praise of him,' I said.
  You said that you were not friends with Shakespeare. Does he owe you
  nothing?'</p>

  <p>"He thinks not; Mary would be troubled if she k&mdash;knew it, but he
  likes little our t&mdash;tales, and less my essay on his
  t&mdash;t&mdash;tragedies. I wish I'd let 'em alone. Every one seems to have
  a c&mdash;craving to be most noted f&mdash;for the least worthy p&mdash;part
  of their work. Shakespeare desired to reign f&mdash;for ever in men's
  thoughts as a dramatist. He lives as a p&mdash;poet. He should be satisfied,
  but he isn't. I wish the handful of m&mdash;men and women who remember me,
  thought of me s&mdash;sometimes as a humble p&mdash;poet, instead of a
  critic. Hazlitt was a finer c&mdash;critic than I. His table t&mdash;talk's
  worth the l&mdash;lot of my poor essays. There are one or t&mdash;two which
  it p&mdash;pleases me to think have not been b&mdash;buried. The r&mdash;rest
  I don't care twopence about. Seen the old l&mdash;lakey poet yet? Ah, I
  f&mdash;forgot he only just passed through with Dorothy.'</p>

  <p>"'And Southey?'</p>

  <p>"'He is in a b&mdash;better place. Dear old Southey. He will be
  h&mdash;happy with Dante and Chaucer and Spenser. Ah! there will be a
  m&mdash;meeting for us all some day.'</p>

  <p>"There was something which I longed to ask, but I feared to. At last I
  blurted it out.</p>

  <p>"'There was, some of us thought, a living Alice. Were we right? Don't
  answer me unless you like.'</p>

  <p>"Again that wonderfully sweet smile illuminated his refined face, and
  hovered for a while upon his lips, full of tender regret, and ineffable
  sorrow. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'The l&mdash;love which I lost on earth, I c&mdash;c&mdash;can never win
  now,' he said slowly. Earthly love can be renewed here and above, but
  n&mdash;n&mdash;new affections cannot be k&mdash;kindled, and she
  n&mdash;never k&mdash;knew that I loved her. In h&mdash;heaven as on earth
  the children of Alice call Bartram father. B&mdash;But I shall have
  M&mdash;Mary,' he added, speaking in a lighter tone. 'Dear Mary! Who could
  take her place?'</p>

  <p>"None with him, I knew. The love of such a brother for such a sister,
  immaculate in its purity, having for its basis self-sacrifice, and
  strengthened by the companionship of a lifetime, could not find its
  annihilation in the grave of either. Fittest love for him in the future as it
  was here. Best for him, and happiest for her. 'There are others who should be
  with you?' I said after a short pause. 'Ben Jonson and Bowles?'</p>

  <p>"His face clouded over again, as he sadly shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Poor old Ben! I scarcely looked for him. To t&mdash;tell the
  t&mdash;truth I was s&mdash;surprised to see K&mdash;Kit Marlowe; and
  B&mdash;Bowles, it will be long before we see him, but we shall some day.
  T&mdash;Talking about Jonson though, the old D&mdash;Doctor is here, and
  h&mdash;hates me almost as m&mdash;much as I'm afraid of him.
  G&mdash;Goldsmith's here too. I m&mdash;must co&mdash;confess I was relieved
  to see him, for he was a bad lot was little Goldfish. Shelley and Byron and
  Scott are w&mdash;wandering about somewhere, but we don't speak. They say I
  slighted 'em, and very likely I did. I never understood Shelley, and Byron
  was a sensual animal, for all his poetry. K&mdash;Keath was worth the pair of
  'em. Scott I underrated perhaps. He should have written the story of
  J&mdash;Jeannie Deans before Waverley.'</p>

  <p>"There was one whose name I only ventured to utter timidly, for I dreaded
  the answer, and with reason. Most brilliant of writers, but most contemptible
  of men. Poor De Quincey! Hartley Coleridge has sobbed for you, and Elia
  dropped a tear upon my book; would that there had been no cause. I asked a
  question, another personal one, it was answered readily.</p>

  <p>"'You are right,' he acknowledged with gentle emphasis. I ought never to
  have left the East India House. I might have survived even Coleridge's
  d&mdash;death, if there had been something which I was b&mdash;b&mdash;bound
  to do. There was n&mdash;nothing, and it k&mdash;killed me. Poor Mary was so
  much away, and the d&mdash;days seemed so long when they all b&mdash;belonged
  to me, that I was e'en wishing them over before they had begun. Ah f those
  d&mdash;deadly l&mdash;l&mdash;long summer all day days, with but a short
  hour's candle-light, and no f&mdash;fire-light, I g&mdash;grew tired of them,
  I c&mdash;can't tell you.'</p>

  <p>"'And yet,' I said, 'we have thought it strange that when you had your
  entire freedom you did not start some more continuous, more voluminous work.
  A novel for instance, or a drama.'</p>

  <p>"He shook his head, in grave but gentle dissent.</p>

  <p>"'No, no, I had never the heart to attempt another drama after "John
  Woodvill." Even when I tried my hand at a f&mdash;farce, M. H. you know, it
  was a rank failure. Mary and I ourselves h&mdash;hissed it f&mdash;from the
  pit. It read well enough, but it was p&mdash;poor rubbish on the stage.
  Criticism suited me best. I was never a genius. I only had the g&mdash;gift
  in a slight degree of detecting it in others. A c&mdash;copyist. An imitator
  with a style, though a very p&mdash;poor one, of my own. That was me. Hazlitt
  surpassed me in my own d&mdash;domain, but he always k&mdash;kept at
  l&mdash;loggerheads with the world, and they all h&mdash;hated him.'</p>

  <p>"'He was a cynic,' I answered, 'and the world hates cynicism when it is
  directed against itself. Hazlitt was always unfashionable and out of date.
  Yet he wrote English eloquently.'</p>

  <p>"'N&mdash;None more so, n&mdash;none more so,' assented his friend
  earnestly, would that I had had his style. My poor scribblings ever seemed to
  me frivolous by the side of his logical trenchant essays, as p&mdash;polished
  and s&mdash;sparkling as a well cut diamond. What thought the world of
  G&mdash;Godwin when you left it? As little as ever?'</p>

  <p>"'Less,' I answered decidedly. 'A hopelessly black sheep. Some day his
  works will be entirely obsolete. The sooner the better.'</p>

  <p>"'And of Byron and Shelley. They were of his school, you know.'</p>

  <p>"'Their works live; Byron is the more popular, but Shelley will live the
  longer in men's thoughts. He is something mystical, but always sublime. Byron
  is sometimes commonplace, often vulgar. But he is more in touch with
  mankind.'</p>

  <p>"'He is of a lower type,' interrupted my gentle questioner energetically.
  'Shelley I knew and liked, Byron I always esteemed a&mdash;a&mdash;a
  low-bred, sensual pot-poet, a creature of sense, a living example of the
  triumph of p&mdash;passion over mind. He might have been a great poet, if he
  had not been an ignoble man. The spirit of poetry was there, but it was
  dragged through the mire, and p&mdash;p&mdash;prostituted by the man. How
  think people of him now?'</p>

  <p>"'Better than he deserves. Bowles has not lived, alas! Nor is Landor
  read!'</p>

  <p>"'Nor have I lived as a poet,' he remarked, with a shade of sadness in his
  tone. Yet methought some of my sonnets were p&mdash;p&mdash;passable, though
  Coleridge used to pull them to bits. I did wrong to publish with Lloyd and
  him. I should have stood better alone. My poor g&mdash;glimmering light was
  quenched by the radiance of his glory. He was spoken of as a poet, and I as a
  p&mdash;poor p&mdash;punster, who had a talent for writing verses, some
  g&mdash;good, some b&mdash;bad. Ah! well, one is an ill judge of one's own
  work. I never thought that those hasty fragments, not worthy of the title of
  essays, would live beyond their day.'</p>

  <p>"'They will live for ever,' I exclaimed enthusiastically. As long as there
  is an English-speaking people, the <i>Essays of Elia</i> will be amongst the
  classics of their literature.'</p>

  <p>"He looked up with a gratified protest trembling upon his lips. Suddenly
  his expression changed, and he threw down the book with which he had been
  trifling.</p>

  <p>"'Here comes the king of bullies,' he exclaimed hurriedly. Farewell, sir;
  I am away. He is seeking me. Farewell.'</p>

  <p>"By what means I know not, but before the echoes of his last word had died
  away he was gone, and while I sat there wondering, another figure loomed
  before me. I looked up and saw standing in his place a stout, elderly man, of
  unwieldy figure, dressed in a slovenly, old-fashioned style, with a wig all
  awry, and dirty hands. His expression was remarkably stern, and his tone,
  when he spoke, was censorious and autocratic, almost bombastic.</p>

  <p>"'Sir, have you observed a small lean man, hanging about in this chamber;
  a miserable, shrunken up little punster? Charles Lamb they call him. I seek
  him, but he eludes me.'</p>

  <p>"I surveyed the questioner, meditating an angry reply, but while it yet
  trembled on my lips the knowledge of his identity dawned upon me, and I was
  dumb. He waited for an answer, but receiving none he turned angrily away.</p>

  <p>"'Sir, you are a jackass, a consummate jackass,' he remarked
  energetically, after which polite valediction he, too, vanished.</p>

  <p>"Shades of the illustrious dead! Whom next was I to see? Charles Lamb and
  Dr. Johnson, what might not be in store for me? I sat there excited, full of
  anticipations, forgetful almost of the strange state in which I was. Then
  suddenly I became conscious that a change was coming, the room and floor
  seemed to recede from me, and darkness swam before my eyes. I felt hands
  passed around me, and I felt myself being carried away out of the room and
  upstairs to my bed. Then I must have slept, for when I awoke it was broad
  daylight.</p>

  <p>"The part of my adventure which I am now going to tell, and which fills me
  with indignation, is this: When I recovered sufficiently to tell my tale, I
  was disbelieved. The doctor laughed at me, and the nurse, although she
  admitted that during a heavy sleep I had risen from my bed and been found in
  the library, declared that I was in a stupefied state all the time. When I
  protested, the doctor smilingly assured me that it was an hallucination. I
  knocked that doctor down, weak though I was, and he was careful in future how
  he alluded to the matter. But it didn't mend things at all. Every one to whom
  I commenced to tell the story behaved in the same idiotic way. They all
  listened, and they all shook their heads with the same provoking smile, Then,
  in disgust, I left off attempting to tell it; but lest any should say
  hereafter that I did wrong in keeping to myself so strange and unprecedented
  an adventure, I here hand over a full and exact account of it to you, friend
  Hamilton, and on to your shoulders I shift the responsibility of its
  narration, or non-narration. I shall not hear them sneer who read it
  incredulously, nor shall I gain the sympathy of those who honour me by
  believing it. But at any rate, I shall know that I have done my duty in
  leaving behind me for the world's derision or wonder, the true facts of my
  unique visit to another stage of human, or rather spiritual existence."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Word for word, line for line, I have here reproduced the manuscript left
  in my keeping by my friend, Samuel Gredson. I make no comment, and I express
  no opinion. Thus, it seems to me, can I most fitly discharge my literary
  executorship.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-15"
     id="ch-15"></a>15.&mdash;THEIR PRISON HOUSE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The English Illustrated Magazine</i>, May 1899</h3>

  <p class="first">He was pale-faced, round-shouldered, and anaemic, a creature
  obviously deficient in vitality, with the hall-mark of servitude stamped very
  dearly upon his commonplace features, and the patience of Job shining in his
  hollow-set brown eyes. In every respect he was entirely out of touch with his
  environment; one could only wonder what had brought him so far from his
  accustomed haunts. His shabby yet respectable black clothes, his well-frayed
  linen, and the ink-stains still lingering upon his finger-nails&mdash;these
  things bespoke his occupation as plainly as though he had stood there among
  the bracken with a ledger under his arm and a pen behind his ear.</p>

  <p>For by some strange chance he had wandered far from the city, and found
  his way into a very world of sunshine; over his head it came streaming
  through the delicate interlacings of those gently waving green
  elm-leaves&mdash;a rich golden flood, warm, yet very soft and sweet, there in
  the deep shade. He had thrown himself, after a moment's silent absorption,
  upon a grassy bank; his limbs stretched out over the mossy earth, his
  recumbent form the very personification of absolute yet awkward ease. His
  eyes began slowly to blink and then to close: the murmurous drone of bees at
  work and the pleasant heat had made him sleepy. It was really the country
  into which he had roamed; there were birds and insects everywhere, as well as
  wild flowers and sunshine: the perfume-laden air was all alive with them. Just
  now a bumble-bee had balanced himself upon that stiff blade of grass
  yonder&mdash;hear him now, buzzing away in the bracken behind; what a lazy,
  sense-lulling noise! A brown tortoiseshell butterfly came floating in from
  the flower-lined hedgerow alongside the cornfield, and a beetle whose curved
  shell-like back was as black as night crept out from behind that piece of
  grey boulder where the honeysuckle hung down in long odoriferous wreaths. To
  one born in the country these are all common things enough, but to him, a
  city clerk, a counting-house machine whose life had been spent upon an
  office-stool, and whose walks were ever upon the stone pavements of a
  Babylonic wilderness&mdash;to him they were all new and full of wonder.</p>

  <p>It was many a year since he had seen an uncaged singing bird so close as
  the bright-eyed linnet who had perched himself only a few yards away upon
  that slender hawthorn twig, calling with shrill, sweet notes to his mate,
  whose far-off chirping sounded like a weaker echo of his own more musical
  note. And what air&mdash;how bright and pure, how smokeless! Was the sky ever
  really so blue as that over Tooley Street, he wondered? Surely not! And those
  little fleecy, white clouds&mdash;surely they never floated like that over
  Bermondsey! Listen! There in his ears, like the soft music of the sea, came
  the gentle rushing of a summer breeze, rustling amongst the bending corn,
  whose tops were full even to bursting. His eyes closed of their own accord,
  he could not keep them open any longer; a sort of Nirvana of dreamless repose
  crept over his brain, a day-sleep from which he was suddenly awakened by the
  sharp snapping of a twig close at hand. He sat up, vaguely alarmed! Yonder,
  in the lowest fork of that elm-tree, sat the wanton disturber of his
  drowsiness. It was&mdash;yes, he decided that it must be, a squirrel! He had
  never seen one before, but it could be nothing else. What bright little black
  eyes, and what a tail! Off he scampered up into the deeper recesses of the
  thick-leaved hazel-bush beyond. The man regretted his disappearance, and
  sighed.</p>

    <p class="caption">He sat up vaguely alarmed! Yonder, in the lowest fork
    of<br>
    that elm-tree, sat the wanton disturber of his drowsiness.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He was awake now and beginning to fell lonely. He drew out his watch, a
  time-worn Waterbury, with a little black cord attached, and he sighed. Surely
  she would not be long now! He was impatient to think that she should be
  losing, for his sake, one moment of this wonderful morning. Cooking! He was
  quite content to live without it for these few halcyon days; they would so
  soon be over, and then&mdash;God only knew when they would come again! For
  the door of his prison-house had been opened quite by chance; it was surely
  nothing but a whim of Mr. Rupert's to lend his uncle's clerk this little
  Surrey cottage and to insist upon a week's holiday for him! Good-natured! Of
  course it was good-natured; but, all the same, it was a whim. The man fell to
  wondering&mdash;wondering whence had come to him this unexpected kindness.
  For years Mr. Rupert, junior partner in the "firm," had barely answered his
  respectful "Good-morning." What had made him carelessly and without
  explanation offer this strange kindness? The man's brain had grown misty
  through many years of mechanical work. There was something there&mdash;a
  thought without substance, or was it a fear? He pressed his hand to his
  forehead and sighed.</p>

  <p>He stood up to look for her, drawing in, as he clambered a few yards
  higher up the hillside, a long breath of that most delicate of
  perfumes&mdash;the scent of sun-warmed heather, carried on the bosom of a
  south wind. Yonder, through the trees, he could see purple streaks of it upon
  the downs, and here and there clumps of yellow gorse, stretching right to the
  borders of that dark belt of pine woods; it was all very beautiful.</p>

  <p>Would she come soon, he wondered? He wanted her to see the squirrel, and
  to listen with him to that low music from the cornfield. He knew how she
  loved all these strange country sounds and sights, and he grudged every
  moment that she was not there with him enjoying them. What could she be
  doing, he wondered, to keep her so long? He sighed as he remembered what a
  conscientious pleasure she seemed to take in keeping that strange little
  thatched cottage, with its red tiles and queer diamond-framed windows, as
  clean and trim as she somehow managed to keep their six-roomed "villa" in
  Bermondsey! Only here there was something to reward her for her
  pains&mdash;their own little home, alas! at its best was miserably,
  depressingly ugly. A wave of bitterness rose up from the bottom of the man's
  heart; this touch of nature had done him the unkindness of loosening for a
  moment the bonds of his shackledom. The scales dropped from his eyes; he
  stood face to face with his misery, and thought of their home, his and hers.
  It was in a hot, dirty back street, dose to the river, and opposite a piece
  of waste ground, where squalid children made a weary pretence at play, and
  where the filth and rubbish of generations seemed to have accumulated.
  Twenty-nine shillings a week will not go very far in London&mdash;and then
  there were debts to pay off. Never mind how they had come by them; they were
  honourable debts. If it had been only himself&mdash;well, he could have borne
  all this and more; for nature had given to him some touch of that marvellous
  unselfishness which sends many a man tottering through the world with a
  patience almost Christlike, and the burdens of other men heaped upon his
  bowed shoulders. But there was Edith! She had been used to different things.
  God had never meant her for a drudge! She read poetry&mdash;how he wished
  that he could understand it!&mdash;and she loved pretty things. Ah, if only
  he could get them for her! Sometimes he had seen her stand at the window of
  their little front room, and shiver from head to foot as she looked out
  across the filthy street to the desolation beyond. He wondered&mdash;what a
  black, chill thought!&mdash;had he sinned in marrying her? Had she
  understood how miserable a creature a city clerk is, and always must be, how
  hopeless his limitations, how slowly, shilling by shilling, his wages creep
  up, as his hair grows greyer and his figure more bent? If God had only given
  him muscle instead of those wretched smatterings of brain power! He saw
  himself suddenly as he was, saw whither he was drifting&mdash;the decadence
  of his faint shadow of manhood, the closing in of the iron walls! There was a
  sob in his throat; it was a moment of rare revolt. God! what chance had he!
  The same little cycle of work day by day, the same walk to the office, the
  same walk back! The daily pitiful struggle for respectability with his rusty
  black clothes, patched and mended, and his hat ironed almost bare of all nap.
  Every day had been hammered into almost the exact similitude of the day that
  preceded and the day that followed it. Life and hope must narrow continually;
  it is habit which crushes. Did she understand these things, he wondered? God
  only knew! He wished pitifully that she would come; the music in the
  cornfields was growing fainter, and the squirrel had vanished from sight.</p>

  <p>At last! He could see her white gown on the other side of the hedge. There
  was some one with her, a gentleman. It was Mr. Rupert! What was he doing away
  from his house full of guests, and&mdash;he was actually carrying their
  lunch, neatly done up in a brown paper parcel! The man rubbed his
  eyes&mdash;yes! it was quite true&mdash;he was not dreaming! How earnestly
  they were talking, too! Now he had taken her book&mdash;it was a volume of
  poetry, and he was marking something in it with a pencil. The man took an
  uneasy step forward&mdash;should he go and meet them? No. He would stay where
  he was; he would be ill at ease with Mr. Rupert. They came nearer; she seemed
  to be quoting from the book in her hand, and he was silent. They reached the
  gate; again the man moved, then hesitated: he would not go, he would wait!
  They were talking as equals; it would be hateful to have to call Mr. Rupert
  "Sir" before her. They lingered there for a moment; he was leaning against
  the gate looking at her. How beautiful she was! He began to speak&mdash;how
  plainly the words travelled through that still air!</p>

  <p>"I wonder, Mrs. Spearmain, if I might venture to make a very daring
  personal remark; it is half a question, too. Perhaps I should call it an
  enigma."</p>

  <p>"I think that you had better not!"</p>

  <p>The man scarcely recognized the woman's voice: it sounded to him strained,
  suppressed, unnatural! Her eyes seemed to be avoiding her companion's; she
  was looking steadfastly across the cornfields.</p>

  <p>What did she see upon the hills yonder? Perhaps she, too, was listening to
  that faint, sweet music.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless I must," he persisted quietly; "and I rely upon you for a
  faithful answer. Why did you marry David Spearmain?"</p>

  <p>The summer heat had gone; the man who listened was suddenly cold! His
  brain was in a whirl; he wanted to cry out, but there was a weight upon his
  lips. He was forced to listen!</p>

  <p>The woman faced her questioner; her head was thrown proudly back, but her
  lips were quivering, and she was very pale.</p>

  <p>"That is a question which you should not have asked," she said coldly. "It
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No business of mine, you would say," he interrupted impatiently. "Quite
  true Yet answer me."</p>

  <p>"I will not!" she murmured passionately.</p>

  <p>He smiled down at her with a slow, curious smile.</p>

  <p>"Then I am answered," he said. "I am content!"</p>

  <p>She turned upon him, and to the man who listened her finger-nails appeared
  to be buried in the wood of the gate!</p>

  <p>"I was penniless, alone, wretched! He nursed my father, he was good to me,
  he is always good to me! I&mdash;I love him!"</p>

  <p>It seemed strange to him, a pale, scared figure standing like a ghost in
  the shadow of the elm-tree, that the sun was shining still so brightly. There
  was a cold weight upon his heart, a mist before his eyes; her voice had
  faltered in the middle of that last sentence!</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," her companion said softly, "but it is not possible; you and
  he are of different worlds. He is a complete human automaton&mdash;a mere
  machine; he has neither ambition nor imagination&mdash;he has not the
  capacity for either. You have them both! You have education and sensibility;
  you were never meant for such a life with such a man! It is sapping your days
  away; in the end it would drive you mad&mdash;but the end will not come."</p>

  <p>The rich, warm colour had flooded her cheeks; she drew a step farther away
  from him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"I mean that you will leave him," he answered slowly. "It is inevitable;
  you cannot help it; you owe it to yourself. Nature never meant you to be a
  drudge!"</p>

  <p>"There are worse things," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Then he stooped down and whispered something in her ear, bending eagerly
  towards her, and with a sudden fire in his eyes.</p>

    <p class="caption">She left him without a word. He stood there, vexed and
    irresolute.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She left him at once without a word; he remained there, vexed and
  irresolute. Her movement had been so quick and determined that he had been
  powerless to detain her. The man saw her coming towards him, and though her
  face was as pale as the white poppy which he had plucked a few moments
  before, there was a spot of colour burning in her cheeks and a strained look
  under her eyes. He stole farther away, back into the little tangled wood, and
  threw himself upon the ground with a faint moan. Where he was now, the sound
  of the wind rustling amid the corn-tops came muffled and vague, and the
  sunlight was not. The linnet's song had ceased, and there was a deeper chill
  in the air than befitted a summer day. When she found him it seemed as though
  he had been asleep.</p>

  <p>She was silent; so was he. Was it his fancy, or was she really kinder,
  more tender than usual? lie tried to talk to her, but there was a seal upon
  his lips; he wanted to tell her of the squirrel, to take her down to the
  hedgerow and bid her listen to that sweet, sad music among the breeze-swept
  corn, to show her the linnet's nest, and to give her the honeysuckle he had
  plucked from the flower-wreathed hedge. But he could do none of these things,
  for he was stricken with a sudden dumbness, and there was a strange aching in
  his heart. There were things dawning upon him which he had never understood!
  Was that indeed his death sentence which he had heard pronounced? Presently
  she said something to him; she was looking away through the trees, and her
  tone was dull and unemotional.</p>

  <p>"David," she said, "would you mind very much if I asked you to do
  something which will seem very odd to you?"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want to go back! I do not want to stay here any longer."</p>

  <p>"We will go to-night," he answered quietly. "There is a train at six
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in quick wonderment; she had expected incredulity,
  questions&mdash;he asked her none, he was content to go! All these beautiful
  sounds and sights, then, had failed to penetrate for one moment the hard husk
  of his materialism. Perhaps even he was pining for his worm-eaten desk and
  his musty ledger. Was it her fault that a shade of contempt passed across her
  face&mdash;that her own sense of despair grew deeper? But the man saw it, and
  his heart was near breaking.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Bermondsey was very hot, and there was a fetid smell from the piled-up
  nastiness of that wretched plot of waste ground. He went back to his desk,
  back to the endless grapplings with endless columns of figures, back to his
  part in the building up of other men's fortunes. Day by day he left home at
  half-past eight to the moment, turned the same corners and crossed the same
  streets, looking even into the faces of the same crowd of hurrying
  fellow-creatures. His coat was a little more rusty, and the nap of his hat
  had quite gone now. Sometimes he fancied that there were more grey hairs too;
  only yesterday one of his fellow-slaves had alluded to a stoop which had
  lately bent his shoulders. He was still a reliable machine; he made no
  mistakes, and his work was as neat as ever. Only sometimes in the dinner-hour
  (he was permitted the privilege of eating his sandwich upon the
  counting-house stool) or in the dead of night, when the woman by his side
  slept, he allowed himself the strange luxury of thought. He looked out into
  the vague shadows of their bare little bed-chamber, and he fancied that he
  could hear the low rustling of a summer wind in the elm-tree tops, and feel
  the sun warming his bones and brightening up the whole sad world. He heard
  the chirping of linnets, the clear song of a distant lark, and the deep, low
  humming of a whole world of insects, making strange minor music in the sunlit
  air. The squirrel came out from his leafy chamber and talked to him like an
  old friend; a black-headed chaffinch sat on a hawthorn twig and sang him a
  little song: Then a city clock, loud-tongued and brazen, chimed the hour, and
  his fanciful world faded away before that grim note of reality. He fell back
  upon the pillow, with lips tightly pressed together, lest that smothered
  groan might wake the girl who slept so calmly by his side.</p>

  <p>But for him there was no sleep; in those long watches of the night he
  sometimes forgot that he was only a machine, his heart swelled, his eyes were
  dim, and he knew the full measure of his slavery. Why did she marry such a
  creature? Did she see his destiny, he wondered, written so pitilessly upon
  his plain, emotionless face, branded upon his speech, the hall-mark of his
  ignorance?</p>

  <p>But when the daylight came he was himself again. With white face and
  leaden eyes he prepared for his daily slavery in the same slow, mechanical
  fashion. He made the usual remarks&mdash;he kept a little stock of
  them&mdash;and she answered him in the same spirit. But it was seldom that
  their eyes met, for the shadow was always there. She, too, he thought, seemed
  to be growing thinner; she read less poetry, she was always looking out with
  dull eyes upon a hopeless future; yet she was struggling bravely to do her
  duty. Every day there was a faint, wan smile, the usual inquiry as to the
  day's work, the weather, some other trifling word obviously prepared
  beforehand; and he answered her with rigid calm as he hung up his coat after
  carefully removing the dust from it and exchanging it for a still shabbier
  garment. Sometimes they took a weary little walk, mostly on Sundays, along an
  endless succession of ugly streets, bounded by squalid houses or dreary
  shuttered shops. There was no escape from their immediate environment, for he
  had no money for 'buses, and she was not strong enough to walk far. The
  pavements burned their feet, and their eyes were sore at the wilderness of
  bricks and mortar, the throngs of hideously dressed, ill-mannered neighbours,
  the utter absence of all things beautiful. The whole panorama was a nightmare
  to them. They were deep down in the hell of the poverty-stricken, and
  together&mdash;the man thought sometimes in those long watches of the
  night&mdash;together they could never escape from it. He had no increase of
  salary to hope for; if he had dared to ask for it, there were hundreds
  clamouring for his bread. He would be lucky, as old age came on, if he could
  keep his place. For him there was no climbing out&mdash;no escape. But for
  her! How long would she suffer it? God only knew! Sometimes he thought that
  he must cry out and ask her, but the shadow was there, and he dared not. They
  were walking together within its dark folds, and his tongue was palsied.</p>

  <p>Now and then, very seldom, for he was a great sportsman, Rupert Denning
  came to the office. He passed the white stooping figure, who never looked up
  at his entrance, with a greeting half-contemptuous, hall-pitying! Once,
  however, he called him into his private office. It was a day when the man was
  feeling worse even than usual. All night long he had lain awake, and this
  morning there was a livid shade in his face, and his eyes were leaden. His
  collar was more badly frayed than ever, and his shirt&mdash;he was bound to
  make it last three days&mdash;was very soiled. With his block in his hand, he
  took down rapidly, and without error, a letter from the young man's
  dictation. In the midst of it there came a pause. After a while he raised his
  eyes. Mr. Rupert was doing him the honour to observe him closely; his lips
  were slightly curled, his eyes spoke of that pity which is much akin to
  contempt. The clerk knew well of what his master was thinking: he was
  wondering what magic he, the poor machine, had used to win a lady for his
  wife. Ah I well, it was simple magic after all. He had nursed her dying
  father; night after night they two had sat with him alone, watching and
  tending him through an illness from the fear of which all the neighbours had
  fled away in horror. His savings for five years had gone to bury that poor
  old man&mdash;a stranger, a fellow-lodger by chance. And there were other
  matters, but they were not important. Rupert Denning knew of none of these
  things, and he might well wonder. The eyes of the two men met across the
  table. He was a man of the modern world, devoted to the acquisition of new
  sensations, absolutely without self-consciousness. The light in a poor
  clerk's eyes had no meaning for him; yet he was dimly made to feel the
  presence of something almost resembling dignity in that motionless, shadowy
  figure, waiting so patiently at his elbow. He coughed, and finished the
  dictation of his letter.</p>

  <p>That night the man walked home a little more slowly than usual. There was
  a burning pain in his head, and strange lights before his eyes. He said
  nothing to the woman, and they went to their room at the customary hour. But
  while she slept a strange thing came to him. He raised himself in the bed.
  Ah, what a change! It was true, then! He listened. Yes, the sea-music was
  awake in the cornfield, and the whole world outside the wood where he was
  lying was flooded with the golden sunlight! He laughed softly to himself with
  joy. See, there was a shaft of it, right at his feet, across the brown
  ant-heap and that little clump of purple foxglove! How the bees were working
  round the honeysuckle: the air was quivering with the buzz of their wings! He
  was watching a beetle now; he was a dull, unlovely insect enough, but he was
  creeping towards that line of sunlight. Now he had reached it. What a mighty
  change! How his wings gleamed! They were like burnished copper; he had
  suddenly become a beautiful thing! And here came his friend the squirrel! He
  had found some nuts in a hazel-bush yonder; but why, the man wondered,
  holding his burning head and staring steadily in front of him, was he sitting
  at the foot of the bed? and why did he look so solemn? What was that through
  the trees? The gleam of a white dress&mdash;two figures He listened to their
  voices! What was he asking her?</p>

  <p>"Why did you marry him?"</p>

  <p>The man moaned; there was a pain at his heart. He was on fire! What was he
  doing? He would wake Edith; he could not help it, the laughter would come! He
  waved his arms. Noble little linnet, sing away, sing away! If only he could
  catch that squirrel, Edith would like it so! She was out of bed now. She was
  trying to make him lie down; it was too bad, but he could not help laughing;
  how his sides ached! Her face was as white as death; she was frightened. What
  was she saying at the gate? A machine&mdash;a mere machine&mdash;that is what
  he was! Never mind, the fires were in his brain. He was free, free!</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Once more their voices. The man was too weak to move. He lay still and
  looked out into the room; Rupert Denning was standing in the doorway with a
  great basket of flowers and a box under his arm. She had risen and was
  looking at him with a question in her face. The man heard his soft, pleasant
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I do hope that you will not consider me an intruder, Mrs. Spearmain," he
  said. "We are all so glad to hear that the doctor gives you some hope after
  all. May I come in for a moment?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer him at once, but he came in and closed the door after
  him.</p>

  <p>"You are quite worn out," he continued, looking at her tenderly. "It is
  really too bad of you! I insist that you let me send you a nurse; it will be
  a pleasure to me to be allowed to serve you in any way."</p>

  <p>The woman rose up and spoke.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Mr. Denning, but no one else shall nurse my husband."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It must be as you will, of course! At least you will accept some flowers
  from me, and these grapes."</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged," she answered, "but I already have all the
  flowers the doctor will permit in the room, and plenty of fruit."</p>

  <p>"The sick man slowly turned his eyes. The table by his side was smothered
  with beautiful roses; one great red blossom had become detached and was lying
  upon his pillow. There was a bowl, too, full of such grapes as he had never
  seen before. He was bewildered; where did they come from if not from him? He,
  too, had seen them with surprise.</p>

  <p>"You are very hard upon me," he said slowly. "Why do you keep up such a
  farce? I only desire your happiness. To give you pleasure, to atone for some
  of your past misery is my greatest ambition."</p>

  <p>The man closed his eyes; the smothered groan which escaped from his lips
  was too faint a sound for them to hear.</p>

  <p>"The only possible manner," the woman said, "in which you can further my
  happiness is to never let me see your face again. But before you go, listen!
  If he had died, you and your partner would have been his murderers. There are
  things in this world which I do not understand. People seem to accept them
  calmly, so I suppose they are what is called inevitable. But in God's world
  they will be righted somehow! You see what you have made of him! He is a
  human being, a better man than you, and he has as much right to live. You
  reap wealth from his labours and the labour of his fellows, and you keep
  him&mdash;like that&mdash;half-starved. While you are making a fortune you
  raise his salary grudgingly, shilling by shilling. You broke him upon the
  wheel! Oh, it is abominable!"</p>

  <p>He listened to her quite unmoved.</p>

  <p>"He had as much as he was worth; there are thousands who would have taken
  his place."</p>

  <p>"Some day," she answered scornfully, "those thousands may be your judges!
  What is wrong I do not know. I have not thought of these things before, and I
  am an ignorant woman. But if there is a God of justice, there will be a
  balance struck some day between you and them."</p>

  <p>"Edith!"</p>

  <p>She stopped him passionately.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't dare to call me by that name! Once for five minutes I let you
  talk to me foolishly. God knows I meant no harm! If he had died, I should
  have felt a murderess, for he overheard, and he said nothing. It is that and
  the misery of our life here which drove him mad. I have wronged him every
  moment. When I thought that he was content, and despised him for it, he was
  suffering cruelly. You gave him&mdash;what was it?&mdash;twenty-nine
  shillings a week? He let me think it was more; he starved himself day by day
  for my sake. Oh! he has been a hero, and I thank God that he will never
  darken your doors again."</p>

  <p>He laughed unpleasantly as he prepared to go. "No one else will want
  him!"</p>

  <p>The woman lifted up her head proudly.</p>

  <p>"I shall want him. I could cry with joy when I think that at last I can
  repay a little devotion which rich men such as you could never understand. I
  have been left money&mdash;not a fortune, but enough to keep us, wherever we
  choose to live."</p>

  <p>He looked at her thoughtfully. She was thin and haggard, but she was
  wonderfully beautiful.</p>

  <p>"You are romantic," he said, "but you cannot make him anything save what
  he is; you can never be happy with him."</p>

  <p>Then the man who lay upon the bed saw that she was trembling from head to
  foot with passion. Her cheeks were scarlet and her eyes flashed fire.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you poor fool!" she cried, "haven't you the wit to see that I love
  him&mdash;that I have loved him all the time! Now go!"</p>

  <p>And with that he went; and the woman, coming softly to the bedside, found
  the man's eyes open, and knew that he had been spared to her. She fell on her
  knees, and his thin wasted arms drew her face down to his; and in that moment
  the doors of their prison-house stood open.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-16"
     id="ch-16"></a>16.&mdash;A VOICE FROM THE HIDDEN WORLD</h2>

  <p class="first">I should like it to be distinctly understood at the outset
  of this brief narrative that I am not a disciple of any of the so-called
  apostles of modern psychology. I am going to tell a plain story in plain
  words, and leave any possible explanation of it to those who are interested
  in the great unknown science. There are men and women to-day rising up
  amongst us like prophets, and pointing upwards through the mists of an
  untrodden land to a light beyond the shadowy boundary dividing things
  material from things spiritual. Whether they be false prophets or true,
  another generation will determine. Only this much is certain, that the light
  they offer fails to pierce the curtain of darkness which hangs before our
  eyes, and that the truths which should become as manifest to us as floating
  dust in the dear sunlight are represented only by thin theories and
  hysterical but ineffective single assertions. The black clouds are nowhere
  pierced by the lightning of truth. All is still chaos, mysterious and
  impenetrable. It may well be true that there exist more things in this world
  than are dreamed of in our philosophy, but this much is also true&mdash;no
  voice has yet been lifted which can read the riddles of the new science, no
  hand has yet shown itself able to lift the veil between this and another
  world. Nor has any light yet been kindled in whose illumination those vast
  secrets are laid bare. Nothing is more certain and obvious than our profound
  ignorance concerning it. We are like blind men groping in the dark. In all
  probability we shall die as we have lived, without a gleam of absolute
  knowledge, looking out upon life with half-shut eyes. Yet the wisest of us
  are those who hold their peace and wait.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Twenty-four years ago I bought my first practice and furnished my first
  house. It was not a choice neighbourhood, nor was the practice itself either
  extensive or select; but in the ardour of youth I scarcely considered those
  drawbacks worth considering. At twenty-five years old one scarcely expects to
  start fife&mdash;in the professions, at any rate&mdash;in a very large way,
  and I was perfectly satisfied. The shining brass plate outside my door, on
  which was inscribed:</p>

  <p class="sign">C. H. FAGGETT, M.D.,</p>

  <p>compensated fully&mdash;to me, at any rate&mdash;for the shabbiness of my
  abode. I had fifty pounds a year of my own. I was unmarried, and had quite as
  much self confidence as was good for me, notwithstanding that the outlook
  demanded no ordinary share.</p>

  <p>My patients were six in number, excluding my own family. I say excluding
  my own family, because from the time of my setting up for myself there was
  not one of them, from my youngest sister, aged six, to my father, who did not
  immediately develop some extraordinary and utterly unheard-of ailment, and
  persist in being treated for the same with due gravity. My father, who was
  one of the healthiest men living, began to complain from loss of appetite and
  dejection of spirits, and was unhappy until I had prescribed and administered
  a tonic; my mother, who scarcely knew what a cold was, began to talk gravely
  about her chest, and insisted upon a cough medicine; whilst Ada, my little
  sister, complained continually, but vaguely, of "bad feelings all over her
  body," and swallowed all the harmless physic I could bring her with absolute
  relish. "Rover," the family dog, was the most ungrateful of the household,
  for, after hearing one night a long account of his various and alarming
  ailments, I was induced at last to prepare for him a strong dose of castor
  oil, an attention for which he showed the most gross ingratitude, ever
  afterwards rising hurriedly at my entry into the room, and retiring under the
  table with an ominous growl and a sidelong glance, half threatening, half
  apprehensive.</p>

  <p>To return to my patients proper. Five of them were totally uninteresting
  to me save as "cases;" the sixth was too poor to pay even my modest bill with
  anything like reasonable punctuality, yet she was the one whom I would have
  relinquished the least readily. I remember the first time she came for me,
  and how pitifully she stated her case.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what is the matter with me, doctor. Perhaps you can tell. I
  have no pain&mdash;at least, no acute pain&mdash;to speak of; only sometimes
  I seem to ache all over, and I am growing thin&mdash;thinner every day. I get
  plenty to eat&mdash;quite plenty," she repeated, keeping her eyes anxiously
  fixed upon my face.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid the food you take is scarcely nourishing enough," I said. "Do
  you mind telling me how old you are?"</p>

  <p>"No. I am twenty-two."</p>

  <p>Twenty-two! It seemed barely credible. I was young at my profession, and
  compassion was still easy. I looked at the high cheek-bones and sunken,
  dark-rimmed eyes, bright now with anxiety, at the long, wasted fingers and
  the simple black dress, hanging loosely around her shrunken figure, and I
  sighed. She seemed to read my look, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do look rather bad," she said nervously. "Can't you do
  anything for me, doctor? I'm very poor; but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't do much," I interrupted; "but I can tell you what is the matter.
  You have some trouble which you are allowing to prey upon your mind, and you
  are starving. I am afraid that sounds a little blunt; but it's the
  truth."</p>

  <p>She looked frightened, almost horrified.</p>

  <p>"Starving! Oh, no, no, doctor; indeed, I am not that. I spend every penny
  that I can upon food. I must save a little for&mdash;never mind what
  for&mdash;but I must save a little."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I cannot help you further, then," I said, rising. "I have told
  you what is the matter with you. No medicine could do any good. Of course, I
  don't know what the saving you mention is for; but you must remember that you
  are paying for it with your life. It is my duty as a doctor, you know, to
  speak plainly. You ask me what is the matter with you, and I tell
  you&mdash;starvation!"</p>

  <p>She turned away and looked wearily out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, doctor," she said, as I turned to go. "May I ask you one more
  question?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Is it that which is making me so worn and pinched-looking? I feel like an
  old woman when I look in the glass."</p>

  <p>"It has its effect upon your appearance, of course," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Will they&mdash;come back again&mdash;I mean, my looks?" she asked
  wistfully, with a little tremble in her voice and her eyes very earnestly
  fixed upon me. "I used to be better-looking once, and I shouldn't like
  him&mdash;my friends, I mean&mdash;to see me like this when he&mdash;when
  they come. I will try and eat a little more. Will that help, do you think?"
  she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That would make all the difference," I assured her; "commence at once.
  Have a good meal this evening, and you'll feel all the better for it."</p>

  <p>"Very well; I will, then. And&mdash;and, doctor, how much?" she commenced
  wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Nothing until I have to give you medicine," I interrupted shortly. "I'll
  send my bill in then, fast enough. Good-day."</p>

  <p>My patient&mdash;Miss Desmond, she called herself&mdash;took my advice,
  and in a few weeks there was a marked change in her. I was scarcely prepared,
  however, for the transformation which I witnessed on my last professional
  visit.</p>

  <p>It was Christmas morning, and I was just starting westwards to spend a day
  with my people. On the doorstep I encountered a messenger from her. She was
  quite well, but she wished to see me, if I could spare the time to go round.
  I went at once.</p>

  <p>My first impression on entering the room was that I was in the presence of
  a stranger, and as that vanished, I found myself marvelling at the
  metamorphosis. The ragged black gown, the wan cheeks and dull eyes, were
  things of the past. I found myself greeted by a tall, graceful woman, clad in
  a simple but elegant gown of soft pink and black. A most becoming glow had
  dyed her pallid cheeks, and her eyes were sparkling with pleasurable
  excitement. She looked at me with slightly parted, tremulous lips, as though
  anxious to see whether I noted the change. At my look of surprise her
  features relaxed into a half-deprecating, half-pleased smile.</p>

  <p>"You see a difference doctor?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed, Miss Desmond," I answered warmly. "Let me offer you my
  sincere congratulations. Is it out of compliment to the season, may I
  ask?"</p>

  <p>"Partly; and partly for another reason. I am expecting a visitor."</p>

  <p>Her tone was hesitating, almost shy. Yet in a certain way it seemed as
  though she desired to make a confidant of me. I pulled a chair up to the fire
  and waited.</p>

  <p>"Doctor!</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Desmond."</p>

  <p>"You don't think my gown is too thin, do you? The room is quite warm."</p>

  <p>I leaned over and felt her arms; but the wistful look with which she was
  watching me checked the remonstrance which had been upon my lips.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. You must be careful to keep out of draughts, though."</p>

  <p>"I will, I will, indeed. And, doctor."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, and the colour came and went quickly in her delicate
  cheeks. There was no doubt about it, she was a perfectly beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that it is a pretty gown? It is a little old, I know," she
  went on hurriedly, "but it is nicely made, and the colours used to suit me. I
  was different then, though," she added with a sigh.</p>

  <p>I was scarcely more than a boy, and a most unprofessional lump had risen
  in my throat. To me there was something very pathetic about that dress and
  the other little attempts at decoration about the room. I knew too well the
  meaning of that exquisite colour and the unreal beauty of her face.</p>

  <p>Loath though I was to admit it to myself, they were too ethereal for
  health. It was like the strange, star-like beauty of some tropical plant,
  which blossoms into perfection and fades in a single day. My heart was sad,
  and though I answered her cheerfully, I kept my face turned away.</p>

  <p>"You look charming, Miss Desmond. Let me wish you a very happy Christmas,
  and no end of good fortune in the next year."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, doctor. Do you know, I believe that your wish will come true.
  I am expecting a visitor."</p>

  <p>Visitor! It was odd how interested I felt. I sat up in my chair and looked
  at her inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Some of your relations, I presume? I am glad."</p>

  <p>She was a full minute before she answered me. During that time I could
  hear my heart beat, and I crushed a fallen cinder under my boot into
  powder.</p>

  <p>"No; it is only&mdash;a friend."</p>

  <p>"A man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She was too absorbed to notice or resent the impertinence of the question.
  There was a shy, soft look in her downcast eyes and a happy smile parting her
  lips.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts were far away, and I was forgotten. As for me, the light
  seemed to have died out of the bright winter's day. The cheerful, blazing
  fire had dwindled down into a handful of white ashes. I felt chilled and
  heartsick. I could not understand what had happened; and I know that I had a
  longing to get away into my room and lock the door upon my misery. Yet I must
  be quite certain.</p>

  <p>"Is he a very dear friend?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Very, very dear."</p>

  <p>"Why has he not come to see you before?"</p>

  <p>"He has been away; he has known nothing. I have been content to wait for
  his return. He will come to me now."</p>

  <p>The dreamy, far-away look maddened me. It was strange that she did not
  notice the sharpness of my tone.</p>

  <p>"Is that why you are wearing that dress?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; it was his favourite. He used to think that I looked better in it
  than anything."</p>

  <p>She was actually blushing now. I looked away quickly, with something like
  a groan almost escaping me.</p>

  <p>"So you have been keeping it for him. You would not let any one else see
  you in it, even."</p>

  <p>Her expression changed swiftly. I had touched a painful chord. How I hated
  myself for it!</p>

  <p>"It was not that," she said in a low voice; "I had not got it. I was very
  poor, and I had to&mdash;to part with it for a time. But I used to lay by a
  little every week, and yesterday I was able to bring it away. Oh, how
  thankful I was! All the others have gone, but it would have broken my heart
  to have parted with this one. He liked it so much."</p>

  <p>A great wave of pity rose up in my heart, and swept away every meaner
  feeling before it. I bent forward with my eyes fixed upon the fire, and all
  that I could so well imagine seemed to rise up before me in a sort of
  dream-picture. I saw the stooping figure of that lonely woman, working night
  and day in a cheerless solitude, starving herself of food and warmth, wearing
  her fingers to the bone, scraping every farthing together that she might
  redeem from the pawnshop the gown so precious to her through his preference.
  I could see her late at night, wearied out and with aching eyes, pushing her
  work away, and indulging for a few brief moments in one of those day-dreams
  so precious to her. A faint colour steals into her ashen cheeks, and her eyes
  are of a sudden wonderfully soft. The thin hands rest peacefully in her lap,
  and her poor, tremulous heart is once more beating with renewed strength. She
  is thinking of the time when he will come. She can see him standing there;
  almost she can feel his strong arms around her wasted form. How eagerly she
  watches to see whether he will notice his favourite dress; her hair arranged
  with shaking fingers as he had liked it; and how anxiously she seeks to read
  his thoughts in his expression! Does he think her so much changed? Will that
  old fondness survive her hollow cheeks and shrunken face? Is the old love as
  faithful and strong as ever? Ah, how sweet those dreams! How sad and cold the
  awakening!</p>

  <p>And my awakening, too, came just then; for I felt a light touch on the
  arm, and, starting up, found Miss Desmond by my side. Her eyes were very
  bright, and she seemed to be listening for a sound outside.</p>

  <p>"Doctor, forgive me for interrupting your daydream," she said nervously;
  "for I fancied that I heard a cab stop in the street, and you know that I am
  expecting a visitor. Would you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I rose quickly, and turned towards the door. "I beg your pardon, I'm sure,
  Miss Desmond," I said. "My next case is a very interesting one, and in
  thinking out some of the symptoms I lost myself for a moment. Once more, a
  happy Christmas!"</p>

  <p>She looked perfectly beautiful as she laughed and nodded to me with the
  strange new colour in her cheeks and her whole manner and bearing full of a
  new-born animation. She might have posed for a statue of "hope "&mdash;not
  that strong, calm hope which is but a misnomer for faith, but hope tempered
  by uncertainty, nervous and fearful through the very greatness of the issue,
  yet with all a woman's sweet trust in the man she loves, leaning towards the
  belief that this meeting, to which she was looking forward with so much
  yearning tenderness, would end as she would wish. So I saw her, and saw her
  for the last time. When next I looked into her face she was a dead woman. I
  met no one on the stairs after leaving Miss Desmond; and instead of spending
  the day as I had planned, I went straight back to my apartments. At one
  o'clock I had some lunch&mdash;or rather some was placed before me, for I had
  no appetite and scarcely touched anything The afternoon I spent quite alone
  in my study. It must have been about twenty minutes to five before I was
  disturbed by a violent ringing of the surgery bell, and almost immediately
  afterwards my housekeeper knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman wishes to see you immediately, sir," she announced.</p>

  <p>"Show him in," I directed.</p>

  <p>He had evidently followed close behind her, for before she could turn
  round he had walked into the room. I turned up the lamp, and rose from my
  chair.</p>

  <p>Every minute detail of his appearance comes back to me even now, after so
  many years, as clearly as though it were but yesterday. His was not a face to
  be easily forgotten. I suppose it would not strictly have been called a
  handsome one, but it was, at any rate, both striking and powerful; and his
  carriage, even in his great haste, was dignified and easy. I listened to hear
  his errand with the feeling that I was in the presence of no ordinary man,
  and with a curiosity which I seldom felt in the presence of any of my
  patients.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Faggett?" he inquired quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I have just left a lady whom you have been attending&mdash;Miss Desmond.
  She is ill. Will you come to her?"</p>

  <p>The pipe which I had been holding between my fingers slipped to the
  ground, and I drew a quick breath between my teeth. This, then, was Miss
  Desmond's visitor, this was the man whom she had been expecting so eagerly;
  and he had left her ill, he had left her at the very moment when she must
  have most needed his support, on an errand which any other messenger could
  have accomplished. I stooped down and turned up the lamp with a fierce, angry
  swelling at my heart, but when I bent forward to look into his face he
  stepped quickly back into the shadows with an impatient exclamation. His
  purpose was manifest&mdash;he wished to conceal his features from me as far
  as possible.</p>

  <p>"I ask you again whether you will come to her, Dr. Faggett?" he said
  abruptly. "I left her in a faint, and the case may be urgent. Kindly postpone
  your curiosity as to my personal appearance until you have seen your
  patient."</p>

  <p>I raised the lamp high over my head and looked him full in the face. He
  bore my examination without flinching; and I hurried into my coat and hat
  with a sigh not unmixed with relief. His was no villain's face&mdash;it was
  strong and proud, and in a certain way impenetrable, but it was a man's face
  and the face of no ordinary man.</p>

  <p>"I will come at once," I answered. "I am ready now."</p>

  <p>We went out into the street together. I had expected to find my companion
  silent and reserved, but he commenced talking at once.</p>

  <p>"I learn from Miss Desmond that you have been very good to her. Dr.
  Faggett," he said slowly. "She has been in sore straits, I fear, and has
  needed friends."</p>

  <p>"I am not aware of any particular goodness on my part," I answered
  stiffly. "I have only done what Miss Desmond has a right to expect from
  me&mdash;or any other of my patients."</p>

  <p>"You have done more; but I fear that you are prejudiced against me, Dr.
  Faggett. I do not know how much Marian&mdash;Miss Desmond&mdash;has told you
  of her history, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She has told me nothing."</p>

  <p>"I do not wonder at it; she is naturally reserved. You knew; at any rate,
  that she was expecting a visitor to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I was that visitor. You may have surmised that?"</p>

  <p>"I imagined so; and also, from your errand to me, that your visit was a
  disappointment to her."</p>

  <p>"I fear so," he answered in a low tone; "I fear so."</p>

  <p>"Then, at any rate, it is my duty to tell you, sir, that events may make
  you her murderer," I said pitilessly.</p>

  <p>We were passing a gas-lamp, and the momentary view which I had of his face
  startled me. It was pale, as though with a sudden horror, and great beads of
  perspiration were standing out upon his forehead; never before or since have
  I seen such agony upon a human face. The people who thronged the pavement
  glanced curiously at him, and then at me. To escape their observation I
  increased my pace a little, and as we threaded our way amongst them I heard
  him whisper in my ear&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If you can save her, doctor, your fee shall be a thousand guineas."</p>

  <p>"Only you can do that," I answered sharply.</p>

  <p>There was no reply. I looked round, and found that he was no longer by my
  side. Across the road I could see him vanishing in the mist. Without
  hesitation I pushed onward. I cared nothing for him: I was only anxious to
  reach my patient.</p>

  <p>A few hours before I should have scoffed at the very idea of attaching any
  importance to what are known as presentiments. Yet from the moment when I
  came in sight of that grim, smoke-stained tenement, and hurried up the crazy,
  uncarpeted stairs, I was conscious of a dim foreshadowing of some sort of
  evil. For a wonder, there was no brawling in the lower rooms, no sound of
  angry, drunken voices from any of the half-opened doors. Only now and then,
  on the landings, I heard the heavy breathings of sleeping men and women,
  lying about like rats upon the floor. I reached the last flight of stairs,
  and the candle in my hand shook so that the drops fell spluttering upon the
  ground. Was she alone, I wondered? was there no one to watch by her side and
  wait for my coming? If she had recovered from her faint, how dreary the time
  must seem!</p>

  <p>I pressed on, and came to a standstill outside her door. Still
  silence&mdash;deep, unendurable silence&mdash;and still that vague sense of
  some evil close at hand.</p>

  <p>Fearfully I pushed open the door and stood upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>My first sense was one of relief. In the dim twilight I could just catch
  the outline of a dear, familiar figure leaning back in a chair drawn up to
  the fireplace. But the fire was a handful of white ashes, and the figure
  never turned to greet me. The chill of the room struck into my heart, and my
  voice trembled as I called out to her&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Miss Desmond, wake up? It is I&mdash;Dr. Faggett!"</p>

  <p>No answer. The figure in the chair was still and silent. With trembling
  fingers I raised the candle high over my head, and peered forward to where
  its pale, sickly glow smote the darkness. Oh, the horror of that
  moment&mdash;the unspeakable horror of it! I felt my knees totter, a mist
  floating before my eyes, and a deadly sickness creep like a numbing paralysis
  over all my senses. Yet, through it all, I knew that it was she who reclined
  in that straight-backed chair, still and cold, with a little spot of blood on
  the bosom of her dress, and a dagger driven straight into her heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>She was dead. She must have died in a single moment, for there was no
  trace of even the slightest spasm in her white, still face. Nay, something of
  the old softness was still lingering around her tightly compressed mouth, and
  the half-closed eyes, vacant though they were, had none of the glazed
  hardness of death. In those moments of anguish I forgot my first duty. I
  forgot everything except that I had loved this woman; and sinking on my
  knees, I caught her hands in mine and buried my face in her lap. There I
  remained, heedless of the flight of time, for hour after hour of the long
  winter's night.</p>

  <p>I arose at last and stood by the little window with tightly clasped hands,
  acutely conscious of all that happened, the ethical horror of it mingling
  with my own sense of personal loss. The little chamber was seven storeys
  high; and away eastwards I could see a faint streak of light, and presently a
  blood-red sun shining down through the white vaporous mists upon the
  awakening city. I watched it gradually appear until its first struggling rays
  smote the dome of St. Paul's and the noises increased in the streets below.
  Then for the first time utterance came to me, and the pent-up agony of my
  heart escaped in one long, deep cry&mdash;a cry of wrath, of bitter,
  relentless anger, against the man who had done this thing. And with that cry
  ended the first chapter of my life.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>"It is really quite impossible for any one to be bored at Mauleven Abbey.
  Lady Mary always has something fresh going."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it a delightful thought? One feels so much more interest in the
  performance, too, seeing it down here in one's own drawing-room. I'm sure I
  wanted to go to the Adelaide Hall awfully, but Henry wouldn't let me. He
  wasn't quite sure that it was proper&mdash;such nonsense! Now I feel quite
  repaid for my disappointment. It really is charming of you, Lady Mary, and I
  am looking forward to this evening tremendously."</p>

  <p>"So am I."</p>

  <p>"And I."</p>

  <p>"And I," I added grimly, from my position somewhat in the background.</p>

  <p>Lady Mauleven turned towards me with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Faggett, I recognize the voice of an unbeliever, do I not? You have
  no faith in Mademoiselle Astrea's powers? Am I not right?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, Lady Mary," I answered, bowing, "I have no sympathy for, or
  belief in, psychology as interpreted by Mademoiselle Astrea and her
  disciples."</p>

  <p>"How do you explain the phenomena which she produces, then?" asked another
  of the group of ladies.</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I have been to Maskelyne and Cooke's," I answered; "I saw some wonderful
  things there, but I could not explain them unless I was let into the
  secret."</p>

  <p>"You think, then, that we have reached the limit of knowledge and control
  over the natural forces of the world?"</p>

  <p>"I do not say that," I answered gravely; "indeed, I should be very sorry
  to say it. But I do not believe in the Mahatmas and Initiates of Miss
  Astrea."</p>

  <p>"There have been strange things seen. All London is talking of it."</p>

  <p>"London is generally talking about something," I replied.</p>

  <p>"By the bye, Lady Mary," some one interrupted; "if it is not a rude
  question, however did you persuade Astrea to come here? I heard that she
  would never even lecture in private except to Theosophists, and abhorred
  anything in the shape of a performance."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary looked a little perplexed.</p>

  <p>"That is so, I believe," she answered. "To tell you the truth, I was as
  much surprised as any one. Mr. Fitzgerald took me to her home twice, and as I
  was coming away the last time, I asked her, never imagining that she would
  accept, to spend Christmas here with us."</p>

  <p>"And she accepted?"</p>

  <p>"At once. 'I should be very pleased to come,' she said, if you would allow
  me one evening to speak to your guests&mdash;Christmas Eve.' Of course, I
  said that I should be charmed."</p>

  <p>"And she has actually come?"</p>

  <p>"She arrived an hour ago. She is having tea in her room, and will not
  appear until evening. Then she is going to lecture, or give a performance of
  some sort, in the library."</p>

  <p>"She won't come down to dinner, then?"</p>

  <p>"No; she begged to be excused. She likes to be quiet always for an hour or
  two before appearing in public. I wonder when the men will be back? It's a
  horrid day for shooting."</p>

  <p>The conversation drifted away; and, as was natural amongst a little group
  of women drinking afternoon tea at an English country-house, became
  incomprehensible to me. It was odd that I, an old bachelor, forty years old,
  with little taste for gaiety, should find myself spending Christmas at
  Mauleven Abbey; but Lady Mary had attacked me at a weak moment, and the
  inducements she offered&mdash;four meets with the Quoni in one week and the
  pick of the stable&mdash;were irresistible. A bad day's hunting and a thick,
  drizzling rain had brought me home before the rest of the men, who had thrown
  in their lot with the shooting-party, and accounted for my presence at so
  feminine a gathering.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a tramping in the hall and the sound of men's voices.
  The door was thrown open, and the Earl of Mauleven and the remainder of his
  guests entered. It chanced that, though I had known Lady Mary for several
  years, I had never met her husband, and I was looking forward to doing so
  with some curiosity; for Lord Mauleven was a famous man both in the House of
  Lords and in the literary world. So I rose and scanned his face with some
  interest as he advanced towards me with outstretched hand and courteous
  smile.</p>

  <p>Twenty years had not dulled my memory a jot, and in Lord Mauleven I saw at
  once the man whom the shrewdest detectives in England had sought for in vain.
  Iron grey had mingled with the coal black hair, and a deep furrow was
  engraven across his forehead. Yet there was the same fine dignity of carriage
  and perfection of features. It was the face of a scholar and an artist. As a
  physiognomist, I should certainly have ranked it the face of a man of high
  principles and noble birth. Yet I knew better. I alone knew that Geoffrey,
  Earl of Mauleven, was the man whom a coroner's jury had found guilty of the
  murder of Marian Desmond well-nigh twenty years ago.</p>

  <p>If he recognized me, and I believe that he did, his nerve was magnificent.
  He affected not to notice the withdrawal of my hand, and welcomed rue to
  Mauleven Abbey in a few well-chosen and graceful sentences. Then he passed on
  to speak to some one else, and the meeting was over.</p>

  <p>I stood back in the shadows of the room like a man stunned, striving to
  realize this thing. It had come so suddenly and so unexpectedly. Lord
  Mauleven, scholar, author, and diplomatist, was the murderer of Marian
  Desmond. It was inconceivable, and yet it was true, I told myself fiercely.
  He should have no mercy from me. As he had sinned, so should he pay the
  penalty. Neither rank nor fame should save him from my vengeance which was,
  indeed, only a simple act of justice.</p>

  <p>I looked at him&mdash;tall, debonair, and courtly, moving about with all
  the distinction of his fine presence amongst the little scattered group of
  his guests; but my heart knew no pity. At that moment memories of the only
  woman whom I had ever cared for were rising up within me, strong and undimmed
  by time. Across that weary gulf of years I seemed to see once more her sweet,
  worn face, with all its patient hope and longing, so ill rewarded. The
  luxurious chamber, with all its wealth and colouring, its dainty lounges and
  cosy recesses, seemed to contract into a barely-furnished attic, and the
  roaring fire which burned brightly upon the fine open hearth, piled up with
  pine-logs, into a handful of white ashes. And when the dream-pictures floated
  before my vacant eyes had passed away, they left me full of a living anger. I
  would leave the Abbey this very hour and lay my information before the
  authorities of Scotland Yard. And with this intention I rose and, ostensibly
  to dress for dinner, left the room and mounted the broad oak staircase.</p>

  <p>My apartment was the last in the long row in the main gallery. I had
  reached it, and was on the point of entering, when I heard the trailing of a
  woman's draperies close beside me, and almost immediately felt a touch upon
  my arm, and heard my name distinctly pronounced.</p>

  <p>I turned round, and for the moment fancied myself the victim of some
  transient hallucination. It seemed, indeed, as though the two figures who had
  dwelt so long in that dim shadow-land of memory, but glided afresh into my
  life on this dark winter's afternoon, for the woman who had spoken my name
  and who stood by my side was surely looking up at me with Marian's eyes and
  had spoken with Marian's voice. Yet when I looked again I found it was not
  so. She was slighter and much smaller than Marian had been, and her
  complexion was altogether different. She had the appearance of a woman who
  had lived in some far southern land. Her skin was almost olive-hued, and her
  dark, glowing eyes, shining up at me from amidst the hair which waved all
  around her small oval face, had an odd, penetrating force. She was a curious
  figure to encounter at any time, with her wonderful eyes and quaint bizarre
  beauty; and the suddenness of her approach and that strange resemblance to
  the dead, coming at a time when my whole being was shaken with memories of
  the past, seemed to endow her personality with a suggestion of the
  supernatural. If I showed anything of this in my face, she took no notice of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Faggett, it is I&mdash;Marian Desmond's sister. You were her friend,
  and you were good to her. How is it that I find you here, a guest beneath her
  murderer's roof?"</p>

  <p>"I saw his face for the first time ten minutes ago," I answered slowly. "I
  am leaving the Abbey at once. I go to bring him to book."</p>

  <p>She held up her hand. A gleam of the early moonlight stole through the
  mullioned window and fell upon her face. It no longer resembled her sister's.
  The features were set, and cold, and hard, the eyes were blazing with
  passion.</p>

  <p>"Stay! His hour has already come, and your hand need not strike. Think not
  that you alone have thirsted for vengeance against this man. In the mountains
  of India I saw the deed done, and I heard my sister's death-cry ring over
  land and ocean in my ears. The God of my belief raised the veil and I saw. I
  bowed my head and I was silent. I sought counsel of those who knew, and I
  held my peace. The reward came slowly, but it has come. Nirvana, the sweetest
  goal of life, is before my eyes. The blessed Initiates of the East have
  called me sister. Powers and forces hidden and unknown to you bend themselves
  to my will. Stay this night and see the end. It is my bidding.</p>

  <p>"I am Astrea, and I command. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>She seemed to vanish from my eyes without bodily movement. Or might it not
  have been that the thick clouds which had floated across the moon had filled
  the gallery with sudden darkness? I closed the door of my room and told
  myself that I had spoken with a mad woman. But I did her bidding&mdash;I
  waited.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>At nine o'clock in the evening the curtain rose on this last scene in the
  drama of life. The great library of Mauleven Abbey was thronged with such a
  company as its walls had never before enclosed, and the air was full of the
  rustling of gowns and suppressed whispering. Every one was full of curiosity
  to hear what this woman, whose name had suddenly become famous, would have to
  say about the unknown science. Would she have new wonders to
  reveal&mdash;perhaps even miracles to perform? There was an uncertainty about
  it all which was perfectly delightful. It seemed as though anything might
  happen in that great chamber, with its quaint, dark recesses, where no light
  fell and where the very air had a bookish, musty flavour suggestive of a
  mystery and necromancy. It was quite a charming idea of Lady Mauleven's every
  one declared; and her Ladyship, leaning back in an olive-green
  <i>fauteuil</i>, close to the front, felt sincerely grateful to Astrea for
  her unaccountable whim.</p>

  <p>I had chosen a seat, or rather a standing-place, with my back to the wall,
  directly opposite Lord Mauleven. Our eyes had met only once, but it was
  sufficient. I knew that he had recognized me, and I knew, too, that he had
  some idea of the danger before him.</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur and then an intense quiet amongst the audience.
  Some heavy curtains at the other end of the apartment had been thrown back,
  and Astrea stepped slowly forward. I can see her now as she stood there, pale
  and still, with her great luminous eyes wandering far over the heads of the
  expectant audience, and her lips moving slowly, as though repeating some
  prayer or lesson to herself. A deep, awesome hush fell upon the crowd of
  fashionably dressed men and women. Lord Mauleven alone appeared unmoved and
  careless. He had given up his place to a late arrival, and was leaning
  against a pillar with his face half in the shadow. I only could read beneath
  that faint, supercilious smile which was hovering round his fine mouth.</p>

  <p>Astrea slowly dropped her eyes and spoke. The first words which fell from
  her riveted the attention of her listeners. Some hidden electricity seemed to
  lurk in the timbre of her tone. Every one, even those who had come prepared
  to treat the affair as a joke, or some light form of entertainment, were
  galvanized into rapt and breathless attention.</p>

  <p>"Some one has said that I am going to lecture upon theosophy," she
  commenced dreamily. "That is not so&mdash;theosophy is not to be taught by
  code and rule. Those who seek light and truth should seek it in solitude and
  mental isolation. The greatest of our teachers can only supply the raw
  material. Each must pursue for himself the dark and narrow path which leads
  alone to perfect understanding, to perfect light, and to the perfect
  knowledge of all those hidden laws and forces which mock and elude the
  uninitiated. To-night I am breaking the first principles laid down by those
  who have become the high-priests of our order. I am going to show you all a
  miracle. I am going to speak with one who has been for a long while dead. You
  shall hear her voice; you shall hear of her life; she shall speak to you of
  the mariner of her death. And this I do for a purpose of my own, and with no
  desire to make converts of any of you.</p>

  <p>"Far away in my eastern home, amongst the mountains, I have heard her
  faint, sweet whisperings in my ear at the break of the day. In the gloom of
  twilight I have seen her dim, reproachful eyes; and in the white mists of the
  midnight hour, upon the hills, I have seen her sweep slowly by, sad and
  mournful. Yet I have not called her to me. I have waited for this; and now
  the thing has come. Marian! Marian! come, beloved sister! It is Astrea who
  calls you!"</p>

  <p>She had raised her hands with a slow, sweeping grace, and stood for a
  moment perfectly motionless. Then, breaking a silence of death, sweet and low
  as the music of an aeolian harp stirred by the faintest of summer breezes,
  the sound of a woman's answering voice floated upon the air&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am with thee, Astrea; speak."</p>

  <p>Astrea raised her hands and answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I would talk with thee for one brief moment only, of the past&mdash;of
  the sad days of your life upon earth. Look back with me upon our home. You
  have not forgotten?"</p>

  <p>The wonderful music of that answering voice again filled the room.</p>

  <p>"I forget nothing, Astrea. I see our fair country home and our dear
  parents. I see the hedges white with hawthorn blossom, the common starred
  with poppies and corn-flowers, and great yellow marigolds down in the
  marshes, and the sloping fields golden with ripe corn, and bending like waves
  of the sea before the summer wind. I have found peace and rest, my sister;
  but earth, too, is a fair place!"</p>

  <p>"Fair for you, Marian, till a man's treachery made it black and foul. Do
  you remember the night when, full of joy and love, you whispered out your
  secret to me and we shed tears of happiness together? Do you remember the day
  when, blithe and trustful, you followed your lover to London? Do you remember
  the bitter hour of awakening when the light died out of your life, the weary
  waiting, the heart-sickness, the bowed grey heads of our father and mother,
  hastened in their passage to the grave?"</p>

  <p>"Too well&mdash;too well," sobbed out the answering voice. "Astrea,
  forbear. Question me no more."</p>

  <p>A strange light burned in Astrea's dark eyes. Her hands were raised high
  above her head, and her form seemed dilated and quivering with passion.</p>

  <p>"Marian, the man whose selfishness wrecked your life and broke our
  parents' hearts lives. He is great, and honoured, and respected. Say but the
  word and I will crush him. The world for which he lives shall look upon his
  buried past; my hand shall raise the veil, my finger shall point at his
  shame, my voice, my testimony, shall denounce him. Think of the hour when you
  found yourself deserted, and with your life ruined, struggling against
  starvation in a garret, whilst he wandered off in ease and luxury, a willing
  exile. You know well that he never sought to find you after that night when
  you left him in horror and shame. Think of that day when at last he was
  forced to visit you. Remember his greeting, his dismay at your just demand;
  remember, Marian, remember his refusal! I will not ask you how you died, by
  his hand or yours; but Heaven knows that he was your murderer. Heaven's
  curses lighten upon him! I thirst for vengeance, my sister. Say that one word
  and open my lips."</p>

  <p>There was no movement, no voice heard. Every one sat waiting, half-dazed,
  stricken dumb by the passion of Astrea's prayer, and dimly fearing some
  terrible <i>dénouement</i>. The moonlight fell upon their white upturned
  faces, and showed more than one strong man quivering with excitement. The
  entertainment had grown wonderfully realistic; where would it end?</p>

  <p>Suddenly the intense stillness was broken by the chiming of the great
  Abbey clock. It was midnight. Some one who stood near one of the windows
  threw it open, and with the rush of frosty air came the sudden glad pealing
  of bells from the village church. It was Christmas morn. And, mingling with
  the sound, yet rising clear and sweet above it, came once more the music of
  that spirit voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Astrea, beloved sister, in the old days we prayed together, 'Forgive us
  our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.' Far away, over
  the valleys and the hills, I seem to hear those words stealing up to me in
  the music of the Christmas bells. I died by my own hand, and the sin was my
  own. For the rest, I charge thee, Astrea, forgive&mdash;forgive."</p>

  <p>A deep sob escaped from Lord Mauleven's lips; but in that moment of
  intense suspense no one, save myself, had noticed it. Astrea turned slowly
  round and disappeared. The lights were turned up, and the spell of silence
  was broken. The curtain had fallen, the play was over.</p>

     id="ch-17"></a>17.&mdash;THE QUARRY ON OLD JOHN HILL</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Dec 1901, as <i>The Ghost
  of Old John Hill</i><br>
  Illustrated by Abbey Altson</h3>

  <p class="first">If I commence my story, or rather my recital, with any
  particularities as to my personality and present condition, the chances are
  that I shall alienate in no small degree, perhaps altogether, the attention
  and interest which my narrative might otherwise gain. And yet, after very
  careful deliberation, I have decided to confess my secret in these few
  opening lines. I am a madman. Even while I write I am watched by a keen-eyed
  attendant (mine is a private asylum, and we don't call them warders). To all
  intents and purposes I am a prisoner. Of the world outside this&mdash;shall
  we say retreat?&mdash;I know nothing, nor shall I ever enter it again.
  Empires may rise and fall, all Europe might blaze from Madrid to Moscow with
  fierce war and bloodshed, kingdoms might become republics, and republics
  might seek again the yoke of monarchy&mdash;to me it would all be one.
  Outside these walls I shall never step. I have wit enough to conceal my
  partial recovery, for I know very well that this refuge is all that stands
  between me and the murderer's dock.</p>

  <p>The winter of 19&mdash; I was compelled through ill-health to spend
  abroad. Perhaps it would be as well to here remark that my malady was one
  which affected in no degree my nervous system or my mental powers. It was, in
  fact, nothing but a slight weakness of the lungs, which had caused my medical
  attendant to earnestly recommend my spending the winter months in some warmer
  climate; and as I was my own master and had no ties to keep me in England,
  and as, moreover, the idea of escaping from the chilly humours and dreary
  fogs of our own country to bask under the warm southern sun and the blue sky
  of the Riviera was in itself no means displeasing to me, I took his
  advice.</p>

  <p>I was staying at a small old-fashioned little town known to tourists, and
  some distance out of the beaten track of the shoals of health-seeking
  Europeans and sight-seeing Americans, who made this region their happy
  hunting-ground. The hotel was no more than an inn, but the limetree-bordered
  promenade outside was seldom pressed by the foot of a stranger. There was in
  the place itself, its architecture, or its surroundings, little that was
  picturesque or attractive. But, nevertheless, it pleased me, and I had
  prolonged my stay for a week or two, and was still without any settled idea
  of going. Strange to say, it was the very dullness of the place which
  attracted and kept me there. It suited the mood which I happened to be
  in.</p>

  <p>One evening after my solitary dinner&mdash;<i>table d'hôte</i> there was
  none&mdash;I had strolled, as usual, with a cigar in my mouth, down the
  promenade. I had had but little exercise during the day, or a fit of laziness
  had been upon me, and the weather had been anything but tempting, and so it
  happened that when I reached the end of the narrow sanded walk I felt
  reluctant to turn back. The night was a pleasant one for walking, and seemed
  all the pleasanter after the hot winds and blazing sun which had kept me
  lounging about under cover all day. I hesitated only for a moment, leaning
  over the low swing gate at the extremity of the promenade. Then, passing
  through it, I stepped out on to the broad high-road, and walked steadily
  ahead.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>In about a quarter of an hour I reached four cross-roads. The road to the
  left, the road straight on, and the road behind me I knew well. The road to
  the right I had never taken, perhaps because it commenced with a remarkably
  stiff ascent and appeared to lead nowhere, for it was little more than a
  grass-grown cattle-track. But looking along it to-night a sensation of which
  I had certainly never before been conscious seized swiftly hold of me. I was
  filled with a sudden strong curiosity to explore the ill-kept, neglected
  by-road.</p>

  <p>It was a curiosity which increased with every step I took, and became
  gradually coupled with a vague, incomprehensible premonition. What manner of
  a prospect I expected to behold from the top of the hill which I was rapidly
  ascending I cannot tell, but I had a distinct and firm conviction that
  something out of the common was about to happen to me.</p>

  <p>By degrees the road along which I was walking presented more and more the
  appearance of a mere sheep-track, until at last the hedges on either side
  terminated, the road itself degenerated into a footpath, and I found myself
  ascending a high turf-covered hill. I was the more surprised because in my
  wanderings around the district I had never noticed anything of the nature of
  an eminence in this direction. However, I kept steadily on, till at last I
  reached the summit, and, pausing to take breath, looked around me in a
  startled curiosity which was not without a considerable amount of awe.</p>

  <p>Stranger and stranger it all seemed to me. Close by my side, on the
  highest point of the hill, was a round tower built of rough grey stone, which
  I was quite certain that I had never seen before. Below me and all around,
  the country, clearly visible in the moonlight, was of a character totally
  unlike any which my many walks in the vicinity had made familiar to me.
  Instead of the long vineyard-covered slopes and groves of olive-trees, was a
  thoroughly English deer-park studded with giant oaks and dark patches of fir
  trees, and stretching away beyond a purely pastoral country with deep yellow
  cornfields and rich meadows, in many of which were dotted about the dark
  shapes of reclining cattle. On my left hand yawned a cleft-like chasm,
  overhung at the brink with thick bracken and drooping bushes&mdash;evidently
  a disused slate quarry, for a broken shaft lay rotting on the ground, and all
  around were thick layers of broken-up slate.</p>

  <p>I passed my hand across my eyes, half wondering whether I had not been
  walking in my sleep; and then as I opened them again I started back with a
  cry of horror, which rang out sharply into the clear night air, only to die
  away in a sort of tremor from my white trembling lips. Face to face with me
  stood, or rather crouched, a man, a tall dark man, with white, scared face
  and large, wildly bright eyes riveted on mine. It seemed as though he had
  turned round suddenly from peering down into the black depths of the chasm,
  and was horror-struck to see me.</p>

  <p>Despite the cold night breeze, the perspiration streamed down from my hot,
  clammy forehead. I strove to speak; but I could not, like unwilling actors,
  in a silent tableau, we stood face to face, speechless, motionless,
  fascinated. No sound broke the deep stillness of the summer night; no words
  could I force from my ashen lips after that first hoarse cry.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came faintly to my ears the sound of a low, moaning cry,
  and almost simultaneously I saw a tuft of the bracken which overhung the
  chasm shaken violently. A deeper chill ran through me; it seemed as though
  the blood in my veins was turned to ice, and I stood motionless, my feet
  frozen to the ground with fear. Slowly I distinguished something white moving
  amongst the turf of ferns. At first it seemed shapeless, but as my eyes grew
  accustomed to the darkness it gradually resolved itself into a pair of white
  hands clutching desperately at the roots of the ferns, as though the person
  to whom they belonged was striving frantically to draw himself up from
  beneath. Almost he seemed about to succeed, for, as I leaned over towards the
  spot with spell-bound gaze, a white, desperate face, colourless with fear,
  save where smeared with blood from a wound in the temple, slowly appeared
  above the brink of the chasm, and I could tell from the convulsive swaying of
  the shoulders that the struggling man was making frantic attempts to obtain a
  foothold.</p>

        title="Illustration"><br>

  <p>The horrible sight seemed to loosen my joints, which had become stiff with
  fear, and with a cry of encouragement I sprang forward to his aid. But the
  crowning horror of the whole scene was to come. The man whom I had first seen
  turned suddenly round, and, raising a gun which lay flat upon the ground
  beside him, brandished it high over his head, and brought it down with a
  sickening thud upon the struggling fingers. A wild shriek of despair burst
  from the lips of his victim as his hands relaxed their hold upon the bracken,
  and I reached the edge of the chasm only in time to see him stiff and rigid
  in mid-air, his arms stretched wildly up to the starlit sky, in the very act
  of falling backwards, to see him and to recognize in his ghastly countenance
  the face of the man who had been my close companion for years, my sworn
  college chum, and the only man whom I had ever cared to call a
  friend&mdash;Philip Hardingstone, Squire of Little Hampton.</p>

  <p>Wild impulses, mad thoughts, rushed like lightning through my surging
  brain. I would have leaped after him into the black chasm. I would have
  struck down the murderer of my friend, and, with my fingers clutching his
  throat, have wrought out a speedy vengeance. I would have shrieked out my
  horror to the silent night, but I was powerless. Again some strange
  metamorphosis crept subtly and swiftly over me. Not one of these things could
  I do. My feet seemed suddenly sinking through the yielding ground; the scene
  around me closed in, growing dimmer and dimmer, until at last
  everything&mdash;my senses, my instincts, my very consciousness of
  existence&mdash;was merged in an apathetic chaos. What immediately followed
  is hard for me to say. There was no period of absolute blank unconsciousness,
  but my material surroundings seemed suddenly to change from chaotic
  indistinctness to a scene which I knew quite well. I found myself, without
  any sense of motion or having moved, leaning against a gate looking over a
  sloping vineyard only a few yards away from the cross-roads. Thunderstruck
  and bewildered, I gazed wildly about me for a few moments. Then turning
  round, I hurried along the grass-grown track. In vain; I came to no hill, and
  the path beneath my feet grew into a broad, white highroad, winding far away
  into a level stretch of rolling plains. This way and that, backward and
  forward, I ran like a man demented. Far away in the east the sun was slowly
  bursting through a mass of orange-streaked clouds, scattering a purple and
  golden glory all over the azure sky. Morning came, noon, and afternoon; then
  my wearied limbs gave way, and I sank down on the roadside and prayed that
  the unconsciousness that was already stealing over me, numbing my frenzied
  brain and throbbing senses, might come soon. It came as I lay there, blotting
  out the hideous scene which all through the day had been dancing before my
  eyes, and the memory of the ghastly, diabolical face of Philip Hardingstone's
  murderer. With a sigh of relief, I turned on my side and fainted.</p>

  <p>Some peasants going home from their day's toil in the vineyards stumbled
  upon me, and finding my address on an envelope in my pocket, carried me down
  to the hotel. Towards afternoon on the next day I recovered consciousness,
  and with it came flooding in upon my memory the fearful scene which I had
  witnessed. In spite of the doctor's peremptory orders, I insisted upon
  sitting up in bed and writing out with trembling fingers a telegram to Philip
  Hardingstone, imploring him to let me know by return that he was well. Until
  the reply came I could do nothing, but lay tossing restlessly about, on the
  verge of a fever. Towards evening an orange-coloured envelope was brought to
  my bedside, and I tore it hastily open.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"From John Elwick, butler at Little Hampton Hall, to
  Reginald Morton, Hotel de Paris.&mdash;Your telegram received. Please come to
  England at once, Mr. Hardingstone was killed this morning falling down the
  slate quarry on Old John Hill."</p><br>

  <p>For five weeks I lay ill of a brain fever, and even when its acute stage
  had passed, and I was able to move about a little, my doctor watched me
  anxiously, and seemed far from satisfied with my state. I myself knew that a
  change had come upon me. My memory seemed partially gone; I was subject to
  frequent fits of delirious excitement, and to corresponding periods of
  intense depression. When at last I flatly refused to stay where I was any
  longer, and left for England Dr. F&mdash;&mdash; insisted upon my engaging a
  servant of his own recommendation to travel with me. And I knew why: I felt
  that I was going mad.</p>

  <p>Immediately on my arrival in London I telegraphed to John Elwick to come
  up from Little Hampton to my hotel. The next morning he came.</p>

  <p>From him I heard the manner in which his master was supposed to have met
  his death. It seemed that he had left home with his gun and a couple of dogs,
  and had sent down to the keeper's lodge, for Wilson, the underkeeper, to meet
  him with some beaters and a favourite spaniel of his on Old John Hill. When
  they arrived there they found no signs of their master. They waited for an
  hour, and then sent down to the house. The reply came back that Mr.
  Hardingstone had left at the time appointed, and had not returned. They
  waited for another hour, and then one of the keepers, strolling about,
  noticed the torn bracken and tumbled earth at the side of the quarry. Ropes
  were sent for, and a search was instantly commenced. Late at night the body
  was found, fearfully mangled and crushed. The conclusion instantly arrived at
  by every one was that he had made a false step and fallen over the
  dangerously exposed edge by accident.</p>

  <p>I listened to the recital in silence. When Elwick had concluded, and stood
  with his head turned suspiciously away from me, I asked a question:</p>

  <p>"Who succeeded to the estates, Elwick?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Esholt, sir, his nephew," answered Elwick somewhat huskily.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Esholt! Tell me everything that you know about him," I demanded.</p>

  <p>Elwick shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"That won't be much, sir, and nothing very good. They do say that he has
  been a terrible scamp. He's only been to the Hall twice, and each time it was
  to borrow money. I remember last time he came I heard the master say to him,
  just before he went, that it would be of no use his coming again, for he
  would never give him another penny."</p>

  <p>"Where was Mr. Esholt when this happened?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In Chicago, sir; leastways, so he said," Elwick answered doubtfully. "He
  turned up about a fortnight ago in London and said that he had come straight
  from there."</p>

  <p>"Can you describe him?" I asked, and waited for the answer with an
  impatience which I utterly failed to conceal.</p>

  <p>Elwick did so. He was tall and sallow, with black eyes and hair. Then I
  knew this was the man who had murdered my friend.</p>

  <p>"It's almost a wonder, sir, as you haven't heard nothing of him, seeing as
  Miss Clara&mdash;" hesitated suddenly and looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean my sister, Elwick?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; Miss Clara and her aunt, Lady Alice, sir; they're often at the
  Hall, and they do say, sir, begging your pardon, as how we shall soon be
  having a mistress at the old place."</p>

  <p>I arose from my seat dazed and trembling, and hurried from the room. In my
  other apartment was a little pile of letters which I had not as yet looked
  at. Hastily selecting those from my aunt and my sister, I tore them open and
  scanned them through.</p>

  <p>My vague fears turned swiftly into a distinct sense of horror. From first
  to last they were full of praises of my old friend's nephew, who was quite a
  dose neighbour of theirs; and my aunt's letters, which I looked at first,
  were full of hints as to the cause of his constant visits and attentions to
  my sister Clara. I threw them down and opened Clara's letters. They were more
  explicit still. Mr. Esholt had asked her to become his wife. Would I come
  down and meet him? There was another letter in the pile, the handwriting of
  which was strange to me. I tore it open. It was signed George Esholt, and
  contained a formal offer for my sister's hand.</p>

  <p>Again there came that terrible tightening of the brain, that hideous
  vision before my eyes, and a monotonous buzzing in my ears. I knew that this
  was madness, and I fell on my knees and prayed that it might leave me, if
  only for a little while My prayer was granted. I fell asleep and awoke weak
  and full of strange thoughts and sensations but with my purpose still clear
  before me.</p>

  <p>By the mid-day train I travelled down to Little Hampton, and, hiring a fly
  at the station, drove at once to the Hall. Mr. Esholt was in the park with
  some ladies, I was told. Would I await his return, or should they send in
  search for him? I replied that I would go and try to find him myself. And
  with that purpose I crossed the terraced lawns, and, dismissing the man who
  would have been my guide, I strode away across the smooth, velvety turf.</p>

  <p>Far away in the distance, amongst the gray, crumbling walls of some
  ivy-covered ruins, I saw light dresses flitting about, and towards these I
  directed my footsteps. I reached them unobserved, and, crouching down behind
  the remnant of a pillar, peered into the enclosure where the little group
  were standing talking.</p>

  <p>I saw what I had expected to see: the man whose face had haunted me
  without ceasing since that terrible night, my aunt, and my sister. They were
  speaking with raised voices, and I listened.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Esholt, you positively shall not refuse to take me there again. I
  will go, sir. If you won't take me, I shall go alone."</p>

  <p>I recognized Clara's imperious voice, and I knew at once that she would
  have her way. But he did not yield all at once. I saw his pale face grow
  paler, and he seemed to be keeping back a shudder only with a great
  effort.</p>

  <p>"Clara," he said, "can you wonder that I hate the place? Don't ask me to
  take you there, please."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, and I leaned my burning forehead against the
  stone wall, and through the chinks I could see that my sister was standing a
  little apart, with an angry frown upon her fair face. Then he approached her
  slowly. There was a short whispered conversation, and finally she left his
  side with an air of satisfied triumph.</p>

  <p>"Auntie, we are going. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Alice shook her head and leaned back in her impromptu seat&mdash;the
  fallen, moss-covered trunk of a giant tree.</p>

  <p>"No, I'll wait for you. My hill-climbing days are over."</p>

  <p>Then I saw them leave her, hand-in-hand, and at a safe distance I
  followed, keeping just inside a long plantation of fir trees during the first
  part of the ascent, and afterwards bending low down amongst the tall bracken,
  ready to disappear altogether should they look round. Before me lay the high
  grass-covered hill, the round gray tower, and the quarry, just as I had seen
  them all on that horrible night. At every step I took, every time my eyes
  fell upon him bending over my sister with all a lover's tenderness, the
  weight upon my brain seemed to grow heavier. Earth and sky seemed dancing
  around me in fantastic shapes, and the dark branches of the pine trees
  stooped down and whispered to me, murder, murder, murder! A band of iron
  seemed to be tightening itself around my forehead, but my feet touched the
  grass and met with no more resistance than if I had been walking upon air.
  All continuity of thought and memory seemed to be breaking up within me, and
  I felt a strange, wild craving to shout, to run and leap, to burst out into
  peals of laughter. But still I kept my eyes on the ascending pair in front of
  me and stealthily followed them. They reached the top almost at the same
  moment as I also gained it by a more devious track and concealed myself
  behind a mass of rock. They moved to the side of the chasm, she full of awed
  curiosity, he pale and shrinking. Then up from my hiding-place I leaped, and
  stood before them, wild and dishevelled, with my burning eyes fixed upon his
  ghastly face, pointing, pointing with shaking hand into the abyss below.</p>

  <p>"Murderer, murderer!" I shrieked, and the wild west wind caught up my cry
  and carried it down into the valley and bore it against the rock-strewn hills
  opposite, till the very air seemed ringing with echoes of that one word. He
  shrunk back from me in an agony of dumb-stricken fear, and leaned trembling
  against the tower. I followed him, caught him by the throat, and bore him
  struggling to the chasm. He snatched at a tuft of bracken; I tore it up by
  the roots and flung it down into the black water below. He dug his fingers
  into the mould. I stamped upon them until he relaxed his hold, and then,
  seizing him by the waist, I pushed him back, back, back, to the very edge of
  the chasm, and hurled him backwards. In mid-air, as his struggling feet left
  the ground, he shrieked out for mercy. I laughed back at him, and, leaning
  over the side, watched his quivering body fall until it disappeared in the
  black waters below&mdash;watched it, laughing all the time with the fierce,
  delirious joy of madness, and it seemed to me that the rocks and the trees,
  and the very clouds were laughing with me. Everything seemed to me laughing,
  except the white, unconscious form of my sister, who lay fainting on the
  grass. Mad, mad, mad! Yes, I'm mad enough at times. I was a raving lunatic
  when they tried me for murder, and my trial was a farce, for before it was
  over they brought me here to this asylum. Sometimes my reason returns to me
  for a brief while. I am sane now, but it will not be for long. Even now it is
  coming; the wild visions before my eyes, the fiery weight upon my brain. They
  all know it here; my keeper knows the signs and he is coming. Ah! they have
  taken my paper away from me, and now my pen. No matter, I have finished.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-18"
     id="ch-18"></a>18.&mdash;AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIALIST</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Dec 1902<br>
  Illustrated by T. Walter Wilson, R.I.</h3>

  <p class="first">It was just becoming a debatable question with Francis
  Hadley, Marquis of Hetherdean, whether, after all, life was worth living. In
  his present mood, if he had been called upon to give a definite decision with
  regard to this problem, he would probably have decided in the negative,
  although if he had been compelled to give also his reasons for such a
  decision, he would certainly have been at a loss to do so. Doubtless he would
  have muttered something about London being so beastly slow about this time of
  the year, and indulged in a mild oath at the post which had sent him up from
  Melton. But as a matter of fact it was neither the loss of his hunting nor
  his non-interest in town life which was at the bottom of his lordship's
  discontent with things in general. They might perhaps have had something to
  do with it, for he was a young man of no very pronounced tastes, who was
  accustomed to rely for his diversions almost entirely upon the usual season's
  pursuits, and the sudden stoppage of his favourite sport was certainly
  annoying. He had had quite enough tramping over wet moors in the drizzling
  rain, with a gun under his arm which he was seldom called upon to use, and
  the shortest tempered of Scotch keepers lagging wearily behind; nor could he
  find anything in town life to compensate him for his ejection from Melton,
  for he had not the slightest taste for dissipation in any form, and most of
  his friends had already shut up their town houses, and gone down into the
  country for Christmas. But, after all, these were not the chief reasons for
  his depressed state, although they were the only reasons which he would have
  cared to acknowledge. The fact of it was, that he was, or fancied that he
  was&mdash;which is very much the same thing&mdash;in love. There was nothing
  at all romantic about it. The young lady who had first attracted his notice,
  then his attention, and finally his heart (he was by no means the sort of
  young man to fall in love off-hand), was one of his own set, with whom an
  alliance would have been most proper and desirable. But there was one
  trifling difficulty in the way. Incredible though it may seem, Lord Hadley
  had an uneasy but distinct consciousness that the young lady in question,
  although she did not positively discourage his advances, seemed scarcely to
  appreciate them at their full value. He could not understand it at all. He
  had been so angled for and spoilt during the five years which had elapsed
  since he had attained his majority, that there was certainly some excuse for
  his perplexity. He was young, moderately good-looking, moderately rich. What
  more could she want! And yet on two separate occasions, when he had been on
  the very brink of a proposal, she had actually avoided it.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Now in his perplexity Lord Hadley had done a very unwise thing. He had
  been unwilling to abandon the idea of making Flora Saville Countess of
  Hetherdean, but on the other hand he could not bring himself to face the
  possibilities of a rejection, and so he had laid the matter before her
  mother, Mrs. Saville, and there, at any rate, his suit had not been coldly
  received. Mrs. Saville had instantly declared herself his warm ally, and the
  letter which he was studying over his post matutinal cigar with so much
  interest was in her dear, bold handwriting. It ran thus:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"'BATH HOTEL,' BOURNEMOUTH,<br>
  <br>
  "December 21, 18&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  "MY DEAR LORD HADLEY (he had winced a little more than once at the 'My dear.'
  It seemed so very mother-in-lawish)&mdash;we are leaving here this afternoon
  for Bradgate Park, and I am writing you a few lines to remind you of your
  promise to spend Christmas there. We are all very well, and you will be glad
  to hear (underlined) that dear Flora's cold has quite disappeared. I think
  that I may venture to give you a little good news with regard to&mdash;a
  certain matter. I have sometimes feared that the dear child&mdash;very silly
  of her&mdash;thought a little too much of Mr. Reid, who certainly has been
  very attentive to her. Well, we have just received a letter from him
  regretting that some unforeseen circumstance will prevent his spending
  Christmas with us. I can see that Flora is very much annoyed at this, and I
  really am afraid that there was some kind of secret understanding between
  them which, had they met at Christmas, might have led to most regrettable
  results. As it is, all will be well, I think, for she is evidently much
  puzzled about Mr. Reid putting off his visit, and asked me this morning
  whether I was certain that you were coming to us. You will, I am sure, let
  nothing prevent your paying us this visit, as the opportunity is not one to
  be lost if you are still in the same mind as when we last met. I shall
  confidently expect you then on the 24th, at Bradgate Park, and will send to
  meet the 3.30 from St. Pancras.<br>
  <br>
  "With kindest regards, believe me, my dear Lord Hadley,<br>
  <br>
  "Yours very sincerely,<br>
  "ELEANOR SAVILLE."</p><br>

  <p>Lord Hadley, having carefully studied this epistle for nearly a quarter of
  an hour, consigned it at last to the pocket of his dressing-gown, and pulled
  away savagely at his cigar. He had his own reasons for believing that Neil
  Reid, whom he had himself introduced to the Savilles, and who, being one of
  his closest friends, was a somewhat formidable rival, and he scarcely felt
  inclined to share Mrs. Saville's sanguine views as to his chances with her
  daughter. Reid was certainly poor, but then his family and connexions were
  unexceptional, and he was undeniably clever in a quasi-literary sort of way.
  Besides, money would not be so much an object, for Flora was herself an
  heiress, and, being an only child and spoilt, would certainly have her own
  way. Altogether, things looked very bad indeed, and dim ideas of the Rocky
  mountains and a prolonged Eastern tour were floating in Lord Hadley's mind as
  he lounged in his easy chair with his hands thrust deep into his pockets, and
  stared fixedly into the bright fire.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door, and the servant announced, "Mr. Neil
  Reid."</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley started to his feet with a muttered exclamation, which was
  certainly not a blessing upon the gentleman in question, and then turned
  round to receive his visitor.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Reid? Haven't seen you for an age. Just tilt those papers on
  the floor, will you, and take a seat. Breakfast or a weed?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Neil Reid, a tall, very good-looking young man, accepted a cigar, and
  seated himself in a low chair opposite his host. "Rattling good smokes," he
  remarked appreciatively. "Boonter's?</p>

  <p>"No. Got 'em at old Perry's in Bond Street. Thought you were in Paris,
  writing those letters for the <i>Observer</i>. When did you come across?"</p>

  <p>"Last Wednesday; found I could write them just as well from London, and
  besides, it's an infernal nuisance, but I've got to turn up at home at
  Christmas. Can't think what's possessed the governor, and he simply insists
  upon my being there to join in the festivities. I hate all that tomfoolery,
  but go I must. Can't afford to offend the old boy."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Saville's information was correct then. Lord Hadley felt a little
  better.</p>

  <p>"Those sort of Christmas rejoicings are sometimes very good fun," he
  remarked consolingly. "I rather like an old-fash&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I tell you what, old man," interrupted the other eagerly. "You come
  down with me. My people will be delighted to see you, and we can find
  something to do. They always leave a cover or two till Christmas,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thanks awfully, but I've promised to spend Christmas with the Savilles,
  at the place they've taken in Leicestershire. Can't get out of it now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Neil Reid's face fell considerably, and he bit his moustache.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear it," he said gloomily. "Look here, Hadley," he went on,
  "we're old friends, and you won't mind my speaking out, I'm sure. I have an
  idea we're running against one another in this matter. I don't know whether
  you're in earnest, but I tell you frankly&mdash;I am. Let's have it out. Are
  we rivals?"</p>

  <p>"Presuming that you refer to Miss Saville," Lord Hadley said a little
  stiffly, "we are. I intend to ask her to be my wife."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence for several minutes, which Mr. Neil Reid was the
  first to break.</p>

  <p>"Very well then, Hadley, let it be a fair fight between us. There's just
  one favour I should like to ask you. Miss Saville will doubtless be a little
  annoyed with me for throwing them over this Christmas, though, hang it all, I
  can't help it. You won't take advantage of that, will you? I mean to say,
  you'll not steal a march on me by proposing until I've seen her and explained
  matters. That's only fair."</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley leaned back in his chair and laughed silently.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Reid, isn't that going a little too far? To make use of a
  very hackneyed quotation, all's fair in love and war,' you know. Between
  ourselves, you've exactly indicated what I propose doing."</p>

  <p>Neil Reid rose to his feet with an angry exclamation, and caught up his
  hat as if about to go, but evidently thought better of it, and resumed his
  seat.</p>

  <p>"It's not the slightest use quarrelling about this little matter, Reid,"
  his lordship remarked affably. "Come, let's drop it now; it's a fair field
  and let the best man win. Now let's talk of something else. What are you
  going to do to-day? Can't we do something together? I never was so miserably
  bored in all my life."</p>

  <p>Mr. Neil Reid, who had his own reasons for not wishing to quarrel with his
  rival, took out a small memorandum book and leisurely consulted it.</p>

  <p>"H'm! seems I'm pretty well full up," he remarked thoughtfully. "I've
  promised to try and get in Trafalgar Square, this morning, and report for the
  <i>Observer</i>. Then, if I can get away in time, I ought to lunch at Belton
  House, and take my cousins to a matinée somewhere Kensington way, and I'm
  going to dine with the Caringtons, and shall look in at Mrs. Pychley-Carr's
  dance, of course."</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley threw the end of his cigar into the air and looked
  vicious.</p>

  <p>"Hope you'll enjoy yourself! For my part I hate matinées, especially
  musical ones, like poison, and I can't endure dancing attendance on a lot of
  women like a tame puppy dog; no offence to you, Reid. The Caringtons haven't
  asked me to dine, and if they had, I shouldn't go. I hate their slow, solemn
  dinners! Lord's is shut up; so's Hurlingham. I'm sick of the sight of
  Tattersall's, and I haven't got any pretty cousins to go and lunch with. What
  on earth is there for a man to do?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me to Trafalgar Square, and see these socialists," Mr. Reid
  answered promptly. "That'll be a novelty for you, at any rate."</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley's thin lip curled, and his face assumed an expression of most
  patrician contempt.</p>

  <p>"Go amongst that lot of beer-swilling, ranting lunatics! Not I. If I went,
  I should tell them what I thought of their folly."</p>

  <p>"That's a little more than even you dare do," remarked Mr. Neil Reid
  quietly.</p>

  <p>These words had precisely the effect which the speaker had intended them
  to have. Lord Hadley looked up quickly with a frowning face.</p>

  <p>"Dare! I like that! Look here, Reid, if you'll engage to procure me the
  opportunity&mdash;you're in with all these socialist cads, aren't
  you?&mdash;I'll bet you a hundred pounds that I do make a speech! There!"</p>

  <p>"Done! I'll find you the opportunity this very morning. You must take the
  risk of it on your own shoulders, though. I warn you that these fellows,
  contemptible though you may think them, won't stand any trifling with."</p>

  <p>"Very well, I'm not afraid of them. They won't know who I am. Oblige me by
  touching the bell, will you, Reid? Thanks."</p>

  <p>His lordship's own man answered the summons.</p>

  <p>"Burditt, have you got any very old clothes?" his master inquired
  gravely.</p>

  <p>Burditt belonged to that class of highly-trained servants to whom surprise
  and suchlike emotions are strangers.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I have, my lord," he replied, after a moment's
  deliberation. "Not very old."</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose you had. Now listen to me. I want you to take a hansom
  at once, and find out a ready-made clothes shop&mdash;second-hand, if
  possible&mdash;and buy a pair of corduroy trousers, a flannel shirt, a rough
  coat and waistcoat, and a red cotton handkerchief. Mind you don't forget the
  handkerchief! Shall we say two rig-outs?" he inquired, turning to his friend,
  "or do you prefer going as you are?"</p>

  <p>"As I am, by all means," answered Mr. Neil Reid, with a short laugh,
  glancing at his irreproachable attire. "I don't mind going amongst these
  people to hear what they've got to say, but I'm hanged if I care about
  imitating their style of dress."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, be off with you, Burditt, and look sharp. You going too,
  Reid? Stop a bit, where shall I see you?</p>

  <p>"Top of Oxford Street, in an hour's time, and you'd better have your
  cheque-book with you," Neil Reid answered, laughing. "On second thoughts,
  though, I think you'd better leave it at home. You'll most certainly be
  mobbed if you begin to air your aristocratic notions. Better pay
  forfeit."</p>

  <p>There was the slightest possible inflection of a sneer in his tone, and it
  had the desired effect. Lord Hadley would as likely as not have thought
  better of it, and have paid the money, but for the other's words. As it was
  he drew himself up steadily, almost haughtily, and looked at his friend.</p>

  <p>"I think not; if you carry out your part of the programme, I will
  mine.'</p>

  <p>"And if you do," muttered Mr. Neil Reid, as he stepped into a stray
  hansom, "it won't be my fault it you don't spend Christmas at Bradgate Park.
  What was it he said to me, 'all's fair in love and war'? Ah well, Hadley, I
  can make use of that hackneyed quotation as well as you. Socialist's Club,
  Camberwell Road, cabby, and look sharp."</p>
  <hr>

  <p>At one o'clock that morning Trafalgar Square was filled to overflowing
  with a heterogeneous mob of excited people, some loungers and street
  vagabonds, a sprinkling of even worse characters, and a minority of the
  genuine unemployed, desperate with real need, and eagerly listening for the
  advice of those in whom, wisely or unwisely, they had put their trust.
  Chiefly they flocked together round a brewer's dray, on which stood several
  of those who were to address them; amongst whom, standing slightly in the
  background, was a tall, slight man, in the garb of a coal-heaver with a red
  cotton handkerchief around his neck, and an expression of intense interest in
  his well-cut, shapely features. The meeting had commenced without
  interruption, and in many different parts of the Square the speakers were
  already haranguing the crowd from hastily extemporized platforms. Suddenly
  there was a cry of warning, and a large body of police were seen making
  desperate attempts to reach the ringleaders. That they would not be able to
  do this very soon became evident, for the people were wedged together so
  closely that they formed a quite impenetrable mass, and after a short
  struggle the police gave it up, and, amidst howls of derision, withdrew to
  await reinforcements. The speaker for the nonce, however, on the principal
  platform, had taken alarm and vanished, and for a moment or two no one came
  forward. Then just as the people were beginning to get impatient, the man
  with the red-cotton handkerchief round his neck came boldly to the front, and
  turning towards the crowd commenced to address them. His views seemed
  popular, for at every sentence they cheered him vehemently. Higher and higher
  grew their enthusiasm, as his speech progressed, and cheer after cheer rent
  the air as his manner became more earnest, and his words flowed more volubly.
  One man alone, standing near the platform, in a long dark ulster and with a
  reporter's note-book, seemed to find little that was pleasant in the
  speaker's words, for he was standing motionless, making no attempt to write,
  even staring at the man on the platform with a curious expression of
  bewildered dismay, together with not a little disappointment. Perhaps Mr.
  Neil Reid had never in his life before experienced such a shock of
  overpowering surprise.</p>

  <p>Suddenly in the midst of a very storm of applause there was a hush and a
  cry of warning. The police, heavily reinforced, had succeeded in getting
  inside the circle and were making for the platform. The orator leaped down,
  the crowd opened their ranks to receive him, and he passed like magic through
  the dense throng, and was lost to the struggling myrmidons of the law.</p>

  <p>That evening Lord Hadley sat down to his dinner with a hearty appetite and
  in high good humour, rare events with him latterly. With dessert was brought
  in the evening paper, and presently he carelessly shook it open, and began to
  glance through its contents. He had not gone far before he started and
  uttered a quick exclamation, which considerably shocked the old servant who
  stood behind his chair. There was some little excuse for him, though, for
  almost the first column his eye fell upon was headed by his own name in large
  type. He put down his glass, which he had been in the act of raising to his
  lips, and eagerly read through the paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="headline">"GREAT MEETING OF THE UNEMPLOYED IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE<br>
  <i>Gallant Escapade of the Marquis of Hetherdean</i><br>
  A Riot Avoided.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">The expected mass meeting of the unemployed was held
  this afternoon in Trafalgar Square, in defiance of the police regulations,
  and it appears quite certain that a most disastrous riot was only prevented
  by the gallant conduct of a young English nobleman, Francis Hadley, Marquis
  of Hetherdean. From an early hour in the morning the Square was partly filled
  with a disreputable mob of loafers and vagabonds, who had assembled to take
  part in the afternoon's demonstration, and at no time could the police,
  although in great force, keep the people moving. Towards one o'clock the
  ingoing stream steadily increased, and an hour later a dense throng
  completely held the Square. Several speeches of a highly inflammatory nature
  were delivered, despite the desperate efforts of the police to reach the
  platform, and matters were in a very critical state, when the Marquis of
  Hetherdean, who, being disguised as a working man, was not generally known,
  mounted the platform and expostulated with great effect. Unfortunately, no
  reporters succeeded in reaching the vicinity of the platform, but we
  understand his lordship, in a speech of some ten minutes' duration, exposed
  in a most masterly fashion the dangerous errors and falsities of socialist
  doctrines generally, and implored the people to disperse without any
  disturbance. The arguments of the orator were, strange to say, most
  favourably received, and, together with the arrival of a large body of
  police, were, without doubt, instrumental in preventing a repetition of the
  last deplorable riots, a contingency which at one time appeared imminent.
  There is no man in England that should feel more proud to-night than the
  gallant young nobleman whose heroic, though somewhat quixotic, action has
  spared a great city from the disgrace of another street riot. We trust that
  Lord Hadley, now that he has broken the ice, will take an active part in
  political life, and will give us the opportunity of hearing again that
  eloquence, of which he must undoubtedly be possessed, in the House of Lords,
  where such a gift is sadly wanted."</p><br>

  <p>Lord Hadley leaned back in his chair in a state of mind bordering upon
  stupefaction. Before he had had time to recover himself, there was a knock at
  the door, and his servant put a letter into his hand, with the remark that it
  had just arrived by special messenger. He tore it open, and glanced through
  it. It was from the Home Secretary, and alluded in highly complimentary terms
  to his "gallant behaviour and patriotism," in Trafalgar Square, and concluded
  by thanking him heartily, officially and personally, for his heroic
  action.</p>

  <p>The Marquis of Hetherdean took a long breath, and poured himself out a
  glass of wine. Scarcely had he set the glass down when Mr. Neil Reid was
  announced.</p>

  <p>"My most sincere congratulations," the newcomer remarked drily, as he laid
  a cheque upon the table. "I had no idea that you were a rank socialist at
  heart, Lord Hadley, or I might have hesitated before I framed that bet. Let
  me congratulate you on your opinions, your oratory, and your good
  fortune."</p>

  <p>It struck Lord Hadley that something more than the loss of an ordinary bet
  was the matter with his friend and rival.</p>

  <p>His eyes were burning with suppressed excitement, and he seemed as though
  he could control his temper only by a strong effort. He was still in morning
  dress, and there was a dishevelled appearance about him altogether, just as
  though he had been drinking. Lord Hadley took in these details and answered
  coolly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Much obliged, Reid. It's certainly just as well that the newspapers
  didn't get hold of really what I did say."</p>

  <p>"Ay, it is," Reid assented with a short unpleasant laugh. "The world would
  be surprised to hear that your lordship thought all differences is rank
  humbug, believed in an equal distribution of wealth, and the establishment of
  a republic. What if I tell them?"</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley shrugged his shoulders, and looked perfectly indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Hadley," exclaimed Reid savagely, "I'll make a bargain with
  you: give up spending Christmas at Bradgate, and leave Flora Saville with
  me&mdash;I want her money&mdash;and I'll do nothing. But unless you make me
  that promise, by G&mdash; you shall repent it. I'll reproduce that brilliant
  speech of yours, and publish it everywhere; and more than that, I'll set the
  people on you for a hypocrite, and if I'm cut off with a shilling, I'll go to
  Bradgate Park for Christmas, and spoil your game with Flora Saville!
  Decide!"</p>

  <p>"I have already decided," said Lord Hadley quietly, "that if you are not
  out of my house in two minutes, I shall throw you out. I have always had my
  doubts about you, and now I know that you are a cad."</p>

  <p>Neil Reid hesitated for a moment, pale and shaking with rage. Then he
  turned on his heel with an evil smile and left the room.</p>

  <p>He had scarcely gone before another visitor was announced&mdash;George
  Ellingcombe, Lord Hadley's cousin, and his close t friend.</p>

  <p>"My dear Hadley," exclaimed the newcomer, as he established himself in an
  easy chair, "why didn't you take me with you this morning? I might have come
  in for a little reflected glory, at any rate. 'Pon my word I never dreamt
  that you were a philanthropist, or anything of that sort. Why, all London is
  talking about you. Lucky devil!"</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley took another glass of wine, and then astonished his cousin by
  throwing himself back in an easy chair and subsiding into a perfect fit of
  laughter. Then he sat up and wiped his eyes.</p>

  <p>"George," he said feebly, "this'll be the death of me. Swear by everything
  that's holy that you'll keep it dark."</p>

  <p>"I swear by these cigars," he remarked with mock solemnity; "proceed."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, it's all a grand sell. They've got hold of the wrong end of
  the stick, somehow. You see, Neil Reid bet me a hundred pounds I wouldn't
  make a speech to those fellows. Well, I made up my mind I would, and you know
  I'm rather obstinate. He got me on the platform, and I'm pretty sure now that
  he meant to get me mobbed. However, as I didn't see the fun of that, when my
  turn came to speak I just pitched it stronger than any of them&mdash;made an
  out-and-out socialist speech. I really did feel sorry for the poor devils,
  and it's very easy when once you've made a start. You should have heard the
  cheer! And you should just have seen Reid's face Of course he'd taken care to
  let them know who I was, hoping to make it all the hotter for me, and it all
  cut the other way, when they'd heard what I'd got to say. If there had been a
  reporter, I should have been done. I had to cut for it, I can tell you, to
  avoid being taken, but the people opened for me, and helped me on like
  bricks. I nearly tumbled off my chair just now, when I saw that paragraph in
  the <i>Globe</i>, and directly afterwards had a pompous epistle from old
  Matthews."</p>

  <p>The Hon. George Ellingcombe listened to his cousin's recital with
  open-mouthed amazement. Then he broke into a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"By Jove Hadley, you're a lucky fellow, and no mistake," he exclaimed
  vigorously. "You should just hear how people are talking about you. I don't
  remember such a sensation since Fred Castleton went off with the Countess.
  And only to think that&mdash;oh, it's too absurd! I'll keep your secret, I
  promise you. Can't stop a moment longer, the mater's waiting for me. Come
  down to the club to-night and be lionized."</p>

  <p>Later on in the evening, Lord Hadley did look in at the club, and was
  instantly beset with a shower of congratulations and chaff, all of which he
  received with becoming gravity and modesty. On his return home, however, he
  indulged in another prolonged fit of merriment, greatly to the mystification
  of the astonished Burditt, who began to have Faye doubts as to his master's
  sanity. But Burditt v as destined to find still greater cause for
  astonishment shortly.</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley slept soundly that night, but towards morning he awoke
  suddenly to find Burditt by his bedside with a scared face, and a curious
  rumbling sound in the street below.</p>

  <p>"What on earth's the matter?" he exclaimed, sitting up and listening.</p>

  <p>"Matter!! my lord, matter enough! Why we shall have the house about our
  ears in a minute," replied the trembling servant. "There's the biggest crowd
  of roughs I ever saw in my life blocking up the whole street, and calling for
  your lordship. There they are again!" and a deafening roar from many thousand
  throats seemed almost to shake the house.</p>

  <p>"Hetherdean! Hetherdean! A speech! A speech! Cum out!"</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley listened with a sudden realization of his awful dilemma. Then
  he sprang out of bed, and commenced hastily to dress himself.</p>

  <p><a id="pic17"
     name="pic17"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Quick I my trousers and waistcoat, Burditt. Don't stand there like a
  fool! This is serious! Now listen to me. Don't get sending for the police, or
  bolting the doors. Get the women-servants out of the house by the back door,
  and take the plate into the cellar. First of all, open the window. That'll
  do."</p>

  <p>A mighty roar greeted Lord Hadley's appearance on the balcony&mdash;a roar
  half of applause, half of menace; and as it died away other cries arose.</p>

  <p>"A speech! a speech!" "Come and contradict the newspapers." "Hurrah for
  Hetherdean and a republic!" "Cum and let's hear what yer got to say!"</p>

  <p>Lord Hadley cleared his throat, and stood facing the people, smiling, and
  apparently quite at his ease, until the clamour had subsided. Suddenly his
  eye met Neil Reid's, who was standing with one or two professional reporters
  right to the front. There was a triumphant look on the latter's upturned
  face, but Lord Hadley met it steadily and without flinching, without even
  abating his pleasant smile.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he exclaimed, in clear, ringing tones, as soon as there was
  comparative silence, "you have taken me by surprise, but I am glad to see
  you. You say you want a speech. Well, I thought I'd spoken to you pretty
  plainly yesterday, but you shall have it all over again, if you want it. I
  tell you what I'd rather do, though; I'd rather stand you a breakfast. You
  look hungry, some of you, and it's a cold morning."</p>

  <p>There was a howl of frenzied applause front many hundreds of starving
  throats. One man only persisted in calling for a speech, and he was
  immediately hustled and jolted by a furious crowd.</p>

  <p>"There are too many of you to come in here, I'm afraid," Lord Hadley
  continued. "We must manage it another way. I will come down, and go round to
  some of these coffee-houses with you. We&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A deafening roar of applause. One man alone refused to join in it, and in
  less than a moment he was hustled off his feet, trodden upon, spat at,
  kicked, his clothes torn, and his face smeared with dirt and blood. Then they
  left him alone, at the stern command of the man who was going to give them
  food. One of them indeed was merciful enough to lift him up and prop him
  against a railing before they hurried after their fellows. There he remained
  until a policeman put him in a cab and had him taken, more dead than alive,
  to his chambers.</p>

  <p>That was a strange crowd which trudged along after Lord Hadley through the
  early morning streets. Eager-looking women with children running by their
  sides, or clasped in their arms; gaunt, hollow-eyed men, with a wolfish glare
  in their eyes; rogues, vagabonds, the scum of the earth. And yet, as at each
  coffee-house they came to (after a brief interview with the proprietor,
  during which they waited quietly outside) Lord Hadley passed some of them in,
  and told them that they were free to eat as much as they would, and there was
  not one who failed to thank him with trembling, eager voices. And somehow,
  when it was all over, and, tired out, he found himself free to return to the
  house, the memory of those starving, grateful voices seemed to him like the
  memory of the sweetest music he had ever heard. It had all been a trick to
  get himself out of an awkward scrape, to get rid of them; but he felt that
  out of folly good had come. He had been bored, sated with pleasure-seeking,
  and had sought, in a mad adventure, for a new sensation. By chance he had
  gained it, and it remained with him. It led him on in the future to plead in
  the House of Lords for the people, as very few peers had ever done. It led
  him on to the prosecution of great schemes, to the accomplishment of many
  designs of practical philanthropy. It won for him a name adored by those for
  whom he toiled, respected and admired by the whole nation; and it won for him
  a wife whose name is written side by side with his in the hearts of the
  toilers and workers of the great city in which they live. He has had a long
  life and a happy one, but never happier, he says, than when Flora Saville and
  he walked home hand-in-hand through the leafless trees of Bradgate Park, on
  the day after his first good deed, and she had whispered the word which most
  of all others he longed to hear.</p>

  <p class="first">wo men sat smoking their after-dinner cigars in the long,
  low dining-room of Houghton Grange, in most masculine silence&mdash;a
  silence, however, which proceeded in each case from a very different cause.
  The elder of the two&mdash;the master of Houghton Grange, a man of about
  thirty-five years of age, was lounging comfortably before the fire,
  complacently enjoying his cabana, and his silence was the silence of
  repletion and satisfaction with things in general. It was easy to see that
  neither his digestion nor his worldly affairs were out of gear. His guest,
  however, who appeared to be a much younger man, did not bear in his face the
  signs of a like complacency. He still remained seated at the table, and, with
  his head resting in his hands and a moody frown on his brow, was apparently
  engaged in studying the pattern of the table-cloth. He was the first to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"Is there any chance of Miss Smith being at Lady Malvern's to-night?" he
  inquired suddenly, as if the idea had only just occurred to him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Coulson, his host, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not the ghost of a chance, my dear fellow. The county people don't even
  tolerate old Smith; he's such a beastly cad."</p>

  <p>"No bad language about my future father-in-law, please," said the young
  man, with a grim smile.</p>

  <p>"Future father-in-law! What rubbish! Why, you've never spoken a word to
  the girl in your life, and never saw her before this morning. You're a pretty
  cool hand, I must say, Escott, if you're not joking."</p>

  <p>"I was never more serious in my life," declared the other doggedly. "I
  don't care a fig what her father's like. I've fallen in love with the girl,
  and I'll swear she's a lady; and, what's more, I'm going to marry her!"</p>

  <p>His friend turned round and stared at him, in half-amused, half-vexed
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What nonsense you talk, Dick!" he said. "Marry her on nothing a year, and
  something pretty considerable to the bad in the shape of a cartload of debts!
  I don't suppose your pay more than pays the interest of them. You must be mad
  to talk about marrying!"</p>

  <p>"Her father is a Croesus. He can give the girl money."</p>

  <p>"He can, but he won't if you're the husband. You'd better get rid of that
  idea as soon as possible. Old Smith is different from most of the retired
  City cads. He don't care a fig for society or the aristocracy. Snap his
  fingers at us, and says' he ain't going to have any fine gentleman dangling
  after his daughter's money-bags.' He means to marry her to a man named Gryce,
  who took his business in the City. I've heard him say so myself. If she
  married you, he'd simply cut her off with a shilling. And, besides, you're
  not likely to meet her, old chap. You won't see anything of them in our set,
  and she doesn't look the sort of girl you'd scrape acquaintance with
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>Captain Escott smiled. A boyish-looking face his, but wonderfully
  handsome. Women had done their best to spoil him by praising his clear-cut
  features, his blue eyes and smooth skin; but he had survived the spoiling,
  and was at heart what every man called him&mdash;a thoroughly good
  fellow.</p>

  <p>"I don't often make up my mind about anything, Coulson," he said
  deliberately, "but I have done this time. I daresay you think I'm in a pretty
  mess to start love-making. Heigho! I don't care. Duns and writs may go to the
  d&mdash;l; worrying about them won't pay them will it? and I must get to know
  that girl."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wish you luck," said his friend, rising. "If you're quite sure
  that you won't come to Lady Malvern's&mdash;they're awfully hard up for men,
  and would be charmed to see you&mdash;I must go, for the brougham's round,
  and my wife hates being kept waiting. I'll come round to your room and smoke
  a cigar with you when I get back, if you like.'</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;do."</p>

  <p>About two o'clock in the morning Mr. Coulson returned from Lady Malvern's
  dance, and exchanging his dress-coat for a shooting-jacket, made his way into
  his guest's room.</p>

  <p>Captain Escott welcomed him with a nod, and kicked a chair towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Had a good dance?"</p>

  <p>"Very fair. Dances are not much in my line now, though," replied Mr.
  Coulson, dropping into the chair and carefully selecting a cigar from the
  open box on the table. "Astonishing how differently you regard these sort of
  things when you're a married man, Dick, my boy. What have you been doing with
  yourself all the evening?"</p>

  <p>"I've been to Saddington Hall&mdash;to Smith's," said Captain Escott
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Been to the d&mdash;&mdash;l!" exclaimed Mr. Coulson incredulously.
  "Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly true. I recognized Miss Smith's man this morning at the
  meet. He used to be head-groom at The Towers, so I thought I should like to
  look him up, you know, and have a chat about home."</p>

  <p>Mr. Coulson laughed. "Well, you didn't see your divinity, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Captain Escott took a long draw at his cigar.</p>

  <p>"No, I did not see Miss Smith," he assented. "After my interview with
  Burditt, I took particular good care to keep out of the way. I found out
  something rather interesting about her, though."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Is she engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I'm aware of. But she inherits three thousand pounds a year from
  her mother, independent of old Smith. I found that out. He's kept it from
  her, and Burditt only came to know of it by accident, through having a nephew
  in Somerset House. Of course she's bound to know when she comes of age next
  month; so I haven't much time to lose. I must be engaged to her before
  then."</p>

  <p>Mr. Coulson's interest in his friend's infatuation increased wonderfully
  when he had digested this piece of news.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be at all a bad thing for you, Dick, my boy," he
  acknowledged; "you must marry money, and soon. But how the deuce are we to
  get at these Smiths? The old man is a Tartar, and the girl isn't the sort you
  could scrape an acquaintance with unceremoniously in the hunting-field. I
  ought to be able to help you here, but I can't. You see, my wife never dreamt
  of calling. I'd have made her if I'd known about this before; but it's too
  late now."</p>

  <p>"I've laid my own plans, thank you," said Captain Escott quietly. "Now
  listen to me carefully. There isn't the slightest chance of getting even an
  introduction by ordinary means, so I'm going to try extraordinary ones. Old
  Smith wants a groom. I intend&mdash;in fact, I've already made sure of the
  situation. You needn't look at me like that; I'm quite serious. I don't know
  any of your friends yet, thank goodness, and I don't know a soul in this part
  of the country; so I shall be perfectly safe. Burditt is in the secret, and
  is red-hot for me. Everything's arranged. I'm to have a little cottage to
  myself away from the stables. All I want from you is a character."</p>

  <p>Mr. Coulson dropped his cigar and looked at his friend aghast.</p>

  <p>"You're joking, Escott!"</p>

  <p>"I was never more serious in my life."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but I don't see what good this mad freak of yours will do, even
  if you carry it out. If your divinity is anything like what she appears to
  be, she isn't the sort of girl to let her groom make love to her."</p>

  <p>Captain Dick smiled. "You leave Miss Smith alone, and give me that
  character."'</p>

  <p>Mr. Coulson suddenly took in the humour of the situation, and burst into a
  roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Well, here goes," he said, moving to the table; "you've got some paper
  ready for me, I see. What am I to say?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to say anything that isn't true. Just write that you've
  known Richard Escott for&mdash;let's see, what year were we at Eton together?
  Say, ten years."</p>

  <p>"Yes; well?"</p>

  <p>"And can certify that he is honest, sober&mdash;" Mr. Coulson flung down
  his pen and burst out laughing again.</p>

  <p>"Hang it all! Dick; I can't say that, you know. How about that night at
  the club when you floured the waiter and put old&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Honest, sober, and trustworthy. Go on, and don't be a fool!" interrupted
  Dick.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well, you know," protested Mr. Coulson, taking up his pen
  again. "Well, I've put it. Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"You'd better say that I can ride."</p>

  <p>"That's about the truest part of the character," remarked Mr. Coulson.
  "I'll put that in with pleasure."</p>

  <p>"That'll do. Hand it over. You see that parcel in the corner? Well, that's
  a suit of livery, and I'm going to put it on and clear from here at five
  o'clock. You'll be so good as to make my excuses to your wife, and let the
  servants think that I've been obliged to run up to town by the early morning
  train. And just have my traps put together and sent to Burditt at Saddington
  Hall by some one whom you can trust."</p>

  <p>"All right, old man&mdash;and good luck."</p>

  <p>The new groom was duly installed at Saddington Hall, and gave great
  satisfaction. Fortune favours the rash sometimes, and it favoured Dick Escott
  in this mad escapade. On the first evening of his arrival Miss Smith's
  favourite hunter, Lizette, had a fit in the stable. A veterinary from
  Harborough pronounced the case hopeless, and word was sent in to Miss Smith
  that her favourite must be shot. She spent a miserable evening and a
  sleepless night, fretting; but early in the morning her maid knocked at her
  door with some joyful news. Burditt had sent in word that Lizette was better,
  and would she come to the stables? In half an hour her arm was round
  Lizette's neck.</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"She'll do now," remarked Burditt, with considerable satisfaction. "Muster
  Hamson, the veterinary, he was for shooting her last night; but the new
  groom, who had just turned up opportune, like a rare nice young chap he is,
  he laughed at 'im, and got some drugs from the village to make a mash, and
  sat up all night a-giving them to her. I never see'd any one take to a 'oss
  so. He sat all the mortal night with her head in his lap, and he's just
  brought her round again&mdash;that's what he's done."</p>

  <p>Miss Smith jumped up with a radiant smile.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" she asked, "and what's his name? I shall go straight and
  thank him."</p>

  <p>"He's got t' old cottage Miles used to have, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Smith was already gone, and Burditt gave vent to a delightful
  chuckle.</p>

  <p>That visit very nearly spoilt the whole game. Dick had taken off his
  groom's coat and donned a shooting-jacket, and when Miss Smith lifted the
  latch and entered the cottage he was lolling in an easy chair with a cigar in
  his mouth and something suspiciously like a brandy and seltzer by his side.
  Neither his position nor his immediate surroundings were exactly in accord
  with his new calling.</p>

  <p>He was astonished, but was equal to the occasion. In a moment the cigar
  was pitched into the grate, the <i>Sporting Life</i> fell over a silver
  cigar-case, and a clumsy salutation took the place of the bow and courteous
  inquiry which had almost escaped him.</p>

  <p>Miss Smith&mdash;a tall, handsome girl&mdash;stood with her hand on the
  latch, and looked at him with a gracious smile.</p>

  <p>"You are the new groom, I believe&mdash;Escott? I have come to thank you
  very much for your kindness to my poor Lizette. Burditt tells me that you
  saved her life."</p>

  <p>Dick had quite recovered himself by this time.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad to have been of any use, miss," he said quietly. "It would
  have been such a pity if she'd been shot, a fine animal like that, and such a
  favourite of yours, too, they tell me."</p>

  <p>"I am very fond of her. Are you married, Escott?" she continued, glancing
  round the room. "I am not, miss."</p>

  <p>"Then who looks after you?" It appeared to her that the new groom was a
  man of taste.</p>

  <p>He laughed, and made a slip&mdash;the first.</p>

  <p>"I am no sybarite, and I need very little looking after. I cook my meals
  there, miss," he continued, pointing to a gas-stove. "Mrs. Burditt does the
  cleaning for me and such little things as I don't understand. I've roughed it
  worse than this when I was a youngster in Zululand."</p>

  <p>She stared at him curiously. He was a novelty in the way of grooms.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well. Thank you once more, Escott, for nursing Lizette so nicely for
  me. Good-morning."</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, miss;" and he sprang forward and opened the door for
  her.</p>

  <p>Later on in the morning Burditt sought his young mistress with a request.
  The rheumatics were troubling him, and Prince Charles was fractious, and took
  a lot of holding at the gate. Might the new groom attend her to the
  meets?</p>

  <p>Miss Smith had not the slightest objection.</p>

  <p>"Where did he come from, this new groom?" she asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>Burditt heaved a sigh, the old humbug!</p>

  <p>"Well, miss, I'm afraid he's had a lot of trouble, that young
  gentleman&mdash;come down in the world, you know. He came here with a
  splendid character from Mr. Coulson, of Houghton Grange, but he ain't been a
  groom allus, I'll wager. It's my private belief, miss," he added
  confidentially, "that he was born a gentleman."</p>

  <p>Miss Smith laughed incredulously and walked away, but secretly she thought
  it not at all unlikely.</p>

  <p>Several days passed without event. The new groom turned out to be civil,
  intelligent, and respectful, and withal a magnificent horseman. Several
  tempting offers of service were made to him on the hunting-field, but these
  he steadily declined. His young mistress, feeling herself in somewhat of an
  anomalous position, bore herself at the meets in so independent a manner as
  to be universally considered proud; but her pride was merely reserve, and she
  was never above exchanging remarks with her groom whenever the exigencies of
  the run placed them side by side, and even occasionally on their way home.
  His ready and often amusing answers interested her, and generally, without
  her perceiving it, a conversation sprang up. He appeared to have travelled
  and seen much of life, and he told his young mistress much that it interested
  her to know. Then his opportune rescue of Lizette, who had now quite
  recovered, had won her gratitude and engendered a kindly interest in him,
  which Burditt's remark and his own bearing and conversation had
  increased.</p>

  <p>Yet, notwithstanding her favour, he never lost his head, and really
  displayed an admirable amount of tact. He never presumed too far, but kept
  forcing the limits of their conversation further and further away. If he
  feared having over-stepped the line, he was at once extra civil and
  respectful until her momentary uneasiness passed away. Thus it came to pass
  that their homeward rides were generally made side by side, and, although
  Miss Smith altogether failed to realize it, were by no means the least
  enjoyable part of the day to her. One morning she had a companion to the
  meet. Her proposed suitor from London&mdash;a vulgar, overdressed man,
  bearing in every movement and action the unmistakable impress of the City
  cad&mdash;was spending a few days at Saddington Hall. Captain Dick had
  scarcely reckoned upon him, and the fellow's vulgar compliments and leers as
  he rode by Miss Smith's side very nearly secured him a severe castigation
  from her groom, who rode behind, nearly boiling over with rage.</p>

  <p>There was one consolation, however&mdash;Miss Smith gave very evident
  signs of disgust at her forced companionship, and once, when during a short
  run he had been left a few fields behind, she made a slight detour and turned
  homewards, with the evident purpose of ridding herself of him. He detected
  the manoeuvre, however, and was by her side again in a moment.</p>

  <p>Dick muttered an oath, but a regretful glance from his young mistress,
  involuntary though it was, almost reconciled him.</p>

  <p>After all, the climax came that morning. A sudden storm overtook them on
  the way home, and Mr. Gryce and Miss Smith dismounted and entered a large
  barn. The latter beckoned her groom to follow suit.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hang it I there's no room for that fellow!" exclaimed Mr. Gryce
  roughly; "a wetting won't hurt him. Here, my man, here's half a crown for
  you. Go on to the village and wait for us. Don't get drunk, mind."</p>

  <p>Dick hesitated; then an appealing glance from his young mistress decided
  him. He rode up to Mr. Gryce, solemnly pocketed the half-crown, and, turning
  round, rode away. He did not go quite as far as the village, though; in fact,
  he remained within half a dozen yards of the barn, although unseen.</p>

  <p>Soon the sound of an angry voice and an oath reached him, and he drew
  nearer still.</p>

  <p>"By God! Miss Mabel, you shall marry me, whether you will or not; so you'd
  better make up your mind to it at once. Your father has promised, and he
  shall make you," exclaimed a thick passionate voice.</p>

  <p>"He will do nothing of the sort," was the firm reply. "Release my hand at
  once, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Never, until you give me a kiss and promise to marry me. Come."</p>

  <p>A scuffle, a shriek, and before he well realized what was happening Mr.
  Gryce felt himself lifted from his feet by a strong grasp and flung heavily
  to the ground. He looked up, and Miss Smith's groom was standing over him
  with a passionate fury in his keen blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"You hound! You dirty beast of a groom!" he spluttered out as he staggered
  to his feet. "I'll make you pay for this! How dare you lay your dirty hands
  on a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>The passion died out of Dick's eyes as he surveyed the mean-looking object
  who stood before him shaking with impotent rage, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>"A what?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gryce stamped his foot in a paroxysm of blind rage.</p>

  <p>"If you were only my equal," he burst out, "instead of a low blackguard of
  a groom&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should be very sorry to be your equal, Mr. Gryce," said Dick coolly. "I
  am a gentleman, however, and shall be happy to pass over our inequality and
  give you any satisfaction you desire. There is my card&mdash;Captain Escott,
  4th Dragoons&mdash;and a note to the Army and Navy Club, or care of my
  brother, Sir Herbert Escott, of Stretton Hall, Leicestershire, will be sure
  to find me. And now let me tell you this, sir, unless you mount that horse of
  yours and make yourself scarce in three minutes, I shall give you the sound,
  horsewhipping that you deserve. Be off."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gryce laughed a forced, uneasy laugh.</p>

  <p>"Gammon!" he exclaimed roughly, moving a pace or two towards his horse,
  however. "You don't suppose I believe that rubbish! Miss Smith, this groom of
  yours is drunk. Allow me to escort you home."</p>

  <p>She darted an indignant glance at him and moved a little further away.</p>

  <p>"If you presume to come near or even speak to me again," she exclaimed
  contemptuously, "I&mdash;I hope that he will horsewhip you."</p>

  <p>Dick clenched his whip firmly and his blue eyes flashed fire.</p>

  <p>"You hear that, sir," he said. "Be off!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gryce climbed into his saddle and rode away without another word.
  There was a silence. Then Miss Smith turned to her groom.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, sir, you will now be good enough to explain what this
  masquerading means," she said haughtily. But, in spite of her efforts, she
  could not altogether keep the gratitude from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I was about to do so," he said quietly, nerving himself for the crisis.
  "I am, as I told that cad, a captain in the 4th Dragoons and a gentleman. I
  am a sham groom. Let me confess how it has happened. I came down here to stop
  with a friend of mine, Mr. Coulson, at Houghton Grange, and I saw you at the
  meet."</p>

  <p>He hesitated and glanced at her face. It was inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if you'll ever forgive me," he went on desperately, "but it
  wasn't exactly my fault. I fell in love with you; I couldn't help that, you
  know. I asked Coulson if I couldn't be introduced, but he told me that it was
  impossible. From him I learnt your father's strong aversion to&mdash;to us,
  and his intention of making you marry that fellow Gryce. Everything seemed
  against me, but I swore to know you somehow, and, you see, I have succeeded
  so far, at any rate. Burditt was my sister's groom years ago, and I confided
  in him. I got him to engage me as a groom, and&mdash;and here I am. Don't
  turn away from me, Mabel," he pleaded. "I know it was a mean thing to do, but
  I could think of no other way, and I felt that I must get to know you; you
  know why. Tell me that there is a little, just a little, hope for me."</p>

  <p>She kept her eyes fixed upon the ground, and he felt that every moment of
  silence was golden. Pride was struggling with anger in her features while she
  was framing some stern rebuke.</p>

  <p>She looked up with a heavy frown, and opened her lips, but as her eyes met
  his, full of an eager, hopeful light, they drooped, and the rebuke melted
  away.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you really care for me," she said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"But I do, Mabel," he said earnestly. "Do you think I should have gone
  through what I have unless I did? You forgive me?" and his hand touched hers
  and gently took possession of it.</p>

  <p>"It was very wrong of you," she muttered demurely, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Some men are woefully misrepresented. Old Smith was no Tartar, after all.
  That same afternoon, having resumed his ordinary dress, Captain Escott called
  upon him, and in a frank, straightforward manner told him the whole
  truth.</p>

  <p>To his unspeakable amazement, his prospective father-in-law, after
  listening to his recital in solemn silence, burst into a roar of hearty
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"You shall have her, my boy, for your pluck!" he said, slapping the young
  officer on the back. "I like your face, and I like the way you've made a
  clean breast of it all. Gryce can go to the devil. Mabel's a lot too good for
  him. Stay and dine."</p>

  <p>And he did.</p>
