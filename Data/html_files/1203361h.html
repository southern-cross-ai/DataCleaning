  <h3>EDITOR'S NOTE</h3>

  <p class="blurb">The editor of <i>Munsey's Magazine</i> is as pleased as a
  host who offers an excellent dinner to present here the first in a series of
  eight great detective stories by E. Phillips Oppenheim, master of the craft.
  Not alone do these stories follow the science of crime detection and
  illumination in all its devious fascination; they present also a human
  detective, baring human frailties in his own logical, unique way. Better
  still, you will meet here the original woman detective&mdash;the only
  flesh-blood-and-tears woman detective in the army of detectives you have met
  and forgotten in fiction's march. You'll never forget the lady detective in
  Mr. Oppenheim's present series. You'll be like Mr. Stanley
  Brooke&mdash;you'll want to kiss her yourself before you've gone very far
  with her.</p>

  <h2>THE RESCUE OF WARREN TYRRWELL</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Dec 1913<br>
  with a drawing by W. B. King</h3>

  <p class="first">LORD WIMBLEDON was plainly out of sorts with everything and
  everybody. He looked gloomily across at the young man who shared the
  compartment with him in the Paris express, an expression of irritation on his
  severe face. The young man, quite oblivious to the fretful scrutiny, adjusted
  the golf-bag against the seat and turned to the pages of an illustrated
  sporting magazine.</p>

  <p>"What on earth did you bring those things with you for?" the old gentleman
  asked, irritably.</p>

  <p>The Hon. Stanley Brooke, scientific illuminator of crime, smiled up at
  him.</p>

  <p>"They assist," he replied, "in giving an air of general negligence to our
  journey. No one would imagine, for instance, that reasonable men would take
  golf-clubs with them to Paris on an errand like ours."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon grunted, fumbled for a moment in his waistcoat-pocket, and
  finally produced a telegram which he smoothed out and passed across to
  Brooke.</p>

  <p>"If only one could form any idea as to what our errand was!" he remarked
  irritably. "Read it aloud, please."</p>

  <p>Brooke obeyed. The message had been handed in at Paris about midnight on
  the previous day, and was addressed to Lord Wimbledon:</p>

  <p class="letter">Beg you to come over at once,<br>
  Am in great trouble.<br>
  WARREN.</p>

  <p>"Can you make anything out of it?" Lord Wimbledon asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Brooke admitted.</p>

  <p>"The most idiotic message I ever received in my life," his lordship
  continued.</p>

  <p>"However, I suppose we shall know all about it presently. I hope to
  goodness he hasn't got himself into any trouble with his chief. Tell me
  honestly now, Brooke, how does it strike you?"</p>

  <p>"To be candid," Brooke replied, "I should say that it does point to some
  sort of trouble at the embassy. If it had been a private matter, he would
  surely have written. I must confess, though, that I don't understand it at
  all. Sidney was always such a careful chap."</p>

  <p>"He has never," Lord Wimbledon pronounced, "given me cause for one
  moment's anxiety."</p>

  <p>"That," Brooke sighed, "is what makes it so disquieting. Paris is no place
  for a young man of that sort."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon relapsed into stony silence. It was not until they reached
  the outskirts of Paris that he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall soon know all about it now," he remarked, as they
  collected their baggage. "Let me come to the window. I shall recognize Warren
  more easily than you."</p>

  <p>The train glided into the Gare du Nord. There was the usual little rush of
  porters and the bustle of descending passengers. They made their way toward
  the barrier. The frown on Lord Wimbledon's face grew deeper. There was no
  sign at all of Warren.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he repeated, for the twentieth time. "The boy
  must know how anxious I feel, and I wired that I was coming on this train.
  Hello!"</p>

  <p>A little dark man had touched Lord Wimbledon upon the arm.</p>

  <p>"You are Lord Wimbledon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am, sir," was the curt reply. "If you are connected with the press, let
  me say at once that I am traveling incognito. I do not wish my
  presence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to do with the press," the little man interrupted. "I have
  come to you from your son, Mr. Warren Tyrrwell."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon looked him up and down with disfavor. He was neatly
  dressed, with pale face a little wizened, but his clothes and manners were of
  the middle class. He had the appearance of a respectable
  tradesman&mdash;perhaps a detective</p>

  <p>"If you have a message from my son," Lord Wimbledon said, "please let me
  hear it at once."</p>

  <p>"There is a little trouble," the man announced slowly. " It would be best,
  perhaps, not to speak here on the platform. You have registered luggage?"</p>

  <p>"None," Lord Wimbledon replied. "I am proposing to return to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"If you will come this way into the buffet," the little man said, "one can
  speak there with more freedom."</p>

  <p>"Lead the way, then," Lord Wimbledon answered sharply. "This is my
  traveling companion, Mr. Brooke."</p>

  <p>They passed hurriedly across the open space and mounted the stairs to the
  buffet. The little man led the way to a table in the corner.</p>

  <p>"Coffee&mdash;bring anything," Lord Wimbledon ordered of the expectant
  waiter&mdash;"coffee and brandy will do. Now, sir," he added, "if you will be
  so good as to get on with your message. You can speak before my friend here;
  he is in my confidence."</p>

  <p>"My name," the little man announced, "is Antin. For the last year your son
  has made use of me as a guide and interpreter. I am, at the present moment,
  having been unfortunate with my other work, occupying the position of his
  valet."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon frowned.</p>

  <p>"I was not aware that my son had a valet here," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"What I have told you is the truth, my lord," the man declared. "It is
  only during the last two months that I have filled this position, but the
  season has been a bad one in Paris, and it has provided me at least with a
  roof and an opportunity to look around me. If you will pardon my saying so,
  it will be better, for the present at any rate, if you will accept my
  statement."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," he said; "go on."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tyrrwell was, as you are doubtless aware, my lord," the little man
  continued, "fond of visiting the out-of-the-way corners of Paris and mixing
  with people of strange nationalities. Considering his official position in
  this city, it will probably occur to you to wonder whether such a course was
  altogether wise. In any case, the telegram, is the result of trouble into
  which Mr. Tyrrwell has fallen during one of these expeditions."</p>

  <p>"Tell me at once," Lord Wimbledon begged, "the nature of this
  trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am coming to it," the man declared. "It is perhaps within your
  lordship's knowledge that Mr. Tyrrwell's special duties at the embassy lately
  have been connected with Russian affairs. Mr. Tyrrwell has had lessons in the
  language and is fairly proficient. He has taken great interest in the Russian
  colony, and he and I have visited together occasionally some places of which
  it is well not to speak too openly.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday afternoon Mr. Tyrrwell brought back from the embassy a document
  consisting of about twenty pages of foolscap pinned together. He told me that
  he should not stir out until he had finished translating them from the
  Russian tongue. He set to work almost at once with the dictionary, and I made
  him some tea.</p>

  <p>"I understood from him that he had been given special permission to bring
  the work away from the embassy, as a reception was going on there, and part
  of the premises being closed for repairs, it was difficult for him to find a
  quiet corner.</p>

  <p>"In the course of his work Mr. Tyrrwell came across several phrases which
  he was quite unable to translate. He asked for my help, but my knowledge of
  the Russian tongue is very slight, and I was unable to assist him.</p>

  <p>"He did then what at the moment seemed only natural. He sent for a
  taximeter automobile and drove to the address of the man from whom he
  received lessons in Russian. That was about eight o'clock last night. Since
  then I have not seen Mr. Tyrrwell."</p>

  <p>"You have not seen him," Lord Wimbledon repeated. "You mean that he has
  not returned?"</p>

  <p>"About half past nine last night," the man went on, "the telephone rang. I
  answered it, and the voice which spoke to me was the voice of Mr. Tyrrwell. I
  could tell at once from his tone that something was wrong. He told me that he
  was down at the caf&eacute; over which the man Grika lives, from whom he has
  received Russian lessons, and there was something going on which he did not
  understand.</p>

  <p>"He was left alone for a moment, from what I gathered, and had rushed to a
  telephone in the back room. He seemed to be afraid that they were going to
  keep him there for some purpose. He begged me to come down at once, but to
  come quietly. In the middle of the last sentence the telephone was
  disconnected."</p>

  <p>"Disconnected!" Lord Wimbledon exclaimed. The little man nodded.</p>

  <p>"I heard Mr. Tyrrwell's voice suddenly choke," he said. "What happened,
  without doubt, was that some one had stolen up from behind and dragged him
  away."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Lord Wimbledon cried.</p>

  <p>"What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I took an automobile to the place," the man replied. "I saw Professor
  Grika at once. He was sitting in the caf&eacute;, which occupies the lower part of
  the premises, with some friends. He seemed surprised, but not in the least
  discomposed, at my visit. As to your son, he assured me that he had not seen
  him for ten days.</p>

  <p>"I bribed the waiters and a servant. I could learn nothing. I sat for
  some time in the caf&eacute;, thinking. Then I followed Grika to his room. I spoke
  to him plainly. I told him that Mr. Warren Tyrrwell was an Englishman of high
  position; that any attempt to ill-use him or to tamper with any documents he
  might have had with him could only result in utter disaster.</p>

  <p>"I threatened to go to the police. I spoke to him seriously. It was
  useless. Grika begged me to take any steps I liked, to have the place
  searched. He treated me as though I were a mild lunatic, and persisted in his
  statement that he had not seen Mr. Tyrrwell for ten days. Neither could I
  find any telephone upon the premises. Therefore I came away. I could think of
  nothing to do. I sent you the telegram in your son's name."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you go to the police at once?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Because if the affair becomes known," Antin replied, "I presume that Mr.
  Tyrrwell will get into trouble at the embassy. He confided to me that the
  document which he had brought away from the embassy was one of great
  importance. It will scarcely be considered discreet that he should have gone
  to such an unsavory neighborhood with any portion of that document in his
  possession."</p>

  <p>"In a sense that is true," Lord Wimbledon admitted. "On the other hand, my
  son's personal safety is the chief concern. What do you think, Mr.
  Brooke?"</p>

  <p>"I should suggest," Brooke said, "that you allow me to pay a visit to
  Professor Grika. It can do no harm and will only delay matters a little."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon jumped at the idea.</p>

  <p>"I place myself entirely in your hands, Brooke," he declared. "My own
  impulse, I must admit, is instantly to visit this man myself with a posse of
  <i>gendarmes</i> at my back. Warren's official position, however, must be
  considered. If that can be saved as well, so much the better. You have gifts
  in affairs of this sort, Brooke, which have been denied to me. We will await
  your return."</p>

  <p>"Better go to Warren's rooms, I think," Brooke advised. "Get back there as
  quickly as you can, and wait for me. Now write down this man Grika's address,
  if you please," he added, turning to Antin. The little man tore off a piece
  from the menu and obeyed. Brooke turned to Lord Wimbledon, lowering his voice
  a little.</p>

  <p>"If I were you," he said, "I should get back to -Warren's rooms as quickly
  as you can, and take this man with you. I hope I may be able to bring you a
  report of some sort or another in a very short time." Even the driver of the
  automobile hesitated when Brooke directed him to drive to 83 Rue de Mont
  Bleu.</p>

  <p>"It is far, monsieur," he objected, "and the roads are very narrow and
  difficult. One does not often approach the Rue de Mont Bleu in an
  automobile."</p>

  <p>"You will do so," Brooke assured him cheerfully, "and you will receive for
  <i>pourboire</i> another of these when our errand is accomplished."</p>

  <p>The man pocketed the five-franc piece and mounted a little reluctantly to
  his box. He paused for a moment to roll a cigarette, and started off. Even
  though he drove with the customary recklessness of his class, they reached
  safely in time the district they sought.</p>

  <p>Here their progress became slow. There were stalls out in the street,
  strange names transcribed in Jewish characters over the shops. The streets
  were ill-lit, the men and women had little of the air of French people. They
  were far removed, indeed, from the children of the city of pleasure. There
  was another turn, a long and silent boulevard filled with decaying houses, a
  steep climb, and another narrow street. At a caf&eacute; half-way along it the
  automobile came to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"<i>Voil&agrave;, monsieur</i>," the man announced.</p>

  <p>"You can wait," Brooke ordered.</p>

  <p>The man looked about him with an air of contempt.</p>

  <p>"If one can but obtain a drink in this hole&mdash;" he grumbled.</p>

  <p>Brooke stepped through the swing-door into the caf&eacute;. The place had none of
  the characteristics of similar establishments on the other side of the city.
  It was, in fact, more like an English public house near the wharfs. The
  illuminations were dim and scanty, the sawdust on the floor was stale, the
  few customers were gathered together at a table in a remote corner, intent on
  watching a game of dominoes.</p>

  <p>They turned their heads at Brooke's entrance and stared with something in
  their faces which reminded one of hungry vermin.</p>

  <p>Brooke addressed himself to a lady of great size who stood behind the
  counter. She had very fat cheeks and small black eyes. Her hair was jet-black
  and showed no signs of any attempt at care or arrangement. Her dress was
  insufficient.</p>

  <p>She looked at Brooke with the palms of her two hands stretched fiat upon
  the counter. She looked at him steadily, and the natural viciousness of her
  expression was overshadowed for the moment by a certain blank surprise.</p>

  <p>Brooke, carefully dressed notwithstanding his journey, his smooth, boyish
  face unwrinkled, his mouth still a trifle open, his monocle in his left eye,
  was a type of person of whom madame had had no experience. As she studied him
  the many wrinkles in her face relaxed. Her lips parted a little and disclosed
  her yellow teeth. One might imagine that if indeed she were a partner in any
  nefarious scheme, the advent of the Hon. Stanley Brooke had failed to inspire
  her with forebodings.</p>

  <p>"I understand," Brooke said, "that Professor Grika lives here and that he
  gives lessons in Russian. I should like to see him."</p>

  <p>"Professor Grika has gone into the country for three days," madame
  declared. "He is not to be found here."</p>

  <p>Brooke hesitated for a moment. Without turning his head, he was yet aware
  that the little group of men in the corner had suspended their game. Their
  faces were turned toward him. They were all listening.</p>

  <p>"It is unfortunate," he continued, "as I have come so far. Madame will be
  so good as to give me a glass of cognac."</p>

  <p>She moved slowly toward a row of bottles and served him. Brooke raised the
  thick glass to his lips. The liquor which he tasted was like fire. He
  coughed, and the woman laughed.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is used to milder drinks," she remarked scornfully.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I must admit that I find the brandy a little fiery, but it is perhaps
  suitable for the tastes of your clients. Is it possible, may I ask, that you
  give me the address of Professor Grika?"</p>

  <p>The woman was replacing the cork in the bottle.</p>

  <p>"One never knows where he is to be found," she declared. "He comes and
  goes when he wills. A strange man! He is perhaps visiting the president or
  the King of England. It is as much as I know."</p>

  <p>Brooke turned his head slightly. He could hear the sound of a man's
  footsteps coming across the sanded floor. A large, loosely built man,
  collarless and unshaven, wearing only a shirt and trousers, had
  approached.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur was inquiring for Professor Grika?"</p>

  <p>Brooke admitted the fact affably. The man pointed to a table.</p>

  <p>"We will sit down, you and I," he said, "and for something to
  drink&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Serve monsieur, I pray, with what he desires," Brooke interrupted.</p>

  <p>The woman grinned and half filled him a glass out of the bottle from which
  she had served Brooke. The man led the way to a little wooden table. They sat
  down before it.</p>

  <p>"We speak plainly here," the man growled, folding his arms and looking
  steadfastly at Brooke. "What is it you want?"</p>

  <p>"A few words with Professor Grika," Brooke replied.</p>

  <p>His companion looked at him steadfastly. His face was coarse, brutal,
  vicious, and unwashed. His small eyes had contracted almost into points
  underneath his lowering brows. He seemed to be subjecting Brooke to a
  steadfast examination.</p>

  <p>Presently he glanced across at the woman. She made a sign to him.</p>

  <p>"There are many reasons," he said slowly, "why Professor Grika does not at
  once receive all those who may choose to visit him."</p>

  <p>Brooke's mouth opened a little wider. He kept the monocle firmly in his
  left eye.</p>

  <p>"Political?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Political," his vis-a-vis admitted gravely. "But why not&mdash;The
  professor was exiled from Russia. They called him a nihilist because he was
  of the people. That is why he came to France&mdash;France, which should be a
  country for the people. Bah!"</p>

  <p>The man spat upon the floor. Then he crouched across the table, so close
  that Brooke leaned back to escape his garlic-laden breath.</p>

  <p>"For a <i>louis</i>," he said, "you shall see Professor Grika."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," Brooke protested, "why I should pay a <i>louis</i>
  to see a man whom I have come to ask to teach me Russian."</p>

  <p>"I tell you," the other replied, "that Grika is a difficult person to see.
  You might come here a dozen times and be refused. It is worth a <i>louis</i>.
  Come!"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. Brooke affected to hesitate for a moment. Then he
  placed the piece of gold upon the table. The man pocketed it and rose.</p>

  <p>"Come this way," he directed. They left the front room of the caf&eacute; and
  passed through a door, the two upper panes of which were broken and stuffed
  with brown paper. They climbed a flight of uneven stairs and arrived on a
  landing. Brooke's guide, who had been whistling to himself all the way up,
  whistled a little louder. Then he knocked at the door of a room.</p>

  <p>"You can go in," he said. "You'll find Professor Grika there."</p>

  <p>Brooke entered the room without hesitation. He heard the footsteps of his
  guide departing as he closed the door behind him. To his surprise the
  apartment, though plainly furnished, was clean, the floor carpeted, the walls
  filled with books and pictures. A man sat writing before a table, with a
  green-shaded lamp by his side. He looked up at Brooke's entrance. He was a
  man with a white beard, hollows in his cheeks&mdash;a frail man, apparently
  very old. His voice, when he spoke, shook a little.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur desired to see me?"</p>

  <p>"If you are Professor Grika, yes," Brooke replied. "I was recommended to
  you some time ago by an English friend of mine&mdash;Mr. Warren Tyrrwell. I
  wish to take some lessons in Russian."</p>

  <p>Professor Grika regarded his visitor thoughtfully. It was curious that,
  although Brooke's accent as a rule was a matter upon which he prided himself,
  he was speaking now with a curious, almost a guttural pronunciation.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Warren Tyrrwell," Professor Grika repeated. "Yes, yes; I remember the
  young gentleman perfectly. Why do you wish to learn Russian, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"I am in the German army," Brooke replied. "Staff officers are required to
  know at least two languages. I have chosen Russian for one, and I wish to
  make use of my vacation to acquire, at any rate, the rudiments of the
  language."</p>

  <p>The professor nodded gently. He seemed, indeed, a very quiet and harmless
  old man.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, please," he invited.</p>

  <p>Brooke took an easy chair close to the table. Professor Grika leaned back
  in his chair. The light now fell upon Brooke's face and left his in the
  shadow.</p>

  <p>"A German officer, eh&mdash;a German officer?" the professor repeated
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"To me you speak French more with an English accent."</p>

  <p>"I have studied in England," Brooke replied. "In my profession a knowledge
  of English is a necessity."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, in a few words," Grika asked, lowering his tone, "why you chose
  to come to me for lessons in the Russian language. There are many others more
  fashionably located."</p>

  <p>Brooke sat for a moment immovable. Then he rose from his place and walked
  carefully all round the room. Professor Grika made no effort to interfere
  with him. When he resumed his seat he moved a little nearer.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, "not only am I, as I have told you, a German officer,
  but I am in the Confidential Service. I know very well, among other things.
  Professor Grika, that you are a secret-service agent of a country which we
  will not mention.</p>

  <p>"You, like all of us, have been working, without a doubt, to get at the
  truth of the new French mobilization scheme, the caliber of the new gun which
  has been made so secretly, and the disposition of the new batteries.</p>

  <p>"It is possible that you may succeed where we others fail. Very well, I am
  here to deal with you. If by any chance you should light upon that scheme, or
  any part of it, it will be to. your interest to name the price to me."</p>

  <p>The professor remained motionless in his chair. His eyes were fixed upon
  Brooke as though he would read his soul. Brooke, bland and <i>insouciant</i>,
  had the appearance of a man who had been talking about the latest fashion in
  cravats.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"Captain von Heldermann," Brooke replied promptly.</p>

  <p>"I have not heard of you," Professor Grika said slowly. "You put before me
  a new idea. Such work as I have done I have been promptly paid for from
  another source. An exile from my country though I may be, I have preferred to
  use my small gifts in the interests of?"</p>

  <p>"You use them more effectually," Brooke interrupted, "when you study the
  interests of Germany. This <i>entente</i> is an absurdity. No treaties in the
  world can bridge over the gulf which remains between Russian and English
  interests. What is your price for that scheme?"</p>

  <p>"A quarter of a million francs." Brooke frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"I fear," he said, "that it will require consideration. The funds at my
  disposal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One hundred thousand francs," the professor interrupted.</p>

  <p>"If the scheme includes for certain the caliber of the gun," Brooke
  continued slowly.</p>

  <p>"It does," the professor assured him. "I do not know. Captain von
  Heldermann, from whence you derived your information, but it is most
  assuredly a fact that a document containing all these particulars was
  received at the British embassy yesterday. I cannot say how they procured it,
  but, unlike all official documents, it was in Russian, not French. One page
  of it I have already seen. The remainder will be in my hands to-night."</p>

  <p>"Then at midday to-morrow," Brooke said, "I will be here with a hundred
  thousand francs."</p>

  <p>The professor sat quite quietly for several moments. His shoulders were
  hunched. He looked now down at the desk, now into Brooke's face.</p>

  <p>"It is arranged," he declared at last. "Permit me."</p>

  <p>He rose from his place and took Brooke by the arm. For a moment he
  listened. Then he opened the door. Unfamiliar though the sound seemed from
  his lips, he whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"I shall descend with you," he announced. Brooke was conscious, as they
  reached the end of the passage, of retreating footsteps. He caught a glimpse
  of two men stealing away; caught a glimpse, even, of the knife in the belt of
  one of them. The door at the bottom of the stairs was locked. Again the
  professor whistled. The woman unlocked it. She stood there with lowering
  face.</p>

  <p>"It is not an affair for our benefit, this, then!" she exclaimed shrilly.
  "Jean will be furious indeed&mdash;and I! For what are we here? Why should we
  let opportunities?"</p>

  <p>The professor held out his hand. "Madame," he said, "all will be
  recompensed to you. This gentleman has my safe conduct."</p>

  <p>He walked with Brooke through the caf&eacute; to the pavement outside and stood
  there as his visitor drove away. Brooke drove to the block of flats in which
  Warren's rooms were situated, changing his automobile twice during the
  journey. Antin admitted him and he found Lord Wimbledon walking up and down
  the little sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Well? Well?" the latter exclaimed eagerly. "Have you found him&mdash;Is
  he there?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," Brooke replied, handing his hat to Antin and drawing off
  his gloves, "To tell you the truth, I never asked." Lord Wimbledon stared at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," Brooke continued, "the great thing is to get Warren out
  of this without any trouble at the embassy. I have discovered at least this
  much&mdash;that he was not so rash as appeared. He took with him to that
  Russian one page only of the document in question."</p>

  <p>"But where is my boy&mdash;What are they doing to him?" Lord Wimbledon
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"One can only hazard surmises," Brooke replied thoughtfully. "I believe
  that our friend Grika has him safely under lock and key, and the neighborhood
  is certainly a horrible one. But on the other hand, Grika is much too clever
  to take unnecessary risks. In any case, we must play the game, for Warren's
  sake and every one's. You haven't communicated with the embassy at all,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Lord Wimbledon replied.</p>

  <p>"I have done nothing but wait here for you."</p>

  <p>Brooke nodded, and for the first time made a careful survey of his
  surroundings. The small sitting-room in which they were bore every sign of a
  hurried departure. There were writing materials which had evidently been
  thrown hastily down upon the table and a small locked safe stood on one side.
  There were plenty of loose sheets of paper about; no written ones. Brooke
  nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"The boy wasn't quite such a mug, then," he murmured. "He locked up the
  rest when he started out for Grika. Now, sir," he added, turning to Lord
  Wimbledon,</p>

  <p>"I want you, if you don't mind, to go into the little dining-room, take
  Antin with you, and lock yourselves in. Very likely Antin will be able to
  find you something in the way of dinner. If you hear a ring, don't answer the
  bell; and if there is a bolt upon the door, don't draw it."</p>

  <p>"It would be more satisfactory to me&mdash;" Lord Wimbledon began.</p>

  <p>Brooke held out his hand. He spoke with unusual abruptness.</p>

  <p>"I want you to do as I ask this moment," he insisted.</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon made no further objection. He left the room at once,
  followed by Antin. As soon as they had departed Brooke lifted the curtains
  which divided the sitting-room from the bedroom, and drawing an easy chair up
  behind them, settled down to wait.</p>

  <p>He had turned out the lights, both in the sitting-room and the bedroom,
  but he had pulled a small table up to his side on which was an electric
  reading-lamp which he could turn on at a moment's notice. For a little more
  than an hour he sat there waiting. Then the silence of the flat was suddenly
  broken by the shrill ringing of the electric bell. There was no reply. It
  rang again, and again there was no response. Then, a few moments later,
  Brooke beard the click of a key in the outer door, which was at once softly
  opened and closed. There was the sound of footsteps in the outer hall, the
  opening of the sitting-room door, and Grika's voice, low, yet commanding.</p>

  <p>"Turn on the lights!"</p>

  <p>Through the chink in the curtains Brooke saw the little room suddenly
  illuminated. Warren, white as a sheet, with rings under his eyes, was
  standing by the side of the switch. A few feet away, still in his hat and
  overcoat, was Grika. The latter spoke again.</p>

  <p>"What are all these papers upon the table?"</p>

  <p>"The beginning of my translation," Warren faltered.</p>

  <p>"Where is the document itself?"</p>

  <p>"In the safe," was the mumbled reply.</p>

  <p>"Unlock it at once!" Grika directed. "You have the keys."</p>

  <p>The young man hesitated. From where he was Brooke could see that his hands
  were shaking all the time. About a yard away from him Grika stood, and poised
  lightly in his fingers was a dull little bar of some springy metal with a
  leaden top.</p>

  <p>"Remember," Grika said softly, "that if you give me the slightest trouble
  you will go down like a stone once and forever. I shall have the papers
  anyway&mdash;you know that. You know that I shall keep my word, and you know
  that all my arrangements are made for escaping from here. Unlock that
  safe."</p>

  <p>The young man hesitated no longer.</p>

  <p>With shaking fingers he adjusted the combination. The door swung open.
  Grika drew from it a little roll of papers which he thrust into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"It is finished," he said softly. "You have escaped lightly. Others who
  have visited me in the Rue de Mont Bleu have suffered what you have suffered
  for a week and more instead of for a few hours only. A month's vacation or a
  short time in the hospital will put you all right again. See how thoughtful I
  am. I am going to save even your reputation."</p>

  <p>He had drawn a cord from his overcoat pocket. With his hand upon Warren's
  chest, he was forcing him back into the easy chair.</p>

  <p>"I shall tie you hand and foot," he announced. "You will be discovered in
  a state of collapse. Your reputation will be saved."</p>

  <p>Brooke set his teeth. The moment had come. With his left hand he threw
  aside the curtain and stepped into the room.</p>

  <p>"If you make the slightest movement," he said quietly, "I shall
  fire."</p><br>

         title="Illustration by W. B. King">
  </div><br>

  <p>The little man seemed, for a moment, stiffened into some suspended form of
  life.</p>

  <p>Then he turned his head very slowly and looked into Brooke's face. There
  was not the slightest sign of any expression in his features. It was as
  though he had been turned to stone. Yet Brooke knew all the time that he was
  thinking, that his brain was working rapidly and fiercely. Warren Tyrrwell,
  after one little sobbing cry, had fallen forward, stretched upon the floor in
  a dead faint.</p>

  <p>"Take those papers from your overcoat pocket and place them upon the
  table," Brooke continued. "Don't hesitate. Listen. You are my man if I choose
  to take you. I don't. You are free. The papers, though&mdash;every one of
  them. You brought the missing sheet with you I notice. Leave it with the
  others."</p>

  <p>Grika drew a little breath. Very slowly he began to empty his pockets. The
  roll of papers lay upon the table.</p>

  <p>"So you mean to save your hundred thousand francs, Captain von
  Heldermann," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>"That is the idea," Brooke admitted coolly. "Be careful there are no odd
  sheets left in your pockets. Turn the pockets inside out, please&mdash;so.
  Nothing left there, I see. Very well. Now, professor, I have nothing more to
  do with you."</p>

  <p>The man looked at him. His cold blue eyes were filled with reluctant
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"If I might be permitted," he said, "to give you a word of advice, I
  think, after all, you had better pull that trigger. You have outwitted me
  to-day and robbed me of a prize which was surely mine. It took only a few
  hours," he added scornfully, "to make pap of that young man. He was my broken
  creature."</p>

  <p>"To the door, Professor Grika," Brooke ordered. "Leave it wide open and
  descend the stairs. I shall follow you."</p>

  <p>The professor buttoned up his coat.</p>

  <p>"I have no wish to stay," he said. "I only hope that we may meet again.
  Captain von Heldermann."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stanley Brooke," Brooke corrected him. "That young man is a
  relative," he added, pointing to where Warren lay upon the floor. "A family
  affair, you see. So you will understand why this little matter has to be kept
  secret."</p>

  <p>The professor removed his hat.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said, "my congratulations are the more heartfelt. I depart.
  Only," he added, with a little flash of his eyes, "if ever the time should
  come when it is you whose hands are empty and my right finger where yours is
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! " Brooke interrupted, as he stood at the top of the steps. "
  Good night, professor!"</p>

  <p>He watched the man disappear and returned to the sitting-room. Lord
  Wimbledon and Antin answered his summons at once.</p>

  <p>"You'll find Warren all right in a few minutes," Brooke assured them
  quickly. "The papers are all right, too."</p>

  <p>The telephone-bell suddenly tinkled. Brooke took up the receiver
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he said. "Yes, these are Mr. Warren Tyrrwell's rooms. Yes, Mr.
  Tyrrwell is in. Who is it? Percival? That you, Percival? I'm
  Brooke&mdash;Stanley Brooke&mdash;remember me? Just ran over to look Warren
  up for a few days. Found him rather seedy, I am sorry to say, struggling with
  some extra work. Oh, no! He's all right. He's here&mdash;hasn't been out all
  day, he tells me. Right-o! Yes, we shall all be here. Lord Wimbledon is over
  for a few days, too. So-long!"</p>

  <p>Brooke set down the receiver. Then he turned toward Lord Wimbledon. Warren
  was sitting up in his chair, drinking the brandy which Antin had brought.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, "the chief has just found out that you were allowed to
  bring those papers away. They have had a fit of nerves. Percival's coming
  round at once. Remember, you haven't been out. You've been ill. You've been
  meaning to get on with the work, but you haven't been well enough because of
  this attack. That's all. Stick to it and you're safe. If any one thinks that
  they saw you out, they were mistaken."</p>

  <p>Warren Tyrrwell blinked his eyes for a moment and looked around.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he said, a little more cheerfully. "I'm feeling better
  already. I'm glad it's Percival who's coming."</p>

  <p>Lord Wimbledon crossed the room and rested his hand upon Brooke's
  shoulder. His voice shook a little.</p>

  <p>"You have saved Warren's career and the honor of our family," he declared
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>Warren's lips were suddenly quivering. He seemed on the verge of a
  complete breakdown.</p>

  <p>"I should have given up the papers," he sobbed. "I was broken. I can't
  tell you what they did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>" Hush!" Brooke interrupted sternly. "All you have to remember is this:
  You did not give up the papers. You had no real intention of giving them up.
  Be a man now and see this thing through. Remember that Percival will be here
  presently."</p>

  <p>Brooke sat at supper an hour later with Percival in a fashionable
  Montmartre restaurant.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, after all, Paris doesn't agree with Warren," the latter
  remarked, as he sipped his wine. " If he gets the least strain upon him, or a
  few hours' extra work even, he knocks up."</p>

  <p>"He is not strong," Brooke admitted; "but why on earth do you expect a
  chap to do a schoolboy's task like translating? Why don't you send it out to
  a teacher or some one?"</p>

  <p>Percival smiled in a superior manner.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "that document which we entrusted to Warren was
  a most important political paper. To tell you the truth, it was entirely a
  mistake that he was allowed to take it away from the embassy, and the chief
  was in a rare stew when he knew about it."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Brooke asked, looking hungrily at the dish which was being prepared
  for them.</p>

  <p>Percival dropped his voice.</p>

  <p>"One has to be jolly careful over here, I can tell you," he declared.
  "There are lots of people in Paris&mdash;people whom we know quite well to be
  agents&mdash;secret agents for foreign powers&mdash;who would have given a
  fortune for a sight of those papers."</p>

  <p>Brooke smiled at him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Sort of thing we read about but don't believe," he remarked
  incredulously.</p>

  <h2>THE PRINCESS PAYS</h2>

  <h4>BEING THE SECOND OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Jan 1914, with a drawing by
  W. B. King</h3>

  <p class="first">AS full of human weaknesses as his fellows, notwithstanding
  his gifts of perception, the Hon. Stanley Brooke sat losing his money with
  cheerful pertinacity at one of the two roulette tables in the Sporting Club
  at Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>Arrived, after an hour or so of play, at the end of his nightly limit, he,
  watched the disappearance of his last <i>louis</i> and, with a sigh, vacated
  his chair and seated himself on one of the divans which fringed the wall.</p>

  <p>Here for some time he indulged in the occupation which, on the whole, he
  found more attractive even than the gambling. He watched the people as they
  went by&mdash;the women in their brilliant toilets and surfeit of jewels,
  looking as though the very air of the place had somehow fostered in them an
  insane rivalry in flamboyance, almost passionate, yet, in this particular
  corner of the world, not without its picturesque effect. By their side the
  men seemed more than ordinarily insignificant. There were some whom he
  recognized, a few with whom he exchanged greetings, many of a class hard to
  place, difficult even to guess at. On the whole, considering the nature of
  their surroundings, it appeared to Brooke, as he watched them, that their
  faces showed very little sign of the emotions.</p>

  <p>Large sums were being won or lost, but none of the crowd who passed seemed
  to carry any indication in their features as to whether they belonged to the
  fortunate or unfortunate. There were little fragments of character which
  were, in their way, interesting. A well-known adventurer passed arm in arm
  with a rubber magnate of meteoric rise and uncivilized appearance. The
  heroine of a world-famous murder case, dressed in somber black, pale and
  emotionless, as she had seemed when she had waited for the news of her life
  or death, stood with a handful of mille notes in her hand, watching their
  dispersal without even curiosity.</p>

  <p>A German prince passed, in eager attendance upon the lady who was reported
  to have enslaved his fancy for the moment, and who was walking round from
  the, baccarat rooms to change her luck. Brooke leaned back among his
  cushions, mildly amused by it all.... And then the first note of real
  drama!</p>

  <p>A woman came slowly down the room, at whom most people turned their heads
  to glance. She was even more beautiful, more exquisitely dressed, more
  gorgeously bejeweled than those others. Her carriage was almost imperious.
  She looked around her with the insolent air of one accustomed to command.</p>

  <p>Then, when within a few paces of Brooke, she paused, and he alone,
  perhaps, in the room, saw the change in her face, which was in itself an
  epitome of all the passions of life. She seemed suddenly to become rigid, her
  face chalk-like, her eyes set and staring.</p>

  <p>Brooke glanced across the room. Her eyes were fixed upon the face of a
  middle-aged man who was looking over at the opposite table, craning his neck
  to watch the result of the turning wheel and quite unconscious of the woman's
  gaze. She stepped out of the throng and seated herself on the divan.</p>

  <p>The little white ball had fallen into its place, the croupier's monotonous
  voice was heard announcing the number.</p>

  <p><i>"Vingt, noir, pair et passe!"</i></p>

  <p>A little buzz of voices arose from the crowd. The woman turned her head
  and glanced at Brooke.</p>

  <p>"I had the honor of meeting you last night at the Duc de Mendosa's
  supper," he reminded her with a bow.</p>

  <p>She inclined her head.</p>

  <p>"I remember you perfectly," she admitted. "You are English, are you not,
  Mr. Brooke?"</p>

  <p>"I am English, princess," he replied.</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment appraisingly. It was a curious fact; but,
  in accordance with a recently developed instinct, directly he felt the
  significance of her look, his features seemed automatically to assume a
  somewhat fatuous immobility which, to one unacquainted with the quality of
  his mind, would readily stamp him a vacuous dawdler.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said. "I will tell you something. Come a little nearer to
  me, please."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her at once. Her eyes traveled around the few people in their
  immediate vicinity. Her fingers played for a moment with the wonderful pearls
  which shimmered upon her white bosom.</p>

  <p>"You know my history?" she continued.</p>

  <p>"Every one who comes to Monte Carlo knows it. What was it they told me
  about you&mdash;that you were a novelist or an essayist, or that you were
  interested in people for some reason or other&mdash;I forget what.
  Listen."</p>

  <p>Brooke remained silent. He did not specify the particular nature of his
  interest in his fellow creatures.</p>

  <p>"Look across the room," she directed. "There is a man standing there
  watching the tables&mdash;a fairly good-looking, harmless, middle-aged
  Englishman."</p>

  <p>Brooke nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see the person you mean," he assented.</p>

  <p>"His name is Geoffrey Hardways," she went on. "Well, I will tell you
  something which may suggest a problem. Everything I possess and am in life I
  owe to that man."</p>

  <p>He looked at her a little puzzled. Once more she played with her
  pearls.</p>

  <p>"I am," she continued, "without a, doubt the best-dressed woman in this I
  room. I have a certain indefinite right to the title which I bear. There are
  no jewels in Monte Carlo to compare with mine. There are no men who would not
  come if I beckoned. This I tell you without conceit or false shame, and I
  repeat that everything I possess and everything I am I owe to that man."</p>

  <p>She paused, as though expecting a question, but Brooke remained
  imperturbably silent. He had, however, the air of one who waits.</p>

  <p>"You do not choose to commit yourself," she said quietly. "It is good.
  Therefore, I must put before you the problem which surely is not without its
  interest. What do you suppose are my feelings for him? Am I grateful? I have
  cause, have I not? Or do I wish that he had let me remain the very
  ill-treated and miserable governess of the lady in whose service I was when
  he found me?"</p>

  <p>"Princess," Brooke replied, "you ask me a very hard question. Supremacy in
  any walk of life brings with it its own peculiar satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"It is the answer," she declared, "of a diplomatist. Now give me the
  answer of Mr. Stanley Brooke."</p>

  <p>"Princess," said he, "I think that if I were Geoffrey Hardways and you
  looked at me as you looked at him just now, would leave Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>Very slightly her lips moved. It was scarcely a smile, yet it seemed in
  some way an indication of her satisfaction with his reply.</p>

  <p>"Who knows," she murmured softly, "but that you are right?"</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and left him. Very slowly she continued her
  perambulation of the tables. Almost every moment some man paused to speak to
  her. She dismissed every one with a word. She was in one of her moods, a
  German financier murmured, who had been hoping to introduce a friend. She
  passed on until she stood at the other side of the tables. She came to a
  standstill immediately behind Geoffrey Hardways.</p>

  <p>Brooke caught a glimpse of her face&mdash;white, and with a somber shadow
  upon it&mdash;over his shoulder. Then he saw her fingers touch his arm, saw
  him turn around to receive a brilliant smile of welcome. They stood talking
  together. Finally they moved away.</p>

  <p>Brooke, upon whom the incident had left a slightly unpleasant sensation,
  rose and made his way to the bar, where he found an easy chair and made
  himself comfortable with a whisky-and-soda and a cigarette. He had scarcely
  been there five minutes when the woman entered, with Hardways by her side.
  There were several empty places on the other side of the room, but after a
  moment's hesitation she led the way to v/here Brooke was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Tired of the game already, my friend?" she asked Brooke. "Let me present
  an old friend of mine whom I have unexpectedly discovered here&mdash;Mr.
  Hardways, Mr. Brooke."</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands. Hardways, although passable enough in appearance,
  was a little nervous and obviously not wholly in touch with his
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>"All new to me, this, you know," he admitted a moment or two later, as
  they sat together. "Until I met&mdash;met the princess just now, I was
  feeling rather out of it. I've never been on the Riviera before in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"You play, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Don't understand the game. I play a little bridge at home."</p>

  <p>"The Riviera and its life," the princess said calmly, "are all new to Mr.
  Hardways. He is disposed to be enthusiastic&mdash;why not? After all, there
  is little else like it, especially for those who love gambling. V/e must
  teach you to play roulette or <i>chemin de fer</i>, Mr. Hardways." He
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'd be afraid of losing," he confessed. "I am a poor man."</p>

  <p>"So few people lose if they play intelligently," she murmured. "Several of
  my friends took over a thousand pounds each away last evening. It is so
  simple. Besides, you can always stop if the luck is against you. Isn't that
  so, Mr. Brooke?"</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," Brooke replied.</p>

  <p>"It rather depends upon one's strength of mind, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke he found himself noticing the weak droop of the other
  man's lips, the somewhat covetous gleam in his eyes at the mention of
  money.</p>

  <p>"If I were you," Brooke advised, "I don't think that I should play, unless
  you first of all put a fixed limit upon what you can afford to lose. It seems
  to me to be the only way to gamble in comfort." She laughed at him
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You are a timid person, I fear, Mr. Brooke!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"If only I could afford it," Hardways muttered, gazing admiringly at his
  companion, "I'd like to have a plunge."</p>

  <p>Brooke made his excuses a few minutes later and left the two together.
  Somehow the incident of meeting them continued to affect him in a slightly
  unpleasant manner. He felt a return of the same feeling when, the next
  evening, he came face to face suddenly with Hardways near one of the roulette
  tables. The latter greeted him vociferously.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he exclaimed. "Come and have a drink. Look here what I've won!
  Never saw such luck in my life! The princess stood behind me all the
  time&mdash;must have been my mascot, I think. I had three <i>en pleins</i> in
  six turns of the wheel."</p>

  <p>Brooke walked with him to the bar. In a sense, he did so against his own
  inclinations, for the man failed to attract him in any way. Yet he felt an
  interest, the nature of which he could scarcely define. Hardways was talking
  all the time. "By Jove!" he continued. "I really think I am in luck! Never
  been in the place before, you know. Never understood the game until the
  princess explained it. I only came to the club by accident. Chap I traveled
  with in the train advised me to."</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying?" Brooke asked for the sake of making
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"Up at one of those little hotels on the hill," Hardways replied,
  mentioning the name of a second-rate hostelry. "I can't run to the swagger
  places. I've got a wife and family to look after, and my profession&mdash;
  I'm an architect, you know&mdash;doesn't mean big things at any time. By
  Jove, what a life out here, though! How the people do enjoy themselves!
  Whisky-and-soda, eh?"</p>

  <p>Brooke nodded, and they sat down together. The princess was standing
  talking to some men on the threshold of the baccarat room. Hardways's
  expression, as he watched her, was almost fatuous. He stroked his mustache
  complacently.</p>

  <p>"Loveliest woman I ever saw in my life!" he exclaimed. "Do you know," he
  went on confidentially, "she's an old pal of mine, the princess. I knew her
  when she was a little governess in Winchester and I was articled to a firm of
  architects there. She was a pretty little thing then, but I never expected
  her to blossom out like this. Jove! to think that I nearly married her!"</p>

  <p>"In her way," Brooke remarked, "she has made a success of life."</p>

  <p>The man laughed good-humoredly. He saw no second meaning in Brooke's
  words.</p>

  <p>"Nothing like being at the top of the tree," he agreed. "She is that, and
  no mistake. They tell me all the men here are mad after her, but unless she
  takes a fancy to any one, she won't be seen talking to an ordinary person.
  Lucky for me I knew her in the old days!"</p>

  <p>Brooke remained silent. The man went on talking in his simple, egotistical
  way of his life in the midland town where they lived, his wife's invitation
  to stay with an aunt at a hotel in Hy&egrave;res, and his own visit to Monte
  Carlo, which he evidently looked upon as something exceedingly dashing.</p>

  <p>"I was going back to-morrow," he announced, "but I think I shall hang on
  for a bit. I can afford it now, anyway. My Heavens, isn't she beautiful!"</p>

  <p>The princess came slowly toward them. She was dressed in white chiffon,
  with less jewelry than usual save for that one rope of magnificent pearls.
  She smiled at the two men as she. approached. Hardways bustled to find a
  chair for her.</p>

  <p>"You must sit down, Violet," he begged. "Do you know how much I've won?
  Over a thousand francs&mdash;forty pounds, mind!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him through half-closed eyes; a faint smile of amusement
  curved her lips. A thousand francs! There was sometimes a hat which she could
  buy for the sum&mdash;not often!</p>

  <p>"But you are satisfied with too small things," she laughed. "I have
  brought thirty mille with me to-night and I am going to risk it presently.
  Come with me and I will show you how to play."</p>

  <p>"Thirty mille!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>The whole little world, as he knew it, seemed dwindling away.</p>

  <p>"With your luck," she said, "you should be a large winner. You are content
  with too small things. One must learn to be ambitious&mdash;is it not so, Mr.
  Brooke?"</p>

  <p>"That depends," Brooke replied. "My advice to every man who comes to Monte
  Carlo would be to gamble strictly according to his means. Personally, I think
  that a mille is a very nice little win for the evening. I think that I should
  button it up in my pocket and go home." The contempt in her face was almost
  withering. She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You are both very small men," she declared. "I think that I will play
  <i>chemin de fer</i>. The grand duke is keeping a place for me."</p>

  <p>"Come and play roulette," Hardways begged eagerly. "You promised to show
  me some new <i>coups</i>."</p>

  <p>"If you have the courage," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Come, then."</p>

  <p>Brooke passed in and out of the rooms once or twice that evening, and on
  each occasion he saw Hardways and the princess, the former always stooping a
  little over the table, the other at his elbow, sometimes advising, sometimes
  encouraging. Hardways's face had lost the sleek, self-satisfied appearance of
  earlier in the evening. He was alternately pale and flushed. His eyes seemed
  to have drawn closer together. He appeared to be winning, so far as one could
  judge from the pile in front of him. The princess and he both held little
  cards and were evidently playing upon a system.</p>

  <p>Brooke left them there to stroll on the Terrace with some friends and did
  not return. The next morning, however, about twelve o'clock, he met Hardways
  in the street. The man looked tired but triumphant. He was wearing a new
  Homburg hat and carrying a great bunch of roses in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Just going to leave these at the Paris for the princess," he announced,
  greeting Brooke. "Let's have a drink first. I want to tell you about last
  night."</p>

  <p>They seated themselves at one of the tables in front of the Caf&eacute; de Paris.
  The change in Hardways was momentous. His hands twitched nervously, his eyes
  had grown narrow. He had already lost some portion of his fresh color.</p>

  <p>"Last night," he declared, leaning over toward Brooke and speaking in a
  low, eager tone, "I won eight thousand francs. Just think of it! I'm a
  poorish man, you know. Think of what it means. Eight thousand francs! It was
  dead easy, too. The princess has a system. I simply followed. I've got a bit
  of a head for figures and the money rolled in. I am moving down to the Paris
  this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Glad you've been lucky," Brooke remarked; "but that sort of thing doesn't
  always go on, you know."</p>

  <p>"Because people don't keep their heads," Hardways explained eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Now this system of mine, or rather the princess's, if you know when to
  leave off, is infallible. You win so much a day and you stop. The moment you
  begin to lose, you chuck it. See what I mean?" Brooke smiled.</p>

  <p>"I tell you frankly that I am no believer in systems," he confessed.
  Hardways seemed almost angry.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," he continued, a little defiantly, "I have won eight thousand
  francs, and I've made up my mind to win a hundred thousand before I go home.
  It makes all the difference to me. Just fancy, the whole of my work last year
  barely brought me in as much as I have in my pocket at the present
  moment!"</p>

  <p>"Supposing you had lost it," Brooke asked, "wouldn't that have been
  inconvenient?" Hardways finished his drink.</p>

  <p>"I didn't lose," he said shortly, "and I'm not going to. No one need if
  they know how to play. I am just going to drop in at the Casino for half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>He got up and walked away. Brooke strolled up as far as Ciro's to order a
  table for luncheon and back again toward the Terrace. He passed Hardways
  coming out of the Casino. The man's air of satisfaction was almost
  fatuous.</p>

  <p>"A thousand francs," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Quite easily, too. The system again."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Brooke murmured.</p>

  <p>The obvious did not at once happen.</p>

  <p>Two evenings later Hardways walked into the bar about three o'clock in the
  morning with his hands in his pockets and a bright spot of color in his
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I've done it!" he declared to Brooke.</p>

  <p>"I've won two hundred thousand francs! I've finished. I'm off back to
  Hy&egrave;res tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>Brooke congratulated him, and at that moment the princess came slowly into
  the room. She was all in black, with a diamond collar around her neck and a
  diamond star upon her bosom. Hardways watched her come with a peculiar
  expression in his strained face.</p>

  <p>"That's the most maddening woman!" he muttered. "No wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did I hear you say," she asked slowly, "that you were going?"</p>

  <p>"I have won two hundred thousand francs," he replied triumphantly. "I'm
  off back with it."</p>

  <p>She smiled, so slowly that the contempt of her lips was scarcely
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>"You have no use for money, then, beyond two hundred thousand francs?" she
  murmured. "How right I was! Let us talk no more of the matter. Give me some
  wine, will you? I am tired."</p>

  <p>She sank into a chair and Brooke, after a few moments, departed. When he
  came back Hardways was seated at the table, playing, and behind him stood the
  princess, her face white and set. An hour later their places were vacant. The
  princess passed Brooke and paused to whisper in his ear.</p>

  <p>"It is the beginning of the end! He has lost half his winnings. He will
  stay&mdash;until he has recovered them."</p>

  <p>The next day Brooke played golf above the clouds at La Turbie and dined
  with some friends at Cap Martin in the evening. He looked in at the Sporting
  Club only for an hour on the following afternoon, but there were no signs of
  either the princess or Hardways.</p>

  <p>He found a note from her, however, at his hotel, inviting him to a
  supper-party that night at her rooms. He accepted, owing to some faint
  curiosity which he could not help feeling as to the fate of the man
  Hardways.</p>

  <p>The company was small but select&mdash;a Russian grand duke, a couple of
  very well-known French actresses, an Englishman with whom Brooke was
  acquainted, and an American whose yacht was in the harbor. There was no sign
  of Hardways.</p>

  <p>Brooke, who was sitting near his hostess, whispered an inquiry about him
  toward the close of the meal. Once more that peculiar smile he had never
  wholly understood played for a moment upon her lips.</p>

  <p>"It is finished," she murmured. "It was difficult, for the man's luck at
  starting was prodigious. It is all over now, though."</p>

  <p>Almost as she uttered the words some one pushed on one side the footman
  who was entering the room. Hardways himself stood there&mdash;a broken,
  dejected, yet threatening figure. He was still in morning dress. He looked as
  though he had neither washed nor touched his hair for many hours. He glared
  at them all.</p>

  <p>"Princess," he called out, "I want to speak to you at once."</p>

  <p>She turned her head and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Gustave," she directed, "you had better remove that person. He has not
  the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> here."</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

         title="Illustration by W. B. King">
  </div>

  <p>"<i>Entr&eacute;e</i> be damned!" Hardways shouted.</p>

  <p>"It's your fault I'm in this mess. The fellow you introduced to cash my
  checks has stripped me. I'm ruined! I tell you I'm not going back to face it.
  Lend me a few mille. Let me have one more try. If you don't, I'll shoot
  myself here."</p>

  <p>He actually drew a pistol from his pocket. Not a soul moved.</p>

  <p>"Will you lend me five mille?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"If any one tries to take this away from me I'll shoot him first. Answer!"
  The princess's answer was a laugh. She had lowered her lorgnette and sat
  there, exquisite, maddening, laughing even with her eyes.</p>

  <p>"But the man is mad!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"Mad with presumption, too, to cross my threshold. Shoot yourself by all
  means, dear M. Hardways. Others have done it before you."</p>

  <p>The silence which followed her words seemed to have become possessed of a
  quality intensely, breathlessly dramatic. One felt that the man's finger had
  stiffened upon the trigger of his pistol. Suddenly Brooke rose to his feet
  and walked calmly across the room.</p>

  <p>"Give me that," he said quietly. Hardways hesitated, and that moment's
  hesitation weakened him. He was trembling now like a child. Brooke took the
  pistol from him and thrust it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Not even a grain of pluck left!" the princess remarked scathingly. "Throw
  him into the street, Gustave. See that we are not disturbed again."</p>

  <p>The servants, brave enough now, rushed him out. The princess turned round
  once more to the supper-table.</p>

  <p>"A most impossible person," she declared. "I was unfortunate enough to
  have made his acquaintance when I was a girl, and he has made himself a
  nuisance to me. That, however, is ended now. Let us go into the salon and
  play." Two days later Brooke met the princess in the hall at the Paris. She
  beckoned him to her.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am at your service, princess," he replied.</p>

  <p>She moved toward the lift and they mounted to the fourth floor. She
  consulted the number of the key which she was carrying and led him to a room
  at the end of the corridor. It was a small apartment with windows looking out
  upon the back. There was a heap of masculine clothing upon the bed. The room
  had apparently been vacated in a hurry. Upon the mantelpiece were some
  photographs.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Hardways's room," she remarked. Brooke nodded.</p>

  <p>"What has become of him?"</p>

  <p>"They do not know," she replied. "He does not appear to have returned here
  after he left my rooms two nights ago. You see, he has left his belongings. I
  inquired, and the manager permitted me to inspect his apartment."</p>

  <p>Brooke looked grave.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, then," he said hesitatingly, "he found the courage. Tell me
  what really happened to him."</p>

  <p>"The tide turned," she answered slowly, "as I meant that it should. I
  stood over him and I watched him lose&mdash;lose all that he had won, all
  that he had with him. Then I introduced him to Felix, and Felix cashed his
  checks, one after the other, up to the amount that the man was worth."</p>

  <p>"You mean that he is ruined?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. To the last penny."</p>

  <p>Brooke glanced at the photographs upon the mantelpiece. They were
  commonplace enough, except that the woman had a pleasant face. One was a
  family group in which Hardways himself was sitting in the garden with three
  children and his wife grouped around him. It was an undistinguished-looking
  picture. The princess looked at it through her lorgnette.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she said, "people find happiness in this sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt they do, princess," Brooke agreed.</p>

  <p>She remained silent. The picture seemed, in a way, to fascinate her.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said presently, "that I was very nearly in that
  picture?"</p>

  <p>"You were engaged to marry him?" Brooke ventured to ask.</p>

  <p>"I was engaged to marry him," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"He threw me over. I was only a governess. His people were of the small
  professional class. They considered that a marriage with me would have
  spoiled his chances. I wonder!"</p>

  <p>She moved about restlessly for a minute or two. Brooke looked around the
  room once more. It was untidy, ordinary. The princess was gazing steadfastly
  at the photographs. She beckoned at last to Brooke.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, please."</p>

  <p>She led the way to her own apartments, a magnificent suite upon the first
  floor. From her desk she handed him a little packet.</p>

  <p>"I have discovered," she remarked, "your reputation. You are supposed to
  be an amateur detective, are you not? You will please find this man Hardways,
  if he is alive, and give him this."</p>

  <p>"If he is alive?" Brooke repeated doubtfully. She shrugged her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I t is for you to discover," she said, only her voice trembled a
  little.</p>

  <p>"Give me a letter to the chief of the police here," Brooke suggested. "One
  can learn nothing without influence. It is no use my searching for Hardways
  if indeed he has his place already in the little plot." She wrote a few lines
  and gave them to him. Brooke took his leave. On the following evening Brooke
  entered the smoking-room of the .Paradise Hotel in Hy&egrave;res from which
  Hardways had come. A familiar voice attracted his attention almost at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Time of my life, my boy!" Hardways, who was the center of a little group
  sitting around the billiard-table, declared.</p>

  <p>"Met no end of old pals. Absolutely top-hole, every minute of it."</p>

  <p>"Did you make a bit?" some one asked him.</p>

  <p>"Came out about level," was the nonchalant reply. "A few mille up one day
  and down the next. Nothing to speak of. Lost all my luggage on the way back,
  though."</p>

  <p>Brooke strolled a little farther into the room. The man Hardways looked at
  him, and the hand which held his cigar began to shake. Brooke greeted him
  with moderate affability.</p>

  <p>"How are you? Saw you in the Sporting Club a few evenings ago, didn't
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was there," Hardways admitted. "I remember you quite well."</p>

  <p>They drifted apart, but when a few moments later Brooke left the room,
  Hardways followed him.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a word with you?" he begged nervously.</p>

  <p>"Come outside," Brooke replied. "I have something to say to you, too."</p>

  <p>They strolled along the terrace until they came to a seat behind some
  trees.</p>

  <p>"Look here," Hardways said, "I hoped no one would turn up here just yet
  who was at Monte Carlo when I was. You know what happened to me?"</p>

  <p>"I know," Brooke admitted.</p>

  <p>"I meant to shoot myself. I wasn't game. It was just the thought of the
  wife and the kids, if it happened there. I wanted to make it easier for them.
  I have begun bathing down at the Plage. A chap went with me this morning. I
  am going alone to-morrow. I sha'n't come back. You see? It won't seem quite
  so bad." The man was in earnest this time beyond a doubt. He was pale, and
  his face was twitching. Brooke produced the packet.</p>

  <p>"I have come to Hy&egrave;res to see you," he said. "The princess sent me.
  When you first appeared you reawakened in her some impulse of resentment. She
  did her best to make you lose at roulette. She did her best to break
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is a judgment upon me!" the man muttered, looking steadily before
  him.</p>

  <p>"The princess has changed her mind," Brooke told him, placing the packet
  in the man's hand. "There are your checks and your losings. You need not mind
  taking them. Her husband left her three millions." The man seemed as though
  turned to stone.</p>

  <p>"I can't take her money," he faltered. "I behaved like a cad years
  ago."</p>

  <p>"She has forgiven you," Brooke said calmly. "She can afford, perhaps, to
  forgive. You must take the money for the sake of your family."</p>

  <p>The man's fingers tightened over the packet. His head drooped. Brooke
  glanced at his watch and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Any message?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Hardways tried to speak, but he found it difficult. He sat there gripping
  the packet. Every moment his face began to look more natural.</p>

  <p>"Thank her," he said simply. "I'll take the money. After all, she married
  a prince."</p>

  <h2>THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL</h2>

  <h4>BEING THE THIRD OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Feb 1914, with illustrations
  by J. Scott Williams</h3>

  <p class="first">"CAN I speak to you for a moment, sir, if you please?"</p>

  <p>The Hon. Stanley Brooke, who had just left the booking-office at Covent
  Garden Theater and was passing under the portico, turned around at the words,
  indifferently curious.</p>

  <p>A man had touched him upon the arm and stood by his side now, patiently
  waiting for a reply. At first glance he seemed entirely of the usual type.
  His clothes were shabby, his expression furtive, his smooth civility of the
  servile order. He was small, almost undersized; pallid, with narrow lips and
  protruding chin. The more Brooke looked at him, the less he liked his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Do I look the sort of person likely to give money to a man who is out of
  work, with a wife just recovering from an operation?" he asked patiently.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

        title="Illustration by J. Scott Williams">

  <p>"It isn't your appearance made me speak to you," the man replied quickly.
  "It's the fact that you're the Hon. Stanley Brooke, sir."</p>

  <p>"You have the advantage of me," Brooke remarked.</p>

  <p>"My name wouldn't interest you," the man continued hurriedly. "I'm
  cadging, right enough, but not in the way you think. I've heard them talking
  about you&mdash;some one pointed you out in Herbert's bar. When I saw you
  coming out of the booking-office at the theater there I made up my mind to
  speak to you. You take an interest in queer things and places, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent I do&mdash;and queer people," Brooke assented.</p>

  <p>The man moved a trifle nearer. More than ever, as he stood there, with his
  overcoat buttoned up to his chin, looking half fearfully around, he seemed
  like some hunted animal.</p>

  <p>"I could tell you something," he said, "if I had a chance. Will you come
  to my room to-night, any time after nine? No. 14 Hender Street, off Long
  Acre&mdash;straight up the stairs&mdash;There's my name chalked on the
  door&mdash;Robinson."</p>

  <p>"What am I to come for?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll put you onto something," the man replied, dropping his voice a
  little&mdash;" put you onto a job."</p>

  <p>"I think," Brooke remarked thoughtfully, "that if any exchange of
  hospitalities is to take place between us, I would rather be host. You can
  come and see me, if you like, at my rooms&mdash;No. 10 Peter
  Street&mdash;between seven and eight this evening."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be any good," the man replied. "What I want to tell you I can
  only tell you in my room. I dare not come up to the West End, either. I
  should be followed. You don't run any risk. It's simply a bit of money I
  want, and you shall have value for it, but I don't want to be seen with
  you."</p>

  <p>Brooke scratched his chin thoughtfully for a moment. It was raining
  slightly, and he noticed that the man had crept beneath the shelter of his
  umbrella. His desire to avoid observation was certainly not assumed.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of you," Brooke remarked, "and there are obvious
  objections to my visiting you in Long Acre. For anything I know, you may be a
  blackmailer or a thief, or any sort of bad character. Will you come to me if
  I stand a taxicab?"</p>

  <p>"I won't," the man answered. "I tell you it's only from my room you can
  understand what I want to put before you. You've nothing to be afraid of. I
  live alone there with my sister. There's no one else on the premises. You
  could double me up, if I tried to rob you, with one hand. Say you'll come
  to-night. Don't put it off. It's worth while."</p>

  <p>"I'll come," Brooke promised. The man moved away. Brooke turned around and
  watched him shuffle across the road.</p>

  <p>"Let myself in for something!" he sighed.</p>

  <p>It happened to be an evening without any engagements for Brooke. He dined
  in his rooms without changing his clothes, wrote a line or two upon half a
  sheet of note-paper, with the address to which he was going and the reasons
  for his visit, and left it upon the table, as was his custom when he was
  bound upon any unsavory errand.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock he walked eastward, turned into Long Acre, and discovered
  Hender Street without any particular difficulty. No. 16 consisted of an
  automobile showroom on the ground floor, which was now closed.</p>

  <p>An open door by the side led him to a flight of stairs, at the top of
  which, as he had been advised, he found the word "Robinson" written in white
  chalk upon an uninviting-looking panel from which most of the paint seemed to
  have been scraped off.</p>

  <p>He had scarcely knocked before the door was opened from inside. The little
  man who had accosted him in the street was standing there. He almost dragged
  Brooke in, stood for a moment listening, then closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Did you happen to notice whether any one saw you come in?" he asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"So far as I could see, the street was empty," Brooke replied.</p>

  <p>He stood looking around him with some curiosity. The room was barely
  furnished, lit by one common lamp, close to which, upon an uncovered deal
  table, was a worn and battered typewriter. Seated before it was a girl.</p>

  <p>She turned her head at his approach and looked at him. She was very pale,
  but there were about her appearance contradictions which puzzled Brooke. She
  wore a crimson serge dress, which gave her a general impression of
  tawdriness. Her hands were well-shaped and white, however; her hair neatly
  arranged.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The hat which hung on a peg by her side&mdash;a most dejected-looking
  piece of millinery&mdash;was trimmed with flowers of faded brilliance. Still
  when she looked at him, curiously, yet with a certain indifference, he was
  surprised at the quality of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's my sister," the man explained. "She gets a little typing sometimes,
  as you see. One of the offices sends her some work."</p>

  <p>"And what do you do for a living?" Brooke inquired.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Anything," he replied, a little defiantly. "I've been in prison three
  times. I expect I shall be in again before long. Sit down, sir, if you
  will."</p>

  <p>Brooke looked at the one wooden chair and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said, "I'd rather stand. Please be as brief as possible."</p>

  <p>"You've nothing to be afraid of," the man declared, with the first note of
  resentment in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Possibly not," Brooke agreed, watching the girl. "You brought me here,
  though, and I want to know what for."</p>

  <p>The little man cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"It's the house next door," he said. "It's locked up in front&mdash;bolts
  and bars across the window. The back entrance is locked, too. It's been empty
  for months. The Miller Automobile Company had it and failed."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Brooke remarked. "I saw that it was empty&mdash;dust all over the
  windows. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Step this way a moment, sir." Brooke obeyed the summons. The man was
  standing close to the wall by the side of the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"This house and the next one were connected a few years ago," he said.
  "This wall has only been built up lately. It's nothing but lath and plaster.
  Look here." He removed a picture, cut out from some illustrated paper, which
  had been pinned upon the wall. From the spot which it had covered he took out
  a brick, thrust his arm in, and pulled out two more. He laid them softly upon
  the floor. All the time he was almost holding his breath.</p>

  <p>"Stoop down and look!"</p>

  <p>Brooke obeyed him. There was one more brick apparently still remaining,
  but the mortar had slipped away, and from all around it came a little gleam
  of dull light.</p>

  <p>"Get your head as near as you can," Robinson whispered. "Listen!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src=

        title="Illustration by J. Scott William"><br>

  <p>Brooke obeyed. At first he heard nothing, however. There was some sort of
  light in the room, but no sound. He was on the point of withdrawing his head
  when the silence was suddenly broken. A man's voice was heard&mdash;a man's
  voice which seemed to come with queer, rolling regularity. Brooke listened
  hard, but was unable to make out any word. Then there was silence, broken
  almost immediately by the sound of several voices speaking in unison. This
  time there seemed to be no doubt about it. The reply was a sort of monotonous
  chant. One man had spoken and others had replied. Brooke listened with more
  interest. The same thing happened several times. Then again there was
  silence. Brooke stepped away from the wall.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is it all about?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man Robinson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," he said, and his voice sounded weak and faint. "Only, if
  you go down-stairs, you will find that the entrance to the house is locked
  and barred, and the back entrance is locked, too. Neither I nor any one else
  sees people enter. And yet there is that!" Brooke brushed the dust from his
  clothes.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly curious," he admitted. "What do you think about it, young
  lady?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"All that I think of it is," she said, "that it is safer in this world,
  and in this little corner of London, to mind one's own business. That is what
  I tell my brother."</p>

  <p>"Can one live by minding one's own business?" Robinson exclaimed
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh&mdash;I was a gentleman once. I'm anything you like now, down
  to a gutter thief, but I have something of the tastes left. I want
  money&mdash;God knows how I want it!"</p>

  <p>"What is your proposition?" Brooke inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not much of a one, anyway. There's a mystery there, and you're a lover of
  mysteries. I've disclosed it to you, as much as I know of or dare know. Help
  yourself and pay me. It ought to be worth a ten-pound note to you. You're
  rich, they say, and just go round looking for adventures. You can have all
  the adventure you like if you can get into that room. I know nothing about
  it, but I'll guarantee that. Give me a tenner."</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to assist me in any further steps I might take toward the
  elucidation of this affair?" Brooke asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The man began to shake as though he had an ague.</p>

  <p>"Not for my life!" he declared. "I've seen too many queer things in this
  city. If you're curious, I'm not."</p>

  <p>"What about your room here?"</p>

  <p>"Your last visit," Robinson insisted feverishly. "I'm not going to be
  connected with anything that happens. Do you hear? I tell you I won't be I I
  just want a ten-pound note from you, and out you go and forget you've ever
  seen me. And if you want excitement&mdash;my God! you'll have value for your
  money!" Brooke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You are a little mistaken as to my vocation and tastes," he explained. "I
  am not a curious person. If any one consults me, and I can help him, I do so.
  On the other hand, I should say that an affair like this, with which I am not
  connected in any way, is a matter either for the police or for the tenants of
  the flat."</p>

  <p>"You mean you won't do anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, thank you," Brooke replied, taking up his hat. "If you
  will accept a sovereign as a loan or gift or whatever you like to call it, it
  is yours, with pleasure. So far as I am concerned, that is the end of the
  matter."</p>

  <p>The man was obviously disappointed. He accepted the sovereign, however,
  with eagerness.</p>

  <p>"My advice to you would be," Brooke concluded, as he prepared to depart,
  "to give information to the police as to anything that may be going on in the
  next house. They will probably reward you, if your information turns out to
  be worth anything."</p>

  <p>Robinson said nothing, but his face seemed to grow tense.</p>

  <p>"I may have to," he muttered. "I'm up against it. I want money. After all,
  one's life isn't worth much if one starves. Go down quietly, please."</p>

  <p>Brooke turned toward the girl, but she was already bending over her work.
  He lingered upon the threshold. There was a queer sort of tired grace in the
  stiff, unbending lines of her figure.</p>

  <p>"Good night, young lady," he said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" she replied, without raising her head.</p>

  <p>Brooke strolled back down Hender Street into Long Acre and returned to his
  rooms. Once or twice he paused as though to look into a shop-window, but he
  was not able on that night to verify absolutely his suspicions.</p>

  <p>Yet from the moment he left the little house in Hender Street he had the
  impression that he was being followed. The same idea came to him once or
  twice during the next few days. He had always the uncomfortable sense that he
  was under surveillance.</p>

  <p>He thought little more of his visit. There were possibly law-breakers of
  some sort in the place&mdash;very likely by arrangement with the landlord. In
  any case, the affair did not greatly interest him. It was not until the third
  day, when he picked up the morning paper and read that a man named Robinson
  had been found dead on the Embankment, within a dozen paces of Scotland Yard,
  that he felt any real interest in the matter.</p>

  <p>Late that afternoon Brooke found his way once more to the house in Hender
  Street. He passed along the passage, climbed the stairs, and knocked at the
  door. The girl's tired voice bade him enter. She did not rise from her seat.
  She simply glanced around as he entered. He noticed with a little thrill of
  horror that she was still wearing the crimson-colored gown.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she demanded. He closed the door behind him. She
  awaited an answer to her question with her fingers still resting upon the
  keys.</p>

  <p>"Is this true that I have read in the papers about your brother?" he
  inquired gravely.</p>

  <p>"It is true," she answered. "What of it?"</p>

  <p>Brooke was a little staggered. Her utter lifelessness of tone and manner
  was incredible. It was as though she were without feelings or any sort of
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"It is a very terrible thing," he said. "I am very sorry for you."</p>

  <p>"Why are you sorry?" she asked. "And why is it a very terrible thing?
  Death may seem terrible enough to you people who lead happy lives. To us, who
  are facing broken hour after hour upon the wheel, death is the night which is
  all we have to look forward to."</p>

  <p>He sensed a chill in his blood. Somehow he felt that ordinary forms of
  speech were wholly out of place with this remarkable young woman. She had
  leaned a little back in her chair, however, as though willing to desist, for
  a moment, from her labors.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to remain here?" he asked, a little diffidently.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with cold scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"Whether I live here or elsewhere, whether I choose to live at all or to
  die," she remarked, "is no concern of a stranger."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry if I have offended you," he began.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly tell me why you have come?" she interrupted. "You will be
  able to go the sooner."</p>

  <p>"I have come," he explained, "because 1 want to know what you think about
  your brother's death. The papers are divided in their opinion. Some say that
  he fell down and got concussion of the brain; others seem to think that he
  was murdered."</p>

  <p>"If it interests you to know the truth," she said, "he was murdered on his
  way to give information at Scotland Yard about the next house."</p>

  <p>Her matter-of-fact words, delivered in her quiet, tired tone, seemed to
  Brooke the most thrilling he had ever heard. He had never realized more
  completely the presence of tragedy. He moved a little nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he exclaimed; "doesn't this thing move you? Doesn't it seem
  terrible to you? Can you sit there and tell me, without the slightest
  emotion, that your brother was murdered?"</p>

  <p>"He knew very well what would happen," she replied. "He has known for
  weeks what would happen if he approached the police. That is why he chose
  rather to come to you; only, you see, you very wisely declined to meddle in
  an affair which has nothing to do with you."</p>

  <p>"Then what, in God's name, is this affair?" he demanded. "Who are these
  people who murder rather than have information as to their doings given to
  the police? And how did your brother become connected with them?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she replied, "my brother was employed by one of them until he
  was thrown out for unworthiness."</p>

  <p>"For unworthiness?" Brooke muttered. She nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is honor, you know, among thieves and criminals and sinners of
  every description," she said. "My brother had sunk so low that, although he
  was willing to pilfer himself, to rob in any way, to rob with violence if he
  had the strength or the courage, he was yet equally willing to make money by
  giving away those whose sins were of a different order to his. He had sunk so
  low that a man can sink no lower."</p>

  <p>"He is dead!" Brooke whispered, shivering.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you should remember that?"</p>

  <p>"I have no sentiment," she answered scornfully. "For this last year I have
  known him to be one of the lowest things that crawls. You are surprised,
  perhaps, that I am not in black, weeping over his memory. The earth is a
  cleaner place for his absence. That is all that I feel about his death."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps one little spark of admiration," she replied defiantly, "for the
  men who have the courage to remove such as he from their path."</p>

  <p>Brooke had lost his imperturbability. He was horrified, and showed it. He
  tried one counter stroke, however.</p>

  <p>"If," he asked, "your point of view is as you suggest, why do you sit here
  grinding out a miserable living from that battered old typewriter? Why don't
  you join the great crowd of those who fatten upon the fools of the
  earth?"</p>

  <p>She turned and faced him. Something very grim, but which might almost have
  developed into a smile, trembled at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"Because," she told him, "I do not happen to have come into contact with
  any illegal means of earning my livelihood. The ordinary methods of my sex,
  unfortunately, do not appeal to me. I have no ideals, I do not value
  character a straw, but I have certain tastes and preferences, the
  gratification of which keeps me from&mdash;any word you choose to give it,"
  she added, looking him full in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"I speak, perhaps, rather of the past than of the present," she continued.
  "I am older now and a little tired. There were times when I was considered
  good-looking. May I ask whether you intend to keep me much longer answering
  your questions?"</p>

  <p>"I will pay you for your time," Brooke declared bruskly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she replied, "I accept payment for the work I do. This isn't
  work."</p>

  <p>"So you are proud," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"You would like to be a criminal, but you won't take money, you tell
  me."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You belong to those who don't understand," she said shortly. "Any one can
  see that you are half a fool."</p>

  <p>"I am going to prove," Brooke retorted, "that I am a whole one. I am going
  to solve the mystery of the next house."</p>

  <p>For a single second a shadow of something new appeared in her face.</p>

  <p>"If I were you," she advised, "I wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't care to help, then?"</p>

  <p>"I should not!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I listen once more at the wall?"</p>

  <p>"You can do as you like," she answered indifferently.</p>

  <p>Brooke made his way to the spot which Robinson had showed him, carefully
  removed the bricks, and listened. There was, without doubt, some one in the
  adjoining room. One voice only was audible&mdash;the voice of one man
  apparently speaking in a monotonous singsong, as though he were delivering
  some sort of an address.</p>

  <p>Punctuated by those level sentences, every now and then came a fainter
  sound, to which Brooke listened with something like dismay. It was like the
  moan of an animal&mdash;or was it a child in pain&mdash;He replaced the
  bricks.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said to the girl, "whether the police have ever searched
  that house?"</p>

  <p>"Why not save your own skin and go and ask them to?" she suggested. Brooke
  came and stood by the side of her typewriter.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he continued; " I am going through with this little adventure
  myself. Isn't there anything you can tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she asked defiantly. "If they are criminals who meet
  there, why should I be on your side more than theirs? I am a fragment of the
  debris of the world myself."</p>

  <p>"You are not," he answered steadily. "You have courage. I believe that you
  have other gifts."</p>

  <p>She set her teeth.</p>

  <p>"In any case," she declared bruskly, "I have nothing to tell you. If you
  want my advice, you've had it, but I'll give it you again. Don't meddle in
  things that don't concern you."</p>

  <p>"Will you do some typewriting for me?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"At nine-pence a thousand words and three-pence extra for carbon copies,"
  she assented. "I'd rather do it for any one else. That doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"I will take the liberty, then," Brooke replied, moving toward the door,
  "of coming to see you later on."</p>

  <p>Again, as he left the house, Brooke was conscious that he was being
  shadowed. He stopped once or twice and retraced his steps, but he was never
  able definitely to decide whence came the subtle, ever present feeling.</p>

  <p>Finally, with a shrug of the shoulders, he abandoned his half-formed
  intention of examining the premises from the outside and, turning into Long
  Acre, took a taxicab back to his rooms.</p>

  <p>On the hall table was a letter addressed to him in a bold masculine
  handwriting and with a London postmark. He opened it at once. A single line
  written in thick, black ink, with several notes of exclamation, seemed to
  stare up at him from the half-sheet of paper:</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><b><i>Keep away from Hender Street, Mr.
  Brooke!!!!</i></b></p><br>

  <p>Brooke thrust the letter into his pocket. At last he had some definite
  proof that he was not wasting his time. In the morning he paid a visit to the
  house-agents and learned that the empty house in question had been leased to
  the manager of the defunct automobile company, who was now abroad. The
  agreement had one year to run, and the agents had had no notice of any
  sub-letting.</p>

  <p>Brooke walked from their offices to Hender Street. Without any attempt at
  concealment, he examined the front of the house. It was not only locked and
  barricaded, but there was dust upon the fastenings. He made his way to the
  back entrance. The gate leading into the little strip of asphalt was fastened
  with a chain. There was no sign that it had been disturbed for a long
  time.</p>

  <p>He made his way to the front again. Suddenly the door of the adjoining
  house was opened and a man was literally thrown into the street. Brooke
  caught a glimpse of a negro in the background&mdash;a stern and
  ferocious-looking figure. Then the door was closed.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"

         title="Illustration by J. Scott William">
  </div>

  <p>A thin, weedy-looking young man picked himself up from the ground, took
  off his spectacles to be sure that they were not broken, and began to knock
  the dust off his clothes. He saw Brooke regarding him with astonishment, and
  smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Just my luck to run up against this sort of thing!" he exclaimed. "All in
  the day's work, though."</p>

  <p>"Did you annoy any one?" Brooke inquired.</p>

  <p>"It seems so," the young man answered.</p>

  <p>"I am a reporter on the <i>Weekly Post</i>, and I went to interview Kinsey
  Brand."</p>

  <p>"The African traveler?" Brooke asked quickly.</p>

  <p>The young man nodded. They had fallen into step together and set their
  faces southward.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "That was his servant who just hurried me out. He's got
  two of them. He need never be afraid of burglars with two beauties like that
  on the premises!"</p>

  <p>"Better have a drink," Brooke suggested&mdash;"pull you together."</p>

  <p>The young man assented readily. They entered a bar and sat on high
  stools.</p>

  <p>"What did you want to interview Kinsey Brand about?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they say he's brought home a new religion&mdash;discovered it among
  the natives, where they have been practising it for two thousand years," the
  young man continued.</p>

  <p>"All the magazines have tried to get him to write about it, but he won't,
  and every reporter in London has tried to get at him, unsuccessfully. They
  generally end where I did!"</p>

  <p>"This," Brooke murmured, "is very interesting." The young man felt his
  back.</p>

  <p>"What I should like to do," he declared, "would be to get Jack Johnson to
  stroll in there with a note-book and ask him a few questions. As a matter of
  fact, I never saw Kinsey Brand at all. I was just giving the negro half a
  sovereign when I heard a voice that sounded like a bellow, and out I
  went."</p>

  <p>"Queer place for the man to live," Brooke remarked.</p>

  <p>"He's got a bit of money, too, I should think," the reporter continued.
  "Lots of skins and things about the place. Smelled like a corner of the
  zoological gardens."</p>

  <p>"What is this religion&mdash;do you know?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"No idea," the young man answered. "Seems to make 'em tolerably muscular!
  The only reporter who got Brand to say a word was Ted Foales, of the
  <i>Express</i>. He told him that all he wanted to do was to be left alone;
  that he wanted neither converts nor critics."</p>

  <p>"It's not a money-making job, then," Brooke remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"About the only religion that ain't," the young man murmured, looking into
  the bottom of his empty glass. "I don't know that I blame 'em, either. If I'd
  got a brand-new religion to foist on the world, I'd run it for all it was
  worth. One would be able to stand a gentleman a drink then, in return for any
  little civility one might receive." Brooke took the hint and the young man's
  glass was replenished.</p>

  <p>"Between you and me," the latter said, moving his stool a little closer to
  Brooke's,</p>

  <p>"if I had the time and the money and the physique and the courage I should
  like to stick to this Kinsey Brand. There are some queer stories going
  about.</p>

  <p>"They say he went mad on the voyage home from West Africa, and that he
  brought home a negro and a native priest. If so, he's got 'em in that house.
  While I was there I heard a man making noises in a tongue which made you feel
  as though you were in a monkey forest. The only visitors he ever has are
  three or four old cronies, all West Africans, and they almost live in the
  place."</p>

  <p>"It all sounds very mysterious."</p>

  <p>"I was too scared to look about me much," the young man continued; "but
  just inside that passage what do you think there was, hanging down from the
  ceiling? A long, double-edged knife, hung by a piece of gold thread! The
  knife was stained all over, and I'll swear it was blood. Nice, cheerful sight
  to greet you when you step in!"</p>

  <p>"I should imagine," Brooke remarked, "that Mr. Kinsey Brand's instincts
  are not hospitable."</p>

  <p>The young man grunted.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I've done with him," he declared. "Any one else can take up the
  job!"</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock that night Brooke sat in his rooms with an open letter and
  a pile of newspapers by his side. The former he had just received from the
  librarian of a large book-shop from whom he made occasional purchases. It was
  not very long, but its contents were interesting:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR SIR:<br>
  I am sending you the file of papers, procured with great difficulty, and I
  beg that you will take every care of them. It is a very remarkable
  circumstance that the letters from Mr. Kinsey Brand, for which the
  <i>Times</i> was paying a large sum, ceased abruptly on the eve of his
  projected visit to one of the most interesting spots in Africa. Since then,
  notwithstanding the large offers which have been made to him, Mr. Kinsey
  Brand has not, so far as we know, set his hand to paper at all, either in the
  form of articles or volume. It is understood that his health was affected by
  privations, and that he had no further inclination to write of his travels.
  The affair, however, is in some respects mysterious, and I may say that many
  efforts have been made, even up to the last few weeks, to obtain some
  explanation.</p>

  <p class="letter">Faithfully yours,<br>
  S. CLOWES.</p>

  <p>The interest of the newspapers culminated in the issue of latest date. For
  the second or third time Brooke was reading some extracts of a letter written
  about two years ago and signed "Kinsey Brand":</p>

  <p class="letter">To-morrow I expect to reach the holy village of Nah-u-weh.
  If reports are true, I shall have an opportunity there of studying the
  primeval religion of these Western tribes, founded, they say, upon a
  contemplation of the extinction of life. They make a cult of watching the
  death struggles of animals and, on certain days of the year, human beings.
  The soul, as it escapes, is declared to be visible to the priest, who is able
  to transmit by it messages to the Supreme Being. This, however, is all
  hearsay. I shall know more about it in my next letter.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Brooke's servant entered, bearing a note.
  Brooke took it and glanced at it, carelessly at first and then with a sudden
  interest. It was addressed to him in typewritten characters, and in the
  corner it was marked&amp;mdash "Urgent." He tore it open and read the
  following:</p><br>

  <p class="note"><tt>MR. BROOKE:</tt></p>

  <p class="note"><tt>If you are still interested in the house next door, you
  had better come here at once. Some thing is going on at the other side of the
  wall. It seems to me that they have discovered the opening and are enlarging
  it from their side.</tt></p>

  <p class="note"><tt>CONSTANCE ROBINSON.</tt></p><br>

  <p>Brooke sprang to his feet, made a few hasty preparations, took a taxicab
  to the corner of Hender Street, passed up the passage and the stairs, and
  knocked at the door above. There was no reply. He turned the handle and
  entered. The room was empty.</p>

  <p>On the floor was the typewriter, lying on its side, broken. By the side of
  the wall were half a dozen loose bricks and a quantity of plaster. There was
  a hole in the wall, stuffed up with paper, large enough for a man to pass
  through. Brooke stood for a moment, rooted to the spot. Caught on a corner of
  the fender was a torn fragment of something red. He recognized it at
  once&mdash;it was a portion of the girl's dress.</p>

  <p>Then, as he stood there slowly collecting his senses, he distinctly heard
  a low, half-stifled moan from the interior of the room beyond. The sound
  suddenly awakened his energies. He scarcely paused for thought.</p>

  <p>He tore off his overcoat and coat, threw himself on all fours, and made
  one plunge at the mass of paper which alone blocked the opening. He was
  through in a moment and on his feet in the room on the other side of the wall
  before any one could seize him.</p>

  </div>

  <p>For a few seconds there was a grim and ghastly silence. Brooke looked
  around him wildly. The apartment was unfurnished, save that the floor was
  covered with thick rugs, and three benches were placed near the farther wall.
  There were six men present altogether, three of whom were sitting with folded
  arms upon the farthest bench. They had the air and attitude of
  spectators.</p>

        title="Illustration by J. Scott Williams">

  <p>Directly facing them was a man as black as ink, dressed in a yellow robe,
  and holding a long knife of thin blue steel in his hand; not far off stood a
  gaunt, strange-looking person, with parchment-white skin and burning eyes,
  whom Brooke recognized in an instant, from his pictures, as Kinsey Brand, the
  explorer. Behind the two men a gigantic negro was standing with lamps in his
  hands, and in front of them the girl, bound with cords which cut deeply into
  her dress, was lying stretched upon a block of wood.</p>

  <p>Her face was absolutely colorless, her eyes black and staring.</p>

  <p>There was a curious, sickly odor which seemed to come from the lamps which
  the negro was swinging. All these things were before Brooke like a flash. For
  some reason or other, probably owing to the fact that the ceremony at which
  they were assisting had reached what to them was its most impressive stage,
  no one stirred from his place during those few seconds. Brooke had time to
  withdraw his hand from his hip pocket. He stood there with his feet firmly
  planted upon the ground and his back to the walk In his hand the revolver
  glittered like silver in the light of the red flame. Then, without removing
  his eyes from the priest, he shouted as though to unseen followers.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you men! I've got them! They are all here! See that the house is
  surrounded!"</p>

  <p>The priest, for such he seemed to be, suddenly raised the knife which he
  was holding and crouched as though for a spring at the intruder. Brooke, who
  had never shot at a human being in his life, felt scarcely a tremor as he
  pulled the trigger of his revolver and saw the man go swaying over with a
  hideous cry and his hands above his head.</p>

  <p>His downfall, the flash and report of the revolver, seemed to spread
  confusion among the remaining occupants of the room. The three spectators,
  followed by the negro, rushed for the door. Brand remained for a single
  moment glaring at Brooke.</p>

  <p>Then he muttered something, something which sounded to Brooke at first
  like gibberish, and afterward like music, something which ended in a little
  impressive cry&mdash;a denunciation, perhaps, for one hand was lifted to the
  ceiling. Then he, too, turned and left, walking with a strange dignity.</p>

  <p>Brooke, for the first few seconds, was dazed. Then he seized the knife and
  commenced to cut the cords which bound the girl. Once he paused. The
  atmosphere had become unbearable.</p>

  <p>The sound below was unmistakable&mdash;the crackling and roaring of
  flames. He glanced at the window. A long tongue of red fire had shot up. He
  hacked furiously at the rope. The girl was almost fainting.</p>

  <p>"Get through the hole," he begged, "if you can. Can you crawl?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. He dragged her toward the opening. As he pushed her through he
  glanced back. A great zigzag crack had spread itself out across the opposite
  wall and a hissing puff of smoke rushed in. Outside he could hear the calls
  in the streets and the throb of the fire-engine. The girl seemed suddenly
  inert. She was only halfway through.</p>

  <p>"Make an effort!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>She disappeared. He flung himself into the opening. He, too, reached the
  other side. The girl was half on her feet, swaying.</p>

  <p>"Don't faint," he implored.</p>

  <p>"Cling to me. We must make a rush for the stairs."</p>

  <p>"Who said anything about fainting?" she replied.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>They rushed for the stairs, his arm around her. Below they could hear the
  crashing of hatchets as the firemen forced their way into the next house. A
  volume of smoke met them, but they reached the street in safety. The crowds
  of people closing in on either side cheered as they emerged from the house
  and made way. Some one helped her into a taxi. They drove off. She was only
  half conscious.</p>

  <p>"My typewriter!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"We'll get a new one from the insurance company," Brooke whispered
  comfortingly,</p>

  <p>"Keep your courage up for a minute or two."</p>

  <p>Her lips moved, but she had no strength to speak. Brooke drove to a
  nursing home, where the matron was a friend of his, and where they willingly
  took her in. At eleven o'clock the next morning Brooke called at the
  nursing-home. The girl was lying on the sofa in her room. She looked at him
  steadily as he came and sat by her side.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The two Africans were burned," he told her quietly. "They had planned to
  destroy the place by fire if anything happened, but the flames spread too
  quickly and their own escape was cut off."</p>

  <p>"What about the man Brand?"</p>

  <p>"He was found dead in his room."</p>

  <p>"And the three spectators?"</p>

  <p>"They must have got away," he replied. "There were no other casualties.
  Tell me what happened."</p>

  <p>"I was sitting at work," she said, "when I heard them boring at the wall.
  I wrote a note and went down into the street to find a boy to take it to you.
  When I got back the African was in the room. He seized me, put something over
  my mouth and dragged me through to the other side of the wall.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"They tied me to that block and chanted all sorts of strange things I
  couldn't understand. Just as you appeared the priest had lifted that knife as
  though he were going to stab me, and I heard Kinsey Brand cry out in English:
  'Watch for her soul!'"</p>

  <p>Brooke shuddered.</p>

  <p>"They were all as mad as men could be," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Will it be in the papers?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No one would believe it! We'd better keep it to ourselves. Both houses
  were burned to the ground&mdash;completely destroyed."</p>

  <p>She breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"What about my typewriter? asked weakly.</p>

  <p>"Burned to ashes, and about time too," he replied briskly. "The 'g'
  crooked and the 'w' had a twist in the middle. You shall have a brand-new one
  and plenty of work as soon as you are able to start."</p>

  <p>She fidgeted for a moment and frowned. Then she sighed. There was
  something a little pathetic in the abnegation of her ill manners.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," she said, her voice shaking a little, "you have been
  very kind indeed. You saved my life, too. I wanted to die, but not&mdash;like
  that!"</p>

  <p>"You've got to make up your mind that it was all just a dream&mdash;a
  nightmare, if you like," Brooke declared cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"The program is three days here, three weeks at a branch of this place at
  Bournemouth. After that as much typewriting as you like. I can get you
  bushels of work."</p>

  <p>She covered her eyes with her handkerchief as though weary. Her lips
  trembled. Brooke stole away.</p>

  <h2>THE MURDER OF WILLIAM BLESSING</h2>

  <h4>BEING THE FOURTH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Mar 1914, with illustrations
  by W. B. King</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Hon. Stanley Brooke leaned back in his steamer-chair and
  yawned. A pleasant and bracing west wind blew in his face the white-topped
  waves were all aglint with sunshine. His surroundings were altogether
  delightful. There was, in fact, only one circumstance which made him inclined
  to regret this suddenly arranged trip across the Atlantic. This was his third
  day out, and he was bored.</p>

  <p>The usual distractions were offered him.</p>

  <p>"Care to make a fourth at shuffleboard, sir?" a bare-headed young man
  asked, pausing tentatively before his chair and brandishing a fearful looking
  implement with a scooped-out end.</p>

  <p>Brooke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not very keen on deck games," he confessed; "thanks all the
  same."</p>

  <p>A head was thrust out from the smoking-room window. Its owner caught
  Brooke's eye.</p>

  <p>"Will you come and make us up at bridge?" one of his table companions
  asked.</p>

  <p>Brooke refused even more decidedly.</p>

  <p>"I never play cards until after dinner," he declared.</p>

  <p>He was left alone presently and fell to studying the people as they
  passed. He was beginning to realize that lately all other interests in life
  had become with him subordinate to this.</p>

  <p>He appreciated the elasticity of one's powers of observation when properly
  ministered to, the possibility of tragedy and crime beneath the smoothest and
  most commonplace exterior. He had developed a habit of watchfulness. The
  lines about his mouth had tightened.</p>

  <p>It was more of an effort with him now to assume that bland aspect of
  juvenile imbecility which had stood him more than once in such good stead.
  Yet it certainly seemed that upon this voyage there was little enough to
  engage his interest. The boat was a medium-sized one and not one of the
  fastest. The people were mostly Americans of the tourist type, a handful of
  business men&mdash;and Gordon Black. Brooke, whenever he tried to think of
  any one of them, found himself always thinking of Black.</p>

  <p>The man passed as he sat there&mdash;tall, hard-featured, his hands
  clasped behind him, his eyes bent upon the deck. The invalid who lay flat in
  a chair by Brooke's side stretched out a hand and touched his neighbor on the
  coat-sleeve.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration by W. B. King"
        title="Illustration by W. B. King">

  <p>"Tell me," he asked in a quavering voice, "is that really Mr. Gordon
  Black?"</p>

  <p>"That is his name," Brooke replied. "He looks rather an interesting
  character. Do you know anything about him?"</p>

  <p>The little man looked at his questioner wonderingly. He was a small, frail
  person, with white hair and wasted face, and there were rumors that he was
  dying. He had been carried on board at Southampton, and he only appeared on
  deck for an hour at a time.</p>

  <p>"Know anything about Gordon Black!" he repeated. "Why, a year or two ago
  he was the most talked-of man in the States!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Brooke asked. "Is he a celebrity, then?"</p>

  <p>The little man&mdash;he called himself Dr. Browning, but admitted that he
  was only a dentist&mdash;sighed.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you're English," he remarked, "and you wouldn't read our
  papers. Gordon Black was the head of a great railroad trust. He ran up
  against another trust, controlled by Seth Pryor, and they had the greatest
  financial struggle that the history of American finance has ever known.</p>

  <p>"In the end. Black was maneuvered into a false position. He broke the law
  and had to leave the country. It has always been understood that there was
  some sort of an agreement between him and his enemies that, if he left, his
  followers should be spared. That's the idea, at any rate.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, during the last two months Seth Pryor has suddenly begun to
  squeeze Black's followers. Black is on his way back to fight him, and Seth
  Pryor has sworn that as soon as he sets foot in New York he'll have him
  arrested."</p>

  <p>"It sounds interesting," Brooke confessed.</p>

  <p>"It is interesting," the other declared. "It's a romance, sir&mdash;a
  wonderful romance. I have never spoken to Mr. Gordon Black myself, but he is
  going back to face the music because he thinks it his duty, and for my part I
  hope he pulls through."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes with the air of one
  fatigued by conversation. Brooke took up his book and set it down again.
  Afterward he decided that it must have been some mesmeric instinct which
  prompted him at that precise moment to struggle up from his comfortable seat,
  throw aside his rug, and stroll along the deck.</p>

  <p>On his second time around he came to an abrupt standstill at the aft
  extremity of the promenade-deck. A few yards away from him, but in the
  second-class portion of the ship, a girl, whose profile was turned toward
  him, was leaning over the rail, bending far forward with folded arms, in an
  attitude which seemed to him somehow familiar.</p>

  <p>He stood perfectly still, watching her, and then a curious thing happened.
  The thrill was doubtless caused by the recollection of those few breathless
  moments of life and death through which they two had lived together, but it
  is certain that Brooke felt suddenly the rush of warm blood through his veins
  and the singing of strange things around his heart. Without a moment's
  hesitation he crossed the narrow plankway and stepped to her side.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson!" he exclaimed eagerly. "It really is you, then!"</p>

  <p>She turned and looked at him. She was a little startled. Taken so
  completely by surprise, she seemed to forget for the moment her somewhat
  uncompromising attitude. Her beautiful eyes were lit with something very like
  pleasure, her lips parted into almost tender Hues. The moment was a
  revelation. For the first time Brooke realized that she was beautiful.</p>

  <p>"It really is you, then," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"But what on earth?" he began. "I thought you were going to a post in the
  country."</p>

  <p>Already her manner was stiffening. A touch of the old sullenness was in
  her tone. She had been taken by surprise.</p>

  <p>"A new country," she corrected him. "I am tired of England."</p>

  <p>"You are going to America for good?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," she replied. "I am an emigrant."</p>

  <p>"I think that you might have told me," he protested.</p>

  <p>She was already in revolt.</p>

  <p>"And why?" she demanded. "I have already accepted charity from you. I have
  lived for twenty-four years in England, twelve of which have been blankly
  miserable. I am going to start again."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to New York?"</p>

  <p>"To New York," she assented.</p>

  <p>"You have a position?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. She answered him grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"I have a place," she admitted. "Forgive me, but you must go now.
  First-class passengers are not allowed here."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said deliberately, "why you treat me as though I wanted to
  pick your pocket. I want to be your friend."</p>

  <p>She turned away, her manner reluctantly ungracious.</p>

  <p>"It is not possible," she said. "My friendship, anyhow, isn't worth
  having. Good-by!"</p>

  <p>She disappeared through the companionway. Brooke retraced his steps slowly
  to his own deck. As he crossed the bridge he was conscious of being watched.
  He raised his eyes. Mr. Gordon Black was leaning over the rail, deeply
  interested now in the uncoiling of a rope below.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT night, or rather in the small hours of the morning, the
  silence of the great ship was broken by the sound of hurrying footsteps along
  the passage outside Brooke's stateroom, a hoarse murmuring of voices, the
  flying feet of an urgent messenger. Brooke put his head out of the alleyway
  leading to his cabin.</p>

  <p>"Anything the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The steward whom he addressed seemed scarcely to hear him. Brooke made his
  way to the spot where the little group was congregated. Something dark was
  stretched across the passageway. Brooke looked down upon it with a
  shudder.</p>

  <p>It was the body of a man&mdash;a crumpled-up heap, with the head half
  covered by one distorted arm. His white lips, from which the last groan had
  issued, were still parted. He could have been dead only a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"Did any one see it happen?" Brooke demanded.</p>

  <p>No one answered. No one even seemed capable of speech. Brooke turned on
  another of the electric lights and looked up and down the dimly lit gangway.
  There was not a soul in sight. The doors of every one of the adjacent
  staterooms were closed. The place seemed wrapped in gloomy silence; there was
  nothing to be heard but the thud and roar of the engines below. The only
  people in sight were the three who stooped over the body&mdash;Brooke's own
  bedroom steward, a bathroom steward, and a boy from the engine room still
  carrying a handful of waste.</p>

  <p>"Didn't any one see it happen?" Brooke repeated.</p>

  <p>The bedroom steward staggered to his feet and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I passed along here not three minutes ago, sir," he declared, "and there
  wasn't a sign of any one. I just put away some hot-water tins in the closet
  there. While I was doing it I thought I heard a funny noise. I came back
  again&mdash;and he was lying here. I couldn't have been away altogether more
  than sixty seconds."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who he is?" Brooke inquired.</p>

  <p>"He's got the end stateroom a little further along," the bath-room steward
  declared.</p>

  <p>"I dunno his name."</p>

  <p>Brooke looked steadily down, trying to fix the little scene in his memory.
  The man was lying on the right-hand side of the gangway and had, therefore,
  probably been attacked from the left. The blow on his head, too, was on that
  side. His coat was open and a letter was protruding from it. His right hand
  lay across his chest, as though he had striven to clutch at something there.
  There were few other details worth noticing.</p>

  <p>Then the captain arrived, followed by the doctor, and presently Brooke
  retreated to his cabin.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">A BRUTAL murder committed upon an ocean steamer on the high
  seas, where the passengers rely for their casual conversation upon an
  occasional marconigram or fragments of gossip concerning one another, is
  naturally an absorbing subject of discussion.</p>

  <p>From early morning until the bugle sounded for luncheon all games were
  suspended and all conversation rang the different changes around this most
  extraordinary and dramatic happening. Brooke threw himself thoroughly into
  the role of careful and attentive listener. Apart from all manner of vague
  rumors, however, all that was definitely known was trivial. The man's name
  was Blessing. He was of cheerful and sociable disposition, and appeared to
  have talked to every one on board.</p>

  <p>He had never mentioned his profession, but a card in his pocketbook bore
  the inscription of "Agent," with an address at an office on Broadway.</p>

  <p>He had never been seen to quarrel with any one.</p>

  <p>The half-torn letter in his pocket was domestic and unimportant.</p>

  <p>The staterooms opposite the spot where he had been found were empty with
  the exception of two, one of which was occupied by a Mr. Baines, who was with
  the doctor in his room at the time the affair occurred; and the other by Dr.
  Browning. Robbery was an impossible motive, as the murdered man had frankly
  confessed himself short of money, had made application to the purser for a
  loan, and had despatched a marconigram for a clerk to meet him on the quay
  with funds.</p>

  <p>The cause of death was a blow dealt with some blunt instrument which was
  not forthcoming.</p>

  <p>Brooke listened to the gossip, listened to what every one had to say, and
  made a few inquiries on his own account. They led him, however, to nothing in
  the shape of a definite conclusion. Then, a little later, while talking with
  the captain in his room, the latter handed him a marconigram.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It was addressed to Blessing. Under the circumstances, I felt justified
  in opening it."</p>

  <p>Brooke glanced at the flimsy sheet. It consisted only of a few
  words:</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><tt><small>LOOK OUT: T IS ON BOARD.</small></tt></p><br>

  <p>"Unsigned," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," the captain replied. "If we only knew who sent it, we
  might know who 'T' was."</p>

  <p>"And 'T,'" Brooke added, "might be sitting in irons at this present
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the captain agreed dryly. "I don't like these things on my
  boat. I'm not a detective. I can't detain my passengers. The murderer will
  probably walk off the gangway at New York and no one will be able to stop
  him. I may even shake hands with him without knowing it."</p>

  <p>"Hard luck!" Brooke declared. "Try one of these."</p>

  <p>The captain accepted one of his visitor's cigarettes and parted from him,
  a few minutes later, without any very exalted opinion of his young friend's
  intelligence. Brooke paced slowly down the deck with his hands behind him. As
  he neared the spot where, on the preceding day, he had seen Constance
  Robinson, he glanced up. She was leaning against the rail in almost the same
  position, only this time she had turned a little sidewise. She was facing
  him, and, as he raised his cap in salutation, she beckoned him to her. He
  crossed the dividing bridge at once and stood by her side.</p>

  <p>"You've heard about the murder, of course?" she asked bruskly.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Brooke admitted. She looked at him for a moment, a grim smile
  upon her lips.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," she went on. "The solution of crime is rather in your line,
  isn't it? Solve this one."</p>

  <p>"I can't," Brooke confessed.</p>

  <p>"Who murdered Mr. Blessing?"</p>

  <p>"No idea!"</p>

  <p>"And you on the spot!" she exclaimed derisively. "Fancy calling yourself a
  man of observation!"</p>

  <p>Brooke looked at her steadfastly. Without a doubt she was a different
  person. Her hair, a little disordered in the wind, was unexpectedly
  luxuriant; her dark, splendid eyes were lit with gentle laughter; the glow of
  a new health was already stealing into her cheeks. In her plain,
  tight-fitting, blue serge costume, her entire absence of ornaments, she
  appealed to him in a subtle and entirely novel way.</p>

  <p>"In this instance," he said simply, "I am afraid that I must confess
  myself a failure. I have made a great many inquiries, but they have led
  nowhere. Perhaps you can help me?"</p>

  <p>She suddenly became grave.</p>

  <p>"As it happens," she replied, "I can. Come nearer."</p>

  <p>He stood close to her side. A few yards away an Italian squatted, playing
  a concertina; four men were throwing quoits; a mother was sitting with her
  three children. Constance glanced around and drew him to the side of the
  boat.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blessing was murdered by a man named Gordon Black," she told him.
  "Perhaps, as I can tell you the name of the guilty person, you can do the
  rest."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" Brooke asked. She frowned.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blessing was my new employer," she told him. "He was a private
  detective in New York. I did some typing for him, and he formed the idea that
  I was intelligent enough to be of use to him permanently."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Gordon Black?"</p>

  <p>"I know that Mr. Blessing had been to England to collect evidence against
  him for complicity in the Jersey River Railway scandal, whatever that may be,
  and I know that he had succeeded. That evidence was in Mr. Blessing's
  possession when he boarded the steamer. I expect it is in Gordon Black's
  now!"</p>

  <p>"I think," Brooke suggested, "that you had better come with me to the
  captain."</p>

  <p>"What is the use?" she replied impatiently. "There is work to be done
  yet&mdash;your share of the work. I have pointed out the man. It is for you
  to forge the links. You start knowing who he is. You have only to work a
  little way backward."</p>

  <p>"All the same," Brooke persisted, "I think that you ought to come with me
  to the captain."</p>

  <p>"I'll come when I think best," she answered tersely. "Gordon Black has
  seen me with Mr. Blessing. If he sees me with you on the way to the captain
  he'll suspect something. See what you can do on your own. I'll come in
  afterward. "I'll tell you this much more, if you like. Less than forty-eight
  hours ago Gordon Black offered Mr. Blessing twenty-five thousand pounds for a
  document in his possession&mdash;an illegal transfer, or something of the
  sort. Mr. Blessing refused. He was acting for a client&mdash;Gordon Black's
  great enemy."</p>

  <p>Brooke made his way back to his own part of the ship. He spent nearly an
  hour in putting a few cautious inquiries. Then he rejoined Constance, who was
  still sitting in her corner reading, and who watched his approach with
  evident displeasure.</p>

  <p>"You are very foolish," she said, as she put her book down, "to come over
  here so often. I have told you that Gordon Black has seen Mr. Blessing
  talking to me. He will be on his guard."</p>

  <p>"It does not appear to be of much consequence," Brooke remarked. "Listen.
  There is no doubt whatever as to the time when the murder took place. It was
  between half past eleven and five and twenty to twelve."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"From ten o'clock until the news of the affair was brought there Black was
  playing bridge in the smoking-room."</p>

  <p>The girl frowned.</p>

  <p>"Is that certain?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he assured her. "I have it from the smoking-room steward,
  and Major Bryce&mdash;who was one of the four. Without a doubt he was in the
  smoking-room when the affair took place."</p>

  <p>She seemed a little staggered. For a few moments she said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Failing Mr. Gordon Black," Brooke continued, "I presume you have no other
  suggestions? I'm getting rather keen." She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It must have been Gordon Black," she declared.</p>

  <p>"But the man has a perfect, a truthful alibi," Brooke ventured to point
  out.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it," she persisted obstinately.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Blessing told me himself that he was afraid of him. Those papers
  included a forged transfer. He meant having them. He had offered Mr. Blessing
  twenty-five thousand pounds for them and was refused."</p>

  <p>Brooke pointed to a school of porpoises.</p>

  <p>"Let us talk about something else," he suggested. "What are you going to
  do when you get to New York?"</p>

  <p>"Give evidence against Gordon Black at his trial for murder, I hope," she
  replied doggedly. "Afterward&mdash;well, I shall find something."</p>

  <p class="first">WHEN Brooke returned to his chair he found that his invalid
  neighbor had been brought on deck and was lying in the next one, smothered
  over with rugs. Brooke spoke to him pleasantly, and would have passed on but
  for the other's obvious disappointment.</p>

  <p>"You're going to sit down for a few minutes, aren't you?" the fellow piped
  out, his thin voice shriller and weaker than ever. "I've had a bad night, and
  I'm nervous this morning. Say, what day do you reckon we shall fetch New
  York?" Brooke seated himself. The cheering up of the man seemed to be a
  charge upon the whole ship's company.</p>

  <p>"About Friday morning," he replied cheerfully. "Nothing to make us late
  that I can see."</p>

  <p>The little man began to count upon his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Let me see&mdash;to-day is Tuesday. Then there's Wednesday and
  Thursday&mdash;two whole days! I reckon I'll last that long&mdash;somehow,"
  he added wistfully. Brooke laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"Of course you will," he declared encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Why, I heard you walked across the deck alone yesterday morning!" Dr.
  Browning smiled&mdash;a little vaingloriously.</p>

  <p>"Not all the way&mdash;very nearly as far as the rail," he admitted. "My
  book blew away."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a few minutes, looking out across the sea.</p>

  <p>"You know," he continued, "when I started on this voyage I wasn't afraid,
  because I felt that I'd just as soon die at sea as anywhere else. I took kind
  of a fancy to end it all out here. Directly I got on board and looked through
  a port-hole I changed my mind, though. Queer thing, eh? I was afraid!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't think about it at all, if I were you," Brooke advised. "Make
  up your mind that you're going to get better. That's the way."</p>

  <p>A queer little smile flickered for a moment upon the gray lips. The man's
  face was almost ghastly.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any chance of that," he said simply. "I'd like to live out
  the voyage&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>"Have you friends who are meeting you in New York?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," the other answered. "I cannot say for certain. My people live
  out in the West."</p>

  <p>The purser came along and paused to talk cheerfully for a few minutes to
  the ship's invalid. Afterward a benevolent old lady brought up her camp-stool
  to his side. Brooke lay with half-closed eyes, looking out upon the sea.</p>

  <p>His thoughts wandered from the pathetic little figure by his side to Mr.
  Gordon Black, who was strolling up and down the deck smoking a cigar. Brooke
  felt a peculiar interest in studying the dark, handsome face.</p>

  <p>That the man had been a bold adventurer, a buccaneer of finance, was true
  without a doubt. Was there really the shadow of that ghastly crime concealed
  behind the mask of those set features and level brows?</p>

  <p>He stood smoking his cigar stolidly, one hand grasping the rail of the
  steamer, his eyes fixed upon the silver streak which fringed the horizon.
  Brooke felt that this quiet sea voyage had been touched unexpectedly with the
  hand of tragedy, and try how he would to put him in the background of his
  thoughts, this man stood out the central figure in it. There was a shrill
  blast from the foghorn; they had passed into a little bank of white mist.
  Immediately afterward a cabin steward came up, looked around the deck for a
  moment, and, finally advancing to Gordon Black, touched him on the shoulder
  and presented him with a note.</p>

  <p>"For me?" Brooke heard him ask.</p>

  <p>"Left in your cabin, sir," the man replied, as he turned away.</p>

  <p>Brooke watched his neighbor break the seal of the letter and read its
  contents. They seemed to consist of a few lines only, yet the seconds passed
  into minutes and the eyes of the reader were still riveted upon the
  half-sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>He seemed at first a little dazed; he had the appearance of a man who
  struggles with a message sent him in some foreign language. Then Brooke saw
  the blanching of the man's cheeks, the sudden shiver, the quick, stern effort
  to recover his self-control. There was no longer any doubt. Tragedy and Mr.
  Gordon Black walked hand in hand!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">BROOKE went back again to Constance Robinson that evening.
  He found her promenading alone on the lower deck, her hands clasped behind
  her back. She welcomed him with a smile which, dubious though it was, gave
  him an unreasonable amount of pleasure. He fell into step by her side. It was
  a dark, windy night and the sea sang to them.</p>

  <p>"Any progress?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"None to speak of," he admitted frankly. "I fancy I'm not lucky this
  time."</p>

  <p>She turned upon him almost fiercely.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how you dare mention the word to me!" she exclaimed. "You have
  just the glimmering of an idea as to what my life has been up to now. Well, I
  get another chance&mdash;a good salary&mdash;a new profession in a new
  country&mdash;and this is what happens. My employer is murdered on the way
  out. I haven't even drawn my first week's pay!"</p>

  <p>"No good brooding over it," Brooke remarked briskly. "You've health and
  strength, and you're bound for a country where those things count. Do you
  mind going a little slower? It's a treat to see you walk, but I'm out of
  breath."</p>

  <p>She slackened her pace at once. She had been walking with the long, free
  paces and swift-footed grace of some forest animal. She glanced doubtfully at
  her companion. His tone seemed to indicate a certain change in his attitude
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I'm not afraid," she declared. "I'll find work&mdash;only&mdash;I
  wish to God, when I start out to look for it, that I were a man!"</p>

  <p>He understood, and this time was silent. The mood passed, and he was
  careful to take no advantage of it. Presently she stopped at the end of the
  deck nearest to the first-class quarters.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" she said. "I'm sorry you're not succeeding."</p>

  <p>"By the bye," he asked, "you didn't, by any chance, send a note to Mr.
  Gordon Black, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;Of course not! Why?"</p>

  <p>"He had one from some one which upset him pretty badly."</p>

  <p>"Find out who sent it," she insisted eagerly.</p>

  <p>"My idea," he replied. "I was just waiting till I'd spoken to you."</p>

  <p>"It's very likely the beginning of negotiations," she declared. "Remember
  that whoever killed poor Mr. Blessing, even if it wasn't Gordon Black, has
  those papers and the forged transfers." Brooke sighed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he said, "they'll begin to tumble to me soon, but I'll do my
  best."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">THE next day they ran into a storm. The skies were leaden,
  the ship developed a very ugly pitch, the decks were deserted, swept with
  rain and spray. The steamer-chairs, even on the covered deck, were lashed to
  a rail. The whole outlook was unspeakably dreary. About eleven o'clock a
  cabin steward came to Brooke in the smoking-room.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said. "Dr. Browning, the old gentleman who is
  ill, would take it as a great favor if you would step down to his stateroom
  for a moment. The poor gentleman's very bad indeed, sir," he added
  confidentially. "Don't look as though he'd last the day."</p>

  <p>"Sure he meant me?" Brooke asked, a little puzzled. "I've only spoken to
  him once or twice on deck."</p>

  <p>"Certain, sir," the man replied. "He wanted to speak to you most
  particular." Brooke made his way down below at once. The little man was lying
  half-dressed upon the sofa berth and his appearance was ghastly. He motioned
  Brooke to close the door.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to find you queer," the latter remarked cheerfully. "This weather's
  enough to knock any one over."</p>

  <p>"I'm nearly done." was the reply. "I didn't reckon upon this. Please
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do for you&mdash;" Brooke began.</p>

  <p>"Two nights ago," Dr. Browning interrupted, "the man Blessing was murdered
  just outside my stateroom there&mdash;only a few feet away, mind. I was lying
  where I am now. I heard the scuffle, the blow, the groan."</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens!" Brooke exclaimed. "You didn't see the fellow, did
  you?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head. He was speaking with the utmost difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I saw nothing, but I heard the fall of something just outside my door,
  which was about a foot open. I dragged myself there. I picked up this."</p>

  <p>He opened his coat; a long envelope, apparently stuffed with papers, was
  lying there. Brooke gazed at it with fascinated eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why haven't you mentioned it before&mdash;told the captain or some one?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>The little doctor paused for several moments to recover his breath.</p>

  <p>"I made up my mind that this packet should go straight from my hands to
  the chief of police in New York," he said.</p>

  <p>"Everything is talked about on board ship. I decided to keep silent. Since
  then I have been terrified&mdash;almost to death. Last night and the night
  before a man has been in my room. My trunk, the cushions here, have been
  searched. I lay shivering in my bunk. The packet was between my two
  mattresses." -</p>

  <p>"Who was the man?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't reach the light&mdash;I dared not have turned it on if I could
  have done so," was the almost plaintive reply. "It might have been a steward.
  I had courage once&mdash;but now&mdash;you see what I am. I can't bear
  another night. I want you to take this packet."</p>

  <p>Once more he produced the envelope. Brooke took it.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Keep it until we are safely off the steamer," Dr. Browning begged. "Bring
  it to me the moment after we land. I shall be at No. 387, the
  Waldorf-Astoria. My room is already engaged. I shall lie there and wait for
  you."</p>

  <p>Brooke fingered the packet irresolutely.</p>

  <p>"May I ask you this?" he said. "Why do you select me as your confidant? We
  are complete strangers, and many of the other passengers upon the ship have
  talked with you more."</p>

  <p>"I choose you," Browning replied, "because you are an Englishman, and a
  person whose appearance, forgive me, renders you free from any suspicion of
  being mixed up in this affair. You are so obviously a young Englishman of
  good family, with no particular occupation and no particular interests in the
  world. There is a widespread plot which turns upon these papers, and if,
  before I die, I can help toward an act of justice, it will make me happy. You
  are just the person whom no one would suspect of complicity in it."</p>

  </div>

  <p>Brooke thrust the packet into the breast pocket of his tweed coat, which
  he buttoned up closely.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he promised, "I'll do as you say."</p>

  <p>The little man leaned back upon his sofa.</p>

  <p>"I shall sleep now," he declared, with a sigh of content. "I never closed
  my eyes all last night."</p>

  <p>Brooke tiptoed his way out of the stateroom and sat in his steamer-chair
  upon the deck for an hour without moving. Then he rose and made his way to
  the second-class portion of the ship, where he found Constance in a sheltered
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Supposing," he said, "I was able to help toward the clearing up of this
  little affair, I take it that it would be a sort of satisfaction to you?"</p>

  <p>"It would be more than that," she answered firmly.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," he continued. "I am by way of making a bargain.
  Supposing I succeed, will you lunch with me at the Waldorf-Astoria at one
  o'clock on the day after we arrive, and will you promise to let me know your
  whereabouts for the first month of your stay in New York?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him, a little softened&mdash;and yet suspicious.</p>

  <p>"I can't see what satisfaction that would be to you," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"My lookout, that, isn't it?" he reminded her gently.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any clothes to come out to luncheon in," she told him.</p>

  <p>"If you will wear the clothes," he replied, "which you wore when you came
  on the steamer?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had to have a new frock," she interrupted, a little defiantly,
  "and I couldn't come abroad without a new hat, could I?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"It's a bargain, then."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to tell me anything?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at present," he replied. "To tell you the truth, there's so much that
  I don't understand myself."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">THE end of the voyage, so eagerly looked forward to by many
  of the passengers, was certainly not disappointing in the matter of
  sensation.</p>

  <p>The steamer was boarded in the harbor by two detectives, whose every
  movement was watched with intense interest. They made their way at once to
  the captain's cabin, where they remained for at least a quarter of an
  hour.</p>

  <p>When they returned to the deck they came face to face with Mr. Gordon
  Black. He was smoking a large cigar and, so far from showing any signs of
  discomfiture, accosted the two men and shook hands with them. A slight sense
  of disappointment began to manifest itself among the passengers. They were
  now almost up to the landing-stage and nothing had happened. Mr. Gordon
  Black, whose arrest by the New York police had been looked upon as a
  certainty, remained very much at liberty. The two detectives were talking to
  no one nor showing any signs of imminent action. It seemed, too, as though
  the murderer of Mr. Blessing were to walk off the ship unmolested. Then there
  was a little commotion at the companionway. Two of the stewards emerged,
  carrying a steamer-chair upon which Dr. Browning was stretched out. He was
  wearing a shore-going hat, and, though his appearance was ghastly, he was
  doing his best to exchange farewells with those of the passengers whom he
  passed. His chair was set down close to the gangway and within a few feet of
  the detectives. At that moment Brooke strolled up. He pointed to the
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I give that man in charge, officer," he said to the nearer detective,
  "for the murder of William Blessing on this boat."</p>

  <p>Brooke had spoken without raising his voice in the least, but his words
  had been perfectly distinct. What followed seemed nothing short of
  miraculous.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"
     name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src=

        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration by W. B. King"
        title="Illustration by W. B. King">

  <p>With a single bound Browning was at the side of the ship. He sent
  sprawling a passenger who inadvertently barred his path, and a seaman who
  made an instinctive movement toward him he tripped up with a dexterity which
  was simply amazing.</p>

  <p>They saw him for a moment and heard a splash. Then every one rushed to the
  side of the ship.</p>

  <p>"Your man, right enough," Brooke remarked to the detective.</p>

  <p>"That's Tim, sure," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I'd believed it, and we wouldn't have bungled the job!"</p>

  <p>The steamer was within forty yards of the dock, and the only open space
  around was the space which had been left for her to clear. Two sailors dived,
  and a dozen boats were in the water within five minutes. Nevertheless, the
  passengers were obliged to disembark without learning what had become of
  their late steamer companion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">CONSTANCE arrived punctually at the Waldorf on the following
  morning. Brooke led her to the table which he had reserved and watched the
  color stream into her cheeks as she bent over the roses which were lying by
  her plate.</p>

  <p>"Well," he announced cheerfully, "I've ordered luncheon&mdash;all manner
  of weird dishes, with just one or two we are sure of. I didn't order
  champagne because I thought you'd prefer that for dinner."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked, half indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," he replied. "I can see you are bubbling over with questions.
  Read the papers this morning?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I've been too busy."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll have to tell you a few facts first," he said. "The whole affair
  hinges around the great struggle between Gordon Black and Seth Pryor. Black
  stepped over the line a bit and had to leave the country. The documents which
  would have incriminated him were in England.</p>

  <p>"Blessing went over, as Pryor's agent, to buy them. Our little friend. Dr.
  Browning, who has a dozen aliases, and who is more wanted by the New York
  police than any other man on earth, was also on to the game, only what he
  wanted was to steal the papers. Very well. Blessing gets them. Gordon Black,
  acting on a hint he received from New York, sails for home.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Browning&mdash;Tim, the New York police call him&mdash;books on the
  same steamer. Tim murders Blessing and gets hold of the documents. Having got
  them, he tries to think out the safest way to make use of them. Blessing was
  murdered outside his door. On the whole, it is safer for him to land in new
  York without those documents in his possession.</p>

  <p>"He pitches on the most ingenuous-looking of his fellow passengers and
  hands them over to me to take care of. One or two little things about the
  man, however, during the last few days, gave me to think, as one says. I
  watched him like a lynx for the last twenty-four hours and was convinced that
  he was shamming. The rest is obvious."</p>

  <p>"And what about Mr. Gordon Black?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Therein," Brooke replied, "lies the humor of the situation, if one can
  use such a word at all in connection with the affair. The two great factions
  headed by Black and Seth Pryor made peace one day last week. The documents
  for which our little friend hoped to get a million dollars, and for which Mr.
  Black had actually bid twenty-five thousand pounds, are valueless. Quite a
  dramatic little business, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"What about the note which you saw Mr. Gordon Black receive on deck?"</p>

  <p>"That was from Browning, although he didn't sign it," Brooke explained.
  "It was just a little reminder that those documents were still in
  existence."</p>

  <p>"There isn't anything in life," she said softly, "so wonderful as to
  realize these things going on around you; to watch other people and wonder
  what secrets they are carrying about with them."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you feel like that," Brooke answered, "because that sort of
  thing is a bit of a hobby of mine, too. Found another post yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"I offer you one," he declared, filling her glass with hock. "Secretary,
  companion, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She put out her hand, checking him, as if his words had smitten her with
  poignant edge,</p>

  <p>"No, no," she pleaded, her soft eyes appealing to him sorrowfully; " wait,
  please wait!"</p>

  <p>He lapsed into thoughtful silence. Perhaps he was pushing the matter
  rather indelicately, somewhat hastily. So he reasoned, after a minute's
  cogitation. Better wait, indeed, than ruin it all.</p>

  <p>"You had joined Blessing," said he slowly, looking at her with frank
  directness, "and meant to help him in his detective work."</p>

  <p>She nodded, the flush of excitement, due to the crisis which she had
  staved off, brightening her cheeks and lips. Brooke wanted to kiss her. He
  wanted to tell her so. But it might be wiser&mdash;of course it would be
  wiser&mdash;to wait.</p>

  <p>He leaned his elbows on the table, talking across to her confidentially.
  "What do you say to a partnership&mdash;business&mdash;with me as the other
  member of the firm?" he suggested. "Let's open a detective bureau in
  London&mdash;there's a world of work waiting&mdash;on equal terms."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I have no capital for such a venture," said she. "I
  must stay here and fight."</p>

  <p>"You have your brains and your typewriter," said he, his face glowing with
  the heat of his new idea. "You can't remain here friendless, with no business
  connection, you know. Say that you'll put your typewriter and business
  experience against my capital and join the venture."</p>

  <p>"There's a great field&mdash;with your well-known talent as a business
  asset," she admitted, catching some of his fire.</p>

  <p>"Then let's call it done!" he exclaimed "We'll return by the next steamer,
  and I'll have you near me, at least, while I&mdash;" he caught himself, his
  face paling, as if afraid.</p>

  <p>"While you?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said he.</p>

  <p>She offered her hand. "A strictly business partnership, Mr. Brooke," she
  blushed. "And you must promise me not to mention&mdash;not to&mdash;to-"
  There was a supplication almost painful in her solemn eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait," said he.</p>

  <h2>THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MONSIEUR DUPOY</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Apr 1914</h3>

  <h4>BEING THE FIFTH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <p class="first">SIX months had passed since the day that unique partnership
  was entered into across the breakfast table in the Waldorf-Astoria, New York.
  To all appearances Constance Robinson had resumed her vocation as public
  typist, except that the contrast between her comfortable office of the
  present, and the bare room in Render Street in which Brooke first met her,
  was pleasantly sharp. Brooke sat by, watching her fingers dance through the
  transcription of a page.</p>

  <p>"What we want," he declared, from the depths of her easy-chair, "is a
  holiday&mdash;a proper summer holiday."</p>

  <p>"What you may want," Constance asserted, with emphasis, "has nothing to do
  with me. What I want is to finish this typing."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the machine contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand," he exclaimed, "why you go on grinding away at that
  wretched copying! You get ninepence a thousand words for it. It isn't in the
  least worth your while."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," she admitted, "and yet I fancy that I know my own business
  best. I have explained to you before that it is not the money it brings me in
  so much as the fact that it gives me a definite station in life. If any
  inquiries are made about me, I can easily prove that I am a professional
  typist, with work coming in all the time. It would be very much better for
  you if you had some corresponding occupation." Brooke evaded the point.</p>

  <p>"Will you come out somewhere for a drive this afternoon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I will not," she replied calmly. "You ought to have gone down and played
  golf. As you did not, I wish you would go round to your club or somewhere.
  You distract me."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and left her. He found Constance sometimes
  almost unendurable. Her resolution, her indomitable front towards all his
  attempts to alter in any way their relations, was beginning to tell upon
  him.</p>

  <p>It was impossible, however, to believe that she was not like other girls.
  There had even been moments when he had fancied that she had looked at him
  more kindly, moments when he had certainly permitted himself to hope. Only it
  was a long time! Personally he felt as far away from her now as on that first
  day.</p>

  <p>She had begun by piquing his curiosity. His vanity had been a little
  ruffled by her calm resistance of his advances. Then the other things had
  come&mdash;not all at once, but gradually. To-day he knew that there could
  never be any other woman in the world for him.</p>

  <p>At the club he was distrait. He wandered from the card-room, which bored
  him, abandoned the billiard-room without an effort to play, and finally found
  himself in the library, the most deserted spot in the club. Its only other
  occupant laid down his paper at his approach and welcomed him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brooke," he said, "your coming is rather a coincidence. I was on the
  point of ringing the bell to ask whether you were in the club."</p>

  <p>Brooke looked at the speaker in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I didn't even know that you remembered me, Sir William," he remarked, a
  little dryly.</p>

  <p>Sir William Dennison smiled as he drew up his chair. He was a tall,
  gray-bearded man, well groomed, his beard trimmed Vandyke fashion, a single
  eyeglass in his left eye. He held an official position under the government,
  and was quite the most distinguished member of the club.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I remember you very well," he declared. "It was in
  Vienna that I last met you."</p>

  <p>"I am flattered," said Brooke, easily, "to have remained in your memory so
  long."</p>

  <p>Sir William glanced around the room as though to make sure that they were
  alone.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of you once or twice lately," he announced, "through a
  friend of mine whom I need not name&mdash;you and a young lady&mdash;Miss
  Constance Robinson, I think."</p>

  <p>Brooke sat quite still.</p>

  <p>"I am told that in one or two cases," Sir William continued, "you have
  shown, between you, an unusual amount of determination and ingenuity. I have
  a commission to offer you. Are you prepared to take it?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Brooke answered.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem, on the face of it, a very interesting affair," Sir
  William went on. "One can't tell, however, what it might lead to. These are
  the facts.</p>

  <p>"About a fortnight ago a Monsieur Dupoy came over to this country,
  indirectly on behalf of the French government. I may say that we have
  received from them, within the course of the last few months, a strong
  protest against our neglect in the matter of war balloons and aeroplanes
  generally.</p>

  <p>"Dupoy was sent here to attend some experiments at Aldershot, and to be
  entrusted by us with a complete scheme of our proposed reorganization. He was
  to have received these at the War Office at twelve o'clock last Friday week.
  He presented himself at the appointed place at that time but we were not
  quite ready, and we asked him to call again the next day.</p>

  <p>"Dupoy was perfectly willing. I happened to be there myself, and I invited
  him to dine with me that night, an invitation which he accepted at once.
  Since then nothing whatever has been seen of Monsieur Dupoy."</p>

  <p>"He disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that he did not return home?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," Sir William replied. "We have communicated with the French
  government, and through them with his relations. No one has seen or heard
  anything of him since he left here last Friday week."</p>

  <p>"I haven't noticed anything about it in the papers," Brooke remarked.</p>

  <p>Sir William smiled.</p>

  <p>"The disappearance of Monsieur Dupoy," he said softly, "is not one of
  those cases which are advertised in the press. It may, of course, have been
  due to an accident in the ordinary way. The hospitals, however, have been
  thoroughly searched, and no trace discovered of him. It is a significant fact
  that, so far as anybody knew, he left the War Office a week ago last Friday
  with our proposals and our complete scheme in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"Where was he staying?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"At Delacher's Hotel, on the Embankment."</p>

  <p>"Some inquiries have been made there, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Dupoy was reported to have paid his bill on the Friday
  morning, to have ordered his bag brought down, and to have gone out for half
  an hour to buy, he told the hotel clerk, a present for his wife. Since then
  he has not been heard of."</p>

  <p>"Do you suspect any one?" Brooke asked next.</p>

  <p>Sir William shrugged his shoulders. He had risen to his feet and was
  lighting a cigarette from a case which he passed over to Brooke.</p>

  <p>"Not with any reason," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, however, this is the third disappearance from
  Delacher's Hotel within the last six weeks. It is possible that something may
  have happened to Dupoy quite apart from the fact that he was supposed to be
  carrying with him very important political documents.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether the affair appeals to you. If it does, my department
  will pay exceedingly well for any satisfactory elucidation of the mystery,
  and will, in any case, be responsible for your expenses if you care to have a
  look round."</p>

  <p>"I am awfully obliged to you, sir," Brooke replied. "Perhaps in a day or
  two I may have something to report."</p>

  <p>Brooke sought no longer to distract himself at bridge or billiards. He
  took a taxicab and drove back to his rooms, calling, on his way, to see
  Constance. She looked up at him ominously as he entered, but he only
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"This," he declared, "is no idle visit. Work! Do you know anything about
  Delacher's Hotel?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know that a few weeks ago there was a diamond merchant from Hamburg who
  disappeared from there; and a little time before that, a mysterious young
  woman from St. Petersburg, who had come over to look for a situation as a
  teacher of languages, went out one morning and never returned."</p>

  <p>"Good!" Brooke exclaimed. "There has been a third disappearance&mdash;a
  Frenchman this time."</p>

  <p>"How did you hear of it?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine," he explained, "a member of the government now, has
  placed the affair in my hands."</p>

  <p>"He has probably heard of you," she remarked quietly, "as my
  assistant."</p>

  <p>"He will hear of me some day as your&mdash;" Brooke began.</p>

  <p>"Don't be rash," she interrupted. "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to stay at Delacher's Hotel," he replied. "And you?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to finish this typing. Tell me, before you go, about this man
  who has disappeared?"</p>

  <p>Brooke imparted to her in a few words all the information he had gained
  from Sir William. She listened thoughtfully. When he had finished, she turned
  back to her work.</p>

  <p>"I wish you luck. Don't get into trouble," she advised him.</p>

  <p>Brooke opened his lips, but the click of the typewriter drowned his words.
  He moved slowly away. At the door he looked back. Constance was absorbed in
  her work. He could see only the top of her light brown hair and the flashing
  of her fingers. With a muttered word he went up to his room.</p>

  <p>An hour later he made his way to Charing Cross and, waiting until the
  arrival of the Continental train, mingled with the little stream of alighting
  passengers and took a taxicab to Delacher's Hotel. A hall porter received his
  bag and ushered him in. Brooke, whose French was perfect, asked for a room in
  the name of Monsieur Dupoy. The clerk stared at him for a moment. The head
  porter, who was a tall, olive-skinned person, with a black mustache, also
  leaned forward with interest.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Dupoy!" the clerk repeated, with the pen in his hand.</p>

  <p>Brooke nodded, and glanced around as though to make sure that no one else
  was within hearing.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," he announced, "I come here on behalf of the
  family. Only the week before last, a cousin of mine was staying in this same
  hotel. He was to have returned to Paris last Friday week. He did not arrive.
  We have sent him many messages and letters. There has been no reply. It was
  arranged that I should come over to make inquiries."</p>

  <p>"We have already written," the clerk remarked, "informing Madame Dupoy
  that her husband left here on the Friday morning, for the purpose, he said,
  of buying her a present. He did not return. He had so little luggage that we
  imagined he had been kept until the last moment and then had taken the train
  without it, sooner than be delayed." Brooke nodded.</p>

  <p>"Up till last night," he declared, with a little gesture, "my cousin had
  not returned. Therefore, I am here. Give me a room. I do not know what I can
  do, but we shall see. One must try the police."</p>

  <p>The clerk handed him a round ticket.</p>

  <p>"You can have the room which your cousin occupied. Monsieur Dupoy," he
  said&mdash;"No. 387, on the third floor. As to the police, it is, of course,
  your affair, but I trust you are satisfied that nothing happened to Monsieur
  Dupoy under this roof?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," Brooke replied. "All the evidence goes to show that he left
  here, as you have told me, to buy this present."</p>

  <p>Brooke was ushered to the lift. Until he disappeared, he noticed that the
  head porter was watching him with ill-concealed curiosity. He was shown into
  an ordinary hotel bedroom on the third floor, with an outlook on the
  Thames.</p>

  <p>The furniture was of the plainest, and there was no communicating door
  into another room. Brooke opened his bag, took out his clothes, and glanced
  at his watch. It was a quarter to eight. He decided to dine in the restaurant
  down-stairs without changing, and accordingly rang the bell and ordered some
  hot water. The chambermaid wished him good evening pleasantly. He slipped a
  half-crown into her hand.</p>

  <p>"I may leave at any moment," he explained. "I give you this now."</p>

  <p>She grabbed the money and beamed at him.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman is very gracious," she declared, with a strong German
  accent. Brooke broke into fluent German.</p>

  <p>"You knew the occupant of this room," he inquired, "who was here the week
  before last&mdash;Monsieur Dupoy?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He left his bag behind him," she said.</p>

  <p>"He departed in a great hurry."</p>

  <p>"You didn't happen to see him before he started, I suppose?" Brooke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered. "Yes! He came in and washed his hands. It was the
  middle of the morning. He went out to eat. I know because he said to me: 'The
  food down-stairs,' he said, 'it is good, but the room is dull. I will go
  somewhere more lively.' He said that to me while I poured out his hot
  water."</p>

  <p>"Nothing about buying a present for his wife?" Brooke inquired. The girl
  shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not to me did he speak of such a person."</p>

  <p>Brooke whistled softly as he went downstairs. As he crossed the hall he
  heard the sound of voices raised in altercation. The head porter was speaking
  angrily to a subordinate, who had apparently come late to relieve him. Brooke
  bought a paper and went into the restaurant.</p>

  <p>He dined fairly well, but his surroundings were certainly depressing. A
  band, not of the first order, was playing. There were only a few diners, and
  these were obviously foreigners of the commercial type. One or two of the men
  seemed to be talking business. There were barely half a dozen women in the
  room. As soon as he had finished his meal, he strolled out into the hall. The
  man who had relieved the head porter was standing on the door-step. Brooke
  strolled up to him and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Disagreeable looking fellow, your head porter," he observed.</p>

  <p>"It is a wonder," the man grumbled, "that any of us stay here with him. If
  the management only knew?"</p>

  <p>He hurried off to procure a taxi for a departing guest. Brooke awaited his
  return.</p>

  <p>"Queer-appearing fellow altogether," he said softly. "He looks more like a
  head-waiter than anything."</p>

  <p>"He was a waiter before he took on this job," the porter remarked. "He has
  got a restaurant of his own now, they say. Shouldn't care to go to it
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Brooke inquired.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. He looked more closely at his questioner.</p>

  <p>"No particular reason, sir. I don't like Paul, that's all. You'll excuse
  me, sir."</p>

  <p>He walked off to attend to some alighting passengers. Brooke noticed that
  he seemed rather to avoid returning. When he was disengaged, however, Brooke
  called softly to him.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, what is your name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My name is Fritz, sir," the man replied.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know mine?" Brooke continued.</p>

  <p>"No, sir!"</p>

  <p>"My name is Dupoy."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir&mdash;We had a Monsieur Dupoy here quite lately."</p>

  <p>"My cousin," Brooke declared. "He was to have returned to Paris last
  Friday week. He never came, and we have been very anxious. That is why I am
  here." The porter edged a little away.</p>

  <p>"I should go to the police, sir, and make inquiries," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"There are certain reasons," Brooke said slowly, "why I would rather not
  do that. I thought I might be able to pick up some information here. I am
  willing to pay for it."</p>

  <p>The man smiled in somewhat mysterious fashion.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, sir," he whispered, confidentially, "I should
  ask&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whom?" Brooke demanded.</p>

  <p>"Paul!"</p>

  <p>Again he went about his business, and again Brooke waited. When he came
  back, however, he was uncommunicative. He kept looking behind toward the
  office.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me if I speak plainly, sir," he said. "My first
  instructions when I got the job here were to keep my mouth shut. I've got a
  wife and children and I can't afford to run any risks. If they see you here
  with me and know you're making inquiries, they'll think I'm gassing." Brooke
  slipped a sovereign into his hand.</p>

  <p>"What time does Paul come on duty?"</p>

  <p>"Not for another hour, sir," the man replied. "He is having his
  dinner."</p>

  <p>Brooke strolled back into the hotel and asked for the manager, Mr.
  Delacher, who turned out to be a very polite but somewhat somber-looking
  personage. Brooke introduced himself as a cousin of Monsieur Dupoy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, "whether you remember my cousin? He stayed here
  for a day or two, and then, on the day when he should have returned home, he
  absolutely disappeared."</p>

  <p>"I remember Monsieur Dupoy perfectly," the manager admitted. "It is true
  that he did not return, but as he had paid his bill and said that he was
  going by the two-twenty, we concluded that he would send for his luggage
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"You cannot help me in any way, then?" Brooke asked. "He has a wife who is
  altogether in despair at his absence." Mr. Delacher was only mildly
  sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"My guests," he explained, "come and go. Of their doings I keep no count.
  How Monsieur Dupoy spent his time I cannot tell. All that I know is that he
  paid his bill, which seems to prove that he meant to depart. You will
  probably find, sir, that he will return presently. He is perhaps at home by
  now."</p>

  <p>"I thank you very much," Brooke said. "By the bye, the face of your head
  porter seemed to me so familiar. Have I seen him at any of the hotels on the
  Continent, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Delacher shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Paul has been with me for twelve years. Before that, he was at the Savoy
  in Berlin. He is a very valuable servant."</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Brooke assented. "I suppose, then, if I want to find my
  cousin you would advise me to apply to the police?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Delacher shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I can see no other course, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Brooke strolled out along the Embankment for half an hour. When he
  returned, Paul was on duty&mdash;tall, austere, magnificent. He saluted
  Brooke in a dignified manner, but he watched him all the time as one who was
  scarcely satisfied. Brooke came to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"Paul," he said, "it is a saying in Paris that the chief porter at a
  London hotel can tell you anything in the world you may want to know."</p>

  <p>"It is an exaggeration, monsieur," the man replied.</p>

  <p>"It may be," Brooke admitted. "Who can say? I search everywhere for my
  cousin, Eugene Dupoy. It is you who saw him last. You cannot even tell me
  where it was that he intended to lunch before he returned for his bag?"</p>

  <p>Paul regarded his questioner in melancholy fashion.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell monsieur that," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"You did not know, even, how he spent his time here?"</p>

  <p>Paul shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He seemed to be occupied with affairs," he announced. "On the morning of
  his unexpected departure, he left in a state of some excitement. He had an
  important engagement, he said, at twelve o'clock."</p>

  <p>Brooke nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is so," he said, confidentially. "The appointment, however, was
  postponed."</p>

  <p>Paul turned slowly round. His manner, in a sense, was changing.</p>

  <p>"Some papers which my cousin was expecting were not completed," Brooke
  continued. "A little affair of business. I myself am to fetch them to-morrow
  from the same place. That, however, is beside the point."</p>

  <p>There was no doubt but that Paul was an altered man. His frigidity of
  demeanor had departed. He apparently took the liveliest interest in his
  questioner.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry indeed, sir," he said, "that I cannot help you. Monsieur
  Dupoy was a charming guest. He will, I am sure, return home safely. Monsieur
  remains with us long?"</p>

  <p>Brooke shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What is the good?" he demanded. "Where am I to look for my dear cousin? I
  cannot tell. I shall finish the little matter of business which he was
  obliged to leave undone, and return to Paris."</p>

  <p>"You are not anxious, then, about your relation, sir?" Paul asked.</p>

  <p>Brooke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This," he declared, "is London. Things do not happen here. It may well be
  an affair of a letter, ill-directed or missing. Eugene may have gone on the
  Continent. Who can tell?"</p>

  <p>Paul was standing with his hands behind him. It was between nine and ten
  o'clock and there was nothing whatever doing.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange, monsieur," he remarked, "that your cousin did not
  finish his business here, after all."</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," Brooke answered. "Certain papers were not ready. I myself
  take possession of them at eleven o'clock to-morrow. I think that I shall do
  exactly what Eugene would have done&mdash;pay my bill when I leave here in
  the morning, return for my bag, and catch the two twenty."</p>

  <p>"I will give orders, sir," Paul said. "You will lunch here, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Probably," Brooke replied. "It is not amusing but, although I speak
  English so well, I am almost a stranger in London."</p>

  <p>"If I might venture," Paul suggested slowly, "there is a little restaurant
  in a street leading off Shaftesbury Avenue&mdash;I could give monsieur the
  address&mdash;where the cooking is altogether French. A most interesting
  place! Monsieur might see there a great singer, a dancer, an artist. The
  French ladies who have succeeded in London, they go there at midday. It is
  worth a visit."</p>

  <p>"The place for me, Paul!" Brooke exclaimed. "Write it down on a piece of
  paper."</p>

  <p>Paul obeyed promptly.</p>

  <p>"It is called the Caf&eacute; Hollande, monsieur," he said, handing over
  the card.</p>

  <p>"There are two floors. You go downstairs and ask for Jean Marchand. You
  will, I think, be exceedingly well served."</p>

  <p>"I'll try, at all events," Brooke decided. "I suppose I shall have plenty
  of time to return here and catch the two-twenty?"</p>

  <p>"It would be advisable, monsieur," Paul proposed, "if your bag were sent
  to the station to meet you. The account could be paid before you leave in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"It is excellent," Brooke declared. "Good night, Paul!"</p>

  <p>The man saluted.</p>

  <p>"Good night, monsieur!"</p>

  <p>Brooke slept well, was called at a reasonable hour in the morning, visited
  the hairdresser after his breakfast, and at eleven o'clock strolled out to
  the front and instructed Paul to procure him a taxicab.</p>

  <p>"I shall do as you suggested, Paul," he remarked. "I have paid my bill.
  After I have finished my business, I shall call at Scotland Yard and inquire
  about my cousin."</p>

  <p>The man assented gravely.</p>

  <p>"I trust, monsieur," he said, "that you will receive good news. Also that
  you will like my little restaurant. <i>Bonjour et bon voyage,
  monsieur!</i>"</p>

  <p>Brooke was driven in a taxi to the War Office. Sir William, who happened
  to be in the building and disengaged, received him at once.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" he asked, laconically.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Brooke replied. "So far, it has been an affair of routine. I am
  supposed to be here to receive a document from you&mdash;drawings, and all
  that sort of thing. Can I have a bundle made up?" Sir William nodded and gave
  a few instructions.</p>

  <p>"When one comes to think of it," he said thoughtfully, "it is rather a
  serious thing that this fellow Dupoy should have disappeared in the heart of
  London. Where are you going when you leave here?"</p>

  <p>"I am going exactly where Dupoy went. I am going to lunch in a little
  restaurant off Shaftesbury Avenue, strongly recommended to me by a person
  whom I suspect was interested in Dupoy's disappearance. I expect there to
  obtain at any rate a hint." Sir William nodded in an interested manner.</p>

  <p>"You fellows do get some fun out of life," he remarked, a little
  enviously. "I should rather like to lunch with you." Brooke shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't, Sir William," he advised. "If I am on a clue at all, it is a
  very thin one, and this sort of people are easily put off. I think I had
  better go alone."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," Sir William suggested, "you'd better let me know the name of the
  restaurant, in case you do the disappearance trick, or anything of that
  sort."</p>

  <p>Brooke scribbled it down upon a piece of paper. Then, with a sealed packet
  in his hand which he had the air of endeavoring to conceal as much as
  possible, he left the building and reentered his taxicab.</p>

  <p>He drove first to Scotland Yard where, for the sake of appearances, he
  made a few aimless inquiries about Inspector Simmons, who was out of town. At
  a quarter to one he was set down outside the Caf&eacute; Hollande. He entered
  the place and looked around him for a minute. Although it was early, a great
  many of the tables were occupied, nearly all apparently by foreigners. There
  was a small orchestra playing from somewhere below, a large desk at which an
  elderly woman was busy making out accounts, mirrored walls, muslin curtains
  not absolutely clean, the usual appurtenances of a restaurant on the borders
  of Soho. A little dark man came hurrying towards him, his face wreathed in
  smiles.</p>

  <p>"Jean Marchand?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"But certainly, monsieur," the little man replied. "It is Monsieur Paul
  who has sent you here?"</p>

  <p>"Paul of Delacher's Hotel," Brooke admitted. Jean glanced around the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Up here, monsieur," he confided, "it is at all times a little
  noisy&mdash;not entirely <i>comme il faut</i>. I recommend to monsieur my
  favorite table below. This way."</p>

  <p>Brooke followed his guide down the stairs into a large and somewhat empty
  apartment, in which were set a few tables only. At the bottom of the stairs
  an orchestra of three musicians was playing. At the farther end of the room
  was a long table covered with bottles, watched over by a <i>ma&icirc;tre
  d'h&ocirc;tel</i>. There were only one or two people lunching.</p>

  <p>"It is not yet one," Jean explained. "Between one and half past this room
  will be crowded. There are celebrities who come here. I myself will point
  them out to monsieur. I recommend this table&mdash;the one in the
  corner."</p>

  <p>"But it is already occupied," Brooke remarked, glancing with a slightly
  puzzled air at the girl in the corner, who seemed on the point of raising her
  veil.</p>

  <p>"The adjoining table, then, monsieur," Jean begged. "Monsieur may make
  himself comfortable. I myself will return to take his order for
  luncheon."</p>

  <p>Jean retreated with smooth haste. Brooke advanced slowly towards the
  corner of the room indicated. Then he stopped short. The girl had raised her
  veil.</p>

  <p>"Constance!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You!" she echoed.</p>

  <p>Brooke took a seat opposite to her.</p>

  <p>"What on earth does it mean?" he cried.</p>

  <p>She tore open a letter which lay on the table by her side. She glanced
  through the few lines and passed it across to him.</p>

  <p>"A man called upon me this morning," she explained. "He asked for my aid
  in a certain private matter. The first step was that I should lunch here at a
  table which should be pointed out by a <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
  named Jean Marchand, and that I should open this letter if a neighbor should
  take the adjoining place. Read."</p>

  <p>Brooke snatched at the half sheet of note paper. Across it was written in
  a bold, sprawling hand&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Good fortune and good appetite to Monsieur Dupoy from
  Paris, and mademoiselle, his charming partner!</p>

  <p>Brooke looked up at Constance and met her eyes steadily fixed upon
  his.</p>

  <p>"This means?" he said slowly.</p>

  <p>The wrinkles began to form around her eyes. She was beginning to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"It means that you have run up against some one even cleverer than we
  are," she declared. He looked at her with a little of that old-time cast of
  imbecility on his face.</p>

  <p>"A philosophical attitude," Brooke insisted at length, "is our best role.
  We came here to lunch&mdash;we will lunch. We will lunch well."</p>

  <p>Certainly there was nothing to be complained of in the cooking at the
  Caf&eacute; Hollande. The service was a little slow and there was a queer
  sense of emptiness in the room. All the time there was a great tumult of
  voices and footsteps up-stairs, but Jean's prophecy as to the filling up of
  this particular room was in no way carried out. As though by mutual consent,
  neither Constance nor Brooke talked of the disappearance of Dupoy. It was
  only over their coffee, during the last few moments, that the subject was
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake, of course," Brooke confessed. "It was foolish of me
  even to show myself at Delacher's Hotel."</p>

  <p>She nodded. Soon afterwards they rose and, Brooke having paid the bill,
  they ascended the stairs and walked out into the street, without having seen
  anything further of Jean Marchand. As they passed along Shaftesbury Avenue,
  Constance, who had been looking into a shop-window, touched Brooke on the
  arm.</p>

  <p>"We are being followed," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"A man who stood on the other side of the street as we came out, is
  trailing us now."</p>

  <p>"What is he like?" Brooke asked, with a sudden hope.</p>

  <p>"He looks like a porter of some sort at an hotel or club," she answered.
  "He has on dark blue trousers, an ordinary coat, and a cap. He is rather
  florid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brooke gently guided her down a narrow street which they were passing.</p>

  <p>"It is the man I wanted to see," he declared softly. "Is he still
  following us?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. Almost directly he stepped up.</p>

  <p>"You want to speak to me, Fritz?" Brooke inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man replied, "but not here. If you please&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He plunged through the door of a public-house. Brooke and Constance,
  without hesitation, followed him. It was an ordinary little place, half
  caf&eacute;, half public house, almost empty. They sat at a small table away
  from the window. 'Brooke ordered something to drink. Fritz leaned
  forward.</p>

  <p>"This morning," he announced, "after you left, I was dismissed. That man
  Paul, he thinks that all are fools. He thinks that one sees nothing. He is
  wrong. Monsieur Dupoy, I am here to speak of your cousin."</p>

  <p>"It is good," Brooke said, nodding. "Go on."</p>

  <p>Fritz looked around him.</p>

  <p>"I am a poor man," he continued. "I had a good place until one day Paul he
  took a dislike to me. Now I am turned away. Places are hard to get. I have a
  wife and children. I must do the best I can. It is for that reason that I
  said to myself&mdash;'Why should I not profit by the things which I have
  observed?'"</p>

  <p>Brooke brought out his pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"You are an exceedingly sensible fellow, Fritz," he declared. "Now tell me
  what information you have to offer, and we will talk business."</p>

  <p>Fritz nodded.</p>

  <p>"Directly," he said, "but first, monsieur, what were you doing so long in
  the Caf&eacute; Hollande?"</p>

  <p>"I had lunch there," Brooke told him, dryly.</p>

  <p>The face of Fritz seemed suddenly blanched. He stared at them both.</p>

  <p>"<i>Monsieur</i> lunched there!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Down-stairs?"</p>

  <p>"Down-stairs," Brooke admitted.</p>

  <p>Fritz took the glass of brandy which had been offered, and drank it
  off.</p>

  <p>"You have the good fortune, monsieur," he muttered. "It was not so with
  your cousin when he lunched there downstairs."</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?" Brooke asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Fritz shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There are things," he declared, "which, if I knew, I would not dare to
  speak of. Indeed, I do not know. This is my offer to monsieur. For twenty
  pounds I will take him to his cousin."</p>

  <p>Brooke placed the money without hesitation upon the counter. Fritz
  buttoned it up in his pocket and rose.</p>

  <p>"Understand, monsieur" he said in the doorway, "that when I point to the
  house where you will find Monsieur Dupoy, I have finished. If you seek for
  me, it will be useless. I know nothing. I keep my bargain when I show you the
  house which shelters Monsieur Dupoy."</p>

  <p>"It is agreed," Brooke assured him. They walked out into the street. Fritz
  kept about a dozen yards ahead. They crossed Shaftesbury Avenue, traversed
  another narrow street for a short distance, and then turned abruptly to the
  right. There was a news agent's shop, with a notice in the
  window&mdash;"Rooms to let for single gentlemen." Fritz pointed to it.</p>

  <p>"There, monsieur!"</p>

  <p>Almost as he uttered the words he stepped aside to avoid a passing dray.
  When it had gone, Fritz, too, had disappeared. He had plunged once more into
  the throng of people.</p>

  <p>Brooke and Constance entered the shop. A Frenchwoman was behind the
  counter, stout, untidy, with black hair all over her face. Brooke took off
  his hat.</p>

  <p>"Have you, madame," he asked, "a lodger here of the name of Dupoy?" She
  stretched out her hands.</p>

  <p>"But, monsieur," she said, "I have a lodger here whom I do not know. His
  name is as likely to be Dupoy as anything else. Monsieur would like to see
  him?"</p>

  <p>Brooke followed her up the crazy stairs. Constance came behind. They were
  ushered into a tiny bedchamber. A man, partly dressed, lay upon a sofa, his
  head propped up by two or three pillows. He stared at them eagerly as they
  came in, and his lips moved, but he said nothing. His clothes hung about him
  shapelessly. He had a beard of a week or so's growth upon his chin. His head
  was tied up with a bandage.</p>

  <p>"Dupoy?" Brooke exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The man stared at him but remained speechless. Madame shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He talks only nonsense," she declared. "All the time he asks who he is.
  But listen, it is the doctor who comes. You shall speak with him
  yourself."</p>

  <p>The doctor knocked at the door and entered. He bowed with a little
  flourish to Constance.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "it is perhaps the friends of the unfortunate
  monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me what has happened to him?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman stretched out his hands.</p>

  <p>"Madame can tell you as much as I," he said. "Last Friday week he tottered
  into the shop, very much as he is now, his head bound up, desperately ill.
  She fancies that an unseen hand propelled him. That may or may not be so. His
  pockets were cut open as though he had been searched. She brought him
  up-stairs and sent for me. Since then I have attended him every day. He was
  suffering from a terrible blow on the head, which has unfortunately produced,
  as you see, a complete loss of memory."</p>

  <p>"If his head was bound up, he had already been treated for the blow when
  he came in?" Brooke remarked. "It was not an accident, then, which had
  happened in the street?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head in most mysterious fashion.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said, "almost I felt it my duty to communicate with the
  police. The wound when I examined it&mdash;it is beginning to heal
  now&mdash;gave me the impression of having been made by a surgeon's knife. It
  takes a certain course. Its effect has been this loss of memory and
  apprehension. The poor fellow knows nothing. The wound is healing, but for
  the rest, who can tell?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence in the room.</p>

  <p>"He had money?" Brooke asked slowly. The woman's eyes were suddenly
  covetous. She exchanged a rapid glance with the doctor, who coughed and
  looked away.</p>

  <p>"He had money," she admitted slowly. "There is little left now, though. We
  have taken for his board and the doctor has taken for his bills. There is
  little remaining."</p>

  <p>Again there was silence. The doctor was affecting to examine his patient.
  Brooke walked to the window&mdash;dusty, and smothered with a filthy muslin
  blind. He looked across the housetops for a moment. The instinct of the
  detective was suddenly crushed by a stronger feeling&mdash;a passionate
  sympathy with this poor stricken creature, an angry craving for revenge.</p>

  <p>The woman had sidled out of the room. They could hear her heavy footsteps
  upon the stairs. The doctor was bending over his patient. Brooke turned back
  to Constance.</p>

  <p>"We have found Dupoy," he said, "after all, but there are other things to
  be done."</p>

  <p>Within a week, several things happened. Dupoy was formally identified, and
  died without having recovered his memory. The Caf&eacute; Hollande was
  searched quietly but closely from floor to ceiling, without the slightest
  result. The body of Fritz was discovered floating in the Thames. Paul was so
  much upset by these and other happenings that he was confined to his room for
  a fortnight with a severe nervous breakdown. Ultimately, however, to the
  great satisfaction of a large number of travelers, he was able to take up
  once more his duties as head porter at Delacher's Hotel.</p>

  <h2>THE SPIDER'S PARLOR</h2>

  <h4>BEING THE SIXTH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, May 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">BROOKE missed the sound of the typewriter as he entered her
  room, but, to his immense relief, Constance was there. She was sitting back
  in her easy-chair, her eyes were half closed, she seemed pale and tired. The
  windows were wide open but the air of the little room was stifling.</p>

  <p>"Constance!" he exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, Miss Robinson&mdash;you see
  I am back again."</p>

  <p>She seemed suddenly to pull herself together. The lines were still under
  her weary eyes, but she held herself upright and she spoke briskly.</p>

  <p>"So I observe," she remarked. "I am sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, looking at his dark clothes and black tie. He came over to
  her, dragging a chair with him.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to try and be a hypocrite," he said. "It was an uncle whom
  I have seen only half a dozen times in my life, and he has left me a little
  money. He was eighty-one years old. Why on earth should I be sorry?"</p>

  <p>"No reason at all that I can see," she admitted, smiling. "I suppose you
  have come to tell me, then, that our partnership is at an end?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he answered swiftly,</p>

  <p>"I have come to beg for a new one."</p>

  <p>She was conscious, almost as soon as she had spoken, of the opportunity
  which her words had given him. She shrank a little away but he caught at her
  hands and held them boldly.</p>

  <p>"Constance," he said, "you've known all the time, of course. You're horrid
  to me, and I haven't cared to say much before because, after all, I had only
  what I could earn with you and through you. I've a reserve fund to fall back
  upon now. Will you marry me, please, dear?"</p>

  <p>She drew her hands firmly away.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly and decidedly not," she declared.</p>

  <p>Brooke sighed.</p>

  <p>"It sounds a little uncompromising," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is exactly how I feel," she assured him. "I have not the slightest
  desire to marry you or any one. What I've seen of married life," she went on,
  a little sadly, "has been quite enough to prevent my ever thinking about it
  for myself as long as I live."</p>

  <p>"But surely'" he pleaded, "you do not allow yourself to be influenced by
  one, or even two, unfortunate marriages?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot discuss it," she said. "Fortunately for me, I am one of those
  people who are able to take care of themselves, who can live alone and not
  feel the want of any one's society. You see, I am not at all the sort of girl
  men like. I am a little hard, a little bitter. There have been things in my
  life which have made me so. The world is full of girls, Mr. Brooke, who would
  make you excellent wives, and who are only waiting for the opportunity.
  Please put away all such thoughts in connection with me."</p>

  <p>He sat in silence for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he remarked, "is there anything in your life which accounts
  for your unnatural attitude towards matrimony?"</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"Some day," she answered, "I may tell you&mdash;certainly not at present.
  Now, please, get all these foolish ideas out of your head. There is some
  business to talk about."</p>

  <p>"I will talk business in five minutes," Brooke said. "Before I do so, I
  insist upon knowing what has happened to this room."</p>

  <p>He looked around him wonderingly. Constance sat quite still, but her lips
  were quivering.</p>

  <p>"I have got rid of a few articles of furniture which I did not require,"
  she declared.</p>

  <p>"Nothing else has happened to it that I know of."</p>

  <p>"Your little water-colors have gone," he pointed out, "your two bronzes,
  all the china from your cabinet, all the silver from that little what-not.
  Were you thinking of moving, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or what?"</p>

  <p>"Have you sold them?"</p>

  <p>"I do not consider, Mr. Brooke," she said, "that this matter concerns you
  at all."</p>

  <p>"We are partners," he objected.</p>

  <p>"We are partners inasmuch as we divide the profits of certain of our
  undertakings," she replied. "We have done that, and there is an end of
  it."</p>

  <p>"If we are partners in good fortune," he insisted doggedly, "we are also
  partners in ill fortune."</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to grant anything of the sort," she rejoined. "Since
  you are so ill-bred as to be inquisitive, I will admit that I have sold some
  of my things. I had a pressing claim and I had to satisfy it."</p>

  <p>"But why on earth couldn't you telegraph me?" he exclaimed. "You knew
  where I was."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth should I?" she replied.</p>

  <p>"You know very well that what I have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What you have has nothing to do with me," she declared firmly. "I have a
  burden to carry through life and I mean to carry it myself. What it is I have
  no idea of telling you&mdash;at any rate for the present. If you find out, it
  will be against my will. Sometimes it keeps me poor. At other times it is no
  trouble at all. Whatever it is, it is my affair and mine alone. Now, will you
  please sit quite still? I want to talk to you about something else."</p>

  <p>Brooke kept silent with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he muttered. "For the present, then&mdash;only for the
  present. You can go on."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she began, "I have been wasting my time the whole of the
  fortnight you have been away. I couldn't help it. 1 am going to make a
  confession. That down-stairs room in the Caf&eacute; Hollande has fascinated
  me. I haven't been able to keep away from it. I think what makes it the more
  attractive really is that they hate the sight of me there."</p>

  <p>"The place has been thoroughly searched, hasn't it?" he interposed.</p>

  <p>"From cellar to attic. Directly the manager was spoken to and it was
  hinted to him that suspicions had been aroused concerning the restaurant, he
  placed all his keys at the disposal of Mr. Simmons, and he insisted upon
  their searching every room and cross-questioning whomever they chose.</p>

  <p>"Not a single suspicious circumstance came to light, not a single thing to
  connect the place with Paul of Delacher's Hotel, or with any other person,
  Mr. Simmons himself told me that he was sure there had been some mistake. I
  told him about Fritz, the man whose dead body was found in the Thames. I told
  him how genuinely terrified he was when he heard that we had lunched there.
  Mr. Simmons only shook his head. You know how obstinate he is. He had made up
  his mind.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I said no more. But since then the Caf&eacute; Lugano has seen
  little of me. I have lunched in that gloomy room downstairs at the Hollande
  nearly every day. Sometimes I have dined there as well. They keep on charging
  me more and more. They bring me indifferent things to eat. They keep me
  waiting an unconscionable time. I say to myself 'Never again will I set foot
  inside this place!' and in a few hours I am back again."</p>

  <p>"This isn't like you," he remarked, wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," she admitted. "I have never believed in presentiments. I
  haven't cared about anything but direct methods. Yet I am going to tell you
  something. I know perfectly well that there are things connected with the
  Caf&eacute; Hollande which have never been discovered. Do you know what I
  call it to myself&mdash;the Spider's Parlor! Things go on there which no one
  has any idea of."</p>

  <p>"But in what part of the place?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she answered, "only I feel quite sure that there is
  something mysterious about that half-underground room, with just those few
  tables and the three musicians. They are turning people away all the time
  up-stairs. It would be perfectly easy to add fifty more tables down-stairs,
  instead of which they keep it empty. The few people who are there seem either
  to have drifted in by accident, or to have some special interest in the
  place. However, there is something more to tell you."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock, which was just striking four.</p>

  <p>"To-day," she went on, "as I came out, I stopped to give something to the
  musicians. The man who plays the piano was the only one there. The other two
  had turned away for a minute. I wonder whether you remember him? He was a
  strange, dark-looking creature, with queer eyes."</p>

  <p>Brooke nodded.</p>

  <p>"I remember him perfectly."</p>

  <p>"He seemed to have a sudden idea when I spoke to him," she went on. "There
  was no one within hearing. He asked me in an undertone for my address."</p>

  <p>"The infernal cheek&mdash;" Brooke began. Constance shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"He did not ask in that sort of way. The only other two words he said were
  'Four o'clock.' Now suppose you go to the door and open it."</p>

  <p>There was a sound of knocking outside. Brooke obeyed. It was indeed the
  musician who stood there. He wore a long black overcoat, notwithstanding the
  heat of the day, and he carried a soft black hat in his hand. He stared hard
  at Brooke with one eye, and blinked rapidly with the other.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She is here," Brooke replied. "Come in."</p>

  <p>The man came into the room. Constance rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman," she said, indicating Brooke, "is a friend of mine. You
  need not hesitate to speak before him. What is it you wish to say?"</p>

  <p>The man laid his hat upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Young lady," he began, "I do not quite know why I spoke to you. I was
  beside myself this morning. They have dismissed me, those people at that
  rathole. I sat there thinking when you passed. You, too, have been in that
  place often, and I wondered, as the others wonder, for what purpose. I said
  to myself that we would speak with one another. Who can tell what may come of
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing whatever to conceal," she told him. "I have been so often
  into that wretched little room at the Caf&eacute; Hollande because the place
  seems to me so mysterious, and because I am interested in unraveling queer
  things and visiting strange places. I have always a fancy that there are
  secrets almost within the reach of one's hands there."</p>

  <p>The man leaned forward. He was English enough, and yet there was a strain
  of some foreign blood in him. His gestures were theatrical but natural.</p>

  <p>"It is the truth!" he exclaimed. "There are things going on there which no
  one knows of. There are certain visitors who are brought with much ceremony
  to the little room down-stairs, and on those nights we are sent away early.
  What happens? Who knows? But that visitor never comes another time. He is
  never seen again.</p>

  <p>"You," he went on, pointing to Brooke, "were brought down there one day,
  and the young lady. Nothing happened. The young lady has been often since.
  Yet believe me or not, as you choose, never do I remember any one else
  escorted down those stairs by Jean whose face I have ever seen again!"</p>

  <p>"But there are always a few customers there," Constance objected.</p>

  <p>"Dummies!" the musician declared.</p>

  <p>"They are creatures of the restaurant. There is barely a single genuine
  customer. Why should they come? The place is nearly empty. Only one or two
  tables are set there; it is cold and drafty, the service is slow.
  Mademoiselle is the only one from the outside world who has been there often,
  and I have seen them watch her&mdash;watch her from up-stairs, watch her from
  the other places. Sometimes I have had it in my mind to speak to her."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Brooke asked, "you seem to have been suspicious of this place
  for some time. Have you discovered anything?"</p>

  <p>"A trifle which may not be a trifle," the musician answered. "It was only
  yesterday. There was a wine merchant who called. Jean complained bitterly of
  some wine. We could hear them upon the stairs.</p>

  <p>"It was arranged that Jean should go into the cellars and bring up several
  bottles at hazard. Jean passed us, went behind the bar, opened the trap-door
  and stepped down. I saw him disappear with my own eyes. In a moment or two
  the wine merchant came down the stairs. He inquired for Monsieur Jean. I
  pointed to the open trap-door.</p>

  <p>"'Ah!' he exclaimed, 'he has gone to fetch the wine. I will help him.' He
  hurried across the room and began to descend the steps. Presently he
  returned. 'There is no one there,' he declared.</p>

  <p>"It was in the intervals of playing. I myself descended with him. The
  cellar was empty. We searched it everywhere. Then we both ascended. While we
  spoke of this thing we heard footsteps. Jean appeared with the bottles. I
  turned away. I heard Jean explain that he had been behind a bin in the
  corner, but I know better. Jean was not in the cellar at all."</p>

  <p>"But surely it is not impossible," Brooke interposed, "that there should
  be another way out of the cellar?"</p>

  <p>"There is a way for letting cases down from the street," the man replied,
  "but that is almost perpendicular, and Jean could not have been hidden there
  or gone out that way. I know a short time ago there came men who searched
  those cellars, searched them carefully, yard by yard. They found no other
  exit. It was for that they were looking. To-day I know that they were wrong.
  There is another exit. That is all I have to say."</p>

  <p>"I do not quite understand, after all," Constance remarked, "why you have
  come to me. You have realized that I was interested in the restaurant, but is
  that all?"</p>

  <p>The man took up his hat slowly.</p>

  <p>"I know," he declared, "that you are an enemy of the place. I have seen
  Jean's face grow black when you have entered. I have heard orders given that
  you were to be served slowly and badly. I know that for some reason they are
  afraid of you there. Therefore, it seemed to me that, hating the place as I
  do, you were the person to whom I might bring the little information I
  have."</p>

  <p>Brooke put his hand in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"If a trifling loan," he suggested, "while you are out of work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall accept it with pleasure, sir," the man replied. "And if anything
  should come of this?"</p>

  <p>He wrote down his address upon a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>"There may be other questions," he continued, "matters which have seemed
  to me unimportant."</p>

  <p>"There is just one thing I should like to ask you," Constance said, as he
  turned to go. "Besides myself there seems to be one <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of
  the place from the general public&mdash;a little man with gold glasses, who
  is always reading a paper. They treat him almost as rudely as they do
  me."</p>

  <p>The musician nodded.</p>

  <p>"He is a doctor, miss," he told her, "who has a surgery near. That is all
  I know. I have seen them look at him., also, as though they wished him
  somewhere else. He comes in, I think, because it is near his place. They
  serve him, too, badly, but he takes no notice. He reads always more than he
  eats. Good day, miss! Good day, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Entirely as a matter of business," Brooke proposed, as the door closed
  behind their visitor, "I suggest that we dine to-night at the Caf&eacute;
  Hollande."</p>

  <p>"It would perhaps be advisable," Constance assented.</p>

  <p>They were met at the head of the stairs by Jean, who hurried along the
  crowded room towards them.</p>

  <p>"If I could only persuade mademoiselle," he begged, "to dine here! I will
  arrange a round table for two. Downstairs it is so <i>triste</i> and
  damp."</p>

  <p>"Another time, Jean," Brooke declared.</p>

  <p>"I have been away, and we have a little matter to talk over, mademoiselle
  and I. We like the quiet down there."</p>

  <p>Jean shrugged his shoulders. It was unaccountable. However, it must be as
  mademoiselle preferred. He escorted them down the stairs himself.</p>

  <p>"We are having plans made," he confided to them, "for turning this into a
  large grill-room. It is only the kitchen accommodation which is difficult.
  Mademoiselle will like her accustomed seat?"</p>

  <p>They decided to move farther into the corner, however, and found
  themselves at the next table to the little gentleman with the gold
  spectacles, who favored them with a bland but benevolent stare. He called
  Jean to him.</p>

  <p>"Waiter," he said, in a smooth, cultivated voice, "I have dined here for
  two months and I have never made a complaint."</p>

  <p>"I am glad that monsieur has been so well served," Jean remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have been abominably served," was the indignant reply. "I care little
  for my food. I come here only because it is quiet and because I may read and
  because it is near my work. But even a worm will turn. I desire to inform you
  that your food is the worst I have ever tasted, that it reaches me half cold,
  that your service is abominable and your charges exorbitant. After to-night I
  shall look for another restaurant. It is all."</p>

  <p>The natural instinct of the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> seemed for
  the moment to triumph in Jean. He started to make apologies, but the little
  man waved him away.</p>

  <p>"It is my first complaint," he declared.</p>

  <p>"It is my last."</p>

  <p>Jean departed. The little man was settling down again to his papers. He
  glanced for a moment, however, at Constance.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that I have not made myself objectionable? You,
  madam, also have been, I believe, an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> here. I must
  confess that I wonder at it." Constance smiled.</p>

  <p>"I certainly have not come here to dine&mdash;well or cheaply," she
  admitted. "I think really I have come because I am fond of the unusual and
  because there is something about the place which rather mystifies me."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" the little gentleman asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Just an idea."</p>

  <p>The little gentleman drew his newspaper closer to him.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "I have no faith in ideas. I am a physician. Science is
  at once my mistress and my hobby. It provides me with all the mysteries I
  require. As for this place, it is nothing but a drafty, ill-managed hole. I
  have finished with it. Pardon me."</p>

  <p>He plunged into his paper with the air of one who has concluded a
  conversation. There were only two other customers in the room&mdash;one a
  powerful, sunburnt man in tweed clothes, who sat with a bottle of wine in
  front of him and a newspaper propped up against it, dining, apparently,
  entirely to his satisfaction. The other had the appearance of being one of
  the staff. The dinner was a little better than usual, and curiously enough it
  was served almost precipitately.</p>

  <p>"One would imagine," Brooke remarked, "that they wanted to get rid of
  us."</p>

  <p>Constance looked around the room. The tablecloths had been removed from
  the other tables and there were no signs of any other diners being
  expected.</p>

  <p>"What about our friend there?" she inquired, moving her head slightly
  towards the sunburnt man.</p>

  <p>"A countryman or colonial," Brooke decided, "wandered in here by accident.
  Probably didn't care for it up-stairs because of his clothes and thick
  boots."</p>

  <p>"He looks like that," she admitted. They finished their dinner presently.
  There seemed to be nothing to wait for. The little doctor had lit a pipe and
  was reading over his coffee. The sunburnt man was leaning back in his chair,
  apparently thoroughly satisfied with his dinner. As they passed out, Brooke
  obeyed a sudden impulse and spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I take one of your matches?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man pushed them to him without a word. Brooke made some difficulty
  about striking one.</p>

  <p>"Everything down here seems damp," he remarked. "Gives one the feeling of
  being half underground, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>The sunburnt man looked up at Brooke and frowned. Then he turned a little
  away, crossing his legs, and took up his paper again.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't noticed it," he declared, shortly.</p>

  <p>Brooke caught Constance up, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Your friend with the red cheeks," he told her, "has about the worst
  manners of any man I ever knew. He seemed afraid of being spoken to." She
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"I noticed that he didn't .seem to take to you," she remarked. "At any
  rate, he seems very well able to take care of himself." They passed Jean,
  descending the stairs with a bottle of old brandy in his hand. Brooke left
  the place almost reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Constance asked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that fellow's all right," Brooke said thoughtfully. "The little
  doctor was just getting up to go as we came away. He will be the last one in
  the room."</p>

  <p>"I never saw any one who looked better able to take care of himself,"
  Constance murmured.</p>

  <p>The night was hot, the streets were light as day. As though by common
  consent, they walked. At the corner of Piccadilly Circus, Brooke halted.</p>

  <p>"What do you say to a ride on the top of a motor omnibus?" he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"It would perhaps be pleasant," she assented.</p>

  <p>"There's one at the corner there, for Hampstead," he said. "Come."</p>

  <p>They were crossing the road when Constance felt a light touch on her arm.
  She turned quickly around. Inspector Simmons of Scotland Yard was walking by
  her side.</p>

  <p>"Stroke of luck, seeing you. Miss Robinson," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think so," she answered.</p>

  <p>"You know Mr. Brooke, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simmons bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do. Sorry! I only caught sight of you that moment. Are you in
  a hurry, Miss Robinson?"</p>

  <p>"I am never in a hurry," she replied, "if there is anything to be
  done."</p>

  <p>"Will you please both step into the Monico with me, then?" he begged. "We
  will have some coffee. I want to show you a letter."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Constance agreed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Simmons escorted her politely to the door of the restaurant. Brooke
  looked a little regretfully at the top of the motor omnibus, and followed.
  They found a small table against the wall and Mr. Simmons ordered coffee.
  Then he drew from his pocket a letter, which he did not, however, at once
  open.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, "if you have either of you heard of the Eburian
  Copper Mine?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Brooke replied. "The annual meeting is to-morrow, isn't it?
  They say there's going to be an awful row."</p>

  <p>"There probably will be," Mr. Simmons assented. "I know we've orders to
  draft a hundred police down to the Cannon Street Hotel. Let me remind you of
  the facts. Miss Robinson may not know them.</p>

  <p>"There have been six hundred thousand pounds' worth of shares issued and
  paid for on the strength of certain reports. A month ago there was a
  sensational article in the <i>Financial Times</i>, absolutely discrediting
  the mine. There was a fearful panic, of course, and the company sent out the
  greatest known mining expert&mdash;a man named Haslem&mdash;to make an
  independent report. He has not been allowed to send a telegram or a letter.
  He arrived in London secretly to-night. The meeting is to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Brooke and Constance were both interested now. Their coffee stood before
  them, neglected.</p>

  <p>"To-night," the detective continued, slowly unfolding the letter, "I was
  in my office when this was brought in&mdash;this with an enclosure. I will
  read the letter first. It seems to be from Haslem and it is written from
  Delacher's Hotel:</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR SIR,</p>

  <p class="letter">"I received the enclosed letter on my arrival in London
  this evening. I am sending it on to you as a matter of form, for I think 1
  can take care of myself. You may know me by name. I have to give evidence at
  the Cannon Street Hotel tomorrow with regard to the Eburian Mine.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Faithfully,</p>

  <p class="letter">"JOHN HASLEM."</p>

  <p>Brooke and Constance had exchanged swift glances.</p>

  <p>"Delacher's Hotel!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Now for the enclosure," Mr. Simmons continued. "Here it is&mdash;the
  usual sort of thing&mdash;plain paper, typewritten, and all the rest of it.
  Let me read it:</p><br>

  <p class="note"><tt>"MR. HASLEM.</tt></p>

  <p class="note"><tt>"SIR,</tt></p>

  <p class="note"><tt>"To-morrow you are going to give evidence which will
  practically ruin half-a-dozen of the most unscrupulous company promoters in
  London. .Read the advice of a friend. Take care of yourself to-night. London
  is not altogether the city of safety one is apt to believe.</tt></p>

  <p class="note"><tt>"FROM ONE WHO KNOWS."</tt></p><br>

  <p>"What have you done about this?" Brooke asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"I sent a new man whom no one would recognize, to Delacher's Hotel," Mr.
  Simmons announced. "He did his work quite satisfactorily. Haslem arrived at
  about five o'clock and must have sent that note off to me very soon
  afterwards. He took a bedroom and asked Paul, the head porter, for some quiet
  place where he could dine without being noticed, as he didn't wish to be seen
  in London at all till next day. Paul directed him to&mdash;where do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>Constance was sitting quite still. Her eyes seemed to have grown
  larger.</p>

  <p>"To the Caf&eacute; Hollande!" she cried. The inspector smiled a little
  indulgently.</p>

  <p>"I know you have that place on the brain, Miss Robinson," he said.
  "Personally, as I've searched it plank by plank, I don't exactly&mdash;why,
  what's the matter?" Constance was already half-way towards the door. Brooke
  dragged the inspector to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Haslem was at the Caf&eacute; Hollande when we left," he exclaimed, "and,
  by Heaven, he wasn't there for nothing! Quick! We'll explain on the way."
  They hurried into a taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Look here," Brooke said, "notwithstanding your search Mr. Simmons,
  there's something wrong about that place. Paul sent Dupoy there, and you know
  what happened to him. Haslem is another man with enemies. I tell you he was
  sitting down there twenty minutes ago. They'd got him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Simmons was an unprejudiced person. To a certain extent he believed in
  Constance, and he believed in Brooke.</p>

  <p>"We'll fetch him out, then, at any rate," he declared. "Is there likely to
  be any trouble, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"If so, we can deal with it," Brooke replied. "Miss Robinson can stay
  outside and bring in a policeman or two after us, if we don't reappear."</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson will do nothing of the sort," she retorted. "If this is any
  one's affair, it's mine."</p>

  <p>The taxicab pulled up at the corner. They all three hurried across the
  pavement. The upper room was still filled with a cheerful crowd. They
  hastened towards the staircase. A waiter intercepted them.</p>

  <p>"It is closed down-stairs, monsieur," he announced.</p>

  <p>Brooke flung him out of the way. They descended quickly. The band had
  ceased to play, half the lights were out, the doctor had left.</p>

  <p>Only Jean was there, standing by the table at which Haslem had been
  sitting. There was a broken glass upon the floor, the tablecloth seemed to
  have been dragged sideways. Jean himself was swiftly setting things to
  rights.</p>

  <p>He started and turned round as he heard footsteps. His face was suddenly
  almost ghastly. He clutched at the table and stared at them.</p>

  <p>"Where is the man who was sitting at that table?" Brooke demanded.</p>

  <p>"He has left, monsieur," Jean faltered, "five minutes ago. He had had too
  much to drink."</p>

  <p>Brooke glanced towards the other vacant table.</p>

  <p>"And the doctor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He left at nine o'clock, as usual, sir," Jean answered. "He never varies
  his time. He has patients to receive." For one second Brooke hesitated. His
  first impulse was to plunge down into the cellar. Then Constance seized him
  by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" she almost sobbed into his ear. "Quick!"</p>

  <p>She tore up the stairs and they followed her. She flashed through the
  restaurant, through the swing doors, out into the street and turned sharply
  down the narrow thoroughfare past the left hand side of the building.</p>

  <p>Brooke and Simmons were only a few yards behind. At the end of the
  restaurant premises stood a narrow house, on the door of which was a brass
  plate. Outside in the street an ambulance wagon was standing.</p>

  <p>Constance leaned with her finger upon the bell. The man looked over from
  the box seat of the ambulance. He was half frightened, half angry.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that!" he cried. "There's some one ill inside."</p>

  <p>They took no notice of him. They heard footsteps in the hall. The door was
  cautiously opened by a woman dressed like a hospital nurse. They broke past
  her and Brooke threw open the door of the room on the left.</p>

  <p>Haslem was there, unconscious, breathing heavily, stretched out on what
  seemed to be an operating table. The little doctor with the gold spectacles,
  dressed now in a long linen smock, turned and faced them. Outside, they could
  hear the ambulance galloping away.</p>

  <p>"Drop that knife," Brooke shouted, "or, by Heaven, I'll wring your
  neck!"</p>

  <p>The knife slipped from the man's fingers. For a moment there was silence.
  A draft was blowing through the room. Brooke glanced away for a single
  second; a door in the wall stood a little ajar.</p>

  <p>"Take that fellow, Simmons," Brooke ordered. "We must get a doctor at
  once."</p>

  <p>The little man with the gold glasses beamed upon them.</p>

  <p>"My friends from the Caf&eacute; Hollande!" he remarked. "After all, then,
  the young lady has wits. Pardon!"</p>

  <p>His fingers flashed from his waistcoat pocket to his mouth. He waved
  Brooke away as he sank into an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"Quite unnecessary," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I shall be dead within five minutes. Another martyr to the cause of
  science! I never could resist these little affairs. One learned so much."</p>

  <br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. HASLEM was able, after all, to give his evidence at the
  Cannon Street Hotel on the following day, but would-be lunchers at the
  Caf&eacute; Hollande were disappointed. The doors of the restaurant were
  closed, without any reason with which the public was ever made aware other
  than the painfully sudden death of the proprietor, and Jean&mdash;his chief
  <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>.</p>

  <p>The disappearance of Paul was wrapped in mystery. He received a telephone
  message late in the evening and strolled away from the hotel in his full
  uniform a few minutes later. When the police arrived, he was not to be found.
  His escape was one of those episodes not mentioned by persons of tact before
  Inspector Simmons. Brooke and Constance stood outside the restaurant the next
  morning and watched the locked doors with complete satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"At last," she sighed, "I can go back to my dear little caf&eacute;. Already I am
  longing for one of Charles's omelettes."</p>

  <p>"On this occasion only," Brooke started to plead.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she acceded, "you may come."</p>

  <h2>THE SILENT PEOPLE</h2>

  <h4>BEING THE SEVENTH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Jun 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">ON the first Sunday in May there occurred in the heart of
  London a tragedy simple enough in itself, yet with a strange and sinister
  meaning for those who cared to study life a little way beneath its exterior
  crust. Among the well-dressed crowd of London's fashionable people swarming
  in Hyde Park between midday and one o'clock on Sunday a woman, whose rags
  were only partially concealed by a rusty black shawl, was seen suddenly to
  reel and fall. She was picked up dead. Upon the bosom of her threadbare gown
  were pinned a few words of writing, which afforded to the smug press of the
  country an opportunity for many rhetorical flourishes. They led, too, to
  other and more serious things, for there were those who accepted them as a
  message.</p>

  <p>These were the words, written -very correctly in faint but straggling
  characters upon a half sheet of coarse white paper:</p>

  <p class="letter">I am thirty years old. I am going to die. I am tired out.
  There is no hope in this world for the poor. I have done my best. I have a
  husband and four children. My husband earns twenty-one shillings a week. I
  cannot feed him, myself, and four children on twenty-one shillings a week. I
  have tried.</p>

  <p class="letter">My children are thin and hungry. My husband never smiles.
  He, too, is losing his strength. I myself am the withered remnant of a woman.
  I have no hope. I know that there is a life, but, for some reason, I am not
  asked to share in it. This morning, for once, I go to see the sunshine. I go
  to see the other women. Perhaps I shall understand what it is they have done
  to deserve life and I have not done. And then I shall rest.</p>

  <p>When the newspapers had finished with their stories, and a satisfactory
  fund had been raised for the children of the dead woman, things began to
  happen.</p>

  <p>A millionaire employer of labor, who had closed his yards and turned
  seventeen hundred people into the streets because one of the commodities used
  by him had reached a price which he declared made his business unprofitable,
  was shot dead as he crossed the pavement from his house in Park Lane to step
  into his motor-car. His murderer turned out to be one of his unemployed work
  people whose wife had gone on the streets to find bread for her starving
  children. The man defended himself from the dock with a rough eloquence which
  paralyzed even the law.</p>

  <p>Within a few days other events happened which pointed to some systematic
  effort. Four factories in different parts of the country, whose owners were
  deservedly unpopular, were destroyed either by dynamite or fire. A
  trades-union official, who was reported to have accepted a bribe from a
  federation of employers to prohibit a strike, even though he was in
  possession of large funds subscribed by the work people, was missed for
  several days and discovered with a cord around his neck in the Thames.</p>

  <p>Then a leading daily paper published a mysterious document which had been
  dropped into its letter-box by an unknown hand. It was headed:</p>

  <p class="headline">TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND!&acute;</p>

  <p class="quote">There are millions who have been waiting for a sign. Eleven
  days ago a woman died in Hyde Park, and the message found pinned to the rags
  which covered her withered body has been accepted as that sign. England is
  governed by laws&mdash;laws ill-made by man for his kind. The old laws are
  hard to break; the new laws are difficult to frame. From our place in the
  wilderness we who send this message have spent many weary hours pondering
  over the great subject&mdash;how and in what fashion shall we make heard the
  voice of the sufferers?</p>

  <p class="quote">A short time ago hundreds of women, nourished in comfortable
  homes, educated, civilized, apparently respectable, called attention to a
  grievance from which they imagined themselves to be suffering by great and
  wanton destruction of property. Their grievance is to ours as the light of a
  candle to the burning of the sun. There are those who have approved their
  methods. They have taught us a lesson. Cause and effect shall be dissociated
  in our minds. Until you listen to us we will kill, burn, and destroy. When
  the moment has come we will point to you the way to freedom.</p>

  <p class="quote">To-morrow the king drives through the city to the Mansion
  House. The king to-morrow will be safe. But between Ludgate Bridge and St.
  Paul's Cathedral one of the horses drawing his coach will be destroyed.</p>

  <p class="quote">THE SILENT PEOPLE.</p>

  <p>This document was scoffed at by nearly every one who read it. Even the
  editor of the paper was derided for publishing an anonymous hoax. That
  morning, however, half-way up Ludgate Hill, a spectator was seen to break
  through the little line and, taking a deliberate aim, to shoot one of the
  horses of the king's coach through the head.</p>

  <p>He was at once arrested&mdash;in fact, he made no effort to escape. He
  made no reply to the charge and remained absolutely dumb, both at the time
  and subsequently. He was committed to prison during the king's pleasure, a
  fate to which he submitted with the utmost indifference. On the following day
  the letter-box of the <i>Daily Observer</i> was watched by the cleverest
  detectives in London. The subeditor, however, discovered in the morning
  another communication among the rest of his correspondence. This document was
  headed in the same way:</p>

  <p class="headline">TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND!</p>

  <p class="quote">We have a thousand men like William Clarke ready to do our
  bidding; ready to kill, burn, or destroy, as we choose. We are tired of our
  labor members and our magazine-writing socialists. The people speak now for
  themselves. We adopt the tactics of a more educated class. On Thursday one of
  the masterpieces in The National Gallery will be destroyed.</p>

  <p class="quote">THE SILENT PEOPLE.</p>

  <p>This time, short of closing the National Gallery, every possible
  precaution was taken, but about three o'clock in the afternoon the Madonna of
  Giotto was discovered cut into strips.</p>

  <p>The perpetrator of the deed was easily arrested. His name was Johnson. He
  was a weaver by trade, out of work, and poorly dressed.</p>

  <p>He made no reply to the charge, no reply in the police court, and,
  refusing to answer the simplest questions, he was committed to prison
  indefinitely.</p>

  <p>On the third day another communication was received and published in
  <i>The Observer</i>:</p>

  <p class="quote">We of the people have been accused always of ranting, of
  shouting our wrongs from the house-tops. Let us hope that our new tactics
  will be approved. We have left off words. We have come to deeds, and those
  who do our bidding have learned silence. To-morrow there will be wrecked the
  house of one whose name is held by us as the name of an enemy.</p>

  <p class="quote">THE SILENT PEOPLE.</p>

  <p>Throughout London a certain thrill of anticipation seemed to quiver in the
  air from hour to hour. Who was there who could be called an enemy of the
  people? In great black head-lines the evening papers told the story.</p>

  <p>In a suburb of London the house of a member of the government who had
  risen from the ranks, and to whom such measures for the relief of the poor
  which a temporizing government had devised had lately been entrusted, was
  completely wrecked.</p>

  <p>The man himself had escaped, but his house was in ruins. He stood branded
  as an enemy of the people. On this occasion the thrower of the bomb remained
  undiscovered. The house was one of those which had been left unwatched.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was about this time that Stanley Brooke made a thrilling
  and amazing discovery, which at first threatened seriously to alter his
  relations with his partner. He arrived home unexpectedly early one night to
  find a note asking him to call in and report. He discovered the door of her
  flat unfastened and the door of the inner room wide open. Hearing his
  footsteps, she called out:</p>

  <p>"Please come here at once."</p>

  <p>After a moment's hesitation he obeyed. He advanced even to the threshold
  of the inner room and, for the first time, saw inside. He stood quite still,
  transfixed with surprise.</p>

  <p>Every detail of her sitting-room was always rigidly reminiscent of
  Constance herself. Even the easy chairs were a little severe, and the
  furniture which she had added from time to time was of a somber and decorous
  type. Her color-scheme was gray; the pictures which hung upon the walls were
  nearly all landscapes; her whole environment always seemed so thoroughly in
  keeping with her clothes, her manner of speech itself of prim, almost
  Quakerish simplicity.</p>

  <p>He had pictured her own room as something like this: a simple bedstead, a
  few prints, an apartment clean and bare and chaste. He looked instead into a
  chamber utterly unlike anything he could have imagined.</p>

  <p>The walls were colored a faint rose-pink, and there was a carpet on the
  floor of almost the same hue. The bedstead was of white, with a top of hooded
  muslin tied up with ribbons. There was an easy chair and a large divan,
  chintz-covered, luxurious; a dressing-table covered with dainty trifles; and
  on the bed, by the side of an empty basket, a little heap of garments which
  seemed to him like a sea of lace and muslin, with blue ribbons stealing from
  unexpected places.</p>

  <p>Everything was spotless, exquisitely dainty. It might well have been the
  sleeping apartment of a princess.</p>

  <p>Brooke stood rooted to the spot. His final shock of amazement came when he
  realized that Constance herself was wearing a dressing-gown of white muslin,
  that she seemed like a bewildering vision of fluffiness and laces and
  ribbons. He was absolutely incapable of any form of speech. He simply stood
  and stared while her face grew darker.</p>

  <p>"How dare you?" she exclaimed, advancing rapidly toward the door.</p>

  <p>"You called me," he declared. "I got your note and hurried down. When I
  came inside you called me."</p>

  <p>"I thought it was Susan, you idiot!" she retorted, slamming the door in
  his face.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly away. The maid whom Constance had recently engaged for
  several hours a day entered hurriedly, almost at the same moment, from the
  outside door. She smiled at Brooke as she passed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that Miss Robinson will think I have been gone a long time,
  sir," she remarked. "I could not find the shop."</p>

  <p>She disappeared, closing the door behind her. Brooke threw himself into an
  easy chair. So there was another Constance, after all, a Constance who loved
  the things a woman should love, a Constance who was as dainty and sweet as
  anything he could have conceived in his most sentimental moments.</p>

  <p>He felt his heart beating with the pleasure of it. Her life, then, was to
  some extent a pose. At heart she was like other girls. He sat with
  half-closed eyes, dwelling upon those few seconds&mdash;seconds full of
  exquisite imaginings.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that he had never in his life looked upon anything more
  beautiful than that little chamber and its contents. Even Constance, when she
  at last appeared, could not dispel his dreams. She was dressed in severe and
  homely black, unrelieved even at the neck. A vision he seemed to have had of
  silk stockings was dissipated by the sight of her square-toed shoes. She came
  toward him in an absolutely matter-of-fact way. He rose, a little
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"If I was rude just now," she said calmly, "I am sorry. The fault, I
  suppose, was mine."</p>

  <p>"I certainly," he explained, "would not have dreamed of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do," she interrupted. "We will not discuss the subject again,
  ever. I hope you will humor me so far as to forget the occurrence. I sent for
  you because I wanted to talk."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is three weeks since we did anything."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing definite to propose now," she went on. "I wanted to speak
  about the Silent People."</p>

  <p>"There is a reward of a thousand pounds offered this morning," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"They are doing all they can to break the thing up," she said. "People are
  growing uneasy. The question is whether, supposing we were successful where
  others have failed, we. could take that thousand pounds' reward with a clear
  conscience."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I am not at all sure," she continued, "that my sympathies are
  not with the Silent People."</p>

  <p>Brooke, whose habits of mind were conventional, even though his views were
  broad enough, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"One may see weak points in our laws, in our whole social system," he
  observed, "but the attacks made upon it must be legitimate. I say that it is
  the duty of every one to uphold the law."</p>

  <p>"Yours," she replied, "is the point of view of the man in the street. I
  will not tell you exactly what I think. Only this&mdash;if you join with me
  in a certain scheme which I am about to propose, it must be on this one
  condition only: that in the event of success, the claiming of that
  reward&mdash;that is to say, the denouncing of these people&mdash;must rest
  with me."</p>

  <p>"I do not mind that," he assented.</p>

  <p>"You understand," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"Even if we are successful&mdash;supposing we find out who it is that
  writes those notices and who has planned these outrages&mdash;if I decide
  that the knowledge is to be forgotten, it must be so."</p>

  <p>"I agree," he said. "I think that your instinct will be too strong for
  your humanitarianism."</p>

  <p>"We shall see," she rejoined. "There are a good many threads hanging
  loose, a good many which have been tried already and thrown on one side. Now
  tell me, you have done what I asked you this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was at the House of Commons at four o'clock. I heard Cammerley bring in
  his bill."</p>

  <p>"What did you think of him?" Brooke hesitated.</p>

  <p>"At first," he said thoughtfully, "I was disappointed. Then he began to
  impress me. His is rather a curious personality. Nothing about him suggests
  in any way a leader of the people. He has a thin frame, he stoops, and he
  wears gold-rimmed spectacles. He spoke almost without gestures and his voice
  at times was quite low. It was not until he had been speaking for some time
  that one realized that he was, after all, in his way an orator.</p>

  <p>"He had no notes, he spoke with perfect assurance, and he said some
  startling things. But he didn't attempt to make the points that these labor
  men nearly always do. There wasn't a touch of rhetoric in anything he said.
  He simply spoke of the coming of the people as though it were written."</p>

  <p>"He believes that," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"On the whole," Brooke concluded, "I should put him down as a dangerous
  man."</p>

  <p>"Why dangerous?"</p>

  <p>"He is a revolutionary. One could almost imagine him a Robespierre."</p>

  <p>"Even that," she remarked, "may come."</p>

  <p>"And now," he asked, "tell me exactly why you wanted me to hear him. You
  had some reason."</p>

  <p>"I had," she admitted. "I think that if you could see inside his brain you
  wouldn't have much trouble in earning that thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"He is one of the Silent People!" Brooke exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Constance waited for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You know," she said then, "that I am a member of the Forward Club?"</p>

  <p>"You told me so the other night," he replied. "I remember how surprised I
  was."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for you to be surprised at," she continued calmly.
  "Anyhow, I was there the other afternoon. Cammerley was having tea with a
  woman at the next table. They were talking together earnestly. You know how
  acute my hearing is. I caught a single sentence. It was enough."</p>

  <p>Brooke was obviously interested.</p>

  <p>"If Cammerley is really mixed up with those people," he said, "it would
  cause a sensation if it were known. He has been getting quite a little
  following of his own lately. The other side have rather taken him up. The
  <i>Daily Mail</i> had a leading article on him one day last week."</p>

  <p>"Why not? He is a strong man. In a few years' time, unless accidents
  happen, the country will have to reckon with him."</p>

  <p>"Accidents?"</p>

  <p>"I mean if he does not come to grief," she explained. "It is his pose at
  present to be a moderate man. They say that at heart he is a red-hot
  anarchist, ready to sacrifice the country, the lives of millions, if
  necessary, to his principles. That is why I wonder whether we should not be
  doing good rather than harm if we were to take that thousand pounds'
  reward."</p>

  <p>"You would have to get your proofs first," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"We might fail," she admitted. "On the other hand, we might succeed. What
  I cannot make up my mind about is whether we might not do more harm by
  succeeding."</p>

  <p>"But you are not a socialist yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure about that," she answered.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. It was certainly not the place or the time for
  arguments.</p>

  <p>"In any case," he begged, "tell me just what you have in your mind."</p>

  <p>"You are still in touch with the <i>Daily Observer</i> people," she said.
  "Well, go and interview Mr. Cammerley on their behalf. Talk to him in his own
  house. See if anything occurs to you."</p>

  <p>"No hints?"</p>

  <p>"None. I am not keeping anything from you. I simply heard a sentence pass
  between him and a woman whom I know very well by repute. Go and see what you
  think of him."</p>

  <p>Brooke glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to-morrow," he promised; "&mdash;but in the mean time?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to dine at my club tonight," she interrupted, a little
  ruthlessly. "I shall be leaving in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like to take me with you, I suppose?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I should dislike it very much indeed," she replied. "I don't see the
  slightest reason why I should pay for your dinner."</p>

  <p>"It's only eighteen pence," he ventured hopefully.</p>

  <p>"The amount is not so serious, perhaps," she admitted. "It is the
  principle. Besides, I want to make a few inquiries there about Mr.
  Cammerley's friends. I shall be better alone."</p>

  <p>"Constance," he began, suddenly inspired by a recollection of that little
  room. Her eyes flashed a warning.</p>

  <p>"I consider the use of my Christian name a liberty, Mr. Brooke!" He turned
  on his heel and went out. It was not until he had left the room that her lips
  relaxed in the least. Then she smiled.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">BROOKE presented himself at two o'clock the next day at a
  large and gloomy-looking house in Bermondsey, a house which had once belonged
  to a manufacturer of leather who had chosen to live near his works, but which
  stood now in almost pitiful isolation, with a tan-yard at the back of it and
  a row of small shops on either side.</p>

  <p>A woman admitted him, a woman who was neatly dressed but who wore no cap
  and had not the manners of a servant. He passed along a bare hall and was
  shown into a large, untidy-looking study. Mr. Cammerley looked up from his
  desk as Brooke approached, but did not offer his hand or attempt any form of
  conventional greeting. He pointed, however, to a plain deal chair close at
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," he said, "why you have come to see me. Your card
  says that you are a journalist. One paper has already turned me inside out
  and indulged in a photographic representation of the person I am not, and
  given a faithful description of the things I did not say and the views which
  I do not hold. Surely one is enough?"</p>

  <p>"These are curious days," Brooke remarked, setting his hat upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"The whole reading public is crazy for personalities."</p>

  <p>The man behind the desk looked at him steadfastly. It seemed to Brooke
  that those light-colored eyes were growing larger behind his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"What is the name of your paper?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am a reporter on the <i>Daily Observer</i>," Brooke told him.</p>

  <p>"You are also a liar," Mr. Cammerley said calmly. "Your name is Brooke,
  and, with a certain young lady as your partner, you have been teaching
  Scotland Yard its business for the last few months. Now, sir, what the devil
  do you mean by coming to see me under false pretenses? Is there any mystery
  connected with me or my life? Is there anything you wish to discover?"</p>

  <p>Brooke shut up his note-book. He had the curious sense of being in the
  presence of a man who could read his innermost thoughts.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," he confessed, "I was wondering whether you could
  not give me some information with regard to the Silent People?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cammerley continued to look steadily at him.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I could," he asked, "why should I? You are a stranger to me.
  There is a thousand pounds' reward, I believe, offered for information about
  these people. Why should you associate me with them in any way?"</p>

  <p>"You are a socialist," Brooke reminded him. "You speak with wonderful
  restraint, but that very restraint is impressive. I heard you yesterday
  afternoon in the House of Commons. I may be wrong, but to me you seemed to
  represent the type of man who would go to any lengths if he considered
  himself justified by his principles."</p>

  <p>"For an inquiry agent," Mr. Cammerley declared, "you certainly do seem to
  be possessed of a certain amount of perception as regards elementary facts.
  How much of this interview is going in your paper, Mr. Brooke?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word," Brooke replied.</p>

  <p>"So I imagined," Mr. Cammerley remarked dryly. "Then listen. You are
  right. I am an anarchist, if you like to use the word. That is to say, I
  would, if I had the power, rend this country from north to south that the
  better days might dawn. I would do evil that good may come."</p>

  <p>"It is a dangerous doctrine."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cammerley raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"A surgeon cuts off your leg that he may save your life."</p>

  <p>"He obeys fixed laws," Brooke retorted, "and disease is a matter of fact,
  not principle."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cammerley smiled indulgently. He glanced at the papers before him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brooke," he said, "you are wasting my time. I have no desire to make
  a convert of you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me something about the Silent People," Brooke persisted, "and I will
  go."</p>

  <p>Cammerley rose slowly from his place and moved to the door. He held it
  open and turned his face toward the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Lucy!" he called.</p>

  <p>An answer came from above. Cammerley remained with the door open. In a few
  moments a woman appeared, a woman broadly built, with a dark, square face, a
  slight down upon the upper lip, and beautiful eyes&mdash;the eyes of an
  enthusiast. Her hair was parted simply in the middle. It was black and shiny,
  and there were large quantities of it. Her dress was plain in the extreme.
  She looked from Cammerley to Brooke.</p>

  <p>"It is a young man," Cammerley explained softly, "who has come here in the
  guise of a reporter to know if I can tell him anything about the Silent
  People." Not a muscle of her face changed, only a sudden light shone in her
  eyes. Brooke, who was glancing at her, shivered. For some mysterious reason
  he felt that he was in danger.</p>

  <p>"This visitor of ours," Cammerley continued, looking at Brooke
  dispassionately, "has been associated with a young lady in various
  investigations during the last few months. He would call himself, I suppose,
  a private-inquiry agent, or something of the sort. He has become interested
  in the craze of the moment. He is exceedingly curious about the Silent
  People." The woman sighed. When she spoke it was with a slight foreign
  accent.</p>

  <p>"What is it that one hears about them?" she murmured. "There have been
  others who have sought to discover their identity&mdash;others who are
  themselves silent now forever."</p>

  <p>"The young man," Cammerley said thoughtfully, "is of a harmless type."</p>

  <p>Brooke, as he stood there, was conscious of soft footsteps in the
  hall&mdash;footsteps which seemed to gather volume all the time, not the
  footsteps of one or two people, but the footsteps of dozens.</p>

  <p>"You were looking for adventures, perhaps, my young friend," Cammerley
  continued.</p>

  <p>"You have been successful. Some one who visited me once remarked that this
  might well be a house of mysteries, so strangely situated in "such a
  neighborhood. Perhaps it is. Look!"</p>

  <p>He pushed the door a little further open. The hall seemed filled with
  men&mdash;men who were waiting patiently, men who exchanged not a syllable,
  pale-faced most of them, dressed in the garb of operatives, with something
  curious about them which, although he did not understand it, made Brooke
  shiver. Cammerley closed the door again.</p>

  <p>"As I think you already knew before you came," he said quietly, "you are
  in the presence of the Silent People&mdash;Lucy Fragade and I myself. Those
  outside have also learned the gift of silence. They are some of those who do
  our bidding."</p>

  <p>Brooke stared at the woman. The name was well enough known to
  him&mdash;Lucy Fragade, who had been expelled from Russia, imprisoned in
  America, imprisoned again in Germany, and forced to escape from France; the
  daughter of an anarchist, a woman who preached force and bloodshed with an
  eloquence which no man of her cause had ever approached. He recognized her
  from her portraits. She was gazing at him fixedly. She was more like them now
  than ever.</p>

  <p>"There is a room at the back of this house," Cammerley continued, "into
  which others have been invited who have come as you have come, and the world
  has seen no more of them. The river flows within forty yards of my back door,
  and the tanyard is empty at night. I am afraid, Mr. Brooke, that the public
  will have to wait a little time for that interview with me which you proposed
  writing."</p>

  <p>Brooke looked from one to the other. Up to the present moment, at any
  rate, he had felt no fear. Yet there was something a little disquieting in
  the expression with which they regarded him; something ominous, too, in that
  sense of men waiting without. He remembered several disappearances lately. He
  knew suddenly that murder had been done in this place. Yet he was still
  without fear. Perhaps he was, to some extent, a fatalist. Death seemed to him
  always a thing so unlikely.</p>

  <p>"I shall be missed," he remarked affably. "Miss Robinson knows that I have
  come to see you."</p>

  <p>Cammerley nodded.</p>

  <p>"The young lady who overheard our conversation at the Forward Club," he
  explained to Lucy. "It is a pity that she did not accompany you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Brooke replied, "she is better where she is!"</p>

  <p>The telephone-bell rang. Cammerley held the receiver to his ear.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Cammerley speaking," he declared. "What can I do for you?
  Yes, Mr. Brooke is here. You are Miss Constance Robinson."</p>

  <p>Brooke made a movement toward the telephone, but stopped.</p>

  <p>"No, I am afraid that I cannot say," Cammerley continued, "what time Mr.
  Brooke will return. He will leave this room in a few minutes. As for the
  rest, it is difficult. Yes, I understand." He listened for some time. His
  face showed no change of expression. He glanced toward the clock.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "the course you suggest will be quite agreeable to
  me. It would give me great pleasure to meet you personally. Yes, pray, come.
  As you say, it is only an affair of ten minutes in a taxicab."</p>

  <p>Brooke sprang toward the telephone.</p>

  <p>"She shall not come here!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cammerley handed him the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "you people are wasting a lot of our time this
  afternoon. Tell her yourself to keep away, then."</p>

  <p>Brooke snatched the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson!" he called out. "Constance, are you there? Constance!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson is here," was the calm reply.</p>

  <p>"You are not to come to this man's house!" Brooke exclaimed. "If you do,
  don't come alone! You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well. There is probably a slight misunderstanding. <i>Au
  revoir</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" Brooke begged.</p>

  <p>The connection was gone. Cammerley removed the instrument out of reach
  with a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Brooke," he said, "the young lady is evidently accustomed to
  having her own way. Who can blame her? Miss Fragade is a little like that,
  too. Now how shall we spend the time until Miss Robinson arrives? Would you
  like to see around the place? Would you care to stroll through the tan-yard
  down to the river? There is a room here which Lucy calls our chamber of
  horrors. Perhaps you would like to see that? Or would you like to make the
  acquaintance of our bodyguard&mdash;fifty strange-looking men? Most of them
  now, I suppose, have gone back to their posts, but there will be a few
  remaining."</p>

  <p>He swung open the door. There were a dozen men still in the hall, standing
  against the wall almost like statues. Their eyes were fixed upon Cammerley.
  They seemed ready to obey his slightest gesture. Brooke glanced at the door;
  Cammerley smiled.</p>

  <p>"The only modern thing about the place," he remarked. "A double lock of
  really wonderful pattern. Would you like to see some of my books? Or would it
  amuse you to hear Lucy talk of her Continental experiences?"</p>

  <p>The telephone-bell rang again. Cammerley spoke, apparently, to a whip in
  the House of Commons.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in my place at four o'clock," Brooke heard him say. "The
  division, I suppose, is not likely to come on before dinner-time? Thank
  you!</p>

  <p>"An interesting thing, the telephone," he continued, replacing the
  receiver and turning to Brooke. "It seems to bring one so into touch with the
  outside world from the most impossible places, doesn't it? Ah, the taxicab!
  Stay here, please, Mr. Brooke. Miss Robinson will be properly received,
  without a doubt." Constance was ushered into the room, a moment later, by the
  gray-haired woman who had admitted Brooke. She was, as usual, exceedingly
  quiet in her manner and very self-composed.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Cammerley, is it not?" she inquired, holding out her hand. "And
  I am sure that this is Lucy Fragade? It is very interesting to meet you
  both." Cammerley smiled.</p>

  <p>"Without flattery," he remarked, "I may say that there have been many who
  have found it interesting."</p>

  <p>Constance was standing between Lucy Fragade and Cammerley. She seemed very
  small.</p>

  <p>"I have come," she announced, "to take Mr. Brooke back with me."</p>

  <p>Lucy Fragade looked at her curiously. Cammerley smiled.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brooke was a little lonely," he said. "I have no doubt that he will
  find your coming of benefit to him."</p>

  <p>"Ours must be only a flying visit," Constance continued quietly. "Before I
  go, there is a question I have wanted to ask Mr. Cammerley ever since I knew
  of his existence. This will probably be my only chance. Should I be too
  exacting if I begged for&mdash;say, thirty seconds in which to ask it?"</p>

  <p>"I have no secrets," Cammerley replied. "Pray ask your question."</p>

  <p>Constance looked at him intently.</p>

  <p>"It was a question," she murmured, "which occurred to me first when I
  heard that Blanche Fragade was indeed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lucy Fragade," the woman interrupted. Constance accepted the correction,
  but she did not at once continue. She was looking steadfastly at Cammerley.
  There was perhaps no one else in the room who noticed any change in him. Yet
  Brooke, who was nearest, and who found the temperature of the apartment on
  the cold side, was suddenly surprised to see two little drops of perspiration
  standing out on the man's forehead.</p>

  <p>Cammerley looked toward the woman and said something to her in a tongue
  which neither Brooke nor Constance understood. She nodded and left the
  room.</p>

  <p>Cammerley leaned, a little toward Constance as she passed out.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is there any need?" she asked calmly. "I have a friend in Cyril Mansions.
  The letter is ready for the post&mdash;if we do not return."</p>

  <p>Cammerley's face was, for a moment, like the face of a skeleton. His eyes
  shone large behind his spectacles. His lips had parted, showing his strong,
  yellow teeth.</p>

  <p>"Your terms?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"This is not our affair," Constance said softly. "I was wrong to send him
  here," she added, motioning toward Brooke. "I, too, am of the people. So long
  as it is not life you take, he and I are silent."</p>

  <p>Cammerley asked for no pledge. He understood. For a moment he
  listened.</p>

  <p>Then he led the way toward the door. In the hall several shadowy figures
  came stealing toward them. He waved them back and opened the front door.</p>

  <p>"You will find a taxicab at the corner," he said.</p>

  <p>At the corner of the street they stopped to look around them. Brooke
  glanced back at the house they had left. Behind it was the tan-yard, and a
  little farther away they could see the masts in the river.</p>

  <p>"A queer place," Constance observed composedly. "They say that he is a
  real philanthropist. His house is filled with all sorts of outcasts from the
  streets, to whom he gives temporary shelter. That is the reason he lives
  there."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" Brooke replied dryly. "There is nothing would please me better
  than to go over it with half a dozen policemen at my back."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is forbidden. I think those two people, mistaken though they may be,
  represent things with which we do better not to interfere."</p>

  <p>"At least," Brooke asked, "I may inquire who Blanche is?"</p>

  <p>"But for Blanche," Constance told him, "I should never have suffered you
  to go to that man's house, because I know that they are suspicious of you and
  of me. Blanche is Lucy Fragade's sister. She left her home mysteriously some
  years ago. Lucy does not know where she is. Philip Cammerley does. There are
  only two things in life greater than that woman's devotion to her cause. One
  was her love for her sister; the other her passion for Cammerley. I should
  say that he was a man who feared but one thing in the world. When I spoke he
  saw the possibility of it."</p>

  <p>Brooke handed her into a taxicab.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a weak spot in the life of every strong man," he
  remarked, "and that weak spot is always a woman. Even with myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense!" she interrupted</p>

  <h2>THE GLEN TERRACE TRAGEDY</h2>

  <h4>BEING THE EIGHTH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES<br>
  OF MR. STANLEY BROOKE, THE DELIBERATE DETECTIVE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, Jul 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">BROOKE was conscious of a variety of most disquieting
  sensations. In the first place, he had completely lost his appetite.
  Furthermore, he was furiously and unreasonably angry. Charles hung around him
  continually, aware that all was not well with his favorite patron.</p>

  <p>"It is not one of monsieur's regular days for luncheon here," he ventured.
  Brooke was scowling across the room toward the small table against the wall,
  at which Constance and a companion were seated.</p>

  <p>"It isn't," he admitted. "That accounts for it."</p>

  <p>"Accounts for it, <i>monsieur</i>? But for what?"</p>

  <p>Charles glanced wonderingly across the room&mdash;and understood. The
  perplexity upon his face disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur perceives that the young lady in whom he was interested has
  found a companion," he remarked confidentially.</p>

  <p>"They sit together to-day for the third time. On Tuesday evening he dined
  with mademoiselle!"</p>

  <p>"The devil he did!" Brooke muttered.</p>

  <p>"One notices these things," the waiter continued, glancing around to be
  sure that his services were not required elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"For so many months the young lady has been so retired, so lonely. It was
  monsieur who first spoke of her. Always she sits alone, she is reserved, she
  avoids notice. It is not until one looks carefully that one realizes that
  <i>mademoiselle</i> has an appearance. The gentleman who is with her now,"
  Charles went on, leaning a little closer toward Brooke and dropping his
  voice, "he asked about her one day last week very much as monsieur did."
  Brooke muttered something between his teeth and poured himself out a glass of
  wine.</p>

  <p>"The young lady would probably object to our discussing her," he remarked
  grimly. "You can fetch me my coffee. And this afternoon I will take a
  liqueur&mdash;the old brandy."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur shall be served," Charles murmured, and hastened away. It was
  not until he had served the coffee and generously filled the liqueur-glass
  above the line with the deep-brown brandy that he spoke again. He leaned
  forward confidentially.</p>

  <p>"It is for monsieur's private ear, this," he whispered. "We do not, as a
  rule, speak of such things. The gentleman who is with her now&mdash;he wrote
  a little note to mademoiselle here in the restaurant at luncheon one day.
  Mademoiselle replied, and he took his coffee at her table." Brooke waved the
  man away impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That will do, Charles," he said. "There is probably some explanation. It
  certainly is not our business."</p>

  <p>Brooke lit his cigarette, and while he smoked he looked across the room.
  The man was apparently a little less than middle-aged, dark, with small,
  black mustache, well-groomed, well-dressed. He would, without doubt, rank as
  good-looking. His manner indicated an interest in his companion which to some
  extent, at any rate, she seemed inclined to return. Constance was certainly
  more animated than usual. The pallor of her cheeks was undisturbed, but her
  eyes were exceptionally bright, and she was listening with obvious interest
  to all that her companion had to say. Beyond the faint uplifting of her
  eyebrows and the grave nod with which she had acknowledged his greeting upon
  his entrance, she had taken no further notice of Brooke.</p>

  <p>That no more familiar intercourse should take place between them in public
  beyond that form of recognition was a condition to which she had rigidly
  adhered ever since their strange partnership began. Brooke hated it and
  obeyed. To-day he was more than ever a rebel.</p>

  <p>Presently he paid his bill and went. Constance, although without doubt she
  saw his preparations for departure, took not the slightest further notice of
  him. She was talking all the time, and her manner, for her, toward this new
  acquaintance, was positively friendly. Brooke jammed his hat upon his head
  and walked round to the club.</p>

  <p>"Bridge!" he muttered to himself. "A debauch at bridge, and the Lord help
  my partner!"</p>

  <p>The morning had been hopelessly wet, which was the reason Brooke was not
  playing golf. There was plenty of bridge; there were also billiards and other
  sane amusements to be found at the club. Brooke passed the time away as well
  as he could, but he found it a task of some difficulty. His usual
  cheerfulness seemed to have deserted him. He revoked at bridge, lost two
  games of billiards, and contradicted a member of the committee; altogether a
  disastrous afternoon. About five o'clock, just after he had sent his tea away
  for the second time, a page came in search of him.</p>

  <p>"Wanted on the telephone, sir," he announced. Brooke rose promptly.</p>

  <p>"Any name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There was no name, sir," the boy replied.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman is waiting on the line now."</p>

  <p>Brooke hurried down-stairs, passed into the telephone-box, and took up the
  receiver.</p>

  <p>"This is Brooke," he said. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Simmons," the voice answered. "I am speaking from Miss
  Robinson's rooms."</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Robinson there?" Brooke asked.</p>

  <p>"She is not here at present," the man replied. "I rang up to ask whether
  it would be quite convenient for you to step round here."</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll come," Brooke assented. "There's nothing wrong, is
  there?"</p>

  <p>The voice hesitated a moment.</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of. Perhaps it would be as well if you came round."</p>

  <p>Brooke rang off, put on his hat and coat, caught a taxicab, and in a few
  minutes' time presented himself at Constance's rooms. To his surprise the
  inspector, who admitted him, was still alone there.</p>

  <p>"Where is Miss Robinson?" Brooke demanded.</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I'm not sure about," the inspector explained. "I had
  an appointment with her here this afternoon at three o'clock. I arrived quite
  punctually, rang the bell, and as there was no answer, I went away. I came
  again half an hour ago, and as there was still no one here, I took the
  liberty of entering. Miss Robinson, as a rule, is very particular about her
  appointments."</p>

  <p>"She was lunching with a friend today," Brooke remarked gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Where? What sort of a friend?" the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>Brooke hesitated. The inspector's tone was eager, almost impatient.</p>

  <p>"It was a man I think she met at the Caf&eacute; Lugano, just a restaurant
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Was he dark, with a small, black mustache, brown, freckled complexion,
  well-dressed, looked like a military man?" the inspector asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"That is an exact description of him," Brooke admitted. "Who is he? What
  do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>The inspector glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"What time did you say they were lunching?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Between half past one and two," Brooke replied. "I left them there."</p>

  <p>"That confirms my information," the inspector said, half to himself, "It
  is now past five o'clock. You'll excuse me for a minute, if you please."</p>

  <p>He went to the telephone and gave a few rapid orders. Then he turned round
  to Brooke.</p>

  <p>"You've heard of the Glen Terrace tragedy, Mr. Brooke?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course! What about it?"</p>

  <p>"The man whom you saw lunching with Miss Robinson is the man we are
  shadowing for it," the inspector declared. "We can't arrest him at the moment
  because there isn't sufficient evidence. All that we can do is to watch and
  see that he doesn't get away. I'm as confident that he did it as that I'm
  standing here at this moment, but if we try to put our hands on him too
  quickly, and he once gets away, he is safe for life.</p>

  <p>"Miss Robinson took the matter up entirely on her own account. She had an
  idea that she could get the evidence we are lacking. I told her it wasn't a
  proper case for her to mix herself up in. She only smiled at me. She is a
  determined young lady, as I dare say you know. Anyway, she has been meeting
  this man for the last few days, and she told me to be here at three o'clock.
  She expected, I believe, to have something definite to say. I don't mind
  confessing that I am a little worried about it. It seems&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You say your men are shadowing him?" Brooke interrupted quickly. "Can't
  we find out exactly where he is?"</p>

  <p>"They lost him after leaving the restaurant," the inspector replied. "It
  seems he went in by the hotel and must have come out by the restaurant
  entrance. We could have had our hand upon his shoulder any time during the
  last three months, and there isn't the least chance of his being able to
  escape out of the country. But where he is at this precise moment I must
  admit I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Shall I go to the restaurant," Brooke asked, "and find out if any one
  remembers their leaving?"</p>

  <p>"I have gone as far as that myself," the inspector remarked. "What I was
  told bears out what you say. Miss Robinson and Delamoir left the Caf&eacute; Lugano
  together in a taxicab at five minutes to two." Brooke glanced at the
  clock.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he muttered. "That was more than three hours ago!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THE sun was shining between the showers and the sky was
  unexpectedly blue when Constance and the man with whom she had been lunching
  left the little restaurant in Old Compton Street. They stood for a moment
  upon the pavement, and Constance, with a farewell nod, prepared to turn
  away.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Harold," she said.</p>

  <p>"We must have another talk some day about these fancies of yours."</p>

  <p>"Why not this afternoon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see how beautiful it is just now? Couldn't you spare&mdash;say,
  one hour? Do you know what I was going to do? I was going to take a taxicab
  and drive about alone. Come with me." She looked at him thoughtfully for a
  moment. Her hesitation made him the more insistent.</p>

  <p>"Do come," he begged. "You know how nervous and broken-down I am. To have
  any one near as calm and self-centered as you are is like a sedative. Please
  come, just for one hour."</p>

  <p>"I will come," she agreed.</p>

  <p>He called a taxi and handed her in.</p>

  <p>"Is there anywhere you wish to go particularly?" he inquired eagerly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have no choice," she replied, "only we must not be longer than an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"To Putney," he told the driver. "I will direct you again."</p>

  <p>He took his place by her side. In this clear sunlight there were things to
  be noticed about him not easily apparent in the dimmer light of the
  restaurant. He was dressed in mourning, with a black tie, and a black band
  around his hat. There were lines upon his face and a strange restlessness in
  his deep-set eyes. Every now and then his lips twitched. He looked about him
  all the time with little abrupt movements of the head.</p>

  <p>"If I were you," she suggested, "I should see a doctor. Overwork should
  never make any one quite as nervous as you seem to be. It is so easy to cure
  oneself if one has the will."</p>

  <p>"It is not only overwork," he muttered. "Let us forget it for a few
  minutes. How wonderful to be so calm and collected as you are always! Do you
  never feel emotions, little lady?"</p>

  <p>She turned her head and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"My name," she said, "is Miss Robinson."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon!" he exclaimed quickly. "It shall be just as you say.
  Only, somehow or other, I have been feeling so lonely, and you are such a
  strange, quiet little person. You have such a gift of making one talk and of
  listening."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"If you will keep your part of the bargain," she promised, "I will stay
  with you; not otherwise."</p>

  <p>"I will keep it," he agreed.</p>

  <p>They were passing through St. James's Park, toward Buckingham Palace. Now
  that they had left the more crowded streets behind, he seemed a little more
  at his ease.</p>

  <p>"Let me advise you seriously," she begged, "to go and see a nerve
  specialist. There is a man in Harley Street&mdash;I could give you his
  address&mdash;to whom ever so many barristers go, and members of
  Parliament."</p>

  <p>He laughed curiously.</p>

  <p>"You think it is overwork only," he groaned. "I wish&mdash;oh, I only wish
  I dared tell you!"</p>

  <p>She looked steadily ahead. There was so little about him that she did not
  know&mdash;one thing only.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you?" she murmured."</p>

  <p>"You are so sensible," he muttered. "You would not go into hysterics."</p>

  <p>"I am certainly not given to that sort of thing," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"You are a woman, too," he went on&mdash;"very different from her, but
  still a woman. In a way you would understand. Promise not to jump out of the
  taxicab?"</p>

  <p>"I promise you that under no circumstances will I attempt anything of the
  sort," she replied.</p>

  <p>"My name is not Harold," he confessed, gripping the strap by his side and
  shaking as he spoke. "My name is Richard Harold Delamoir&mdash;Delamoir, you
  know!"</p>

  <p>She turned her head.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have heard the name lately," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Heard it!" he exclaimed. "Haven't you heard it at every street corner,
  seen it on every newspaper placard?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she assented. "You are the Richard Delamoir whose wife was
  found poisoned in your house at Putney."</p>

  <p>He looked at her, his lips parted, his eyes blinking rapidly.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind?" he cried. "You are not terrified?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," she assured him calmly. "Why should I be?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know the worst," he told her. "The police are watching me all
  the time. They think I did it. They think I murdered her. Everybody thinks
  so. The bus drivers, the tradespeople, the children in the street&mdash;they
  all stare at me curiously as I go by&mdash;the man who poisoned his wife! The
  women look at me from behind the curtains. The men hurry when they pass. It's
  worse than overwork, this, Miss Robinson."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "it is worse than overwork."</p>

  <p>"There isn't a soul," he continued, "except the doctor, whom I've dared to
  speak with about it. I haven't been near my club, I've had to leave my
  favorite restaurants alone&mdash;that's why I turned up at the Lugano, where
  I first saw you. I thought the doctor might have talked to me now and then.
  We used to be quite friendly once. I went to see him the other
  night&mdash;just dropped in to have a pipe, as I used to. He only said a few
  words, but it was the way he looked at me. I understood. I remembered his
  evidence at the inquest. Did you read about the inquest, Miss Robinson?"</p>

  <p>"I did," she confessed. "It rather interested me."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he groaned. "They say that after the doctor's evidence it was a toss
  up whether I was arrested or not. Do you know why I wasn't? Do you know why I
  am free now? They are waiting to get a little more evidence. They are afraid
  they might try me and I might get off, and then they'd find out too late.
  Evidence! I could give them all the evidence they wanted."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you?" she asked. He laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>"Why should I? Is it my business? Let us talk about something else. Miss
  Robinson. I want to get away from it for a little time. You know the worst
  now. I've nothing to hide from you. You know that I am Richard Delamoir."</p>

  <p>She watched him from her corner without flinching.</p>

  <p>"Is it true," she asked, "that you have inherited a large sum of money by
  your wife's death?"</p>

  <p>"Quite true," he answered; " quite true. Oh, I am rich! I hadn't much
  before I married her, but she left me everything. I thought of stealing out
  of the country, but they are so clever, these detectives. They'd think I was
  running away. I should feel a hand on my shoulder just as I was getting into
  the train. Ugh! If only there was some one to go with me! If only I could get
  away from this infernal solitude!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her eagerly. There was very little encouragement in her
  emotionless face.</p>

  <p>"Have you no friends or relatives at all?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No relatives&mdash;not one," he replied. "I was born in Australia. Most
  of my friends over here were my wife's friends, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice seemed to leave him for a moment. He tried to speak and
  failed.</p>

  <p>"They keep out of my way," he went on, after a moment's pause. "I don't
  know why. Can you think? They can't believe&mdash;not all of them. Let us
  talk about something else. Have you ever been a nurse, Miss Robinson?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," she answered. "Why do you ask that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, except that you are so restful and so strong," he declared.
  "You make me feel almost like a child. That's because my nerve is gone, of
  course. Are you very well off, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I am not at all well off," she told him. "I am a typist."</p>

  <p>"If I were to give you a large sum of money," he went on eagerly, "would
  you go abroad with me&mdash;just as my nurse," he explained hurriedly, "just
  to be with me and to keep me from being frightened always? You could have
  plenty of money, beautiful dresses. Dresses would make such a difference to
  you&mdash;dresses and hats. You are queer-looking, you know. You look
  old-fashioned and dowdy, and your face is so still and quiet that one forgets
  that you have really beautiful eyes. It would change you tremendously to be
  well-dressed."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were half closed with silent laughter. There was something about
  the laugh a little cruel.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of me!"</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;I?" she asked. "I afraid?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I mean that you are afraid I should want to make love to you. Do you
  know, sometimes I think that I shall never want to make love to another
  woman."</p>

  <p>"How old are you?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-nine," he replied. "I was twenty-six years old when I married
  Maggie. She hadn't her money then. She was just a chorus-girl."</p>

  <p>"Is it true that you used always to quarrel?"</p>

  <p>"We used to quarrel a good deal," he admitted. "I am afraid I was
  impatient and a little jealous. Maggie was always having flirtations. She was
  crazy for admiration." Constance sighed as she looked away. After all, there
  were all the commonplace elements of tragedy here.</p>

  <p>"You really wish to talk about something else?" she asked. "Come, I will
  try. You shall tell me about your life in Australia. I think you said that
  you were born there."</p>

  <p>"It isn't any use," he answered. "I want to talk about something else and
  I can't. It always comes back."</p>

  <p>"Then if you won't talk about anything . else," she said, "tell me what
  you meant when you said that you could give the police the evidence they
  needed." He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he muttered, "I couldn't trust anybody with that, not even you!" She
  was silent. He sat by her side, and his manner gradually became calmer.</p>

  <p>"It is odd," he went on, half to himself, "how much I have told you,
  really; you&mdash;just a little stranger whom I spoke to in a restaurant. Why
  did you let me speak to you?"</p>

  <p>"You looked lonely," she answered. "I am never afraid to speak to any one.
  I can take care of myself."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "I should say that that was true. You can very well
  take care of yourself. Would nothing terrify you, Miss Robinson? Would
  nothing shake your nerves?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have no opportunity of judging. My life is a very uneventful one."</p>

  <p>"Try them this afternoon," he begged eagerly. "You see where we are? We
  are close to Putney. The third turn to the left, then another turn, and the
  fourth house is where I live. Not a soul has crossed the threshold since that
  day. Come in with me. Sit with me for a little time. Perhaps it will help.
  Perhaps after that I shall not be so terrified. If only I can feel another
  human being breathing the same air in that sitting-room where We used to be!
  Will you come?"</p>

  <p>She did not hesitate. She had no fear. She felt easily his master.</p>

  <p>"If it is any satisfaction to you," she assented, "I will come."</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed. He gave a direction to the driver, who looked at him
  curiously. In a few moments they turned off the main street. In less than
  five minutes the taxicab was pulled up outside one of a little row of villas.
  As they stepped out Constance was half conscious of people peering from
  behind the windows. Some women opposite, who had been pointing out the place
  to a stranger, stared open-mouthed. Constance followed her companion
  composedly into the house, the door of which he opened with a latch-key. He
  closed it behind them.</p>

  <p>"Why have you sent away the taxicab?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You won't hurry?" he pleaded. "Why should I keep it there? People always
  gather round if they think I am here. They stare so. Come!"</p>

  <p>He opened the door of a little drawing room, a queer apartment, half
  Oriental, with a tented divan in one corner and a curious smell of incense.
  The wall-paper was of bright yellow and the curtains black. There were
  withered flowers in the vases and cigarette-ash upon the carpet. The
  atmosphere was almost unbearable.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind opening a window?" Constance begged. "I couldn't possibly sit
  here like this."</p>

  <p>He nodded and threw up one of the side windows.</p>

  <p>"I have only just put my head in here since," he explained hoarsely. "I
  couldn't bear it. This is where we used to sit. Maggie had such queer taste.
  I don't think," he went on, "that she had really a healthy nature. She liked
  everything exotic and unnatural. Poor woman! You see the black curtains and
  the black carpet. She thought they went with the bright yellow walls and that
  they helped her complexion.</p>

  <p>"She was older than I am, you know, and she used to fancy sometimes that
  she was losing her looks. Yes, I can breathe now there is some one in the
  room with me! Sit just where you are, please. Miss Robinson. She used to sit
  over in that corner, and often she would lie down on the divan there.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't bear all the stuffy hangings, but she loved them. Now shall we
  talk about something? Shall I show you some views? There's an album there of
  my wife's notices. Or shall we talk about&mdash;Australia?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You know very well, Mr. Delamoir," she said, "that, however hard you were
  to try, you couldn't talk&mdash;about anything except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course you are right," he interrupted. "It isn't any use. I can no
  more talk about anything else than I can think about anything else. If you
  want to see her picture, there it is on the corner of the mantelpiece. I
  can't look&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;I can't!"</p>

  <p>He had turned his back upon her. Constance moved to the mantelpiece and
  took up the picture. It gave her at first almost a shock. It was the picture
  of a woman, haggard, painted, with darkened eyebrows, false hair, in a ball
  dress cut absurdly low, and a satin skirt absurdly tight. She remembered the
  words Inspector Simmons had used in speaking to her of the case:</p>

  <p>"A woman any man would be glad to be rid of!"</p>

  <p>Her companion drew the curtain a little.</p>

  <p>"There are some boys outside!" he exclaimed irritably. "And those women?
  their eyes seem never off the place. Do you mind the blind being down?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. There was still a long shaft of sunlight piercing the
  gloom of the room. Presently he came and sat opposite to her.</p>

  <p>"If there were any way," he said, "of ending this?"</p>

  <p>"What way could there be?" she interrupted. "You must travel soon and try
  to forget."</p>

  <p>"Forget!" he repeated. "Would you forget, I wonder? Could you carry about
  with you the horrible knowledge I have locked in my heart, and forget? No one
  could."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, why not tell the truth and have it over?" she asked
  calmly.</p>

  <p>He sprang from his seat. She sat quite still, unflinching. His passion,
  however, was not one of anger.</p>

  <p>"If only I could!" he moaned. "If only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are, Miss Robinson," he implored. "Stay just where you
  are. Don't move. I shall be back in a moment."</p>

  <p>He left the room. She heard him climb the stairs and remained where she
  was, looking about her. It seemed to her that in all the adventures of her
  life she had never found herself in such an atmosphere. She looked at the
  picture of the woman, worthy presiding genius of such an apartment. And yet
  there was something in the eyes&mdash;was it terror or
  despair&mdash;something piteous shining out from the midst of the wreck; just
  in the same way that, on a table only a few feet away, a little marble
  statuette of exquisite design struck a strange note in the midst of the
  flamboyant furniture and vulgar gewgaws with which the place was
  littered.</p>

  <p>She heard his footsteps descending the stairs. He entered the room. There
  was a new look in his face, white and strained. He carried in his hand a
  little volume, bound in violent purple arid tied up with ribbon. He held it
  out to her.</p>

  <p>"The evidence," he muttered&mdash;"I spoke of the evidence! Only a page or
  two, mind. You can read; then you will understand. You will be the only
  person in the world except myself who understands. Don't begin at the
  beginning&mdash;that's all rubbish. Begin there&mdash;there!"</p>

  <p>His forefinger showed her the place. She began to read. The entries were
  sprawled all about the book in a loose, untidy handwriting, and without
  regard to keeping within the limits of the dates.</p>

  <p class="journal">Began to-day worse than ever. I got up at twelve and
  passed the looking-glass on my way to the bath. I almost shrieked. I can't be
  like it! I had forgotten my hair! I dressed very quickly. Such beautiful
  things I put on. Then for a long time I could not make up my mind. I put on
  my lilac dress and my ermine, with a new hat that came last night, and a
  thick veil. I spent quite an hour with madame in her parlor. Then I walked
  slowly away down Bond Street. At first no one looked at me at all. Then a man
  and a woman passed and I heard the man laugh!</p>

  <p class="journal">I looked in at a shop-window&mdash;perhaps my front was a
  little crooked. I went down to the theater. I thought to-day, perhaps, there
  might be a chance. Madame had taken a lot of pains. The stage-doorkeeper
  smiled when he told me that Bunsome was out. Liar! Bunsome came down the
  passage just a minute later. I told him what I wanted. He looked at me in a
  queer sort of way.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Can't see whom I'm talking to," he muttered.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Take off your veil." I took it off. Perhaps my fingers
  trembled, perhaps I took it off clumsily. He turned away. I could have sworn
  that he was laughing!</p>

  <p class="journal">"My good woman," he said, "we want girls!"</p>

  <p class="journal">. . . . I got out somehow, crossed the road. I went into a
  public house. I had two glasses of port&mdash;filthy stuff, but they won't
  sell me drugs in quantities big enough. Never mind, when I got home I
  forgot!</p>

  <p>Constance looked up. He was still standing over her.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he ordered. "Turn to the next page. Turn quickly."</p>

  <p>She obeyed him.</p>

  <p class="journal">Last night I cried myself to sleep. It doesn't matter
  crying in the night-time. I was in the West End all day, and I wore my new
  tailor made gown, the patent shoes with the gray suede tops, and gray
  stockings. I met Peter face to face. It doesn't seem long ago since he used
  to beg me to go out to luncheon with him. He hurried on. I tried to stop him,
  but he muttered something about an appointment, looked at me as though there
  were something wrong about my appearance, and kept glancing around nervously,
  as though he were afraid that some one would see us.</p>

  <p class="journal">I went in to madame's and looked at myself in a glass.
  Glasses are such liars. I know I don't look like that. Every woman has to use
  a little rouge and a little false hair nowadays to keep in the fashion. I
  hate looking-glasses! . . . I lunched at Prince's; got rid of Dick. No one
  ever takes any notice of a woman if she's with a man younger than herself. I
  am going to write the truth. I can't bear it! I don't think I will ever lunch
  there alone again. The men glanced at me as they came in, and then looked
  away. There wasn't one who had that expression in his face I used to see
  always when I lunched alone and men passed. It frightened me.</p>

  <p class="journal">I couldn't eat anything. I went into the ladies' room
  afterward and I ventured to look in the glass. It was madame's fault. She had
  put too much rouge on my left cheek. Yes, it must have been madame's fault! I
  shall try again.</p>

  <p>Constance put the book away from her. Her voice was not altogether
  steady.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to read any more," she said.</p>

  <p>"One more page," he insisted. "One more, please. You are beginning to
  understand. One human person in this world understands besides myself! I
  think that I shall go about with a lighter heart."</p>

  <p>She turned the page.</p>

  <p class="journal">To-day I feel will be different. Laroche has sent me home
  the most wonderful white velveteen gown. I have rested until twelve o'clock.
  Now I have just put it on. It fits me divinely. One would say that I had the
  figure of a girl. It is marvelous. I have put on my big black hat with the
  feathers and a thinner veil. Yes, I am going to risk a thinner veil!</p>

  <p class="journal">I shall go to madame for an hour, and then I will take all
  my courage in my hands. I will go once more to Prince's. I know that Stephen
  will be there. I will stop him as he passes my table, and I will watch him. I
  shall see. He used to love me in white. Somehow or other I feel younger
  myself to-day. As to being old, it is absurd. I am not old.</p>

  <p class="journal">I have sent Susan for a taxi, and I have made Richard go
  away for the day. He bothers me so, wanting to go about with me. What
  admiration can a woman have who has a young husband with her! He doesn't seem
  to understand.</p>

  <p class="journal">. . . .I don't know why I feel so excited to-day. I think
  it is the white velveteen gown. I shall put on my white silk stockings. It is
  a little daring, perhaps, but Stephen loves white. . . . Now I am going. I
  don't think, after all, I shall ever need to use that little packet.</p>

  <p>The writing sprawled down to the end of the page. Constance looked up.
  Delamoir's eyes were upon her.</p>

  <p>"Turn over," he ordered.</p>

  <p>She obeyed.</p>

  <p class="journal">I can scarcely hold my pen. My God! I have seen the truth!
  It is the end! Madame called in little Emilie to look at me before I left.
  "Madame," she declared, "is <i>ravissante</i>!" I paid her and went out. Just
  as I reached the door I fancied I heard a laugh. At the time I thought that
  it must be fancy. Now I am not so sure! I went to Prince's, I got my table
  just inside. I waited. Every one who passed seemed to be in such a hurry.</p>

  <p class="journal">Bunsome came in, and Elliman, and Captain Jenks, but they
  none of them appeared to see me. And then Stephen! He saw me, and he was
  alone, but he was going to pass. I held out my hand and I smiled at him.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Stephen," I said, "won't you stop and speak to me?" He
  seemed quite awkward about it, but he stopped. I looked at the place by my
  side.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Are you alone?" I asked very softly. He muttered
  something about having to join a party. I looked at him intently; he used to
  say that he liked me to look at him like that.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Why are you in such a hurry?" I asked him. "Can't you
  stay for a little time and talk?" He shook his head. Then I felt suddenly
  queer and giddy. Something came into my heart and I held him when he wanted
  to get away. I said,</p>

  <p class="journal">"Stephen, tell me the truth. Why do you avoid me? Why do
  those others hurry by? You men used to crowd around me, not so very many
  years ago. Why is it?"</p>

  <p class="journal">He hesitated for a moment. Then he looked me straight in
  the face.</p>

  <p class="journal">"Since you've asked me that question, Maggie," he said,
  "I'll tell you, as much for your husband's sake as your own. It's because you
  are close upon sixty years of age and you dress up to make yourself look like
  a girl and sit about and expect men to behave as though you were still
  attractive. And you're not. You're an old woman, and you know you are. Leave
  off painting yourself and wearing clothes thirty years too young for you and
  we'd all be glad to see you now and then and talk to you. But no man likes to
  be seen talking to a guy. . . . I don't mean to be unkind," he went on, for I
  suppose I was looking at him in a queer sort of way. "I've just told you this
  from myself and the others, for Richard's sake as well as your own. Now be a
  sensible woman and give it up."</p>

  <p class="journal">I think that he went away then. I am not quite sure what
  happened to me. I found myself in a taxicab, and here I am&mdash;here I am!
  Fortunately, I didn't have to buy anything. I've had the stuff with me for
  years. I am leaving this in case there should be any trouble. Whoever reads
  this, if it shouldn't be Richard, please tell him there's a letter for the
  coroner on the next page. . . . I don't know what it's going to be like on my
  next page, but it won't be worse than to-day. I'm going to&mdash;turn
  over!</p>

  <p>He took the book from her fingers. Constance suddenly felt cold.</p>

  <p>"I loved her!" he muttered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand that I shall have to hang before I could show that
  book?"</p>

  <p>She gave him both her hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I think I understand."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">CONSTANCE walked into her rooms at a few minutes after six.
  Brooke and Inspector Simmons were on the point of leaving. She looked at them
  in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what you are doing in my apartments?" she inquired, beginning
  to take off her gloves.</p>

  <p>"You forget that you had an appointment with me here at three o'clock,"
  Simmons remarked.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Constance admitted. "I had forgotten it."</p>

  <p>"And as we had information," Brooke continued, "that at five minutes to
  two this afternoon you left the Caf&eacute; Lugano with a certain notorious person
  called Delamoir, you may understand that we were becoming a little
  uneasy."</p>

  <p>She sank into her easy chair. The two men looked at her. Every muscle in
  Brooke's body seemed to stiffen. "Something has happened!" he exclaimed. She
  drew a little brown-paper parcel from her pocket.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Simmons," she said, "I started out this afternoon to try to trap a
  man into a confession of his guilt. I have instead succeeded in becoming
  acquainted with his innocence. The proofs are here."</p>

  <p>Simmons moved swiftly forward, but Constance retained possession of the
  parcel.</p>

  <p>"This," she went on quietly, "is his wife's diary. It is my belief that
  Delamoir would have gone to the gallows sooner than have given it up. I have
  talked to him for some time, and he has let me have it for two hours, on one
  condition.</p>

  <p>"You are to read it, and the superintendent. Beyond that, no other person.
  Not a word of it is to be breathed to the press. Sooner than have had a
  single line appear in any newspaper, Delamoir would have hung.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt," she continued, "about its being his wife's diary. You
  will find inside some of her letters, in her own handwriting, and there is
  also one addressed to the coroner, which is in itself conclusive.</p>

  <p>"If, however, you have any remaining doubts as to the genuineness of this
  diary, you have only to go down to the Hilarity Theater and interview some of
  the young women who are mentioned in the earlier pages. Remember, however,
  that I part with the book only on the terms I have mentioned."</p>

  <p>Simmons accepted the parcel and his charge.</p>

  <p>"Queer," he remarked. "I know quite a lot of people who never believed in
  Delamoir's guilt; who even declared that he had an odd sort of affection for
  his wife, weird creature though she was."</p>

  <p>Constance's eyes suddenly shone. For a single moment she was
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"There are many strange ways," she said, "in which a man may love a
  woman."</p>

  <p>The inspector took his leave. Brooke turned to her earnestly, her last
  words sounding in his ears.</p>

  <p>"But his task is," said he, "to make the woman believe and
  understand."</p>

  <p>Constance felt her cheeks burn. Her eyes would no longer stand to their
  posts, arrogant sentinels, cool defenders against love's assaults. They
  turned, cowardly, in that moment, and took refuge behind their fringed
  curtains, while she answered, softly, very, very softly indeed:</p>

  <p>"But I have known, Stanley, dear boy, all along. I have known&mdash;and
  understood."</p>

  <p>"And the other partnership that I have proposed before to-day," said he,
  eagerly as a thirsty man, "the closer partnership, Constance?"</p>

  <p>"I think," she answered slyly, "that we may have the papers drawn."</p>
