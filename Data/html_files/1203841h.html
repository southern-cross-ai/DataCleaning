<h3>WHAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT</h3>

<p class="first">IN a lonely house upon an unfrequented part of
the Norfolk coast a retired Cambridge professor is living by
himself. Gradually he becomes aware that his house, which is
built upon the site of an age-old ruined church, is being
watched. In his perplexity he appeals to Gilbert Larose. The
mystery and dreadful happenings of all that follows after form
another exciting chapter in the life-story of the one-time great
international detective.</p>

<p>Here, Arthur Gask has again written one of those outstanding
mystery stories which have secured for him his enviable
reputation.</p>

<h2><a if="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE ADVENTURESS.</h2>

<p class="first">"MR. LAROSE, I am being watched," said the
small, scholarly-looking man with the high forehead. "I live
alone in a lonely house on a lonely shore, and I do not know
what it means. I am concerned about what is going to happen
next."</p>
<br>

<hr>

<p><br> AGATHA WANDSWORTH never learnt who her parents were,
which, under the circumstances, might perhaps have been
considered a good thing, as her father had been a dissolute
Norwegian sailor and her mother a disreputable and decidedly
coarse young woman who had many times strayed from the paths of
virtue and part of whose calling was that of an artist's
model.</p>

<p>Agatha owed her surname to having been found by a patrolling
policeman, one night when only a few-days-old baby, upon a seat
on Wandsworth Common. Her Christian name had been given her
because the date of her entry upon the books of the institution
to which she had been taken was that of the fifth of February,
the day of the Feast of the Virgin Martyr, St. Agatha.</p>

<p>From such lowly and unhappy beginnings of Agatha's recorded
life it might have been thought she would show all signs of
coming from some common stock. On the contrary, even from her
very early childhood days she had all outward appearance of
descent from aristocratic forebears. It might have been some far
hark-back to the Viking ancestors of her father, or, again, to
those of her mother, when in long bygone days they might perhaps
have been people of distinction and refinement.</p>

<p>At any rate, however it had come about, Agatha grew up to be
a very pretty girl, and through the several orphanages and homes
which she passed her good looks were remarked upon by everyone
who was brought in contact with her. She had shining golden
hair, finely chiselled features, beautiful deep-blue eyes and a
perfect complexion. She carried herself well and with perfect
poise. She spoke nicely, too, and not a bit like any common
girl.</p>

<p>If, however, she had this altogether attractive appearance,
in disposition and temperament she was anything but as pleasing,
and during all her institution years was a continual source of
trouble to those in charge of her. It was not that she was
bad-tempered, indeed she never got in tempers, but she was most
untrustworthy in almost every way. She was untruthful, she
cheated at her lessons, and she pilfered when there was anything
she wanted and she got the chance to take it on the sly. When
she was found out, which did not always happen, as she was sharp
and full of resource, she would express herself as being most
contrite and take her punishment with no complaints and without
the slightest trace of sullenness. She was never rude to
anyone.</p>

<p>One day after she had been brought up before the managing
committee of the orphanage for stealing a private pot of
strawberry jam belonging to one of the officers, the chairman
spoke to the matron about her later.</p>

<p>"But I cannot believe," he said with a frown, "that she is so
bad a girl as you all appear to think she is. She made a good
impression on us as being so nicely-mannered and respectful. She
seemed so sorry, too, for what she'd done."</p>

<p>"She always makes out she is sorry," retorted the matron
sharply, "but it's all put on, and the next time she'll be as
bad as ever again. She's a perfect little actress and you've got
to live with her to find out what she really is. Of course she's
very nice to speak to, but underneath she's as hard as flint and
doesn't care what she does. She's the most cunning child I've
ever had to do with."</p>

<p>The chairman appeared to be unconvinced. "Well, let us hope
she'll get better as she gets older," he smiled. "At fourteen
there's plenty of time for improvement. She's just at an awkward
age, and you see if she doesn't get better as time goes on."</p>

<p>And certainly in the two years which followed it did seem
that Agatha had improved a lot. She was not nearly so often
called up for punishment and the matron was able to give the
committee a much better report. In reality, however, Agatha had
not changed at all. It was only that she had learnt to cover her
tracks more and to keep from untruthfulness when it was likely
she would be found out. Underneath she was just the same, hard
as flint, as the matron had said, totally unscrupulous and
selfish, and uncaring for any interests but her own.</p>

<p>It could not, however, have been said that her influence in
the orphanage was a bad one. She never tried to influence her
companions in any way. She was not interested enough in them for
that and did not care what they did. She made no particular
friends among them, gave no confidences and kept herself as much
to herself as she could. Still, if she wanted anything from any
other girl, she would make herself very nice to her, but when
she had got what she wanted would straightway ignore her as if
she were no longer aware of her existence. No such word as
gratitude was in Agatha's vocabulary.</p>

<p>"We're always told that the face is an index to character,"
remarked one of the teachers to a colleague one day, "but it
certainly isn't so with that Agatha Wandsworth. I was looking at
her this morning and thought what a really nice girl she should
be. She looked so sweet and gentle and no one would dream she
was the cold and selfish little fish she is. She's cruel, too,
and just loved drowning those kittens yesterday." She nodded. "I
shall be very sorry for the man she marries."</p>

<p>The other laughed. "So shall I, but you see&mdash;in a year
or two, wherever she goes, the boys will be all running after
her."</p>

<p>"But she won't marry for love," went on the first teacher,
"for I'm certain she'll never love anyone but herself. She's
made that way, a selfish little beast."</p>

<p>"She would be quite clever, too, if she weren't so lazy,"
remarked her friend, "but I don't think anything will ever make
her work."</p>

<p>When Agatha was sixteen, after the usual custom of the
orphanage, she was put out to service, a place being found for
her as general help with two old maiden ladies in Balham. It was
not a big house, the old ladies were interested in her, and she
soon saw it was going to be a comfortable situation. She was to
receive &pound;12 a year and, as her employers were particular about
appearances, be provided with a natty uniform and caps. Agatha
knew the cap and dress suited her and was quite pleased to wear
them.</p>

<p>Up to then, during all her life she had spoken to no members
of the opposite sex except clergymen, the doctors of the
orphanages and the men on the committees of the boards of
management. So, her first sex adventure came to her with a boy
who delivered the bread, and his eyes boggled when she came to
the back door. Gee, here was something good, he thought
instantly. The prettiest girl he had seen, and he set about
making a conquest at once.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss," he exclaimed, lifting his cap with a
smirk. "So you're the new girl here, are you?"</p>

<p>"One white and one brown, please," snapped Agatha, looking at
him and through him with a cold, hard stare.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Miss," said the boy. He beamed all over. "And I'm
very pleased to meet you," but Agatha had returned into the
house and shut the door and the conversation was ended.</p>

<p>The deliverer of bread and buns realised he had been badly
snubbed, but, a decidedly good-looking young fellow and with the
confidence begot of many conquests, he returned blithely to the
attack the next day, with the offer of a chocolate from a
gaudily-covered box which he produced from his pocket. Agatha,
however, refused with a curt shake of her head, barely
condescending to acknowledge his good morning as she turned
away.</p>

<p>The following week, feeling sure the ripening of their
acquaintance was only a matter of an attractive enough little
present, one morning he held out to her a whole box of
chocolates. "From our own shop, Miss," he explained proudly. "My
dad's a confectioner as well as a baker and we have more
customers than anyone else in Balham."</p>

<p>Agatha hesitated a moment&mdash;she had a fondness for
chocolates&mdash;and then, with a half smile and a quick nod of
thanks, accepted the gift. She did not, however, encourage any
prolonging of the conversation.</p>

<p>The boy was disappointed, but consoled himself with the
thought that at least he was making headway, and he had dreams
of very soon taking her to the pictures, with exciting little
adventures to follow after among the trees on the common. With
this end in view, he subsequently presented her with some
nougat, a packet of butter-scotch and quite a big bag of
liquorice all-sorts. Emboldened by her acceptance of his gifts,
though his conversations with her were still in a most
fragmentary stage, one morning he ventured to stroke her bare
arm as she was taking from him a loaf of brown bread.</p>

<p>The result surprised him. Without a moment's hesitation, she
jerked up the arm he had stroked and gave him a slap on the
face, a slap so hard that, with all his amorous longings, it
stung him to anger and bad words.</p>

<p>"You damned little cat!" he swore, rubbing his bruised cheek.
"You gobble up everything I bring and that's your gratitude, is
it? Damn you!"</p>

<p>"Don't you ever touch me again," said Agatha calmly. "I don't
like it"&mdash;she was cold and business-like&mdash;"and
Mistress says bring a milk loaf to-morrow."</p>

<p>After that the boy made no more advances, getting, however,
as he thought, something of a revenge by always addressing her
familiarly as Aggy when he called with the bread. He had learnt
her name was Agatha because he had once overheard one of her
mistresses speaking to her. At heart he was a very chagrined
boy, being quite at a loss to understand why he had not managed,
as he called it, to click with her. Hitherto, he had always
found servant girls good hunting and it was the first real set-back
he had received in all his Don Juan career. It hurt his
vanity and he was wondering if anything was going wrong with him
and he was losing his punch.</p>

<p>He need not really, however, have lost any sleep over the
matter, for had he only known it Agatha was the same with all of
the opposite sex she was brought in contact. Physically she was
as cold as an icicle and, as she grew older, came to realise no
man or boy could ever stir the very slightest emotion in her.
Handsome or plain, it was always the same. She was just not
interested in them.</p>

<p>She got on well with her mistresses, the Misses Selina and
Emma Brown, playing her cards beautifully and ingratiating
herself with them until they had come to have the most perfect
confidence in her. She played her part splendidly and, so demure
and respectful when in their presence, they never dreamt what
her private opinion of them was. She thought them old fools and
often would have liked to shake them for their cranky ideas. In
time, too, it began to gall her that she had always to be at
their beck and call and often had to leave off the reading of
some interesting book to attend to them.</p>

<p>As she had surmised when she had first arrived, the place was
an easy one, and, the old ladies helping both with the cooking
and the housework, she had plenty of leisure and was soon taking
an absorbed delight in the really splendid collection of books
that was in the house.</p>

<p>The old ladies' brother had been a retired Indian Civil
Service official and, dying and bequeathing his library to them,
for sentimental reasons they had not disposed of a single
volume, though some of them were quite valuable. There were many
hundreds of them and they filled an entire room almost from
floor to ceiling. They comprised books on all sorts of subjects,
including a large number of novels and romances, with most of
the famous classical ones. Also, there were books, the contents
of which would have made the old ladies' hair stand on end had
they only been aware of what they were.</p>

<p>Agatha was allowed to take any book she chose, and, with the
happenings of her life hitherto bounded by the dreary orphanage
and charitable institution walls, it can be imagined the
enchanted new world which now opened wide its gates before her.
She found delight in the books of travel and, her imagination
quickened by what she read, her feet wandered wondrously both
through the populous streets of mighty far-off cities and the
silent lonely lands in obscure corners of the earth.</p>

<p>She liked history and biographies, too, and to read about
people who had risen to high positions from humble and lowly
beginnings. She started then upon her first day-dreams and
imagined herself as becoming famous, perhaps as a great actress
or film star. While she liked romance and the beautiful settings
which were nearly always given them, she could not understand
charming maidens being so swept off their feet by the attentions
of young men. She did not see much in it.</p>

<p>But of all the books of fiction, she was most enamoured with
detective stories. There, the more abandoned the criminal and
the more heartless his exploits, the more thrilled with him she
was, and she felt very sorry when he was caught. Two large
volumes, <i>Famous Trials of the Century,</i> she found
particularly enthralling, but when the accused were found guilty
she always thought they had been badly served.</p>

<p>By the time she had been with the old ladies a year they had
such trust in her that she was given all the shopping to do.
That suited her well, as thereby she was able to add quite a lot
to her wages. A shilling here, a sixpence there added on to what
she had actually paid came in very useful. She was developing
into early womanhood, as she had been in her girlhood, without
any conscience at all.</p>

<p>Naturally clever with her needle and showing good taste with
everything she bought, with her wages raised to &pound;16 and her
income so augmented by her shopping expeditions, she was able to
dress quite well and, in her out-door clothes, she had a most
presentable appearance.</p>

<p>"Might come from the best of people!" nodded Miss Emma Brown
once, watching through the window her start off upon one of her
afternoon walks. "She looks a perfect little lady."</p>

<p>As time passed on, if Agatha's real introduction into a wider
life had started with the catholic course of reading she was
giving herself, it was undoubtedly helped on materially in an
awakened interest in everything which was put upon the screen.
She became an enthusiastic patron of picture theatres, and there
again crime themes were what she liked best. A gangster picture
with plenty of rough action and much firing of pistols delighted
her. She was often so enthralled that she stayed out much later
than she was allowed, to receive mild reproofs from her
employers upon reaching home. If, however, it had been a night
screening, it did not so much matter, as the old ladies were
always early to bed, and generally asleep when she crept in. The
next morning she would tell them she had been in quite a couple
of hours before she really had. They were unsuspicious people
and did not think her capable of deceiving them.</p>

<p>Upon her excursions, seeing her alone, men often tried to
scrape up an acquaintance with her, but it never led them
anywhere. If she felt inclined that way she would let them take
her out somewhere to tea or dinner, but there it always ended
and she never told them who she was or where she lived. Once,
one of them, very determined to find out where she came from
insisted upon walking home with her. She made no protest, but
just ignored him until they met a patrolling policeman. Then she
stopped and said with no emotion, "Constable, this man is
annoying me. Send him away." She had seen such a happening once
upon the screen and the request then had been just as effective
as it turned out to be now. Most humiliated and scarlet with
indignation, her cavalier, at the stern injunction of the
policeman, had instantly slunk away.</p>

<p>When she was nineteen and had been three years with the old
ladies, one of them, Miss Selina, the elder, died. Agatha was
very glad, as Miss Selina was the more sensible of the two and
several times lately, at any rate so Agatha thought, had
scrutinised very hard the change which had been returned to her
after a shopping expedition.</p>

<p>Only one relative, a middle-aged nephew from Birmingham, had
come down to the funeral. He had been greatly taken with Agatha
and returned home to his wife with a growing report of in what
safe hands Aunt Emma was.</p>

<p>After that Agatha's life became freer than ever. She was soon
completely dominating Miss Emma and doing exactly what she
pleased. She went out to pictures much more often and came in
only when the fancy took her, quite regardless of the comfort of
the old lady. Sometimes, she would give her lunch and then
coolly take herself off to the West End to look at the shops and
afterwards stay to an evening screening, not returning home
until late at night.</p>

<p>Miss Emma Brown, of a most gentle disposition, was now more
or less an invalid, suffering greatly from rheumatism. Often she
had to remain in bed for days at a time. Once, upon one of her
bad days when she could not get up, Agatha had left her after an
early lunch and not appeared before her again until the next
morning. All the old lady had had to eat or drink after one
o'clock had been some biscuits which had been upon the table by
her bedside and a glass of water. She had not been feeling well
enough to get up and make herself even a cup of tea. She had
remonstrated timidly to Agatha.</p>

<p>"I didn't have enough to eat," she said plaintively, "and it
makes me feel very weak this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mum, but you had a good tea," said Agatha reproachfully.
"You ate all that buttered toast and those two pieces of cake I
brought you."</p>

<p>"But I didn't have any toast or cake," said Miss Emma with
tears in her eyes. "I haven't seen anything of you since after
lunch yesterday until just now."</p>

<p>"Oh, you forgot, Mum," said Agatha gently. "Why, you had a
glass of hot milk, too, just before I said good night," and the
old lady was so bewildered by Agatha's confident statement that
she began to think her memory was going.</p>

<p>Still, her Birmingham nephew, happening to be up in town on
business for a few hours the next day, and calling in to see
her, she repeated her complaint to him. He was very astonished
and at once went into the kitchen to speak to Agatha about it.
Agatha smiled sadly. "Poor Miss Emma," she said, "she forgets.
Her memory is failing a lot." She raised her innocent eyes to
his. "I never left the house yesterday, Mr. Benson, and she had
plenty to eat. I was in and out her room all day."</p>

<p>Of course the nephew believed her and told his wife that
night that the old lady was failing fast.</p>

<p>About a month after his visit, soon after one o'clock one
afternoon, Agatha took herself off to a picture theatre in
Leicester Square where an absorbing thriller, <i>The Black
Gang,</i> was to be screened for the first time in London. She
left Miss Emma in bed and promised to be back in half an hour.
She said she was only going out to change a book at a library
close by. The picture came quite up to her expectations, indeed
she enjoyed it so much that she resolved to remain in town for
tea and see it again at the evening session.</p>

<p>"Bother old Emma!" she said irritably. "Sleep will be better
for her than a feed. At any rate she's got her biscuits and I'll
chance it."</p>

<p>So it was nearly midnight when she got back home and, letting
herself in with her key, tiptoed softly upstairs. Miss Emma's
door was as she had left it, propped ajar with a chair. The
night had turned cold and a chilling wind was blowing in from
the open window. She thought she had better go in and shut it
and pull down the blind, too. The moon was up and she peeped
cautiously round the door. Then, to her amazement, she saw the
old lady was lying all huddled up upon the floor just by the
bed.</p>

<p>"Miss Emma," she called out quickly, "Miss Emma, what's
happened to you? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>She received no answer and, now thoroughly frightened, darted
into the room and made to lift her employer back on to the bed.
She desisted, however, immediately, for the moment she touched
her she knew she was dead. The arms were as stiff as a
board.</p>

<p>The clock in the hall chimed midnight. Agatha's heart beat
painfully and she could hardly get her breath. Her first thought
was to rush to the telephone and call up the doctor. Then she
remembered, but only just in time and when upon the point of
lifting the receiver, that if the doctor came then he would see
the old lady had been dead many hours, and how would she,
Agatha, be able to account for not having summoned him
before?</p>

<p>From the reading of so many detective stories, she knew about
rigor mortis and that the body did not begin to stiffen until
after about eight hours. It was now midnight, and so her
mistress must have died before four o'clock. Then how could she
explain she had not been aware of it? There was no explanation
she could give and everyone would learn she had left Miss Emma
alone for all that long time.</p>

<p>She calmed down quickly and collected her thoughts. No, she
would not ring up the doctor until the morning! Then it would be
thought the old lady had died during the night and the stiffness
of her body be expected as the natural thing!</p>

<p>She smiled rather nervously. Here was an adventure as
thrilling as if it had come out of a book! She was alone in the
house with a dead body and she was going to remain alone in it
all night, until everything fitted in with the story she was
going to tell! Like the crime heroes on the pictures, she had
got the situation well in hand!</p>

<p>Her shock over, with no repugnance at the nearness of the
body, she went methodically through the dead woman's things with
a thoroughness she never had had the opportunity to do before.
She found nothing much, however, to interest her except three
pound notes in a drawer, two of which she annexed for
herself.</p>

<p>Then she put herself to bed and had five hours of good sleep.
Soon after six she got up, dressed herself nattily as she always
did, made two cups of tea, one of which she drank herself,
taking the other up to the dead woman's room. She was preparing
everything so that her story should ring true.</p>

<p>At ten minutes to seven she rang up the doctor and, living
close by, he was round in a few minutes. He was a dour, elderly
Scotsman, with no interest in the other sex except as sick
people, and so Agatha's prettiness was quite wasted on him. He
proceeded to examine the body methodically while Agatha, rubbing
her eyes vigorously, panted out her story in quick jerky
breaths. Her mistress had seemed quite all right the previous
night, and then, when she had brought her in the usual cup of
morning tea, she had found her like this! Sob, sob, she was such
a kind mistress and so good to everyone! She&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The doctor looked up and interrupted her sharply. "When did
you last see her alive?" he asked with a frown.</p>

<p>"About nine last night," replied Agatha quaveringly, "when I
brought in her glass of hot milk and some toast for her
supper."</p>

<p>He looked at her hard for a long moment. "Tell me everything
she had to eat yesterday," he said.</p>

<p>Agatha nodded tearfully. "Just plain things, nothing to hurt
her. Toast and marmalade for her breakfast, a little cold lamb
and mashed potato with some lettuce for her dinner, scrambled
eggs for her tea and then toast and milk for supper."</p>

<p>He continued to stare hard at her. "What time did she have
her tea?"</p>

<p>"Six o'clock," replied Agatha, "at the same time she always
did."</p>

<p>The doctor picked up his hat. "There'll have to be an
inquest," he said-curtly, "and you'll have to be there." He
prepared to leave the room. "Now what's the telephone number of
her nephew in Birmingham?"</p>

<p>Agatha had a great thrill when the police came to take away
the body for the post-mortem which was to be made that
afternoon. She was not so thrilled, however, when the nephew
arrived that evening with his wife, for she thought the latter
gave her a cold and disapproving look. The nephew did not seem
too nice to her, either. They said very little to her and asked
no questions. She partly understood that, as she learnt they had
been to see the doctor upon their way from the railway station.
They went out in the evening and she saw nothing more of them
until breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>They hurried over the meal, as the inquest was being held at
nine o'clock. Everyone was punctual except the doctor, and, when
some minutes had gone without his appearing, to save time,
Agatha's evidence was taken first. She was wearing her best
costume and looked very nice and as well-dressed as any woman
there. There was nothing of the servant-girl about her and,
though there were quite a number of people in the court, she
showed no trace of nervousness. She spoke quietly and with
perfect confidence.</p>

<p>She related everything exactly as she had told the doctor,
how she had left Miss Emma Brown, seemingly as well as usual,
the previous night a few minutes after nine o'clock, and how she
had found her dead the next morning when she took in the early
cup of tea at a quarter to seven. Then, in reply to the
questions of the superintendent of police, she told everything
which had happened the previous day, including what her mistress
had had to eat.</p>

<p>She had nearly finished her statement when the doctor arrived
and, in order that he might get back to his patients, her
evidence was interrupted to take his.</p>

<p>The doctor said his patient had died from heart failure,
probably following upon the shock of her slipping and falling on
to the floor. She showed no signs of violence, however, and was
not bruised in any way, undoubtedly because the carpet upon
which she had fallen was thick and soft. He added she had had no
business to be getting out of bed. He had given strict orders to
that effect.</p>

<p>"And how long would you say the deceased had been dead,"
asked the coroner, "when you saw the body at seven o'clock
yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"From sixteen to seventeen hours," replied the doctor
instantly. "She had been dead since between one and two in the
afternoon of the previous day."</p>

<p>For just a few moments those present did not seem to take in
the significance of what he had said. Then, with an almost
audible gasp of surprise, they began looking wonderingly at one
another and then at Agatha.</p>

<p>Had not that very pretty little maid said she had left her
mistress alive and well at nine o'clock at night, seven hours
later than when the doctor said the old lady had died? Had not
the old lady, too, had an egg on toast for her six o'clock tea
and, later, a glass of milk and biscuits for supper? What did it
mean, this discrepancy in the evidence? Surely the doctor was
getting muddled up?</p>

<p>The coroner was evidently most puzzled too. "She had been
dead from sixteen to seventeen hours?" he exclaimed frowningly.
"Are you sure of that, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure," was the prompt reply. "Having had her
midday meal at the usual hour of half-past twelve, she died less
than an hour later, as the digestion of the contents of the
stomach was only just starting."</p>

<p>The coroner threw a quick glance at Agatha and turned again
to the doctor. "Then if we have been told that deceased was
alive as late as nine o'clock in the evening of that day, it was
not the exact truth?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," snapped the doctor. "It was a downright
lie." He nodded in the direction of Agatha. "The young woman who
has just been giving evidence told me that when she fetched me
yesterday morning to her dead mistress, but I knew from the
advanced state of the rigor mortis, the moment I touched the
body, that it was a falsehood. Rigor was fully established even
to the lower extremities, and it would have taken about sixteen
hours to complete that condition." He nodded. "I am confident no
one had been near deceased since she had had that last meal,
just after midday. She had been left totally unattended."</p>

<p>A deep hush came over the room in the long pause which
ensued. All eyes were fixed upon Agatha. Her face had paled, but
otherwise she looked exactly as she had looked before, gentle
and quiet and without the slightest trace of any emotion.</p>

<p>"And of what, Doctor," asked the coroner at length, "did the
undigested food you found in the stomach consist?"</p>

<p>"Meat, potato, lettuce and toast," was the instant reply. The
coroner looked down at his notes.</p>

<p>"No eggs or milk?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not a trace of either," said the doctor emphatically.</p>

<p>"Then one more question," said the coroner. "Is it your
opinion that the death was hastened by neglect?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "No, not speaking generally. As I
have stated, the body, for an old lady in her state of health,
was quite sufficiently nourished. I do think, however, that if
there had been anyone in attendance upon her when she had wanted
something, as she apparently had, she would not have had to get
out of bed to obtain it for herself. Then in that case she would
have undoubtedly been alive to-day. There was no reason why she
should not have lived for many years longer."</p>

<p>Agatha was called back into the witness-box. Inwardly she was
in a state of dire consternation, and it was taking all her
strength of will not to turn and attempt to run out of the room.
But she pulled herself resolutely together and faced the coroner
with calm, untroubled eyes.</p>

<p>"You have heard what Dr. Williams has just said?" he asked
sternly. "Then do you still adhere to the statement you made to
us?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Agatha.</p>

<p>"Everything you told us was the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Agatha again.</p>

<p>"Then how did you pass your time yesterday after your
mistress had had her lunch?"</p>

<p>"I did some sewing in the afternoon, I prepared the meals and
I read before I went to bed."</p>

<p>"You did not leave the house in the afternoon?" was the final
question.</p>

<p>"No, I never went out all day," said Agatha, and if anyone
ever spoke the exact truth it appeared to many in the room, and
particularly so to most of the men, it was being spoken
then.</p>

<p>Agatha returned to her seat, thinking that at any rate the
worst was over. She was, however, quite mistaken, for the
superintendent at once proceeded to call three more witnesses.
The first was a chemist whose shop was quite close to where the
Misses Brown had lived, and he testified to having seen Agatha
get on a West-End-bound bus just after one o'clock on the
afternoon the doctor had stated Miss Emma Brown had died. He was
positive both as to the time and that it was Agatha. He knew her
very well, as she had often come to the shop for Miss Brown's
medicine.</p>

<p>The other two witnesses were the chemist's wife and a woman
friend of hers. They stated that on the night of the same day,
just before eleven, they had seen Agatha come out of the Zenith
Picture Theatre in Leicester Square, and, proceeding to
Piccadilly Circus, mount a Balham bus. They had come home by the
same bus, but had travelled inside, whereas Agatha had been on
top. The bus reaching Balham, they had seen Agatha alight at the
stop nearest to the Brown home. They did not think Agatha would
have seen them. It was then nearly midnight. The coroner
cross-examined them sharply, but they stuck to their story.</p>

<p>The coroner then proceeded to sum up and immediately referred
to Agatha. He warned the jury that they must discard everything
she had said, as she was undoubtedly a most untruthful witness.
It was deplorable, but she was a young woman with no conscience
or sense of duty. Intent upon her own selfish pleasure, she had
left her sick mistress unattended all the afternoon and evening,
and to hide the dreadful consequences of her neglect had lied
deliberately and systematically. Unhappily, she could not, in
law, receive any punishment for her conduct.</p>

<p>Turning to Miss Brown's death, he said that the cause of it
was quite clear. She had died from natural causes, and that was
the verdict they must bring in.</p>

<p>The jury retired and, rather to everyone's surprise, were
away for longer than an hour. Returning at last into court, they
gave their verdict as the coroner had directed, but added a
rider&mdash;there were four women on the jury&mdash;that the
witness Agatha Wandsworth should be severely censured for her
neglect in leaving the deceased alone and unattended for so many
hours.</p>

<p>It came out afterwards that the men on the jury, to a man,
were unwilling to add the rider censuring Agatha, but the four
women had been so insistent that in the end, in order to get
back as quickly as possible to their respective occupations,
they had given in.</p>

<p>The coroner called Agatha up to him and spoke to her with the
utmost sternness. He said he was in entire agreement with the
rider and, indeed, was so shocked with her untruthfulness that,
notwithstanding her youth, he would have to consider whether he
would not have to approach the Public Prosecutor with a view to
her being put on trial for wilful perjury. He added he had never
met with a more shocking case.</p>

<p>Returning home and wondering what was going to happen next,
Agatha was followed very soon by the nephew and his wife, and
the latter at once ordered her to pack her boxes and leave
within the hour.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mum," said Agatha respectfully, "I'll get ready
at once."</p>

<p>"And I hope your conscience will trouble you for all your
life," went on the niece bitterly. "You're a downright heartless
bad girl." Then, seeing Agatha standing so respectfully before
her and feeling sorry so nice-looking a young girl should be
turned homeless on to the streets, with perhaps not a penny in
her pocket, she added sharply, "Have you any money? No, then are
there any wages due to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mum," replied Agatha, "two months."</p>

<p>It was an untruth, for she had been paid only the previous
week, but she felt quite safe there, as she had never been in
the habit of giving Miss Brown any receipt.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," said the niece, "but all the same I
will give you the money. How much did you get a month?"</p>

<p>Agatha immediately raised her wages to &pound;24 a year, and
accordingly was given &pound;4. She packed her boxes and went out to
get a taxi to take them away. She was intending to engage a room
at a very clean-looking Coffee Palace she had once noticed in a
street off Tottenham Court Road, but before she called up a taxi
another idea suddenly came to her.</p>

<p>A woman who ran a small circulating library near Clapham
Common, one of the several distant ones Agatha had been
accustomed to patronise in her search for exciting fiction, had
been bitterly complaining the last time she had gone in how
badly she was in need of help. She had said that not only had
she to attend to the lending out of the books, but to look after
her three little children and do all the housework as well.
Added to these activities, she was going backwards and forwards
to the hospital where her husband was seriously ill with a
broken hip. She was at her wits' end to know how to carry
on.</p>

<p>Agatha called in at the library and, explaining that she was
out of a situation owing to the sudden death of her
employer&mdash;she made out she had been a companion-secretary
to a 'writing lady'&mdash;offered her services, at any rate for
a few weeks until she found something more suited to her. She
added she knew a lot about books and would be willing to come
for fifteen shillings a week and her board and lodging.</p>

<p>The woman jumped at the offer and Agatha took over her duties
straightaway. She found her acquaintance with the classical
novels of the Misses Brown's large collection of books most
useful and, added to that, she soon realised she had quite a
flair for knowing what the public wanted in the way of
thrillers. Her good looks, too, brought in quite a number of new
men customers. There was a typewriter in the office, and in her
spare moments she made herself a competent master of the
machine. To her great relief, she met no one who had known her
at Balham and she heard nothing more of the coroner's
threat.</p>

<p>When she had been at the library about six months, while
liking the work, she began to tire of its limited scope, and
started looking out for something better. About one thing she
was quite determined&mdash;she would never go into domestic
service again; and for another, she would give herself a much
nicer name. With this latter end in view she had some good-class
visiting cards engraved 'Miss Diana Camille Byron' and often
took them out at night when alone in her bedroom to look at them
for a long time and wonder where they would lead her.</p>

<p>One morning, going through the advertisements of their
morning paper&mdash;she always made sure to be up early and get
it first&mdash;she saw one for an assistant (female) who was
wanted for a library attached to a museum in Norwich. She
thought it would be the very position she wanted and, giving no
reason to her employer, asked for the day off.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock found her on Liverpool Street Station buying a
ticket for Norwich. Looking for something to read, she bought a
shilling <i>Guide to East Anglia</i> at the bookstall and, a
quick reader, during the journey had carefully gone through its
contents.</p>

<p>Arriving at the ancient city, she at once proceeded to
interview the head librarian. When one of his assistants took in
her card and informed him for what purpose she was wanting to
see him, though a little intrigued by the high-sounding names,
he was inclined to feel annoyed at his time being taken up, as
he thought he had already got in view the person he wanted.</p>

<p>However, when his eyes fell upon the aristocratic and very
good-looking young woman who was ushered in to him, he was not
quite so certain he had fully made up his mind, and proceeded to
interview her with pleasurable interest. He was a scholarly-looking
man just under sixty, rather impressionable and rather
deaf.</p>

<p>She told him an artful story, some of it put together in bits
from some of the romances she had read. She said she was
twenty-three and with no parents. Her father was the late Colonel
Byron who had been killed when on active service in India. For two
years she had been managing a circulating library in Clapham.
She gave it that high-sounding name, whereas it had really no
name at all, just 'Mrs. Tomkins' over the door. She said she had
had three assistants under her. She was, however, resigning her
position as she wanted to get away from London. She wanted
quiet, to study.</p>

<p>The librarian was certainly impressed with her appearance but
a little doubtful if the work at the museum library would
interest her sufficiently to make her a good assistant. She
looked altogether too young and too pretty.</p>

<p>"But the books here, Miss Byron," he said hesitatingly,
"would be very different from those to which you have been
accustomed. Now in what particular direction do your tastes
lie?"</p>

<p>Agatha thought with suppressed amusement how scandalised he
would be if she spoke the truth and said boldy crime and
detective stories. Instead, however, she replied meekly,
"History, archaeology and reading about old times." Then
remembering what she had just read in the guide book, she added,
"Particularly about old cities, old castles and archaeology,
generally. I should love to know more about East Anglia than I
do."</p>

<p>He seemed delighted with the answer. "Well, then the work
here might suit you. Our books are nearly all old and it is for
the manuscript room I should chiefly want you. Have you read any
old books?"</p>

<p>Agatha was shrewd enough not to get out of her depth. "Not
many," she replied hesitatingly, "but, of course, I have read
Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales.</i>" She spoke the truth there,
but might have added she had found them very boring and skipped
through them quickly. She hoped to goodness he wouldn't ask her
anything about them, as she could remember very little. She need
not, however, have worried, as she had started him upon one of
his favourite themes, and he was quite prepared to do all the
talking.</p>

<p>"Of course!" he exclaimed smilingly. "But there is no 'of
course' about it, Miss Byron! I am sure very few young ladies of
your age would have had intelligence enough to read them. They
would infinitely prefer the trashy fiction so much in vogue
to-day."</p>

<p>He talked on for quite a long while and then said in
conclusion, "Well, I believe you are the very young lady I have
been looking for and though, of course, the appointment rests in
the hands of our committee, I think I can safely promise you
will get it. You will know for certain next week." He smiled in
a most friendly way as he added, "Myself, I am quite satisfied
with you, but as a matter of formality I should like you to send
me a reference and please let me have it at once."</p>

<p>So that night Agatha typed for herself a good recommendation,
not too fulsome, but making it quite plain that Miss Diana Byron
was a most trustworthy and desirable person for anyone to
employ. She signed it with a grand flourish 'Alexander
McFarlane, M.A., Oxon.' For her address she gave that of the
little library, putting however, only Clapham High Road.</p>

<p>The following week she received notification that she had
been appointed and the same morning left her employer greatly
inconvenienced at her sudden departure. That, however, was of no
moment to Agatha, for, as usual, she was thinking only of
herself.</p>

<p>Two days later she started upon her duties at Norwich, at
first just a little nervous she might not be able to carry them
out properly, but, sharp and adaptable as she always was, she
soon found everything going smoothly. The work was both light
and easy, the chief requirement of whoever carried it on,
apparently, being that she should be thoroughly trustworthy, as
all the time she would be handling old books and manuscripts of
almost priceless value.</p>

<p>As the days went by she often smiled exultingly to herself as
she contrasted the lot of the little general servant, Agatha
Wandsworth, of only a few months back, whom that vulgar baker
boy had continued to address as Aggie up to the very last, with
the stately Miss Diana Byron now following intellectual
pursuits. Instead, too, of being paid a few shillings every
Saturday as wages, she was now in receipt of a salary computed
in aristocratic guineas. Three guineas a week was what she
received, with the promise of an early increase if she proved
satisfactory.</p>

<p>When she had been at the museum a few weeks, working with her
chief, Dr. Bowery, a doctor of literature, a start was made to
catalogue the large number of old manuscripts in the collection
of the museum and she was most interested as he talked chattily
to her about their values.</p>

<p>"For this," he remarked of one of about twenty leaves of
vellum bound together with thongs, "only last year we were
offered a thousand guineas by a rich American collector, but of
course we would not take it. And of this," he said, holding up
another, "its real value has never been appraised. The
handwriting certainly belongs to the tenth century and it is
believed to be one of Caedmon's poems. Ever heard of him?" he
laughed, and when Agatha shook her head, he went on, "Well, he
was the earliest Christian poet and died in six hundred and
eighty. What little of his work has been handed down to us is
beyond value. Many unscrupulous collectors would be prepared to
pay large sums for anything of his and not divulge how they had
obtained it."</p>

<p>The doctor was often called away, with Agatha then being
alone in the room. With what treasures she was surrounded, she
sighed often, and how easy it would be for her to take some!
Why, if she could only find a purchaser, what money she could
make, and how soon she would be set up for life!</p>

<p>Dr. Bowery's blood would have frozen in horror had he only
known the thoughts which kept running in the pretty little head
of his charming assistant.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a if="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE RISE OF A MASTER CRIMINAL.</h2>

<p class="first">WE are for ever being told by many worthy
people that criminals are made and not born, yet, for all that,
no plant can flourish unless it be in a fertile soil, and in the
annals of dark crime this soil has many times been found in most
unexpected places, places, too, where one would have imagined
there could be no possible encouragement for the making of a
criminal.</p>

<p>Ramon Anthony Ellister, to give him his full names, though
born almost in the precincts of a cathedral and coming from an
excellent family and educated in most respectable, conventional
surroundings, had never been anything else than criminally
inclined. It was certainly rather surprising, for his father had
been an archdeacon and his mother, the daughter of a bishop, a
woman of most kindly and gentle disposition. His many brothers
and sisters, too, of whom there were eight, all grew up to be
most respected members of the community, with seemingly no vice
at all in them.</p>

<p>Ramon, however, had been a rebel against convention and
authority from his earliest days and, proceeding to good
schools, had been a nuisance to his masters and teachers all
along. A good-looking boy, with nice features and a sharp,
intelligent face, his eyes, to a critical observer, would
nevertheless have always scored a bad point. They were of an
intense light-blue colour, prominent, glassy and very hard. The
first impression that he so often gave to strangers was that he
was sizing them up, with his opinion not being altogether a
flattering one. He was decidedly clever, but would work only
when it pleased him, which was not very often.</p>

<p>The archdeacon was in receipt of a good stipend and had also
some small private means. The largeness of his family, however,
and providing them all with a good education, kept him,
comparatively speaking, poor, and ready money, except for the
absolutely necessary things of life, was always more or less
tight.</p>

<p>Ramon was sent to Winchester College, where he was a success
only at games, and afterwards, following the family tradition,
on to Oxford, where he did no better, coming down without taking
his degree.</p>

<p>University life had had a very bad and disturbing influence
upon him, for he had mixed with young fellows plentifully
supplied with money and had not been able to keep up the pace
with them without getting heavily into debt. The old archdeacon
had sighed heavily when, to save the family honour, he had had
to draw upon his small capital and pay what Ramon owed.</p>

<p>At the 'varsity, because of his own straitened means, Ramon
had noted with great bitterness the all-conquering power of
money and, in consequence, had determined that the get-rich-quickly
policy should be the one he would follow through
life.</p>

<p>The only employment, however, which he had at first been able
to obtain had been that of a private tutor to the so-called
backward boy of a wealthy owner of a chain of grocery stores.
The opulent grocer's country place was a palatial residence in
Cambridgeshire, and there, for &pound;150 per annum, Ramon was
installed to furnish the mentally delinquent youth with a new
cerebrum and render him wholly different from the half imbecile
he really was.</p>

<p>Ramon would not have stayed there six months had not the
house been only a few miles from Newmarket and, with a car at
his disposal and the father coming down only for an occasional
weekend, he was able, accompanied, of course, by his charge, to
spend a lot of his time among trainers and jockeys on the
celebrated heath. In that way Ramon gathered in quite a lot of
information about racehorses, but, apparently, it was not of the
best kind, as most of his salary, with unhappy regularity,
disappeared in losing bets.</p>

<p>The grocer was very proud to tell all his friends he had got
'an Oxford toff' to teach his son, but not so pleased at the bad
swear words the boy had picked up. Happily for Ramon, however,
the boy's intelligence was not sufficiently advanced for him to
explain lucidly how and in what way he had acquired this new
vocabulary.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Ramon got sick of the job and threw it up, a week
or two later, through family influence, obtaining employment in
a stockbroker's office in the city, fondly hoping that in that
occupation, when once 'in the know', he would one day buy shares
for a few pence and sell them for many pounds.</p>

<p>He continued to be most interested in racing and was always
on the look-out for winners at thirty-three and fifty to one.
With no luck, however, for they would not come his way, and in
consequence his four guineas, for that was his salary now, was
generally considerably depleted at the end of the week.</p>

<p>The firm he was with was a good-class one with many wealthy
clients, and big speculations and investments were being made
every day. Sometimes he would gnash his teeth in envious rage as
he noted substantial sums being made in the course of a few
short hours. With a shrewd eye for rises and falls on the
markets and calculating, except in getting rid of his own money
in self-indulgence almost as soon as he received it, he often
'spotted' good things, and when they turned out all right and he
saw fat cheques being despatched all round upon settling days,
his mood was so murderous that he could hardly contain himself.
He would do anything, he swore, to get money! If only he knew
how to rob a bank!</p>

<p>One Sunday he bicycled down to Hampton Court to have lunch
with a maiden aunt who was his godmother and quite well-to-do.
She was tight with her money, though certainly she occasionally
gave him a pound or two. Happening to be in a good humour that
day, and under the mellowing influence of two glasses of good
old port, she confided to him she had recently made a new will
and put him down for a small legacy, some hundreds, she
said.</p>

<p>Ramon thanked her warmly, but she would probably have almost
had a stroke if she had only known what passed at once into his
mind. He looked at her old scraggy neck and thought how easy she
would be to throttle. He thought, too, of coming down another
day with some powdered glass. Her sight was so bad that he felt
sure he would be able to sprinkle it upon what she was eating
without her noticing it. He had read somewhere that people could
be killed in that way. He felt he couldn't wait for the
money.</p>

<p>However, the old lady continued to smile amiably at him and,
noting that his suit looked rather shabby and, altogether, his
appearance was not as spick and span as usual, greatly to his
astonishment, in parting she gave him a cheque for &pound;5.</p>

<p>As it happened, the present could not possibly have come at a
more opportune moment, as he was very hard up, his dress suit
being in pawn. He had not known what he was going to do, as he
had just received an invitation from Sir James Ellister, a
baronet cousin of his father, to spend the following week-end at
Bolton Park near Guildford. He had been thinking he would have
to decline the invitation and had been most depressed in
consequence. He had been to the Park once before and enjoyed the
visit immensely.</p>

<p>Sir James was a very wealthy man and the best of everything
was to be had at his table, with champagne always at dinner.
Apart from that, Ramon knew there would be plenty of company and
he would be meeting people of that class with whom he so loved
to mingle&mdash;people with money.</p>

<p>He wrote at once accepting the invitation and got his suit
out of pawn.</p>

<p>In later days and all his life long Ramon was to remember
that Saturday he went down to Bolton Park, for that night he
committed his first real crime and got away with it so easily
that from that very hour his feet were set on the downward path.
He robbed Colonel Leggett of &pound;65 which he took out of his
wallet.</p>

<p>It happened in this way. About three-quarters of an hour
before dinner a number of the many guests who had been invited
for the week-end were gathered in the big lounge hall and
chatting animatedly together, when the colonel bustled in in a
state of great excitement. He was so pleased with himself that
he had to tell everyone his news.</p>

<p>He said he had come straight from the races which had been
run at Sandown Park that afternoon and had won the nice sum of
&pound;300 in a cash bet.</p>

<p>"I had three hundred to nine against Gay Lady," he exclaimed
gleefully, "and the little beauty just romped home. It was the
easiest win of the afternoon," and, in support of his statement,
he produced a bulky wallet from his breast pocket and held it
out for everyone to see. "All in tenners and fivers," he went
on. "I wouldn't take big notes as they are so easily lost. Gad,
it was the biggest cash win I've ever had! I didn't know the
bookmaker and he didn't know me. I just went up to him and said
'What price Gay Lady?' and he said, 'A hundred to three'. I said
I'd take it three times, and he said 'Good' and there I
was."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you go and lose it all next Saturday at
Kempton," laughed Sir James. "There'll be some very tricky races
there and the winners'll be hard to pick."</p>

<p>"But I shall pick them," laughed back the colonel
confidently. "I'll be there all right and if I see you may be
able to put you on to something good." He looked up at the
clock. "But I say, I say, I shall be late for dinner if I don't
hurry." He gave a bit of a hoarse cough. "I feel almost as if
I've got a chill threatening and I'll have a good hot bath at
once to shake it off," and he hastened away up the big
staircase.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Ramon went up to dress, too, and, coming
to a door not far from his own room, heard the splashing of
water and the unmistakable loud cough of the old colonel.</p>

<p>He pulled up dead in his tracks. An idea had come to him and
he caught his breath in his excitement. The door was not
properly shut! It had only been pulled to and the colonel was in
the adjoining bathroom, having his bath! His clothes would be
lying about and in the pocket of his jacket would be the wallet
with that &pound;300 in notes!</p>

<p>He looked up and down the corridor. No one was in sight, and
he made up his mind in a flash. In the passing of a few seconds
he was inside the room and looking round for the clothes. There
they were, and the jacket was lying on the bed! In an instant
the wallet was in his hand and he was opening it. There were the
notes, folded into a thick wad. Quick as lightning he pulled out
a good number, thrust them into one of his trouser pockets,
pushed back the wad into the wallet, returned the wallet to the
jacket and was tiptoeing from the room. The whole business had
not taken much longer than half a minute.</p>

<p>Gaining his own room without meeting anyone, he caught sight
of his face in the mirror. It was ghastly pale and his eyes were
as wide as saucers. He sank down into a big chair and for a few
moments could hardly get his breath.</p>

<p>Calming down very quickly, however, he took the notes out of
his pocket to see what he had got. There were five of &pound;10 each
and three &pound;5 ones. They were none of them in sequence and, from
their rumpled appearance, had evidently been well in
circulation. He made a rapid calculation. Whew, &pound;65, more than
fifteen weeks' salary, and all obtained in about half a minute!
What an easy way of getting money and how small had been the
risk! The colonel had probably come for the week-end just as he
had, and the chances were that the old man would not count the
banknotes again until he got back home on the Monday. Then
certainly he would be very puzzled to account for them being &pound;65
short, but he would hardly think they had been stolen from him,
for a thief would have surely taken the lot. No, most likely he
would think he had dropped them on the racecourse when tucking
the wad into his wallet! That would be the only reasonable
explanation!</p>

<p>Ah, but he, Ramon, must be careful! He must provide for every
eventuality! If the notes did happen to be missed and a search
made, they must not be found on him. No, he would hide them away
somewhere, certainly not in his room, and pick them up only at
the very last moment before he was going away on the Monday
morning.</p>

<p>He thought hard as he was dressing hurriedly for dinner, and
finally sealed the notes in a Bolton Park envelope which he took
from the writing-desk in his room. Then, sauntering out of the
house just before dinner was announced, he thrust the envelope
under the earth in the garden close to one of the walls where,
if rain did come, it would not get wet.</p>

<p>Freed now from all anxiety, he enjoyed the evening immensely.
He was given a pretty girl to take in to dinner, the meal was
excellent and the wines exhilarating. Afterwards, he had several
dances with charming partners and, finally, he went into the
billiard-room and had a hundred up with Colonel Leggett. The old
man was most friendly and they talked a lot about racing. Ramon
announced he, too, would be going to the races at Kempton on the
Saturday and so they arranged to look out for each other on the
lawn before the grandstand.</p>

<p>As Ramon had surmised, the notes were not missed the next
day, and on the Monday he returned to the city with them in his
breast pocket.</p>

<p>All that week he lived in a state of considerable but subdued
excitement, cudgelling his brains to think of more ways of
making easy money. He thought of annexing cheques mailed to
clients on settling days, but speedily discarded that idea as
all the cheques were stamped 'not negotiable' and 'account
payee'. Next, he wondered if old Gorham, the senior partner of
the firm, was in the habit of carrying about with him anything
worth having. The old chap was bent and frail, and he, Ramon,
could easily find an opportunity of creeping up behind him on
the private staircase and giving him a good push down. The fall
would stun him and he, Ramon again, would be able to pick his
pockets and slip away before help came. However, he gave up that
idea, too. The whole business would be too risky and he might
get nothing or very little for his pains, either.</p>

<p>The following Saturday afternoon he met Colonel Leggett at
Kempton Park and the two got on together like a house on fire.
Ramon was certain he must have discovered the loss of the &pound;65 by
now, and was most curious to find out how the colonel was
thinking it had come about.</p>

<p>He was soon to know, for, just before they had finally
decided which horse to back in the first race, the colonel
nodded frowningly towards a stout, merry-looking bookmaker
operating by the rails. "Don't back with that chap," he said.
"He gave me &pound;65 short last week, though I can't think how I
didn't notice it at the time." He smiled wryly. "It must have
been the half bottle of fizz I drank to celebrate, before I went
to him to collect the money."</p>

<p>They had quite a pleasant afternoon, with both of them at the
end being a few pounds in hand. Then it was agreed they should
meet the following fortnight at Hurst Park. "I live close near
there at East Molesey," said the colonel, "and I shall be
delighted if you'll come home to dinner with me and stop the
night. We're quite simple people and you won't have to dress.
There'll be only my wife and I." He smiled. "No footmen. Nothing
like at your relative's in Bolton Park." He closed one eye.
"Still, I keep a good cellar and can put on a better Burgundy
than Sir James has got."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Ramon dined and spent the night at his house
and, keeping his eyes open, was very glad he'd come. The
Leggetts were evidently quite well off, and though the two men
did not dress for dinner Mrs. Leggett did. She wore quite a lot
of jewellery, too, and Ramon guessed there would be a good bit
more in her room, which was on the ground floor because she had
a weak heart and could not go up and down stairs. He was no
judge of jewellery, but thought that if the stones in the brooch
she was wearing were real diamonds, they would be worth a
considerable sum.</p>

<p>Greatly daring, the next morning when they were all sitting
together in the garden, he made an excuse to go back into the
house to get some cigarettes. He heard loud talking and laughing
in the direction of the kitchen and was pretty certain all the
three maids would be there. Making his plans during the night
and intending to be all prepared for any opportunity he might
get, a few minutes before he had pocketed a little file from the
garage when he was with his host who was making some adjustments
to his car.</p>

<p>He darted into Mrs. Leggett's bedroom and looked quickly
about. Nothing valuable was in view, but, after pulling open
several drawers, he found in one in the wardrobe what he was
looking for, a jewel case. It was unlocked and, after one quick
glance inside, which showed him, among quite a lot of pieces of
other jewellery, the diamond-looking brooch of the previous
night, he snapped to the lid and replaced the case where he had
found it.</p>

<p>Without a moment's waste of time he examined the fastenings
of the windows. They had only simple ordinary bolts, fixed on
with two screws. With the screw-driver in his stout combination
pocket-knife, he had the screws out in a minute and was filing
hard at the screw threads. When the threads were almost, but not
quite, filed away, he thrust them back in their holes and, his
work for the time accomplished, darted out of the room as
quickly as he had entered and leisurely rejoined the colonel and
Mrs. Leggett on the lawn. Altogether he had been gone barely
five minutes and he reckoned the stage was now all set for an
easy burglary whenever he wanted to carry it out.</p>

<p>And carried out it was the next week upon the first dark
night. The house stood in its own grounds, there was no dog, and
everything was perfectly easy. He got the jewellery at the time
he knew they would be at dinner, finding, however, that his work
upon the screws had been quite unnecessary as one window was
open at the top. He had ridden down on his bicycle and by ten
o'clock was back home in his lodgings in West Kensington
examining his booty. It was quite a nice little haul, although
he had absolutely no idea as to its real value. There were
several expensive-looking brooches, including the diamond one,
quite a number of heavily jewelled rings, two bracelets and a
beautiful little wrist-watch studded with diamonds.</p>

<p>He thought callously that probably Mrs. Leggett would have a
bad heart attack when she discovered her loss, but was not in
the slightest degree sorry for her. His hard, glassy eyes just
sparkled exultingly and there was no regret at all for his
despicable return of the kindly-natured old colonel's
hospitality. He had no regrets, no remorse, absolutely no
conscience at all.</p>

<p>Rather to his disappointment, he saw nothing in the
newspapers in the ensuing days about the burglary and, to
satisfy his curiosity, one night rang up the colonel with the
excuse of finding out if he were attending the next race meeting
at Sandown Park. The colonel replied he thought not, as his wife
was very upset as their house had been burgled and most of her
jewellery stolen. He went on that, very carelessly, the window
of her room had been left open and the burglar had evidently got
in that way. The police were not hopeful about catching him, but
it was quite certain he must have been someone who was well
acquainted with the house, because he knew exactly where to go
and had taken nothing but the jewel case. No, there were no
finger-marks, no clues of any kind.</p>

<p>The police said the only chance of catching the man was if he
went to some pawnbroker or dealer and tried to sell the rings
and brooches as they were. If he took the stones and sold them
in twos and threes, then there was no hope at all, particularly
so if he sold them abroad. The damned foreigners would buy
anything if they got it cheap.</p>

<p>"I suppose, altogether, they were worth a lot of money,"
suggested Ramon, thrilled that he was now going to get some idea
of their value.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, yes!" sighed the colonel. "A couple of
thousand wouldn't buy them to-day."</p>

<p>Ramon hung up the receiver in a most delighted frame of mind.
The future held out rosy prospects for him. Why, with even one
thousand pounds he would be able to rent an office and start as
an outside jobber himself! In the four years he had been with
his present employers he had got to know quite a number of their
clients and some of them he thought might be induced to do their
business with him.</p>

<p>Still, in the ensuing weeks he was a most worried man. He had
made up his mind to wait for his annual fortnight's holiday, in
two months' time, and then run over to Paris and sell some of
the stones. In the meantime he did not know where to keep the
stolen jewellery. He had no secure lock-up place in his
lodgings, and if he bought a small safe, both his landlady and
her husband, who were a most gossiping couple, would become
inquisitive at once. To make matters worse, their daughter was
being courted by a policeman, who, of an evening, seemed always
to be about the place.</p>

<p>Of course he had got rid of the jewel case; that he had
filled with stones and thrown into the river one night from the
towing path between Hammersmith and Putney, but the jewellery he
had always to carry about with him. It was true they were in a
money-belt, which he had bought and wore night and day, but he
was always terrified he would meet with an accident in the
street, be knocked down or run over and taken unconscious to a
hospital. Then what would be thought when all this valuable
jewellery was found upon him? Of course the police would be
told, he would be questioned and, at the earliest moment, taken
straight from the hospital to the nearest police station!</p>

<p>Thinking about it preyed upon his mind, and in time he became
so nervous and hesitating when crossing any thoroughfare that he
knew he was inviting the very catastrophe he so dreaded.</p>

<p>To make the belt less bulky he spent several nights prising
the stones out of their settings and filing all the gold into
dust, the only thing he did not interfere with being the
diamond-studded wrist-watch. The gold dust made quite a little
pile when he had finished, and he felt most uncomfortable when
he took it into a shop in Wardour Street to sell it.</p>

<p>"Dental scrap?" queried the man behind the counter and Ramon
nodded in great relief. He hadn't thought of that. "All right,"
went on the man, "come back the day after to-morrow. Name and
address, please?"</p>

<p>Ramon gave both false, and breathed a sigh of relief when he
was streets away from the shop without being followed. Of course
the man was suspicious and that was why he had not paid him
straightaway. He, Ramon, was lucky to have got off so lightly.
He would give Wardour Street a wide berth in future.</p>

<p>A week later, however, happening to meet a dentist friend
when having his lunch in the city, he asked him casually what he
usually did with his dental scrap. "Sell it, of course," was the
reply. "You don't think we throw it away, do you?"</p>

<p>"Do they give you the money at once?" asked Ramon.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. It's got to be assayed, first, to find
out what it's worth," and Ramon realised what a fool he had
been, and the next day called in Wardour Street to get the
money. He was given &pound;14 5s. without any comment.</p>

<p>His holidays came round at last, bringing with them, however,
another anxiety. Dare he take all the stones over to France with
him? What if the Customs people searched him for contraband?
They would be sure to communicate with the English police at
once! Even if he left the wrist-watch at home, the big diamonds
and emeralds associated with the string of pearls would point
straight to what the colonel's wife had lost! He would be
questioned, enquiries would be made about him and he would be
lost!</p>

<p>In the end he resolved to take over only the two biggest
diamonds, those out of the big brooch, and these, to get safely
through the Customs, he would carry in his mouth. All the other
things he would hide in his mattress, risking that his landlady
would notice when she made his bed that the mattress had been
tampered with. Still, he consoled himself he would only be away
three days, for, with the stones disposed of, he was intending
to come straight back.</p>

<p>He went to Paris, by way of Newhaven and Dieppe, arriving
without adventure, and the next morning picked out the best
jeweller's shop in the Rue de Rivoli. Stating his business, he
was taken in to one of the heads of the firm, who eyed him very
intently. To see how he got on, Ramon was offering only one of
the diamonds at first and, speaking in good French, he said it
had belonged to his mother and been in the family many
years.</p>

<p>The jeweller was most polite, but, explaining it was always
desirable to know something about those who offered them
valuable stones, asked Ramon if he were living in Paris.</p>

<p>Ramon shook his head. "No, I am only here on holiday for a
few days. I live in London."</p>

<p>"Then why did you come to Paris to dispose of this stone?"
asked the jeweller, with what Ramon thought was a decidedly
suspicious note in his tones. "Why do you now come to us?"</p>

<p>"It's very simple," replied Ramon, who had got his tale all
ready. "Three years ago I bought a ring here, but, getting tired
of it, disposed of it recently in London." He laughed. "I got
nearly as much as I paid you and so thought you must be a pretty
reliable firm to have dealings with. You didn't overcharge
me."</p>

<p>The jeweller seemed quite satisfied and, taking the diamond
with him, left the room. He was, however, away for so long that
Ramon began to get nervous, thinking the man must be ringing up
the police. Just when the tension was beginning to be
unbearable, he returned and said he was prepared to give &pound;110
English money for the stone. Ramon pretended to make out it was
rather less than he had expected but agreed to sell, whereupon
the receipt was made out, which he signed 'William Nash'.</p>

<p>"And as the sum is not exactly a small one," said the
jeweller, "just as a matter of form kindly put down the name of
the hotel where you are staying and your home address in
London."</p>

<p>Ramon was thoroughly frightened and could not get out of
Paris quickly enough. He left by the night train and was not
happy in his mind until he was back again in West Kensington the
following morning. Then he laughed at his fears and cursed
himself for having been such a fool. Of course the Paris
jeweller had had no suspicion about him! It had been an ordinary
business transaction and no doubt the man was pleased with
himself for having made a good deal. Most probably he had paid
only half the real value of the stone.</p>

<p>The mattress had not been interfered with and very quickly
all the other stones were back in Ramon's belt. Having still
eleven days of his holiday left, he resolved to spend them in
Eastbourne and put up at the Westworth Hydropathic Hotel there.
The Hydro was a select high-class private hotel, standing in its
own grounds, and he had heard Sir James Ellister speak very well
of it. The latter had said that not only did it keep an
excellent table, but also one mixed with very nice people
there.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with plenty of money to spend and determined to
enjoy himself, Tuesday evening found Ramon installed in the
Hydro, and he was soon of opinion he could not have done better.
Everything came well up to his expectations. The social hostess
introduced him to some nice girls, there was dancing and cards
every evening and plenty of out-door amusements during the
day.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the visitors were well up in the
social scale and all appeared to be well-to-do. Each night at
dinner, as he looked round the big dining hall and noted the
expensive-looking jewellery some of the women were wearing, he
thought what nice pickings there would be for someone if he
could only get into their rooms and help himself when they were
absent during the day.</p>

<p>Still, he told himself with a frown, he would leave jewellery
and precious stones alone in future, as they were much too
difficult to dispose of with safety. He didn't know the ropes
well enough and, though there must be plenty of buyers who would
buy without asking any questions, he had no idea how to get in
touch with them.</p>

<p>A first-class bridge-player, and the atmosphere of the Hydro
being a friendly one, he got a game every night. The points he
played for where never higher than two shillings a hundred and,
coming out a winner three nights running, he regretted they had
not been higher. At another table, occupied every night, he knew
the play was for sixpence a point and he was greatly envious of
people who were wealthy enough to win or lose upwards of &pound;50 at
a sitting and think nothing of it either way.</p>

<p>Two men who always played at this particular table interested
him a lot; indeed, he had been interested in them almost from
the first moment he had arrived at the Hydro. They were so
smartly groomed and looked altogether such travelled and
sophisticated men of the world. They were friends, and he had
heard the elder, who appeared to be in the middle thirties,
called Edgerton, while the other, some six or seven years
younger, was Warden. They were great favourites at the Hydro and
seemed to be continually running someone or other up to Beachy
Head in their beautiful car to enjoy the view there.</p>

<p>They splashed their money about as if expense were nothing to
them and, with their table in the dining-room not far from his,
Ramon noted they always had champagne at dinner and sometimes at
lunch too.</p>

<p>As with most of the visitors at the Hydro, they were
interested in racing, and there being a meeting on the Saturday
at Lewes, some twenty miles distant from Eastbourne, Ramon saw
them set off in the morning with a fully-packed car, carrying
not only its passengers but also a big luncheon hamper and a
case of champagne. He himself followed later in a motor omnibus
provided by the Hydro, and during the course of the afternoon
ran into them several times. Recognising him as a fellow visitor
at the Hydro, they always gave him a friendly nod and smile.</p>

<p>Ramon had several bets, but with no luck at first, and after
the third race was nearly &pound;20 to the bad. However, in the fourth
race he fluked a lucky winner at twelve to one, having three
pounds on the animal. He was just collecting his money when the
two men happened to come by again and they stopped to
congratulate him at having backed such a good-priced winner.</p>

<p>"Lucky chap!" exclaimed Edgerton. "But why didn't you give us
the tip?"</p>

<p>"I didn't really think it had much chance," explained Ramon.
"In fact, I only backed it because I've lost money on it several
times and was afraid to let it run loose."</p>

<p>"Well, we can't grumble," laughed the other. "We had a nice
big bet on Minerva in the youngster's and got six to one, when
it started at only threes."</p>

<p>Getting back to the Hydro and having a cigarette by himself
in the lounge, the two came up to speak to him again, plumping
themselves down beside him. "Whew," exclaimed Edgerton, "but
it's hard work making money on a racecourse, up and down the
grandstand all the time! Still, between us we are up &pound;70 odd on
the afternoon." He made a grimace. "But with the last winning
bet we had the damned bookmaker would insist on paying me the
&pound;40 all in dirty one-pound treasury notes. I expect he wanted to
get rid of them because they were so really filthy. Anyhow, I
didn't carry them on me a minute longer than I could help. I've
just been up to my room and shoved them, well wrapped up in
newspaper, at the bottom of my suit-case."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes, discussing the afternoon's
racing, and then the younger of them, Warden, said, "But I say,
Gus, if we're going to that chemist's before dinner we must cut
off now. It's nearly half-past six," and, rising with great
haste, and with a nod to Ramon, they hurried from the
lounge.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes or so later Ramon got up, too, to go to
his room to change for dinner and then his eyes fell upon a
Hydro bedroom key in the armchair where Edgerton had been
sitting.</p>

<p>"Careless chap!" he exclaimed, picking up the key with the
intention of handing it in at the office. "It would serve him
right if&mdash;&mdash;" but he stopped suddenly and looked round
upon the others in the lounge. There was no one near him and no
one appeared to have seen him pick up the key. He drew in a deep
breath. Gad, why shouldn't he do it? As likely as not the fellow
had been as careless in not locking his suit-case as he had been
in dropping his bedroom key! If ten of the notes were taken
probably they would never be missed! That Edgerton fellow would
just pay them one by one as he spent them! The coast was all
clear! He had gone to that chemist's and would be away at least
ten minutes!</p>

<p>He thrust the key into his pocket and walked leisurely out of
the lounge. In less than a minute, from the number on the key,
he had found the right door and, opening it, was slipping into
the room. The room was a double-bedded one with a bathroom
adjoining. The bathroom door was slightly ajar. On the other
side of the room was a luggage stand and upon it lay a large
suit-case. That the suit-case was not locked was evidenced by a
considerable portion of some undergarment hanging out under the
lid.</p>

<p>Closing the door quietly but very quickly, Ramon tiptoed over
to the suitcase and, flinging up the lid, thrust his hands deep
down to feel for the newspaper packet of treasury notes. Then
his blood almost froze in horror as he heard a noise behind him
and, jerking himself round like lightning to see what it was,
saw Edgerton and Warden darting out of the bathroom.</p>

<p>It was all over in three seconds, with his escape cut off by
both of the men getting between him and the door. He was too
terror-stricken to utter even the faintest cry of surprise.</p>

<p>Edgerton spoke very sternly. "Exactly, caught red-handed in
the very act!" He smiled a grim, hard smile. "Now, young man,
what have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>Ramon had nothing to say. He just stood stock-still, pale as
death, and moistening over his dry lips with his tongue.
Edgerton looked amused. "We thought you were like this, my boy,"
he went on, "and so set a trap for you. We guessed you'd fall in
it and so you did." His face hardened. "We're house detectives
and have had our eyes on you ever since you arrived. Now, have
you anything to say before we ring for the manager and have you
handed over to the police?"</p>

<p>But Ramon was still tongue-tied. His forehead was all pricked
out in little beads of sweat and his hands felt dripping wet. It
was a ghastly situation, bad enough in itself, but when his
money belt came to be examined and the precious stones found it
would be ten times worse.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to say?" asked Edgerton. He screwed up his
eyes. "You call yourself Ellister, don't you? Well, are you any
relation of Sir James Ellister of Bolton Park?"</p>

<p>Ramon found his voice at last, a hoarse and trembling one.
"No-o," he said stutteringly, "I'm not."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," snapped Edgerton. "You've got
something about you of the cut of his jib." He made a gesture of
disgust. "What a scandal to bring upon your relations!"</p>

<p>Warden now spoke for the first time. "You're an habitual
thief, aren't you?" he asked. "You make your living this way,
don't you?"</p>

<p>Ramon pulled himself together and, summoning all his
resolution, tried to look indignant. "No, I don't," he burst out
furiously. "I've never done anything like this before." He began
wondering if, after all, there were some way of getting out of
it, and tried to excuse himself. "I didn't intend to take
anything," he went on vehemently, "but when you told me that
tale about the dirty treasury notes I wanted to see if it were
true."</p>

<p>To his surprise they did not seem to be incredulous as he
thought they would have been and he added, "I was just curious.
That was all."</p>

<p>Edgerton looked very grave. "You tell us on your honour you
were not going to take anything?" He looked round at his
companion. "Do you think we can believe that, Bert?"</p>

<p>Warden shrugged his shoulders. "It is possible," he said. He
nodded. "He may have done it on the spur of the moment, without
thinking."</p>

<p>Edgerton considered. "Of course," he said slowly and as if
weighing every word, "if it comes into court it will be a
disgraceful thing for you and ruin your whole life." He looked
troubled. "At the same time it won't be a good thing for the
Hydro here. The scandal will give the place a bad name if
visitors don't think they can stay here without the chance of
being robbed." He pointed to a chair farthest away from the
door. "You go and sit there," he said sharply, "and I'll consult
with my colleague and see what is best to be done."</p>

<p>Ramon did as he was directed and the two men whispered
together for a few minutes. To Ramon they seemed arguing, with
Edgerton at first unwilling to act as the other wanted. Finally,
however, it appeared they had come to some agreement and the
elder man turned to Ramon again.</p>

<p>"See here," he said frowningly, "as the house detectives here
we are allowed a certain amount of discretion, and so, giving
you the benefit of the doubt, this is what we are willing to
do." He spoke very sternly. "You are to leave the Hydro at once,
after we have gone through your luggage to make sure you are
taking away nothing you should not. Also, you are to pay a
substantial sum to be given to charity. It must be at least
&pound;100. Now have you got that amount of money with you?"</p>

<p>Oh, the relief in Ramon's mind! At the same time&mdash;he was
thinking hard. He was so slow in making any reply that Edgerton
spoke again. "If you haven't the whole &pound;100 you can pay what you
can in cash," he said, "and for what is short you can give us a
cheque. Have you got a cheque-book?"</p>

<p>Ramon nodded. "Yes, in the suit-case in my room." He wiped
over his forehead with his handkerchief. "It is most kind of you
and very sporting to accept my explanation."</p>

<p>"Where's the money?" asked Edgerton.</p>

<p>"It's in my room," said Ramon shakily. "I'll give it
you."</p>

<p>"We don't want to ruin you," said Edgerton, "and, as I say,
we want to save the Hydro from the scandal. Now what amount have
you in cash?"</p>

<p>"Nearly the &pound;100," said Ramon shakily, "&mdash;in my room."
He looked thoroughly cowed. "If you come with me now you shall
have it at once."</p>

<p>"All right," said Edgerton sternly, "but no tricks or trying
to escape, or we'll take you down to the manager
straightaway."</p>

<p>Accompanied by the two, and his legs being so wobbly that
Warden had to take his arm, Ramon tottered along the passage to
his room. His hands were so unsteady that Edgerton had to take
his key and unlock the door for him. All three entered the room
and closed the door behind them. Edgerton walked over to the
suit-case. It was locked.</p>

<p>"Give me your keys," said Edgerton. "Tell me where the money
is and I'll get it. You can sit down."</p>

<p>Ramon sat down, but made no attempt to put his hand in his
pocket for the keys. He leant back in his chair, but not as one
who was physically or mentally exhausted. He settled himself
comfortably. The expression of his face had altered. It was no
longer weak and pleading. He clamped his jaws resolutely
together as he looked from one to the other of his two
captors.</p>

<p>"Give me the key," ordered Edgerton peremptorily, "at
once."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Ramon. He took out a cigarette and lighted
it. After a few puffs he smiled. "Now, I'll talk to you two
guys," he said briskly, "and straightaway"&mdash;his voice
hardened&mdash;"you both take in you won't get a penny from me,
not a single penny." He threw out his hands. "Where's your
evidence against me? I haven't been near your room. I don't know
what you mean. You come in here for a friendly drink&mdash;you
can have one, there's the whisky and a syphon over
there&mdash;and then start asking me for money. What do you
mean? I tell you I don't understand it."</p>

<p>Edgerton's face was black as thunder and Warden's mouth was
gaping in surprise. "You young fool!" snarled the former. "You
can't bluff it out! There are two of us to bear witness,
remember! And we're the house detectives."</p>

<p>Ramon gave a loud guffaw. "Detectives!" he jeered. He pointed
to Warden. "Why, that chap was squiffy last night. I heard the
porter talking about it this morning. He had had to help you
carry him up to his room. A fine detective he is, drunk on
duty!" He grinned a little sheepishly. "I admit you rattled me
at first. You put the wind up me right enough, but, directly you
suggested me paying money to be let off, I knew it was all a
fake. Detectives wouldn't be willing to compound a felony and
that's what you were doing." He flicked the ashes from his
cigarette. "No, you're a couple of blackmailers. That's all you
are, crooks!"</p>

<p>Edgerton could hardly get out his words. "Do you deny you
came into my room and were searching through the suit-case for
those notes?"</p>

<p>Ramon was quite collected. "Certainly not!" he remarked. He
grinned again. "That is, speaking among ourselves as brother
crooks. Yes, I went in to see what I could get. I'm on the make
just as you are, though probably I'm not so well seasoned." He
nodded towards a bottle of whisky on the table. "Have a drink
and let's part on friendly terms. We'll leave one another
alone."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Edgerton threw back his
head and burst into a hearty laugh. "He's got us, Bert," he
exclaimed to his companion. "It's a grand slam! He's taken all
the tricks!" He turned back to Ramon and spoke seriously. "But I
say, young fellow, as one of the fraternity you'll have to help
us. Lend us &pound;20. Cards last evening and the races this afternoon
have cleaned us right out. We haven't even got enough to pay our
bill here."</p>

<p>"Lend you &pound;20!" exclaimed Ramon, inwardly most delighted at
the turn things had taken. "That's pretty cool, isn't it? I
should never get it back."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you would," said Edgerton, his face colouring
angrily. "We can raise plenty of money when we get back to town
and you won't lose a penny. We may pinch what we can from the
public, but we always play fair among ourselves." He shook his
head. "It's pretty evident you always work alone." He looked
curiously at Ramon. "But see here, young cockerel, you don't
make a regular living this way, do you? You've got some
occupation, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"In the city," nodded Ramon. He smiled. "But I'm always on
the look-out for easy money."</p>

<p>"And you're pretty smart at getting it, too," commented the
other dryly. "We watched you last night when old Major Hankey
dropped that fiver. We saw you put your foot on it and draw it
under your chair. Then you dropped your handkerchief and picked
it up. We didn't spoil sport. We only laughed, but it was that
which made us try to touch you just now. You looked easy
meat."</p>

<p>"I was," frowned Ramon. "I was a fool to think you'd leave
loose money in a suit-case and bleat about it to a perfect
stranger."</p>

<p>"Well, what about that &pound;20?" asked Edgerton. "You'll get it
back all right, as I've just told you." He took a small gold
cigarette-case out of his pocket and held it up. "Make it &pound;30
and you can hold this as security. It cost me fifty-five."</p>

<p>Ramon considered. "You've asked me personal questions," he
said, "then what about yourself? Do you make your living this
way, picking up things, I mean?"</p>

<p>"In any way we can," laughed Edgerton. "We're not
particular."</p>

<p>"Well, there's plenty of jewellery stuff about in this
Hydro," suggested Ramon, wondering if these men might be of any
use to him to get rid of the jewels in his money belt.</p>

<p>Edgerton shook his head. "Too risky to meddle with a place
like this. When I touch sparklers I get away quick and lively."
He smiled. "Besides, a lot that you see here may not be genuine.
For instance, the pearl necklace of that pretty little Mrs.
James I saw you staring at the other night I'd swear is not
worth more than a couple of tenners. Synthetic stuff, that's
what it is." He looked round at his companion. "We were caught
that way once, weren't we, Bert? Yes, badly caught. Went to a
lot of risk and expense to get a string and then found fifteen
quid was all they were worth. No, we stick to cards in places
like this."</p>

<p>"And yet you say you lost last night!" remarked Ramon.</p>

<p>Edgerton nodded. "Bad luck. Poker's our strong suit, but
there happens to be no one here who'll play. So we've had to
fall back on bridge and my friend here is damned rotten at it.
We had a simple easy code between us and yet he let me down
every time."</p>

<p>"We had bad cards all the evening," frowned Warden, "and I
only made a few mistakes."</p>

<p>"You made half a dozen, my son," frowned back Edgerton, "and
they were catastrophic." An idea seemed to strike him and he
looked hard at Ramon. "Some of the men were saying last night
that you're a very good player."</p>

<p>"Pretty good," nodded Ramon carelessly. "At any rate, two
years running I've been in the final in the annual tournament of
a club I belong to, and apart from that, bridge is a hobby of
mine. I once paid three guineas for an hour's lesson from
Ronaldson. He was quite complimentary to me."</p>

<p>Edgerton whistled. "You're keen enough, are you, to have gone
to Ronaldson? Whew, and I fancy myself as almost as good as
anyone!" He spoke with animation. "Now you listen. I've got an
idea. Last night we dropped more than &pound;70 to old Williamson. You
know him, the old chap with beady eyes and that big ugly nose. I
saw you speaking to him this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, he borrowed my newspaper," nodded Ramon.</p>

<p>"Just like him, the miserly old devil! He's Williamson here,
but he's Ebenezer Levi in the city. He's a money-lender, of
course. Well, he's booked to give us our revenge this evening,
but I was going to cry off. Now you shall take Warden's place,
and with our simple little code we'll skin him."</p>

<p>"But he mayn't be willing," frowned Ramon.</p>

<p>"He will be," asserted Edgerton confidently. "He's as greedy
as they make them. He doesn't think much of our play,
particularly after last night, and I don't wonder. Yes, he'll
take us on all right, and we'll manage it this way. At the last
moment, just when Warden and I are going to sit down, Warden
shall say he doesn't feel quite up to a game to-night. So we'll
look round for a fourth man to take his place. You will be
standing close by. Let him ask you if we can manage it. It'll
look better. If not, I will. Now are you agreeable?"</p>

<p>Ramon hesitated a long moment. "What's this code you talk
about?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very simple. I'll teach it to you in ten minutes and then
we'll always know just what each other's hands are. You agree!
Then all right. But you'll have to finance me. Better hand over
&pound;30. With any luck I'll pay you all back to-night."</p>

<p>Ramon regarded him intently. He certainly looked a most
likeable fellow, capable, good-natured and, strangely enough,
one who would keep his word. Edgerton sensed what was in Ramon's
mind. "Honour among thieves," he laughed merrily. "It's quite
true in my case. I never let down a pal, do I, Bert?"</p>

<p>Warden shook his head. "He's all right. He'll play fair with
you and so will I"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"now we know exactly
what we three are."</p>

<p>Ramon handed over the money.</p>

<p>It was an unforgettable evening for Ramon. They took down old
Williamson and his friend heavily, each of the two losing just
over &pound;75. The code worked well, though certainly they were
helped by unusually good cards. Edgerton played faultlessly and
Ramon backed him up well. It was no walk-over, however, for both
the money-lender and his friend were good players and gave
nothing away. Their faces were a study of baulked cupidity when
they had to pay up.</p>

<p>"Damn it, we're leaving to-morrow," scowled Williamson, "or
we'd get it all back. You had all the run of the cards."</p>

<p>Up in Ramon's room, over a last drink, Edgerton paid back the
&pound;30 and Ramon's last doubt about him was dissipated. The next
day he ventured to show him the companion diamond to the one he
had disposed of in Paris for &pound;110. "It belonged to my mother,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"Of course it did!" smiled Edgerton. "In my day I've sold a
lot of stuff which I said belonged to relations. All the same,
I'm sure the buyers didn't believe me."</p>

<p>He examined the diamond carefully. "A very good stone," was
his verdict, "and, to buy, it would cost anything up to &pound;200.
Still, selling where no questions were asked you'd be lucky if
you got &pound;70."</p>

<p>"And if you sold it openly to a jeweller?" asked Ramon.</p>

<p>"If you dared to, that might get you &pound;20 or &pound;30 more. Still,
it would be a risk with a diamond of that size. You would be
astonished how the Hatton Garden merchants can recognise almost
every big stone which has passed through their hands years and
years afterwards."</p>

<p>Ramon was in his twenty-eighth year when he met Edgerton and
from that hour his whole life was altered and he passed at once
into the ranks of the swell mob, that dangerous crowd who in all
countries gives the authorities so much trouble. Educated men
with all outward signs of respectability, they move in good-class
society circles upon whose members they prey. Their
activities come often under the notice of the police, but their
personalities are hidden and they flit like shadows through the
criminal world.</p>

<p>Edgerton introduced Ramon into several good-class clubs and,
playing warily, they made good money in the card-rooms, only
very occasionally, however, attempting to bring off a big thing,
and then only when they had most carefully selected their
victims. Edgerton could stack a pack of cards with the best of
sharpers and, when dealing, give himself or his partners aces
with the ability of a professional conjurer. He taught Ramon all
he knew, and the latter, most capable with his hands, was an apt
pupil, indeed in time quite equalling if not excelling the skill
of his teacher.</p>

<p>Young Warden played a minor but very useful part in their
adventures, his chief role being to get them introduced into
wealthy circles. His father was the Honourable Lionel Warden, a
most estimable old gentleman, always willing to be agreeable to
his son's friends, with never the faintest idea, however, what
sort of people those friends really were. Ostensibly, Warden
helped Edgerton in his wine and spirit agency in Leadenhall
Street, but the business was nearly wholly in the hands of a
manager who just made things pay.</p>

<p>Ramon had realised his dream and set up as an outside
stockbroker, making quite a good thing of it and in time far
more than paying his way. For all that, appetite growing with
eating, his main interest in life was the adventure of making
money in unlawful ways. The partners had not a few successful
robberies to their credit, precious stones and small portable
<i>objets d'art</i> being their speciality, with their methods
of acquirement, broadly speaking, always running on similar
lines.</p>

<p>They favoured the country houses of wealthy people. One or
other of them, never more than one at a time, would be staying
as a guest there, and spy out the land. Before concluding his
visit he would make possible the entry to be made later by
tampering with the fastenings of some door or window, the
favourite way being filing the threads of the screws as Ramon
had done in his first venture, so that they had a poor hold in
the wood and would push out easily. Then, with as little delay
as possible, the house would be broken into.</p>

<p>Both Edgerton and Ramon had plenty of courage, but the former
was dead against all forms of violence. Ramon, however, of a
much more brutal temperament, had no such scruples and there had
been a fierce quarrel once when he used a knuckle-duster with
fatal effect upon a lodge-keeper who was trying to stop them as
they were motoring away.</p>

<p>"But don't you realise that lifts the burglary on to a new
plane," had stormed Edgerton, "and brings the homicide squad
upon us. We're wanted now on the capital charge."</p>

<p>"And we'll remain wanted," said Ramon coolly. "They'll never
catch us. They've not got the ghost of a clue."</p>

<p>"But it means, too," went on Edgerton angrily, "that
everything we get is dead money to us. It'll be years almost
before I dare approach any fence to get rid of the stuff. It's
one thing to handle the proceeds of a simple burglary, but quite
a different one when a murder's been tacked on to it. I've
always told you that violence is against all my rules of
life."</p>

<p>Ultimately, the quarrel was patched up, but Ramon was not
altogether sorry when, a few months later, both Edgerton and
Warden were drowned when upon a holiday and boating off the
Cornish coast. Edgerton had been a strong swimmer and could have
got to shore easily, but staying behind to help his companion,
who was an indifferent one, had been too much for him and they
had both been lost.</p>

<p>Ramon knew all the ropes now and, though his discreditable
activities at cards were considerably curtailed for lack of a
cheating partner, was not altogether sorry they were gone, as
now no one was alive who knew he was wanted for murder.</p>

<p>Deep in the toils, however, of the excitement of pitting
himself against the authorities and with unlawful adventures
become the obsession of his life, as time went on he realised
the difficulties in working all alone and so looked about for
another partner. Ultimately he found one in Joseph Douro, the
proprietor of a flash night-club. Becoming friendly together,
they had soon sized each other up and come to a thorough
understanding.</p>

<p>Douro, in some ways, was as unscrupulous as anyone could have
wished and, well educated and with charming manners and address,
would have passed anywhere as a gentleman. Of Spanish
extraction, he had been the manager of a fashionable hotel in
Buenos Aires, but, becoming involved in a fight where a man had
been knifed and subsequently died, he had had to fly the country
as quickly as he could. A man of courage, and a great gambler,
in some ways he was a man very much after Ramon's own heart.</p>

<p>They had worked together for a time and then Douro had
introduced a third partner to work with them. He was Braddock by
name, a civil engineer by profession, a Bachelor of Science.
Ramon had not at first altogether liked his association with
them, as, though educated and well-spoken, his appearance was
not too prepossessing. He looked too much on the surface what he
was, a hard and tough customer of a bad type.</p>

<p>The two partners, however, had wanted him badly at the time,
as they were intending to bring off a good scoop in a city
warehouse where a safe had had to be opened. The robbery had
been quite successful, and as the new recruit had handled the
night-watchman so roughly that he died of his injuries the next
day, Ramon had become somewhat reconciled to him, as the man had
now every reason to hold his tongue. Later, too, upon several
occasions he was most helpful to them. When Ramon was thirty-four
he was in good circumstances and, in the city, was making
quite all he really needed. He rented a luxurious flat in South
Kensington and a bungalow on the Norfolk Broads where he spent
most of the generous holidays and week-ends he gave himself. He
attended nearly all the race meetings in the vicinity of town
and occasionally owned a jumper himself.</p>

<p>He was not married and, indeed, generally speaking, was not
much interested in the other sex. The great majority of them he
thought weak, and he had no time for weakness of any kind.
Certainly he had had a few affairs, but they had been only of a
passing nature, and he had soon tired. With the entree into some
of the best circles and good-looking and of undoubtedly
distinguished appearance, he could have married well had he
wanted to, but it was the chase and not the quarry which
appealed to him. He told himself he would never take any woman
'for keeps'.</p>

<p>One morning he was seated at breakfast in his flat, reading
the morning newspaper, and that he was intensely interested in
it was evidenced by his allowing his breakfast to get cold. He
was reading about the burglary of two nights back at Bentham
Hall in Norfolk. Apparently, it had been a thorough job, not
carried out, however, without a tragedy, as old Jevons, the Hall
butler, had met his death when, presumably, attempting to defend
his master's property. He had been struck two savage blows on
the head, either of which would have killed him, and had been
found the next morning, cold and stiff, close by the rifled
cases which had contained Sir Jeremy Rollison's treasures.</p>

<p>Sir Jeremy had been robbed, not only of almost all his
valuable silver, but also of a dozen and more of priceless
medieval manuscripts. The burglars had left behind no clues
whatsoever and it appeared the police had little chance of
catching them.</p>

<p>Ramon smiled to himself. No, the police had certainly no
chance! It was as good a job as he had ever engineered and,
except for the unexpected appearance of the butler, had been
carried out without a hitch. He had been a guest at the Hall the
previous week and had thoroughly prepared the ground. He had
made certain where everyone slept, where everything was kept,
and he had seen to it that the getting in would be perfectly
easy.</p>

<p>He frowned to himself when he thought of the butler. "But I
had to silence him and make certain, too, that he was dead," he
muttered. "I had no choice, for as he stood gaping at us he must
have heard that fool Douro call me Ramon. Certainly he wouldn't
have been able to recognise me then, but the name would have
struck him and he'd have remembered it afterwards. It's such a
damned uncommon name."</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. "The only regret I have in having done
it is now that those two will know they have a hold on me. I
wouldn't stake my life that if Douro were in a hole he wouldn't
turn on me, and, faced with a hanging, Braddock, too, might show
the yellow streak."</p>

<p>He smiled, an evil smile on his handsome face. "Well,
Edgerton and Warden were drowned when out boating, and so why
not, if it became necessary, Douro and Braddock? I could take
them for a sail and anything might happen. I know Douro can't
swim."</p>

<p>Finishing his breakfast and entering his study, he took the
stolen manuscripts, whose loss Sir Jeremy was so grieving about,
out of a drawer and proceeded to go carefully through one of
them. He knew nothing about old manuscripts and it had been only
an afterthought which had made him snatch them up. It had struck
him that anything Sir Jeremy collected must be of some
value.</p>

<p>Going through them carelessly the previous evening, he had
suddenly become most interested in this particular one, scenting
the possibility of making, with any luck, a great profit out of
it.</p>

<p>This particular manuscript, in quaint old English characters
and rather troublesome to read, had been written in the year
fifteen hundred and fifty seven and dealt with the spoliation of
the monasteries by "Ye Renegade King, Henry ye Eighth of
England", and it told of a priest, one Father Francesco, who had
been instrumental in preventing "muche golde and treasure" from
falling into the wicked king's hands. It related how one night
this Father had set out from the Benedictine Abbey in Bury St.
Edmunds and with a packhorse, heavily laden with the treasure,
and how from that hour no man had heard anything more of him or
of what he had been carrying away. It was known that, rather
than the gold and gloriously bejewelled sacramental vessels
falling into the hands of the evil king, he had vowed they
should be interred for ever with him in some unknown and
nameless grave.</p>

<p>Ramon was so greatly interested because he was sure that, by
a strange freak of chance, he knew where Francesco had died and
been buried. Giosue Carducci, the Italian poet, had been one of
his mother's grandfathers, and through him there had come down
to her, as a family heirloom, a Catholic breviary many hundreds
of years old. Ramon had often seen the prayer book, and on the
fly-leaf was inscribed, in sprawling and scarcely decipherable
characters, "Francesco, ye humble servante of God and ye great
Cardinal Wolsey, St. Cyprian's, Norfolk. Anno Domini 1549."</p>

<p>Ramon was thrilled at the idea of discovering where the
priest had been buried. If he turned out to be the same
Francesco who had outwitted King Henry VIII all those hundreds
of years ago, and the date certainly made it look like it, then,
perhaps, at his request, all this gold stuff had been buried
with him. St. Cyprian's was undoubtedly a church or religious
house of some kind and, being in Norfolk, should not be hard to
locate. He nodded to himself. He would say nothing to Douro or
Braddock about it.</p>

<p>A little later, on his way up to the city, he called in at a
public library in Knightsbridge to consult a Clerical Directory
and was very disappointed he could find no mention of a church
called St. Cyprian's. Then he suddenly remembered with much
uneasiness the many churches in East Anglia which, during the
last hundred years, had been overwhelmed by the encroachment of
the sea. Norwich would be where, he told himself, he would learn
all about them.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the following Friday, going down to his bungalow
on the Broads for a long week-end, he called in at Norwich, and
was referred at once to the library of a Norwich museum, being
told he could there learn all he wanted to know about the old
churches of East Anglia.</p>

<p>At the museum he was informed they had a book which they
believed covered all the churches and religious houses which had
ever existed, in both Norfolk and Suffolk, but, as it was old
and very valuable, it was not generally open to the public.
However, if he gave them his card, with the consent of the head
librarian, he would probably be allowed to examine the book,
though, of course, he would not be allowed to take it out of the
room.</p>

<p>So Ramon sent in his card and, after filling in a form, was
taken into the manuscript room and passed over to its sole
occupant, a young girl typing upon a desk in the corner. With
all his usual indifference to the other sex, Ramon could not
help noticing how pretty she was. She proceeded to attend to him
at once and from a glass case produced a thick and heavy book
and laid it carefully upon a small table. Pulling up a chair, he
sat down and proceeded to go through it.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it being very old. Its pages were
yellow and stained and the print small and hard to read. It had
no index. With his impatient nature, he sighed heavily at the
task before him, but at once started to go through it, scanning
down the pages as quickly as he could, making sure, however, he
would not miss what he wanted. It was a long business and nearly
a whole hour had passed before he came upon a record of the
Church of St. Cyprian. To his great disappointment, he read it
had been burnt down during the reign of James I in 1610. It had
been situated on the coast, near the village of Blackstone in
Norfolk. Then followed its history and a long description of its
architecture. Much of the detail was technical and Ramon did not
understand it. For all that, he realised, it would be most
valuable if any search were made in the ruins for the burial
place of that Father Francesco. As the one-time chaplain to the
great Cardinal Wolsey, he felt sure his importance would have
been such that he had been interred in the vaults below the
church and not in any churchyard.</p>

<p>He was thinking he would have to laboriously copy everything
down when, happening to glance round, he saw the young woman had
left the desk and was, apparently, no longer in the room.</p>

<p>Always a man of quick decisions, as quick as lightning, he
took out his pen-knife and with deft strokes, but, with all his
haste, made with great care, proceeded to cut the entire page
from the book. He had just finished when he heard what sounded
like a deep sigh behind him, and, springing to his feet and
turning swiftly round, to his consternation saw the girl whom he
had thought had left the room standing within three paces of
him. She was staring at him with lips parted and widely-opened
eyes.</p>

<p>In a flash he realised what had happened. She had not left
the room, but only moved from her desk, and, the colour of her
dress harmonising with that of the wall, he had not noticed her
when he had given his quick look round.</p>

<p>For a long moment the two stood staring at each other, both
speechless in their surprise. Ramon, however, recovered first
and, with hands he could feel were unsteady, snatched out his
wallet and abstracted from it two &pound;5 notes. He held them out
towards her.</p>

<p>The girl gave them a quick glance and then looked back to
him. She made no movement to take the notes.</p>

<p>Ramon realised that things looked very awkward. He had been
caught red-handed and there was no possible excuse that he could
make. The girl had only to raise her voice and help would
immediately be forthcoming from the adjoining room. He smiled
ruefully at the truly terrible position he was in. Then, to his
unbounded relief, the girl smiled too. She reached for the notes
and, crushing them in her hand, returned unconcernedly to her
desk.</p>

<p>Ramon thrust the page into his pocket, picked up his hat and
with a deep bow, and a smiling nod of thanks to the girl, turned
quickly round and proceeded to leave the room.</p>

<p>Neither had spoken a word, and it had been all over in less
than a minute. Thus was Ramon Ellister's first meeting with
Agatha Wandsworth.</p>

<p>He was glad to be out in the street again. "Gad, that was a
tight corner," he muttered, "and for a few moments it looked
devilish awkward! What a careless fool I was not to see she was
still in the room! But what a sensible girl she is and what a
pretty one, too! Now if ever I'm idiot enough to marry, she'd be
the kind of woman I'd choose."</p>

<p>The next morning he motored along the coast road towards
Blackstone, but came upon no ruins of any church. He called in
at the village inn to have a drink and make enquiries.</p>

<p>"But if you came along the coast road, sir," said the
landlord, "you must have passed it. It's about three-quarters of
a mile from here, just behind a low squat-looking house. There's
not much of the church standing, but what's left is right behind
the house. Part of the old church wall is the back wall of the
house."</p>

<p>Ramon remembered passing the house. "Anyone living there?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Professor Mildmay. He's very clever, though
peculiar in a lot of his ways. He lives there all alone and
writes books."</p>

<p>"No servant?" queried Ramon.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Binks, sir, from the village here. She goes up every
morning for some hours, and there's a jobbing gardener and
handyman once a week."</p>

<p>"The house looks very old," said Ramon.</p>

<p>"It is old, sir. I've heard tell more than a hundred years.
Folks say it was built for smugglers and that's why there's a
little window in a sort of loft above the front door. The
smugglers used to flash a light there. Some years ago this
professor bought the entire place for, I think, &pound;1,000."</p>

<p>Ramon was now so sure he was on a good thing that he resolved
to buy the house and make his investigations at his leisure.
Motoring back slowly past the house, he picked out the remains
of two of the church pillars, now overgrown with ivy. He was
half minded to call at once upon this eccentric professor and
ask him to sell. However, he told himself he must not appear too
eager and so would phone him in a casual sort of way.</p>

<p>Accordingly, that afternoon he got speech with the professor
and, saying he was an artist and had taken a sudden fancy to the
place, offered to buy it for &pound;1,200. The professor replied
politely enough that the house was not for sale, but, for all
that, Ramon suggested he should think the offer over. On the
Monday Ramon rang up from town, now raising his offer to &pound;1,500.
The professor again refused, this time rather irritably.
Finally, a few days later Ramon rang up for the third time and
stated he was prepared to give &pound;2,000. The professor was now
downright angry and, repeating he would not sell at any price,
ordered him sharply not to annoy him by ringing up any more.</p>

<p>"All right," snarled Ramon when he had hung up the receiver,
"I'll get at you, you little devil, in another way," and that
night, realising it was going to be no one-man job, reluctantly
took Douro and Braddock into his confidence. He explained
everything and showed them the prayer book which he had borrowed
from his mother.</p>

<p>"And this is going to be no potty &pound;100 business," he told
them, "far more likely it'll run into fifty or a hundred
thousand pounds. The monasteries had tremendous treasures in
those days and what that monk went off with is certain to have
been buried with him in the vaults. And it shouldn't be
difficult to get at, either, as, once being a smuggler's house,
there's almost sure to be a secret way down from it into what
was once the burial place below the church. So, we'll mark down
this damned professor straightaway and find out what'll be the
best way to deal with him. We're not going to be put off,
whatever we have to do. It may turn out to be the best job we
have handled."</p>

<h2><a if="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE HOUSE ON THE SHORE.</h2>

<p class="first">"MR. LAROSE, I am being watched," said the
small scholarly-looking man with the high forehead. "I live
alone in a lonely house on a lonely shore and I do not know what
it means. I am concerned about what is going to happen
next."</p>

<p>Gilbert Larose, a one-time international detective, had had a
meteoric career when attached to the Criminal Investigation
Department of Scotland Yard, rising to a chief inspectorship in
his thirtieth year. Now for six years happily married to the
wealthy widow of Sir Charles Ardane, he had left the C.I.D. and
was living at Carmel Abbey in Norfolk. Still on the right side
of forty, he was a good-looking man with a bright, humorous face
and very shrewd blue eyes. Notwithstanding his life as a country
gentleman, he was still interested in all matters connected with
his old calling and strangers often brought their difficulties
and mysteries to him. Just now he was contemplatively regarding
the card a visitor had just handed to him; "Professor Mildmay,
The Gap House, Blackstone, Norfolk." Underneath was pencilled,
"F.R.S., M.D., F.R.C.P."</p>

<p>It was one beautiful morning in late spring, and the two men
were seated in the library of the Abbey. Larose looked up and
surveyed his visitor intently. "Are you still in practice,
Professor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the other quickly, "I gave up practice five
and twenty years ago to accept the Chair of Anthropology at
Cambridge University and occupied it up to eight years ago. Then
I retired to devote almost my whole time to private study. I
have been living by myself at Blackstone Gap ever since."</p>

<p>"Then how are you being watched?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The professor frowned. "Strangers are continually coming to
stare up at the house and I have even caught them taking
photographs of it, back and front and both sides. Men stop for
quite a long time to look over the low garden wall at my
flowers, and, though except at the height of summer the shore is
not much frequented, lately, whenever I move even a few hundred
yards from the house, it always seems someone is about."</p>

<p>Larose was inclined to think his visitor was a crank, and
smiled indulgently. "But about the flowers, Professor," he said,
"nearly everyone likes nice flowers and surely it would not be
unnatural for passers-by to stop to admire them?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but mine are not nice flowers," exclaimed the professor
quickly. "They are just ordinary common ones and the garden is
badly kept. Apart from that, some of the people who of late have
stopped to look over the wall are not of the type, particularly
one of them, who would be interested in flowers." He smiled in
his turn. "Now, don't think I've got a bee in my bonnet, for I
haven't. Long before I started to make the evolution of man as a
social animal my life study, I had a good grounding in
criminology; I was for three years a doctor in a prison." He
nodded emphatically. "And I tell you that one of these gentlemen
whom I have seen several times looking over my wall, to an
expert such as I am, is of a criminal type, a most
unpleasant-looking fellow."</p>

<p>Larose was now inclined to somewhat modify his opinion as to
his visitor's crankiness and asked interestedly, "And how long
has this watching, as you call it, been going on?"</p>

<p>"For about a fortnight," replied the professor, "and, as I
say, the puzzle is I don't know where it is going to end. Why
should any strangers have become so suddenly interested in me
and my flowers and my house?" He shook his head vexatiously.
"But there, I haven't put things before you in their proper
order. There has been more than watching going on."</p>

<p>"Oh, more than just looking at your flowers?" exclaimed
Larose.</p>

<p>The professor nodded. "Yes, much more; and one thing, to my
thinking, has a decidedly sinister aspect. A woman&mdash;but
I'll start right at the very beginning." He considered for a few
moments and then went on. "About a month ago&mdash;- I think it
was April the eighth, to be exact&mdash;a man rang me to know if
he could buy The Gap House. He said he understood I had paid
only &pound;1,000 for it, but, as he had taken a great fancy to the
place, he was prepared to give me &pound;1,500. I turned the offer
down at once, and told him the house wasn't for sale. As a
matter of fact I couldn't have sold it if I had wanted to, as it
belongs to a cousin of mine and I only rent it from him."</p>

<p>"Did this man give his name?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, he gave no name. He only stated he was an artist. Though
I gave him no encouragement, he wouldn't take my refusal as
final and asked me to think it over. Two days later he rang me
up again, now raising his offer to &pound;2,000. I was quite rude to
him and, refusing emphatically, cut the conversation short."</p>

<p>"And then the watching commenced almost at once?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>The professor nodded. "Soon afterwards!" He lowered his voice
mysteriously. "And then a most singular happening occurred." He
smiled. "You see, Mr. Larose, I may be considered eccentric, if
peace and no disturbance to my work are eccentricity. My house
is not a small one, but I have never liked anyone living inside
with me. So, all these seven years I have had a daily woman
coming up from the village, about three-quarters of a mile away.
Her hours were from nine to two. She cleaned that part of the
house I use and saw to my midday meal. After that I saw nothing
of her until the next day. I have had the same woman with me all
the time."</p>

<p>"And you've left her now in charge of the house, while you
have come to see me?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "No, I was going on to tell you
she is no longer with me. She has become so crippled with
rheumatism that she will never be fit for work again. A jobbing
gardener and handy man from the same village, whom I have
occasionally employed for some years and whom I can trust
thoroughly, is on guard to-day. I have not as yet filled the
woman's place. Well, as I found I could not get another local
woman, I realised, however much I disliked the idea, that I
should have to engage an all-time housekeeper who would live in.
So last Friday I advertised in the <i>Norwich Courier</i> for
one."</p>

<p>The professor's face here took on a grim look as he
continued. "Then on the Sunday morning a candidate for the
situation arrived on a bicycle and I interviewed her in the
hall." He frowned heavily. "I didn't allow her to come any
farther into the house, as one look at her was sufficient. I
would never have dreamed of employing her. She was a gaunt,
strong-looking woman, whose face at once seemed somehow vaguely
familiar to me. I didn't like the look of her and thought her a
criminal type. She was hard, with furtive eyes set close
together, her forehead was receding and her facial angle bad."
He scowled. "God, I wouldn't have had her in the house for a
single night! She looked just the kind to cut my throat if I
offended her."</p>

<p>Larose was amused at the professor's vehemence. "And you sent
her packing?" he said.</p>

<p>"At once! I told her the situation was already filled and
tried to get rid of her as quickly as possible, but she was
persistent and actually started to argue with me. She spoke in a
husky whisper and said she did not mind how small the salary
was, as all she wanted was a quiet life. She was a widow and had
lost her husband under tragic circumstances; he had been run
over by a motor lorry before her very eyes, and she wanted to
get away from streets and towns and try to forget it. Yes, I
tell you she was persistent, but I managed to get rid of her at
last and to close the door."</p>

<p>He took an envelope out of his pocket and went on
impressively. "Then, when she was reluctantly going down the
little path of my front garden, she went very slowly and kept
turning round to stare at the house. I was watching her from the
window of my room and saw her eyes roam all round the roof,
exactly as if she were looking to see where she could get up. It
happened I had my camera on the table&mdash;I am quite a good
amateur photographer, and had had it out to shoot a big gull
which had been sitting on the low wall&mdash;and I grabbed it up
and, at one of her turnings round, got a good snap of her." He
took an unmounted photograph out of his envelope and held it out
to Larose. "Tell me what you think of it? My camera is an
expensive one and I got it with a telescopic lens. See how
beautifully her face comes out?"</p>

<p>"Hum," remarked Larose thoughtfully, "certainly not a nice
face and it does rather suggest a criminal type!"</p>

<p>"But don't you notice something unusual about her
altogether?" asked the professor excitedly. "Doesn't anything
strike you? It did me the moment I had got the print."</p>

<p>Larose looked at the photograph very hard and then frowned.
"I would almost say," he said slowly, "she was a man and not a
woman. She has a pronounced masculine look
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" cried the professor exultantly. "And she
<i>was</i> a man! I saw her yesterday when I was in Norwich,
coming out of the Royal Hotel, and it gave me a great shock
because I recognised her instantly. I knew, too, why her face,
as I said, was vaguely familiar to me when she called. She was
the unpleasant-looking man whom I had seen several times staring
over the garden wall at my flowers."</p>

<p>"Did he see you looking at him in Norwich?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes; but fortunately not before I had had time to hide my
astonishment. Oh, yes, he recognised me right enough, for his
mouth gaped and for a few seconds he looked horribly
embarrassed. Then he turned his back to me as quickly as he
could and swung off up the street."</p>

<p>"What kind of fellow did he look?" asked Larose. "I mean was
he in working clothes or well-dressed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well-dressed," nodded the professor, "and so were the
two men who were with him! It was so funny. He almost dragged
them away with him, and as they went along, one on either side
of him, from their intent sideways looks at him I am sure he was
explaining to them the reason for his haste."</p>

<p>"This was only yesterday, you say?" said Larose.</p>

<p>The professor nodded again. "Yes, only yesterday, and that's
what's made me come to you so quickly. It was the climax of
everything." He looked very troubled. "Now, Mr. Larose, what
does it all mean, this persisting in trying to buy my house,
this coming to spy round and the sending of that man, dressed as
a woman, to get taken on as housekeeper? I ask you, what does it
all mean?"</p>

<p>Larose's interest was now thoroughly aroused. "It means they
want something that's in the house," he said gravely. "There's
no doubt about that. And it means, too, they're not going to be
easily put off from trying to get it." He spoke sharply. "Tell
me, is there anything peculiar about your house?"</p>

<p>The professor made a grimace. "I suppose some people would
say there was. At any rate, it is built on the site where there
was once a church, and it is known it was used by smugglers,
generations ago."</p>

<p>"On the site of a church!" exclaimed Larose. "Then what
became of the church?"</p>

<p>"It was burnt down right to the ground," replied the
professor, "more than three hundred years ago. There are only
two broken pillars standing, and part of a wall which forms the
back wall of my house."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" exclaimed Larose animatedly. "Then, of course, it
looks as if these men think there is something of value among
the ruins and that's why they want the house! They believe,
perhaps, they've found out some important secret."</p>

<p>"There is only one secret which could be found out,"
commented the professor a little testily, "and that"&mdash;he
spoke most impressively&mdash;"is known only to two living
persons, my cousin and myself."</p>

<p>"And may I ask what the secret is," smiled Larose, "or don't
you want to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell you," said the professor readily, "if only
because I've come to you as a sort of Father Confessor." He
hesitated a moment and then dropped his voice to a whisper. "The
secret is that there is a way down from my house into what were
once the vaults of this church."</p>

<p>"And you imagine no one but you and your cousin know it?"
asked Larose rather incredulously.</p>

<p>"I'm certain of it," replied the professor, "because of what
I found in the vaults when I went down. There was all evidence
no one had been there for more than eighty years." He smiled
gleefully. "What do you think I discovered? Why, five ten-gallon
casks of French brandy! Never been tapped! Just as they were
when they had been brought there!"</p>

<p>"By Jove," laughed Larose, "that was a find!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And of course the casks had been left by the smugglers.
There was a sort of account book there, too, all sere and yellow
with age, and I could just make out the last entry had been made
in November 1846. Now isn't that proof no one has been there
since?"</p>

<p>"It certainly does look like it," agreed Larose; "but how do
you account for the kegs having been forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Quite simply!" nodded the professor. "All the
smugglers&mdash;of course they were the local
fishermen&mdash;had been drowned in a fearful storm which swept
round the Norfolk coast at the end of November in that year. I
read about it in <i>The Chronicles of East Anglia.</i> It said
the storm came up so suddenly that the menfolk of many little
fishing villages were entirely wiped out. Indeed, that month the
sea so encroached upon Blackstone Sands that all the little
houses below the Gap, close to my house, had to be abandoned.
For generations now there has been no trace left of any of the
habitations."</p>

<p>"Most interesting!" exclaimed Larose. "And you say you've
lived in this house for eight years! Then who owned it before
you came there?"</p>

<p>"A clergyman from Norwich who had had it for more than thirty
years and used it only as a holiday house. When he died it was
put up for auction and my cousin was the only bidder. He bid
&pound;800, but ultimately took it and the adjoining land for &pound;1,000.
The whole site upon which the church once stood&mdash;it was
called St. Cyprian's&mdash;belongs to him. Besides the two
broken pillars, there are several big mounds of half-buried
masonry lying about, drifted over by the sand and covered with
tussocks of coarse sea-grass."</p>

<p>"Are there any fishermen near you now?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "No, not one, and the nearest
inhabited dwelling to me is a small coast-guard station a little
more than half a mile away. That's the only inhabited house I
can see from my house. Everywhere else is shut away from view by
the cliffs and the rise of the land behind me."</p>

<p>"It must be very lonely for you," remarked Larose.</p>

<p>"It is, and though I'm anything but a timid man, I can't help
feeling a little uneasy at the position I am in. Now, what do
you advise me to do, Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"For one thing," smiled Larose, "buy a pistol if you haven't
already got one and keep it always handy." His face became
grave. "But I really don't know what advice to give you, except
that you certainly ought not to go on living alone. There ought
to be another man with you, and then this gang&mdash;for of
course it is some kind of gang you're up against&mdash;would
think twice before interfering with you." He shrugged his
shoulders. "Otherwise I'm afraid they'll go on doing something.
They seem so determined."</p>

<p>"That's what I think," nodded the professor, "and what
troubles me quite a lot is that they're not needy men with no
resources behind them. They appear to be well supplied with
money, and, besides that, they don't look common, uneducated
men. That one who was trying to pose to me as a woman, though
unpleasant-looking and, to trained observers such as you and me,
of a criminal type, with ordinary people might pass as a
gentleman of sorts. The two others, too, I saw with him in
Norwich, from the fleeting glance I got of them, might be
professional men."</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Larose. "And from the educated classes have
always sprung the most dangerous criminals!" A short silence
followed and then the professor said earnestly, "Look here, sir,
couldn't you come and have a look at the place? It'd give you an
idea of how lonely and unprotected I am. It isn't far, only just
over thirty miles from here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I certainly will," replied Larose. "You've interested
me and I'd like to help you in any way I can." He frowned. "But
I'm sorry I can't come to-day. I'm presiding at a public meeting
this afternoon, and I shan't be free until nearly five
o'clock."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you come after then," urged the professor. His
face brightened. "What about stopping the night? I can put you
up quite comfortably and there'll be a good meal, at any rate
some cold fowl and ham, and, with a bit of luck, a lobster." He
smiled in some amusement. "And don't forget there'll be some of
that old brandy to sample, too."</p>

<p>"A-ah, that settles it," laughed Larose. "I know whereabouts
the Gap is and I'll be with you about six o'clock."</p>

<p>It was, however, nearly seven before he turned off into the
narrow road leading down to the Gap, and, when eventually coming
in sight of what he knew must be the professor's house, he
frowned heavily. "Gad," he exclaimed, "but what a lonely place!
It needs some pluck to go on living here alone with all this
mystery about!"</p>

<p>The squat-looking rambling house of one storey was situated
on a low cliff between two much higher ones. Its little garden
ran almost to the cliff's edge and was enclosed with a wall
about four feet high. When Larose was only about two hundred
yards away he suddenly heard firing, four shots ringing out in
quick succession.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" he swore, speeding up his car quickly. "The
devilry's already started and I may have come just too
late!"</p>

<p>Tearing down the road which led to the back of the house, he
was, however, greatly relieved to see the professor himself,
interestedly regarding a good-sized tin which he had just taken
off the wall.</p>

<p>"Ah, so you've come at last!" exclaimed the professor in some
relief. "It's getting so late that I was beginning to be afraid
you'd altered your mind."</p>

<p>"No, I was delayed," said Larose. "But what was all that
shooting?"</p>

<p>The professor laughed happily. "Me! I bought a little pistol,
as you advised me, at Fakenham on my way home, and I was trying
it out to see how it went. I haven't fired one before." He made
a grimace. "It appears I'm not much of a shot, as I've missed
this old tin every time, and I wasn't far away either."</p>

<p>Larose garaged his car, in a big, roomy stable and the
professor proceeded to show him round. "But don't go too near
the cliff," he warned, "as it is always crumbling away. At high
water the waves break right up on it, and there's a strong
undercurrent which would drag you out to sea in no time. When
the sea's rough even a good swimmer would stand a poor
chance."</p>

<p>He pointed out to him the big heaps of fallen masonry and the
two crumbling pillars which were all that remained upright.
"See," he said, "it must have been quite a big and important
church in its time. Still, that's nothing, as you know, for East
Anglia. There are a good number of ruined churches round the
coast and scores more have been lost by the encroachment of the
sea. Do all the authorities can, this coast is still being
gradually devoured as it has been for many hundreds of
years."</p>

<p>"You've never poked about under those heaps of masonry, I
suppose?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "No, I haven't been interested
enough." He nodded. "But when those walls fell I think their
impact must have made a crack somewhere in the roof of those
vaults underneath, for fresh air gets in somehow. I can't find
out where, but I must be right, because the air there is never
foul."</p>

<p>Larose took in everything all round. "You're lonely right
enough," he said, "but as long as the phone wires are intact
you're not quite cut off from the world." He looked at him with
a grim smile. "If ever you find your line dead at night, then be
prepared for trouble and have that pistol handy. Don't forget to
keep it always with a full magazine."</p>

<p>They went into the house and the professor was evidently very
proud of his possessions. "See the oak panelling," he said.
"Isn't it splendid? All the wood inside is probably as good as
the day it was put up. Look at the thickness of the walls, too.
No damp gets in anywhere."</p>

<p>Larose nodded in appreciation. "And what a massive front
door! It'd take some breaking down!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm all safe when I'm locked in," laughed the
professor. "There are iron shutters to every window in the
house. Now for our little meal; but I'll light the lamp first.
It's getting dark so early and there'll be a big storm soon,
from the look of the sky."</p>

<p>Over the meal, and the old brandy, which Larose pronounced in
absolute good faith as being as fine as any he had ever tasted,
the professor explained how he had come to find the way down
into the vaults. "One of those panels over there in the wall
near the fireplace slides back," he said. "I only found it out
just before last Christmas, and it was almost accidentally." He
smiled. "Still, observation and deduction came in, too. If you
remember we had some very cold nights last year, colder than I
ever remember, or at any rate I felt them more, so I moved this
table to where it is now, nearer to the fireplace. Then I
noticed that sometimes when I struck a match the flame often
bent slightly in a certain direction. It was a long while before
I took it in and then it dawned upon me there was a slight
draught coming from somewhere."</p>

<p>"Always?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, only sometimes, and gradually I began to associate it
with a strong wind blowing from the east. So one night, just out
of curiosity, nothing more, for the draught was so slight it did
not annoy me, I decided to find out where the draught came from.
I struck match after match by the panelling and at last found
where they flickered most. It was always at the junction of two
particular panels. I pushed and shoved and, finally, forced the
blade of a thin knife between the panels. Then, suddenly, hey
presto! one of the panels moved, and I was able to slide it
aside. You can imagine my amazement when I saw a big, gaping
hole with the top of a ladder showing over the edge. But come on
now, I'll take you down after I've lit the hurricane
lantern."</p>

<p>He slid back the panel. "I will go down first and show a
light below. The ladder's quite safe. It's of thick, solid oak
and in good condition."</p>

<p>Descending the ladder, Larose found himself in a long, wide
chamber, about seven feet in height, and with its far end lost
in the shadows. Big, massive-looking stone flags formed the
floor, and all around the walls were broad stone shelves. There
was the strong, heavy smell of decaying masonry, but the air was
not foul or damp. There was nothing movable in the chamber
except the kegs of brandy.</p>

<p>The professor swung the lantern round. "I expect there were
lots of coffins upon those shelves once," he said, "but the
smugglers must have made a clean sweep of them when they came
down." He pointed to a corner. "That's evidently where the door
was which led up into the church. See the blackened end of the
big oak beam sticking out from the blocking masonry? So it's
pretty certain that when the roof of the burning church crashed
down it brought that beam with it, which makes it quite sure no
one has been down here from outside since the day of the
fire."</p>

<p>"It looks like it," agreed Larose. He tapped the pavement
with his foot and pointed to the faint lettering upon some of
the flags. "But there must be a lot of coffins underneath. Can
you make out any of the names?"</p>

<p>"Only on one," replied the professor, "and they have puzzled
me a lot. Come over here." He placed the lantern on the ground,
and indicated a flag close by. "Look, if you get the light
right, you can pick out some of the words quite clearly." He
traced upon the flag with his finger.</p>

<p>"See&mdash;some words you can't read and then you can make
out quite plainly, 'Francesco, ye Humble Servante of God'. After
that something-something, and then comes 'Thomas Wolsey. In ye
Year of Our Lorde 1551'."</p>

<p>"The great Cardinal Wolsey!" exclaimed Larose. "That's a
find, isn't it? Fancy him being buried here! By Jove, perhaps
that's what these men are after, the cardinal buried with his
jewelled mitre and a lot of valuable things!"</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "But that can't be! That's all
wrong! Cardinal Wolsey was buried in the Abbey at Leicester.
I've looked up my history to make sure. Besides, he didn't die
in 1551. It was in 1530, long before Henry VIII, who was
probably going to behead him. Henry died seventeen years after,
in 1547." He laughed. "I've tried to get my cousin to come down
and look at these additions to his property. He lives in
Penzance and won't make the long journey, chiefly, I think,
because he's a golf maniac and almost lives only for the game.
Not even the brandy would tempt him down. He's a retired naval
man, Commodore Smith, and a bachelor like myself."</p>

<p>Larose was still looking at the flag with 'Thomas Wolsey' cut
into it. He frowned as if very puzzled. "But is it likely," he
asked, "that an untrue inscription would have been put on that
stone? What on earth would it have been done for"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"unless there were two Thomas
Wolseys?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think that," said the professor, "and I tell you
it's puzzled me quite a lot. Frankly, I don't pretend to
understand it."</p>

<p>Returning up into the house and closing the secret panel, the
professor went on briskly, "Well, what do you make of it all,
Mr. Larose? What's the verdict? To my thinking it's nothing in
those vaults they're after. It's something in this house they
want, or otherwise they wouldn't have tried to plant that
woman-man here as my housekeeper."</p>

<p>"But if that's so," asked Larose, "why should they have been
taking photographs, as you say they did, of the outside of the
house and particularly of the back part where there's only that
thick wall? No, no, as I take it, it is something they believe
is hidden in the vaults they're after, and their main interest
in the house is because it has been built upon what was part of
the church. They took those photographs to estimate from the
general picture they got over exactly what part it stands."</p>

<p>"But how would it help them in any way," frowned back the
professor, "to have a confederate here in my house?"</p>

<p>"Because, having satisfied themselves that the vaults do lie
underneath the house, they suspect&mdash;what you know for
certain&mdash;that there is a way here of getting down to
them."</p>

<p>"But why should they suspect that at all?" argued the
professor. "We know for certain that no one has suspected it for
at least eighty years, and why should they be thinking of it
now?"</p>

<p>"Probably," laughed Larose, "because their wits have been
sharpened by something they believe they have learnt about what
is hidden in those vaults. They have been put on the alert and,
making enquiries about this house, what is more likely than that
they have learnt it was used by smugglers once? Then wouldn't it
follow, too, that if the smugglers hadn't discovered a way down
they would have made one?"</p>

<p>The professor sighed. "I suppose so. At any rate, as you put
it, it all sounds feasible." He made a wry face. "Well, what do
you suggest I do now?"</p>

<p>"Sit tight," replied Larose, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll sit tight," burst in the professor. "I'm not a
coward and I won't give in to anyone. I'll shoot them down like
dogs if they come interfering with me. I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"And get a man here to live with you," said Larose, "at any
rate for a time."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking all to-day that I ought to do that," said
the professor, "and I intend to write to that cousin of mine,
straightaway. He's lived an adventurous life and is as tough as
blazes, so that if I pitch it hot and strong that there's real
danger here, that something is threatening me, I half think
he'll pack his trunks and, golf or no golf, come right away. At
any rate I'm going to try to get him. He's ten years younger
than I am and will stand no nonsense from anyone."</p>

<p>"That's it," laughed Larose, "That's the very kind of man you
want. Mention my name and tell him I think the matter's serious.
Tell him, too, that I'm sure it would be worth his while to see
if there's anything of value in those vaults."</p>

<p>They talked on upon all kinds of subjects until late in the
night, with Larose finding the professor a most interesting
companion. The latter was a man of wide reading and had
travelled in many parts of the world. Physically, with all his
sixty-three years, he was full of energy, and there was no doubt
about his courage, too. He was game as a pebble and, in a way,
quite thrilled about the mystery in which he was now
involved.</p>

<p>In parting next morning, Larose said he would be seeing him
again very shortly. He was motoring up to town that morning and
did not quite know when he would be back. When in town, he
promised he would look up an archaeologist friend he had at the
British Museum and try to find out something about the church
over part of which the house had been built.</p>

<p>"And I'll ask him about this Francesco," he concluded, "and
what is his explanation, too, of Cardinal Wolsey's name being on
that tombstone. As well as being an archaeologist he's a well-known
historian and I may find out quite a lot from him. Of
course, I'll bind him to secrecy about the whole business."</p>

<p>It happened, however, that Larose did not get back home as
soon as he had been expecting and it was just a week when he
returned to Carmel Abbey. Then, rather to his anxiety, he learnt
that the professor had rung for him several times, leaving the
message that he wanted to see him as soon as possible, as the
matter was urgent.</p>

<p>He went at once to the phone and was somewhat relieved when
he heard the professor's voice in answer. "Yes," exclaimed the
latter eagerly, "I want to see you very badly. I can't say what
for over the phone, but the matter's really urgent."</p>

<p>"Will it wait until to-morrow?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Well, if you possibly could, I'd rather you came
straightaway, and, when you hear what I've got to tell you, I'm
sure you won't think me unreasonable. That cousin of mine
arrived only an hour ago, and he says I must try and get you to
come at once."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose, "I'll start as soon as I possibly
can, but there are a few little matters I must attend to
first."</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he drove up to the house by
the Gap and he found the professor and his cousin in the garden.
There was an air of subdued excitement about them both. He was
introduced to the commodore and liked his appearance at once. In
the middle fifties, he was of much stouter build than his
cousin, and, with big fearless blue eyes and a strong,
determined face, he looked all over, as his cousin had said, a
man who would be afraid of nothing.</p>

<p>"I've heard of you, Mr. Larose," he smiled grimly, "and
you're just the chap we want. My cousin here thinks he has got
himself in a bit of a mess. I think he has, too. He's always so
hasty and impetuous."</p>

<p>"In a bit of a mess!" exclaimed Larose, very surprised. "Then
what have you done, Professor?"</p>

<p>The professor gave a wry smile. "I've shot one of those men,
the one who came up here dressed as a woman. I shot him six days
ago, the night after you were here."</p>

<p>"Did you hurt him much?" asked Larose frowningly.</p>

<p>"Hurt him!" exclaimed the professor rather uncomfortably.
"Why, I killed him! I shot him in the back of the head as he was
running away."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Larose, "I've not heard anything about
it! How do the police take it?"</p>

<p>The professor laughed nervously. "They don't know. I hadn't
told anyone about it until I told my cousin this afternoon and
now I'm telling you."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Larose again. "But what have you done
with the body?"</p>

<p>"Buried it. Buried the next night but one. I couldn't wait
any longer, until I'd heard from you. I had to act on my own. I
buried it deep in the sand by one of those heaps of masonry.
It's a good five feet down and the grave was easy to dig. You
can't see any signs now that the sand has been disturbed."</p>

<p>For the moment Larose was altogether too flabbergasted to
make any comment, but the commodore remarked with a grin,
"Little devil, isn't he? I wouldn't have thought he'd got it in
him." He made a motion towards the house. "But let's go inside
and he'll tell you the whole story. It was like a sheep turning
on a pack of wolves, as funny as anything I've ever heard."</p>

<p>With them all seated in his study, the professor proceeded to
tell Larose what had happened, and he told it crisply and
quickly, without wasting a word.</p>

<p>He said that about half-past ten on the night after Larose
had stayed with him he heard a sudden knocking on the front
door. It had startled him, but he had taken no notice, thinking
that whoever was knocking, getting no answer, would go away.
However, the knocking had continued and so he had gone into the
passage and called out to know who it was and what they wanted.
A man had shouted back that he had lost his way. He had told him
to take either the path or the road at the back, as either would
take him to the village. Then the man had said he had hurt his
leg, but he, the professor, had replied he couldn't help that
and added he never opened the door to anyone at night. But the
man wouldn't go away and continued banging and kicking at the
door for quite a long time before he stopped.</p>

<p>The professor nodded significantly. "With my ear close to the
crack of the door, though I couldn't hear what was said, I could
hear talking. So I knew there was more than one man there and I
realised the matter was serious, particularly so, as, trying to
ring up the exchange, I found the line was dead. Nothing
happened for about five minutes and then, to my terror, I heard
a heavy thudding on the back door and in a flash realised what
they were doing. They had lifted up one of the big lumps of
masonry lying about and were using it as a battering-ram to
break in."</p>

<p>"A damned rotten situation," commented the commodore to
Larose, "and I don't wonder he began to feel uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Uncomfortable!" exclaimed the professor. "Why, I was almost
scared to death, for I knew that if I didn't do something at
once they would get in. Then it crashed into my mind that attack
was often the best defence and so, holding my little pistol
before me, I opened the front door very quietly and crept round
the side of the house to the back."</p>

<p>"Good man!" nodded his cousin. He patted the professor on the
back. "You were a gallant little fellow and I'm proud of
you."</p>

<p>"I must tell you here," went on the professor, "that, though
there was a bit of a moon out, it was a boisterous, gusty night,
and clouds kept scudding over, making everything pitch-black.
Turning the corner of the house, I saw three men by the back
door. I was only just in time to catch sight of them before a
cloud passed over. They were on the point of giving another
heave with their battering-ram when I gave a fearful yell and
let go three bullets, one after the other, as quickly as I
could."</p>

<p>"Did you aim directly at them?" asked Larose frowningly.</p>

<p>"Sure! I had forgotten all my fright and was just boiling
over with rage. Yes, I aimed straight at them, but knew the next
morning that I'd missed them all when I found three bullet holes
in the side of the big shed behind them. Still, it put the wind
up them and they dropped the battering-ram like a red-hot coal
and started to bolt off for the garden wall. Then the moon went
in and I couldn't see them any more."</p>

<p>The professor sighed heavily here. "Then what followed just
shows what chance can do. Aiming straight at them, I had missed
them all, but firing two more shots, quite at random because it
was then pitch-dark, I must have hit one of them just before he
got to the wall."</p>

<p>"Did he cry out?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Not a sound," replied the professor. "I didn't know I'd hit
him. I went back into the house and there was no more trouble
during the night. The next morning I went outside the moment it
got light enough, to see where they had cut the telephone wires
and if I could mend them." He nodded significantly.</p>

<p>"But I found they hadn't cut them at all, just crossed them
over and made a short circuit"&mdash;he looked very
grave&mdash;"which can only mean things were going to be made
very unpleasant for me. It looks as if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell him," broke in the commodore, "it meant that they
were going to occupy the house. It wasn't just a tip-and-run
raid. They were going to stop here and didn't want the chance of
any telephone men coming because it was found out there was a
fault in the line." He shrugged his shoulders. "What they were
going to do with Eric no one can say, but as he found a
hypodermic syringe and some knock-out tablets of Evipan Sodium
in the dead man's pockets, it looks as if they were not going to
be too nice to him. But there, I'm spoiling the story. Go on,
Eric."</p>

<p>"One moment," frowned Larose. "How was it none of all this
noise and shooting was heard? I should have thought the men at
the coastguard station would have heard something. They're
always on the watch."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the wind was in the wrong direction," explained the
professor, "and I've told you it was a gusty night." He went on.
"Well, I put the wires right and was just about to return
indoors when among the tall sea-grass I caught sight of the body
of a man lying close to the foot of the wall. Imagine my horror,
for, from the blood on the ground, I saw his death had been a
violent one, and I realised instantly it must have been I who
had killed him. He was lying on his side. I had a clear view of
his face and I recognised him at once."</p>

<p>The professor smiled nervously. "I was seized with panic. My
only thought was to hide him. There was not a soul in sight and,
grabbing the body by the heels, I dragged it into the woodshed
and closed it and padlocked the door. Then I came in here to
think what I should do."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ring up the police immediately?" asked Larose
with a frown. "You had every excuse for what you had done."</p>

<p>"But I thought I hadn't," choked the professor. "I had shot
him in the back of the head and that meant he had been running
away and not attacking me. So, instead of the police, I rang you
up. They told me you were away, but I was hoping all day you
would return and I wanted you to tell me what I must do."</p>

<p>"I should have told you instantly," said Larose sharply, "to
get in touch with the authorities. Heaven knows, I'm not an
undue stickler for what is called 'Law and Order', but when
anyone has taken life, either accidentally or, as in your case,
on the urge of self-defence, he ought to put himself under the
protection of the law at once." He spoke testily. "Just realise
your position now. You may easily be landed into dreadful
trouble, for an anonymous letter to the police and they'll be
round here straightaway to make enquiries. These men must know
you've killed their companion and hidden his body
somewhere."</p>

<p>"But they don't know that," retorted the professor hotly.
"I'm sure they believe he fell over the cliff and got drowned. I
am certain that's their idea, for the next morning at low tide
there were two men searching along the shore and, for ever so
long, among those rocks about a mile away. I looked at them
through my glasses, which, unhappily, are not very strong ones.
Still, I could see they had got their hats pulled down low over
their faces, just as if they were not intending me to see what
they were like if I were watching."</p>

<p>"Was the tide high that night when they were trying to break
in?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Right up to the very cliff," replied the professor, "and a
fierce wind, blowing straight onshore, was piling up tremendous
seas down below. You must understand, Mr. Larose, it was by the
path along the cliff they all tried to escape and on a dark
night it would have been a terribly dangerous way to go."</p>

<p>"It strikes me," said the commodore, "that, while the
blackguards at first might have been uncertain as to what had
happened to their companion, now they must be quite certain he
got drowned. If my cousin had shot him they would, of course,
have been expecting to read all about it in the newspapers.
There would have been an inquest and no end of fuss."</p>

<p>"And it was that fuss I didn't want," went on the professor
warmly. "By then I had got over my first fright and was furious
at the thought of being exposed to a horrible publicity. The
newspapers would have been full of what had happened, and I
should have been badgered with endless questions and probably
severely censured for having shot the fellow when he was running
away." He held up his hand warningly. "Besides, if those two men
learnt I had killed their companion, I could never have gone on
living here in peace. There would always have been the thought
in my mind that they would be coming one day for their
revenge."</p>

<p>"He's quite right there," nodded the commodore. "They're
professional criminals, those men, and they'd stick at nothing."
He turned to his cousin. "Show Mr. Larose what else you found in
the dead man's pocket besides that hypodermic syringe."</p>

<p>The professor pulled open a drawer in his desk and pulled out
a little collection tied up in a big handkerchief. "The syringe
and bottle of drug," he pointed out, "a little case of tools, &pound;6
15s. in money, a silver cigarette case, a bunch of skeleton
keys, and"&mdash;his eyes sparkled&mdash;"a nice hefty
knuckle-duster!"</p>

<p>Larose regarded the articles frowningly. "Were there no
papers on him," he asked, "no letters of any kind to give an
idea who he was?"</p>

<p>"Not a single one. I went through him very thoroughly. There
was no tag on any of his clothes and no laundry marks, either.
He was certainly not a working-man, as his hands were not
calloused or rough and his nails were nicely trimmed. He was
wearing a gold signet ring. I didn't take it off."</p>

<p>"But why did you bury him?" asked Larose with some
irritation. "If you were going to get rid of the body, and as
one man to another I don't altogether blame you, why on earth
didn't you throw it in the sea? With the sea at your very
door!"</p>

<p>The professor shook his head. "No good! No good at all! It
wasn't practical! The sea was dead calm then and didn't come up
to the cliff. Besides that, they were beautiful moonlight nights
and it was any odds on the coast-guards seeing me lugging the
body down across the sands."</p>

<p>"And another thing," said his cousin. "If he had got the body
into the sea&mdash;even if it had drifted some distance
away&mdash;it was sure to have been washed up later and then
there would have been the same anxiety for him, with the gang
learning their pal had been shot and wanting to get their
revenge." He looked curiously at Larose. "But it's just come to
me, sir, that my cousin telling you all this puts you in a very
awkward position. As a one-time worker with the Criminal
Investigation Department and now, as I understand, a local
magistrate here, you may feel it your duty not to keep
silent."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I shan't say anything," he frowned.
"Certainly it would be awkward for me if I believed what the
professor has told us, but"&mdash;he half smiled&mdash;"it is
altogether such an extraordinary story that anyone would pardon
me for taking it to be a dream." He nodded to the professor.
"Yes, my dear sir, you've dreamt it all."</p>

<p>"Dreamt it!" exclaimed the professor, his eyes blazing. "Do
you mean to say you don't believe it's true?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Larose. "You've had a bad dream. That's
been your trouble!"</p>

<p>"But damnation," almost roared the professor, "what about
this knuckle-duster here, this hypodermic syringe, these
skeleton keys and all these other things?"</p>

<p>Larose turned his head away. "I don't see any knuckle-duster
or skeleton keys. I don't see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," laughed the commodore, "that's the idea! Mr. Larose
thinks you've dreamt it all, Eric, and so his conscience is
quite clear. He'll be as mum as we intend to be."</p>

<p>The professor saw the joke at last and joined in the
laughter. "Well, what do you advise now, Mr. Larose," he asked,
"that I do about this dream of mine?"</p>

<p>"You dreamt you buried him quite effectively?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Quite! I rolled him in a piece of tarpaulin first and tied
it at both ends. It's quite possible he may mummify as the sand
was so very dry."</p>

<p>Larose considered. "Well, as his friends certainly won't dare
to talk, though of course the whole business is most unlawful, I
should say you are pretty safe. Later on, perhaps, say in six
months' time, you might have another dream and dig up the bones
and throw them a good way out to sea." He looked at the
commodore. "How long are you going to stop here, because I don't
think those men will have finished with this house yet? When
they get over their fright they'll be coming back."</p>

<p>"So I think," agreed the commodore, "unless"&mdash;he paused
impressively&mdash;"I find what they think is here first and
broadcast it all about. That'd stop them." He nodded. "At any
rate I shall be remaining here until I'm sure Eric will be quite
safe." He laughed. "And you're a fine detective, aren't you?
I've been down into the vaults and guessed at once what that
flag with Thomas Wolsey on it meant."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you?" exclaimed Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, it doesn't mean that he is buried there, but only that
Francesco, who was 'Ye Humble Servante of God' and whose grave
the stone covers, had had something to do with the cardinal
during his life. Probably the words we can't make out are
something like 'and ye faithfull friende of'. Do you follow
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," laughed Larose, "and you're undoubtedly quite
right. My friend at the British Museum showed me a book on the
life of Cardinal Wolsey and it mentioned a Father Francesco as
being his chaplain and intimate friend. After the cardinal died
this Francesco was badly wanted by King Henry VIII for having
bolted away with some monastery vessels of great value. They
never got either him or them."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the commodore gleefully. "Then it looks
promising for something good being hidden in these vaults
here!"</p>

<p>"My friend told me something else, too," went on Larose,
"which makes it certain that it's a gang of crooks who want to
get into this house." He paused impressively for a few moments.
"What do you think I learnt? Why, that one of the things those
burglars took when they broke into Bentham Hall the month before
last and murdered the butler there was a priceless old
manuscript dealing with this very same Father Francesco and the
treasures he'd got away with." He shrugged his shoulders.
"Except how they came to learn Francesco was buried here,
everything's as clear as daylight. The burglars who've been
coming here are the same gang that visited Bentham Hall."</p>

<p>The two cousins were most interested and then the professor
exclaimed suddenly, "Oh, that reminds me! I'd forgotten to show
you something most important." He fished in a pigeon-hole in his
desk and brought out a sheet of crumpled and faded paper. "This
is what I picked up close to where the body had lain. I had gone
back later to trample out any stains of blood. It's a page which
has been cut out of a book and it's all about St. Cyprian's
Church."</p>

<p>Larose took the page from him. "Yes, and it's from a very old
book, too," was the comment. "Now I wonder if this was stolen
from Bentham Hall, too! I should say it was certainly stolen
from somewhere, for surely no one would mutilate his own book by
cutting out a page. Let me have it, will you, and I'll show it
to my friend at the British Museum. At any rate he should be
able to say from what book it's come."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he was carrying it on him," said the commodore, "so
that when they were here on the spot they could consult it to
give them a good idea as to where exactly the vaults were." He
spoke in business-like tones. "Now to-morrow, or the day after,
I shall go into Norwich and buy some tools to lift up that flag.
It looks like being a tough job and I shall want a crowbar and a
pick-axe."</p>

<p>Larose got up to go. "Well, I wish you both good luck, and be
sure and let me know if anything happens. One final warning.
Take care of yourselves. Most certainly those wretches haven't
finished with this house yet."</p>

<p>"I'm budgeting for that," laughed the commodore, "and we
shall be ready for anything. Eric's got his pistol and I've got
a revolver almost big enough to bring down an elephant.
Good-bye! We'll be ringing up in a few days."</p>

<p>In the meantime both Ramon and Douro were most uneasy in
their minds. As both the professor and his cousin had surmised,
they were thinking it certain that Braddock had fallen over the
cliff and been drowned.</p>

<p>That night, after the attempted raid upon the professor's
house, they had got safely back to their car, parked in a small
lane about half a mile away, and then had waited impatiently for
the appearance of Braddock. They had thought he would have been
just behind them. A quarter of an hour, however, passing with no
sign of him, they had become anxious and, finally, with great
reluctance, had retraced their steps to find him.</p>

<p>The moon had remained hidden and, not daring to flash their
torches, they had had to make their way back by the light of
those stars which were not covered over. With each step they
took farther along the cliff path they became the more
apprehensive that Braddock must have fallen over. They were
certain he had not been hit by any bullet from the professor's
pistol, as, they told themselves, they had both seen him running
behind them long after the last shot had been fired and when
they were all over the garden wall and quite a distance from the
house. They had both looked back to see if he were following and
had caught sight of him.</p>

<p>Here, however, they were mistaken. They had both glanced back
almost at the same moment and in the dim and uncertain light it
had been a small tree they had seen and not their companion.
Braddock was then finished with and lying dead among the tall
sea-grass.</p>

<p>Coming again within sight of the garden wall, they realised
all further search was hopeless. Peering cautiously over the
edge of the cliff, they saw the fierce waves thundering down
below and were convinced there was no chance now of Braddock
being alive. So they returned to the car and drove away.</p>

<p>"Gad!" exclaimed Douro. "Now what's going to happen?"</p>

<p>"We're quite safe," replied Ramon coolly. "We've no cause to
worry. No one can have anything on us." He scowled. "It's damned
annoying, but, except that we've lost Braddock, in the end
to-night's business may turn out quite all right for us. That
little devil will certainly have been scared and may now give up
the house."</p>

<p>Douro laughed. "You're a callous brute, aren't you, Ramon?
You never did like Braddock."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," replied Ramon. "The fellow looked too much
like what he was and, as our friend, might have made people
suspicious of us. Besides, lately he's been very surly and rude
to me."</p>

<p>Returning to Ramon's bungalow to pass the rest of the night,
the two men put themselves frowningly to bed. It was, however, a
long while before Ramon dropped off to sleep, as it had suddenly
flashed into his mind that they might not be as safe as he had
so confidently made out.</p>

<p>For one thing, Braddock, as the practical man and best fitted
by his training to judge the easiest way of getting into the
vaults, had been entrusted with the page Ramon had stolen from
the Norwich Museum and he, Ramon knew, had had it on him at the
moment of his disappearance. Then, it was just possible if his
body were washed up, the page being a most unusual one, the
police might trace it back to where it had come from, and Ramon
remembered with a most uneasy pang the visiting card he had sent
into the head librarian of the museum. Gad, it would be
remembered he had recently had access to the old book and they
would suspect him at once!</p>

<p>Soon after it was light he went into Douro's room. "Here,
I've just thought of something," he said sharply. "If they find
Braddock's body and there is anything on it to identify him it
may turn out devilish awkward for us. You know he always carried
that knuckle-duster on him and he'd got that hypodermic syringe,
too."</p>

<p>Douro looked surprised. "But they can't in any way connect
him up with us, if they do find out who he is."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't they?" scowled Ramon. "I think they can. What if
they examine his banking account? They'll trace us through the
cheques we have both paid him from time to time for his whack of
what we've all made. Why, you paid him a cheque for &pound;70-odd less
than a fortnight ago for what we took off that young fool
Glendenning at poker at your damned club!"</p>

<p>Douro looked uneasy. "But he's not likely to have had
anything on him that would let anyone identify him."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he? I'm not so sure about that. What if he'd been
carrying some letters, or what about some tailor's tabs on his
clothes? At any rate, it'll be low water about noon to-day and
we'd better go and look among those rocks about a mile from that
damned professor's house. That'd be the most likely place to
find the body if it's not been drawn right out to sea. We can
pretend to be looking for shells if anybody comes near."</p>

<p>Accordingly, at midday they put themselves to an arduous two
hours' tramp along the sands and among the rocks in the vicinity
of Blackstone Gap, making, however, later for town, irritable
and bad-tempered because they had met with no success.</p>

<p>In the ensuing week they went carefully through the
newspapers, and particularly those published in Norfolk and
Suffolk, for any news of any body having been washed up or for
any mention of the attack on Professor Mildmay's house. But they
came upon no record of either happening, and, to find out if
there were any tales going about, one afternoon Ramon motored
into Blackstone village and pulled up to have a drink at the
little inn.</p>

<p>He chatted for a good half-hour with the publican and, as the
latter was of the gossipy kind, was quite certain he would have
learnt something if there had been anything to learn. But no,
all the man talked about was the weather, the condition of the
roads and, to him, the most interesting case of a villager being
fined forty shillings for poaching two rabbits.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the following week they had become very
curious to learn what was happening at the professor's house.
Was he still there or had he gone away? Or had he got anyone
staying there to keep him company? Surely, after what had
happened that night, he couldn't have gone on leading his even,
monotonous life! It must have made some change somewhere, and
was that change likely to benefit them or not?</p>

<p>They were more certain than ever there was a fortune hidden
in the vaults as Ramon had bought a book on <i>The Spoliation of
the Monasteries</i> and had read how, amid all the disasters
which had overtaken religious buildings at the hands of King
Henry VIII, great treasure had nevertheless been secreted away
and escaped all discovery.</p>

<p>At last, on the Friday, they made up their minds to motor
over to near Blackstone Gap, leave their car in a byroad and go
boldly past the house. They might, of course, learn nothing,
but, on the other hand, if they saw the professor either
somewhere about the garden or, through the window, sitting at
his desk, they would know he was still living there.</p>

<p>Approaching the house along the cliff path, they heard the
sound of chopping and, coming to the wall, saw someone with his
back turned towards them and only a few feet off the path,
hacking at the root of a tree. As they drew near, evidently
hearing the noise of their approach, a man straightened himself
up sharply and turned to look at them. With no surprise, but a
little embarrassed, they saw it was the professor himself, who
proceeded to stare at them curiously and as if rather scared. He
was holding a small axe in his hand.</p>

<p>Annoyed at his having seen them so closely, they were
intending to walk by with a curt good-day, when suddenly the
scared expression of his face altered to one of intense anger.
"You're two of the men who've been watching my house," he
shouted. "What do you mean by it?" and dropping his axe, his
hand plunged into his pocket and he drew out his pistol.</p>

<p>Douro was the nearer to him and, striking out like lightning
with his walking-stick, knocked the weapon out of his hand.
Then, as the professor darted to retrieve it, Ramon grabbed up
the axe and with one vicious blow, almost clove his head in two.
They could hear the bone crack in.</p>

<p>"Oh, you fool, you damned fool," almost wailed Douro. "You've
killed him!"</p>

<p>"Well, I had to," panted Ramon. "It was him or us. We'd both
have been shot in the next few seconds if I hadn't. The old
fool's probably always been half mad." His gaze swept round on
every side. "It's all right. We've not been seen. Quick! You
look over the wall and see if there's anyone in the garden. I'll
drag the body over into the long grass."</p>

<p>Douro, seeing no one in the garden, jumped back to trample
out the stains of blood. Ramon, running up, helped him to make
sure. Both the men looked white and scared as, with not a
second's delay, they started to make their way back along the
cliff path.</p>

<p>"But no hurrying," ordered Ramon sharply. "Let's just walk as
if nothing had happened."</p>

<p>For a minute or two neither of them spoke, and then, when the
house was well behind them, Ramon drew in a deep breath. "Yes,
there's not a soul in sight. If we keep our heads we're quite
safe."</p>

<p>"You mean you are," scowled Douro sullenly. "It was not my
doing. I had no hand in it."</p>

<p>Ramon was now quite cool and collected. "Well, have it that
way if you like," he laughed. "Then I say I'm quite safe." He
nodded. "But it's a good thing he's dead. He'd recognised us and
there was definite danger. We should never have dared to come
near the place again. It would have been all up with us getting
into those vaults."</p>

<p>"But I'm not so sure it isn't all up now," growled Douro.
"What's going to happen when they find the body?"</p>

<p>"But they won't find it," said Ramon calmly, "for the moment
it gets dark I'll be back here to get it. I'll bury it somewhere
or sink it in the Broad. Then no one will ever know what's
become of the little devil. He mayn't even be missed for several
days, as it seems certain he's been going on living alone.
Probably he thought he'd frightened us off with that pistol." He
grinned. "I've got it in my pocket now and it'll be a nice
souvenir. It's a Weimer, a damned good little gun."</p>

<hr>

<p>That night Larose had just finished dinner when he was called
to the phone. "It's Smith speaking," came a hoarse voice. "I
want you to come at once&mdash;at once, do you
understand&mdash;without a moment's delay."</p>

<p>"Why, what's happened?" asked Larose, a little nettled at the
peremptory manner in which he was being addressed. "Is the
professor all right?"</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," said the commodore sharply.
"He's&mdash;&mdash;" But he stopped short and then went on in
quite a different tone. "Oh, do please come, Mr. Larose. It's
most urgent."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larose, asking no more questions. "I'll
come at once. I'll be with you in three-quarters of an
hour."</p>

<p>It was quite dark and beginning to spot with rain when he
arrived at the house by the Gap. The commodore was waiting for
him outside, with a lantern. Larose heard a dog barking in the
house.</p>

<p>"Good idea, that," said Larose as he jumped out of the car.
"So you've bought a dog, have you? Now what's happened?"</p>

<p>The commodore did not answer his question. "But I thought I
heard your car a good half-hour ago," he said sharply. "Did you
have to stop anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No, I came straight here. But what's up?"</p>

<p>The commodore steadied his voice. "Eric's dead. He was
murdered this afternoon when I was away. His body's among the
long grass just outside the wall."</p>

<p>"My God, my God!" exclaimed Larose. "How terrible! What an
awful thing! But what have you done? Have you rung up the
police?"</p>

<p>"I've done nothing," replied the commodore, "touched nothing,
moved nothing and just left everything for you to see."</p>

<p>"But how was he killed?" asked Larose hoarsely.</p>

<p>"With his own axe. I trod on it as I was bending over him. It
had been pushed just under the sand."</p>

<p>"But you've done nothing, you say?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No," snapped the commodore. "I thought you'd know best whom
to ring up to get a move on quickly."</p>

<p>"But the time wasted&mdash;&mdash;" exclaimed Larose
reprovingly. "The murderer might have been caught, or at least
noticed before he'd got far away."</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "Not he! It was too late. The
murder was done more than five hours ago. The glass of Eric's
wrist-watch was broken and the watch had stopped at ten minutes
to four. Come on, I'll take you to him."</p>

<p>With the lantern to light the way, they went through the
garden and round by the wall outside, for about a dozen yards.
The commodore held up the lantern and his voice choked as he
said, "Here he is! The dog found him! He must have died
instantaneously. His poor head&mdash;&mdash;" but suddenly he
stopped speaking, and with a lightning movement jerked up the
lantern as high as he could and swung it round. His voice rose
to a shout. "But he's gone!" he cried. "The body's gone!"</p>

<p>He darted forward a few yards and then darted back again.
"Someone's been and taken him," he cried. "Look where he's been
dragged away! Look at that furrow in the sand!" He swore
furiously. "And I was close by all the time and could have
caught them red-handed if I'd only known. The dog heard them and
started barking and I wondered why. Oh, what a chance I've
missed!"</p>

<p>"Steady, steady," said Larose, "let's keep our heads. When
did the dog start barking?"</p>

<p>"Just after I thought I heard a car. For the moment I
believed it was you and went and stood outside the back door.
Then I realised you couldn't have got here so quickly and went
back into the house."</p>

<p>"But what time was it then?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to nine," he replied. He held his wrist-watch
up to the lantern. "And now it's twenty minutes past."</p>

<p>"Forty minutes!" commented Larose. "And allowing about five
minutes for getting the body to the car, they've had a good
half-hour's start; time enough for them to have run to earth
quite safely."</p>

<p>The commodore had cooled down and was now quite calm. "We've
no chance, you think," he asked quickly, "of catching them if
the police get going at once?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, I've always thought they had a
place somewhere not very far from here, and by now they've
almost certainly disposed of the body. If they killed him, as
you say, all those hours ago, of course they would have made all
their preparations to hide it somewhere directly they had got it
away. But let's go inside and decide what we are going to do. We
must make our decision quickly, but as I look at it there's no
hurry now for a minute or two."</p>

<p>Once inside the house Larose heard the full story. In the
afternoon the commodore had driven into Norwich to get some
crow-bars and a pick-axe to lift up the flags in the vaults. He
had thought his cousin would be quite safe in daylight,
particularly so as he was always on the alert and always carried
his pistol with him. Returning home just after eight, he had
been very disturbed at not seeing him anywhere about. It was
then beginning to get dark. Half fearing the professor had had
an attack of faintness&mdash;he knew he was subject to
them&mdash;the Commodore had started to look everywhere. He
didn't think he would have found him if it had not been for the
fox-terrier he had happened to buy in Norwich. The dog had
started barking at something in the long grass, and to his
horror he had come upon the body. The head was all covered over
with congealed blood and he could see where the skull had been
crashed in. He had not touched the body but had run straight
back to the house and rung up Larose.</p>

<p>"And that's what you're going to tell the police?" asked
Larose. He spoke grimly. "But, now that the body has
disappeared, what proof have you to give them?"</p>

<p>"Proof!" exclaimed the commodore, looking most surprised.
"Why, they'll believe what I tell them!"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, they won't. The police believe
nothing without proof. They're always being told cock-and-bull
stories and are always on their guard against being hoaxed.
They'll come here, of course, and they'll keep everyone away
from where you say you last saw the body. They can't, however,
search all around until it gets light." He shrugged his
shoulders. "Then what if they find nothing to support your
story? What'll they think?"</p>

<p>"But the blood, man!" exclaimed the horrified commodore.
"They must see a lot of bloodstains about. The head will have
bled terribly."</p>

<p>"No," said Larose emphatically, "there may have been very
little blood spilt. If your cousin was killed instantaneously
the heart would have stopped pumping instantly too, and there
wouldn't be much blood about. Besides, how do you know the
murderer or murderers didn't clear up what blood there was
directly they had killed him? Remember, he wasn't likely to have
been killed in that out-of-the-way place where you found him.
His body was taken there afterwards until they could come and
fetch if after dark. He may have been struck down in the garden
here or&mdash;&mdash;" He held up his hand. "But hark, here
comes the rain in earnest, and it's good-bye now to any chance
the police had before of finding stains of blood."</p>

<p>The rain was pouring down in torrents and the commodore had
to raise his voice to be heard. "But, good God, man," he
exclaimed angrily, "we can't sit down and do nothing with poor
Eric murdered by those brutes! We must do something."</p>

<p>"Of course we must!" agreed Larose instantly. "We will do
something and we'll get those blackguards in the end, right
enough! I am only considering how best to set about it!" He went
on, "You see, Commodore, unhappily we can't show all our cards.
We can't put down all our hand before the police. Remember, we
have a devilish awkward secret to hide ourselves: the body of
that man your poor cousin buried under that sand at the back. We
can't go to the police and tell them everything, so that, body
or no body produced to back up your story, they will realise
there was a motive for your cousin being killed."</p>

<p>"You believe me, don't you?" scowled the commodore. "You
believe I saw him lying dead?"</p>

<p>Larose was emphatic. "Of course I do! I never doubted it for
a moment, but I want to work out the best plan for unmasking
those men, and it seems to me we have a better chance of getting
them if they don't learn we know the professor has been
murdered. They won't be so wary and will come out more into the
open." He nodded. "I'm trying to take a long view."</p>

<p>The commodore heaved a big sigh. "I'll do exactly what you
think best, Mr. Larose." He gritted his teeth together. "All
I'll live for now is vengeance. Now what do you propose?"</p>

<p>Larose considered. "Give out that your cousin has
disappeared. Ring up the police in the morning and say that you
think it is loss of memory. Advertise his description. Stay on
here until you have examined these vaults, as I suppose you're
still determined on that."</p>

<p>"By Jove, I am!" exclaimed the commodore. "If there's
anything there I'll find it, if only to prevent those
blackguards ever getting hold of it."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose. "And then, when you've either found
something or got tired of looking for it, sell the house."</p>

<p>"Sell the house," said the commodore. "Why sell it?"</p>

<p>Larose raised one hand significantly. "Because it is most
probable that whoever buys it will be the man responsible for
your cousin's death. Put it up for auction and I'll be there and
run it up pretty high before I let it go. That'll make the
eventual buyer stand out. Then I'll trail him as hard as I've
ever trailed anyone before, and depend upon it we shall find him
one of a gang. Oh, yes, don't forget, there'll be more to find
out about him than only this murder, more that will perhaps help
us to bring it home to him. I'm certain he and his gang will
turn out to be the killers and burglars at Bentham Hall. From
what your poor cousin found in that man's pockets there's not
the slightest doubt about their being habitual criminals."</p>

<p>"And if we find out where he lives," supplemented the
commodore, "it may point to where he's hidden my cousin's
body."</p>

<p>"Of course it may!" agreed Larose. "So many criminals are so
very clever up to a certain point, and then they are as stupid
as can be. In the long run they almost invariably make mistakes,
and if this fellow has a garden I wouldn't say that, perhaps, he
hasn't buried the body there."</p>

<p>The rain was continuing to pour down in torrents and with
very little pressing Larose was prevailed upon to stop the
night. Indeed he was the more willing to do so, for, as with all
strong temperaments, he could see how greatly the commodore was
suffering from the ordeal he had been through.</p>

<p>They talked on until past midnight, and desisted only then
because they knew that with the first streaks of daylight they
must be searching for any possible clues the murderer or
murderers might have left behind them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a if="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD.</h2>

<p class="first">THE reports in the newspapers and the broadcast
over the air that the well-known Professor Mildmay had
disappeared created some little stir in scientific circles, but
did not excite much interest with the general public. It was
mentioned that for eight years he had been living by himself in
a house belonging to a relation, by Blackstone Gap on a lonely
part of the coast of Norfolk, and now he was missing and no
trace of him could be found. His appearance was described and
the public were asked to communicate with the Norwich police at
once if they learnt anything of him.</p>

<p>Known to be eccentric in his habits, it was thought at first
that he must have lost his memory and wandered away, but, with a
few days passing and no news of him coming to hand, it began to
be surmised that he must have fallen over the cliffs and been
drowned. The cliffs in the vicinity of the Gap had an evil
reputation for their dangerous condition, as they were
continually falling away.</p>

<p>"There, what did I tell you?" exclaimed Ramon exultingly to
his partner. "Everything's gone as I thought it would, and
better still, because, as the house didn't belong to him, there
will be no tedious waiting for a presumption of his death. So
the chances are that, in a few weeks at the latest, the place
will be up for sale, and we can just hop in and make the search
at our leisure."</p>

<p>It followed that Ramon was quite correct in his surmise, as a
fortnight later advertisements appeared in the local newspapers
notifying that the house would be put up for auction at the
Norwich Exchange, in ten days' time, on the eighth of the next
month.</p>

<p>"And we'll get it for a song," nodded Ramon, "perhaps even
for seven or eight hundred! Who would want an ugly, rambling old
house like that in such an unfavourable situation? The very look
of it would be enough to put people off, as it so obviously
wants a lot doing to it to make it comfortable for ordinary
people."</p>

<p>In the meantime Commodore Smith had been busy, and busy, it
turned out, to some purpose. He had remained on at the Gap House
and, with an addition to the family of a fierce-looking bulldog,
been quite confident he would be able to deal with anyone who
came to molest him. He kept in touch with Larose on the
telephone, and almost daily talks passed between them, with both
of them very guarded in what they said.</p>

<p>One morning he rang up to say he would like to come over to
Carmel Abbey and, it being quite convenient for Larose, turned
up that same afternoon in his car.</p>

<p>"I've found it," he announced in great excitement, "and I've
brought it over for you to see. I have no idea what the things
are worth and there's not much of them, but they look pretty
valuable to me. Let me put the car into your garage and you can
look at them there. We mustn't run the slightest risk of the
servants noticing anything peculiar about my coming to you."</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was in the garage that the things he had
brought with him were displayed before Larose's astonished eyes:
a richly-jewelled gold chalice, a big gold paten, heavily
jewelled, too, four massive, good-sized gold candlesticks and
quite a number of jewels set in little gold plaques.</p>

<p>"Lord!" ejaculated Larose breathlessly. "Why, if those jewels
are real, they must be worth thousands and thousands!"</p>

<p>"Of course they're real!" said the commodore sharply. "Almost
certainly they're what the great cardinal used at his private
mass. I take it these little jewelled plaques came from his
mitre, the fabric of which has crumbled away."</p>

<p>"Where did you find them?" asked Larose in an awed whisper.
"In that Francesco's grave?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it took me a whole solid day to get up that flag
without chipping it, so that I could replace it and it would not
look as if it had been disturbed. The coffin, or what remained
of it, was four feet below the level of the earth. None of these
things had been apparently wrapped up but only just dispersed
round the body. The skeleton was all there, but of course the
bones were all separated."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed Larose. "And they've been there all
these hundreds of years!"</p>

<p>"There was no damp," said the commodore, "and the earth was
packed hard; so hard, indeed, that when I got to where the
coffin had been I found it had not caved in round the sides. The
skeleton and all these things were in a sort of cavity."</p>

<p>"You didn't leave anything?" asked Larose. "You're sure you
got all there was?"</p>

<p>The commodore nodded. "Quite certain! I searched most
thoroughly and when I packed back the earth there was nothing
under it"&mdash;he smiled a cold, grim smile and averted his
eyes&mdash;"Of what I'd come upon when I dug it up, except the
bones and the skull."</p>

<p>"And don't you think," asked Larose, "that it can be seen the
flagstone's been interfered with?"</p>

<p>The commodore was emphatic. "I'm sure it can't, and it fits
so closely into its bed that when those blackguards come to
start getting it up they'll have as much trouble as I had unless
they try to crack it with a sledge-hammer." He nodded. "I wish
them joy there, for it's at least ten inches thick."</p>

<p>"But they'll see the earth has been disturbed," said Larose.
"They're bound to notice that."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," laughed the commodore, "they'll tumble to things
then." He looked most amused. "Don't you worry, sir. When
they've had all the trouble of getting up that flagstone they'll
realise, right enough, someone's been there before them, and
quite recently, too."</p>

<p>"What a surprise!" laughed Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll be a surprise, right enough," agreed the
commodore. He smiled his cold, grim smile again. "Why, I'd give
a year's income to see their faces when they've got that earth
up! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Well, what about these beautiful things?" asked Larose.
"What are you going to do with them for the present?"</p>

<p>"I want you to take care of them!" said the commodore. "That
is, of course, if you don't mind. I've not got any safe."</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind," said Larose. He smiled. "I don't really
know who they belong to. I suppose they're treasure trove, and
if so you're entitled to half."</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't bother me," smiled back the commodore.
"I've got all the income I want. Still, we'll not say anything
about them for a while. I'll go into Norwich to-morrow and
arrange, as you suggest, for the house to be put up to auction.
I know a man and his wife who'll come in as caretakers until
it's sold, and I'll never be far away either."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose. "And I'll be at the sale and run the
bidding up. I'll run it up high enough to absolutely convince us
that the man who's buying it is the man we want. I mean that
he's not buying it as an ordinary dwelling but because he
believes it contains something worth any exorbitant price he is
compelled to pay."</p>

<p>"But mayn't you be recognised?" asked the commodore. "If it's
a gang, as we're sure it is, some of them may be old hands and
remember you at Scotland Yard! Then, seeing you had been so
interested in the house, wouldn't it make them rather on the
lookout for your making enquiries about them afterwards?"</p>

<p>"You're right," nodded Larose after a moment's thought. "As
you say, we can't afford to give away chances. So I'll go to the
sale a bit togged up." He smiled. "It'll be like old times."</p>

<p>The day of the sale arrived and, as several properties were
being offered that morning, there was a good attendance at the
Exchange. Commodore Smith was present and, not being able to
pick out among those gathered there anyone who looked at all
like Larose, was a little bit anxious lest something had
prevented his coming. However, when he felt a stoutish-looking
man, rather shabbily dressed and with a scrubby moustache and
swarthy complexion, softly but most deliberately digging him in
the ribs with his elbow several times, he felt more assured. The
man moved away directly the Gap House was put up for sale.</p>

<p>The auctioneer declaimed about the valuable property he was
now offering, its historical interest and romantic situation,
and asked someone to start the bidding at &pound;1,500.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed, then he suggested &pound;1,400; but it was
not until he had dropped to half that sum that he got any offer.
A woman, who, it was learnt afterwards, wanted the place as a
convalescent home for tubercular patients, bid &pound;700, whereupon a
Norwich publican went up &pound;50. The woman bid another &pound;50 and a
mild contest ensued between the two until the woman dropped it
when the publican had got to &pound;950.</p>

<p>The auctioneer seemed very hurt and, almost as if he were
taking it as a personal affront when no further offer appeared
to be forthcoming, expatiated again upon the desirability of the
house for anyone who wanted peace and quiet among romantic
surroundings. Another silence, however, followed, and then, just
when it seemed the hammer was going to fall to the benefit of
the publican, a well-dressed gentleman raised the bidding
&pound;25.</p>

<p>The publican countered at once with &pound;25 more, and then
followed a most business-like, ding-dong battle. The well-dressed
gentleman capped every bid the publican made, but the
latter, now very red in the face, was not easily to be shaken
off, and it was not until the bidding had reached &pound;1,400 that he
had been silenced.</p>

<p>The auctioneer picked up his hammer. "&pound;1,400 I'm bid!" he
called out, his eyes searching everywhere round and round. "Only
&pound;1,400 for this most desirable property! Any advance on &pound;1,400?"
He lifted the hammer, "Going, going"&mdash;but a guttural voice
broke in sharply in the clipped accents of a foreigner, "I beed
another tweenty-five."</p>

<p>Everyone looked round to see who it was. The stoutish,
shabby-looking man was holding up a rather dirty-looking
hand.</p>

<p>The auctioneer looked pleased and lowered his hammer.
"Fourteen hundred and twenty-five I'm bid! Ah, thank you,
sir"&mdash;he nodded in the direction of the well-dressed
man&mdash;"and fifty! Fourteen hundred and fifty I'm bid."</p>

<p>"And twenty-five," called out the foreigner.</p>

<p>"And twenty-five," called out the well-dressed man sharply,
not even giving the auctioneer time enough to look his way.</p>

<p>The latter smiled broadly and put down his hammer. His many
years of experience in his calling had taught him quite a lot
about human nature and he was sure now there was all the makings
of a spirited little contest in view. The last bidder was
rattled. He as frowning and, consequently, it was more than
probable he would cap any bid the other man made, simply in his
annoyance.</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred I'm bid!" he called out. "Fifteen hundred!"
He looked in the direction of the foreigner and was disappointed
there was no immediate response. Indeed, it was not until quite
a minute had passed and he had reluctantly picked up his hammer
again that the guttural voice was heard.</p>

<p>"And tweenty-five!" called out the foreigner.</p>

<p>"And twenty-five!" snapped Ramon, for the well-dressed man
was he.</p>

<p>Then followed, for those gathered there, quite an amusing and
entertaining five minutes. Excitement became keyed up, with most
interest, however, centred upon the foreigner, for, exactly the
opposite to Ramon, who instantly capped every bid which was
made, he was tantalisingly slow in his decisions and almost
every time it was not until the hammer was actually lifted that
he called, out his guttural 'Twenty-five'.</p>

<p>When the bidding had reached &pound;2,000 the auctioneer paused
and, taking in both the bidders with a quick glance, remarked
apologetically, "Now, I don't know either of you two gentlemen
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pay ze cash," called out the foreigner, tugging a fat
wallet out of his pocket and holding it up for everyone to
see.</p>

<p>"Certified cheque," nodded Ramon curtly. He made no attempt,
however, to produce it, as if quite confident his word, backed
by his appearance, would be enough.</p>

<p>The auctioneer appeared satisfied and went on with the sale.
The bidding proceeded on the same lines as before, with Ramon
quick and snappy and the foreigner so hesitating and slow that
everyone was fully justified in wondering if each bid he made
was going to be his last.</p>

<p>When &pound;2,475 was reached, with the bidding against him, the
foreigner waited so long that it was only the fraction of a
second before the hammer would have fallen that he called out,
"Tweenty-five hundred pouns!"</p>

<p>"Guineas!" snapped the now thoroughly exasperated Ramon,
whose nerves were by this time frayed almost to breaking point
at the opposition he was encountering.</p>

<p>The foreigner looked hurt, blinked his eyes several times and
then, without a word, turned his back upon the auctioneer and
started to push his way through the throng and out of the
room.</p>

<p>With no waiting, the auctioneer struck the table with his
hammer and those present showed their appreciation of the little
treat they had enjoyed by much clapping of hands. Old-timers at
property-sales agreed it was a long time since they had
experienced such drawn-out excitement.</p>

<p>Once out in the street, Ramon scowled savagely at Douro, who
had been with him in the sale room. "That ugly devil," he
snarled, "cost us more than &pound;1,100. What the hell was he bidding
like that for?"</p>

<p>"I heard a man behind me say," grunted Douro, "that once
there was a rumour of a valuable china clay deposit somewhere
about. Perhaps that's what he was after." His face brightened.
"Never mind, we got the place and that &pound;1,100 won't count much
if we find what you think is there."</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Larose, now looking his proper self
again, motored the commodore down to Carmel Abbey, where the
latter was to spend a few days. The one-time detective was in
good spirits. "He's known in Norwich," he said, "and has got a
bungalow in Hickling Broad. His name is Ellister, Ramon
Ellister, and he's a broker in the city. The man with him is
called Douro and is half a foreigner, Portuguese or something,
though he speaks perfect English. I couldn't find out what he
is, but they're both supposed to be well off. A third man, who
used to go about with them quite a lot, was called Braddock, but
as he's not been seen lately we may take it he was the fellow
your cousin shot." He nodded, "Oh, what a sure thing it is. This
Ellister is the man we're after, right enough. Fancy paying more
than &pound;2,500 for that old place!"</p>

<p>"But I'm disappointed," frowned the commodore, "and don't
feel by any means so certain as you. Why, the man looked a
gentleman!"</p>

<p>"And so he is&mdash;of a sort!" laughed Larose. "Anyone can
see he's got breeding, and I dare say we shall find him well
connected and with most respectable relations."</p>

<p>"He doesn't look a murderer," frowned the commodore.</p>

<p>"But what man ever does?" asked Larose. "Great Scott! In my
time I must have helped from thirty to forty men to the scaffold
and I remember only one who looked the real thing. To outward
appearance all the others looked decent, ordinary people. One
chap in particular, Rankine, the poisoner who put three women to
horribly agonising deaths, had quite an attractive appearance
and was altogether charming to talk to. Still, when in that
investigation I began to look about for the possible culprit, I
suspected him more than some others because he had all the
qualifications necessary for a successful multiple killer."</p>

<p>"And what are those qualifications?" asked the commodore.</p>

<p>"First, above all things, courage! For a series of deliberate
crimes where a man is always ready to kill, if necessary, you
must have courage. I say series of deliberate crimes, as
distinct from taking life in a moment of passion. A veritable
coward may be screwed up to committing murder in a sudden
impulse, but when murder is planned deliberately and,
particularly so, when it is repeated&mdash;then no coward is
capable of carrying it through."</p>

<p>"That fellow would be no coward, I admit," commented the
commodore. "He looks devilishly masterful as well."</p>

<p>"Of course he is! And he possesses another most essential
qualification of the killer too. He's cruel! Look at his eyes.
They've got the hard steely glint of a man who'd inflict any
sort of suffering on any person who stood in his way. Why, when
he was glaring at me so furiously in the sale-room this morning
I knew he was a man who'll stick at nothing to get what he
wants, and all my life's experience of criminals tells me I am
right. He'd kill, and kill again, and have no remorse." He
nodded complacently. "No, I'm certain we've got the right man.
I'm quite satisfied with the morning's work."</p>

<p>Two days later Ramon and Douro went down to take possession
of the house at the Gap, bringing with them what things they
thought would be necessary for getting down into the vaults and
opening Father Francesco's grave. Ramon, however, was not in a
very good humour.</p>

<p>"Braddock's mother came to see me this morning," he growled
as they were motoring along, "and I had quite a job in getting
rid of her. Braddock must have talked more about us than we
thought, for she knew where my flat was and was ringing the bell
by eight o'clock, to be sure of catching me, she said, before I
started up for the city. She'd come up from the country last
night."</p>

<p>Douro's eyes opened very wide. "What on earth did she come to
you for?"</p>

<p>"Wanted to know where Braddock was; said she knew he's been
going to stay with me at the bungalow and hadn't had a word from
him since. She'd been to his rooms and the landlady couldn't
tell her anything."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I said I couldn't tell her anything either! I didn't
deny Braddock had been to the bungalow, but said he'd only
stopped for the week-end and had been talking about going up
north on some important business. I said I knew nothing about
his private affairs, and that we were really only acquaintances
and hardly friends."</p>

<p>Douro looked uneasy. "Did she take it all right?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't! She said she knew I'd known him for at least
two years because he'd been up with me in Scotland, the
Christmas before last. Also, she said I had several times lent
him my car and wouldn't have done this unless we were
friends."</p>

<p>"Did you deny it?" asked Douro.</p>

<p>"I couldn't. He had gone down to Guildford in it to see
her&mdash;that's where she lives&mdash;and she had poked about
in the pockets and seen my driving licence with my name on it.
Still, I repeated I didn't know where her son had gone and she
said perhaps you knew, and wanted to know where you lived."</p>

<p>"The devil!" exclaimed Douro. "She knew my name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that you were a foreigner. She said you had plenty
of money. I told her I didn't know where you lived."</p>

<p>"Did she go away all right?"</p>

<p>"No, she was nasty. She asked if I had quarrelled with him
and then wouldn't tell me why she asked. I did the best I could
to smooth her down, but she went off saying that if she didn't
hear soon she'd go to the police."</p>

<p>"Well, if she does go, it won't hurt us," said Douro.</p>

<p>"Not if his body's not washed up anywhere," agreed Ramon,
"but if they find that and identify it, with the things in his
pockets it mayn't be too nice for us. Whatever happens then it
would put us on the map as far as the police are concerned, and
we certainly don't want them to know we exist."</p>

<p>Reaching the Gap at last, the prospects of what might lie
before them thrilled them with excitement as they proceeded to
take from the car everything they had brought with them. Ramon
opened a bottle of champagne to bring them luck.</p>

<p>"Now we can't tell how long it's going to take us," he said.
"It may be only a matter of minutes to find a way down into the
vaults and a matter of an hour or so to locate where that
Francesco was buried and open the grave."</p>

<p>"If we find it," nodded Douro significantly. "Remember, we
can't be certain about anything."</p>

<p>"But I am," scowled Ramon. "I've no doubt there, and I have
little doubt, either, we shall find plenty of stuff buried with
him." He picked up a stout jemmy from among the tools. "Now
we'll try the floorboards first and commence in the back
rooms."</p>

<p>But an arduous couple of hours, spent in straining and
pushing at the floorboards in every room, gave no result, and
accordingly they started upon the oak panelling. They tapped
here, there and everywhere, pushing and pulling upon the panels
in all directions. Nothing, however, eventuated, and late
afternoon found them flushed and angry, with bruised fingers,
and the skin of their hands barked away in many places.</p>

<p>They were the more annoyed because they had had, repeatedly,
to order trespassers out of the garden during the day. All that
had happened in the sale-room had evidently stirred public
interest and quite a number of people had arrived on bicycles
and in cars to perambulate round the house and even press their
faces close to the window panes!</p>

<p>"A good thing we never thought of getting down from outside,"
snarled Ramon. "We'd have had half the population of Norfolk
here if we'd started that. Now we'll give up all this useless
tapping business. It's only wasting time. We'll have to break
through the flooring somewhere. If we take it up in one of those
end rooms by the church wall we are bound to be right over the
vaults. Braddock said that at any rate they would extend well
under the back part of the house."</p>

<p>So, into a back room they went and proceeded to prise up the
floorboards. There was a space of about a foot underneath and
then came quite loose sand. The sand was easily cleared, and
their eyes gleamed when masonry was exposed.</p>

<p>"We've got it!" panted Ramon excitedly. "This is the roof of
the vaults. Now, everything is going to be as easy as shelling
peas."</p>

<p>They soon found, however, that there was no light task before
them, as the masonry was almost as hard as iron. The heavy
chisel they used, no matter how fiercely struck, would only bite
into it the depth of a scratch each time, and darkness came with
only a few inches of depth to show for all their labour.</p>

<p>"The devil!" swore Douro. "It'll take us a week at this rate!
I vote we have a spell. My arms feel fit to break and my poor
hands are bruised to a jelly."</p>

<p>But Ramon was a hard taskmaster and, after only a very brief
interval for a snatched meal, they went at it again. Hour after
hour they chiselled through the granite-like stone, and then at
last something happened. The masonry crashed in, a hole as big
as a saucer gaped wide and black and both Ramon's hammer and
chisel disappeared through it.</p>

<p>"Blast!" he exclaimed angrily. "That's done it! Now we shall
have to go into Norwich again and get fresh ones!"</p>

<p>Still, they were greatly excited, and tying a candle to a
piece of string, lowered it down through the hole. "Ten feet, at
least," exclaimed Ramon, "and we'll have to get a ladder as
well!"</p>

<p>In turn they peered down the hole and by the dim light of the
candle gathered something of the size of the chamber beneath
them. "But there doesn't seem to be any coffin," said Douro
disappointedly. "The place looks quite empty."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," retorted Ramon. "The coffin will be under
the flagstones. Thank goodness, we ought to be able to crack
them easily if we buy the biggest hammer we can get to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next morning they were up at daybreak and by ten had
returned from Norwich with a new chisel and a bigger hammer, and
with a twelve-foot ladder strapped to the side of the car. Then
it took them two hours to enlarge the hole sufficiently to get
through it and climb down on to the floor of the vaults.</p>

<p>With the first swing round of their lantern for a few moments
their mortification was beyond expression, even in oaths, when
there was to be seen a second ladder propped up close by.</p>

<p>"I told you so," almost shrieked Ramon. "I knew there'd be a
way up into the house," and darting over to the ladder he
proceeded to spring up. The sliding panel was easy to pick out
on that side and in a few seconds he had pushed it open and was
peering into the kitchen. "Damnation!" he swore. "And we've put
in all those hours of hard work for nothing. If only we'd been a
little more patient and searched more thoroughly!"</p>

<p>Still, the fury of them both abated instantly when they
picked out the name Francesco upon one of the big flagstones.
Great treasure seemed already theirs and they looked at each
other with sparkling eyes. For just the very fraction of a
second it flashed into Ramon's mind to strike Douro down there
and then and take everything for himself, but he quickly thought
better of it. There might be a lot of hard work yet to do, and
besides&mdash;disappearance number two might turn out to be very
awkward unless it were carried out with every contingency
provided for beforehand.</p>

<p>Douro drew in a deep breath. "Well, we'll have lunch first
and another bottle of that champagne. Then we'll bolt and
shutter up every door and window in the house and take our own
time. There's no hurry now and we've got everything in our
hands."</p>

<p>After a hurried meal&mdash;they were too excited to eat
much&mdash;they returned to the vaults and started on the
flagstone. At first they thought they would be able to break it
easily with the big sledge-hammer they had provided themselves
with, but soon found they were very much mistaken there. The
stone was solid as a ten-foot rock and they saw there was no
help for it but to chisel round the edges and raise it up with a
crow-bar.</p>

<p>An hour's hard work and they got the crow-bar under. The big
flagstone moved more easily than they had expected and a
thrilling moment came as they levered it to one side and exposed
the bare earth underneath.</p>

<p>"The spade, quick!" called out Ramon, and seized it and dug
it deeply in. To their delight the earth was not hard and very
soon there was a good heap over the side. For a few minutes he
dug hard. Then, suddenly, he straightened himself up and, with a
peculiar expression on his face, let Douro take the spade from
him. Douro was all eager to go on, but, after shovelling up a
few spadefuls, desisted as suddenly as Ramon had done and looked
the latter straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you smell anything?" he asked in an awed whisper.</p>

<p>"By hell, I do," whispered Ramon, "and it's damned
strange."</p>

<p>He spoke peremptorily. "But go on. The stink's probably been
bottled up for all these years."</p>

<p>Douro resumed the digging, but, with each spadeful of earth
he threw up, the horrid taint grew worse. "Here, wait a minute,"
he cried when he was knee-deep in the grave. "It makes me feel
sick. I must get a breath of fresh air," and he stepped out of
the hole they had made and moved a few yards away.</p>

<p>Ramon snatched the spade from him, holding his breath,
started shovelling violently. He worked only with a great
effort, as now the stench was very strong. He, too, was about to
desist when the last spadeful of earth he threw up disclosed a
piece of what looked like tarpaulin, sticking up.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he exclaimed. "It's some chemical they put in, and
they've wrapped the body round."</p>

<p>A few quick strokes and he had exposed more tarpaulin. "Here,
catch hold," he ordered chokingly. "Help me pull it out," and
holding their breath they lugged out the tarpaulin and its
contents from the grave and dropped it down quickly. The
tarpaulin was tied loosely with a piece of cord at both
ends.</p>

<p>They were loth to handle the gruesome object again, but,
their hopes of great treasure prevailing over their repugnance,
they pulled off the cords with the spade and with quick jerks
flung aside the tarpaulin.</p>

<p>To their amazement was exposed a man's body fully clothed,
even to the boots. It was lying on its side.</p>

<p>A moment's breathless silence and then, with their eyes
almost bursting from their sockets, they both yelled
simultaneously, "Braddock!"</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt about it, the corpse was
that of their quondam companion. Of a dreadful colour and
nauseating in its awful disintegration, they could yet quite
plainly recognise its features. Added to that, upon a finger of
one greenish, blackened hand they could see the gold signet ring
they knew so well.</p>

<p>A stunned silence followed and then Ramon, pointing with a
tremulously jerking hand, exclaimed hoarsely, "Look, look, he
was shot in his head, just above the neck! See the bullet
wound?"</p>

<p>"But what happened?" gasped Douro. "It couldn't have
been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was!" snarled Ramon, his voice now strong and vibrant in
his fury. "It was that cursed little professor! Braddock
couldn't have got over the wall as we thought. One of those last
two shots must have killed him."</p>

<p>"Then the professor must have brought him here!" exclaimed
Douro.</p>

<p>"Of course he did, you fool!" shouted Ramon. "After he'd
rifled this grave and found Francesco's treasure." His voice
rose almost to a wail. "How he got to know about it we shall
never know, but he bested us all along. Though he got his
punishment from me, we've been beaten by the little rat."</p>

<p>"But perhaps he found nothing in the grave," suggested Douro,
"or perhaps he never looked. He may have just lifted this
flagstone haphazardly to hide the body and never searched
underneath. Any treasure may be still there."</p>

<p>Accepting the suggestion with a scowl, Ramon seized up the
spade and, springing into the grave, started to shovel up more
earth. He worked quickly, but examined each shovelful before he
threw it over the side. He soon came upon human bones, thigh
bones, vertebrae, parts of a hand, a shinbone and finally a
skull.</p>

<p>Then, when the earth began to get harder and more compact,
and common sense told him he had come to as deep as the grave
had been dug, his spade struck against something hard and,
working round it, he brought up a round, flat piece of lead. He
cursed it was not gold and was about to throw it up to Douro
when he saw quite a number of words cut deeply into it.</p>

<p>Retaining it in his hand, he sprang out of the grave to
examine it better by the light of the lantern. However, his eyes
were smarting from the dust and he thrust it over to Douro.</p>

<p>"You read it," he cried sharply. "My eyes are smarting and I
can't see clearly."</p>

<p>Douro rubbed over the surface with his fingers to dislodge
the grit in the lettering. "It looks like a plaque," he said,
"which was nailed on to the coffin, some sort of inventory of
what was inside. By gad, I believe it is!" and he read slowly,
"Ye jewelled mitre and paten and chalice and ye four
candlesticks of golde." His voice rose to a shout. "God, it's
what we're looking for. See if they are still there."</p>

<p>Ramon jumped back into the grave and started groping with his
hands. He found more and more bones, more finger bones, more
bones of the feet and more vertebrae&mdash;but no sacramental
vessels or precious metal of any kind. He could feel he was at
the hard bottom of the grave.</p>

<p>He sprang out and started to laugh boisterously, a hard,
horrible, hysterical laugh. "I was right on the bull's-eye," he
shouted, "right all along from first to last! I never made a
mistake and my judgment was without fault." He sobered down to a
bitter oath. "And that cursed miserable-looking professor hopped
in and grabbed everything."</p>

<p>"But if he got them," snapped Douro, who had quite recovered
his wits, "they can't be far away. He's hidden them somewhere.
We can be quite certain of that."</p>

<p>"Ah, a good idea that," exclaimed Ramon, his hopes
recovering. "We'll search every inch of the house. They're not
likely to be down here. He would have taken them up to gloat
over." He indicated the corpse on the tarpaulin. "We'll get rid
of that. We'll dump him where he was." His hysterical laugh in
part returned. "I want to get back at least part of that &pound;2,500
I paid and I could never sell the house again with that stink
coming up."</p>

<p>So, nauseating though the task was, the body was re-rolled on
the tarpaulin and pushed unceremoniously back into the grave,
the earth was piled over and the big flagstone replaced. Ramon
was most careful, too, to stamp earth in the crevices round the
stone.</p>

<p>During all that day and the day following the two searched
through the house, with the search, however, degenerating into a
half-hearted one, as the idea had occurred to both of them that
the things found might have been taken away with the dead
professor's effects.</p>

<p>"And if so," said Ramon when talking things over, "I don't
see how we can move farther in the matter. Certainly, I could
get in touch with the fellow in Cornwall called Smith who owned
the property, but it might awaken suspicions that we had
something to do with the disappearance of that damned
professor."</p>

<p>"But they couldn't prove anything," said Douro, "unless they
found the body."</p>

<p>"That's true," agreed Ramon, "but we don't know how much he
may have confided in someone before he was bumped off, and so
any enquiries from us as to what he had found might bring us in
as the parties who tried to get in this house that night. No,
there would be a lot of risk stirring the muddy waters and it
isn't worth it. You see, it's certain now that Mother Braddock
will eventually go to the police and then there will be two
disappearances to be accounted for, with both of them, in a way,
associated with us. I mean that would be the case if we go on
now to show any interest in the professor's affairs."</p>

<p>So his first disappointment over, as was characteristic of
him, Ramon proceeded to cut his losses. They would return to
town the next day, he said, and let the matter drop.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that their run of bad luck was not
over, for the following morning, starting early upon their
journey, they broke the rear axle of their car when not a
hundred yards from the house. The car was pushed back into the
garage, Norwich was rung up and arrangements made for a new part
to be obtained from London. In the meantime a car came out to
take them into Norwich to catch the express.</p>

<p>They reached the railway station only just in time to get
their tickets and jump into a carriage as the train was at the
very moment of starting. They took the nearest first-class
carriage they came to. There was only one occupant when they got
in, a young girl sitting in the far corner, and for a minute or
so, busy in arranging their suit-cases, they did not take any
notice of her. Then Ramon, glancing round, took her in with a
quick appraising glance and recognised her as the girl he had
given the two five-pound notes to in the library in Norwich on
the day when he had cut a page from that book.</p>

<p>For a few seconds he was uncertain whether or not to take any
notice of her, but she settled the matter by giving him a bright
smile and he immediately raised his hat and smiled back. That
was all that took place for the moment, but, rather amused at
the encounter, while Douro was busy with a morning newspaper, he
moved along the carriage and, seating himself down opposite to
her, opened a conversation.</p>

<p>"And how are you to-day?" he smiled. "You look very
well."</p>

<p>"I am, thank you," she nodded. "Fortunately, I'm always
well."</p>

<p>"Lucky girl!" he laughed. "Still at the library?"</p>

<p>She looked surprised at this question. "Of course! I'm always
there."</p>

<p>"Going up to town?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got three days' holiday to do exactly what I
like."</p>

<p>"Going to stay with some of your relatives, of course?"</p>

<p>She regarded him coldly. "I have no relatives, thank
goodness. No, I'm going to stay at a hotel."</p>

<p>He pretended to look disapproving. "But surely it's not wise
for a girl of your age and attractions to be by yourself? I mean
with no one to look after you."</p>

<p>She looked at him more coldly still. "It's quite all right
for me, thank you. Your sex are no danger to me. I'm not
interested in them."</p>

<p>He laughed merrily. "That's a nasty one. You don't think much
of us then?"</p>

<p>"I don't like or dislike you. I simply don't have anything to
do with you."</p>

<p>He made a grimace. "And how, may I ask, are you going to
amuse yourself?"</p>

<p>She spoke now with some animation. "I'm going to two
pictures, a theatre and perhaps a concert."</p>

<p>"Do you know of any good pictures?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What I call good, but you mightn't. I'm going to see <i>The
Black Hand,</i> <i>Gentlemen of Crime</i> and either
<i>Dracula</i> or <i>The Amateur Burglar.</i>"</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me," he exclaimed in mock surprise, "what
gruesome pictures for a young lady to want to see!"</p>

<p>"I like gruesome pictures," she said, "and I like ones about
crime. They're adventures for me after my rather dull life."</p>

<p>He nodded. "And I expect it is dull in that musty old
library. Now what sort of life would you like best if you could
have it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one full of adventure," she replied instantly, "and I
don't think, either, I should mind danger and risk."</p>

<p>"But you'd like comfort," he frowned, "luxury and plenty of
money to spend!"</p>

<p>"Of course I would," she laughed. "What woman wouldn't?"</p>

<p>Ramon was puzzled and anxious to find out what her education
had been. He asked her what books she liked best, and was very
much astonished to learn of the wide reading she had had. The
opinion he had first been inclined to have was that she was a
shallow-minded little doll, but this underwent a quick change
and he became genuinely interested in her. All the while, too,
he could not help noticing how exceedingly pretty she was.
Indeed, he thought, it would be hard to pick any faults in her.
Working tactfully round to her parents, he was not at all
surprised when she told him her father had been Colonel Byron of
the Indian Army and an aide-de-camp to the then Viceroy. He told
himself he had recognised her breeding at once.</p>

<p>Presently Douro, noticing what a good-looking girl she was,
put down his newspaper and came over to join in the
conversation. The time passed so quickly that both men were
surprised when town was reached. Then Ramon suggested that, if
she had nothing better to do, she might care to have lunch with
him at the Liverpool Street Station Hotel.</p>

<p>"There will be only we two," he laughed. "My friend Mr. Douro
can't stop. He has some work he must do."</p>

<p>Agatha appeared quite unconcerned. "That won't hurt me," she
said. "Yes, I'll come with pleasure, but I shall have to be away
by two."</p>

<p>He led her into a big dining hall of the hotel and, choosing
a table in a quiet corner, ordered the nicest things on the menu
for their meal. "And what would you like to drink," he asked,
"any wine?"</p>

<p>"Champagne," she replied coolly. "It always suits me best and
never goes to my head."</p>

<p>Ramon smiled. Gad, what a nerve she'd got! What impudence to
take it for granted he was willing to spend all that upon her,
when they might never meet again! He was half minded to order
the cheapest claret on the list and see what she'd say! However,
an idea was forming in his mind and the champagne was
ordered.</p>

<p>Agatha took a long drink and it was nearly an empty glass she
set down. "I was thirsty," she explained, then, remembering
something she had once read in a book, she added, "Besides,
that's the proper way to drink champagne, no sipping and you get
the result at once."</p>

<p>Ramon was amazed. Certainly he had never met a girl like her
before! Either she was completely wanting in all actual
experience of life or was just a brazen and designing little
hussy&mdash;though undeniably a very attractive
one&mdash;intending to lead him on. He doubted if her alleged
indifference to men were not all a pose. At any rate, he would
try her out and see what she would do.</p>

<p>"But you can't tell me, Miss Byron," he smiled, "that, with
your really charming appearance, you haven't got a boy-friend
yet?" He shook his head. "It isn't natural."</p>

<p>"It probably isn't," agreed Agatha calmly, "but it just
happens I'm made that way. No, I haven't a boy-friend as you
call it, and I've never had one." She smiled. "I've always
stopped any man's interest in me&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"But I am becoming interested in you," he smiled back, "and
you're not trying to stop me."</p>

<p>She spoke carelessly. "Ah, but your interest in me is not in
that way. You are puzzled because I let you buy me off when I
caught you thieving in our library."</p>

<p>Ramon flushed hotly. With all his hardened criminal life it
somehow grated upon him he should be so frankly stigmatised as a
thief. "But you were every bit as bad as I was," he retorted
sharply. "In fact you were worse, as you were in a trustful
position and I was not." He regarded her curiously. "But why did
you let me off?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "Because of the money you were offering, and,
also, because I couldn't help admiring your boldness. Besides,
it was an adventure for me, like one of those I often see on the
pictures."</p>

<p>"But you ran a great risk," he frowned.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't see it. You would never dare
tell anyone what you had done, and certainly I was not going to
say anything."</p>

<p>A thought struck him and he asked, "By the by, what became of
my card, the one I sent in to the head librarian?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I took it off his desk and destroyed it. Also I
didn't enter your name in the diary, as I was supposed to, as a
visitor who had examined the book." She laughed. "I covered all
your tracks as well as my own. You had paid me for it."</p>

<p>He laughed, too, but, intending to pay her back for calling
him a thief, remarked dryly, "Then anyone can buy you if they
pay a high enough price?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she said, and then, not liking his smile and
suddenly realising what lay behind it, she added quickly, "But
only in certain ways." She looked contemptuous. "I'd never sell
myself to anyone to be his mistress, if that's what you mean.
I'm not to be bought for that."</p>

<p>"So, so," laughed Ramon. "Quite a virtuous young lady, after
all!" He screwed up his face. "But tell me, if you dislike men
so, aren't you ever going to get married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she laughed back, "when I meet the right man, the
one who can give me all I want." She shrugged her shoulders.
"It'll be distasteful to me, but I shall have to put up with
that."</p>

<p>"And would you consider me suitable?" smiled Ramon.</p>

<p>Her answer was emphatic. "Certainly not! You're much too
masterful and wouldn't suit me at all. The man I marry will be
one I can order about and who'll be content with just what I
choose to give him&mdash;and nothing more." She nodded.
"Besides, your disposition is a cruel one and you'd murder me if
you could when you got tired of me."</p>

<p>Ramon laughed merrily. "You're a nice prize-packet, aren't
you? I've never met anyone like you. Do you turn yourself inside
out like this to everyone?"</p>

<p>"Not I," replied Agatha instantly. "I've never confided in
anyone before." She regarded him intently. "But with you I feel
quite safe and it's a treat to be able to speak my mind. I
realise we are both of the same type. We have no consciences at
all. We'd neither of us have any remorse for anything we'd
done."</p>

<p>Ramon regarded her with great respect. "Well, I'm damned!" he
exclaimed. "You're a mind-reader if ever there was one." He
spoke quietly. "No, I'm never sorry for anything I've done. I
have the best out of life and I don't care how I get it."</p>

<p>"Are you well off?" asked Agatha curiously. "What do you do
for a living?"</p>

<p>Ramon looked hard at her for a long moment. "You told me in
the train," he said slowly, "that you knew Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," she retorted instantly. "No one could
ever 'know Shakespeare' as you call it, his mind was far too
near the infinite, far too deep to fathom. No, I said I'd read
most of his plays. That was all."</p>

<p>"Then leave it at that," nodded Ramon. "Well, you remember
Autolycus?"</p>

<p>"'A picker-up of unconsidered trifles'," nodded back Agatha.
"Yes, I remember him."</p>

<p>"Well, that's me!" smiled Ramon. "I'm an Autolycus."</p>

<p>"You mean you steal for a living?" frowned Agatha.</p>

<p>"That's a nasty word," he frowned back. "I mean I take
things, occasionally which I don't think other people deserve to
have."</p>

<p>"In a big way?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "No picking pockets or taking the
money left for the milk."</p>

<p>"Oh, how thrilling!" she exclaimed. "But don't you get
caught?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" he replied. "Only fools and blunderers get
caught, and I'm not one of them." He spoke quickly. "Now look
here, Miss Byron. It's possible you and I might be of use to
each other. I'm inclined to offer you a job. My friend and I run
a nightclub, and what about you helping us? If you turned out
suitable we'd pay you well."</p>

<p>"But what would I have to do?"</p>

<p>"You'd be our secretary and a sort of hostess, too. You'd
introduce people to one another. You'd dance with the men and
encourage them to buy champagne&mdash;we make good profit on
that&mdash;and you'd attract people to come to play banker,
roulette and chemin de fer."</p>

<p>"Then you play illegal games?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. That's where the money is made."</p>

<p>"But aren't you ever raided?"</p>

<p>"We haven't been as yet. We take a lot of precautions and
there are several entrances and exits to our place. The doors
are steel-lined, too, and would take a lot of breaking
down."</p>

<p>"Oh, how thrilling!" exclaimed Agatha again. "And I should be
a sort of decoy there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And you'd get a lot of presents from the men if you
were tactful and managed them properly."</p>

<p>Agatha was wary at once, "But I shouldn't give them anything
in return. I've told you I'm not that sort of girl."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have to be," he laughed. "You could play them
like big fishes on a hook. Now what do you think of the
idea?"</p>

<p>Agatha considered. "Where is this night-club?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In Hanover Square."</p>

<p>"Oh, in a good neighbourhood?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course!" frowned Ramon. "What on earth did you think? Why
we get some of the best of society people there, wealthy, and
many with titles, too! Now what do you say?"</p>

<p>"I'd like you to try me," she said. "It might be the very
sort of life I've longed for."</p>

<p>"Of course it would be!" he said. "It'd be a new adventure
for you every night." He laughed. "What a chance to pick up the
very husband you want, the poor devil you're going to take
everything from and only give him cold kisses and the cold
shoulder in return."</p>

<p>"But what would you pay me for all this?" asked Agatha.</p>

<p>"What salary do you get now?" countered Ramon.</p>

<p>"Five guineas," she replied, giving herself an instant rise
of two.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," he said rudely, "but at any rate we'll
start you with six. Now when do you say you're supposed to be
going back to Norwich? Ah, Sunday! Well, that'll fit in very
nicely. Come to us for to-morrow, Saturday, night and see how
you shape. Hanover Square, and be there at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"But about a frock!" exclaimed Agatha. "I've not brought one
dress with me suitable for dancing."</p>

<p>"Then buy one," said Ramon. "Have you got enough money?" He
looked amused. "But, of course, you'll say you haven't! Well,
I'll give you &pound;10. And you say you'll have to buy shoes too?
Another &pound;4?"</p>

<p>He took three &pound;5 notes out of his pocket and when no one was
looking handed them across to Agatha. "And how do you know," she
asked, "that you'll see anything of me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll come all right," he laughed. "I know you'll not
do anything for me out of gratitude, but self-interest will bind
us two together. Now mind you look your best to-morrow and be
sure your frock is all right. Here, you'd better go for it to
Madame Bonnier in North Audley Street. She knows me and I'll
give her a ring to say you're coming to her. I'll tell her
you're to have the best she can give you in the short time, and
if it comes to a little more than the &pound;10 I'll settle with her
later." He regarded Agatha's lovely piquante face and chuckled.
"She'll think I've fallen for something at last and that you're
my mistress." He laughed as if it were a splendid joke. "You
won't mind, will you?"</p>

<p>Agatha's reply was contemptuously cold. "Not as long as it's
not true," she said. "People can think what they like. Their
opinions never trouble me."</p>

<p>That same evening Ramon told Douro the arrangements he had
made. "About that girl we were talking to in the train," he
said. "What did you think of her?"</p>

<p>Douro was enthusiastic. "A perfect little beauty," he
exclaimed, "and I've been wondering all day who she was."</p>

<p>Ramon laughed. "She's the girl who caught me cutting out the
page of that book in the Norwich library and let me off for
&pound;10."</p>

<p>Douro's eyes opened very wide. "The devil! And did she refer
to it again?"</p>

<p>"Certainly she did! Called me a thief, but declared frankly
she was always to be bought&mdash;at a price?"</p>

<p>Douro looked sly. "And are you going to buy her? You whom I
thought had no interest in females!"</p>

<p>"Oh, she didn't mean it in that way! She's not in the market
there. She got on her high horse directly I chaffed her about it
and glared at me as cold as a frog. She told me plainly she was
going to be no man's mistress. By buying her she meant she was
willing to work for anyone in get-rich-quick ways if they paid
her enough. So I purpose buying her, with you coming into the
deal. I've already paid the &pound;15 on account," and he proceeded to
give his partner an outline of the conversation which had passed
between them and the tentative arrangements he had made.</p>

<p>"She'll be an attraction, right enough," agreed Douro, "and
ought to bring a lot of new clients in." He looked uneasy. "But
how far can we trust her?"</p>

<p>"To the end of the world," nodded Ramon; he paused
significantly, "as long as our interests happen to coincide with
hers. If they don't"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"not
a yard, not a single yard. I believe she'd sell us without a
moment's hesitation."</p>

<p>"She seems a queer fish," commented Douro. "Are you sure
you've got her right?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Ramon. "Yes, she's the queerest fish
I've ever met, and as selfish and heartless as she's beautiful.
Still, for what we want her for I'm sure she'll suit us down to
the ground. Of course she'll want a lot of training, as she's
had no experience of life except what she learnt from books,
though she's almost shrewd enough to be able not to show it. I
know she told me several lies&mdash;one, for instance, about the
salary she is getting at the library&mdash;but she told them so
convincingly that I quite admired her for them. She's a splendid
little actress."</p>

<p>"Well, well," remarked Douro, "I'll see what I make out of
her to-morrow night. Business is business, and, though I don't
pretend to be like you as far as girls are concerned, she won't
get round me with her good looks."</p>

<p>When Agatha parted from Ramon she felt as if she were walking
on air. No longer was she to be one of the audience watching a
film, but she was to be on the film herself, and even more than
that, it would be she who would be making the film. It would not
be a shadow world in which she would move, but one real and
tangible, peopled with live and vibrant men and women who all
the time were taking risks against the law and walking upon the
precipice side.</p>

<p>She had no doubts about what this night-club was and the part
she was going to play. Of course, people were cheated out of
their money and she was going to help in the cheating; they were
fleeced and she was going to help take off the wool.</p>

<p>Booking a room at an hotel and leaving her modest suitcase
there, she went straight to the costumiere Ramon had directed.
Madame was at first inclined to be distant towards such a pretty
girl who, in part at all events, was being financed by the gay
Society man she knew Ramon Ellister to be, but the shy and
modest manner which Agatha assumed disarmed her and she was
almost at once intending to do the best she could for her.</p>

<p>Agatha's pose was that of an innocent and eager young girl
who had seen little of the great world. Her story was that,
coming up to London for a few days only, she had most
unexpectedly been invited to a big dance and had nothing good
enough to wear for such an important occasion. Then Mr. Ramon
Ellister had suggested she should come to her, Madame Bonnier,
to get out of her trouble. Oh, yes, of course, she knew Mr.
Ellister well, he was her uncle.</p>

<p>Madame's good nature completely imposed upon, she said
fortunately she was in a position to furnish Agatha with the
very gown she wanted. One had been made just recently for a
client, but the young lady was abroad and it was doubtful if she
would be home for a month or longer. So Agatha should have her
frock and, with a very little alteration, it would fit
perfectly.</p>

<p>The gown was brought out and Agatha was charmed with it. It
was black taffeta, most simple, but beautifully designed. It was
tried on and she was told to come back the next day, when it
would be all ready for her.</p>

<p>The following morning madame pronounced it perfect, and as
Agatha surveyed herself in the big mirror, with a catch in her
breath, she agreed with her. Surely never had she looked so
nice, she told herself, and she wanted to burst into a cynical
laugh. She, of the charity school and, such a short time back,
the little general servant of old Miss Brown, now gowned in a
beautiful creation of one of the most fashionable West End
modistes and about to take her place on equal terms with some of
the best Society people! Really she could never in her wildest
dreams have expected so startling a turn of the wheel of
fortune!</p>

<p>Madame regarded her with undisguised approval. "You will do
great credit to me," she nodded, "and I am sure your uncle will
not regret the extra guineas he is paying. But what are you
going to do for a necklace? No diamonds. A single string of
pearls will be best."</p>

<p>Agatha looked very amused. "My diamond-and-pearl days have
not come yet, Madame," she smiled. "I have neither diamonds nor
pearls. I shall go just as you see me now."</p>

<p>But madame was very troubled. "No, no, that will never do!"
she exclaimed. "It will spoil the whole effect. You must have
something round that beautiful neck to show up the beauty of my
gown." She considered for a few moments. "When are you going
home? Ah, to-morrow! Well then, I will lend you a necklace and
your uncle can bring it back to me on Monday."</p>

<p>Going out of the room, she returned very quickly with a small
jewel case in her hand, and took from it a string of beautiful
pearls. Fastening it round Agatha's neck, she turned her towards
the mirror to see the effect. "See," she exclaimed with
enthusiasm, "that's just what it needed! Two beautiful things,
but each incomplete without the other."</p>

<p>Agatha gasped. She was more than ever thrilled at her
appearance. "But are they real?" she stammered. "Because, if so,
I shall be afraid to take them."</p>

<p>Madame laughed. "No, child, they are not real. If they were
they would be worth many hundreds of pounds. Still, they are the
best imitation and it would take even an expert quite a little
time to decide what they were." She nodded. "On you, with your
looks and my gown, everyone will take them to be the real
thing."</p>

<p>The necklace was not all she lent Agatha, for learning she
had no suitable evening coat she produced one. "And your uncle
can bring that back, too." She smiled. "Remember me to him and
say I congratulate him upon his niece."</p>

<p>Arriving at Hanover Square, even when she entered the hall,
in spite of all her self-confidence, Agatha could not help
feeling a little bit overawed by the sumptuousness of the
furnishings, and her heart beat unpleasantly. Happily, however,
for her peace of mind, both Ramon and Douro were in the hall and
at once came forward to meet her. As the former, in smiling
approval of her appearance, took her coat from her, the latter
gallantly raised her hand to his lips. "You will be the most
lovely girl here to-night," he said ardently. "No, no, I correct
myself, you will be the most lovely on any night. I am sure no
one will surpass you."</p>

<p>For some reason Ramon felt annoyed at his partner's
compliments. "Don't talk rubbish, Joseph," he said sharply. "She
may be a bit out of the ordinary, but good looks are not all we
want her for. It remains to be seen if she can earn her salary."
He repressed a start when he saw her without her coat. "Pearls!"
he exclaimed. "Where did you get those from?"</p>

<p>"Madame lent them to me," replied Agatha, "and the coat as
well. You're to take them back to her on Monday."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am, am I?" he frowned. He regarded her curiously.
"Though, of course, they are imitations, she must be trusting
you pretty well to lend them. They're worth &pound;20."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she trusted me all right," nodded Agatha. She
smiled sweetly. "But then, as I didn't want her to think, as you
said she would, that I was your mistress, I had told her you
were my uncle."</p>

<p>"The devil you had!" exclaimed Ramon frowningly. "Evidently
telling untruths never worries you." His face broke into a
reluctant smile. "Your uncle, am I? Well, it's not a bad idea,
and I'd better be your uncle here, too. It'll keep people from
imagining things and"&mdash;his lips curved to a half
sneer&mdash;"make it easier for you when you start looking for
that millionaire husband."</p>

<p>Douro thought it a good joke and laughed heartily. "Never you
be afraid of Mr. Ellister," he said. "If ever he annoys you with
his attentions, Miss Byron, you come to me and I'll put him in
his right place," and again for some reason Ramon was annoyed
with his partner.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about Agatha being an outstanding success
that night. Everyone wanted to know who she was and all the men
asked to be introduced to her. Her behaviour was without fault
and, though most modest and unassuming, her poise was that of
one who was very sure of herself and able to hold her own with
everyone.</p>

<p>"She'll do," said Ramon to his partner towards midnight, "but
we must make her realise she mustn't take the men away from the
tables. When she's learnt the ropes she'll be a great
asset."</p>

<p>He drove Agatha back to her hotel just before three in the
morning, with the arrangement made she was to leave Norwich at
once and enter upon her duties at the Old Regency Club with no
delay.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the Monday morning Agatha told a harrowing
story to the head librarian, how it had suddenly been found out
that her aunt, her only relation, must undergo a terrible
operation at once and she, Agatha, must take charge of her four
little children. She was so grieved to relinquish her post at
the library as she had got to so love her work. She did not know
how long she might have to be in London, but it might be
months.</p>

<p>The librarian was most sympathetic, so much so that he
arranged for her salary to be paid up to the end of the month.
He would try to keep her place open for her as long as he could
in the hope that she would be free again sooner than she
expected.</p>

<p>So strange is chance that the very next morning Larose
presented himself at the library. He had been laid up, he said,
with a bad attack of influenza or would have been there long
before. He wanted to know if there were a page missing from
their copy of <i>Ye Anciente Churches of Olde England.</i> He
understood they possessed one of the four copies of the book
known to be in existence. The page had been brought to him under
peculiar circumstances, the exact nature of which he was not
able, for the moment, to disclose, but there was no doubt it had
been stolen from somewhere quite recently, probably a little
over a month previously.</p>

<p>The librarian was interested at once, but most terribly
shocked when, upon examining their copy, it was found to have
been stolen from it.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," he told Larose, "as it is always
kept in a glass case in the manuscript room and the public are
not allowed access to it, except upon special request. Then they
are always under the vigilant observation of one of our staff
all the time they are perusing it."</p>

<p>The assistant librarian was called in and then it was
remembered some weeks previously, after duly presenting his
card, a gentleman had been allowed to examine the book. When,
however, the daily records of the library were gone through, to
the astonishment of both librarians there was no mention of the
incident.</p>

<p>"But it is very extraordinary," commented the head librarian,
"for the young lady assistant who was in charge of the
manuscript room was never remiss in her duties and should have
entered it. In the ordinary way, too, his card should have been
filed."</p>

<p>"And you say this young lady has left," said Larose.</p>

<p>"Only yesterday, but I have her address. It is in Romford
Road, Forest Gate, and we will communicate with her at once. She
is certain to remember him and who he was, as we had very few
such enquiries after our valuable books."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going straight up to town now," said Larose, "and
shall be passing through Romford Road. So I'll call and see what
she says and telephone you at once."</p>

<p>A few hours later he phoned up that no person of the name of
Byron was known at the given number in Romford Road and that no
one, as far as he could learn, had ever heard of her.</p>

<p>The head librarian was very puzzled, but, such confidence had
Agatha inspired in him, he came later to the conclusion that
when she had given him the number of the house in Romford Road
he must have put it down incorrectly. He was sure that was the
explanation of Larose not being able to learn anything of
her.</p>

<h2><a if="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE DECOY.</h2>

<p class="first">THE Old Regency in Hanover Square was
patronised by certain people well known in Society circles and,
of its kind, was generally considered good-class, though by no
means exclusive. Membership, however, was not exactly easy and a
newcomer had to be well recommended. It was whispered the police
had their eyes upon it, though so far it had not been interfered
with.</p>

<p>The club occupied the whole of a large Georgian house on the
west side of the square and, if not extravagantly furnished, its
appointments were nevertheless as comfortable and even luxurious
as could be wished. No set meals were served and it did not open
its doors until seven o'clock in the evening. It provided a
small but good orchestra of four players, and dancing was
continued until well into the small hours of every morning. It
contained two spacious card-rooms where bridge was the game
generally played, the stakes for the most part being moderate
ones.</p>

<p>On the third floor, however, were several smaller rooms where
members and their friends could make up private parties, and
there it was well known the stakes were much heavier with
considerable sums of money changing hands at poker in the course
of a single evening.</p>

<p>A Monsieur de Vallon, a world-travelled Frenchman of charming
manners, was supposed to be the proprietor of the club, but, in
reality, he was only the well-paid manager of Douro and Ramon,
who ran the whole place. Good profits were made on the wine and
spirits sold, but the main source of revenue to the two
partners, apart from what they took off the unwary at private
poker parties, was undoubtedly drawn from the roulette played in
a large room in the basement of the building. Here, most
elaborate precautions had been taken so that, in the event of a
raid, the players should have ample time to get out of the
building without being interrogated by the police and, the next
day, facing the scandal of being brought before the magistrate
at the Bow Street Court. They were none of them aware exactly
how the escape would be effected, but had been assured by the
manager it had been provided for and that there was no need for
them to worry at all. In any eventuality, they were told, they
would be able to get away.</p>

<p>Ostensibly, the room was used for billiards only, and, to
give colour to this supposition, a table had been installed in
part of it, there still being plenty of space in the remaining
part to house all the paraphernalia of roulette. The room was
approached by a long narrow passage, to negotiate which two
heavy pairs of swing-doors, which did not yield easily to the
touch, had to be passed through. An attendant was always
stationed outside the first ones, and, by the pressing of his
foot against a well camouflaged push, a warning bell would ring
in the billiard-room. The entrance to the room itself was made
through double soundproof doors, the second of which had no
handle outside.</p>

<p>Inside, the room looked innocent enough, with apparently no
exit save by the door through which one had entered. In reality,
however, there was another door leading into the cellars of the
adjoining house. Access to this door was through one of the
several cupboards in the room, and so cunningly had it been made
that both Douro and Ramon were always confident that short of
actually tearing the stout cupboard bodily from the wall the
aperture would never be discovered.</p>

<p>Such was the Old Regency Club when Agatha Wandsworth, now
known as Diana Montgomery, started to earn her six guineas a
week. Rather to Ramon's amusement, she had given that as her
name the first night she had come there.</p>

<p>"But why do you change your name?" he had asked. "Byron's
quite a good enough name, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Too good," she had replied coolly, "and too unusual. If
anyone brings up my father, Colonel Byron, to you and asks about
him, as my uncle you will be supposed to know all about him and
that might be awkward."</p>

<p>So, as Miss Montgomery she was always addressed, and there
was no doubt about her being an asset to the club. The men,
young and old, were always buzzing about her, and it was often
on her account only that they went down in the roulette room.
She told them she so loved watching the play and they were
nearly always willing to oblige her. She found it very
profitable, too, as almost invariably they insisted upon putting
something on for her. One night, when she had not been there a
fortnight, she was made the richer by nearly &pound;40.</p>

<p>With the women, as was natural, she was not so popular.
Still, as she never apparently took any pride in the attentions
the men gave to her, never indulged in any flirtations and was
always so modest and retiring in her demeanour, much of their
hostility towards her was disarmed and they were inclined to
take her for what she made out she was&mdash;a not-too-clever
girl, just enjoying the happiness and gaiety of life. One thing
everyone was quick to notice. There was never anything coarse
about her and she never encouraged the slightest familiarity on
anyone's part.</p>

<p>"Quite a sweet girl," remarked one woman to her friend once,
"and not a bit of a flirt. She'd quickly snub any man who said
anything to offend her."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she appears to be all that," nodded the other. She
laughed. "She's either a real little innocent or else a
calculating little schemer, and, in my mind, I can't quite make
out which."</p>

<p>Agatha was thrilled with the life. It was such an easy one.
She lived in apartments in a good-class house in Maida Vale, and
had two very nicely furnished rooms, with a bathroom attached,
the landlady providing what meals she wanted. She had made out
she was a violinist, playing in a small private
orchestra&mdash;she did not say where&mdash;and to support that
assertion invested in a second-hand violin case, which she
always kept locked. She took it with her of an evening when she
went to the Old Regency, carrying in it anything she thought she
might be requiring there.</p>

<p>She had no visitors to her apartments, and the landlady soon
fell under her charm, esteeming her not only as a very beautiful
young lady but also as a very discreet and properly behaved
one.</p>

<p>Nearly every night, or rather early morning, Ramon drove her
home in his car and dropped her at her front door. It was not
much out of his way to his flat. If he were not available, she
came home in a taxi, at the club's expense. She got up about
noon and passed the day as she chose. Sometimes she went out
somewhere to lunch and to a picture afterwards with one of her
club admirers. She liked the best of food and wines and still
enjoyed a picture as much as ever. There, however, the matter
ended, and, however ardent her escort, he never broke through
her reserve. She had become almost perfect in the art of taking
everything she could and then giving nothing in return, yet
without offending the disappointed donors. She always parted
from them with the hope in their minds they might be more
successful later.</p>

<p>Her relations with her employers were peculiar. Douro was
most kind to her and always most considerate where her wishes
were concerned. From the very beginning he had wanted to become
most friendly, and, a good-looking man, with considerable
success with the other sex, he could not understand why she
always repulsed him. He would not take in that she was, as she
told him, a woman who would hate any familiarity, let alone
intimacy, with any man.</p>

<p>"Men are only boring to me, Mr. Douro," she smiled frankly,
"and, as I informed Mr. Ellister the second time I saw him, they
simply do not interest me except for what I get out of them."
She laughed. "Accordingly, to all standards, I know I am a bad
and heartless woman, but perhaps one redeeming feature about me
is that I admit it"&mdash;she nodded&mdash;"when it suits
me."</p>

<p>"But what happiness, Mademoiselle," exclaimed Douro, "you are
missing!"</p>

<p>Agatha shrugged her shoulders. "I can't help it." She smiled
the really charming smile which won so many people to her. "I
like you, Mr. Douro, very much, but any more, in the way you men
want it&mdash;no, never."</p>

<p>She certainly did like Douro, but she had no liking at all
for Ramon; indeed, a spirit of antagonism seemed to have risen
up between them. Though he so often drove her home at night,
quite often not a word passed between them on the short journey.
At the club he was always curt and short with her, never letting
her forget he was one of her employers. Many times, when he must
have thought she was not looking, she caught him eyeing her
frowningly. He loved, too, to find fault with her.</p>

<p>"Don't you bring old Major McWhirrell down to the roulette so
often," he scowled once. "When he loses a pound he's finished
for the evening, and that's no good to us. You ought to have had
sense enough to see that."</p>

<p>"And you ought to have sense enough, too," remarked Agatha
sweetly, "to see that if I bring down only those who are able to
lose heavily people will soon tumble to what I am here for. No,
you'll have to take the little fish with the big."</p>

<p>One evening he came up to her with his usual frown. "Here,
you've been pretty thick lately with that new member, Watson,
haven't you?" he asked. "Well, have you been out with him during
the day?"</p>

<p>"Several times," nodded Agatha. "He's taken me to lunch at
the Gaiety and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need to go into details," snapped Ramon. He eyed her
intently. "Is he getting very keen on you?"</p>

<p>Agatha nodded. "Perhaps!" She smiled. "At any rate, he held
my hand much longer than he need have done when saying good-bye
on Monday, the last time he took me out."</p>

<p>"Has he asked you any questions about us here?"</p>

<p>Agatha considered. "Not unusual ones, but he was curious
about Mr. Douro and wanted to know who he was and if he had
anything to do with the management. I told him he was just a
private member and that I thought he was an official attached to
some embassy." She was interested. "But why are you asking me
about him?"</p>

<p>"Because we are all getting suspicious about him. His
credentials were certainly all right, but he seems to look about
too much. He's all eyes on every one of us and watches people as
they come in. Another member's told us, too, that when going
through Trafalgar Square on a bus he's caught sight of him three
mornings running."</p>

<p>"What's wrong in that?" asked Agatha, rather surprised.</p>

<p>"Perhaps nothing," replied Ramon grimly, "but, for all that,
Trafalgar Square is devilish close to Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"I've always thought," commented Agatha, "from the way he
carries himself, that he'd been in the army once."</p>

<p>"Or in the police," snapped Ramon. "That's what we think." He
gave Agatha her orders as if he were addressing one of the
attendants at the door. "Well, this is what you've got to do.
Next time you see him&mdash;oh, he'll be here to-night, will
he?&mdash;make yourself as friendly as possible and pump him all
you can. Make out you're in love with him"&mdash;he
sneered&mdash;"which perhaps you are. Then if the police are
really coming here, and he has anything to do with it, he may
drop a hint in some way to prevent you being drawn in." He spoke
peremptorily. "Now you understand what you've got to do?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," smiled Agatha. "If he's attached to the police I
am to make him false to his trust and perhaps ruin his whole
career." She looked amused. "Well, I don't mind at all. He's
paid for one thing and I'm paid for another. It's just a game to
me."</p>

<p>James Watson, for so he called himself, was a good-looking,
well-set-up young fellow in the middle twenties. He looked
strong and self-reliant and, in any eventuality, to be trusted.
So he undoubtedly was until he came under the spell of Agatha's
beautiful blue eyes. Then Eve looked at Adam and a bite from an
apple seemed the most wonderful thing in all the world to an
foolish man.</p>

<p>Driving Agatha home that night, Ramon remarked dryly, "Well,
I saw you had got him well in tow this evening. Did anything
happen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're lunching at Richmond to-morrow," she replied,
"and after that"&mdash;she sighed&mdash;"I suppose it'll be a
detestable walk in the park and I'll have to let him kiss me."
She spoke bitterly. "Oh, I shall be earning my money, right
enough, letting myself be petted and mauled about."</p>

<p>"You'll like it," scoffed Ramon, "and it'll do you good."</p>

<p>"Oh, will it!" retorted Agatha. "Yes, I shall like it just as
much as you would if he were kissing you. I tell you I can't
help it, but any man's kisses are hateful to me."</p>

<p>Arriving at the Old Regency the next evening, Agatha went
straight into the partner's private room. "I think you're
right," she announced, "and that he does belong to the police.
Of course, he didn't tell me so, but for some reason he was
particularly anxious I should go to see <i>The Jest of Life</i>
at the Haymarket on Saturday night and not be here."</p>

<p>"Is he going to take you?" asked Ramon.</p>

<p>"No, he says he has to be away up North for the week-end, but
he's given me two stalls so that I can go with a friend, and
he's arranged for supper for us afterwards at the Rialto. We're
to have what we want and the account goes down to him."</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Ramon. "To keep you away until well after
midnight; and we're going to be raided on the Saturday, always
our busiest night of the week, so that the police may make a big
haul." He smiled at Agatha in a way he had not done for many
weeks. "Really, it may turn out you have done us a good
service."</p>

<p>"At a price!" said Agatha coldly.</p>

<p>Douro frowned. "But I hope not too high a one?" he commented
sharply.</p>

<p>Agatha bridled. "Certainly not as high as some girls might
have had to pay, but, all the same, it was annoying enough for
me." She added spitefully, "Still, I shall get some satisfaction
when I see his face when he finds me here on Saturday."</p>

<p>"But he won't find you," said Ramon quickly. "You'll go to
that theatre as he's arranged, or, at any rate, keep well away
from here. If the raid comes off and the police find nothing
against us, that fellow mustn't learn it's due to you. It'll
make him spiteful and he'll try to catch us another time. No,
you can take a holiday on Saturday night."</p>

<p>Agatha was most disappointed. She had been gloating over the
fine revenge she thought she would be getting for the kisses she
had been obliged to submit to.</p>

<p>On the Saturday the atmosphere in the Old Regency was
undoubtedly one of suppressed excitement. The word had been
passed quietly round that there would be no roulette that night
and, perhaps, for a few nights to follow. Also, they were asked
to kindly order no drinks after eleven-thirty and to finish all
they had by midnight. Monsieur de Vallon stated he had heard it
whispered the police might be paying a visit to all the
nightclubs within the next few days or so. Of course, he smiled,
the visit would be only one of the routine ones the authorities
were bound to make from time to time. He added that perhaps it
would be a good thing for the club if those members who were
interested in the game patronised the billiard-room that night,
so that any visitors could see to what perfectly legitimate
purpose it was being put.</p>

<p>The members thrilled. Certainly it might be they had been
voyaging in dangerous waters, but to-night their vessel was safe
in harbour and from whatever quarter the wind blew they would
ride out the storm in safety. Many of them, indeed, were hoping
a storm would come.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, happened until a few minutes after
midnight, and then the attendant at the front door, opening it
to a ring, was confronted with a dozen and more of uniformed
police.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," ordered the inspector in charge
peremptorily to the apparently much-astonished doorkeeper,
"We'll go straight in. We know our way about," and, leaving two
men to guard the door, he hastened with his remaining colleagues
up through the hall. The new member, young Mr. Watson, now in
uniform, too, accompanied them.</p>

<p>They burst unceremoniously on to the dancing floor and the
inspector held up his hand for the orchestra to stop playing.
"All remain where you are, please, ladies and gentlemen," he
called out sharply. "It's no good any of you trying to get away.
The house is surrounded back and front."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Vallon came forward in smiling dignity. "No one
will want to get away, Inspector," he said most politely. "They
have no reason to. This place is properly conducted and we do
not infringe the law." He threw out his hands. "The whole house
is open to you. There is nothing locked"&mdash;he corrected
himself quickly and raised one long forefinger in
emphasis&mdash;"except, of course, the bar, which is always
locked at midnight."</p>

<p>"Ah, of course!" nodded the inspector sarcastically. He made
a motion with his arm to three of the accompanying police.
"Still, you Henderson, Wicks and Jones, see what these ladies
and gentlemen are drinking."</p>

<p>Leaving the dancers to be looked over by the three officers
mentioned, the inspector and the rest of the police, guided by
Watson, made their way quickly into the basement. Provided for
all eventualities, one was carrying a big hammer and a crowbar,
to, if necessary, break down any hindering doors.</p>

<p>The usual attendant was stationed at the beginning of the
long passage leading to the billiard-room, but to-night it
almost seemed he had been sleeping in his chair. He blinked his
eyes stupidly and in great surprise as the little posse of
police avalanched themselves upon him.</p>

<p>"Hold that man, one of you," called out the inspector and he
hurled open the first swing doors. Those opening into the
billiard-room were soon reached and the policeman with the crow-bar
sprang forward. It was at once realised, however, that his
services would not be needed. Certainly, there was no handle on
the outside of the inner door, but it was not shut and only
pushed to. The murmur of conversation could be heard and also
the unmistakable clicking of billiard balls.</p>

<p>The police swept into the room. It was well thronged with
members who had been engaged in watching an exciting match
between two of the champion players of the club. They looked
round in astonishment, not unmixed with some amusement, too, at
the interrupters.</p>

<p>"All remain where you are," ordered the inspector in the same
stern tones as he had done upstairs. "The house is surrounded
and none of you can get away." His eyes roved quickly round and
then he turned frowningly to Agatha's great admirer, who was
close on his heels. "This is the room," he growled, "isn't
it?"</p>

<p>The young man's face was white and angry. "It's the room all
right," he scowled, "but the roulette table's been moved. It was
at that end where those big armchairs are."</p>

<p>"Then they've been warned," whispered back the inspector
hoarsely. "We'll not find anything now." But, for all that, he
ordered a thorough search to be made both for any gambling
paraphernalia and concealed exits from the room. Nothing,
however, of an incriminating nature was found, and the inspector
and his assistants returned frowningly upstairs, where the
officers left there, stated they had found everything in
order.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Vallon came forward again. "Is there any other
way I can assist you, Inspector?" he asked suavely, with his
face all smiles.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll take the names and addresses of everyone here,"
grunted the inspector sourly.</p>

<p>One of the members, however, at once spoke up. "No, no,
Inspector, you can't do that," he said sharply. "You are
exceeding your duty there. You can't demand our names unless you
have good grounds for believing we are breaking the law, and
there is no suggestion of that to-night. Certainly, you can ask
our names and we can give them if we like. Here's mine," and he
handed him the card of a well-known King's Counsel.</p>

<p>There was no help for it and the mortified inspector had to
withdraw with his men. Outside in the street he turned savagely
upon Watson. "You've blundered somewhere," he scowled. "It must
be you, as you know quite well that a couple of hours ago only
you, the Chief and I knew the raid was going to be made. Yes,
you've blundered badly."</p>

<p>The other could offer no explanation, but he wondered
guiltily if his association with Agatha had had anything to do
with it.</p>

<p>The following afternoon, the day being Sunday, Agatha had not
gone out. She was reading in her sitting-room, when the young
maidservant of the house knocked at the door and ushered in
Ramon. Agatha was most surprised, as, by tacit arrangement, he
had never set foot in the house before. To her even greater
astonishment, he appeared to be most amiable.</p>

<p>"I've brought you this," he said smilingly, and, opening his
pocket-book, he produced and handed to her two &pound;5 notes. "A
little present," he went on, "for the services you've rendered
to us. They came last night, about twenty of them, but went off
later with their tails very much between their legs."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Watson come with them?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, as bold as brass; but when they didn't find
anything I don't think I've ever seen any man look more sick.
The inspector in charge must have been furious with him for
having brought them on a fool's errand. Yes, Diana, we're very
pleased with you."</p>

<p>Then&mdash;without giving her the very slightest warning of
his intention&mdash;he suddenly seized hold of her and, crushing
her to him, began kissing her fast and furiously upon the lips.
She could not break away. One of his arms was round her neck,
pressing her face close to his, and the other gripped her so
tightly that she could not disengage her hands to defend
herself. She tried to struggle, but very quickly realised it was
quite hopeless and lay limp and passive in his embrace.</p>

<p>He stopped kissing her only when he was out of breath. Then
he let her go and she sprang back as if released from a spring.
Snatching up a handkerchief, she darted over to a bowl of roses
on the table and, plunging the handkerchief into the water,
began laving fiercely over her lips. She took mouthful after
mouthful of the water and spat it out on to the carpet.</p>

<p>Ramon smiled triumphantly. "Now what do you think of me?" he
asked, but he had to wait for her reply until she had finished
her ablutions and was wiping her mouth with a dry corner of the
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Only what I did before," she panted, "that you are worse
that any animal. Your kissing me made me feel downright sick."
She shook her head in disgust. "You've had fish, too, for your
last meal. I could smell it."</p>

<p>Ramon reddened furiously. Then, before he could do anything
to prevent it, she had moved over to the wall and pressed a
bell-push there.</p>

<p>"Here, what are you doing?" he asked angrily. "What are you
ringing the bell for?"</p>

<p>She had now recovered her breath and replied quite calmly,
"Only that I have a message to give the maid." She looked icily
at him. "Don't make an exhibition of yourself before her."</p>

<p>The girl was quick in answering the ring and appeared almost
at once. "Yes, Miss?" she said.</p>

<p>Agatha indicated Ramon. "If this man calls again, Mary," she
said very quietly, "you are to tell him I'm not in. You
understand, I am never in when he comes?"</p>

<p>The girl looked rather scared. "Yes, Miss, I'll tell
him."</p>

<p>"Then show him out at once," said Agatha.</p>

<p>Uncomfortable at the so obviously off-hand manner in which
the well-dressed visitor was being referred to, the young girl
stood waiting nervously, but Ramon made no move to go. Instead,
he settled himself down comfortably in an armchair, looking very
amused. "Ha, ha, Miss Montgomery will have her little joke,
Mary. She'll ring again when she really wants you," and to
Agatha's annoyance, now greatly relieved, the girl smilingly
withdrew, closing the door after her.</p>

<p>Instantly Ramon's smiling face turned to one of fierce anger.
"I'll discharge you for that, young woman," he snarled. "We've
finished with you from this very minute."</p>

<p>"But you can't discharge me," smiled Agatha sweetly. "When
you went into partnership with Mr. Douro the agreement was that
neither partner could discharge any employee without the consent
of the other."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you two have been discussing me, have you?"
demanded Ramon with a scowl.</p>

<p>"But not for any particular reason," replied Agatha
carelessly. "Mr. Douro just happened to mention it one evening
when you had been finding fault with me more than usual and
giving me plenty of your pleasing scowls." She scoffed. "Do you
imagine everyone hasn't noticed how unfriendly you've been
lately?" She shrugged her shoulders. "Not that it affects me in
the very least, as I certainly don't intend to remain much
longer with you. A gentleman I know thinks he can get me tried
out for the films."</p>

<p>Ramon changed his tune at once. "Look here, girl," he said,
"haven't you any intuition? What do you think I kissed you for
just now?"</p>

<p>"Because, I suppose, you're a male animal," replied Agatha
cuttingly, "and I'm a female one, that's all."</p>

<p>Ramon smiled. "You're a devilish pretty one, anyhow." He
burst out fiercely. "No, Diana, I kissed you because I love you.
I love you as I've never loved any woman before." He shook his
head angrily. "I never thought I should ever love any woman. I
didn't think I had such a thing as love in me, but I love you
passionately, and that is why I have come here to see you now. I
want you to become my wife. I want to marry you straightaway,
to-morrow if you will."</p>

<p>For the moment Agatha was altogether too amazed to speak, and
she just stood still staring at him as if she could not believe
her ears.</p>

<p>Her silence irritated him. "Don't you hear me, Diana? Don't
you understand what I say?"</p>

<p>"I hear," she replied coldly, "but I can't say I understand."
She nodded slowly. "So your rudeness to me all these weeks meant
that you had fallen in love with me, your continual
faultfinding, your black looks and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My black looks were for myself," he interrupted. "I was
furious that I had fallen into the pit"&mdash;his face broke
into a smile&mdash;-"but I found I couldn't help it, and I'm not
going to fight against it any more. I realise there will be no
happiness for me without you." He spoke masterfully. "Come,
Diana, you'll have to marry me. I'll make you a good
husband."</p>

<p>"You never could," she scoffed, "any more than I could make
you a good wife. We are both too selfish and would care only for
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he retorted. "We should learn to give and take.
We should get on right enough once we were tied up. We have so
many ways in common."</p>

<p>She snapped angrily, "But haven't I already told you I
dislike men?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" laughed Ramon. "That's only a pose because you've not
been wakened up yet. Lots of women imagine that until they meet
the right man."</p>

<p>"And you're certainly not the right man for me," she said.
Then, feeling the pain of her bruised lips, she added, to annoy
him, "Of the men I know now, I'd marry Mr. Douro a hundred times
in preference to you. At least he's not got your cruel
nature."</p>

<p>Ramon frowned angrily. He knew quite well what his partner's
feelings for her were and that she had only to lift her little
finger and Douro would marry her at once. "But I'll never let
you marry him," he said fiercely, "or anyone else either. You'll
marry me or no one, and just you take that in."</p>

<p>He left her presently and, driving away in his car, was not
altogether dissatisfied with the interview. Certainly, she had
repulsed him as bitterly and unpleasantly as she could, but he
told himself that when she came to think things over she would
see matters in a different light. Hitherto all his experience of
the other sex had taught him that a woman loved her master. He
knew, too, he must have hurt her with his savage kisses, but
then&mdash;were not some sensations of pain very much akin to
those of pleasure; and probably, therefore, his very roughness
might have stirred her as no gentleness would have done.</p>

<p>He frowned uneasily, however, when he remembered her
reference to Douro. There might possibly be danger there! With
all his strength and hardness in other ways, Douro was a rank
sentimentalist where women were concerned, and the girl might be
imagining she had found in him the weak slave she wanted. The
danger was the greater because he was aware Douro would be able
to give her all she wanted in the way of money. Douro had made
quite a small fortune lately by a lucky purchase of mining
shares.</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. Apart from regarding Douro as a possible
rival where the girl was concerned, he was angry about him in
other ways. The man was losing his nerve! He had been frightened
about the butler whose life he, Ramon, had had to take when they
were robbing Bentham Hall, and he had been frightened again
about the professor's death and at first had not wanted to help
in the disposal of the body. Another thing, too, he had refused
to have any part in a deal where more than &pound;3,000 worth of
stolen forbidden drugs had been in the market for &pound;500. He,
Ramon again, left in the lurch, had had to carry through the
matter on his own.</p>

<p>Ramon frowned heavily as he drove along. There was another
matter now annoying him, too. As she had threatened she would
do, Braddock's mother had reported her son's disappearance to
the police and had lied in stating to them that he had been a
great friend of Ramon's once, but was sure there had been some
fierce quarrel between them.</p>

<p>Anyhow, a rather nasty-eyed police inspector had been to
interview Ramon at his flat and had asked a lot of searching
questions. Ramon was not altogether certain that his replies to
the questions had satisfied the inspector, as the latter had
called subsequently at his office in the city and asked some of
the questions over again. Of course, Ramon told himself, the
police could have nothing against him, but, for all that, it was
unpleasant to have been brought in contact with them at all.</p>

<p>But if, when Agatha and he had parted, Ramon had his annoying
thoughts, so had Agatha hers. She was certainly amazed that he
was wanting to marry her and not a little thrilled that she now
had it in her power to exasperate him by refusing. For all that,
however, it was most inopportune he should be paying attention
to her, for that meant he would be watching her, and that was
the last thing she was wanting then.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks previously she had come to know a young
fellow at the night-club, almost, it seemed, quite a boy. He was
Peter Wardale and he had been greatly taken with her at once. He
would have danced every dance with her had she let him. At first
she had had no interest in him except to get him down as often
as she could to the roulette room, so that he could put
something on for her. She had soon found, however, that he was
not well supplied with money and, accordingly, was on the point
of shelving him for wealthier victims when, agreeing rather
reluctantly to let him take her to lunch one day, he confided
his circumstances to her, and her attitude towards him
immediately underwent a great change.</p>

<p>He told her he was an only child and his father was dead. He
had for guardian an uncle, who was the senior partner of a big
firm of solicitors in the city. This uncle was very stern and
strict, and, purposely kept him very short of money, never
giving him a penny more than the small allowance which his dead
father had arranged for him to have until he came of age. If it
were not for his mother, who was devoted to him and often,
against his guardian's wishes, supplemented his allowance, he
would always be very hard up.</p>

<p>However, things would be quite different in a little less
than a month to-morrow. Then he would be twenty-one and come
into a large inheritance, including Wardale Court, a beautiful
old-world residence near Esher, only fifteen miles from London.
He would be able to do just as he liked and&mdash;he squeezed
Agatha's hand here&mdash;marry whom he wanted to.</p>

<p>A great thrill had surged through Agatha and she had modestly
lowered her lovely eyes. Here, perhaps, was the very husband she
had been looking for! He would be wealthy, he was so obviously
of a weak and foolish character, and he would be easily led!</p>

<p>She would encourage him all she could, but make him keep
everything from his people until it was too late for them to
interfere. She had a great awe of lawyers, and, above all
things, this strict guardian of his must learn nothing. If he
did he would certainly ask awkward questions about her family,
and she was shrewd enough to realise she would not be able to
satisfy him with her replies.</p>

<p>With her mind made up that he was a most suitable match, she
had been going out quite a lot with him, lunching at the less
expensive restaurants two and three times a week, letting him
take her for drives in the country and even permitting kisses on
a restricted scale.</p>

<p>He quickly succumbed to her charms and was soon very much in
love; one day, at his ardent urging, she consented to become
engaged to him, with the arrangement, however, that no public
mention of it was to be made until his twenty-first birthday.
Then, with them both being of age, they would be married
immediately after.</p>

<p>This, then, was the position on that Sunday when Ramon had
made his offer of marriage to her, and Agatha thought it was a
very awkward one. She knew Ramon was of a most masterful
disposition and would not easily be put off anything when he had
once made up his mind. Above all things, he must not get to know
how friendly she had become with Peter and how often she had
been meeting him.</p>

<p>If, however, she was thinking the position awkward that
afternoon, she thought it much worse on the Monday evening when
she arrived at the Old Regency.</p>

<p>Ramon met her smilingly and said at once, "Young Wardale rang
me up from his home this afternoon asking me, as your uncle, to
give you the message that he wouldn't be able to be here to-night.
He's also asked me to drive you down to-morrow to lunch
at Wardale Court."</p>

<p>Agatha's heart bumped unpleasantly, but she asked coolly
enough, "Oh, how did that come about?"</p>

<p>"Well, I happened to say I'd often passed the Court and
thought what a beautiful place it looked. He said it was
beautiful and that I must come down to see it one day. Then a
few minutes later he rang up again to say his mother would be
very pleased if we'd both come to lunch, and he mentioned
to-morrow. I accepted; so, of course, we'll go."</p>

<p>"But I'm not too keen," said Agatha with a frown.</p>

<p>"Well, I am," snapped Ramon. "They've got two Ravencross
goblets there and I should like to see where they're kept.
They'd be worth a good &pound;1,000 and I could dispose of them easily
in the States." He nodded. "You might be able to help me
there."</p>

<p>Driving down to Esher the next day, Ramon was bright and
chatty and Agatha, though on tenterhooks that Peter might show
himself too friendly to her and give everything away, responded
to his mood as if there had never been the slightest
unpleasantness between them. He made no reference to what had
happened on Sunday until entering the drive to Wardale Court,
and then, as he took in the beautiful surroundings, he remarked
thoughtfully, "Ah, this young man might have done for you,
Diana, if you had not been already bespoken."</p>

<p>Agatha made no comment.</p>

<p>The luncheon party was a small one. Besides Peter and his
mother there was a cousin, Beryl Wardale, quite a pretty girl of
nineteen and of a quiet and very natural disposition. Mrs.
Wardale was a gentle, elderly woman with beautiful silver hair
and very soft brown eyes. Suffering from her heart, she looked
frail and, indeed, was more or less an invalid. There was no
doubt she admired Agatha. During the whole course of the meal
she hardly took her eyes off her except to transfer them to her
son, and then, Agatha thought with an uneasy qualm, there was a
rather anxious expression on her face. She learnt afterwards
from Peter that there was a reason for it, as for a long time he
and Beryl had been supposed to be sweethearts.</p>

<p>Peter behaved very discreetly until after lunch, but then was
obviously a little too eager to show Agatha over the large
estate which so soon was going to be his. However, she took good
care to see that Beryl came with them.</p>

<p>Ramon was left to talk to Mrs. Wardale. He was all eyes for
the portable valuables of the house, but, though noting the much
admired goblets in their glass cabinet, took good care not to
refer to them.</p>

<p>Certainly Agatha's appearance had made a good impression on
the mother, and in the absence of the young people from the
house she complimented Ramon upon the loveliness of his
niece.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she is rather good-looking," smiled Ramon, and
then, as if to reassure Mrs. Wardale, he added, "But she takes
no interest in the other sex. I tell her she'll have to marry
one day, but she always says she intends to be an old maid. The
worst of it is she is quite well off, and that makes her very
independent and prefer to live her own life."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wardale seemed comforted and showed it later by the
kindly way in which she spoke to Agatha. "And you must come and
see us again, Miss Montgomery," she said in parting. "You
haven't seen the deer at the other end of the park. We have some
lovely little fawns," and Beryl to whom Agatha had tactfully
paid much attention, warmly seconded the invitation.</p>

<p>Driving back to town, Ramon remarked thoughtfully, "Yes, you
must cultivate that young man up to a point. I know where I can
lay my hands upon two very good imitations of those goblets, and
you might get the opportunity of changing the real ones for
them. The old woman would not know the difference. It was her
husband who collected pretty things." Agatha said nothing,
privately determining, however, that the real goblets should
remain where they were. Already she considered they belonged
her.</p>

<p>Meeting Peter, by quickly whispered arrangement, for lunch
the next day, he was very enthusiastic about how pretty his
mother had thought her. "She'll come round very quickly directly
we're definitely engaged," he said. "It's all nonsense her
wanting to make out I'm keen on Beryl. I never have been."</p>

<p>The following week he drove Agatha down to the Court for
lunch again, as a surprise for his mother, he said. Agatha had
been reluctant to go, but he had pleaded so hard that in the end
she had consented. She had been afraid that if she went against
his wishes so early it might weaken her hold upon him.</p>

<p>However, arriving at the Court, she very much regretted
having given in, as the lawyer uncle had unexpectedly come upon
a short visit. He eyed Agatha very intently and it required all
her strength of will not to appear nervous. Certainly, he was
most polite to her, but in a casual, roundabout way he asked her
more questions about herself than she was prepared to answer.
Still, she thought she fenced with him pretty well and hoped
that her short replies would be put down to a reserved and
independent nature.</p>

<p>As upon her previous visit, she took care she should not be
alone with Peter for a moment. Also, she talked such a lot to
Beryl that it seemed she was much more interested in her than in
the heir to the Wardale properties. Anticipating what would
happen when he returned home, during the drive back to town she
coached Peter most carefully what to say to any questions asked
about her by his uncle.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," she said, "they'll try to put you off me
and you must be very tactful not to offend your uncle or let him
see you are unusually interested in me. Whatever you do don't
get into a temper or you're certain to give everything away.
Remember we've less than three weeks to wait now, and then
everybody can know everything."</p>

<p>At the end of the three weeks she was referring to, Mrs.
Wardale was giving a big dinner-party to celebrate Peter's
coming of age. Of course Agatha had not been asked, but she had
arranged with Peter that, two days before, he was to tell his
mother he had himself invited her and her uncle.</p>

<p>"You must ask Mr. Ellister as well," she had said, "so that
it won't look as pointed as it would if I were coming alone.
Then, on your birthday morning, you can go into your mother's
room and tell her, privately, we are engaged. It mustn't come to
her as a complete surprise when everyone else is told. That
wouldn't look nice, and, besides, if you tell her beforehand it
will give her time to get over any disappointment about your not
choosing your cousin." Then Peter had thought that surely never
could any girl have looked more beautiful as she had added
blushingly, "You can tell our great secret to all the others
when they are all together at the same time&mdash;if you
like&mdash;at the dinner that night."</p>

<p>Agatha imagined she was being very clever there, as she
wanted Ramon to hear the news when he could not make a scene.
She knew he would not dare to lose his temper before everyone,
and she meant to take good care she would not be giving him any
opportunity of speaking to her privately later.</p>

<p>As she had anticipated, Peter's uncle tackled him at once
when he got back home.</p>

<p>"What are you going about with that girl for?" he asked
frowningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like her," replied Peter. "She's very good
company."</p>

<p>"But what are your intentions?" went on the lawyer. "Are you
making love to her?"</p>

<p>Peter laughed. "Did it look like it?" He shook his head. "She
doesn't seem to me to be the kind of girl who lets any man make
love to her to amuse himself and just pass the time."</p>

<p>"Well, you mind your steps," warned his uncle. "What do you
know about her? Who are her people?"</p>

<p>"She has no father or mother and I've not met any of her
people except her uncle. Hasn't Mother told you about him? He's
been here to lunch. He's Mr. Ramon Ellister, a stockbroker in
the city."</p>

<p>His uncle was still frowning. "I've never heard of him. Where
did you meet the girl?"</p>

<p>"At a friend's house," replied Peter. He smiled. "Isn't she
pretty enough for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's pretty enough," grunted the uncle, "but that's not
everything. Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"She's got a flat somewhere in Maida Vale."</p>

<p>The lawyer's eyes opened wide. "Have you been there?"</p>

<p>Peter laughed. "No, she's never asked me."</p>

<p>His uncle nodded significantly. "Well, you just look out.
She's the very type of girl to make fools of boys like you."
Peter duly reported the conversation to Agatha and she seemed
quite satisfied. She was sure things were going on all right.
She was thrilled with the idea of becoming the mistress of
Wardale Court, with its beautiful appointments and set like a
lovely jewel in the glorious old park. It was a miracle, she
kept on repeating to herself, that such a wonderful future
should be unfolding itself before one who such a little time ago
had been that friendless little servant-girl.</p>

<p>She would, however, have lost much of her equanimity had she
only known what had been going on behind the scenes, for,
although at a dead end for the moment, Larose had never lost
confidence that he would ultimately track down the pretty
assistant of the library in Norwich and find out who and where
she was.</p>

<p>At first it had certainly seemed that all trace of her had
been lost when she could not be found at the address given in
Romfort Road. Still, by no means disheartened, Larose had gone
back to the Norwich librarian and enquired how the latter had
first come to engage her.</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you that," said the librarian at once, "for
of course we keep all the references of successful applicants
for positions here," but when he came to look for Agatha's, to
his great surprise, hers could not be found.</p>

<p>"Now that's very extraordinary," he exclaimed, "for hers
should be among these! You see I have all the others." He looked
very troubled. "Someone must have deliberately taken Miss
Byron's away."</p>

<p>"What had she been before she came here?" asked Larose. "You
must be able to remember that."</p>

<p>"Certainly I can! She was in charge of a big lending library
in some London suburb. Now let me see. Where was it? Let me
think a moment."</p>

<p>But the thinking of many moments could not recall the
particular suburb to the librarian's mind, and after quite a
good while he had to give it up. "Never mind," he said
confidently, "it'll all come back to me one day. My memory often
plays me tricks like that. I shall remember it all at once and
then I'll telephone you." An idea came to him. "Ah, but some of
the other members of the staff may be able to tell you."</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that no help was to come from them.
Miss Byron had been a very reserved young woman and they knew
nothing about her. She had made no friends and confided in no
one.</p>

<p>Larose was most disappointed, as it was through the girl he
had been hoping to get a line on Ramon Ellister's activities. He
always argued that when a man worked alone in criminal ways he
was more difficult to uncover than when he worked with others.
He was sure everything pointed to the man and the girl having
been accomplices in the theft of the page from the book, and the
sudden disappearance of the latter from Norwich, he was
confident, meant she was working with Ellister again.</p>

<p>At a dead end as far as the girl was concerned, he determined
to concentrate at once upon Ellister. The commodore had been
keeping a vigilant eye upon what had been happening to the house
on the Gap, and had found out that, going to stay there almost
at once after the sale, Ramon and Douro had only remained there
three days, and then had shut up the house and gone away,
apparently for good, as they had not been back since.</p>

<p>"And the second day they were here," said the commodore,
looking very amused, "they were seen driving back from Norwich
with a long ladder strapped on to one of the footboards in their
car, which evidently meant they had not found the secret way
down into the vaults and had had to break through the flooring
in one of the rooms." He chuckled. "I shall regret all my life I
didn't see the look on their faces when they found Francesco's
grave had been already opened."</p>

<p>"But we can never be certain," commented Larose, "they would
have realised it had been opened so recently. They may have
thought it had been done hundreds of years ago."</p>

<p>The commodore laughed merrily, but did not explain why. He
did not think Larose would altogether approve of his having dug
up Braddock's body from where his cousin had buried it and
reinterred it in Francesco's grave to give the murderers the
shock of their lives. He told himself he had better keep that
joke to himself.</p>

<p>Giving up all expectation of linking up the girl in the
library with Ramon Ellister until he received the promised
telephone message from the head librarian. Larose proceeded to
hark back to the burglary at Bentham Hall in the previous March,
when, among other valuables, the old manuscript dealing with the
life of Father Francesco had been stolen.</p>

<p>After paying a visit to Printing House Square and consulting
the files of <i>The Times</i> to refresh his memory with the
details of all that had taken place, he next drove round to
Scotland Yard and interviewed Chief Inspector Charles Stone,
with whom he had worked so many years when in the Criminal
Investigation Department.</p>

<p>The stout inspector seemed no different in appearance from
what he had been in days gone by, and his big, heavy face was
all smiles when Larose came into his room.</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly and Larose explained what he wanted.
"Is there anything you can tell me about that burglary,
Charlie," he asked, "which is not public property and has not
been in the newspapers? You never got the ghost of a clue, did
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't exactly say that," replied Stone. "We got
several clues, though they certainly didn't lead anywhere. For
instance, for one thing we were always pretty sure the burglars
were known quite well to that poor devil of a butler who got
killed. I mean that he had recognised them and that's why he had
to die."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"By the injuries he had received. Two dreadful blows had been
struck on his head, almost certainly with a knuckle-duster, and
whoever struck the first blow must have known instantly it had
been effective enough to knock the man out for many, many hours,
at any rate for long enough to let them get hundreds of miles
away before he would be able to call for help or even moan." The
inspector shook his head slowly. "But no, the murderer wasn't
satisfied and he came back to the poor chap, after an interval
of minutes so the post-mortem showed, and struck
again&mdash;this time an even more dreadful blow. He had no
intention that the butler should ever speak again."</p>

<p>"But how could the killer have been sure," asked Larose,
"that the first blow would have kept the butler unconscious for
such a long time?"</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders. "Common sense would
have told him that, my son. The knuckle-duster had dented the
forehead right in."</p>

<p>"And did you surmise anything else?" was Larose's next
question.</p>

<p>"Yes. One of those taking part in the burglary had had access
to the home only a little while before it had been carried out,
because he had monkeyed with the bolt of one of the windows of a
small passage, the usual stunt of taking the screws out and
filing the threads so that they had no grip. That's how they got
in, and they evidently thought they would get away with it, as
they had put back the screws, very carefully."</p>

<p>"Then it wouldn't have been one of the servants who let them
in?"</p>

<p>"Not unless the screw business was a blind, and we don't
think it was because upon the head of one of the screws there
was a faint dried smear and the scrapings, under the microscope,
turned out to be quite recent blood. Whose blood, of course, we
shall never know, but we presume it came off the knuckle-duster
used upon the murdered man."</p>

<p>"Well, about those who had recently had, as you call it,
access to the house," asked Larose, "did you find that a pretty
big order?"</p>

<p>The inspector sighed. "A very big one, for, apart from the
family and the twelve servants, there was a large number of
tradesmen to be considered. Only the month before there had been
some alterations made to the house and part of it had been
redecorated. Oh, yes, there were masons and plasterers and
paper-hangers and other tradesmen to be examined and we were
never sure we had got the lot."</p>

<p>"And that's all you can tell me?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Stone nodded. "That's all, Gilbert." He grinned. "But what
have you come nosing round for? Have you any idea about
anything?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded back. "Yes, Charlie, I have, and you shall know
all about it later on. I've got my eye on a party"&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;"from information received, but I want to be quite
certain about him first."</p>

<p>Bidding good-bye to the inspector, Larose at once proceeded
to ring up Sir Jeremy Rollison at Bentham Hall, but learnt that
he and all his family were from home, motoring on the Continent,
and would not be back for a month or six weeks. The Hall was
practically shut up, as it had been given over to caretakers and
a firm of contractors who were installing a new and extensive
drainage system.</p>

<p>Larose was greatly disappointed, but there was no help for it
and he would have to wait. So, not being able to get in touch
with Sir Jeremy and hearing nothing from the Norwich librarian,
a whole six weeks went by with no progress being made in the
matters of either Ramon or Agatha.</p>

<p>When at last, however, Sir Jeremy did return, Larose lost not
a day in calling upon him and explaining his reason for doing
so. He had already some slight acquaintance with the knight,
having met him a few times at Agricultural Shows, and made the
excuse he was now approaching him so many weeks after the
burglary because the idea had just come to him that perhaps some
friends of the family might have been indiscreet and talked too
much outside about the value of the old silver.</p>

<p>"When I was at the Yard," he explained, "we found that so
often happened. Visitors to a house went home and spoke in front
of strangers or, even perhaps, their own servants about where
the burglar alarms were or things like that, putting ideas into
people's minds. Now, I suppose you entertain a lot of visitors
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," replied Sir Jeremy. "You see, I've got a family
just growing up and they're always inviting their friends."</p>

<p>"Well, can you think of any of them," asked Larose, "who are
big talkers?"</p>

<p>The knight was very amused, thinking Larose was still
obsessed with the work of his old calling and unable to shake
off the suspicions of his detective days. Still, he was most
polite and produced a diary in which he had been in the habit of
jotting down the names of all the visitors who came to the
house.</p>

<p>"I want only recent ones," said Larose, "only those who were
here during the preceding few weeks."</p>

<p>Sir Jeremy nodded and proceeded to read aloud a number of
names, among which Larose was not the least surprised to hear
that of Ramon Ellister. However, he let Sir Jeremy read right
down to the end of the list and then appeared very disappointed
the knight could not fix upon anyone who in his opinion might
have been dangerous.</p>

<p>Sir Jeremy had a good laugh when Larose had gone. "A nice
fellow," he said to his wife, "but a very simple-minded one. I
can't understand how he earned the reputation he had."</p>

<p>Leaving Bentham Hall, Larose immediately rang up Inspector
Stone on the latter's private line. "See here, Charlie," he
said, "at last I think I've got something for you, and I want to
bring a friend to see you to-morrow. We'll be telling a tale
that will make you open your eyes."</p>

<p>"Good! They want opening," laughed the inspector. "In regard
to that little matter we were talking about when I last saw you
they are still as blind as a new-born kitten's."</p>

<p>"But first," went on Larose, "between now and to-morrow, say
at eleven o'clock, I want you to find out if anyone in the Yard
has ever heard anything about a Mr. Ramon Ellister, a
stockbroker in the city&mdash;anything, mind you, however
trivial. Of course keep the matter very quiet."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Stone. He laughed. "I won't even tell my
missis."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a if="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; HOT ON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night Larose had a long conversation with
Commodore Smith in a London hotel and, after having told him
about his interview with Sir Jeremy that morning, went on
emphatically. "But see here, Commodore, we're making no headway
and really only just marking time. This business has become too
big for us to handle ourselves and so I've decided we must go to
Scotland Yard and put down our cards."</p>

<p>"All of them?" queried the commodore uneasily.</p>

<p>Larose frowned. "Not all of them. I don't see why we should
mention about your cousin having shot and buried that man. It
wouldn't strengthen the case against Ellister, and, besides, it
might make things unpleasant for you and me"&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;"especially me. They'll say that I, at least, ought
to have known better and not connived at keeping the matter from
the police."</p>

<p>"But I don't think we did wrong," said the commodore. "After
all, it was my cousin's secret, and surely we weren't bound to
give him away!"</p>

<p>"In one way that's true," agreed Larose, "because, as we
argued that night, any disclosure as to the way in which that
fellow with the knuckle-duster had met his death would have made
things very dangerous for the professor. Of course the dead
man's accomplices would have gone for their revenge." He spoke
briskly. "No, we won't say anything about that. We've got good
enough cards to put down"&mdash;he smiled again&mdash;"without
producing that ace of spades."</p>

<p>"Well, how are you going to approach the police?" asked the
commodore.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're coming with me to headquarters to-morrow,"
replied Larose, "to have a good yarn with my old friend and
colleague, Chief Inspector Stone. I've made the appointment for
eleven o'clock. I've already been to see him, and he'll know
we're coming about Ramon Ellister, as I rang him this afternoon
and asked him to find out if the police had ever heard of the
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Do you think they have?" asked the commodore.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, I shouldn't think so, for, as far
as I can find out, he's got quite a good reputation in the city
and is doing a bona-fide business there as a stockbroker. Still,
that counts for nothing. In the history of crime most of the big
criminals have been, apparently, living most respectable
lives."</p>

<p>"And this Inspector Stone," asked the commodore, "he's a
sharp man?"</p>

<p>"Sharp man?" exclaimed Larose. "Good gracious, yes! He's
about the sharpest man they've got at the Yard. He's big and
heavy to look at and mayn't give the impression of being too
brainy, but the Lord help the man he's questioning if the chap's
got anything to hide." He nodded. "Yes, you'll have to step very
carefully with him, and mind you don't say a word too much.
Better let me do most of the talking."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's got implicit trust in you," said the
commodore.</p>

<p>"Up to a point," laughed Larose, "but he knows I'm no
stickler for red tape and, to keep out that shooting business, I
shall have to walk every bit as warily as you. We've always been
the greatest of friends, but, for all that, he was often
suspicious of me when I was up at the Yard. It was always his
grievance I was mistaking justice for law."</p>

<p>The following morning Inspector Stone received the commodore
most politely. "Glad to make your acquaintance, sir," he
said&mdash;his eyes twinkled&mdash;"though you do arrive in
rather bad company. When Mr. Larose here was my colleague he was
often something of a worry to me because of his lack of respect
for authority. I could not get him to take in he was not the
Lord Chief Justice but only a common policeman." His face
sobered down to stern, severe lines. "Well, what's the tale
you're got to tell me?"</p>

<p>"But first," said Larose, "have you found the Yard knows
anything of this Ramon Ellister?"</p>

<p>"Just a little," nodded the inspector, "but nothing to make
it necessary for us to keep our eyes on him. A little while ago
a Guildford woman came to ask us to make enquiries about her
missing son. She said he had been a friend of Ellister and she
believed Ellister knew where he was, though he wouldn't tell
her. One of our men interviewed Ellister, who stated the missing
man was only an acquaintance and not a friend. He denied all
knowledge of his movements."</p>

<p>"Who was the man?" asked the commodore, and Larose swore
under his breath at him putting the question.</p>

<p>Stone reached for a slip of paper in one of the pigeon-holes
of his desk and scanned down it. "Braddock was his name," he
said, "Eden Braddock." He looked shrewdly at the commodore.
"Ever heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" began the commodore. "He was&mdash;&mdash;" But
Larose interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Commodore," he said. "That had better come in
its proper place in our story. It'll want such a lot of
unnecessary explanation if we tell about it now."</p>

<p>"Well, what is this story you've got for me?" asked Stone,
again looking from one to the other of his visitors.</p>

<p>"I'd better tell it," said Larose, "because I came into the
trouble first."</p>

<p>"Trouble, eh?" exclaimed Stone with a frown. "Then you're in
trouble, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, we're not," replied Larose, "but someone else is, and we
hope you'll be able to make it much heavier for him." He spoke
quickly. "It's about that Professor Mildmay of the Gap House in
Norfolk we've come to tell you."</p>

<p>Stone nodded. "I know&mdash;the eccentric professor who
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he disappeared right enough," nodded Larose with a
grim smile. "He was murdered."</p>

<p>"Murdered!" ejaculated the inspector, with his eyes opened
very wide. "Who by?"</p>

<p>"That Ramon Ellister, or, at any rate, if he himself did not
actually commit the murder, he was involved in the crime."</p>

<p>"Have you found the body?" snapped Stone.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No! But, if you don't mind you'd
better hear the whole story before questioning us. It begins
about the middle of last May when the professor called upon me
to ask my advice," and briefly and quickly he proceeded to
relate all that the professor had told him up to the moment when
the professor had recognised in the man he had seen coming out
of the Royal Hotel in Norwich the woman who only two days before
had tried to get taken on as housekeeper at the Gap House.</p>

<p>"That was the climax of everything," said Larose, "and made
him come to me at once. Living in so lonely a situation, he was
rather fearful as to how far those men would go to get what they
evidently imagined was hidden in the house or below it."</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell what had happened the night after he
had stayed with the professor, how some strangers had knocked at
the door very late and, being denied admittance, had gone all
round the house, testing the fastenings of the windows to see if
there was anywhere where they could force their way in.
Ultimately, he said, they had gone away. He mentioned nothing
about the shooting and passed quickly to his second visit to the
house about a week later, when he had found the commodore had
just arrived to keep his cousin company.</p>

<p>Then he came to the tragedy of the professor's murder, and
how when he, Larose, had arrived post haste in response to the
urgent phone call of the commodore, they had found the body had
been taken away.</p>

<p>The inspector frowned heavily when Larose came to that part
of the story and interrupted at once to question the
commodore.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand, Commodore," he said very sternly,
"why, when you found your cousin's body and saw he had been so
brutally murdered, you didn't instantly ring up the police. What
was your motive in only ringing up Mr. Larose and wasting such
valuable time? Mr. Larose was thirty miles away and there was a
constable in the village, so to speak, almost at your very door.
What was your reason for it?"</p>

<p>"I was stunned," replied the commodore. "I was literally
aghast, and I turned for help to the one person whom I knew
would give it best. I never gave a thought to the local
policeman until after I had rung up Mr. Larose, and then, as Mr.
Larose had said he would start away instantly, I decided to
leave everything to him."</p>

<p>"You sort of lost your head then?" queried Stone grimly.</p>

<p>The commodore nodded. "I suppose I did." He bridled up
warmly. "But who wouldn't have done, sir, at seeing someone he'd
parted with in perfect health, only a few hours before, lying
with his head almost cloven in two?"</p>

<p>"But in your profession you've probably seen dead men before,
haven't you?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of them," replied the commodore. He shook his head.
"Only not relations and when I've been all alone. That made the
difference. I was in the battle of Jutland and saw men blown to
pieces all around me, and I never turned a hair. The excitement
kept my reason clear." He shrugged his shoulders. "But that
night there was not the excitement of battle to warm me up, and
when I came upon my poor cousin's body my brain went numb and I
felt cold as a corpse myself."</p>

<p>Stone nodded as if he understood. "But you lost precious
minutes," he said, "and it was a great mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh, I realise it now," exclaimed the commodore, "but who
would have imagined the murderer would be coming back to take
away the body? From the appearance of the blood and the broken
wrist-watch I knew my cousin must have been dead some hours, and
surely no one would have dreamt he would have ventured to return
after all that time?"</p>

<p>Stone made no comment and Larose went on to give the reasons
which had made them resolve to keep silent about the crime. The
inspector listened in stony silence. Next, Larose told of the
commodore finding the treasure in Francesco's grave and,
notwithstanding his obvious disapproval of the course of action
they had taken, the inspector's frowning face could not help
lighting in his interest.</p>

<p>"Treasure trove!" he nodded. "What have you done with the
things?"</p>

<p>Larose told him, and went on with the story of the sale of
the house and how he had forced up the bidding and made Ramon
Ellister pay a huge price for it, out of all proportion to its
real value.</p>

<p>The inspector frowned. "Then the man knows you are
interfering?" he asked. "He knows who it is who has got his
finger in the pie?"</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't," smiled Larose. "I was made up a bit and I'm
sure he never recognised me."</p>

<p>"By Jove, no," supplemented the commodore with enthusiasm.
"The sharpest person would not have seen through the disguise.
It was a wonderful one."</p>

<p>With the recital of the account of the sale over, Larose
paused to consider where next to go on.</p>

<p>"Is that the end?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Larose, "not by any means! We now go back
to that burglary and murder at Bentham Hall." He held Stone's
eyes with his own. "Now you told me the day before yesterday
that as the result of your investigations you were quite certain
the burglars, or one of them, had had access to the house only a
little while before the burglary was carried out."</p>

<p>"That is so," nodded Stone. "We are quite certain of it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose very solemnly, "Sir Jeremy Rollison told
me yesterday that, among others, a Mr. Ramon Ellister had been
staying there as his guest barely three weeks before the
crime."</p>

<p>Quite a long silence followed, with the expression upon the
inspector's face an impenetrable one. Then he said sharply,
"Well, go on."</p>

<p>Larose continued. "Now among the old manuscripts taken by the
burglars was one dealing with the life of this Father Francesco
whose body was buried in the vaults below the Gap House. The
professor had shown me the Father's name upon one of the
flagstones there, and I enquired of an expert at the British
Museum if anything were known about him. He showed me a copy of
the stolen manuscript&mdash;there are only three in
existence&mdash;and it said the priest had been Cardinal
Wolsey's chaplain and upon the cardinal's death he had gone into
hiding taking with him many valuable sacramental vessels so that
they should not fall into King Henry's hands. If you remember,
Henry was just then despoiling the monasteries of their
treasures. The manuscript also stated that Francesco had said
that rather than the king should get hold of the valuables he
would have them buried with him in an unknown grave."</p>

<p>"Did it say, too, where this priest had been buried?" asked
Stone.</p>

<p>"No, of course not! If it had, people would have gone after
the treasure all those hundreds of years ago."</p>

<p>The inspector frowned. "Then how did Ellister find out where
the grave was?"</p>

<p>"That's what we don't know," replied Larose instantly, "but
we do know he'd got the right oil from somewhere, because a week
after the burglary he was trying to buy the Gap House, and we
have evidence, too, that he was trying to find out all he could
about the Church of St. Cyprian over which the house is
built."</p>

<p>Larose then went on to relate how the professor had picked up
the page about the church in his garden the morning after the
midnight visitors had tried to break in and how he, Larose, had
traced it back to the mutilated book in the library at Norwich.
Of course, he brought in, too, the pretty girl assistant in the
manuscript room and the mystery surrounding her
disappearance.</p>

<p>There was no doubt the inspector had been very interested in
Larose's story, and, at its conclusion, he said smilingly,
"Certainly, Gilbert, you've brought us some very valuable
information, though, of course, as no one will know better than
you, the evidence against this man is all circumstantial. There
is no proof he stole the manuscript from Bentham Hall, or that
he was one of the men who came to the professor's house that
night and dropped the stolen paper. It is all conjecture. Also,
there is not the slightest evidence to show it was he who killed
the professor. Just conjecture again." A thought appeared to
strike him and he turned sharply to the commodore. "You look to
me, sir, to be a mentally well-balanced man, and so there is not
the slightest doubt in your mind, is there, that you did see
your cousin lying dead there that evening?"</p>

<p>The commodore flushed rather angrily. "Not the slightest
doubt, Inspector," he replied sharply. "Every time I want to I
can visualise him lying there with the ghastly broken-in
forehead."</p>

<p>"And you saw the axe," went on the inspector, "his own axe
with which he had, presumably, been killed, lying close by the
body?"</p>

<p>"No, no, a good ten yards away, close to the tree whose roots
he had been cutting at. It was half buried in the sand and my
foot knocked against it as I was going back."</p>

<p>"You left it where it was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and couldn't find it later."</p>

<p>"One more question." Stone heaved his body straight up in his
chair and asked, almost casually, "Do you benefit under your
cousin's will?"</p>

<p>The commodore flushed redder even than before. "Not a penny!
Everything goes to his old college."</p>

<p>"No offence, no offence," smiled the inspector, "but I had to
ask the question."</p>

<p>"And I witnessed the will," snapped the commodore. "So I knew
nothing would be coming to me."</p>

<p>Stone turned to Larose. "Well, Gilbert," he said briskly,
"from now onwards we'll trail that man and there'll be as few
minutes as possible when he's not being watched." He nodded.
"And if he's, as you make out, a professional crook, then, as
you know well, we'll be soon getting an idea of what he's up
to." He smiled at the commodore. "Don't you worry, sir. If he
killed your poor cousin, we'll get at the bottom of it, sooner
or later. Even though Mr. Larose is no longer working for us we
most often succeed in getting our man. With any good luck we'll
soon have some news for you."</p>

<p>With the departure of his two visitors the stout inspector
leant back in his chair with a thoughtful expression upon his
face. "Gilbert's a good fellow," he told himself, "but he's
always doing something he shouldn't, and I'm almost sure they
were keeping something back now. That navy chap wasn't too
comfortable when I was pressing him why he didn't ring up the
police before he rang Larose, and Gilbert seemed anxious to help
him out by going on so quickly with the story." He nodded.
"Still, they brought some good oil. There's no doubt about
that." He pressed a bell-push upon his desk. "And now for this
Mr. Ramon Ellister!"</p>

<p>"What did you think of him, Commodore?" asked Larose when
they were out in the street.</p>

<p>"An elephant with a brain as nimble as the legs of a
grasshopper," frowned the commodore. "In all our complicated
story he picked out the one weak spot at once."</p>

<p>"He's always like that," smiled Larose. "He looks for the
reason for everything and his mind sinks like a plummet to the
bottom of facts. Still, we did right in going to him, for
Ellister will now have all resources of the Yard like a load of
bricks on his back. However little they are able to find out
about his past, his present and future will be something like an
open book."</p>

<p>And Larose was in a way of being right there, as a few days
later he got a ring from the inspector. "Here, I say," boomed
Stone, "is that librarian girl you told me about a very
good-looking piece, golden haired, blue eyes and lovely and all
that?"</p>

<p>"That's the one!" exclaimed Larose. "The boss of the museum
in Norwich said she was one of the prettiest girls he'd ever
seen."</p>

<p>"Well, we've located her," said Stone, "but she's not Miss
Byron any more. She's Miss Montgomery now and supposed to be
Ramon Ellister's niece."</p>

<p>"Great Scott," exclaimed Larose. "Then there's no doubt about
them being accomplices! Where does she live and what does she
do?"</p>

<p>"She lives by herself in apartments in Maida Vale, and
Ellister drives her home every night or early morning from a
night-club in Hanover Square. She's supposed to be just an
ordinary member and very keen on dancing, but our men think
she's paid by the club as an item of attraction. The club's a
good-class one, but, for all that, they play roulette on the
sly. We raided the place a little while ago, but found nothing
and came a thud. We're sure, however, they were warned, but for
the life of us we can't imagine by whom."</p>

<p>Larose was puzzled. "But with all we suspect of Ellister, he
doesn't seem to me to be the type who could let a relation of
his make a market of her good looks."</p>

<p>"Oh, the report I've got doesn't go as far as that," said
Stone. "Apparently the young woman lives a most respectable life
in her apartments. We are told no men visitors ever come there
and Ellister himself hardly ever enters the house. She's said to
be musical and play the violin a lot."</p>

<p>"Does Ellister go to that night-club every night?"</p>

<p>"He goes there very often, and then we understand heavy poker
play takes place. Ellister's supposed to be very well off. As a
stockbroker he's got a good connection in the city and he's some
relation of Sir James Ellister of Bolton Park, near Guildford.
Well, Gilbert, that's all for the present. We are well trailing
the man and something more may turn up in a day or two. We must
play a waiting game."</p>

<p>Such strange tricks does chance play that after having been
without news of Agatha for so long a time, that same afternoon
Larose had another phone ring about her. This time it was the
long-awaited one from the librarian at Norwich. He said he was
not quite certain, but it had struck him suddenly that the
library she had been managing before she came to him had been
somewhere in Clapham, but exactly where he could not
remember.</p>

<p>Larose thanked him for the information and the next day set
about enquiring in Clapham for the biggest private circulating
library in the district. "It should be rather a big one," he
said at the post office where he made his enquiry, "because it
has a manager or manageress and three assistants. A Miss Byron
was the manageress up to the beginning of last March."</p>

<p>No one at the post office, however, remembered the name or
knew of any private lending library employing so many
assistants; indeed, Larose was informed that all such libraries
round Clapham were very small affairs. Still, he was given the
addresses of three and, rather disappointed, set about visiting
them.</p>

<p>At the first one he drew blank, getting no information at
all, and at the second, to begin with, things looked equally
unhopeful.</p>

<p>A slovenly, carelessly-dressed woman was in charge, and she
was short and sharp in her answers to his questions. "No one but
me," she said irritably, "has ever owned this library, and I've
never heard of any girl called Byron."</p>

<p>"The one I'm looking for," went on Larose most politely,
"left this neighbourhood somewhere about the beginning of March
last. She was very good-looking and went away to take up a
position in Norwich."</p>

<p>It seemed the woman was about to make another sharp denial of
knowing anything of her when, suddenly, a curious expression
came into her face. "Good-looking, you say!" she exclaimed.
"Tall, golden-haired and big saucer-blue eyes. Speaks like a
great lady and thinks she's a duchess!" Her voice rose in scorn.
"Yes, I know her! She worked for me, but she's no Miss Byron.
She's just a jumped-up little servant-girl called Agatha
Wandsworth."</p>

<p>"But are you sure it's the same girl?" asked Larose, very
puzzled.</p>

<p>"If that's her description, I am," snapped the woman, "and
it's quite certain it's the same girl if she left some library
about here the beginning of March. Oh, she was a baggage, she
was, and she took herself off at an hour's notice, leaving me in
a dreadful hole!"</p>

<p>"But she went to a good appointment," exclaimed the rather
dubious Larose, "with an excellent reference from the last
employer."</p>

<p>"Then she wrote it herself," laughed the woman derisively. "I
never gave her one. The little trickster was equal to anything
and&mdash;ah, I see it all now! She had the letter telling her
she'd got the situation the very morning she left. She waited
for the postman outside, as she'd been waiting for him several
days, and then comes in as bold as brass and tells me her
father, who's a clergyman, is very ill, and she must leave at
once." She scoffed. "All lies, of course!"</p>

<p>"And you never heard anything of her after?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"No. But wouldn't I have liked to," exclaimed the woman
hotly, "for the little wretch had been taking subscriptions for
my library from people and putting them in her own pocket. Oh,
she was a bad girl, she was, but I didn't learn anything about
it until afterwards! She'd been a servant to some poor old lady
in Balham and let her die from neglect. There was an inquest on
her and this Agatha got it hot from the coroner. He said the
police ought to prosecute her for the lies she'd told." The
woman nodded spitefully. "But there&mdash;if you want to know
all about that, go to Mr. Western, the chemist, at the corner of
Bank Road. He can tell you everything about her, where she came
from and all that."</p>

<p>Calling upon the chemist, Larose caught him just as he and
his wife were starting upon a holiday. The taxi was at the door
to drive them to the railway station. Learning what Larose had
come about, the chemist told him he couldn't wait a moment, but
directed him to the late Miss Brown's house where her niece,
Mrs. Benson, was now living. "She knows more about this Agatha
Wandsworth than I do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Benson, a prim, middle-aged lady with a rather hard,
puritanical face, eyed Larose suspiciously when he asked her to
tell him about her aunt's one-time maid.</p>

<p>"Do you come from the police?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not," he replied, "I only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't be a bit surprised," she interrupted
sharply, "for if that girl lives long enough, I'm sure the
police will have plenty to do with her. Her disposition is
naturally wicked."</p>

<p>"But she's said to be so very pretty," protested Larose,
intending to lead Mrs. Benson on to speak as fully as she
could.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's pretty all right!" agreed the other instantly.
"And pretty, too, in a most modest way. Why, I really don't
think I've ever seen a much prettier face. But she's wicked and
selfish and couldn't be more dishonest and untruthful." She
spoke sharply. "But why have you come about her? You've not told
me that yet."</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this," fibbed Larose. "She obtained a
situation with a friend of mine under false pretences and we are
curious to know how she managed it. I happened to be in this
neighbourhood and thought I'd enquire about it." He laughed.
"Then I found out that the references she'd given were
forged."</p>

<p>"Just like her! She'd be equal to anything. Why, in that
coroner's court, though without a shadow of doubt she'd been
caught out as a liar, she just stood up there before everyone
like a martyred innocent."</p>

<p>She told Larose the whole story of what happened at the
inquest and then harked back to Agatha's earlier days and her
first coming to the old ladies from the orphanage.</p>

<p>"And do you know," she went on, "I'm not in the least
astonished that someone has come here to-day to speak to me
about Agatha. Things always run in twos and threes, and I saw
the girl yesterday, the first time since the day of the
inquest."</p>

<p>"She came to you here?" asked Larose, very astonished.</p>

<p>"No, no, I saw her in the West End, coming out of a
palatial-looking restaurant&mdash;I don't know its name&mdash;and
I was so close to her that I was able to take in everything. She was
most expensively dressed, everything to match, and I'm sure her
shoes alone cost five or six guineas. On her wrist, too, she'd
got a diamond-studded wrist-watch. She was with a well-dressed,
quiet-looking young fellow, and the commissionaire was whistling
for a taxi."</p>

<p>"Oh, living expensively!" frowned Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, and such a short time ago she was a little maid of all
work, washing up the plates and dishes in this very house. Oh,
but she looked a lady, a real little aristocrat! I tell you I
was aghast."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was the same girl?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Positive! I was close behind her and I heard her speak. She
called the young fellow Peter. She has an unusually clear,
musical voice and I couldn't be mistaken. Then the taxi came and
she walked over to it with the airs of a great lady. She knew
people were looking at her."</p>

<p>"Did she see you?"</p>

<p>"No! But it wouldn't have put her out if she had. She'd have
probably smiled and said good afternoon. She was like that.
There are two things to her credit I've always heard. She was
never rude or lost her temper and she never had anything to do
with men."</p>

<p>"But you say she was with one now," said Larose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benson nodded. "And that makes me uneasy and I don't
know where my duty lies. My conscience tells me I ought to warn
that young fellow. If she's going about with him, it means she's
serious and will probably marry him."</p>

<p>"But you don't know who he is!" exclaimed Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do," replied Mrs. Benson triumphantly. "When they
had driven away, a well-dressed man waiting at the entrance to
the restaurant asked the commissionaire who Agatha was. He
didn't know, but said the gentleman was young Mr. Wardale of
Esher. I've looked up the name in the telephone book and the
place is Wardale Court. I almost think of ringing him up. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't do it," replied Larose, shaking his head. "He'd
know it was a woman speaking and he'd only put it down to spite.
Besides, he wouldn't take any notice. A young fellow in love
won't listen to anybody."</p>

<p>The same afternoon Larose rang up Inspector Stone. "Your men
were pretty smart, weren't they, Charlie, in finding out that
that Miss Montgomery is Ellister's niece. It was quick work, but
they happened to be wrong. She's no relation of his and was
baptised as Agatha Wandsworth. She was in a foundling home and
given that surname because a bobby picked her up one night on
Wandsworth Common."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of your facts?" grunted Stone.</p>

<p>"Quite. I've traced her back, year by year, to her first
orphanage and seen her photograph when she was sixteen and just
going out to service. Even then she was a lovely girl."</p>

<p>"What sort of girl is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as far as men are concerned I can learn nothing wrong of
her. She kept them all at a distance. Still, in other ways she's
not too good, though she's never been in police hands. She's
been a petty thief all her life. I believe now her meeting with
Ellister in Norwich must have been accidental. However, I'll
look in and see you to-morrow and give further details."</p>

<p>Larose told the commodore that night what he had found out
about the pretty librarian's assistant. "Of course the only
charge which could be brought against her," he said, "would be
that of forging a reference, but it wouldn't be wise to do that
now. We shall just watch them both until they make a slip.
That's all we can do for the present. I'll let you know when
anything happens."</p>

<p>The commodore told him he might be returning to Cornwall for
a few days and then, perhaps, going to stay with some distant
relatives of his in Surrey. Anyhow, he would let him know where
he was.</p>

<p>Agatha was enjoying herself these days and quite confident
everything was going well with her. Apart from having Peter
Wardale well in tow, she was very delighted with a beautiful
wrist-watch Douro had given her, the one Mrs. Benson had seen
her wearing. It had cost Douro the best part of &pound;250, but he had
bought it for her out of the profit he had made out of his share
ventures. Agatha had let him kiss her hand when he strapped it
on her wrist, and, more in love than ever with her, he was sure
her acceptance of his present would help to lead later to a
closer intimacy.</p>

<p>He had given it to her one night at the club, and the only
fly in his ointment had been that Ramon had come unexpectedly
into the room just after Agatha had got it on and was still
enthusing about its beauty.</p>

<p>Outwardly Ramon had been quite pleasant and had admired the
watch, too, but inwardly he was seething with rage, being sure
there was a better understanding between the two than they were
making out. His passion for Agatha was still at a white heat. It
was the truth when he had told her he had never been in love
before, but now, deep in the toils, he could never get her out
of his thoughts. She had become his great obsession and he was
determined, with all the strength of his fierce and masterful
nature, to get her in one way or another, and that no one else
should have her he had sworn many times to himself.</p>

<p>So the days passed until one Monday morning, when Peter's
coming-of-age dinner-party was only ten days away, and Agatha
was lying in bed, luxuriously enjoying her breakfast and reading
the paper. Knowing that Ramon and Douro were going to be away
for the week-end at the former's bungalow on the Broads and
would not be at the Old Regency on either the Saturday or Sunday
nights, she had taken French leave and given herself a holiday
from there, too. On the Saturday night Peter had taken her to a
theatre and on the Sunday they had motored down to Eastbourne
and spent the day upon the Downs.</p>

<p>She was glancing down the paper when, suddenly, the headlines
over a paragraph caught her eye and she read, "Boating accident
on Hickling Broad". She read down and her breath choked in her
amazement. Douro had been drowned when he and Ramon had been
rowing over the Broad in the moonlight on the Saturday
night!</p>

<p>For the moment the print before her eyes became blurred and
dark. Douro drowned and she would never be seeing him again! She
felt no grief or horror, but only an almost overwhelming,
startled surprise. The thought swept into her mind how fortunate
it was he had given her that wrist-watch before it happened.</p>

<p>Her eyes cleared and the print before them was clear again.
The two friends had been going for a short row before they
turned in to bed. Ellister had been rowing and Douro leaning
over the side of the boat flashing his torch to attract the
fish. But he had leaned too far and overbalanced the boat! They
had both been thrown into the water.</p>

<p>Then followed the account of the tragic ending of Douro. He
could not swim, but Ellister had supported him and tried
desperately to reach the bank. Douro's struggles, however, had
made it impossible and, slipping from his companion's hold, he
had gone under. Ellister had shouted for help, but no one had
heard him and, in the last stage of exhaustion, he had just
managed to save himself.</p>

<p>Then two men had at last heard his shouting and come running
up. He had pointed to where Douro had sunk and they had dived in
time after time to retrieve the body. Ellister, himself, in part
recovering from his exhaustion, had courageously dived in too.
However, for a long while the search was fruitless, and it was
not until more than two hours had passed that the body had been
found. It had then drifted to quite a hundred yards away from
where it had sunk. It had been too late then to save the drowned
man, though artificial respiration had been kept up for a long
time.</p>

<p>The inquest was to take place on Monday at noon.</p>

<p>Agatha put down the newspaper and munched complacently at
another piece of toast. In a cold sort of way she felt sorry for
the manner of Douro's death, but relieved that she would be now
free from his attentions. Certainly, he had been rather annoying
of late and it had been a nuisance to have to be continually
keeping him at a distance.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a thought came to her and her face went grey in
fear. Had Ramon got him out into that boat, when no one else
would have been upon the water, and drowned him deliberately?
She knew Ramon had been jealous of him, and also that he was
capable of anything. He was cruel and hard and a dangerous man
to offend. Then what about herself? How would he act when he
learnt she was going to marry Peter Wardale?</p>

<p>Oh, she must take care of herself! She must never be alone
with him and let him drive her home again!</p>

<p>She thought quickly. She would go no more to the Regency
Club. She would break with it altogether, at once. It was only
ten days now to the coming-of-age dinner-party at Wardale Court
and then her engagement to Peter Wardale would be announced.
Four days afterwards they would be married by special licence.
She did not think that once she was a married woman Ramon would
dare to interfere with her. He would give her up. She had heard
him boasting once to Douro that thank goodness he had always
been strong-minded enough to cut his losses.</p>

<p>She felt comforted. Yes, she would be all right once she was
married, but until then&mdash;she must look out.</p>

<p>Jumping out of bed, she opened a good-sized leather trunk she
had and from a small locked box proceeded to add up exactly how
much money she had. From her many presents at the roulette table
and what she had not spent of her salary she had nearly &pound;100.
That was enough for anything. She would leave her apartments at
once and go to stay at a hotel.</p>

<p>She would write to Ramon that the news of Douro's terrible
death had so shocked her that she could not come to the Old
Regency for a few days and would have to have a rest. It would
be no good his coming to see her, as she had given orders no one
was to be admitted. When she felt a little better she might even
go away to the seaside for a short change.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be the letter to write him, she told herself,
for above all things he must not learn she had left Maida Vale
for good. If he came to make enquiries about her, which he
probably would after a few days, if he heard she had given up
her apartments altogether, he might suspect something of much
greater significance than just going off for a short holiday. So
she would go on paying for the rooms until after she was
married, and even leave some of her things behind to make out
she was coming back.</p>

<p>So, summoning the landlady to her room, with a tearful face
of great grief, she showed her the newspaper and told her the
dead man had been a great friend of hers and of her father. She
said she would have to go away for a few days so that she would
be quite near to his people, who lived in Chelsea, to give them
all the comfort she could. She would be back, she added, in a
week or ten days, and, to prevent all suspicion of her not
returning, she paid a fortnight's rent and said she would be
calling for any letters which might arrive.</p>

<p>She left the house within an hour, and straightaway rang up
Peter to meet her that afternoon at the hotel where she was by
then installed. Peter was going to be rather an anxiety to her
and on no account could he be allowed to meet Ramon before the
coming-of-age party. He was not clever and subtle enough to do
much deceiving and so she must keep him away from all places
where he was likely to run up against Ramon.</p>

<p>When Peter arrived at the hotel, to explain her staying there
she said there were two cases of bad influenza in her house and
with the coming-of-age party so near at hand she was terrified
at the idea of catching it. Of course, she added, it was silly
being frightened, and she had not even told her uncle, as he
would only laugh at her for being such a baby. Peter was
thrilled at her confiding in him and was emphatic he would let
no one into the secret. If he did happen to meet Ramon or anyone
from the club, he would just make out, if she was mentioned,
that he had not seen her lately.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ramon had not been having a very good time at
the inquest. He had drowned Douro deliberately and was thinking
he had managed everything very cleverly. Directly they had got
well out on the lake he had tipped the boat over and pulled his
floundering companion well under the water by the legs. He had
taken good care not to seize any of the exposed parts of his
body, so that there would be no bruises to be found afterwards.
Upon coming to the surface for breath, he had given Douro no
chance to get his head above water for a single second, and from
first to last Douro had never uttered a single cry. His lungs
had quickly filled with water and he had been finished with in
less than three minutes.</p>

<p>However, Ramon, to be perfectly sure, had held him under for
a good five minutes before he had let go and swum leisurely to
shore. Then it had been a few minutes longer before he had
shouted. Help had come at once, but, to prevent all chance of
Douro being saved by artificial respiration, he had directed the
would-be rescuers to quite a distance away from where the body
had really sunk.</p>

<p>So when the inquest took place on the Monday he was greatly
surprised that it was not, as he had expected, just a formal
one. On the contrary, a superintendent had been sent down from
Norwich to represent the police, and he was most inquisitive.
For one thing, he could not understand how it was Ramon's cries
for help had not been heard at once, as the night was still and
there were several bungalows only a few hundred yards away. Then
he was very puzzled that if the drowned man had struggled so
fiercely, as Ramon had said, why his clothing was found to be so
little disarranged when the body was brought to the bank. His
coat was still buttoned up and both his collar and tie were in
their proper place.</p>

<p>Ramon could not give any explanation and, indeed, did not
attempt to. He just brushed the questions away as if they were
of no importance. All he seemed to realise was that his great
friend was dead, and it seemed that his brain was still numbed
from the shock.</p>

<p>"When help at last came," asked the superintendent, "did you
make a mistake in pointing out about where the body had
sunk?"</p>

<p>Ramon shook his head. "I don't think so," he replied slowly,
"unless the position of the overturned boat misled me. It might
have drifted a little from where it had been upset."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you cling to it while you called for help?"
asked the superintendent. "Then you might both have been
saved."</p>

<p>"But why should we have clung to it?" asked Ramon a little
irritably. "I am a strong swimmer and the distance to the bank
was nothing to me. I could have swum it twenty times over. I was
perfectly confident we should both be all right until my friend
slipped from my arms and I couldn't find him. I have told you I
didn't even shout until I had dived many times to find him."</p>

<p>"Naturally, it being at night time," interrupted the coroner,
a hay and chaff merchant in private life, "you could not see far
under the water?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't see at all," said Ramon, "and all I could do was
to dive round in circles on the chance of coming up against him.
I think now that his feet must have got entangled in the
weeds."</p>

<p>The coroner spoke most kindly. "Of course, with these
questions being asked there is not the slightest suggestion in
anybody's mind that you did not do your utmost to save your
friend. We are only thrashing the whole thing out so that it may
point a lesson to anyone who may one day find themselves in the
same unfortunate circumstances. You understand that, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Ramon nodded wearily. "Oh, yes, sir! Quite!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt he made a good witness, and if the
sympathies of the police were not wholly and unreservedly with
him, those of the jury were, as shown by the rider of condolence
they added to their verdict of accidental death.</p>

<p>Inspector Stone discussed the whole thing with Larose the
next day. "Of course there may have been nothing fishy," he
said, "but, suspecting the man of what we do, nothing is
certain. Certainly the Norwich police are not altogether
satisfied, but that may be only because they know we are
trailing him. They say they'd swear he never called for help
until it was too late to do anything and then that he put
everyone off recovering the body by making out it had
disappeared where it hadn't."</p>

<p>"Who is this Douro?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"We don't know yet, but we'll find out. He's been living in a
private hotel in Kensington Square. Got a nice suite of rooms
there. We've discovered who his lawyers are and they've cabled
to his sister, his only relation, who lives in Madeira. She's
coming at once."</p>

<p>Ramon received Agatha's letter the next morning, when he
arrived at his place of business in the city. He frowned when he
read it. "Now I should like to know if that little spitfire was
gradually making up her mind to marry him. I shouldn't wonder
after the diamond wrist-watch business. If he had told her what
he had made over those damned mining shares it would have
dazzled her quite a lot." He nodded sneeringly. "At any rate
I've stopped that little business and there'll be no Douro-Byron
marriage."</p>

<p>Still, when he thought of Peter Wardale, he was not
altogether easy in his mind about Agatha, and he would have been
more uneasy still if he had known the boy was attaining his
majority the following week. It happened that only a few days
previously he had come upon the two looking in the window of a
jeweller's shop in Regent Street. They had not seen him, and,
for a few moments, he had stood behind them without speaking,
intending to surprise them.</p>

<p>He had noted they had been looking at a large tray of most
expensive engagement rings and he had heard Agatha say, "Now,
that's the sort of one I should like, the one with the big
diamond," and the boy had laughed. "Only &pound;300! That's nothing
for any man to give you."</p>

<p>Changing his mind, he had not spoken and, instead, had passed
on. At the time he had not thought much of the incident,
believing it to be only one of Agatha's routine ways of trying
to get everything she could out of everybody. That same night,
however, when he had seen them dancing together at the Old
Regency and noted the worshipping look in Peter's eyes, it had
struck him Agatha was encouraging the boy more than she usually
did her admirers and he wondered if by any chance there was
anything in it.</p>

<p>He sat down now and answered Agatha's letter at once. He knew
it was no good his going to see her, at any rate for a few days,
as he was aware she could be quite as stubborn and determined as
he was.</p>

<p>Of course, he wrote, Douro's death was a great shock to
everyone, but she would soon get over it and forget it. He was
sorry she was feeling off colour, but hoped she would soon be
better, so that she could return to the Old Regency. However,
her salary would go on just the same, and, now he was freed from
Douro's restraining influence, it would be increased two guineas
a week at once. That was, of course, a lie, as Douro had become
so keen on Agatha he would not in the least have minded paying
her twenty guineas a week instead of six.</p>

<p>Then, as a postscript, Ramon let his bad temper go and added,
"See here, Diana, don't you try to play any trick with me and
think you can get away with it. If you don't marry me I'll take
good care you don't marry anyone at all, and you just realise
that, young woman. You know me well enough by now to be quite
sure I always keep my word."</p>

<p>The week went by quickly, and on the following Monday two
things happened. Peter had just lunched with Agatha at her
hotel, and from there he rang up Ramon at his office to ask him
to come down to his birthday dinner-party on the Thursday. He
had been well coached by Agatha what to say, and, indeed, she
was standing at his side when he rang up.</p>

<p>She had told him an artful story to explain why her uncle
must not know about the engagement until everyone else was told.
She had said he wanted her to marry a cousin of hers of whom he
was very fond and he would be very annoyed when he learnt she
was not going to do so. So she had been keeping away from him
and not telling him where she was staying. He had thought she
was somewhere at the seaside.</p>

<p>"You and Miss Montgomery must come, Mr. Ellister," said
Peter, "and stay the night, too. Also, if possible, you must
both stop at the Court over the next day for the ball on the
Friday. Your niece says she'd like to if you'll stay, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you've seen my niece?" said Ramon with
suspicion.</p>

<p>"No, but I wrote to her," replied Peter, "and my letter was
sent on to Brighton. She's just rung me up from there. She asked
me to tell you she wouldn't be coming home until Thursday and
then might come straight on to us without going to Maida Vale.
She says she feels very much better."</p>

<p>"She's not condescended to write to me," said Ramon
irritably. "Where's she staying in Brighton?"</p>

<p>"On the Parade somewhere. I didn't catch the number."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll come on Thursday," said Ramon after a few
moment's hesitation, "and if she rings you up again, tell her to
ring me up, too. I want to speak to her."</p>

<p>Hanging up the receiver, the expression on Ramon's face was a
suspicious one. "Now I wonder if that's the truth?" he asked
himself frowningly. "I know she can't be trusted a yard and will
tell any lie if it suits her. Still, it's something she won't
stay on for the ball unless I'm with her, though I don't pretend
to understand what she means by it." He nodded. "I'd like to
think it means she's coming round a bit, though, damn her, I
wish I'd never seen her."</p>

<p>The second happening that day was that Mr. Newton, Peter's
lawyer-guardian, arrived without notice at the Court that
afternoon with the intention of stopping the night. He was most
annoyed to find Peter was not there and would not be back until
late the next day.</p>

<p>"He's gone to Oxford," explained Mrs. Wardale, "to spend the
night with an old college friend."</p>

<p>"What's the friend's name?" asked the lawyer, with the idea
of getting speech with Peter on the telephone.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Wardale. "I don't think he
mentioned it."</p>

<p>"And I purposely didn't give you any notice I was coming,"
said the lawyer crossly, "because I wanted to catch Peter
without giving him any warning so that he could not make some
excuse and clear off." He looked grimly at Mrs. Wardale. "I'm
pretty sure that Montgomery girl is a bad lot."</p>

<p>Peter's mother looked very distressed. "Oh, and he would make
me ask her and her uncle to the dinner-party on Thursday. You
must stop until he comes back and talk to him."</p>

<p>"But I can't stop," said Mr. Newton with a frown, "and that's
why I came down in a hurry to-day. I've got to catch the night
express to the north of Scotland to-morrow and I shan't be home
until next week. I have some very important business in
Inverness and it can't be put off." He spoke very sternly. "Now
has his attraction for that girl gone any farther?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Mrs. Wardale plaintively. "He'd
not even mentioned her for some days until last night, and then
he said he wanted her and her uncle to stay the night here on
Thursday and remain over for the ball if they would."</p>

<p>"Has he been going out with her, do you know? Well, has he
mentioned anything about the Old Regency night-club lately?"</p>

<p>"No, and I don't think he's been going there. He's been home
too early. I believe he was home every night last week by
midnight, and when he's been talking about the club it's always
been after he's come in very late, often between three and four
in the morning. But what have you found out about Miss
Montgomery?"</p>

<p>The lawyer's eyes were very hard. "I have every reason to
believe," he said in precise legal manner, "that her good looks
are being used as a bait to induce young fellows to lose their
money playing at illegal games which are carried on there. In
other words, that she's a sort of decoy, paid by the club to be
about the premises every night."</p>

<p>"Oh, John, but surely that's not true?" asked Peter's mother,
her voice quavering.</p>

<p>"But I'm pretty certain of it," nodded Mr. Newton. "Last week
a very old client of mine brought her son in for advice. The
boy's got into the hands of the money-lenders and, questioning
him, it came out he'd lost more than &pound;100 lately at this very
night-club, playing roulette. I asked him if he'd met Peter
there and he said yes. He said he'd seen him dancing a lot with
a very pretty girl, a Miss Montgomery. Then I asked him about
the girl and he said she often took men down in the roulette
room to have what she called 'a flutter'. She'd taken him down
several times."</p>

<p>"But I can't believe it of a girl like that," protested Mrs.
Wardale weakly. "She looks so innocent and refined."</p>

<p>"Just the very kind to take men in," snapped the lawyer. He
nodded. "I heard something more, too, from this boy. A little
while ago a detective managed somehow to get into this club as a
member and, upon what he saw going on, the place was raided. The
management, however, had had warning and removed all the gaming
tables in time. Then the rumour went round that this detective,
who'd become very friendly with the Montgomery girl, had warned
her what was coming and she'd saved the club. They say the heads
of the police are furious with him and that he was nearly
discharged from the Force."</p>

<p>"It sounds dreadful," exclaimed Mrs. Wardale, "but what am I
to do?"</p>

<p>"Tell Peter what I'm telling you," replied the lawyer
sternly, "and put him on his guard. I know he's obstinate and
difficult to manage, but surely he'll have sense enough to keep
himself out of danger."</p>

<p>"But what danger is there?" asked Mrs. Wardale, looking very
worried. "He's not in love with her and she's certainly not
trying to catch him. She takes no notice of him when she comes
here."</p>

<p>"You never know," commented the lawyer grimly. "You women are
wily creatures, and even the most stupid among you can be
wonderful actresses. It's born in you, just like telling
untruths, big and little." His stern expression lightened, as he
added smilingly, "Why, with all my forty odd years in law, when
I'm talking to a woman, whoever it may be, duchess or servant-girl,
I can never be sure if she's speaking the truth."</p>

<p>When Peter came home the next evening, not having been near
Oxford, but only hovering about Agatha nearly all the time, his
mother told him what his uncle had said. Peter only laughed
merrily. "Why, my dear mother," he cried, "after I'd been in the
roulette room once she wouldn't let me go down again and she's
always dead against my wasting money." He spoke gravely, "And
does she look like that sort of girl Uncle makes out? Don't you
worry. I don't think for a moment she'd accept me if I proposed
to-morrow. She's half engaged to a cousin of hers whom her uncle
is very keen on her marrying." He sighed. "I admit I've got
rather fond of her, though I am sure I shall never dare to tell
her so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wardale felt very worried. She had a great respect for
her lawyer brother-in-law's opinion, knowing him to be always
most cautious in what he said. So, she was sure there must be
something in what he had told her and she was terrified that
Peter might now get entangled with a girl, undoubtedly so very
attractive, but about whose family and history they really knew
nothing.</p>

<p>She was devoted to Peter, but quite aware that his nature,
like her own, was a weak one. He was easily influenced and so
often let others make up his mind for him. Then, with a streak
of his dead father's determination in him, he would become
obstinate and refuse to listen to all argument or reason. All
his life long she had never had much control over him and, when
their wills had crossed, it had invariably been she who, in the
end, had had tearfully to give in.</p>

<p>So, when on the eventful Thursday morning, Peter's twenty-first
birthday, the boy came into her bedroom quite early and
announced abruptly that he had become engaged to Agatha the
previous evening, though she burst into tears, she knew she had
no hope of influencing him.</p>

<p>"It's done, Mother," he said firmly, "and nothing is going to
alter it. In fact I believe it was your talk with me on Tuesday
which made me propose to her. I hated to think anyone was
slandering such a dear, good girl and it made me realise how
much I really loved her. I felt I wanted to protect her."</p>

<p>"But Peter, darling," she wailed, "you should have waited.
You are much too young to know your own mind about girls
yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm not, Mother," he replied, "and it'll steady me
to marry young." He laughed. "Then those designing women you're
so afraid of won't catch me."</p>

<p>"But I'm so frightened," she went on, "that you mayn't have
chosen well."</p>

<p>"But I have," he insisted, "and when I asked her to marry me
and she said she would, we realised we had been fond of each
other for some time. Still, it was a great surprise to me when I
asked her and a greater surprise even to me when she accepted
me."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure her uncle has intended it all along," said Mrs.
Wardale tearfully. "What does he say to it?"</p>

<p>Peter laughed merrily. "He doesn't know. That's the joke. And
you just watch his face when he learns of it. You'll see then
whether or not he's been egging me on." He held one of his
mother's hands in his. "Now, Mother, promise me you'll be nice
to her when she comes to-day. You're the first one to be told
and we'll announce it to-night at dinner."</p>

<p>So it ended, as might have been anticipated by anyone who
knew Mrs. Wardale, in her promising.</p>

<p>Agatha was thrilled beyond all expression as Peter drove her
down to the big mansion of which so soon now she was going to be
the mistress. How beautifully she had played her cards, she
thought, and how well she had arranged everything! Upon his
mother's credit, but quite unbeknown to her, Peter had bought
the &pound;300 diamond ring at the family jewellers in Regent Street,
and, also, put everything in train for obtaining the special
licence and their being married on the following Monday. Yes,
everything would go off without a hitch and she had nothing to
be afraid of now!</p>

<p>However, she felt just a little bit uneasy here. Peter was
going to have several surprises. A lot of the lies she had told
him would have to be disentangled; the lies about her
aristocratic parentage, those of her relationship to Ramon
Ellister and of the ample private means she was supposed to
possess. Still, once they were married, with his passionate
longing for her, she was sure she would be quickly able to get
round Peter. If she couldn't&mdash;well, what did it matter? She
would be Mrs. Peter Wardale and nothing could alter that.</p>

<p>Besides, directly after the ceremony, were they not to drive
straight from the church to the office of a firm of solicitors
where the deed of the marriage settlements, which had already
been drawn up, was to be signed? So she was comforted that in
any eventuality she would be well provided for.</p>

<p>If Agatha were thrilled with her thoughts as they drove
along, Peter was in the seventh heaven of happiness, and several
times during the short journey to Esher said he must surely be
the very happiest man in all the world that morning. He kept
looking round at Agatha all the time, and made her sit close to
him so that he could sense in advance his coming possession of
her by feeling the warmth of her lithe young body against
his.</p>

<p>In spite of herself, his boyish adoration for her touched
Agatha, and, as they passed between the big lodge gates into the
short drive leading up to the Court, the very beauty of
everything under the glorious sunshine stirred some strange and
unaccustomed chord in her and, perhaps for the first time in all
her callous and selfish life, made her feel ashamed of
herself.</p>

<p>She was taking everything from this boy and intending to give
nothing or very little in return. She had not the slightest
affection for him and his hopes and romantic notions about her
would be dashed from him within a few hours. He would know her
then for the cold, unloving woman she was, and could not help
being.</p>

<p>For the moment the prospect made her uncomfortable, and it
flashed through her that she could not go through with it. She
would make him turn the car round and drive her straight back to
town. Her conscience, however, was only half stirred and she
compromised with it immediately.</p>

<p>No, for she would give him something. At any rate his
honeymoon should be a happy one. Then she would break him
gradually to a realisation of how hateful to her were all his
caresses and expressions of affection. Had she not read over and
over again in books how soon men's passions tired? Well, his
should tire the quicker. That would be all.</p>

<p>Quite aglow with her good resolutions, she squeezed Peter's
arm and said feelingly, "You are a dear boy, aren't you?" and
Peter would have liked to stop the car and kiss her shamelessly
in front of anyone who might have been watching them from the
Court windows.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a if="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE MILLS OF GOD.</h2>

<p class="first">ALL the morning Mrs. Wardale had been thinking
tearfully that the meeting with her future daughter-in-law would
be a most trying ordeal. She had schooled herself, however, to
meet Agatha in as friendly a way as she could and let her get no
inkling how distasteful to the family the engagement was. After
all, she told herself, the marriage was still not inevitable
and, if it were put off as long as possible, lots of things
might happen to prevent it.</p>

<p>Peter might get tired of the girl, or if it could be proved
and brought home to him that what her brother-in-law thought he
had found out was the real truth, then her son might see reason
and give the girl up. At any rate, the engagement time would be
a breathing space and afford plenty of opportunity to learn
everything about her and her relations. So she was comforted not
a little, and when she saw Peter's car coming up the drive,
appeared outwardly at least, to be quite composed and prepared
to handle the situation tactfully.</p>

<p>When, however, Peter led Agatha into her room, when she saw
the fresh young beauty of the girl, her lovely smiling face and
big, innocent blue eyes, and when Agatha stood before her, so
demure and so respectful&mdash;all her fears and apprehensions
were swept away as in a lightning flash and she had to admit to
herself that any boy could be pardoned for falling in love with
such a delightful ideal of womanhood.</p>

<p>So she was genuinely friendly with Agatha and kissed her
without any of that repugnance she had been so sure, only a few
minutes before, she would be feeling.</p>

<p>Peter smiled happily to himself. He had been sure his mother
would be like that and won over at once, for with her he knew it
was always the one who was last with her who influenced her
most. Also she was generally inclined to go to extremes, one way
or the other. He had breathed a deep sigh of relief, however,
when he had learnt his lawyer-uncle was not going to be present
at the coming-of-age gathering, for, if he had been, it was
certainly more than possible he would have made himself
disagreeable. At the best he would have been cold and unsmiling
before the other guests, and have lectured him, Peter, angrily
in private.</p>

<p>Peter had arrived with Agatha just before midday, and, with
the talk with his mother over, they all went into lunch. Beryl
Wardale made up the fourth at the meal. She had been told of the
engagement, and if she were disappointed, at any rate she did
not show it. She made herself very nice to Agatha and
congratulated her warmly.</p>

<p>The meal was a bright one and, Mrs. Wardale having now
altogether discarded, at any rate for the time being, the idea
that her son had engaged himself to an undesirable girl, was
most chatty. She told Agatha about some of those who would be at
the dinner that evening.</p>

<p>"They will all be relations or family connections," she said,
"except, of course, Mr. Ellister. Peter had lots of uncles and
aunts because I come of a big family, nine children altogether.
There'll be the Reverend Mr. Duckling and his wife, one of my
sisters. Mr. Duckling is the Rector of St. Jude's, South
Kensington, and they say that one day he'll be a bishop as he's
so clever. His sermons are always very short ones and it makes
him most popular. Then there'll be Sir Michael Turton. He's an
old bachelor and rather grumpy"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"but
everyone puts up with him because he's over eighty and has lots
of money to leave to someone."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness," grinned Peter, "I shan't have to humour
him." He pressed Agatha's foot under the table. "I've enough
money on my own now, and there'll be no more bowing and scraping
to Uncle John, either, to get him to increase my allowance."</p>

<p>A shadow passed over his mother's face, as if the fear that
Agatha was marrying her son for his money had recurred to her.
After a moment, however, she went on. "Then there's Commodore
Smith. He's my second cousin, and I'm sure you'll like him even
though he talks of nothing but golf. Then there'll be His Honour
Judge Crofts, a County Court Judge, another uncle of
Peter's."</p>

<p>Mentioning several other guests, Mrs. Wardale filled Agatha
with a great pride that she was entering a family of so many
distinguished people, so much so that she almost hoped the
people at the Orphanage would one day learn to what great
heights she had climbed.</p>

<p>After lunch she thought it prudent to ring up Ramon at his
office, so that there should be no special reason for him to try
to speak to her alone when he arrived at the Court. She told him
she was speaking from there, Peter Wardale having driven her
down to lunch.</p>

<p>Ramon spoke crossly. "I went to Maida Vale yesterday and they
told me you'd been away from there the whole time. What does all
this tomfoolery mean? Why have you gone down to Esher for so
early? What are you after?"</p>

<p>"The same thing that you are," replied Agatha sweetly, and
Ramon, thinking she meant the valuable Ravencross goblets, was
somewhat mollified and went on more pleasantly, "Then mind you
get them. That's all. I don't mind staying on for the ball if
that comes off all right."</p>

<p>The expected guests began to arrive late in the afternoon,
and it was a great triumph for Agatha when she was introduced to
everyone in the big lounge, shortly before lunch. Commodore
Smith, in particular, was greatly impressed with her appearance.
He had no idea she was the Agatha Wandsworth Larose had told him
about, for Larose, not having happened to make any mention of
young Wardale's name, there was nothing to suggest any
connection between the two. So he let himself admire the lovely
girl without reserve.</p>

<p>And Agatha certainly did look lovely that night. She was
exquisitely gowned, by the North Audley Street costumiere again,
and she had even ventured to ask madame for another loan of her
rope of imitation pearls. Madame had been quite willing, with
the result that everyone's eyes seemed to linger on Agatha,
particularly those of the men. Her face was deliciously flushed
with the excitement, her eyes sparkled&mdash;like stars, so
Peter whispered to her&mdash;and, confident that all was going
well for her, she carried herself with the pride becoming to the
most important guest of the evening. She was delighted with the
many valuable presents Peter had been given, already regarding
them as her own.</p>

<p>Ramon was late in getting down and did not appear in the
lounge until a few minutes before the time when dinner was to be
served. Then, when the commodore heard his name mentioned as he
was being introduced to some of the other guests and recognised
him as the purchaser of the Gap House, he got what was surely
the greatest shock of all his adventurous life.</p>

<p>Gad, the murderer of his poor cousin, brazen as brass and
looking the aristocratic gentleman! What the hell was he doing
there?</p>

<p>Ramon was quite at his ease as he looked haughtily round. He
knew he was as well-connected as anyone present and, probably,
he told himself, much better off than most of them, too. So his
handsome face was set coldly in its usual proud and arrogant
expression. Only to Agatha did he unbend with a smile, and she
took good care to keep as far away from him as possible.</p>

<p>The commodore felt red-hot in his fury and, indeed, had to
turn away his eyes, so that he should not see him, to keep his
temper under sufficient control. He was consumed with curiosity
to learn how Ramon had come to be invited, but knew that must
wait, as Mrs. Wardale was busy talking to her guests. He swore
viciously under his breath. And the blackguard was going to sit
among them at dinner, exactly as if he were a respectable
person! He, a murderer, a thief and most probably the head of a
criminal gang! He was going to eat the good food, drink the good
wine and enjoy himself thoroughly!</p>

<p>The commodore was an impulsive, quick-tempered man and his
thoughts rioted through him. Going to enjoy himself, eh? Ah, was
he? He'd put a spoke in there! He'd be darned if he didn't!</p>

<p>Making his way quickly out of the lounge and into the big
dining-room where, under the direction of the Court butler, the
last touches were being put to the table appointments, the
commodore looked to see where Ramon would be sitting. He soon
found the dainty little ivory card, propped up against the
napkin with 'Mr. Ramon Ellister' written on it, and taking a
pencil from his pocket quickly added just one word in Roman
letters beneath it.</p>

<p>The others there were all too busy to notice what he had done
and he skipped from the room looking as impishly pleased with
himself as a naughty little boy. "That'll fix him," he chuckled,
"and he won't taste much of his dinner!"</p>

<p>The diners all trooped in, Peter, of course, with Agatha,
Ramon had the clergyman's wife and the commodore Beryl. It was
noticed Mrs. Wardale was looking rather pale. A buzz of
conversation followed as they sat down, but the commodore did
not dare to look squarely at Ramon, who had been placed just
opposite to him.</p>

<p>Ramon had been directed to his seat, but at first had only
just idly noted the card with his name upon it. Picking up his
napkin, however, the card caught his eye again, and he saw the
pencilled word below his name. He frowned, he looked very
puzzled, and he blinked his eyes several times as if he thought
his eyesight were deceiving him. Then, suddenly, he snatched up
the card and looked at it closely.</p>

<p>Braddock! Braddock! Who had written Braddock there?</p>

<p>For a few moments he did not take in its significance, and
then his heart beat painfully, his stomach heaved and he went
grey in fear.</p>

<p>Someone in the house had recognised him as a one-time
companion of Braddock and was intending this recognition should
be a threat, or he would not be now taking this way of telling
him!</p>

<p>But what could anyone there know about Braddock? Did they
know he was dead or anything of what had happened
before&mdash;or after? And who was it who possessed the
knowledge? Was it one of the other guests or one of the
servants?</p>

<p>He looked furtively round to see if anyone were watching him.
No, no one was looking his way, and they seemed all occupied
only with their conversations. He gulped down the glass of wine
which had just been poured out for him and turned, tardily, to
give some attention to the clergyman's wife.</p>

<p>The commodore had seen everything and was filled with an
unholy joy. He had wiped the proud arrogant look from Ellister's
face and the blackguard was in a cold sweat of fear!</p>

<p>The meal proceeded happily with merry laughter and bright
smiles. Agatha received a lot of attention and, indeed, so many
compliments from Sir Michael Turton that she was soon wishing
she had met the aged knight earlier in her career. With his
wealth and eighty years he would have made a much more
satisfactory husband than Peter. She was sure from the amount he
was eating and drinking that he could not last long. She hoped,
anyhow, he would send her an expensive wedding present.</p>

<p>Among the rather noisy babble of conversation, the commodore
thought it a good opportunity to find out from Beryl Wardale how
it was that Ramon Ellister came to be a guest at the birthday
party. As Peter's cousin and staying, as he knew she did, so
often at the Court, she would be sure to know.</p>

<p>So, when a good burst of conversation was in full blast, he
said to her very quietly, "Now keep your eyes on me, Beryl, and
whatever you do, don't look in his direction, but tell me how
long has your aunt known that Mr. Ellister sitting opposite to
us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a very little while," she replied, obeying his
injunction and not looking in Ramon's direction. "We have only
seen him once before to-night."</p>

<p>"Then why has he been invited here to-night?" asked the
commodore.</p>

<p>Beryl opened her eyes very widely. "Don't you know he's Miss
Montgomery's uncle?"</p>

<p>The commodore gulped down another big surprise. "No, I
certainly didn't," he replied frowningly. "And how long have you
known the niece?" he asked after quite a long interval of
silence, during which he had tried to grasp something of the
significance of everything.</p>

<p>"Not any longer than we've known her uncle," replied Beryl
dryly, "though she's been here to lunch twice to his once."</p>

<p>"And Peter, has he known her long?" was the commodore's next
question.</p>

<p>Beryl spoke with just a trace of resentment. "Longer than
he's told us; several weeks, we believe." She lowered her voice
to a still quieter tone, and added significantly, "And you may
hear Peter make a surprising announcement about her in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>The commodore was thunderstruck, for there was no mistaking
what Beryl meant. "So that's what's in the wind, is it?" he
asked sharply. He spoke almost sneeringly, "And I suppose Mr.
Ellister has come down to give his blessing to the match?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Peter says he doesn't know anything
about it yet. It's going to be as great a surprise to him as
everybody else. No one's been in the secret except Aunt and me,
and we learnt of it only this morning."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the commodore fervently, and Beryl was
startled by the grave expression upon his face. However, he
asked no more questions about Mr. Ellister or his niece and
turned the conversation into other channels.</p>

<p>The great moment at last arrived when the toast of the master
of Wardale Court was to be drunk. His Honour the County Court
Judge, as Peter's oldest relation present, proposed it, and in a
few crisp and lawyer-like sentences wished his nephew long years
of health and happiness. The toast was drunk with musical
honours and Peter, with very shaky legs, rose to reply to
it.</p>

<p>For the moment he was so nervous that he could not get out a
single word, but, to everyone's amusement, Agatha patted him
encouragingly upon the back and at last he managed to start. He
thanked them for their good wishes and said how pleased he was
they had come there that evening to give them to him in
person.</p>

<p>Then he burst out impulsively, "But I want you now to drink
another toast"&mdash;he looked down smilingly at
Agatha&mdash;"that of this young lady here, Miss Diana
Montgomery, the future Mrs. Peter Wardale," and thrusting his
hand into his back pocket he produced a little case and took out
of it the &pound;300 engagement ring.</p>

<p>A moment's breathless silence as he placed the ring on
Agatha's finger, and then came a burst of clapping and loud
cheers. "Bravo, bravo!" called out old Sir Michael. "Why, I've
give ten years of my life to be in your shoes, my boy!"</p>

<p>They were warmly congratulated on all sides and then Peter
called for another toast, "That of Mr. Ellister, Diana's uncle,
who is giving her to me."</p>

<p>It was well that Ramon had had the preceding short time to
get himself well under control. His first feeling had been one
of almost incredulous amazement, to be followed quickly by one
of furious rage. So this was what the little Jezebel had been
after! She had been playing with him all along!</p>

<p>He wreathed his face into some sort of smile as the toast was
drunk and then said laughingly, "Well, that's one trouble off my
mind. I tell you it's been no joke my having a good-looking
niece to look after, but my only hope now is that they get
everything they deserve."</p>

<p>The company clapped vigorously, but Agatha felt inclined to
shiver. She was under no illusion and sensed the threat to her
implied in his last words. Still, she was confident she would
manage to continue to outwit him. She knew too much about him
for him to dare to be openly hostile.</p>

<p>Ramon resumed his thoughts. Ah&mdash;it was she, of course,
who had written Braddock on his card! Douro must have told her
everything and she was now letting him, Ramon, know she knew, as
a sort of threat to make him leave her alone and not interfere
with her marrying the boy! Hell, how he hated her now! The
scales had fallen from his eyes and he realised what a fool he'd
been to ever hanker after her! If he'd got her she'd have soon
sickened him with her airs and frigid ways, and within a week or
two he'd have been beating her black and blue! He was well rid
of her, ah&mdash;but he'd make her smart for it! He must think
over what he must do.</p>

<p>In the meantime the commodore had slipped out of the room to
the telephone and after several tries got through to Larose at
the hotel where he usually stayed when in town. Larose told him
he'd only just returned from Paris where he'd been with some
friends of his wife's.</p>

<p>"I'm speaking from Esher," said the commodore, "I'm staying
at Wardale Court there."</p>

<p>"Wardale Court!" exclaimed Larose, very surprised. "Then you
know the Wardales?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Wardale is my second cousin," replied the
commodore. He spoke sharply. "Listen, I've got something
startling for you, a nice knot for us to disentangle. Peter
Wardale, the only son, is of age to-day, and comes into the
estate. There's a celebration dinner-party on here to-night
and&mdash;by hell&mdash;Ramon Ellister and that supposed niece
of his are among the guests. They're staying over to-morrow,
too, for the big dance."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Larose. "He didn't recognise
you!"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not! It wouldn't matter if he had. But
that's not the trouble. It's this. Not ten minutes ago young
Peter got up and announced to us all that he'd become engaged to
the girl and I understand he's going to marry her very
shortly."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he mustn't!" burst out Larose. "He must be warned at
once what she really is."</p>

<p>"Of course he mustn't marry her! That's what I'm ringing you
for now. It would be a catastrophe, for the girl's probably
Ellister's mistress. Now about opening his eyes. I won't say a
word to him to-night, and I think you'd better come down first
thing to-morrow and we'll do it together. He'll pay some
attention to what you tell him when he learns you've been
connected with the police at Scotland Yard. You'll come, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will!" replied Larose. "It's a duty to save him
from her." He whistled. "Gosh, but it'll be a ticklish thing to
do and not let this Ellister chap learn he's being trailed!
Anyhow, I'll be with you early to-morrow, and by then will have
thought out a sound plan." He spoke quickly. "But tell
me&mdash;is the girl as pretty as we've been told she is and as
I've told you she looked in the photograph I've seen of
her?"</p>

<p>The commodore heaved such a big sigh that Larose heard it
quite plainly through the receiver. "Mr. Larose," he replied
impressively, "she is one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen,
and, if everything we know about her were not so certain, I'd
swear she'd never done anything wrong in all her life. Just wait
till you see her and then you'll be feeling as damned sorry as I
am that she's got to be exposed."</p>

<p>"Hum," grunted Larose. "But, all the same, it's got to be
done," and he came away from the telephone with a troubled
expression upon his face.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that, to save all their energies for the
grand ball on the morrow, there was to be no dancing at the
Court that night. Instead, a popular music-hall artist had been
brought down from town and for an hour he entertained the guests
in the music-room. After that a flash-light photograph was taken
of everyone in a big group, with, of course, Peter and Agatha in
the centre. The photograph was to appear in a well-known Society
paper.</p>

<p>During the evening, Peter had whispered to his mother the
great secret that he and Agatha were to be married by special
licence on the following Monday. She had received the news with
a start and then, smiling rather sadly, had said that in that
case there would be a lot to arrange to get everything ready.
She added she was too tired to even think about it until she had
had a good night's rest, and Peter quite understood, as he had
noticed how pale she had been looking all the evening.</p>

<p>At eleven those of the guests who were not staying at the
Court for the night took their departure, and by half-past
everyone had gone upstairs. Soon the big house was wrapped in
darkness and in silence.</p>

<p>It had been a very happy evening for most of them, and who,
now sinking peacefully into slumber, could have imagined the
dreadful awakening which would follow on the morrow? Who could
have dreamed that the Angel of Death was already hovering over
the Court and waiting only for the predestined moment to fold
his wings and alight upon his ghastly mission?</p>

<p>Beryl Wardale was a long while going to sleep and she woke
early in the morning. Her thoughts were not happy ones. A quiet,
unsophisticated girl, she was fond of Peter and, up to a few
weeks back, had been quite sure he returned her affection and
would one day be asking her to become his wife.</p>

<p>The daughter of a by no means well-to-do clergyman and with
seven brothers and sisters, the match would have been a splendid
one for her, and she knew it would be a great disappointment to
her people when they learnt Peter was engaged to someone else.
Still, she had to acknowledge to herself that she could attach
no blame to Peter. This other girl who had come so suddenly into
his life was lovely enough to have attracted any boy. She did
wish, however, that he had not been so secretive and sprung the
engagement upon them without any warning. She knew it had been
as great a shock to her aunt as it had been to her.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the maid knocking upon her
door and, without waiting for any answer, coming hurriedly into
the room. "Miss Beryl," she said pantingly, "I can't get any
answer from Miss Montgomery and I think she must be ill. I've
knocked loudly at her door for quite a long time and she doesn't
answer. Her door is locked and I can't get in."</p>

<p>Beryl slipped on her dressing-gown and went back to Agatha's
door with her. Agatha's room was at the end of a passage. There
was a communicating door between it and the adjoining room, but
it was kept locked and against either side of it was a wardrobe
obscuring all sight of it, so that no one occupying either room
would have been aware the door was there. The adjoining room to
Agatha's had been allotted to one of Mrs. Wardale's maiden
sisters.</p>

<p>Beryl knocked loudly on Agatha's door. "Are you all right,
Diana? Don't you feel well?" she called out, and then, receiving
no answer and getting very anxious, she ordered the maid to go
to the housekeeper and obtain from her the key of the
communicating door. "She'll know where it is and she's to give
it to you at once."</p>

<p>Entering the aunt's room, she awoke her and explained what
had happened. The key was brought by the maid, and between them
they pushed the wardrobe aside and unlocked the door. The other
wardrobe was pushed away, too, and they stepped into the
room.</p>

<p>"Diana," called out Beryl nervously, "you've given us such a
fright. What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Getting no answer, she darted over to the bed and a cry of
horror burst from her lips. Agatha was lying very still and as
if her sleep were very deep, her face was of dreadful blue, her
mouth gaped and she breathed so quietly that it was almost as if
she did not breathe at all.</p>

<p>Beryl recovered her wits quickly. "Get some brandy, quickly!"
she ordered the maid. "And you, Aunt Mary, give it her directly
it comes. I'll go and ring up the doctor."</p>

<p>It was still only half-past seven and she got speech with the
doctor as he was dressing. She told him she thought Agatha was
in a bad faint and he said he'd come at once. He'd be there in
less than ten minutes. In the meantime they were to get hot-water
bags and place them over Agatha's heart and at her feet.
She was to be made as warm as possible.</p>

<p>Ordering the hot-water bags to be got ready instantly, Beryl
ran in and told her aunt. Mrs. Wardale was very frightened and
hopelessly incapable. However, she had sense enough left to tell
Beryl to wake Mr. Ellister at once. Ramon appeared astounded
and, putting on his dressing-gown, went in to see what he could
do. He shuddered when he saw Agatha's condition, and, stating he
could suggest nothing, went into the passage and stood outside
waiting the doctor's coming. He looked a ghastly white.</p>

<p>The doctor appeared with his bag in even less than the time
promised. He gave one look at Agatha and ejaculated, "It's not a
faint, she's poisoned! Is she in the habit of taking sleeping
tablets?"</p>

<p>But no one could tell him and he ordered Beryl to look about
quickly. He lifted one of Agatha's eyelids and exclaimed,
"Opium!" He smelt at her mouth and added, "Morphia!" He looked
very grave. "Any permanganate of potash in the house? You don't
know? Then I'll have to go and get some, and a stomach pump,
too. While I'm gone prepare some of the very strongest coffee
you can, pints of it."</p>

<p>He gave Agatha a quick hypodermic injection. "Is she very
ill?" asked Beryl tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Ill!" he exclaimed breathlessly. "Good God, she's almost
dead! She's hardly breathing," and he rushed precipitately from
the room.</p>

<p>He was back again even almost before they thought he would
have time to reach his house. He was quick, and, to the
trembling Beryl, it almost seemed ruthless, in his ministrations
to the stricken girl, but it was useless and soon Agatha had
ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>The doctor made a gesture of despair. "I was too late," he
said curtly. "She'd had a massive dose." He spoke very
sternly.</p>

<p>"Lock both these doors and I'll take the keys. It's a matter
for the police now, and I shall remain with her until they come.
No one must leave the house."</p>

<p>The awful news spread like wild fire through the Court, and
Peter sobbed and wailed like a little child. All the guests
dressed quickly and stood about with ashen faces, in awed little
groups. Already, it was whispered the doctor was of opinion
either that the girl had committed suicide or else had been
deliberately poisoned. By no chance, it was said he had stated,
could the large amount of morphia she had taken have been an
accidental overdose.</p>

<p>They glanced furtively at one another in horrified
bewilderment. Not for one moment did they imagine Agatha had
killed herself. How could she have done, they asked themselves,
when she had left them the previous night all joy and happiness
and radiant with the promise of life? She had been in the very
pride of her young womanhood, in perfect health and strength and
without, probably, a single care or anxiety to cast its shadow
over her.</p>

<p>Then, if she had not destroyed herself, it must be that
someone had murdered her, someone who even now was going about
among them, outwardly with a face heavy with grief, but inwardly
gloating over the dreadful deed he had done.</p>

<p>In not much longer than half an hour an inspector of police,
accompanied by his assistants, had arrived from Surbiton and,
after a few hurried words, with the doctor, repeated the warning
the latter had already given that no one was to leave the house
before being questioned.</p>

<p>Once in the bedroom, the inspector made a grimace as he
looked at the girl who had but a few hours before had been so
beautiful. "Not a pretty sight, is it?" he remarked. "You say
it's opium which killed her&mdash;laudanum, of course?"</p>

<p>"No, morphia," replied the doctor. "There was no smell of
opium about her breath and she didn't sweat as she would have
done with opium. No, I am confident it was morphia, and, as only
chemists and dispensers, people who have scales, handle the drug
in powder or crystals, I should say at a glance it was given her
in hypodermic tablets."</p>

<p>"Not injected?" queried the inspector.</p>

<p>The doctor pointed to a small table by the bedside, "No,
dissolved in the milk that was in that tumbler there. We shall
almost certainly find traces of it adhering to the sides."</p>

<p>"But why didn't the poisoner wash out the glass?" asked the
inspector.</p>

<p>"He didn't get any opportunity," said the doctor. "The girl
bolted her door when she came in here last night to go to bed.
Those two big wardrobes had to be shifted to get in here through
that other door."</p>

<p>"Who brought the milk up here? Have you asked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one of the maids did. The poor creature here, just
after dinner, asked her to put a glass of milk on her bed table,
as she would be taking two Aspros in it when she went to bed, to
make her sleep."</p>

<p>The inspector looked round the room. "And nothing's been
touched here since the girl passed away? All right then! And you
turned everyone out and locked both doors and kept the keys
yourself until you gave them to me? But have you looked to see
if there are any morphia tablets about?"</p>

<p>The doctor was preparing to take his leave. "Only just in a
very quick way when I first came, in her hand-bag and the top of
her suit-case." He smiled rather ruefully. "So, you've an open
field before you. One thing, too, you can remember in your
investigations. She was marrying into a big estate and someone
may have wanted to prevent it. Peter Wardale is a very wealthy
young man."</p>

<p>And, at that very moment when the doctor was leaving the
Court, Larose was ringing up Inspector Stone. "I can't stop a
minute now, Charlie," he said. "I'll be ringing again later
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But where the blazes have you been hiding yourself?" roared
Stone angrily. "For three days I've been trying to get you and
no one knew where you were."</p>

<p>"Sorry," exclaimed Larose, "but the wife and I went to Paris
and we hadn't left any address because we thought we should only
be away a couple of days."</p>

<p>"But why this awful hurry now?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"Because I'm going down to Wardale Court near Esher. The
commodore is staying there and he phoned me up last night.
Things look rather awkward for us there. Young Peter Wardale,
the heir to the estate, came of age yesterday, and last night
the commodore says he announced at the birthday dinner-party in
his honour that he had just become engaged&mdash;to whom, of all
girls, do you think?&mdash;why, to that Agatha Wandsworth, the
one who's been posing as Ellister's niece. The commodore is some
distant relation of the young man and we've got to get him out
of it."</p>

<p>"I should think so!" exclaimed Stone. "Why, of course, she's
Ellister's mistress!"</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose, "and the commodore got a fearful shock
when he found Ellister himself among the guests
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ellister there?" asked Stone excitedly. "And yesterday
afternoon and last night I was looking everywhere for him to
have a little talk. No one knew where he'd gone and we were half
thinking he'd jumped the country."</p>

<p>"But what did you want to speak to him for?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Never you mind," laughed Stone. "If you're in a hurry to get
away, so am I. At any rate I can't tell you all in one gulp over
the phone. Good-bye, good-bye! I'll be telling you later, and I
guess it'll be pretty soon now," and, to Larose's annoyance, he
jerked on the receiver.</p>

<p>Arriving at the entrance to the Court drive, Larose was
surprised to get a quick glimpse at what looked uncommonly like
a police ambulance coming out. He was more surprised still when,
arriving at the house, he came upon two unmistakable police cars
parked outside and a uniformed policeman standing by the open
front door. The policeman, too, barred his way when he made to
ring the bell.</p>

<p>"What's your business, sir?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm calling here," replied Larose. "What's up?"</p>

<p>The policeman did not answer his question. "You can't come
in, sir," he said quite respectfully, "until the inspector says
you may. If you tell me your name or, better still, give me your
card, I'll send it up to him."</p>

<p>"But what on earth&mdash;&mdash;" began Larose, when he was
saved from further expostulating by the appearance of Commodore
Smith behind the policeman. "It's all right," called out the
commodore, "but don't mention your name. I'll tell Inspector
Buckley. Wait there a minute."</p>

<p>Larose waited one minute: he waited two, and then the
commodore reappeared accompanied by a man in an inspector's
uniform. The latter frowned as he came forward to shake hands.
They had known each other in Larose's Scotland Yard days. "I
understand, Mr. Larose," he said, "that you've not come here on
business. It's just a private visit to Commodore Smith, isn't
it, arranged for over the phone last night?"</p>

<p>"That's it," nodded Larose, most surprised. "But what's
up?"</p>

<p>"Come inside," said the inspector, "and the commodore will
tell you. Excuse me. I'm very busy."</p>

<p>The commodore led Larose into a small room just off the big
lounge and very quickly put him in possession of all that had
happened.</p>

<p>"Good God, what a dreadful tragedy!" exclaimed Larose. "And
of course there's no suspicion of any particular person having
given it her?"</p>

<p>The commodore looked troubled. "Not really, but that damn
fool inspector has been putting Beryl Wardale, Peter's cousin,
in a fair way to make her cry her eyes out by his questions.
Some of the servants told him she was Peter's sweetheart until
this other girl came along and he jilted her, and he thinks
she's a case for suspicion because of it."</p>

<p>"But the family here ought to have someone to look after
their interests," said Larose, "particularly so, if the police
are making a set against this cousin."</p>

<p>"I'm going to do it," said the commodore&mdash;he gripped
Larose by the arm, "and you, my friend, are going to help
me."</p>

<p>"All right," nodded Larose. He smiled. "That inspector was
decidedly off-hand just now and I'd like to take him down a bit.
Let me have a talk with the mother. No one can object if you
make out I'm a friend of the family."</p>

<p>It was not destined, however, that Larose was to meet Mrs.
Wardale for a little while, because as they came out of the room
into the lounge, to the amazement of both of them, they almost
ran into Chief Inspector Stone, accompanied by two other men who
had 'plainclothes' written all over them.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" chuckled the stout inspector. "You didn't expect to
see me down here, did you?" His face sobered down instantly.
"No, I'm nothing to do with the girl here having been poisoned.
The constable outside has just told me about it. I knew nothing
of it before." He lowered his voice to a whisper. "Still, the
Surbiton police being here on that job will make mine easier. I
want to speak to that Ellister man. Can you tell me where he is
now?"</p>

<p>Larose couldn't, but the commodore could. "I think he's out
on the terrace. He was a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Then point him out to me," whispered Stone, "but don't let
him see you doing it."</p>

<p>The commodore led him to one of the windows of the big
lounge. "There he is on that bench by himself," and Stone, with
a nod of thanks, left the lounge with one of his assistants.</p>

<p>"What's he going to do?" asked the very puzzled commodore of
Larose.</p>

<p>Larose was frowning hard. "I'm not quite certain," he
replied, "but I think I can guess. You just watch."</p>

<p>But we must now go back to two days previously, to the
Tuesday afternoon, when Stone received a call from the solicitor
whose client the dead Douro had been for several years. The
solicitor knew Stone by reputation and had insisted on seeing
him in preference to anybody else.</p>

<p>"One of my clients," he began to the inspector, "was a Mr.
Joseph Douro who was unhappily drowned just over a week ago;
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember," nodded Stone, who was very busy and wanted to
to make the interview as short as possible. "He was drowned on
Hickling Broad when with his friend, Mr. Ramon Ellister. I read
all about it in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Well, I've just found this among his papers," went on the
lawyer, handing Stone a sealed envelope, "and, as you can see,
the instruction on it is most peculiar. I've not lost any time
in bringing it to you."</p>

<br>

<p><i>"If my decease,"</i> read the very puzzled Stone,
<i>"should at any time come suddenly or under mysterious
circumstances, or if I should meet with any fatal accident when
in the company of Mr. Ramon Ellister, my instructions are that
the enclosed letter should be taken at once to a responsible
official at Scotland Yard. If, however, I should die through
natural causes, and there is no possibility of Ramon Ellister
having had anything to do with my death, I solemnly enjoin my
heirs to burn this letter, unopened. Signed, Joseph
Douro."</i></p>

<br>

<p>The inspector read the instructions twice and then, with no
comment, slit the envelope open and proceeded to read what was
upon the single sheet of notepaper inside. He looked up
presently, with the expression upon his face, however, quite an
inscrutable one.</p>

<p>"Do you know this Mr. Ramon Ellister?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>The solicitor shook his head. "No, I've never heard of
him."</p>

<p>Stone rose from his chair to show that the interview was
over. "Thank you very much, sir," he said, "for bringing it to
us. It is most important." He smiled. "But, of course, the
information it contains is confidential. Still, I shall hope to
explain everything to you later on." His face became grave
again. "I know I need not impress upon you not to mention the
matter to anyone."</p>

<p>The solicitor went out and Stone's heavy face lightened to
something like a delighted grin. He read the letter over again
all the time with his jaw and lips working as if he were chewing
some delicious morsel.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"I, <span class="smcap">Joseph Douro</span>,
of Maple House, Kensington Square, am uneasy in my mind that
Ramon Ellister, stockbroker, of Burton Lane, City, joint
proprietor with me of the Old Regency Club, is no longer
friendlily disposed towards me. If that be so, knowing his
cruel, ruthless and treacherous nature, he may inflict upon me
some injury, even a fatal one, as to my certain knowledge he has
already committed murder more than once. If this letter should
ever reach Scotland Yard, under the specific instructions on
this envelope it will only be because he has murdered me.
Therefore, I have no compunction in disclosing one of his
crimes. I choose this particular one because it can be brought
home to him and he should hang for it. On May the 16th last he
murdered Professor Eric Mildmay, of the Gap House, Blackstone,
in Norfolk, with an axe, just outside his garden. Later, at
night, he brought the body away in his car and buried it on Mr.
Henson's property by Hickling Broad, about a quarter of a mile
distant from his own bungalow. Mr. Henson and his family were
away at the time. The body will be found about four feet down,
under a heap of rubbish at the end of a disused shed at the
bottom of the garden. Professor Mildmay was buried in his
clothes, wrapped round with a grey blanket which Ellister took
from his own house. He was killed because he had refused to sell
his house and Ellister wanted to buy it as he believed he had
found out there were things of value in the church vaults
underneath it.</p>

<p class="letter">"Signed,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">"Joseph Douro</span>.<br>
May 30th, 1927."</p>

<br>

<p>The inspector breathed heavily. "It rings true! It is no
ghastly joke! This Douro had a proper estimation of Ellister's
character, and he was right the fellow meant to kill him!" He
smiled delightedly. "Won't friend Gilbert be surprised?"</p>

<p>The following morning Stone, accompanied by a brother
inspector, was driven down into Norfolk, and after a brief
conversation with the Chief Constable in Norwich a little party,
in two cars and an ambulance, proceeded to Hickling Broad to
interview Mr. Henson. The latter turned out to be a retired
clergyman, and, an excitable, fussy little man, he was very
astonished when the Chief Constable and Stone presented their
cards and he learnt who they were. He was more astonished still
when they explained their errand to him.</p>

<p>"A body buried in my shed!" he exclaimed aghast. "It is
impossible! Why, I've recently turned it into a poultry house!
I've got more than forty birds installed there and they are
laying well. They must on no account be frightened. The whole
story sounds preposterous to me and I don't like them being
disturbed. Remember, in this country a man's home is his
castle."</p>

<p>With some persuasion, however, he was prevailed upon to let
the birds be turned into the garden upon a policeman being
entrusted with the duty of keeping them off the vegetable and
flower-beds. Stone's heart sank a little when they got into the
shed. It had been whitewashed and tidied up and looked
altogether much too spick and span to be hiding such a ghastly
secret as the body of a murdered man.</p>

<p>However, they started digging up at once, and very quickly
realised their search was not going to be a fruitless one, as
the horrible taint of rotted flesh assailed their nostrils. A
piece of cloth-like substance came into view.</p>

<p>"Steady, steady," warned Stone to the diggers, "don't pull at
it. That's the blanket it was wrapped in. Dig all round."</p>

<p>The entire cloth was exposed, and very carefully it and its
horrible contents were lifted out of the hole. The clergyman,
feeling very sick, immediately retired, looking ghastly white.
The cloth was flung back and, holding their breath, everyone
bent over the corpse. It was quite unrecognisable. Where the axe
had crashed into the forehead could be seen plainly.</p>

<p>"It will be impossible for anyone to recognise it by the
features," whispered the Chief Constable, with all his
experience of war and police work, awed by the nauseating
appearance of the corpse.</p>

<p>"But those shoes would make it easy," commented Stone. "See,
there's the maker's name on the tabs, and they look to me hand-made
and almost new. Yes, the maker should remember them."</p>

<p>And a couple of hours later a Norwich bootmaker did. He had
supplied them to Professor Mildmay in the previous March and was
certain they were his as the upper of one of them was slightly
different from that of the other. The professor had had a
pronounced enlargement of the joint of the left big toe.</p>

<p>Back in town, the inspector obtained a warrant for the arrest
of Ellister and, aware of the man's desperate and reckless
character, resolved to carry it out himself. He just missed
Ramon both at his office and his flat in South Kensington. At
both places, he was told, he had been gone only a few minutes.
All that night watch was kept near the Old Regency Club until
the last reveller had gone, but the morning found the detective
still at a dead end, and they were now fearing the wanted man
had somehow had warning and bolted into hiding. Then, imagine
the inspector's intense relief when the next morning Larose rang
him up and told him where Ramon was.</p>

<p>We must now return to the moment when, after Stone's arrival
at the Court, Ramon had been pointed out to him and he had gone
out on the terrace, as he said, to speak to him.</p>

<p>With the police swarming all over the place, Ramon was not at
all surprised when he saw Stone and the other man, both of them
so obviously detectives, approaching him as he was sitting by
himself in front of the Court. His handsome face darkened and he
frowned irritably at the thought of his now going to be pestered
with more questions.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ellister, I believe," said the inspector most politely,
and Ramon nodded haughtily, without, however, making any
movement to rise. That did not suit Stone's book, as it is not
as easy to slip the handcuffs on a man when he is sitting down
as when he is standing up. Then, one lightning movement when he
is not expecting it, the handcuffs are on his wrists, and there
is no rough-and-tumble scrambling and, perhaps, much tearing of
clothes. Stone was always most careful about his uniform.</p>

<p>Stone's attitude was one of respect, as was surely only
natural when a policeman is asking a favour of a well-dressed
and important gentleman. "Then, please can I have a word with
you, sir," he said, "and, if you don't mind, we'll go indoors
where we are not so likely to be interrupted."</p>

<p>Without a word, Ramon rose to his feet and proceeded by the
inspector's side along the terrace. The inspector's companion
followed after them. They had, however, taken only half a dozen
steps when Ramon was grabbed fiercely from behind, his arms were
lugged to his back and, quicker than it takes to tell, the
handcuffs were clicking on his wrists. Stone and the detective
each laid hold of an arm, just below the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I arrest you," said Stone quietly, "for the murder of Eric
Mildmay and I warn you anything you say will be used in evidence
against you."</p>

<p>Strong and in perfect health though he was, Ramon would have
fallen to the ground if the detectives had not been holding him.
His face was white as death and his expression one of horrible
surprise. He panted as if he had been running.</p>

<p>"Bring him along," said Stone, and, after his clothes and
pockets had been gone through to make sure he carried neither
weapon nor poison, he was half led and half carried to one of
the waiting-police cars and lodged on the back seat, with a
detective on either side.</p>

<p>And all the while Larose, and the commodore with eyes widely
dilated, had been watching through the window what had happened.
For the moment the commodore, at all events, was too astounded
to make any comment.</p>

<p>With Ramon safe in the car, the inspector, his heavy face now
all wreathed in smiles, returned to them and in a few brief
words told them of the letter he had received and what had
happened afterwards.</p>

<p>"But as it stands at present," he concluded, "I see some
difficulty ahead in bringing home the crime to him. He may say
that Douro himself did it and that he only came in after it had
been done. Still, we've got him for some time anyhow, and when
we come to go through all his places, his office, his flat and
that bungalow and the Gap House, we may find a lot to strengthen
our case."</p>

<p>"And about the death of this girl here," asked the commodore,
his breath still coming short at the amazing turn things had
taken, "are you going to stop and help in the enquiry?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" replied Stone. "For the moment it's nothing
at all to do with the Yard, though, of course, we may be called
into it." He turned to Larose. "Do you think it's more dirty
work of this fellow Ellister?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "I certainly should," he replied, "if only I
could light on the motive, for it seems incredible there could
be two murderers under one roof at the same time. Murderers are
not so plentiful that they are found in batches."</p>

<p>The inspector went off with his prisoner, but Larose was not
able to have his talk with Mrs. Wardale, as the scandal of one
of their visitors being arrested for murder, following upon the
awful shock of Agatha's death from poison, had been too much for
her and she was quite incapable of talking to anyone. However,
he was able to speak to Beryl and heartened her up a lot by
explaining that, as a matter of routine, policemen always
suspected everyone and the questions put to her did not mean
necessarily that the Surbiton police inspector was suspecting
her in particular.</p>

<p>"But I am so grieved for Aunt," said Beryl. "This is the
second terrible misfortune which has come into her life. Uncle
Charles, her husband, met with a motor accident eleven years ago
and for three months was in dreadful agony before he died. She's
been a different woman and has had very little spirit in her
since."</p>

<p>Larose left her greatly consoled with his promise that he was
going to take a private hand in the enquiry and sought out
Inspector Burton to have a word with him. He found him examining
one of the servants and, to his obvious annoyance at being
interrupted, drew him to one side.</p>

<p>"See here, Inspector," he said warningly, "you go easy with
that Miss Wardale. She's not likely to be the guilty party and
you won't do yourself any good if you worry her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't, shan't I?" frowned the inspector. He spoke
sharply. "But I tell you, Mr. Larose, no matter whom I have to
question, I'm going to do what I think is my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," agreed Larose instantly, "I don't
doubt that for a moment, but I thought I'd give you a little bit
of inside information. The dead girl was not Ellister's niece.
They were no relation, only just crooks together and members of
a gang. Well, crooks are always falling out among themselves,
aren't they? So what is more likely than that another crook
killed her?" He nodded. "And don't you forget it's for another
murder her supposed uncle's just been arrested. See?"</p>

<p>And he left the astonished inspector too flabbergasted to
think of any reply.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a if="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE MAN OF DEATH.</h2>

<p class="first">THE so dramatic arrest of Ramon Ellister at
Wardale Court, coupled with the mysterious death of the
beautiful young girl whom it had been supposed was his niece,
provided a great feast of sensation for the general public. For
a few days, however, they were kept entirely in the dark as to
what was going on behind the scenes and the startling
discoveries which were being made by the Criminal Investigation
Department of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>In Ramon's big safe in his beautiful flat in South Kensington
had been found several of the articles stolen at the burglary at
Bentham Hall earlier in the year, including all the old
manuscript so valued by Sir Jeremy. Also, to Larose's great
delight when he was shown it, the prayer-book which had once
belonged to Father Francesco and with his name scrawled on the
fly-leaf.</p>

<p>"That's the missing link, Charlie," he exclaimed, "and
explains why Ellister first came to go after the treasure in
those vaults, but how he got hold of this book in the first
instance I suppose we shall never learn."</p>

<p>"Of course, now," nodded Stone, "we are going to charge him
with the murder of Sir Jeremy's butler as well. Don't forget at
the inquest on the poor chap it was thought some weapon like a
knuckle-duster had been used to inflict his dreadful injuries,
and we found a knuckle-duster in Ellister's safe, and also an
automatic." He rubbed his hands delightedly. "Oh, yes, more and
more evidence is piling up against this blackguard."</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that even more evidence was yet to
come, for the very next day, under the flooring of Ramon's
bedroom in the flat, was found a secret hiding-place containing
a large quantity of illicit drugs, cocaine, opium, morphia and
heroin.</p>

<p>Then came what the Yard thought as damning a piece of
evidence of Ellister's murderous proclivities as they had yet
found, for proceeding to search Agatha's apartments in Maida
Vale, there right before their eyes on the mantelshelf was the
letter Ramon had written her, warning her that if she did not
marry him she should not 'marry anyone at all'. She had never
called for it and it had remained there awaiting her return.</p>

<p>"And what more do we want?" asked Stone. "We have the threat
here that he would murder her if she defied him. We know she
<i>did</i> defy him, and we know equally well he was in
possession of enormous quantities of the drug which poisoned
her." He thumped his desk. "So murder number three will be put
to his account."</p>

<p>The enquiry as to whom of the others at the Court might have
given Agatha the morphia was at once dropped, and the local
inspector who had been so zealously conducting it was both a
relieved and disappointed man. Relieved that he would not now be
faced with failure, and disappointed because he had not thought
of Ellister at once as the guilty party.</p>

<p>"There was his room," he told a brother inspector, "in the
same passage and only three doors off from hers. Of course, as
her supposed uncle, he could have gone to her room any time to
talk to her, and what is more likely than that he went there the
last thing that night to pretend to give her his private
congratulations on the engagement? Then, if he had come when she
was in the bathroom&mdash;we knew she did have a quick bath
before she went to bed&mdash;then what would have been easier
than for him to slip the morphia in that glass of milk when she
was out of the room?"</p>

<p>Larose was being kept informed of all the discoveries the
Yard had made, but, for all that, was a little bit curious as to
the reason for Stone's insistency when the latter rang him one
morning about a week later and stated he wanted to see him at
once.</p>

<p>"At once, Gilbert, if you can manage it," said the inspector
sharply. "I've something very important to tell you."</p>

<p>Larose was staying at Wardale Court, where it seemed his
company along with that of Commodore Smith was proving a great
comfort both to Mrs. Wardale and Beryl.</p>

<p>"I feel so safe, with you here, Mr. Larose," Beryl had said
once, rather tearfully, "for it's such a mercy to us our not
being alone. You are doing such a lot of good to Peter, too, and
I'm sure he's beginning at last to realise that girl did not
care for him at all. You've talked to him so tactfully and I
know he wouldn't have let anyone else speak about her&mdash;not
even to mention her name. But with you it's been different all
along."</p>

<p>Upon receiving the inspector's call, Larose went up to town
at once and was quickly closeted with Stone.</p>

<p>"Well, Charlie," he asked smilingly, "what is it now? Another
body dug up somewhere?" and, to his amazement, Stone nodded,
"Yes."</p>

<p>The inspector went on sharply, "Now, Gilbert, you've never
told me a lie, have you&mdash;a real big lie, I mean, not a
fib?"</p>

<p>Larose flushed hotly. "Certainly not, Charlie! I may have
often pulled your leg and kept back little things that it wasn't
vital you should know, but I've never, never told you a direct
lie."</p>

<p>"Good, and I believe you," nodded Stone. He looked Larose
straight in the face and went on very slowly. "Then tell me, my
son, did you know the body of that man Braddock was buried in
those vaults?"</p>

<p>Larose almost jumped out of his chair and his surprise was
obviously so genuine that the inspector knew what his answer was
going to be before he spoke. "No, I didn't, Charlie," he
replied. He was frowning angrily. "I swear to you I didn't."</p>

<p>Stone smiled his expansive, pleasant smile. "All right, all
right, Gilbert, don't get cross. I'll take your word for it; I
believe you, my son." His face sobered down. "But it was. It had
been buried in that priest's grave where the commodore found the
treasure!" He lowered his voice to a whisper. "And what do you
think? He'd been killed with a bullet from the same gun we found
in Ellister's flat! The experts have verified it. He'd been shot
in the back of the head."</p>

<p>Larose felt furious. In a lightning flash it had come to him
what had happened. The commodore, in an impish schoolboy trick,
had dug up the body from where his cousin had buried it and put
it in Francesco's grave for Ellister to find it when he went
after the treasure!</p>

<p>For the moment Larose was far too angry to make any comment,
and then the humour of it struck him and, try hard as he did to
suppress it, he burst into a hearty laugh. He pictured the
mortified bewilderment of the two conspirators when, after all
their scheming and expense, instead of the gold and jewels they
had been expecting, they had come upon the corpse of one of
their confederates in crime.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" asked Stone frowningly. "What do
you see funny in it?"</p>

<p>Larose wiped his eyes with his handkerchief. "Why&mdash;the
thought of this chap having piled up evidence upon evidence
against himself! Good Heavens, this will be murder number
four!"</p>

<p>"Of course it will," nodded Stone, now all smiles, too, "and
it's a great relief to my mind, as, at any rate, we'll get him
for certain on this charge, if not on any of the others.
Evidently he and Braddock had a quarrel and he bumped him off
and thought it a fine place to hide the body."</p>

<p>"But how did you know whose body it was?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was very puzzled at first, but then I remembered
suddenly about that Mrs. Braddock who had come enquiring about
her missing son, a friend of Ellister's. Poor woman, she
identified him at once, by his clothes and a signet ring on one
of the fingers!"</p>

<p>Larose looked uneasy. "But don't you think you'll get
Ellister on the other charges, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>Stone pursed up his lips doubtfully. "I'm not too sure about
that butler at Bentham Hall, or even about the professor.
Ellister can easily say it was Douro who killed them both. We
know his solicitors cabled to Buenos Aires, where Douro came
from about four years ago, and found out he'd been nearly
indicted for murder there. He was in some quarrel with several
others where a man was fatally stabbed, and though he was not
actually charged with the death, at any rate he thought it
wisest to get out of the country. So Ellister may make out Douro
was always the man of violence and has all along been the
killer."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "How can we prove the contrary? I
tell you that's going to be a nasty snag for us."</p>

<p>When Larose returned to the Court and got speech with the
commodore alone, he turned on him angrily. "Look here,
Commodore," he said, "it's not been very decent of you to be
double-crossing me as you've been doing. After all, I came in to
help your cousin, and, as you know, may be bringing myself in
for a lot of unpleasantness in consequence. Why, I may even be
struck off the roll of Justices of the Peace when I have to
admit in open court that I connived with you in keeping the fact
of your cousin's death from the police and misleading them into
thinking he was only missing!" He spoke most reproachfully.
"Surely, I deserved some consideration at your hands!"</p>

<p>The commodore looked flabbergasted at Larose's outburst. "But
what have I done?" he asked. He was most indignant. "I've never
double-crossed you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have!" snapped Larose. "Who dug up the body of
that man your cousin shot and put it in&mdash;&mdash;" But,
suddenly, there came up to him again a vision of the faces of
Ellister and Douro while bending over the corpse, and he could
not keep his own face straight. He burst out laughing, and, this
time, let himself go. A few moment's hesitation and the
commodore lost his shame-faced look and burst into laughter,
too. They both laughed until the tears came into their eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;it&mdash;was&mdash;a good joke," exclaimed
Larose chokingly, "but you oughtn't to have done it." He sobered
down. "Now that wretch will hang for a murder he's not done,"
and he related what Stone had told him and how the bullet in
Braddock's head had been proved to come from an automatic found
in Ellister's flat.</p>

<p>"Well, it won't matter, will it?" said the commodore. "He'll
be hanging for the other murders as well!" and then, encouraged
by Larose's still amused and smiling face, he told him about his
writing Braddock's name upon Ellister's card on the dinner table
and the consternation of the latter when he had caught sight of
it.</p>

<p>Larose expressed his disapproval again, though admitting it
must have been a good joke. Then a thought came to him and he
said frowningly, "But I say&mdash;there may be nasty trouble for
us ahead. Ellister is sure to deny the pistol was his, and what
if they trace it to your cousin? The police will see at once
it's been very little used and looks quite new. They may make
enquiries all round to find out who bought it and when."</p>

<p>The commodore appeared most uneasy. "That's awkward! I never
thought about it. And he bought it so close to where he lives,
too. Still, how can Ellister explain its being in his possession
unless he admits taking it off my cousin?"</p>

<p>"That'll be easy," scoffed Larose. "He can say he found it in
the vaults, or he may even go so far as to admit they tried to
get into the house that night and your cousin shot Braddock
then. You see, Ellister's in a tight corner and he may admit a
lot to save his neck." He heaved a big sigh. "Still, it's no
good worrying. We'll have to wait and see how things turn
out."</p>

<p>Leaving the Court next day, with the promise, however, that
he would stay there again during the trial, Larose paid another
visit to Balham. For one thing, he wanted to show Mrs. Benson
the photographs of the birthday group in the press and be
certain once and for all that Diana Montgomery had really been
Agatha Wandsworth. An uneasy feeling had often troubled him
there might be some ghastly mistake.</p>

<p>But no&mdash;Mrs. Benson assured him it was the same girl and
he came away satisfied. To make doubly, sure, however, he showed
it to the woman who kept the little lending library and she was
positive, too.</p>

<p>"She'd have been equal to anything," she nodded emphatically,
"and quite capable of deceiving anyone. I always told her she
put on the airs and graces of a duchess."</p>

<p>Ellister was to be tried at the new Old Bailey, and, as the
eventful day approached, Larose was feeling the more and more
uneasy. As he had told the commodore, things might be very
unpleasant for him at the trial, and, at best, he was expecting
a sharp rebuke from the presiding judge for making out to the
police Professor Mildmay was 'missing' while all the time he
knew he was dead.</p>

<p>There was another nasty hurdle, too, to be got over. The
commodore's mind was not a trained one, like his, Larose's, and
he might easily make some slip in giving his evidence and put
Counsel who was defending Ellister upon the track of making it
certain it had been the professor who had shot Braddock. God! he
thought, and a cold shiver ran down his spine. They were
deliberately fastening upon Ellister a murder which they knew he
had not done! Suppose he were acquitted of the other murders and
hanged for that one only! Why, if it came out, it would mean
hard labour for twenty years for him and the commodore. The
thought was too horrible to contemplate.</p>

<p>Then, three days before the trial, an amazing thing happened.
Stone rang him up to come and see him at once, and his voice
over the phone sounded so curt and peremptory that Larose felt
most uncomfortable at once. He was not reassured, either, when,
upon shaking hands with the stout inspector, he noted how
worried the latter looked. Worse, however, was to come.</p>

<p>"Look here, Gilbert," said Stone sharply, "I'm not satisfied
with your evidence or that of the commodore, either. I don't
think it'll do us any good. For one thing, you've been taking
too darned much upon yourselves, and, for another, the jury
mayn't necessarily believe you. You hoaxed the police by making
out the professor was missing when all along you knew he was
dead, and the court may think you're deceiving them again. In
effect, your evidence is tainted."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think so?" frowned Larose, feeling most
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The inspector nodded sternly. "Yes, I do." He spoke more
pleasantly. "You see, Gilbert, you must know quite well that we
shall not be allowed to put in that damning letter of Douro's as
evidence. The judge won't let the jury see it, for what a dead
man has written is not evidence, as he can't be examined as to
its truth or falseness. So, probably, we shan't even be able to
mention the source of the information which enabled us to find
the professor's body. We shall just have to say the usual 'from
information received'. You follow me, don't you?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded, and Stone went on. "Well, see in what an
atmosphere of mystery and secrecy we shall start off with, and
the jury may even imagine you or the commodore had something to
do with the burying as well as with the finding of the
body."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that," said Larose uncomfortably, "and it'll
be very awkward."</p>

<p>"Then take another thing," went on Stone. "We shall have
shown Ellister's unusual interest in the Gap House by the huge
price he paid for it at the sale, and it would certainly greatly
strengthen our case against him if we could prove the professor
was killed by someone spying about the garden&mdash;if Mildmay
was, so to speak, killed on the very spot round which all the
mysterious interest was centring."</p>

<p>"You mean," frowned Larose, "instead of if he had wandered
away and been killed somewhere where there was no apparent
motive for his murder."</p>

<p>"That's it," exclaimed the inspector, "where his death was
not associated with his house and the mystery which was
shrouding it." He frowned heavily. "Well, are we in a position
to make that strong point that he was killed in his own garden?
Dare we attempt to bring it off?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Larose. "The commodore's evidence will prove
it."</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "I don't think so." He spoke slowly and
emphatically. "When the commodore goes into the witness-box and
testifies to having seen his cousin lying dead by the garden
wall that late afternoon, as I say, the defence will jump to it
immediately that his story cannot be relied upon with his
admission of having already deceived the public once"&mdash;the
inspector looked very stern&mdash;"and, mark you, Gilbert, with
your connivance."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair. "That's my point, Gilbert," he
went on. "Neither he nor you will come into the court with clean
hands, and I'm afraid it will make things go badly for us."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Larose asked, with a deep
sigh, "But how can we help it? What can you do, Charlie?"</p>

<p>Stone's answer electrified him. "Leave you both out," he
exclaimed sharply. "Not call either of you. Use all the
information you gave us, but make out"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"we
discovered it for ourselves." He bent over confidingly towards
Larose. "Neither your evidence nor that of the commodore is
necessary for the building up of our case. We can get on quite
well without it. The very fact of the body being found buried
near Ellister's bungalow and wrapped in his blanket should be
quite sufficient to clinch everything. So we shall say nothing
about the professor coming to see you or you going to the Gap
House, or even about the finding of the treasure. We'll keep on
safe ground. Don't you think it best?"</p>

<p>Larose's relief was prodigious, but he managed to hide it.
"Yes, I do," he said, as if judicially. "I think you're quite
right." Then he asked. "But tell me, Charlie, how do you now
think the charges will go on the whole?"</p>

<p>Stone ticked them off on his fingers. "Sir Jeremy's
butler&mdash;doubtful; Braddock&mdash;good; the girl&mdash;a
certainty, and Mildmay&mdash;not bad!" He pursed up his lips.
"Still, we know they're working devilish hard to get an
acquittal about the professor. They've been going through all
the gun shops in Norfolk with a fine comb to find out if he'd
bought a pistol anywhere. Evidently Ellister is going to deny
the pistol is his."</p>

<p>The fateful day at last arrived and the court was packed with
the fortunate, curious, morbid, or idle who had managed by hook
or by crook to obtain admittance.</p>

<hr>

<p>(The trial lasted seven days, but in the report which follows
the intervals and adjournments are skipped and, for the
convenience of the reader, the happenings are given as an
uninterrupted whole.&mdash;Author's note.)</p>

<p>Lord Hume was the presiding judge, and, though well on into
the seventies, it was generally conceded the scales of Justice
could not be held in steadier hands. With the face and eyes of
an eagle, he was a grim old man with a masterful manner and
biting wit. Woe betide any counsel, however eminent, who for one
moment believed himself the most important person in any court.
He would be summarily put back into his place, as if he were the
newest junior who had taken silk.</p>

<p>One thing, however, about his lordship did not please
everyone. A great jurist, it was said by some he was too hide-bound
in certain of his ideas and much too inclined to want to
split hairs in his interpretation of some comparatively trivial
points of law.</p>

<p>Archer Wain, K.C., was leading for the Crown, and, a tall,
handsome man of commanding presence in the middle forties, his
expression in repose was one of a somewhat bored cynicism. No
one, however, could drive home better the logic of hard facts,
and he impressed juries by the impelling force of his arguments.
Not given easily to the display of emotion, when need be he
could yet rise to impassioned eloquence and then his eyes would
flash and his burning words sear into the minds of his audience.
It was agreed that if he had not been a great advocate he would
have made a great actor.</p>

<p>Mark Bollington, also a K.C., was cast in a very different
mould. He was stout and massive, with a huge head coming
straight from his shoulders. His eyes were large and ox-like
under big heavy brows and he would glower like an angered bull
at any witness whose evidence was not pleasing him. His voice
was harsh and strident when he was thundering to a jury, but it
could drop to soft and silky tones when it suited him to appear
reasonable and docile.</p>

<p>His lordship enthroned upon his dais, Ramon Anthony Ellister
came up into the dock and seated himself nonchalantly and as if
without much interest in what was going to take place. He was
smartly groomed, but to those who had known him before he now
looked very different. His face was paler, he looked much
thinner and his eyes seemed to have sunk into his head.</p>

<p>With the charges read, upon a nod from the judge Archer Wain
rose to his feet. He commenced very quietly in nicely modulated
tones.</p>

<p>The prisoner, he said, was being arraigned on four charges
spread over many months, but they were all being taken together,
not only as a matter of convenience but, also, because, in a
way, they were all interwoven with one another. If Robert
Hansom, the butler of Bentham Hall, had not died, then Eric
Mildmay would not have been killed with an axe, Eden Braddock
would not have been shot with a pistol and the woman Agatha
Wandsworth would not have been drawn into the orbit of a master
criminal and ultimately come to an untimely death by poison.</p>

<p>He raised his voice ever so little here. And he would prove
to the court that the accused was a master criminal, a man who
had chosen crime as his profession, just as ordinary men pursued
ordinary callings. He would prove, too, that he had pursued it
for many years with zeal and energy, as if it were the obsession
of his life. Long and patient investigations into his career had
been made, extending to even before the times of the committing
of these crimes upon which the present charge had been laid. It
had been found he had been thief, cardsharper, promoter of
illegal games, burglar and murderer, and that he had been often
engaged in all these activities at one and the same times.</p>

<p>It would be shown that he had been the prime mover in a gang
of criminals and for the past three years, at all events, had
been working in partnership with a Joseph Douro and this Eden
Braddock with whose murder he was now charged. This would be
proved from the banking transactions of the three men, as from
time to time the accused had been paying considerable sums of
money to both Douro and Braddock, no doubt as their share in the
criminal transactions which had been carried out.</p>

<p>But he, Archer Wain, had a long row to harrow, so he would
proceed at once to bring witnesses to substantiate the damning
statements he had made.</p>

<p>It was at once evident, as Wain had said, that most patient
and far-reaching investigations had been made into Ramon's past.
Several well-known Society hosts were put into the witness-box
to testify that when Ramon or one of his intimate friends, of
late years Douro, had been staying with them as a guest, very
shortly afterwards their houses had been burgled and valuable
property stolen. In one case it was mentioned, too, that a
servant had met his death.</p>

<p>With these witnesses finished with, Archer Wain started upon
the specific charges against Ramon, and he took that of the
murder of the butler at Bentham Hall first. He told how Ramon
had been a guest at the Hall less than three weeks before the
burglary had been committed and he went on to detail all the
happenings of the burglary, the killing of Robert Hansom and
how, some months later, the police had found many of the stolen
articles in the safe in Ramon's flat.</p>

<p>Producing witness after witness in support of his statements,
to the amazement of the spectators in the court, the usually
bellicose Mark Bollington never asked any of them a single
question. He just leant back in his seat and, looking supremely
bored and almost as if he were half asleep, let the whole charge
against the accused go by default.</p>

<p>Next, Wain proceeded to the murder of the professor. He
related the persistent efforts to induce him to sell the house,
his sudden disappearance, and the extraordinarily high price
which the accused had ultimately been willing to pay for the
house at the public auction sale. He went on to tell how the
police, acting upon 'information received', had dug up the body
of the missing professor, fully clothed, in the garden of a
bungalow close to that of the accused. He told in what a
dreadful way the professor had come to meet his death and how
his body, before burial, had been wrapped in a grey blanket
exactly similar to others found in the accused's bungalow.</p>

<p>Then Wain dealt at some length with the motive for the murder
as made clear when the police had opened the accused's safe and
examined the breviary and the stolen manuscript there.</p>

<p>"Now everyone will be able to realise," he declaimed here,
"as I stated in my opening remarks, how closely linked to one
another are all these dreadful crimes." He shrugged his
shoulders. "As to whether the accused and his co-criminals
obtained any treasure from the grave in those vaults, we do not
know. Only two persons other than the accused could have told
us"&mdash;he paused significantly&mdash;"and they are both dead.
One, I shall prove to you the accused himself killed, and the
other, Joseph Douro"&mdash;he paused again, even longer this
time, and looked intently from one to the other of the
jury&mdash;"was drowned one night on Hickling Broad when out in
a rowing boat alone with the same man!"</p>

<p>Mark Bollington, his face red with anger, sprang fiercely to
his feet, but then&mdash;almost as quickly&mdash;subsided into
his seat again. If he had been going to protest about anything,
then undoubtedly, he had thought better of it. He resumed his
bored expression.</p>

<p>Of all the witnesses called by Wain in relation to the murder
of the professor, the only ones of whom Bollington asked any
questions were a labourer from Blackstone village who worked on
the roads, the professor's one-time daily woman and the jobbing
gardener occasionally employed by him.</p>

<p>The labourer had testified to having seen two men in a car
drive up to the Gap House a few days after it had been sold and,
a day or two later, what he took to be the same car going in the
direction of the house with a ladder strapped on to the side. In
his cross-examination of him Bollington dwelt strongly upon the
man's absolute conviction that on neither occasion had there
been more than two men in the car.</p>

<p>When dealing with the housekeeper and the gardener the K.C.
did his utmost to make them suggest that though they had never
seen the professor with a pistol or had been aware he possessed
one, still it was quite possible there might have been one in
the house. With the gardener his line of questioning was fairly
successful, as the man was obviously unobservant and slow-witted.
With the daily woman, however, it was a complete
failure, as she stated most emphatically that there could not
possibly have been any pistol about. She insisted, over and over
again, that nothing was kept under lock and key, and, as she did
all the professor's mending for him, she had access to all his
drawers and cupboards.</p>

<p>That ended the matter of the murder of the professor and he
passed next to that of Eden Braddock. He stressed strongly the
close co-operation in their unlawful activities between the
accused and the murdered man during the preceding three years,
as evidenced by the cheques which had passed between them. Then
he dwelt upon Mrs. Braddock's insistence that of late the two
had not been on mutual trusting terms and, finally, he pressed
home how Braddock's body, with a bullet from the accused's
automatic in the head, had been found buried where only the
accused or Douro could have placed it. He altogether discounted
the idea of Douro being the murderer, as the accused's was the
master mind, the quest for the hidden treasure was inspired by
him and it was his pistol from which the fatal bullet had
come.</p>

<p>Under Wain's examination, Mrs. Braddock stated she had no
belief that her son's occupation had been anything but perfectly
lawful. She said his speciality as an engineer was in advising
people who were taking out patents. She knew he had once been
very friendly with the accused, but lately he had spoken of him
as a man not to be trusted and who would do anything to anyone
against whom he had a spite. It was that remark which had made
her so suspicious of the accused when her son had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Severely handled by Bollington in his cross-examination, she
had to admit that she did not know for certain and that it was
only conjecture on her part that there had been an absolute
quarrel.</p>

<p>That finished with the case of Braddock, and Archer Wain
passed on to that of Agatha Wandsworth. Here, he said, the jury
should have no doubt it was a case of deliberate murder by the
accused. It was not necessary to go into the character of the
dead girl or to trace back far into her life. It did not matter
if, as a decoy at the old Regency Club, her character had been
anything but one beyond reproach. The only thing to be
considered was that the accused had conceived a violent passion
for her and threatened her with a dreadful vengeance if she gave
her affections anywhere else. She <i>had</i> given her
affections elsewhere, and, no doubt, the accused had received a
horrible surprise when her engagement to another man had been so
dramatically announced at that dinner-party at Wardale
Court.</p>

<p>Then the accused, a masterful, impetuous man, without doubt
for the moment becoming mentally unbalanced, had proceeded to
carry out his vengeance with the least possible delay. There was
the motive for the murder, as shown by his letter to her; there
was the opportunity, with his room close to hers and the glass
of milk she was going to drink standing on her table, and there
were the means of carrying out the crime with the deadly drug in
his possession.</p>

<p>No doubt he had felt quite safe he would not be found out,
for, not being aware there was no such relationship between
them, who would have suspected the uncle of being a discarded
lover? Who would have imagined the courtly smiling gentleman at
that dinner-table, the prosperous City stockbroker, the so
well-known frequenter of Society circles&mdash;to be a burglar, a
trafficker in stolen drugs and possibly a murderer?</p>

<p>With the witnesses called, when it came to their
cross-examinations Bollington at last seemed to take a little more
interest. He elicited from Beryl Wardale that the accused had
gone a ghastly colour when she had told him of Agatha's dying
condition, and from the Surbiton inspector that practically
anyone in the Court could have got into Agatha's room and put
the poison in the glass of milk. Also, he got out of the maid,
whom Agatha had asked for the milk, that several people had been
standing near when she had made her request and would have heard
what she said. The maid, however, could not remember who any of
the listeners had been.</p>

<p>Rising heavily to open his speech for the defence, Bollington
said he must admit straightaway that the accused was not a
pleasing type of individual to defend, as it was undoubted that
he had been an enemy of the community and preying on it for many
years.</p>

<p>He was one of the worst kinds of criminals, too, as there was
no excuse for him, being brought up, as he had been, in good
surroundings and given the education fitting to make of him a
good citizen.</p>

<p>Still, that was not the question for anyone to consider. At
this trial accused was being charged with murders and upon those
charges alone must the jury give their verdict. Indeed, they
must take especial care that their natural detestation of the
kind of man the accused would admit he was did not prejudice
them in his disfavour and, no matter how inconclusive the
evidence against him, incline them to find him guilty.</p>

<p>He looked pityingly here at Archer Wain and went on that
certainly the evidence adduced by his learned friend was most
inconclusive and in not one single one of the four charges did
it justify him in declaiming so boastfully that his case was
proved.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in the first three charges against
the accused he had been carrying on his activities with another
bad man, and if it could be shown that it was more than just
probable this criminal associate of his had been the likely
murderer then the accused must be given the benefit of the
doubt. It was the great principle of British justice that when
any doubt existed, however slight, the verdict must be one of
not guilty.</p>

<p>He would bring evidence to show that Joseph Douro, the
accomplice of the accused, was a man of vicious and violent
character and known as such to the police of Buenos Aires. Then
he would put the accused into the witness-box and he would
testify that, while participating in the burglary at Bentham
Hall and an accessory after the fact to the murder of Professor
Mildmay, yet in both instances it had been Douro who had been
the killer. He had killed the butler at Bentham Hall
deliberately, but the killing of the professor had been in quite
a different category, as they had come upon the latter only by
chance and he had met his death when attempting to draw his
automatic upon them.</p>

<p>The pistol found in the accused's flat had been that same
automatic and the knuckle-duster had belonged to Douro.</p>

<p>Coming to the death of Braddock, neither the accused nor
Douro had had anything to do with it and they had been amazed to
find the body of their accomplice in the grave in the vaults,
but had realised on the instant that both the killing and the
burial of the body there had been the professor's work.</p>

<p>The K.C. then proceeded to relate in detail the attempt to
get into the Gap House that night and all that had followed
after. He added that none of the three confederates had ever
carried firearms when engaged upon their nefarious work, being
quite aware that a burglar caught with a pistol in his
possession would get twenty years' penal servitude, whereas,
without one, his sentence would not be half that period of
time.</p>

<p>He stressed strongly that the pistol with which it had been
proved Braddock had been shot, on the face of it, was not likely
to have belonged to the accused, for, apart from the experts
testifying it had been fired only a few times, as they all had
seen when it had been produced in court, it was a new weapon. It
was a recent purchase and, certainly, had not been carried about
upon anyone's person for any length of time.</p>

<p>Coming to the poisoning of Agatha Wandsworth, here the jury
must take a commonsense view of all the circumstances of the
case. Certainly the accused had threatened the girl, but a
threat did not necessarily mean that it had been put into
execution, and was it likely, they must ask themselves, that he
would have been carrying morphia about with him? It had been
proved he was not a drug addict, it had been shown that the
announcement of the girl's-engagement was as great a surprise to
him as to everybody else, and so was it feasible to believe he
had gone to that dinner-party all prepared for an eventuality
which he had not the remotest idea was going to occur?</p>

<p>Apart from that, the accused was a shrewd, calculating man,
and was it likely either that he would allow himself, so to
speak, to be caught like a rat in a trap? He had so much in his
life to hide, and quite a lot in connection with this girl. Then
would he for one moment have allowed himself to be held up among
a batch of suspects and where exhaustive enquiries would have to
be made about everyone? He would have known the dead girl's
history would be gone into, his faked relationship to her
exposed and the part she had been playing at the Old Regency
night-club brought to the light of day.</p>

<p>Then, if it was his intention to destroy the girl, could any
reasonable person credit he would have chosen to do so in such a
glare of publicity and at such an inopportune moment? No, a
thousand times no! He was a scoundrel, a man deep in crime, but
no one could say&mdash;he was a fool.</p>

<p>The massive K.C. plumped heavily into his seat and wiped the
perspiration from his face. It was generally conceded he had
made a magnificent speech and no one in the crowded court now
looked upon Ramon's acquittal on all four charges as a forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>Ramon made a good witness. There was no doubt about that,
and, notwithstanding his dreadful admissions, something of the
pity most people feel for the hunted animal became apparent in
the glances which were cast on him. In spite of themselves, they
were soon dwelling, too, on his good points. He was a man of
courage, and, standing before them a self-admitted moral
outcast, asked for no pity and did not whine.</p>

<p>His replies did not detract from the points raised in his
favour by his counsel. He answered quickly and with no
hesitation. In his gruelling cross-examination by Archer Wain he
was never for one moment at a loss when any explanation was
needed and did not attempt to parry when, time after time, the
dreadful nature of his character was brought out.</p>

<p>"You say," said Wain, "that you had an angry quarrel with
Joseph Douro because of his violence to the butler at Bentham
Hall. Then was it because you were sorry the poor man had been
given such dreadful injuries?"</p>

<p>Ramon shook his head. "No," he replied curtly.</p>

<p>"Then why were you angry?"</p>

<p>"It was unnecessary," was the quiet reply. "The first blow
had stunned him and been quite sufficient."</p>

<p>"But as a one-time guest at the Hall, if the butler had been
only stunned, when he came to he might have told how he had
recognised you?"</p>

<p>Ramon shook his head again. "He couldn't have done so. I was
masked."</p>

<p>"But he might have recognised your voice!"</p>

<p>"I hadn't spoken."</p>

<p>Wain went on. "But if you had so objected to his violence,
why did you go on working with him?"</p>

<p>"He was useful to me. That was all."</p>

<p>"Did you protest next time when he struck at Professor
Mildmay with that axe?"</p>

<p>"No, that was necessary. The professor was about to attack
us."</p>

<p>"Then you quite approved of that being done and would have
struck him yourself? Oh, you would have, would you! Then it was
just chance that Douro struck him first and not you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just chance, in the same way that it was just chance we
had come upon the professor at all that afternoon. The encounter
had not been sought and was quite unexpected."</p>

<p>"Now about Braddock. You say you had had no quarrel with him.
Then did you like him? No! Why not?"</p>

<p>"He was coarse, with no manners."</p>

<p>Asked what his threat to Agatha could have meant if it had
not been one to murder her, Ramon replied that the letter had
been written at a moment of great irritation because she had
absented herself from her duties at the club, without
permission. He had been intending only to frighten her that he
would disclose the part she had been playing at the Old Regency,
that of a decoy to induce members to play heavily at the gaming
tables.</p>

<p>"But when you knew," said Wain, "that she was going down to
Wardale Court as young Wardale's special guest to that
coming-of-age dance-party, because of his driving her down there
himself in his own car you must have suspected they were lovers
and going to become engaged."</p>

<p>"I didn't," replied Ramon. "I never gave it a thought."</p>

<p>"But for what purpose then did you imagine she was so eager
to go to Esher?"</p>

<p>"She wasn't eager," snapped Ramon. "She told me she didn't
want to go and I thought she had only consented in order to help
me."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>Ramon was quite frank. "To change the spurious goblets I was
taking down with me, and which were found in my suitcase, for
the real ones in the cabinet in the drawing-room. The real ones
are very valuable, and I thought she might get a better chance
to change them than I. It had all been arranged between us."</p>

<p>With the cross-examination at last over, the knowing ones in
the court whispered to one another that, if he had not improved
his chances of acquittal, the accused had, at all events, not
lost any ground.</p>

<p>Archer Wain, in his final address to the jury, went over much
the same ground he had traversed in his opening remarks, not
that it was necessary, he insisted, except to impress upon them
that none of the issues he had raised had been countered
successfully.</p>

<p>"All along the line of his criminal career," he declaimed
fiercely, "the accused has shown himself to be a man of
ingenuity and resource, and now in the line he has taken for his
defence we have seen he has not lost any of his cunning. He has
brazenly stripped bare to us so much of his wickedness in the
hope that his apparent frankness will have led us to believe he
has told us all. Surely, however, we are not to be taken in by a
trick such as that?"</p>

<p>Wain raised one hand warningly. "This man is much more than a
thief and a panderer to the dreadful vices of the drug addict.
He is a killer. He is a man of death, and we have seen that
wherever he has gone death has followed, first to Robert Hansom,
next to Professor Mildmay, then to Braddock and, finally, to the
woman Agatha Wandsworth. When these ghastly murders have been
committed he has been on the spot every time, and surely it is
straining our credulity to impossible lengths to imagine that
every time he has been there only as a spectator."</p>

<p>In conclusion, he said, he was sure the common sense of the
jury would see to it that punishment was meted out to one of the
most callous murderers of recent times.</p>

<p>In his closing speech for the defence the massive Bollington
boomed that, as with his learned brother for the Crown, he had
little to add to what he had just put forward in his opening
address, as nothing that had taken place in the court since had
detracted one iota from the strength of what he had said.</p>

<p>He could not too strongly impress upon the jury again that,
in accordance with the age-old traditions of British justice, an
accused was at all times to be held as not guilty until it had
been proved to the contrary. And in all four charges brought
against him he had not been proved so.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, suspicion there was in plenty, but actual proofs
there were none. There was no direct evidence that he had killed
a single one of these four persons, and when the Crown had
resorted to evidence which was not direct and only
circumstantial, its weakness must have been apparent to
everyone. The accused had turned himself inside out in the
witness-box, but, beyond what he had admitted freely and with
frankness, the prosecution had certainly not gained anything in
any way.</p>

<p>In conclusion, in due time the accused would, of course,
receive adequate punishment for the several crimes which could
undoubtedly be brought home to him, but no contemplation by the
jury upon the wickedness of these other crimes must permit of
them finding him guilty of deeds he had not done.</p>

<p>The large audience in the court, hanging breathlessly upon
his every word, were in a way of being disappointed with the
summing-up of Lord Hume. His lordship seemed tired and to lack
much of his usual vivacity. To many, too, he appeared over-cautious
in his mentioning so many times that in any uncertainty
the accused must be given the benefit of the doubt. Indeed, the
old habitues of the court nodded to one another that on the
first two charges he was obviously directing the jury to bring
in a verdict of acquittal.</p>

<p>Coming to the death of Braddock, he warned the jury that if
the story told by the accused as to the way the man had died
were not true, then they must not expect the motive for his
being shot to be easily found by them. It must be remembered
that all these three men had been passing much of their lives in
criminal and unlawful ways and that, therefore, their quarrels
and disagreements were likely to be adjusted and fought out in
manners very difficult for ordinary people to understand. That
there had been some unusual friction between the dead man and
the accused was undoubtedly a fact, for, otherwise, upon his
disappearance his mother would not have been so immediately
suspicious that harm had come to her son at the hands of the
accused. They must bear that in mind when considering whether
the accused had murdered him or not.</p>

<p>His lordship dwelt at more length with the death of Agatha
Wandsworth. Counsel for the defence, he said, had stressed
strongly that between the public announcement of the engagement
and the poisoning of the milk there had been less than three
hours, and he had argued that it was hardly feasible in that
short space of time the accused would have come to his dreadful
decision to destroy the girl. It must be borne in mind, however,
that if the girl's death did lie at the door of the accused,
then it had been a crime of passion, and more often than not
such crimes overwhelmed the sanity of their perpetrators with
the violence and velocity of an avalanche. They were then
carried out without caution and with an entire disregard of all
consequences.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the accused had arrived at the Court
that night all prepared with the deadly morphia if he found the
girl had defied him&mdash;how did he think he was going to carry
out his dreadful deed? He could have known little of the girl's
private habits, as it had not been traced he had slept one night
under the same roof with her, and he had visited her only once
at her apartment, and then only for a few minutes when they had
quarrelled.</p>

<p>So, if he was intending to poison her, how did he expect to
get the opportunity of doing so? How did he know she was going
to ask for a glass of milk to be placed in her room by the
bedside? It was by mere chance, too, she had asked the maid for
it when others were within hearing.</p>

<p>The jury must most carefully weigh up all these things when
making up their minds, and once again he must warn them that if
they had doubts, any doubts at all, then the accused must
benefit by them and their verdict be one of not guilty.</p>

<p>The jury were absent for five hours and, returning, the
foreman announced they had found the accused not guilty of
murdering Robert Hansom and Professor Mildmay, but guilty of the
murders of Eden Braddock and Agatha Wandsworth.</p>

<p>A gasp went round the court and Ramon was seen to be deathly
pale. Asked by his lordship if he had anything to say before
sentence was passed upon him, he replied with ashen lips, but
quite coolly, "Yes, my lord. The jury are all fools, and I
respectfully submit that they and their descendants be exempted
from serving on all juries for a period of at least one thousand
years."</p>

<p>The judge put on the black cap and sentenced Ramon to be
taken from that place and be hanged by the neck until he was
dead.</p>

<p>Two months later, to the day, sentence was carried out and
Ramon Ellister ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Some six months after Ramon had been hanged, one sunny Sunday
morning, Larose and Inspector Stone happened to meet by chance
upon the promenade at Eastbourne and they sat down to have a
talk.</p>

<p>"I saw in the newspapers the other day," remarked Stone,
"that Mrs. Wardale was dead. Poor woman, it must have been a
dreadful trouble to her, all that scandal at the Court!"</p>

<p>"It was," nodded Larose, "but she died happy, for that boy of
hers had married his cousin Beryl, and that was what she had
been wanting so badly."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't see any announcement of the wedding!" exclaimed
Stone.</p>

<p>"No, it was a very quiet affair and no fuss was made. Peter
had soon got over his grieving for that Wandsworth girl and, I
think, realised what an escape he had had. He was a bit ashamed
of himself, too, for having been such an easy dupe."</p>

<p>"Funny affair altogether that Ellister business," said Stone,
"and, looking back, one can see what a close shave it was that
he got his deserts."</p>

<p>"The jury were fools," said Larose angrily, "the fools that
he said they were, for of course it was he who had murdered both
the butler at Bentham Hall and the professor. There wasn't the
slightest doubt about it."</p>

<p>"Of course there wasn't," agreed Stone, "and I'm sure the
jury themselves more than half-believed that, too. But the old
judge had put them off it. He had been too much of a stickler
for giving Ellister the benefit of the doubt, and they didn't
like to ignore his summing up." He laughed. "However, they
weren't quite such fools as you make out, Gilbert, for they were
determined he should hang for something, and so nailed him hard
and fast on the other charges."</p>

<p>"Where it might have been thought," nodded Larose, "he had
stood a better chance of getting off."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Stone. He seemed to be hesitating whether or
not to say something and then rapped out, "See here, Gilbert,
knowing the sort of man you are, I'll tell you something now."
He spoke very slowly. "For the first and last time in my life,
old son, I took a leaf out of your book and saw to it that the
wretch got Justice if not Law."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" exclaimed Larose. "What do you mean, Charlie?"</p>

<p>Stone looked him straight in the eyes. "I know I'm safe with
you, Gilbert, and it'll ease my mind a bit to tell you." He
lowered his voice darkly. "I suppressed evidence which would
have favoured Ellister"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"and one of the
two murders he was hanged for he hadn't done. He never killed
Braddock."</p>

<p>Larose opened his eyes very wide. "Oh, you knew that, did
you!" he exclaimed, very startled. He nodded. "I knew that,
too." He looked very puzzled. "But how did you find it out?"</p>

<p>"It happened in this way," said Stone. "Three days before the
trial a man came to see me in great secrecy. He wouldn't give
his name to the constable on duty, and he wouldn't say what his
business was until he was alone with me. Then he told me he was
a gunsmith in Fakenham in Norfolk, not very far from you or
where the professor lived, and that not a fortnight before the
professor had disappeared"&mdash;the inspector paused
dramatically&mdash;"he had sold him that Weimer pistol which had
been produced in court, the one with which Braddock had been
shot!"</p>

<p>"But hadn't anyone been to question him?" asked the
astonished Larose, to whom, all along, it had been a puzzle why
those entrusted with Ramon's defence had not found it out. "I
thought all the gun-sellers in Norfolk had been combed."</p>

<p>"So they had," nodded Stone, "but this man had lied because
he had sold it to the professor when the professor had not got a
licence. He knew he had been doing wrong and was afraid of the
consequences. So he denied knowing anything about it."</p>

<p>"But how did he come to tell you?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"His conscience troubled him and he came to me to make a
clean breast of it and ask what he should do."</p>

<p>"And you persuaded him to keep quiet?" asked Larose
incredulously.</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "No, Gilbert, I wasn't as bad as that,
and, greatly to my real grief, I told him to go at once to the
solicitors who were acting for Ellister." He spoke very
solemnly. "But he never got to them. He was prevented by an act
of God. He was run over by a big lorry and killed instantly, not
two minutes after leaving my room. I saw it all from my window
as I was standing there in very worried thought."</p>

<p>"Did you know he was absolutely dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I ran down immediately. His whole chest was crushed in
and he died instantaneously. So, I knew his secret was safe
unless I told it." The inspector nodded. "So Ellister was
speaking the truth when he said it had not been he, but the
professor, who had shot Braddock."</p>

<p>"But it wasn't the professor who had put his body in that
vault," said Larose quickly, "and I swear to you I knew nothing
about it being there until you told me."</p>

<p>"I quite believe you," said Stone. "I know you'd never tell
me a downright lie, and, besides, when you heard about it from
me you looked altogether too astonished and angry to be
deceiving me."</p>

<p>"And I was angry," said Larose. "I was furious."</p>

<p>"With that long-legged devil of a commodore," grinned Stone.
"Of course he had taken the body from where the professor had
got it hidden and, when his poor cousin was dead and missing,
had put it in that vault as a ghastly surprise for those
blackguards when they came to open the grave."</p>

<p>"That's it," nodded Larose. "And when I taxed him with it I
couldn't be angry for long, for it was so funny. I had to laugh
with him."</p>

<p>"So they kept you a bit in the dark," said Stone, looking
curiously at Larose, "and didn't tell you everything?
They&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the situation was becoming awkward and Larose did not
want to be further questioned on that point. So he interrupted
quickly. "Yes, the commodore is always like a schoolboy with his
monkey-tricks." He lowered his voice as the inspector had done.
"But now, Charlie, as you've told me one secret I'll tell you
another, and mine"&mdash;he made a grimace&mdash;"is even worse
than yours."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Stone banteringly. "You're not going to
tell me you bribed the jury?"</p>

<p>"Almost as bad," said Larose. He spoke very solemnly. "I let
that blackguard hang for another murder he didn't do." He shook
his head. "He didn't poison Agatha Wandsworth."</p>

<p>Stone looked incredulous. "Oh, he didn't, didn't he? Then who
did?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wardale," snapped Larose, "with more than twenty
half-grain morphia tablets she'd had in the house ever since her
husband died."</p>

<p>"She told you?" glared the inspector.</p>

<p>"After I'd taxed her with it," said Larose. "I suspected her
from the very first when the commodore took me in to see her and
I said I'd be sure to find out who was the poisoner and so clear
Beryl Wardale of the suspicion. She was terribly frightened of
me from that moment."</p>

<p>"And she told you definitely that she had put that poison in
the milk?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, definitely. She had done it on the impulse of the
moment to save her son. He had just whispered to her they were
going to be married by special licence on the Monday&mdash;and
she had only that afternoon learnt exactly who and what sort of
a girl the supposed Diana Montgomery was."</p>

<p>He went on quickly. "It's not a long story. As I say, I saw
she was terrified of me, not just nervous&mdash;but terrified,
and I searched for the reason. Was it she who had put that
poison in the milk? If so, it could only have been because she
wanted to kill the girl and prevent the marriage, and that meant
she had suddenly learnt all about her."</p>

<p>"Why suddenly?" asked Stone with a frown.</p>

<p>"Because Beryl had told me that on the previous day, Peter's
birthday, she had been so bright and well at lunch just after
her son had brought the girl to the Court and then, within a few
hours, had been looking so haggard and ill that everyone had
been remarking on it. So I asked myself who could have been
talking to her about Agatha and made all the mischief. I found
out she had had a strange visitor during the afternoon and I
thought at once of the Benson woman. You remember&mdash;she was
the niece of that old Miss Brown in Balham who, it had come out
at the inquest, had died because of the girl's neglect."</p>

<p>"I remember," nodded Stone. "You told me she had seen the
girl with young Wardale and was rather spiteful about it."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly spiteful," said Larose, "but she had
mentioned something about wondering if it were her duty to open
the boy's eyes, and I had advised her to leave things alone. But
she hadn't left things alone. She had gone down to Esher, armed
with a photo of Agatha at the orphanage, the very afternoon of
Peter's birthday, as I have told you, and told the mother
everything."</p>

<p>Larose went on. "Then another idea came into my mind. Beryl
had told me that ten years ago Mrs. Wardale's husband had died
after a long and very painful illness and I guessed that of
course he would have been having plenty of morphia, with,
probably, as he would have been getting it pretty often, one or
other of the nurses giving it him. So, I made a long shot that,
when the patient had at last died, some of the drug had been
inadvertently left behind." He sighed. "I went back to Esher and
asked Mrs. Wardale point blank. She confessed at once,
apparently very relieved to make a clean breast of it to
someone."</p>

<p>"And you advised her not to tell the police?" frowned
Stone.</p>

<p>"Advised her!" exclaimed Larose grimly. "Why, I had to
persuade her, plead with her not to tell them. I had a terrible
job to prevent her ringing up that Surbiton inspector at once,
and it wasn't until I drummed into her how terrible it would be
for her son that she agreed to remain silent."</p>

<p>"It was wrong of you," said Stone solemnly, "very, very,
wrong."</p>

<p>"I know it was," agreed Larose. He smiled. "But didn't after
events show it was very, very right? You and I are quite certain
that Ellister killed both that butler at Bentham Hall and the
professor. The crimes had both had the Ramon Ellister trademark
upon them. Also from Douro's letter we are pretty certain he
murdered him, too. Then what would have happened if the wretch
had been acquitted of all the four capital charges? What
punishment would he have got?"</p>

<p>"Ten years penal servitude for the burglary," grunted
Stone.</p>

<p>"Reduced to less than seven for good conduct," snapped
Larose, "and then, when a little more than forty years old, he
would have walked out into the world again a free man to enjoy
perhaps nearly another half of his life. Why, the idea was
unthinkable!"</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Stone. "And with old Hume upon the Bench,
as dry-as-dust an old stickler for 'benefits of the doubt' as
there ever was, I was terrified the devil might get off."</p>

<p>"So was I," exclaimed Larose. "And, knowing what we did. I
say we were both quite justified in tipping the scales a wee bit
against him."</p>

<p>"A wee bit!" frowned Stone. "Why, between us we plonked in a
damned heavy weight!" He heaved a huge sigh. "But there, don't
let's talk any more about it. It's done and let's forget it. It
depresses me and makes me feel low."</p>

<p>"A-ah, then it's only a bit of a tonic you need," said Larose
brightly, "and I know the best doctor to give you one." He
looked at his watch. "He'll be seeing his patients in about
three minutes now, and so we'll just trickle across to the Grand
and consult him." He laughed. "Good old Doctor Heidsieck, he
plays a good tune on jaded nerves! So we'll crack a small bottle
between us and feel different men."</p>

<p>"You young devil!" grinned Stone. He smacked his lips. "Still
at some moments of our lives there is no better music than the
popping of a cork. Lead on, son. I'll follow. No one can say old
Charlie Stone doesn't take good advice when it's offered."</p>
