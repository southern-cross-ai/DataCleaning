<p class="first">FIVE people were seated around a table in the
private office of a well-known solicitor in Lincoln's Inn. Their
expressions and general attitude were sufficiently disturbed to
suggest that their gathering was of no ordinary moment. A
grey-haired, untidy looking woman in seedy black was tapping the
mahogany table in front of her with long, ill-cared for nails,
and breathing quickly. A fat, red-cheeked man, with a waistcoat
the lower buttons of which failed to connect, with blue watery
eyes and a loose, but good-humoured, mouth, was whistling softly
to himself. A pleasant-faced, but shabbily dressed, young man
was leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets and
a palpably assumed air of indifference. Next to him a girl of
agreeable, almost striking appearance, with attractive,
light-brown hair, thoughtful eyes, the blunt finger-tips of a
professional typist and the rather wan complexion of the
underfed City toiler, was seated a little grimly in her chair,
with eyes which seldom moved from the door. She showed no signs
of nervousness, but there was an intense light in her eyes which
betrayed her condition of mind. Her rather jaunty beret seemed
an unsuitable headgear. Every now and then, notwithstanding her
efforts, her lips twitched a little under the strain. Next to
her was an older man, better dressed than his companions, with
deeply lined face and weary expression. He had somehow the air
of a man facing a crisis, but he had also the air of one
prepared to receive the good or the evil of life with
resignation. A tentative conversation had petered out. The
little company either watched the swaying of the boughs of the
lime trees outside the window or concentrated their attention
upon the door.</p>

<p>"I'm fed up with this," the stout man declared, mopping his
forehead with a handkerchief of dubious appearance. "Why don't
the bloke come?"</p>

<p>"We have only been here about ten minutes," the younger man
reminded him.</p>

<p>"It seems an hour," the woman with the grey, untidy hair
moaned. "It seems a whole day&mdash;it seems a lifetime!"</p>

<p>"And all over a matter, I dare say, of a paltry fifty quid,"
the man with the weary expression muttered.</p>

<p>"Fifty quid would do me a bit of good," his neighbour
sighed.</p>

<p>Then their suspense was suddenly ended. The heavy mahogany
door was pushed inwards. A tall, exceedingly good-looking
elderly gentleman, followed by an obvious clerk, entered the
room. The former bowed stiffly to the little company, who
greeted him almost in silence. He made his way towards a vacant
chair and took a sheet of paper from his secretary's hand.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce myself," he began curtly. "I am Sir George
Eastman, head of the firm of Eastman and Pelligrew. You, I
gather, are the legatees under the will of my late client, Mr.
Desmond Rooke?"</p>

<p>"That sounds all right so far, Sir George," the stout man
said, once more mopping his forehead. "What we are anxious to
know is&mdash;what are we legatees of&mdash;Scarcely ever heard
of the old boy myself."</p>

<p>"We shall come to that," Sir George announced. "I have here a
list of your names. The first upon the list is Miss Ann
Rooke."</p>

<p>The girl leaned forward.</p>

<p>"That is my name, sir," she said in a low but quite pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>Sir George consulted his paper once more.</p>

<p>"You are twenty-two years old, an orphan, employed as typist
by a firm of provision merchants in Thames Street?"</p>

<p>"That is correct, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I have here Mrs. John Rooke, widow of John Rooke,
builder, of Tottenham, aged fifty-two."</p>

<p>The woman with the long fingernails paused in her nervous
movements.</p>

<p>"My name," she admitted huskily. "John Rooke was my
husband."</p>

<p>The solicitor passed on.</p>

<p>"The next name on my list," he continued, "is Phillip Rooke,
aged forty-eight, of no occupation."</p>

<p>The stout man nodded gloomily:</p>

<p>"I've been everything from an auctioneer to a scene-shifter,"
he confided. "Nothing doing at present. I'm touching the dole,"
he added, with a semi-defiant glance around. "Got as much right
to it as anyone, after all. Paid my taxes when I was better
off."</p>

<p>"The next," Sir George went on, studying the list through his
horn-rimmed eyeglass, "is Mr. Colin Rooke, aged twenty-five,
journalist."</p>

<p>The young man held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Rather a vagabond sort of journalist, I'm afraid, sir," he
said, with a faint smile, "but I scrape along somehow."</p>

<p>"The last name on my list," the lawyer concluded, "is Mr.
Percy Rooke, insurance agent."</p>

<p>"That is my name, sir," the better-dressed man assented, a
little wearily.</p>

<p>Sir George Eastman leaned back in his chair, laid the paper
before him and pressed his finger-tips together. He was so much
the typical family solicitor that he might have stepped out of a
film.</p>

<p>"After the most exhaustive enquiries," he said, "I have been
able to satisfy myself and, what is more important, the Court,
that you five are the only possible relatives of the late
Desmond Rooke bearing his name. That, I may add, was one of the
stipulations of his will."</p>

<p>"There is a will, then" the fat man asked eagerly. "There is
a will," Sir George admitted.</p>

<p>"Sounds hopeful, anyway."</p>

<p>"I should perhaps explain," the lawyer continued, "that Mr.
Desmond Rooke was by no means an old client of the firm. He came
to me some six months ago and asked me to draw up a will for
him. I explained that it was not the custom of this firm to
accept clients without a recommendation. He said that he had no
friends, and in any case he preferred a lawyer who was a
stranger. He handed me his card, from which it appeared that he
was associated with an undertaking conducted under the somewhat
curious title of 'Investments Limited,' having offices in Crane
Court, Moorgate Street. I asked him to call again in a few days'
time, but he insisted upon transacting the business at once. My
office, therefore, rang up his bankers, who within a few minutes
were able to reassure me as to the respectability of the company
in question. I thereupon accepted the task of drawing up the
will, accepted the deposit of a certain box which has remained
in the vaults of the firm, and the executorship of the estate,
and am in a position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake," the nervous old woman broke in, "tell us
where we are! Is there anything for us?"</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at the woman in mild surprise.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he remonstrated, "you will forgive me. These
details have to be faced and I have had to satisfy myself before
I could call you together that you five were the people you
purported to be and that there was no other person who had a
right to the name of Rooke. The money left by my client
consisted wholly of War Loan stock. On his instructions this has
been disposed of, the death duties have been paid, the fees of
my firm have been deducted and the balance is here in my clerk's
hands for your acceptance."</p>

<p>The girl could keep still no longer. She leaned shivering
across the table.</p>

<p>"How much is it?" she gasped. "How much, please?"</p>

<p>Again there was an irritating pause while the eyeglass was
fitted into its place. Sir George glanced at the paper which his
secretary passed to him.</p>

<p>"The amounts of the drafts which my clerk will now hand you,
and for which he will collect the receipts," he announced, "are
sixty-four thousand seven hundred pounds. Five bank vouchers for
that amount are here. I congratulate you all," the lawyer
concluded, rising to his feet, "upon what must be, I am sure, a
pleasant windfall."</p>

<p>They were all on their feet except the grey-haired woman, who
twice strove to stand up and failed. The clerk, who was watching
her narrowly, poured out and passed her a glass of water, which
she drank feverishly. Sir George smiled tolerantly at them as,
with the drafts in their hands, they stood almost speechless.
The girl was sobbing quietly. The young man seemed dazed. The
perspiration was pouring down the forehead of the stout
gentleman and his mouth was wide open. Sir George, with slightly
relaxed expression, bade them all farewell.</p>

<p>"My clerk," he said, "will answer any further questions. You
will excuse me if I hurry off."</p>

<p>The girl leaned towards him.</p>

<p>"There is one question I want to ask, sir. Where and how did
Mr. Rooke die?"</p>

<p>"Yes, where was it?" the young man added.</p>

<p>The lawyer hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rooke," he confided, "died under somewhat unfortunate
circumstances on one of the smaller Channel Islands. He was
living there in concealment."</p>

<p>"My God!" the young man exclaimed. "The Sark murder
case!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE motley little gathering of
five&mdash;dazed, excited, still scarcely able to realise this
thing which had arrived&mdash;paused on the broad pavement
outside the impressive-looking offices which they had just left
and exchanged friendly glances. The woman with the untidy grey
hair, Mrs. John Rooke, held on to one of the iron palings.
Phillip Rooke, the stout gentleman who was in trouble with his
waistcoat, addressed the others.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "we're all relatives of a sort. We came
together by chance. It don't seem right to separate without a
word. I don't know about the rest of you, but I went up those
stairs a broken man. I've come down feeling I want to cry or
laugh or dance or something. I haven't got a wife to go home to,
but I want to drink a glass of wine with someone. What about
it?"</p>

<p>The girl and the young man beamed acquiescence. Mrs. John
Rooke smoothed her hair. The insurance agent grunted.</p>

<p>"What I'm coming to is this," the stout man went on. "I have
a draft for sixty-four thousand seven hundred pounds in my
pocket and four bob and a few pence, but what I've got, too, is
a pal in that bank over there&mdash;branch of Barclays. I would
propose that we go over there, I show this draft, and if I can
open an account I'll draw out fifty quid or so, and I know a
little restaurant round the corner where we can just sit down
and drink a bottle of the best and get acquainted, and if anyone
says a spot of lunch afterwards, I'm not against it. What about
it, my fellow relatives?"</p>

<p>"I call that the right spirit," the young man declared. "What
do you say, Miss Ann?"</p>

<p>"I'd love it," she declared. "Do let's go. We should feel so
much more confidence."</p>

<p>They trooped across the street. The stout man, who had
buttoned up his waistcoat and acquired a swagger, led the way.
They marched into the bank, which happened to be almost
deserted, and notwithstanding a few curious glances from the
clerks, walked up to the counter. The cashier looked up, nodded
and welcomed his friend.</p>

<p>"Mr. Broadbent," the latter introduced with a little wave of
the hand, "friends of mine here as a matter of fact, relatives.
Nye have all come into a bit of money. Know the lawyer chap
across the way&mdash;Sir George Eastman?"</p>

<p>"Know him!" the cashier replied with a smile. "One of our
most valued clients."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke produced his draft.</p>

<p>"See what I've got here, Mr. Broadbent," he said. "You being
my landlord and knowing me well, you might tell me&mdash;is this
bit of paper all right?"</p>

<p>The cashier glanced at the draft, turned it over, read it
through carefully and smiled.</p>

<p>"This strip of paper, as you call it, Mr. Rooke," he said,
"is worth sixty-four thousand seven hundred of the very best. No
getting away from it. It is as good as Bank of England
notes."</p>

<p>"Then what I should like," the stout man observed, "is to
open an account with you, deposit that draft and have you hand
me across fifty quid. You know that's my name&mdash;Phillip
Rooke&mdash;you know the Sir George Eastman whose name is at the
bottom of it, and it's drawn on your own bank."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rooke," the bank official declared, "we shall be
delighted to have you for a client. If you will sign your name
at the back, the business will be accomplished."</p>

<p>There was a little ripple of relief amongst the four people
behind. Their guide turned and smiled at them triumphantly.</p>

<p>"There you are, my relatives," he said. "It's a cinch, you
see. We're all right. The money is real. You see, sir," he went
on, signing his name laboriously and pushing across the draft,
"this came like a bolt from the blue to us five surviving
relatives of an old cove that's just pegged out."</p>

<p>"Very lucky people, all of you," the cashier said with a
smile, as he began to count some notes. "How much did you say,
Mr. Rooke?"</p>

<p>"Make it a hundred quid if it's all the same to you," the
latter replied.</p>

<p>"I'll make you out a cheque to sign in a moment," the other
promised. "You can either conclude the business now or come in
later."</p>

<p>"I'll come in again later," was the prompt response. "We have
something to do first with a bit of this hundred quid. Can you
guess what it's going to be, Mr. Broadbent?"</p>

<p>The cashier for a moment was positively human. He smiled at
his friend and tenant and he smiled at the other four.</p>

<p>"Knowing you, Phillip," he said, "I can guess!..."</p>

<p>Out into the sunlit streets again they trooped. Somehow or
other they felt a little more alive. The thing seemed real.</p>

<p>"You hadn't any money there before, had you, Mr. Rooke?" the
lady with the untidy grey hair asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bob," her relative assured her. "I've not had an
account there for four years and then it was only a pettifogging
one."</p>

<p>"Handed out the money without a word, didn't he?" the elderly
lady asked, looking around.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," the young man remonstrated with a
smile, "but I don't see why you should entertain us, Mr. Rooke.
I've got a pound in my pocket. Couldn't we make a little
pool?"</p>

<p>"No more of that, my lad," the other insisted. "The one thing
I'm short of is relatives. I have no one at home to hurry back
to&mdash;and God, how I want a drink! This way."</p>

<p>He led them into a small, unassuming-looking restaurant,
passed the downstair room, and mounted to an apartment on the
first floor where about a dozen tables were set for luncheon. In
the corner was a small bar. Mr. Phillip Rooke grinned at the
barman. The barman grinned back again.</p>

<p>"How's time, Fred?"</p>

<p>The barman glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>"Two minutes to go," he said.</p>

<p>"Two bottles of champagne&mdash;the best you've got," his
patron ordered. "You can get 'em on the counter ready and open
'em as the clock strikes. We're all for the law this morning, me
and my friends, and we wouldn't break it for the world. The law
has done us all right, hasn't it?" he went on. "Come along to
that table in the corner. Just a couple of sandwiches each,
Fred. We'll see about lunch later on...."</p>

<p>It was a strange, staccato kind of feast, punctuated here and
there with hysterical laughter, wondering exclamations. The
melancholy insurance agent lost his dumbness. He was the first
to raise his glass and drink a solemn toast to their departed
relative. Then they all began to talk. In half an hour's time
they were busy exchanging addresses; then there was a good deal
of hand-shaking and they all prepared to separate.</p>

<p>"Keep the table," Mr. Phillip Rooke ordered the barman as he
paid the bill. "I'm going to collect an odd pal or two and be
back to lunch."</p>

<p>The girl, who seemed to have become prettier with every sip
of her wine and every moment's realisation of this new
happiness, kissed him lightly on each cheek as she took her
leave.</p>

<p>"You're such a dear human being," she exclaimed, "and I love
to think you are half an uncle. What a wonderful day!"</p>

<p>"The young lady's said it," Mrs. John Rooke agreed, wiping
her eyes. "It's a wonderful day."</p>

<p>"One, I think," the young man declared, with his eye fixed
upon the girl, "which we are not likely to forget in a
hurry."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THEY met again a month later. This time it was
the young man who welcomed them one by one, as they mounted the
stairs of a Strand restaurant and came to the round table where
he and Miss Ann Rooke were waiting. There was a great change in
their appearance. Mrs. John Rooke's hair was still a little
untidy, but a coiffeur had been at work upon it and she wore a
very smart black frock and a hat that was almost fashionable.
Mr. Phillip Rooke flamboyantly sported a tail-coat and white
tie. The insurance agent was attired in a dinner-jacket like his
host. Miss Ann looked charming in a sort of semi-evening dress
of black taffeta. They talked volubly for several moments whilst
every one of them took a cocktail. The young man indicated their
places at the table, ordered another round of cocktails and told
the waiter to serve dinner in ten minutes.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, leaning forward, "I thought it would be
nice to all meet again and see how we were getting on, but I had
also a purpose in asking you to come together. You remember the
end of our conversation at the lawyer's?"</p>

<p>"I have thought about it many times," the insurance man
admitted, looking up suddenly. "Our old benefactor being done
away with, you mean?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've had on my mind," the young man confessed.
"Now, I'll tell you something I didn't let on to at the time: we
were all sort of struck dumb that morning. I was in the Channel
Islands at the time that old man was found dead at the bottom of
the cliffs. I was reporting on a special trial in Guernsey. We
heard of this affair, and another friend and I sailed a small
boat over to the island. We were both journalists, both
inquisitive&mdash;although I never for one moment dreamed that I
was ever going to be personally interested. There is little
doubt, of course, as to whether it was a murder, accident or
suicide, but my pal and I came to a certain decision. We
believed that this old chap was murdered, and what I have asked
you all to come and talk over to-night is just this&mdash;I
think we ought to do something about it. The police have
practically dropped the case. When I think what we all owe to
the old gentleman I think it's up to us to look into it. I
propose that we make a little fund, it won't take much money,
but I thought you would all like to share, and if you like to
entrust the thing to me, I will work on the case and see if I
can make anything out of it. I think we owe it to the old
boy."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of assent. Mrs. John Rooke straightened
her hair under her hat and looked with anxious eyes at her young
host.</p>

<p>"Whatever happened," she said, "it wouldn't touch our
legacies?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," he assured her. "We've got our money all
right, we're secure for our lives, and I think it's only
reasonable we should show a little gratitude. I'm going to
suggest that you each contribute a hundred pounds to the fund
and I'll get to work. I rather think that Miss Ann is going to
help me &mdash;in fact, she has started on her share of the work
already&mdash;and if there's anything any of you others can do,
of course, you're welcome. I rather fancy, though, that we don't
need much outside help, except, of course, from the police."</p>

<p>"My hundred pounds is here when you want it," the stout man
declared.</p>

<p>"And mine."</p>

<p>"And mine," the other two chimed in.</p>

<p>The young man smiled his thanks and clapped his hands.</p>

<p>"Now," he directed the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, "business is over. We
will get on with the dinner."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE young lady typist who passed by the name of
Miss Ann Smith rose from her chair with a little sigh of
resignation, covered over her machine, picked up her notebook
and, crossing the floor of the somewhat barely furnished office,
knocked at the door and entered the sanctum of Mr. Herbert
Mountain, managing director of "Investments Limited." That
gentleman, who had been engaged in the task of signing a number
of blue-sheeted documents, finished the last, pushed them away
with a gesture of relief and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Miss Smith," he invited.</p>

<p>Miss Smith, recognising that the daily battle of wits had
commenced, obeyed at once and opened her book. Her employer eyed
her approvingly.</p>

<p>"Been here a month to-day, haven't you, Miss Smith?" he
enquired.</p>

<p>"I believe that is so," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you."</p>

<p>"Satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I find my salary rather small."</p>

<p>Mr. Mountain coughed and rustled the pile of papers by his
side. He was a man apparently of youthful middle age, with
sallow complexion, dark eyes of which he was very proud, a
toothbrush moustache, and expensively dressed. His nails were
highly manicured and his cuff-links were in affinity with his
shirt.</p>

<p>"We consider three pounds a very excellent remuneration," he
remarked. "The girls in the outer office get only two."</p>

<p>"They do nothing but circulars," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"It would be quite open to you, Miss Smith," he continued,
looking at her thoughtfully, "to qualify for a better position,
and naturally a&mdash;er&mdash;higher salary. Tell me how you
like the business."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"So far as I have been able to understand it," she replied,
"it seems to me quite interesting. You seem to deal in every
sort of effort at money making."</p>

<p>A momentary shade of enthusiasm was in his tone as he
replied.</p>

<p>"We deal in everything by which it is possible to make
money," he told her. "We are ready to pit our brains against
anyone's."</p>

<p>"Very clever," she commented.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are clever," he admitted. "I have never heard anyone
deny it. It is a pleasure for us to make money for others so
long as we can be sure that we are making it for ourselves. We
are not above small transactions either. Now you yourself, Miss
Smith, you must have a little money put by. Why don't you invest
it with us? You are probably getting four or five per cent for
it. As often as not we can get you ten."</p>

<p>"Very pleasant," she remarked. "I should be afraid of
losing."</p>

<p>"I should make myself personally responsible for seeing that
you didn't lose," Mr. Mountain assured her meaningly.</p>

<p>"I should not like to be under an obligation to anyone," Miss
Smith said.</p>

<p>"You need not be. We often have schemes which we deal with
ourselves&mdash;the directors&mdash;and where it is possible we
allow a friend to share. If in course of time you prove yourself
worthy of our confidence and you should happen, for example, to
become my private secretary, you could make a great deal of
money, too."</p>

<p>"And remain honest?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Honesty is only relative," he remarked.</p>

<p>"And virtuous?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mountain's eyes glistened. After
all&mdash;perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are degrees of virtue," he ventured with an
insinuating glance.</p>

<p>Miss Ann Smith scratched her rather dainty little nose with
the end of her pencil. She had the air of one confronted with a
problem. Mr. Mountain looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"If you will be my guest for lunch to-day," he invited, "I
will answer all the questions you care to ask me about the
business."</p>

<p>"I will be ready at one o'clock," she promised, rising to her
feet.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">MR. MOUNTAIN at any rate knew how to order
lunch. He had chosen a corner table in a small but quite select
restaurant. Miss Ann Smith, who had had occasion to be a little
firm during the drive from the City, spoke very plainly as she
finished her caviare.</p>

<p>"Business first, please," she begged. "How many directors are
there of 'Investments Limited'?"</p>

<p>He made a little grimace, but answered promptly.</p>

<p>"Five. There is myself, Sir Percy Hardross, Lord Quillingham,
Alderman Fraser, and for the fifth we have at present a
vacancy."</p>

<p>"What happened to number five?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He died."</p>

<p>"What was his name?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mountain hesitated for a moment, then he answered the
question.</p>

<p>"Mr. Desmond Rooke when he left here. He was talking of
changing his name when he retired."</p>

<p>"Was he an old man?" she asked.</p>

<p>"About sixty-five, I think."</p>

<p>Ann leaned back in her place for a moment. She was suddenly
aware that her companion was watching her closely. She changed
the conversation. She had already discovered all that was
necessary.</p>

<p>"Tell me how you make your money?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We have special sources of information in the matter of gold
shares and the Far East markets," he told her. "One of our
directors&mdash;Fraser&mdash;is on the Stock Exchange. We have
capital and we buy shares when they are low and sell them as
soon as we make a decent profit. We have principles in business
that have paid us. We cut our losses. We never hold on to a
falling market. We take our friends in with us when there is a
good thing going and we never hesitate to share our profits. Of
course, we are not philanthropists," he concluded. "If we do
come across a bad egg, to be frank, we dress it up and try to
sell it. We generally succeed.... How much money have you to
invest, Miss Ann Smith?"</p>

<p>"Well, I could raise ten thousand pounds," she said.</p>

<p>"Wonderful! And you are content to do typing?"</p>

<p>"I choose my posts," she reminded him. "I like to see a
little of life. I don't suppose I shall stay with you very long.
I shall go somewhere else."</p>

<p>"I hope you will never leave us," he said fervently. "We
shall try, Miss Ann Smith, to make your post attractive in every
way."</p>

<p>"Tell me some more about the business," she invited.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you a condition we have amongst our
directors which is very unusual," he explained, "but it makes a
sort of happy family of us. We have an agreement amongst
ourselves to bequeath half of the money we make in the business
to the capital fund of the firm."</p>

<p>"Never heard of such a thing," Miss Ann Smith declared.</p>

<p>"It's been done before," he assured her. "Three years ago
Sidney Vallans was a director. He was a bachelor with very few
friends. His will was proved at ninety thousand pounds and he
left the whole of it back to the other directors to be added to
the capital account. I am a single man. My own will is made and
I have left everything to the firm&mdash;so have Lord
Quillingham, Fraser and Hardross."</p>

<p>"Supposing I invested ten thousand pounds should you expect
me to leave that capital to the firm?" she asked. "Why, I
scarcely know any of you!"</p>

<p>"No," he told her. "We should expect you to leave half the
profits you made from that ten thousand back to us&mdash;that
is, if you joined the firm permanently."</p>

<p>"Did your last director who changed his name leave his money
to the firm?" she enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Mountain frowned.</p>

<p>"As it happens, that is rather an unfortunate question," he
confessed. "Mr. Rooke did what it is always possible for any
dishonest person to do. He deceived us. He made a will leaving
his money back to the company, and when he retired it appears
that he went to another lawyer and made another will leaving all
his money to unknown relatives. The first time," Mr. Mountain
concluded ingenuously, "that anyone has let the firm down in
such a fashion."</p>

<p>"Did he have a long illness?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No illness at all," her host replied. "He met with an
accident of some sort. He was living on an island and could not
get a doctor, and that was the end of him."</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"And very nearly the end of this delightful lunch, I am
afraid," she said, as she ate the last of the strawberries. "If
you don't give me some coffee, I shall go to sleep over the
work."</p>

<p>"Come and see my French water-colours," he invited, "and you
can have a sleep before you go back."</p>

<p>She looked at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I'll wait until I am a director of the firm," she said.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was about a week later, towards the end of a
strenuous afternoon, when Miss Ann Smith opened the door of her
employer's private office and made what was to turn out a fatal
announcement.</p>

<p>"Three gentlemen to see you, Mr. Mountain."</p>

<p>Mountain, who was seated behind his desk signing letters,
half rose to his feet with a frown.</p>

<p>"What name, Miss Smith?" he demanded. "I'm not seeing anyone
else this afternoon."</p>

<p>The three gentlemen, however, were already in the room and
one had closed the door behind him. There was Colin Rooke, very
sunburnt and attired in a well-cut blue serge suit, a
pleasant-faced burly man of undoubted nautical appearance by his
side, and in the background, a powerfully built man who had a very
official look about him, and at whom Mr. Mountain stared with
undisguised apprehension. It was he who took the lead.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Mountain, but I have to ask for a
minute or two of your time," he said. "I am Inspector Williams,
of the C.LD., Scotland Yard. This young gentleman is Mr. Colin
Rooke, a distant relative of a late partner in your firm, and
the other gentleman is Captain Bowles, the harbourmaster at
Guernsey."</p>

<p>Mountain was standing up now. His was a strange example of
momentarily inspired bravado. He had been a coward all his life,
yet he faced these three whose message he already knew without
blenching.</p>

<p>"If you have business with me," he said coldly, "get on with
it. We have had a busy day and I was just leaving. I was not
aware that my late partner had any relatives."</p>

<p>"Ours is quite a simple mission although a serious one," the
inspector announced. "Captain Bowles, is this the man for whom
you found a pilot on March the fifteenth last to take his yacht
over to one of the adjacent islands?"</p>

<p>"No manner of doubt about it," was the confident reply. "He
was wearing a yachting-cap and oilskins, as well he might have
on such a dirty night, but I should have known him anywhere.
That's him, sir."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm the man," Mr. Mountain acknowledged. "I
was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will pardon my interrupting you, sir," the inspector
broke in. "I should advise you to say nothing more at the
moment. I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Mr.
Desmond Rooke, your late partner."</p>

<p>"I never heard anything so ridiculous in my life," Mr.
Mountain exclaimed. "Why, we were the greatest friends! What
possible motive could I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mountain stopped short. He suddenly knew. The hand which had
stolen into his right-hand drawer became nerveless. He dropped
the revolver on to the floor and collapsed in his chair. He was
half carried into the police car which was waiting in the
street.</p>

<p>"It takes them like that sometimes," the inspector observed,
as he attached the handcuffs to his prisoner. "They put a brave
face on it for a minute or two and then they go phut."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was several hours later and in very
different surroundings before Miss Ann Smith found herself
completely recovered. She was seated opposite Colin Rooke, her
fellow legatee, at a corner table in a small restaurant near
Bury Street.</p>

<p>"After all," she reflected, "it is false sentiment to be
sorry for anyone just because they are frightened to death."</p>

<p>"He deserves to hang if ever a man did," her companion
declared.</p>

<p>"Tell me some more about it," she begged.</p>

<p>"Well, Mountain had all the luck up to a certain point," her
companion explained. "He arrived off Guernsey in a falling mist,
so that no one actually saw what sort of a craft he was on, and
he was able to get rid of the pilot he picked up, the moment
they reached their destination, by sending him back in Rooke's
own private launch. Rooke seems to have been alone in the
bungalow he was occupying until his house was finished, and his
body was found at the bottom of the cliffs with his skull
battered in."</p>

<p>"What about Mr. Mountain?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There was no trace of Mountain nor any trace of any boat.
That is where the detective work began. We found the yacht at
last in the harbour of a small fishing-village on the Portuguese
coast. There it was, absolutely derelict; no papers on board,
everything destroyed that could be destroyed. Mountain must have
found his way to Lisbon or Oporto and so home. As a matter of
fact, if you had not found that letter from Rooke refusing to
lend the firm the fifty thousand pounds they were in need of,
and the other letter from Quillingham to Mountain practically
ordering him to go over and see Rooke, I should never have known
where to make a start. What probably happened was that Rooke
refused to change his mind about the loan, and Mountain pushed
him over the cliffs, thinking that his money would revert to the
firm."</p>

<p>"Instead of which," she remarked, smiling, "it came to us!
All the same," she added a moment or two later, "if those two
men were alone on the island, I don't see how they can prove
that Mountain actually committed the murder."</p>

<p>"There isn't any direct proof," he agreed, "although a local
fisherman saw two men struggling on the edge of the cliff, but
you see&mdash;Mountain confessed."</p>

<p class="first">MR. PHILLIP ROOKE, recently established as an
auctioneer and valuer, halfway through one of his weekly sales
of miscellaneous objects, paused to nod a welcome to a youthful
connection who had slipped into a vacant seat below the rostrum.
He did not allow his momentary exhibition of avuncular
cordiality, however, to interfere with the business on hand.</p>

<p>"Lot eighty-nine," he announced, consulting the catalogue
which he held in his hand, "is described here simply as 'a box.'
It was discovered at the last moment amongst the deceased's
effects and is to be sold&mdash;er&mdash;in its present
condition."</p>

<p>"Without a key?" one of the little company remarked, holding
up the box to examine it.</p>

<p>The auctioneer smiled acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Not only without a key, sir," he replied, leaning forward,
"but without a keyhole or visible hinges, or any means of
definitely deciding that it is a box. Our cataloguer, however,
has so described it. Kind of bronze or some inferior metal. No
time to be wasted about it. Will any gentleman bid me ten
shillings?"</p>

<p>"I will," the man who had remarked upon the absence of a key
decided.</p>

<p>Colin Rooke, the journalist nephew of the auctioneer, turned
his head curiously towards his neighbour. The man was obviously
a foreigner, good-looking in a flamboyant sort of way, with
strange eyes and a full, sensual mouth. There was nothing in his
features to denote supreme intelligence, but he had not in the
least the appearance of a man likely to give the sum of ten
shillings for a worthless article.</p>

<p>"If there's no other bid&mdash;" the auctioneer began.</p>

<p>"Fifteen shillings," Colin interrupted.</p>

<p>The preliminaries were over. The battle commenced. At two
pounds fifteen there was a pause. The first bidder, somewhat to
the surprise of the little company, seemed to have worked
himself up into a state of suppressed excitement. There were
drops of sweat upon his sallow forehead and he was handling with
slim, nervous fingers a small pile of notes he had dragged from
his pocket. He leaned over and touched his opponent upon the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why do you want that box?" he asked huskily. "It is not
worth so much money."</p>

<p>"If it's worth it to you, it's worth it to me," was the
brusque retort. "Here, Stephen, pass it over."</p>

<p>The man with the green baize apron tied around him handed the
article to Colin. The latter turned it over curiously. There was
nothing to be gathered from its exterior, but upon shaking it
there was some sense of muffled movement.</p>

<p>"It certainly doesn't seem worth the money," he remarked as
he replaced the box upon the table.</p>

<p>The foreigner, who kept one hand in his pocket, took it into
the long evil-looking fingers of his other hand, fingers which
might have strangled a man or have caressed the bow of a violin.
Something in his expression as he glanced furtively round warned
the man in the green baize apron, who made an apparently casual
but purposeful movement. He stood between the foreigner and the
door.</p>

<p>"It is my belief that the box belonged to a friend of mine,"
the latter muttered.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Colin replied. "My last bid was two pounds
fifteen."</p>

<p>His opponent looked at the money in his hand doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Any advance upon two pounds fifteen?" the auctioneer asked,
lifting his hammer. "For the first, second and third&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Five pounds," the stranger interrupted.</p>

<p>Colin was momentarily staggered. The auctioneer leaned
forward to the prospective purchaser.</p>

<p>"Five pounds seems a generous bid, sir," he said, "but you
understand that the cash must be paid before the box is taken
away."</p>

<p>The expression upon the face of the man who wanted the box
was dark and evil. Nevertheless, he struggled to retain the
semblance of politeness. There was, indeed, in his voice a note
almost of passionate appeal.</p>

<p>"Half an hour," he begged hoarsely. "Knock it down to me and
I will fetch you the money."</p>

<p>The auctioneer shook his head. "Our rules," he decided, "must
be kept. The last bid I have received is two pounds fifteen.
Going&mdash;going&mdash;gone!"</p>

<p>The auctioneer struck the desk in front of him. The man in
the apron handed the prize to Colin, who paid the amount to the
clerk. He turned round for a word with his unsuccessful
opponent. The man had gone....</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Phillip Rooke and his
several-times-removed nephew found themselves seated side by side
in the private quarters of an adjacent bar with whisky-and-sodas
in front of them.</p>

<p>"What brought you down this way to-day, young fellow?" the
auctioneer asked.</p>

<p>"Pure chance. I was on my way to Soho to see if there was a
story for the Sun in that stabbing affair a few nights ago, and
your mart was only a few yards out of my way. Tell
me&mdash;whose effects were you disposing of?"</p>

<p>"Bankrupt stock of a small jeweller who died suddenly.
Nothing but rubbish in the whole collection."</p>

<p>Colin drew his purchase from his pocket. The two men handled
it curiously. It was certainly a very battered-looking
object.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether our disappointed friend knew anything about
it," Colin speculated.</p>

<p>"Nasty-looking piece of work he was," the auctioneer observed
with a dubious grin. "If I were you, I should take that to a
metal-worker's and have it opened quickly. I don't trust a man
who wants a thing as badly as that dago seemed to want the
box."</p>

<p>Colin, who was six feet in height, in perfect condition and a
boxer of some renown, laughed softly.</p>

<p>"You're not suggesting that that fellow could take it away
from me?"</p>

<p>"Easily," his relative declared. "A knife between your
shoulder-blades from behind, my lad, and he would have the box
long before you woke up in the hospital&mdash;if ever you did
wake up."</p>

<p>"Rubbish! Why, the fellow cleared out as soon as he saw that
it was no good."</p>

<p>The auctioneer handed back the box.</p>

<p>"The fellow cleared out all right," he acknowledged, "but I
fancy that he was lurking at the corner when we crossed the
street, with another of the same kidney. If so, they saw us come
in here."</p>

<p>The young man finished his whisky-and-soda. There was an
amused smile upon his lips. He was full of the confidence which
presages disaster.</p>

<p>"I learnt how to deal with that sort of scoundrel," he said,
"when I was in the South African Police."</p>

<p>The two men rose to their feet.</p>

<p>"Any chance of our hearing the good news at dinner to-night?"
Mr. Phillip Rooke enquired.</p>

<p>Colin shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>"Ann is a little unreasonable," he complained. "She is of age
and I am getting on for thirty, but she can't seem to make up
her mind to settle down. Too adventurous a spirit, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"A good thing to have, anyway," the auctioneer observed.
"Eight o'clock at Rupert's. Short coats, black ties. Don't be
late."</p>

<p>The young man promised, but for once in his life he broke his
word.</p>

<p>The occasion was the monthly dinner of the unexpected
legatees of Desmond Rooke, deceased, and, except for a slight
undernote of anxiety, it was a very pleasant little gathering.
There were present Mrs. John Rooke, an attractive, almost
distinguished-looking, elderly lady with neatly coiffured grey
hair, a well-cut black evening dress and a recently acquired
smile of contentment which had transformed her whole appearance.
On one side of her was Mr. Percy Rooke, the retired insurance
agent, middle-aged to elderly, who sported a seldom-used monocle
and possessed a generally studious air. On the other side was
Mr. Phillip Rooke, the auctioneer, a pleasant-faced, cheery and
somewhat dominating person, and next to him an exceedingly
pretty young woman with brown hair and hazel eyes which
continually strayed towards the door.</p>

<p>"Colin's all right," her neighbour, who seemed to be in
charge of the party, declared. "I didn't part with him till
nearly five. He was at my sale down in Hatton Street. We both
talked about to-night."</p>

<p>"Whatever was he doing at an auction sale?" the girl
asked.</p>

<p>"He drops in sometimes. I rather hoped," Phillip Rooke went
on with a smile, "that he might have been looking at a few
suites of furniture I'd got to dispose of."</p>

<p>The girl blushed very slightly and looked up towards the
ceiling. Her elderly relative continued knowingly.</p>

<p>"Anyway, they weren't good enough. The only thing he bought
was a battered old metal box. What we had better do, I think, is
have just one more cocktail and then start dinner. I expect his
paper gave him a story to write up at the last moment, and you
know, although he's not obliged to do it, he hates to neglect
his work."</p>

<p>"That's true," the girl observed with relief. "I hadn't
thought about that."</p>

<p>The cocktails were scarcely served, however, before with a
little exclamation Ann sprang to her feet. Colin had just
entered and with a somewhat rueful expression upon his face was
making his way towards them. His arm was in a sling, there was
sticking-plaster on his cheek and he was walking with the help
of a cane.</p>

<p>"Colin!" the girl cried.</p>

<p>"It's that damned foreigner been after the box," Phillip
Rooke exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow!" the ex-insurance agent ejaculated, making
great play with his monocle.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry," the young man apologised. "I had a sort of
accident on my way back to change, and they took me to a
hospital to fix me up. When they had done with me it was so late
that I thought I had better come direct here and ask whether you
minded sitting down with such a battered object."</p>

<p>There was a little chorus of protestations. They almost
forced him into a chair. A glass was pressed into his hand. He
set it down a few seconds later empty.</p>

<p>"The quickest cocktail I ever drank!" he observed.</p>

<p>"Now tell us about the accident," Ann begged.</p>

<p>"I'll bet it was the man after the box," his uncle
declared.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you all the truth," the young man said,
making a mysterious sign with his empty glass to the wine
waiter. "You're right, Uncle Phillip. It was the chap after the
box. A few minutes after I left you it happened. I went down
that stupid little Tugwell Court to save a dozen yards and three
of them were laying for me. I knocked the first one out, but one
of the others got me from behind. The next thing I remember is
waking up in Charing Cross Hospital!"</p>

<p>"But what did they want?" Ann exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Highway robbery, I suppose," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Had you a lot of money on you?" Percy Rooke asked.</p>

<p>"Very little indeed, and what I had they didn't take!"</p>

<p>"What about the box?" the auctioneer demanded.</p>

<p>His nephew grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, that's rather the amazing part of it," he declared.
"You seem to take that fellow quite seriously, Uncle Phillip,
and I had an idea I saw him hanging around when I came out from
having that drink with you, so I just dropped back to the
Manhattan Cafe and handed it over to Louis&mdash;told him to put
it in the safe for the night."</p>

<p>"So they didn't get it after all!" the auctioneer exclaimed
vociferously.</p>

<p>"They did not," his nephew replied. "And, to tell you the
truth, I don't intend that they shall.... Now, I'm sure I've
kept you all waiting long enough."</p>

<p>The host of the little gathering gave the sign which the
ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel was awaiting and dinner was served. The episode
of the box was discussed from every point of view. Towards the
end of the meal Colin suddenly laid down his fork and stared
with wide-open wonder at the young man who was being shown to
his place at the adjoining table. He was being received with
every mark of respect. The manager, the chief ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel and
several obsequious waiters were already grouped around him.
Colin leaned over and grabbed Phillip Rooke by the arm.</p>

<p>"Am I going mad?" he demanded. "Look at that man who is just
taking his place!"</p>

<p>The auctioneer obeyed, and into his face, too, there crept an
expression of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a likeness in my life!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Likeness!" Colin repeated. "That's the man who bid against
me for the box, and set the other two on to me in Tugwell
Court."</p>

<p>Colin rose to his feet. The occupant of the next table, as
though conscious of some sense of disturbance, was looking
curiously towards them. His smile on this occasion, however, was
entirely pleasant. The furtive light had departed as though
forever from his eyes. He had the appearance of a well-bred
stranger slightly interested in what might be happening. Ann
laid her hand upon her companion's arm.</p>

<p>"Colin dear, you must be mistaken," she whispered. "Do sit
down."</p>

<p>Colin swallowed hard and looked across the table.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he asked Phillip Rooke.</p>

<p>"I'll be shot if I know what to think," was the blunt reply.
"If it's a likeness, I never saw such an extraordinary one in my
life. But look at the fellow! He has quite a pleasant smile, and
he's evidently someone of note here."</p>

<p>Colin stopped one of the ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel and whispered in his
ear.</p>

<p>"Tell me the name of the man at the next table?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel dropped his head discreetly.</p>

<p>"That's the Count Andromeda," he confided. "He's a very good
patron of the house.... Pardon, monsieur."</p>

<p>The waiter hurried away. Ann patted her companion's hand
gently.</p>

<p>"I hope you are convinced, Colin?"</p>

<p>"Of course he's convinced," the elderly lady declared. "I'm
sure that young man looks far too nice "</p>

<p>"I expect we're making a mistake, Colin," Phillip Rooke
interrupted, looking anxiously at his young relative. "I'll
admit it is a remarkable likeness, but we must be mistaken."</p>

<p>Colin, regardless of Ann's clinging fingers, rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong," he said. "If so, I am on the high road to
lunacy. Please trust me, all of you&mdash;you especially, Ann. I
am not going to misbehave in any way, but I am going to ask that
young man a question and watch his face while he answers
me."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," the ex-insurance agent advised, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"Please don't," Ann begged.</p>

<p>Colin, however, was already halfway towards the next table....
The young man, who had just finished ordering his dinner,
behaved perfectly. He seemed to take it for granted that Colin
was an acquaintance whose identity temporarily eluded him.
Colin's manners were equally unexceptionable. His perfectly
well-bred voice was raised scarcely at all. There was even the
glimmering of a smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>"I hope very much," he said, addressing the young man, "that
you will forgive my asking a personal question."</p>

<p>"Certainly," the other assented. "By the by, have we met
before? I do not seem to remember your face."</p>

<p>"Well, it's in rather a battered condition just now," Colin
replied good-humouredly, "but I was under the impression that we
met at an auction-room in Hatton Street this afternoon and
afterwards in Tugwell Court."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head in perplexity.</p>

<p>"I have been engaged in official work all day," he said, "and
I have never head of such a place as Hatton Street. Furthermore,
I am not in the habit of attending auctions."</p>

<p>Colin was staggered. His vis-&agrave;-vis met his steadfast,
incredulous scrutiny with complete composure.</p>

<p>"I was within a yard or so of you on both occasions," the
former said slowly. "It seems inconceivable that such a likeness
could exist."</p>

<p>The other glanced at his left hand, from which the fourth
finger was missing.</p>

<p>"If you were so near," he said, "you may have noticed my
infirmity. I have had to call attention to it before now in
order to establish my identity."</p>

<p>Colin shook his head.</p>

<p>"I didn't notice your hands," he admitted. "In fact, most of
the time you kept them in your overcoat pockets, except once
when you were counting some notes."</p>

<p>"I can produce my card," the young man went on with a
pleasant smile, "witnesses who were helping me with my work, the
secretary of my country's legation, who is also my cousin, my
chauffeur-valet and a few more people who between them, I think,
could provide a sufficient alibi. The people here in the
restaurant, too, know me well. If the person for whom you are
mistaking me--"</p>

<p>For the first time Colin was guilty of a slight breach of
manners.</p>

<p>"I have, of course, nothing more to say," he interrupted. "I
regret to have disturbed you. I offer my apologies, sir."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and limped back to his table. Ann
received him a little coldly.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you're satisfied now," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am satisfied," he answered. "I am satisfied that that
is the man who bid against me for the box, and one of the three
men who are responsible for my maimed condition. I know I can't
convince any of you. I shan't try. Ann, my dear, a glass of wine
with you, if you please. I must see you smile, and know that I
am forgiven."</p>

<p>"You are rather a dear," she weakened, "but you are very,
very obstinate."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE bell of his flat rang whilst Colin was
still at breakfast the next morning, and his auctioneer uncle
was shown in. The latter wasted no time.</p>

<p>"Read the paper?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Haven't glanced at it," Colin confessed.</p>

<p>"The Manhattan Caf&eacute; was broken into last night, the safe
rifled and a clean sweep made of its contents."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" Colin exclaimed. "There goes my box,
after all."</p>

<p>"Seems as though that foreigner chap has been one too many
for us," the auctioneer admitted "I thought we might go round to
the place where I got the stuff from. It's still open, though
the stock's gone. There may be someone there who knows something
about it."</p>

<p>Colin rose to his feet, filled his pipe and took up his
hat.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," he agreed.</p>

<p>On their way they passed the Manhattan Caf&eacute;. Phillip Rooke
stopped the car and they alighted. There was a small crowd of
loiterers about the place, and Mr. Golden, the proprieter, who
was talking to a police sergeant, came up to speak to them.
Louis was in the background arranging some bottles.</p>

<p>"Sorry to hear about your loss, Mr. Golden," the auctioneer
remarked.</p>

<p>"A very small matter," the caf&eacute; proprietor assured them.
"There was only about forty pounds in cash and most of the
papers were old IOU's that I should never have touched on."</p>

<p>"What about my box?" Colin asked Louis. "It seems to me I
should have done better to have kept it in my pocket:"</p>

<p>The barman stared at him for a moment blankly.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "I forgot all about the box."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It clean went out of my head. It don't make much odds now, I
don't suppose."</p>

<p>"You mean that you never put it in the safe?"</p>

<p>"I didn't and that's a fact, sir. What with one thing and
another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is it now, then?" Colin interrupted.</p>

<p>"One moment, sir."</p>

<p>The barman slipped out of a door behind. A moment or two
later he returned with the box in one hand, his linen coat over
his arm.</p>

<p>"It was just where I left it, sir, in my coat. It's been
hanging up there all night!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">A FEW minutes later Colin Rooke's uncle pushed
open the door of a dismantled shop about halfway down an
adjacent street. The clanging of the bell brought a
disagreeable-looking young man from somewhere in the rear.</p>

<p>"Come to see if those sweeps have left anything behind?" he
asked truculently.</p>

<p>"Not at all," the auctioneer replied. "We are here to ask you
a friendly question and you might find it worth your while to
give us a civil answer."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>Colin produced the box. The shop assistant stared at it
blankly.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want to know about that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Where Mr. Meadows got it and from whom?"</p>

<p>"You ain't the first to ask questions about it," the young
man observed. "There was some sort of a foreigner came
in&mdash;drove up in a taxi in a great state of excitement the
morning of the sale. Said someone had seen it in the window and
recognised it. I told him that he would probably get it for an
old song if he hurried, and pointed out your salerooms."</p>

<p>"How did it come into Mr. Meadows's hands?" Colin Rooke
asked.</p>

<p>The assistant smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Same way as pretty well all the junk that didn't come from
Birmingham," he replied. "There was a row in the street outside
old Mother Gluckstein's paint shop. Someone picked this up off
the pavement, scooted round here and Mr. Meadows gave him half a
crown for it. Looks about all it's worth, too."</p>

<p>Colin Rooke took out his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Here's a ten-shilling note for you," he said, "and a pound
extra if you promise that you won't answer a single question
about this box from anyone except the police."</p>

<p>The assistant clutched the money.</p>

<p>"It's a bet, guv'nor," he promised.</p>

<p>Outside, Colin was taking no risks. He bustled his uncle back
into the car.</p>

<p>"Twenty, Clerkenwell Road," he told the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"And when we get there?" Phillip Rooke enquired.</p>

<p>"Israel, Levy and Company, workers in metals," his nephew
confided. "I'm going to have this box opened."</p>

<p>The premises of Messrs. Israel, Levy &amp; company were
impressive enough in appearance, but the reception accorded to
Mr. Rooke and his nephew was scarcely enthusiastic. A shop-man
handled the box without any visible interest.</p>

<p>"What do you wish us to do with this?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Tell us what it is, for one thing," Colin replied.</p>

<p>"The outside is an alloy of some sort," the young man
pronounced. "There may be something inside&mdash; doubtful, I
should think."</p>

<p>He turned to an elderly man who had just joined him behind
the counter.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen want to know about this bit of stuff, Mr.
Levy," he confided.</p>

<p>Mr. Levy took the box into his hand, weighed it thoughtfully,
examined it through a magnifying-glass and suddenly betrayed an
interest which bordered upon excitement.</p>

<p>"Where did you come across this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," Colin replied. "What is it? A box or a
piece of hollow metal or what?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to say off-hand," the other answered, "but I'll
tell you what I think it is. I think that it is a box smeared
over with an alloy of metal which conceals the original casket
altogether. It is as though all the stuff you see here on the
outside was the brown paper around a parcel."</p>

<p>"How can we get rid of the brown paper?" Colin asked.</p>

<p>"We can remove the alloy," the metal-worker explained, "by
electricity, using a method of our own. It will take some little
time, and need very careful workmanship."</p>

<p>"What will it cost?" Colin persisted.</p>

<p>"We shall have to put a man on to the job who earns very high
wages," Mr. Levy warned him. "It might cost you twenty-five
pounds. On the other hand, if we discover after a time that the
alloy is only a cover for some other worthless material, we
could break it up for you at very little cost, if any."</p>

<p>"How long will it take?"</p>

<p>"Five days."</p>

<p>Colin laid his card upon the counter.</p>

<p>"We shall be back for it on the morning of the twenty-sixth,"
he announced.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">FIVE days later Colin and Ann were dining
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te at Rupert's Restaurant. Colin had the air of one happily
engaged in some interesting enterprise. Ann, on the other hand,
was distinctly nervous. He leaned a little towards her.</p>

<p>"I know it's hard, dear," he said, "but do try to keep your
eyes away from the door."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she answered penitently. "You believe that he'll
really come?"</p>

<p>"I do," her companion assured her. "But remember this, Ann.
He has telephoned for a table. There it is&mdash;next to ours.
He means to come, I'm sure, but he will arrive here in fear and
trembling. If he realises that we are waiting for him, if he
suspects in any way that those two men, for instance, at the
table behind us are Scotland Yard detectives, he will be
off."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I won't be stupid again," she promised. "The whole of my
attention shall be given to dinner and to you."</p>

<p>The orchestra was tuning up for the dance music; the place as
usual was filling up rapidly. Colin appeared to be absorbed in
fingering the strangely shaped casket of gold and inlaid ivory
which stood on the table between them.</p>

<p>"I am cleverer than you, Ann," he confided, "for I can see
without looking. Our friend has arrived. He is on his way here.
Here's luck to us!"</p>

<p>He raised his glass. Ann followed suit. They bent over the
menu and Colin summoned a ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel. When they had
completed the business of ordering their dinner, the young man
whom they were expecting had already taken his place at the
adjoining table. This time he did not persevere in his attitude
of haughty aloofness. On the contrary, there was a faint smile
upon his lips, a look of recognition in his eyes as he glanced
towards his neighbours. He laid down the menu which he had been
studying and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"We're for it, Ann," her companion whispered. "Sit tight and
keep cool. Remember our friends at the other table are watching.
There won't be any trouble."</p>

<p>The young man known to the management as the Count Andromeda
approached their table in the same tentative manner as when, on
a recent evening, Colin had himself made the advances. He
crossed the few yards between the two tables, and for a moment
there was an almost fanatical look in his eyes as he glanced
towards the casket. Then he seemed to recover himself. He bowed
to Ann, who made some sort of a response. He bowed less stiffly
and in friendly fashion towards Colin.</p>

<p>"You will permit my intrusion?" he begged.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I have come to offer you my apologies," he continued. "I did
not tell you the truth, Mr. Rooke, when we last met. My lips
were sealed. I was not at liberty to disclose the fact that the
little casket which I see upon the table before you was my
property."</p>

<p>"Scarcely that," Colin objected. "You will forfgive my
reminding you&mdash;you were a little short of money at the
auction, and it was I who purchased this box&mdash;and its
contents."</p>

<p>"I shall trust to your sense of honour in the matter," the
Count said courteously, "and I think in any case an arrangement
will be possible. You have at least penetrated the secret of the
casket. You have had the covering of alloy removed. You have
doubtless investigated its contents?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," Colin replied, "my cousin and I were
just about to do so. We only received the box in its present
condition from the metal-worker's an hour ago."</p>

<p>The Count bowed.</p>

<p>"If, before it is opened, I inform you of its contents," he
said earnestly, "you will at least admit that I have some claim
to consideration."</p>

<p>Colin hesitated as one choosing his words with
deliberation.</p>

<p>"I shall wish to do what is fair," he said, "if you can prove
that this box was stolen from you or lost."</p>

<p>"The box was enclosed in alloy by a certain great personage
whom I trust it will not be necessary for us to name," the Count
explained. "It contains one of the most famous jewels in the
world&mdash;an emerald. It belonged to a very beautiful
woman&mdash;a dear friend of mine. The emerald is practically
uncut and unique. I have its exact weight at home in a
pocketbook which I can easily give you. The lining of the casket
is of white satin and there is a crown in the right-hand corner
embroidered in black silk. A very large reward has been offered
for the stone, to which you will become entitled. Will you
please open the casket and see whether I have spoken the
truth?"</p>

<p>Colin looked across the table at his companion. Ann inclined
her head graciously.</p>

<p>"I think that what this gentleman says is reasonable," she
decided. "You had better open the casket, Colin. I have been
longing for you to do so."</p>

<p>They had spoken in very low tones, but the two men at the
next table had pushed back their chairs as though preparing for
departure and were only a few feet away. The young man, however,
seemed to have passed into another world. He saw nothing. He
heard nothing. His dilated eyes were fixed upon the casket...
. The orchestra was playing loudly. Dancers were streaming on to
the floor. The usual restaurant sounds&mdash;the clatter of
china, the popping of corks&mdash;had increased in volume. One
person there, however, was living in a world of his own. His
tense long fingers were clutching at the tablecloth. The pupils
of his eyes had grown larger. He seemed like a man freed from
the emotions of either fear or hope. He watched the handling by
Colin of the place where the secret spring was concealed, the
pushing back of the lid upon its stiff hinges. He gazed at what
lay disclosed and as realisation came he seemed to turn into
stone. The emerald was there very much as he had described it,
but its setting was a horrible thing. It rested upon the knuckle
of a man's finger, severed at the stump, rudely bound up&mdash;a
withered and ghastly thing!</p>

<p>Ann shrank away shivering. She held her hand in front of her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Colin had reached over and had unfolded the strip of
coarse-woven yellow paper at the head of which was a miniature
crown. He read aloud the few sentences written there in sprawling
characters:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">The jewel herein remains upon the finger of
the thief who stole it, then further polluted it by wearing it,
and now pays the price of discovery. If sudden death should come
to me at any time by the hands of an assassin, he will be the
guilty person. Proofs of his intention will be found in Box D,
Secret Service Department of the Ministry. They are deposited
there in the charge of General Nicova on the day of his exile.
N.</p>

<br>

<p>Something in the young man seemed to snap. He flung himself
across the table towards the coffer. Colin, however, held his
wrists in a grip of iron until the two men who had joined the
little party unnoticed led him away through the astounded crowd
.... Colin leaned over, locked the box and carefully secured
it in the pocket of his dinner jacket. He refilled their
glasses.</p>

<p>"Of course," Ann observed, steadying her voice with an
effort, "adventures like this are stimulating to the appetite,
but I should like to understand a little more of what it's all
about. You must remember that you have told me scarcely
anything."</p>

<p>"I'm not very clear about it all myself," he confessed, "but
as long as we have the emerald someone will find us out and tell
us the whole story."</p>

<p>"I believe that it must have belonged to a queen," she
sighed. "What a romance!"</p>

<p>"Nothing compared to ours, dear," he assured her.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT ten o'clock the next morning an urgent
telephone message summoned Ann to the Temple. She found Colin
already in conversation with a foreigner of distinguished
appearance and well-known name.</p>

<p>"The Baron," Colin explained, "has called about the
emerald."</p>

<p>The visitor threw himself upon the consideration of his two
young friends. His manner was charming and entirely
deprecatory.</p>

<p>"You will excuse," he begged, "if I do not make everything
quite clear to you. It is difficult. There is this story,
though. That emerald is famous in the history of my country. It
was indiscreetly loaned to a certain beautiful lady whose name
has often been mentioned in connection with that of my
sovereign. A scapegrace acquaintance of the lady's stole that
ring from her one night whilst on a secret visit and dared to
wear it upon his finger. He was surprised by my master, and
punished in the horrible fashion you have seen. He was also
exiled. My master is of passionate temperament. His fury was
excessive. He wrote the lines you read. He placed the emerald on
the finger in the casket, he had it soldered up and for safety
it was to be despatched to the Bank of England. The messenger
was murdered in Soho on the night of his arrival in the country,
and the casket disappeared. Of its subsequent adventures you
know as much as I."</p>

<p>"What will become of the man who was arrested last night?"
Ann asked.</p>

<p>"He will be extradited to my country," the Baron replied.
"Arrived there, he will be shot. There is an easily proved
charge against him of desertion from the army. And now, Mr.
Rooke, the question of the jewel?"</p>

<p>Colin unlocked his safe and took out the casket.</p>

<p>"Well," he enquired, "what do you propose?"</p>

<p>"The jewel is loathsome in the eyes of my master, but its
reappearance amongst the Royal jewels is necessary. The reward
offered was ten thousand pounds. I have here a draft on the Bank
of England for that amount."</p>

<p>Colin handed over the casket. The Baron accepted it with a
sigh of relief. He bowed to Ann. He shook hands with Colin. He
took his leave.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to have felt the emerald once more," Ann
sighed.</p>

<p>Colin held out the cheque.</p>

<p>"Feel this instead," he suggested, with masculine
brutality.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">MR. PERCY ROOKE'S trouble began upon a certain
morning when driving his very beautiful new Daimler car from his
cousin's select guest-house in Hampstead to the small office
which he had rented in Norfolk Street. He was proceeding slowly
along the main road at a respectable distance behind a crowded
omnibus. He saw the eager gestures of the girl in the middle of
the pathway, he even heard her appeal to the driver, but the
part of the incident which affected him most was the look of
weary disappointment on the girl's face as the bus pursued,
without stopping, its relentless course. For once in his life he
acted upon impulse. He brought his car to a standstill and
leaned towards the pavement.</p>

<p>"The buses all seem very full this morning," he said. "If you
are going towards the City can I give you a lift?"</p>

<p>She looked at him blankly. At first she seemed scarcely to
understand. He opened the door invitingly. She stepped from the
kerb and took her place by his side. Still she remained
speechless.</p>

<p>"I cannot think why they don't run more buses at this busy
time," he remarked a little lamely, as he started off.</p>

<p>"I wish they would," she agreed. "I get so tired of waiting
about for them."</p>

<p>A gentle, almost a pleasant voice. Percy Rooke permitted
himself a glance at his companion. She was very pale, even for a
City worker. She was neatly dressed, but her clothes lacked any
sort of distinction. It seemed to him in those first few moments
that she would have been plain but for the dark, suffering eyes
and the wistful appeal of her tremulous lips.</p>

<p>"What part of the City are you making for?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"The Strand," she answered. "My work is in Surrey
Street."</p>

<p>"Capital! I go to Norfolk Street&mdash;scarcely a hundred
yards away."</p>

<p>She leaned back amongst the cushions with a faint gesture of
content.</p>

<p>"Yours is a beautiful car," she said. "After the buses this
is wonderful."</p>

<p>"You don't like buses?"</p>

<p>"Does anyone?" she queried. "Yet, after all, it's not the
buses. It's the people&mdash;the crowd, the pushing and the
atmosphere."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes deliberately and Percy Rooke, who had
intuition in such things, felt that she was indisposed for
conversation. He gave his whole attention to the driving of the
car, which for him was a new accomplishment, and the silence
between them prevailed until he drew up by the kerb at the top
of Surrey Street.</p>

<p>"There you are," he exclaimed. "I think we've been a little
quicker than the bus!"</p>

<p>She slipped not ungracefully down on to the pavement and
turned to look at him.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," she said. "The drive has been so
pleasant."</p>

<p>He raised his hat and the incident would probably have passed
altogether from his mind but for the smile which suddenly parted
her lips before she turned round and disappeared amongst the
throng. It was a strange, almost seductive, though mirthless
gesture, and the dark eyes looking into his at the same moment
seemed to lend to it a puzzling, indefinable significance. Then
she was gone. The memory of the smile remained.</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed for Percy Rooke very much like all
others. He transacted a little business, left his office at five
o'clock, drove slowly home to Hampstead, played a game of
billiards with his cousin's boarder, a Colonel McGleesh, dined
in tranquil comfort, retired to bed at half-past ten and,
somewhat to his surprise, went to sleep at an unduly late hour,
haunted by the memory of a smile. In the morning he found
himself in a curiously undecided frame of mind. It was not his
custom to go to the office every day, and being Saturday he had
intended to invite his cousin, the proprietress of his temporary
home, to take a drive into the country. Without any conscious
change of intention, however, he ordered his car round at the
usual time, started out Citywards and repeated his itinerary of
the previous day. He drove more slowly along the Broadway, and
gazed almost eagerly at the scattered little groups of would-be
passengers waiting at the various bus stations. He arrived at
the spot where he had picked up his previous day's companion
without catching a glimpse of her. Unreasonably disappointed, he
pulled up by the kerb and lit a cigarette. Just as he was
closing his briquet he felt a step on the footboard of the car.
He glanced around. With quite an unreasonable glow of pleasure
he realised that she was calmly taking her place by his
side.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he greeted her.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she replied. "Were you waiting for me?"</p>

<p>"I was hoping that you would come."</p>

<p>She disposed of her bag in her lap, toyed for a moment with a
bunch of keys she was carrying, settled herself in her seat and
leaned back, half closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Surrey Street?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she answered listlessly.</p>

<p>"Don't you go there every morning?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was not sure that I would go to-day, though. I am not
obliged to work on Saturdays."</p>

<p>He drove on in silence. The few young women with whom he had
come in contact, especially since he had become known as one of
the famous Rooke legatees, were seemingly all the time anxious,
a little too anxious, to talk and make the best of themselves.
This girl, with her habit of silence and the almost ungraceful
slouch of her repose, seemed utterly indifferent. He had the
feeling that if he asked her questions it would bore her to
reply. After all, though, he reminded himself, she was here of
her own accord.</p>

<p>"What sort of work do you do?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Thieving of various sorts," she replied.</p>

<p>He glanced at her as though eager to catch the trend of her
thoughts. She was quite indifferent, however. She showed no
signs of having said anything unusual.</p>

<p>"Ought I to look after my pocketbook?"</p>

<p>"I might take it if I had the chance! Pocket-picking is not
one of my specialities, though."</p>

<p>"How do you indulge your criminal instincts, then?" he
enquired good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"I help other people to rob on a larger scale," she
confided.</p>

<p>He stole another glance at her. She was just as pale as
yesterday, and with the light from her eyes half hidden and her
mouth in repose her face lacked character. Her clothes were even
shabbier than he had thought them. Only her fingers&mdash;she
wore no gloves&mdash;seemed well cared for, and her shoes,
though old, had been fashioned with a certain elegance.</p>

<p>"You don't look like a thief," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I suppose I look too stupid. All the same, I am one. I don't
know what your profession is. If you are a detective, you ought
to hunt me down and have me sent to prison."</p>

<p>"I am an insurance agent," he told her.</p>

<p>"Fires and that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Fire insurance is part of our business."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of the firm of Engelhart and Crisp in
Surrey Street?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked at her dubiously.</p>

<p>"Got into some sort of trouble, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Crisp is in prison," she told him. "Mr. Engelhart spends
most of his time hiding from people who want money from him. I
have been carrying on the business&mdash;what there is to
do."</p>

<p>"A very bad case of fraud," he pronounced. "If I were you, I
would find another post."</p>

<p>"Nice references I should have, shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"You have probably worked for other firms."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I went straight from school to Engelhart and Crisp. I think
the firm engaged me because they believed that I should be
tractable. You see, Mr. Crisp is my father."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"You needn't be. How were you to know? You wouldn't like to
engage me yourself, I suppose? People are fighting rather shy of
our firm just now."</p>

<p>"I haven't enough business to employ a secretary."</p>

<p>"I dare say I could bring you plenty. I might show you how to
make money. I don't know, though," she went on. "You look almost
painfully honest."</p>

<p>"If I am," he replied, "it is because I have no temptation to
be otherwise. I have a certain amount of money outside of
anything I earn."</p>

<p>She took the trouble to look at him more closely. Even then
her eyes were devoid of any personal interest.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she remarked, "that is just as well."</p>

<p>At the corner of Surrey Street he drew up by the kerb. She
made no motion to leave the car.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to the office this morning," he said. "I
very seldom work on Saturday."</p>

<p>"Drive me somewhere, then," she suggested. "A very
disagreeable man is probably coming to the office on a very
disagreeable piece of business. I think it would be very much
better if I didn't meet him. If I do what he wants me to do, I
shall probably join my father in prison."</p>

<p>"What about Hindhead?"</p>

<p>"Any place," she answered listlessly. "Don't start for a
moment, though, please."</p>

<p>Her face was turned from him. She was looking down the
narrow, crowded street. He had no means of divining her
thoughts, of making even a guess at the nature of her temporary
irresolution.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind waiting for five minutes," she begged, "I
think that I had better go down to the door, at any rate. The
office boy may be there, and only Mr. Engelhart and I have keys
to the place."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he agreed. "I will wait with pleasure."</p>

<p>She slipped from her place, and again as he watched her he
took note of her graceful movements. She was gone a little
longer than the five minutes which she had stipulated. When she
returned she was walking quickly. She had come up the ascent
with almost flying footsteps, but she was not in the least out
of breath. She sank into her place with a sigh of relief. Her
only comment was a brief one.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I went," she said.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT always seemed to Percy Rooke that the
keynote of his relations with Miss Dorothy Crisp, as he
discovered her name to be, was struck that morning when, later
on, after a brief pause for an <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i> at a wayside inn,
they drew up upon the fringe of a stretch of picturesque
moorland country to light a cigarette. He laid his hand for a
moment upon her slim cool fingers. She made no attempt to
withdraw them, but her perfect impassivity would have chilled a
far more amorous buccaneer than the middle-aged insurance agent.
Her brief speech completed the douche.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "if you really care for that sort of
thing, here I am. In your way I suppose you have been very kind
to me and naturally you look for the usual sort of return. I
wish I didn't hate it so much. I am one of those unfortunate
people who seem to be born without a temperament and who hate
being touched."</p>

<p>He rose nobly to the situation.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," he confided, "I am not much of a
philanderer myself, but your hand is rather attractive."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right," she observed with a relieved smile.
"You must remember, after all, it's the hand of a criminal. If I
doze off, don't be angry with me. I have accomplished something
this morning which has been on my mind for a long time. Now I am
happy, this air is glorious and I haven't slept for some
nights."</p>

<p>"A good bit of road in front," he remarked cheerfully. "I've
never tried out my fourth speed properly."</p>

<p>It was without a doubt a queer sort of day. They lunched
pleasantly enough, but with the minimum of polite conversation.
She vouchsafed no more revelations of her life, but when her
companion had brought the car to a standstill at the spot which
she indicated, and the moment for farewell came, she seemed to
throw off her lethargy, to become for a few seconds intensely in
earnest. Her eyes sought his, her fingers rested upon his
hand.</p>

<p>"Please will you believe," she begged, "that I am very
grateful indeed to you for to-day. You are very human and very
nice. I say good-bye to you now and I want you to remember
this&mdash;I regret nothing. I am quite, quite happy.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>She checked the reply which was upon his lips, brushed aside
his offer of assistance, sprang lightly out and disappeared down
the street, at the corner of which they had drawn up, with a
farewell wave of the hand. Percy Rooke drove back to his garage
a little dazed by the enigmatic nature of her farewell.</p>

<p>"Pleasant day?" his cousin asked him as he strolled into the
lounge a few minutes before dinner-time.</p>

<p>"Very restful," he answered. "I've been down to Hindhead. Any
news?"</p>

<p>"More horrors," she replied with a grimace. "A man found dead
in his office in the next street to yours."</p>

<p>"Which street?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Surrey Street, I think it was. He was found in the office of
that man who has gone to prison&mdash;Crisp. You know&mdash;the
fire-insurance man."</p>

<p>Percy Rooke looked with unseeing eyes at the tray of
cocktails which the butler was handing round.</p>

<p>"Evening papers arrived?" he asked in a queer strained
voice.</p>

<p>"You'll find them in the lounge, Mr. Rooke," the man replied.
"Can I get you one?"</p>

<p>Percy Rooke's reply was inaudible. He was already on his way
to the lounge. He picked up the <i>Evening Standard</i> and
found the paragraph he sought at once.</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">Late this afternoon the dead body of a man
was discovered in the offices of Messrs. Engelhart &amp; Crisp,
Surrey Street, Strand. He had apparently been killed by a
revolver bullet which had penetrated the heart and the state of
the office seemed to indicate that a struggle had taken place
before the fatal shot had been fired.</p>

<p class="newspaper">Later. The deceased man has been identified
as Mr. Herbert Engelhart, principal of the firm of Engelhart
&amp; Crisp, insurance brokers. The junior partner is at present
serving five years' penal servitude for fraud in connection with
certain transactions in which the firm had been engaged. The
deceased had also been charged, but acquitted. The police are
anxious to obtain information as to the whereabouts of a young
woman, secretary to the firm, who is reported to have been seen
on her way to the office within a few minutes of the deceased's
arrival.</p>

<br>

<p>The paper slipped from Rooke's fingers. He was not a brave
man, and there was a chill feeling at his heart. He remembered
the enigmatic words of his companion of the morning, her
hesitation at leaving the car, the vacant look in her eyes upon
her return. It was a horrible admission to have to make, but it
seemed that he had very probably spent the day is close
companionship with a murderess.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE moment which Rooke had dreaded with an
almost overwhelming fear, which had kept him stretched upon the
rack through long sleepless nights, brought him upon its arrival
an extraordinary, an almost unbelievable sense of tranquillity.
The scene was exactly as he had pictured it&mdash;horrible in
its intense and dramatic reality. There was the judge only a few
feet away&mdash;a stern, inhuman figure of fate. There were the
rows of bewigged counsel, the crowd of eager spectators pinned
in behind, the still, white figure of the prisoner in the dock,
standing as he had imagined she might, her hands folded in front
of her, a lifeless calm on her set expressionless features. The
duskiness of the court, the close atmosphere which he had
dreaded, the subdued, occasional whispering, the periods of
spellbound silence, were all in evidence. He could scarcely
believe, as he leaned forward in calm preparation for his
ordeal, that the moment had really arrived, that it was really
he&mdash;Percy Rooke &mdash;the man of nerves and many forms of
cowardice, who stood there with a great responsibility upon his
shoulders, the man for whose evidence the whole Court was
waiting, the man who was the object of palpable curiosity to
those nine men and three women kept rigidly apart, leaning
forward now that the crucial moment had arisen. The counsel for
the defence, who had delayed for a few moments to confer with
his clerk, turned towards him. The examination had begun. It was
all so easy&mdash;nothing to do but reply to simple
questions.</p>

<p>"Your name is Percy Rooke?"</p>

<p>"Percy Rooke."</p>

<p>"You are an insurance agent with offices in Norfolk
Street?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On the morning of the thirteenth of May you saw the prisoner
for the first time in the neighbourhood of the Hampstead
Broadway?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Will you tell the Court what happened?"</p>

<p>Percy Rooke turned slightly towards the jury.</p>

<p>His voice was well pitched and clear. He seemed almost the
perfect witness.</p>

<p>"I was driving my car to the office at about nine o'clock,"
he said. "I saw her on the sidewalk, endeavouring to board a
bus. They were all full, however, so I pulled up and offered her
a lift. I took her as far as Surrey Street."</p>

<p>"That was the first time you had met the prisoner?" the judge
enquired.</p>

<p>"The first time, my lord."</p>

<p>"Continue, if you please."</p>

<p>"I passed almost the same spot again on the morning of the
fourteenth of May. I did not at first see the prisoner on that
occasion, but when I pulled up to light a cigarette I saw her
standing by the side of the car. I invited her to enter and we
started off at once for the City."</p>

<p>"Had the prisoner any luggage?" counsel asked.</p>

<p>"An ordinary handbag under her arm. I happened to notice it
because it seemed to me singular that she should be carrying in
her hand also a small bunch of keys."</p>

<p>There was a subdued murmur in court. The mention of the keys
carried with it a tremendous significance.</p>

<p>"Did you have any conversation with the prisoner on the drive
to the City?"</p>

<p>"I remarked that it was a fine morning," the witness
continued, "and I suggested that perhaps instead of going to the
office she would like to take a drive into the country."</p>

<p>"And the prisoner's reply?"</p>

<p>"She hesitated for some time. She admitted that she was very
tired, and that she would like to come, but she seemed uncertain
about her work at the office."</p>

<p>"You knew with whom she was employed?"</p>

<p>"She had told me her name on the previous morning."</p>

<p>"You knew of the unfortunate position in which the firm of
which her father was a member was involved?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Now tell me," counsel went on, "what happened when you
pulled up at the corner of Surrey Street?"</p>

<p>"I repeated my invitation. The prisoner said that she must go
down and see if she was wanted at the office, and if not she
would return in a few minutes. I opened the door for her and she
stepped out."</p>

<p>"Did she take the handbag with her?"</p>

<p>"She was carrying it under her arm."</p>

<p>"What about the keys?"</p>

<p>Again there was that indrawn breath of suspense throughout
the court. The witness's voice had never been more clear.</p>

<p>"I did not see them at the time," he replied.</p>

<p>"During the journey," counsel continued, "you did not see the
prisoner slip the keys into her bag?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that she did nothing of the sort," was the firm
reply. "I must have noticed it."</p>

<p>"Very well," counsel went on, hitching his gown a little
farther up on his shoulder. "Tell us what happened
afterwards."</p>

<p>"The prisoner was gone barely five minutes. When she returned
she stepped back into the car and said that it would be quite
all right for her to be away from the office for the day. We
started off immediately."</p>

<p>"The prisoner did not seem to you in any way discomposed or
flurried on her return?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"She had no appearance of having passed through any exciting
experience?"</p>

<p>"She was perfectly calm."</p>

<p>"She spoke of nothing which might have occurred at the
office?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Rooke, I am going to return to the subject of the
keys," counsel continued. "You say that, so far as your
knowledge and observation went, the prisoner left the car
without the keys. She returned with the bag still under her arm.
When did you next see the keys?"</p>

<p>"Within the next ten minutes or so," witness replied. "I
noticed that she was peering about in the bottom of the car and
feeling the cushions behind and I asked her what was the
matter."</p>

<p>"And what did she reply?"</p>

<p>"She told me that she was taking French leave from the
office, because when she had arrived there she found that she
had not taken the keys and the door was locked. We were in a
traffic jam, so I helped in the search. We discovered them at
the back of the cushions where she had been seated."</p>

<p>"You discovered the keys," counsel repeated. "Your impression
is then that the keys had remained in the car all the time that
the prisoner had left you to visit the office?"</p>

<p>"That is not an impression. It is a certainty."</p>

<p>This time the murmur was almost one of agitation.</p>

<p>"During the rest of the day did the prisoner show any signs
of depression or excitement?"</p>

<p>"She seemed perfectly normal. I knew, of course, that she
must be in trouble, because I had taken some interest in the
case in which her father had been concerned, and I knew that the
business was being wound up, but she did not refer to
it&mdash;no more did I."</p>

<p>"And to use your own words, Mr. Rooke&mdash;I must be
insistent on this point&mdash; there was no time during the day
which you spent together when the prisoner gave you any
impression of being upset or disturbed?"</p>

<p>"Not for one moment," was the emphatic assertion. "She was
inclined to be depressed, but she seemed to be enjoying the
drive, and our lunch together. When we parted she thanked me for
the day and left me with the impression that she had enjoyed
it."</p>

<p>The counsel glanced at the judge, he glanced at the jury and
resumed his seat. There was a brief pause and then almost a buzz
of conversation. The judge looked around severely. Counsel for
the prosecution rose to his feet amidst a dead silence. The
nervous little man in the box prepared for his ordeal with no
visible effort.</p>

<p>"According to your evidence, Mr. Rooke," the former began
quietly, "your acquaintance with the prisoner commenced on the
day before the committal of the crime with which she is
charged?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"You picked her up in the street and drove her to the
City?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And the next day you did the same thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it a habit of yours to drive round offering free rides to
attractive-looking women?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why did you do it on this occasion, then?"</p>

<p>"I thought that the young lady looked very tired and the
buses were very full."</p>

<p>"I see. Your action, then, was one of pure good nature?"</p>

<p>"It seemed so to me. It was an action perhaps liable to be
misunderstood by people with an unpleasant outlook upon
life."</p>

<p>Counsel for the prosecution frowned. He glanced angrily
towards the back of the court, from which came the sound of
subdued chuckles.</p>

<p>"When the prisoner stepped into the car with her bag under
her arm and the bunch of keys in her hand didn't it occur to you
as strange that she did not put the keys in the bag?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Answer this question carefully if you please. When did you
next see the keys after the prisoner had seated herself by your
side and you had driven off?"</p>

<p>"When we fished them out from behind the cushion."</p>

<p>"That was after the prisoner had left you for five or ten
minutes to visit her office?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. We were well on the way to Guildford."</p>

<p>"So that the keys, according to you, were in the car during
the temporary absence of the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"You are asking the Court to believe, then, that the prisoner
entered your car with the keys in her hand, showing, I imagine,
the importance she attached to them, that she got out at the top
of Surrey Street to visit her office knowing that she could
enter it in no way except with the help of those keys, but still
leaving them behind her?"</p>

<p>"That is certainly what she did."</p>

<p>"You will swear that according to the best of your belief and
knowledge&mdash; you are on your oath, remember&mdash;it was
impossible for her to have had the keys with her when she left
the car to visit her office?"</p>

<p>"It was quite impossible."</p>

<p>"She could not, whilst you were occupied in driving, have
brought them out from her bag afterwards or her pocket and have
slipped them under the seat by her side?"</p>

<p>"Quite impossible."</p>

<p>Counsel for the prosecution resumed his seat. Almost
immediately his place was taken by the counsel for the
defence.</p>

<p>"I wish to ask the witness, with your lordship's permission,
only one more question," he said. "The matter, however, is of
such vital importance that, notwithstanding the clear and
convincing way in which the witness has given his evidence, I
shall ask him to make one repetition. It was in your opinion
impossible for the prisoner to have left your car to pay her
visit to the office with the keys in her possession?"</p>

<p>"It was a sheer impossibility," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>There was a portentous murmur when Percy Rooke left the box.
A whole train of damning circumstantial evidence seemed suddenly
to have lost its point. Counsel were whispering together. There
was an audible burst of conversation. Percy Rooke heard nothing.
He felt only the policeman's kindly hand upon his arm as he was
guided towards a chair. He felt the water trickling down his
throat. The court was going up and down. That murmur of
conversation had become like thunder in his ears. Soon he was
outside, being helped along the passages. Fresh air came to him
like a wonderful thing. The bonds seemed to fall away. He had
survived his ordeal.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"TELL me how it really feels," his distant
relative, Ann Rooke, begged that evening at dinner-time, "to be
the hero of an occasion?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather exaggerating the affair?" Percy Rooke
remonstrated.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," was the confident reply. "You had to
submit yourself to examination and cross-examination by two of
the cleverest men at the Bar, with the jury listening intently
to every word, and knowing that a mistake, a contradiction, even
a hesitation, and that poor girl might have been hanged. I don't
call myself a nervous person, but I should have been terrified
to death."</p>

<p>"I agree with Ann," Colin Rooke declared. "All the other
evidence had gone against the girl. It was proved that it had
been the dead man's evidence which had sent her father to penal
servitude. It was proved that there had been ill-feeling between
the two, owing to the girl having resisted his advances. The
medical testimony was to the effect that the wound could only
have been self-inflicted with great difficulty, and the revolver
was proved to have belonged to the girl's father and had been
kept in a drawer of the desk. It was only necessary to prove
that the girl had obtained access to the office when she left
you to go there and the jury would have had to find her
guilty."</p>

<p>"She might have knocked at the door," Phillip Rooke
suggested, "and Engelhart might have let her in."</p>

<p>"If you had heard the rest of the evidence, you would have
realised how unlikely that was," Colin pointed out. "Engelhart
was obviously anxious to avoid a meeting with her. He had left
word that if she came to the office while he was there she was
not to be allowed to go up. If she insisted on mounting the
stairs and knocking at the door, he told the doorkeeper that he
would refuse to open it, and no notice need be taken, however
persistent she might be. The doorkeeper happened to arrive a
little late that morning, but even if he had been present, in
the face of Engelhart's stern injunction it is certain that he
would not have admitted her. Unless she had brought her own keys
she would never have obtained admission to the office. Engelhart
had very serious reasons for wishing to avoid her, and Saturday
was a day upon which she was not supposed to go to Surrey
Street. Hence his presence there."</p>

<p>"Mr. Henslow, the barrister, who is staying with us," Mrs.
Rooke confided, "takes exactly the same view. He maintains that
if it could have been proved that the girl had the keys with her
when she left the car, or that she had them when she returned,
she would probably have been found guilty. He paid you a great
compliment, Mr. Rooke," she went on, smiling across at Percy,
"on the manner in which you gave your evidence and the
uncompromising way you answered questions. Even Sir Richard,
clever, brilliant man though he is, could not lure you into a
single contradiction or evasion. You spoke like a man who knew
the truth and meant the whole of the rest of the world to know
it, too."</p>

<p>Percy Rooke bowed his acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Ann reflected, "how that poor girl is spending
the evening?"</p>

<p>"She must have friends," Colin observed. "I saw in our late
edition that she had left for either abroad or the country. She
must be blessing you, Percy."</p>

<p>"What for?" he asked calmly.</p>

<p>"For your marvellous evidence."</p>

<p>Percy Rooke's reply was for a moment or two delayed. He
glanced around at the adjoining tables. It was obvious that no
one was within hearing.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the law," he asked Colin Rooke, "that a person who
has been charged with the crime of murder and has been found not
guilty can never be charged again for the same offence?"</p>

<p>"That is the law," the journalist admitted.</p>

<p>Rooke dabbed at his forehead with a highly perfumed
handkerchief. He reached for the bottle, filled his glass with
champagne and drank it off. His unnatural state of repression
left him. He was a human being once more.</p>

<p>"I should not think," he said, "that there is a man alive who
could have sent a girl with a smile like hers to the gallows. My
evidence," he concluded, after one more glance around, "was a
tissue of lies!"</p>

<p class="first">COLIN ROOKE, with the air of a man desperately
bored, looked at his empty glass and sighed. The stranger who
was seated on the adjacent stool at the bar of the very famous
and exceedingly exclusive Hobgoblin Club leaned slightly over
and addressed him.</p>

<p>"You can have your glass filled again," he said, "and then
again, but the man for whom you are looking will not come. You
waste your time."</p>

<p>Colin scrutinised his neighbour curiously.</p>

<p>"That's bad news," he remarked. "How do you know that I'm
waiting for anyone?"</p>

<p>The other smiled. His body and his clothes were
insignificant. His face was intelligent. To judge from the
slight movement at the corners of his sensitive mouth he was
smiling inwardly. He had not the air of a man who was conscious
of taking a liberty.</p>

<p>"Well, I might reply that it was pretty obvious," he replied.
"You sit there at an angle which enables you to watch the door
without seeming to watch it. Every time it is opened I can trace
the reaction in your apprehensions. You are waiting for someone
you are half anxious and half afraid to see. I can set your mind
at ease or disappoint you&mdash;I am not sure which. He will not
come."</p>

<p>Colin attracted the attention of the barman and touched his
glass. The latter smiled, removed the empty glass and, turning
his back upon the two men, stretched up to the shelf, selecting
the bottles. The stranger leaned a trifle nearer to Colin.</p>

<p>"Get out of here, you idiot," he advised. "If he comes, there
will be hell to pay when he and Belle meet. How would that
little rencontre suit you, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Colin's expression was one of bland bewilderment. He took the
glass which the barman had pushed across the counter and twirled
its stem between his fingers.</p>

<p>"I wonder who you think I am?" he said.</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous," the other enjoined. "I know who you
are and I tell you you are a fool to be in this place at all.
Have you noticed how empty the dancing-rooms are?"</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem to be so many people as usual," Colin
admitted. "I can't say I am surprised at that. There are several
other amusements to be met with in this place. What I should
like to know is&mdash;for whom are you mistaking me?"</p>

<p>The man by his side slipped from his stool and strolled a few
feet away to a point of vantage from which he obtained a better
view of the dancing-room beyond. For a moment he watched the
couples swaying around and moved his head in time to the
music.</p>

<p>"Several friends of yours, at any rate, don't seem to have
been scared away yet," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I wonder who you think I am or what you know of my friends?"
Colin reflected.</p>

<p>The man in the rather crumpled dinner suit smiled. He mounted
his stool again and whispered confidentially in his companion's
ear.</p>

<p>"Room number five on the third floor, Annexe A, New Scotland
Yard. Not exactly an academy show of portraits, but interesting
in their way. 'The Rogues' Gallery,' Inspector Henderson calls
it. The seventh from the end on the wall opposite as you enter.
What about that, eh?"</p>

<p>Colin took a long sip of his cocktail. Anything to avoid for
a second or two the searching, half-fierce, half-quizzical gaze
of those narrow black eyes. He set down the glass. The moment
when he might have betrayed himself had passed.</p>

<p>"Whatever makes you think that I am Abel Martin?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The other slipped from his stool again with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"You make me tired," he said and strolled away.</p>

<p>Colin entered the dancing-room. The stranger's words came
into his mind as he looked around. There was certainly a tense
air about the place. He approached a dark, untidy-looking woman
who was seated at a table with a vanity case outspread before
her and a mirror in her hand.</p>

<p>"Will you dance?" he invited.</p>

<p>The girl laid down the glass. She was carelessly made up, her
dress was unbecoming, but she had large flashing eyes and an
ill-humoured but provocative expression.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked. "I don't want to be disturbed
for nothing. Supper afterwards or what?"</p>

<p>Colin smiled. He rather admired her frankness.</p>

<p>"No supper," he told her. "I dined too late. A bottle of
champagne and a jetton or two if you like."</p>

<p>"There's no gambling to-night and there are no jettons," the
girl said. "Still, a bottle of champagne is something. If you
dance badly, I shall leave off."</p>

<p>Colin danced exceedingly well, as his partner was pleased to
admit after the first turn. She gave herself languorously to the
music. When it stopped they were almost facing the man in the
crumpled dinner clothes. He was leaning against the wall, his
arms folded, his eyes travelling restlessly around the room.</p>

<p>"Who is that fellow?" Colin asked.</p>

<p>"If you take my advice, you will mind your own business," was
the curt reply. "People who ask questions of us girls or the
staff are not popular here."</p>

<p>"Seems to me a queer sort of place," he observed.</p>

<p>"It is," the girl agreed. "There are a good many of your sort
who have left here in an ambulance&mdash;one or two who have not
left at all!"</p>

<p>"Do you want to dance once more?"</p>

<p>"Stop asking all those questions, then," the girl snapped and
slipped into his arms as the music recommenced.</p>

<p>They danced again and the girl left off with obvious
reluctance. Colin ordered champagne and changed his manner. He
did his best to be impressive. His companion listened to him
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Who brought you here?" she asked. "You are not a
member."</p>

<p>"I have been a member for years," Colin assured her.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" the girl replied. "I know every one of the regular
members."</p>

<p>"I am abroad most of the time," he explained. "What's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Belle. You can make whatever you like out of that."</p>

<p>"And who is the man I asked you about?"</p>

<p>She looked across the table at him steadily.</p>

<p>"Do you want to get me the sack?"</p>

<p>"I might offer you a better position."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" she scoffed. "I'm not your sort and I'm not a
fool. You are not here to dance with us girls. You haven't any
friends here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," he interrupted. "I came to meet one."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what he's calling himself just now. I shall
know him all right when I see him, though."</p>

<p>The girl drank a full glass of champagne appreciatively.</p>

<p>"You know how to order wine," she admitted. "That Pommery is
the best stuff they've got. But you are kind of young to wander
about in these places alone, looking for a man whose name you
don't know. Kind of stupid, too, to choose me for a companion
to-night of all nights. Come from the country, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Brought up on a farm," he confided. "I'm up for the cattle
show."</p>

<p>She smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I like you," she said. "If you'll leave off asking
questions, we might get on together. Are you a detective or a
journalist?"</p>

<p>"Detective," he replied in a hoarse but very audible whisper.
"I'm here looking for a murderer."</p>

<p>He watched the shiver pass through her body. For a few
seconds she lost her poise, then she snapped open her vanity
case and her face was momentarily concealed. Colin, however, had
been watching her like a lynx. He had seen the involuntary turn
of her head. He had realised her moment of shock.</p>

<p>"I'm going," she announced abruptly. "Want to drive me
home?"</p>

<p>"Delighted," he answered. "Wait until I've paid my bill."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">EVEN Colin, who was by no means an habitu&eacute; of
such haunts, recognised the sitting-room as being a little
unusual. It was small enough, but a window was open and a log
fire burning. There was a profusion of country-grown flowers,
mostly of the sweet-smelling variety. There were two or three
old but reasonably good French engravings upon the walls, a
shelf full of books, upon the table the current issues of
various magazines&mdash;mostly French and German. The atmosphere
of the place was curiously at variance with what he had
anticipated. She threw herself into an easy chair opposite to
his and folded her hands in front of her.</p>

<p>"And now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You said something about a drink," he reminded her.</p>

<p>She frowned and rose reluctantly to her feet.</p>

<p>"You have been drinking champagne and I haven't any. If you
like," she suggested, "you can have a glass of liqueur
brandy."</p>

<p>"Excellent," he agreed.</p>

<p>She passed into an inner room, closing the door behind her,
and emerged in a few moments with two beautifully-cut goblets,
each containing a small quantity of brandy. She placed them on
the table.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't give you more," she said. "It is rather
good&mdash;Courvoisier '65. A gentleman friend gave me a bottle
the other night and we nearly finished it."</p>

<p>He raised his glass and sniffed its contents.</p>

<p>"Smells good," he observed.</p>

<p>She nodded and, turning back to the door, closed it. When she
threw herself once more into her chair his glass was empty.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," he apologised. "Too good to keep."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"The only reason I invited you to drive me home," she
complained, "was because I thought you had such good manners.
However, one makes mistakes. Sure you liked it?"</p>

<p>"Best brandy I have tasted for a long time," he assured
her.</p>

<p>She drank her own and set down the glass.</p>

<p>"Well, you have had your drink," she said. "And now?"</p>

<p>"You seem in a desperate hurry to get rid of me."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I am," she replied. "As a matter of fact,
before you go &mdash;if I let you go&mdash;you must satisfy my
curiosity. You must tell me&mdash;why did you come at all?"</p>

<p>"A trifle abrupt, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am of a nation which is supposed to lack finesse," she
answered. "I am Russian."</p>

<p>"You speak wonderful English."</p>

<p>"Russians usually do. My French is even better but that is
not the point. You are here, and before you go I should like to
ask you a question&mdash;one or two questions, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Why did you go to the Hobgoblin Club this night of all
nights in the year? What is your real name? And why does it
amuse you to have people take you for a low-down criminal like
Abel Martin?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I will imitate your candour," he said. "My name is Colin
Rooke. I am not what you think I am&mdash;a detective. I am a
journalist. But I like to look a little into life and my
greatest friend is a detective. I am interested in the search
which is giving him a great deal of worry just now&mdash;the
case of Edgar Chilston, the Pimlico murderer."</p>

<p>She was watching him intently now. Her eyes were dilated.
There was a vague look of trouble in them.</p>

<p>"My detective friend&mdash;no harm in telling you his
name&mdash;Inspector Seymour," he continued, "possesses one
scrap of paper from which we gathered that Chilston was to be
found at the Hobgoblin Club one night this week. I am one of the
few outsiders who can march into that most exclusive of West End
clubs. I went there to-night to see if I could see or hear
anything of him."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet&mdash;not too steadily&mdash;and, moving
to the sideboard, poured out a glass of water and drank it off.
She returned to her chair. Her expression had changed. The
uneasiness in her eyes had deepened, the insolence of her tone
had lessened.</p>

<p>"You got in, I suppose, because they took you for Abel
Martin?" she remarked.</p>

<p>"Of course," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Has it ever struck you that it is rather a dangerous thing
to do&mdash;to trade on your likeness to a criminal?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Danger," he replied, "comes to everyone. It comes just as
readily to those who do not seek it as to those who do."</p>

<p>She laughed hardly.</p>

<p>"You wanted to help your friend," she said. "You take no
count of the danger and you visit the Hobgoblin Club to look for
a murderer. Edgar Chilston may be in danger, but he is not in
such great danger as you at the present moment."</p>

<p>"I don't feel that way," he rejoined. "Through that
judiciously opened window of yours I can hear the buses and the
traffic of Shaftesbury Avenue. I can leave this room when I
choose, and to tell you the truth I am getting so sleepy that I
think it will be very soon. You need not disturb yourself. When
I am ready to go I am quite capable of handling your automatic
lift."</p>

<p>She was leaning a little forward, her chin resting upon the
fingers of one hand, her elbow upon the side of her chair.</p>

<p>"A little sleepy?" she queried.</p>

<p>"Very," he answered. "Your room is not too hot either. I
wonder whether the champagne was good?"</p>

<p>"Excellent," she assured him. "No need to blame the
champagne. But I will tell you something. You are sleepy now,
but when you get up you will be sleepier still. You will be
giddy. You won't be quite certain where you are going to put
your feet. Try "</p>

<p>He rose and stood looking down upon her with a smile, took a
cigarette from his ease and lit it. As she watched him the
distress in her eyes seemed to grow.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "I rather think that it may be you who
are going to feel that way. I never felt better in my life."</p>

<p>She held on with apparent bravery.</p>

<p>"You may think yourself clever," she sneered, "because you
had sense enough to change the glasses. You are really the
biggest fool that ever lived. I was inclined to give you a
chance. You have lost it. You had better sit still and wait for
what will surely happen to you."</p>

<p>Her head fell back. He picked up his hat and moved across to
the door. He tried the handle carelessly enough at first. A
gurgling chuckle from the chair reached him as he tried a second
time. He looked around. A distorted but mirthless smile was
parting her lips.</p>

<p>"Tell me how to open it," he begged. "It will be worth your
while if you do."</p>

<p>She shook her head and fell back in her chair. He stooped
down once more to examine the handle of the door, which answered
readily enough to his touch. The door, however, remained
immovable. There was a second shining slat of metal&mdash;a lock
over which he had no control. He drew back aghast. From outside
on the landing he heard the stopping of the automatic lift, the
closing of the gate, light, swift footsteps on the bare floor.
The footsteps ceased. There was the sound of a key being gently
inserted in the lock. The top latch moved back. There was again
the chink of metal and he could see that second bar of steel
slowly leaving its place. Soon it disappeared. The door was
being pushed open an inch at a time. That was one of the few
moments in his life when Colin Rooke was afraid.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SLOWLY and noiselessly the door was pushed open
and the figure of the intruder was revealed. At first glance
there seemed to be nothing alarming, nothing specifically
portentous, in his appearance. He was a man of middle height,
and Colin Rooke's first impression was that he was the most
immaculately attired person he had ever seen. His silk hat, worn
at exactly the right angle, was carefully brushed and shining.
The white handkerchief round his neck was tied with meticulous
exactitude and folded under the silk lapels of the black
overcoat. The patent shoes were merely a reflection of the
glossy perfection of the hat. The man's white kid gloves were
perfectly fitting. The fingers of one hand held a dark Malacca
cane, from the others a bunch of keys was dangling. The man was
of about Colin's height, but his eyes and complexion were
considerably darker. His mouth, too, was strangely different.
There might have been a suggestion of humour about it, but even
in repose it was bitterly cynical. It was the face of a man who
had lived in the hard places. He stared fixedly at Colin, but he
remained speechless.</p>

<p>"Am I by any chance an intruder here?" the latter asked.</p>

<p>The visitor answered him with a not disagreeable smile.</p>

<p>"It might seem so," he admitted, "considering that I own the
keys of the flat."</p>

<p>He swung them gently in front of him. Suddenly he seemed to
realise the presence of the woman lying back in the armchair,
her eyes closed, her head pendulous.</p>

<p>"What the mischief's happened to Belle?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He took a quick step forward and just as swiftly Colin sprang
towards the door. The newcomer checked himself, swung round and
closed it with a slam. Both latches clicked. To the lower one
there was no key.</p>

<p>"In a hurry to depart, my friend?" he asked mockingly. "There
will be plenty of time for you to make your adieux when I have
had a little chat with the young lady there."</p>

<p>Colin Rooke remained motionless. The other's apparent
harmlessness had no reassuring effect upon him. He was
desperately afraid.</p>

<p>"I am in no hurry," he declared.</p>

<p>The stranger was bending over the woman in the chair. He
lifted her eyelids and looked into the pupils of her eyes,
leaned closer down and smelt her breath. Then he turned round to
Colin.</p>

<p>"That's queer," he observed. "Her instructions were to bring
home any inquisitive stranger from the Hobgoblin Club and ensure
his remaining here for an hour or so. She seems to have prepared
a little loving-cup and drunk it herself."</p>

<p>"Entirely my fault," Colin acknowledged. "You see, I guessed
what she was up to and I changed the glasses."</p>

<p>The intruder laughed softly. His mouth relaxed. He had
absolutely the appearance of a man enjoying a good joke.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" he exclaimed. "What an amateurish blunder
for an old hand like Belle. Fancy her trying that sort of
thing&mdash;on a person of experience like you, too."</p>

<p>Colin shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"After all," he remarked, "I was rather looking for trouble.
I pick up the young lady at the Hobgoblin Club and she brings me
to a flat in Shaftesbury Avenue! You couldn't blame me for
keeping my eye on her."</p>

<p>"Of course not," the other assented. "But I do blame her for
thinking that she could hoodwink a person of your experience so
easily."</p>

<p>"What do you know about me?" Colin asked.</p>

<p>The man who had been carrying the keys slipped them into his
pocket. He leaned over to the table, took a cigarette from a
box, sniffed and lit it.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, the people at the Hobgoblin think you have had
plenty of experience," he said. "They believe that you are Abel
Martin."</p>

<p>"Aren't I?" Colin asked.</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head</p>

<p>"You are not," he affirmed tersely. "If you were, I shouldn't
have bothered. When they told me that Abel Martin had been
hanging around the place and had taken Belle home I thought I'd
better come along and look into things. I knew you were not Abel
Martin, so it became rather interesting to me to find out who
you were."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The unexpected visitor paused for a moment. He looked
steadily at the end of the cigarette, then he looked across at
his questioner, and Colin Rooke saw a new and menacing light in
his steely eyes.</p>

<p>"Because," he explained, "there are a good many people in
London to-night who are rather anxious to find me, and when I
hear of a man who has found his way into the one place where I
am usually safe the Hobgoblin Club&mdash;under a false identity,
and has made friends with the girl whom I allow people to think
is my property and set up as a puppet in my flat, and leaves the
place with her, then it becomes to me a matter of
curiosity&mdash;of more than curiosity, of necessity&mdash;to
find out who this man is who is so closely on my tracks. Do you
understand now, my friend? Who are you? Come over with it. If
you are from the Yard, you are a new hand. I know all the men
who are on my job, but you are not one of them. Are you a new
hand or some blundering amateur? A man doesn't throw himself
about at the Hobgoblin Club under a false name a night like this
for nothing. A pretty risky thing to do, you know. No wonder you
looked longingly at that door a minute or two ago."</p>

<p>"As to who I am," Colin said, "I scarcely see what business
it is of yours. I will tell you this, though. I am not a
detective. I have nothing whatever to do with the police."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good news so far," the other observed. "Why
then are you running the risk of masquerading as a well-known
criminal?"</p>

<p>"I could not have got into the Hobgoblin Club any other way,"
Colin confessed.</p>

<p>"And what did you want to get into the Hobgoblin Club
for?"</p>

<p>"I am a journalist," Colin confided. "My name is Colin
Rooke."</p>

<p>The other looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>"A journalist," he repeated. "I'm sorry to hear that."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I think that on the whole I dislike journalists
almost as much as I do detectives."</p>

<p>"Come along to the Press Club and have supper with me," Colin
invited. "I may be able to make you change your mind."</p>

<p>"I don't think you would," the visitor replied. "I don't
think you would take me to the Press Club to start with. You
wouldn't care about writing my name in the visitors' book."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Edgar Chilston."</p>

<p>"Edgar Chilston&mdash;the Pimlico murderer?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>From outside there still came the incessant roar of the
early-morning traffic. Inside the room there was a silence so
intense that both men were conscious of the heavy breathing of
the woman in the chair.</p>

<p>"Now you understand," the newcomer continued, "why I was
obliged to close that door a little hurriedly when I found you
so anxious to take your leave. You were hunting me at the
Hobgoblin Club. Why?"</p>

<p>"Before we deal in such home truths," Colin said, "I should
like to ask one question. There's a slight protuberance on the
right side of your hip?"</p>

<p>"A pertinent question," the murderer replied. "You shall
see."</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into the hip pocket of his trousers and
drew out a long black case. He opened it and held it out to
Colin.</p>

<p>"There," he sail. "You shall see one of the sights of the
world. Those are the diamonds of the Princess Dracopoli. For
those diamonds they say some seven or eight murders have already
been committed. I, Edgar Chilston, committed the latest one and
I have the jewels."</p>

<p>"I have never seen anything like them in my life," Colin
acknowledged in an almost awed undertone.</p>

<p>"That I can well understand," the other replied, as he
restored them to their place. "If you were not already on the
threshold of eternity, you would not have seen them now."</p>

<p>"A revolver in the other pocket, eh?"</p>

<p>Edgar Chilston smiled.</p>

<p>"I am rather tired of fire-arms," he confessed. "Old-fashioned
stuff. I'll permit you one more sensation during these last few
seconds. I will show you something really wonderful."</p>

<p>He measured with his eyes the distance between Colin and
himself, then he twirled for a moment his Malacca stick lightly
in his hand as though he were a drum major. Suddenly he flung
out his arm. Through the embossed gold head of the Malacca cane
there flashed an amazing length of blue steel&mdash;cruel-looking
steel, like living fire. Rooke started back with a
little cry. The point of the weapon, almost as fine as a needle,
had come to within half a foot of his neck. He stared at it
hypnotised. Edgar, Chilston pressed his forefinger upon the
ferrule. The sword flashed back again into its place and
disappeared with a click. The gold top closed upon it.</p>

<p>"Your life is mine at any moment, young man," he declared
calmly. "I am never in any hurry to proceed to extremes, though.
I only regret that a person so agreeable as you seem to be
should have put himself in such a situation. Tell me&mdash;you
are not a detective, you were not forced to take this terrible
risk&mdash;did you do it, then, for the sake of your
newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether," Colin replied. "It will be a magnificent
story for them at first hand, of course, and I shall look
forward to promotion, but I really did this to oblige my
greatest friend&mdash;Detective-Inspector Seymour."</p>

<p>"A pity you told me that," the murderer meditated. "Still,
since you have gone so far, tell me why a detective, who is
supposed to be as shrewd as the average Scotland Yard duds,
didn't work out his little scheme for himself?"</p>

<p>"I see no reason why I shouldn't tell you that," Colin Rooke
decided, glancing for a moment towards Belle's prostrate form.
"Seymour had an idea where you were for the last three days, but
he was afraid to move. He was afraid of your slipping through
his fingers."</p>

<p>Chilston nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Quite right," he admitted. "What I should have done. Not
only that, but he would never have seen the diamonds."</p>

<p>"Exactly what he realised," Colin went on. "He sent for me
because he knew that I was a member, through sheer accident, of
the Hobgoblin Club because of my likeness to Abel Martin. He
explained to me that if he moved a man to within a street or a
square of the Club, if he tried to plant anyone inside it, he
was certain to lose you. He has the utmost respect for your
present spy system."</p>

<p>"It is practically perfect," the murderer murmured. "Before I
entered the Club this evening I knew the name and history of
every member present. I had a gang of men patrolling the street
and, as I dare say you have heard, there is a private way out of
the Hobgoblin which I could have used, the secret of which is
known to no one on earth except myself."</p>

<p>"Just so," Colin agreed. "I was about the only person, with
my bogus membership in the place, who could afford him any
assistance. I offered to do it. I carried out my promise. I
waited about the place until twelve o'clock, I danced with this
young lady who I understand is only your reputed associate and I
brought her home to this flat. My part in the little drama is
finished. She made so clumsy an attempt to get rid of me that I
can scarcely believe she was in earnest. However, the warning
was enough. I was on the point of taking my leave when you
arrived."</p>

<p>"All quite clear," Edgar Chilston assented. "The time, alas,
arrives to break up this little conference. I trust you have
found these last few minutes pleasant? You have talked
confidentially with one of the most famous criminals of the
age&mdash;with Edgar Chilston himself&mdash;you have seen the
most wonderful jewels in existence, so you can never complain
that your last few minutes have been ill spent. The only thing I
cannot tell you is how I visited and left the Hobgoblin Club
undetected, or how, in a matter of thirty seconds, without
unfastening that door, I propose to leave these premises. Alas,
you will never know. Belle!"</p>

<p>The girl rose suddenly to her feet. From somewhere within the
folds of her loose dress she must have drawn the revolver
tightly clenched in her right hand. Edgar Chilston watched her
with a smile of approval.</p>

<p>"You will not suffer, Mr. Colin Rooke," he continued gently.
"Belle could hit a sixpence at a longer range than your heart at
the present moment. The time has arrived."</p>

<p>Colin Rooke saw death down the dark muzzle of the weapon held
in the girl's steady fingers. Then death passed. It swept in a
semicircle over those few feet to the right.</p>

<p>"Two nights of hiding, Edgar!" she cried, leaning towards
him, her eyes blazing, the wild passion of a tigress in her
drawn features, "and I know where you were! You are
right&mdash;the time has arrived"</p>

<p>Edgar Chilston was also right in his estimate of the girl's
prowess. The bullet passed through the middle of his heart. When
they opened his coat there was only one dark spot of blood to
mark the place. He died with only a single twitch.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE usual comfortable table in a quiet corner
of Rupert's Restaurant. The five Rooke legatees. Upraised
glasses. Once more Phillip Rooke proposed a happy continuance in
the life of adventure.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," Mrs. John Rooke grumbled as they
resumed their places. "You three men have had a very good turn.
Colin here publicly thanked by the police for his help in
tracking down a murderer. By the by, Colin, I haven't seen the
papers&mdash;I hope the girl got off?"</p>

<p>"She got off all right," Colin replied.</p>

<p>"Well, then there's Phillip here mixed up with a king's
famous jewel in a sealed casket, and Percy actually the
principal witness in a murder trial. That's what I call living a
life of adventure! What about Ann and me?"</p>

<p>"You wait till next month," Ann said significantly.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THERE was no doubt that prosperity, arrived
since the whim of an unknown relative had brought him his very
handsome legacy, agreed with Mr. Phillip Rooke. He had put on at
least a stone in weight, he had changed his tailor, to the
immense advantage of his figure, and he had allowed his
naturally cheerful disposition unlimited sway. At ten o'clock on
a dreary February morning he descended from the taxicab which
had brought him from his comfortable apartments in Half Moon
Street, entered his office in Cumberland Street and, with cheery
greetings to the members of his staff who were already
assembled, passed into his private office.</p>

<p>"Anything in the letters this morning, Miss Penfold?" he
asked of the young woman who had risen from her place before a
typewriter and followed him in.</p>

<p>"Nothing disturbing, Mr. Rooke," she replied. "Two more sales
for April or May, one of them quite a large one, I should think,
and one letter marked 'private' which, of course, I have not
opened. It is there, just on the right of the blotter."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke glanced away from the neatly arranged pile of
correspondence and looked suspiciously at the square blue
envelope addressed in scrawly handwriting to: <i>Mr. Phillip
Rooke, Auctioneer and Valuer, No. 9, Cumberland Street, W.C.</i>
He turned it over and looked at the flap.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, holding it up.</p>

<p>"A coronet," Miss Penfold replied.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of it?"</p>

<p>Miss Penfold smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p>"Something like a crest, only more so," she explained.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know that," was the somewhat irritated reply.
"What I mean is, who is writing me with a coronet on their
notepaper&mdash;'Strictly private' on the envelope, too?"</p>

<p>"Probably a lady who wants you to subscribe to some charity,"
Miss Penfold suggested.</p>

<p>He contented himself with a grunt and turned to the rest of
his correspondence. It was easily dealt with. He dictated
replies to one or two letters which Miss Penfold took down in
her usual competent fashion. Then he handed the little pile back
to her. His fingers toyed still with the blue envelope. Miss
Penfold, who was herself a little curious, realising that he did
not intend to open it until she had left, rose to her feet and
left the room.</p>

<p>A coronet&mdash;there was no doubt about that! A rather
impressive one, too, beautifully stamped on expensive notepaper.
There was a whiff of fragrance, the suggestion of a perfume
altogether strange to Phillip Rooke. Somehow or other the letter
suggested just that spice of romance of which his life was badly
in need. He would have preferred to have carried it about with
him, for a portion of the day at any rate, feeling always that
he had something interesting in store. Even when his common
sense prevailed, and he slit the envelope, it was with some
reluctance that he drew out its contents. It was dated from an
address in Brooke Street and posted on the previous
evening.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Rooke</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I am a stranger to you, but I am nevertheless
about to ask a favour. It is that you will grant me a brief
interview to-morrow morning. In the hope that you will be so
kind, I shall present myself at your office in Cumberland Street
at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Olga Pretsinoff</span></p>

<br>

<p>Phillip Rooke touched a button on his desk.</p>

<p>"Miss Penfold," he asked, as his secretary entered the room,
"can you make anything of this? Do I know anything of the
lady?"</p>

<p>He handed her the letter. Miss Penfold read it through and
frowned slightly as she returned it.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "you have no business acquaintance of that
name, at any rate."</p>

<p>Mr. Phillip Rooke, for whom the day had started so cheerfully
and well, felt himself suddenly irritable.</p>

<p>"Then what the devil does she want to see me for?" he
demanded. "What is that 'P.I.A.' in brackets by the side of her
name?"</p>

<p>"That means that she is a princess&mdash;the Princess Olga
Pretsinoff," Miss Penfold confided.</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke positively scowled.</p>

<p>"What could I have to do with a princess?" he scoffed. "You
had better see her for me, Miss Penfold."</p>

<p>"I don't think," the latter answered dryly, "that that would
suit the lady's purpose."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke looked at the clock and grunted.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," he muttered, "show her in when she
comes."</p>

<p>So for twenty minutes Phillip Rooke was left alone with the
hastily scrawled note at his elbow. It was a message which
brought to him the faint incessant perfume of musk-rose, a queer
flavour of romance&mdash;a letter in a blue envelope...</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was several seconds after her announcement
and entrance that Phillip Rooke recovered himself sufficiently
to indicate with an hospitable gesture, and a muttered word of
invitation to his visitor, a chair adjacent to his desk. His
impression of princesses had been acquired from the few Society
novels he had read and the Sunday newspapers. He had expected
something flamboyant, lurid and dangerous. He saw only a very
quietly dressed girl, very pale, with beautiful rather appealing
eyes of no particular colour. Her walk was unlike anything he
had ever seen, her faint, sad smile as she sank into her chair
seemed to be making a first-aid appeal to his charitable sense,
and her voice, notwithstanding its foreign accent, seemed to him
subtly pathetic.</p>

<p>"You are surprised that I come to see you yes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't remember ever having made your acquaintance,
Princess," he replied guardedly.</p>

<p>"We have never met before," the young woman acknowledged.
"Nevertheless, Mr. Rooke, you are in a position to do me a great
favour."</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke coughed, and listened. It seemed to him to be
safest.</p>

<p>"You have been one of those very much favoured by fortune,"
she continued. "I read about you in the newspapers. You are one
of the Rooke legatees. You were a poor man, and then an unknown
relative leaves you a fortune. You become &mdash;is it a good
word?&mdash;opulent."</p>

<p>"Well?" Phillip Rooke queried in wholly noncommittal
fashion.</p>

<p>"I have been as unfortunate as you have been fortunate," the
Princess continued. "You would not believe it, because I am
wearing a Worth gown and a hat from Ozanne. Mr. Rooke, I am in
despair."</p>

<p>"Taking that for granted," Phillip Rooke remarked with what
he considered courageous brutality, "how am I interested?"</p>

<p>She looked steadily across at him and for the first time he
made up his mind as to the colour of her eyes. They were a deep,
rich, sea-green hazel. They went strangely with her
complexion&mdash;she might have been a mermaid sitting in his
chair of consultation. His eyes travelled down to her bottines
and he was reassured. Incidentally it occurred to him that her
pearl-grey stockings were exactly the right shade to blend with
her skirt.</p>

<p>"I come to you," she said quietly, "because circumstances
have directed it. I was glad, because I realised that a man of
good heart, such as you must be, could not fail to remember,
when I made my request, that chance had brought him a great
stroke of fortune. You see," she went on, as though appreciating
his puzzled gaze, "it was a perfect stranger who befriended you.
Therefore, I say, why should you not befriend another perfect
stranger?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's queer reasoning," Mr. Rooke observed. "What is it
you want&mdash; money?"</p>

<p>From the first he had disliked his role of "man-of-the-world"
cynicism. Now he hated it and himself. She answered him so
quietly and yet he thought with apparent pain.</p>

<p>"I chose you, Mr. Rooke," she explained, "not only because
you have enjoyed an unexpected stroke of fortune, but also
because you have charge of a small sale within the next few days
at which there are to be disposed of the letters and the scraps
of music left by Louis Mambr&eacute;, the mad Montmartre fiddler, as he
was called up to the day of his death."</p>

<p>"I have a small sale of the effects of a man called Mambr&eacute; on
Thursday," Phillip Rooke confessed "I don't see how that can
possibly affect you."</p>

<p>"How should you?" she murmured. "I am not to imagine, Mr.
Rooke, that you have been blessed with the gift of inspiration.
You could not possibly know. I do not wish to interfere with
your disposal of poor Louis's effects. I have nothing to say
about his property&mdash;his violin which was accounted
priceless, or even any letters which he may have kept from the
women who worshipped him&mdash; but there is one thing he left
behind which I must have. I have come to you to help me."</p>

<p>"Look here," Phillip Rooke observed suspiciously, "I have
been up against this sort of thing before. A very difficult
position I found myself in. Is there another box amongst
Mambr&eacute;'s effects with a necklace of emeralds or anything of that
sort? If so, I must tell you frankly, Princess, that it is going
to be sold for what it is worth. The man left scarcely enough to
pay for his funeral expenses and I am selling the few oddments
in his rooms simply to oblige the lawyer."</p>

<p>"It is not a box, nor is it jewels which I ask," she told
him. "It is just a fragment of music."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well, I will explain. One of the lots consists of
unpublished sheets and scores of music he composed and never
finished. Some of them have little merit &mdash;the whole lot
might go probably for a few shillings. But there is one
fragment&mdash;it is a pencilled score, it is not even properly
annotated. It was to have formed the principal theme of a modern
opera, but he died. I want that scrap of music."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Because it was written," she confided, "when he was my
lover. It was written when we spent what was almost the working
man and woman's Sunday in a caf&eacute; on the banks of the Seine not a
dozen miles from Paris. It was a noisy, blatant place, but night
came and a soft rain, and people went away and we were left
alone in an arbour, and there was just the slanting rain and the
patter on the river, a faint row of lights and the sighing of
the water as it passed almost at our feet. The lamp had burned
out; we had borrowed a candle; he sat there humming to himself
and sometimes he took up the violin&mdash;he was never parted
from it&mdash;and he struck a chord or two. Well, there it was.
A scrap of music, and he wrote my name upon it and he carried it
back to Paris. I was ill at the time, Mr. Rooke, and I was taken
worse on the next day. They sent me to hospital, and when I
recovered he had gone to London. Then I read of his death in the
paper. I come here just to claim what belongs to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke was troubled. His affected cynicism had gone. A
kindly common sense had taken its place.</p>

<p>"But, Princess," he expostulated, "the settlement of his
affairs has nothing to do with me. I have to sell what is handed
over to me."</p>

<p>"I know," she admitted. "I should not have come to you, but I
have been to the others in vain. They would not listen to me.
The odd lots of music must be sold, the lawyer told me,
according to instructions. A greedy widow, long since forgotten,
living in Bayonne, has willed it thus."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke considered the matter. During the brief
interval of silence his eyes lingered not coldly but
appraisingly upon his visitor. He became conscious that his
attitude of mind towards her was slowly changing. He forgot that
she was a princess. The glamour of her name and the charm of her
presence faded into the background. She was a waif of humanity,
passionately anxious to cling to this scrap of music which had
been written for her by her lover on an unforgettable night.
Phillip Rooke was no longer a licensed seller of unconsidered
trifles, always ready to exchange a jest with his little
gathering of patrons. He was a simple, kindly man, and he made
up his mind that this pale-faced, hollow-eyed woman should have
her scrap of music.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he reflected, "that it would have been
simpler, since you set so much store by those two or three bars,
Princess, if you had kept them instead of letting him take them
away."</p>

<p>"I wish that I had done so," she sighed. "Louis took them
because he wanted the prelude. The bars he had written were to
be the soul of his opera. He was terribly afraid that even a
single phrase might slip from his memory and that he might never
recapture it. He took it away. It was to be for such a short
time. And then he fell ill."</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," he suggested, "the simplest way would be for you to
buy the whole bag of tricks. I don't suppose there is a great
deal of music, and I don't suppose there would be much
bidding."</p>

<p>"I would pay for the portfolio every penny I had in the
world," she said earnestly, "but that is very little. What I am
afraid of is that someone will get to know that there is a
treasure in that portfolio and will bid against me. They would
offer more money than I possess and then my melody, his last
gift to me, would be gone forever."</p>

<p>"I will help you out there," Mr. Rooke said. "I have had to
sell unfinished pictures and unfinished novels and unfinished
scores of music in my time. They don't fetch much, you know,
Princess. How much money can you afford to pay?"</p>

<p>"I have only ten pounds," she confided.</p>

<p>"I should think you could probably buy the lot for ten
shillings," he told her, "but I will go up to one hundred pounds
for you if it is necessary. What about that?"</p>

<p>"It is very generous," she admitted, and there was gratitude
shining out of those strange eyes of hers and the rigidity of
her face had lessened, yet there was also fear there. "It is
very generous of you, Mr. Rooke," she repeated, "but I must tell
you something. When Louis was in the hospital he was for days in
a delirium. There were times when he used to hum or croon
strange pieces of music, and I think he must have hummed my
melody."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"The nurse wrote me that his agent used to listen to him
every now and then entranced. Once he brought two other friends
with him to listen. One was a Jew named Usher who had already
bought some of Louis's songs. The nurse told me that she heard
them whispering together. The man Usher was trembling with
excitement. 'Where did he get that refrain from?' Usher
demanded. 'It is to be the theme of an opera,' the agent told
him. 'I will buy it,' Usher declared. 'I will pay him his own
price.' The nurse told me more. She said that when Louis hummed
this one tune people used to stop in the corridor outside to
listen; the other patients within hearing, however ill they
were, seemed to forget everything. Even the doctors paused and
asked afterwards who he was. No one who ever heard it seemed to
be able to recapture it, and yet no one who ever heard it forgot
it. This man Usher is very rich. He is a common man, but he
knows about music. I am afraid that he will come to the
sale."</p>

<p>"That certainly complicates matters," Rooke meditated. "One
moment, Princess."</p>

<p>He rang his bell. Miss Penfold came demurely in. It was
obvious that the length of the interview had incited her
disapproval.</p>

<p>"Miss Penfold," her employer asked her, "we have a small sale
in a few days &mdash;the effects of a Louis Mambr&eacute;, who died in
hospital. The things from his lodgings were sent here by the
lawyer."</p>

<p>"The sale is Thursday, Mr. Rooke," she told him.</p>

<p>"And when is view day?"</p>

<p>"The day before&mdash;Wednesday. We had a letter from Ushers,
the music publishers, asking if they could inspect the odd
scores of music before that date. The letter is on your desk,
waiting for attention."</p>

<p>"It can wait," Phillip Rooke replied. "That will do, Miss
Penfold."</p>

<p>The secretary took her leave. The Princess's face seemed
whiter than ever. Her lips were trembling.</p>

<p>"You see," she said as soon as the door was closed, "this man
Usher has heard the melody. He will be here to try and buy the
manuscript."</p>

<p>"No need to worry yet, Princess," Rooke assured her
cheerfully; "come right along with me this way."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, opened another door, led the way into a
large warehouse and called to a porter.</p>

<p>"Where, William," he asked, "are the effects of Louis Mambr&eacute;,
for sale on Thursday?"</p>

<p>"On the second floor, sir," the man replied. "A miserable lot
of stuff. Mr. Harrison thought we had better put them in at the
end of Thursday's sale."</p>

<p>"Come and show them to us," his employer directed.</p>

<p>They mounted the stairs. They were led towards a motley heap
of what was frankly little better than rubbish lying in a remote
corner of the warehouse. There were a few chairs, a miserable
collection of old clothes and ragged books, and a portfolio of
music tied up with string. The Princess stooped down and took up
from the floor a cheap photograph frame. She held it out towards
her companion.</p>

<p>"You see that I tell the truth," she said. "That is my
picture. He carried it everywhere."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke took it into his hand. There was no mistaking
its identity, although between the picture of the happy child
who smiled at him from behind the cracked glass and the woman
who held the frame dumbly towards him there was a bridge of
tragedy.</p>

<p>"I never doubted your word, Princess," Rooke assured her
quietly. "William," he said to the man, "take that portfolio to
the table and unfasten the cords."</p>

<p>He felt her fingers for a moment as she grasped at his hands
for support. They were icily cold. Her eyes, however, still
remained empty of tears. The moment the cords were undone she
fell upon the shabby portfolio. It was filled with a great pile
of scraps of manuscript music, here and there written on
prepared sheets, here and there on paper across which an
unsteady hand had drawn the bars, fashioned grotesque emblems of
treble and bass, and covered pages with what seemed to Phillip
Rooke a chaos of fantastically-shaped notes. The Princess had
lost her calm. She was leaning over the table, her fingers
tearing at the loose sheets. One by one they were rejected with
scarcely a glance, then she paused and a low cry, a cry that was
like a sob, broke from her lips. With both hands she was
gripping a single crumpled page.</p>

<p>"Is that the score?" Phillip Rooke asked.</p>

<p>She made no reply. She had passed into a different world. Her
head went slowly back, her lips opened, music came floating out
from her&mdash;strangely delivered music, sometimes a French
word, sometimes a low croon, but there was melody, strange, sad,
almost biting melody, sorrows that clawed their way into the
heart and made the eyes hot with tears, and then some quality of
resignation, some apprehension of coming relief, something that
brought tranquillity; gentle music which seemed to sponge out
misery and bring back colour and life and light-heartedness to
the world. One felt the sun burning its way through the storm
clouds. The, reassuring laughter, the twin fairies gaiety and
hope, and then, once more, strangely mingled this time with the
transformed melody, there came back reminiscent, notes of that
first air, exquisitely plaintive, aching with melody.</p>

<p>Close by William, the warehouseman, was standing with mouth
open, dumb-stricken. He found himself trying to think of the
days when he was a child in the fields sprinkled with daisies
and buttercups, himself lying in the quaker grass listening to
the passing of the river, smelling the new-mown hay. Phillip
Rooke felt the rush of a new promise into life. Old ambitions
reshaped themselves, old desires seemed reborn. All the
clumsiness and day-by-day squalor of life had fallen away.
Everything in the world was pointing upwards. He caught hold of
that stray sheet, rolled it up and placed it in her hands.</p>

<p>"I am to take this?" she asked, a sudden flame is her eyes.
"And if there is trouble?"</p>

<p>"My shoulders from now an are the broadest is the world."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT ten o'clock on the following morning a
portly and well-attired gentleman, accompanied by a young woman
carrying a violin-case and a young man whose long hair, soft hat
and flowing cravat flamboyantly proclaimed his profession,
presented themselves at the sale-rooms of Mr. Phillip Rooke and
asked to be conducted to where the effects of the late Louis
Mambr&eacute; were to be found. They were conducted to the second
floor, where they fell rabidly upon that worn portfolio and
commenced their all-day search. At four o'clock Miss Penfold
made her way to her employer's sanctum.</p>

<p>"A Mr. Usher insists upon seeing you, sir," she announced.
"He has been here since ten o'clock this morning poking about in
the sale-rooms."</p>

<p>"Dear me," Mr. Rooke replied with a surprise which was more
apparent than real. "Whatever did he find to interest him all
this time?"</p>

<p>Miss Penfold made no comment. She profoundly disapproved of
her employer's present attitude, but nothing could break through
her loyalty. She ushered in the visitor, who was neither so
sleek nor so eager nor so neat as when he had presented himself
on the premises at a few minutes past ten. Perhaps the fact that
his lunch had only consisted of a couple of sandwiches and a
bottle of beer brought in from a neighbouring public-house
accounted to some extent for his disturbed state.</p>

<p>"Mr. Usher?" the auctioneer enquired genially.</p>

<p>"That is my name, sir," was the somewhat curt reply. "I have
a serious matter to discuss with you."</p>

<p>"Take a seat," the other invited.</p>

<p>Mr. Usher accepted the invitation. Even in his confessed
state of fatigue and agitation he did not forget to find a safe
resting-place for his once carefully brushed hat. He leaned
forward towards the auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rooke," he said. "To-morrow you are advertising for sale
the effects of a man named Louis Mambr&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Such effects as they are," was the smiling acknowledgment.
"From what I have seen of them they might have been sent to a
second-hand junk shop."</p>

<p>"That shows you don't know what you are talking about," Mr.
Usher snapped. "Mambr&eacute; died a pauper, to all appearances, but he
was a genius, sir&mdash;that man was a genius. If he had lived
to be our age, he would have been one of the greatest musicians
in the world."</p>

<p>"What kept him back?" Phillip Rooke enquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Usher frowned. In a way that was a most unfortunate
question.</p>

<p>"Poverty," he replied. "He never quite made a hit, and so
however generously people felt towards him it was impossible for
them to pay him very much for his productions."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was why he died in poverty, was it?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. To-morrow you are going to dispose of a lot of
unfinished stuff that he wrote at various times. I don't suppose
they will fetch a ten-pound note, but I have something serious
to say to you. There was one score which should have brought him
in real money, and that score is missing."</p>

<p>"Where do I come in?" Mr. Rooke asked.</p>

<p>"Now I will tell you," his visitor said, drawing his chair a
little nearer to the table and extending his podgy hands. "Louis
Mambr&eacute;'s agent visited him in hospital, a very kindly action,
and from what he told me, I too went to see the poor
fellow."</p>

<p>"The action of a true Samaritan," Phillip Rooke declared
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"He was in delirium most of the time," Mr. Usher went on,
unheeding, "always singing and humming to himself, and in the
midst of it all&mdash;I know, because there is nothing about the
trade side of music that can get by me&mdash; that man, Mr.
Rooke, hummed or crooned or sang, whichever you like, not more
than a dozen bars perhaps of the most marvellous melody man ever
placed upon a score. I tell you it was worth a fortune. It was
glorious. It got you right in the place music tries to get you.
If it had been played once in a London theatre, there isn't an
errand-boy in the streets, not a clerk upon a bus, who wouldn't
have been whistling it as he went upon his way. What do you
think of that, Mr. Rooke?"</p>

<p>"I call it damned interesting," Phillip Rooke confessed.</p>

<p>"I got his agent on one side," Usher went on, "and I showed
him a few bank-notes I generally carry round with me. 'Attwood,'
I said, 'your job is not to leave this hospital until Louis
recovers. Get an illness yourself&mdash;anything you
like&mdash;I don't care; I'll pay your expenses. Your job is not
to leave Louis until you have got the rest of that music out of
him. There is a fortune for the three of us there, and I will do
the square thing by everybody.'"</p>

<p>"Very generous of you," Mr. Rooke remarked.</p>

<p>"Attwood did his job. I am not blaming him," Usher went on,
moistening his red lips, "but in two days Louis was dead. All
that Attwood could get out of him in his last moments was that
he had written that music in Paris whilst he was in the company
of some woman or other, and that the score was in his portfolio
at his lodgings. He had brought it over to play to me when he
was taken ill."</p>

<p>"Well, your agent seems to have done his job by finding that
out," Mr. Rooke observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, but this is where you come in, sir," Usher proceeded,
with an unpleasant note in his voice. "We have been all the
morning, me with a violinist and a technical musician, going
through that portfolio of Louis's and the score isn't
there."</p>

<p>"What rotten luck," Mr. Rooke said sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Rotten fiddlesticks!" the other exclaimed. "The score has
been stolen."</p>

<p>"Dear me."</p>

<p>"Not only that, but we have found out that the young woman he
was with the night he wrote it a highfalutin young person, but a
bit of a musician herself&mdash; is in London at the present
moment. She has nabbed it. How did she manage that, Mr.
Rooke?"</p>

<p>"How on earth should I know?" the auctioneer asked.</p>

<p>"But do you know? That is what we are here to find out," Mr.
Usher declared truculently. "Ten o'clock this morning was
advertised as the earliest time the goods could have been
inspected. I have had it out with the lawyer. There was a seal
on the door of Louis's rooms which was broken by the lawyer's
own messenger. The things were brought here on a small trolley
in charge of the clerk and deposited in your upstairs room. Now,
what have you got to say, Mr. Rooke?"</p>

<p>"What is there to say," was the gravely puzzled rejoinder.
"Ten o'clock was the earliest hour, and you were the first
visitor."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," Mr. Usher exclaimed
belligerently. "I insist upon seeing the foreman who is in
charge of that room."</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke rang the bell and gave a message. William, in his
green apron and with tousled hair, made his appearance. He was
still in a detached state, with a sort of feeling inside him
that he wanted to get away into the country and smell the
honeysuckle and hay, and the sweetness of the meadows, and he
had taken a particular dislike to Mr. Usher.</p>

<p>"William," his employer told him, "this gentleman is very
interested in the scraps of manuscript which I understand were
in a portfolio with the Louis Mambre effects."</p>

<p>"I should say he were interested," William replied roughly.
"He's been poking about amongst them since opening time."</p>

<p>"A piece of music which he expected to find there is
missing," Mr. Rooke confided. "Has anyone else inspected that
portfolio, William?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul ain't been near it," was the emphatic
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that no one has been in at any other time to
ask to inspect the portfolio?" Mr. Usher enquired, a little
dashed.</p>

<p>"Not a soul ain't been near the place," William repeated. "I
know, because I come at opening time; I bring my breakfast and
dinner with me, and I lock up when I go. You are the first and
only one who has looked through them scrawls, and if the
gentleman wouldn't mind me saying so," William continued,
turning to his employer, "we had a horrid morning of it, what
with the girl with the fiddle playing scraps which sounded like
the moaning of a cat, and the gentleman with the long hair
hooting things. If them were the sort of noises they came after,
it seems to me a good thing they didn't find them."</p>

<p>Mr. Rooke waved him away.</p>

<p>"Well, there you are, Mr. Usher," he said. "Anything else I
can do for you?"</p>

<p>There was nothing else which Mr. Rooke could do for Mr.
Usher. The latter took his surly departure. Mr. Phillip Rooke
went out and had a drink.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT was one of the regular dinner gatherings of
the Rooke legatees, and everyone was very merry and gay.
Everyone, too, was wrapped in sympathetic admiration of the
beautiful, sad little stranger whom Phillip Rooke, their
chairman for the evening, had introduced to the gathering. It
was after the third round of the champagne that Phillip Rooke,
who was looking extremely happy but somewhat subdued, tapped
lightly on the tablecloth with his forefinger, and leaned over
to address his fellow members of this unique club.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said. "Mrs. John, Miss Ann, Mr. Colin, and
Mr. Percy, since we were brought together by that wonderful
stroke of fortune which entitled us to be described as the Rooke
legatees, one or two of us have been favoured in our day-by-day
life with adventures of various sorts. To-night I am in the
happy position of being able to tell you that I too have met
adventure such as I never dreamed of. My guest of this evening
is going to be sweet enough to tell you, in a few words, the
somewhat, curious happening which enabled me to render her some
slight service."</p>

<p>The Princess smiled pleasantly, but a little sadly, upon them
all. The wine of which she had drunk sparingly had brought no
colour to her cheeks. Her eyes remained that negative shade of
hazel, yet the lines of her face were becoming, hour by hour,
more relaxed. Mr. Phillip Rooke had already christened her the
Murillo Madonna.</p>

<p>"My host this evening," she said, "has done me such a great
service that it is a joy to me to confide in you others, his
friends, how glad he has made me. It is a simple story and you
need to give me your attention for only five minutes."</p>

<p>In less than five minutes the story was told, and very well
told. Colin alone assumed an air of mock severity.</p>

<p>"In cold blood, my cousin Phillip," he said, "you told that
admirable Mr. Usher a deliberate&mdash;a real whopper!"</p>

<p>"A deliberate falsehood," Mr. Phillip Rooke confessed. "Not
only that, but I found my man William and my whole staff acting
and trying to tell the same whopper."</p>

<p>"And the melody?" Ann, the sentimentalist, asked softly.</p>

<p>"Someday, it is my earnest prayer," the Princess said, "that
you will all hear it. Thanks to Mr. Phillip I possess the one
exquisite air which goes through the whole opera and in the
portfolio which he generously bought for me I have found some of
the finger-posts. You do not know, perhaps, that I have a
position in a small orchestra and play four times a week at
private houses. I keep myself now and work all the time. Someday
I shall finish the opera. You will all come and hear
it&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>There was not the least doubt about the willingness of
everybody, and when the party broke up, under the portico of her
temporary home, she laid her hands upon Phillip's shoulders and
lightly and sweetly she kissed him upon the cheeks.</p>

<p>"When that time of success comes, you will forget?" he asked
fervently.</p>

<p>"I shall remember always and I shall listen to whatever you
have to ask," she promised.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">A FORTUITOUS meeting in the Strand, opposite
the attractive entrance to the Milan, led to Phillip Rooke's
hospitable invitation.</p>

<p>"What about a spot of lunch, Colin?"</p>

<p>The younger man hesitated.</p>

<p>"I half promised to turn up at the Club."</p>

<p>His uncle took him by the arm. The rest followed as a matter
of course. In two minutes they were drinking Dry Martinis in the
grillroom lounge.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you, young fellow?" the prospective host
demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>Colin accepted a cigarette gloomily.</p>

<p>"It's Ann," he confided.</p>

<p>"What about her?"</p>

<p>"She won't marry me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Phillip Rooke demanded. "She hasn't
refused you?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly that. She simply won't decide anything. She
won't even let me announce that we are engaged."</p>

<p>"Give any reason&mdash;Is there anyone else do you
think?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Colin acknowledged. "Seems to me the
trouble with her is that she has got this sort of craving for
adventure into her blood. I was foolish enough to introduce her
to Deanes Seymour one day, and he told her about the unofficial
staff of young women they employ sometimes. She is aching to
take something of that sort on."</p>

<p>"Well, it wouldn't do her any harm, would it?" Phillip
queried.</p>

<p>"Not if she were content with the small things," Colin
agreed, "but she isn't. They wanted a few unofficial people to
mix with the crowds in some of the big stores. Ann wouldn't take
that on. She's crazy about this kidnapping business and this
last affair, Lady May Chester's daughter, you know, made her
furious. If she gets mixed up in an affair of that sort there is
no telling what might not happen. I had a narrow shave myself as
you know, just through making a few enquiries in a place Seymour
can't visit himself."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke paid for the cocktails and led his nephew into
the grillroom.</p>

<p>"I should talk plainly to your pal Seymour, if I were you,
Colin," he suggested. "I don't think they ought to let an
amateur go meddling in a serious job like that."</p>

<p>"You would think not," Colin agreed. "All the same, they are
pretty unscrupulous, these fellows, when they see a chance of
real outside help.... Good God!"</p>

<p>Colin half rose to his feet. There was something distinctly
alarming in his expression. His uncle caught hold of his wrist
and forced him back into his chair.</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass; Colin," he said firmly. "What's the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>Colin's face was dark with anger. He made an effort at
self-restraint, however.</p>

<p>"Ann! Over there," he indicated with a little movement of the
head, "sitting in the corner with that dirty blackguard from the
Hobgoblin Club."</p>

<p>Phillip Rooke returned Ann's pleasant but rather startled
salute and permitted himself a glance at her companion.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't have to be jealous of a fellow like that,
Colin," he remarked.</p>

<p>The young man was still furiously angry.</p>

<p>"But I object to Ann being seen about with such a person at
all," he declared warmly.</p>

<p>"Do you know who he is?"</p>

<p>"I know quite enough," was the angry reply. "He is a sort of
tout of the Hobgoblin Club. He is better dressed now than when I
saw him last, but there is no mistaking the fellow."</p>

<p>"You don't know his name, then?"</p>

<p>"It won't be long before I do. Waiter, get me a chasseur, a
sheet of notepaper and an envelope."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Of course," his companion observed, "I can't help your
making any sort of an ass of yourself, Colin, but do remember
that you are my guest. I don't want to be involved in any silly
business."</p>

<p>"I want to know that fellow's name," Colin said sullenly.</p>

<p>"You don't need to get up from the table for that," his uncle
replied. "I will tell it you now. It's Regnier&mdash;Sir Walter
Regnier."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" Colin exclaimed. "You're right. I've
seen the fellow's pictures in the paper."</p>

<p>"Anyway, that lets Ann out," Phillip Rooke insisted. "There
are very few girls would refuse a luncheon with Walter
Regnier."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," the young man protested. "He's a bad
lot."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," Phillip agreed. "On the other hand he is a
millionaire; and although he may be a sort of degenerate he
comes from a good family, and he has never actually been in
trouble."</p>

<p>"He is looking for it now," the other rejoined.</p>

<p>The ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, who sensed trouble at the table, filled
their glasses with wine. Phillip caught Ann's eye and raised his
glass; Colin perforce followed suit. Ann waved her hand.</p>

<p>"Keep anything you have to say to Ann until you see her
alone," Phillip begged.</p>

<p>But Colin made no promise.</p>

<p>Regnier smiled as he watched the interchange of civilities.
It was scarcely a pleasant smile, but then the man's expression
scarcely lent itself to such amenities.</p>

<p>"A disappointed suitor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not so much disappointed," Ann replied coldly. "He is a
distant cousin whom I shall probably marry one day."</p>

<p>"If that is the case you had better give him a word of good
advice," her host said.</p>

<p>"What sort of advice?"</p>

<p>"Tell him to stick to his journalism and stop playing amateur
sleuth. He very nearly got into serious trouble the other
night."</p>

<p>"How do you know about that?" Ann asked.</p>

<p>"Because I am one of those, too, for whom crime has a sort of
inordinate fascination," he told her. "I am all the time
hovering on the outskirts of it. The only difference between
your young cousin and myself is that whereas his sympathies seem
usually to be with the police, mine are generally with the
criminal."</p>

<p>Ann, despite herself, was fascinated.</p>

<p>"How can you say such things?" she exclaimed. "Because I feel
them," he answered coolly. "I haven't the reputation of a saint,
as you would find out if you knew much about me."</p>

<p>"I can see quite clearly," Ann declared, "that I ought not to
have lunched with you."</p>

<p>He looked at her quizzingly, with a little contraction of the
lines at the sides of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course you ought not," he agreed. "It isn't good for any
girl's reputation to be seen with me. You happen to be an
independent young woman though, brought up in the ways of
respectability, and you wanted to see what one of the real black
sheep was like."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't succeeded, have I?" she asked
good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"Well, you are scarcely likely to in the grillroom of the
Milan," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Where do you suggest then would be a more suitable place for
you to talk to me about crime with the lid off?"</p>

<p>She shivered a little as she met his full gaze. He was a man
of sallow complexion and with curiously set, extremely bright
dark eyes&mdash;eyes empty of any manner of humanity or
kindness, but brilliant with intelligence. The deeply engraven
lines of his face, with the exception of the telltale droop from
the upper lips, were not necessarily the lines of dissipation.
It was a worn, almost tired face, but it might well have been
the face of a man in whom the fires of life still burned
intensely.</p>

<p>"<i>Chez-vous ou chez-moi?</i>" he quoted. "That is to say,
in your I am sure very ladylike apartments or at a certain
famous club of which I am a member and which, according to some
people, is a very hotbed of sin, the Hobgoblin?"</p>

<p>"I love the name," she observed, "and I wouldn't dare to ask
you to my rooms."</p>

<p>"Then you must dine with me at the Hobgoblin Club," he
invited. "You won't find the telephone number in the book, and
the Club itself is in a backwater between Soho and Regent
Street. Nice people do not go there. There is no printed book of
members. It is a haunt of criminals of every description. It is
the only club in London that I know of which has private rooms.
You can scarcely be seen entering or leaving the place without
losing your reputation."</p>

<p>"Shall we say half-past eight next Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"That would suit me admirably," he replied, making a small
note in the diary which he had drawn out of his waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>"Shall I meet any other criminals?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I shall keep you entirely to myself," he assured her.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch and paid the bill.</p>

<p>"I regret to say that I must now leave you," he went on. "You
will permit me to escort you to the door? I have to see the five
o'clock race at Sandown. I have a mare running there whose form
I have kept secret from the bookies and the public. She's being
ridden by a jockey who has been in prison twice and will find
himself there again if he fails to win this race. She will start
at twenty to one, and if you promise not to put more than ten
pounds on I will tell you her name."</p>

<p>"I promise," Ann agreed.</p>

<p>"'The Comet,'" he told her, as they rose to their feet. "You
will forgive my hurrying?"</p>

<p>"You can leave me at the table with my relatives if you
will," she begged.</p>

<p>A few yards from the table she nodded her farewell. Regnier
accepted the hint and without waiting for introductions passed
on towards the door.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR Deanes Seymour faced a very indignant
young man later that afternoon when Colin was shown into his
private room at Scotland Yard. The interview led to what
practically amounted to an ultimatum. The inspector closed it in
somewhat summary fashion.</p>

<p>"Look here, Rooke," he said. "If you weren't a pal you would
have been in the street before now. Listen to reason if you can.
It is true that you have introduced me to Miss Ann Rooke. Some
three weeks after that introduction she came here and asked for
amateur employment. I had no opening and told her so. Last week
she came again. By the merest chance she seems to have stumbled
against something that might turn out to be a clue in the
Chester case."</p>

<p>"She never told me that," Colin muttered.</p>

<p>"She would have been a fool if she had," was the composed
reply. "The clue was a very difficult one for us to handle. I
will tell you as much as that. She proposed her own scheme and
it was a damned good one. I am doing as much to save her running
into any sort of danger as I should if it were one of the Royal
family under my charge, but I have got to make use of what she
brought me and in my own way. Remember what I have just told
you, Rooke. She is a clever girl and a brave one, and if she can
bring this thing off there would be millions of people in the
country who would be grateful to her. I'll protect her, Rooke,
if it costs me my job. I can't say more."</p>

<p>"You can't let me in on it?" Colin begged wistfully.</p>

<p>"There's no place for you, old chap," Seymour assured him.
"Remember, the odds are that nothing will happen at all. If the
best happens you will be a proud man, even if only we three ever
know about it, and the worst is not worth thinking about. I'll
look after that."</p>

<p>Colin held out his hand.</p>

<p>"You can't say more, Seymour," he admitted. "I don't mind
telling you that she's forbidden me to go near her for a
week."</p>

<p>"And at the end of that week," his friend said, with an
encouraging smile, "she will probably give you your reward."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ANN paused to take breath as the sliding doors,
which had opened with almost miraculous swiftness before her,
revealed an utterly unsuspected prospect. She had passed through
a shabby anteroom, along a short, dimly-lit passage into what
seemed to be the very heart of luxury. Her feet sank into a
thick Oriental carpet, the modern lighting effects of the place
revealed dark green walls on which were sketches and wonderful
paintings in the most chic French style. The heavy curtains at
the farther end permitted glimpses of a still larger room and a
bar of dark oak. In front of the bar was a row of armchairs set
upon pedestals, and behind the shining counter three very
capable young men in linen suits. There were a dozen men and
women drinking cocktails and talking at a round table on her
right. Ann's host, who seemed to have appeared from nowhere,
greeted her with a low bow.</p>

<p>"I am flattered by your punctuality, Miss Rooke," he
said.</p>

<p>"But why all this mystery?" she asked smiling. "A street
which I have never been in and which I thought was leading me
into Slumland, a dingy front door, anterooms which might have
belonged to a temperance hotel, and now&mdash;this!"</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>"We disguise ourselves," he confided. "Believe me, we have a
reason for everything we do. Crime does not flourish in the open
light of day."</p>

<p>A handsome woman with a very familiar face turned from the
round table.</p>

<p>"If you are going to talk about crime, Walter," she said,
"come and join us. You will be losing members soon, you know, if
you persist in being so hideously respectable."</p>

<p>Regnier sighed.</p>

<p>"So long as your grace does not desert us," he murmured.</p>

<p>The lady repeated her invitation. A small, dark man rose from
his place by her side to make room for Ann. Regnier shook his
head.</p>

<p>"If we may be excused," he begged. "I have a business affair
with this young lady and we are dining early...."</p>

<p>"So you have Duchesses amongst your criminals here," Ann
remarked, as her companion led her towards the bar.</p>

<p>"Duchesses and worse," he admitted. "We have several
Princesses, and a Grand Duke is one of the blackest of our
sheep. On the other hand, the lady sitting on the stool there
has served three years imprisonment for shooting her lover. If
the trial had been in England it would probably have been ten....  What can I offer you in the way of a cocktail?"</p>

<p>"A Dry Martini, if you please," Ann replied.</p>

<p>They took a small table in a recess, which procured for them
a certain amount of isolation. Ann looked around her in genuine
surprise.</p>

<p>"I expected to receive shocks here," she remarked, "but
surely that little man who has just come in why, I see his
picture in the paper every day."</p>

<p>Regnier nodded indifferently.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is Rowland Margetson," he confided. "The jury
found him 'not guilty' or he would have been in prison
to-night."</p>

<p>"Your cocktails are wonderful," she told him, precipitately
abandoning the conversation.</p>

<p>"We try to make everything the best of its sort," he assured
her. "Sometimes it is difficult. Would you be shocked if I told
you I had ordered our dinner in a private room?"</p>

<p>"Why should I be shocked?" she answered. "You will be able to
tell me more about this business of crime."</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly for a moment through slightly
narrowed eyelids.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you puzzle me," he confessed. "I should hate to
think I was disappointed and that you were really one of these
ingenuous young women who play at innocence and think they can
get away with anything. You are in the home of vice remember.
There isn't an altogether honest man in this room, except,
perhaps, my three barmen. Are you honest, Fred?" he went on,
addressing the man who had served them.</p>

<p>"We have to be here, Sir Walter," the man replied,
"considering there are so many millionaires amongst the members
and a great many&mdash;you will excuse me, sir&mdash;of whose
honesty there has been a certain amount of question at the Law
Courts&mdash;I never served in a club where the members were so
careful about their change."</p>

<p>"I am surprised at that," Ann murmured.</p>

<p>"It is quite true, madam," the man went on. "Lord Grantham,
who was one of the directors charged in that big shipping case
last year&mdash;they say he made a million out of the
public&mdash;and he only got two months&mdash;he's always
complaining that cocktails ought to come down in price."</p>

<p>"If they are all as good as these," Ann declared, "I think
you should advance them."</p>

<p>"I hope I may take that as a hint," Regnier observed.</p>

<p>"You may, if you are sure I am not being too expensive a
guest," she laughed.</p>

<p>Regnier declined a second cocktail but smoked a cigarette.
Then he excused himself for a moment while he spoke to three men
who had just come in.</p>

<p>"I was afraid this was going to be altogether a society
evening," he observed when he came back. "Those three belong to
the other world though all right."</p>

<p>"Tell me about them," she begged. "They looked such
dears."</p>

<p>"The man with the monocle, Harrison Barr," he confided, "is
the man in that manslaughter case down at Brighton. He is out on
bail. The man he is talking to, Sam Lennox, would have been
doing time for blackmail but his prosecutor died during the
trial. The other fellow is a Greek, a Captain Ph?bus. He was
sitting next to the Duchess when we came in."</p>

<p>"What a heavenly place!" Ann declared with a little sigh of
contentment.</p>

<p>A ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel approached them and respectfully announced
the service of dinner, and Regnier led the way through several
beautifully furnished reception-rooms, at present unoccupied,
and along a passage towards an automatic lift. They ascended to
the third floor. A bowing waiter met them in the corridor and
threw open the door of a small dining-room, very chic and
elegant, with doors opening on the other side of it. A table
laid for two stood in the middle of the room. There were pink
orchids in a S&egrave;vres vase upon the table, caviare already upon
their plates, with iced vodka in long thin glasses.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't refuse my vodka," Regnier remarked. "It's
genuine and quite scarce."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to regret the second cocktail," Ann sighed as
she sipped it.</p>

<p>"I'll let you off with just a thimbleful," he promised.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask to be let off with quite a small dinner,
too," she said, leaning back in her chair and looking round with
interest. "I have to sup out at eleven."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously. The lines round his mouth
deepened a little, but it was scarcely a smile. He seemed to
have developed the gift of silence.</p>

<p>"My guests," he said quietly, "are not always in such a
hurry."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am not an ordinary guest," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"I should like to know why you came," he meditated.</p>

<p>The waiter had left the room in search of the next course.
She answered him quite frankly and without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Why, because I wanted to! Haven't you gathered by now that I
love the unusual in life? I love adventures. This is an
adventure."</p>

<p>"I suppose," he went on thoughtfully, "you are not entirely
the ing&eacute;nue you would have me believe. You have an idea as to
what it may mean to dine alone with a man in a private
room&mdash;a man of extraordinarily bad character&mdash;in a
club which is known as a nest of criminals?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I do," she replied. "On the other hand, when the
girl is a girl of extraordinarily good character, what does it
matter?"</p>

<p>He balanced a fork on his long, delicate forefinger.</p>

<p>"Well," he observed, "that is one way of looking at it."</p>

<p>"It seems to me to be the only sane way," she persisted. "I
think men love to feel that they are terrifying. You don't
terrify me in the least, Sir Walter."</p>

<p>"Humiliating," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she laughed gaily. "I know perfectly well that
I shall not need to be melodramatic. Even those doors, which
connect with a suite or something, I suppose, leave me
unafraid."</p>

<p>"It is beginning to occur to me," he said as he nodded
approval at the dish which the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel had presented to
him, "that you would be a very desirable member of this club if
you could be induced to humour our criminal proclivities."</p>

<p>"You would find me very tolerant," she confided, looking
straight across at him, "of every crime but one."</p>

<p>"And that?" he asked.</p>

<p>She waited until the man had left the room.</p>

<p>"Kidnapping children," she said.</p>

<p>He set down the glass of wine which he had just raised to his
lips.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of the Chester case?" he asked politely.
"It seems to have created a great deal of unnecessary
commotion."</p>

<p>"I am interested in the Chester case," she admitted. "That is
why I am dining here with you tonight."</p>

<p>There was a curious and a profound silence. Not by a twitch
of the eyelids had he shown any surprise or emotion at her
speech. He was looking at her fixedly. Even with her perfect
nerves the silence seemed to have become uncanny. She looked
round the room and discovered the reason.</p>

<p>"How modern!" she observed. "No windows, no ventilation,
sterilised air! What a dangerous apartment this is in which you
choose to entertain your guests, Sir Walter!"</p>

<p>"That is why I admired your courage so much when you came,"
he remarked. "I am beginning to understand you a little better,
Miss Rooke."</p>

<p>"You will understand me better still when I tell you of a
slight happening which took place a week or ten days ago," she
recounted, "the day, by the by, when the Chester child
disappeared. I was driving, my car along a rather lonely byway
in Surrey when something came fluttering down from the sky in
front of me. I couldn't imagine what it was. I saw that it was
coming down in little circles from a beautiful, small, smoothly
running aeroplane which was mounting rapidly. I drew up my car
and waited. Soon I saw that it was a book. It fell with a plop
in the field at the side of the road. The aeroplane was now
almost out of sight. I entered the field and picked up the book
.... One moment, if you please, this chicken is too
delicious."</p>

<p>She continued her dinner for a moment or two in silence. Then
she took a sip of her wine.</p>

<p>"The book was a child's picture book," she went on, leaning
back in her place, "but a child's picture book de luxe. Its
illustrations were by Rackham and it struck me that the
letterpress might almost have been one of those private ones,
the type was so exquisitely clear. I looked it through and was
fascinated. I took the book back with me to London. That night
the evening papers were blazing the news of little Pamela
Chester's kidnapping."</p>

<p>Once more she paused, this time because the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel
had slipped into the room and filled the glasses. Even after he
had withdrawn she was in no hurry, and Regnier sat, a figure of
stone, without speech or movement of a single muscle.</p>

<p>"I think from the first thirty seconds," she continued, "I
have connected in my mind the discovery of that book and the
abduction of the Chester child. Chester, as we all very well
know, is a millionaire. The picture book which had fluttered
into the field by my side was the picture book of a
millionaire's child. The hour was about one hour after the child
had been missed by her governess in Bond Street. I went to the
one or two bookshops in London which were likely to have sold
such a production, and the third I called at recognised it at
once. It had been sold across the counter of their establishment
in Piccadilly about a week before and, despatched with two
others to the address of the buyer."</p>

<p>Again a brief pause, again that sphinxlike silence of her
host. Not in the least discomposed, Ann presently continued.</p>

<p>"The number of the aeroplane," she said, "was very distinctly
visible, but two of the figures seemed to me to be curiously
drawn. I made a note of them and I got a friend of mine who
understands aeroplanes to make enquiries. With the exception of
those two figures, a seven or a nine and a five or a three,
which lent themselves easily to alteration, the aeroplane was
easily identified. It was a luxury Moth delivered some three
weeks ago to the same person who was the purchaser of the
picture books. At this stage of my investigations I sought the
advice of a friend at Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," Regnier said, speaking at last, "how
interesting I find your narrative. One thing, however, you have
omitted. The name of the purchaser of the Moth and the picture
books."</p>

<p>"It is a name which has never yet passed my lips," Ann said.
"I kept it to myself for certain reasons. I shall tell it to you
for other reasons. It was a Captain Ph "Eventually I sought an
interview with the Chesters."</p>

<p>"That would seem very discreet," Regnier murmured.</p>

<p>"Their attitude," Ann proceeded, "was exactly what I had
imagined. Revenge, justice, punishment, although no criminal in
the world deserves hounding out of it as much as a kidnapper,
had no place in their minds. They wanted their daughter. They
had no other thought but that."</p>

<p>"And Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>"You must remember," Ann went on, "the official at Scotland
Yard whose advice I sought was not a person in the highest
authority, neither did I disclose to him all I knew. I asked him
a plain question, and that was whether he thought that the
prosecution of the criminals could be safely accomplished
without the slightest risk to the child. He pointed out to me
that I imposed upon him a tremendous responsibility, which he
refused to shoulder. From a friend he turned into an official.
He told me that my duty was to report myself to the Chief
Commissioner. He could give no guarantee as to the safety of the
child. The chief business of the police was to bring the
criminal to justice. He left it at that."</p>

<p>"You are a marvellously wise young woman, Miss Ann Rooke. So
you came to me, whom they call the father of the Hobgoblin
Club?"</p>

<p>"So I came to you."</p>

<p>Regnier toyed with his cigarette for a moment and then lit
it.</p>

<p>"Let me be sure," he said, "that I have this matter properly
envisaged. Your friend at Scotland Yard is aware that you could
trace the owner of the Moth aeroplane, but you have not yet
given him its number?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Ann agreed.</p>

<p>"He knows that you are aware of the name of the purchaser of
the child's picture book which fell from the aeroplane?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But you have not shared your knowledge with him?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I have not."</p>

<p>"Excellent. Who knows that you are dining tonight with
me?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>There was a glitter in his eyes for a moment. He pushed the
bowl of roses which stood between them on one side. He looked
straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>"There is no one, then, in the world who knows that you dine
at the Hobgoblin Club to-night?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul."</p>

<p>Regnier leaned back in his chair. One searched in vain for a
smile upon his face, and yet one felt that it was there. For
those few moments he was perhaps at his best.</p>

<p>"You have made your advances in this matter, Miss Rooke," he
said, "with almost uncanny skill. As a distinguished ancestor of
mine would have remarked, you have created an amazing and
intriguing situation. I will relieve you of further banalities
as to the danger of your position. Your genius told you from the
first that you were running no risk. I cannot always control my
subordinates, but to-night you have saved the parents their
child and the father his banking account, for what that is
worth. I propose that you forget the name of the purchaser of
the storybook. I propose also that you forget the number of the
Moth aeroplane."</p>

<p>"And in return?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>He glanced lazily at his watch.</p>

<p>"The child will arrive, in the best of health I can assure
you, at Durham House within an hour. There will be no question
of a ransom."</p>

<p>"And this poor caged bird?" Ann asked, rising to her
feet.</p>

<p>"Can flutter her wings whither she will," Regnier replied,
rising with a little bow, moving towards the door and throwing
it open. "You will allow me to call you a taxicab? I presume
that my bargain is accepted?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman's agreement?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A gentleman's agreement," he replied, bowing over her
finger-tips as they passed out to the corridor.</p>

<p>There were many gay parties in the dining-room downstairs and
from the bar came the sound of a hubbub of voices. They passed
to the exit by a different route.</p>

<p>"There is only one more thing to add, Miss Ann Rooke,"
Regnier concluded as the taxicab, for which the commissionaire
had whistled, rolled up. "By your criminal suppression of
knowledge, which should have at once been communicated to the
police, regardless of the possible results, you have qualified
for membership of the Hobgoblin Club. It will give me great
pleasure to propose you myself."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," she told him smiling, "to become a
member. Will you tell the driver to take me to the Embassy in
Bond Street? A charming dinner, Sir Walter."</p>

<p>"A very modest meal," he answered. "You see I remembered your
supper afterwards."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT ten-thirty that evening the telephone by the
side of which Colin had been seated for the last hour rang. He
seized the receiver and an unfamiliar voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Is that Mr. Colin Rooke?"</p>

<p>"Speaking."</p>

<p>"This is the Embassy Club, sir. A telephone message has been
waiting for you for some time. Our instructions were to ring you
up at precisely half-past ten and tell you its contents."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," Colin demanded.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, then the man's voice again.</p>

<p>"'Expect you here to supper at eleven o'clock. Please take
small table on right, and remember that for celebrations I
prefer Clicquot.' We have reserved the table, sir," the man
concluded. "Louis has put a bottle of the '19 Clicquot in the
ice."</p>

<p>"I shall be round in twenty minutes," was Colin's breathless
response&mdash; rather an indistinct response....</p>

<p>They met in the broad covered arcade leading into the Club.
Her feet seemed scarcely to touch the covered pavement, the
light he prayed for was in her eyes. She came with perfect
naturalness into that brief but perfect embrace, then she thrust
her hand under his arm.</p>

<p>"I have had my adventure," she told him. "I am happy."</p>

<p>"And the greater one?" he asked fervently.</p>

<p>"I am ready for that."</p>

<p>Just before they left the Club two hours later, flushed with
dancing and idiotically happy, the suave ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, who had
been hurrying about in every direction, paused at their
table.</p>

<p>"Great news for us all to-night, sir," he announced. "I have
just received a telephone message. The Chester child was
returned to her parents tonight unharmed, and in perfect health.
Her ladyship has so many friends here that I am busy spreading
the good news."</p>

<p>He hurried off. Ann and Colin raised their glasses.</p>

<p>"To your first exploit, dearest," he whispered.</p>

<p>Ann's glass remained at her lips a few seconds longer.
Perhaps she added a silent toast of her own.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">IT must have been some latent instinct of
devilment lurking behind his somewhat smug demeanour which
induced Percy Rooke, who had heard of that famous Bohemian
resort only the night before, to lean out of the window of his
car during a block in Piccadilly and instruct his chauffeur to
put him down at the Caf&eacute; Royal. He was not in the habit of
paying fortuitous visits to cocktail bars and places where
artists and their like are wont to congregate, but he was at
that moment a little weary of his sedate life.</p>

<p>He pushed open the swing doors which led into an unknown
world without any visible hesitation. His first impressions were
indeterminate. There was a sprinkling of smartly dressed young
women engaged for the most part, with the aid of small mirrors,
in dealing more or less successfully with any imperfections of
their make-up. Others were leaning back in their chairs
scrutinising with an air of pleased interest any chance
newcomer. There was a handful of young women dressed in another
fashion, the ultra-artistic outfit, mostly with a complexion of
ghastly pallor to match, lips of flaming scarlet and assuming a
real but not impregnable air of aloofness. The men were mostly
dressed as he was, but not so well, and a few in a manner which
he would never have dared to affect, with drooping collars and
flopping ties. All very interesting and very much what he had
expected.</p>

<p>A waiter relieved him of his hat and stick. A young woman,
seated with an elderly man upon one of the settees which lined
the room, moved her bag courteously from the adjoining table.
Percy Rooke, with a bow of acknowledgment, occupied the place,
demanded a whisky-and-soda from a waiter, lit a cigarette and
endeavoured to cultivate the air of a man entirely at ease
amongst familiar surroundings. A passer-by, obviously mistaking
him for someone else, nodded, which gave him confidence. A lady
opposite, with very rosy fingernails, favoured him with a
tentative smile and tapped the chair by her side. He pretended
not to notice and picked up a menu. The girl with the elderly
companion who had moved her bag from his table leaned slightly
towards him. She too smiled, but in a different fashion.</p>

<p>"You find that it is very much changed, this
place&mdash;yes?" she asked.</p>

<p>He accepted the cue at once.</p>

<p>"Unrecognisable," he declared. "Too modern."</p>

<p>He shook his head in disappointment. The girl sighed. He
ventured to look at her. She was apparently of any age between
twenty and thirty. Her face was long and oval and her make-up,
with which she had been only moderately lavish, was, at any
rate, skilful. She was quietly dressed, although her small hat
was set at a coquettish angle and her eyes were not empty of
invitation.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, and he was more than ever
conscious of the pleasantness of her voice, notwithstanding its
foreign accent. "I come here but rarely now. My old friends seem
to have found another home and they have taken the atmosphere
with them. You are perhaps an artist, monsieur?"</p>

<p>Percy Rooke shook his head regretfully, with the air of one
who had started life with that idea, but had been driven by grim
fate to the narrower channels.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of pictures and music," he confided, "but I
am only an amateur. I am in the insurance business."</p>

<p>"You make good money at that&mdash;yes?" the girl asked
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I make a sufficient income," he replied. "You see, I am a
bachelor and I have simple tastes."</p>

<p>She laughed softly. She had certainly very beautiful
teeth.</p>

<p>"You must have a strong will," she said, "or the ladies you
have met have not been very enterprising. Perhaps you are one
who does not like my sex, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"There is no one admires them more than I do," he assured her
bravely. "In my life, however, I meet very few."</p>

<p>She made a little gesture with her hand towards her
companion.</p>

<p>"You permit that I present you to my father?" she asked. "The
Count Heckerness. This gentleman's conversation has interested
me very much, Father. Your name if you please, monsieur?"</p>

<p>Percy Rooke produced his cardcase and laid a
beautifully-engraved specimen upon the table in front of her.
The girl read it out and passed it on.</p>

<p>"Mr. Percy Rooke," she said. "Percy is a very pretty
name."</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman rose to his feet. He was very tall, he
possessed an air of undeniable distinction, and he was decidedly
dirty. Even the fingernails of the hand which Percy Rooke
clutched gravely needed attention.</p>

<p>"I am very charmed to meet you, sir," he said. "It is seldom
that my daughter admits herself amused by an Englishman. I
congratulate you."</p>

<p>He sat down, and it was perhaps by accident that his fingers
as he did so pushed away an empty glass in front of him. At any
rate, he provided his new acquaintance with an opportunity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," the latter suggested, "I may be permitted to ask
you and your daughter to join me in some refreshment?"</p>

<p>There was a dual and enthusiastic consent. Mademoiselle, it
seemed, drank mixed vermouth; the Count preferred Kirsch.</p>

<p>"Vodka," he explained as the glasses were being filled, "is
not good here. I drink the Kirsch, which reminds me somewhat of
it. The vodka of the old days is no more."</p>

<p>He filled up his glass from the bottle which the waiter had
left upon the table and withdrew from the conversation.</p>

<p>"You are, I am sure, an artist, mademoiselle," her companion
ventured.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"People would not recognise my work as a branch of the arts,
I fear," she said. "Still, I do work, and very, very hard. I
come to these places for the business."</p>

<p>"Tell me what you do?" he begged.</p>

<p>"Would you really like to know?"</p>

<p>"I should," he assured her fervently.</p>

<p>"Well," she explained, "there are in my family quite a number
of sisters, three brothers and two cousins. I keep a
dancing-academy; that is to say, I teach dancing with the help of
these others. When I am busy they take pupils or they dance with
those who wish to dance for pleasure. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I think so," he assented with some hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, what might happen is like this," she
explained. "You are in London alone. You would like to have
dinner, you would like to dance. My name is known to you. You
look up my telephone number&mdash;Countess Heckerness, 1789
Hampstead. You ring up and explain the situation. You ask if I
will come and dance. Alas, I am distressed, but I am engaged for
the evening; shall I send you one of my sisters or my cousin, I
ask. And so it is. You have a partner, you dine pleasantly, you
pay a fee, and we live. <i>Voil&aacute;</i>!"</p>

<p>"I think it is a wonderful idea," he pronounced.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. She laughed gaily.</p>

<p>"Scarcely that," she protested. "But there are a great many
of us and we must live. Monsieur will pardon us now? There is a
client of the establishment who has just arrived, and I would
like to make an appointment with him."</p>

<p>A grasp of the hand from Monsieur le Comte, a subtle smile, a
momentary glimpse of mademoiselle's graceful figure as she
threaded her way amongst the chairs, and it was all over. Percy
Rooke a few minutes later finished his drink and took his leave.
He had the pleasant sense of having broken through the bondage
of the level hours. He still held tightly the card which
mademoiselle had thrust into his hand at the last moment. It was
discreet and elegant. "La Comtesse Heckerness, 17, Rochfort
Gardens," and in small letters on the other side, "Telephone No.
1789 Hampstead." The whole thing savoured of adventure.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">PERCY ROOKE, as became his forty-seven years
and his serious profession of insurance agent, was not a man of
swift or passionate impulses. It was a week before he presented
himself at 17, Rochfort Gardens and entered upon the second
stage of his adventure. His first impression of his new
surroundings, even as he handed his hat and umbrella to a
moderately tidy but somewhat flushed serving-maid, was that the
very atmosphere seemed charged with musical discords, proceeding
from every corner of the house. There was jazz music to the left
of him, there was jazz music to the right of him; the melody of
a waltz floated down the stairs and the clanging of a one-step
from somewhere in the back regions. It was a relief to be
ushered into a crowded room and exchange the pandemonium of
instrumental discord for the shrill chatter of human voices. His
hostess rose from her place at a round table, where she had been
seated behind an apparatus which seemed to him like a gigantic
tea-urn, and welcomed him with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Rooke!" she exclaimed. "How charming of you! We
have been hoping to see you every afternoon."</p>

<p>"I have been looking forward to this pleasure, mademoiselle,"
he replied in somewhat stilted fashion.</p>

<p>"Can I offer you some tea?" she enquired, touching the
monumental edifice in front of her.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," he replied. "I take a cup of tea always at
my office at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Well, we have finished," the Countess told him. "I will not
introduce you to everyone. You would, only forget their names.
But these are all my sisters which you see at the table. I start
from the left yes? That is Anna with the copper-coloured hair.
You must be careful of her, Mr. Rooke. She is a nice girl, but
she&mdash;I forget the word for the moment&mdash;she will flirt
with you if you give her the chance. Then there is Catherine,
better behaved, almost as demure as myself. And next is little
Soma. It is so convenient to have one small one, because she can
dance with the small men. Then here on the other side are my two
brothers, George and Andrew, and my stepbrother, Nicholas."</p>

<p>The young women acknowledged the introduction with a murmured
chorus of friendly platitudes. The young men, who were all three
similarly attired in pullovers and flannel trousers, bowed with
great formality.</p>

<p>"Now I shall take you away," his hostess continued, "and if
you really intend to become a patron, I shall see how you dance
and who would be your best partner.... The first thing we
have to do is to find an empty room," she went on. "I rather
fancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>She opened a door. A young man in tights and a girl in the
scantiest of costumes were facing one another with the air of
prize-fighters. A man with a violin was just starting to play.
The Countess waved her hand and drew her companion back into the
passage.</p>

<p>"We must not interrupt them," she said. "The violinist is
Marko. He is a great friend of the family and oh, so marvellous!
They are practising a new dance for the Palladium to-night. They
are the two who always bring money to the family. I expect you
have seen them advertised&mdash;Arnold and Betty, they call
themselves. Betty's real name is Nadine, but alas, we Austrians
are not very popular just now.... Hurrah! An empty room and
a gramophone. Any particular choice, Mr. Rooke?"</p>

<p>"Just an ordinary fox-trot," be suggested. "I'm not very
good, you know."</p>

<p>"If you were very good, it would not be worth your while to
come here," she said. "If you dance badly&mdash;eh bien! We will
try to make you dance better."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle slipped on a gramophone record, lifted her skirt
a little and held out her hands. Her partner, with an air of
great solemnity, lent himself to the music. For a man without
any sense of rhythm or graceful freedom of the limbs he danced
very correctly. The Countess patted him on the back at the
conclusion of the performance.</p>

<p>"But you dance very well," she exclaimed. "You need one
thing, and one thing only, but oh, how you need that!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, if you please, what it may be," he begged.</p>

<p>"Practice, my dear Mr. Rooke. Constant, indefatigable
practice."</p>

<p>"I must substitute the dance for my exercises in the bathroom
every morning," he suggested with heavy jocularity.</p>

<p>"Useless," she told him. "You must dance with a partner whom
you can hold in your arms and who will move with you to the
rhythm of the music that is the secret of real dancing."</p>

<p>"Then I must dance with you," he declared.</p>

<p>"You had better not let my father hear you make speeches like
that," she laughed "He is so strict with all of us. He expects
us to dance and earn all the money and not even to listen to a
compliment. That is not possible, is it, Mr. Rooke?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Shall I select one more record?"</p>

<p>The record was selected and danced. She led him to a divan
set against the wall.</p>

<p>"That was even better than the first," she declared. "You
will have to dance with Anna whenever I am occupied, Mr. Rooke.
She has just that swaying step which will help you to move more
freely. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I think so," he admitted.</p>

<p>"And now we must talk business," the Countess continued. "You
can come here as often as you like, Mr. Rooke, on your way home
from the City, and you can dance with whichever one of us is
free, and you will pay each time a guinea&mdash; yes?"</p>

<p>"It will suit me admirably," he assented.</p>

<p>The Countess, who had confided to him that her name was
Gertrude, was relieved. She watched with frank interest the
pound and the shilling which her new client had produced from
his pocket, and to save him embarrassment took it from him and
slipped it into her own bag.</p>

<p>"Receipts are not necessary," she said. "You pay every time
you come. If you take one of us out for the evening it is two
guineas and we must be fetched and brought home. With my sisters
perhaps a little present as well would be acceptable. I am
supposed to be the head of the establishment so it is not
necessary. The situation is clear to you, Mr. Percy?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he answered.</p>

<p>"You like us? You find it agreeable to come here?"</p>

<p>"Extraordinarily so," he assured her.</p>

<p>"Then we shall dance one more," Gertrude decided, springing
lightly to her feet, "and after that if Anna is free you shall
dance with her."</p>

<p>The evening finished in the most satisfactory fashion. The
new patron, who found it was possible to obtain refreshments
upon the premises, stood cocktails to a small but very thirsty
crowd, augmented by the sudden arrival from the lower regions of
the Count himself. It was, in Percy Rooke's own opinion as he
stepped into his car, a slightly disreputable, but exceedingly
agreeable afternoon.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, Mr. Percy Rooke sat in the private
sitting-room of his cousin, the proprietress of the Cedarwood
Guest-House, waiting for an interview which he had shirked and
which he disliked more than anything else in life. An
unfortuitous combination of circumstances seemed every moment to
render that interview more distasteful. It was a sunny spring
morning and a faintly stir</p>

<p>The great occasion had arrived and the man, as so often
happens, found himself pitifully at a loss. He had his cue but
he missed it.</p>

<p>"I do seem to have dined out a great deal lately," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"Quite a man about town," she smiled. "However, so long as
you are amused. That's the great thing in life, isn't it? Now
tell me what it is you wanted to see me about."</p>

<p>His courage failed him completely. The few plain, dignified
words which he had learnt by heart and which sounded perfectly
natural when spoken in the privacy of his chamber, had gone from
his mind. He suddenly ceased even to believe in the situation
which had arisen. It wasn't possible that he, Percy Rooke, had
been spending all these evenings dancing and whispering all
sorts of amorous amenities to some other woman&mdash;a
foreigner, an Austrian Countess&mdash;it was ridiculous. There
was only one woman whom he had really ever cared for and there
she sat waiting for him to speak. He just felt he couldn't do
it.</p>

<p>"Grace," he faltered desperately, "it wasn't anything really.
Another time, or perhaps I'll write."</p>

<p>"Don't be an idiot," she exclaimed, trying hard to conceal
her own agitation. "If you have anything to say, say it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you want to make a change&mdash;to leave me?"</p>

<p>"You have said it," he muttered. "I couldn't. I'll have to
make a move, Grace."</p>

<p>Now that he had said it he was stupefied.</p>

<p>"You are going to leave me?" she said quietly. "Is there
anything wrong, anything you don't like?"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am going to be married," he announced.</p>

<p>Then there was silence. They neither of them heard any longer
the humming of the bees outside, the soft rustle of the wind in
the tall elm trees. Percy was loathing the feeble spark of
courage which had enabled him to say those words to her. Her
cheerful world, through which she had been moving so blithely,
seemed suddenly to have become air impossible place, her life
until then so brimful of interests and content&mdash;a dreary
wilderness.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me before?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>"I wasn't sure," he answered drearily. "I didn't believe in
it myself."</p>

<p>"When can I see her and who is she?"</p>

<p>Percy Rooke coughed. It was not a meeting to which he was
looking forward with any pleasure, in fact the more he thought
of it the less he liked it.</p>

<p>"She's an Austrian," he confided. "She has a great many
relatives. You won't like her. You won't like them. Oh
damn!"</p>

<p>Perhaps that was the most encouraging thing he could have
said. She showed some faint signs of recovery.</p>

<p>"Don't be stupid," she enjoined. "Of course I must see her
and her relations, and I assure you I'll do my best to like
them. Austrians have been having a terrible time lately, haven't
they?"</p>

<p>He thought of the three sisters in their cheap frocks, their
ceaseless chatter, their hungry chase of life. He thought of the
three young men in pullovers and slacks throughout the day and
carefully preserved evening clothes at night. Young men who
bowed from the middle, made flowery speeches, drank everything
they were offered and borrowed half-crowns. No, there wasn't the
faintest chance that she would like them.</p>

<p>"I'll bring Gertrude to dinner one night if I may," he
proposed.</p>

<p>"Whenever you like," she agreed. "I can't pretend, Percy,"
she went on, her head turned a little away from him, "that I
shall be very pleased to see her, but your happiness is the
great thing and if you really care&mdash;well, that is
everything. I hope you are sure about that, Percy. It's the
great thing, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," he assented. "Well, we will see. She
has a great many engagements. Perhaps one night later in the
week. I'll let you know."</p>

<p>"I wish you looked a little more happy about it, Percy," she
told him frankly.</p>

<p>"Haven't got used to the idea yet," he muttered. "That'll
come all right."</p>

<p>He hurried away. She watched him wistfully, had half a mind
to call him back but let him go. Perhaps there was after all a
glimmering of hope.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">NEVER, Percy Rooke reflected as he descended
from his neat and prosperous-looking automobile, crossed the few
yards of pavement, pushed open the crazily hung gate and made
his way up to the front door of No. 17, Rochfort Gardens on that
particular evening, had the clatter down in the basement seemed
more disturbing, the pile of half emptied receptacles, fragments
of vegetables and dustman's litter more hideously apparent. With
the licence of a privileged client he pushed open the door and
entered. There was the same crazy din of gramophones, peals of
staccato laughter from the sirenlike sisters, and mingled odours
of rancid tobacco-smoke and countless meals eaten in
unventilated rooms. Scales seemed to fall from his eyes as he
wandered round the place. In one small room he found Gertrude
being bounced around by a man who had so much the appearance of
a bookmaker that one glanced at him in involuntary surprise at
the absence of his satchel. She was holding her head back very
much in the way she affected when she danced with him. Her very
beautiful eyes seemed to be asking almost the same questions.
She was a little more tired, there was slightly more powder upon
her cheeks, she looked a little older. The smile with which she
greeted him was obviously forced.</p>

<p>"See you later, Percy dear," she called out. "I had to keep
Mr. Bolt waiting and we have only just begun. One of my most
promising pupils, too, are you not, James?"</p>

<p>The big man pirouetted on one foot and glanced
condescendingly down at Percy.</p>

<p>"I'll say so," he declared. "Mind closing that door?" he went
on. "I'm all in a stew and there's a regular draught coming up
the stairs."</p>

<p>Percy Rooke accepted the hint, descended the stairs and made
his way unobtrusively in the direction of the front door. One of
the lanky young men, who appeared to have been waiting for him,
touched him on the shoulder in friendly fashion. He was tall and
well enough built, but he was an unpleasant-looking youth with
overpallid complexion, suspicious-looking flaxen hair and weak
eyes.</p>

<p>"Could I speak with you for a moment, Mr. Rooke?" he
begged.</p>

<p>"Presently," was the hasty reply. "I have to go out. I'm
coming back in half an hour."</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate," the young man pleaded, "as it is a
matter of business."</p>

<p>"Yours or mine?" Percy Rooke asked with rare cynicism.
"Anyway, you must excuse me for a few minutes," he added.</p>

<p>There was no escaping Anna, however. She was walking up and
down the shabby hall waiting for him.</p>

<p>"I find it necessary&mdash;" he began to explain.</p>

<p>She cut him short, thrust her arm through his, and
disregarding utterly his faint efforts at resistance, dragged
him into one of the smaller rooms on the ground floor. She
listened for a moment after she had closed the door.</p>

<p>"Here is Dad coming upstairs from the kitchen," she muttered.
"Do not be scared."</p>

<p>She turned the key in the lock, heedless of her companion's
protests.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rooke," she went on, "I am going to speak to you for two
minutes. None of the others will let me if they can prevent it.
Look at me. Am I changed?"</p>

<p>He studied her in puzzled fashion.</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact," he admitted, "yes, in a way you
are changed."</p>

<p>"You find me improved&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>She smoothed out her really beautiful auburn hair. It was
brushed tightly back from her forehead and drooped from her neck
in a little chignon. It had lost the frizziness he hated and was
in its way almost distinguished. She was wearing a black gown,
and the make-up of weeks of various sorts seemed to have been
washed from her face. She was a little pallid, perhaps, but
entirely presentable.</p>

<p>"You like me better like this?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"You were not happy the other night when you took me out
instead of Gertrude," she said. "I could tell that by your
behaviour. I have tried to make myself more what you like."</p>

<p>"I am sure that is very considerate of you," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Now listen, please," she continued. "You were taking out
Gertrude to-night to the Savoy to dine and dance."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Will you take me instead?"</p>

<p>"Does she wish it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She is tired out, she is ill," Anna confided. "She supports
the whole family&mdash;this sister of mine. Soon she will be in
the hospital, and then what will there be left of us? If you
please, Mr. Rooke. I will be as agreeable in every way as I know
how. Already I have done what I could. You were to have met
Gertrude at eight o'clock in the foyer of the Savoy. May I be
there instead, please?"</p>

<p>"There was something I particularly wanted to say to
Gertrude," Percy Rooke observed.</p>

<p>"You can say it to me," Anna told him firmly. "I am going to
take over my share of the responsibility which this terrible
family of ours demands."</p>

<p>"You will arrange it with Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"I promise, and I promise you this, too," she answered as she
unlocked the door, the handle of which had been twice softly
turned. "You may not think me attractive. You may not like to
dance with me as you do with Gertrude, but you will not be
ashamed of me."</p>

<p>"There was never any question of that, Anna," Percy Rooke
assured her, with the faint flush of the unaccustomed liar in
his cheeks.</p>

<p>It really was an unexpectedly pleasant evening. Anna, with
her beautiful hair under proper control, in a simple black
frock, and with scarcely any cosmetics, presented a quiet and
distinguished appearance. She danced almost as well as Gertrude,
and although her English was scarcely so fluent, it was
sufficiently intelligible. About halfway through the evening she
asked for more coffee and settled herself back in her chair.
They had a divan table in the corner and she made room for him
to sit nearer to her.</p>

<p>"I ask now a great thing," she said, "but you are a generous
man."</p>

<p>Percy Rooke groaned inwardly. Every other one of the family
was already in his debt. Now it was to be Anna.</p>

<p>"You wish to marry my sister Gertrude," she continued. "You
know that we are in trouble. She consents. She marries you. And
that thousand pounds we need to set us straight again you will
pay. That is so&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"A little crudely put," he ventured, "but it is true. I am
very fond of your sister, though," he added bravely, "and I
think she is fond of me."</p>

<p>Anna shook her head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Oh no," she assured him. "She is not fond of you. She is
fond of one person. You know Marko."</p>

<p>"Marko the violinist?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Marko is an artist," Anna declared firmly. "We will not
speak of him much, but he loves Gertrude and Gertrude loves him.
Because of him she says 'No' to many men who would like to flirt
with her. Now he breaks his heart, she breaks her heart because
she must marry you."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" Percy Rooke stammered. "Why couldn't she
tell me that herself?"</p>

<p>"Because she is honourable," was the quiet reply. "She has
already had two hundred pounds of that thousand pounds. I asked
you here to speak of this. I propose something."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," he invited.</p>

<p>"I have no Marko," Anna continued, patting his hand. "I am a
nice girl&mdash; yes&mdash;I do what you ask. I marry you if you
will. Take me instead and give the rest of the money. I will go
on working if you wish. I will earn money. I do not love you
yet, but if you wish to have me you can, and if you are good to
me I will be good to you. There! What is it that you say, Mr.
Percy?"</p>

<p>The bottle of liqueur brandy had been left upon the table. He
helped himself.</p>

<p>"I'm fond of Gertrude," he confided, "but for the last few
weeks I have noticed some things which have troubled
me&mdash;little things, but they point. You understand?"</p>

<p>"You would be stupid if you had not noticed," she declared.
"She loves Marko and she is in despair."</p>

<p>"Well, she need despair no longer," he said. "I give her
up."</p>

<p>"You will not be too miserable?" she pleaded. "I may tell her
that?"</p>

<p>"I will not be miserable at all," he promised.</p>

<p>"And you will have me instead?"</p>

<p>"Do you want me to?"</p>

<p>"I am willing," she said. "I have thought this all out. I
will make you a good wife or a good companion. I am a good
girl."</p>

<p>"Do you care for me?"</p>

<p>"No," she admitted. "That is the truth."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You are too old," she answered, "and you have stiff ways. I
am a good girl but I am a Bohemian. Still, I will change."</p>

<p>"You don't need to," he told her. "I shall forget the two
hundred pounds your sister has had. You shall have the whole
thousand pounds to-morrow, and to tell you the truth, Anna,
although you are a nice girl and I am sure a good girl, I want
to marry someone else."</p>

<p>The sullen look which had brooded more than once during the
evening upon her face slowly disappeared. She leaned back in her
chair and laughed. She rocked with laughter. She swallowed some
coffee.</p>

<p>"Give me some brandy," she begged. "Oh, I am happy! It is
settled?"</p>

<p>"On my word of honour," he promised.</p>

<p>"I may wait until I find a young man of my own. You will give
Gertrude up," she persisted; "and you will lend the money?"</p>

<p>"I will give Gertrude up," he assured her. "I shall be
delighted to have you as my friend but I don't wish to marry
you, and I will lend the money."</p>

<p>She drank off her brandy with ecstasy.</p>

<p>"It is a good world," she pronounced. "Gertrude will marry
Marko. Our debts will be paid. I shall find for myself a
husband. We dance once more&mdash;yes? Then I go home and make
Gertrude happy too."</p>

<p>He smiled a little ruefully yet his heart was light as he
rose to his feet. He deemed it perhaps in the best of taste to
keep his feelings to himself.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ONLY a few evenings later the small company of
the Rooke Legatees gathered together for their customary dinner.
Everyone remarked upon Mrs. John Rooke's appearance. She had
always been a somewhat distinguished figure, but this time she
looked ten years younger.</p>

<p>"Something has happened," Ann declared.</p>

<p>"My dears," Mrs. Rooke confided. "Last time we met I was
complaining. To-night I am happy. My adventure has arrived."</p>

<p>"Your adventure?" Ann exclaimed. "Quickly! Tell us all about
it."</p>

<p>"Mine is, perhaps, not quite so thrilling as the amazing
scrapes you others seem to get into," she confided with a smile.
"But it is thrilling enough for me. I am going to marry
Percy."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">COLIN ROOKE stood in the comfortable little
hall of the Brancaster Dormy House Club, his pipe in his mouth
and his hands in the loose pockets of his tweed knickerbockers,
gazing disconsolately at the letter-rack. There was a hopeless
chasm in the aperture marked with an R.</p>

<p>"That's the last post of the day, is it, Large?" he asked the
porter.</p>

<p>"Nothing more till to-morrow morning, sir," the man
replied.</p>

<p>Colin turned away frowning. His rough clothes were still
heavy with the moisture of the driving mist and the sting of the
north wind roaring across the marshes was on his cheeks. A hot
bath, tea and toast, and a rubber of bridge were clearly
indicated. All the same it wasn't like Ann to leave him for a
week without a letter. On the landing a giant of a man in a
flaming orange-coloured dressing-gown greeted him
amicably&mdash;Dunrobin, the scratch golfer and a mighty
hitter.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rooke! Down for the week-end?"</p>

<p>"Might stay a little longer if it doesn't get too infernally
cold," Colin answered. "I'm supposed to be finishing up Marley's
duck shoot. Not much good if the wind doesn't change. When did
you turn up?"</p>

<p>"Last night, but I was dining over at Hunstanton," the other
replied. "I heard you were here. By the by, I ran across a very
charming young woman&mdash;a Miss Rooke&mdash;down at Monte
Carlo. Any connection?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so."</p>

<p>"An uncommon name rather. This was a Miss Ann Rooke. A very
smart young lady with beautiful brown hair and hazel
eyes&mdash;quite a beauty. Christian name Ann."</p>

<p>For a moment Colin stared at his acquaintance in bewildered
silence.</p>

<p>"That sounds rather like a second cousin of mine, but I
hadn't heard she was going away. I thought she was in
London."</p>

<p>"She arrived in Monte Carlo by the <i>Train Bleu</i> on
Thursday," Dunrobin confided. "She was dining the same night
with some of the musical crowd I know slightly."</p>

<p>"You didn't meet her, I suppose?" Colin enquired.</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"I wish I had," he admitted. "I didn't know the people she
was with well enough to butt in. Going out after the duck to-night?"</p>


<p>Colin was feeling a little dazed.</p>

<p>"Don't think so. We did pretty well last evening. I've had
two rounds of golf and I'm pretty well wet through. I'm going to
have a bath and change."</p>

<p>"Sound idea," his friend observed as he made his way along
the corridor.</p>

<p>Mechanically Colin turned on the bath, stripped and
disappeared for a time in a cloud of steaming vapour. Afterwards
he donned the informal dinner costume which the valet had
prepared and descended into the lounge. He ordered tea and toast
but found himself without his usual appetite. The toast seemed
burnt and the tea flavourless. There could scarcely be another
Ann Rooke who was remarkable for her brown hair and hazel eyes,
but what was she doing in Monte Carlo? It seemed incredible that
she should have gone there without a word to him. When he had
left town it had been arranged that she should go down to
Somersetshire to a country house-party and they were both to
return to London on the same day. Monte Carlo without a word to
him! It was incredible. He lit his pipe after tea, strolled
across to the hall-porter's small bureau and demanded London on
the telephone. In a few minutes he found himself speaking to the
commissionaire of the building in which Ann had her small
flat.</p>

<p>"Miss Rooke, sir?" the former replied. "Not here at present.
She went away last Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea where she went?" Colin asked. "This is Mr.
Rooke speaking."</p>

<p>"I recognised your voice, sir," the man acknowledged. "I know
where she went because I took her place for her on the <i>Train
Bleu</i>. She went to Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>"Did she take the maid with her&mdash;Mrs. Holmes?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Mrs. Holmes is in the flat. Would you like to speak
to her?"</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>"I'll put you through, sir."</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes was difficult&mdash;a little disturbed, Colin
fancied. Her mistress's departure was entirely unexpected, she
confessed. They had been going to Somersetshire on Tuesday but
Miss Rooke had suddenly changed her mind and sent for a ticket
for Monte Carlo. Mrs. Holmes had no idea of the reason. Miss
Rooke had received no special visitors. The telephone she
couldn't answer for.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there's any harm in telling you this, sir,"
she wound up diffidently. "Miss Rooke did seem a little worried
before she left and she wrote you a letter, sir, but told me not
to post it. It is here at the flat and nothing was to be done
about it unless you came here yourself or seemed in any way
upset at her sudden departure."</p>

<p>"Did your mistress say when she would be returning?" Colin
asked.</p>

<p>"She didn't seem to know herself, sir," the woman confided.
"The whole thing seemed to have been decided upon all at once.
There was one telephone message," the woman added reluctantly,
"which seemed to have something to do with it but I can't tell
you for certain who it was from."</p>

<p>"Have a shot at it, Mrs. Holmes," Colin begged. "It may be
important."</p>

<p>"Well, I did hear something about the telephone message being
from a Lady Kennard. Something was said, I remember, about the
Directors' Room at Covent Garden and a Mr. Regnier," the woman
confessed.</p>

<p>"Hold the letter for me," Colin snapped. "Stay in all the
morning, Mrs. Holmes. I shall be with you before lunch."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," the woman assented meekly....</p>

<p>Colin made his way back to the lounge, drank two
whisky-and-sodas instead of one, revoked twice in the only rubber
of bridge he played, and departed soon after dinner for Norwich
to sleep at the Maid's Head Hotel and catch the early morning
train for London.</p>

<p>The contents of the note which Colin found awaiting him in
Ann's tiny flat brought him little consolation.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Colin, my dear</i></span> [he read,
in Ann's scrawly handwriting],

<p class="letter">Don't be angry with me, please. This is the last
time, I promise you, unless we are working together, but I just
couldn't refuse to help in&mdash;well, a certain little matter.
You shall be the first to know all about it.</p>

<p class="letter">I am hoping that I will get back before you
discover that I am playing truant for a day or two, but if not,
don't worry and don't be cross with me.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever yours, <span class="smcap">Ann</span></p>

<br>


<p>"Tell me about the telephone message," Colin said as he
thrust the letter into his pocket.</p>

<p>"The bell rang on Monday night, sir. I answered it. I
understood the gentleman to say that he was speaking from some
office in connection with Covent Garden on behalf of Lady
Kennard, and when Miss Ann spoke I did hear her say 'Is that Mr.
Regnier?' That's all I can tell you, sir. Miss Ann seemed quite
excited afterwards. I had to unpack all her things for
Somersetshire and she's gone off. I can't tell you any more,
sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Colin said. "I'll find out the rest for
myself."</p>

<p>Inspector Deanes Seymour was preparing to leave his room to
keep a luncheon engagement when Colin Rooke's card was brought
to him. He glanced at it with uplifted eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see Mr. Rooke by appointment," he said, "but
just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no time to finish his sentence. Colin Rooke was
there, grim and furious. Seymour's first impulse was of
irritation.</p>

<p>"What the dickens is the matter with you, Rooke?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"You are going to find out," was the swift reply. "Where have
you sent Ann Rooke?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about," Seymour declared.
"I haven't seen or heard anything of her for weeks."</p>

<p>Colin Rooke checked the expletive which would have ended the
conversation. He remained silent for a moment. The inspector
realised that he was in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Rooke," he enjoined. "Pull yourself together. Get
this into your head. I promised you I wouldn't make use of Miss
Rooke's services any more without giving you warning. I have
kept my word. I haven't corresponded with or approached her in
any way. Now tell me what's happened to her?"</p>

<p>Rooke told his story. Seymour listened and his expression
became grave.</p>

<p>"This sounds to me like a put-up job, Rooke," he said. "I
have neither rung up Miss Rooke nor approached her in any way.
How did you know that she was at Monte Carlo?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine at Brancaster told me the night before last
that she was there. She arrived just before he left. I hadn't
heard a word from her, so I rang up her apartment last night.
The hall-porter told me that he had booked her place on the
<i>Train Bleu</i>. I shall charter a plane this afternoon and
try and get through as far as Cannes."</p>

<p>"Steady on," the inspector replied. "Don't make up your mind
quite so quickly."</p>

<p>"What the devil else is there to do?" Colin demanded.</p>

<p>"Use a little common sense," was the blunt reply. "We'll take
it for granted, especially if this fellow Regnier is mixed up in
it, that this may be a criminal attempt to abduct Miss Rooke.
There's one thing very certain, though. You have been asked,
absolutely invited, to follow Miss Rooke to Monte Carlo. Your
friend having seen her there&mdash;that part of it is helpful.
On the other hand, if you do the obvious thing and go there
after her, it's a box of cigars to a packet of half penny
squiffs that she won't be there. She'll be where you least
expect to find her."</p>

<p>"Where do you mean?" Colin demanded.</p>

<p>Seymour glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"No use getting panicky, young fellow," he said. "We'll
discuss that over lunch."</p>

<p>Luncheon produced very little in the way of inspiration. The
only common conclusions the two men were able to arrive at were
firstly that the person who was responsible for Ann's
disappearance had taken not the slightest trouble to induce her
to conceal her movements, and that being so, it was obvious that
they were either indifferent as to Colin's following her to
Monte Carlo, or that they believed Ann's interest in her mission
was sufficiently strong to weigh against any influence which
Colin might bring to bear. As for Lady Kennard, she was reported
to be in her flat in Paris, which she had not left for three
weeks.</p>

<p>"Personally," Seymour summed up, "I have arrived at only one
conclusion. You say you have already wired Miss Rooke to ask for
an explanation of this change in her plans. I should wait till
you get a reply before you start out to follow her."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but she may not get the telegram,"
Colin protested.</p>

<p>"Give her time to reply before you do what it seems the
person who is responsible for her journey is inviting you to
do&mdash;to rush off to Monte Carlo after her," Seymour said
bluntly. "I don't mind telling you, Rooke, that the first move,
after all, is ours. Whilst you were waiting for the taxi I
slipped down to our Overseas Department and I ordered our
telephone operator to put a call through to Howes, one of our
agents in Paris&mdash;the best we have, as a matter of fact. He
poses as correspondent to a London daily, but he's done a lot of
fine work for us. I instructed him first to call on Lady Kennard
and ascertain what her movements had been for the last few
weeks, then to hire a plane and get to Cannes to-night, motor
over to Monte Carlo and report as to the doings of Miss Ann
Rooke. That is a little quicker than anyone who is up to
mischief could expect to be disturbed."</p>

<p>Colin smiled for the first time.</p>

<p>"That was a damned good idea," he said. "I know Howes,
although I didn't know he worked for you. He's a clever
fellow."</p>

<p>"He's a quick worker, anyhow," Seymour continued. "The
message will catch him before he goes out. We have our fixed
hours for telephone conversations, and I shouldn't be surprised
if he wasn't on his way to Le Bourget by now. My advice to you,
Colin, is not to walk into such a clumsily baited trap. You have
been practically invited to go to Monte Carlo. If you take my
advice, you will stay here and await Howes's report."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," Colin promised disconsolately.</p>

<p>"And meantime," Seymour enjoined as he turned round to ask
the waiter for the bill, "do you mind looking at the gentleman
in neat tweeds and pince-nez who is seated at the table near the
door, reading a newspaper? I should be interested to know if you
ever saw him before."</p>

<p>Colin glanced carelessly at the stranger and paused to light
a cigarette. A moment or two later he leaned across the
table:</p>

<p>"I am almost certain," he confided, "that he travelled up
from Norwich with me this morning."</p>

<p>"I should think it highly probable," Seymour said dryly. "If
you tried to catch the two-twenty or took a taxi down to
Croydon, you would probably see quite a great deal more of
him."</p>

<p>Seymour paid the bill, the two men rose to their feet and
strolled towards the door. The man in the pince-nez took no
notice of them. He did not even raise his head from the paper.
Outside, on the pavement, the commissionaire threw open the door
of the taxicab which he had summoned.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Heston Aerodrome," Seymour replied.</p>

<p>The chauffeur was occupied for a minute or two in backing his
taxicab in order to turn round.</p>

<p>"I only wanted to make sure of that fellow," Seymour
explained. "He goes on to our black list this afternoon. Don't
turn your head but just glance through the window as we
pass."</p>

<p>Colin did as he was bidden. The commissionaire had entered
the restaurant and they could see his tall form bending over the
table near the door at which the man with the pince-nez was
seated.</p>

<p>"An amateur's trick," Seymour remarked as he redirected the
driver a little later on. "It may be that he is off your track
for half an hour, though."</p>

<p>Colin Rooke spent an unusual afternoon reading up the
geography where the next war was likely to take place, and
telephoned to one or two acquaintances. At about five o'clock a
uniformed inspector brought him an official note from Scotland
Yard. He broke open the seal and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Sorry, Colin&mdash;Things aren't going quite
our way. Howes's car was run into by a lorry on his way to Le
Bourget. Howes is in hospital and will be off the map for a
week. Stay where you are till you see me. I have a conference
with the Chief in half an hour.</p>

<br>

<p>That period of waiting was not one of the pleasantest in
Colin's young life.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE curtain of the opera house in Monte Carlo
had fallen upon the first act of a well-known popular opera.
Hand in hand the artistes had made their bows. The applause died
away, the lights glowed with an increased radiance, there was a
rustle of programmes, the murmur of voices. In a moment or two
the exodus to the forum outside began. In Monte Carlo the women
as well as the men join in that friendly little parade. It is
not perhaps the occasion on which the most wonderful toilettes
are worn. Those are reserved for the semiroyal banquets on gala
nights at the Sporting Club. Here, however, congregate the
lovers of music, and the people who love music have always their
particular niche in the world.</p>

<p>Ann Rooke was seated in the front row of the last
amphitheatre of stalls, a little raised above the others and
usually much sought after. By her side throughout the act had
been the only vacant seat in the place. Ann was looking her
best, although there was an air of detachment about her, which
showed that she was living in a world where such matters as a
successful toilette are not the greatest things that count. A
psychologist who had studied her throughout the evening would
probably have decided that it was not the very beautifully
rendered music but the empty seat by her side which was
responsible for her aloofness. She had the air of a woman who
was suffering at the same time from the strain of a great
anticipation and a poignant fear. On their way out there was
scarcely one of the chattering, gossiping crowd who did not look
twice at this young woman seated alone, a stranger to nearly
everybody, yet in her way remarkable. She was still there when
they came back again. She seemed to be looking nowhere in
particular. Her eyes sought no recognition from the few friends
she might have had. A great novelist, who lived on one of the
Caps a few miles away, summed up her attitude best perhaps when
he remarked to his companion on his way back to his seat:</p>

<p>"That young woman is waiting."</p>

<p>"For what?" the other asked.</p>

<p>The novelist shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"For something to happen," he said. "I don't even myself know
yet whether it is to be a tragedy or a comedy."</p>

<p>"The worst of our host is," one of the others in the party
remarked, "that he looks at everyone with a coldly professional
eye."</p>

<p>"And the worst of you, my dear philanderer," the novelist
rejoined, "is that you see nothing but mere sex in every
beautiful woman you glance at. Their passions and moods mean
nothing to you. I tell you that that girl is either suffering,
or hoping, or fearing more intensely than you will ever be able
to do in your butterfly life...."</p>

<p>The lights went out. The overture, a very short one,
commenced, and the curtain rose. Almost from the first the
wonder began. There were some who in the first act had
criticised in casual but friendly fashion the singing of the
tenor, but the first notes of his marvellous song, stealing out
from a hidden place at the back of the stage, brought with them
perplexity and wonder. Then the whole house thrilled to what was
happening. No one understood. They only listened. The voice grew
in volume and beauty. It became inhuman. There were many who
were more than slightly baffled, who thought that their
favourite was strangely excelling himself, but there were others
who refused to believe their senses, whom nothing could convince
that it was indeed the man whose name was printed upon the
programme or any other man whom they had ever heard, who was
filling the strange, electrified atmosphere of the place with
those strains of marvellous, soul-racking melody. The silence of
an audience thrilled to the very core by something which appeals
to the senses is a thing one rarely hears. Even their breathing
seemed suspended. There was not a cough, not once the movement
of an impatient foot, the flutter of a single programme. There
was a silence which had in it something almost awful....</p>

<p>The flood of melody died away. The song had come to an end.
Nevertheless, that curious silence continued&mdash;even those
shadowy figures on the stage seemed to be waiting for something
which never came. There was scarcely a soul in the great
audience who was not spellbound. Applause would have appeared
incongruous. In silence everyone waited until the burden of the
opera was taken up, then there was a dim murmur of voices, a
sort of sigh, as of pent-up emotions. The orchestra bent over
their instruments, the routine of producing a famous work passed
on. It was doubtful whether a single member of the audience was
still following the story towards its climax. They were obsessed
by the idea that a miracle had happened, but of that miracle
there came no explanation. The act passed to its end. There was
a little more than the customary applause but there were loud
and indistinguishable calls from the back of the auditorium. The
performers bowed their acknowledgment from the front. Presently,
as the voices swelled in volume, the baritone stepped
forward.</p>

<p>"Mesdames et messieurs," he said. "I have to offer you the
apologies of Signor Catti who is temporarily unwell. He hopes to
make his acknowledgments to you after the last curtain."</p>

<p>That was all. People rose slowly and unwillingly to their
feet. Everyone was talking, it seemed, at the top of their
voices, and it was just at that moment that Ann, still seated in
the same place, still with the empty seat by her side, looked
across at the crowd who were wedged in against the wall and met
the fierce, demanding eyes of the man who had stepped out of his
plane only an hour ago. With a little less than his usual
courtesy of manner he struggled through the mass of people till
he stood by her side. They both seemed to recognise the futility
of empty words. Whilst he paused for a minute to recover his
breath she spoke first.</p>

<p>"I hoped so much that you would not come, Colin," she
said.</p>

<p>"And since I am here?"</p>

<p>"I shall only pray that you will go away," she went on.
"These may be our final words, Colin, if you will not do as I
ask."</p>

<p>"For whom are you guarding that seat?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"That is above all the one thing I shall not tell you," she
replied.</p>

<p>Colin was passionately angry, but passionately quiet.</p>

<p>"Then I will occupy it until your friend arrives," he
said.</p>

<p>He leaned forward and suddenly became conscious of the
presence of two of the black-liveried attendants of the place. A
firm, almost threatening voice was in his ear.</p>

<p>"<i>Pardon, monsieur. Cette place est reserv&eacute;e.</i>"</p>

<p>Colin made what was almost the effort of his life. He kept
his temper and his presence of mind.</p>

<p>"In that case," he said calmly, "I will listen to the finish
of the opera from the gangway."</p>

<p>The usher fell back. Ann, although she was conscious of the
menace in Colin's voice, felt curiously helpless. She watched
him resume his place against the wall, where he stood with
folded arms. Her little gesture of appeal passed unnoticed. He
remained there sullenly waiting. Ann, clasping the programme in
her hand, also waited.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">NO one saw it happen&mdash;not even Colin. He
glanced towards the stage as the curtain rose on the final act
of the opera, and when he looked back again there was a man
seated in the vacant place by Ann's side. Taking stock of him
with a kind of critical fury, Colin found him hard to place. He
was obviously a foreigner, with that peculiar pallor which only
Italians appear to achieve. He was unusually short and stocky of
build, with broad shoulders and legs which scarcely reached the
floor. His eyes were large and deep-set. They seemed to wander
everywhere and see nothing. He had the air of a man who was
nervous and ill at ease and yet he gave one the impression of a
man whose soul was at rest, who had achieved something which had
been his life's desire. The music of the opera flowed on. The
tenor took the stage, greeted on his appearance by a roar of
long-repressed applause. His attitude seemed curiously
unconvincing. His brows were jerky, his disclaiming gestures
almost the gestures of an irritated man. When there was silence
and he sang, something akin to consternation seemed to seize
upon the audience. It was the same artist, but never the same
music. His voice seemed to have lost value and quality. People
began to shuffle their feet and Colin, himself puzzled, glanced
towards Ann. There was a smile of understanding at the corners
of her lips. Her companion sat with folded arms. His manner had
lost its uneasiness, his pallor was almost unearthly, his
eyes&mdash; half closed&mdash;were fixed upon the stage, his
head moved slightly to the rhythm. Again that smile of content
played about his lips, more meaningless now than ever.</p>

<p>The final curtain fell amidst rounds of somewhat dubious
applause. Colin, wedged in with the crowd who were struggling
towards the exit, found himself at a hopeless disadvantage. Two
or three of the ushers busied themselves in making a clear way
for Ann and her companion. They were already out of sight when
Colin reached the atrium. It was thinly crowded and there was no
sign of either of them. He made his way to the underground
passage and took the lift into the H&ocirc;tel de Paris. He searched
the lounge, still without success. Half mechanically he crossed
the hall and took the passage into the Sporting Club. The Salles
de Jeux were half empty, as was not unusual on opera nights. He
passed on into the bar. In a distant corner, almost invisible,
Ann and her companion of the opera were seated. The place was
otherwise deserted. Colin hesitated. Ann broke off in the midst
of what seemed to be an appeal to her companion and, rising to
her feet, beckoned to him. Colin started eagerly forward. He had
scarcely taken half a dozen steps when he felt himself pushed on
one side. A man who had just entered&mdash;tall and burly,
dressed in the dinner garb of the moment, but with a soft silk
shirt and flowing black tie&mdash;pushed his way past him and
strode across the floor towards the table. Colin caught sight of
something concealed in his hand and took a quick step
forward.</p>

<p>"Look out for this fellow!" he called out to Ann. "He's
carrying a gun or something."</p>

<p>The man swung round and struck an ineffective blow with his
left hand at Colin. In another moment his right wrist was
gripped in a clutch of iron and the weapon which he had been
holding clattered on to the carpet. Colin kicked it away under a
neighbouring table. The newcomer, powerless in, the younger
man's grasp, shouted furiously at Ann's companion.</p>

<p>"Devil!" he cried "Imp of hell! I am ruined forever!"</p>

<p>The man of small stature scowled.</p>

<p>"And I," he rejoined bitterly, "have never faced ruin,
because I have never known success."</p>

<p>"It was a foul plot this!" his aggressor thundered. "You
meant to ruin me, Guido. You have succeeded. I shall never sing
here again. The stage shall know me no more. I shall
disappear."</p>

<p>One of the managers of the room came hurrying up. Two of the
valets were lurking behind him. The former recognised the two
disputants and threw up his hands in consternation.</p>

<p>"Signor Catti!" he exclaimed. "What is all this?"</p>

<p>The famous tenor pointed to Ann's companion.</p>

<p>"You have not heard what happened at the opera?" he
cried.</p>

<p>"We have heard nothing."</p>

<p>Ann leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she begged, "do not alarm yourself. The trouble
is over."</p>

<p>"There shall be no disturbance," Signor Catti promised. "If I
could have met him alone," he went on, pointing to the table,
"when I left the stage tonight I would have killed him! The
moment is past. What is the good?"</p>

<p>He sank into a chair. His face was still distorted with
passion. Something very like tears dimmed his bulbous black
eyes. The official drifted courteously into the background.
Signor Catti was a great man, and if there had been trouble, it
was obvious that a reconciliation was at hand.</p>

<p>"That andante passage," the distracted singer groaned; "it
was marvellous! I can never attempt it again. They would jeer at
me."</p>

<p>The man who was still seated with Ann smiled
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would appreciate that," he said. "What of
the long notes at the end of the phrase?"</p>

<p>"You held them until I thought I should have screamed," the
other muttered, "and all the time the melody grew sweeter. I am
ruined! I am nothing now but a shadow. No one will ever listen
to me again."</p>

<p>"This is only one audience," the man who had drawn music down
from heaven reminded him consolingly. "They will tell their
story. The listeners will believe that they dreamed or that they
had dined too well. They are very fortunate people. They have
heard the Song of the Duke sung as no one else in the world will
ever sing it."</p>

<p>"That is the beginning of a campaign," the other lamented.
"What fault is it of mine? Am I to blame because God gave you
the voice of an angel and the figure of a dwarf?"</p>

<p>The man addressed shivered.</p>

<p>"There will be no campaign," he groaned. "I have pledged my
word to the authorities and those who stand behind them, those
who know how I have suffered, that given this final opportunity,
I would never again sing a note upon the stage."</p>

<p>"I don't want to seem to be butting in," Colin observed
helplessly, "but can I know something of what this is all
about?"</p>

<p>Ann rose to her feet, passed an arm through his and an arm
through her late companion's. Colin had already made use of his
opportunity to secure and conceal in a place of safety the
villainous-looking poignard which the infuriated tenor had been
brandishing.</p>

<p>"We are all going to have supper together&mdash;my cousin
too," Ann announced. "You must know my two friends,
Colin&mdash;Signor Carlo Catti, the famous tenor, and Guido, his
brother. You shall be told the story and understand
everything."</p>

<p>They moved off on their way through the rooms. Signor Catti
mopped his face with a silk handkerchief and sighed with an air
of content. It seemed impossible to believe that a few moments
before he had been seriously contemplating the crime of
fratricide.</p>

<p>"After I have sung," he confided, "I starve. The thought of
supper is good. I will drink a glass of wine with my brother.
Notwithstanding all that lies between us in the past, I shall
seek for a reconciliation."</p>

<p>Colin led the way into the supper-room and selected a
suitable table.</p>

<p>"And now?" he asked, having given Signor Catti carte blanche
with the menu and listened to the ordering of a most amazing
meal. "Perhaps I might&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ann interrupted him with a little pat on the hand. The
strained expression had gone from her face. Nevertheless, when
the sommelier made his welcome appearance, she drank her first
glass of wine without a pause. The two brothers were talking
vigorously together in Italian. She leaned towards Colin.</p>

<p>"You remember," she said, "that I once spent six months at
Milan, long before we met. I had my voice tried. It was useless.
I met these two then. They were both finishing their training.
Guido, as you have heard, has the heavenly voice&mdash;Carlo the
presence."</p>

<p>"It was Guido who sang the Duke's Song tonight?" Colin
exclaimed with sudden enlightenment.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"The stage was specially arranged for him," she confided.
"His heart was nearly broken when he found that there was no
place where he could use that gorgeous voice of his, and three
times he has fallen into a decline. Three times previously this
has happened. It gives him the happiness which keeps him alive.
It has happened at Covent Garden, Paris and in New York. At the
Metropolitan, where they understand the finer shades of music,
there was an uproar. Here they marvel, but they accept. Each
time Carlo, when he hears those notes sung as he could never
sing them, goes crazy. Twice he has tried to kill his brother,
then for days afterwards he weeps. This time it was more than
ever difficult. I came because, although we seldom meet, Carlo
is always at his best with me. When I am there he restrains
himself. To-night he went mad. It is over. Look at
them&mdash;the best of friends. There is no one in the world who
worships Guido as Carlo does, yet I suppose no one could
understand the fire of jealousy that drives him almost to
madness when he hears that song and knows that Guido climbs into
a world which he can never enter."</p>

<p>Colin was holding Ann's hand tightly.</p>

<p>"It is the queerest story I ever heard," he acknowledged,
"but, Ann, you don't know how happy it has made me to hear
it."</p>

<p>"Wait," she begged. "To-night may be a great night. This is
the real explanation of why I am here."</p>

<p>The brothers were seated arm in arm. Carlo rapped on the
table with the handle of his knife. He was a famous man there
and the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel hurried up.</p>

<p>"Supper!" Carlo demanded. "I starve."</p>

<p>"In five minutes the <i>signor</i> shall be served," the man
promised. "May I be forgiven, but I heard the Duke's Song
to-night. No other in the world has ever sung it in such a
fashion."</p>

<p>Carlo indulged in a grimace. His brother pokes him in the
ribs. They were human and natural as two boys.</p>

<p>"There was also a love story," Ann whispered, "and a
misunderstanding. To-night it will be put right."</p>

<p>She beckoned to someone across the room. A girl who was
seated alone rose from her table. She was dressed plainly in
black, her black hair was brushed from her forehead, her dark-blue
eyes were soft as though with coming tears. She looked at
one person&mdash;one person only&mdash;at Guido. Guido stumbled
to his feet. Carlo, with a curious lightninglike instinct of
chivalry, kept his place.</p>

<p>"I have made friends," Ann explained, "with the
<i>signorina</i> in London. She has been working very hard
teaching singing. Perhaps if you ask her she will join us at
supper."</p>

<p>"I will stay," the girl accepted, "if Guido invites me."</p>

<p>His voice seemed to have sunk into tremulous music.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;if Carlo invites you."</p>

<p>She took her place by his side, between him and Ann. She held
his hand and looked into his eyes.</p>

<p>"It is for Guido and Guido only that I will stay. How foolish
you have been all these years!"</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet. For once in his life, at any
rate, he had the dignity of a great man.</p>

<p>"I earn a thousand a year as leader of an orchestra," he told
her. "I shall never earn any more."</p>

<p>"And I," she confided, "give singing lessons at one guinea a
lesson!"</p>

<p>He resumed his seat and her hand was once more in his.</p>

<p>"Together," he sighed peacefully, "we shall find heaven."</p>

<p>Carlo had ceased to listen. He was looking over his shoulder
for the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel.</p>

<p>"They are long with the salad dressing," he complained
impatiently.</p>

<p>Ann smiled across at him.</p>

<p>"Don't disturb yourself, dear master. Everything comes in
time to the man who knows how to wait."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE Duke&mdash;he looked every inch a duke,
although he was lounging straddle-legged with his back to the
fire in the famous library of Muggatradore Castle, although his
tweeds were muddy and his hair wind-tossed&mdash;stood with a
list in his hand which he was studying through his eyeglass. The
Duchess, seated in an easy chair a few yards away, was watching
him with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"H'm," His Grace remarked. "Mostly the old crowd, I see. One
or two of them don't know which end of a gun to shoot with!
Jimmie, for instance, is no earthly good."</p>

<p>"Everybody invites Jimmie, my dear," his wife reminded him
mildly. "Besides, he is your first cousin and his moors almost
march."</p>

<p>"That's all right," her husband agreed, "but there are one or
two here I don't seem to recognise. Who is Mr. James J. Bresson?
Name seems familiar, but I can't place him."</p>

<p>"He is the man Eustace wanted invited, my dear. One of the
most interesting men in Europe, they say. You remember that
famous Greek who was supposed to own whole countries somewhere
in the East&mdash;made great fortunes selling guns whenever
there was a war&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember that chap," the Duke interrupted, "but what
has this fellow Bresson got to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Well, according to Eustace, he has made millions the same
way," the Duchess explained. "Anyhow, Eustace met him in town
and telephoned to know if he might invite him. I can assure you,
Gregory, all our guests will be delighted to meet him. He very
seldom goes anywhere."</p>

<p>"So long as he doesn't want to shoot," the Duke grunted.</p>

<p>"Of course he may shoot if he wants to," his wife observed
placidly. "Half the moors round here are owned by Americans
nowadays, and I remember your saying yourself that that man from
Philadelphia who took your Argyllshire moor one season was the
best man you had ever seen in the butts."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's all right," His Grace agreed. "But here's
another name I don't know. A fellow of the name of Rooke
apparently. Colin Rooke. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Well, he is acting for the moment as Bresson's secretary. He
is a war correspondent and quite a friend of Eustace's."</p>

<p>The Duke thrust the list into the pocket of his loose
coat.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I suppose it's all right," he said. "That
chap Bresson ought to be interesting, at any rate. They say that
if he were ever to write his memoirs several governments would
have to resign. Where are the crowd?"</p>

<p>"There's no one here yet, my dear," the Duchess told him.
"None of the cars are back from the station, and Eustace has
been out with McGregor to look at the butts."</p>

<p>"I'll have my bath and change early, then," the Duke decided.
"Don't let anyone open The Times till I come down."</p>

<p>"There will be several copies," his wife assured him. "I will
put one away especially for you."</p>

<p>"Kilts, I suppose?" the Duke asked, looking back from the
door.</p>

<p>"Of course," she answered. "The McGregors are coming and the
Macraes."</p>

<p>The Duke took his leave. His spouse drew a little sigh of
relief. Sometimes when there were unexpected visitors the master
of Muggatradore was not quite so amenable. She took up her
novel, but put it down again almost at once. There was a call of
bagpipes from the terrace, the signal that the expected guests
were coming through the pass.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">LORD EUSTACE, freckled, sandy-haired, typically
Scotch except for the really humorous mouth and deep-set blue
eyes, led his mother away as soon as he found a chance.</p>

<p>"Tell me about the governor," he begged. "Is he all
right?"</p>

<p>The Duchess smiled.</p>

<p>"He seemed rather interested to have this mysterious Mr.
Bresson here," she confided. "He didn't seem to understand why
he brought a secretary, but anyhow he is quite all right. Your
father is peculiar, but after all, he is not unreasonable. Mr.
Bresson is quite a distinguished looking person, and I rather
like the look of the young man. How did you get to know
him?"</p>

<p>"I met him years ago down in Kenya," Eustace replied, "and I
came across him the other day again really through this fellow
Bresson."</p>

<p>The Duchess wrinkled her forehead. She was a good-looking
woman, but, as she often remarked, she had rather a troublesome
family.</p>

<p>"You haven't one of your wild schemes on, have you, Eustace?"
she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," he laughed.</p>

<p>"No, but seriously," she begged.</p>

<p>The young man looked out from the alcove in which he and his
mother were seated across the lounge to a distant bridge table.
His father, who had the mysterious Mr. Bresson for a partner,
was smoking a cigar and had the air of a man perfectly content
with life. Amongst his other accomplishments, Eustace
recollected with satisfaction, Bresson had the reputation of
being an exceptionally good bridge player.</p>

<p>"There's no question of any wild scheme at all, Mother," he
said thoughtfully. "Bresson has always been a keen big-game shot
and a great collector of heads. There are just two he is short
of and he had fitted out an expedition to go after them very
near the northwestern frontier of North Kenya where my surveying
job is. Things in Europe are so disturbed just now, however,
that he doesn't want to leave, and he has as good as offered me
the job of using his outfit, collecting some stuff he has left
out there and going after those heads for him."</p>

<p>"I certainly don't see anything to which your father could
possibly object in that scheme," the Duchess admitted.</p>

<p>"Of course he couldn't," her son agreed. "Old man Bresson
wanted a bit of humouring, though, so I was anxious to have you
ask him up here. I can show him some heads of my own here which
are pretty rare, and he will meet one or two chaps to-morrow who
can give me a boost up. I don't say I am much good at these
little brown birds with a shotgun, but I'll back myself with a
rifle against most of them."</p>

<p>"Everyone knows how good you are, my dear," the Duchess
purred.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right, Mother," he said. "Only, if anything
comes of it and he offers me the job, don't let the governor get
awkward, will you?"</p>

<p>The Duchess looked across at her very handsome spouse and
smiled.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she remarked, "that he has already taken a
fancy to your friend. I cannot imagine that there would be the
slightest difficulty. Now, Eustace, I think you ought to go and
dance. Mary will be looking out for you, and the Macrae girls
hate being left out."</p>

<p>He rose with a little grimace.</p>

<p>"What a matchmaking mamma you are, old dear," he smiled,
gazing towards the distant ballroom. "I warn you, though girls
are all very well in their place, that the fun of the evening is
going to commence for me when you other people are getting your
beauty sleep."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE fun of the evening duly commenced at a
little before midnight in Lord Eustace's sitting-room. A footman
had seen to it that there was an ample supply of anything likely
to be needed in the way of whisky, cigars and cigarettes. Mr.
James J. Bresson, a tall, thin man, handsome in a somewhat
ascetic fashion, was comfortably established in an easy chair
with his favourite drink&mdash;whisky and water&mdash;by his
side, and his pipe in his mouth. Colin Rooke, who could scarcely
conceal his eagerness, was seated a few feet in the background,
and the host himself was sprawling over the table upon which a
large map was spread open. Mr. Bresson looked speculatively at
his two companions.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much you two young men know about me?" he said.
"I mean, apart from these silly stories in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"I don't know much," Eustace confessed frankly.</p>

<p>"I know the usual tosh about your being the mystery man of
the world, that you are able when it pleases you to finance
governments, that in many of the smaller wars you have supplied
both sides with all the arms and munitions they required, and
that you have built up a gigantic fortune chiefly by being in
the position to supply armaments and sometimes even an odd
battleship just at the moment it was required."</p>

<p>Mr. Bresson smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"I never meddle much with battleships," he observed, glancing
for a moment at one of his fingernails which seemed to displease
him. "Of course, there was that Greek cruiser&mdash; But I
forget, we are not here to gossip. I need the help of two young
men, one of whom should be a journalist and have the necessary
qualifications to become a war correspondent, and the other with
connections in Kenya. It is possible that you two might serve my
purpose."</p>

<p>"Down to the ground, I should think," Eustace observed. "I
have a job in Kenya at the present moment, and Rooke here has
been a journalist all his life, and has his papers for Abyssinia
in case there is any trouble there."</p>

<p>"Sounds all right," Bresson assented. "Now listen, you two,
and I will talk about myself for a moment or two&mdash;a thing I
don't often do. There isn't anything very mysterious about James
J. Bresson except that sometimes I can scarcely realise how much
money I have actually made in a queer sort of way. But let that
go. What I have done is to travel almost without ceasing and to
watch the politics of the different countries I have visited. I
can nearly always spot a country where a war is likely to take
place. I then buy guns, rifles, Maxims, ammunition in different
countries, and have them consigned to different ports. I then
concentrate them and find a hiding-place&mdash;perhaps I should
say a secret store&mdash;if possible in a neutral country, but
quite close to where the fighting is likely to take place. Then
when war breaks out I am there with the goods, and three hundred
per cent profit is a trifle to what I have cleared once or
twice. I am not going to give away too much of my business, but
the whole world was wondering a few years ago where Japan got
those marvellous rifles of hers and all those field-guns. I
knew, because I had had them stored up for her some five or six
years in a couple of old battleships I bought for a song. Are
you boys interested?"</p>

<p>"I should say we are," Lord Eustace declared.</p>

<p>Bresson helped himself to whisky, poured in the requisite
amount of water, knocked out his pipe and slowly refilled
it.</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to talk to you now only about the case in
which we are interested. After Adowa I took care to pay a visit
to Abyssinia. I did a little business there&mdash;nothing to
speak of, but I got rid of some old stuff I had lying about in
Turkey. Not so very long ago I paid another visit there and
since then I have been pretty busy. Do you happen to know
anything about Lake Rudolf, Lord Eustace?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," the latter replied. "It is up in the
northwest corner of Kenya."</p>

<p>"Well, there are very few people outside Kenya who have ever
heard of it," Bresson continued. "It is a dreary stretch of
water and as hot as hell. The top part of the lake, though, is
in Abyssinian territory, and somewhere near that territory,
either on the lake or hidden near it, there are enough arms and
Maxim guns to keep the Abyssinians in good shape for a
time."</p>

<p>"My God!" Eustace exclaimed. "Where did they come from?"</p>

<p>"Well, some of them came from the Germans," Bresson confided.
"That's a chapter of secret history for you that scarcely a
living man except myself knows, but when the Germans gave up the
fight in their little bit of East Africa they sold the whole of
their reserve stock of guns and munitions, and as I am the only
man alive in that sort of business, they sold it to me. It took
some getting through and round Kenya and up to the lake, but we
managed it somehow. Then, of course, those were not all stores
that we had to have four hundred natives for when I crossed
Kenya from the sea. There were other ways, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those legends of the mammoth bats in the sky," Eustace
interrupted. "We used to put all that native talk down to their
priests."</p>

<p>"If you were to drain Lake Rudolf".' Bresson told them, "you
would find half a dozen derelicts. All the same, for half a
dozen we lost&mdash;and they were heavyweight carriers,
too&mdash;thirty or forty of them did the trick. Anyway, the
stuff's there, and I'm going to sell it to Abyssinia."</p>

<p>"Are we coming into this?" Colin Rooke asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"You are if you want to take it on," Bresson promised,
speaking a little more seriously. "I don't mind telling you it
will take hours to give you all the details of what has to be
done&mdash;and there are risks. The country where the stuff is
hidden is, for one thing, scarcely habitable for human beings. I
have been there and I know. There's only one way of moving that
stuff up to the north end of the lake, and that is on a kind of
raft I have had made with an outboard motor. When you are once
up the north end of the lake the native Abyssinians can take
care of the rest. It is only a few hundred miles to the
capital."</p>

<p>"Tell me," Colin Rooke asked, "supposing you bring it off and
deliver the goods, how do you know Abyssinia will ever be able
to pay for them?"</p>

<p>Bresson's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"That's a good Anglo-Saxon question," he observed. "You don't
need to trouble about that, though. That's my little secret. All
I need say to you two is&mdash;if Lord Eustace here helps me to
get one more of my sporting expeditions through the colony, and
you, Mr. Rooke, keep in touch with the Abyssinian government
through your job as war correspondent, you will get your money
whether I am paid or not."</p>

<p>"How much?" Eustace asked pleasantly but bluntly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bresson smiled. He glanced at the clock, finished his
whisky and water and knocked out his pipe.</p>

<p>"You may be a Duke's son all right, Lord Eustace," he said,
"but you are a good Scotchman all the same. Thirty thousand each
is what you will touch&mdash;and you will get most of your
instructions from me, never mind how. If you are on, you must
arrange somehow or other to give me an hour or two in London not
later than Wednesday. I've got to have a little conversation
with the government at Addis Ababa before the fun starts, and I
have planned to take Thursday's plane to Khartoum. Like to sleep
on it, my young friends?"</p>

<p>"No need," Eustace declared. "I'm on."</p>

<p>"So am I," Colin Rooke echoed heartily.</p>

<p>Bresson looked at the two young men with keen, steely
eyes.</p>

<p>"Remember," he warned them, "at the best there's risk. I am
going up with the expedition as far as Lake Rudolf myself, so I
shan't be much better off than Lord Eustace here, but if our
friends get a-swotting too soon and your share in this business
gets out, Mr. Rooke, you may be in worse trouble than either of
us."</p>

<p>Colin smiled. His silence was in itself eloquent.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">NEVER before had a visitor appeared in the Hall
of the Kings at Addis Ababa in such a condition. Colin Rooke,
his clothes almost stripped from his back, his cheeks long and
gaunt, his face unshaven, his steps feeble, was almost dragged
by the two tall negroes in their magnificent uniforms to the
steps of the small throne. Its occupant frowned.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>There was a confusion of voices. Colin, with trembling
fingers, produced the document he had been zealously guarding.
The King motioned the guard to place him in the chair of
audience and called to another servant. Then he turned to his
visitor.</p>

<p>"One comes who English speaks," he announced.</p>

<p>Again the babel of tongues. The King waved his hand and his
entourage fell back. Colin Rooke touched his lips, opened his
mouth. The King understood. The exhausted traveller began to
wonder whether the whole thing was some fantastic dream when
from a magnificent silver salver he was handed a bottle of White
Label whisky, a common public-house tumbler and a siphon of
soda-water! Colin forgot that he was seated in the presence of a
monarch; he forgot everything except that raging thirst, that
sinking inside. He half filled the tumbler with whisky, filled
it to the brim with soda and drank.</p>

<p>"Where come?" the King asked.</p>

<p>"Lake Rudolf," Colin answered.</p>

<p>The King looked at him as one might look at a madman. At that
moment there was a disturbance at the door. A girl in European
costume save for the shawl around her shoulders, followed by two
women-in-waiting, presented herself. Colin half rose to his
feet. The girl looked into his eyes. She was dark of complexion,
but she had features which might have belonged to a high-class
English Jewess. Her voice, when her lips moved, was like magic.
She spoke English as though it were her own tongue, and to Colin
it was almost as marvellous as the drink which had set life
singing through his veins.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" she asked. "My father is puzzled. How
did you get here? We do not understand. There has been no train
for two days."</p>

<p>Colin felt his head swimming.</p>

<p>"Listen," he begged. "I have eaten nothing for many days, and
then I killed a man for what I stole. Now I have drunk. Some
bread&mdash;anything! Can't you see that I am starving?"</p>

<p>"You poor man," she sympathised. "Food shall come. Wait for a
few minutes before you try to speak."</p>

<p>She gave orders. A file of servants disappeared. The King sat
immovable. The girl talked to him. Then she turned to Colin.</p>

<p>"My father does not understand," she explained. "He speaks a
very little English, but he has never left our country. I have
been to Paris and England. I understand. You shall have
something to eat directly."</p>

<p>For the first time in history food, bread and fruit chiefly,
was served on the little table which stood in front of the
visitor at audience. Colin Rooke ate and all the time he watched
the girl as she watched him. In ten minutes he rose and bowed.
He drank more of the whisky.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty!" he said</p>

<p>The King smiled. He waved his hand. The table was
cleared.</p>

<p>"If you are the King's daughter," Colin asked the
interpretress, "may I call you Princess?"</p>

<p>"I am the Princess Zola," she acknowledged simply.</p>

<p>"I am an emissary of that great man James J. Bresson," Colin
Rooke announced. "Within a hundred miles of the capital here we
have a great store of guns of every sort and hundreds of boxes
of ammunition. There are more behind on the rafts we have
brought up from Lake Rudolf."</p>

<p>The Princess looked at him with fixed eyes.</p>

<p>"You speak the truth?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I speak the truth as God is my witness," he answered.</p>

<p>She turned to the King and told him the news. Servants were
running here and there. From across the square ministers came
hurrying in, followed by men in uniform. All for a time was
confusion.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Rooke asked, clutching the Princess by the arm,
"is it war yet?"</p>

<p>"No war has been declared," she told him. "At the last moment
they said that Italy was listening to words from America. We do
not fear war if we have the means of defence. If we have those,
we can at least fight in dignity. Sit and rest. These are
members of the King's Council whom you see taking their seats
with my father. They will decide how best to deal with your
message. They want to know&mdash;they are all asking&mdash;how
near is the first convoy?"</p>

<p>Colin Rooke pointed out of the huge oval window.</p>

<p>"On the other side of the mountain," he declared. "From there
back to the north end of the lake is one long trail. We had a
thousand mules, but half of them have perished. Once in the
hills all was well, but down on the plain what water we brought
from the lake soon went and the wells were dry. In an
hour&mdash; two hours&mdash;I shall be ready to show you the
place where my convoys are waiting for help. Plenty of
mules&mdash;horses if you have them&mdash;there are a few motor
lorries I saw on the outskirts of the city&mdash;everything that
can bring merchandise."</p>

<p>The King spoke and his daughter nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"My father," she told Colin, "says that you must rest here in
the Palace for some hours, then you must go back with the
expedition which we are preparing. You can ride in a car for
thirty miles and after that there shall be mules."</p>

<p>Rooke staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"To sleep will be Paradise," he muttered.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">HE awoke into a world which it seemed to him
must be one of sheer fantasy. He was lying on a low couch in a
large and airy tent. A cool wind was blowing on to his face, his
limbs were no longer hot. He was clad in soft underwear and
linen riding-clothes. On either side of him was a tall Ethiopian
soldier standing motionless. Through the opening of the tent was
another slimmer figure standing as though on guard, and beyond a
deep-blue sky, clear and starlit.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he demanded.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the figure outside turned round. A
big lantern was lit in front of the tent. It was the King's
daughter, in riding-clothes of European cut, with a shawl
wrapped round her shoulders, bareheaded, with jet-black hair
from which flashed many jewels, who smiled in upon him.</p>

<p>"You are already thirty miles upon the way southwards," she
told him. "We have a hospital in the capital where they took
care of you and you have on clothes belonging to one of the
young English attach&eacute;s. No, you need not be afraid," she added
quickly; "they know nothing of your errand. Tell me&mdash;you
feel better?"</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," he confessed.</p>

<p>Servants gathered round. By the light of the lantern outside
a feast was spread upon the rocks. She sat down opposite, served
him and ate with him. There was wine which she
drank&mdash;champagne of a well-known brand. He shook his head
as the servant passed him the bottle.</p>

<p>"This air is getting a little heady for me," he said. "I'll
stick to the whisky."</p>

<p>"We have a trail of pack-mules now reaching for miles," she
recounted. "There are some lorries, too, but they are on ahead.
We will ride with the dawn and by night we shall be up with some
of your people. Shall we see that strange American&mdash;Mr.
Bresson?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Who cares?" he replied.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"He is a very nice man&mdash;Mr. Bresson," she said. "It is
he who will have saved my country."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it," Rooke protested. "If anyone saves
you, it will be Geneva."</p>

<p>"There were rumours yesterday," she confided, "that America
had sent a message to Italy. It will not matter now. If your
guns are good and there is plenty of ammunition, perhaps it is
better that we fight. I am to ride with the army. Did you know
that I was a soldier?"</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," he answered. "Nothing will ever
surprise me again after this supper with a Princess of Abyssinia
on the edge of a precipice, in the midst of a silence which is
almost like the silence of eternity."</p>

<p>"You would like me to sing to you?" she asked. "Ah, but
look&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pointed eastward with her finger. He saw the long white
shaft of light through the purple clouds.</p>

<p>"Soon the sun will come from there," she said; "then we must
start. You wish for cigarettes? There are all makes here."</p>

<p>One of the soldiers of the expedition came and talked to the
Princess. He addressed her with the deepest reverence, one knee
bent. She waved him away with a word of approval.</p>

<p>"We ride in two hours," she announced. "Go back and sleep if
you will. To-morrow there are many things I have to ask
you."</p>

<p>Colin staggered back to his couch.</p>

<p>"To-morrow will be another day," he muttered....</p>

<p>There was no more sleep for him that night, only a troubled
doze in a world of fantasies. The cool mountain breeze played
around his head. Every now and then he caught the faint
fragrance of strange plants and herbage growing out of the
clefts of the volcanic mountains. His two guards, massive and
imposing figures, stood motionless outside the tent. The girl
had gone. Once in that doze he fancied that he heard soft
footsteps upon the rush matting which had been strewn on the
floor of the tent, he even fancied that through his flickering
eyelids he caught a glimpse of a strong, fierce face with a
woman's lips, soft yet passion-stirred black eyes. There might
almost have been a sound of quick breathing. He closed his eyes
a little tighter. The perfume must be coming from some flowers
in the valley. He lay quite still, fighting in his doze against
the urge of breathless curiosity. He kept them closed until it
seemed to him that a puff of wind from outside had brought with
it the faint murmur of a sigh.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ONCE again, in very different guise, Colin sat
in the chair of audience on the other side of the round table.
Black-bearded, dark, majestic, the King Emperor of Abyssinia sat
upon his throne. In the background stood a strange interpreter,
a young man who had served his days of scholarship at Harvard
and Oxford, whose English was glib and whose speech was
curiously punctuated with some of the affectations of the
West.</p>

<p>"His Majesty desires me," he said, addressing Colin, "to
offer you this thanks for your great work, the work of your
colleague in Kenya, and the brains of your master, the great
American, Bresson, which have been of service to His Majesty and
our distressed country. We have arms which we never hoped to
possess. Our soldiers are cheered with a new confidence."</p>

<p>"I am glad that all has turned out so well," Colin declared.
"You will explain to His Majesty, if you please, that as a
neutral I must remain dumb, although I hope to see much of the
fighting if fighting there be."</p>

<p>The interpreter spoke for a moment to his august master, who
answered him in several brief sentences. Then the former turned
once more to Colin.</p>

<p>"The money for the arms," he went on, "is deposited in the
name of Mr. James J. Bresson in the Bank of England in London.
There is also a sum of sixty thousand pounds to be divided, we
understand, between you and your helper in Kenya. Beyond that,
Mr. Rooke, what I have to say will, I fear, not be so pleasant.
I regret to announce that His Majesty is not able to accept your
position as war correspondent for your great English
newspaper."</p>

<p>Colin stared at the speaker, for a moment, wordless.</p>

<p>"His Majesty may have his own reasons," the young man
continued, "but he begs that you will accept them without demur.
The railway is still running, accommodation has been reserved
for you in the train. It only awaits your arrival at the depot
to depart. He wishes you a safe and happy journey to
England."</p>

<p>The protest died away on Colin's lips. He rose to his feet
with bowed head.</p>

<p>"One moment," the interpreter begged. "His Majesty speaks a
few words of English. He desires to speak his farewell to you.
Afterwards you will join me in the anteroom."</p>

<p>The young man took his leave. Colin remained upon his feet,
but his head was raised. He waited for the Emperor's words. Soon
they came&mdash;slowly spoken, chosen as though with difficulty
from a very limited vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Young Englishman," he said, "Abyssinia thanks you, its
monarch thanks you for a great feat. Whether indeed this war
comes or not you will have taken from it some of the nausea of
massacre. You come of a race we have always honoured. From this
hour forward I, the King, will honour it even more. You have
shown the courage of a lion&mdash;our favourite beast&mdash;and
the honour of a great gentleman. You will accept&mdash;"</p>

<p>The King leaned forward, unfolded his clasped hands and
whispered a single word....</p>

<p>Colin found himself presently in the anteroom, found himself
driving in a crazy Ford through that strange medley of streets
with open shops and rancid smells, through a modern square, and
back again through the semi-Oriental, semi-barbaric slough of
the native quarter. Not until he found himself in a modern
railway carriage of familiar type, with wine, fruit, cigarettes
and flowers on the small table in front of him, not indeed until
the train had started its long journey across the jolting way,
did he remove his left hand from his right and realise that he
was wearing the Emperor's signet ring.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ANN, leaning forward in the boat and pulling in
her line with vociferous exclamations of pleasure, was surprised
at the sudden inertness of the boatman who was seated a few feet
away with the helm under his arm. She glanced at him in
surprise. His pale, vividly blue eyes were fixed on the summit
of the rocky cliffs underneath which they were passing.</p>

<p>"Michael," she exclaimed. "Look! A fish!"</p>

<p>Mechanically but with swift fingers the boatman pulled at the
few remaining yards of line, unhooked the mackerel, threw it
into the bucket, rearranged the bait and dropped the lead once
more into the water. Then he looked back to the summit of the
towering cliffs.</p>

<p>"This was the very spot," he recounted softly. "This is where
I did lie and see it all. I was sand-eeling. I see the big man
come out of the bungalow and creep up to the other who was
wandering about on the edge of the cliffs. I saw them struggling
for a minute and I saw the body of one of 'em come down the
cliffs there, bumping from ledge to ledge secretary-servant&mdash;
who looked after him, miss," the boatman told her,
"a man near upon his own age, I should say. They favoured one
another so that I could never tell the one from the other. He
went away only two days before. He got a passage on one of they
French fishing boats that put in."</p>

<p>"Anyone lived in the bungalow since?" Colin Rooke
enquired.</p>

<p>The man shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Sark folk are a bit peculiar that way," he confided. "We
don't have much in the way of quarrels and fighting on the
island and a killing like this is a thing that has scarcely ever
been known. No one ain't had no liking for the bungalow. I'm
fancying if it suited you the Dame would not be particular about
the rent. Pretty clever of they police running the man down what
did it. Did you ever read the case, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I read it," Colin admitted.</p>

<p>"He would have hung sure enough, would that man, but for
Michael there," the boatman went on.</p>

<p>"How was that?" Colin asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Why, when he gave his evidence," the boatman recounted, "he
spoke of seeing the two sway about on the edge of the cliff, and
if it was that sort of a quarrel, why, either of them might have
lost his footing and there was just enough of accident about it
to make it manslaughter, but the doctor he fancied there were
signs of the man having been shot in the head. There warn't much
left of his head but when Michael here was asked the question he
said yes, he fancied he had heard a shot and then there was them
in Court as had known him since he was a boy and they all told
the tale that Michael was stone-deaf. They tried him in
Court&mdash;fired off a revolver behind a screen and Michael he
never heard it!"</p>

<p>"I could hear all right that night," Michael muttered. "I can
hear all right now."</p>

<p>"Harken to 'im!" the other jeered. "It ain't sense that you
could hear one night and not another. Anyway, the Jurats didn't
think so. A quarrel was a likely enough affair seeing as the two
had been together in business. Twenty years he got and that's
enough for most men&mdash;him being over forty. Shift a little
more over towards they gulls, Michael."</p>

<p>The man turned his helm obediently. Over his shoulder,
however, he looked back at the towering cliff. For some short
time his lips moved silently.</p>

<p>"Our second cousin twice removed, or whatever he may have
been," Colin remarked, as he stood with Ann's arm through his at
the edge of the grassy slope in front of the bungalow, "had an
eye for beauty."</p>

<p>"It's too marvellous," she murmured.</p>

<p>Behind them was a patchwork wilderness of common still aflush
with yellow gorse and deep patches of heather. Below, at a giddy
distance almost a sheer fall, the sea was booming into the caves
and crevices and drenching the rocks with spray&mdash;deep blue,
white-crested and heavy with the swirl of the incoming tide. The
odour of it, strong and sweet, came to them with an almost
intoxicating twang. They stood there for a moment or two almost
breathless after their climb. The gulls floated lazily about
their heads. The loneliness of the place was almost disturbing.
Ann looked over her shoulder with a sigh.</p>

<p>"It's funny, Colin, isn't it?" she observed. "I rather hate
the idea of going inside that bungalow."</p>

<p>"It's ugly enough," he remarked carelessly. "So long as we're
here, though, we must have a look inside. Let's get it
over."</p>

<p>It was a bungalow like all other bungalows with ordinary
fittings and cheap timber. It was bare of any attempt at
decoration, spotlessly clean, unsuggestive, depressing. They
wandered from room to room listlessly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad the furniture is gone," Ann shivered "One cannot
picture what it was like that night."</p>

<p>"Not a thing left that belonged to the poor fellow," Colin
observed. "That's natural enough, though. The lawyers had
everything sold up&mdash;the few things there were. They went
into our estate. About two hundred pounds' worth of furniture I
believe there was."</p>

<p>They wandered into the scullery and out by the back door.
Fixed close to the wall was a small zinc receptacle for rubbish.
Colin, stirred by the idlest of curiosity, turned over the
fragments of torn paper and cigarette-ends with his stick.
Suddenly Ann pointed downwards.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a letter there?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Looks like it," he admitted.</p>

<p>He stooped down and gingerly drew out an envelope. He rubbed
it on the grass and held it up.</p>

<p>"It's a letter all right," he exclaimed, "and it's never been
opened."</p>

<p>Ann leaned over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"It's addressed to our benefactor, too," she pointed out. "A
foreign postmark. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Looks like Ecuador. To Mr. Desmond Rooke, The North Cliff
Bungalow, Isle of Sark, Channel Islands!"</p>

<p>"Well, we have as much right to it as anyone else," Ann
observed. "We are two of the Rooke legatees. Let's open it. I'm
curious."</p>

<p>Colin hesitated.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," he reflected. "If we sent it up to Eastman he
would open it on behalf of all of us. Rather taking it upon
ourselves, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she laughed. "It's probably only an
advertisement. Come on&mdash;open it."</p>

<p>Colin did as he was bidden. There was an enclosure which he
kept between his fingers. The letter was dated from an hotel in
Quito. His tone, as he commenced to read, was only mildly
interested. The note of tragedy crept into it later.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Nathaniel</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I hope you are well, still enjoying the
beautiful island of Sark and living in the dignified seclusion
which belongs to your new personality. At any rate you are your
own master now and if you have bought all the books you were
talking about you must be getting quite a clever fellow.</p>

<p class="letter">This is a marvellous country and my luck seems
to have held. Knowing what a careful fellow you are I am quite
sure that you have not spent the money I left you, but I have
sent you another cheque on Barclays which I expect you can cash
at the branch in Sark.</p>

<p class="letter">If I were you I should buy a boat and take to
fishing. The fishermen down in the port will put you in the way
of it and it should keep you amused. You know I am a rich man
and you can accept the cheque without any fear of robbing
me.</p>

<p class="letter">I rather smile as I address this letter to
myself but I suppose you are still living under my honoured
name. I may be coming over on business before very long but I
will give you plenty of notice and you can if you like come back
to me again if your health permits. That doctor chap in Harley
Street seemed to me a trifle gloomy but the rest may work
wonders for you.</p>

<p class="letter">I hope none of those swine in the City have
been bothering you in any way. I made money with them but I'm
sorry I ever joined up.</p>

<p class="letter">You can write me if you like to the
correspondent of Barclays Bank here. Don't forget the agreed-upon
address.</p>

<p class="letter">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Desmond Rooke</span></p>

<br>

<p>Colin turned his head to find Ann staring up into his face
with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"What in God's name is the meaning of that, Colin?" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if I know," he replied.</p>

<p>He opened out the slip of paper. It was a cheque for five
hundred pounds payable to Bearer and signed Desmond Rooke. The
handwriting was without a doubt the same as the letter.</p>

<p>"There is just one thing&mdash;no, let me think it
out&mdash;" Ann began.</p>

<p>"There's one thing," Colin interrupted grimly, "that doesn't
need much thinking out."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that Desmond Rooke isn't dead. He is still alive and
in Ecuador."</p>

<p>"And what about the money we inherited?"</p>

<p>Colin drew a long breath. He threw open the door.</p>

<p>"Let's go down to that rock and sit in the sunshine," he
proposed. "I'm dizzy."</p>

<p>They sat outside in the warm sunshine and the sparkling
aromatic air. Ann was suddenly a very practical person. She took
no note of the sapphire sea below or the beauty of their
surroundings. She asked grim and pertinent questions.</p>

<p>"What shall we have to do, Colin, about the money we
inherited?"</p>

<p>"I imagine," he admitted, "we may have to return it. In our
case, remember, it won't be so bad. I haven't spent a penny of
the thirty thousand pounds I got for the Abyssinian job. But
what about the others? I can't believe that Aunt Grace makes
anything out of that guest-house. She's lending money to the
people all the time. And as for Percy, I don't imagine his
business is worth much. I should think Phillip will be all
right," he concluded. "Phillip is having fortnightly art sales
now&mdash;cutting a great splash advertising."</p>

<p>"He may be doing that on his capital, I suppose," Ann
observed. "I'm afraid that you and I are the only ones who
really won't be hurt. What are you going to do with that five
hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>He placed it in his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Give it up to Eastman," he replied. "He can take care of it
until we get to the bottom of this business. You haven't minded
being a Rooke legatee, have you, Ann?"</p>

<p>"I've loved it," she answered. "If necessary we must help the
others too. They have had a wonderful time even if they haven't
been as lucky as we have."</p>

<p>The reception clerk at the offices of Messrs. Eastman &amp;
Pelligrew showed distinct signs of an unusual curiosity in his
parchmentlike, expressionless face as he glanced at the cards
which were handed to him a few mornings later. His manner,
however, was suave and noncommittal.</p>

<p>"Sir George will see you at once," he announced. "Will you be
so good as to follow me?"</p>

<p>This time Colin and Ann were led straight upstairs to the
very dignified apartment which was the headquarters of Sir
George himself. The latter rose to his feet as the clerk
announced them.</p>

<p>"Miss Ann Rooke and Mr. Colin Rooke, sir, by
appointment."</p>

<p>He departed, closing the door behind him. Sir George shook
hands with his clients and motioned them to chairs. They looked
at him curiously. This was a very different Sir George from the
man, so benign and consequential, whom they remembered upon a
former visit.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he muttered as though talking to himself. "I
remember you both, of course. Rooke. I don't mind confessing,"
he went on, "that the very name gives me&mdash;er&mdash;a
sensation of bewilderment."</p>

<p>"We have had a pretty bad shock ourselves," Colin
observed.</p>

<p>Sir George buried his face for a moment in his hands.</p>

<p>"Not so bad as I have had," he groaned. "Even now I can't see
my way clearly. You look like nice pleasant ordinary young
people. How on earth did you, I wonder, happen to be cursed with
the name of Rooke?"</p>

<p>"Cursed!" Ann exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It has done us all right up till now, sir," Colin
ventured.</p>

<p>The lawyer rose to his feet and both his young visitors were
conscious of a sense of shock. His dignified carriage had gone.
He had acquired a stoop. There were faint indications of a pouch
underneath his eyes. He was certainly thinner and his voice had
lost that unctuous roll.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he begged. "I have just drafted a letter to
you two and to the others. Would you like to see a copy?"</p>

<p>Colin pulled a wry face.</p>

<p>"I expect we can guess what you have to tell us, sir. Mr.
Desmond Rooke who left us our money isn't dead after all. My
cousin and I have just come back from Sark," he continued,
laying down the letter and cheque upon the desk. "In a rubbish
heap outside the bungalow where the murdered man had been living
we found this communication. Considering ourselves as legatees
we opened it. You will see it is written by Mr. Rooke himself
and he encloses a cheque for the man whom he had left behind to
impersonate him&mdash;the man who was thrown over the cliff and
buried as Desmond Rooke."</p>

<p>Sir George adjusted his spectacles and read the letter word
by word. He examined the cheque and turned it over half a dozen
times. Then he laid it a little helplessly upon his desk.</p>

<p>"You have had your blow softened for you," he observed.</p>

<p>"What do you know about our relative in Ecuador who isn't
dead?" Colin asked eagerly. "And what about the man who is in
prison doing twenty years for killing him?" Ann demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, the man killed someone or other, didn't he?" the
lawyer exclaimed irritably. "He helps to complicate things, of
course. Killed the wrong man, that's all he did, or the right
man&mdash;I don't know which."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say there's a chance that Desmond Rooke is
dead after all?" Ann broke in.</p>

<p>"I don't know who's dead and who isn't," Sir George snapped
out. "I have had so many shocks about this affair that it has
seriously affected my health. If I had anyone here whom I could
trust I should like to close my doors to everyone whose name
even began with an R and go up to the Hebrides for a month!"</p>

<p>"Has Rooke, or shall I say has the corpse, been here in
person?" Colin demanded.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Sir George assented drearily. "I have talked to
someone who seems to have every right to the money&mdash;at
least he would have if I didn't know him to be someone
else."</p>

<p>The young man opened his lips to ask another question but the
lawyer's expression deterred him.</p>

<p>"This seems to be a matter which requires a little clear
reflection," he remarked instead.</p>

<p>Sir George's long nervous fingers were playing with the ink
bottle. For a single second Colin wondered whether to dodge the
threatened missile.</p>

<p>"About that communication we are to receive," Ann ventured
smoothly.</p>

<p>"Don't you Rooke legatees have monthly or weekly or half-yearly
dinners or something?" the lawyer asked.</p>

<p>"We do," Ann admitted. "At somewhat irregular intervals
lately. One is due now. Would you like to come to it?"</p>

<p>Sir George glared at her.</p>

<p>"I am coming to it," he said. "The corpse, as you allude to
him, insists upon being host and explaining this affair&mdash;if
any mortal man can explain it. You are to be at the Pinafore
Room in the Savoy Saturday night at a quarter past eight."</p>

<p>"That sounds better," Ann declared cheerfully.</p>

<p>"If he's giving us a dinner perhaps he is not going to take
our money back."</p>

<p>"Sounds all right to me," Colin agreed. "Are you letting the
others know?"</p>

<p>"They are receiving an official invitation," the lawyer
confided. "Unofficially, kindly remember this. I am going out of
town until a quarter past eight on Saturday night when I shall
arrive at the Savoy Hotel. If you or any other persons bearing
your name come here to ask me for explanations before then they
will come on a useless errand. Thank heavens I am learning to
control myself. That isn't what I should have said an hour
ago!"</p>

<p>"Poor Sir George," Ann murmured with one of her wonderful
glances. "What a shame you have been so bothered about us. Never
mind, I expect it will all come right. I shouldn't wonder if you
didn't get more costs out of the corpse!"</p>

<p>"In any case," Colin observed, "we have had a unique
experience. I have never spent money before from a legacy left
by a live man."</p>

<p>"And I have never proved the will of one or wound up his
estate," Sir George remarked, a little more in his usual manner.
"Now," he added, ringing the bell on his desk, "I am going to
ask you to leave me. You must forgive me for having received you
in somewhat informal fashion. As a matter of fact the supreme
shock of all only arrived just before you came."</p>

<p>Ann moved a little nearer to his desk.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like to tell us all about it, would you, Sir
George?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"Go to&mdash;. Hazelton, will you show Miss Rooke and Mr.
Rooke out," the lawyer enjoined, changing his voice with an
effort as the door opened. "Good morning to both of you."</p>

<p>"Till Saturday night at a quarter past eight," Ann said with
a backward glance and a wave of the hand. "I hope I sit next to
you, Sir George."</p>

<p>"To me," Colin declared as they walked down the dusty stairs
arm in arm, "things seem to be looking a trifle brighter."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"FOR the love of Mike!" Colin exclaimed in a
tone of blank astonishment as he came to a standstill halfway
across the little reception room. "Why, it's Mr. Bresson! What
on earth are you doing here, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. James J. Bresson, very spruce in his well-cut evening
clothes and wearing a white gardenia in the buttonhole of his
tail-coat, shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not so much of that Mr. Bresson, if you please, young
fellow," he begged, "and if this is another of this is the sort
of environment I would always choose for an explanation."</p>

<p>"I suppose," the mysterious host reflected, "I have made
matters a trifle complicated for some of you. Never mind, we'll
have the explanations over before we finish the caviare. Good
health to all of us who are Rookes and to Sir George, who
isn't," he went on with his dry little smile. "Never thought of
meeting you in the flesh, but there it is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Percy Rooke suddenly paused in the act of drinking her
cocktail.</p>

<p>"What about that poor fellow who is doing twenty years for
manslaughter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, he's getting what he deserved," her new-found relative
pointed out. "He threw someone over the cliff all right, only it
wasn't the man he thought."</p>

<p>"Grace was always a sentimentalist," Phillip Rooke declared,
taking a second glass from the tray. "I'm jolly glad to see you,
sir, even if you haven't walked back from the grave. What I
would like to know is this. We have been called the Rooke
legatees for I don't know how long, we have had dinners and
drunk a silent toast to you and, damn it all, we have spent your
money or a good part of it. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If that matter is troubling any of you," the host of the
gathering interrupted, "wash it out. You see those five small
caskets?"</p>

<p>He pointed to five very attractive boxes which stood upon the
table, fashioned of walnut wood and tied up with ribbon.</p>

<p>"One for each of you. For the legal side of it you must trust
to Sir George here. He has had a paper prepared which I have
signed and you will find it inside setting the matter straight.
Actually I am alive. Legally I am dead. Sir George has seen to
that all right. Your legacies are untouchable and, having found
such a pleasant lot of relatives," he concluded, "if any of you
have had bad luck with your legacies, well, we will have a chat
about it after dinner."</p>

<p>"We haven't got to return anything?" Mr. Percy Rooke faltered
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Not a penny, my cousin," the other assured him. "Get it well
into your heads that I am still dead and you've got your legacy.
By the time you have seen what a corpse can do to a spot of
caviare and a drop of vodka you will understand the matter
better. Sir George, what about moving in? Our friend the ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel seems anxious."</p>

<p>"One more question," Ann begged. "Who was thrown into the
sea?"</p>

<p>For a moment Desmond Rooke looked grave.</p>

<p>"His name was Nathaniel Watson," he confided. "He had been my
secretary for years. He was an idle, pleasant, shiftless sort of
creature but he had one thing which made him the most wonderful
secretary in the world for me. He and I were as much alike as
twin peas. I could have sent him anywhere in my place and often
did. When I received the cable to go out to Ecuador we had just
settled down for a few months' quiet living in Sark where I went
to get away from certain complications in the City. I put it to
him that he might have a call from a very angry man connected
with 'Investments Limited,' all sorts of disagreeable things
might happen to him until they discovered his real personality,
but there was a thousand pounds for him if he liked to sit tight
till I came back. I signed a will at my lawyers', leaving all
the money that stood in my name at 'Investments Limited' to such
legatees as could be found, and although I never thought one of
that black-coated, smug little gang of swindlers would ever have
had the pluck to lay a hand upon him, I told him of the risk. He
only laughed at that. Very likely he realised what I
knew&mdash;that he had only a year to live anyway. What you have
to get into your minds now is that so far as you people are
concerned he actually was Desmond Rooke and it was he who got
cracked on the skull and thrown over the cliff at Sark, poor
devil... Mrs. Rooke, your arm. Louis calls us. Caviare and
vodka cannot be kept waiting. Little Ann will sit on the other
side of me. In view of the glass of vodka I am going to drink I
have not drunk my second cocktail. In ten minutes I shall be
ready to answer any further questions."</p>

<p>They trooped into the dining-room. The usual wonderful staff
of perfectly-trained servants, not one too many or one too few,
were waiting for them. The chairs were comfortable, the roses
were fresh and sweet and beautifully arranged, the caviare
arrived as though by magic and the vodka came from the cellars
where it had reposed for forty years. Mr. Percy Rooke was the
first to voice the general sentiment.</p>

<p>"I accept our benefactor's story," he said, raising the glass
of vodka to his lips. "To our friend and host&mdash;the
corpse!"</p>

<p>The feeling that this was some fantastic dream was gradually
fading away. They had drawn out the contents of their boxes and
read the few brief words transmuting their legacy into a deed of
gift. With the return of their courage the questions commenced.
With his first glass of champagne Sir George felt his head
clearer.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Desmond Rooke," he said, "you hadn't any idea
that one of those fellows from 'Investments Limited' would go so
far as to murder you just to keep the money in the firm?"</p>

<p>"Not I," the other replied. "I shouldn't have thought one of
them would have had the pluck."</p>

<p>"Then why," Sir George asked, "did you make that will leaving
your money specifically to your family connections?"</p>

<p>"A cunning question, Sir George," his client admitted as he
too sampled the champagne approvingly. "I did it for this
reason. Nathaniel was a sick man. Before we left London I took
him to a specialist who called me back into the room for a word
or two after he had cheered up his patient with a few
platitudes. He told me that the man had valvular disease of the
heart in a very advanced stage and could not live a year. Now
you are going to call me a very hardhearted opportunist;" he
went on, "and perhaps I was, but I did no one any harm. I have
done some big deals in my life under the name of Bresson and a
few under the name of Rooke, and whereas I have always come out
on top as Bresson I made some enemies over two of my Rooke
deals, and if a fellow whose name was believed to be Desmond
Rooke had to die, it gave me a fresh start in several countries
where I was not popular. So you see, although I didn't know that
Nathaniel stood a chance of being thrown over the cliff, I did
know that he would be a dead man in a year."</p>

<p>Sir George drank another glass of champagne. His head felt
clearer still.</p>

<p>"I must confess," he declared, "I cannot see that you did
anyone any harm by leaving your name upon a tombstone in Sark
churchyard. The relatives and friends of the poor fellow who
does lie there have been made comfortable for the rest of their
days. You yourself, Mr. Desmond Rooke, prevented one of those
many fortunes you seem to have accumulated from being snatched
away by a company of City sharks, and the money which came
instead to our friends here present to-night doesn't seem to
have been without its good results."</p>

<p>There was a murmured chorus of agreement rising to
enthusiasm. Their host held out his glass to the sommelier and
as soon as it was full rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "the only regret I feel at
parting with my own name and continuing my affairs in life as
Mr. James J. Bresson is that I must nominally discard an
attractive company of relatives. Never mind. Sometimes friends
are better than relatives. I drink to the Rooke legatees. Sir
George, I am sure, will join with me. I drink long life and
happiness to you who have been known as the Rooke legatees and,
without making any rash promises &mdash;Ann, my dear, you
haven't a sister up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>She shook her head laughingly.</p>

<p>"My celibacy being then assured," the speaker concluded, "I
will venture to drop a slight hint that someday you may have
reason to call yourselves the Bresson legatees."</p>

<p>Tumult and good spirits, a kiss from Ann, a handshake from
all the men. Bresson was on his feet again.</p>

<p>"I hear from Sir George," he said, "that even on the day you
received my legacies and you adopted the name of the Rooke
Legatees you decided upon an adventurous life. Of one of our
young friend Colin's adventures I know already and it was
undertaken quite in the proper spirit. Now let us pass our
time&mdash;we have a lengthy meal to go through and a good many
magnums of this wine to finish&mdash;let us pass our time
listening to an account of your various enterprises. This feast
shall be a sort of Decameron. I will hear what each of you has
done with your legacy. Mrs. Percy&mdash;you seem the
quietest."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"Before I had the money," she confided, "I let lodgings and
found it very hard work to live. Afterwards I opened a beautiful
guest-house in Hampstead and I married Percy."</p>

<p>The rest of the adventures took longer in the recounting.
Even their lengthy dinner was drawing towards its close. Coffee
was on the table and brandy had been served before Colin wound
up by telling them with great skill of words and judicious
camouflage the story of his night on the mountains of South
Abyssinia. The hour came for farewell. Mr. Bresson had the last
word.</p>

<p>"My young friend, Colin," he said, "has been trying to
persuade me to tell you all some of my recent adventures. It is,
I am sorry to say, a little too early for me to tell you of some
very interesting episodes in which I have played a part within
the last few years but instead I will, if you like, make you a
promise. Let me join you in twelve months' time at one of your
friendly dinners and I will tell you of my year's work. I have
great schemes on hand with great people. I shall have made or
lost millions before we meet again and in two cases, at least, I
shall carry my life in my hands. As my many times removed young
cousin, who knows more about me than any of you, will tell you,
for as a professional journalist he is often behind the scenes,
I have been besieged by requests to grant interviews on various
of the greater happenings of my life. I have always refused, but
I promise you this&mdash;next time we meet, if you ask me to
join that dinner, we will lock the doors and I will tell you
where I have been and what I have been doing. The stage is
already set for great events in three continents of the world.
For years I have been called the mystery man of finance and the
mystery man of armaments. I suppose this is because I can always
produce an unlimited amount of arms and munitions on request or
credits as great as any banking house in the world can
manipulate. I will tell you about these the next time we
meet."</p>

<p>A man came hurrying in bearing a coat and hat. Another
secretarial-looking person presented himself.</p>

<p>"The plane will be ready to start in half an hour, Mr.
Bresson," he announced. "If you are late in Vienna you will find
it difficult to make your connections."</p>

<p>It was a matter of seconds. Mr. Bresson dropped a box of
cigarettes into his pocket. Once more he brushed Ann's cheek
lightly with his lips.</p>

<p>"Twelve months to-night," he called out. "Six
stories&mdash;every one of them an epic."</p>

<p>He made a graceful little gesture of adieu and was gone.</p>
