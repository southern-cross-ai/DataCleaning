<h2><a name="pubnote" id="pubnote"></a>PUBLISHERS' NOTE</h2>
<p>After this book had been printed off, a letter was received from
the author to the effect that his colleague Professor W. J.
Woodhouse, of the University of Sydney, had recently ascertained
that the autograph of Cook's <i>Journal</i>, and also of the
<i>Instructions</i> and <i>Secret Instructions</i> issued to him,
are in the possession of Mr. H. W. F. Bolckow, of Marton Hall,
Marton-in-Cleveland. Following Admiral Wharton and other previous
writers, Professor Wood has in the present volume referred to these
documents as being no longer extant, and has used what is known as
the Corner copy of the <i>Journal</i> (now in Sydney), which has
hitherto been regarded as the best authority, and is believed to be
an exact copy of the original.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that this information reached Professor Wood
too late to be made use of in his book, though it is not likely
that his narrative of <i>The Discovery of Australia</i> would be
materially affected by the documents in question.</p>
<p><i>June</i>, 1922.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The lectures, which make this book, were given to a class in
Sydney University in 1917. The quality of lectures given in an
Australian University is determined by the mind of the students
only less than by the mind of the lecturer; and with pleasure I
take this opportunity to thank the generations of students, who,
for thirty years, have not only made lecturing a happiness, but
have also, by kindly appreciation of good intention, well salted
with honest witness to evident failure, given reason to do one's
best.</p>
<p>Chapters I. and VI. were given as lectures to the Royal
Australian Historical Society, and are printed in its Journal, Vol.
III. Part 10, and Vol. IV. Part 4.</p>
<p>In preparation of the lectures, my chief debt was to the
Mitchell Library. Mr. David Mitchell of Sydney was a gentleman of
wealth and of culture, who devoted a large part of his life to the
collection of a Library of the Literature of Australian History.
This Library he gave to the State of New South Wales, together with
an endowment that enables the Committee to purchase historical
material of the highest value. It is a marvellous collection of
precious things; and in it the student of Australian History works
in an atmosphere of enervating luxury. I cannot sufficiently
express my gratitude to the Mitchell Librarian, Mr. Hugh Wright,
and to his Assistant Librarians, for the infinite courtesy with
which they have helped my work. I am especially indebted to Mr.
Wright for help in the study of Banks's Journal, <i>the</i>
treasure of the Mitchell.</p>
<p>In spite of the excellence of the Mitchell Library there are
some historical materials which cannot be used in Sydney. I have
tried to indicate the parts of the discussion in which, for this
reason, my equipment is imperfect, and I have had to take facts
from the books of modern writers.</p>
<p>Of these books, that which, perhaps, was most useful to me was
Rainaud's <i>Le Continent Austral</i>. I have continually had at
hand the fascinating and most helpful volumes of Fiske's
<i>Discovery of America</i>. Mr. Major's Introduction to the
<i>Early Voyages to Australia</i> was of great service. I wish to
express my special obligation to Mr. George Collingridge, whose
<i>Discovery of Australia</i> first made the subject of interest to
me, and whose maps especially are very useful. Though I differ in
opinion from Mr. Collingridge in respect to the interpretation of
the early maps, I am aware that his study of these maps, and
especially of the Portuguese-French maps, has been more minute than
mine; and I hope we may agree that, groping in a fog, we are both
guessers. It has been a peculiar pleasure to plunder the admirable
volumes of my old friend Professor Beazley on the <i>Dawn of Modern
Geography</i>; a pleasure mingled with fear that I have not got
from them all that I ought to have got. In telling the Spanish
story, I have used the translations in the admirable editions
published by the Hakluyt Society. In the Dutch part, the English
student must be mainly dependent on the help of Mr. Heeres. In the
discussion of Cook, Admiral Wharton and Mr. Kitson have had the use
of material which cannot be used in Sydney. In the chapter on the
"Successors of Cook," I have continually used the books of
Professor Scott of Melbourne, who has kindly read my chapter.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to Professor Todd and Professor Woodhouse who
gave kindly help in my slight sketch of the "ancient conception";
and to Professor David and Professor Cotton who gave me the modern
geological criticism of the argument, so much used in our story,
that there <i>must</i> be a great continent in the South. Dr.
Frederick Watson has most kindly corrected the dates in the
chapters which tell the story of Cook's First Voyage.</p>
<p>And most hearty are my thanks to my sister-in-law, Miss Laura
Whitfeld, who, with incredible insight and industry, translated
impossible hand-writing into alluring type, and made me hope that
the lectures might become a useful book.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>The story may begin in a Greek Utopia, written by an author
named Theopompus about 350 B.C.</p>
<p>"At length in process of talk Selenus told Midas of certain
islands named Europia, Asia, and Libia, which the Ocean Sea
circumscribeth and compasseth round about; and that without this
world there is a continent or parcel of dry land which in greatness
is infinite and immeasurable"; and he told of its "green meadows
and pasture plots," its "big and mighty beasts," its gigantic men,
who, "in the same climate exceed the stature of us twice," its
"many and divers cities, its laws and ordinances clean contrary to
ours."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Major's <i>Early Voyages to Australia</i> (Hak.
Soc.), p. i. (note). See longer quotation in Tillinghast's
admirable essay on <i>The Geographical Knowledge of the
Ancients</i> in Justin Winsor, vol. i. p. 22, note 1.]</p>
<p>The world, then, according to "the son of a nymph," consists of
"three islands," or rather of one island composed of three parts,
with shores washed by the circumfluent Ocean Sea. And what lies
beyond the Ocean Sea? Why not some other huge island, some fourth
part of the world, some Utopia of the South, in which one's dreams
are facts?</p>
<p>Fancy built on firm foundation. Greek geographers were men of
science, whose thought outstripped experience, and conquered unseen
worlds. They had proved that the earth was a sphere; proved it by
reasonings, known now to every schoolboy, which could never be
refuted, and which could never be forgotten. They had proved the
existence of climatic zones. They had made it certain that, beyond
scorched tropic seas, must be some great region in which the
climate was like that of the temperate zone of the North. What more
likely, in a well-ordered lawfully governed <i>Kosmos</i>, than
that South corresponds to North; that <i>there</i>, also, exists a
continent as great as the three-fold "island" of the known world;
and that, since "nature loves life," this unknown continent is
inhabited by populous nations of human beings, like and unlike to
those of the North?</p>
<p>But to this land of the temperate South no Greek nor Roman
sailed. Thought was free to girdle the earth; but travel was
bounded by the Tropics. Long before the Equator was reached,
knowledge of Africa faded into speculation, romance, fable and
fairy-tale. Herodotus, it is true, once heard a story that about
600 B.C., Phoenician seamen had sailed through the Red Sea, and had
returned three years afterwards through the Mediterranean. The
seamen had declared, so the tale was told to Herodotus, that,
sailing Southward, the sun had appeared to the North; a statement
which seemed to him to prove that the seamen were liars, but which
the modern critic is inclined to take as evidence that they
<i>had</i> at all events sailed to some point South of the Equator.
On the West coast of Africa, Carthaginian seamen under Hanno had
sailed Southward as far as Sierra Leone, and had returned with
stories of "wild men and women covered with hair called gorillas";
with stories, too, of lands burnt up with everlasting fires;
bush-fires kindled by natives, explains the modern critic; but to
Hanno it seemed that the land was uninhabitable on account of
intolerable heat. Thick fogs and dust storms on the African coast
gave to the Atlantic the name of "the Sea of Darkness." Scorching
winds from the Sahara confirmed the opinion that the Tropics were
an eternal barrier to human travel. There was speculation about the
sources of the Nile; and perhaps some little knowledge is expressed
in the legends of the "Mountains of the Moon." And yet Pomponius
Mela, who wrote with authority on geographical matters about 50
A.D., thought that the Nile probably rose in the unknown continent
of the South, and flowed by a subterranean channel beneath the
Ocean Sea, emerging to the surface in Africa.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Southern Asia also ended at the Tropics. Alexander
marched to the Sutlej, and told his soldiers that they had come to
"the Sunrise and to the Ocean." "Unless your sloth and cowardice
prevent, we shall thence return in triumph to our native land,
having conquered the earth to its remotest bounds." But the
soldiers answered, "We are standing now almost on the earth's
utmost verge, and yet you are preparing to go in quest of an India
unknown even to the Indians themselves. You would fain root out
from hidden recesses and dens a race of men that herd with snakes
and wild beasts, so that you may traverse as conqueror more regions
than the sun surveys."<sup>*</sup> So Alexander's march was stayed.
He sailed down the Indus, and at its mouth he founded the city of
Patala,<sup>**</sup> a name which long dwelt in men's minds as the
name of the Furthest South, "where the sun rises on the right
(<i>i.e</i>. the North), and shadows fall towards the South," and
where the Wain can be seen only in the first part of the night. So
India remained the land of Romance, a land equal, some said, to
one-third of the whole world, a land abounding in gold and in
jewels, and in elephants, and in dragons.<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Quintus Curtius Rufus in M'Crindle's <i>Invasion
of India</i>, pp. 225-229. Quoted in Synge's <i>Book of
Discovery</i>, pp. 40-41.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See M'Crindle's note on Patala, p. 356. The
name is sometimes spelt Patalis, and sometimes Pathalis.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Pliny, Book VI., Chs. 21-23.]</p>
<p>In later Roman times some vague distorted knowledge was gained
of the coasts of India, of Ceylon (known as Taprobane), of the
Ganges, of golden lands or islands East of the Gangetic Gulf, and
of the "Silk Land" (Serica) to the North. Ceylon was thought to be
an island in the far distance, and of enormous size. Pliny wrote
that a Roman freedman, while sailing round Arabia, was driven to
sea by the North wind, and on the fifteenth day reached Taprobane.
He stayed there six months; and the King became so interested in
his talk about the Romans and Caesar that he sent envoys to Rome.
They reported that in their country Canopus "shone by night a great
and bright star." And "what astonished them chiefly was that (in
Rome) their shadows fall towards our sky (i.e. the North), not
towards theirs (i.e. the South)."<sup>*</sup> Some writers thought
that Taprobane was no island, but the tip of the great unknown
continent of the South, "the first part of the other world," the
land of the "Antichthones"; and, says Pomponius Mela, this is
likely enough; for it is inhabited, and yet there is no evidence
that anyone has sailed round it! Thus at Taprobane all knowledge
ended. No travellers' tales were told of a further South. The
Tropic Seas, says Pliny, are "burnt and cremated by flames,
scorched by the near sun." Beyond those seas, no doubt, was the
"other world," probably inhabited as thickly as the continent of
the North. "But about these people," says Mela, "we know nothing,
for between us and them there intervenes a burning zone, which it
is impossible to cross."<sup>**</sup></p>

<p>Thus the "world of ordinary classical geography," the world as
conceived by Greeks and Romans about the date of the Christian era,
stops far short of the Equator. The West Coast of Africa ends about
Sierra Leone, or the Canary Islands. The East coast ends at about
Cape Gardafui. A grossly misunderstood Ceylon is both Furthest
South and Furthest East. Southward of it lies the circumfluent
Ocean Sea, boiling, impassable. And South of it, unknown,
unknowable (unless perchance Ceylon is its "first part"), lies the
great island-continent of the South, a land interesting to men of
science as a curious speculation, to men of letters as a site for
Utopias, and to rhetoricians as an illustration of the vanity of
human ambitions, and the smallness of the Empire to which Jupiter
had placed neither bounds nor end.<sup>*</sup></p>

<b>2. RAINAUD'S INTERPRETATION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL VIEWS OF
POMPONIUS MELA.<br>
(From Rainaud, Le Continent Austral.)</b></p>
<p>This was the popular geography of the early Empire. But Claudius
Ptolemy of Alexandria knew better.<sup>*</sup> By his time (A.D.
150) geographical science had made great advance. He
understood&mdash;as none before him, and as none after him for the
next thirteen hundred years&mdash;the importance of making maps by
the certain rules of mathematics and astronomy. In his days also
more geographical information had been accumulated. Seamen had
pushed Southward down the East coast of Africa, Southwards even of
the Equator. Definite knowledge also had been obtained of a
"Silk-land," distant from India, extending far to the East and far
to the North. News also had been heard, it seems, of lands
stretching down from Asia far to the South-East. It seems certain
that Ptolemy had some knowledge of the Malay Peninsula. It seems
certain, also, that rumours had reached him of the long string of
Malaysian islands, lying so close together that they may well have
been described as one continuous land. Evidently there was far more
land than had been imagined. Much was still unknown; but, when
Ptolemy thought, he thought in continents. Against Mela's "wet
theory," which supposed the unknown to be Ocean, he set the "dry
theory," which supposed the unknown to be land. In his famous map
the circumfluent Ocean Sea disappears. Eastern Asia extends
indefinitely both Eastward and Southward. At about 15&deg; S. Lat. it
takes a decisive turn to the West, and runs along that parallel
till it meets the continent of Africa in the same latitude. Thus
the Indian Ocean is made a "mediterranean" sea, wholly enclosed by
land, so that you can reach it neither by rounding Africa, nor by
sailing West from Europe. And the Southern coast of this sea, in
about Lat. 15&deg; S., is a Terra Incognita, Ptolemy's way of
representing the unknown land of the Southern temperate
zone.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-03">Illustration 3.</a>]</p>
<p class="note">[* See Rawlinson's explanation of Ptolemy's
geography of the East in <i>India and the Western World</i>, pp.
130-137.]</p>
<p>Such was the heritage which the ancient world handed to medieval
times. The knowledge was never wholly lost. But it wholly ceased to
grow. The "dark ages" had no use for the science of the Greeks, and
great distrust of it. Philosophy gave place to the Scriptures;
thought obeyed that which was written; the spirit that questions,
and explores, and denies, and proves, was put to sleep. In place of
Socrates, "gadfly of the Athenian people," stinging men into
thought, into criticism of the accepted opinion, into exploration
of the unknown continents of the spiritual world, we have Thomas
Aquinas, enthroned, foot on neck of heretic, Bible on knee, and
voice from heaven saying, "Well hast thou written of me, O
Thomas!"<sup>*</sup> The geography that interested was the
geography of Hell, of Purgatory, of Heaven. Earthly geography must
be learned from Scripture, or at least must be consistent with
Scripture. Jerusalem is the centre of the earth, for "thus saith
the Lord: 'This is Jerusalem: I have set her <i>in the midst</i> of
the nations, and countries are <i>round</i> about her.'" The last
phrase seems to indicate that the earth is round; and this opinion
may seem to be confirmed by the statement that God "sitteth upon
<i>the circle</i> of the earth, and all the inhabitants thereof are
as grasshoppers." But doubt is thrown on this interpretation by the
fact that Isaiah continues: "He stretcheth out the Heavens as a
<i>curtain</i> and spreadeth them as <i>a tent</i> to dwell in."
And this doubt is increased when we read that "the Son of Man shall
send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and shall
gather together his elect from the <i>four angles</i>." The earth
is, after all, a square rather than a round, and we shall most
truly conceive of it as a tent with curtains.</p>

<b>3. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO PTOLEMY<br>
From Spooner Litglin's <i>Atlas Antiquus.</i></b></p>
<p>The best illustration of this method of geographical study is
the book written in the Sixth Century (about 547 A.D.) by the monk
who is known to us as Cosmas Indicopleustes: a name which seems to
be a <i>nom de plume</i>, meaning the cosmographer who sailed to
India. For, in his younger days, Cosmas had been a merchant in the
Indian Ocean, and had obtained real knowledge of Ceylon, and
information even about China. But though he claims that his
geographical opinions are confirmed by his experience, his main
assertion is that they are wholly independent of human knowledge,
being based on a careful study of the Scriptures. From this careful
study he has learned the great central truth, which explains all
geography, the fact that "the Tabernacle prepared by Moses" is "a
pattern of the whole world." The earth then is flat: an oblong
flat, for was not the table of show-bread twice as long as it was
broad? At the Northern end is a high mountain, round which goes the
sun&mdash;a sun of forty miles radius, and four hundred miles
away&mdash;so that when the sun is behind the mountain it is night,
and when it appears again it is day. Round this flat oblong earth
flows the ocean&mdash;the ocean on which Cosmas had himself sailed
when he travelled to India. And round this Ocean, again, is an
outer frame of land, in the Eastern side of which is the Garden of
Eden, whence the Four great rivers, the Nile, the Ganges, the
Tigris and the Euphrates, flow from their common source by the Tree
of Life, "cleaving a passage through the Ocean, and springing up in
this earth." On this same outer earth had dwelt the Patriarchs in
the days before the flood, when Noah, sailing over the Ocean sea in
his Ark, "reached our part of the earth, and settled in Persian
territory." To the outside edge of this outer earth, God had
"glued" the four "walls" or "curtains" of the "heavens," welding
heaven and earth together, as Job says, "as a square block of
stone." "On high he formed it into a most lofty vault overspanning
the length of the earth"; and then, "having enclosed the space,
made a house, as one might call it, of enormous size, like an
oblong vaulted vapour bath." And, finally, by the insertion of the
"Firmament," this house had been made into two houses, or rather a
house with "an upper and a lower storey"; the lower storey for man,
the upper for God, the angels and the saints.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "One of the huge receptacles in which female
travellers of our day carry their dresses, forms a perfect model of
the Kosmos of Kosmas" (Yule). See <a href="#il-05">Illustration
5.</a>]</p>
<p>Such was the geography taught by that Divine Wisdom which was
independent of human intelligence. How different from the
"inventions of the Greeks," and how much more in accordance with
commonsense! If the earth is, as they say, founded on its own
stability, but revolves on its axis, pray what is that axis made
of? And again why do not we hear it whizz? And what supports it?
And what can be more obviously absurd than the Greek doctrine of
the Antipodeans, "men carrying their heads downwards!" These
pagans, in fact, "take in hand to turn <i>everything</i> upside
down rather than follow the doctrines of the truth," even as "they
are whirled round in ceaseless revolutions along with their
<i>sphere</i>." You have only to draw a picture of the sphere with
four men standing on it at the four points to realise the absurdity
of the idea.</p>

<b>4. COSMAS: THE ANTIPODES IN DERISION.<br>
(From Beazley's The Dawn of Modern Geography.)</b></p>
<p>"We therefore depict, according to your view, the earth and the
antipodes, and let each one of you who has sound vision, and the
power of reasoning justly, turn the earth round whichever way he
pleases, and let him say whether the Antipodeans can be all
standing upright in the same sense of the expression." These are
clearly "old wives' fables," and an insult to Christian
intelligence. "For if two men, on opposite sides, placed the soles
of their feet against each, whether they chose to stand on earth,
on air, on fire, or any kind of body, how could <i>both</i> be
found standing upright? The one would assuredly be found in the
natural upright position, and the other, contrary to nature, head
downwards. Such notions are opposed to reason, and alien to our
nature and condition. And how, again, when it rains upon both of
them, is it possible to say that the rain falls <i>down</i> upon
the two, and not that it falls down on the one, and falls <i>up</i>
to the other?"</p>

<br>
<b>5. THE UNIVERSE, ACCORDING TO COSMAS.<br>
(From Beazley's The Dawn of Modern Geography.)</b></p>
<p>And, once more, how could Antipodeans use the power given by God
to men to "tread <i>upon</i> serpents and scorpions," when the
serpents and scorpions would be <i>above</i> them? This is food for
laughter. But more serious matter remains. "For He made," saith the
Apostle, "<i>of one</i> the whole race of men to dwell upon the
<i>whole</i> face of the earth"&mdash;one face, not two faces! The
theory of an antipodal world, shut off by an impassable tropic sea,
implied the existence of a race of men who had not died in Adam,
and who had not in Christ been made alive. The inventions of the
Greeks were "old wives' tales," but they were something worse. "The
blasphemous theory of the Antipodes makes Christ a liar, and His
word not in us."</p>
<p>Cosmas thought highly of the vigour of his own mental powers,
and he had, at all events, a pleasant freshness of invective and a
good gift of laughter at obvious absurdity. But he was, in truth,
rather a representative man than a leader of thought. Most of his
ideas, as Professor Beazley has shown, had been expressed by
earlier writers:&mdash;the flat, quadrilateral earth: the rivers of
Eden that dive under the sea: the world-tabernacle of two storeys:
the gluing together of earth and heaven: the absurdity and the
blasphemy of an antipodal world. Long before Cosmas, Lactantius had
asked the triumphant question: "Can anyone be so foolish as to
believe that there are men whose feet are higher than their heads,
or places where things can be hanging upwards, trees growing
downwards, and water falling upwards?" He who begins by believing
Ptolemy, another famous Father had said, ends by denying God as
Creator. "Can one imagine," asks St. Augustine, "anything more
absurd than that which the ancients have maintained, that there may
be inhabitants in the regions of earth opposite to ours? Those who
have said this admit that they have no knowledge by experience. It
is mere conjecture drawn from certain pretended philosophical
arguments. But, assuming their propositions are correct, can we
argue that, because these lands are inhabitable, therefore they are
inhabited? The Holy Scripture, which is the rule of that which we
should believe, says no word about them. It is agreed that the
descendants of our first father could not have come to those lands.
How then can it be maintained that there are men there?"</p>

<br>
<b>6. EIGHTH-CENTURY MAP<br>
(From Nordenskiold's <i>Periplus</i>)</b></p>
<p>And theological hatred of the doctrine of the sphericity of the
earth, and especially of the very closely connected doctrine of an
inhabited antipodal world, long continued. Especially fatal was the
argument that an antipodal race, living on the far side of the
boiling Tropic sea, must be outside God's great scheme of damnation
and redemption, that there was no place for an Australian in
Heaven, in Hell, or in Purgatory, and that therefore the Australian
did not exist! Even those who could not rid their minds of the
haunting thought that the classic arguments for the sphericity of
the earth had not been refuted, and never could be refuted, and who
felt bound to admit the possibility, at least, of the existence of
a world in the temperate zone, felt bound also to deny that this
world might possibly contain human inhabitants. "Beyond the three
parts of the world," wrote Isidore, "there is a fourth part in the
South, across the interior ocean, in whose bounds the antipodes are
<i>fabulously</i> said to live";&mdash;a phrase destined to be
quoted again and again, and to be illustrated by a whole cycle of
maps.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See maps of the eighth and twelfth centuries
printed in this volume&mdash;<a href="#il-06">Illustration 6</a>
and <a href="#il-07">Illustration 7</a>].</p>
<p>And yet the knowledge of ancient times was never <i>wholly</i>
forgotten; though part was forgotten, and "part seemed to be in a
sort of limbo, on this side of Lethe, not altogether out of sight,
but out of touch of the new times, uncared for, unattended
to."<sup>*</sup> The scientific geography of Ptolemy was forgotten.
But the popular geography of Pliny, the stories of the marvels of
natural history in distant lands, still had their charm, and
theological hatred could find no reason to disbelieve them. They
were collected, and they were improved. South Africa became
interesting as the home of people who live on the milk of
dog-headed apes; of others who have a dog for King; of others who
have four heads apiece; of others who have one eye only, in the
middle of the forehead. India, again, which in this description is
placed to the East of China, became noteworthy because <i>there</i>
dwelt "tribes who had their feet turned backwards, with eight toes
on each; others who had dogs' heads and talons for fingers, and
'barked for speech'; others again with feet so huge that they could
use them for shade against the sun."<sup>**</sup> Maps were made
which were, in effect, picture books to illustrate the tales of
marvels. The world went back to childhood; but at all events the
stories it listened to, and the pictures it gazed upon, were
stories and pictures which expressed, in blurred and distorted
form, the real knowledge of the ancients. The time would come when
the taste for marvels would grow into the taste for knowledge.</p>

<p>And, in truth, the taste for knowledge was never wholly lost.
Human nature remained deep rooted even in Christian Fathers.
Intellectual curiosity found pleasure in the thoughts of ancient
times. The sense of beauty took delight in classic literature. Some
sought to argue that Holy Scripture, if interpreted by the
Allegoric method, was not irreconcilable with pagan science. Some
urged that Christians might make use of pagan knowledge, as the
Hebrews "borrowed" from the Egyptians,<sup>*</sup> or as Solomon
employed foreign workmen in the building of the
Temple.<sup>**</sup> Some showed an uneasy feeling that pagan
science was in the right by contending that the shape of the earth,
and such-like things, are of no importance to the Christian. Some
admitted that the earth was spherical, and that temperate zones
were habitable, but saved their orthodoxy by the statement that
<i>in fact</i> the North alone was inhabited. An antipodal world
exists, but antipodal people are a fable.</p>
<p class="note">[* Augustine's view.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Bede's view.]</p>
<p>And, as the long dark centuries passed, the love of classic
literature, and the love of science and of truth, grew ever more
fervent, and ever more unashamed. When we open the book which Roger
Bacon sent to the Pope in 1267, we are amazed by the modernism of
his sentiments. His mistakes are many and obvious. But the spirit
of the man of science is in him, the consciousness of ignorance,
the patient search for truth. "Wise men know their ignorance and
are ready to learn from anyone"; and he urges a "careful scrutiny
of received opinions." "All truth is contained in the Scriptures";
but we need the assistance of philosophy in order that we may
understand the Scriptures. For "Reason comes from God, and
therefore Philosophy is divine; and the wisdom of the Greeks was
revealed to them by God Himself, and their high morality should
make Christians ashamed. Wherever truth is found it belongs to
Christ."</p>
<p>Once more the spirit that enquires and explores is awake, modest
and confident. And for its teachers it looks to the Greeks and to
the Romans. Ptolemy remained inaccessible to Christians. But long
ago the Arabs had translated his book, absorbed his ideas, and
incorporated them in their own geographical treatises. Christian
scholars of the thirteenth century, men like Roger Bacon, and
Albert the Great, were well acquainted with Arabic literature, and,
through Arabic literature, with the knowledge of the ancient world.
Once more the old Greek arguments which prove the sphericity of the
earth, the system of zones, the existence of an antipodal world,
were thought out and restated. Once more the importance of the
application of exact mathematical methods to the study of geography
was explained and enforced. And once more scientific speculation
began as to the contents of the unknown world of the South. Bacon
quotes the passages which tell of lands in the far South of India,
Patala and Taprobane, where shadows fall towards the South; and in
a passage, which was to bear curious fruit, he argues that "the
Southern front of India in the region of Pathalis and the
neighbouring lands runs out towards the Tropic of
Capricorn";<sup>*</sup> a misinterpretation which ended, as we
shall see, in placing the name of Alexander's town of Patala at the
mouth of the Indus on a promontory of the imagined continent of the
South having its centre at the South Pole!</p>

<b>8. CHART OF 1489<br>
(From Rainaud, <i>Le Continent Austral.)</i></b></p>
<p>Misinterpreting Aristotle, as he had misinterpreted Pliny, Bacon
argues that this "place beyond the Tropic of Capricorn" not only
exists, but is also "of best habitation, seeing that it is the
higher part of the world, and the more noble; and hence the opinion
of some that Paradise is there." Albert the Great held that "the
fourth part of the earth" not only existed but was also habitable.
He met the theological objection by the argument, in his time
growing more and more convincing, that, though to pass the Tropic
Ocean is difficult, it is <i>not impossible</i>; and that therefore
Antipodeans might after all be children of Adam, to be damned, or
to be saved. Men, he argues, can live in the Tropics; and they can
live pleasantly in the Southern temperate zone, between 24&deg; S. Lat.
and 48&deg;-50&deg; S. Lat., perhaps even more pleasantly than we can.
Dante took the hint of the scholars, and combined it perhaps with
some traveller's tale. From the horrid circles of Hell he emerges
to find himself in the Antipodes, exactly opposite Jerusalem. Here
is the Mount of Purgatory; on its summit is the Terrestrial
Paradise; and in full view are "four stars ne'er seen before save
by the ken of our first parents."</p>
<p>By the fifteenth century we return to the point from which we
started&mdash;a Utopia in the South&mdash;devised by an Italian
scholar, who tells of its "towns, castles, and empires." "These
unknown nations are called the Antipodes; like us they have plants
and animals, and fight great battles."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Rainaud's <i>Le Continent Austral</i>, p.
134.]</p>
<p>Thus, by the end of the thirteenth century, scholars were once
more acquainted with the geographical knowledge of Greeks and
Romans.<sup>*</sup> But they knew little or nothing more. And what
they read they often misunderstood. When Roger Bacon, thoroughly
up-to-date, inquisitive, daring, sat down in his Oxford study in
1267 to write of the world of the South, his best authorities were
Aristotle and Pliny, "whom all saints and ages have followed." From
Aristotle he learnt that the Garden of Eden was in Australia. From
Pliny he learnt that Patala, really at the mouth of the Indus, was
"towards the Tropic of Capricorn." And yet, as we read his book, we
are conscious of a new spirit which will soon make his geographical
statements absurdly out of date. He tells us that he has not been
content to read Pliny and other ancient authors. He has also had
recourse to modern travellers; and especially to a certain
Franciscan brother, William de Rubruquis, whom the King of France
had sent to the Tartars in 1253. "I have diligently read his book
and talked with its author, and likewise with many others who have
travelled in places East and South." This is the beginning of a new
chapter in our story. Geographical knowledge is once more to be
founded, not on the study of ancient writings, but on modern
travel, interpreted by modern science.</p>

<p>But before we follow the story of European discovery in the
South, it is well that we gather what knowledge we may of the
Indian Ocean at the time this story began. While scholars, Greek,
Roman, and Christian, had been spinning arguments about the
contents of the Southern temperate region "to us unknown," how were
things going in the island continent, and in the Ocean which washed
its shores?</p>
<p>What seems to be certain, in the midst of so much uncertainty,
is that the Australian natives who, in the dateless backward of
History, had passed along the islands from India, lived for untold
centuries in their final home in almost complete
isolation.<sup>*</sup> Their civilization was a very poor thing,
but it was their own. Throughout Australia manners and customs were
essentially the same, almost the worst manners and customs in the
world, except those of Tasmania. There is no trace, or at most
there is only a very faint trace, of any foreign element in their
midst, or of any foreign influence exercised upon them. Australia
was an all-black Australia. Immigrants from other countries were
not excluded by law, but they landed at risk of their lives. "The
coastal natives of the North," writes Professor Spencer, "are
strong and fierce, and always on the look-out to kill intruders,
and for a stranger to venture into the bush would be certain
death." Australia resolutely played a lone hand in the
world.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See an interesting essay by Professor Griffith
Taylor on <i>The Evolution and Distribution of Race, Culture, and
Language</i> in the <i>Geographical Review</i>, Jan. 1921. "Nothing
is so dangerous to a people as complete isolation. The natural
barrier, which preserved the Australian aboriginals from invasion,
also resulted in their remaining in the same low state of
civilisation for 100,000 years." The guess is that they got to
Australia by an almost continuous bridge, which was knocked to
pieces about 100,000 years ago!]</p>
<p class="note">[** Cf. Spencer's <i>Native Tribes of North
Australia</i>: "There is only very rarely indeed seen anything like
a trace of Malay blood...It is possible that, on very rare
occasions, a Malay or Macassar man may have succeeded in having
intercourse with an aboriginal woman, but he could do so only at
the risk of his life...The coastal natives are strong and fierce
and always on the look-out to kill intruders...for a stranger to
venture into the bush would be certain death...I have once, but
only once, seen a native who had clearly some Malay blood in her."
Spencer says, however, that the drawings and decorations of the
Melville and Bathurst islanders are entirely distinct from any on
the mainland, and suggest contact in time past with a people whose
art was more akin to that of the islands to the North-East than to
anything in Australia (pp. 407-8).]</p>
<p>And yet one cannot look at a modern map without feeling sure
that Australia must have been visited in very early times. It is
not geographically a very isolated land. It is tied to Asia by a
string of islands, large, fertile, populous, which lie so close
together that they may possibly have been represented to Ptolemy as
one continuous land, the great South-East extension of "Silk-land,"
which formed the Eastern side of his land-locked Indian Ocean. It
seems, indeed, that at one time they <i>were</i> almost one
continuous land. "The chain of islands," writes Mr. Wallace, "which
extends from the Malay Peninsula towards Australia, ending with
Timor...represents a former continental extension, probably only
broken by the channel between Bali and Lombok (fifteen miles wide)
and a channel between Timor and Australia, twenty miles
wide."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "The former channel has sufficed to stop the
advance of the larger animals from the Asiatic to the Austral
region, and the latter channel has similarly prevented Australian
mammals from entering Timor."]</p>
<p>Galvano, the Portuguese governor of the Moluccas in the early
sixteenth century, who ought to have had good information about the
islands, thought that in Ptolemy's time there probably <i>had</i>
been a continuous land, afterwards shattered into fragments by the
earthquakes which are so frequent and so tremendous in these
regions; and he declared that, even in his days, the islands were
so close together that, sailing between two of them, you could at
the same time touch the trees on both sides! This, no doubt,
exaggerated their nearness to a ridiculous degree. And yet, taking
the islands as they actually are, one thinks that their inhabitants
must have been a race as unenterprising and as stay-at-home as the
Australian blackfellows themselves, if they were incapable of the
hop, skip, and jump that would have landed them on the Northern
coast of Australia.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact these islands were inhabited by Malays, who
were far from being an unenterprising or stay-at-home race of men.
They were a virile, energetic, fierce people, with a civilization,
barbarous indeed, yet far ahead of the simple Savagery of the
Australian natives. The Javans, especially, were organized at an
early date under a strong, efficient monarchy, which dominated the
neighbouring islands, and even established an empire in
Asia.<sup>*</sup> Cavendish, the Elizabethan seaman, said that the
Javans were "the most valiant people in all the Southern parts of
the world; for they never fear any death." And especially were they
famous for their navigation, which made them, Said Lap&eacute;rouse, the
Phoenicians of the medieval world. Again and again the Portuguese
writers of the sixteenth century emphasize the Javan reputation for
seamanship. "They have got many ships, and great navigators, and
many rowing galleys. They are great corsairs and mariners, and make
arms of steel." "They navigate to every part of the Eastern
Archipelago, and say that formerly they used to navigate the Ocean
as far as Madagascar."<sup>**</sup> "They claim priority in
navigation to all others, though Some Say the Chinese preceded the

<p>It would be surprising if these Javan corsairs and mariners, at
home in every part of the Eastern Archipelago, sailing the ocean as
far as Madagascar, did not chance now and then to land on the
North-West coast of Australia. When Flinders was exploring the Gulf
of Carpentaria in 1802, he was startled by the appearance of six
Malay prows which proved to be engaged in collecting <i>Trepang</i>
or <i>B&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> (sea-cucumber) as a dainty for the China
market.<sup>*</sup> He learnt that "the natives of Macassar had
long been accustomed to fish for the Trepang amongst the islands in
the vicinity of Java,...but, about twenty years before, one of them
had been driven by the North-West monsoon to the coast of New
Holland, and finding the Trepang to be abundant, they afterwards
returned, and had continued to fish there since that
time."<sup>**</sup> Who shall say in what far-off unrecorded cycle
of Cathay the North-West monsoon first drove Malay prows to the
North Australian coast? Its desolate appearance, the ferocity of
its men, the unloveliness of its women, the apparent lack of
everything eatable except fish, are sufficient explanation of the
fact that visitors did not become settlers.</p>

<p class="note">[** Flinders, vol. ii. p. 257.]</p>
<p>The Malays were barbarians, and not even respectable barbarians.
But they were in touch with other races who were far from being
barbarians. Their voyages carried them far. Their islands were
large and fertile, producing commodities very good for commerce.
Among them were the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, a little group of
tiny specks of land,&mdash;Banda, Amboyna, Ternate,
Tidore&mdash;which produced the world's supply of nutmegs and mace,
cloves and allspice. The possession of a complete monopoly of that
which all civilized nations must have at any price made the Malay
prows welcome everywhere. Especially were they welcome at Malacca,
the great central exchange of the Far East, where from time
immemorial Malays met Chinese, Hindus, and Arabs. With all these
races they traded, and with all of them they talked; and it would
again be surprising if nothing were said of the desolate coast line
to the far South, to which, according to our reasonable conjecture,
Malay prows had been blown by some North-West monsoon, and from
which, likely enough, they may have brought away a store of
sea-cucumbers, acceptable to civilized palates in the nations of
Asia.</p>
<p>Moreover, these civilized nations traded to the Malay islands,
and especially to Java, "the Clapham Junction," writes Mr.
Macmillan Brown, "of ancient Oriental trade routes." Let us notice
the importance of this point more exactly. We are to observe that
the Malay islands, the seamen of which probably had some slight and
disrespectful acquaintance with the coast of Australia, were
themselves well within the scope of the regular system of Asiatic
commerce, in permanent touch with great Oriental civilizations
which existed in days before the names of Athens and Rome had been
heard, and which still existed in those days of the young
Renaissance, when Europeans, following the beacon lit by Marco
Polo, found the long way to Australasian seas.</p>
<p>"For three centuries," writes Professor Mookerji,<sup>*</sup>
"India stood out as the very heart of the old world, and maintained
her position as one of the foremost maritime
countries.<sup>**</sup> She had colonies in Pegu, in Cambodia, in
Java, in Sumatra, in Borneo, and even in the countries of the
Further East, as far as Japan. She had trading settlements in South
China, in the Malayan Peninsula, in Arabia, and in all the chief
cities of Persia, and all over the East coast of Africa." Buddhism
was dominant in India from about 250 B.C. to about 700 A.D.; and
Buddhism, writes Sir William Hunter, was "a religion of enterprise
both mercantile and missionary."<sup>***</sup> "During the first
few centuries of the Christian era an enthusiastic band of devoted
Bengalis, burning with a proselytising zeal, went as far as China,
Corea and Japan, carrying with them the torch of Buddistic
faith."<sup>****</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Mookerji, p. 4.]</p>

World</i>, p. 138.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Hunter, vol. i. p. 44.]</p>
<p class="note">[**** Mookerji, p. 155.]</p>
<p>Most interesting to us is the Buddhist colonization of Java,
which began in the year 75 A.D. "The adventurous navigators planted
a colony, built towns and cities, and developed a trade with the
mother country which existed for several centuries."<sup>*</sup>
Further migrations took place from India to Java, and there grew up
in that fertile island a splendid Hindu civilization, which found
expression in the great Temples of Prambanam and Borobudur, "the
grandest Specimen of Buddhist art in the whole of
Asia."<sup>**</sup> In their sculptures we may Still see the story
told how Hindoo navigators set sail to colonize Java.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mookerji, p. 148.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Mookerji, p. 151.]</p>
<p>We learn then that, from the first century of the Christian era,
there were regular voyages between India and Java, that in Java
there was a permanent Hindu colony of fervent missionaries and keen
merchants, inspired by high aims, commanding great material
resources, and possessing excellent ships. Of Hindu voyages beyond
Java we have no news. But we may assume that anything the Javans
may have learnt of the continent to the South would travel, in the
form of rumours at least, as far as India.</p>
<p>More important, from our present point of view, were the voyages
of the Arabs, or Saracens, or Moors, as they are variously
called.<sup>*</sup> The religion of Mahomed was a religion that
aimed at the conquest of the world; and so fervent was its early
missionary zeal, and so keen was its sword, that in less than a
century it had actually conquered the world from the Atlantic to
the Himalayas;<sup>**</sup> and, but for the Sudden death of a
Caliph, we are told, would probably have extended its sway to the
Pacific.</p>
<p class="note">[* See map in Beazley, vol. iii., to illustrate the
geographical knowledge of the Arabians. See <a href=

<p class="note">[** "The last of the Ommiades (750 A D.) reigned
over three-quarters of the Empire of Alexander, and a quarter of
the dominion of Trajan." (Beazley, vol. i. p. 397).]</p>
<p>It was, moreover, a religion that made no war on civilization,
either material or intellectual. "Controlling as they did from the
seventh century most of the centres of ancient learning in Africa
and Asia, the Arabs were able to take advantage of older
knowledge"; and "no race has ever shown a greater keenness for the
acquisition of knowledge or more favour to the growth of
science."<sup>*</sup> While Europe sat in darkness, Bagdad became
the centre of a splendid civilization. Mahomedans, and not
Christians, became heirs to Greek culture. Especially was this the
case in respect to geographic knowledge. Ptolemy remained unread by
Europeans till the fifteenth century. But, already in the ninth
century, his books were translated into Arabic, and became the
inspiration of a native Arabic science, which in its turn, though
not till the thirteenth century, was accepted by Christian scholars
like Roger Bacon as their teacher and master. Already in the ninth
century, observatories were founded at Bagdad and at Damascus, and
the "first school of geographical Science since the Antonines" was
formed.<sup>**</sup> Arabian travellers co-operated with Arabian
men of science, and surveyed every sea from Spain to China, from
Cairo, to Madagascar, from Java to Canton. Arabian merchants traded
and colonized on the East coast of Africa, on the West coast of
India, in Sumatra, in Java<sup>***</sup> and in China. "The Indian
Ocean," writes Sir William Hunter, "became an outlying domain of
Islam."<sup>****</sup> Out of Arabian travel-books Arabian writers
Spun the world-romance of Sinbad the Sailor, "the Arabian Odyssey,"
a true history in a romantic setting of Moslem travels in the ninth
and tenth centuries."<sup>*****</sup></p>

<b>9. PART OF MAP SHOWING THE GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE
ARABIANS</b><br>
(From Beazley's <i>Dawn of Modern Geography</i>, vol. iii.)</p>
<p>Sinbad's tracks have been traced by the modern scholar, and have
been reduced to the prose of geography. His flight from the island,
tied to the leg of a gigantic bird called a rue, to the valley of
Diamonds, is the romantic way of describing a voyage from
Madagascar to India. It is claimed that he has been traced to
Japan, to the Moluccas, to Java, and to Timor. The "old man of the
sea" who never spoke, who lived on fruits, whose skin was like a
buffalo's, and who had immense prehensile power in his legs, was
probably an orang-outang of Borneo or Sumatra,<sup>*</sup> the
ancestor of those animals whose habits have been so lovingly
described by Mr. Wallace.</p>
<p class="note">[* Beazley, vol. i. p. 448.]</p>
<p>We find then this great maritime race sailing in every sea. And
yet there were definite limits to their skill and to their
knowledge. Far as they sailed, they never Seem to have felt
themselves at home on the open ocean. Their writers even exaggerate
the old superstitious dread of its perils. "The Ocean," wrote
Edrisi about 1150, "encircles the ultimate bounds of the inhabited
earth, and all beyond is unknown. No one has been able to verify
anything concerning it, on account of its difficult and perilous
navigation, its great obscurity, its profound depth, and frequent
tempests; through fear of its mighty fishes and its haughty winds,
there is no mariner who dares to enter into its deep waters; if any
have done so, they have merely kept along its coasts, fearful of
departing from them."<sup>*</sup> Though they rejected Ptolemy's
doctrine of a landlocked Indian Ocean, they declared it impossible
to sail further South than Sofala or Madagascar or Zanzibar; so
thick and so mountainous became the Sea, and so full of monstrous
things.<sup>**</sup> And though they knew Sumatra, and Java, and
perhaps Timor, and though they must have shared whatever knowledge
may have been possessed by the Malays or Hindus, there seems no
evidence that they had heard of Australia. Sinbad the Sailor knew a
good deal about the orang-outang of Borneo or Sumatra, and he had
heard about the great bird of Madagascar; but there is no reason to
believe that he ever faced the Kangaroo.</p>
<p class="note">[* Quoted in Young's <i>Columbus</i>, vol. i. p.

<p class="note">[** Rainaud, p. 204.]</p>
<p>Still more interesting to us are the voyages of the Chinese.
From time immemorial the Chinese were famous navigators. They
invented, if not the compass, at all events something that
resembled the compass, so early as A.D. 121, and Mr. Beazley gives
us a picture of the little magnetized man who stood on the prow of
the Chinese Ship in the eighth and-ninth centuries, indicating the
South by outstretched hand<sup>*</sup>. Under such guidance their
great junks, capable of holding six hundred or seven hundred men,
sailed the seas from Canton to the Persian Gulf.<sup>**</sup> For,
till the Revolution of 878, the Chinese were a commercial nation,
welcoming the merchants of India, of Persia, and of Arabia, and
themselves making trading voyages to these distant lands. In China,
as in India, religion as well as commerce had made men travellers.
Chinese Buddhists travelled to India both overland and by sea.
Sometimes they visited Java on the way; for Java, we remember, was
at the time one of the great centres of Buddhist worship. There is
even a story that Chinese Buddhists visited and colonized a distant
land in the East, which some historians have identified with
America. After 878, it is true, a new policy reigned in China. The
foreign merchants were massacred or expelled. Chinese voyages
henceforth seldom extended beyond Ceylon. And yet, later
improvements in the compass seem to show that Chinese navigators
still continued energetic, scientific, progressive. The earliest
use of the water-compass, we are told, is fixed at 1111 to 1117,
nearly a century earlier than its first mention in Europe
(1180-1190).<sup>***</sup> In the thirteenth century the Mongol
conquest once more made China a commercial nation, with doors wide
open to foreign trade, and with merchant ships eager for new
markets, however distant. But on the subject of Chinese navigation
in the days of the Great Kaan our authority is Marco Polo, and we
now turn from our survey of the Indian Ocean in the thirteenth
century to follow the story of European travel.</p>

<p>Let us, for the present, note with emphasis the fact that our
story centres in Java. If Asia had any knowledge of Australia that
knowledge came by way of Java. If Arabs, Hindoos or Chinese had
heard aught of the great land of the South they must have heard it
from the Malays of that island. And we shall find that, when we ask
the question, what did European travellers know about Australia? we
have at the same time to ask the question, what did they know about
Java?</p>

<li>YULE'S <i>Cathay and the Way Thither</i>.</li>
<li>BEAZLEY'S <i>Dawn of Modern Geography</i>.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="short">
<p>In the early thirteenth century the Eastern world was turned
upside down by the Tartars or Mongols, whose conquests extended
over the whole of the North of ASia and the East of Europe. Now the
Mongols were heathen, but they were heathen with a singularly open
and inquisitive mind. Here then to Europe was both a danger and an
opportunity; a danger that the Mongol deluge, which had swept the
East, might also sweep the West: an opportunity to convert the
open-minded heathen to Christian civilization, and to find in him
an ally against the Mahomedans.</p>
<p>It was just at this time that the sons of Francis were seeking
knightly venture in distant lands; and in 1253 one of them, William
de Rubruquis, had visited the Great Kaan in the heart of Mongolia,
and came back to tell his fellow Franciscan Roger Bacon of the
singular "Parliament of Religions," held at the suggestion of the
Mongol chief, and under his presidency, in which Saracens,
Christians and Buddhists had contended for their Faiths. He brought
back news also that Cathay was bounded on the East by an open Sea:
news which may have been in Roger Bacon's mind when he quoted the
opinion of Aristotle that the distance by Sea from Spain to Asia
could not be very great: an opinion which did much to launch
Columbus on the voyage in which he sought Cathay, and found
America.</p>
<p>But, for the present, the news was of greatest interest to men
of commerce, and especially to merchants of the great Italian
Republics, who for centuries had been agents and middlemen for
Europe in the trade which brought to rich men in the West the
indispensable luxuries produced by the East and by the East alone.
Jewels and pearls, precious woven fabrics of silk and of cotton,
spices of all sorts, had been brought from the East by various
routes, by land and by sea, till they arrived at a string of
seaports on the Mediterranean, extending from Constantinople to
Alexandria, whence Italian merchants distributed them throughout
Europe. While the Crusades prospered, Christian merchants had
actually possessed these invaluable ports. But in the thirteenth
century the Crusades were coming to an end, and, with the fall of
Acre, this commanding position was completely lost, though both
Christians and Mohamedans were by this time sufficiently commercial
to be willing to continue a trade very profitable to both. And now
the marvellous Liberalism of the Mongol heathen gave the merchant a
chance to outflank the Mohamedan powers altogether, to penetrate
into the very heart of the golden East, and to survey for himself
the treasure-houses of the world.</p>
<p>In about 1260, two prosperous Venetian merchants, Nicolo and
Matteo Polo, took a "rich and varied cargo of merchandise" to
Constantinople, and determined, in order "to improve their
capital," that they would prosecute their journeys into the Black
Sea. They sailed to the Crimea, thence took horse to the court of a
Chief of the Western Tartars, and in the end, journeying through
Central Asia, came to the court of the Great Kaan<sup>*</sup>
Kublai in Cathay itself. The Great Kaan received them with
"condescension and affability," made "earnest enquiries" about the
condition of Europe, and "above all he questioned them particularly
respecting the Pope, the affairs of the Church, and the religious
worship and doctrine of the Christians."</p>
<p class="note">[* See note on the words Kaan and Khan in Yule's
Marco Polo, vol. i. p. 10. "Polo always writes Kaan as applied to
the Great Khan, and does not, I think, use Khan in any form."]</p>
<p>Finally he Sent the Polos home with a request to the Pope to
send him one hundred men of learning, thoroughly acquainted with
the principles of the Christian religion as well as with the Seven
Arts. The Polos reached Venice in 1269, and set out again for
Cathay in 1271. They had failed to induce men of learning to
accompany them; but they took with them Marco, the son of Nicolo.
They journeyed through Acre and Bagdad to Ormuz; then took "the
straight road for Cathay" northward of the Himalayas; and, after a
journey of three and a half years, they arrived at the Court of the
Great Kaan in 1275. They were "graciously received." Marco was
"enrolled among his attendants of honour." He "adopted the manners
of the Tartars, and acquired a proficiency in four different
languages." He was employed on "important concerns of State,"
travelled as far as Tibet and Bengal and "the Indian seas," and
"endeavoured wherever he went to obtain correct information, and
made notes of all he saw and heard."</p>
<p>In the course of seventeen years the Polos amassed "considerable
wealth in jewels and gold," and now wished to return to Venice. The
Great Kaan at first refused permission. It chanced, however, that a
Mongol princess had to be convoyed to Persia, there to be married.
The overland route was blocked by wars among Tartar princes. Just
then Marco returned from a voyage he had made to "the East Indies,"
and guaranteed a passage to Persia "with the utmost safety." The
offer was accepted; and the Polos, "as being persons well skilled
in the practice of navigation," were placed in command of a fleet
to take the princess to Persia. The fleet was composed of "fourteen
ships, each having four masts, and capable of being navigated with
nine sails, and there were at least four or five that had crews of
two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty men." The voyage was
a long affair. After about three months they arrived at Java Minor
(Sumatra), where they were detained five months by contrary winds.
They "employed eighteen months in the Indian seas." At last they
landed their princess in Persia, and journeyed on by way of
Trebizond and Constantinople to Venice (1295). According to the
traditionary story, they were not recognized till they ripped open
their threadbare garments, and poured on the table a stream of
costly jewels.</p>
<p>In 1298 Marco was given command of a galley in a great naval
battle with the Genoese. The Venetians were defeated, and Marco was
among the captured. In prison he met with a gentleman of Pisa, who
was so entertained by his anecdotes of travel that he wrote them
down, and made out of them the most famous and most important
travel book in the world's history, "the Book of Ser Marco Polo
concerning the kingdoms and marvels of the East." "From the
creation of Adam to this present day," declares our Pisan editor,
"no man whether pagan, or Saracen, or Christian, or other, ever Saw
or enquired into so much and such great things as Marco Polo."</p>
<p>The claim was entirely just. How enormous was the sudden
addition made to geographic knowledge we best realize by reading
the pages in which Roger Bacon, most up-to-date and dare-devil of
Marco's contemporaries, sought by patient study of Aristotle and
Pliny to discover the contents of the unknown world of East and
South. Now, for the first time, and at one magic Stroke, there
stood revealed all the kingdoms of the world, and all the glory
thereof. From Constantinople to Pekin, from Pekin to Java, from
Java to Colombo and to Aden, from Cairo to Madagascar, the whole
Eastern world was described in convincing detail. The substance of
the book was based on his own travels and his own experiences
recorded in his "notes." And, where he could not see for himself,
he had made careful inquiries from those who had seen, or who
claimed to have seen. He had studied maps and charts of Chinese and
Arabians. He had listened to all the traveller's talcs told by
"persons worthy of credit," all the rumours and legends written in
books or passed from mouth to mouth: and he had put down
everything, facts and fancies, in his book of marvels for what they
might seem worth.</p>

<p>And thus we get a wonderful picture of things seen and things
heard, a picture painted on a gigantic canvas, and with Venetian
colour. It revolutionized geographical conceptions. It was the main
inspiration of Columbus. It influenced for centuries the minds of
those who made voyages in Australian seas. And still, to the modern
student, it is both true history and delightful romance, embodying
geographical knowledge and guesses as to the contents of the Indian
Ocean at the end of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>All things that men knew about the Indian Ocean Marco Polo
knew.<sup>*</sup> The wisdom of China was at his disposal, and we
shall notice in a moment what he learnt from it about the Southern
World. Though he never visited Java, he met Malay seamen in the
ports of "the Indian Seas," and took notes of their talk. Indian
Buddhists,&mdash;"Idolaters" he irreverently calls them,&mdash;he
met both in Bengal and in Ceylon. Arabs or "Saracens" he met
everywhere. The Great Kaan's prime minister was a Saracen, who
oppressed the native Chinese, caused a rebellion, and came to a bad
end. In Sumatra, Marco found Saracen merchants converting the
idolaters to the religion of Mahomed, and they told him of "men
with tails, a span in length," who lived a Secluded life among the
mountains&mdash;the descendants evidently of Sinbad's Old Man of
the Sea!</p>
<p class="note">[* See Yule's Map (vol. i. p. 108) giving "Probable
view of Marco Polo's own geography," reproduced as <a href=
"#il-10">Illustration 10</a>.]</p>
<p>He found Saracens again in Ceylon, disputing with the
"idolaters" the great question as to whether the famous relics of
teeth and hair had belonged to Adam or to Buddha, and representing
the former view so effectually to the Great Kaan that he sent an
embassy to the King of Ceylon to demand them, and actually obtained
from him "two large back teeth together with some of the hair of
the Father of Mankind." He talked with "mariners and eminent
pilots," and he read "the writings of those who have navigated the
Indian seas," and learnt that those seas contained no fewer than
12,700 islands. He heard of the unhappy island where there were men
without women; and of the perhaps still more unhappy island where
there were women without men&mdash;all "baptized Christians, but
holding the law of the Old Testament." He heard also of the very
large island of Socotra, where all the people were Christians, and
did big business in "ambergris voided from the entrails of whales."
And he heard also of the great island of Madagascar, in circuit
3,000 miles, "one of the largest and most fertile in the world,"
and of "numerous islands lying further South," which however were
not frequented, in consequence of the current running so Strongly
to the Southward as to render the return impossible!</p>
<p>"Beyond Madagascar again lies the island of Zanzibar, 2,000
miles in circuit, peopled by naked blacks, with hair So crisp that
even when dipped in water it can with difficulty be drawn out, with
large mouths, turned-up noses, long ears, and eyes so large and
frightful that they have the aspect of demons"&mdash;a vivid,
though somewhat heightened, portrait of the negroes of the African
Continent. Marco's Arab friends told him also that the people of
Madagascar spoke of "an extraordinary kind of bird which they call
a rue," in form resembling an eagle, but incomparably greater in
size, being so large and strong as to seize an elephant with its
talons, lift it in the air, as jackass<sup>*</sup> lifts snake,
letting it fall to the ground, in order that it may prey upon the
carcase.</p>
<p class="note">[* The Australian Kookooburra, or Laughing
Jackass.]</p>
<p>Marco thought the creatures must be griffins, such as are
represented in paintings, half birds half lions; but it was
insisted that they were wholly birds, like eagles. The Great Kaan
had sent messengers all the way to inquire into this extraordinary
phenomenon; "and, when they returned to the presence of his
Majesty, they brought with them (as I have heard) a feather of a
rue, positively affirmed to have measured ninety spans, and the
quill part to have been two palms in circumference. This surprising
exhibition afforded his Majesty extreme pleasure."</p>
<p>The science of zoology has made attempts to account for the rue
by references to various giant birds now extinct. What is evident
is that the rue who lifted elephants into the air, was the same
mighty bird to whose leg Sinbad tied himself, and which conveyed
him Swiftly from the great island in the South to the Valley of the
Diamonds in India.</p>
<p>But the special interest of Marco's book for us is the
information he gives about Chinese navigators in the direction of
Australia in the days of the Great Kaan. His description of China
is written from intimate firsthand knowledge extending over
seventeen years, and from notes taken on the spot. China is the
seat of incomparably the most Splendid civilization in the world.
"The magnificence of the Grand Kaan is unequalled by that of any
monarch in the world." "In respect of the numbers of his Subjects,
the extent of his territory, the amount of his revenue, he
surpasses every sovereign that has heretofore been or that now is
in the world." Province after province of the huge Empire Marco
surveys, giving a monotonous picture of a civilization far in
advance, both in intellectual and in material things, of the most
progressive countries of Europe. And this civilization found its
centres in huge seaport towns, with populations running up to
1,600,000 families, with streets well paved and well drained, with
excellent arrangements of police and fire-brigade, and "surpassing
in grandeur and in wealth every other city in the world." This
gigantic prosperity was founded on maritime commerce. To Cambaluc
(Peking) "are brought articles of greater cost and rarity, and in
greater abundance of all kinds, than to any other city in the
world. For people of every description, and from every region,
bring things (including all the costly wares of India), some for
the sovereign, some for the court, some for the city which is so
great, some for the great hosts of the Emperor, which are quartered
round about; and thus, between court and city, the quantity brought
in is endless."</p>
<p>In Singu (I-ching-hien)&mdash;and Singu was "a city of no great
Size"&mdash;Marco saw 15,000 ships at one time. Kinsay (Hang-chau),
"the City of Heaven," one hundred miles in circuit, its canals
crossed by twelve thousand bridges, has, twenty-five miles away
down the river, "a town and an excellent haven, with a vast amount
of shipping, which is engaged in the traffic to and from India and
other foreign parts, exporting and importing many kinds of wares,
by which the city benefits." "Messer Marco heard it stated by one
of the Great Kaan's officers of customs that the quantity of pepper
introduced daily for consumption into the city of Kinsay amounted
to 43 loads, each load being equal to 223 lbs."</p>
<p>This great ocean trade was carried in ships which Marco
describes in detail:&mdash;"These ships, you must know, are of fir
timber. They have but one deck, though each of them contains some
fifty or sixty cabins, wherein the merchants abide greatly at their
ease, every man having one to himself. The Ship hath but one
rudder, but it hath four masts; and sometimes they have two
additional masts, which they ship and unship at pleasure. Moreover
the larger of their vessels have some thirteen compartments or
severances in the interior, made with planking strongly framed, in
case mayhap the ship should spring a leak either by running on a
rock or by the blow of a hungry whale...The fastenings are all of
good iron nails, and the sides are double, one plank laid over the
other, and caulked outside and in. The planks are not pitched, for
those people do not have any pitch, but they daub the sides with
another matter, deemed by them far better than pitch; it is this.
You see they take some lime and some chopped hemp, and these they
knead together with a certain wood-oil; and, when the three are
thoroughly amalgamated, they hold like any glue. And with this
mixture they do paint their ships. Each of their great ships
requires at least 200 mariners, some of them 300. They are indeed
of great size, for one ship shall carry 5,000 or 6,000 baskets of
pepper. And aboard these ships, you must know, when there is no
wind they use sweeps, and these sweeps are so big that to pull them
requires four mariners to each. Each great ship has certain large
barks or tenders attached to it; these are large enough to carry
1000 baskets of pepper, and carry fifty or sixty mariners apiece,
and they are likewise moved by oars...There are also ten small
boats for the service of each great ship...When the ship is under
sail she carries these boats slung to her Sides."</p>
<p>Now, how far did the Chinese merchants, sailing in these
splendid ships, penetrate the ocean in the direction of Australia?
Marco tells what he knows in a passage that requires careful study.
After completing the description of Cathay, the Pisan gentleman,
who is telling us what Marco had told him, remarks that "our Book
as yet does not contain nearly all that we purpose to put therein.
For we have still to tell you all about the people of India, and
the notable things of that country, which are well worth
describing, for they are marvellous indeed. What we shall tell is
all true, and without any lies. And we shall set down all the
particulars in writing just as Messer Marco Polo related them. And
he well knew the facts."</p>
<p>After telling, apparently from hearsay, of Cipango (Japan), with
its palaces roofed with gold&mdash;gold which Columbus hoped to
melt into coin to pay for the Crusades that should recover the Holy
Sepulchre&mdash;he describes the "Eastern sea of Chin." "I tell you
with regard to that Eastern sea of Chin, according to what is said
by the experienced pilots and mariners of those parts, there be
7,459 Islands in the waters frequented by the said mariners; and
that is how they know that fact, for their whole life is spent in
navigating that sea. And there is not one of those Islands but
produces valuable and odorous woods like the lign-aloe, aye and
better too; and they produce also a great quantity of spices. For
example, in those Islands grows pepper as white as snow, as well as
the black in great quantities. In fact the riches of those Islands
is something wonderful, whether in gold or precious stones, or in
all manner of spices, but they lie so far off from the main land
that it is hard to get to them. And when the ships of Zayton and
Kinsay do voyage thither they make vast profits by their
venture.</p>
<p>"It takes them a whole year for the voyage, going in winter and
returning in summer. For in that Sea there be but two winds that
blow, the one that carries them outward, and the other that brings
them homeward; and the one of these winds blows all the winter, and
the other all the summer. And you must know these regions are so
far from India that it takes a long time also for the voyage
thence...Now let us have done with that region which is very
inaccessible and out of the way. Moreover Messer Marco Polo never
was there. And let me tell you the Great Kann has nothing to do
with them, nor do they render him any tribute or service."</p>
<p>He therefore returns to his description of the Chinese coast,
and takes us Southward to "the great country called Chamba," the
modern Cochin China, a very rich region, where the people are
idolaters, and pay a yearly tribute of elephants, and nothing but
elephants, to the Great Kaan. And then comes the passage that is of
especial interest to us. "When you sail from Chamba 1,500 miles in
a course between South and South-East, you come to a great island
called Java. And the experienced mariners of those Islands, who
know the matter well, say that it is the greatest Island in the
world, and has a compass of more than 3,000 miles. The Island is of
surpassing wealth, producing black pepper, nutmegs, spikenard,
galingah, cubebs, cloves and all other kinds of spices. The Island
is also frequented by a vast amount of shipping, and by merchants
who buy and sell costly goods for which they reap great profit.
Indeed the treasure" ("gold," says another manuscript) "of this
Island is so great as to be past telling. And I can assure you the
Great Kaan never could get possession of this Island, on account of
its great distance, and the great expense of an expedition thither.
The merchants of Zayton and Manzi draw annually great returns from
the country."</p>
<p>Marco's words are evidence that Chinese merchants undertook long
voyages, sometimes lasting a year, among the Spice Islands. It is
clear too that they had a prosperous trade with Java, though the
account given of that island (from hearsay again) is curiously
inexact; and it has been thought that, in the matter of gold, he
has confused Java with Borneo. Especially noteworthy is the report
that Java is "the largest island in the world, being in circuit
above 3,000 miles"&mdash;about double the truth, says Yule. We
Shall notice again and again evidence of the fact that navigators
long remained curiously ignorant of the South coast of Java. So
late as the end of the Sixteenth century there were well-informed
geographers who doubted that Java had a South coast, and who were
inclined to think of it, as ancient geographers had thought of
Ceylon, as the projecting tip of the unknown continent of the
South.</p>
<p>"<i>When you leave Java</i>,"&mdash;<i>all</i> the manuscripts
and texts, without exception, have these words, says
Yule&mdash;"and sail for 700 miles on a course between South and
South-West, you arrive at two Islands, a greater and a less. The
one is called Sondur and the other Condur. As there is nothing
about them worth mentioning, let us go on 500 miles&mdash;another
manuscript has 50 miles&mdash;beyond Sondur, and then we find
another country which is called Locac. It is a good country and a
rich; it is on the mainland; and it has a King of its own. The
people are Idolaters, and have a peculiar language, and pay tribute
to nobody, for their country is so situated that no one can enter
it to do them ill. Indeed, if it were possible to get at it, the
Great Kaan would soon bring them under subjection to him. In this
country the brazil which we make use of grows in great plants; and
they also have gold in incredible quantity. They have elephants
likewise, and much game. In this kingdom too are gathered all the
porcelain shells which are used for small change in all those
Islands as I have told you before. There is nothing else to
mention, except that this is a very wild region, visited by few
people; nor does the King desire that any strangers should frequent
the country and so find out about his treasures and other
resources." Another manuscript accounts for lack of visitors to
Locac by the phrase "so inhuman are its inhabitants."</p>
<p>"When you leave Locac, and sail for 500 miles towards the South,
you come to an island called Pentam, a very wild place. All the
wood that grows therein consists of odoriferous trees...When you
leave the island of Pentam, and sail about 100 miles you reach the
Island of Java the less. For all its name 'tis none so small but
that it has a compass of 2,000 miles and more. Now I will tell you
all about this island. You see there are upon it eight Kingdoms and
eight crowned Kings. The people are all Idolaters, and every
Kingdom has a language of its own. This island hath great abundance
of treasure, with costly spices, lign-aloes and spikenard, and many
other things that never come into our parts. Now I am going to tell
you all about these eight Kingdoms, or at least the greater part of
them. But let me premise one marvellous thing, and that is the fact
that this Island lies so far to the South that the North Star,
little or much, is never to be seen!" In one Kingdom "Messer Marco
Polo was detained five months by the weather, which would not allow
his going on. And I tell you here again, neither the Pole Star nor
the Stars of the Maestro (Great Bear or Plough?) were to be seen.
The people here are wild Idolaters; they have a King who is great
and rich, but they also call themselves subjects of the Great Kaan.
When Messer Marco was detained on this Island five months by
contrary winds, he landed with about 2,000 men in his company; they
dug large ditches on the landward side to encompass the party,
resting at either end on the sea-haven, and within the ditches they
made bulwarks or stockades of timber for fear of those brutes of
man-eaters." Messer Marco Polo gave a vivid account of things seen
or heard of in the island; "wild' elephants," "numerous unicorns"
(rhinoceroses), and "men with tails" who "live in the
mountains."</p>
<p>"When you leave Java the less, you sail North about 150 miles,
and then you come to two Islands; Necuveran and Angamanain. In the
former are cloves and brazil, and sundry other good spices. In the
latter, I assure you, all the men have heads like dogs, and teeth
and eyes likewise; in fact, in the face they are all just like big
mastiff dogs! They are a most cruel generation, and eat everybody
that they can catch." "When you leave the Island of Angamanain, and
sail about 1,000 miles in a direction a little South of West, you
come to the island of Seilan (Ceylon), which is in good sooth the
best island of its size in the world. You must know that it has a
compass of 2,400 miles, but in old times it was greater still, for
it then had a circuit of about 3,600 miles, as you find in the
charts of the mariners of those seas." And he describes its
precious stones, and especially a ruby the King was reported to
possess, "which is the finest and biggest in the world, about a
palm in length and as thick as a man's arm, the most resplendent
object upon earth, quite free from flaw and as red as fire."</p>
<p>Now all this is very curious, and even amazing! For, if we take
this passage as it stands in our texts, Marco Polo describes a
great and fertile and auriferous continent called Locac, as
existing some 1200 (or 750?) miles between South and South-West of
Java. We think at once of a possible discovery of the North-West
coast of Australia, though we are puzzled to find mention not of
kangaroos but of elephants. And about 600 miles South of Locac is
the very large and rich island of Java the lesser, an island which
Marco Polo had visited and explored, having been detained there for
five months by contrary winds! That is to say, the famous Venetian
seaman had actually visited the great Southern Continent, and its
adjacent islands, which in fact all lay on the ordinary sea route
from China to Ceylon!</p>
<p>Thus, according to our manuscripts, Marco Polo wrote, or rather
spoke; and thus he was understood by his readers. In the Globe
which Behaim constructed in 1492, the year when Columbus first
sailed West, Java Minor stands in the place where Tasmania
existed.<sup>*</sup> Mercator's map of 1569<sup>**</sup> drew the
outline of a great Southern Continent in a way that suggested at
least the possibility of vague knowledge of the North coast of
Australia.</p>
<p class="note">[* Collingridge, p. 80. See <a href=
"#il-11">Illustration 11</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See <a href="#il-21">Illustration 21</a>.]</p>
<p>On what might conceivably be Dampier Land he wrote "Lucach
Regnum"; and on what might conceivably be Arnhem Land he wrote
"Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt,
propter gentum inhumanitatem." Now each is a curious printer's
error for Locach; and Mercator is simply copying out Marco Polo's
phrases, and interpreting them to describe parts of the great
continent of the South. And in the midst of what might possibly be
the Gulf of Carpentaria, in a position roughly corresponding to
Groote Eylandt, are the islands of Pentan and Java Minor, the
latter with a legend summing up the information given by Marco
Polo. Still later, when in 1619 the Dutch sailor Houtman hit the
coast of Western Australia, he described the fact by saying that he
"suddenly came across the Southland of Beach." He believed that the
land which the Dutch called Eendrachtsland, and which we call
Western Australia, was the same continent which Marco Polo was
thought to have described under the name of Locach or Beach,
existing about 1200 or 750 miles southward of Java, a continent
where gold abounded to a degree scarcely credible, where elephants
were found, and inhuman inhabitants.</p>
<p>And yet modern critics have made clear that the belief that
Marco Polo had described a continent and islands lying far to the
South of Java was founded on nothing more solid than a
misunderstanding of Marco Polo's meaning. In describing the
countries between China and India to the Pisan gentleman in the
prison at Genoa, Marco had reached Chamba or Cochin China. At this
point it had occurred to him to make a few remarks about Java,
which, as we have seen, he described inaccurately, and probably
from the loose talk of Malay, Chinese, or Arab merchants and
navigators. He then resumed his narrative of travel, and spoke of
places you come to after leaving Chamba; and his distances are
therefore measured not from Java but from Chamba. But, either the
Pisan gentleman misunderstood him, or the copyist of the Pisan
gentleman's manuscript made a mistake.</p>
<p>It was thought that, having described Java, Marco must have
<i>visited</i> Java, and that the distances of the place mentioned
must be measured not from Chamba but from Java. And hence the
notion arose and persisted that Marco had voyaged from China to
India by a route that had brought him to lands in the Latitude of
Western Australia or Tasmania. If we measure our distances from
Chamba or Cochin China, the story at once becomes intelligible.
Locac, the land of gold and elephants, was not part of the great
Southern continent; it was part of Siam or Cambodia. Java Minor was
not Tasmania or Groote Eiland; it was Sumatra. It was hence that he
sailed one hundred and fifty miles to the islands of Nocuveran and
Angamanain&mdash;the Nicobar Islands, and the Andamans&mdash;where
lived the dog-headed men of Arabian legend, and thence a thousand
miles South-West to Ceylon.</p>
<p>Thus we have to notice both what Marco Polo said, and what he
was thought to have said. For both what he said, and what he was
thought to have said, are important facts in our story. We learn
from him that the merchants of China, like the merchants of India
and of Arabia, traded with the Spice Islands and with Java, and
that there prevailed a vague and inaccurate conception of Java,
which declared it to be the greatest island in the world. Marco had
nothing to tell of lands Southward of Java. But his words were
misunderstood, and it was believed that he had described, and had
even visited, a continent and islands in the far South, which
geographers of the sixteenth century identified with the Terra
Incognita of ancient belief, and which Dutch navigators of the
seventeenth century thought they had actually found in
Eendrachtsland.</p>

<p>Other travellers, commercial and missionary, following the
footsteps of Marco Polo, pushed through the door opened by the
liberalism of the Mongol Kaans. An interesting story it is, that
Mr. Beazley has to tell, of mission labours of Franciscans and
Dominicans in Mongolia, in China, in Persia, and in India. The hero
of the story is John de Monte Corvino, who, after long years among
Saracens and heathens, travelled through India, leaving us "the
first good picture of India drawn by a Latin Christian," and,
passing the home-coming Polos on the way, arrived in China in 1292
or 1293, a pioneer to regions to which "never came apostle or
disciple of apostles." For thirty years he laboured in
China&mdash;a Christian Archbishop of Pekin in the early fourteenth
century&mdash;building churches, baptizing thousands of converts,
and at last dying in 1328. The Mongols still held open the door,
and in those days one could get from Europe to Pekin, travelling
through Southern Asia, in six or seven months! There were
Franciscan missions among the Tartars of Persia. There were
glorious Franciscan martyrs in India. Here they lived and laboured
and died, defying the "calores horribilissimi et importabiles
hominibus extraneis," and suggesting that the Pope ought to have a
fleet on the Indian Sea! One of them had heard of Java as an island
"more than seven thousand miles in circuit, producing nutmegs,
mace, and all the finest spices, beautiful white mice, shaggy
pygmies, and cloves of deadly odour."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Beazley, vol. iii. p. 228.]</p>
<p>Of special interest in our story is the "Journal concerning
strange things which he saw among the Tartars of the East," which a
Franciscan Friar named Odoric<sup>*</sup> dictated to another Friar
in "the place of St. Anthony of Padua" in May 1330&mdash;a journal
which is described by Mr. Beazley as "the fullest, the most
graphic, and the most amusing picture of Asia left by any religious
traveller of this age." "Being desirous to travel unto the foreign
and remote nations of infidels," Friar Odoric had seen and heard
"great and miraculous things," and he will tell nothing save those
things which "either I saw with mine own eyes, or heard the same
reported by credible and substantial persons."</p>
<p class="note">[* See discussion of Odoric's life in Yule's
<i>Cathay</i>. He started about 1316, returned in 1330, and died in
1331. His reputation for sanctity grew, for reasons that are
unknown, and in 1755 he was declared a saint. His narrative,
however, "gives the impression of a man of little refinement, with
a very strong taste for roving and seeing strange countries, but
not much for preaching and asceticism."]</p>
<p>After describing his journey through Persia and India to
Sumatra&mdash;he is the first European who distinctly and
undoubtedly mentions the name of Sumatra&mdash;he tells us that he
travelled further into another island, called Java, the compass
whereof by sea is three thousand miles. Java is "thoroughly
inhabited and is thought to be the principal island in the world";
other manuscripts say variously "the best island," "the second
best," "the third best"!<sup>*</sup> It produces all kinds of
spices. Its King has "a most brave and sumptuous palace," with roof
of pure gold, stairs of gold and silver, floors paved with gold and
silver, walls covered with plates of beaten gold, whereupon are
engraved the pictures of knights. The Kaan of Cathay has had many
wars with the King of Java; but the said King hath always overcome
and vanquished.</p>
<p class="note">[* Beazley, vol. iii. p. 265, note 6.]</p>
<p>Near this island is the country called Panten, which has been
identified with Singapore Island,<sup>*</sup> and "by the coast of
this country is the sea called <i>Mare Mortuum</i>, which runneth
continuously Southward, into the which whosoever falleth is never
seen after."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Yule's <i>Cathay</i>, vol. ii. p. 156. Cordier's
<i>Ser Marco Polo</i>, p. 105.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Mauro's map (fifteenth century) has a legend in
the region of the South-East of India, "ships sailing towards the
South which allow themselves to approach the Dim Islands will be
carried by the currents into the Darkness, and, once entered into
those regions, through the density of the air, and of the tenacious
waters, they must perish." (Yule's <i>Cathay</i>, vol. ii. p. 160).
See <a href="#il-13">map</a>. Barros, a Portuguese writer of the
sixteenth century, says that the natives of Java hold that "whoever
should proceed beyond the straits of Bali to the South would be
hurried away by strong currents so as to never return."]</p>
<p>Friar Odoric then takes us to Campa, Marco Polo's Chamba (Cochin
China), where fishes pay homage to the emperor by casting
themselves on shore for the space of three days, and where he saw a
tortoise "bigger in compass than the dome of St. Anthony's Church
in Padua." Next he mentions that he travelled on further by ocean
sea to the South, till he came to an island named Nicoveran (the
Nicobars), two thousand miles in circuit, "wherein men and women
have dogs' faces, and worship an ox for their god." Then he
mentions Sillan (Ceylon), with its huge mountain, where, the
inhabitants report, Adam and Eve mourned for Abel for the space of
five hundred years, weeping so copiously that their tears formed a
lake which still existed;" howbeit, I proved that to be false,
because I saw the water flow in the lake." Here he saw "fowls as
big as our country geese, having two heads, and other miraculous
things which no man would credit, unless he saw them with his own
eyes"&mdash;though the Friar will relate "nothing but of that only
whereof I am as sure as a man can be sure." From Ceylon he
travelled East to Mangi in China, wherein the Friars have two
places of abode. Here he lived for three years, and he gives an
account of the country which is evidently based on personal
knowledge.</p>
<p>Our modern critic accepts Friar Odoric as a veracious witness,
telling according to his measure of ability of things seen and
heard. It is admitted, however, that "the legendary jumble" of the
chapter on the Nicobars, after a personal visit to those islands,
is "disturbing."<sup>*</sup> I confess that I am a good deal
disturbed&mdash;and not only by the dog-faced men of the Nicobars.
Friar Odoric seems to follow somewhat too closely in the footsteps
of Marco Polo, not only as a traveller but also as a writer. His
account of Java looks very like a combination of Marco Polo's Java
and Marco Polo's Cipango.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Beazley, vol. ii. p, 268.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Yule, however, thinks Odoric is describing the
old Javan palaces and temples covered with gold leaf (vol. ii. p.
152).]</p>
<p>However, the point of interest to us is that the Friar's
statements, whether true or untrue, were believed by the men of his
time, and of the next time. They were enormously advertised by
being incorporated, without acknowledgement, in the most successful
wonder-book of the Middle Ages, <i>The Travels of Sir John
Mandeville</i>. And, finally, the curious and inexplicable
disarrangement of the Friar's material,<sup>*</sup> his description
of the Andamans and Ceylon in an order which implies that they are
not far away to the South of Cochin China, still more confounded
the growing confusion of the geography of these seas.</p>
<p class="note">[* This is discussed in the last edition of Yule's
Cathay.]</p>
<p>About a hundred years later, another Venetian traveller returned
home to add to this confusion. In the year 1444, says Poggio
Bracciolini, a very famous scholar of the Italian Renaissance, a
Venetian traveller named Nicolo de Conti, who had penetrated to the
interior of India, came to Pope Eugenius IV., craving absolution,
inasmuch as in his travels he had been compelled to renounce his
Faith. "I, being very desirous of his conversation," says Poggio,
"questioned him diligently." He convinced himself that de Conti had
"gone further than any former traveller ever penetrated, for he
crossed the Ganges, and travelled far beyond Taprobane (a name
which in this narrative means not Ceylon but Sumatra!) to a point
which there is no evidence to show that any European had yet
reached, except the commander of the fleet of Alexander and the
Roman citizen mentioned by Pliny." Poggio's ignorance amazes one!
The commander of the fleet of Alexander had sailed from the mouth
of the Indus to the mouth of the Euphrates. The Roman citizen
mentioned by Pliny had been driven by a storm to Taprobane, which
then meant not Sumatra but Ceylon. It seems inexplicable that
Poggio, with his keen interest in distant travels, should mention
as the travellers who had hitherto penetrated furthest beyond the
Ganges, not Marco Polo nor Friar Odoric, but two persons of ancient
times, neither of whom had sailed eastward of Ceylon! Without any
sort of criticism Poggio sets down statements which seem to add
nothing to the knowledge given in the book of Marco Polo, and which
<i>do</i> add very considerably to the extraordinary errors already
produced by misunderstandings of Marco Polo and Friar Odoric. Thus
Poggio understood Nicolo to say that Malepur, where the body of St.
Thomas lies buried, really a town near Madras, is "situated in the
second gulf beyond the Indus"; which seems to have been interpreted
to mean that it was on the far side of what is now called the Gulf
of Siam! "In the middle of the Gulf," continues de Conti, "is a
very noble island called Zeilan"; a statement which, apparently,
was understood to confirm the impression, already got from Marco
Polo and Friar Odoric, that Ceylon was somewhere to the South of
Cochin China! Meanwhile de Conti has identified the ancient
Taprobane, not with Ceylon, but with Sumatra, which he describes as
an island no less than six thousand miles in circuit! Thence Nicolo
passes to the region that is especially interesting to us. "In
Central India" (!), he writes, "are two islands, towards the
extreme confines of the world, both called Java. One of these
islands is three thousand miles, the other two thousand. Both are
situated towards the East, and are distinguished from each other by
the names of the Greater and the less." "These islands," explains
Poggio, "lay in his route to the Ocean. They are distant from this
continent one month's sail, and lie within one hundred miles of
each other. He remained here for nine months with wife and
children...At fifteen days beyond these islands Eastward two others
are found; the one is called Sandai, in which nutmegs and mace
grow; the other is called Bandam; this is the only island in which
cloves grow, which are exported thence to the Java islands. The sea
is not navigable beyond these islands, and the stormy atmosphere
keeps navigators at a distance."</p>
<p>The conversation which interested Poggio so deeply seems to
carry us not one step beyond Marco Polo! All that Nicolo adds are
certain enormous mistakes. His Java the Greater is simply a copy of
the Java Major of Marco Polo and of Odoric, a huge island of three
thousand miles in circuit. Polo's Java Minor, an island of two
thousand miles in circuit, was Sumatra. But de Conti had already
described Sumatra, under the name of Taprobane, as an island of six
thousand miles in circuit! <i>His</i> Java the lesser, an island of
two thousand miles, only one hundred miles away from Java, if it
represents anything on earth, must represent Sumbava, in reality a
very small island. Then we have the names of two Spice Islands; and
then a passage which reminds one of the <i>Mare Mortuum</i> of
Friar Odoric, declaring that navigation beyond these islands is
impossible, on account of the stormy atmosphere. Surely Poggio
could have learnt as much from the book of Marco Polo and the
Journal of Friar Odoric as he learnt from the conversation of
Nicolo de Conti.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See Yule's chapter (vol. i. p. 116) on
"Contemporary recognition of Polo and his book." Also
Nordenskiold's <i>Periplus</i>, p. 140, on scholars' ignorance of
Marco Polo. Also Fiske's <i>Discovery of America</i>, vol. i, p.
28. "Here was altogether too much geographical knowledge for
European ignorance in those days to digest. While Marco's book
attracted much attention, its influence upon the progress of
geography was slighter than it would have been if addressed to a
more enlightened public. Many of its sober statements of facts were
received with incredulity...Marco Polo's acquisitions were
altogether too far in advance of his age to be readily
assimilated."]</p>
<p>And now one more Italian traveller in the far East comes to add
to our knowledge and to our problems! In the year 1502, Ludovico di
Varthema, "longing for novelty as a thirsty man longs for fresh
water," set off in his travels eastwards. He had experience of
novelty in great plenty in Cairo, in Mecca, in Aden; and then
joined a Persian merchant to "explore a good part of the world, in
order to see and know many things." They passed to India, where the
merchant found business spoiled by the wars that followed the
arrival of the Portuguese&mdash;an event that will become of
first-rate importance in the next chapter of our story.</p>
<p>Joined now by Christian merchants of India, they made for the
Straits of Malacca. "More ships," says Varthema, "arrive here than
in any other part of the world, especially with spices." The
Malaysian pirates, who had their centre of operations at Malacca,
are described as "the worst race that was ever created on earth."
Then they sailed on to the Spice Islands, and Varthema is first of
Europeans to give an entirely trustworthy account of Banda, its
nutmegs and mace, and of the Moluccas with their grand monopoly of
cloves, which made these tiny specks of islands the most desired
places in the whole world. Thence, still in company with his
merchant friends, he sailed towards "the beautiful island called
Java," which is once more described as "the largest island in the
world, and the most rich." He gives an account of Java which seems
singularly unconvincing. The island, he says, produces silk, gold
and the best emeralds in the world. The Javans are "the most
trustworthy men in the world." Yet, he adds, "we determined to
return, partly through the fear of their cruelty in eating men,
partly also through the extreme cold" (!), "and also because there
was hardly any other place known to them," i.e., his merchant
friends.<sup>*</sup> So he returned to India, where he joined the
victorious Portuguese, and told them stories of the Spice Islands,
which led to an expedition of great consequence in our story.</p>
<p class="note">[* Varthema, p. 258.]</p>
<p>But, at present, the chief interest to us of Varthema's
narrative is the curious remark, which, he says, was made by the
captain of the boat on which he sailed to Java, presumably a Malay
or an Arab seaman. They noticed that he carried "the compass with
the magnet after our manner, and had a chart which was all marked
with lines perpendicular and across," an interesting illustration
of the scientific methods used in Oriental navigation. They asked
him how he steered, now that we had lost the North Star. "Is there
any other North Star than this by which we steer?" In answer the
captain "showed us four or five stars, among which was one which he
said was opposite to our North Star. He also told us that, on the
other side of the said island towards the South, there are some
other races who navigate by the said four or five stars opposite to
ours; and moreover he gave us to understand that, beyond the said
island (Java), the day does not last more than four hours, and that
it was colder than in any other part of the world."</p>
<p>Now it has been pointed out that a day of four hours means a
latitude fifteen degrees further South than Tasmania! And it seems
incredible that the Javanese, and "other races" known to the
Javanese, should have sailed so far South as this, at least in the
longitude of Java. Was the captain thinking of Malay voyages to the
North coast of Australia, and immensely exaggerating the distance?
Or was he thinking of Malay or Arab voyages to far-away Madagascar
and Zanzibar? Or was he simply spinning a yarn for the amusement of
his inquisitive passengers? Anyway Varthema took his statement in
great seriousness, and Varthema in his turn was taken in great
seriousness by the geographers. His story seemed to confirm what
had been previously gathered from Marco Polo about the existence of
a great continent in the far South. When the sixteenth-century
map-maker drew in bold hard outline the coast of this great
Southern Continent, he wrote across it the words&mdash;"that
immense lands exist here is consistent with what is said by Paulus
Venctus and Ludovicus Varthema."</p>
<p>We are now a little able to understand the tangled geographical
nightmare of the maps of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
Pity the unhappy map-maker of these centuries! Firstly, he had to
put into some sort of geographic order the scraps of information
imbedded in the romantic narratives which the travellers had
dictated to friends far more interested in marvels than in science.
Thus Fra Mauro, who made the first famous map of the new age, did
his best to make out the meaning of what Nicolas de Conti had said
to Poggio Bracciolini; and the result was that he confused the
Indus with the Ganges, and the Ganges with the Kiang.<sup>*</sup>
Then, when the unhappy map-maker thought that he had sifted truth
from the travellers' tales, he had to reconcile this truth with the
teaching of Ptolemy. For by that time the Renaissance had brought
Ptolemy to birth once more,<sup>**</sup> and scholars were eager to
interpret the new discoveries in the form of scientific maps. They
endeavoured to solve the problem by bringing out new editions of
Ptolemy. The sixteenth-century map was the map of Ptolemy somewhat
timidly brought up to date by the cautious insertion of guesses at
truth founded on the talk of the travellers.</p>

<p>We find a curious example of honest effort made to achieve the
impossible in a map of the year 1489.<sup>*</sup> In 1487 the
Portuguese captain Bartholomew Diaz had rounded the Cape, and it
had become certain that Ptolemy had made a mistake in describing
the Indian Ocean as a landlocked ocean. The map-maker has therefore
smashed a way through the too solid block of Terra Incognita,
which, according to Ptolemy, unites Asia and Africa in the South,
and has thus made ocean way from the Cape to India. But the Eastern
side of Ptolemy's Indian Ocean remains substantially unchanged. We
still have India and Taprobane in very much the misshapen condition
in which Ptolemy had left them; though the map-maker, having read
Marco Polo, is able to add Socotra, and the islands of Men and
Women. We still have the huge southerly prolongation of Eastern
Asia. We still have Ptolemy's town of Cattigara marked on its
coast. But further on to the South and to the West are the Indian
lands which de Conti had described as "situated in the second gulf
beyond the Indus."</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-12">Illustration 12</a>.]</p>
<p>Here we find St. Thomas, which should have been near Madras on
the East Coast of India! And, still further on, in a position which
suggests to Mr. Collingridge some knowledge of the coast of Western
Australia, is de Conti's Ceylon, in spite of the fact that the real
Ceylon, under the name of Taprobane, is still in the same place and
in the same misshapen condition in which Ptolemy had left it
thirteen hundred years ago! It is surely clear that the map-maker
had no knowledge whatever of the Australian coast. He is simply
trying desperately to make some sort of compromise or
reconciliation between the well-nigh infallible map of the
classical geographer and the extraordinarily misunderstood
statements of the recent travellers in India.</p>

<p>The other maps of the end of the fifteenth century and the
beginning of the sixteenth give further examples of the same effort
to reconcile ancient cosmography with modern narratives of travel.
Thus Martin Behaim in 1492 made a famous globe,<sup>*</sup> which
bears the inscription that "the whole was borrowed with great care
from the works of Ptolemy, Pliny, Strabo, and Marco Polo"! As in
the map of 1489, Ptolemy's southern Terra Incognita is shattered to
pieces.</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-11">Illustration 11</a>.]</p>
<p>But more than half of the space which it had occupied in
Ptolemy's map is occupied in Behaim's globe by Marco Polo's islands
of Madagascar and Zanzibar, islands which stretch their huge length
from West to East, reaching towards the shattered end of Ptolemy's
great South-East extension of Asia. This great South-East extension
is marked by names learned from Marco Polo or de Conti, or other
recent travellers in the East. Here, for example, is India Patalis,
the India of the town which Alexander the Great had founded at the
mouth of the Indus! By its side is Moabar, a province on the East
coast of India. Further South in about 25&deg; S. Lat. is St. Thomas,
the famous town near Madras. Still further to the South-East is
Ceylon, a huge island stretching as far South as about 38&deg; S. Lat.,
a latitude further South than Sydney! Marco Polo's islands of
Pentam and Neucuram, which in real geography existed respectively
near the Straits of Malacca and in the middle of the Bay of Bengal,
are placed near together in a position which roughly corresponds to
the position actually occupied by the Eastern coast of Australia. A
place is found for Marco Polo's Java Minor, really Sumatra,
somewhere in the region of Tasmania: while Anguana, the home of the
dog-faced men in the Bay of Bengal, is placed in a position which
to Mr. Collingridge suggests New Zealand! Again, it is perfectly
clear that the map-maker had no knowledge whatever of lands South
of the equator. He is trying to bring Ptolemy up to date by finding
places in his map for lands described by recent travellers. And, as
we have seen, those travellers had told their story in such
disorderly sequence that the geographical relations of the places
described had been misunderstood in a most extraordinary way.</p>
<p>Varthema's meeting with the Portuguese in India is a reminder
that we have reached the end of a chapter of our story, and are
about to open another chapter of very different characteristics.
Before passing on, let us try to sum up the main results of the
speculations and travels of the period we leave. What was the
condition of knowledge and surmise as to the contents of the
Australasian regions at the coming of the Portuguese and
Spaniards?</p>

<b>13. FRA MAURO'S MAP, 1459<br>
(From an engraving in Dr. sophus Ruge's <i>Geschichte des
Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>.)</b></p>
<p>We have noticed that the cosmographical science of the ancient
world lived through the Dark Ages, and was understood by the
scholars of the thirteenth century. Men like Albert the Great and
Roger Bacon knew perfectly well that the world was a sphere, that,
as an orderly cosmos, it had climatic zones, that there was a
temperate zone to the South like that of the North, that it was at
least possible that in this region existed inhabited lands. The
theological hatred of the Antipodes was in process of being
mitigated by the evidence gradually accumulating that the Tropic
seas were not impassable, and that therefore the men of the South
might well be children of Adam. By the fourteenth century definite
knowledge had been gained of lands in the South of which ancient
cosmographers only knew dimly, or knew not at all&mdash;of India,
Ceylon, Sumatra, the Spice Islands and Java, Zanzibar, Sofala,
Madagascar. The South Tropic Ocean had been sailed through and
through. Varthema had found the climate of Java too <i>cold</i>,
and had hurried back to India to get warm again! Evidently
exploration in this direction need not be hindered by fear of seas
"cremated by the near sun." And traveller after traveller had laid
stress on the importance of the island of Java; on its immense
size, three thousand to seven thousand miles in circuit, said
reports&mdash;and on its magnificent riches, its gold-roofed
palaces, its abundant spices. Beyond Java, mystery reigned. There
were tales of the Dead Sea, and its terrific southerly current, of
stormy atmosphere which prevented further navigation. But who could
say how far southward Java itself extended? Was it not at least
conceivable that this "largest island in the world" was in reality
part of the great continent of the South, the fourth part of the
world? Marco Polo at all events had told of great and rich
continents far away to the South of Java. And now came Varthema
with what seemed trustworthy reports of voyages to the furthest
South, where men steered by the Southern Cross, and where it was
colder than in any other part of the world? Was it not becoming
clear that, away to the South of Java, was a huge continent,
whether continuous with known Java, or separated from it by sea, a
continent rich in spices and in gold? Such, we may imagine, were
the ideas in the minds of the Portuguese as they listened to the
Italian.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>And now we come to a new chapter in our story; a chapter in
which our heroes will no longer be Italian merchants and
missionaries, but Portuguese and Spanish Seamen. Let us first
notice how the great change came about.</p>
<p>Ever since the middle thirteenth century the interest of East to
West had been increasing. The East was the source of all the
luxuries of life. In the East also was the great mission field of
the Knights of Christ. And, both to merchant and to missionary,
access to the East had been through the open door. Mongol
indifferentists dominated Eastern, Northern and Central Asia, and
listened to Christians as willingly as they listened to Mahomedans
and to Buddhists. Western Asia, and especially the seaports of the
East Mediterranean coast, were in the hands of Arabian powers of an
old and advanced civilization, willing to make terms with the
Italian merchant cities for the distribution of Eastern luxuries
through the world of the West. But now great changes took place. In
1368-1370 a national Chinese movement overthrew the Mongol dynasty,
established the doctrine of a Yellow China, and drove forth
"strangers of irregulated morals" with their "profane and foreign
novelties."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Beazley, vol. i. p. 186.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Ottoman Turks, a fierce race of primitive savages,
hating Christianity and despising commerce, had started, about the
year 1300, from the heart of Asia on the career of conquest that
was step by step to make them masters of Western Asia, including
the seaport towns of the Mediterranean. Venetians and Genoese were
driven from the Black Sea and from Constantinople, driven from the
seaports of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt, and, in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, were fighting back-to-wall a desperate
defensive warfare, which threatened to end in the destruction of
their trade in the Mediterranean itself. Europe could only
acquiesce. The age of effective crusade had passed. The Pope could
no longer stir religious enthusiasm to accomplish God's will. The
emperor had no authority outside Germany, and very little authority
inside Germany. The rivalry of national dynasties had destroyed all
possibility of a Concert of Europe. Neither the religious motive
nor the commercial motive sufficed to unite Christendom in an
effective resistance to the Turks. It was not till 1572 that the
battle of Lepanto inflicted serious defeat on the Turkish navy, and
removed the fear that the Mediterranean was destined to become a
Turkish lake.</p>
<p>And yet the Western world was far from being willing to
acquiesce in exclusion from the East. In all lands of Europe
commerce was becoming more enterprising and more profitable, wealth
was accumulating, the demand for luxuries was becoming more
insistent. Moreover, while the Empire decayed, <i>nations</i> were
coming into being in the West, nations united, organic, patriotic,
whose Kings wielded a strength far greater than had belonged to
Kings and even to Emperors of the Feudal Age. And, moreover, these
new nations were animated by a new spirit, the spirit of the New
Birth, which now moved over the face of the world, awakening the
energies of soul and of mind and of body to a new life. To men of
the time it appeared that all things were made new. There was a new
unwillingness to acquiesce in authority, in tradition, in custom.
The mind became active, inquisitive, critical, distrustful of the
accepted opinion, eager to investigate things anew, and to build up
a science which should have foundations well and truly laid in
experience. "To have seen with my own eyes," said a scholar, "I
believe to be the eighth science." There was a new passionate
pursuit of things desired, of knowledge, of wealth, of honour and
glory in the sight of God and man; a new and effectual ambition to
face the unknown with determination to know, to understand, and to
possess. Maritime enterprise was an essential expression and method
of the new spirit; and the thought came into men's minds that it
was possible to make use of the new national strength and of the
new science to cleave a path by Ocean sea to the end of the earth,
and thus renew in splendid ways missions and commerce to East and
South.</p>
<p>The Hero of the New Age was Prince Henry "the Navigator" of
Portugal, the third Son of John "the Great," who, in the late
fourteenth century, had made Portugal a nation, united, patriotic,
commercial, crusading. The long crusade of Portugal against the
Moors of the peninsula had come to an end. But the Crusading spirit
lived in the chivalry of Portugal, strong, sincere, fierce as ever,
combining with the new spirit of the Renaissance to drive forth the
Knight to seek venture in service of Christ. Prince Henry had his
part in the Middle Ages. He won his sword of knighthood by the long
fierce fight which won Ceuta from the African Moors, "that most
glorious conquest, of which famous victory the heavens felt the
glory and the earth the benefit."</p>
<p>He was "Ruler and Governor of the Chivalry of the Order of
Christ," bound by monastic vows; and the flesh of the Virgin
Knight, a year after death, saw no corruption. The motive of the
voyages which he sent forth was "his great desire for the spread of
the Christian Faith, and for the redemption of the vast tribes of
men living under the wrath of God." He sought for "some Christian
Prince to the South, who, for the love of Christ, would help him to
fight the Moors." But there was another aspect to his character,
and to his story. He was the mediaeval crusader and knight, but he
was also the hero of the new age, the man who far excelled all his
contemporaries, among men of action, by his understanding of the
new opportunities, and by his effective endeavour to grasp them.
His fame is the fame of the "Navigator." Astrologers told that "his
ascendant" was in "the House of Mars," and in the "House of
Saturn," and it was therefore clear my lord should be "a great
conqueror, and a searcher out of things hidden from other men."
Henry is the man who first showed how the resources of the new-made
nations of Western Europe might be used, at once to develop the new
science of navigation and cosmography, and to organize expeditions
which should use this science to conquer the new world which lay
beyond the ocean.</p>
<p>In the great work to which Henry set his hand there were two
parts: the scientific, the practical. It is characteristic of the
time and of the man that Henry deliberately chose for himself the
scientific part, as being the more radical. "Brawny and large of
frame, strong of limbs as any, brave in heart and keen in mind,
having a passion for the doing of great things," the hero of Ceuta
chose the life not of the man of action, but of the assiduous
student. His chosen motto was "Talent de bien faire," desire or
determination to do things <i>well</i>, to be <i>thorough</i> or
<i>radical</i> in method. The key to the new world was the new
science; and Henry now withdrew from court and army, and, living at
Sagres, "the place where both seas meet, the great Ocean sea, and
the Mediterranean," formed the first school of practical science in
modern Europe.</p>
<p>Hither came all the learned of the day; Arabs, Jews and
Italians; mathematicians, map-makers, shipbuilders and practical
seamen; and thus in organised scientific ways, backed by the
resources of the Portuguese monarchy, Henry undertook the conquest
of the Ocean sea, and the discovery of a way to India. Here worked
Henry day and night; "often the sun found him in the same place
where it left him the day before, he having watched throughout the
whole arc of night without any rest." He never went on a voyage.
Yet this "Navigator," who stuck to his desk, and never went to sea,
inspired men with enthusiasm and courage, helped them by his
science, and "by his unconquerable industry conquered the
impossibilities of other men." The "oared galley or weak sailing
craft of an inland sea "grew into" the oceangoing ship." "The
caravels of Portugal," said the Venetian Cadamosto, who sailed in
one of them in Henry's service, "are the best sailing ships
afloat." The new science of map-making, which had lately grown up
among the Italian seamen in the Mediterranean, was applied to the
ocean coasts of Africa. "The old mappae mundi," said Henry's
sailors, "were not true, for they only depicted things at hazard;
but this which is now placed on charts is matter witnessed by
eyes." The instruments of navigation, such as the compass and the
astrolabe, were made more serviceable by gradual improvements,
memory of which has been eclipsed by later perfection. And, thus
equipped, Henry's captains set forth to serve God and the prince by
cleaving a path to India.</p>
<p>Voyage after voyage they groped their slow way down the African
coast. The Madeiras, the Azores, the Canaries, were rediscovered.
Cape Bojador, hitherto "the Southernmost limit of Christian
knowledge" was passed; and, to the amazement of the voyagers, the
sea beyond&mdash;pictured by Arabian geographers as boiling with
fiery heat, peopled by fearsome sea-monsters, and threatened by the
visible hand of Satan&mdash;was found safe and easy sailing. They
outflanked the African Moors, came to the land of the negroes, and
began prosperous trade in slaves, ivory and gold dust.</p>
<p>They reached the River Senegal, which "men say comes from the
Nile, being one of the four most glorious Rivers of Earth, flowing
from the Garden of Eden and the earthly paradise." They took back
from it a pipe of water to Lisbon, and boasted that "not even
Alexander, though he was one of the monarchs of the world, ever
drank of water that had been brought from so far as this." Still
they passed on, carving on the trees of desert islands "the arms of
the Infante and the words of his motto," dreaming, as the African
coast took its easterly bend, that they had already rounded the
continent, and that India was no great distance away.</p>
<p>Henry died in 1460. The result of forty-two years of
enthusiastic work looks slight enough when put in terms of modern
geography. His captains had sailed from Cape Bojador to Sierra
Leone, eighteen degrees of latitude, "not four days' course in a
steam ship."<sup>*</sup> But he had done enough to touch Portuguese
imagination, to stir Portuguese ambition, to make sure that the
work which had made Portugal the most famous nation of the new age
would be continued. There was disappointment and discontent when
the African coast again turned South. After all, had Ptolemy been
right when he thought there was no way round Africa at all? But the
Portuguese monarchs persisted; and the Portuguese seamen sailed on.
In 1486 Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape. On Christmas Day 1497,
Vasco da Gama came to the land to which, by reason of the day, he
gave the name of Natal, He reached the Arabian colonies on the East
coast of Africa, and, obtaining pilots, came to Calicut on the
Western coast of India in May 1498. "We come," said a Portuguese
sailor, "in search of Christians and spices."</p>
<p class="note">[* Hunter's <i>History of British India</i>, vol.
i. p. 69.]</p>
<p>Now follows the story of the foundation of the Portuguese Empire
of the East. It was essentially a maritime empire. The Arab
supremacy, which had made the whole Indian Ocean the Domain of
Islam, was challenged and was completely overthrown. "History,
ancient and modern, records no achievement of armed commerce so
brilliant, and so fraught with lasting result."<sup>*</sup> The
Arab towns on the East African coast were stormed, and Portuguese
forts were founded. The weak Hindoo princes of the Western coast of
India were forced to accept Portuguese factors and Portuguese
garrisons. The great Mahomedan Armada, in which the strength of
India and Arabia was reinforced by the strength of Egypt, was
utterly overthrown. Goa, the headquarters of the Mahomedan League,
was captured, and became the splendid capital of the Portuguese
Empire in the East. One by one, the gates of the Indian Ocean,
Socotra, Ormuz, Malacca, were conquered, or terrified into
submission. Aden alone remained unsubdued. And thus in a few years
the Portuguese won the overlordship of the whole Indian Ocean.
Their sphere of influence extended over an ocean area six thousand
miles by four thousand. Their frontier was "a jagged semicircle of
over fifteen thousand miles." And, over this huge ocean domain, the
tiny nation of Portugal held sway for a century!<sup>**</sup></p>

<b>14. PORTUGUESE DOMINIONS IN THE EAST, 1502-1558.<br>
(Based on Map in Guillemard's Magellan.)</b></p>
<p>Most significant, from our present point of view, was
Albuquerque's conquest of Malacca (1511), the great ocean junction
of all the trade routes, from China, Japan, and the Spice Islands
on the one hand, from India, Persia, Arabia and Egypt, and the
Mediterranean on the other. The conquest of Malacca, Albuquerque
believed, would prove the ruin of Mecca and Cairo, and would give
to Portugal exclusive control of the trade of the furthest East.
From Malacca he sent envoys to Canton, to Siam, to Cochin China, to
Tongking, to Pegu, to Sumatra, and to Java. And an expedition was
immediately equipped for the exploration of the Spice Islands.</p>
<p>This expedition is of great interest in our story. It was no
doubt the direct result of information received by the Portuguese
from our Italian traveller, Ludovico di Varthema. On his return to
India, after his visit to the Spice Islands and Java, he had joined
the Portuguese in Calicut, just in time to witness the great
victory of 1506 over the Arabian fleet, which seemed, he says,
"like some huge forest, from the great masts of the ships. Never
have I seen braver men than these Portuguese." No doubt he told
them of Molucca and its cloves, of Banda and its nutmegs, of the
great and rich island of Java, and of the report of voyages to some
far distant land in the South. The conquest of Malacca, the gate
through which passed the spice trade, was immediately followed by
this expedition in search of the Spice Islands themselves (December
1511). It consisted of three ships. The names of two of the
captains were d'Abreu and Francisco Serrano. According to some
contemporary statements, the name of the third was Ferdinand
Magellan, who had "given a very good account of himself" at the
capture of Malacca. On the whole, these statements seem
untrustworthy;<sup>*</sup> but it is a point of importance in our
story that Francisco Serrano and Ferdinand Magellan had fought side
by side and were very intimate friends.</p>
<p class="note">[* Guillemard, p. 69.]</p>
<p>The story of the voyage is told by Antonio Galvano, a Portuguese
writer of very high character, who went to India in 1527, and was
for six years Governor and Apostle of the Moluccas. In the three
ships, he writes,<sup>*</sup> sailed only one hundred and twenty
men; "not more went to discover New Spain with Columbus, nor India
with Gama; nor, in comparison with these, is Maluco less wealthy,
or ought to be held in less esteem." "They sailed by the noble
island of Java; and they ran their course East, sailing between it
and the Island of Madura...Beyond the Island of Java they sailed
along another called Bali; and then came also unto others called
Anjano, Simbiba, Solor, Galao, Mauluca, Vitara, Rosolanguin, and
Arus, from whence are brought delicate birds which are of great
estimation because of their feathers; they came also to other
islands lying in the same parallel on the South side in 7 or 8
degrees of latitude. And they be so near the one to the other that
they seem at first to be one entire and main land. The course of
these islands is above 500 leagues. The ancient cosmographers call
all these islands the name of Javas; but late experience hath found
their names to be diverse as you see. Beyond these islands, it is
said, there are others which are inhabited with white people, going
arrayed in shirts, doublets, and slops, like unto the Portugals,
having also money of silver. The governors among them do carry in
their hands red staves, whereby they seem to have some affinity
with the people of China." Galvano then tells how "d'Abreu and
those that went with him took their course toward the North," to
Ternate; "the first Portugals that came to the islands of Cloves."
The voyage led to the settlement of the Portuguese in the Moluccas.
Serrano went to live and trade in Ternate; and from Ternate he
wrote to his old friend Magellan, once more in Portugal, "giving
him to understand that he had discovered yet another new world,
larger and richer than that found by Gama." Magellan resolved to
find a way thither by a shorter route.</p>
<p class="note">[* Galvano, p. 115.]</p>
<p>Thus, by the beginning of 1512, Portuguese seamen had sailed
along the <i>Northern</i> coasts of the string of islands from Java
to Arus. They were already very near indeed to the coast of
Australia. But, before we consider the question whether they saw
that coast, we will follow another story.</p>
<p>For, while the Portuguese had been groping their way round
Africa towards the Marco Polo paradise, Columbus had been dreaming
of a short cut. He had diligently read, marked, and digested all
the cosmographical literature available in his time. He had read a
Latin translation of the book of Marco Polo, and his copy, with
marginal notes in his handwriting, still exists.<sup>*</sup> His
imagination had been fired by the thought of a Great Kaan eagerly
expecting the Christian missionary. He thought also of the
gold-roofed palaces of Cipango, and of the incredible richness of
the Spice Islands. Here was wealth sufficient to arm Christendom in
a last great crusade, which should recover the Holy Sepulchre, and
make the whole world the Kingdom of God. In the <i>Imago Mundi</i>,
the geographical compendium of his day, he read extracts from those
authors of ancient and recent times who had shown that the earth
was a sphere, and had drawn the inevitable conclusion that it was
possible to reach India and Cathay by travelling West. The question
remained&mdash;how great was the distance to be traversed by him
who, sailing from the Canaries, sought to touch Cipango? Columbus
consulted the ancient writers, the Scriptures, Arabian and Italian
cosmographers, and, putting facts and arguments together, he
reached the conclusion that the distance from the Canaries to
Cipango was but two thousand five hundred miles!<sup>**</sup> That
is to say, he imagined the Eastern coast of Asia to be where the
Eastern coast of America actually is. He hoped to reach the Marco
Polo Paradise by a route as much shorter than the Portuguese route
as a direct voyage to the West Indies is shorter than a voyage to
the Spice Islands by way of the Cape and India.</p>
<p class="note">[* Fiske, vol. i. p. 372.]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Ibid</i>.]</p>
<p>Columbus brought his proposal to Spain in good time. Ferdinand
and Isabella had united the Christian Kingdoms of the peninsula in
a Spanish nation, virile, fierce, passionately devoted to the Faith
of the Knight and the Crusader. They fought the last great fight
against the Moors. In 1492 they conquered the Moorish capital at
Granada. Columbus was present at the surrender with exulting heart.
The triumph of the Cross at Granada was to be but the beginning of
a story of knightly venture, which Should make the Cross triumphant
throughout the whole world. It was the year&mdash;so he wrote in
the journal of the most famous voyage in history&mdash;in which he
"saw the royal banners of your Highness placed on the towers of the
Alhambra," and "the Moorish King came forth from the gates of the
city to kiss the hands of your Highness," that he received
commission to search out the "Prince who is called the Gran Can,"
and to convert him and the princes and cities of India to the
Christian Faith. He confidently hoped to return, loaded with the
riches of the East, to complete the victory of Christ in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Thus, in the year of the conquest of Granada, Columbus sailed
forth West two thousand five hundred miles, and something more. And
he found the island which we call Hayti, and believed that he had
found either Cipango or Ophir. And he found a long coast, the
Southern coast of Cuba, and believed that he had found the coast of
Cathay. And the natives told him that they were visited by the
ships of the Gran Can. And he heard the expected stories of men
with one eye, and of men with dogs' noses who were cannibals and
drank the blood of their enemies, and he knew that he was in the
world of Marco Polo. And in another voyage, Southward, as he
believed, of Cathay, he came to the mouth of a huge river, the
river Orinoco, which seemed to him to prove the existence of a huge
continent to the South of Asia, like that which Mela and Ptolemy
had drawn, and Marco Polo and Ludovico Varthema had told of; a
continent which he (like Dante) believed culminated in a mountain
on the height of which was the Terrestrial Paradise, the source of
the great river whose tumultuous outlet he had discovered. And in
his last voyage he made search for the Straits of Malacca, which
Should be somewhere between Cathay (Cuba) and the Great Land of the
South (South America); and he understood the natives of the Isthmus
of Panama to say that the strait was in fact close by, and that, as
he expected, it was thence but an easy ten days' Sail to the mouth
of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Most interesting to us was the discovery, of the great land to
the South, the land which we call South America. The interpretation
of the other discoveries seemed comparatively easy. Columbus was
confident that he had discovered the lands made familiar by Marco
Polo and his successors&mdash;Cipango, Cathay, India, Malacca, and
the seven thousand seven hundred and forty islands! But what was
this great land to the South? Was it Ptolemy's Cattigara-land, the
hitherto unknown East coast of the huge southerly extension of
Eastern Asia? Or was it Marco Polo's Locac, the great continent far
South of Java, rich in gold, in spices, in elephants? Or was it the
mysterious continent of the South, imagined by ancient
cosmographers, and by medieval scholars, the continent which Dante
had described, existing under the Southern Cross, and culminating
in the heights of the Terrestrial Paradise? Most likely <i>all</i>
these guesses were right. No wonder there was excitement in the
hearts of voyagers. They were to know all that Ptolemy had known,
and more! And any journey might end in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>Gradually the successors of Columbus groped their way southward
down the unknown coast, and in 1502 Amerigo Vespucci, Florentine
"Pilot" on a Portuguese ship, traced it through the tropics to Lat.
35&deg; S. He had proved the existence of a huge continent of the
South, hitherto unvisited either by the ancients or by recent
travellers&mdash;"a land which thy charts do not indicate, O
Ptolemy!" boasted a poetical admirer of Amerigo. "It is proper,"
wrote Amerigo himself to a friend, "to call these lands <i>a new
world</i>. Since among our ancestors there was no knowledge of
them, and to all who hear of the affair it is most novel. For it
transcends the ideas of the ancients, since most of them (i.e. the
medieval scholars) say that beyond the equator to the South there
is no continent, but only the sea which they call Atlantic, and if
any of them asserted the existence of a continent there they found
reason for refusing to consider it a habitable country. But this
last voyage of mine has proved that this opinion of theirs was
erroneous, and in every way contrary to the facts, since in those
southern regions I have found a continent more thickly inhabited by
peoples and animals than our Europe or Asia or Africa, and moreover
a climate more temperate and agreeable than in any other region
known to us."</p>
<p>Let us understand the situation. What Amerigo had done was to
sail down a considerable part of the East coast of the continent we
call South America. What he <i>thought</i> he had done was to
discover a great continent standing in relation to Asia somewhat
as, in fact, Australia actually stands to Asia. He believed also
that this "Antarctic" continent was the "fourth part of the world
"of which mediaeval cosmographers, copying the ancients, had
written. Christian Fathers, like Isidore, while allowing that it
was likely that this continent existed, had declared the statement
that it was inhabited by "Antipodes" to be "a fable." Amerigo had
actually discovered the continent, the very existence of which had
been a matter of conjecture and dispute. "Henceforth," remarked a
writer (Peter Martyr), "you will know the Antipodes as you know
your own house!" Amerigo was able to show you that it was a rich
country, thickly populated "by myriads of Antipodes," in condition
so healthy that some of them lived to be one hundred and fifty
years old! He agreed with Dante and with Columbus, that, if the
terrestrial paradise is anywhere to be found on the earth, it
cannot be far from this region.</p>
<p>Cipango, then, and Cathay had been discovered; or, at all
events, they could not be far away. And to the South of them had
been discovered this huge New Antarctic World. There still remained
the problem, how to get to India by this western route. The place
to look for was the Straits of Malacca. Columbus thought he had
found it in what we call the Isthmus of Panama; but that turned out
to be a mistake; though still in the 1520's Cortes believed that a
strait would there be found, and in 1520 the map-maker Sch&ouml;ner
actually marked this strait in his map, with Japan a few miles away
from the western side. Vespucci's idea was to look for the Straits
of Malacca to the South of his "Mundus Novus." <i>His</i> search
also failed. But in 1513 Balboa saw from a peak in Darien a sea of
unknown extent, the "Sea of the South." And in 1519 Magellan, the
little man of steel, Portuguese commander of a Spanish fleet, drove
through the strait that bears his name, plunged into "a sea so vast
that the human mind can scarcely grasp it," and, after the most
prodigious voyage recorded in history, broken only by a few
"unfortunate islands," he reached at length the "new world larger
and richer than that found by Gama," of which his friend Serrano
had written! The existence of the huge Southern Pacific was
revealed, and map-makers gradually came to understand that Hayti
was not Japan, and that Cuba was not Cathay.</p>
<p>Magellan arrived, not at the Moluccas, but at the Philippines,
where, like a good Portugal, he lost his life in mad crusade
against the heathen. But the Spaniards sailed on, under Sebastian
del Cano, and touching at Borneo, Batuan and Gilolo, they at length
reached the Moluccas. Serrano was dead; but the Portuguese were in
possession of the "New World" he had discovered, doing a big trade
in Banda for mace and nutmeg, and in the Moluccas for cloves. They
had been so anxious "to keep these countries from, and unknown to
the Spaniards," says the very fascinating journalist, Pigafetta,
"that they had spread reports that the seas about the Moluccas
could not be navigated on account of the shoals and the foggy
atmosphere, and that fresh water had to be imported from distant
countries." The Spaniards, however, "bought cloves like mad," and
then in the <i>Victoria</i> they sailed for home.<sup>*</sup>
"Sailing as far as possible from the coast of India, lest they
should be seen by the Portuguese," they sought a passage through
the tangle of the island barrier which stretched from Sumatra to
Timor, trying to find the way by use of the map of Ptolemy; they
made for Cattigara, they say, but couldn't find it! They touched at
Ombaya and Timor, and our journalist writes a full account of the
latter island, so near to Australia, and especially of its great
trade with Malacca and Java and the Philippines in wax and
sandalwood, "for white sandal-wood only grows in this country."</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-15">Illustration 15</a>.]</p>
<p>He then tells how the Victoria sailed from Timor to the Cape, on
a track that must have been fairly near to the North-West coast of
Australia. But he has no word to say of land seen between Timor and
the Cape. Galvano, however, ex-governor of the Moluccas, writing
about 1555, has the following curious passage: "Beyond this
island&mdash;one hundred leagues&mdash;they discovered certain
islands&mdash;under the Tropic of Capricorn and further on others.
All are peopled thenceforward; nor did they see land except it
might be some islets up to the Cape of Good Hope."</p>

<b>15. MAP TO ILLUSTRATE VOYAGE OF THE <i>Victoria</i> FROM THE
PHILIPPINES.</b></p>
<p>Now, if the Spaniards saw "certain islands under the Tropic of
Capricorn," these islands must have been near the Australian coast.
But we are left puzzled by this confused statement of later date
compared with the silence of the eager note-taker on board. And so
the <i>Victoria</i> rounded the Cape, and sailed home to Spain, the
first of all ships to put a girdle round the world&mdash;in three
and a half years!</p>
<p>Thus both Portuguese and Spaniards had made a way to the "New
World" which centred in the Spice Islands. There was fierce strife
between them; for, though the Pope, dividing the world "like an
orange," had drawn his line North to South down the Atlantic, none
could yet say with scientific certainty how this line would run
when produced to the other side of the globe. Eventually Charles of
Spain sold to the Portuguese his claim to the Spice Islands; all
the more readily, no doubt, because the solid Portuguese
settlements in India and Malacca gave them a hold on these islands
that could hardly be loosened by occasional Spanish ships, sailing
from Spain through the Straits of Magellan, or from some part of
Mexico or Peru. So the Portuguese permanently enclosed the Moluccas
within their maritime empire, which dominated the whole Indian
Ocean. And Galvano, that "goodly example of a true and faithful
Portugal" (as his friend and editor called him) waged war against a
combination of "all the Kings and Governors of all the islands
about," who "had agreed to make war against the Portugals until
such time as they might drive them all out of the country; he
fought against them all with only one hundred and thirty Portugals
and he gave them the overthrow!" From the Moluccas they sought to
enforce their claim to monopoly of trade throughout the whole Far
Eastern Seas, the trade with Malacca and with India, with the
thousand Islands, with China, and with Japan; for in 1542 they
discovered Japan by accident. "It seemeth," writes Galvano, "to be
the island of Zipango whereof Paulus Venetus (Marco Polo) maketh
mention."</p>
<p>But, though the Spaniards had sold their claim to the Moluccas,
they did not abandon ambition to found a great Empire in the East.
This was one of the huge schemes which occupied the mind of Cortes,
conqueror of Mexico, eager to discover and subdue new worlds, and
with imation set on fire by the story of Magellan. "The
information," he writes from Mexico to the Spanish King (May 1523),
"gave me much pleasure, for it appeared to me that the discovery
would prove a great and signal service to Your Majesty, especially
as all who possess any knowledge or experience in navigation to the
Indies have considered it certain that the discovery of the South
Sea in those parts would bring to light many islands rich in gold,
pearls, precious stones and spices, together with many other
unknown and choice productions; and the same has been affirmed by
persons versed in learning and skilled in cosmography."</p>
<p>He made ports on the Pacific coast of Mexico, built ships, and
sent them to explore, to conquer and to settle. "It will be the
greatest achievement," he wrote, "and the one that will redound
more to the service of Your Majesty than anything since the
discovery of the Indies." "To these ships I attach an importance I
cannot express; for I consider it certain that by means of them
Your Majesty will become lord of more realms and states than there
exists any knowledge of, and I believe nothing will be wanting to
make Your Majesty monarch of the world."</p>
<p>In 1527 Saavedra sailed West from Mexico; Saavedra, the man
after Cortes's own heart, who had planned a Panama Canal, so that
the Spaniards might sail on a straight line from the Canaries to
the Moluccas. He was commissioned to succour a Spanish expedition,
which two years before had sailed through the Straits of Magellan
under Loaysa and Del Cano, the circumnavigator, to assert Spain's
claims in the Far East. They had been destroyed by storms, and by
disease, and by the horrible longness of the voyage across the
Pacific. The leaders Loaysa and Del Cano had died, and forty
others, and the survivors, "one hundred and five of us," had
reached the Moluccas at last, to find the Portuguese in possession.
Saavedra arrived and helped in the fight, but with no good effect;
and, in the end, news came that the Moluccas had been sold by our
King to Portugal, "and we, the miserable seventeen survivors, had
to ask the Governor of Portuguese India to ship us home, which
eventually he did, stealing however our charts!"</p>
<p>But meanwhile, Saavedra, finding nothing good to be done in the
Moluccas, had sailed for Mexico (1528). He came to the coast of a
great land, two hundred leagues East of the Moluccas, which two
years before had been sighted by a Portuguese seaman named Meneses;
"a large island," says the writer of our narrative, "well peopled
by a black race with woolly hair, who go naked." Saavedra coasted
the land for about a month, discovering about fifty leagues beyond
what had been seen by Meneses. He called the land "Del
Oro"&mdash;one more Land of Gold! But contrary winds drove him back
to the Moluccas. The Spaniards in the Moluccas advised him to sail
by way of the Cape of Good Hope, for, sailing due East towards
Mexico, he was certain to meet contrary winds. But the obstinate
hero persisted, and sailed once more eastward in May 1529.</p>
<p>In December his ship returned to the Moluccas with news that the
voyage had again failed, and that Saavedra had "died by the way."
His men told that he "had sight of a land towards the South in 2&deg;,
and he ran East along by it above five hundred leagues. The coast
was clean and of good anchorage, but the people black, and of
curled hair...The people of Maluco call them Papuas, because they
be black and friseled in their hair, and so also do the Portugals
call them." Then, "having sailed 4&deg; or 5&deg; to the South of the line,
he returned unto it, and passed the equinoctial towards the North."
He came to islands the people of which seemed to be "of China," and
then made sail for Panama. "For," explains Galvano, "from Maluco
unto Panama they sail continually between the Tropics and the line;
but they never found wind to serve that course, and therefore they
came back again to Maluco very sad, because Saavedra had died by
the way."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Galvano, pp. 176-180.]</p>
<p>The Spaniards were cast down, but not dismayed. The New World of
the Spice Islands grew more and more attractive. "In no part of the
discovered world," writes Urdaneta, a famous Spanish seaman, "are
there spices, but only in these islands." The discovery of the land
of the "Papuas, all black with woolly hair like those of Guinea,"
was promise of great things. "No doubt," Urdaneta declared, "many
other islands remain to be discovered and subjugated." So Cortes
sent forth expedition after expedition Westward from Mexico. Again
the land of the Papuas was visited, "a land of black people with
frizzled hair, who are cannibals, and the devil walks with them."
But the Portuguese held fiercely to their monopoly in the Moluccas,
and the Spaniards determined to make the centre of their Eastern
Empire in the group of islands to the North which Magellan had
discovered, and in which he had died. In 1545 they founded a colony
here, but Portuguese jealousy pursued them, and the plan failed.
Once more the attempt was made to return to Mexico by "the coast of
Os Papua." "They ranged all along the same, and, because they knew
not that Saavedra had been there before, they challenged the honour
and fame of that discovery, and because the people there were black
and had friseled hair they named it Nueva Guinea, for the memory of
Saavedra there was almost lost."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Galvano, p. 239.]</p>
<p>Then in 1564 an expedition was sent from Mexico under Legaspi,
which succeeded in founding a flourishing colony in the islands,
which were now named the Philippines in honour of the Spanish King.
Manila was founded. The natives were "conquered by arms or by the
industry of the monks who sowed the Holy Gospel, in which all
laboured valiantly." The famous monk-seaman Urdaneta solved the
problem, which had hitherto baffled seamen, of the return voyage to
Mexico, and a regular service of ships was established between
Manila and Acapulco. It was found possible, by sailing in June, to
reach Acapulco in a voyage of five or six months: a long and
tedious journey, seeing that the outward voyage to Manila could be
done in less than three months. But Spanish colonists must get back
to Spain. The Portuguese jealously barred the Cape route. It was
necessary to sail back Eastward, and "without any better or more
speedy way having been discovered by the South Sea, though it has
been attempted." So wrote De Morga, ex-lieutenant-governor of the
Philippines in 1609.</p>
<p>The Spanish rule in the Philippines is described by De Morga in
enthusiastic detail.<sup>*</sup> He had spent there "eight years
(1595-1603) and the best years of my life." He tells&mdash;and his
testimony is accepted by the modern scholar<sup>**</sup>&mdash;of
the good government of the Spaniards, their humane and
disinterested treatment of the natives, of the excellent service
rendered to the Faith by the Inquisition, which finds "no want of
constant work on account of the entrance of so many foreigners in
those parts," of the prosperous trade of Spanish
merchants&mdash;for most of the Spanish settlers were
merchants&mdash;with Borneo and the other islands, with Cambodia,
with China and Japan, and of the heroic though unsuccessful
endeavours of Franciscan missionaries to win the peoples of those
lands to the Christian Faith.</p>
<p class="note">[* <i>The Philippine Islands</i>, by Antonio de
Morga (Hakluyt Society).]</p>
<p class="note">[** See <i>The Philippine Islands from 1493 to
1898,</i> ed. Blair and Robertson.]</p>
<p>He prints a letter written to him by a Franciscan "from the road
of execution," for the Friars, with their converts, were crucified.
The King of Spain draws no revenue from the Philippines. All he
gets from the colony is spent in the service of the colony. He
undertakes the work for the sake of Christianity, and "in the hope
of <i>better results in other kingdoms of Asia, when God so
pleases</i>." And the spirit of the valiant Spanish
soldier-governor catches fire as he tells once more the great story
of his countrymen; how, having "by the mercy of God preserved their
realms in the purity of the Christian Religion, deserving the title
of Defenders of the Faith, by the valour of their indomitable
hearts they have furrowed the seas, and discovered and conquered
vast kingdoms in the most remote and unknown parts of the world,
leading the inhabitants to knowledge of the true God, and to the
fold of the Christian Church, in which they now live, governed in
civil and political matters with peace and justice, under the
shelter and protection of the royal arm...From this cause the crown
or sceptre of Spain has come to extend itself over all that the sun
looks on from its rising to its setting with the glory and
splendour of its power and majesty; but surpassing any of the other
princes of the earth by having gained innumerable souls for heaven,
which has been the <i>Spaniard's principal intention and
wealth</i>...Having won America, one quarter of the earth, they
sailed following the sun, and discovered in the Western Ocean an
archipelago: raising the standard of the Faith, they snatched them
from the yoke of the Devil, so that justly may they raise in those
isles the pillars and trophies of <i>non plus ultra</i>."</p>
<p>One wonders whether De Morga owed something of his enthusiasm to
conversation with a man of kindred spirit, Fernando de Quiros, who,
after adventurous voyage through mid-Pacific, had come to Manila in
1595, full of a grand scheme that should add to the Spanish Empires
in West and East a Spanish Empire in the South, "so that all round
the world God might be known and adored by all his creatures."</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>We have now followed the story of the coming of Portuguese and
Spaniards to the Indian Ocean. Our next concern is to ask whether
the seamen of those nations acquired any knowledge of
Australia.</p>
<p>In telling the story of the Portuguese and Spanish voyages I
have sought to state all the facts known to me that are at all
likely to throw light on this question. And remarkably little light
they have thrown. Let us recall our main facts.</p>
<p>In 1512 the Portuguese reached the Spice Islands. From that date
Portuguese traders visited them, settled in them in very small
numbers&mdash;a governor thought he was very well off with an army
of a hundred or so&mdash;and made trading voyages along the North
coasts of the string of islands as far Eastward as the island of
Aru and the Northern coast of New Guinea. There is, I think, no
evidence that they sailed along the Southern coast of New Guinea
except the fact that they described it as "a large island," a
phrase that seems to indicate some knowledge of the trend of the
Southern coast. Twice Spanish ships sailed from the Straits of
Magellan, and on several occasions Spanish ships sailed from
Mexico, to the Philippines and the Moluccas and some of these
ships, trying to fight their way back to Mexico, explored long
stretches of the Northern coast of New Guinea, and came away with
exceedingly bad impression of the looks and the morality of the
inhabitants. But neither in Portuguese nor in Spanish writing is
there one word (so far as I know) to suggest knowledge of anything
South of the North coasts of the island chain from Java to Timor;
no word save the passage in Galvano telling of "certain islands
under the Tropic of Capricorn" to which, he says, the
<i>Victoria</i> came a hundred leagues beyond Timor.</p>
<p>And, while there is no word in our chronicles, save these, to
Suggest knowledge of Australia, there are a good many words that
suggest ignorance. Barros, a Portuguese chronicler who wrote about
the middle of the sixteenth century, tells that the natives of Java
say that on the South of Java is an undiscovered sea; and they
think that whoever proceeds beyond the straits between Java and
Bali will be hurried away by strong currents, so as never to be
able to return; and for this reason they never attempt to navigate
it;<sup>*</sup> a statement that reminds one at once of Friar
Odoric's story of "the sea called <i>Mare Mortuum</i> which runneth
continually southward, into which whosoever falleth is never seen
afterwards"; and also of an inscription of Fra Mauro to the effect
that "ships sailing towards the South which allow themselves to
approach the Dim ISlands will be carried by the currents into the
darkness, and once entered into those regions, through the density
of the air or of the tenacious waters they must
perish."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Quoted by Major, p. lv.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Yule's <i>Cathay</i>, vol. ii. p. 160. Cf.
Themara, 1556: "Thirty Leagues from Java the Less is Gatigara,
nineteen degrees the other side of the Equinoctial land towards the
South. Of the lands beyond this point nothing is known, for
navigation has not been extended further, and it is impossible to
proceed by land on account of the numerous lakes and lofty
mountains in these parts. It is even said that there is the seat of
Paradise." Quoted by Major (p. lxv) as representing the best
Spanish opinion at the time.]</p>
<p>Readers of Wallace's account of the Malay Archipelago will find
that these stories contain a certain amount of truth. So violent
and so uncertain, he writes, are the currents that flow through the
straits of Lombok, that "vessels preparing to anchor in the bay are
sometimes suddenly swept away into the straits, and are unable to
get back again for a fortnight." It is easy to believe that both
natives and Portuguese feared to embark upon this ferocious
current.<sup>*</sup> And this may help to explain the strange
ignorance of the South coast of Java, which is a matter of singular
importance in our study. "The South coast," writes Diego do Couto,
another Portuguese chronicler, about 1570, "is not frequented by
us, and its bays and ports are not known; but the North coast is
much frequented and has many good ports."<sup>**</sup> According to
this writer, then, the Portuguese knew that Java was an island, and
had a vague idea of the contour of its Southern coast; but there
their knowledge ended.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. "Java" in Encyclopedia Britannica.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Quoted by Collingridge, p. 194.]</p>
<p><a name="linschoten" id="linschoten"></a>Still more remarkable
is the testimony of Linschoten, the famous Dutch traveller, who
visited the Far East at the end of the sixteenth century, and wrote
the book that first put into Dutch and English minds the idea of an
eastern com-mercial empire. He was a very industrious and careful
inquirer, and got, no doubt, the very best information that could
be got from Portuguese who had spent their lives in those seas. And
this is what he wrote of Java: "This island beginneth under seven
degrees on the South side, and runneth East and by South 150 miles
long (=600 English miles), but, touching the breadth, it is not
found, because as yet it is not discovered, nor by the inhabitants
themselves well known. Some think it to be firm land and parcel of
the country called <i>Terra Incognita</i>, which, being so, should
reach from that place to the Capo de Bona Sperance, but as yet it
is not certainly known, and therefore it is accounted an island";
and he prints a map that makes an island with North coast bravely
carved into capes and bays, and Strewn with the names of towns, but
with the South coast a smooth curve, unbroken by capes and bays and
without a single name.<sup>*</sup> That is to say, if we are to
believe this very intelligent and well-informed Dutch traveller,
the natives of the North coast of Java did not even know whether
their land was an island, or was a tip of the great Southern
Continent (of which we shall soon hear more), reaching to the
neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-16">Illustration 16</a>. Away

i.e. like Mercator and Ortelius he thinks it neeessary to find a

knowledge of Australia.]</p>

<p>If then we were to judge solely by the writings of the
Portuguese, and of those who wrote from Portuguese information, it
would appear certain that, excepting once more the islands to the
South of Timor which Galvano says were seen by the people in the
<i>Victoria</i>, there was no knowledge of anything South of the
North coast of Java.</p>
<p>Nor does it seem to me that there is the least reason to be
surprised by this apparent ignorance. There is nothing whatever
suspicious about it. It is what we should have expected. The number
of Portuguese and Spaniards in the Far East was exceedingly small.
The harvest of spices was great, and the few labourers, with both
hands full of most precious stuff in the world, had no time to
spare for any other business save the entirely necessary business
of fighting the natives and fighting one another. There was little
motive for further exploration, and little possibility of
undertaking it. They had neither ships nor men to spare. Nor was it
in the least likely that the ordinary voyages, either of Portuguese
or Spaniards, would lead to the <i>accidental</i> discovery of
Australia.</p>

<b>17. PART OF SEBASTIAN CABOT'S MAP.<br>
(From Jomard's Collection.)</b></p>
<p>The Portuguese sailed from the Cape to the Moluccas by a track
that hugged the Eastern coast of Africa. It was not till the Dutch
in the early seventeenth century struck Eastward from the Cape on
an entirely new track that the discovery of the Western coast of
Australia became likely. As for the Spaniards, they sailed from
Mexico and aimed straight at the Moluccas or the Philippines, with
winds that were very unlikely to take them to the South of New
Guinea. The route by the Straits of Magellan had appeared so
frightful to the first voyagers by reason of its length and
desolation, that they had doubted that they would ever have
successors; and, in fact, it was abandoned after the second
disastrous voyage of Del Cano in 1524. And from Peru no ships
sailed Westward till Menda&ntilde;a's voyage of 1567, the first voyage, of
which we have knowledge, that <i>might</i> have discovered
Australia, and that actually <i>did</i> discover the Solomon
Islands. It may, I believe, be affirmed with confidence that we
have no news of any voyage in the sixteenth century at all likely
to have led to knowledge of any part of the Australian coast. And
this fact seems to me good reason for entertaining a strong
sceptical prejudice in respect to arguments that seek to prove that
the Australian coast was well known.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* I am especially impressed by the apparent
complete ignorance of Galvano, the ex-Governor of the Moluccas, who
wrote his <i>Discoveries of the World</i> before 1555. If Australia
had been discovered he <i>must</i> have heard of the discovery, and
he gave so much information about the rich islands which he knew

(From an engraving in <i>Recueil de Travaux, etc.</i>, Universit&eacute;

<p>If from contemporary writings we turn to contemporary maps, we
find much to confirm us in our unbelief. Many of these maps seem to
correspond to the narratives with reasonable exactness, setting
down the discoveries and the conjectures of which we have been
told, and setting down little more. Thus we have a series of charts
made by Francisco Rodriguez,<sup>*</sup> one of the pilots of
D'Abreu's famous expedition of 1511-12. They give a fairly correct
rough sketch of the string of islands from Sumatra to Timor,
showing the South coasts as well as the North coasts, and with open
sea to the South. They are, I think, the only charts that draw the
South coasts of the islands in a way that suggests knowledge.
Another chart of about 1517, by Pedro Reinel, gives the same string
of islands, with the curious difference that their length is made
to extend not East and West, but North and South.<sup>**</sup> They
seem to show ignorance of the South coasts, and also to show a
tendency to fill the unknown vacancy with land. The Spanish map of
Ribero (1529) shows an opposite tendency. The North coasts only of
the islands from Java to Timor are given. On the South they have no
outline, but fade into the ocean on which sails Magellan's ship
<i>Victoria</i> on its way home "from Maluco"; and the ocean
extends shoreless to the bottom of the map.<sup>***</sup></p>

<p>The famous map of Sebastian Cabot of 1544<sup>*</sup> has
similar characteristics. It gives the North coast of the islands
from Java to Timor with details that are copious though not always
correct. Java and Sumbava are supposed to be one island. The
impracticable straits are turned into a closed gulf, in the midst
of which are the islands of Bali and Lomboc. But Java-Sumbava has
no South coast. And the sea to the South is one huge unbroken
vacancy, on which, with safety and with truthfulness, Cabot has
written the words, "Unknown Sea <i>or</i> Land."<sup>**</sup></p>

land, but merely sea and certain islands."<sup>*</sup> There are
later Portuguese maps of 1546 and 1558 that give the same
view.<sup>**</sup> Thus we have a large number of maps, both
Portuguese and Spanish, and of highest authority, which assure us
that there was no knowledge of land South of Java.</p>

<p>There is one map of this type that has singular interest for
Englishmen. In 1598-1600 Richard Hakluyt published the second
edition of his collection of voyages, with a new map. Shaksperc
must have turned over its leaves, for its "new map with the
augmentation of the Indies" came into mind when he thought of the
multitudinous "lines" of Malvolio's smile.<sup>*</sup> This
map,<sup>**</sup> like the others we have noticed, makes the South
Pacific one huge vacant ocean, save for one interesting hint or
suggestion. South of Java, in the place where the North-West coast
of Australia existed, appears a short line in the shape of a
rough-drawn S, without any sort of legend. What does it stand for?
Its very modesty suggests that it is no mere fancy, but stands for
some definite piece of news that had come to the map-makers. I
would venture to suggest that it may stand for the "certain islands
under the Tropic of Capricorn" which, according to Galvano, were
seen from the <i>Victoria</i> one hundred leagues beyond Timor.</p>
<p class="note">[* See note in <i>Variorum Shakspere</i>, vol.
xiii. p. 208, and especially the argument of Coote in <i>New
Shakspere Society Transactions</i>, 1877-79. Coote shows that the
map was drawn by Mollineux, "perhaps with the assistance of
Hakluyt." It seems curious that, whereas Hakluyt in his first
edition of 1589 published Ortelius's map, with its huge
Magellanican continent (Hakluyt, vol. i.), in the seeond edition of
1598 he published this "new map" in which the continent disappears,
and there is nought South of New Guinea and Java save the short
S-like line. Cf. the Map of the New World dedicated to Hakluyt in
1587 (Hakluyt, vol. viii. p.272). It gives no Terra Australis. Yet
in 1589 Hakluyt preferred to print Ortelius's map with a Terra
Australis occupying most of the South Pacific! These facts seem to
show that the impartial geographic mind found it difficult to
attain a settled conviction.]</p>

<p>We know that Hakluyt very greatly valued Galvano's book. He
published an English translation, and declared that "the work
though small containeth so much rare and profitable matter as I
know not where to seek the like within so narrow and straight a
compass." One wonders whether Galvano's vague phrase was not in
Hakluyt's mind when he discussed the "new map" with its maker, and
suggested perhaps the vague curve under the Tropic of
Capricorn.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. a somewhat similar map of 1571 in the
polyglot bible of Arias Montanus. Coote's <i>Remarkable Maps</i>,
ii. I. Here South of Java is a land in the form of a broad-based
pyramid, pointing North. "It is," writes Major, "simply a line
indicating the north part of an unexplored land, exactly in the
position of the north of Australia, distinctly implying an
imperfect discovery, but not copied from, or bearing any
resemblance to, any indication of the kind in any previous map"
(<i>Early Voyages</i>, p. lxv).]</p>
<p>So far our argument has hung together, and has pointed strongly
to a conclusion: the conclusion that neither Spaniards nor
Portuguese knew anything whatever about Australia. We now, however,
have to give careful consideration to two series of contemporary
maps which, at first sight, seem to point to a different
conclusion.</p>
<p>As representative of the first series we may take Mercator's map
of 1569.<sup>*</sup> Here we find Tierra del Fuego depicted, not as
an island, but as a promontory of a huge continent, whose coast
line, drawn with firm hand, stretches in unbroken curve away to the
North-West till it all but touches New Guinea at a point which
suggests Cape York. On the huge continent is written, "This Austral
continent some call Magellanican from its discoverer." New Guinea
is represented as a large square-built island. Its northern coast,
which, as we have seen, had been discovered and redis-covered, is
drawn with deeply marked headlands and bays, and with many names.
The East, West and South coasts are drawn in unbroken curves and
have no names. The passage between the South coast of New Guinea,
and the North coast of the Magellanican continent&mdash;a passage
that makes one think of Torres Strait&mdash;is partially occupied
by a conventional pattern. And on New Guinea we have an inscription
which ends by saying that "whether it is an island or part of the
Austral continent is hitherto unknown." Westward from New Guinea
the coastline of the Austral continent falls away into a great
gulf, the Western side of which is formed by another huge
promontory which nearly reaches Java. The great gulf makes one
think of the Gulf of Carpentaria: and in the midst of it&mdash;in
addition to a mighty fish which stretches its huge length half-way
across the gulf&mdash;are two islands, the larger of which looks as
if it might possibly be Groote Eyland. Then the coast line falls
away steeply to the South-West, and finally, after skirting "the
Land of Parrots," and after rounding the Cape of Good Hope,
traverses the South Atlantic and joins the Eastern coast of Tierra
del Fuego.</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-21">Illustration 21</a>.]</p>
<p>At first sight one would be tempted to say that the man who drew
this map must have had some knowledge of the outline of the
Northern coast of Australia. But closer inspection of the map, and
especially of certain inscriptions, which I will discuss later,
would stir suspicion. And when one studies the map in connection
with other maps of the same series, and when one considers the
explanations offered by the map-makers, suspicion grows into
certainty; certainty that Mercator's Austral continent was the
creation of Mercator's ingenious imagination, and that he had no
knowledge whatever of Australia.</p>
<p>When geographers of the school of which Mercator was the most
distinguished representative sat down to make their maps, they had
certain fixed ideas in mind which determined their drawing of those
parts of the world of which they had no authentic knowledge.</p>
<p>In the first place, they had in mind the conceptions of the
ancient geographers, and especially of Pomponius Mela and of
Claudius Ptolemy. It is hardly possible, we are told, to exaggerate
the influence of "the despotic sway" of Ptolemy. The map of the
cosmographer of the school of Mercator was a map of Ptolemy
cautiously brought up to date. Now, according to Ptolemy, as we
remember, the Indian Ocean was a land-locked Ocean. And the
southern coast of this Ocean was the great "Unknown Land" of the
Southern temperate zone, which, so ancient geographers agreed,
certainly existed in one form or another. The map-maker of this
school, then, was disposed to take Ptolemy's Unknown Land of the
South as basis of an Austral continent. He perceived, it is true,
that Ptolemy had not known the whole truth. The Portuguese had
knocked a big hole in the Western corner of his Unknown Land. And
Magellan had bored a small hole in the eastern corner. But
otherwise Ptolemy's authority stood firm. There seemed no reason to
disbelieve in the rest of his continent of the South. He had been
in error in thinking that this continent was joined to Asia on the
East, and to Africa on the West. But, after all, to give up
Ptolemy's teaching on this point was but to return to Mela and
older classical authorities, who had conceivcd of the land of the
Antichthones not as a continent, but as a huge continental island.
No doubt, on this matter, Mela had shown better insight than
Ptolemy.</p>
<p>In the second place, it seemed to the map-makers that the
authority of the ancient geographers was confirmed by the authority
of the new science. The laws of physics, argued Mercator in
1569,<sup>*</sup> determine that the earth must be "in a state of
perfect equilibrium." An excrescence on one side of the globe
<i>must</i> in the nature of things be balanced by an excrescence
on the opposite side; for otherwise the constitution of the world
could not hold together in its centre ("alioquin mundi
constitutionem in suo centro non posse consistere "). If the
ancient geographers had grasped this truth they could have proved
that the existence of America was a physical necessity, simply
because a New World in the West was <i>needed</i> to balance the
Old World in the East. And, in the same way, it was now reasonable
to assert that a huge unknown continent <i>must</i>, by reason of
physical necessity, exist in the South to balance the huge known
continents in the North. "Since Asia, Europe and Africa are for the
most part situated to the North of the Equator, there <i>must</i>
be under the antarctic pole a continent so great that with the
Southern parts of Asia, and the new India or America, it should be
a weight equal to the other lands."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Rainaud, p. 314.]</p>
<p class="note"><a name="cotton" id="cotton"></a>[** My colleague,
Professor Cotton, has kindly written the following note on
Mercator's argument:<br>
<br>
"Although the scienee of geology cannot even yet afford an
explanation of the distribution of continental masses and ocean
basins which amounts to a demonstration, there is ample evidence
that Mercator's hypothesis, suggestive as it was, has no real
foundation.<br>
<br>
The geodetic measurements of the values of gravity in various parts
of the world have revealed the striking fact that the foree of
gravity is greater in the oceanic regions than it is on the surface
of the continents. It is now generally accepted by geologists that
this fact has a genetic significance; and that the depressions of
the solid earth in which the ocean waters now lie are due to the
sinking in of the inherently denser portions of the earth's outer
shell or crust under gravitational attraction.<br>
<br>
Mercator's hypothesis contains the implicit assumption that the
earth is either quite homogeneous in structure, or is built up of a
series of concentric shells each of which is homogeneous; and it is
now known that this is not the case.<br>
<br>
Although Mercator's hypothesis has not stood the test of time, its
fruitful results afford a most excellent illustration of the value
of imagination in stimulating research. It has so often been the
case that in the search for one truth the light of genius has
revealed many others."]</p>
<p>In the third place, the sixteenth-century map-maker had in mind
certain passages from the travel books of Marco Polo and his
successors. He remembered that Marco Polo had been
understood<sup>*</sup> to say that some 1200 miles (750 miles
according to another text) South of Java "you reach an extensive
and rich province which forms a part of the main land, and is named
Locac," a word that was some-times mis-printed Beach:&mdash;a
province in which were found elephants, and brazil wood, and gold
in incredible quantity, but which was "little visited on account of
the inhumanity of its inhabitants." He remembered that Marco Polo
had also been understood to say that, still further Southward, "so
far to the Southward as to render the North Star invisible," "you
reach the island of Java the Lesser&mdash;not less than 2,000 miles
in circuit," an island rich in spices which the traveller had
visited and explored, having been detained there for five months by
contrary winds, while on his way from China to India. And he
remembered that these statements had been confirmed by the story
told by the skipper to Ludovico Varthema about races of men who
lived to the South of Java, and who navigated their ships not by
the North Star but by the Southern Cross.</p>
<p class="note">[* It was, as we have seen, a misunderstanding.
Marco Polo had spoken of lands to the South not of Java but of
Cochin-China. Locac was not Australia but Siam. Java Minor was not
Groote Eyland but Sumatra. See Yule's <i>Marco Polo</i> and
Beazley's <i>Dawn of Modern Geography</i>.]</p>
<p>Now let us observe in a little detail how the sixteenth-century
geographer, who had these three fixed ideas in his mind,
interpreted the new discoveries.</p>
<p>When Amerigo Vespucci in 1502 brought home the exciting news,
which lost nothing in the telling, that he had sailed down the
coast of a New World as far as 350 South Latitude, how would the
news be interpreted by the professional cosmographer? The student
of to-day turns to his atlas, and remarks that Amerigo had sailed
down the Eastern coast of South America about as far as the Rio de
la Plata. The student of the early sixteenth century turned to his
Ptolemy, and remarked that the situation was very puzzling, but
that the most likely guess was that Amerigo had sailed down the
hitherto unknown Eastern coast of Cattigara-land, i.e. the
South-ward extension of Eastern Asia. What was to be done next in
order that this theory might be proved or disproved? If Ptolemy was
to be believed there was no way of getting through or round this
land into the Indian Ocean. But Ptolemy had also thought there was
no way of getting round Africa into the Indian Ocean, and the
Portuguese had already proved this opinion to be wrong. It was at
least worth while to follow further Southward the coast of the New
World&mdash;"America," as readers of Amerigo's fascinating letters
were beginning to call it&mdash;to see whether there were not some
passage between it and Ptolemy's "Unknown Land" in the South.</p>
<p>In 1515 and in 1520 a German cosmographer named Sch&ouml;ner
published maps that are interesting evidence as to the way in which
students were beginning to interpret news. Sch&ouml;ner had been reading
the account of a voyage by Portuguese seamen who claimed that they
had actually discovered a passage to the Indian Ocean. He thought
the evidence was good enough, and in his maps he drew this passage
at 45&deg; S. Lat. Now there is no passage anywhere near 45&deg; S. Lat.,
and it seems very unlikely that these seamen had discovered the
straits which <i>did</i> exist at 52&deg; S. Lat. They probably sailed
up some bay or estuary&mdash;most likely the Gulf of San
Matias,&mdash;and thought it was a strait. Sch&ouml;ner was a
cosmographer who was rather easily convinced by evidence that
claimed to prove the existence of straits. He drew a similar narrow
passage through the isthmus of Panama, and another very wide
passage between Virginia and New-foundland. But while his map is no
good evidence as to the discovery of a strait leading into the
Indian Ocean, it is very good evidence as to what geographers
expected would be found on the other side.</p>

<b>23. THE WESTERN HALF OF SCH&Ouml;NER'S FIRST GLOBE, 1515.<br>
(From Steven's <i>Johann Sch&ouml;ner</i>.)</b></p>
<p>According to Sch&ouml;ner's conception in the map of 1515<sup>*</sup>
there is a great ocean round the South Pole. But this ocean is
surrounded by a thick ring of land,<sup>**</sup> with one opening
in the ring in a direction due South from Java. This ring of land
Sch&ouml;ner calls "the region of Brazil" in the map of 1515, and "Lower
Brazil" in the map of 1520.</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-23">Illustration 23</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** The map of 1520 breaks up this ring into a
group of large islands: which seems to show how wholly fanciful
were the map-makers' dreams about the structure of the Southern
World.]</p>
<p>He had obtained his information, it seems, from Portuguese
seamen chiefly interested in the New World as a source of supply of
the very useful dye-wood called brazil, which had long been one of
the recognized precious commodities of the Far East, and of which
Marco Polo had made honourable mention in his account of Locac and
Java Minor. This lower Brazilian region, Sch&ouml;ner explains, extends
nearly to Malacca, and is not far off the Cape of Good
Hope.<sup>*</sup> And he draws the outline of this great Austral
Continent with a detail that suggests he was well acquainted with
every bay and headland, both on its Northern and its Southern
coasts. He is also able to tell you of its snowy mountains, its
excellent fruits, precious metals, splendid birds, and its gigantic
plants.<sup>**</sup> At a later date (1533), he is able to add that
the inhabitants of this region, "the very great Southern Region of
Brazil," live a good honest life, are not cannibals, reverence the
older men, and call their children Thomas.<sup>***</sup> All these
interesting facts the thoughtful Sch&ouml;ner, with head full of the
marvels of Amerigo's letter, and reminiscences of earlier
travel-books, was able, it seems, to gather from information given
by Portuguese brazil-wood cutters of what they had seen on the
Southern side of some bay or estuary in Patagonia.</p>

<p class="note">[** Rainaud, p. 250.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Rainaud, p. 297.]</p>
<p>It seems likely that when Magellan sailed in 1519 he had seen
Sch&ouml;ner's map or some other map of this type.<sup>*</sup> He was,
at least, confident that a strait did exist, and he was determined
to find it, he said, even if he had to sail as far South as 75&deg;. He
found the strait in 52&deg;, and sailed through it. To the South was a
land which he called Tierra del Fuego. And what was Tierra del
Fuego? Was it an island? Or was it the tip of a great continent?
The voyagers thought that it was an island or a collection of
islands. They "thought," says an enterprising journalist who
interviewed them on their return, "there was no continent, but only
islands, as they occasionally heard on that side the reverberation
and roar of the sea at a more distant part of the
coast";&mdash;surely a remarkably bad argument! If the geographers
had believed the travellers they would have had to abandon
Sch&ouml;ner's theory that a great Southern Continent extended from the
South side of the straits "somewhat as Africa extended from the
South side of the straits of Gibraltar." And, as we have already
seen, many map makers <i>were</i> sceptic or agnostic, made their
Southern world not continental but oceanic, pointed out that no
lands had been discovered, and declined to fill their maps with
vain imaginations.</p>
<p class="note">[* Guillemard's <i>Magellan</i>, p. 192.]</p>
<p>But other cosmographers remained unconvinced by the argument of
the travellers. Is the "reverberation and roar of the sea" never
heard save on islands? What the seamen had heard could easily be
accounted for by the existence of some deep inlet. Tierra del
Fuego, they were convinced, was no island, but the tip of the
continent of the South; the nature of which could be fully
explained by those who had studied the map of Ptolemy, had read
Marco Polo and Varthema, and were acquainted with the laws of
physical science. And when they made their maps of the South they
gave bold expression to this conviction.</p>
<p>Let us consider a map of this sort made by a Frenchman, Orontius
Finaeus in 1531.<sup>*</sup> Like a good orthodox geographer he is
working on his Ptolemy, and is seeking to bring him up to date.
Magellan has bored a hole into the extreme South-East corner of
Ptolemy's land-locked Indian Sea. Where then are we now? The
country to the North, recently discovered and conquered by Pizarro
and his friends, is evidently Ptolemy's Southward extension of
Eastern Asia. So Finaeus confidently marks Ptolemy's Cattigara as a
seaport of Peru. Following Ptolemy's map Northward, one comes to
Sinae (China) or Cathay, and this is evidently the country, part of
which Cortez has recently conquered under the name of Mexico; so
Finaeus puts down Pekin (Cambaluc) in the same land as Mexico,
about a thousand miles to the North-West. In short, what recent
voyages have done is to supply Ptolemy's Asia with a badly needed
Eastern coast. Thus, e.g., Newfoundland (Baccalar) is obviously a
promontory of Siberia.</p>

<br>
<b>24. MAP OF ORONTIUS FINAEUS, 1531<br>

<p>So far, Finaeus, no doubt, felt that he was treading on firm
ground. In constructing the map of Eastern Asia he was simply
adding to the map of Ptolemy the undoubted discoveries of Spaniards
and Portuguese. But what was one to say about the Southern side of
the Indian Ocean, the great sweep of "Unknown Land" which, in
Ptolemy's map, linked Asia to Africa. Why not, in general, leave it
as Ptolemy had left it, a great sweep of unknown land? Diaz and
Gama had knocked a hole in it in the South-West corner, and now
Magellan had knocked another hole in it in the South-East corner;
but, for the rest, no one had proved that Ptolemy was wrong. On the
contrary, Magellan had seen land to the South that was, no doubt, a
promontory of the unknown continent. That continent accordingly
Finaeus will draw upon his map, and in order to be strictly honest
he will write upon it "Austral Land recently discovered but not yet
<i>fully</i> known." But as, in fact, no one knew anything whatever
about it, he was gloriously free to make it look pretty. So he put
in gulfs and creeks and headlands and rivers with a profuse detail
that would seem to suggest that he had returned from a voyage of
scientific survey with a portfolio full of charts. In reality the
fulness of detail is proof, if proof were needed, of completeness
of ignorance. The whole is purely the work of the artistic
imagination.</p>
<p>There are, however, certain features of the continent that
deserve our attention. Its coast line, on the Indian Ocean, is
broken into two huge bulges, separated by a great gulf in a
direction slightly East of the South of Java, in a position that
seems to correspond to the break in the ring of Sch&ouml;ner's "Lower
Brazil." We shall find this gulf of interest when we return to the
study of Mercator's map of 1569. On the Eastern of the two bulges,
which is separated from South America by the "Magellanican Sea,"
Finaeus writes the amazing words "REGIO PATALIS." The words are
amazing because REGIO PATALIS means the region of Patala, the town
which Alexander the Great had founded at the mouth of the
Indus!</p>

<p>Names in those days travelled the world in invisible coat and in
shoes of swiftness, and we cannot always watch their strides. But
in this case what happened is pretty clear. Patala crossed the
ocean from India to Antarctica by the bridge built by the words of
Roger Bacon:&mdash;"The Southern front of India, in the region of
Pathalis and the neighbouring land, runs out towards the Tropic of
Capricorn."<sup>*</sup> We can even, to some extent, watch its
progress. Its route seems to have been</p>
<p>determined by the phrase of Nicolo de Conti that certain places
in Southern India were situated "in the second gulf beyond the
Indus," which was understood to mean that they were in the gulf of
Siam. So, in Behaim's map of 1492, "India Patalis" is somewhere in
the longitude of the Malay Peninsula, and has reached 10&deg; S.
Lat.<sup>**</sup> And in a map of the medieval type, first printed
in 1522, Patalis Regio, linked to India by the Terrestrial
Paradise, extends Southward to the very bottom of the
map.<sup>***</sup> In fact Patala had travelled so far Southward,
that Magellan's voyage, breaking down the Roger Bacon bridge, cut
off its retreat, and Finaeus decided that it must stay in the
"Austral Continent."</p>

"BRASIELIE REGIO"; a phrase which we recognize at once as another
illustration of the rapid ways of geographic names. Sch&ouml;ner had
learnt about 1515 that South America was a good place for the
dye-wood called brazil. He therefore called the country Brazil, and
the land to the South he also called "Region of Brazil" or "Lower
Brazil." Finaeus thought the idea a good one, but as he had decided
to call the Eastern bulge "Regio Patalis" he had, it seems, to push
his "Region of Brazil" Westward, to a point at which it nearly
reached Marco Polo's Island of Zanzibar in the neighbourhood of
Africa. This seems to explain the fact that in Mercator's map there
is a province of Terra Australis far away to the South of the Cape
of Good Hope called "Region of Parrots" (Psittacorum
Regio).<sup>*</sup> A coast far away to the South of the Cape of
Good Hope looks an unlikely place for parrots, but there are always
plenty of parrots in "Brazil," and Frobisher and other map-makers
assure us that in this place "Portugals see popinjays commonly of a
marvellous greatness."</p>
<p class="note">[* In Mercator the Region of the Parrots is in
about 45&deg;. In other maps of the same type it is as far South as 60&deg;
or 70&deg;.]</p>
<p>We are now able to look again at the Map of Mercator with better
knowledge of the nature of the thoughts which it is likely to
express. His mind is possessed by certain fixed ideas. (1) Tierra
del Fuego is part of an Austral continent. (2) This continent must
be a very big and heavy one, for it has to add much needed weight
to the scale which holds the comparatively meagre continents of the
South in order that they may hold their own against their bulky
sisters of the North. (3) It includes the lands South of Java of
which Marco Polo and Varthema had told.</p>
<p>He starts, then, with the known land of Tierra del Fuego, which
he draws with inlets and rivers, which are intended, one may guess,
to explain the reverberating roar of the sea which Magellan's
seamen had heard, and which had seemed to them to suggest the
erroneous conclusion that Tierra del Fuego was an island. Then he
continues the coastline of Tierra del Fuego on a North-Westerly
curve that touches, or all but touches, New Guinea. More honest or
less artistic than Finaeus, he leaves the unknown coastline
undecorated. But he boldly writes across the whole continent the
monstrous statement that Magellan was its discoverer! The truth was
that the continent was not Magellanican but Mercatorian, and that
of its many thousand miles Magellan had seen about three hundred
and twenty.</p>
<p>The continent, then, which Magellan had discovered stretches
away from Tierra del Fuego to New Guinea. The Northern coast of New
Guinea is marked by geographic features, and by names; and it seems
clear that Mercator got his information from Spanish or Portuguese
narratives of voyages.<sup>*</sup> But the other coasts are given
in unbroken and nameless outline, that seems to express ignorance,
and he confesses that he does not even know whether New Guinea is
an island. It may be a hitherto unknown part, he says, of the
Austral continent.</p>
<p class="note">[* He makes the interesting though incorrect
suggestion that New Guinea may be the Labadii Insula which Ptolemy
marked in the S.E. corner of his Indian Ocean, and which probably
was Sumatra.]</p>
<p>Now it seems curious that Mercator, who had without question
decided that Tierra del Fuego was part of the continent, should
have expressed this doubt about New Guinea, and should have drawn
his map in a way that suggests that it probably is an island. One
wonders whether Spanish or Portuguese seamen had been in the
neighbourhood of Torres Strait, and had come home, like Dutch
seamen a century later, doubting whether it was a strait or only a
shallow bay. They seem at least to have sailed far enough down the
Southern coast to get the suggestion that New Guinea was possibly,
and even probably, an island. But the matter was so "uncertain"
that map-makers and writers continued to take different opinions.
Ortelius drew an island, but wrote on it that it was "uncertain"
whether it was an island or part of the continent. Wytfliet drew an
island, and wrote that it was separated from the continent by a
narrow strait.<sup>*</sup> Plancius definitely made it a part of
the continent.<sup>**</sup> On the whole, however, the insular
theory prevailed. "Almost all the Northern side of it," wrote Dr.
Arias soon after 1614, "has been discovered. It is a country
encompassed with water, and according to the greater number of
those who have Seen it, it is 700 leagues in
circuit."<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-28">Illustration 28</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See <a href="#il-26">Illustration 26</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Dr. Arias, however, wrote with knowledge that
the voyage of Torres (1606) had <i>proved</i> the insular theory to
be correct.]</p>
<p>Then, passing Westward, Mercator shows us a huge gulf that
certainly <i>ought</i> to be the Gulf of Carpentaria, containing
two islands, the larger of which certainly <i>ought</i> to be
Groote Eyland. But we observe that the great gulf roughly
corresponds to the great gulf in the Austral continent of Finaeus,
which in its turn roughly corresponds to the opening in the ring of
the Region of Brazil of Sch&ouml;ner. For some inexplicable reason, it
was the fashion to draw a big gulf between two huge promontories in
this part of the Austral continent, and Mercator has found this
fashion particularly convenient because, as we shall notice in a
moment, it gave him an opportunity to find space for two islands
which, he understood, existed South of Java. The main difference
between his map and those of his predecessors is that, in order to
make his continent as big and as heavy as possible, he has pushed
its coastline up much further to the North. It seems to me certain
that the geography is still wholly imaginary.</p>

<b>26. PART OF PLANCIUS'S MAP, 1594.<br>
(From Linschoten's <i>Voyages</i>, 1623.)</b></p>
<p>As to the larger island, which ought to be Groote Eyland, it
turns out on closer inspection to be Marco Polo's Java Minor (i.e.
Sumatra); and Mercator tells you that the island "produces various
spices never seen by Europeans, as you may read in M. Paulus
Venetus, Book 3, Chapter 13." The smaller island is Marco Polo's
Pentam, an island which in real life stands in the straits of
Malacca.<sup>*</sup> Mercator understood Marco Polo to mean that
these islands existed Southward of Java, and he therefore cut a
particularly big gulf in order to contain them. Another geographer,
Plancius, who made a map similar to that of Mercator in 1594,
recognized that Marco Polo's Java Minor was Sumatra, and had
therefore no place Southward from Java; so he removed the island
from the map, and at the same time greatly curtailed the gulf which
had been made to contain it; it dwindles not because any discovery
has been made, but because Marco Polo has been better
understood.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "The Singapore Island of our day." See
discussion in Cordiers <i>Ser Marco Polo</i>, p. 105.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Plancius's map is printed in Hakluyt, vol. ix.
See <a href="#il-26">Illustration 26</a>.]</p>
<p>Passing to the bulging promontory which forms the Western side
of the gulf, and which, if it were anything real, would be the
coast of West Australia, we still find ourselves in a country which
owes its names, if not its existence, to the misunderstood talk of
Marco Polo. On it we read: "Beach, an auriferous province, which
few foreigners approach on account of the inhumanity of its
people." We are, of course, tempted to see a reference to the gold
mines of West Australia, and the ferocious manners of the
blackfellows on the North-Western coast. But Beach was an earlier
printer's error for Locac:<sup>*</sup> and Locac was a region which
Marco Polo described as being South of Cochin China, but which his
editor believed that he had described as being South of Java. The
gold mines and the inhumane people were not in West Australia but
in Siam or Cambodia.</p>
<p class="note">[* "In the Basle edition of Marco Polo in 1532, the
printer unluckily altered the L into a B, and the first C into an
E, so that Locach became Boeach. This was afterwards shortened into
Beach...As, however, some editions of Marco Polo retained the word
Locach and others Beach, both names came to be copied on to maps,
and, the point of departure being Java, the map-makers following
the course indicated in Marco Polo, laid these countries down as
forming part of the Great Southern Land, which was supposed to
occupy the entire South part of the globe" (Major's <i>Prince Henry
the Navigator</i>, Appendix, p. 307; quoted by Collingridge, p.
199). On Behaim's globe Locach became Coachs.]</p>
<p>Below Beach in Mercator's map we find the inscription, "Maletur,
a kingdom in which is very great plenty of Spices." Maletur is
Marco Polo's kingdom of Malaiur, or Kingdom of Malays, which
existed at the South-East end of the Malay Peninsula. Then we have
the "Kingdom of Lucach," another rendering of Locac. It is
evidently a matter of great satisfaction to Mercator that his
theory of the physical necessity for a great and weighty Southern
continent received confirmation from the authority of Oriental
travellers. "That very vast regions exist here," he wrote a little
lower down," he easily believes who has read Book III, Chapters XI
and XII of Marcus Paulus the Venetian, and who has collated them
with Book VI, Chapter XXVII of Ludovicus Varthema, Roman
Patrician."</p>
<p>It seems to me clear that Mercator's Magellanican continent is
the expression not of geographical information but of respect to
the authority of Ptolemy, of desire to find habitation for the
names mentioned in the misinterpreted passage of Marco Polo, and of
belief in a certain physical theory of the globe. To do justice to
Mercator's map we should consider it not as a statement of fact,
but as a guess at truth. And, after all, it was not such a very bad
guess. He drew an outline that was curiously like the outline of
the Northern coast of Australia. And when he insisted that there
was a great mass of land in the South the conclusron of his
argument at least was entirely right. There was not one continent,
but there were two continents: Australia and the Antarctic
Continent, which recent exploration has shown to be as big as
Australia and Europe put together,<sup>*</sup> and with mighty
mountain ranges which, Mercator would have argued, must greatly
increase its importance as a make-weight in the vast scales of the
globe.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. Bruce's <i>Polar Exploration</i>.]</p>
<p>Apart from the question of its value as evidence of geographical
knowledge at the time, Mercator's map of 1569 is a map of singular
interest in view of the later development of our story. It became
the recognized authority in the realm of scientific geography, the
Ptolemy of the New Age. A long series of later maps were, either
avowedly or virtually, merely later editions of the masterpiece.
And they all tend to confirm the view that it represents not a
knowledge of facts but a clever guess at truth. In fact, in the
Atlas published by Mercator's friend Ortelius, realities are stated
with perfect plainness. He wrote in the Preface: "Of the fifth part
(of the world), situated under the South Pole, which we call
Magellan, one cannot say much, since it has been discovered only in
two or three straits; as in the region of the Straits of Magellan,
where we call the land Tierra del Fuego, etc., and at New Guinea,
which we likewise think to be a part of it."</p>
<p>On the frontispiece of the Atlas, the four continents are
represented as female figures at full length. And near the figure
of America is placed, not a fifth full-length figure, but a female
bust of head, neck and breasts, and under the breasts burns a fire.
And a Latin verse explains "Not far off, the last nymph raises her
shining head, with a virgin's face and features and lovely breasts,
but hand-less and foot-less, barely known even by a few. They say
that of late the Spaniard Magellan burned with love for her, for he
chanced to look once upon her unaware amid the flames that flashed
all about her. Then the maiden, suffused with a deep blush, at once
veiled her head, and wrapped herself in dusky smoke and the shade
of murky darkness. But, so as not rashly to allow herself to be
seen a second time, she fixed this remembering flame beneath her
breast."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Haud procul hinc nitidum caput exserit ultima

<p>The love-adventure of Magellan and the bashful virgin was a
topic of singular fascination to geographer poets. The Latin verses
were reprinted in every new Latin edition of Ortelius; and, when a
French edition was published, a new poet retold in French verse the
famous old story in a form enriched by further imaginations.
Magellan, he says, barely kissed her on the mouth, and did not find
out whether her limbs were "black, white, shorn or hairy, but
shrewdly did he suspect, from the flames of fire that he saw around
her, that he was not welcome. And thus he turned away, without
having other glory, bestowing on her his everlasting
name."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "Non pas trop loin dela peut on voir le

<p>And yet Ortelius, with these facts in mind, is not afraid to
draw with firm hand a great full-length continent, extending all
round the world from Tierra del Fuego to New Guinea&mdash;about
whose insularity <i>he</i> also is uncertain&mdash;and from New
Guinea to Tierra del Fuego.<sup>*</sup> And of this huge outline
all that had been "discovered" were "two or three straits" in
Tierra del Fuego and in New Guinea; the rest remained "unknown"

<p>There is one other map of this type that I will mention, because
it, and the treatise that accompanies the atlas which contains it,
have been used as an argument to show that the coast of Australia
was visited during this period. It is a map published by Wytfliet
in 1597.<sup>*</sup> It represents a Terra Australis that has very
much the same features as are represented in the earlier maps we
have noticed. The source of much of the information represented in
the map may be partly guessed from the fact that the author is able
to draw you a deep creek which pierces the Southern Land to its
very heart, and has its origin apparently a few miles away from the
South Pole!</p>

<p>But the argument as to the knowledge of Australia is mainly
founded not on the map, but on the following passage in the
treatise: "The Australis Terra is the most Southern of all lands.
It is separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its shores are
hitherto but little known, since, after one voyage and another,
that route has been deserted, and seldom is the country visited,
unless when sailors are driven there by storms. The Australis Terra
begins at two or three degrees from the Equator, and is maintained
by some to be of so great an extent, that, if it were thoroughly
explored, it would be regarded as a fifth part of the world."</p>
<p>It seems to me that the significance of this passage has been
very much exaggerated. It has its origin, in my opinion, not in "a
discovery of Australia" (as Mr. Collingridge thinks), but in the
voyages through the straits of Magellan, which, so geographers of
the school of Mercator contended, had meant the discovery of the
Magellanican continent or Terra Australis.</p>
<p>When a cosmographer of the school of Mercator said that Terra
Australis had been visited, all he meant was that Tierra del Fuego
had been visited, and that the rest of the continent had bashfully
veiled herself and had refused to be visited. And, after the
disastrous voyages of Magellan and Del Cano, even the visits to
Tierra del Fuego has ceased. The route through the straits had been
abandoned, and the shy continent was permitted to remain
undisturbed behind the veil. That is the meaning of Wytfliet's
statement, as I understand it. The "sailors driven to Terra
Australia by storms" were, I imagine, the same Sailors as the
"Portingals" who, according to Frobisher, "saw popinjays commonly
of a marvellous greatness" on the shores of Terra Incognita far
Southward of the Cape of Good Hope. Their voyages probably took
place to the part of Brazil that is in South America, not to the
part of Brazil that, according to Sch&ouml;ner and Finaeus, is in
Antarctica.</p>
<p>So far our study both of narratives and of maps has tended to
foster, in us the spirit of unbelief. But we now have to study
another series of maps of a different type: maps which I regard as
the difficulty of our present chapter, and which I have therefore
reserved for consideration to the end, in order that we might have
in mind what, apart from them, is known about cosmographers and
cosmography in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>These maps are of various dates, ranging from about 1530 to
about 1570.<sup>*</sup> One of them was made in the time of Francis
of France for the benefit of his son the Dauphin, afterwards Henry
II.; and it seems likely that its date lies between 1530 and 1536.
Another, made by Jean Rotz, who dedicated it first to the King of
France, and afterwards to the King of England, bears the date
1542.</p>
<p class="note">[* See maps in the following pages (<i>sic</i>)
{i.e. The next four maps in this ebook, Illustrations 29, 30, 31
and 32. Ed.}].</p>
<p>All the maps of this type were made by French map-makers; but
they furnish conclusive evidence that they were based on a common
original, and that the common original was a Portuguese map. They
represent Portuguese knowledge or Portuguese speculation as to the
contents of the world to the South of Java. It is, therefore, well
to compare them with the Portuguese charts by Rodriguez or Reinel
which we have already noticed. The charts of Rodriguez and Reinel
show knowledge of the North coasts of the islands from Java to
Timor, and Rodriguez even seems to show a knowledge also of their
South coast but neither chart shows any knowledge of land to the
South of these islands.</p>

<p>Now the maps which we have to study give the North coast of Java
with geographical features, and with names in plenty. The island is
square built, and its figure is singularly unlike reality. Detailed
information is given of the West coast, which is made almost as
long as the North coast. To the East of Java we note, as in the map
of Sebastian Cabot, a gulf in which are the two little islands of
Bali and Lomboc.</p>

<br>
<b>30. PART OF JEAN ROTZ'S CHART, 1542. (In the British

<p>On the gulf are written the Portuguese words&mdash;which the
French copyist has, it seems, been unable to translate&mdash;Anda
ne barcha:<sup>*</sup> "no boats go here"; words that remind us of
the statement of the Portuguese writer, Barros, that the natives
say that "whoever shall proceed beyond these straits will be
hurried away by strong currents, so as never to be able to return;
and for this reason they never attempt to navigate it." But when we
pass Eastward to the island of Sumbava an amazing thing takes
place. Sumbava is drawn, not as an island, but as the tip of a
gigantic continent stretching far away down to the South. In one of
the maps, which is probably the earliest, this continent is called
Jave la Grande. It is separated from Java by a narrow channel which
is called Rio Grande.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mr. Collingridge first noticed these words,
which seem to prove that these maps are French copies of a lost
Portuguese original.]</p>
<p>In another map&mdash;made by Pierre Desceliers and dated
1550&mdash;two men are to be seen with mattocks in hand in the act
of digging this river. The outline of the coast of Jave la Grande
is broken by bays and capes, rivers and islands, that are drawn
with a definiteness and a variety that, if used by a modern
map-maker, would suggest a claim to actual knowledge. In the two
maps by Jean Rotz the Western coast line ends at 35&deg;. In another,
the "Dauphin" map, all detail ends at the same point, whence a
straight and nameless line is drawn to the bottom of the paper. But
Desceliers' maps of 1546 and 1550 have details and names down to
50&deg;, at which point, the coastline of Jave la Grande joins the
coastline of a great Southern continent, like that of Mercator's
school, which is called "La Terre Austral nondum tout (!)
descouverte," though Desceliers can give you the names of
geographic features even on this not <i>wholly</i> discovered
continent.</p>
<p>On the Eastern side, one map, by Rotz, makes the coast end at
60&deg;, while the others extend it to the Southern margin. The
interior is ornamented with unusual profuseness and variety. In one
map we see animals that remind one of those seen by the comrades of
Magellan in Patagonia:<sup>*</sup> "with the head and ears of a
mule, the body of a camel, the legs of a stag, and the tail of a
horse"; other animals that look rather like cows, and also rather
like stags; well-built farms assailed by naked savages, spears in
hand. In another map we have two lions, and a feudal castle. In
another (Vallard's) we have picturesque snow-clad mountains, a
serpent nearly as long as the tree up which it climbs, and animals
that look like camels. In another we have the two men, with
mattocks digging the "River" between Java and Jave la Grande, while
the interior is occupied by illustrated quotations from Marco
Polo's descriptions of Java, Pegu, Malacca, Sumatra, the Andaman
islands and Ceylon.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mr. Collingridge's suggestion.]</p>
<p>Now it is contended by writers of great learning and ability
that these maps prove that the West, North, and East coasts of
Australia had been discovered and carefully explored by navigators
in the early years of the sixteenth century. They lead Mr. Major to
"regard it as highly probable that Australia was discovered by the
Portuguese between the years 1511 and 1529, and almost a
demonstrable certainty that it was discovered before the year
1542."</p>

<p>On the West coast he is able to identify Exmouth Gulf, Shark
Bay, and Houtman's Abrolhos; on the East coast he thinks it "by no
means improbable" that "Baye Neufve" is Bass's Straits, and that
"Gouffre" is Oyster Bay in Tasmania; and it "may be fairly presumed
that the islands in the extreme East...represent New Zealand." Mr.
Collingridge is still more prepared to go into detail, and to
explain every feature of these maps in terms of modern Australian
geography. And both Mr. Major and Mr. Collingridge are able to
explain all apparent difficulties in a way that, they claim, makes
their argument more convincing than ever.</p>
<p>We should begin by recognizing that these authors are right when
they remind us that the many and great unlikenesses of Jave la
Grande to Australia do not prove that it does not represent real
knowledge. If the Portuguese discovered Australia before 1542, and
drew a map of it, that map would certainly be unlike Australia in
many important respects. And especially we should expect to find
big mistakes in regard to Longitude. Seamen in those days were able
to find their Latitudes with fair correctness, but the most skilful
were, as they confessed, mere guessers when they were calculating
Longitude. At a time when cosmographers were making Newfoundland a
promontory of Siberia, and Mexico a part of China, there would be
no sort of professional discredit in placing Australia far too much
to the West. And other remarkable unlikenesses may easily be
explained as mistakes, provided the likenesses are sufficient to
convince us of identity.</p>

<br>
<b>32. VALLARD'S MAP, 1547. (From a Print in the British
Museum.)</b></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I regard the claim that has been advanced on
behalf of these maps with suspicion: and mainly for the following
reasons.</p>
<p>In the first place, it seems to me exceedingly unlikely that
voyages took place during this period that would have enabled
cosmographers to draw maps of the Western, Northern, and Eastern
coasts of Australia. What we are asked to believe is that between
1512 and 1536 Portuguese and Spanish seamen sailed the whole length
of the West coast to Cape Leeuwin, and the whole length of the East
coast to Tasmania, and that they surveyed those huge coast lines
with the accuracy, if not of a Cook or a Flinders, at least of a
Columbus or a Vespucci. Now in our contemporary narratives, written
by men who, like Galvano, must have known everything knowable about
this matter, there is no record, no hint, of a single voyage of
discovery on those coasts. In our contemporary maps, apart from the
maps of this type, there is no line that suggests knowledge of
them. And everything that we know of the ideas and habits of
Portuguese and Spaniards in this period makes it highly improbable
that these discoveries would be made. When I think of the enormous
difficulties of navigation on these Australian coasts, of the
scanty naval equipment of the handful of Portuguese, who, in 1512,
had just arrived at the Moluccas, and of the lack of motive for
voyages of detailed and scientific survey, I feel that nothing but
evidence of the most unanswerable nature would induce me to accept
those maps as representing the discovery of Australia.</p>
<p>And, in the second place, while I find it very difficult to
believe that these maps represent the results of voyages of ships,
I find it very easy to believe that they represent the results of
voyages of imagination. We have seen that at this time, owing to
various reasons, it was the fashion to fill vacant spaces in the
South with continents which were the result not of discoveries but
of philosophical speculations. When voyagers reported that they had
seen a few miles of land, cosmographers at once declared that this
land must be the tip of a continent which centered in the South
Pole. Tierra del Fuego was a tip of this continent. New Guinea was
either a tip of this same continent, or an island separated from it
only by a very narrow strait. And there was no coastline in the
world that was more likely to suggest a hinterland of continent
than the Northern coastline of Java. When the Portuguese came to
Java, they came to an island that had for centuries enjoyed the
reputation of being the largest and most magnificent island in the
world, an island of from three thousand to seven thousand miles in
circuit. And, away to the South of Java, Marco Polo had been
understood to say, was "an extensive and rich province that forms a
part of the mainland." And Ludovico Varthema had brought home
stories of races of men who navigated by the Southern Cross, who
lived in a country where the day did not last more than four hours,
and where it was colder than in any other part of the world.</p>
<p>We have seen how Mercator interpreted these statements. He found
a place on the map for Marco Polo's "extensive and rich province"
by adding to his Southern Continent a huge promontory stretching
Northwards towards Java. And, he wrote upon it that anyone who has
read certain chapters in Polo and Varthema will easily believe that
very vast regions here exist. But to people who, like the
Portuguese, actually visited Java, it may well have appeared that a
better interpretation might be Suggested. The travellers had not
only spoken of a continent South of Java; they had also spoken of
Java itself as "Java Major," the greatest island in the world! Was
it not likely that Java extended far Southward? Was it not possible
that, like Tierra del Fuego and perhaps New Guinea, it was a tip of
the Austral continent with a centre in the South
Pole?<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. Linschoten's statement, quoted <a href=
"#linschoten">above</a>, that some Javans thought that Java was
"firm land and parcel of the country called Terra Incognita."]</p>
<p>To this it might be objected that some said that Java was a
comparatively small island, and had even ventured to draw the vague
outline of its Southern coast, while admitting that no ships went
there. Well then, let us be reasonable cosmographers, and let us
make a compromise. Let us suppose that Java is a comparatively
small island. But let us also suppose that immediately to the South
of it, separated only by a tiny channel, lies a great continent,
which, being virtually a part of Java, we will call Jave la Grande.
Perhaps Marco Polo's "Java Major" was Something like <i>this</i>.
And perhaps the "extensive and rich province that forms part of the
mainland." is really continuous with Java Major, and may connect it
with "the Austral Land not yet wholly discovered." Anyway, as no
one knows anything whatever about this land, it will offer a fine
opportunity to the geographic artist with imagination and artistic
skill. And, seeing that it is a country that largely owes its
existence on the map to Marco Polo, decorations should mainly be
chosen from that traveller's famous book, though hints may wisely
be taken also from more recent travel stories.</p>
<p>No doubt an explanation of this sort is a guess, and a guess
that may easily be entirely wrong. But, on the whole, I am so
impressed by the difficulty of explaining these maps as the product
of voyages of discovery, and the easiness of explaining them as the
product of the imagination working on scientific theories and Marco
Polo narratives, that nothing would induce me to accept Jave la
Grande as the equivalent of Australia save resemblances in detail
of a very undeniable nature.</p>
<p>Now the resemblances that have been pointed out do not seem to
me to be very convincing.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Compare outline of Rotz's map with outline of
map of Australia. See <a href="#il-33">Illustration 33.</a>]</p>
<p>(1) The outline of the North coast of Jave la Grande is
exceedingly <i>un</i>like the outline of the North coast of
Australia. What does "Sumbava" stand for in terms of Australian
geography? Mr. Major apparently thinks that the Portuguese confused
it with Arnhem's land, and that the Eastern coast of Sumbava
therefore is the Western coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. But, in
that case, where is Cape York Peninsula? Mr. Major suggests that
Cape York Peninsula may have been "altogether unvisited and
ignored." That is to say, Portuguese seamen knew the Western and
Southern coasts of the Gulf and they also knew the coast of
Queensland South of Halifax Bay; but they had no knowledge of the
coast between these separate discoveries, which the map-maker
therefore connected by an imaginary line decorated with rivers and
capes and names. This theory seems to me to be incredible. If one
large part of the coast-line is admitted to be imaginary, the
suspicion that the whole line is imaginary becomes irresistible.
For, as we shall note in a moment, the contour of the East coast
also does not resemble the contour of the East coast of Australia
in any remarkable degree. Moreover, if the ship that discovered the
East coast did not come by way of Cape York, by what way did it
come? Not by the South coast, for no knowledge of a South coast is
pretended. Not by the North of New Guinea, for the map shows no
adequate knowledge of that island.</p>

SUPERIMPOSED.</b></p>
<p>But Mr. Collingridge has a quite different explanation. He
thinks that the Portuguese navigators <i>did</i> visit Cape York,
and that they knew all about it. But he thinks that, when they made
their maps, their wishes were, firstly, to show that Jave la Grande
was on the Portuguese, and not on the Spanish, side of the Pope's
line; and secondly, to make the Spaniards believe that there was no
practicable ocean-way South of Java. They, therefore,
<i>deliberately</i> drew a map which made Sumbava play <i>two</i>
parts: the part of the island of Sumbava, and the part of Cape
York. In this way they dragged the larger part of the continent
Westward into the Portuguese sphere, and at the same time they
dragged it so far Northward that there was only a dubious river
between it and Java, a river which the two men are either digging
out or filling up with their industrious mattocks.</p>
<p>Now, if there were strong resemblances between Jave la Grande
and Australia, Mr. Collingridge's ingenious argument would be
worthy of careful consideration. It is true that the Portuguese
were very jealously on guard against foreigners, and that they were
entirely unscrupulous in the falsification of maps, especially when
they wished to drag valuable properties on to their side of the
Papal line? In 1502, for example, they made a famous map of the
Atlantic in which, with this purpose, they placed Newfoundland
nearer to Ireland than to America.<sup>*</sup> If the Portuguese
discovered Australia, and considered it valuable property, it is
likely enough that their maps would put Australia away to the
West.<sup>**</sup> And if they wished to persuade Spaniards that
Java had no South coast, they would have no scruple in dragging
Australia North as well as West.</p>
<p class="note">[* Fiske's <i>Discovery of America</i>, vol. ii. p.
21.]</p>
<p class="note">[** It would seem to be a point in favour of this
argument that Deslien's map (1566) places Portuguese flags on Jave
la Grande (Collingridge's <i>First Discovery</i>, p. 62).]</p>
<p>But my objection to Mr. Collingridge's argument about the North
coast is, not that there are important differences in the two
outlines, but that there are no important likenesses. Before we
consent to the rather audacious suggestion that Sumbava plays the
part of Cape York, we must at least ask that the rest of the
Northern coast of Jave la Grande be shown to be remarkably like the
Northern coast of Australia. But there seems to be no likeness
anywhere. If Sumbava is Cape York, where is the Gulf of
Carpentaria? There seems no sign of it, unless we are to identify
it with the Straits East of Java, which are extremely <i>un</i>like
the Gulf. Nor is there anything to represent the great bulge of
Arnhem's Land. In short, the likeness of Cape York to Sumbava is
the <i>only</i> likeness in the two North coasts. And, in these
circumstances, there seems strong reason to suppose that, when the
map-maker drew Sumbava in its proper place, and called it Sumbava,
he meant Sumbava and did <i>not</i> mean Cape York.</p>
<p>As for the <i>motive</i> of the Portugese map-maker, it seems to
me that if his aim had been to discourage Spanish voyages, he
would, like so many others, have drawn an <i>empty</i> Pacific
Qcean. The Spaniards knew perfectly well that there <i>was</i> an
ocean passage from Java to the Cape, for Ribero's map showed
Magellan's <i>Victoria</i> sailing along it. These Portuguese maps
would have failed to convince them that that ocean-way had been
closed; while, on the other hand, they might have persuaded them of
the existence of a great Southern Continent, a large part of which,
at any rate, was shown even by the Portuguese to be on the Spanish
side of the line. The thought of the Spanish navigator, as he
looked at these maps, would be&mdash;Let us at once form a colony
at Cape de Fremose! But as a matter of fact there seems no evidence
either that the Spaniards were acquainted with these maps, or that
the Portuguese ever sought to make them acquainted. The probability
seems to be that the maps were made for the use of Portuguese
seamen, and according to the best Portuguese knowledge.</p>
<p>(2) I find it almost equally difficult to see convincing
resemblance in the two East coasts. If we accept Mr. Collingridge's
view that the Northern part of this coast is the Northern part of
the coast of Queensland, how are we to explain the multitudinous
rivers?<sup>*</sup> What, again, are we to say about the remarkable
peninsula which ends in Cape de Fremose? It seems quite unlike
anything on the coast of East Australia, and even Mr. Major calls
it a "manifest blunder and exaggeration." On the other hand, it
seems to be like the most prominent feature on the Eastern coasts
of Africa and South America, and makes one wonder whether the
map-maker was not guessing that the unknown continent of the South
took the shape of the two known continents.</p>
<p class="note">[* Mr. Major points out that "from Cape York all
along the coast of Australia to the 22nd or 23rd degree there is
not even an indication of a river emptying itself into the sea." He
concludes that the coast must be the coast, not of Queensland, but
of the Gulf.]</p>
<p>Moreover, the only map that brings this Eastern coast-line to an
end&mdash;the map by Rotz&mdash;makes it end at 60&deg;, immensely
further to the South than Tasmania, so far South indeed that one
begins to think about the land of which Varthema had heard, where
the days were so short and the cold so extreme. In fact, the
contour of the Eastern coast of Jave la Grande seems so unlike the
contour of the Eastern coast of Australia that it seems useless to
go into detail, and to discuss, for example, whether the "Baye des
herbaiges" is Botany Bay, or whether the "coste dangereuse" is the
coral reef on which the <i>Endeavour</i> was wrecked. But if anyone
still inclines to accept this Eastern coast as authentic, I will
ask him to read again the account which Cook gives in his journal
of the almost insuperable difficulties in the way of a first
explorer of the Queensland coast, and then to consider if it is any
way credible that Portuguese seamen, in the circumstances of the
time, were able to make the continuous discovery of that coast.</p>
<p>(3) The claim that the Western coast of these maps has
resemblances to the Western coast of Australia deserves, I think,
more serious consideration. I should be greatly astonished if it
were proved that Portuguese or Spaniards had knowledge of the
Eastern coast of Australia. But I should not be greatly astonished
if it were proved that the Portuguese had some slight knowledge of
the Western coast. It seems possible, and even probable, that they
would hear news from Malay seamen of coasts to the South of Java.
And it seems possible, though, I think, not probable, that they
might see some part of the Western coast while sailing to or from
the Moluccas. I should not, therefore, be surprised to find in a
Portuguese map some <i>vague</i> outline, like that, for example,
in the Hakluyt map, indicating some <i>vague</i> acquaintance with
this coast. I can enter into this West coast argument without the
hostile prejudice that I feel in respect to claims of discovery on
the East. I should be willingly persuaded to accept the cautious
opinion of Flinders that "the direction given to some parts of the
coast approaches too near to the truth for the whole to have been
marked from conjecture alone."</p>
<p>Now it is certainly curious that while one of these maps, that
by Rotz, makes the Western coastline end at 35&deg;&mdash;exactly where
the Western coastline of Australia ends at Cape
Leeuwin&mdash;another map (the "Dauphin" map) ceases to give detail
at the same point. This looks like knowledge of real geography. But
our suspicions begin to wake when we observe that others of these
maps&mdash;those by Desceliers&mdash;prolong the coastline
Southward and give a very elaborate survey of the "Baye des
Rivieres" in about 43&deg;&mdash;that is eight degrees South of Cape
Leeuwin&mdash;continue to mark rivers at frequent intervals, even
after, at about 50&deg;, the coastline of Jave la Grande has joined the
coastline of the "Austral land not yet <i>wholly</i> (!)
discovered," and, finally draw an "Isle of Giants," with full
geographic detail, away to the West of the coast which we are asked
to believe is the coast of Australia. If one guesses often enough,
it is likely that one guess or other will hit the mark.</p>
<p>The contour of the Western coast does not seem to me to resemble
the contour of the coast of West Australia in a convincing degree.
It is true that the differences are not sufficiently great to
disprove identity. But, as the whole argument depends, in my
opinion, on these resemblances, one must demand that they be very
convincing indeed. Now the distinguishing features of the Western
coast of these maps is the great out-jutting promontory ending in
Cape de Grace, that is partly cut out from the mainland by the
"Baye Bresill" on the North and the "Hame de Cylla" on the South.
There seems to be nothing in the Australian coastline that
corresponds to this great out-jutting promontory. If we proceed to
identify details, Baye Bresill will be King Sound, Cape de Grace
will be North-West Cape, Hame de Cylla will be Swan River. It seems
to me that the mutual relations of the three places on the
Portuguese map do not show the remarkable similarity to the mutual
relations of the three places on the modern map that the argument
demands.</p>
<p>When we look at the geographical features of the coastline
separately it is easy to see certain resemblances in detail. The
estuary of the Rio Grande looks rather like Queen Channel or
Cambridge Gulf. The coastline from Rio Grande to the Baye de
Bresill looks rather like the coastline from Cambridge Gulf to
King's Sound. The Baye de Bresill is nearly in the same Latitude as
King's Sound. One is tempted to guess that flame de Cylla may be
Swan River, and to find Houtman's Abrolhos in the streak of shoals
that appears in the Portuguese map in the same Latitude. And yet,
in spite of these similarities in detail, my mind remains clouded
by a doubt. These map-makers knew too much. If they had been
contented to tell me that they were acquainted with King's Sound
and Houtman's Abrolhos, I should probably have believed them. But
When they go on to say that they are equally well acquainted with a
"Bay of Rivers" eight degrees South of Cape Leeuwin, with an "Isle
of Giants" off the West coast of Australia, and with the harbours
of Tasmania and New Zealand, I begin to think once more that we are
studying these maps in the wrong spirit. In order to do justice to
their merit, we should regard them not as prosaic records of
historical facts, but as brilliant geographical romances, though
the brilliant geographic imagination may possibly have had a fact
or two to work upon. Let us crown their art with laurel; but let us
not do them the injustice of saying that their story is
true.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* These French-Portuguese maps apparently had no
influence on geographic conceptions and plans. The first

<hr class="short">
<p>One main ground of my unbelief in respect to the discovery of
the Eastern coast of Australia before 1542 has been the great
improbability that voyages had been made in this direction. It
seems incredible that Portuguese ships would reach the Eastern
coast either by way of Torres Straits or round the North of New
Guinea. The Dutch never once saw that coast in the whole course of
explorations which extended over a century and a half. And it seems
just as incredible that the Spaniards would discover it by sailing
from Mexico to the Moluccas, or from the Moluccas to Mexico.</p>
<p>We now, however, have to follow the story of a voyage that
might, had it seemed good to the gods, have ended in the discovery
of the Eastern coast, about two hundred years before that coast
actually was discovered by Cook.</p>
<p>It is a story of Spanish chivalry, and it starts from Peru.
Hitherto Spanish enterprise in the Pacific had Started from the
Western ports of the prosperous state which Cortes had founded in
Mexico; and its direction had consequently been Northward of the
Equator on a line making as straight as possible for the Moluccas
or the Philippines. Peru, meanwhile, had been torn to pieces by
incessant and savage civil wars&mdash;the series of
"blood-and-thunder tragedies," as Mr. Fiske aptly calls
them&mdash;which followed the conquests and the crimes of the
Pizarros. At last these things came to an end, and the Peruvian
viceroys were able to consider proposals for further enterprise
towards the unknown West.</p>
<p>We remember that at this time a very influential school of
cosmographers was persuading the world that this unknown West was
mainly occupied by great promontories of the "Austral" or
"Magellanican" continent, which stretched Northward till it
touched, or all but touched, New Guinea. It was natural to suppose
that large parts of this continent would be full of all manner of
riches as indeed Marco Polo had declared was the case. There was
one sort of riches in particular which the successors of Cortes and
Pizarro expected to find everywhere. "It was an age of gold,"
writes Lord Amherst, "and, to the Spaniard, the whole unknown world
was yellow."<sup>*</sup> They believed in an "Eldorado" in the
East, in the valleys of the Orinoco and the Amazon, whither
Peruvian Incas had escaped with much gold. And they believed also
in an Eldorado in the West, to which the Incas had voyaged and
whence they had got much gold. And this Eldorado of the West must
obviously be situated somewhere in the Magellanican continent which
Mercator had drawn on his map.</p>
<p class="note">[* <i>The Voyage of Menda&ntilde;a to the Solomon
Islands</i>, p. iv.]</p>
<p>This was the fervent belief especially of a famous Spanish
knight, Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, who had gone to Peru in 1557. He
was a representative Spanish "Conqueror," "instrument of perhaps
the foulest judicial murder in the whole of the Spanish annals,"
and as brave as he was cruel. He was also a man of independence of
character and of mind; for he got into trouble with the
Inquisition, and was accused of knowing a magic ink which no woman
could resist, and of using magical rings in navigating; for which
crimes he was sentenced to hear Mass in the Cathedral, stripped to
the bare skin. He was, moreover, a reader of books, and had studied
ancient Peruvian history. From this he gathered that a certain Inca
had once made a voyage to the West, had discovered two
islands,<sup>*</sup> and had brought back much gold and silver. The
inevitable conclusion of the student of Mercator was that these
islands were off the coast of the Magellanican continent.</p>
<p class="note">[* Markham suggests these were the Galapagos
Islands (<i>Sarmiento</i>, p. xiii).]</p>
<p>Sarmiento urged the Viceroy, de Castro, to send him in command
of an expedition to search for these islands. His urgency was
increased by the fact that he was threatened with a prosecution for
divination before the Inquisition. In 1567 the Viceroy consented to
send an expedition; but he gave the command to his own nephew
Menda&ntilde;a. Menda&ntilde;a, at this time a young man of about twenty-five,
was a Spaniard of the nobler type humane, self-controlled,
courteous and tactful, yet firm, when firmness was necessary. His
nature was sincerely and fervently religious, and he thought of the
adventure as of a mission for the salvation of the natives of the
unknown continent. The "Pilot" was a famous seaman named Gallego, a
firm believer in the physical theory that a great Southern
continent must of necessity exist. Sarmiento, who sailed as
"Captain" of the ship, claimed that it was the duty of the Pilot to
consult him as "Cosmographer." But the claim was ignored; and it
seems pretty clear that, though the expedition was mainly due to
his urgency, he was given only a subordinate part in its conduct.
It was inevitable, in such circumstances, that he should give much
trouble to those placed in command.</p>
<p>All the most conspicuous leaders&mdash;including Menda&ntilde;a,
Gallego, and Sarmiento&mdash;wrote narratives of the voyage, which
are full, detailed and generally trustworthy. The trouble is that
the writers held different views, and regarded one another with hot
anger; and the historian finds the work of arbitration
difficult.</p>
<p>They sailed from Callao, the port of Lima, on November 19th,
1567. They had two ships, of 250 and 107 tons. On board were one
hundred and fifty men&mdash;sailors, soldiers, miners and four
Franciscan Friars. Their instructions were to sail "for the
discovery of certain islands, and of a terra firma" (i.e.
continent), and to form a settlement. A new province was to be
added to the Empire of Christ and of Spain.</p>
<p>Callao is in about 12&deg; S. Lat., and had they sailed due West,
and sailed far enough, they would have hit the East coast of
Australia near Cape York. Sarmiento's advice was that they should
sail W.S.W. to 23&deg;, and thence apparently set a Westward course,
that would have brought them to Rockhampton in Queenslang. He
declared that it had been intended that Menda&ntilde;a should direct the
navigation on the advice of a council consisting of the Pilots and
himself as Cosmographer. On the other hand Gallego claimed that the
direction of navigation belonged to him as "Pilot"; and, to the hot
indignation of Sarmiento, Menda&ntilde;a acted by the advice, not of the
Cosmographer, but of the Pilot. Now Gallego had been told that the
"rich islands" were in 15&deg; S. Lat., six hundred leagues from Peru.
He steered South-West, and sailed down to 15&frac34;&deg;. S. Lat. Then, in
spite of fierce protest from Sarmiento, he refused to sail further
on this track, and turned due West, thus "missing the discovery,"
writes Sarmiento. Westward he sailed "620 leagues, rather more than
less"&mdash;so things seemed to him&mdash;and then, seeing no sign
of land, he steered West quarter-North, and thereby lost his chance
of discovering the Eastern coast of Australia. Had he continued on
the Westward course he would have arrived at Cooktown two hundred
years before Cook.</p>
<p>Still the days passed. No land was seen nor sign of land, and
the pilots told Gallego that he was the only one whose zeal had not
flagged. He told them "that they need not be disheartened, for
that, with the favour of God, they should see land by the end of
January, whereupon they all held their peace and said nothing."
Apparently he was aiming at New Guinea. On the 15th of January they
passed an island in the Ellice Group, which they named the ISland
of Jesus. But Gallego feared the "great currents," and would not
allow his weary and angry men to land, assuring them it was a tiny
island, and that he would "give them more land than they could
people." On the 7th of February, eighty days after leaving Callao,
Gallego ordered a Sailor to "climb to the main-top and look towards
the South for land," for he thought he saw something very high. The
sailor reported land, and soon it was visible to all, and
"everybody received the news with great joy and gratitude for the
Grace that God had vouchsafed to us, through the intercession of
the Virgin of Good Fortune, the Glorious Mother of God, whom we all
worshipped, and whom we all praised, singing the 'Te Deum
Laudamus.'"</p>
<p>"The land," writes Menda&ntilde;a, "was so large and high, that we
thought it must be a continent."<sup>*</sup> At ten o'clock in the
morning they observed "a resplendent star"&mdash;"a real star,
though it was broad day"&mdash;and, "firmly persuaded that our Lord
favoured us, through the intercession of His Divine Mother and the
three Magi," who had "sent the star to show us the passage," they
named the harbour "Bahia de la Estrella." They landed, and erected
a cross; the Franciscans chanted "the hymn <i>Vexilla Regis
prodeunt</i>"; and they took possession of the "continent" for
Christ and for Spain.</p>
<p class="note">[* "The same island, which we believed to be a
continent" (Gallego, p. 17).]</p>
<p>Menda&ntilde;a called the island Santa Ysabel, "because we had sailed
from the kingdom of Peru upon the feast of Santa Ysabel, and also
because she had been our patroness throughout the voyage." At a
spot that can still be exactly identified&mdash;a photograph of it
is given in the admirable modern edition of these
narratives&mdash;they built a brigantine for the exploration of the
islands; for islands they were, though no doubt very near to the
mighty continent that they sought. In this brigantine they crept
along the island coasts, by routes which can be exactly traced on
the modern map, and saw scenes which the modern photographer can
exactly pourtray. "They brought back to Peru an account of their
discoveries so accurate and detailed that it is possible 333 years
afterwards to identify every harbour and islet and creek."</p>
<p>They found no continent, but everywhere they saw more land. "To
the West," says Sarmiento, "there is an archipelago of innumerable
islands, and towards the South one sees a great stretch of
land"&mdash;it was New Georgia. "The natives," says Gallego,
"pointed to the South East, and said there lay much land, and we
saw it, but not having any time we did not go back to look at it."
Some of the Spaniards sailing the long coast of the island
Guadalcanal, and seeing no end of it, seem to have thought it "part
of that continent which stretcheth to the Straits of
Magellan,"<sup>*</sup> while others imagined it was part of New
Guinea.<sup>**</sup> If the men in the brigantine had not
discovered a "continent," they had at least discovered "an extent
of land that seemed to have no limit."<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Lopez Vaz in Hakluyt.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Arias, p. 17.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** "All the extent of land which seemed to have
no limit, lay to the West and South-East" (Gallego, p. 61).]</p>
<p>Everywhere natives were met, and earnest endeavours were made at
once to get food from them, and "to lead them as labourers into the
vineyard of our Lord." Sarmiento was sent at head of a party of men
to explore the island of Ysabel, and he reached a point which has
never been reached even in our own time. The instructions of the
Franciscans, strongly backed by Menda&ntilde;a, were that he should treat
the natives with humanity, and should lead them with tenderness
into the way of salvation. It would have been a task impossible to
a missionary far more fervent than Sarmiento. The natives, then as
now, were head-hunting cannibals, and incurably treacherous. If
they were friendly, they would offer you the quarter of a boy with
some taru roots; and if, after burying the boy, you accepted their
friendship, in a few minutes they would be cutting you into pieces
and sucking your brains. Sarmiento met barbarism by Spanish
cruelty, and even the humane Menda&ntilde;a was forced to sanction the use
of arms.</p>
<p>As a Franciscan mission the enterprise was a failure. But there
remained the question of gold. The soldiers, seeing everything
yellow, noted the heavy iron-stone clubs of the natives, and
insisted that they were heavy by weight of gold; and they refused
to give up the pleasant belief even when the clubs were broken in
pieces, and no gold was to be seen. The leaders themselves were
inclined to be hopeful, though some doubted. Sarmiento, the
optimist, says that he actually "saw a mineral containing gold."
The miners reported that there was gold in the soil, but they could
not get it owing to the hostility of the natives. Menda&ntilde;a says that
the natives talked much of gold and pearls, but none were actually
handled; also of cloves, ginger and nutmegs, but "they brought only
a little ginger."</p>

<p>For six months the Spaniards sailed among the islands. Then, on
the 7th of August, a "Parliament" was held. Fifty-eight men were
present, and they were invited to express opinions as to three
alternative proposals. Should they make a settlement? Should they
explore further? Or, should they sail for home?</p>
<p>Menda&ntilde;a's instructions had been to make a settlement in a good
land; and the soldiers, looking at the golden war-clubs, said that
the land was good enough for them. Sarmiento was of the same mind,

advice.</p>
<p>The Friars wished that they should Sail Westward, thinking
perhaps of mission work in New Guinea or the Philippines. But the
Pilots reported that the ships were worm-eaten and worn out, and
that it was necessary to sail for home at once. The majority
accepted this view, and so did Menda&ntilde;a. The plan of a settlement in
the Solomons was abandoned; and thereby, likely enough, the
discovery of the East coast of Australia was postponed for two
hundred years.</p>

<p>On the 11th of August, 1568, they sailed, not for Peru, but for
Mexico. Sarmiento once more protested. He urged that they should
sail for Peru on a South-East course, and on the way make a search
for the continent and islands, which they had missed on their
outward voyage, and which would be found "opposite Chili." Menda&ntilde;a
also seems to have wished to take this course. But the Pilots
declared that adverse winds made it impossible; a professional
opinion that was afterwards severely criticised by Quiros, who
declares that the winds on the South are as favourable as those on
the North.</p>
<p>They sailed, then, for Mexico on a North-East course. They
passed the Marshall Group, where they found a chisel made from an
iron nail, a curious relic of some untold story of Spanish
shipwreck. They met with tremendous storms, and were in the
extremity of suffering and peril, for their ships were built for
the easy sailing of the Peruvian coast. The men talked of mutiny,
and of sailing for the Philippines; and Menda&ntilde;a with difficulty
dissuaded them from a plan which, at that season of the year, meant
inevitable disaster. At length, on December 19th, after a voyage of
four months, they saw the coast of California. In a Mexican harbour
they were amazed to find that their arrival caused dismay, "for it
had not been certified that we were not Lutherans"&mdash;a strange
saying, which was explained when, in another harbour, the people
fled away believing that they were "the strange Scottish people"
who, under John Hawkins, had troubled them two years before.
Finally, in July 1569, they returned to Callao, all that were left
of them, one hundred of the one hundred and fifty who had
sailed.</p>
<p>In Spain the voyage was regarded as a failure. The official
report declared that the islands, that had been discovered, were of
"little importance. They found no specimens of spices, nor of gold
and silver, nor of merchandise, nor of any other source of profit,
and all the people were naked savages." The discovery, however, did
not seem wholly without value. "The advantages that might be
derived from exploring these islands would be to make slaves of the
people, and to found a settlement in some part of one of them,
where provisions could be collected for the discovery of the
mainland, where it is reported there is gold and silver and people
clothed." The islands, that is, might be useful as a base for
voyages in search of the continent that must be near at hand. There
was still a chance that Spaniards might discover Eastern
Australia.</p>
<p>And yet, in spite of the official Statement that there was no
evidence of gold in the newly discovered islands, they somehow got
identified with the land of Ophir, the land of fabulous richness,
whence the ships of Solomon had brought gold to Jerusalem. "The
discoverers," says Lopez Vaz, who wrote twenty years later, "named
them Solomon, to the end that Spaniards, supposing them to be those
isles whence Solomon fetched gold to adorn the Temple at Jerusalem,
might be more desirous to go and inherit the same." But, in their
original narratives, the discoverers did not name them Solomon, and
made no suggestion that they were the Land of Ophir. Sarmiento, who
wrote later than the others, was the only discoverer who used the
name; and he used it only in the title of his book:&mdash;"The
Western Islands in the South Ocean, commonly called the Isles of
Solomon." Our modern editor finds the explanation in the
tavern-talk of the soldiers about the golden war-clubs of the
natives, and about the soil that showed colour when you scratched
it. In twenty years the story had grown that the Spaniards had
brought back with them forty thousand pesos of gold&mdash;beside
"great store of cloves and ginger"&mdash;from a land from which
they had, in fact, brought back not a Single ounce.</p>

1595</h2>

<hr class="short">
<p>Menda&ntilde;a had handled no gold in the Solomons. But he had seen
lands that were large and rich, and doubtless close to "the
mainland, where it is reported there is gold and silver and people
clothed." There seemed good chance of reigning over a second Peru.
In 1574 he obtained a Royal Decree giving him authority to make a
permanent colony, which he and his family should rule for two
generations. Such decrees, were obtained at Madrid with some ease.
But they were not always obeyed in Peru. The new Viceroy was an
enemy to Menda&ntilde;a and his enterprise. In 1577 he was arrested, and
we have no news of him for the next eighteen years.</p>
<p>It seems likely that personal disfavour was not the only reason.
During those eighteen years things were happening in the Pacific
that had great influence on Spanish minds. When Menda&ntilde;a had reached
Mexico in March 1569 his ships had been mistaken for those of "the
strange Scottish people" who, under Sir John Hawkins, had "troubled
them two years before." Why men of Devon were turned by Spanish
imagination into "strange Scottish folk" we know not. But those who
have read the story of the exploits of Hawkins and his men at S.
John de. Ulua will understand the strength of Spanish fears that
the South Sea, as well as the North Sea, was to be the prey of
strange seamen.</p>
<p>The fear was well-founded; but the leader was to be, not John
Hawkins, but Francis Drake. It was in 1572 that Drake, Eternal
English Boy, climbed the "goodly and great tree," whence he could
"see at once the two seas, which he had so longed for"; and, having
"seen that sea of which he had heard such golden reports, he
besought Almighty God of His goodness to give him life and leave to
sail once in an English ship on that sea." And in 1578, "his mind
pricked on continually night and day to perform his vow," he
pierced once more the long-abandoned strait which Magellan had
discovered fifty years before. At the Western end "God by a
contrary wind and intolerable tempest seemed to set Himself against
us." The ships were seized by a North-West storm, the like of which
"no traveller hath felt, neither hath there ever been seen such a
tempest, that any records make mention of, so vigilant and of such
continuance, since Noah's flood, for it lasted from September 7th
to October 28th, full 52 days." On second thought, God's intention
was not "to set Himself against us," but to force us to make a
highly important geographical discovery&mdash;to bring us to "the
uttermost part of the land towards the South Pole." They discovered
that the Mercatorian maps were wrong; that Tierra del Fuego was not
part of a great South Continent, but the head of a group of
islands, ending in a Cape where "the Atlantic Ocean and the South
Sea meet in a most large and free scope." Chaplain Fletcher drew a
map of the islands, and wrote across them, with evident criticism
of Mercator's phrase, "Terra Australis, <i>nunc bene cognita</i>."
Drake showed his joy in characteristic boyish way; "seeking out the
most Southerly part of the island, he cast himself down upon the
uttermost point <i>grovelling</i>, and so reached his body <i>over
it</i>." Then he told his people "that he had been upon the
Southernmost known land in the world, and yet further to the
Southward upon it than any of them, yea, or any man as yet
known."</p>
<p>He had, in short, made the maps of Mercator and Ortelius wholly
out of date. He had proved that there was good Ocean way round what
his chaplain calls Elizabeth's Island. The Spaniards did not like
the news, and Ortelius, their map-maker, in his new edition of
1587, again drew Tierra del Fuego as tip of a great Southern
Continent blocking all ways, save the Straits of Magellan, to the
Pacific. But the English map, published by Hakluyt in 1598, removed
all land South of Queen's Island. Dutch maps also showed open way
South of Tierra del Fuego, and in 1616 Dutch seamen proved the
correctness of Drake's interpretation, by sailing round the island.
Unhappily they named "the Southernmost known land in the World,"
over which he had grovelled, not Cape Drake, but Cape Horn.</p>
<p>Then Drake sailed North up the coast of Peru, and in the harbour
of Valparaiso he met the very ship in which, twelve years before,
Don Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa had sailed in the expedition which
had discovered the Solomons. The Spaniards fetched a bottle of wine
to entertain their supposed friends, and beat welcome with their
drums. But soon Tom Moone, carpenter, was over the side laying
about him, and shouting "Abaxo perro"&mdash;"Below, dog."
Northwards the English sailed, sacking towns, plundering churches,
rifling the richest treasure-ships, with the good-humoured
insolence of God's servants whom "His Majesty is pleased to
refresh." Drake's plan had been to return by way of some passage to
be discovered in the North. But, baffled by cold and "most vile,
thick and stinking fogs," he sheltered in a bay of California, took
possession of the land by the name of "New Albion," and then,
helped by captured Spanish Pilots and Charts, set sail in the
Spanish route for the Philippines.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight days he sailed without sight of land, touched at the
Pelew Group, and so came to the Philippines, and then to the
Moluccas. Here, so at least Englishmen declared, he made a treaty
with the King of Ternate which gave England a monopoly of the spice
trade. And, golden as were the spoils of Spanish America, still
more golden seemed the hopes of the Eastern World of Spices.</p>
<p>"Whether," writes Mr. Corbet, "this treaty was actually
concluded is not stated, but this visit was aftenvards regarded as
the great result of Drake's voyage. It was a picture of his
reception at Ternate that the Queen had engraved on the cup she
gave him in honour of his achievement, and the alleged treaty
became a sheet-anchor of our Eastern diplomacy for nearly a century
afterwards. "Thence Drake groped his way among the islands to Java,
where he put in "at some port on the South coast"&mdash;a fact
curious to those who have noted the apparent ignorance, at this
time, of the South coast,<sup>*</sup>&mdash;and "found great
courtesy," for four of the five kings who governed the island were
"a-shipboard at once." Thence he sailed home by the Portugal route
round the Cape, having touched with bare point the Spanish shield,
and challenged to mortal combat for the Pacific.</p>
<p class="note">[* The map of Hondius, however, which marks his
track, shows his port on the South coast (Hakluyt, vol. ii. p.
336).]</p>
<p>In 1586 Thomas Cavendish sailed in the same track, and on the
same business. Off the Cape of St. Lucar, on the West side of the
point of California, he caught "the Admiral of the South Sea,
called the Sta. Anna, and, after a valiant fight with the whole
noise of trumpets," he forced the Spaniards to "parl for mercy,
desiring our General to save their lives and to take their goods.
So the General of his great mercy and humanity promised their
lives, and good usage." And he took 122,000 pesos of gold, and the
rest of the riches that the ship was laden with, silks, satins,
damasks, with musks, and divers other merchandise; good samples of
the great Asiatic trade of Spain. And he also took men born in
Japan and in the Philippines, a Portugal skilled in the navigation
of China and Japan, and a Spaniard who was a very good pilot for
the trade route to the Philippines. And with their help he sailed
to these islands, where he met with good reception. He Summoned the
chiefs of one island to appear before him, and "made himself and
his company known unto them, that they were Englishmen and enemies
of the Spaniards; and thereupon spread his ensign and sounded up
the drums, which they much marvelled at; to conclude, they promised
both themselves and all the islands thereabouts to aid him,
whenever he should come again to overcome the Spaniards."</p>
<p>At Manila he sent a message to the Spanish captain, willing him
to provide good store of gold for which he would call with a bigger
boat within a few years. His narrative exalts the reputation of
these lands of spices. "The stateliness and richness of which
country I fear to make report of, lest I should not be credited;
for, if I had not known sufficiently the incomparable wealth of
that country, I should have been as incredulous thereof as others
will be that have not had the like experiences." Thence he sailed
along the islands of the Moluccos, well entreated by the heathen
people, confident that "our countrymen may have trade as freely as
the Portugals, if they will themselves." In Java he came to anchor
"under the South-West part,"<sup>*</sup> and here he met friendly
Portugals buying "negroes, cloves, pepper, sugar and many other
commodities." They were supporters of Don Antonio, the Prince who,
with Elizabeth's assistance, was still fighting in favour of
Portuguese independence against the Spanish conquest; and they
declared that if King Don Antonio would come with them, they would
warrant him to have all the Moluccos, besides China and the
Philippines. Then the English sailed "that great and vast sea
between the isle of Java, and the main of Africa," using Portuguese
sea-charts and finding that they over-estimated the route. Nearing
home they met a Flemish hulk which "came from Lisbon, and declared
unto us the overthrow of the Spanish fleet, to the singular
rejoicings and comfort of us all."</p>
<p class="note">[* See map by Hondius in Hakluyt, vol. ii. p.
336.]</p>
<p>And Cavendish hoped that his own voyage would lead to the
gathering of the richest fruits of victory. "As it hath pleased God
to give her Majesty the victory over part of her enemies, so I
trust ere long to see her overthrow them all. For the places of
their wealth, whereby they have maintained or made their wars are
now perfectly discovered; and, if it please her Majesty, with a
very small power she may take the spoil of them all. I have either
discovered, or brought certain intelligence of, all the rich places
of the world that ever were known or discovered by a
Christian."</p>
<p>These things were known to the Spaniards of Peru who listened to
Menda&ntilde;a's petition that he should be sent to found a colony in the
Solomons. Drake and Cavendish had changed the point of view.
"When," says a contemporary, "they thought to send colonies unto
these islands, Captain Drake entered the South Sea, whereupon
commandment was given that they should not be inhabited, that the
English or others who pass the Straits of Magellan to go to the
Moluccas might have no succour there but such as they got of the
Indians."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Lopez Vaz in Hakluyt.]</p>
<p>But Menda&ntilde;a did not despair. He still held the Royal Decree. He
still hoped to reign over a second Peru, which should be truly a
Kingdom of Christ. The stories of Solomon's gold grew ever more
splendid. The best men and the worst men were eager to go. And at
last, in 1595, twenty-eight years after the first voyage, Menda&ntilde;a
was despatched by a friendly Viceroy, Mendoza, Marquis of
Ca&ntilde;ete.</p>
<p>But the interesting person in this Story is the man whom Menda&ntilde;a
now "persuaded and induced" to sail with him as Chief Pilot. Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros was born in 1565. He was by birth a Portuguese;
but when in 1580 Philip II. of Spain made himself King also of
Portugal, Quiros became a Spanish subject, and his life was spent
in the service of the Spanish King. We have no knowledge of his
early years; but his reputation proves that he spent them on the
sea, and that he acquired the kkill of a first-rate "Pilot," that
is, one whose profession it was to know all that was known about
the various sciences necessary for the navigation of the Ocean. In
1595, at the age of thirty, he was in Peru, and Menda&ntilde;a persuaded
him&mdash;"throwing his arm round his neck"&mdash;to act as Chief
Pilot.</p>
<p>The narratives both of the expedition of 1595, in which Quiros
sailed as Chief Pilot, and of the later expedition of 1606, in
which he held the command, profess to have been written by Quiros
himself. There is evidence that he was helped in the writing by one
who accompanied him on the voyage of 1606 as "Secretary," Luis de
Belmonte Bermudez. Bermudez afterwards became a poet of some fame,
and there are passages in the narratives that are evidently written
not by the seaman but by the poet. In the narrative of the later
voyage we hear, sometimes Very distinctly, two voices, that of the
leader and that of the intimate friend at once sympathetic and
critical. But the substance of the narrative expressed the mind of
Quiros himself. And, though he made free use of the literary gift
of his young friend, he adopted the whole narrative as his own, and
read parts of it to an influential minister of the Spanish Court as
his own official report.</p>
<p>They sailed from Callao on the 9th of April, 1595. There were
four ships: the <i>Capitana</i>, or Captain's ship, <i>San
Jeronimo</i>, in which sailed Menda&ntilde;a and Quiros; the
<i>Almirante</i>, or Admiral's ship&mdash;for Admiral was then the
title of the Second in command&mdash;named <i>Santa Isabel</i>,
under Admiral Lope de Vega; a "galeot," and a frigate. In all there
sailed three hundred and seventy-eight persons, of whom two hundred
and eighty were able to bear arms. As a permanent colony was to be
founded, "a good company of married people" were taken; and, says
Quiros, "scarcely a day passes without someone wishing to be
married next day. It seemed as if all would run in couples." There
were high hopes and good stories, but "none for the good of the
natives." For the expedition was ruined ere it started. The ideal
was noble, but the instruments were unworthy. Menda&ntilde;a was humane
and devout. Quiros was aflame with passionate missionary fervour.
But their men were Spaniards of the low type&mdash;greedy, cruel,
brutal. "They behave like Corsairs," said Quiros, before the ship
had left Spanish waters. They were sailing to King Solomon's mines,
and their only thoughts were of "gold, silver and pearls." Menda&ntilde;a
from the first feared desertion. He told Quiros to make charts for
the navigation. He was to show the coast of Peru, and six thousand
miles to the West of Lima. The Solomons he said, were at the
furthest five thousand eight hundred miles away. Two hundred more
miles might be allowed as margin, but "no more land was to be
delineated lest some ship steer to or desert to it."</p>
<p>On the 21st of July they came to certain islands.
Menda&ntilde;a&mdash;so vague was the reckoning of longitudes&mdash;was
joyfully confident that he had already reached the Solomons. He was
in fact little more than half way. Finding that the islands were "a
new discovery," he called them after the friendly Viceroy, Las
Marquesas de Mendoza. To-day we think of the Marquesas chiefly by
reason of R. L. Stevenson's sad stories of the miseries of their
people.<sup>*</sup> Quiros received a very different impression.
There was "much reason," he wrote, "to praise God who created
them." He tells of women "prettier than the ladies of Lima, who are
famed for beauty," and of a boy "with countenance like that of an
angel, I never in my life felt such pain as when I thought that so
fair a creature should be left to go to perdition."</p>
<p class="note">[* <i>In the South Seas</i>, ch. 5.]</p>
<p>The Mass was said, and the natives were taught to make the sign
of the cross, and to say "Jesus Mary" and the rest. They did so
"with great amusement" and thorough good will. But they were "great
thieves," and the soldiers began to shoot them. One, who had
wantonly shot down a man and child together, explained that he had
done so lest "he should lose his reputation as a good marksman."
Quiros asked how it would serve him to enter into Hell with the
fame of being a good shot! A friend of Quiros pointed his gun at
the natives. Quiros took the gun out of his hands, and "asked him
what he was going to do with so much diligence?" "He replied that
his diligence was to kill because he liked to kill." "It is a foul
and sinful thing," said Quiros, "to murder a body which contains a
soul."</p>
<p>The Marquesas were not the Solomons, and the ships sailed on.
The soldiers grew mutinous as Menda&ntilde;a's promise that land would be
soon sighted remained unfulfilled. They began to "form both public
and private assemblies, to murmur and to talk." They had already
sailed beyond the distances given by Menda&ntilde;a, and the sailors knew
it, and blamed the innocent Pilot as well as the Adelantado
(Governor). "The Isles of Solomon," said some, "had fled away, or
the Adelantado had forgotten where they were! To call himself a
Marquis, and to advance his relatives, he had taken them, with four
hundred pounds of biscuits, to perish, to go to the bottom, and to
fish there for the wonderful pearls! We shall go on to Great
Tartary! No one knows where we are!" And Quiros knew that they were
right. A prodigious mistake had been made by Menda&ntilde;a and Gallego in
their calculations. The Solomons were, in fact, two thousand miles
further away from Callao than they had thought.<sup>*</sup> It
would not be right, Quiros explains, to blame a Pilot of the high
character and great skill of Gallego. Such mistakes are inevitable.
"Longitude is not fixed except by such estimation as each one may
make, and in this there may be very great error."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "The discoverers themselves estimated the
distance at seventeen hundred leagues (six thousand eight hundred
miles) which is nearly two thousand miles short of the actual
distance." <i>Discovery of the Solomons</i>, ed. Amherst, p.
lxxii.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Amherst (p. lxxii) quotes Pigafetta's
statement:&mdash;"Pilots now-a-days are satisfied with knowing the
latitude, and are so presumptuous that they refuse to hear the
mention of longitude."]</p>
<p>At length, on the 7th of September, they saw a lovely island.
That same night the <i>Almirante</i>, under the Admiral Lope de
Vega, vanished, and was never seen again. Quiros writes of the
event in the manner of one who could say more than he thinks it
wise to say. "I make no favourable conjecture," he writes. Menda&ntilde;a
suspected that de Vega had deserted him. "All saw that his thoughts
were bitter; he was always apprehensive of the loss of this ship,
for many reasons which might be given."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* It seems probable that the <i>Almirante</i> sank
during the foggy night. It seems unlikely that she deserted, for
she was very short both of water and of fuel. The Admiral had
complained that only nine jars of water were left for 180 persons,
and that it had been found necessary to burn boxes and the upper
work of the ship." He told the General of his necessities, and
begged that they would not part company, and with this promise they
were rejoiced...The Admiral showed much despondency, saying that
the defects of his ship were numerous, but that he was determined
to die with his people, because for that he was come." It is,
however, curious that Menda&ntilde;a, knowing these facts, thought that
the Admiral had deserted him.]</p>
<p>Once more Menda&ntilde;a thought he had rediscovered the Solomons. He
addressed the islanders in the language he had learnt thirty years
before; but they could not understand him. Though Quiros calculated
they had already sailed sixteen hundred miles past the place where
the Solomons were said to be, those islands were in fact still some
distance away to the West. But the island they had come to, though
not one of the Solomons, seemed as good a place as they were likely
to find. "The land was like Andalusia, and for a settlement the
place was as good as agreeable." They called the island Santa Cruz;
and it seemed, for a moment, as if "the spirit and valour of
Spaniards, which could do all, would overcome all difficulties, for
God and King."</p>
<p>But still "the devil was able to work so well with some that
they kept in mind the delights of Lima." Complaints arose, and
"they began to lose love and loyalty." <i>These</i>, they said,
were not the islands the Adelantado had spoken of! "We did not come
here <i>to sow</i>; for that purpose there is plenty of land in
Peru; <i>that</i> is not the way to follow the service of God and
King." "People would only come to take gold, silver, and pearls,
and these are not here!" Quiros tried to chaff them. "They ought to
know how to <i>find</i> cities, vineyards and gardens; to enter a
house ready furnished with the table spread, and to make their
owners give up their property and go into servitude; or they should
know how to <i>find</i> mountains, valleys, and plains of emeralds,
rubies, and diamonds, ready to be loaded and taken away." All the
provinces in the world had their beginnings; Seville, Rome, and
Venice were once forests or bare plains. When the New World was
first discovered, there appeared to be only "a few very small
islands of little or no value." It is the glory of the first
workers that they "make the beginnings."</p>
<p>Quiros argued victoriously, but in vain. The Spaniards were
determined to be gone. They murdered the natives, in order to
induce them to make war, and so compel us to leave the island. At
length they murdered the Chief, who had been our faithful friend.
Quiros protested at great length. To abandon the enterprise would
show us enemies to God and to the King; "For the work we came to
was for the honour of God and the salvation of souls, to rescue
from the Devil those whom he looks upon as so secure." But the
mutineers went back to their old song, that they wanted to go to
Manila. They threatened to kill Quiros for his sermons; and asked
what they should drink in his skull! Quiros replied that all he had
put before them was in the service of God and the King, and he
would sustain it to the death! A friend advised him to "hold his
tongue, for, if not, he would be killed, or left alone on the
island."</p>
<p>At last this tragedy of "the island where Solomon was wanting"
came to an end. Menda&ntilde;a caused the leader of the mutiny to be
stabbed. Then Menda&ntilde;a himself died, and many others, among them the
"Vicar." Only fifteen soldiers remained in health, and they were
lads. Ten determined natives could have killed us all. And the
cause of disaster was also evident. An exploit of Christian
Chivalry had been committed to the hands of a gang of
scoundrels;&mdash;men, said the dying Vicar, "who have not
confessed for three, five, seven, nine, fourteen, and thirty years,
and one who has confessed once in his life." Some of them were
murderers. One did not know whether he was a Christian or a Moor.
The disaster, said the Vicar, was God's punishment of sin. The
mission was abandoned; and the island was "left in the claws of him
who held it before, until God permits others to come forward more
desirous of the welfare of those lost ones, that with a finger they
may show the way to that Salvation for which they were
created."</p>
<p>Menda&ntilde;a was succeeded in command by his widow, who was given the
title of "Governess." She determined to seek San Christobal, one of
the Solomons, their original object, "to see if the
<i>Almirante</i> was there, and to do what might be best for the
service of God and His Majesty." If they failed to find San
Christobal, "her determination was to go to the city of Manila, to
engage priests and people, and return to complete that discovery."
They sailed, then, on the 10th of November in search of San
Christobal. Forty-seven had died in one month, and the survivors
cursed the island they were leaving as "a corner of Hell." They
failed to find San Christobal, and they failed to find the
<i>Almirante</i>. Then they sailed for Manila, avoiding the coast
of New Guinea; though, said Quiros, but for the wretched state of
the ships, I should have given orders to sail along that land, and
find out what it was. They suffered terrible distress. The ships
were rotten. The frigate disappeared one night, and was never more
seen. There was little food, and the little was bad. The water was
full of powdered cockroaches. Men prayed, like Dives in Hell, for a
Single drop of water. The "Governess" refused to allow men to share
in her private stores of wine and oil, and used precious water to
wash her clothes. "You wash your clothes," said Quiros, "with their
life." The "Salve" was recited every afternoon, our only
consolation. Scarcely a day passed without the throwing of one or
two corpses overboard. In a beautiful passage Quiros tells of the
Christian heroism of one Juan Leal, "servant of God," in nursing
the sick. He also died and "went to his reward in heaven."</p>
<p>They passed various islands, and came to the Ladrones; and
"navigating only by information, and without a chart," Quiros
groped for the Philippines. Some said "We shall soon hear Mass, and
seek God! There is no longer danger of death without confessing,
for that is a land where Christians dwell." But there were more
dangers of shipwreck, and once the "Governess" made arrangements
for a pious death, holding the book of devotion in her hand, and
turning her eyes to Heaven. At last they came to Manila, in
February 1596. A native came on board whom the English navigator
Thomas Cavendish had taken with him to point out channels among the
islands. The people of Manila, seeing the ship, fled away; because,
as this was not the time when the ships arrive from New Spain, they
thought the ship was English. For they remembered the ship of
Thomas Cavendish, and the warning of the Governor to act thus. At
last a boat approached with four Spaniards, who seemed to the weary
navigator "like four thousand angels." Soon people crowded to see
the ship which "came from Peru to fetch the Queen of Sheba from the
Isles of Solomon."</p>
<p>At Manila Quiros wrote to de Morga, the Lieutenant-Governor of
the Philippines, a "brief narrative" of the voyage, the object of
which, he says, had been "to go and subject and people the Western
islands of the South Sea." "I beg you," he concluded, "to keep it
secret, for man does not know what time brings; for, looking at it
rightly, it is fit that the first islands should remain concealed
until His Majesty be informed, and order whatever may be most for
his service; for, as they are placed, taking a middle position
between Peru, New Spain, and this country, the English on knowing
it, might settle in them, and do much mischief in this sea."</p>
<p>The voyage, then, had failed even to rediscover the Solomons;
and two hundred years passed before they were again seen by
European eyes. "Though ship after ship set out to seek them, they
were so completely lost to Europeans that, in the course of two
centuries, geographers came to doubt their existence, and they were
actually expunged from the chart. And this, although the group
included eight large islands stretched like a net across the course
of navigation in an almost unbroken line for six hundred
miles."<sup>*</sup> It was not till 1766 that the Englishman
Carteret sailed by them, and he did not recognize them.
Bougaineville did likewise in 1767, and Surville in 1769. It was
not till 1781 that a French scholar proved that the Solomon Islands
had at last been re-discovered.<sup>**</sup> "In the history of
travel there is probably no other instance of the veil being lifted
for a brief moment to afford a glimpse of the life of an isolated
island race, and then dropped again for nigh three centuries,
during which no ripple from the outer world came to disturb the
silent backwater."<sup>***</sup></p>

<p>The reason of the failure to rediscover the Solomons was, as
Quiros pointed out, the impossibility of determining Longitude. In
this case he felt sure Gallego had vastly underestimated the
distance. His own conclusion was that "New Guinea, the Solomoh
Islands, and the islands of Santa Cruz are all near each other,"
and that more than eight thousand miles intervene between Lima and
New Guinea. And, away somewhere to the South, still extended the
great golden populous continent, waiting to be won for God and
King&mdash;unless the heretic English got there first.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>Quiros assumed the mission. He returned to Peru, and asked a new
Viceroy to send him at once to "return and discover those lands
which I suspect to exist, and even feel certain that I shall find,
in those seas." But the Viceroy replied that Quiros must first win
permission from the King of Spain. Quiros arrived in Seville, with
six dollars in pocket, in February 1600. It was Jubilee year at
Rome, and he determined to lay his foundation true by a visit to
the Holy City. Selling the little he possessed, he bought the dress
of a pilgrim, and, staff in hand, walked through the cities of
Italy. At Rome he appealed to the Spanish ambassador, the Duke of
Sesa, to help win the sanction and the blessing of the Pope for a
mission which would "save an infinity of souls in the New World."
The great nobleman treated the pilgrim with respect. He had
received a letter from the Prior of the Order of St. Dominic at
Manila, testifying that Quiros was "a great pilot, with much
experience of the South Sea, and of the great Gulf between the
coasts of New Spain and Peru and Japan and the Philippine Islands,"
and that it "would be much for the service of God and King to
introduce him, that he might again return to discover those unknown
parts and islands."</p>
<p>"So the Duke sent for him to his house to ask him concerning
curious things relating to his art, and entertained him there for
near seventeen months." Further, he called a meeting of the best
pilots and mathematicians to be found in Rome, who examined papers
and charts, and made a report favourable both to the scheme and to
the man. "All were persuaded, by the proofs and reasonings he
submitted to them, that there could not fail to be either a
continental land or a number of islands, from the Straits of
Magellan to New Guinea and Java and the other islands of that great
archipelago." This unknown land in the torrid and temperate zones
must be a very good and rich land, and they were of opinion that it
was "very desirable to lose no time in discovering that Southern
region, unknown till now, which will be a great service to God." Of
Quiros the mathematicians testified "that there are few pilots who
know as much as he does; that he is expert in making globes and
charts for navigating; that he well understands the use of
instruments necessary for navigation"; and they highly commended
two of his inventions. So the Lord Duke arranged an interview with
His Holiness, Clement VIII., who, says Quiros, "heard me very
attentively, saw all the papers I showed him, approved of my zeal
and veracity, encouraged me to persevere in my laudable intentions,
conceded many graces and indulgences for the time when I should
begin the voyage, gave me letters of recommendation to the Majesty
of the King our Lord," and also "some rosaries that had been
blessed, and a piece of the wood of the Cross. About this there was
great difficulty." He urged the King of Spain to assist the intent
of Quiros, even were it only for "the salvation of one single soul"
in "that Austral Incognita part."</p>
<p>Recommended by Lord Duke, by mathematicians and by Pope, Quiros
went to the Spanish court. Here there were many voices. Some, says
Quiros, "thought little of the enterprise, or of me, thinking that
I promised more than I could perform, and that for the performance
of so great a deed a person of more parts and valour was needed."
Others threw doubt on the utility of such conquests, saying that
"sufficient lands had been discovered for His Majesty, and that
what signified was to people and settle them, rather than go in
search of those which I said were new, which were so distant that
they would be difficult and costly to maintain after they had been
conquered and settled." On the other hand were the very weighty
testimonies from Rome, summed up by the Lord Duke, who wrote, says
the King, "giving me a good account of his parts, good judgment,
and experience in his profession," and "assuring me that he is a
worker, quiet, disinterested, of decent life, zealous for the
service of God and for my service." So at length Quiros, after much
importunity, "submitting new Memorials every day," obtained his
heart's desire; and the King wrote an order to the Viceroy of Peru,
that he must provide two very good ships, with sailors good,
useful, and obedient, and with all things necessary for a voyage
which aimed at the discovery of "the Southern islands and lands as
far as New Guinea and Java Major (Java)." The Viceroy was also "to
give orders that some barefoot friars of the Order of St. Francis,
exemplary and of good life, are taken." The voyage of discovery, in
its inmost intention, was to be a Franciscan Mission.</p>
<p>Neither Pope nor King nor Lord Duke thought it necessary to pay
a Pilgrim's passage to Peru; and Quiros, after the usual shipwreck,
arrived at Panama, "so poor" (says he) "that for eight days I had
not one rial, and owing for the hire of mules." He asked the
Governor of Panama for a loan of two hundred dollars, which was
refused so he had to retire to his lodgings, to be sued by the
muleteers and other creditors. He attended a religious ceremony in
the upper storey of the Hospital; and "as the weight of people was
great, a large part of the building gave way, and we fell, sixty of
us, with the beds and patients, a height of more than twenty feet.
A priest was killed; there were many broken limbs; I escaped with
what I got, which was a severe blow on the left side, a wound on
the right ankle, and a hand cut by a nail. My cure cost me four
bleedings, and two months and a half in bed, without possessing a
single maravedi. When barely convalescent I embarked in a ship
bound for Peru, without a bit of bread or a jar of water. I arrived
at Callao on the 6th of March, 1605, with debts for the passage and
food, and with no moneys. I hired horses from one I had known
before, and entered Lima by night. I went round without being able
to find any hostelry, until God led me to a potter who, for that
night and for three other nights, hospitably received me with good
will among his pots; so that I am able to say with good reason that
I arrived at Lima weighted down with very many old labours to make
a beginning of new ones." We begin to perceive that we are in noble
company. We travel with Don Quixote in the sunset of Spain.</p>
<p>At Lima he met with more discouragements. The Viceroy was
lukewarm, and suggested that the expedition had better start from
the Philippines. "I was forced to continue my memorials." "I found
more opposers than helpers." The husband of Menda&ntilde;a's widow argued
that the expedition would "trench on the Solomon Islands." There
were long delays. In vain Quiros urged that "if the day of St.
Francis, September 4th, should pass, the best of the year would be
lost for making sail and shaping a South-West course." Three and a
half months passed after that date before preparations were
completed. He sailed not on the day of St. Francis, but on the day
of St. Thomas, the 21st of December, 1605.</p>
<p>The wish to sail on the day of St. Francis had a significance
beyond the convenience of date. Quiros had planned a ceremony which
should give expression to the Franciscan character of the mission.
A Festival was to be held "in the convent of St. Francis where were
the six Friars who were to go in our ships. The standards and
banners were to be blessed, and we were to come forth with all our
people in procession, in the clothes of sackcloth which almost all
had made for the occasion. But envy put a stop to this laudable
intention, and some even opposed the blessing and raising of the
standard, as if the undertaking was not for the service of His
Majesty! "However all the people confessed, and took the Sacrament.
The standards and banners were embarked, rolled upon their staves;
the six Friars came forth, and were "lovingly embraced by many
people, for at such partings many tears are shed, and we all went
on board together." "Our dresses," says the Pilot de Leza, "were
those of the Franciscans, adopted by the Captain and all his
officers." "The sails were set, and the men on their knees prayed
for a good voyage to Our Lady of Loretto, saying that the fleet is
dedicated to her name, and sails trusting to her favour and
protection."</p>
<p>Quiros commanded three ships, "painted with no little art"; the
holy standards and carvings are described in loving detail. The
<i>Capitana</i>, the ship "well adapted for such service," in which
he sailed as Captain, was named the "St. Peter and St. Paul." The
<i>Almirante</i>, "the rather small ship" in which the Admiral Luis
Vaez de Torres was to sail a very famous voyage, was named the "St.
Peter." The third ship, a <i>Labra</i> or launch, of small size but
strong and a good sailor, was named "The Three Kings": the three
Kings of the Eastern Spice-lands, who had seen the Star and
followed the Gleam. "In the three ships embarked nearly three
hundred men, sailors and soldiers, with some small pieces of
artillery, arquebuses and muskets, provisions of all kinds for one
year, iron implements, fruits and animals of Peru <i>for those who
should form a settlement</i>, and the said six Friars of the Order
of St. Francis, also four Brothers of Juan de Dios to cure the
sick."</p>
<p>The "instructions" which Quiros issued to Torres for the
direction of the voyage express the fervent religious spirit which
animated him, and which he sought to kindle in those joined to him
in a divine mission. Torres is to maintain "Christian, political,
and military discipline." But he is also to "use much diligence in
treating kindly and lovingly all the people under his charge,...to
acquire those methods and habits which are necessary to keep his
people contented and firm in their love, truthfulness and loyalty,
remembering how worthy of esteem that captain is who, without the
use of knife or other rigour, governs his people in peace." He is
"to see that men do not curse nor blaspheme, nor say or do other
things evil against God our Lord, nor against the most Holy Mother,
nor against angels, saints, or things sacred or divine." A
blasphemer is to be punished by forfeit of his day's ration; and,
for the second offence, he may be put in irons and fined for the
benefit of the souls in Purgatory. Every day in the afternoon all
the people are to go on their knees before an altar where are
images of Christ and of the Virgin Mary; and the Litany of Our Lady
of Loretto is to be recited, "praying for her favour or
intercession, that God our Lord may guide us and show us the lands
and people we seek, and help us in all that undertaking on which we
are employed, and grant us that success which will be to His honour
and glory, and for the good of so many of His creatures." If any
playing-cards or dice are found (except for the playing of
backgammon) they are to be thrown overboard. When, at a later date,
Quiros was asked to allow "a little play," on condition that the
winnings were given for the souls in Purgatory, he "said to them
many times that they would not risk to go on with such new and good
work if there was playing and swearing. As for the alms offered
from the result of betting, he would not want to take a soul out of
Purgatory, and set it on the road to Heaven, if it left his and the
Souls of others in Hell; and it would be much better to give
without playing that which would be given by playing. For passing
the time there are very good books, and one who would teach to
read, write, and count to those who do not know how; also a
master-at-arms, black swords (wooden drill-swords), practised
soldiers to teach recruits, and one who would teach them the art of
fortification and artillery, the spheres and navigation; and that
these pursuits were better than to play for money."</p>
<p>The plan was to Strike South-West for the continent, as had been
advised by Sarmiento in 1567. They were to "shape a South-West
course until the Latitude of 30&deg; is reached." If no land was there
found, their course was to be changed to North-West until the
Latitude of 10&deg; 15'. And if again no land was found, they were to
follow that parallel Westward in search of the island of Santa
Cruz. Thence they were to steer South-West as far as 20&deg;, then
North-West to 4&deg;, and on that parallel Westward in search of New
Guinea. After coasting all along that land, they were to proceed to
Manila, and thence by the Eastern Indies to Spain. And Quiros hoped
to find land between Java and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>They are to "avoid the danger of offending the natives, or being
offended by them." Spaniards should be "as fathers to children, but
the children must be watched as if they were known enemies. Our
part is always to be in the right, with open and honest intentions;
then God will help us, as He helps all those whose objects are
good." And Quiros gives very sensible advice as to innocent
thievish natives whose souls have to be saved.</p>
<p>"It is well known to all those persons who are engaged on this
discovery how His Holiness Clement VIII., at my humble petition,
has conceded that if Our Lord should be served by removing us from
this world to another, at the hour of death, if unable to confess
or to take the Sacrament, being contrite, we name the most holy
name of Jesus, either with our mouths or in our hearts, he gives us
plenary indulgence and remission of all our sins."</p>
<p>The voyage, in the Captain's eyes, was a chivalrous missionary
enterprise, demanding the personal sanctification of each man who
had the glory of sharing in it. Every soldier and every sailor was
to be a Knight of the Holy Ghost. In reality, the soldiers and
sailors were all sorts and conditions of men, illustrating once
more the extraordinary contrasts which are the continual surprise
to students of Spanish story. There were the Franciscans under
their "Commissary," an aged Brother of nearly eighty years, who
came to give his life for the cause for which he had lived, and who
died worn out by age and hardship within sight of home. There was
"the well-disposed and soldierly youth," who was so deeply
impressed by the reading of the life of St. Anthony the hermit that
one night he launched a frail raft, and slipped overboard,
"determined to leave us here, to teach the heathen and to live in
solitude,...the act of a man whom we held to be rational and a good
Christian, yet hazardous for many reasons, above all his being cut
off from the divine offices and the sacrament." There was the
Peruvian youth named Francisco, who "wore the habit of a lay
brother, his life being one of self-denial. He was a humble, frugal
and grateful man, very peaceful, and so zealous for the good of the
souls in the new discoveries, that he wished to be left behind with
them." And, in amazing contrast, were those who, after wanton
massacre of natives, would say that "it was of little importance
that we should send them to the devil to-day, as they would have to
go to-morrow," "a sentiment," comments Quiros, "very far from all
reason, and especially when they had the faith of Christ at the
doors of their soul."</p>
<p>The generality was of the stuff with which the great Spanish
captains had to do their heroisms; men of unsurpassable courage,
and of unsurpassable cruelty, willing enough to help Don Quixote to
conquer islands (if he could find them!), pleased by the thought
that they could obtain remission of all sins by naming the name of
Jesus, but determined meanwhile to have a good time in their own
way. They were not the men to pass the day in contented attendance
of religious services, or in study of the three R's. All they
wanted, Quiros found, was "good health, plenty to eat and drink,
little work, much grumbling together, with much fear of the
weather!" Every misadventure made them think of the great abundance
of the court, cold snows, fresh fruits, and other memories which
cooled their will. They were "far from having the valorous minds
which ought to animate the searchers for unknown lands, to uphold
the original motives, and perform heroic deeds." "Like moths they
ate against the enterprise and caused discontent."</p>
<p>Quiros himself was desperately ill. "He took such a headache
from Lima that he could suffer neither sun nor shade. On this
malady came a spasm which caused much suffering, but none of these
changes sufficed to finish him. For whom God wishes will live!"
Sheer physical weakness disabled him from contending with the
riotous discontents of men impatient with every day that passed
without sight of a golden land. The leader of the discontented was
the Chief Pilot, Juan Ochoa de Bilboa, whom Quiros had been
compelled to take against his will:&mdash;"he did much injury."</p>
<p>Quiros was sailing on the South-West course, aiming at latitude
30&deg;, where he hoped to see land. Had he been able to start on the
day of St. Francis (September 4th), he would have reached this
point by the middle of October, and would have had five months of
Southern summer for explorations West, South-West, or
North-West&mdash;explorations that would probably have brought him
to New Zealand or to Australia. But the delay of three and a half
months was fatal. On the 22nd of January, 1606, while still only in
Latitude 26&deg;, they met with "a squall and showers from the
South-East, and with a great swell from the South." The seamen were
alarmed. "Whither," they said, "are they taking us, in this great
Gulf in the winter season?" Provision of water was running short.
Quiros was sick in bed, and word reached him that the Pilot and
other persons in the ship had "mutinous tendencies." Quiros could
make no fight. The ship's course was changed to West-North-West, in
spite of written protest from Torres that "it was not a thing
obvious that we ought to diminish our latitude till we got beyond
30&deg; S."</p>
<p>They now made North-West for the 10th line of Latitude on which
lay Santa Cruz; Quiros himself had carefully "taken the sun" in
that island and was certain that the Latitude was 10&deg; 20'. They
passed several uninhabited islands, and on the 10th of February
came to an island with people on the beach; at last some of the
"millions upon millions of natives" of whom, grumbled the sailors,
Quiros continually talked. He called the island "Conversion de San
Pablo." It has been identified with Anaa or Chain Island, about two
hundred miles East of Tahiti. Some Spaniards swam ashore through
the dangerous surf, and were welcomed "with smiles and kisses."
They found "the place where the Devil spoke to and deceived these
miserable natives," and they "set up a cross, and gave God thanks
on their knees for being the first to hoist His Royal Standard in
an unknown land inhabited by heathens." A chieftain came on board,
and was "saluted three times to the sound of the flute, as a
grandee." Then Quiros "dressed him in a pair of breeches, a shirt
of yellow silk, put a hat upon his head, a tin medal round his
neck, gave him a case of knives, and ordered the boat to take him
ashore."</p>
<p>They struck the 10th degree of Latitude, and made West for Santa
Cruz. On the 1st of March they came to an island which Quiros
called Peregrino, whose people were "the most beautiful, white, and
elegant, that were met with during the voyage." They were, of
course, good-natured thieves, and the inevitable things happened.
Quiros urged humanity, but suspected that his commands were not
obeyed. He ordered Torres to capture four boys, in order that these
at least might be saved from the Devil. Torres tried to do so, but
"Satan, who does not sleep at such important junctures," caused the
natives to resist. Foul deeds followed,&mdash;Torres would not tell
the story. The "beautiful people" must "remain in the wilderness,
until God takes pity upon them."</p>
<p>Still they sailed Westward, day after day, week after week,
searching for Santa Cruz. Their chief trouble was lack of water.
Quiros had a copper instrument to distil sweet water from sea
water, and he got two or three jars full every day, very good and
sweet. But fuel failed, and the allowance of water was reduced to
one quartillo. Quiros took his one quartillo with the rest. But
"the salted food and excessive heat afflicted the people," and they
longed to "quench the terrible thirst they felt in the
water-springs of Santa Cruz." For thirty-two days they sailed on
the same line in search of it. Again came endless disputes about
Longitudes. Everyone calculated how far they had sailed, and the
calculations were enormously different. Quiros said that the
distance to Santa Cruz was seven thousand four hundred miles. The
Pilot retorted that they had already sailed eight thousand eight
hundred. Disputes grew hot. Quiros was told that there was a plot
to stab him and to throw the body overboard. The Pilot shouted to
the Captain of the launch that winter was near, and "other things
that it is not well for the men to hear."</p>
<p>One night the sick Captain heard a great disturbance, and found
the Pilot with blood-stained sword in hand. The sword was taken
from him; "but that which the Captain felt he kept to himself,
confessing that he was so weak that he was unable to say in a loud
voice a third word." It was evident that the Pilot "did not wish
that lands should be discovered, nor that anything should be
found." He was "designing to go directly to Manila." Quiros could
not deal with the plot. But Torres was a very different man, and
insisted that land must be found. Finally he induced Quiros to
arrest the Pilot, and to send him on board Torres' ship, though
that vigorous seaman regrets that he was "not allowed to inflict
due punishment." For the moment, however, Quiros had been persuaded
that something more severe than Franciscan methods were needed. The
Pilot's friends were told to "hold their tongues"; a block was
placed for villains at the yard-arm; and Quiros regretted that he
had not "thought of bringing iron fetters and chains from Lima,
intending to oblige by faithful treatment, and to bring out the
good." But it was in vain that Don Quixote tried to be sane. The
block was never used. Instead of hanging his "villains," he made
them "Knights of the Holy Ghost." His friends would bear witness,
he afterwards said, that he was "determined never to take life or
reputation; and if he had done so, he would have been discontented
and unquiet for all the rest of his life."</p>
<p>They saw "drifts of wood, and snakes, and many birds, all signs
of land on both sides." But they drove straight along the 10th line
to make sure of Santa Cruz. On the 7th of April the mast-head man
cried that he saw "land to the North-West, high and black." Soon
smoke was seen, which "doubled our delight." A port was found, and
they "anchored with incredible joy." But it was not Santa Cruz. It
was the chief island of the Duff Group. The native name was
Taumaco. Quiros called it "Nuestra Sefiora del Socorro in memory of
the succour found there." The Chief, named Taumai, was "a man with
a good-looking body and face, handsome eyes, well formed nose,
colour rather brown, beard and hair turning grey. He was grave and
sedate, prudent and wise in what he did, and what he promised he
performed." "Never was there a barbarian," says one of our writers,
"who possessed the good sense of this one." Quiros dressed him in
shot silk which he seemed to value highly. The Friars landed, and
performed the first Mass of our Lady of Loretto, with a
commemoration of St. Peter. The natives were very attentive on
their knees, "beating their breasts and doing everything they saw
the Christians do." "When they saw that we worshipped the Cross,
they desired to paint the same cross on their breasts, and many did
so. They asked us for ink to do this, and we gave them gunpowder."
"Pity," says Quiros, "to think with what facility all the people of
those lands would receive the Faith if there was any one to teach
them; and yet what a great perdition there is of such a vast number
of souls as are condemned here!"</p>
<p>Taumaco was hot Santa Cruz, but it was near Santa Cruz. That
island, said Taumai, was "five days' voyage to the West," or,
according to Torres, two hundred and forty miles. The natives knew
all the details of the story of the Spanish colony at Santa Cruz,
and for that reason were "alarmed when they saw arquebuses." But
Taumai also gave news that put Santa Cruz out of mind. He spoke of
great lands in the South. "He began counting on his fingers as many
as sixty islands, and a very large land, which he called
Manicolo...To explain which were small islands he made small
circles, and for larger ones larger circles; while for the large
land he opened both his arms and hands without making them meet. To
explain which were the distant islands, and which were nearer, he
pointed to the sun, then rested his head on his hand, shut his eyes
and with his fingers counted the number of nights one had to sleep
on the voyage. In a similar manner he explained which people were
white, black, or mulattos, which were mixed, which friendly, which
hostile. He gave it to be understood that in one island they ate
human flesh by biting his arm, and he indicated that he did not
like such peoples." The natives confirmed these statements, and
said, using "very intelligent signs," that in those great lands
were cows and buffaloes and pearls.</p>
<p>They caught four natives&mdash;"the General rejoiced greatly at
the sight of them"&mdash;and sailed, no longer West, but
South-East. "They now," says Quiros, "had sufficient wood and water
to enable them to find that they were seeking. God had given us a
North-West wind, one well suited for that intention." One after
another, three of the four kidnapped natives leapt overboard, and
swam for land which, in one case, appeared to be three leagues
away! "See how the Devil deceives him," cried the sailors. "Why
lose so much good as surrounds you here?" At 14&deg; the Captain was
asked what the course was to be. "Put the ships' heads where they
like," answered he, "for God will guide them as may be right." "Don
Quixote," wrote Cervantes, "rode calmly on, leaving it to his horse
to go which way he pleased, firmly believing that in this consisted
the very essence of adventure." God's wind drove them South-West,
and next day a sailor of the <i>Capitana</i>, named Francisco
Rodriguez, went to the mast-head, and cried in a cheerful voice
"Very high land ahead!" They called the island San Marcos because
it was discovered on that Saint's Day. Beautiful islands were seen
in all directions. They came to one, which "owing to its great
beauty" they called "Virgen Maria." A man rushed down from some
rocks, jumped into the boat, and seemed to ask by signs, "Where do
you come from? What do you want? What do you seek?" "We come from
the East," a Spaniard replied, "we seek you, and we want you to be
ours."</p>
<p>The questioner and another native were captured; and the
captain, to show his benevolent intentions, ordered the barber to
"shave their beards and hair, had their finger and toe-nails cut
with scissors (the use of which they admired), caused them to be
dressed in silk and divers colours, gave them hats with plumes,
tinsel and other ornaments, knives and a mirror, into which they
looked with caution." Then he sent them ashore to join their
friends, and so excellent was the effect produced that, when "one
of our men asked a mother for her baby, she gave it; and, seeing
that it was passed from one to another to be seen and kissed, the
natives were well pleased." They saw innumerable natives of three
different colours, yellow, black and white which seemed to prove
the extent and length of the island, and that it must be the
mainland.</p>

<b>36. THE NEW HEBRIDES<br>
(From Markham (ed.) <i>Voyage of Quiros</i> (Hakluyt
Society).)</b></p>
<p>Twelve leagues to the South-West and South, a man looking out at
the mast-head saw "an extensive land,&mdash;the eye could not turn
to a point that was not all land" "a great land with high
mountains," says another writer, "which promised to be no less than
continental." At last, it seemed, the Great Continent had been
discovered, and "this day was the most joyful and the most
celebrated day of the whole voyage." Far away to the South-East
again was seen a massive and very lofty chain of mountains whose
tops were covered by thick masses of white cloud. They were in fact
in the midst of the group of mountainous islands, which Cook
rediscovered in 1774, and called the New Hebrides. But the islands
lay so close together that they "appeared to form one land," and to
suggest at least the possibility of a continent.<sup>*</sup> They
determined to sail "in the direction of the first land that bore
South," and on the 1st of May they entered "a great Bay," which
"received the names of St. Philip and St. James, the day of the
discovery being the day of those Apostles." "The Bay," says one
writer, "is very large and beautiful, and all the fleets of the
world might enter it; and, as our General saw its beauty, he wished
that we should enter it and anchor." "All their designs," says
another, "had now been accomplished. They held in their hands the
most abundant and powerful land ever discovered by Spaniards."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X. AUSTRIALIA DEL
ESPIRITU SANTO</h2>
<p>Next day (2nd of May) Torres was sent in the boat to look for a
landing-place. All day he looked, for the Bay was very large and
very deep. At length, at the extreme end of the Bay, six or seven
leagues from the entrance, he found "good anchorage in from forty
to twenty fathoms of very clean sand, a port with a river, ballast
and fuel, and all that we could desire." This was joyful news; "for
without a port the discovery would be of little importance."
Hither, in the course of three days&mdash;so long and so difficult
was the bay&mdash;they slowly worked their way, and came to
anchor.</p>
<p>Of this port of St. Philip and St. James we get ample
information. Here the Spaniards stayed five weeks, and wrote vivid
narratives of their doings. One of them drew a map of the Bay,
which we still have.<sup>*</sup> Captain Cook rediscovered the Bay
in 1774, and wrote an account of its geography that is of singular
use to the student. Moresby visited it in 1876, and made some
interesting remarks. "Doubtless," he wrote, "in time Australia will
throw off settlers to this glorious island, which is capable of
bearing all the spices of the East."<sup>**</sup></p>

<p>To Quiros the situation grew better at every look. The river,
which he named the Jordan, appeared as big as the Guadalquiver at
Seville. He was sure that it must be two hundred and forty miles
long at least, and that it must drain a continent. Moresby
describes it as "a fine rapid torrent, coming from a lofty range of
hills, and running, through the lower part of its course, through
rich open country." In this rich open country appeared the ideal
site for the Mother City of the Southern World. Walking through the
forest, along a clean well-shaded road, they came to a native
village. Round the huts were many fruit trees, surrounded by
intertwined palisades, to keep off the multitudinous pigs. In the
bush were partridges, doves, ducks, parrots, parroquets, herons,
and song-birds, "which in the morning gave us pleasure to hear such
gentle and musical notes." They found also cocoa-nuts, plantains,
oranges, nutmegs, and almonds and above all yams, which are the
chief food. The land yielded so much food that there could not be
more.</p>

Madrid</i>, 1878.)</b></p>
<p>They saw great trees that would furnish very good spars for
yards of large and small ships, and these so near the sea that they
rose to heaven ready for use. In short, "there is scarcely a tree
in all this land that is not of some use." The climate was perfect.
It was so cool at night that blankets were welcome. And in this
earthly paradise there were "no snakes, jiggers, ants, nor
mosquitoes." "I am able to say with good reason," writes Quiros,
"that a land more delightful, healthy, and fertile, a site better
supplied with quarries, timber, clay for tiles, bricks for founding
a great city on the sea, with a port and a good river on a plain,
with level lands near the hills, nor better adapted to raise plants
and all that Europe and the Indies produce, could not be found." It
was a land, he believed, that could easily support two hundred
thousand Spaniards. A big river must mean a big land. And quite
close were seven islands extending eight hundred miles. Here then
should rise the New Jerusalem, "a very great and prosperous city,"
the capital of a continent stretching from the Equator to the Pole,
a link of strength in the golden chain of that Empire on which the
sun never set, and which in the end would bind the whole world in
blessed submission to God and to His Church.</p>
<p>Every prospect pleased, but the men were vile. Their unchanged
descendants are described by Moresby as "black fine athletic men,
woolly-headed, many of them with really pleasing faces, well-armed
with clubs and three-pronged spears, barbed with human bones, which
they throw to a great distance; the women, he adds, are "unsightly
Eves." The great desire of Quiros was to catch the souls of these
people; and to catch their souls, he thought, you must first catch
their bodies, "so as to establish peace and friendship based on the
good work we intended to do for them." And the men who had to catch
them were&mdash;not the sick captain and the Franciscans, who do
singularly little in this story&mdash;but Torres and the Soldiers.
And their methods were primitive. "When," says one writer, simply,
"our people saw so many people on the beach, they began to fire off
some arquebuses, on which the beach was left clear, all flying into
the woods." There followed a fight. A native was shot, his head and
foot were cut off, and his body was hung to a tree, and shown to
other natives; the soldiers, complains Quiros, "pretending that
this cruelty was a means of making peace!" "Such was the end of the
peace which the Captain hoped for, and sought for, as the means of
discovering the grandeur of the land, and all that was contained in
it; such indeed was the intention the Captain had, but it was only
a sound."</p>
<p>The first thing necessary now was to protect the missionaries
against the hostility which they had so wantonly provoked. Quiros
sought to do this, in the Spanish way, by the creation of "a
ministry of War and Finance," and he gives a list of the nineteen
ministers who were to provide for the safety of the colony. On the
13th of May, Torres, transformed from "Admiral" into "Master of the
Camp," was sent on shore "to put up a Church, so that next day Mass
might be said, and possession taken of the land in the name of the
Majesty, divine and human." So they made a Church, the Church of
"Our Lady of Loretto," with trees and branches of plantains, and
they surrounded it with stakes, so that it might serve as a fort in
case of necessity.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Quiros assembled the people of all the ships,
and made to them a triumphant speech. To strengthen their resolves,
to give firmness and hope, which are the qualities needed to
achieve great and famous deeds, he had resolved to give sacramental
expression to the ideal of the mission by incorporating all those
engaged in it into a new chivalrous Order, "the Knights of the Holy
Ghost"; an Order which Pope and King would "confirm, with
advantageous privileges, as long as the World endures." "In the
name of the Most Holy Trinity, in the name of the Roman Pontiff, in
the name of His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain, and my Lord, I
the Captain Don Fernandez de Quiros give to each one of your
mercies this cross of a blue colour, which presently you are to
place on your breasts, being the insignia by which the Knights of
the Order of the Holy Ghost are to be known; the persons in whose
charge, if I should fail, is to be placed the discovery,
pacification, and possession of all these parts which we are
discovering, and may discover in the time to come." Let them know
and esteem the value of the cross; it signified determination to
win much higher honours. Let them bear in mind that what remains in
their power to attain in this very high enterprise is very great,
for it is now known that the enterprise holds a world for its
heaven and its earth. "Pray to God, gentlemen, that it may serve
Him to send us greater lands, and other things...I charge you all
to be, as it were, members of one body."</p>
<p>It seemed to Quiros that his words were "listened to with much
pleasure and accepted with satisfaction." The Franciscans persuaded
all the new-made Knights to confess, in order that, on the next
day, the day of Pentecost, they might earn the Holy Jubilee which
His Holiness had conceded to the expedition. At night all the ships
were illuminated, and sent off rockets and fire-wheels. All the
artillery was fired off; and when the natives heard the noise, and
the echoes resounding over hills and valleys, they raised great
shouts. We sounded drums, rang the bells, had music and dancing;
and the Captain said to all, "Gentlemen, this is the eve of my long
desired day."</p>
<p>Next day, the day of Pentecost (14th May), just before dawn,
Torres the "Camp master" and the other "Ministers" landed with an
armed party, and with the help of the Friars prepared the "booth
made of branches" that was to serve both as Church and as Fort.
Then Quiros landed in state. On his left was carried a cross made
of the orange wood of the country, on his right the royal standard.
The Knights of the Holy Ghost, with cross on breast, were drawn up
in good order on the beach, showing, it seemed to Quiros, sharpened
resolves to finish what they had commenced, and to begin much
greater things! He went down on his knees, saying, "To God alone be
the honour and the glory." Then, putting his hand on the ground, he
kissed it and said: "Oh Land! sought for so long, intended to be
found by so many, and so desired by me!" The six Friars,
bare-footed and kneeling on the beach, received the cross in their
arms, saying with great tenderness: "I adore thee, O Holy Cross,
for the Author of Our life, made flesh, died on thee for me, so
great a sinner, and for the whole human race."</p>
<p>They raised it, and singing the "Lignum," with the people in
procession, they arrived at the door of the Church. There, on a
pedestal which had been placed for the purpose, the Captain planted
our cross, and ordered that the people should come round, and that
the secretary should read, as in a loud voice he did read, the
following documents:&mdash;</p>
<p>Quiros called the heavens and the earth, and the sea with all
its inhabitants, and those who were present, to witness that in
these parts, which up to the present time had been unknown, he
raised and planted in the name of Jesus Christ, son of the Eternal
Father, and of the Holy Virgin Mary, true God and Man, this sign of
the Holy Cross, on which His most holy body was crucified, and on
which He gave His life as a ransom for the whole human race. Then
in the name of the Catholic Church, in the name of "My Father, St.
Francis" and his Order, in the name of John of God and his Order,
and in the name of the Knights of the Holy Ghost, the discoverers,
settlers, defenders and preservers, he took possession of "all the
islands and lands that he had newly discovered, and desired to
discover <i>as far as the South Pole</i>." "I take possession of
this Bay, named the Bay of St. Philip and St. James, and of its
Port named Santa Cruz, and of the site on which is to be founded
the city of New Jerusalem, and of all the lands which I sighted,
and am going to sight, and of all this region of the South as far
as the Pole, which from this time shall be called Austrialia del
Espiritu Santo,<sup>*</sup> with all its dependencies and
belongings."</p>
<p class="note">[* Quiros, vol. i. p. 251.<br>
<br>
The Spanish phrase for the Southern Land was "la tierra
<i>Austral</i>," or "la parte <i>Austral</i> incognita." The name
that would naturally come from this phrase is <i>Australia</i>.
Quiros would have this name in mind for the same obvious reason
that put it into Flinders' mind two hundred years later. Compared
to <i>Terra Australis</i>, wrote Flinders, <i>Australia</i> is
"more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the
other great portions of the earth" (Flinders' <i>Voyage</i>,
Introduction, p. iii). But, of the two original manuscripts, the
more trustworthy reads not <i>Australia</i> but <i>Austrialia</i>.
In the second manuscript the word, says Zaragossa (vol. i. p. 316)
has been "wrongly emended" to Australia; wrongly, because Quiros,
in the Memorial which he addressed to the King of Spain in 1607,
says that he named the land Austrialia" in happy memory of Your
Majesty, whose dynastic name is <i>Austria</i>"&mdash;"cuja felice
memoria de V.M., por el apellido de <i>Austria</i> le di por nombre
la <i>Austrialia</i> del Espiritu Santo, porque en su mismo dia
tom&eacute; la posesion de ella" (Zaragossa, vol. ii. p. 201). In a later
Memorial of 1610 Quiros wrote that the King had ordered him to
discover land "en la parte <i>Austrialia</i> Incognita" (Zaragossa,
vol. ii. p. 217), and explained: "All this, and what more there is,
I have done as a loyal vassal of Your Majesty, and that Your
Majesty, as soon as its grandeur is understood, may add to your
titles that of <i>Austrial del Espiritu Santo</i>, for the greater
glory of the same Lord, who raised me and showed it me and brought
me to the presence of Your Majesty" (Quiros, edited by Markham,
vol. ii. p. 485. Original in Zaragossa, vol. ii. p. 227). It seems
that the ingenious thought came into his mind that, by inserting an
"i" into the middle of Australia, he could indicate that the
new-found-land of the South was also the land of the
<i>Austrian</i> House of Spain, whose name would thus be "blazoned
and spread over the face of the whole world to the Glory of
God."<br>
<br>
It was a name, however, which had little chance of general
acceptance. Even the second of our Spanish manuscripts "wrongly
emends" it to <i>Australia</i>. And it was unthinkable that English
and Dutch should use a word coined to express Spanish claim to the
New World in the South. When Purchas translated Quiros's Memorial
of 1610, he meant to be a faithful translator, for in paragraph 7
he wrote down Quiros's word <i>Austrialia</i>; but in paragraph 1
he had, in carelessness no doubt, written <i>Australia</i>; and
when he wrote the name for himself it was <i>Australia</i>
(Purchas, edition 1625, vol. iv. pp. 1422, 1423, 1432 cf. Watson's
note in <i>Historical Records of Australia</i>, vol. ix. p. 867).
Other translators sometimes wrote <i>Austrialia</i> (e.g. the Latin
edition published in Amsterdam in 1612), but more generally
<i>Australia</i>. See list of titles of English, Dutch and Latin
translations in the Hakluyt Society edition of Quiros, vol. i. pp.
xlvi-xlvii; e.g. "<i>Australia</i> the Unknown," "<i>Australia</i>
Incognita," "cui <i>Australiae</i> nomen est," "vierde deel des
Werelts, ghenaemt <i>Australia</i> incognita." Other editions held
to the old phrase <i>Terra Australis Incognita</i> (e.g. London
edition of 1617) or its equivalent (e.g. <i>La Terra Australle</i>
in Paris edition of 1617). <i>Austrialia</i> had not the smallest
chance of survival. But it is curious that <i>Terra Australis</i>
so long held its own against the rivalry of <i>Australia</i>. See
Watson in <i>Historical Records of Australia</i>, vol. ix. p. 369,
and Scott's <i>Flinders</i>, chapter 30.]</p>
<p>Then all cried with loud voice "Long live the King of Spain, Don
Philip III., our Lord!" There followed more masses, more discharge
of firearms, more rockets and firewheels, and, in the midst of all
this noise, all shouted with almost infinite joy and many times
"Long Live the Faith of Christ." "Then we went to dine under the
shade of great tufted trees near a clear running stream."</p>
<p>The city had received the name of New Jerusalem. The next thing
to do was to provide for its government. The final thing, perhaps,
would be to build it. Having had his siesta, Quiros told his
officers that he would "elect a municipality, and such officers as
are usual in the city that was the capital of a province." So they
elected thirteen magistrates, a Secretary to the muncipality, two
Justices of the Peace, the Chief Constable, the Accountant, the
Treasurer, the Factor, the Registrar of Mines, the Store Keeper
General, and the Overseer. The city of New Jerusalem was now well
equipped with all that a city which was the capital of a province
should possess; only, unfortunately, there was no city, save the
little booth of branches on the beach, that served at once for Fort
and Church; and the province remained to be discovered. However,
the municipal officers formed in order, and, accompanied by the
rest of the people, went to the Church, and the Father Commissary
pointed once more to the upraised cross; but such were the tears he
shed that he could not proceed. Then the Captain returned to his
ship, taking with him the cross, the standard and banners; and,
arriving on board, "he ordered that block on the yard-arm to be
taken down, where it had been placed to punish crimes. For the
Captain could not believe that persons with such an honourable
destiny would do things the punishment of which would be the rope."
Meanwhile a hundred of the Knights remained on shore, marched
inland to some villages, put the natives to flight in great fear,
entered their houses, and "took some very large pigs."</p>
<p>Three days later (17th of May) they had even better success.
They made "a rapid attack on the natives, did great execution," and
captured and brought to the ship three young boys, and twenty very
fat pigs. The regret of the "Knights" was that they had not caught
fewer boys and more pigs. "Thirty pigs," said one in a loud voice,
"would be better eating than three boys." Quiros was shocked, and
"said with much feeling that he would rather have one of those
children than the whole world besides." The man who talked such
nonsense should have given praise to God, Who, in a way so strange
and unthought-of, had saved those three souls, But the parents
wanted their boys back, showing a strong affection that sought,
though in vain, to buy them with any number of fat pigs. Then, in
their rage, they came to destroy the Church, and Quiros had to send
hurriedly an armed party to prevent them. One of the boys besought
that he might be allowed to return to his father. "Silence, child,"
replied the Captain, "you know not what you ask. Greater good
awaits than the sight and the communion of heathen parents." And,
indeed, when the boy died a few months later, he died a baptised
Catholic, saved from the claws of the Devil, assured of eternal
salvation.</p>
<p>The triumph reached its climax in the Festival of Corpus
Christi. The church was bravely decorated with green boughs. "For
an altar-piece there was a painted Christ crucified on a great
cloth, with four candles at the sides and incense-sticks burning."
Outside were triumphal arches, "enlaced with palms and flowers,
while the ground also was strewn with flowers." Under two other
arches were placed two altars with their canopies, and the image of
St. Peter and St. Paul. "The day was clear and serene, and, as the
sun rose over the crowns of the trees, its rays entering through
the branches, the difference in the fruits of each plant was shown
in great profusion. The birds sang and chanted; the leaves and
branches moved gently in the breeze, and the whole place was
agreeable, fresh, shady, with a gentle air moving and the sea
smooth." Three Masses were said, and the festivities began;&mdash;a
very picturesque sword-dance by eleven sailor lads, dressed in red
and green silk, with bells on their feet, who danced with much
dexterity and grace to the sound of a guitar played by a respected
old sailor; then "another dance by eight boys, all dressed like
Indians in shirts and breeches of silk, coloured brown, blue and
gray, with garlands on their heads and white palms in their hands,
singing their canticles to the sound of tambourines and flutes"
then more splendid ceremony with much discharge of firearms; and,
"when the smoke cleared away there were seen among the green
branches so many plumes and feathers and sashes, so many crosses
and so much gold, and so many colours and silken dresses, that many
eyes could not contain what sprang from the heart, and they shed
tears of joy." The poet-secretary, Bermudez, whose pen certainly
wrote this vivid description, exults in the good fortune which has
allowed him to see "the first festival celebrated in honour of the
most high Lord in these strange and unknown lands." "As our force
was small," he writes, "and the natives numerous, it was considered
by some to be an act of great audacity. I say it was a great hit,
and that it was done in full faith." There came into his mind a
verse written by a Spanish poet:</p>
<p>"Behold where hidden are the lands,<br>
Scarce discerned by mortal ken,<br>
Those are regions still unknown,<br>
Never pressed by Christian men.<br>
This will ever be their fate,<br>
Want of knowledge keeps them there,<br>
Wrapt within a fleecy cloud,<br>
Until God Shall lay them bare."</p>
<p>He quotes the lines, and triumphantly "by slight alterations"
adapts them to the present occasion:</p>
<p>"Behold how we have found these lands,<br>
Now clearly seen by mortal ken,<br>
Those are regions now made known,<br>
Pressed by feet of Christian men.<br>
Unknown no longer is their fate,<br>
Now full knowledge points them there,<br>
No longer hid in fleecy clouds<br>
God his secrets now lays bare."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[*Markham's translation, in Hakluyt Society's
edition of Quiros, vol. i. p. 262.]</p>
<p>Such was the vision which Quiros saw that day of the Festival of
Corpus Christi. And then, thus his narrative continues, "he marched
inland to the sound of drums. He saw what he had sown already
sprouting, the farms, houses, fruit orchards; and, having walked a
league, he returned as it was getting late. When he came on board
he said that, as these natives were at war with us, and there was
not a chance on our side, we would leave the port next day to visit
the lands to windward." The city of New Jerusalem must remain the
city of vision, unbuilt by human hands!</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposal to visit the lands seen to the South
was to determine the question whether New Jerusalem was situated oh
the continent itself, or on one of a large group of islands in the
neighbourhood of the continent. There seemed many reasons to
believe that it was part of a continent. The largeness of the River
Jordan seemed to indicate an extensive land. The high mountains, it
was argued, were evidence of the same. They had experience of an
earthquake, and it was thought that earthquakes only happened in
continents. And it seemed to many "who had a look out from the
mast-head that all those lands were joined one to the others." It
was resolved to "coast along the land to windward, that is to
South-East and East-South-East, to make out for certain whether it
was mainland." Quiros hoped that "a near view of the great and high
chain of mountains, would reanimate all his companions; so that, if
he should die, they would remain with the ardour to continue the
work until it was finished." There was delay caused by the eating
of poisonous fishes, the ancestors of those eaten one hundred and
seventy years later by Cook and his men. The dogs, cats, and pigs
that ate the fish all died; but the men by the use of treacle made
marvellous recovery. And on Thursday, the 8th of June, in midst of
the Southern winter, they again sailed South.</p>
<p>They did not sail far. At 3 p.m. the next day, Friday, June the
9th, they met a strong South-East wind, against which they worked
in vain. The Pilots cried from one ship to another, "Where are we
going?" Quiros abandoned his plan and resolved to return to the
port, with the intention he says "of wintering there, building a
strong house, sowing the land, getting a better knowledge of the
season, and building a brigantine to send with the launch, to
discover what was so much desired; it being clear to all that this
was necessary, for the place which seemed so important to the
sight, had as yet yielded but a bad account." The port, which he
had condemned a few days before, on the ground that "there was not
a chance on our side," was to be made a permanent base for future
exploration Southward in midwinter. The sudden total change of plan
is perplexing, and is inadequately explained by anything that is
said in our narratives. We are in fact becoming aware that these
are not telling the whole truth.</p>
<p>The end of the story was that the three ships re-entered the
Bay, that the launch and the <i>Almirante</i> under Torres
succeeded in reaching the anchorage at the head, while the
<i>Capitana</i> under Quiros failed to do so and eventually sailed
for home. We have diverse explanations of this failure. And it will
be best, first, to note the explanation given by the writers on the
<i>Capitana</i>. There is the narrative of Quiros himself, which he
wrote with the help of his secretary Bermudez, who took the
opportunity freely to assert his own opinions. And there is the
narrative of the Pilot de Leza,<sup>*</sup> who had taken the place
of the troublesome Pilot now in the custody of Torres. De Leza is
described by Quiros as "an honest man and a good Pilot." His
journal seems to be a careful and an able piece of work. The writer
professes warm sympathy with the aims of Quiros, and there seems
nothing to suggest suspicion that the profession is insincere.</p>
<p class="note">[* Quiros, ed. Markham, pp. 393-395.]</p>
<p>To get to their anchorage at the head of the Bay, twenty-four
miles from the entrance, they had to battle against a strong South
wind. "All Saturday and Sunday till sunset" (10th and 11th June),
says the Pilot, "we were within the Bay, beating from one side to
the other. Our launch reached the port, but we did not know whether
she anchored or not; for the <i>Capitana</i> and the
<i>Almirante</i> were more than a league and a half away. The
<i>Almirante</i> was half a league to windward of us. From this
tack the two ships made for the anchorage. When we were so near as
to be standing for it, we heard the people of the <i>Almirante</i>
apparently taking in sail and anchoring. This was at about 9 at
night.</p>
<p>"We began to sound, to find whether there was bottom for us to
anchor, but could find none. It was dark, and there is no anchorage
in all that bay, except in that one corner. At this time such a
strong gust came from the South, off the land, that undoubtedly we
should have come to grief if we had persisted. We could get no
soundings, but we saw that there were lights near the beach, apart
from each other, and that they must be our vessels. We were under
small sail, and the wind kept increasing in violence, so that we
were only able to show a fore course to it. The general and
officers then decided that we should tack, and then stand for the
middle of the bay, as we were near a rock; and, even if we had been
closer, we should not have got soundings. All these ships built in
Peru are bad under little sail. A man aloft said he had seen the
<i>Almirante</i> anchored to windward of us, but we could never
make up the distance.</p>
<p>"Every time we tacked we went away to leeward, the wind blowing
fresh. For this reason it was resolved by the same persons that we
should run before it, only under a spritsail, striking the topmasts
that we might find shelter from the point to windward; and so it
was done. At dawn (June 12th) we were about four leagues out at
sea, outside the Bay. All night we had the lanterns burning, that
the other ships might follow us; but they did not do so. We stood
off and on, and at the mouth of the Bay, in sight of the port, the
weather continuing the same, without the other ships joining
company, and always with the topmasts struck; and in this way we
remained three days, till we found ourselves nine leagues to
leeward of the Cape...We worked from the 13th to the 19th, striving
if the wind would let us get into the Bay; but by no means could we
succeed, for the weather not only remained the same, but got worse.
On the 20th, seeing that the weather did not improve, the General,
with the concurrence of the crew, decided, if the wind permitted
us, to go as far as 10&deg; 20' S. to make for Santa Cruz where we
might wait for our consorts, and get in necessary
supplies."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Quiros, el. Markham, vol. ii. pp. 394-5.]</p>
<p>Such is the Pilot's story. Owing to a series of misadventures of
a purely nautical character, the <i>Capitana</i>, in sight of port,
and so near to it that those on board could hear the people of the
<i>Almirante</i> taking in sail and anchoring, was blown away from
it, blown into the middle of the Harbour, blown out of the Harbour
altogether, blown out to sea, and, after spending eight days trying
to regain the Harbour, had to give it up, and sailed away for the
appointed rendezvous at Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>There seems nothing suspicious about the story. One hundred and
seventy years later Cook found himself in similar difficulties in
the same place. The Bay, he says, is of unfathomable depth except
near the shores. He found three fathoms' depth close to the beach,
yet fifty or fifty-five two cables away. Two miles from the beach
there was no sounding at one hundred and seventy fathoms. It was
only by a lucky change of weather that "we were relieved from the
apprehension of being forced to anchor in a great depth on a lee
shore, and in a dark obscure night." One feels certain that Cook
would find no nautical difficulty in the Pilot's story.</p>
<p>The narrative of Quiros,<sup>*</sup> evidently written in this
part by Bermudez, and with a free hand, tells a story which is
substantially the same, but which has a difference or addition. At
3 p.m., the writer says, Quiros noted that the <i>Almirante</i> and
the launch were far ahead, and near the port. He asked the reason,
for the <i>Capitana</i> was the best ship, and he was told that the
other ships had met with more favourable winds, while the
<i>Capitana</i> had used very little sail, and had made very short
tacks; reasons that seemed good enough. The wind grew stronger, and
the night came on very dark, and the Pilot ordered that, if they
could not reach the port, they must anchor wherever it was
possible. The <i>Almirante</i> and the launch appeared to have
anchored, and had lit their lanterns as leading marks for the
<i>Capitana</i>. Soundings were taken, and they found the bottom at
thirty fathoms, not being an arquebus shot from the port. But the
wind came down in a gust. Sails were taken in, and the ship fell
away. And "the Chief Pilot, exaggerating very much the importance
of being unable to find bottom, together with the darkness of the
night, the strong wind, the numerous lights he saw, without being
able to judge with certainty which were those of the two ships,
said to the Captain that he was unable to reach the port. The
Captain commended his zeal and vigilance."</p>
<p class="note">[* Quiros, ed. Markham, pp. 278-281.]</p>
<p>The passage seems to me to suggest composite authorship. The
story is essentially the same as that told by the Pilot, and, like
his, gives nautical reasons that are apparently sufficient to
explain the failure. And Quiros explicitly praises the Pilot's
"zeal and vigilance." And yet, in the same sentence, he blames him
for "exaggerating very much the importance of being unable to find
the bottom." The phrase rouses suspicion that it expresses the
mind, not of the Captain, but of the secretary. And the suspicion
becomes a certainty when we read what follows:&mdash;"There was
one" (evidently Bermudez himself) "who said, and made it clearly to
be understood, that more diligence might easily have been shown to
anchor, or to remain without leaving the Bay; and that, with only
the spritsail braced up, she might have run for shelter under the
Cape to windward. It was also said that they went to sleep."</p>
<p>Next morning, the Quiros-Bermudez narrative continues, the
Captain asked the Pilot what was the position of the ship. He
replied that she was to leeward of the Cape, and the Captain told
him to make sail that she might not make leeway. The Pilot answered
that the sea was too high and against them, and that the bows
driving into the water would cause her timbers to open, though he
would do his best. "<i>I</i> say" (thus indignantly Bermudez breaks
into the narrative), "<i>I</i> say that this was a great
misfortune, owing to the Captain being disabled by illness on this
and other occasions, when the Pilots wasted time, obliging him to
believe what they said, to take what they gave, measured out as
they pleased!" Attempts were made, the writer admits, during this
and the two following days, to re-enter the Bay. But they failed.
The wind did not go down. They lost ground, so that they found
themselves eighty miles to leeward of the port," all looking at
those high mountains with sorrow at not being able to get near
them." In vain they "diligently sought to shelter behind an island
past which they drove one hundred and twenty miles North-West of
the Bay." "We were obliged to give it up, owing to the wind and
currents, and on the next day we found ourselves at sea, out of
sight of land."</p>
<p>The narrative then gives the reasons which induced "the
sorrowful captain" to abandon the enterprise and make for Santa
Cruz." He considered the strong contrary winds, the very
threatening weather, the fact that their present position was
unknown, that the ship must need repairs, the necessity for going
to a place where she could be got into harbour or careened on a
coast. He had very prominently in his mind that, at the first
difficulty or danger, there would be a want of resolution or of
management, or of the desire to apply a remedy; for which reason,
it might be said with truth, that he was without pilots on whom he
could rely, and that from some other persons there was little to be
expected or hoped. Then there were his own infirmities; so that
altogether the case was one of evident danger." The view of
Bermudez, then, was that the failure was due to the fault of the
Pilots, as well as the fault of the weather: that the conduct of
the Pilots showed a want of resolution or management, and
especially of fervent desire to apply a remedy. The Knights of the
Holy Ghost were, after all, what they had been before they received
their crosses: men "far from having the valorous minds which ought
to animate the searchers for unknown lands, to uphold their
original motive and perform heroic deeds."</p>
<p>Next, let us look at the letter which Torres, after the famous
passage of the Strait, wrote to the King from Manila on the 12th of
July, 1607. Throughout the story Torres had been champion of the
Southward course. He tells in this letter that he had handed to
Quiros a formal written protest against the Northward course taken
by the troublesome Pilot at 26&deg;. Ultimately he had persuaded Quiros
to hand this troublesome Pilot into his own custody, and he
expresses his regret that Quiros had refused to "do anything
further to him or others, though I strongly importuned him to
punish or give me leave to punish them." Torres' opinion was that
this adverse spirit still persisted on the <i>Capitana</i>. It had
shown itself when they had turned Southward from Taumaco; "a
certain person from the <i>Almirante</i> shouted that they should
go in search of Santa Cruz." It was held, says Torres, that "as it
was winter, we could not exceed the Latitude of 14&deg;, though my
opinion was always directly contrary." They had in fact sailed to
the Harbour of St. Philip and St. James in 15&deg;. But the opinion of
Torres was, that the malignant party had determined that in
midwinter they should sail no further South. This seemed to him the
obvious explanation of the conduct of the <i>Capitana</i>, as seen
from the <i>Almirante</i> on that dark stormy Sunday night. "From
within the Bay," he writes, "and from the most sheltered part of
it, the <i>Capitana</i> departed at one hour past midnight." Things
were again as they had been when the fatal change had been made at
26&deg;. Once more the sick and unhappy captain had been "made to turn
out of his course," made to sail North when his duty was to sail
South. Such was the opinion of Torres, written without opportunity
of conversation with Quiros.</p>
<p>One of those who sailed with Torres was a man named Diego de
Prado y Tobar. On the 24th and 25th of December, 1613, he wrote
letters to the King, enclosing very important maps. These letters
were written by one who had heard the story told by some who had
sailed on the <i>Capitana</i>. The writer describes Quiros as an
entirely incompetent person of low-class Portuguese origin. The
only discoveries of "this impostor" were "some reefs and small
islands, from which he was driven by the mutiny of his crew." The
wind coming rather fresh from the South, at eight o'clock in the
night the mutineers effected their evil intention; and it being
dark, and far from us, they passed astern, without that talker
seeing it, for he was in his cabin aft.</p>
<p>Next morning the land they had left was out of sight. He was not
listened to, and they told him to keep in his cabin, and hold his
tongue. He thus saved his life, and they landed at Acapulco. His
own commander told the Marquis of Montes Claros (Viceroy of Mexico)
what sort of a man he was, and that he might as well be confined as
a lunatic. "I know not what respect the Spaniards of Peru can have
for one who was but yesterday a clerk of a ship of merchants, and a
Portuguese...Such low and mendacious fellows ought to be of no
account. He is a liar and a fraud. By his fault he did not discover
the Crown of the Antarctic Pole, though we were so near it. His men
treated him as the man he is fit to be, of the Rua Nova in Lisbon,
in whose mouth there is nought but lies, bragging and dishonesty.
He is fit to be clerk in a merchant ship; and he was the cause of
the Adelantado Menda&ntilde;a being lost with his fleet."</p>
<p>This discord of voices seems to have left public opinion in the
uncertainty that is expressed in the words of Dr. Arias, an
Advocate of Santiago in Chili, who, after the death of Quiros,
wrote a memorial vehemently urging the King to persevere in the
great mission in which Quiros, nearly succeeding, had failed. "For
certain reasons (they ought to have been very weighty), which
hitherto have not been ascertained with entire certainty, Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros left the <i>Almirante</i> and the Launch in the
said Bay, and himself sailed with his ship the <i>Capitana</i> for
Mexico." Even those most heartily in sympathy with the aims of the
mission were puzzled and offended.</p>
<p>It is impossible to discover the correct detail of the story.
But certain facts stand evident. Quiros was desperately ill. Though
a skilful Pilot he was a weak commander. To Spanish soldiers and
seamen he was at best "that talker." To them the voyage was a
proved failure. There were no King Solomon's gold mines. The soil
was good, but the natives were bad. Quiros himself admitted that
"there was not a chance on our side," and that "the place which
seemed so important to the sight had as yet yielded but a bad
account." Yet he proposed to make a settlement at this place, as a
base for exploration Southward in midwinter! No doubt the majority
were opposed to the proposal and eager to defeat it. There seems no
reason to believe that Quiros was betrayed by the Pilot. The
nautical explanation of the failure to get to anchorage seems quite
adequate and acceptable. But when the ship was driven by South
winds out of the sight of the island, and the question had to be
considered, what was now the best plan, it becomes easy to believe
that the way was determined not by the Captain but by the crew. No
doubt men like Quiros and Bermudez heartily wished to return, and
to carry through the project. But the counter-arguments were
strong. There were his "own infirmities." The ship needed repair.
Any further voyage into the unknown of South and West would be
dangerous in the highest degree. It was, no doubt, impossible to
compel a mutinous crew in these circumstances to undertake it.
There would be "want of resolution, or of management, or of the
desire to apply a remedy." In short, Don Quixote must acquiesce in
the tyranny of facts.</p>
<p>The narrative of Quiros becomes a narrative of "sorrowful
discourses." He discusses, with his sympathetic but critical
friend, the failure and its causes. He deplores the delay at
Callao, which had so disarranged his plan that at the last "only
half an hour took it from his hands." Then, going deeper, he
attributes the failure to his own sin he was not worthy to see the
end of a work in which those who loved righteousness would be well
employed." Bermudez seems to have urged that Quiros had made a
mistake when he had refused to punish the wicked. Quiros replied
that "had he done so he would have been discontented and unquiet
all the rest of his life." Bermudez argued that the criminals, whom
he had spared, would speak evil of his person and services and
would ruin the cause he loved so well." "It would be great
cowardice," answered Quiros, "to fear for the truth on account of
this." "He well knew the bad recompense of men, and never hoped for
good report, nor would waste a single moment in such nonsense,
needing time for more important matters."</p>
<p>These "more important matters" were the belief and practice of
Christianity. "To pardon ingrates and enemies without having cause
to do so, to do them good by force, is a very great vengeance." "He
had come out of this first attempt without blood having been shed,
though he had bought this result very dear, and it would cost him
more hereafter." And thus he had made sure that "over the bones of
so many martyrs would rise a good work with good reputation in the
world, which was his chief desire." Such had been the aim of "many
valorous prudent captains, mirrors into which he was looking day
and night with desire to imitate them."</p>
<p>For, in the midst of "sorrowful discourses" came gleams of hope
and faith:&mdash;"discourses more consolatory." The voyage had
ended in personal failure and humiliation, but the Cause for which
he had striven had not failed. He had discovered, and had taken
possession of, good and populous lands that seemed without end; and
this was "a beginning with very great foundation." The completion
of a task so glorious could not be achieved in one voyage, nor in
three, even with very efficient help, and with men who would work
with the same love for the Cause as the Captain felt. Torres, he
believed, would do all in his power to discover more lands. But,
for the present, Quiros, "being about to die," sought strength in
depicting in his "Will" the vision that he had seen, and that made
his life;&mdash;the vision of the Land of the Holy Spirit in the
South. It is to be a land very different from the Spanish colonies
in America, where Spanish falcons have grasped the people with
cruel talons, and with fierce and sharp beaks tear them into two
thousand pieces:&mdash;"it is money, I say, that they want, and
more money, though it be torn from men's entrails." In the New Land
of the South, Spaniards are not to be falcons but "pelicans who
first tear their own flesh," and so feed their spiritual children
with pure and clean love.</p>
<p>Thus, in Austrialia of the Holy Spirit, will be "nests without
brambles, nor any other kind of thorn, refuges, and pleasant
abiding-places," where will be "plenty for all." Its people will do
works that are honourable and beautiful. "God and His Majesty will
be served in all those regions, and the natives will be made to
prosper as is just and right; and <i>this</i> will be <i>my</i>
reward." Thus, with grotesque complication of phrases, the Captain
gave in his "Will" the ideal of Franciscan Spain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they were sailing North from Santa Cruz. When they
reached the Latitude of that island, 10&deg; 30', no land was to be
seen, and they did not know whether Santa Cruz was to the East or
to the West. There was talk of sailing West. But Quiros explained
that this course would bring them to "the Southern side of New
Guinea, whence it would be a bad time of the year to make a voyage,
being the season of South-West gales."<sup>*</sup> Some wished to
sail for the Philippines, others to "seek employment in the
porcelains or silks of China"; but in the end all agreed to make
for Mexico by "the customary navigation." God gave them rain, and
they had plenty of biscuit. Off Cape St. Lucar they stood to arms,
and had look-out men at the mast-head; for it was there that "the
Englishman, Thomas Cavendish, robbed the <i>Santa Anna</i>"; but
they passed in peace.</p>
<p class="note">[* See map of Espiritu Santo in Dutch translation
(1612) of Quiros's Memorial. See p. 189.]</p>
<p>At the mouth of the Gulf of California they encountered a storm
so prodigious that hope was abandoned. The Captain, ill in bed, in
great haste ordered the two natives to be brought to him. A
Franciscan Father asked whether they wished to become Christians.
They assented very fervently, and, when they had recited the Creed,
the Father baptised them, calling them Pedro and Pablo. Quiros was
their Godfather, and embraced them, with his eyes full of tears,
thanking God for "this small fruit, small as compared with my
desires but really great, for they are two souls newly baptised,
and brought into the bosom of our Catholic Church." Pedro and Pablo
were very devout and constant in their prayers, with their hands
joined, and, when the ship appeared to be sinking, they cried
"Jesus! Mary!" making the sign of the cross towards the sea. The
ship ran on, and hope arose. "Fear nothing," said someone, "for
such a work is done that God will add what is needful to save the
ship and crew." The fury of the storm passed, and it began to go
down.</p>
<p>On the 21st of October they came to the Mexican port of Navidad,
weary of "always seeing the same faces." "I say no wonder,"
comments Quiros, "if fathers tire of their sons, brothers and
friends quarrel, and a husband sometimes comes to abhor his dear
wife." "Satan did not neglect to sow bad and mischievous seeds in
this port." There were quarrels even with Franciscans, and unhappy
stories were told to the Viceroy. On the 25th of November they came
to Acapulco. Here the guardian of the Convent of Barefoot
Franciscans obtained their request that in the Church might be
placed the cross of orange wood, which had been set up in the Bay
of St. Philip and St. James. And, on the day of the Conception of
the Mother of God, the Captain with great solemnity took the cross
from the ship to the seashore, where the Franciscans received it on
their knees with much devotion, and, forming procession, bore it to
the Convent Church, Pedro and Pablo walking on each side with
lighted torches. Here it was fastened to the High Altar, with
ringings of bells, sound of trumpets, and discharge of guns. "All
the people showed their joy, and not less did the captain, although
he had desired to go to Rome, and put this cross in the hands of
the Pontiff, and tell him that it was the first that had been
raised in those new lands in the name of the Catholic Church. He
wished to bring the natives as first fruit. It happened that events
robbed him of his triumph; but he gave many thanks to God, through
whose goodness he hopes to return the cross to the place whence it
came."</p>
<p>As had been foreseen, the wicked, whom Quiros had refused to
punish, wrote to the Viceroy of Mexico, and "sowed many letters all
over the land, trying to misrepresent and discredit the
expedition." Quiros did his best to satisfy people, proclaiming his
truthfulness and zeal. He was kindly received, he says, by the
Viceroy and others. But their kindness did not extend to the supply
of his necessities; and he departed "without possessing a single
dollar to set me on the road." He owed his passage to the kindness
of friends, and landed penniless at Cadiz. "I sold my bed," he
writes, "to reach San Lucar, where I pawned something else, which
enabled me to go to Seville. There I sold all I had left to sustain
me." With further help from friends he arrived at Madrid the 9th of
October, 1607. He had two maravedis in pocket, and he gave them to
a beggar. Don Quixote was at home.</p>
<p>Some half year after Quiros came to Madrid, news was brought
that put new hopes into his heart&mdash;news that Torres had
arrived at Ternate, and had said that he had coasted along land for
eight hundred leagues!</p>

TORRES</h2>

</ul>
<hr class="short">
<p>At midnight on Sunday the 11th of June, Torres, at anchor at the
head of the Bay, had seen the <i>Capitana</i> blown through the Bay
and out of sight. Next morning he put to sea to seek her, but all
efforts failed. It seemed evident that she "did not sail on the
proper course, nor with good intention." The weak Captain had once
more been mastered by his crew, and had been compelled to abandon
the plan. But Torres still had the <i>Almirante</i>, which was "a
good ship," and also the launch, and he determined to obey the
instructions that had been given by Quiros at the beginning of his
voyage. These had ordered that, when in this part of the world, "he
will steer South-West as far as 20&deg;, thence North-West to 4&deg;, and
on that parallel he is to steer West in search of New Guinea," and
so by way of the North coast of New Guinea to Manila. Torres
determined to obey those instructions, "although contrary to the
inclination of many, I may say of the greater part; but my temper
was different from that of Captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros."</p>
<p>The voyage that followed is one of the most remarkable in
history, and it is unfortunate that our information is so very
little. Our main authority is the letter which Torres wrote to the
King of Spain from Manila on the 12th of July, 1607. He complains
that the "Royal Audience of Manila have not hitherto thought proper
to give me dispatch for completing the voyage as Your Majesty
commanded": and he is therefore unable to be "the first," as he had
hoped, "to give Your Majesty a relation of the discovery." So he
sends one of the Franciscans, "who, having been an eye-witness,
will give a full relation to Your Majesty." And he sends with him
an "account," which is written in vigorous phrase, but with extreme
brevity. The story of the voyage from the Harbour to the West end
of New Guinea is told in three pages of modern print. "I do not
make a relation of labours and victories to Your Majesty, for I
hope to give it at large."</p>
<p>This is the last word of Torres. He wrote also a letter to
Quiros, to which the latter refers in vaguest terms. And no doubt
he wrote letters to others; but, if so, these have disappeared. The
best guess seems to be that he died soon afterwards. In December
1613 one of his crew, Diego de Prado, wrote from Goa to the King of
Spain, enclosing four maps of places visited by Torres; maps which
add a little interesting geographic detail to Torres' bald
narrative, but do not touch the main problems.<sup>*</sup> He
refers to "the map of discoveries," which he had sent before, but
this map, which would have been invaluable, has vanished. Our only
other evidence, I think, is a slight reference in the pamphlet
written by Dr. Arias shortly after 1614.</p>
<p class="note">[* These maps are reproduced by Markham and
Collingridge.]</p>
<p>Torres waited in the Harbour fifteen days, and then, with
reluctant crew, struck South-West. He sought to sail round the
"island"; but the season and strong currents would not permit it,
though he "ran along a great part of it," and evidently saw enough
to make him feel certain that it <i>was</i> an "island." He saw
"very large mountains, many ports, and all was well watered with
rivers." Then he sailed South-West, in the teeth of difficulties
that should make us think more kindly of the failure of Quiros to
persuade his men to face them. "We had at this time nothing but
bread and water; it was the height of winter, with sea, wind, and
<i>ill-will</i> against us. All this did not prevent me from
reaching the mentioned Latitude (20&deg;), which I passed one degree,
and would have gone further if the weather had permitted; for the
ship was good. It was proper to act in this manner, for these are
not voyages performed every day, nor could Your Majesty otherwise
be properly informed." But there was "no sign of land." He had not
quite hit the coast of Queensland.</p>
<p>The next instruction had been to sail "North-West to 4&deg;, and
thence West in search of New Guinea"; a phrase which seems to
suggest that Spanish knowledge of the North coast of New Guinea did
not extend South-ward of 4&deg;. He now, therefore "stood back to the
North-West." Arias, writing soon after 1614, and using we know not
what information, says that Torres "put back to the North-West and
North-East up to 14&deg;, in which he sighted a very extensive coast
which he took for that of New Guadalcanal,<sup>*</sup> and thence
turned Westward for New Guinea." Torres himself says nothing about
this. His statement is:&mdash;"From hence (2&deg;) I stood back to the
North-West to 11&frac12;&deg;; there we fell in with the beginning of New
Guinea. I could not weather the East point, so I coasted along to
the Westward on the South side." He found himself compelled to seek
a way to Manila by the South of New Guinea.</p>
<p class="note">[* The largest of the Solomons.]</p>
<p>The reticence of Torres is exasperating. Those who have read
more recent stories of navigations in the tangles Eastward of New
Guinea realise that he must have been in a position of difficulty
that could hardly be surpassed. Read the story of Bougainville, and
the story of Moresby, and you wonder by what miraculous chance
Torres found his way through those seas. Yet he says not one word
of complaint! And, when he "coasted along to the Westward on the
South side" what did he expect to find? Not one word exists to
indicate that man had ever sailed through the Strait to the South
of New Guinea. Mercator and Ortelius had drawn a strait between New
Guinea and their Magellanican continent; but Mercator had partially
covered the strait with a pattern, and both geographers had said
that its existence was "uncertain," giving no word of argument
either for belief, or for unbelief. Wytfliet had said there was a
strait, and had drawn it; but again without one word of evidence.
Yet Torres simply "coasted along to Westward on the South side,"
without any reference either to strait expected or to strait found.
And he sailed through this strait&mdash;a strait in which, Moresby
says, "a ship is never safe out of the beaten track, the lurking
dangers are so many"<sup>*</sup>&mdash;and all we get from him are
a few bald phrases about "many islands" and "a reef of shoals," and
"great currents."</p>
<p class="note">[* Moresby writes: "Torres Straits are about two
hundred miles long with a least breadth of eighty miles between
Cape York and New Guinea. At this part the depth of water nowhere
exeeeds twelve fathoms, but elsewhere in the Straits the depth is
somewhat greater, but rarely exceeds twenty fathoms. The entire
surface of the Straits is strewn with coral reefs and sandbanks and
islands, the larger of which are of volcanie origin. The smaller
are low white islands of coral formation, scarcely raised ten feet
above the sea level. West of Cape York a series of lofty volcanic
islands, suceeeded by lines of coral reefs, with very narrow
channels for ships between, lie like giant stepping-stones between
Queensland and New Guinea, suggesting the idea that New Guinea and
Australia were one land." "A ship is never safe in Torres Straits
when out of the beaten track, the lurking dangers are so many. The
changes made during heavy gales in the shape of rapid shifts and
other accumulations of sand defy calculation, added to which the
sea is so discoloured by the New Guinea rivers flowing down that
such dangers are made imperceptible."]</p>
<p>It seems difficult to draw the route of Torres with any
exactness. His few sentences seem extremely obscure, and some of
them seem irreconcilable with the modern map. The facts that we
know certainly are those given, not by the narrative of Torres, but
by the maps sent by de Prado. On the 18th of July, after battling
for five days with extensive and very dangerous reefs, Torres
anchored in the Bay at the extreme South of New Guinea, which
Moresby visited in 1873, and called Jenkins Bay. Torres called the
land "the land of Buenaventura," and he, or his artist, drew a map
the features of which can be easily recognised.<sup>*</sup> On the
10th of August they anchored eighty miles Westward in a Bay which
they called the Bay of San Lorenzo; the modern Bay of l'Orangerie.
It is "very beautiful and pleasant," says the map maker, "the best
land and the most fertile that has yet been discovered"; and he
drew a map of something that looks like a Spanish town laid out in
streets. On the 18th of October they were in a Bay in 3&deg;, 40', one
thousand four hundred and eighty miles from their first landfall,
which they called the Bay of San Pedro de Arlanca. It is the modern
Triton Bay.</p>
<p class="note">[* See Collingridge and Markham.]</p>
<p>These facts are clear and exact. The trouble is to understand
exactly how Torres got from the second of these places to the
third, and exactly what were his reflections as he made the first
recorded passage of this most dangerous Strait. It is difficult for
the student to blame too severely the baldness and the apparent
confusion of the narrative. Here at last is a man who definitely
saw the Southern Continent. He had sailed in search of it under a
captain whose soul blazed with passionate desire of its glories.
Quiros, the Moses of this great enterprise, had seemed to get
vision of the continent, and then, "for lack of half an hour," had
sailed home with "sorrowful discourses." And now here was Torres,
the Joshua of our story, actually in touch with the Promised
Land&mdash;and he has not a word to say about it! His thought runs
always Northward. By adding his figures we gather that he has
sailed along a coast on this side extending two thousand, four
hundred and forty miles. He has nothing of interest to say even
about this huge country save that at the Western end are "Mahomedan
Moors," who "<i>said</i> that in all the land there was much gold,
and other good things, such as pepper and nutmegs." About things
seen on the South he says no word that even Quiros could use as
argument for further enterprise. He writes as one who neither
expected a continent, nor saw one.</p>
<p>The only passage that can possibly refer to Australia is a very
confused string of sentences which seem to tell that in 9&deg; Torres
was obliged by "many shoals and great currents" to "sail out
South-West in that depth to 11&deg; S. Lat. There is all over it an
archipelago of islands without number, by which we passed, and at
the end of the 11th degree the bank became more shoal. There were
very large islands, and there appeared more to the Southward; they
were inhabited by black people, very corpulent and naked; their
arms were lances, arrows, and clubs of stone, ill fashioned."
Apparently these words describe the passage of the straits, and one
must imagine that among the very large islands to the Southward was
Cape York. The inexplicable marvel is that there is no word to hint
that a continent was seen, or even looked for! And yet Torres had
seen the maps of Mercator and Ortelius and Wytfliet, and he had
journeyed with Quiros!</p>
<p>Thus unsatisfyingly Torres wrote his account of the first
recorded voyage through the Strait in 1606. The second recorded
voyage was that by Cook in 1770. The account of Torres was not
published by the Spaniards, and the fact that he had passed through
the Strait was forgotten. Spain's day of exploration had reached
its sunset. Why point new paths to the English and the Dutch? The
voyagers of those nations had no knowledge of Torres' exploit. To
them, for another century and a half, the existence of the Strait
remained as "uncertain" as it had been to Mercator and Ortelius.
Then in the 1760's Alexander Dalrymple obtained "a copy of the
pamphlet of Arias, saw that a strait had been passed, and that it
ought to be called by Torres' name. When Cook sailed on his first
great voyage in 1769, his passenger, Mr. Joseph Banks, had been
supplied by Dalrymple with this information, and it fell to Cook to
prove with decisiveness the truthfulness of his predecessor, and to
give the detail which this predecessor had omitted.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. THE SPANISH STORY
ENDS</h2>
<p>Quiros had arrived in Madrid, his two maravedis in pocket for a
moment, on the 9th of October, 1607. Poor in purse, he was richer
than ever in hope, "a Job in poverty but not in patience." He was
"an insignificant ant," he would be content with the wages of a
cabin boy, but his cause, like Milton's, was the cause of God and
of His Church<sup>*</sup>. During the next seven years he remained
in Spain in poverty and in debt&mdash;possessing not one penny, and
owing two thousand five hundred dollars, he somewhere
says&mdash;and he wrote endless Memorials, imploring that he might
be sent to complete the mission of which he had made "beginning
with such good foundation." "During the first eleven days he had
not money to buy ink and paper. He wrote his first Memorial on the
fly-leaves of a pamphlet. He printed it by selling his clothes. To
finish the second he sold his bedding; for the third he pawned the
Royal Banner under which he had taken possession of Espiritu
Santo."<sup>**</sup> When money failed, he <i>wrote</i> copies, and
distributed them among Court officials.</p>
<p class="note">[* "Neither do I fear those dark and stormy nights,
looking in the midst of real dangers for undiscovered lands; and be
it known that I also love courts and populous cities, and I give it
up all for the service of God only."]</p>
<p class="note">[** Markham, p. xxx.]</p>
<p>Altogether he wrote fifty Memorials, and drew more than two
hundred maps. All the maps have disappeared. In the Dutch
translation of one of the Memorials, however, there is a map,
which, whether drawn by Quiros or not, seems to represent the
geography of the new discovery as it appeared to his
mind.<sup>*</sup> Of the Memorials, eight remain. Two of them were
translated into English, French, German, Dutch, and Latin, and were
the chief source of information during this period about the
exploits and the hopes of Quiros. In them, with abundant detail and
endless repetition, he insists on the various branches of the great
argument. He had discovered either a continent, or islands that
were very near a continent&mdash;"never have there been found
inhabited islands that are not very near a continent." This
continent would be "another New World," like America, just as great
and with prospects of becoming greater. He himself had seen silver
and pearls<sup>**</sup>&mdash;statements that one cannot explain!
And further facts had been learned from Pedro, the captured native
of Taumaco. Before he died, a saved and happy Christian, "led to
the gift of God's holy Glory," he had made marvellous statements
concerning great lands to the South of his islands; lands where
were large towns, "inhabited by people as white as ours," a country
of very high mountains and large rivers, abounding in spices and
silver and gigantic pearls produced by oysters so huge that, if the
hand is put inside the shell, and the shell shuts, there is no
hand, and the oyster must be captured by means of a stick with a
noose of rope at the end.</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-38">Illustration 38</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** He writes:&mdash;"the silver that by good
chance I saw in that land, as well as samples of pearls."]</p>
<p>These are strong reasons for believing that "in that hidden
quarter of the globe are very large provinces, all full of many and
of various peoples." The proof is completed by the letters of
Torres, which, says Quiros, "gave me great pleasure, and incited me
to send in more Memorials." The voyage of Torres, he curiously
argues, "establishes the greatness of the land newly discovered";
curiously, because all that Torres had discovered was that New
Guinea had a South coast, and that there was a way to it through a
very difficult strait. The length of this New World, Quiros now
declares, "is as much as all Europe and Asia Minor, as far as the
Caspian and Persia, with all the islands of the Mediterranean and
the Ocean which encompasses, including the two islands of England
and Ireland. That hidden part is one fourth of the Globe, and is of
such capacity that double the Kingdoms and provinces of which Your
Majesty is at present the Lord could fit into it." The lands that
have been seen "touch the Equator," and they "may perhaps go as far
as 90&deg;." They will be lands "antipodal to the greater part of
Africa, to all Europe, and to the greater Asia." Quiros had seen
silver and pearls, and Torres says that he saw
gold&mdash;statements again that need explanation! Mace, pepper,
and ginger had been seen. There were accounts of cinnamon. There
<i>must</i> be clove islands on the line of Ternate. And "the
industry of the Spaniards will make the products of the country
better and more profitable, than what is raised in Peru or
Mexico."</p>
<p>Quiros did his best to make this territorial argument
attractive. But his own mind ran elsewhere. He loved the New World
not for its gold and its spices, but for its "mine of souls." He
urged exploration as part of Spain's duty to Christ. A century
earlier a treaty had been mediated by Christ's Vicar between Christ
and the King of Spain. Christ had granted the New Worlds to Spain
on one strict condition: the condition that to these New Worlds
Spain would be evangelist. Christ had fulfilled His Word; and the
boast of Spain was that the whole globe did not suffice. Possession
of America should have rendered the King undisputed Master of the
World, able to make the Church of God triumphant over Turk and Moor
and all her enemies, in such wise that "all round the world God
would be known and adored by all his creatures." And what had
<i>Spain</i> done? She had destroyed America. She had not saved the
natives, but had exterminated them. She had almost sinned away her
soul. Yet now God offered one more opportunity. "All that has been
lost in America may be gained in Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. It
seems as if God kept the better and richer lands to the last, and
for a man of such good intent. Hasten, my Lord, hasten the measures
for this great and necessitous enterprise." For the need is urgent.
There is fear lest Dutch and English "pirates" enter the new
discoveries, settle there, prey on the Spanish possessions, sow
false doctrines and bring everything to ruin. "My Lord, this is a
great work. For the Devil wages such mortal war, and it is not well
that he should be able to do so much, Your Majesty being the
Defender of the Right."</p>
<p>The Spanish Councils read these Memorials. But they had to
consider also other evidence. Quiros' fellow voyagers were telling
a different story. Torres wrote that, in the late voyage, the
captain had been unable to deal with mutiny. Seamen in Mexico were
saying that he was no better than a lunatic. A man named Iturbe,
who had been accountant on the <i>Capitana</i>, wrote to Madrid
that the failure had been due to Quiros; he had disobeyed the
instructions to sail South; the Knighthood of the Holy Ghost was an
absurdity; Quiros was wholly unfit to command.</p>
<p>The Spanish Councillors were a good deal impressed. Quiros is
"not a very reliable man," said one of them, "though he has the
idea in his head that he is going to be a second Columbus, and that
is his affliction."<sup>*</sup> "Though Quiros possesses both
knowledge and talent," said another, "he lacks all the other
qualities so necessary to accomplish success." And the opinion was
not far wrong. The Council had also other arguments to consider.
The reports of their debates and papers, which still exist, show
that the minds of Spanish statesmen were beset by the feeling that
Spain's day of exploration was done. The statements of Quiros, that
the existence of a great and golden continent had been proved, were
very open to criticism. But suppose they were true! To whom would
this great and golden continent belong? Certainly not to the
Spaniards, who now sailed the Pacific in fear of the guns of
English and Dutch pirates. In view especially of the Dutch danger,
said some Councillors, "it will be well to occupy immediately the
lands discovered by Quiros, even if only by trading factories." But
people knew that such trading factories would soon be welcome
refreshment to the heretic enemy. The Devil, complains Quiros, is
"a very old and experienced soldier, expert in all arts and
sciences, shrewd in making what is really bad appear to be in the
best interests of the State." And the Devil made it appear to the
Spanish Councils that it would be better to spend Spanish money, if
there was any, in completing the exploration of Mexico and Peru.
And there was common sense in the Devil's opinion.</p>
<p class="note">[* Columbus's obstinacy, wrote Quiros, was "not so
much as mine, nor so great his work."]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Quiros must be treated with respect. After
all, he possessed "knowledge and skill." He appeared "very
discontented and suspicious"; and it was feared&mdash;a strange
fear!&mdash;that he would enter the service of Dutch or English. It
might be well to tell him that his argument had much weight, but
that the time was not opportune, that it might be possible to
attend to the matter in two or three years; that meanwhile His
Majesty would enquire whether the Viceroy of Peru had ships to
spare; and that for the present he would be given a well-paid
appointment at court.</p>
<p>So Quiros was kept waiting. Most of the Ministers, he says,
"received the Memorials well, and seemed to value them, but they
did not despatch any faster. My ill-luck was so great that I could
never get anything settled. I procured an interview with His
Majesty, showed my papers, maps, and sea charts, explained what
were the lands I proposed to seek, and their grandeur, and related
the events of the voyage I had already made. Having seen all my
demonstrations with interest, he rose"&mdash;and Quiros was assured
that all would be well.</p>
<p>Finally in 1614 Quiros was ordered to go to Peru with a new
Viceroy, who had instructions "to despatch him from Callao to the
settlement of the Southern region when he judged it to be
convenient, and the state of affairs in Peru makes it proper to do
so." The Government had decided that Quiros must be sent to Peru;
"otherwise he would never be pacified." But it had also decided to
send to the Viceroy <i>two</i> despatches, the one to say that
Quiros was to be given ships, the other to say that he was to be
detained. There was fear that Quiros might discover the existence
of the second despatch, and might go to other princes. Quiros
strongly suspected the truth. But life and patience, he writes,
were worn out, and he went. Thus abruptly his narrative ends. The
only further knowledge we possess is that he died at Panama in
1615, at the age of fifty. It was, as Sir Clement Markham observes,
"a timely death." He would never have been sent on voyage again.
And, if he had been sent on voyage again, the voyage would have
failed. He could not have controlled the best crews of Spaniards
that ever sailed from Callao. It is well that our Don Quixote died
with the divine madness still ablaze, still cherishing
unconquerable belief that the cause of God and of His Church will
unite the World, and that this "will be done by means of a few
Spaniards."</p>
<p>In following the story of Quiros we have continuously in mind
the contemporary Spanish picture of the Knight of the rueful
countenance, with withered and dusty visage, and with respectful
demeanour, who affirmed that the world stood in need of nothing so
much as Knights Errant, and the revival of Chivalry. But the Knight
Errantry of Quiros was the Knight Errantry of Christ; and the
Chivalry which he revived was the Chivalry of the Holy Ghost. He
did not discover a continent, but he achieved a spiritual exploit.
He so dreamed that his dreams entered into the aims of those, of
other times and other nations, who achieved the work which Spain
had refused.</p>

<p>Note on the history of the original sources of information about
the voyages of Quiros.</p>
<p>The Narrative of Quiros was not printed till 1876-1882, but
Figuera's <i>Life</i> of one of the Viceroys of Peru "contains an
abbreviated version" (Markham, vol. i. p. xiii). Torquemada's
narrative, which gave the Franciscan view of the story, was
published in 1614. The narrative of the pilot De Leza was not
printed till 1876. Two of Quiros' Memorials were printed in his
lifetime and were translated into English, French, German, Dutch
and Latin; and it was from them that students mainly drew knowledge
of the voyage. The Memorial of Arias was printed in 1640 (Markham,
xliii), but seems to have been forgotten until Dalrymple got a copy
in the 1760's. The letter of Torres was first printed by Burney in
1806 from a copy "lately" obtained by Dalrymple. Cf. Dalrymple's
bibliography for Quiros in his <i>Voyages</i> (1770).</p>

<p>The enterprise of the South had been a Franciscan mission, and
the Franciscans of Peru were determined to do all possible to
prevent its abandonment. They wrote Memorials to the King which may
still be read in the British Museum; and they persuaded Don Juan
Luis Arias, an advocate of Santiago de Chili, to sum up their
arguments in a treatise that is an interesting illustration of the
mind of religious Spain.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* <i>Early Voyages to Australia</i>, ed. Major;
<i>Voyages of Quiros</i>, ed. Markham.]</p>
<p>The writer explains the physical argument which proves that a
Southern Continent exists. He brings together the facts which
indicate that, at various points, this continent had actually been
touched. He attaches much importance to a story that Juan
Fernandez, the discoverer of the famous island, had also
discovered, somewhere between West and South-West of Chili, "a very
fertile and agreeable continent, inhabited by a white
well-proportioned people of our own height, well-clad and of a
peaceful and gentle disposition." The failure of Quiros, he argues,
was due to his "great mistake" in refusing to sail Southward of
26&deg;; where, says the writer "they saw to the South very extensive
and thick banks of clouds in the horizon, and other well-known
signs of mainland."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* These statements about the voyage of Juan
Fernandez, and the "signs of mainland" in 26&deg;, were used by
Dalrymple in his endeavour to prove the existence of the Continent.
It seems likely that the land which Fernandez discovered was either
the island that bears his name, or possibly Easter Island. The
documents of the voyagers of 1606 do not seem to mention "signs of
mainland" in 26&deg;. Possibly Arias had received information by word
of mouth, or possibly he has in mind the "signs of land on both
sides of us," which Torres mentions at a later stage in the
voyage.]</p>
<p>But the stress is laid on the religious argument: on the duty of
Spain to fulfil the prophecies which foretell, so it is argued,
that Spaniards shall redeem the sheep of the "other" or Southern
fold; and above all on the urgent need to undertake this work <i>at
once</i>. "For the English and Dutch heretics, whom the Devil
unites for this purpose by every means in his power, most
diligently continue the exploration, discovery, and colonisation of
the principal ports of this large part of the world in the Pacific
Ocean, and sow in it the most pernicious poison of their apostasy,
which they put forth with the most anxiety in advance of us, who
should put forth the sovereign light of the Gospel."</p>
<p>Heretics were raging in East and in West. They were trading and
fighting in the Moluccas. They were actually settling in Virginia
and in Bermuda, infecting "millions upon millions" with their
"infernal poison," depriving the Church of "an infinite number of
souls," seeking to found an empire that "will at length possess
much better and richer Indies than our own, and from which they
will be able to lord it absolutely over all our territories, and
all our navigations and commerce with the West Indies." As in the
West, so in the East. Drake and Cavendish had surveyed the Spanish
world from Peru to the Moluccas, laughing at Spanish claims,
trampling on Spanish pride, sacking Spanish cities in the West,
smashing the fence of Spanish monopoly in the East. Meanwhile the
Dutch&mdash;the despised Dutch!&mdash;were trading from the Cape to
the Moluccas, and from the Straits to the Moluccas. "We have
reached such a point that the most inconsiderable nations of
Europe, whom we formerly held beneath our feet, now look upon us as
an afflicted nation, and of small account;&mdash;which is a
horrible fact, and an easily recognisable effect of divine
indignation." Let the Spanish King, before too late, act in the
spirit of his most Christian predecessors, who declared that, when
other means failed, they themselves would go forth. "Thus should
Your Majesty set the eyes of your heart upon preaching the gospel
in the South, as Christ is now recounting to you, with the Crown of
the universal Empire of the Globe in his hand." "To <i>you</i>, the
Apostle says, '<i>Do</i> the work of an evangelist!' <i>Do</i> this
work, and then your Majesty will be able to say at the Day of
account, 'Bonum certamen certavi'; overcoming the greater power of
Lucifer, giving liberty from his tyrannical and abominable
servitude to so great a number of souls in the Southern hemisphere.
<i>So</i> gain the reward of that unspeakably glorious crown!</p>
<p>The memorial of Dr. Arias is the last word of Spanish chivalry
seeking to conquer for Christ "the universal empire of the Globe."
It failed to move the mind of Spain. With visibly failing
resources, she already possessed an Empire on which the sun never
set, to exploit, to settle, to defend against heretic "basilisks
and dragons." Sensible men were saying that Spain's hands were
already over-full; using, complains Arias, "plausible but
superficial arguments of expediency," "reasons of State advanced in
opposition to the imperative command of the Apostle, 'Do the work
of an evangelist.' "But Don Quixote, said the Spaniard, became
sane&mdash;and died. The madness of Spain, which had achieved the
impossible, departed. The government became wise&mdash;and weak;
the government of "an afflicted nation." Spain was able to hold
what she had conquered. But the continent of the South was to be
the land of the heretic.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>English interest in the East was of early date: Before the
voyage of Columbus, Bristol merchants had sent ships Westward in
search of an island of "Brasil," which was thought to be a
stepping-stone to Cathay. Then in 1497 they sent John Cabot who,
like Columbus, believed that he could find the Spice Islands by
sailing West, and who hoped "to make London a greater place for
spices than Alexandria." He sailed North-West, discovered a
Newfoundland, and was believed to have won for England "a great
part of Asia without a stroke of a sword." The Cape was the
Portugal route, and the Straits were the Spanish route, but
Englishmen believed they would find a North-West passage that would
be much shorter than these. In the days of Henry VIII. wise men
urged that England should give up her "attempts against the
<i>terra firma</i>"&mdash;i.e. attempts to conquer
France&mdash;"and travel by that way which it seems eternal
providence has destined us, which is by sea." If Spaniards and
Portuguese would not suffer Englishmen to join with them, "there
will yet be region enough for all to enjoy."</p>
<p>Attempts to find a North-West passage failed. So, under Mary,
Englishmen tried the North-East. Chancellor discovered, not Cathay,
but Russia; which seemed an amazing novelty. The Muscovy Company
was formed, and, under Elizabeth, its famous commercial travellers,
like Anthony Jenkinson, pushed across the Caspian to Persia, and
opened trade with India. But this was a very long and troublesome
route, and profits diminished. And, at the same time, the old trade
by way of the Mediterranean was failing. The last "Venetian argosy"
was wrecked off the Isle of Wight in 1587. Then English merchants
strove to do their own trade. A commercial treaty was made with the
Sultan, and the Levant Company was formed with permission to trade
as far as India. But Spain possessed sea-power in the
Mediterranean, and British trade became precarious. And when in
1580 Philip of Spain became King of the Portuguese, he put a stop
to the large trade in Oriental goods that had grown up between
Lisbon, Antwerp, and London. Dutchmen and Englishmen must either go
without their luxuries, or must send their own ships to the East to
get them.</p>
<p>And meanwhile the East was becoming both better known and more
attractive. In 1580 Drake came home with the ship-load of cloves,
and the alleged monopoly treaty with the King of Ternate. In 1588
Cavendish brought news that Englishmen might trade as freely as the
Portugals in the Moluccas, and urged that Elizabeth should take
advantage of the defeat of the Armada to seize the spoil of her
enemy in all the richest places of the world. In 1583 Ralph Fitch
set forth on a grand Asiatic tour which brought him to the court at
Delhi of Akbar the Great, founder of the Moghul Empire, to Burmah,
and to Malacca, and enabled him to bring home great news to English
merchants when he returned to London in 1591.</p>
<p>But by far the most important newsbook was that written in
1595-6 by the Dutchman John Huyghen van Linschoten, the Marco Polo
of this part of our story. As a boy at Haarlem, he had taken "no
small delight in reading of histories and strange adventures."
Thinking that "no time is more wasted than when a young fellow
hangs about his mother's kitchen like a baby," he traded in
Seville, and then in 1583 sailed to India in the suite of a new
bishop of Goa. At Goa he lived five years, learning the news of the
whole Eastern world, and making notes. On his way home in 1589 the
Portuguese ship in which he sailed was compelled to stay at the
Azores. He stayed there for two years; and it is to this accident
that we owe his vivid picture of the last fight of the
<i>Revenge</i>. His books describing the routes to India, and the
various lands of the East, were printed in 1595 and 1596. An
English translation appeared in 1598. The English editor, in his
preface, believes that readers will give close attention to "the
great provinces, puissant cities, and unmeasurable islands of the
Indies." "I do not doubt, but yet I do most heartily pray a wish
that this poor translation may work in our English nation a further
desire and increase of honour over all countries of the world by
means of our wooden walls." The riches of the Eastern world, and
the vicious weakness of the Spanish-Portuguese Empire were
revealed; and the way to act was by wooden walls.</p>
<p>The English merchants easily understood. Already in 1589, the
year after the Armada, they had obtained a licence from the Queen
to send three ships in direct trade to India, and in 1591 the first
English squadron, under James Lancaster, sailed, by way of the
Cape, to the Indian Seas. The voyage was disastrous. Of one hundred
and ninety-eight men only twenty-five returned in 1594. But
Lancaster had made his voyage. He brought back a "precious cargo of
pepper and rich booty." He had convinced the declining Levant
Company that it must transform itself into an East India Company,
and claim the trade of the Pacific. In 1600 they obtained a Charter
which granted the exclusive privilege of trade with all lands
beyond the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of Magellan, except
those lands actually possessed by Christian princes in amity with
the Queen. Among the lands not actually possessed by friendly
Christians was Terra Australis Incognita.</p>
<p>The English East India Company was in its early years a somewhat
weakly body. The ventures were ventures, not of the whole Company,
but of separate groups of members. It was not till the days of
Cromwell, "the first ruler of England to realise that the Indian
trade was a concern of the nation," that the Company was
transformed "from a feeble relic of medieval trade guild into a
vigorous forerunner of the modern Joint Stock Company." The Stuart
Kings regarded it as their creature, and violated its charter
whenever it seemed to mean minds that money could thereby be made.
To the Parliament, accordingly, it appeared to be a suspicious
institution, liable to become a source of extra-Parliamentary
revenue. Economists described it as a "canker of the Commonwealth."
In the West Indies you could get "gold, silver and precious things
for beads, bells, knives, looking-glasses, and such toys and
trifles." But in the East Indies you paid out solid gold and got
unlasting spices. The Company sought to argue that they were a
Hercules yet in the cradle.</p>
<p>Their fleets were training schools for the English marine. They
counterpoised "the Hollanders' swelling greatness by trade," and
kept them "from being absolute lords of the sea." English gentlemen
were enabled to exfport more wool, and to raise more rent. True,
Indian goods were bought by English gold; but much of the goods was
re-sold to foreigners at a profit. Englishmen got their spices
cheap, and their gold also increased, as farmers gain by sowing and
reaping. There was much interesting argument; but the Company,
betrayed by the King, and ill-supported by the nation, made slow
way.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See admirable discussion in Hunter's <i>History
of British India</i>.]</p>
<p>But it was at least strong enough to break through the
Portuguese fence. Their agents travelled through India, won the
favour of the Great Moghul at Delhi, obtained permission to
establish a factory at Surat, and even to act as maritime patrol
for the Moghul Empire, with duty to clear the sea of Portuguese,
and to keep open the pilgrim path to Mecca. They broke the
sea-power of Portugal in famous battles. They won supremacy in the
Persian Gulf. They passed Eastward through the Straits of Malacca.
"A native festival," we are told, "still annually commemorates the
first Englishman who lived and died in Japan."<sup>*</sup> And they
found by far their most valuable market in the Spiceries, where, so
they claimed, Drake's Treaty gave them right to monopoly. They had
factories in Sumatra, Amboyna, and Java. It was clear that neither
Spaniards nor Portuguese could fight them. Had these been the only
rivals, England would have become as supreme in the islands as in
India. There would, perchance, have risen a Jamestown or a
Charlestown in Java; and, sailing thence, English merchantmen would
have discovered Australia. But England had other rivals in the far
East. In addition to Portuguese Crusaders, were Dutch men of
business.</p>
<p class="note">[* See interesting account of William Adams in
Hunter, vol. i. pp. 298-9. He was sailing-master on a <i>Dutch</i>

<p>In spirit, as in date, the Dutch Republic was by far the most
modern state in Europe. Dutch patriots had fought and had died for
justice and liberty in one of the great pitched battles of human
history. "The political reformation of Europe," writes Sir William
Hunter, "dates from the Dutch Declaration of Independence of 1581.
Then, for the first time, was asserted and enforced the principle
that government exists for nations, not nations for governments, as
no abstract dogma, but as a truth for which a whole nation was
willing to die." Strife against tyranny stiffened the fibre of
character, and gave consistency and strength to conduct. The
Republic became the home of Soul-Liberty. The intellect was stirred
and strengthened to free and vigorous life. The people were the
best educated in the world. The University of Leyden, child of war
for an idea, explained that idea to Europe. Free soul and free mind
grew in a free state that represented and served the whole
people.</p>
<p>There was equal pre-eminence in things material. Conscience and
intelligence found expression in the industry of day to day. No
people of their number produced wealth so great. In all pastoral
and agricultural pursuits the Dutch taught the world. But their
industrial strength centred in the great cities. Here were made the
best linens in the world. And here lived the Burghers, who had
organized world-commerce with skill and with success that far
surpassed all precedent. It was they, above all, who won wealth for
that "extraordinary soil which produced nothing, and teemed with
everything"; which "had neither timber, nor stone, nor wheat, nor
spices, yet was the great world-market for all that men desire."
"Commerce and Holland were simply synonymous terms...Its morsel of
territory was but the wharf to which the Republic was occasionally
moored; its home was in every Ocean and all over the
World."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Motley's <i>Dutch Republic</i>.]</p>
<p>Even before the war, the Dutch had been a sea-going people. An
enormous herring fishery had created a fleet. A very great trade
developed with Lisbon in Oriental goods. War with Spain stopped
this trade with Lisbon, but it also created a fleet that was able
to go fighting to India. Merchantmen in those days easily became
Dreadnoughts, and "turned a desperate land warfare into a
triumphant naval campaign."<sup>*</sup> They had two thousand ships
of war. Their captains had the reputation of Sir Richard Grenville,
and fought the fight of the <i>Revenge</i>. "It is difficult,"
cried one of them, "<i>not</i> to conquer on salt water. It is for
us to tear from the enemy's list of titles his arrogant appellation
of Monarch of the Ocean. Remember <i>we</i> are all sailors,
accustomed from our cradle to the Ocean, while yonder Spaniards are
mainly soldiers and landsmen, qualmish at the smell of bilge water,
and sickening at the roll of the waves."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Motley's <i>Dutch Republic</i>.]</p>
<p>Thus when Philip II. stopped the Dutch trade with the Indies by
way of Lisbon, Dutch traders knew how to act. They would fight him,
not merely in the European waters, but in the Far East also.</p>
<p>There were three possible ways to the East. There was the
North-East route, which Mercator's map showed to the North of Asia.
The English had tried this route and had failed. But Linschoten,
who knew all that was known about the Cape route, thought the
North-East would prove better. And he sailed in the two first of
the three Dutch voyages that were made in this direction in 1594,
1595, and 1596. They all failed; but the failures were made
memorable by the stiff heroism of Barentz and his men, and show
"the intelligence, enthusiasm and tenacity in wrestling against
immense obstacles manifested by the young Republic."<sup>*</sup>
There were Dutch voyages by Drake's way through the Straits, and
the voyagers saw further evidence of the coast of Terra Australis.
In 1599 Theodore Gerards, being carried by tempest into 64&deg;, saw a
country mountainous and covered with snow, looking like Norway, and
seeming to extend to the Islands of Solomon.</p>
<p class="note">[** Motley's <i>Dutch Republic</i>.]</p>
<p>In 1624 the <i>Orange Tree</i> reported that the Southern
continent had been seen in 50&deg;, and again in 41&deg;. Some of these
ships got to the Philippines, and had fierce fight with De Morga,
who captured one of them, and executed his prisoners as pirates
with the garotte. But Drake's way was long and hazardous. Most
Dutch ships, with Lindschoten's guide-book in hand, went, after
1595, by the Portugal route round the Cape. And they went in very
great numbers&mdash;fifteen fleets, with sixty-five ships, between
1595 and 1601. "The Dutch," complains De Morga from the
Philippines, "come in squadrons, and, supported by them, the
Muslims revolt against the Spaniards. Their interests in the trade
for cloves and other spices are very great, and they expect by this
trade to subjugate the East. If a fundamental remedy be not applied
in good time, the trouble will soon grow so great that it will
never be ended. In the Javas they get such big profits that it will
be hard to drive them from the East, where they have done such
great injuries in spiritual and temporal matters."</p>
<p>But the Dutch were not content. Like the English, they found
that "separate" voyages were instruments inadequate for the
foundation of a commercial Empire at the ends of the earth; and,
unlike the English, they made the essential change at once. In 1602
the separate syndicates of merchants were united into one joint
stock association, with the title of the United East India Company.
The Dutch merchants were to put their whole strength into great
national ventures. The Government of the Company was to be in the
hands of seventeen Directors, chosen by the Chambers of the various
States in proportion to their contributions. They were to act as
commercial Council for the Republic. They had support both from the
Dutch Government and from the Dutch people; and the Dutch Company,
far more truly than the English, became, in Burke's words, "a
delegation of the whole power and sovereignty of the State sent in
the East." And thus the Company became strong with the strength
that had made the Republic. "It was," writes Sir William Hunter,
"the spirit which had cut the dykes that gained the Spice
Archipelago for Holland."</p>
<p>The Company was both an instrument of commerce and a weapon of
war. Its captains, excluded from Lisbon, blocked the Tagus. They
smashed the Spanish fleet in Gibraltar Bay. They routed the
Portuguese off Java, and won Sea Power in all the Eastern seas. Sea
Power gave them the islands. In dealing with the natives they had,
in rivalry with Spaniards and Portuguese, important advantages.
They had no crusade to wage against the "Muslims." They wished
neither to conquer nor to convert. Their sole wish was to buy and
sell, and to buy and sell with a strict monopoly of trade. They
treated the natives fairly well, and appeared as deliverers from
Portuguese cruelty. Spain became convinced, though not by argument,
that it was best to give what could not be withheld. In 1609, while
Quiros was writing Memorials, the King of Spain made a truce with
the Dutch, in which he promised that he would not interfere with
Dutch trade in the East. The Spanish fence was broken down, and the
Dutch were allowed to enjoy that free trade without which, as they
said, their State "would melt away like snow in the sun."</p>
<p>The Dutch used the Sea Power to build an Empire in the East,
firm in its foundations, and touching the coasts of all the Eastern
seas. In 1619 Governor-General Coen, who "was to the Dutch Indies
in the seventeenth century what Albuquerque had been to the
Portuguese in the sixteenth, and what Dupleix became to the French
in the eighteenth," founded "in a congenial swamp" the city that
was destined to be the new Amsterdam of the East. Batavia commanded
the whole archipelago, and in an especial way it commanded the
Straits of Sunda, one of its two main entrances. Here, in the large
rich island of Java, Coen established the Dutch Power, giving it
that solid basis in territory and population which the Portuguese
Empire had lacked. He wished, but wished in vain, to make Batavia a
colony of Dutch settlers. It remained an outpost of commercial
Empire; and "the ingathering of a multitude of people from all
parts," which Coen desired "to people our country withal," gave
Batavia a character of Asiatic cosmopolitanism that reminds one of
the European cosmopolitanism of the New Amsterdam that became New
York.</p>
<p>Batavia grew into a city large, prosperous, strong, the seat of
incomparably the greatest power in the Eastern World. It dominated
an island, extensive, fertile, and populous, providing cheap labour
and large revenues. Over the whole Spice Archipelago the Dutch
ruled with omnipotent and tyrannic sway. And this was but the
centre of a huge maritime Empire, which extended "from Madagascar
to Japan, from New Guinea to the Red Sea." St. Helena was occupied
for the refreshment of their ships, the Cape as the essential
half-way house between West and East, Mauritius as a basis for the
slave-trade in Madagascar, and for explorations in the far South.
They traded in the Red Sea and in the Persian Gulf. They conquered
Ceylon, and established factories in India. The capture of Malacca
gave them command of one entrance to the Spice Archipelago, as the
foundation of Batavia had given them command of the other. They had
factories in Cambodia, in Formosa, and in Japan. They threatened
China with the Mailed Fist. According to Coen's plans there was to
be a Dutch garrison in some Fortress to be captured or to be
erected on the Chinese Coast, and a sufficient Dutch Fleet, to be
permanently placed on this station, was to "bend the Chinese to our
will." "It is," he writes, "our fixed intention not to allow in
future any Chinese to sail to any other port than Batavia, on pain
of being declared our enemies, and treated as such." The Dutch
possessed all the gates of the Indian Ocean, as the Arabs and
Portuguese had possessed them in the past, and as the British were
to possess them in the future.</p>
<p>Thus the rival of England in the Far East was not Spain, but
Holland. Very curious is the story of the relations of these two
Protestant States in the later sixteenth century and in the
seventeenth, swinging between a friendship so close that it seeks
actual union, and enmity so ferocious that it finds expression in
unforgivable massacre, and in long obstinate equal war. Both
England and Holland had become World-Powers in the course of
warfare with Spain. In both countries Sea Power had been the child
of the Reformation. Up to the Armada, close alliance had been of
essential importance to both States; and, for twenty years
afterwards, it remained of value. In the Far East, Dutch and
English ships fought side by side against the Portuguese. But, as
Spain grew weak, the question of the defence of Protestantism was
succeeded by the question of the division of the spoils. The
influence of common religion was displaced by the influence of
commercial rivalry. For in those days commerce meant monopoly, and
the Dutch were as severe monopolists as had been the Portuguese.
The instructions to the first Dutch Governor-General were that "the
commerce of the Moluccas, Amboyna, and Banda should belong to the
Company, and that <i>no other nation in the world shall have the
least part</i>."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Hunter, vol. i. p. 341.]</p>
<p>The claim was intolerable to countrymen of Drake and Cavendish.
In 1605 the King of Ternate asked after Drake's health, and
complained that the Dutch prevented him from granting a factory to
the English. The English replied by claiming a factory, "for that
Sir F. Drake had trade in Ternate before the Dutch were known in
these parts of the world." The Dutch, they said, were making use of
"the negligent and inconsiderate English," and were pocketing the
profits of their trade. Mutual enmity quickly grew hot and bitter.
"The envy of the Hollanders," wrote an Englishman, "is so great
that to take out one of our eyes, they will lose both of theirs."
They showed to the natives English prisoners in chains, dying of
ill-usage. They boasted that "one Holland ship will take ten
English, that they care not for our King, for St. George was now
turned child." On one occasion they put the English flag on Dutch
pirate ships, and "covered all the seas from the Red Sea to China,
spoiling and robbing all nations in the name and under the colour
of the English." Such, at least, were the English stories, and
words grew bitter. Sir Thomas Dale, infamous for methods of
barbarism in Virginia, receiving a document in Flemish, "scolded,
stamped, swore and cursed," and asked "why the letter was not
written in French, Spanish, Latin, or any other language, if we did
not like to write English."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* This discussion is mainly based on Sir W.
Hunter's <i>History of British India</i>.]</p>
<p>In 1623 Governor-General Coen sailed for Holland, leaving
instructions to "treat the English no more than a <i>public
enemy</i> ought to be treated; not weighing too scrupulously what
may fall out." Governor Speult of Amboyna, who had been accused of
some slackness of duty, acted on the hint. He manufactured evidence
of English conspiracy out of the confessions of a tortured
Japanese. The accused English were tormented with long-drawn
atrocity, and ten of them were executed. Some of them managed to
write on pages of their prayer-books, or other scraps of paper,
notes like the following:&mdash;"We through torment were
constrained to speak that which we never meant, nor man imagined.
They tortured with that extreme torment of fire and water that
flesh and blood could not endure. Written in the dark."</p>
<p>The English people did not love the English Company, but the
cruel and insolent outrage burnt hot and deep. The Company talked
of "joining with the Portugals, and rooting the bloody Dutch out of
the Indies." James I. threatened war, but did nothing. Charles even
seized Dutch ships, but was satisfied by payment of &pound;30,000 into
his personal pocket. At length Cromwell, determined to make the
name of Englishman as respected through the world as had been the
name of <i>Civis Romanus</i>, insisted that the Dutch must pay
compensation to the Company for the old iniquity. But it remained
unforgiven. "The spectres of the tortured victims," writes Sir
William Hunter, "stood between the two great Protestant Powers
during a century."</p>
<p>But, among the islands, "the insatiable covetousness of the
Hollanders" had won. The English had to be content with what then
appeared the second-best. They withdrew to India, and built the
Indian Empire. The Dutch remained for a hundred and fifty years in
complete possession of the Australasian Oceans: and to them came
the opportunity of exploration in the South.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>Quiros had died his "timely death" in 1615. And in the same year
Dutchmen sailed to achieve his plans.</p>
<p>Isaac Le Maire was a great merchant of Amsterdam. He had read
the Memorials of Quiros, and was convinced that a huge continent,
rich in gold and spices, existed in the South Pacific. Schouten, a
famous seaman, who had made three voyages to the East Indies,
agreed to undertake, together with Le Maire's son James, the voyage
of exploration which had been refused by the Spaniards. The
adventurers were not members of the Dutch East India Company, and
they were therefore barred from sailing thither by way of the Cape,
or by way of the Straits. But they believed that it would be
possible to find a new passage South of Tierra del Fuego. Magellan
and his sailors had suspected that the land to the South of the
Straits was not part of a continent but an archipelago of islands.
Drake had proved that this view was true, and it had been
represented both in English and in Dutch maps.<sup>*</sup> It was
now proposed to seek this hitherto unexplored passage, to sail
through it to the South Seas, to follow in the track of Quiros,
complete the discovery of the great Southern Continent, and finally
proceed to Asia. A company was formed called "the Australian
Company,"<sup>**</sup> and in 1610 Prince Maurice, paying
singularly little regard to the chartered monopoly of the East
India Company, granted permission "to go to trade in the Kingdoms
of Tartary, China, Japan, India, Terra Australis, and the islands
of the South Sea."</p>
<p class="note">[* Corbett's <i>Drake</i>, vol. i. p. 258 (1899
edition).]</p>
<p class="note">[** "Very diverse opinions obtained among the crews
concerning this voyage and these ships, which were finally called
the Goldseekers, but the aforesaid directors called their assembly
the Australian Company" (<i>East and West Indian Mirror</i>, p.
167).]</p>
<p>In 1615 James Le Maire and Schouten sailed from the seaport of
Horn in two ships named the <i>Eendracht</i> and the <i>Horn</i>.
Fear of the jealousy of the East India Company made them keep
secret the real design of their enterprise. But, arriving in the
South Atlantic, it was explained that they were "to find another
passage other than the Straits of Magellan, to enter the South Sea,
and discover new lands and isles towards the South, where,
according to some, great riches are to be found." The sailors
rejoiced, each looking to make his profit. They found a passage
between Tierra del Fuego and a land which they called Staten Land,
and believed to be part of Terra Australis.<sup>*</sup> It was not
till 1643 that a Dutch captain proved that Staten Land was no
continent but an island off Tierra del Fuego, "of about nine or ten
leagues in length, destitute of any convenient bay or port."
Sailing through the new-found strait, they rounded the cape which
they called, after the name of the Dutch town whence they had
sailed, Cape Horn. They saw the Western mouth of the Straits of
Magellan, and "rendered thanks to good fortune in a cup of wine
which went three times round the Company." Billows rolling from the
South-West proved to them that no continent existed in that
direction.</p>
<p class="note">[* Rainaud, p. 347.]</p>
<p>Then, sailing North-West, they began, with Quiros for
guide-book, the search for Terra Australis. They came to several
islands to which they gave names&mdash;Dog island, Fly island,
Cocoa island, Water island, Horn island, and the like&mdash;in
singular contrast with the saint-names of the Spaniards. The
islands answered so closely to the descriptions of Quiros, that it
seemed to Le Maire they must already be near the Solomons, or the
Bay of Quiros, on the edge of Terra Australis. In fact, in terms of
modern geography, they were between the Fijis and Samoa. Le Maire,
the optimist, was eager to complete the discovery by sailing
Westward on a course which might have taken them to the New
Hebrides and to the Eastern coast of Cape York peninsula. But
Schouten, the practical sea-man, declared the plan unsafe. A
Westerly course would bring them on the South side of New Guinea
among unknown and dangerous coasts. The route of Torres was
unknown. All would depend on the discovery of the "uncertain"
passage between New Guinea and Terra Australis, and if they found
no passage they must be lost. The only safe plan now, so Schouten
argued, was to sail on a North-West course, in order to round New
Guinea by the North, and so reach the Moluccas. The argument
prevailed. Once more the search was abandoned. The Dutch ships
sailed North-West on a course that took them along the coasts of
New Ireland, New Hanover, and New Guinea. At length they came to
Java, where Governor-General Coen required them, by virtue of his
commission from the East India Company, to deliver up the ships and
cargoes.</p>
<p>The voyage is memorable, in the story of exploration, as the
first voyage round Cape Horn, and as the voyage that revealed with
some definiteness of detail the long North coast of New Guinea. It
is still more memorable as the Dutch link between Quiros and Cook.
Like both these seamen, Le Maire definitely sought for Terra
Australis, and, if he had sailed according to his wish, he would
have discovered the East coast of Australia. But in fact he
discovered only a few coral islands, whose geography remained a
puzzle to his successors. Nor did the voyage lead to other voyages
of discovery by this route. A century passed before Roggeveen's
endeavour to accomplish the task in which Le Maire had failed. For
the present, we must follow the slow groping process by which Dutch
seamen discovered bit after bit of the Australian coastline, and
pieced these bits together till they grew into the map of
Tasman.</p>
<p>It is not a very interesting story. It is, in fact, a story of
unsurpassable dryness. We have been told that "it was the spirit
which had cut the dykes that gained the Spice Archipelago for
Holland." But there was very little of "the spirit of the dykes" in
the use which the Dutch made of their gain. The trail of business
is over the whole story; indeed the whole story is nothing but a
trail of business. Complete and singular is the contrast between
the Spaniard and his successor. It is the contrast of the Cathedral
full of men with all human virtues and vices, and the Factory
wherein is neither virtue nor vice, nor even men, but one thing
only, desire to make money. In place of Don Quixote we have a
bagman, and by no means an "inspired bagman." In place of voyages
of knightly mariners, following the gleam of a golden continent, we
have a dull story of the gropings, along rocky and barren shores,
which cut the utterly uninteresting continent of New Holland out of
the beautiful Spanish dreamland of Terra Incognita. In place of
quest of a great "mine of souls," we have long inventories of
things for barter for "the benefit of the Company." There is no
religion in the Dutch story, and there is very little pretence of
religion. The Dutch, wrote their representative in Japan, have
persuaded the Japanese to expel Spaniards and Portuguese on the
ground that they are Christian proselytizers; and now some "jealous
detractors" have persuaded the Japanese that the Dutch also are
Christians, and "that the duty of a Christian forbids him from
suffering his faith and doctrine to remain stationary. Thus do
venomous serpents attempt to suck our blood!" The Japanese have
pulled down the newly erected Dutch warehouse, and "the glory of
our nation, only lately shining with radiant lustre in the eyes of
the Japanese magnates, has been sadly eclipsed by the Christian
name."<sup>*</sup> "The Company," our modern Dutch historian
quaintly explains, "gave as much attention to Christianity as could
in reason be demanded from a man of business."</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 46.]</p>
<p>Nor, again, do our Dutch records show any trace of that cultured
and instructed inquisitiveness that lightens every page of later
travellers like Dampier and Cook. Science is interesting only as
science helps business. Business is interesting only as business
produces dividends. Many of the merchant princes, who ruled the
East from Amsterdam, were no doubt men of culture wide and deep,
and they were prepared to listen with a fairly open mind to
proposals of exploration; but those proposals must suggest more
business for the Company. And the men who went to Java to trade,
and to sail, and to govern, seem generally to have been drawn from
the poorest and least educated class. They were good men of
business and skilful navigators, and that sufficed. In the whole
story no single individual stands out from the crowd of able
skippers by virtue of distinct character and ideas. All we learn
from our records is, that men with Dutch names sailed on voyages
for the benefit of the Company, and that they discovered barren
coasts of no benefit to the Company, nor to anyone else.</p>
<p>The Dutch discovered Australia by exploring the Southern coast
of New Guinea. The existence of New Guinea had now been known for
nearly a century, and it had a reputation interesting to the
commercial traveller. Already in 1526 Saavedra had named the North
coast the "land of gold." When, late in 1606, Torres came to the
South-West end, he was told by the Moors, whom he found conquering
the Papuans, that "in all the land there was much gold, and other
good things, such as pepper and nutmegs." The same news had reached
the Dutch at Java. In November 1605 a small pinnace named the
<i>Duyfhen</i> was sent from the Company's factory at Bantam "for
the discovery of the land called Nova Guinea which, it is said,
affordeth great store of gold." In their passage, says our Dutch
record, "they sailed by the islands of Key and Aroum, and
discovered the South and West coasts of New Guinea, for about eight
hundred and eighty miles (220 Dutch miles), from 5&deg; to 13&frac34;&deg;."</p>
<p>That is to say, they passed from the South coast of New Guinea
across the strait to the West coast of Cape York peninsula, and
sailed down it some considerable way. "They found this extensive
country for the greatest part desert, but in some places inhabited
by wild, cruel, black savages, by whom some of the crew were
murdered; for which reason they could not learn anything of the
land or waters as had been desired of them, and, by the want of
provisions, and other necessaries, they were obliged to leave the
discovery unfinished the furthest point of the land was called in
their map Cape Keer-weer (Turn Again) situated in 13&frac34;&deg; S."
According to Flinders, who sailed that way in 1802, Keer-weer is a
Cape hardly worthy to be called a Cape. "I could see," he writes,
"nothing like a Cape here; but the Southern extreme of the land
seen from the mast-head projected a little; and, for respect to
antiquity, the Dutch name is there preserved."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders, vol. ii. p. 129.]</p>
<p>The <i>Duyfhen</i> was back at Banda in June 1606. So that the
"first authenticated discovery of any part of Australia" took place
about March 1606, some six months before Torres sailed through his
strait, perhaps saw Cape York, and crossed the track of the Dutch
pinnace. The voyage of the <i>Duyfhen</i> had been a failure. They
brought home a story of arid coasts and man-eating savages. They
left the question of the strait as they found it. Their maps have
disappeared, so we know not how they thought of the tangled region
through which they passed from coast to coast. Apparently it looked
to them more like a passage than a bay, for their successors, who
had use of their maps, expected to find "an open passage."</p>
<p>The next Dutch discovery was made in a different part, and in a
different way. In the voyages to the East, the Dutch had at first
followed the Portugal route, which struck Northward from the Cape
along the coast of Africa or Madagascar, and then Eastward to India
and the islands. But in 1611 Commander Brouwer tried another way.
After leaving the Cape, he sailed Eastward for four thousand miles
before turning Northward. It was found that the new way was twice
as fast as the old way. In 1614 three ships sailed from Holland.
Two took the old way, and arrived in sixteen and eighteen months.
One took the new way, and arrived in six. The Company ordered its
commanders henceforth to take the new way, and offered rewards for
quick passages.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Walker's <i>Early Tasmania</i>, pp. 192-3.]</p>
<p>The change made the discovery of the Western coast inevitable.
In October 1616, says an official letter, the ship <i>Eendracht</i>
"sailed so far Southward as to come upon various islands, which
were, however, found uninhabittd." Our knowledge of this famous
voyage is sadly deficient as far as journals are concerned. No one
who sailed on the <i>Eendracht</i> wrote an account of the
discovery that has had luck enough to survive. We have, however,
two very satisfactory pieces of evidence of a different
character.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have the map<sup>*</sup> drawn in 1627 by Hessel
Gerritz, who was cartographer to the Company from 1619 to 1629. It
is a map that stands in striking contrast to other maps of that
period which are copied from Mercator and Ortelius, and give the
huge wavy outline of Terra Australis, marked with Marco Polo names.
When we look at Gerritz we pass at last from the geography of the
imagination to the geography of discovery. He gives us very little
information, but the little that he gives is a precise scientific
record of things seen and measured. From about 21&frac34;&deg; to about 28&deg; he
draws a coastline that is definite though broken; and behind it he
writes:&mdash;"Tlandt van de Eendracht opghedaen by Dirck Hartogs
met 't Schip d'Eendracht in October A&deg; 1616." In about 26&deg; there is
shown what appears to be a peninsula sheltering an inlet or bay;
and on the peninsula is written "Dirck Hartogs ree (road)." Now
this is very satisfactory. Dirck Hartog's Road is evidently the
water sheltered by the long thin island, still called Dirck
Hartog's island, which so nearly touches the land that, even on the
modern map, it looks like a peninsula.<sup>**</sup> The inlet or
bay is the great bay which Dampier, for good reasons, called Sharks
Bay. And "the land of Eendracht" is West Australia from about
North-West Cape to about Gautheaume Bay.</p>
<p class="note">[* See Illustration 39, directly below.]</p>
<p class="note">[** "As an anchorage during the summer," wrote King
in 1829, "Dirck Hartog's Road has everything to recommend it,
except total absence of water."</p>

(From Coote, <i>Remarkable Maps.</i>)</b></p>
<p><a name="de-vlamingh" id="de-vlamingh"></a>Secondly, we have
another very astonishing piece of evidence. In 1696 a Dutch skipper
named Willem de Vlamingh was sent to explore the land of Eendracht,
and in November 1697 the Governor-General and Councillors at
Batavia wrote an account of his voyage to the Managers at
Amsterdam. "Nothing of importance," they say, "has been discovered
in this exploratory voyage. Only we must not omit to mention that,
in an island situated in 25&deg;, near or before the South-land, they
have found fastened to a pole which, though half rotten wood, stood
still erect, a common pewter dish of medium size, which had been
flattened and nailed to the pole aforesaid; where they found it
still hanging; the said dish bearing the following words engraved
on it, still distinctly legible 'A.D. 1616 on the 25th of Octr.',
there arrived here the ship den Eendraght of Amsterdam; supercargo
Gillis Miebais of Liege; skipper Dirck Hartog of Amsterdam: she set
sail again for Bantam on the 27th do; subcargo Jan Steyn, upper
steersman Pieter Ledocker van Bil.' This old dish which Skipper
Willem de Vlamingh brought us, has now likewise been handed to the
Commander (of the fleet) to be delivered to your Worships, who with
us will no doubt stand amazed that the same has for so long a
series of years been preserved, in spite of its being exposed to
the influence of sky, rain, and sun."</p>
<p>What their amazed Worships did with "the common pewter dish of
medium size" was not known till a few years ago. When in 1899
Professor Heeres published his book of documents, he
wrote,&mdash;"the dish would seem to be no longer extant." A Dutch
journalist named Verster who read the statement, thought of a dish
he had seen in the States' Museum of Amsterdam; and he found that
it is indeed the very same common pewter dish on which Dirck Hartog
had recorded his discovery in October 1616.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See very interesting articles by Mr. George
Collingridge in <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, 2nd and 9th August,
1913. The lower part of the inscription has decayed away. But it
seems perfectly certain that the identification is correct. See
<a href="#il-40">Illustration 40</a>.]</p>
<p>But this is not the end of the story. When, in February 1697,
Vlamingh took away "the old dish," he erected on the same spot "a
new pole with a flattened pewter dish nailed to it," on which he
inscribed both the old record and a record of his visit. One
hundred and four more years passed, and, in August 1801, Captain
Hemelin, sailing in a famous French voyage, sent men to inspect the
island. They returned bringing with them this second Dutch dish,
which they had found "half covered with sand, lying near a decayed
oaken post to which it appeared to have been nailed." The French
captain copied the inscriptions, made a curiously bad attempt to
translate them,<sup>*</sup> and then put the dish once more on a
new post in the old position; "for he would have deemed it
sacrilege to have kept this plate, respected for two centuries by
nature, and by those individuals who might have observed it." It
seems, however, that Vlamingh's dish was brought to Paris by a
later French expedition, and apparently has been
lost.<sup>**</sup></p>

made "an evidently inaccurate copy," which is printed by Heeres, p.
85, and reproduced in this volume, p. 231.]</p>
<p>Dirck Hartog's discovery had been the inevitable result of the
new route. Two years later, in 1618, the skipper of the
<i>Zeewulf</i>, without knowledge of Hartog's voyage, came upon
part of the same coast rather further to the North. "We found
land," writes the Supercargo, "in 20&deg; 15', a low-lying shore of
great length. We do not know whether it is unbroken coastline or
made up of islands. Only the Lord knows the real state of the
affair. It would seem never to have been made or discovered by
anyone before us, as we never heard of such a discovery, and the
chart shows nothing but open ocean at this place." The Captain
suggests that "this land is a fit point to be made by ships coming
here with the Eastern monsoon in order to get a fixed course for
Java."</p>
<p>By 1618 news had reached Holland of the discovery of
Eendrachtsland, and the captains sailing on the new route were on
the look-out for the coast, which some identified with the Terra
Australis of Mercatorian maps, about which, it was believed, Marco
Polo had written. They expected, it seems, that Eendrachtsland
would prove to be Marco Polo's Beach, with its great supply of
gold, of elephants, and spices. In 1619 two ships were sailing for
Batavia under Commander Frederick de Houtman. "On the 19th of
July," he writes, "we suddenly came upon this South-land of Beach
in 32&deg; 20'";&mdash;that is, slightly to the South of Perth. "We
resolved to use our utmost endeavour to obtain some knowledge of
this coast, which seems to be a very good land, but could find no
spot for convenient landing owing to the surf and heavy seas." For
nine days they sought to land, and failed. At last they were
"forced to leave the land aforesaid, not deeming it advisable to
continue inshore in the bad weather with such heavy ships, and such
costly cargoes as we had entrusted to our care, being contented
with having seen the land, which at more favourable time may be
more fully explored with more fitting vessels and smaller
craft."</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th of July, the land was out of sight,
and "deeming ourselves to be in an open sea we shaped our course
North by East." During the night of the 29th, however, three hours
before daybreak, "we again unexpectedly came upon a low-lying
coast, a level broken country with reefs all round it. We saw no
high land or mainland, so that this shoal is to be carefully
avoided, as very dangerous to ships that wish to touch at this
coast. It is fully ten miles in length, lying in 28&deg; 46'."</p>

<b>41. THE FRENCH COPY OF VLAMINGH'S PEWTER DISH</b></p>
<p>Houtman is describing the exceedingly dangerous shoals, which
still bear the name Houtman's Abrolhos. Abrolhos is Portuguese for
"Open your eyes." Why the Dutch used a Portuguese word I do not
know; but its advice was very good. When King sailed that way in
1829 the mast-head man for some time persisted that the three low
small islands were only the "shadows of clouds."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* King, vol. ii. p. 172.]</p>
<p>Houtman got away as fast as possible from these invisible
dangers. But three days later, on the 2nd of August, he saw a long
stretch of land in 27&deg; 40'. The coast was made of red mud, and it
seemed to some, who no doubt had read Marco Polo's account of
Beach, that it "might not unlikely prove to be
gold-bearing,<sup>*</sup> a point which might be cleared up in
time." It was evident that this coast in 27&deg; was Hartog's
Ecndrachtsland and it was further evident that the land, which
Hartog had seen in 22&deg;, 23&deg;, and 25&deg;, and which Houtman had seen
down to 33&deg;, was "one uninterrupted mainland coast." Along this
coast they sailed to Dirck Hartog's island, and then made for
Java.</p>
<p class="note">[* See Goos-Visscher's map, <a href=
"#il-42">Illustration 42</a>.]</p>
<p>Houtman agreed with his predecessor that the discovery should be
used to make "a fixed course from the Cape to Java." You should
leave the Cape, run Eastward for four thousand miles, then North
and North by East to the South-land in 26&deg; or 27&deg;, making sure that
you avoid the "shoal" in 28&deg; 46', and thence, by a course North by
West and North-North-West, you are sure to make the Western
extremity of Java.</p>
<p>The voyage of Houtman is faithfully described in the invaluable
map made by Gerritz in 1627. He draws a broken coast, with
soundings, from about 33&deg; to about 31&deg;. Behind the coast is written
"dunes with trees and underwood at top." Northward the coastline is
broken; and the shoals in 28&deg; 29' are indicated by two
inscriptions; "Torteldurf," an island discovered by the ship
<i>Torteldurf</i> in 1624; and "Houtman's Abrolhos." And at the
back of the whole coast, which is rightly imagined to exist
continuously from 33&deg; to 28&deg;, is written: "I. d'Edels landt." For
some reason that is not explained, the land discovered in this
voyage is called by the name of Jacob Dedel, the supercargo of the
<i>Amsterdam</i>, whose letter supplements in an interesting way
the information given by Commander Houtman.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The supercargo wrote his name <i>Dedel</i>. Why
the name is changed to <i>d'Edel</i> on the map I do not know.]</p>

<b>42. PART OF GOOS-VISSCHER'S MAP, 1639<br>
(Fromm Coote, <i>Remarkable Maps</i>.)</b></p>
<p>In March 1622 the Dutch ship <i>Leeuwin</i> made a discovery of
land to the South of that discovered by Houtman. We have no journal
to tell this story. But on the map of Gerritz, to the South of
D'Edel's land, and united to it by a dotted line, is shown a
coastline which, first running Southward, makes at about 34&deg; an
elbow to the South-East, and runs in that direction to 35&deg;, where
it is cut short by the termination of the map. On the elbow is
written "land made by the ship <i>Leeuwin</i> in March 1622." On
its Western side is "low land submerged"; on the South East "low
land with dunes."</p>
<p>It was becoming evident that there were good reasons for a
systematic exploration of the "South-lands behind Java." Ships
sailing on the new route were almost bound to see the coast, and
were in great danger of running into it. On the other hand, it
might be used as a convenient land-mark, and might eventually
become the much-needed place of refreshment for ships sailing from
the Cape to Batavia. Houtman had described the land from 31&deg; to 33&deg;
as very good land. Dedel had suggested that the "red muddy coast,"
seen in 27&deg;, "might not unlikely prove to be gold-bearing." Both
Houtman and Dedel had declared that further investigation was
required in more suitable ships, and in a more leisurely time. And
then there was the long and still unknown coastline between the new
discoveries and Nova Guinea, still imagined in the light of Marco
Polo information.<sup>*</sup> And once more, there was the elbow to
the East that had been observed at Cape Leeuwin, with suggestions
that deserved exploration.</p>
<p class="note">[* See Illustrations <a href="#il-42">42</a> and
<a href="#il-44">44</a>. Note the disappearance of Beach in
Keppler's map, Illustration <a href="#il-45">45</a>.]</p>
<p>But what made exploration urgent was the constant danger of
shipwreck on broken coasts and invisible islands, Several Dutch
ships found themselves in great peril; and, in July 1622, an event
took place that seemed to demand immediate action. On the 5th of
July, there came to Batavia a boat with ten men, and three days
later came another boat with thirty-six. They were what remained of
the crew of an English ship named the <i>Trial</i>. "They state,"
wrote Governor-General Coen, "that they have lost and abandoned
their ship with ninety-seven men, and the cargo she had taken in,
on certain rocks situated in Latitude 20&deg; 10', in the Longitude of
the Western extremity of Java. These rocks are near a number of
broken islands lying very far apart, South-East and North-West, at
thirty miles distance North-West of a certain island which in our
charts is laid down in 20&deg;. The said ship <i>Trial</i> ran on these
rocks in the night time, in fine weather, without having seen land,
and, since the heavy swells caused the ship to run aground
directly, so that it got filled with water, the forty-six persons
afore mentioned put off from her in the greatest disorder, leaving
ninety-seven persons in the ship, whose fate is known to God
alone." The Governor-General shows that the adoption of the new
route&mdash;the Eastward course of four thousand miles from the
Cape&mdash;makes it "necessary that great caution should be used,
and the best measures taken in order to avoid such accidents." The
Englishmen say that they "met with this accident through following
the course of our ships; and they intended to dissuade their
countrymen from imitating their example."</p>
<p>The broken islands are duly marked in the Map of Gerritz, in
Latitude 20&deg;, and in Longitude due South of the West end of Java,
exactly where the Englishmen had stated that they had been wrecked.
And the curious thing is that, from that day to this, islands have
never been seen in that locality. Dutch captains searched for them
in vain. Flinders in 1803 spent some days in unsuccessful quest.
King had a similar experience in 1829 and he came to the conclusion
that probably the rocks on which the <i>Trial</i> was wrecked were
Barrows Island, Trinonville Island, or one of the numerous reefs
around them. These places are on the Latitude that the English-men
named. The Longitude is quite wrong. "But," writes King, "during
the month of July the current sets with great strength to the
Westward, and might occasion considerable errors in
ship-reckonings, which in former days were so imperfectly kept that
no dependence can be placed upon them."<sup>*</sup> The story
illustrates the fact that should always be in the minds of students
of the early voyagers: their Latitudes are generally right, but
their Longitudes are the result of guess-work.</p>
<p class="note">[* King, vol. ii. p. 444.]</p>
<p>The "Masters" at home had already "earnestly enjoined" that
yachts should be sent "for the purpose of making discovery of the
South-land"; and it seemed to Governor-General Coen that the wreck
of the English ship on unknown islands in the ordinary route proved
"the urgent necessity of obtaining a full and accurate knowledge of
the true bearing and conformation of the said land." It was,
moreover, "highly desirable that an investigation should be made to
ascertain whether these regions, or any part of the same, are
inhabited, and whether any trade with them might be established."
For these reasons, and for others, on the 29th of September, 1622,
the Governor-General issued "Instructions" to two yachts, the
<i>Haringh</i> and the <i>Hasewint</i>, "to discover and explore
the South-land, and to ascertain as much of the situation and
nature of these regions as God Almighty shall vouchsafe to allow
them."</p>
<p>The voyage that was contemplated was not sailed. But Coen's
"Instructions" are a very interesting illustration of the mind and
plans of an energetic Governor-General. The yachts were to sail
Southward from the Western end of Java, i.e. the alleged Longitude
of the Trial Rocks. Having discovered all that was to be discovered
about these rocks, they were to sail still Southward; as far as 32&deg;
or 33&deg;, the Latitude in which "sundry ships" coming from Holland
had accidentally come upon the South land. Here they were to come
to the coast. Then they were to follow this coast Southward as far
as 50&deg;, if the land should extend so far&mdash;if, in other words,
they were on a coast something like the Southern Continent of
Mercator and Ortelius. If, on the other hand, the coast turned
Eastward&mdash;as the news brought by the <i>Leeuwin</i> perhaps
suggested,&mdash;they were to follow this coast "for some time";
but then, unless it again trended Southward, they were to return.
And "in returning, you will run along the coast as far as it
extends to Northward, next proceeding on an Eastern course, or in
such wise as you shall find the land to extend; in which manner you
will follow the coast as close inshore and as long as you find
practicable, and as you deem your victuals and provisions to be
sufficient for the return voyage; even if, by so doing, you should
sail round the whole land and emerge to Southward." An amazing
proposal which, in terms of modern geography, seems to suggest a
voyage from Adelaide Westward, then Northward, then Eastward, and
then Southward to Sydney and Melbourne!</p>
<p>The chief object of the voyage was to be the systematic
exploration and survey of this huge coastline; and the
"Instructions" are a good example of the businesslike thoroughness
of Dutch methods. "You will have to discover and survey all capes,
forelands, bights, lands, islands, rocks, reefs, sand-banks,
depths, shallows, roads, winds, and currents, and all that pertains
to the same, so as to be able to map out and duly mark everything
in its true Latitude, Longitude, bearings, and conformation. You
will, moreover, go ashore in various places, and diligently examine
the coast in order to ascertain whether or no it is inhabited, the
nature of the land and the people, their towns and inhabited
villages, the divisions of the Kingdom, their religion and policy,
their wars, their rivers, the shape of their vessels, their
fisheries, commodities, and manufactures, but specially to inform
yourselves what minerals, such as gold, silver, tin, iron, lead and
copper, what precious stones, pearls, vegetables, animals and
fruits, these lands yield and produce." One wonders what it is that
these Dutch seamen are <i>not</i> to observe!</p>
<p>Further they were to keep a "careful record or daily journal,"
that the Company may obtain "due and perfect knowledge of the
situation, and the natural features of these regions, in return for
the heavy expenses to which she is put by this expedition." They
were to give appropriate names to their discoveries, and were to
"take formal possession "by erecting a stone column recording "in
bold, legible characters the year, the month and the day of the
week and the date, the persons by whom and the hour of the day when
such possession has been taken." They were to "endeavour to enter
into friendly relations, and to make covenants with all such kings
and nations as you shall happen to fall in with, and try to prevail
upon them to place themselves under the protection of the States of
the United Netherlands."</p>
<p>Articles of trade were to be put on board, and it was to be
carefully noted what articles were most demanded. Special inquiry
was to be made for gold. In "the Northern extremity of the East
coast of the South-land," diligent inquiry was to be made for
sandal-wood, nutmegs, cloves, and other spices;" likewise whether
it has any good harbours, and fertile tracts, where it would be
possible to establish settlements, which might be expected to yield
satisfactory returns." When they met with natives, they were "to
endeavour, either by adroit management, or by other means, to get
hold of a number of full-grown persons, or, better still, of boys
and girls, to the end that the latter may be brought up here, and
be turned to useful purpose when occasion shall serve."</p>
<p>Coen's vast scheme was not accomplished, nor even attempted. The
two yachts had to serve in other more urgent business. Four months
later, in January 1623, Coen sailed for Holland. In the same month,
however, Herman van Speult, Governor of Amboyna, sent two other
yachts, the <i>Arnhem</i> and the <i>Pera</i>, on a voyage of
discovery less formidable than that which Coen had devised. The
plan now was to follow up the discoveries made by the
<i>Duyfhen</i> in 1606. One may guess that the chief thought was of
"the Northern extremity of the East coast of the South-land," the
country which Coen had hoped might provide "sandal-wood, nutmegs
and cloves," and perchance offer opportunity of profitable
"settlement." The commander of the expedition, Jan Carsten; was
given general instructions for conduct similar to those drawn up by
Coen for the abandoned voyage.</p>
<p>Carstenz sailed on the 21st of January 1623. He visited the
islands of Quey, Aru, and Tenimber; and the islanders, of their own
free will, placed themselves under the obedience and dominion of
their High Mightinesses the States General, and promised to trade
with the Dutch fortresses in Banda and Amboyna. He struck the coast
of New Guinea at 4&deg; 45', and sailed the whole length of the South
coast to Torres Strait, proving for the first time that there was
"an unbroken coast."</p>
<p>Ten miles inland they noted a very high mountain range, white
with snow, which they thought a very singular sight, being so near
the equator. As seen from afar, the land seemed to have numerous
pleasant valleys and running fresh-water rivers. "But we are unable
to give any information as to what fruits, metals, and animals it
contains, and as to the manner of its cultivation, since the
natives, whom we found to be savages and man-eaters, refused to
hold parley with us, and fell upon our men, who suffered grievous
damage." The skipper of the <i>Arnhem</i> and nine of his men were
slain, "partly owing to their own negligence." A vivid picture is
drawn of the Papuan savage, coal-black like the Caffirs, stark
naked, hole in midst of nose pierced by bones protruding at least
three fingers' breadth on either side, "so that in appearance they
are more like monsters than human beings."</p>
<p>They worked their way down the coast till in 9&deg; 6' they found
themselves entrapped by sandbanks, reefs and shallows on every
side. They were using a chart, presumably made in the
<i>Duyfhen</i>, which showed an open passage. The ship's boats were
sent forth to sound in all directions, but returned reporting
shallows everywhere. It was "clearly impossible any longer to
follow the coast line which we had so long skirted in an Eastward
direction." The ships were "caught in the shallows as in a trap,"
and the best plan possible was to get-out of the trap by the way
they got in. This they managed to do with "extreme difficulty and
great peril"; "for which happy deliverence God,be praised!" It
seemed to them that the tangle of reefs from which they had escaped
was not a strait but a bay; "to which on account of its shallows we
have by resolution given the name of <i>Drooge Bocht</i> (shallow
bight) in the new chart." They determined to call New Guinea "the
West End of Nova Guinea." The land to the South (Cape York
peninsula) they called Nova Guinea.</p>
<p>Making South, writes Carstenz, "we saw the land of Nova Guinea
showing itself a low-lying coast without hills or mountains." One
hundred and eighty years later Flinders sailed along this coast.
After sailing one hundred and seventy-five leagues, he says, he
came to a hill; a hill that "did not much exceed the height of the
ship's masthead." Following the tracks of the <i>Duyfhen</i>, and
noting its places of call, the two Dutch ships sailed Southward,
past Cape Keerweer, as far as 17&deg; 8'.</p>

<p>Here at a river or inlet&mdash;"there was no <i>fresh</i> water
here"&mdash;which they called the Staten River,<sup>*</sup> they
decided to, turn again. "We might get into a vast bay; it is
evident that North winds prevail; we should then fall on a
lee-shore." In default of stone, they caused a wooden tablet to be
nailed to a tree, recording the arrival on the 24th of April, 1623,
of "two yachts despatched by their High Alightinesses, the States
General."</p>
<p class="note">[* Carstenz's Staten River, says Mr. A. W. Jose,
was not the Staten River which Flinders put upon the modern map,
but "a southern mouth of the Gilbert delta." Flinders, using
Tasman's map, did his best to identify the old Dutch names. "But
the <i>Pera's</i> chart, which can be corrected very exactly, and
seems to have been rarely more than ten minutes wrong in its
latitude, shows most of the identifications to be mistaken." Cf.
Flinders' statement, p. 482.]</p>
<p>Next day the <i>Arnhem</i>, which had already given much
trouble, "on purpose, and with malice prepense, cut away from us."
Carstenz thought that the deserter would make for the island of
Aru, "to have a good time of it there"; but, as we shall see, he
was mistaken. The <i>Pera</i> Sailed back along the coast of Nova
Guinea (Cape York peninsula), and then along the coast of "the West
End of Nova Guinea" (New Guinea), and arrived at Amboyna on the 8th
of June.</p>

<b>44. PART OF HONDIUS'S MAP, 1630.<br>
(From Coote, <i>Remarkable Maps</i>.)</b></p>
<p>Both in coming and in returning Carstenz made short expeditions
into the inland of Cape York peninsula, with very unsatisfactory
results. He did his best, in accordance with Coen's instructions,
to capture some natives. "By showing them bits of iron and strings
of beads we kept them on the beach, until we had come near them;
upon which, one of them who had lost his weapon was by the skipper
seized round the waist, while at the same time the quartermaster
put a noose round his neck, by which he was dragged to the pinnace.
The other blacks seeing this tried to rescue their captured brother
by furiously assailing us with their assegais. In defending
ourselves we shot one of them." After telling this story, Carstenz
complains with bitterness that, "in spite of our especial kindness
and our fair semblance, the blacks received us as enemies
everywhere." In one place, they were attacked by a body of two
hundred men. Owing to the ungrateful conduct of the natives the
Dutchmen were unable to obtain all the information required by the
Governor-General. "We have not been able to learn anything about
the population of Nova Guinea" (Cape York peninsula), "and the
nature of its inhabitants and soil; nor did we get information
touching its towns and villages, about the division of the land,
the religion of the natives, their policy, wars, rivers, vessels,
fisheries; what commodities they have, what manufactures, what
minerals, whether gold, silver, tin, iron, lead, copper or
quicksilver."</p>
<p>Carstenz did, however, learn enough about land and people to
write the following description. "The land between 13&deg; and 17&deg; 8'
is a barren and arid tract, without any fruit trees, and producing
nothing fit for the use of man; it is low-lying and flat, without
hills or mountains, in many places overgrown with brushwood and
stunted wild trees; it has not much fresh water, and what little
there is has to be collected in pits dug for the purpose; there is
an utter absence of bays and inlets, with the exception of a few
bights not sheltered from the sea wind; it has numerous <i>salt</i>
rivers, extending into the interior, across which the natives drag
their wives and children by means of dry sticks and boughs of
trees. The natives are, in general, utter barbarians, coal-black;
they are utterly unacquainted with gold, silver, tin, iron, lead,
and copper, nor do they know anything about nutmegs, cloves, and
pepper. It may safely be concluded that they are poor and abject
wretches, caring mainly for bits of iron and strings of beads.
Their weapons are shields, assegays, and callaways of the length of
one and a half fathoms, made of light wood and cane, some with
fishbones, and others with human bones fastened to their tops; they
are very expert in throwing the said weapons by means of a piece of
wood half a fathom in length with a small hook tied to it in front,
which they place upon the callaway or assegay."</p>
<p>Elsewhere Carstenz uses language even stronger in its
comprehensive condemnation. The land "is very dry and barren. We
have not seen one fruit-bearing tree, nor anything that man can
make use of. There are no mountains nor even hills, so that it may
be safely concluded that the land contains no metals, nor yields
precious woods. In our judgement this is the most arid and barren
region that could be found anywhere on the earth. The inhabitants,
too, are the most wretched and the poorest creatures that I have
ever seen." The best he can say for the Australian blacks is that
they "seem to be less cunning, bold, and ill-natured" than the
blacks of Papua. Great quantities of human bones seemed to prove
them to be man-eaters.</p>
<p>Cars tenz in the <i>Pera</i> reached Amboyna on the 8th of June
without news of the <i>Arnhem</i>, which had deserted him with
malice prepense, intending, as he suspected, to make for Aru and
have a good time. The Aruese, however, told him that they "had not
seen the said yacht." It turned out that the <i>Arnhem</i> had
arrived at Banda three weeks before the <i>Pera</i>. "They have
done nothing worth mentioning," wrote the Governor of Banda to the
new Governor-General Carpentier, who had just arrived to take the
place of Coen. Yet, though no journal of the <i>Arnhem's</i> voyage
has been preserved, there is proof that on its way home an
important discovery was made. In 1636 Commander Pool was instructed
to sail to "Arnhems and Speultsland, situated between 9 and 13
degrees, discovered A.D. 1623. They are vast lands." On the return
of Pool's ships it was reported that they had "discovered vast
lands to which they gave the names of Van Diemen's and Maria land,
and which we suspect to be Arnhem's and Speult's islands, though
they extend in another direction than the latter." "Owing to
untimely separation," says a record of 1644, "the yacht
<i>Arnhem</i>, after discovering the large islands of Arnhem and
Speult, returned to Amboyna."</p>
<p>Later maps enable us to interpret these phrases with certainty,
and to understand with some exactness what happened to the
<i>Arnhem</i> after separation "with malice prepense" from the
<i>Pera</i>. On the following days Easterly winds blew. If the crew
of the <i>Arnhem</i> had intended to go to Aru to have a good time,
they had to abandon that intention. They were blown across the
great Gulf, the existence of which had been suspected; and, on the
other side, they discovered "islands" and "vast lands," to which
they gave the names of their ship and of the Governor of Amboyna
who had sent them. "Speultland," the land of the wicked governor,
villain of the Amboyna massacre, has happily vanished from the map.
Professor Heeres guesses that it was Groote Eylandt. But the land
to the West of the Gulf is still named "Arnhem's Land." It is the
same vast land which Pool's men rediscovered in 1636, and named
after the new Governor-General Van Diemen and his wife Maria, the
vast land round the gulf which is still named Van Diemen's
Gulf.</p>
<p>To the business mind the voyages of the <i>Pera</i> and the
<i>Arnhem</i> were complete failures. They had found "nothing worth
mentioning." Yet their services to the growth of geographic
knowledge had been considerable. In terms of the modern map they
had traced the length of the Eastern coast, and had obtained some
knowledge of the Western coast, of the great Gulf which eventually
received the name of Governor-General Carpentier. We must, however,
be careful to observe that there was as yet no knowledge of the
bottom of the Gulf, no knowledge even that it was a Gulf. It was
still possible to guess that it was rather the opening of some
great Ocean passage to the South, dividing the land of Nova Guinea
(Cape York peninsula) from Arnhem's Land, and the Great South land
of Eendracht.</p>
<p><a name="gulden-seepaart" id="gulden-seepaart"></a>In January
1627 a voyage of singular interest was made, of which we have
hardly any information. "The Daily Register of what has happened
here at Batavia from the 1st of January, 1627" has, Professor
Heeres tells us, this entry: "On the 10th of April there arrived
here from the Netherlands the ship <i>Gulden Seepaart</i>, fitted
out by the Zealand Chamber, having on board the Hon. Peter Nuyts,
Extra-ordinary Councillor of India, having sailed from there on the
22nd of May, 1626."</p>

<p>"The Daily Register" gives no hint that anything remarkable had
happened on the voyage and no journal or letter has survived to
tell its story. Yet there is evidence that this ship, which sailed
under skipper Fran&ccedil;ois Thijssen, had made discoveries of very
remarkable interest. Gerritz's map of 1627 ends Southward at the
"Landt van de Leeuwin," discovered in 1622. But there is another
map by Gerritz,<sup>*</sup> which, though dated 1618, contains
facts of a later date. One is inclined to guess that 1618 is a
printer's mistake, and that the true date is 1628. And on this map
the coastline runs Eastwards from the land of Leeuwin, past (to use
modern terms) King George's Sound, past the Mount Barrens and Mount
Arids described by Flinders, past the hundred and forty-five
leagues of cliffs which line the Australian Bight, and past the
head of the Bight to Fowler's Bay; while, slightly further again to
the South-East, are shown two groups of tiny islands which are
called, as they are still called on the modern map, the islands St.
Francis and St. Peter. At the back of the long bare coastline is
the inscription "'t Landt van P. Nuyts, discovered by the <i>Gulden
Zeepaerdt</i> of Middleburgh, 26 Jan., 1627." Our only other
information is the statement in a document of 1644 that, "in the
year 1627, the South coast of the great South-land was accidently
discovered by the ship the <i>Gulde Zeepaert</i>, outward bound
from the Fatherland, for the space of one thousand miles" (250
Dutch miles).<sup>**</sup></p>

<p class="note">[** <i>Tasman</i>, ed. Heeres, p. 148. It will be
noted that the name of the ship is spelt in various ways. Heeres
writes <i>Gulden Zeepaard</i>.]</p>
<p>That is the whole of our knowledge. For the rest, we are left to
conjecture. We may guess that the <i>Gulden Seepaart</i>, sailing
by accident out of the ordinary route, saw the South coast Eastward
of the Land of Leeuwin, and, remembering perhaps the scheme which
Coen had drawn up in 1622, was tempted to follow the unknown coast
Eastward, did so for what seemed to them one thousand miles, and,
then returning, gave the new land the name of their distinguished
passenger the Hon. Pieter Nuyts, and called the two little groups
of islands which marked their furthest East by the sanctified names
of the same "Extraordinary Councillor" and of the ship's
skipper.</p>
<p>What report the Councillor and the Skipper made as to the
character of land discovered we do not know. But we may form a
guess sufficiently accurate by reading the reports of the
navigators who next followed in their tracks&mdash;a century and
three-quarters later! In 1792 the French captain Dentrecasteaux
sailed along the Western portion of the coast surveyed by the Dutch
in 1627, as far as the head of the Australian Bight. He gave high
praise to the accuracy of the Dutch chart, and he gave French names
to the Dutch discoveries! "It is not surprising," he writes, "that
Nuyts has given no details of the barren coast; for its aspect is
so uniform that the most fruitful imagination could find nothing to
say of it." In January and February 1802, Flinders surveyed with
most exact carefulness the whole length of the coastline discovered
by the Dutch to its furthest East at Fowler's Bay, and the islands
of St. Francis and St. Peter. The furthest East of 1627 was still
the furthest East of 1802. In what direction the unknown coast
trended, "whether to the South Eastward for Bass's Straits, or
Northward for the Gulf of Carpentaria was," writes Flinders,
"altogether uncertain"; and he was there, in the days of George
III., to solve the problem suggested by Dutch voyages which had
taken place when Charles I. sat on the English throne.</p>
<p>From 133&deg; to 146&deg; was still "traced upon the Charts under the
title of <i>unknown coast</i>." Like the French captain, Flinders
paid his tribute to the excellence of the Dutch Chart; "making
allowance for the state of navigation at that time, it is as
correct in form as could reasonably have been expected." And, like
the French captain, he wrote an account of the aspect of the coast
likely to suggest that the reason why De Nuyts told so little of
what he saw was that there was so little to see that was worth the
trouble of telling. We read of mountains called "West, Middle, and
East Mount Barren," of "sand and stone without the slightest
covering of vegetation," of soil producing "a delightful harvest to
the botanist," but producing nothing to the herdsman and
cultivator; "not a blade of grass, nor a square yard of soil from
which the seed delivered to it could be expected back, was
perceivable to the eye in its course over those arid plains." The
monotonous line of cliffs, five hundred feet high, and one hundred
and forty-five leagues long, looked like the "exterior line of a
vast coral reef," and suggested an interior of flat sandy plains or
water. The interior was, in fact, the "dreary and barren region"
afterwards described by Eyre in his narrative of one of the most
dreadful journeys ever taken by land. At Fowler's Bay, the point at
which the Dutch gave up their survey of the coastline, Flinders
found "the same ridge of barren land." In the islands he, like the
Dutch, found good anchorage, but he found no other good thing. The
islands were made of rocks and sand and chalk and "arid sterility."
The thermometer showed 98&deg; in the shade and 125&deg; in the sand. No
wonder that the Councillor Extraordinary, who visited the islands
in January, thought the time had come to sail home. One more voyage
had resulted in "nothing worth mentioning."</p>
<p>In 1628 an important discovery was made on the North-West coast.
A ship named <i>Vyanen</i> was driven ashore in about 21&deg;. "She was
forced to throw overboard eight or ten lasts of pepper, and a
quantity of copper, upon which, through God's mercy, she got off
again, without further damage." The Dutch then sailed two hundred
miles along the coast, but came home without obtaining any
considerable information respecting the situation and condition of
this vast land, it only having been found that it has barren and
dangerous coasts, green fertile fields, and exceedingly black
barbarian inhabitants." The new discovery is recorded in the chart
of Gerritz of "1618," which was apparently brought up to date in
1628. To the North-East of Willem's River, is drawn a detached
stretch of coastline with the legend "G. F de Witsland, discovered
1628." We have evidence that a man named Gerrit Frederikszoon de
Witt sailed on board the <i>Vyanen</i>. Opposite the coast are a
number of islands which are identified with "the chain of islands
of which the Monte Bello and the Barrow islands are the principal,
and certain islands of the Dampier Archipelago."</p>
<p>But the coast that was always interesting to the Dutch was the
coast of "the land of D'Eendracht." They had made this a regular
landmark on their way from the Cape to Batavia; and the difficulty
was to see it in about 26&deg; without running on the almost invisible
Abrolhos in about 28&frac12;&deg;. The cartography of the coast had never been
successfully accomplished, and Dutch ships were, said Coen, in
"daily peril." In September 1627; as he returned to Java for a
second period of government, his ship suddenly one afternoon "came
upon the land of D'Eendracht" in 28&frac12;&deg;. "We were," he says, "at less
than half a mile's distance from the breakers before perceiving the
same. If we had come upon this place in the night time, we should
have been in a thousand perils with our ship and crew." The danger,
he explains, was largely due to the fact that Dutch ships made use
of various types of maps, and that these various types placed the
Abrolhos in very different places. According to the "plane Charts,"
the ship was between three hundred and fifty miles from land.
According to the "Chart with increasing degrees," land was a
hundred miles away. According to the "terrestrial globe," it was
fifty miles away. And, according to facts, they were almost on top
of it. Here were matters to which most seamen pay little attention,
but they were "still daily bringing many vessels into great
perils."</p>
<p>Next year (1629) the greatness of the peril was shown by the
shipwreck of the <i>Batavia</i>, sailing under Fran&ccedil;ois Pelsart.
The shipwreck is the one coloured picture in the drab Dutch
narrative, and it is coloured in hues so ghastly that one is made
inclined to praise the usual drab. On the night of the 4th of June,
Pelsart, sick in bed, "felt the ship strike the rocks with a
violent horrible shock." The "Master," who had been in charge of
the steering, defended himself by saying that he thought the
whiteness of the froth was caused by the rays of the moon; and when
asked what was to be done, and in what part of the world they were,
replied that "God only knew, and that the ship was on an unknown
reef." It was evident, however, that the unknown reef was among the
Abrolhos, and that they were surrounded by rocks and shoals. No
land was in sight that seemed likely to remain above water at high
tide, save "two small islets or cliffs" and, "moved by the loud
lamentations raised on board by women, children, sick people, and
faint-hearted men," they thought it best to land the greater part.
Pelsart tells the story in detail; the difficult landing of one
hundred and eighty persons on one barren rocky island, of forty on
another; the brutal behaviour of the crew who made themselves drunk
with wine; the discovery that water had been forgotten; the failure
of the attempt to communicate with the fast-breaking ship, which
had at last to be left with seventy men on board "on the very point
of perishing."</p>
<p>The survivors on the waterless islands were "not in much better
condition." It was resolved that Pelsart should take a crew in the
pinnace, should seek water on the neighbouring islands or on the
coast, and, if none were found, should "at the mercy of God,
continue the voyage to Batavia." They found only brackish water on
the islands. The coast was "barren and rocky," they failed to land,
and were nearly overwhelmed by a storm. They sailed North, and the
coast "seemed to us a barren accursed earth, without leafage or
grass." In 24&deg; they saw smoke; and, concluding that smoke meant men
and water, six men swam ashore on "a steeply rising coast, full of
rocks and stones, and with the surf running violently." They saw
four black men, stark naked, creeping up to them on all fours, who
ran away in full career when approached. But they found no water,
and swam on board grievously wounded by the rocks. They landed
again in 23&deg;, and found rain-water in the cavities of a rock, and
"somewhat quenched our cruel thirst, which almost prevented us from
dragging ourselves along." But still there was no running water,
and the higher ground was still barren and unpromising, without
trees, shrubs or grass. They saw high ant-hills in all directions,
which from afar somewhat resembled huts for the abode of men. And
multitudes of flies "perched on our mouths, and crept into our
eyes." They went on to 22&deg; 17', and then struck for Batavia, where
they arrived on the 7th of July, "God be thanked and praised!"
Pelsart in his pinnace had sailed from 28<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&deg;
to 22&deg; 17<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>', i.e. from the Abrolhos to
North-West Cape. All this coast had been seen before, but not at
such close quarters. Pelsart's voyage established its reputation;
the reputation of a coast where there were no harbours or good
landings, no water, plenty of ant-hills and flies, a barren and
cursed soil, and bad black natives.</p>
<p>Pelsart was given a frigate for the rescue of the people on the
Abrolhos. When he reached them on the 17th of September, he
observed that smoke still rose from two islands. He approached one
of them, and a boat came alongside with four men who told a tale of
horror.</p>
<p>Jerome Cornelis, supercargo of the Batavia, was one of the
seventy men whom Pelsart had been forced to leave upon the wreck.
He floated thence upon the mainmast for two days, and came to land
on the larger of the two islands. In the course of the voyage he
had plotted with the pilots and some others to seize the ship, and
use her for purposes of piracy. He now resumed the old plan, and he
and his friends signed a compact to seize the ship in which Pelsart
would come to their rescue. They murdered all those on the island
whom they distrusted, thirty or forty altogether; but forty-five
joined pieces of wood together, and drifted to a third island on
which a man named Weybehays had found water. But the murderers
attacked those on the smaller island, and killed all the men. Then
Cornelis broke open the chests of merchandise, and clothed his
body-guard in scarlet, embroidered with gold and silver. But his
attack on the company under Weybehays failed, and he was taken
prisoner. This was the story that Weybehays now told Pelsart,
warning him that the pirate's still designed to surprise him. And
in fact two boats at once came alongside, filled with men "covered
with embroidery of gold and silver, and with weapons in their
hands." Pelsart threatened to sink them, they surrendered, and were
put in irons. The wreck was found to be broken into a hundred
pieces, but several chests of silver were recovered. Then Pelsart
held a Council to determine whether the prisoners should be tried
on the spot, or should be carried to Batavia. Their numbers were
large, and treasure was on board. It was decided that delay would
be dangerous, and the prisoners were tried, condemned, and
executed. Then Pelsart sailed from "these luckless Abrolhos." They
managed to land on the coast, and put ashore two
criminals;&mdash;"God grant that this punishment may ultimately
redound to the service of the Company, and that the two delinquents
may come off with their lives, so as to be able to give trustworthy
information about these parts."</p>
<p>Thus concludes a horrid story that seems to establish the bad
character, not only of D'Eendrachtsland, but also of the service of
the Dutch Company. In Pelsart's narrative there is only one
pleasant remark. He saw on the islands, he says, "a species of cat,
which are very strange creatures; they are about the size of a
hare, their head resembling the head of a civet-cat; the fore-paws
are very short, about the length of a finger. Its hind legs are
upwards of half an ell, and it walks on these alone." Thus for the
first time is introduced to the European reader the tribe of
Kangaroo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile nothing had been done to carry forward the plan for
systematic exploration, which had been devised by Coen in September
1622. "Our Masters" in Holland were "instantly recommending the
discovery of the South-land," and the Batavian officials were very
willing; but they lacked ships, and were "prevented by voyages of
greater necessity." In January 1636, however, there became
Governor-General a man whose name is very famous in our story,
Anthony Van Diemen. As usual we learn very little about our
Dutchman, and as usual the little that we do learn is not
altogether satisfactory. "Our manuscript memoirs," wrote Du Bois in
1763,<sup>*</sup> "tell us that it was to escape the pursuit of his
creditors that he decided to go to the Indies, under a borrowed
name, and with a title that hardly distinguished him from the
common soldiers; but his extraordinary skill in the art of writing,
and certain <i>Placets</i> which he drew up for his comrades, were
so admired that the Governor-General of the time took him as clerk
in the secretariate." The fortunate clerk soon became "Ordinary
Councillor of the Indies," "Director General," Admiral of the
fleet, "First Councillor and Director General," and finally
Governor-General in January 1636. So good was it in Batavia to have
this "extraordinary skill in the art of writing."</p>
<p class="note">[* Du Bois, p. 116.]</p>
<p>Van Diemen was a reader as well as a writer. He read those
memorials of Quiros that had been printed and translated, and he
hoped to realise some of the great Spanish ambition in Dutch form.
But his first thought was to push the scheme of exploration which
had been mapped by his patron Coen. And, in February 1636, he
issued "Instructions for Commander Gerrit Thomasz Pool," who was to
explore the lands East of Banda, and furthermore "the South-lands
thence extending to the South-West."</p>
<p>Let us realise what in 1636 was known, and what was unknown, of
the coasts of "the South-lands." The Dutch knew the West coast of
Cape York Peninsula. They called it Nova Guinea, and thought that
it was probably continuous with our New Guinea, which they called
"the West end of Nova Guinea." They had some little knowledge also
of Arnhem Land; but they had no knowledge of any land between Cape
York Peninsula and Arnhem Land. They called the sea between these
two lands the Gulf of Carpentaria, apparently because, when the
<i>Pera</i> and the <i>Arnhem</i> returned from the voyage of 1623,
the name of the Governor-General was Carpentier. But <i>was</i> it
a Gulf? Or was it the opening of a passage to the South Sea? Who
could say? Then West of Arnhem Land, again, there was a huge gap in
Dutch knowledge, till you came to our Barrow Island and North-West
Cape in about 21&deg;, where began the land of D'Eendracht, well enough
known as a very dangerous landmark. Was this huge gap between
Arnhem Land and D'Eendracht Land all land, or was it all water, or
was it islands and Ocean passages? From D'Eendracht Land, the Dutch
drew the outline of the coast Southward and then Eastward, all the
way to our Fowler's Bay, and to the Islands of St. Francis and St.
Peter. And there knowledge ended. Was there land further East? Or
would it be possible to sail thence Northward up an East coast of
D'Ecndracht Land, till you found yourself in the Gulf of
Carpentaria with Nova Guinea on your right? Here were problems that
were interesting, and whose solution might be profitable. Landings
had so far been disappointing; but the early landings of Columbus
had also been disappointing. Here in the South was Marco Polo's
land of "Beach," and any moment you might sail into a rich and
civilised Kingdom, abounding in spices, in elephants, and in
gold.</p>
<p>Van Diemen instructed Pool to sail from Banda to Arnhem Land.
Then he was to cross to Nova Guinea, and to sail down its coast to
17&deg; 8', the furthest South of the voyage of 1623, and then beyond!
Van Diemen believed that this land of Nova Guinea joined the land
of D'Eendracht by an unbroken coastline, though no doubt this was
an uncertain speculation. Pool was therefore instructed to attempt
to follow the coast from 17&deg; 8' to "as far as Houtman's Abrolhos in
28&deg; and 29&deg;, and further still, if your provisions hold out, if the
condition of your crews will allow it, and if your yachts are proof
against the rough seas that prevail in the Southern Ocean in 33 and
34 degrees." Thence he was to return to Batavia, and to try, in
passing, "to touch at the Trials, that further information about
this rock, and its situation may be obtained."</p>
<p>Everywhere, and especially in the Northern part of the voyage,
Pool was to keep a sharp look out for the discovery of channels or
openings that might give passage into the South Sea, or prove that
the South-land consisted of islands. Such channels, if found, were
to be explored. In case it is found that the Gulf of Carpentaria is
no gulf but an opening of a great Ocean passage, Pool is to sail
the whole length of that passage along its Eastern side till he
reaches the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, discovered by the
<i>Zeepaart</i> in 1627. Thence he is to sail back Northwards along
the Western side of the passage to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
thence proceed on the route previously prescribed, Westward and
Southward to 33 or 34 degrees.</p>
<p>Pool is to look for the "Dutch delinquents" marooned by Pelsart
in 1629, and is to grant them a passage "if they should be alive to
show themselves, and should request you to bring them hither." He
is also to look in the coast between 26 and 28 degrees for some
"fitting place for obtaining refreshments and fresh water, seeing
that mainly about that Latitude scorbut and other diseases begin to
show themselves, at times carrying off numbers of men." The natives
are to be treated with "great kindness, wary caution, and skilful
judgement. Whoever endeavours to discover unknown lands and tribes,
had need to be patient and long-suffering, noways quick to fly out,
but always keen on ingratiating himself."</p>
<p>This grand scheme was not accomplished. In April 1636 Pool
sailed for New Guinea, but was "murdered by the barbarous
inhabitants at the same place where the skipper of the
<i>Arnhem</i> was killed in 1623." The voyage was continued under
Pietersen. But winds blew him to "a new land," which he called Van
Diemen's Land, and afterwards identified with Arnhem Land. He came
home with the report that he had seen "many fires and frequent
clouds of smoke, but no natives, houses, prows, or fruit-trees,
though he had paddled close along the shore with an orangebay, and
gone ashore in places, finding the shore wild and barren." The
addition made to Dutch knowledge was that Arnhem Land or Van
Diemen's Land was as "wild and barren" as all the other parts of
the South-land hitherto explored.</p>
<p>But Van Diemen did not abandon his high hopes. On the contrary
they rose higher. To complete discovery of the South-land was an
obvious scheme. But the South-land itself was but one part that was
being cut out of the unknown Southern world. In 1642 he and his
Councillors devised the plan of a general survey of the whole of
the South Pacific. They had been busily reading Quiros; and the
prologue to the "Instructions" which they issued on the 13th of
August, 1642, sounds like a curious Dutch echo of a Quiros
Memorial. It mentions "the highly renowned naval heroes,
Christopher Columbus and Americus Vesputius"; likewise "the famous
Vasco Da Gama, and other Portuguese captains." "With what
invaluable treasures, profitable trade-connection, useful trades,
excellent territories, vast powers and dominions, have the Kings of
Spain and Portugal, by these discoveries and their consequences,
enriched their Kingdoms and crowns!" And what "numberless
multitudes of blind heathen "have thereby" been introduced to the
blessed light of the Christian religion! "Yet, in spite of these
splendid facts," up to this time no Christian Kings, Princes, or
Commonwealth have seriously endeavoured to make timely discovery of
the remaining unknown part of the terrestrial globe, situated in
the South, and presumably almost as large as the Old and the New
Worlds, though there are good reasons to suppose that it contains
many excellent and fertile regions, like the gold and
silver-bearing provinces of Peru and Chili, which stand in the same
Southern Latitude, "so that it may be confidently expected that the
expense and trouble that must be bestowed in the eventual discovery
of so large a portion of the world will be rewarded with certain
fruits of material profit and immortal fame."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 131.]</p>
<p>The argument was the argument of Quiros, and the thought about
the salvation of "numberless multitudes of blind heathen" sounds
strangely in the mouth of a Commercial Company whose representative
in Japan was complaining that profits were being diminished by the
false and scandalous accusation that the Dutch were interested in
the progress of Christianity. The Councillors came to firmer ground
when they claimed that the Dutch possessed great advantages in the
prosecution of the work in which the Spaniards had failed. They had
as permanent base of their work the city of Batavia, "which is, as
it were, the centre of East India, <i>both known and unknown</i>."
Backed by the resources of a strong and rich Commercial Company,
the able Dutch skipper, with carefully chosen cargo on board, and
nought in his mind but pounds, shillings, and pence, would have far
better chance of profitable discovery than Don Quixote of Spain in
command of a ship containing all the virtues and all the vices of
mankind. It was the day of the Oceanic Gradgrind, and the Pacific
was a matter of fact.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "Thomas Gradgrind, Sir, a man of realities. A
man of Facts and Calculations. A man who proceeds upon the
principle that 2 and 2 are 4, and nothing over, and who is not to
be talked into allowing for anything over! With a rule and a pair
of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, Sir,
ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you
exactly what it comes to" (Dickens's <i>Hard Times</i>).]</p>
<p>The man to whom the Governor-General chiefly looked for
technical advice was "the renowned Pilot, Frans Visscher," a man
who had good knowledge of all the regions of the Eastern seas, and
who was thought to have "greater skill in the surveying of coasts
and the mapping out of lands than any of the steersmen present in
these parts."<sup>*</sup> So valuable was his assistance
considered, that Van Diemen, impatiently chafing against "the
unexampled delay in the arrival of ships from Persia and Surat,"
was forced sorely against his will "to detain him in this roadstead
(Batavia) for the space of nine months."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 100.]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Ib</i>. p. 105.]</p>
<p>Visscher spent the time well. In January 1642 he wrote a "Memoir
touching the discovery of the South-land,"<sup>*</sup> which laid
down the lines on which the famous voyage actually sailed, and
which is, moreover, of singular interest as indicating the vast
schemes now breeding in the minds of Dutch Pilots. The ships, he
says, should sail from Batavia about the middle of August, or the
1st of September at latest. By so doing they would "use the main
part of the summer season and the long days for making
discoveries." It was desirable to call at Mauritius to get water
and firewood. This meant a voyage of a month, and a stay of fifteen
to twenty days. Then they should "sail South with the sun" as far
as 52&deg; or 54&deg;. By that time it would be the beginning of November,
"when in those Southern regions the longest days are approaching,
together with the most favourable weather, and Northerly winds from
time to time." This would give three or three and a half months to
make the discoveries with minute care. In 52&deg; or 54&deg;, in case they
have met with no land, they should sail Eastward till they met with
land, or till they reached the Longitude of the East side of New
Guinea. Then, in the latter case, they should sail North by West in
order to fetch up New Guinea. Or, as an alternative plan, they
might run further Eastward as far as the Longitude of the Solomons,
and then keep a Northward course in order to "discover the said
islands which be spread over so vast an area that we could hardly
miss them." "This seems to us the best way of going to work, since
we do not in the least doubt that divers strange things will be
revealed to us in the Solomon Islands." They might return by way of
the North coast of New Guinea.</p>

<br>
<b>46. SKETCH FROM TASMAN'S MAP OF HIS VOYAGES, 1642-1644</b></p>
<p>But the scheme, adds Visscher, might take a larger form. The
ships might start from the Netherlands, sail to the Cape, run
Southward to 54&deg;, and then, on an Eastward course, explore the
whole South Pacific to the Longitude of the Solomons. Or, a still
larger variation, they might sail from the Netherlands to the
Straits of Le Maire&mdash;i.e. the straits through which Le Maire
had sailed in 1615 between Tierra del Fuego and Staten
Land&mdash;thoroughly explore Staten Land (suspected to be part of
Terra Australis), and then sail Eastward right away to the
Longitude of the Solomons, in a voyage that would explore the South
Atlantic as well as the South Pacific; "in which way one would
become acquainted with all the utterly unknown provinces of
Beach"&mdash;Marco Polo's Beach, still waiting, full of elephants
and spices and gold, for its new discoverer&mdash;"and could return
to Amboyna or Banda by the aforesaid route Northward of New
Guinea."</p>
<p>This would leave only one region of the Southern world
unexplored, the region between Cape Horn and the Longitude of the
Solomons. Visscher suggests that it would be well, in order to
attack this difficult problem, that the Dutch should possess "some
fitting refreshing station on the coast of Chili. Hence ships might
run with the trade wind to the Latitude 12&deg; to 15&deg;, "where the
Solomon Islands are currently believed to lie." If the current
belief proved correct, the ships could get refreshment at the
Solomons. Then "one would have to do one's best to get to the South
and to fall in with the Westerly winds, even if it were as far
South as 50&deg; or until land were met with." With these Westerly
winds one could sail Eastward again as far as the Straits of Le
Maire, or the ancient Straits of Magellan; by which methods one
will be enabled to discover "the Southern portion of the world all
round the Globe, and to find out what it consists of, whether land,
sea, or icebergs, all that God has ordained there." All that would
then remain unexplored would be the region between Nova Guinea and
D'Eendrachtsland. Visscher recommends a plan for its exploration
similar to that which Van Diemen had recommended in his
instructions to Pool. Let ships sail down the coast of Nova Guinea,
and go on till they come to 22&deg;.</p>
<p>Had Visscher been able to accomplish these great schemes he
would have left Cook little to do save to admire the work of his
predecessor. It was determined that an attempt should be made at
least to accomplish some large part of them. All conditions were
favourable. Governor-General and Councillors were "greatly inclined
to forward the navigation." The "Worshipful Masters" in Holland
highly approved. There was "no want of able skippers and skilful
steermen, much less, thanks to God, of victuals, and all sorts of
necessaries required for such voyage."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 137.</p>
<p>The trouble, as usual, was to find ships and sailors that could
be spared from "voyages of greater necessity." But the new peace
with Portugal gave an opportunity, "though for how long the good
God only knows!" Visscher had to be kept nine months in Batavia,
because of unexampled delay in the return of ships from Persia and
India. But, at last, difficulties were overcome, and on the 1st of
August, 1642, Governor-General and Council passed a resolution "to
despatch for the discovery and exploration of the supposed rich
Southern and Eastern lands, etc., the ship <i>Heemskerck</i>, and
the flute <i>Zeehan</i>." The commander is to be the Hon. Abel
Janssen Tasman, who "is now strongly inclined to this discovery,"
and he is to be "seconded by the Pilot Major Frans Visscher."</p>
<p>Of the Hon. Abel Janssen Tasman we have little knowledge, and it
is doubtful that we should wish to have more. The complete
researches of our modern Dutch scholar, Professor Heeres, while
robbing him of the one touch of humanity that used to be attributed
to him&mdash;his supposed love of the daughter of a
Governor-General who, it turns out, was daughterless&mdash;have
discovered not one fact, save superior technical skill, that could
give him favourable distinction among the crowd of "able skippers
and Skilful seamen," of whom there was "no want" in Batavia. His
services, remarkable as they now appear, were appreciated by his
employers in a singularly critical and grudging spirit. On the one
occasion in which his personal action came into prominence it was
greatly to his discredit, and seemed to reveal a nature
coarse-grained, and even brutal. The society of Batavia was not a
society likely to be squeamish in its moral judgment, but it
thought that Tasman in his later years was unworthy to serve it as
Church elder. In short, we are forbidden to imagine Tasman as a man
of heroic nature, of high ideals, or of personal charm. We must be
content to take him as Van Diemen and his Council took
him;&mdash;an able and businesslike skipper, whom they could wisely
trust to command the ships that were to make the Pacific a Dutch
Ocean.</p>
<p>Our modern scholar has proved that Tasman was born in 1603 in
the little village of Luytjegast in the province of Groningen. Of
his early years we know nothing, save the fact that he learned to
write, and "even showed no inconsiderable talent in committing his
ideas and experiences to paper; a gift uncommon among servants of
the Company."<sup>*</sup> A document of December 1631, which
records his intention to marry a second time, describes him as a
"common sailor," and as living in one of the poorest quarters in
Amsterdam. In 1633 he came to Batavia, as servant of the Company.
In 1634 he was skipper of a yacht; and from that time "we can trace
his career from day to day." We find him, in the records, seeking
safe routes among the dangerous seas, chastising rebellious
islanders, cruising in search of smugglers. His crew on one
occasion accused him of having sold their victuals to the natives;
but the accusation is held by the modern critic to be not
proven.</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 7.]</p>
<p>In 1639 Tasman sailed, as second in command, in a voyage to
discover famous islands which, according to a persistent story,
existed in the North Pacific, Eastward of Japan. Long ago, the
story said, Spanish ships had been driven by a storm to "a large
and high-rising island," where "gold and silver were almost to be
picked up at discretion on the shore," and where "the kettles and
other cooking utensils of the natives were made of these
metals."<sup>*</sup> Attempts to rediscover the island had failed;
and it was piously believed that "the Lord God, considering the
wickedness of the Spanish projects, may have frustiated their plan,
being unwilling to allow the poor natives to be robbed of their
heritage and possessions." The Lord God, in short, was reserving
another good thing for His Dutchmen. The Government at Batavia,
then, thought well of the plan. Likely enough the islands would be
found to contain good gold and silver, and would provide an
excellent market for cloth. The Directors in Holland pushed the
proposal with enthusiasm. "The gold-bearing island" would be the
one thing that the Company needed "to get over its heavy burdens,
and come into the real enjoyment of the profits of the East Indian
trade."</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 18.]</p>
<p>In June 1639 two ships sailed on this quest under a seaman named
Quast, with Tasman second in command. In case they failed to find
the golden islands, they were to explore Corea and Tartaria; for
trade with these countries, it was believed, would prove some
compensation in case, "contrary to our hopes, the trade to Japan
should prove less profitable in the future." If unfavourable winds
made this plan impossible, the ships were to sail to the Ladrones
"in order to find out the exact <i>Rendezvous</i> of the Spanish
ships" that sailed from America to Manila, so that "the Company's
ships may be enabled to cruise with more hope of success in search
of that rich booty."</p>
<p>These instructions show once more how far-reaching were the
Dutch plans. North Pacific as well as South Pacific must be
included in the Dutch Ocean. But the voyage was a failure. They
sailed over six hundred leagues to the East of Japan, but they did
not find the golden islands. They resolved to explore the coasts of
Corea and Tartaria, but were prevented by disease. They came back
"in very bad plight," having lost nearly half their men.</p>
<p>But the Dutch did not know when they were beaten. Though they
"had not seen any land, they had observed numerous unmistakable
signs of the same." Tasman was eager to be off again on the same
voyage, and the Directors determined to send him "in the course of
next year 1641." He made a Chart, which together with Quast's
journal, formed the basis of later exploration in the North
Pacific. But when the Dutch ships next sailed North, it was in
1643, and under another captain. Tasman was busy elsewhere. In 1641
he was engaged in the very lucrative but very precarious trade in
Japan, where the Dutch were vainly protesting that they, unlike the
Portuguese, might be trusted to make no attempt to convert people
to Christianity. He was also in Cambodia, chasing Cambodian ships
that sought to carry Portuguese goods to Japan. Early in 1642 he
was in Sumatra, dealing with a certain Chinaman, high in favour at
court, and "putting great affronts upon us." Tasman lured him on
board by pretence of friendship, put him in irons, and shipped him
to Batavia. Six weeks later, he was ready to take command of the
voyage "for the discovery and exploration of the supposed rich
Southern and Eastern lands," and "strongly inclined to this
discovery." Tasmania was to be not in North Pacific but in
South.</p>
<p>On the 13th of August, 1642, Tasman's "Instructions" were
issued.<sup>*</sup> They had been drafted by the Hon. Justus
Schouten, Councillor Extraordinary of India, and approved by the
Governor-General and Council. The prologue, as we have seen, was a
Dutch echo of the call of Quiros, whose name and exploits, however,
are not mentioned. But the business part of the instructions was
"drawn up in conjunction with Pilot Visscher," and in the main
expressed the recommendations of his Memoir. Tasman was to sail
next day, the 14th of August, with the South-East trade-wind for
Mauritius, where he was to take in water, fire-wood, and
refreshments. Then he was to sail Southward till he got into the
West trade-wind; and again further South "till you come upon the
unknown South Land, or as far as S. Lat. 52&deg; or 54&deg;." In case he
did not discover land here, he was to sail due East to the
Longitude of the Eastern point of New Guinea, or of the Solomon
Islands, or even eight hundred miles beyond. If land was met, it
was to be coasted Eastward to the same point; and all its features
were to be surveyed and mapped out by the able draughtsmen. Tasman
was to be careful to waste no time, and to make the most of the
summer season, and the favourable weather "when you will be able to
sail on by day, and by night alike." A great deal was to be
discovered in a short time.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. the summary of objects in the letter of the
Governor-General and the Council to the Seventeen, 12th December,
1642 (Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 138). They are asked to pray that
the voyage "may redound to the benefit and increase of God's
Church, and to the conversion of many blinded heathen, to the
profit of the Company's shareholders, and to the credit of our
country, and especially to the honour of the discoverers." The
letter also insists on the hope of discovering "a better and
shorter route from here to Chili."]</p>
<p>Tasman, however, was given permission to sail a different route,
should he choose to do so. Instead of sailing Eastward so far as
the Longitude of the Solomons, he might, if he preferred, seek to
complete the work of the <i>Gulden Zeepaart</i>, and to solve the
problem, which in fact remained unsolved to the time of Flinders,
as to whither the coastline of the South-land went from the point,
near the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, at which the
explorers of 1627 had left it. Tasman might, if he chose, sail
Northward to this point, and thence follow the coast Eastward "to
ascertain how far it extends, and whether the discovered South-land
joins Nova Guinea" (i.e. whether the coast of the Australian Bight
is connected in an unbroken way with Cape York Peninsula) "or
whether it is separated from the same by channels or passages." In
case Tasman found that the latter alternative was the truth, he
might sail through the channel or passage to its Northern end, and
thence, turning Westward, explore the mainly unknown region between
Cape Keerweer (on Cape York Peninsula), and Willem's River (the
Ashburton River?), the Northernmost limit of the land of
D'Eendracht. Tasman might take this course if, after mature
consideration, he thought it best to do so. But the
Governor-General and Council considered it probable that no such
channel existed. They thought it to be most likely that those lands
(Nuytsland and Nova Guinea) join each other without a break. And
their judgment was that it would prove better to follow the route
first proposed, and to keep on a far-Southward line as far East as
the Longitude of East New Guinea, or the Solomons, or eight hundred
miles beyond. One great object was to find a short route to Chili,
in order to "do great things with the Chilese, and to snatch rich
booty from the Castilian." And, on the whole, this Easterly course
seemed to offer the best chance of finding this route.</p>
<p>From his Easternmost point Tasman was, assuming it proved
practicable, to sail with the south-East trade-wind for the
Solomons. He was to explore them if he could find them; and thence
he was to "sail Northward and Westward, South or North of the
islands, if such they are, towards the East coast of New Guinea."
He was given a "Spanish description of New Guinea and of the
Solomons," and a "vocabulary of certain words of the languages of
the Solomons, New Guinea, and the adjacent islands." It was hoped
that he would come home able to throw light on the baffling
geographical problems bequeathed by Menda&ntilde;a, Quiros, and Le
Maire.</p>
<p>Having found the East coast of New Guinea, Tasman was to sail
the North coast in the tracks of Le Maire. At the Western extremity
he was to find some passage Southward, and to sail through it, if
possible, about "the unsettled month of April, in order to reach
Cape Keerweer (on Cape York Peninsula) before the Eastern monsoon
begins to stiffen." Then he was to sail Westward with this monsoon
till he came to Willem's River (Ashburton River?) i.e. the Northern
limit of the land of D'Eendracht. He was definitely to endeavour to
ascertain whether in the course of the unknown region he would
pass, and especially near Cape Keerweer and Willem's River, there
were channels or passages Southward, for such channels and passages
would be "of the utmost importance for getting speedily into the
South Sea." It was expected that Tasman would reach Willem's River
between May and July 1643, and he was to sail thence straight to
Java.</p>
<p>The natives were to be treated with kindness, and none were to
be carried off against their will. But caution also was to be
shown, "seeing it is well known that the Southern regions are
peopled by fierce savages." In spite of the expectations that had
been expressed&mdash;in words stolen from Quiros&mdash;of wealthy
lands in the unknown South, it is now declared, in plain Dutch, to
be "unlikely" that Tasman would "happen to come to any country
peopled by civilised men." If he did so, however, he was to treat
them with respect, and not to annex their country till he had
obtained their consent. He was to bring them to profitable trade,
and to conceal the fact that the Dutch valued gold and silver. The
ships sailed well prepared for any trade they might come to. The
Bill of Lading shows the Voyage of the South-land debtor to the
Office of Batavia for f.2965.16.12 for goods on board, which are
enumerated in detail in lists which illustrate the extensiveness of
Dutch commerce. Among the goods for which it was hoped to find
customers in the South-lands were silk, Guinea linen, Golconda
blankets, sandal-wood, Dutch steel and Surat chintzes.</p>
<p>Sixty men sailed on the <i>Heemskerk</i>, and fifty on the
<i>Zeehaen</i>. The ships were victualled for twelve months, and
had rice for eighteen. Two days a week were meat days, and one day
was bacon day. One mutchkin and a half of arrack was allowed each
day.</p>
<p>Tasman was instructed to keep "an ample and elaborate journal,"
and the instruction was well obeyed. He kept a "daily register,"
illustrated by careful drawings, and on this record was based the
"Journal or Description" which he handed in, under his signature,
to the Governor-General and Council as the official report of his
voyage. Extracts from it were afterwards printed. Cook and Banks
had one of these extracts on board the <i>Endeavour</i>, and highly
interesting they found it. Later,Banks managed to buy a complete
copy of the Journal. Recently Professor Heeres has published a
facsimile of the original manuscript which still exists in the
Colonial Archives at the Hague. It is written in the hand, not of
Tasman, but of some unknown Government official. But it bears
Tasman's signature, and is evidently based on the "daily register,"
which, it seems, has disappeared.<sup>*</sup> Thus it
begins:&mdash;"Journal or Description drawn up by me Abel
Janssen<sup>**</sup> Tasman, of a voyage made from Batavia in East
India, for the discovery of the unknown South-land, in the year of
our Lord 1642, the 14th of August. May God Almighty vouchsafe His
blessing on this work. Amen."</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 67.]</p>
<p class="note">[** The second name is sometimes spelled
<i>Janssen</i>, sometimes <i>Janszoon</i>. Tasman in his signature
wrote <i>Jansz</i>.]</p>
<p>They came to Mauritius on the 5th of September, having
accomplished in twenty-two days a voyage for which Visseher had
allowed at least a month. They came in condition so bad that some
explanation is needed beyond the difficulty of getting ships for a
voyage of discovery. The Governor of the island wrote that "their
outfit for a voyage of such a nature was hopelessly
unsatisfactory," and that the upper work of the <i>Zeehaen</i> was
"so rotten that a great part had to be repaired and renewed." They
left Mauritius on the 8th of October, having spent thirty-three
days there instead of the fifteen or twenty allowed by Visscher's
time-table. They were still, however, in good time. His point had
been that they must be at work far South by the beginning of
November; and on the 1st of November they were already in 47&deg;. On
the 6th they were in 49&deg; 4', which was to be their furthest South.
The weather had not been as good as weather should be in early
summer. A few days before they had been beset by "dense fog and
darkness," that made it "hardly possible to survey known shores,
let alone to discover unknown land." And now "the sea ran very
high, and our men began to suffer badly from severe cold." This was
discouraging. The plan had been to sail as far South as 52&deg; or 54&deg;.
But now, on the 6th of November, Visscher handed in a formal note
advising that they should make for 44&deg;, should sail along that line
of Latitude to the 150th degree of Longitude (i.e. the 130th from
Greenwich), then Northward to 40&deg; S. Lat., then once more Eastward
to the 20th degree of Longitude (the 160th from Greenwich), whence
they should make Northward for the Solomons.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Walker, p. 203.]</p>
<p>Visscher's advice was accepted by the Council of Officers on the
<i>Heemskerk</i>. In order to get the opinion of those on the
<i>Zeehaen</i>, the documents were enclosed "in a wooden
canister-shot-case duly waxed, and closely wrapped up in a tarred
canvas, which was set adrift from the stern-part of the poop"; and
"those of the <i>Zeehaen</i> hoisted the Prince-flag in sign of
approbation." So, by the 9th of November, they were in Latitude
44&deg;, and sailing an Easterly course. It was noted that the sea was
"still running high from the South-West," which seemed to show that
there was no mainland in that direction. On the 17th, they
calculated that in Longitude they had "already passed the
South-land, known up to the present, that is so far as Pieter Nuyts
had run to Eastward." There seems to have been no thought of taking
advantage of the permission that had been given to pick up the
thread of De Nuyts's discovery, and to ascertain whither his
coastline trended. Visscher preferred "gradually to deviate more to
the Northward"; a decision which left to Flinders, one hundred and
sixty years later, the task of discovering what lay to the East of
Fowler's Bay, and the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of November, they estimated they were in Latitude
42&deg; 50', Longitude 162&deg; 5' (from Teneriffe), and that "the West
side of New Guinea must be North of us. Next day, in the afternoon
about 4 o'clock, we saw land bearing East by North of us at about
ten miles distance by estimation; the land we sighted was very
high; towards evening we also saw East-South-East of us three high
mountains, and to the North-East two more mountains, but less high
than those to the Southward...This land being the first we have met
with in the South Sea, and not known to any European nation, we
have conferred on it the name of Anthony van Diemenslandt, in
honour of the Hon. Governor-General, our illustrious master, who
sent us to make the discovery; the islands circumjacent, so far as
known to us, we have named after the Hon. Councillors of India, as
may be seen from the little chart which has been made of them."</p>
<p>Tasman had come to the West coast of the island that now bears
his name. "It is probable," writes Mr. Walker,<sup>*</sup> "that
the first land seen was the mountainous country to the North of
Macquarie Harbour." The two mountains were identified by Flinders,
the voyager who next sailed that way, in 1798, and were named by
him Mount Heemskerck and Mount Zeehan. Sailing South, Tasman noted
on the 28th "an islet which in shape resembles a lion ("the
Mewstone"), and on the 29th "we passed two rocks of which the
Westernmost" ("Peter's Banks," says Mr. Walker, p. 130) "was like
Pedra Branca off the coast of China; the Easternmost was like a
tall obtuse square tower." "In the evening about 5, we came before
a Bay, which seemed likely to afford a good anchorage; upon which
we resolved with our ship's Council to run into it. We had nearly
got into the Bay, when there arose so strong a gale that we were
obliged to take in sail, and to run out to sea again under reduced
sail, seeing that it was impossible to come to anchor in such a
storm." The Bay is named on Tasman's Chart "Storm
Bay."<sup>**</sup> Furneaux anchored in it in 1773, and called it
"Adventure Bay." Tasman's name of "Storm Bay" has been transferred
to the wider opening, at the entrance to which lies <i>his</i>
Storm Bay. The gale which prevented him from anchoring where
Furneaux anchored one hundred and thirty years later prevented him
also from sailing the modern Storm Bay, and the River Derwent, to
the site of Hobart.</p>
<p class="note">[* Walker, p. 129.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See <a href="#il-48">Illustration 48</a>.]</p>
<p>Driven off from the shore by wind and current so far that they
"could barely see the land," they rounded "Tasman's eyland" ("the
Pillar" in modern maps), and "De Suyd Cap" (the modern Tasman
peninsula), and sailed Northward up the East coast. On the
afternoon of the 1st of December, it was resolved "to touch at the
land both to get better acquainted with its condition, and to
procure refreshment for our own behoof; and, about one hour after
sunset, we dropped anchor in a good harbour, for all which it
behooves us to thank God Almighty with grateful hearts." "The
position of the anchorage as shown in Tasman's Chart," explains Mr.
Walker,<sup>*</sup> "is North-west of the rocks now called Green
Island, just North of the basaltic cliffs of Cape Frederick
Henry."<sup>**</sup> The scenery, Mr. Walker tells us, is
"unaltered after two and a half centuries." The coast is still
"wild and rugged and scarcely known except to the hardy
fisherman...The country inland is poor, almost without water,
covered with thin gum forest, scrub, and meagre grass. It is only
the shore that is interesting. The rocky headlands, cliffs, and
islands, against which the ocean dashes are rent and scarred by
sudden fissures and chasms, into which the waves rush roaring and
tumbling. Between the points lie a variety of lovely bays, now a
broad white beach with long rollers of broken surf, now a rocky
nook, now a quiet and sheltered cove."<sup>***</sup></p>

<b>47. MODERN MAP OF PART OF TASMANIA</b></p>
<p>Next day (2nd December), early in the morning, Visscher was sent
in command of the boats to a bay four miles to the
North-West&mdash;the modern Blackman's Bay. They returned, bringing
samples of vegetables and making a report which, Mr. Walker tells
us,<sup>*</sup> is still "thoroughly characteristic of the Eastern
shores of Blackman's Bay." They had "found high but level ground,
covered with vegetation, not cultivated, but growing naturally by
the will of God, abundance of excellent timber, and a gently
sloping watercourse in a barren valley, the said water, though of
good quality, being difficult to procure, because the watercourse
was so shallow that the water could be dipped with bowls only."</p>

<b>48. TASMAN'S MAP OF ANTHONY VAN DIEMEN'S LAND<br>
(From <i>The Journal of Tasman</i>, ed. by J. E. Heeres.)</b></p>
<p>They had heard certain human sounds, and also sounds nearly
resembling the music of a trump or a small gong, not far from them,
though they had seen no one. They had "seen two trees about two or
two and a half fathoms in thickness, measuring from sixty to
sixty-five feet from the ground to the lower-most branches, which
trees bore notches made with flint implements, the bark having been
removed for the purpose. These notches, forming a kind of steps to
enable persons to get up trees and rob the birds' nests in their
tops, were fully five feet apart, so that our men concluded that
the natives must be of very tall stature, and must be in possession
of some sort of artifice for getting up the said trees. On the
ground they had observed certain footprints of animals, not unlike
those of a tiger's claws. They brought on board a small quantity of
gum of a seemingly very fine quality, which exuded from trees and
bore some resemblance to gum-lac. The land is generally covered
with trees, standing so far apart that they allow a passage
everywhere, and a look-out to a great distance, so that, when
landing, our man could always get sight of natives and wild beasts,
unhindered by dense shrubbery and underwood, which would prove a
great advantage in exploring the country."</p>
<p>Next day (3rd December), the two boats put off again for the
shore to take formal possession. "We carried with us a pole with
the Company's mark carved into it, and a Prince-flag to be set up
there, that those who come after us may become aware that we have
been here, and have taken possession of the said land as our lawful
property."A stiff wind and a high sea compelled one boat to pull
back, and prevented the other from landing. "We then ordered the
carpenter to swim to the shore alone, with the pole and flag. We
made him plant the said pole about the centre of the
Bay"&mdash;Prince of Wales's Bay, says Mr.
Walker<sup>*</sup>&mdash;"near four tall trees, easily
recognisable, and standing in the form of a crescent exactly before
the one standing lowest," which is a tree crowned by two long dry
branches, which "look like the large antlers of a stag," while one
of its lower branches looks like "the upper part of a larding pin."
Then "we pulled back to the ships, leaving the abovementioned as a
memorial for those who shall come after us, and for the natives of
this country, who did not show themselves, though we suspect some
of them were at no great distance and closely watching our
proceedings." Those who came after Tasman could not have failed to
recognise his landmarks had they come after him in reasonable time;
but a century and a half was to pass before they arrived.</p>
<p class="note">[* Walker, p. 134.]</p>
<p>Next day, the 4th of December, Tasman sailed Northward to seek a
better watering-place. He sailed past islands to which he gave the
names of Maria&mdash;who was the wife, not the daughter, of the
Governor-General&mdash;and the two Councillors Schouten and
Verdelius; the last of these islands has proved to be a peninsula.
"At this point the land fell off to the North-West, so that we
could no longer steer near the coast here, seeing that the wind was
almost ahead." A full Council was called, and it was decided to
resume the plan that had been interrupted by the discovery of Van
Diemen's Land, that is, to sail due Eastward to the Longitude of
the Solomons. This decision did not please the Governor-General and
Council. Some censure seems to be implied in the words of their
Report to the Masters at Amsterdam:&mdash;"which land they have
christened Anthony Van Diemen's land, without, however, being aware
how far it extends to North-West and North-East, and without
communicating with any of its inhabitants." Why did they not insist
on an interview with the giants who could climb trees in five-feet
strides? Why did they not inquire whether Van Diemen's Land was
connected with Nuyts's Land to the North-West, or with Nova Guinea
to the North? Tasman sailed away, and left these problems to be
solved by Flinders and Bass in 1798.</p>
<p>As Tasman sailed Eastward, he noted that heavy swells continued
from the South-West, which again proved that there was no mainland
in that direction. On the 13th of December, towards noon, he saw "a
large high-lying land being South-East of us at about sixty miles
distance." He had reached the West coast of the South Island of New
Zealand. He sailed Northwards, describing, both in Journal and in
Charts, the prominent features of the coast in such a way that they
can be easily identified by the modern student.<sup>*</sup> On the
16th, he reached a point at which "the land fell off so abruptly
that we did not doubt that this was the furthest extremity." In
fact it was the Cape which the next visitor, Cook in 1770, called
Cape Farewell, the Northernmost point of the South Island. Rounding
this point, they "saw a large open bay" and resolved to "try to get
ashore here and find a good harbour" (18th December). They
anchored,<sup>**</sup> and two prows came towards them. "The men
began to call out to us in a rough hollow voice, but we could not
understand a word of what they said." They also blew several times
on an instrument of which the sound was "like that of a Moorish
trumpet." The Dutch trumpeters replied, and the natives paddled
home.</p>
<p class="note">[* See exact explanation of the detail in M'Nab's
<i>From Tasman to Marsden</i>, pp. 4 to 15.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Tasman's anchorage was "in Golden Bay, off
Waramanga Beach, two miles W. by N. &frac12; N. of Separation Point"
(M'Nab's <i>From Tasman to Marsden</i>, p. 9).]</p>
<p>Next day, they came again, but the Dutch again failed to
understand their speech by use of their vocabularies of New Guinea
and the Solomons. They got a good view, however, of the men, and
wrote the first European description of the Maori. "As far as we
could observe, these people were of ordinary height. They had rough
voices and strong bones. The colour of their skin was between brown
and yellow. They wore tufts of black hair right upon the tops of
their heads, tied fast in the manner of the Japanese at the back of
their heads, but somewhat longer and thicker, and surmounted by a
large, thick, white feather. Their boats consisted of two long
narrow prows side by side, over which a number of planks or other
seats were placed. Their paddles are upwards of a fathom in length,
narrow and pointed at the end. With these vessels they could make
considerable speed. For clothing it seemed to us some of them wore
mats, others cotton stuffs. Almost all of them were naked from the
shoulders to the waist." The draughtsman drew a picture of them in
exact accordance with this description.</p>

<p>The Dutch invited them on board by showing white linen and
knives. But they would come no nearer than a stone's throw, and
again paddled away. The Dutch, however, thought that their meaning
was friendly, and determined to anchor as near shore as they could.
Seven prows came out, but again no business could be done. So the
skipper of the <i>Zeehaen</i> launched his cock-boat, no doubt with
friendly meaning. Whereupon the people in one of the prows began to
paddle furiously, and rammed the cock-boat. Then "the foremost man
in this prow of villains with a long blunt pike thrust the
quartermaster Cornelis Joppen in the neck several times, with so
much force that the poor man fell overboard. Upon this the other
natives, with short thick clubs, which we at first mistook for
heavy blunt parangs (i.e. knives for cutting wood), and with their
paddles, fell upon the men in the cock-boat, and overcame them by
main force, in which fray three of our men were killed, and a
fourth got mortally wounded through the heavy blows. The
quartermaster and two sailors swam to our ship (the
<i>Heemskerk</i>), whence we had sent our pinnace to pick them up,
which they got into alive. After this outrageous and detestable
crime, the murderers sent the cock-boat adrift, having taken one of
the dead bodies into their prow, and thrown another into the
sea."</p>
<p>The Dutch "diligently fired muskets and guns," but the prows got
away. So the Dutch named the place "Murderers' Bay," and set sail,
"seeing we could not hope to enter into any friendly relations with
those people, nor to be able to get water or refreshments here."
They decided to sail Eastward along the coast in search of these
things.</p>
<p>And what was this second land that had been discovered? "It
seems," wrote Tasman, "to be a very fine country, and we trust this
is the mainland coast of the unknown South-land." That is, he
thought that New Zealand was probably a Northern promontory of the
great Southern or Magellanican continent, which was still drawn on
the maps. Now in 1616, as we have seen, Le Maire sailing on the
East coast of Tierra del Fuego had seen a land which is really a
rather small island, but which he thought was probably part of the
Southern Continent, and he had called it Statenlandt. The idea in
Tasman's mind was that Le Maire and he had discovered parts of the
same continent, and that it would therefore be well to use the same
name. "In honour of their High Mightiness," he wrote, "we gave to
this land the name of Staten Landt, since we deemed it quite
possible that this land is part of the great Staten Landt, though
this is not certain."<sup>*</sup> To the passage between Van
Diemen's Landt and the new Staten Landt "we have given the name of
Abel Tasman Passage, because he has been the first to navigate
it."</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres, p. 118, writes: "The <i>Statenland</i>
discovered by Tasman had afterwards conferred on it the name of
<i>Nova Zeelandia</i> or <i>Nieuw Zeeland</i>...The name was most
probably given after the voyage by Brouwer in 1643 had removed all
doubts as regards the insular character of the Statenland South of
South America." The earliest instance of <i>Nova Zeelandia</i>
seems to be on Blaeu's Globe which Coote dates 1647-1656. Cf.
Heeres, p. 76.]</p>
<p><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>The main object now was to
fight a way through or round this block of South-land, in order to
make the shortest route to Chili; a matter which the rulers of the
Company regarded as "the main point of the voyage."<sup>*</sup> For
this reason it had been resolved to sail Eastward along the coast.
If Tasman had persisted in this resolution, he would have proved
that he was right, and would have discovered Cook's Straits. And in
fact he did sail one hundred and twenty miles (30 Dutch miles) into
a Bay, "nothing doubting that we should here find a passage to the
open South Sea."<sup>**</sup> But to his "grievous disappointment,
it proved quite otherwise." The land seemed to close in upon them
from all sides, and they concluded that it was a Bay, and not a
Strait. They tried to get out of it Westward in order to follow the
coast to the North. But wind and tide baffled them, they were blown
and dragged forwards and backwards across the Bay, and they
anchored at last behind an island, in a place which they called
"Tasman's Road." Here Tasman noticed that a strong tide was running
from the South East. This seemed to make it at least likely that a
strait did after all exist, and he proposed that, as soon as wind
and tide should permit, they should investigate the matter. Wind
and tide, however, did not permit. When the weather cleared, the
wind was in the East. The search for the Strait was abandoned.
Tasman sailed Westward out of the Bay, and then steered a Northward
course, hoping that, since he had failed to get through the
obstacle, he would be able to get round it. The Dutch, then,
remained uncertain whether they had sailed into a Bay or into the
mouth of a Strait. Tasman's map made it a Bay&mdash;"Zeehaen
Bight." But Pilot Visscher's Chart<sup>***</sup> showed an opening,
that suggests, at all events, the probability of a Strait. Cook in
1770 found his extract from Tasman of especial interest at this
point; and he would have been still more interested had he been
able to consult the map of Visscher.</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 144.]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Ibid</i>., p. 21.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** <i>Ibid</i>., p. 112.]</p>
<p>From the 26th of December to the 4th of January, Tasman sailed
along the West coast of the North island in search of a passage
round it that would open the way to Chili. His Chart shows a
continuous coastline with features that can be identified. Then, on
the 4th of January, 1643, he saw a cape and an island. He gave the
cape the name of the Governor-General's wife, Maria Van Diemen; and
he named the island Drie Coningen Island, "because we came to
anchor there on Twelfth night even." "There was a heavy sea running
from the North-East, which gave us great hopes of finding a passage
here. The land falls away to Eastward."</p>
<p>Next day, Tasman sent the boats to see if they could get water
in the island. They returned with the report that they had seen
"good fresh water coming down in great plenty from a steep
mountain, but that, owing to the heavy surf, it was highly
dangerous, nay well-nigh impossible, for us to get water there."
They had also seen in several places on the highest hills from
thirty to thirty-five persons of tall stature, so far as they could
see from a distance, armed with sticks or clubs, who called out to
them in a very loud rough voice certain words which our men could
not understand. They had noticed that "these people in walking took
enormous steps or strides"; and, no doubt, they thought them akin
to the gigantic tree-climbers of Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Tasman had failed even to make landing on the new country, and
he decided to run on. The Eastward fall-away of the land, together
with the heavy sea running from the Eastward, seemed to prove that
he had rounded Staten Land, and had shown an open ocean passage to
Chili for those who wished to do great business, or to damage the
Castilians. His experience during the next two days confirmed the
belief. "The sea," he noted as he sailed North, "is running very
high from the Eastward," so that "the great swells," he wrote next
day, "now come from the South-East. This passage from Batavia to
Chili is in smooth water, so that there is no objection to
following it." It seemed to him that he had achieved the main
object of his voyage. His employers, the Governor-General and
Council, however, took a different view. To them it seemed that the
existence of the passage had not been proved. If Tasman had run a
few more degrees to the South he might, not unlikely, have come
upon land again; for Staten Land itself might extend to Le Maire's
Straits on the East of Tierra del Fuego, and there was no
information about the region between the discoveries of Tasman and
Le Maire. "All this," they said, "is mere guesswork, and nothing
positive can be laid down respecting unknown matters." Tasman had
been "somewhat remiss" in his investigations, and "as regards the
main point, had left everything to be more closely inquired into by
more inquisitive successors."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 554.]</p>
<p>Tasman little expected these arm-chair criticisms. To him it
seemed that he had been sufficiently inquisitive in murderous
Staten Land, and that he had made a good voyage. He now determined
to sail Northward for home. Anyone who wishes to understand the
incredible difficulties of navigation in the Pacific at this time
should read the baffling account that is given in the Journal of
this part of the voyage. The plan was to call for water and
refreshments at Le Maire's islands of Horn and Kokus, and thence to
sail by way of the Solomons for New Guinea. But though they had
fair knowledge of their Latitudes, their Longitudes were a matter
of wild guess-work. They did not know where Le Maire's islands
were; they did not know where the Solomons were; and they did not
know where they themselves were. And on all these insoluble
problems learned skippers and pilots debated and reported, as they
groped a way through the huge, unknown, and highly dangerous
ocean.</p>
<p>Their first object was to make sure that they were to the
Eastward of the islands which they sought. They therefore sailed
North-East, and, on the 19th of January, came to a group of islands
which Cook later named "the Friendly Islands." They called the
largest island "Amsterdam," "because of the abundance of
refreshments we got there." Another island they called "Rotterdam,"
"seeing that here we got our casks filled with water." There was
much friendly traffic in cocoanuts, yams, and hogs, in exchange for
nails and beads. They dressed a chief in a shirt and pair of
drawers, "in which he thought himself very gallantly attired."
Dutch musical experts performed on the trumpet, the violin, and the
German flute; "at which music they were greatly astonished." It was
noticed that the prows were shaped like those described by Le
Maire. They called the Roadstead Van Diemen's Road; and "to the
Bay, near which the King resides, we have given the name of Maria
Bay, in honour of the Honourable Consort of the Honourable
Governor-General Anthony Van Diemen." We note this unanswerable
evidence that Maria, whose name Tasman was writing on every island
of the Pacific, was the "Honourable Consort," and not the
Honourable daughter, of the "Honourable Governor-General."</p>
<p>Tasman was now sure that he was Eastward enough, and made sail
North or North-West, keeping a good look out for Le Maire's
islands, which were in Lat. 17&deg;. On the night of the 5th of
February in Lat. 17&frac12;&deg; they saw land, and next day they found
themselves "entangled between islands and shoals to such a degree
that we could with difficulty keep clear. The islands are eighteen
or twenty in number as we can count them, though it is quite
possible that there are more." They were, explains the modern
student, among the Fiji Islands.</p>
<p>But Tasman was puzzled. He believed that he was in the track of
Le Maire, yet Le Maire "did not find any such islands." The "Great
Chart of the South Sea" showed islands in this Latitude, but these
were eight hundred miles further West. But after a voyage so long
and so stormy "the proverb which says that guess-work often shoots
wide of the mark may well be applicable to us, and we be so far out
of our reckoning." In short the Dutch had not the least idea where
they were, and knew enough to be aware of their ignorance. Perhaps
the islands were Le Maire's islands. Perhaps they were the
Solomons. Perhaps they were the islands of Quiros. Perhaps they
fringed the Eastern coast of New Guinea. Tasman thought it wise to
ask for a formal expression of opinion from Visscher, and the other
chief officers, as to the best course. His own opinion was that "we
should from here run due North, as far as 4&deg; S. Lat., and then due
West as far as the coast of Nova Guinea, seeing that the weather we
now have is such that one might easily miss a known coast, let
alone an unknown one, and that we are in the bad season here, when
the South-East trade-wind and the North monsoon meet each
other."</p>
<p>The opinions of Visscher and the other officers were to the same
effect. Their problem was virtually the same as that which had been
discussed, and in a locality not very distant, by Le Maire and
Schouten twenty-six years before. Le Maire had wished to sail hence
Westward in search of Terra Australis. Schouten had victoriously
answered that this course would bring them on the South side of New
Guinea, among unknown and dangerous coasts, where a passage was at
best uncertain; for there was no knowledge of the route of Torres.
So argued Visscher now. It was true that their "Instructions"
seemed to suggest, in a phrase of horrible obscurity, that from the
Latitude of the Solomons, which were supposed to stretch from 7&deg; to
15&deg;, they should sail Westward towards the East coast of New
Guinea. But, argued Visschcr, "this could not be done without
incurring the risk of being cast aside into a Bay from which it
might be difficult or impossible to beat out again; and, since the
East coast of New Guinea is still unknown, it is quite possible
that there may be plenty of small islands and shoals to the
Eastward of the said land of New Guinea, such as we have already
met with before; and, having no secure anchorage in such rough
weather, in which it is impossible to keep a proper lookout, we
might happen to be cast on the shores, before we had become aware
of the same." His advice, therefore, was that they should sail
Northward as far as 4&deg; or 5&deg; S. Lat., in order to avoid all risks,
and "prevent our being thrown on a lee-shore."</p>
<p>Thus in 1642, as in 1616, the Dutch declined a voyage that might
have made them first discoverers of East Australia, and second
discoverers of Torres Strait. From the Fijis they made Northward,
in the tracks of Le Maire and Schouten, sailing wide of the
Solomons, coasting New Ireland and New Hanover, which were thought
to be parts of New Guinea, and coming to the North coast of New
Guinea in April. They hoped to find a passage through New Guinea,
sailing through which they would have had time to explore the
unknown regions between Cape Keerweer and Willem's River. The
Journal gives a view of "De bocht van Goede Hoop" (the Bay of Good
Hope), where "we hoped, but in vain, to find a passage." They had
to sail the whole long length of the North coast of New Guinea,
identifying the islands on Schouten's Chart, and making use of Le
Maire's vocabulary to ask the natives for hogs, fowls, cocoa-nuts,
and bananas. In the end of May, they came to "the extremity of New
Guinea," which, says Tasman, "consists of broken land that would
take more time in mapping out than we think necessary to bestow
upon it." It was already too late in the season for the voyage by
Cape Keerweer to Willem's River. Tasman made for home, and on the
14th of June anchored at Batavia. "Item, the 15th do. In the
morning at daybreak, I went to Batavia in the pinnace. God be
praised and thanked for this happy voyage. Amen."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. TASMAN'S VOYAGE OF
1644</h2>
<p><b>AUTHORITY:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>HEERES' <i>Tasman</i>.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="short">
<p>Governor-General and Council heard Tasman's "happy" news with
calmness. He had discovered two lands of an apparently unprofitable
character, and he claimed that he had discovered a passage from the
Indian Ocean into the South Sea through which ships might sail to
the gold-bearing coast of Chili; a claim that needed investigation
by more inquisitive successors. He had "found no treasures or
matters of great profit." Yet officers and crew should have their
reward: the former two months' pay, the latter one month's pay.
"Our Masters" in Amsterdam heard the news with calmness so great
that they did not think it worth while to say anything about
it.</p>
<p>Governor-General and Council, however, thought the news about
the alleged passage "promising" enough to justify another voyage,
which should seek to make way thereby to Chili, form alliance and
trade connections with the Chilese, and with God's aid obtain some
good booty in the South Sea. But the plan for a voyage in October
1643 was frustrated by new war with "the over bold Portuguese," who
were, no doubt, "bringing about their own destruction," but were,
unhappily, at the same time "doing the Spaniards such staunch
service that for the moment we are forced to leave the latter
unmolested in the South Sea, and elsewhere." But they resolved to
stand by the plan, and to send the voyage in September or October
1644, and "this time arms in hands." They are certain, they write,
that "something profitable will ultimately turn up in Chili." By
this time they had thought more wisely of the industry and
inquisitiveness of Tasman and Visscher. They had formed the opinion
that the voyage of 1642 was "a remarkable voyage, in the course of
which the great unknown Staten and Van Diemen's Land were
discovered, and a long-desired passage into the South Sea was
<i>found</i>." So Tasman and Visscher were again to take command.
And meanwhile, "in order to prevent their being idle in the
interim," it was decided to send them in February 1644 on a
preliminary voyage which should seek to clear up once for all the
great doubtful questions of the South-land, and above all the
question whether there was or was not a passage <i>through</i> it,
that would enable ships to take a short cut for the new route to
Chili.</p>
<p>The "Instructions"<sup>*</sup> directed Tasman to sail in
command of three ships&mdash;the yachts <i>Limmen</i> and
<i>Zeemeeuw</i>, and the galiot <i>Bracq</i>. He was to leave Banda
at the close of February with the Western monsoon, and was to
follow the coast of Nova Guinea to 9&deg;. He was "cautiously to cross
the Shallow Bay situated there" (i.e. Torres Strait), and to bring
the yachts to anchor on the South side. Here he was to "reconnoitre
the situation of the land, sending in the meantime the <i>Bracq</i>
into the Bay for two or three days to ascertain whether in this
large Bay there is any passage to the South Sea, a question which
may be in a short time investigated, either in this way, or by the
direction of the current."</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 147.]</p>
<p>Having settled this question, Tasman was to "skirt the West
coast of Nova Guinea" (i.e. Cape York Peninsula), as far as the
farthest point discovered in 17&deg;, and then to follow its line
Westward or Southward, "that it may be decided once for all whether
this land is separated from the unknown Southland; a fact which
might easily be ascertained from the heavy and slow swell of the
seas." In case a channel was found, separating Nova Guinea (Cape
York Peninsula) from the South-land (West Australia), Tasman was to
sail down it to the newly-discovered Van Diemen's Land of the
South; and at the same time he was to ascertain whether Van
Diemen's Land was an island, or was united to Nova Guinea or to
Nuyts's Land. Then, after a visit to the islands of St. Francis and
St. Peter, he was to sail back Northward, skirting the Eastern
coast of the South-land. Emerging into the open sea at the Northern
end of the supposed channel, he was to follow the coast Westward to
Willem's River; "after which the whole of the known South-land
would have been circumnavigated, and found to be the largest island
in the world."</p>
<p>This was the voyage that was desired. A passage between Nova
Guinea and the South-land (i.e. between East Australia and West
Australia), with another passage between Nova Guinea and Van
Diemen's Land, would provide a splendid short cut for ships making
from Batavia for the Northern end of Staten Land (New Zealand),
with a view to explore the "promising" route to Chili. The
"Instructions," however, admit that "it seems likely enough that
the land of Nova Guinea (East Australia) joins the South-land (West
Australia) without any channels, and consequently forms a whole
with it." The Gulf of Carpentaria, it is feared, is a Gulf and is
not the entrance to a passage. If this should prove to be so,
Tasman was to trace the coastline to Willem's River, "and fully
discover the same." Then, if wind and weather were favourable, he
was to sail on to Houtman's Abrolhos, and try to fish up the chest
of dollars which had been sunk with the <i>Batavia</i>, and which
Pelsart had, failed to get because a heavy cannon had fallen on top
of it. Then Tasman was to look for the two delinquents, whom
Pelsart had set ashore. And, at the same time, he was to seek a
convenient place, about 26&deg; or 28&deg;, for obtaining water and
refreshments, "which would be a thing highly desirable for ships
bound to India from the Netherlands." He was to take possession of
land by erecting a structure with an inscription declaring "your
fixed intention to send a body of men thither by the first
opportunity to secure this property by founding a permanent colony
there."</p>
<p>Tasman's Journal of the voyage has disappeared. Careful research
has only discovered the binding which once contained
it.<sup>*</sup> There remain, however, two testimonies that give a
fairly adequate report of the main results of the voyage, though
they leave us entirely ignorant of the detail of discovery.</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, P. 74.]</p>
<p>Firstly, we have a letter written by the Governor-General and
Council to the Seventeen Directors at Amsterdam, which gives a
short but plain account of the voyage and of its worth. The yachts,
they say, sailed in February, but "found no open channel between
the half-known Nova Guinea, and the known land of D'Eendracht or
Willem's River; they found, however, a large spacious Bay or Gulf
(the Gulf of Carpentaria), as shown in the annexed Chart and
Journal. Nor did they make any profit by bartering transactions,
having only met with naked beach-roving wretches, destitute of
rice, and not possessed of any fruits worth mentioning, excessively
poor, and in many places of a very malignant nature, as your
Worships may in great detail gather from the Batavia minutes."
Tasman "continually sailed in shallow water along the coast "to
Willem's River, and thence returned to Batavia in August. "What
there is in this Southland, whether above or under the earth,
continues unknown, since the men have done nothing beyond sailing
along the coast; he who makes it his business to find out what the
land produces must walk over it, which these discoverers pretend to
have been out of their power, which may be true to some extent.
Meanwhile this vast and hitherto unknown South-land has, by the
said Tasman, been sailed round in two voyages, and is computed to
comprise eight thousand miles of land (2000 Dutch miles), as shown
by the delineation of the coasts, which we subjoin for Your
Worships' inspection. Now it can hardly be supposed that no profits
of any kind should be obtainable in so vast a country, situated
under various zones, the South-Eastern part extending between 43&frac12;&deg;
and 2&frac12;&deg; S. Lat...Such things should not be done in a hurry, and we
would request Your Worships to rest assured that whenever
opportunity serves, we shall from time to time have everything
diligently and closely investigated by persons more vigilant and
courageous than those who have hitherto been employed on this
service."<sup>*</sup> Thus, once more, the arm-chair critics!</p>
<p class="note">[* Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>,p. 156.]</p>
<p>Secondly, we have another very useful source of information.
This is a chart made by Tasman in the same year 1644, which shows
on a single sheet the geographic results of the two
voyages,<sup>*</sup> and supplements in an interesting way the
meagre story of the official letter. Heeres says that, when he
wrote, the original of the map was possessed by Prince Roland
Bonaparte, who refused permission to reproduce it. Heeres assures
us, however, that the copy which he gives is "sufficiently
serviceable."<sup>**</sup> On it we follow the tracks of the three
ships down the Southern coast of New Guinea, and across the
"Shallow Bight" (Torres Strait), to the anchorage on its South
side. The Eastern coast of the "Shallow Bight" is drawn with a firm
hand. Tasman, if we take the map as complete evidence, had
satisfied himself that there was no strait. If, however, the lost
Journal were discovered, we might possibly find that, as in the
case of the similar question in New Zealand,<sup>***</sup> Tasman
knew that exploration had not been completed, and that the problem
was unsolved.<sup>****</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* <i>Ib</i>. p. 72. See <a href=
"#il-46">Illustration 46</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Ib</i>. p. 71.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** See <a href="#page279">earlier</a>, in Chapter
XV ("The main object now...").]</p>
<p class="note">[**** Tasman's map has the inscription: "The
Company's Nieuv Nederland. In the East the large country of Nova
Guinea with the first discovered South-land, forming all one
continent together, as may be seen from the dotted line near the
yachts <i>Limmen</i> and <i>Zeemeeuw</i> and the 'quel' de
<i>Brak</i>. A.D. 1644." {Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 73: a somewhat
different translation is given on the map which Heeres prints.} But
the "<i>dotted</i> line" near the track of the ships suggests, not
continuous land, but continuous difficulty. The <i>firm</i> line,
representing <i>land</i>, is drawn far away to the East, so far
away that land which existed there could not possibly have been
seen from the ships. It is a line which seems merely to express the
opinion that exploration beyond the "dotted line" of difficulty was
not worth while. Visscher's map seems to have had the same meaning.
It has been lost: but there is a careless English copy of it,
probably made in 1687, in the British Museum. It has the
inscription:&mdash;"This large land of New Guinea was first
discovered to joyne to ye south land by ye Yot <i>Lemmen</i> as by
this chart Francois Jacobus Vis. Pilot Major Anno 1643." But, here
again, it is the "dotted line" of difficulty which is near the
dotted line which marks the ship's course: the <i>firm</i> line is
far away to the East, and quite out of sight. See Major's <i>Early
Voyages</i>, p. xcvi, and Heeres' <i>Tasman</i>, p. 73.]</p>
<p>Then we follow the track down the coast past Cape Keerweer, past
Carstenz's furthest South in 17&deg;, and further along to the coast
now for the first time explored. We note Tasman's vain gropings for
a passage that should lead through the too-solid Continent to Van
Diemen's Land, the South Sea, and the route to Chili. Again and
again a promising opening proves itself a Shallow Bight and not a
Strait. Then the voyage goes along the Western coast of what has
been proved to be a great Gulf. Arnhem's Land is rediscovered, and
is proved to be the same land as the Van Diemen's Land of the
North, part of the island-continent now at last coming into visible
and connected being. Then the hitherto unknown coastline is traced
from Van Diemen's Land of the North to Willem's River; and then,
the time allotted having expired, Tasman abandons thought of the
dollars at the bottom of the sea at the Abrolhos, and sails to
Batavia, to be reproached because he has not walked over the land,
and has not increased the Company's dividends by trading with the
"naked beach-roving wretches" who were its only inhabitants.</p>
<p>As we look, then, at this map of 1644, we see the outlines of
"the Company's New Netherlands" as conceived after Tasman's two
voyages. From Cape York Peninsula to the head of the Australian
Bight, and a little beyond, the outlines are rightly understood,
though there are inaccuracies in detail which, in view of the
circumstances, seem marvellously little. The South coast of
Tasmania is known, but what lies between it and the coast of the
Australian Bight is not known. There may be a strait North of
Tasmania, but the probability perhaps is that Tasmania is part of
the continent. New Guinea is also part of the continent, though it
is true that even Tasman's definite verdict left men doubting
whether after all the Shallow Bight did not end in a practicable
strait. The South coast of New Guinea is well known, and also the
North coast as far Eastwards as New Britain and New Ireland, which
are supposed to be part of New Guinea. But nothing whatever is
known about the Eastern coast of New Guinea, though it has a
persistently bad reputation, and seamen strike North of it with the
greatest care. Nor is anything known of the region between New
Guinea and Tasmania, which must contain the Eastern coast of the
continent. Tasman can only draw a shaded line bulging widely
towards the East, to indicate a coastline which must exist
somewhere to connect what he had seen in the North with what he had
discovered in the South.</p>
<p>Tasman's voyages had been profitable to geographers, but very
unsatisfactory to shareholders. He had mapped the outline of a huge
continent, but it seemed to be as useless as it was huge. Van
Diemen and the Councillors, however, did not despair. On the
contrary their schemes grew larger. New trouble with the Portuguese
and the lack of fitting yachts compelled them to abandon the
voyage, that had been planned for September 1644, to make sure
there was a clear way round Staten Land to Chili. But they were
"strongly inclined," they wrote to the managers in December 1644,
"to further discovery of Tartary, and the Northern parts of
America, together with the South-lands recently discovered in the
East, and the Solomon Islands"; truly big enough projects! They
were convinced that gold and silver would be found, and convinced
also that mines were necessary to the Company's prosperity. They
still hoped also, with God's aid, "to attempt some good booty by
taking the enemy at unawares." As for Tasman's voyages, they had no
doubt been disappointing. But he had at all events outlined an
island of eight thousand miles, and it would be odd if nothing good
were found between 22&deg; and 43&frac12;&deg; S. Lat.! "Thorough exploration of
newly-discovered lands is no work for the first comer...God grant
that in one or other part of the world some prolific silver- or
gold-mine be hit upon, to the solace of the shareholders, and to
the signal honour of the discoverer."</p>
<p>But the Directors in Amsterdam were weary of Van Diemen's
brilliant policy. They had no interest in what Sir Joseph Banks
called "voyages of curiosity." Exploration must lead to business,
and Tasman had brought home nothing save the cargoes with which he
had sailed. Why desire to reach beyond one's grasp? The Company
already knew far more countries than it could possibly trade with.
Discoveries further afield would probably end in the advantage of
other more populous nations, who would burn Dutch inscriptions, and
gain a footing in the Eastern world fatal to Dutch
monopoly.<sup>*</sup> Directors did not think Tasman's voyage worth
comment; and they poured a deluge of cold water on the suggestion
of further exploration by more vigilant and courageous men. "We
cannot anticipate any great results from the continuation of such
discoveries, which entail further expenditure from the Company,
since they require more yachts and sailors." Nor did the Managers
think well of the proposal to seek gold- and silver-mines. "Gold
and silver are not extracted from the earth without excessive
outlay, as some would seem to imagine. These plans of Your Worships
somewhat aim beyond our mark, the gold- and silver-mines that will
best serve the Company's turn have already been found;&mdash;which
we deem to be our trade over the whole of India, and especially in
Formosa and Japan, if only God be graciously pleased to continue
the same to us." The Directors thought they could make more money
North than South; and they were right.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. Temple, quoted by Major in <i>Early
Voyages</i>, p. vi. "I have heard it said among the Dutch that
their East India Company have long since forbidden, and under the
greatest penalties, any further attempts of discovering that
continent, having already more trade in those parts that they can
turn to account, and fearing some more populous nation in Europe
might make great establishments of trade in some of those unknown
regions, which might ruin or impair what they have already in the
Indies."]</p>
<p>Van Diemen did not live to read this letter. He died in April
1645. His schemes were never again undertaken. The Directors, who
had hitherto urged a policy of exploration, had changed their
minds. The land of "Beach" was not what Marco Polo had proclaimed.
The dream of Quiros had been proved to be vanity and vexation. The
Company's New Netherlands was no second Peru. It was a land as
useless as it was huge, providing not even food and water, and its
people were beach-roving wretches, the poorest in the world, and
among the most malignant. The prospect of trade and booty in Chili
ceased to attract; for the Dutch <i>West</i> India Company regarded
these things as covered by <i>their</i> Charter. In short, the
shoemaker must stick to his last. The Company's business was trade,
and trade in the <i>East</i>. They already traded with "the whole
of India." That sufficed, provided that they maintained their
monopoly.</p>
<p>So Tasman's work in the South was finished. He was busy enough,
however, in other directions. Governor-General and Council had
damned his second voyage with even fainter praise than that with
which they had damned the first. But, on further thought, they were
willing to admit that he had "given reasonable satisfaction," and
possessed "the courage required to do additional good service to
the Company." They raised his salary from eighty guilders a month
to one hundred. He was employed to devise a better plan for the
waylaying of Spanish ships at the Ladrones. He was made a member of
the Court of Justice, with the duty of inspecting the ships'
journals, and reporting on them to the Council. He planned better
courses for ships sailing from Batavia to Ceylon, and to Manila. He
was sent to Djambi "to steal a march on our English friends" by
buying up pepper in enormous quantities and at any price. In 1648
he was sent as "an intelligent, experienced, and courageous
leader," in command of a fleet of warships, to "harass and injure
our hereditary enemy the Castilian" in the Philippines, the
Moluccas, and the Malay Peninsula. He achieved some "notable
feats";&mdash;captured a Spanish fortress, intercepted a
silver-ship, and did considerable damage in the Spanish
islands.</p>
<p>But, on his return from this voyage, he was accused before the
Court of Justice of having committed a dastardly crime. Returning
to the ships one night, it was said, after banqueting all day in a
certain monastery, he had seized hold of two young sailors, had
accused them of breaking a camp-order, and had been "bold enough to
appear as accuser, judge, and executioner all at once and in the
same person." He had made a halter with "a piece of tow-match," had
placed it with his own hands round a sailor's neck, had made him
stand on a bench, had ordered a soldier to climb a tree and hang
him, had taken the bench from beneath his feet, and had proceeded
to make a halter for the second sailor. But meanwhile the soldier
hangman, "becoming aware of the sufferer's exceeding agony, and
perceiving that the man had almost passed from life to death," let
go the rope so that the victim fell to the ground, where he lay
like a dead man for a while, the wales caused by the halter
remaining visible for more than three weeks. Such was the
accusation. Tasman denied its truth, and told a story which claimed
to prove that he had punished a serious offence in a lenient way.
But the Court refused to believe him. He was condemned to pay a
large sum to the plaintiff. He was suspended from the exercise of
his office and functions, and from the enjoyment of his pay. And he
was ordered to declare with uncovered head in the public court that
he had "against all forms of law, and of his own will, personally
inflicted the said infamous treatment on the aforesaid C. Jansen."
On the same day the Church Vestry gave notice that Tasman would be
removed from its membership.</p>
<p>The Council of Justice had "suspended" Tasman "from the exercise
of his office and functions," but had refused, in its mercy, to
pronounce him "incapable of holding any public functions whatever."
His reputation in morality was destroyed; but he was too useful a
man to remain unemployed. In the following year (1650) he was at
work again, and calmly requested a rise in rank and in salary. The
Governor-General and Council, "having taken into account his
abilities and services rendered," replied with equal calmness that
these "do not as yet deserve a higher reward." He must wait, they
said, "until such time as he shall be employed on more important
services." In January 1651, however, he was restored to rank and
pay "at his urgent request, and seeing that, in divers parts of the
world, he has rendered the Company good services, and may in time
to come continue to do so."</p>
<p>Of further service to the Company, however, we have no news. In
1653 he was referred to as an "ex-commander." He was sailing a
"private vessel" to trade on his own account. He was, moreover, one
of the largest landowners in Batavia. Here he died in October 1659,
bequeathing a sum of money to the poor of his native Dutch village,
and dividing his estate between his wife, his daughter, and his
grandchildren.</p>
<p>Tasman's character, as illustrated by the records, seems
singularly unattractive. The crime on the island of Baviauw
disgusted even the tough-hearted Dutchmen of Batavia. And there is
not one hint that could suggest a better side of his nature. Of his
capacity as a navigator there can be no question. His employers
with curious persistence disparaged the exploits that deservedly
made him famous. But their criticisms are unconvincing, and they
continued to employ him, even after he had been convicted of
brutality. The two voyages are of the first importance in the
development of our story. The voyage of 1642 proved that Australia
existed, separated from any Southern Continent by a wide expanse of
ocean. The voyage of 1644 brought three sides of Australia into
accurate existence on the map. Eastern Australia from Cape York to
the Bight still remained unknown, save for the unconnected strip of
coast in the far South which Tasman had discovered, and had named
Van Diemen's Land. Torres Strait remained unknown, the record of
its discovery growing dusty in some Spanish office. New Zealand was
thought to be some out-jutting Northern promontory of the great
Southern or Antarctic Continent that still remained unknown. Tasman
had made these great discoveries; and he had no successor till
Cook. When, a century and a quarter later, Cook sailed into
Australian seas, he knew no more about them than was told by his
mutilated abstract from Tasman's Journal, save that the reading of
Arias's Memorial had led Alexander Dalrymple to believe that the
tangled region to the South of New Guinea was not a Shallow Bay but
a Strait.</p>
<p>The surprising thing is that Cook knew what Tasman knew. The
Dutch Empire was founded on the principle of monopoly of trade; and
the best protection of monopoly of trade was monopoly of knowledge.
"It were to be wished," wrote the Directors in 1645, on hearing of
some fertile islands, "that the said land continued still unknown
and never explored, so as not to tell foreigners the way to the
Company's overthrow." In view of statements like this, it seems
surprising that foreigners were allowed to know that Tasman had
mapped the outlines of an island eight thousand miles in circuit,
that he had touched the coast of what seemed a solid part of a
great Southern Continent which, he believed, stretched from Tierra
del Fuego to New Zealand, and that he had discovered rich tropical
islands inhabited by friendly people. But it seems that the free
atmosphere of the Netherlands was unfavourable to the spirit of
monopoly in the sphere of knowledge. Linschoten's voyage, we
remember, had been quickly published, and had shown to English as
well as to Dutch the way to the Moluccas. Le Maire's Voyage had
also been quickly published, and several other Dutch voyages that
had taken Drake's way through the Straits. And now again the same
liberal policy was used. Already in 1652 a map was published, which
was dedicated to a Director of the Amsterdam Chamber of the East
Indian Company, and which showed the results of Tasman's two
voyages. In 1648 the people of Amsterdam began to build a new Town
Hall, and inlaid its floor with a map of the two
hemispheres&mdash;in order, wrote a Dutch poet-wit in 1656, to
teach us to trample on the World and to look up to heaven&mdash;and
on this map the discoveries of Tasman were depicted. In the
following years they were drawn in several maps, and became
geographical commonplaces. In 1701 Dampier, sailing the North-West
coast of Australia in the <i>Roebuck</i>, had "Mr. Tasman's draught
on board," and thought "he came not so near the shore as his line
shows." In 1674 an abstract of the Journal of 1642 was published,
and in 1726 Valentijn published the abstract which was so carefully
studied by Cook and Banks, as they solved the problem that had
baffled Tasman in New Zealand, and set forth Westward on a voyage
which sought to hit the Northern limit of Tasman's discoveries in
Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>With Tasman's voyage of 1644 the interest of the Dutch story
ceases. The Directors adopted a policy which regarded discovery as
a misfortune, likely to attract the Serpent&mdash;probably an
English Serpent&mdash;into the Garden of Eden. The rest must be
told briefly.</p>
<p>Dutch ships continued to sail from the Cape to Batavia by the
route that brought them near their dangerous landmark in
Eendrachtsland. From time to time, ships were wrecked, and more
ships were sent to rescue the crews, recover the freight, and chart
the dangerous coasts. In 1656, for example, the <i>Vergulde
Drack</i> was wrecked "on the coast of the South-land, on a reef
stretching out to sea about a mile and a half in Latitude
30<sup>2</sup>/<sup>3</sup>&deg;." Of one hundred and ninety-three
souls, only seventy-five reached the shore. The news was brought to
Batavia by one of the boats, with a crew of seven sailors, after a
month's voyage. Governor-General and Council sent a quick-sailing
boat to rescue the sixty-eight shipwrecked men, to explore the
coast, and to put it down on a map with its capes, inlets, bays,
rocks, sands, and shoals. The shipwrecked men were never found; nor
was anything seen of the ship except wreckage. But exact charts of
the coast were made, which still exist, and have been printed by
modern students.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Major, p. 81; Heeres' <i>Part borne by the
Dutch</i>, pp. 77, 78, 80.]</p>
<p>The usual unfavourable report was made on the character of the
land. "The South-land has on its coasts downs covered with grass
and sand so deep that, in walking, one's foot is buried ankle-deep,
and leaves great traces behind it...Further from the coast there is
a raised ground tolerably level, but of a dry and barren
aspect."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Major, p. 89.]</p>
<p>In 1685 a Dutch ship, making the voyage from the Cape to
Batavia, failed to arrive, and there was no news of her. In 1696,
after an unexplained interval of eleven years, Willem de Vlamingh
was ordered, on his way to Batavia, to search for news of the
missing ship. His search was fruitless, but in the course of it he
made a minute examination of the coast from about the Swan River to
North-West Cape, and drew a map which still exists,<sup>*</sup>
showing with accuracy and detail Swan River, Rottenest Island,
Hartog's Road, Shark Bay, and North-West Cape. He also left an
account of his voyage that should have interest, at all events, to
West Australians.</p>

<br>
<b>50. SKETCH OF VLAMINGH'S CHART, 1696-1697<br>
(From an engraving in Heeres' <i>Part bona by the
Dutch</i>.)</b></p>
<p>He made a careful survey, he says, of Rottenest Island, which
chiefly consists of "white and rocky sand," with no animals except
"a kind of rat as big as a common cat." They landed on the opposite
coast, and, "after an hour's march, came to a hut of a worse
description than those of the Hottentots." Then they came to "a
large basin of brackish water," which they found to be a river.
They ate the nuts of a fruit-tree, and, three hours later, says the
record, "we began to vomit so violently that we were as dead men."
Then they rowed up the river, six or seven leagues, though some
thought they had rowed ten, but "without discovering anything of
importance." The country was sandy, and the shrubs bore no fruit,
and were full of prickles and thorns. They saw plenty of black
swans and other birds, and they "heard the song of the
nightingale." And they saw, or thought they saw, "a crowd of men."
But "the men, the birds, the swans, the rotganzen, the geese, the
cockatoos, the parroquets all fled at the sight of us." The best
thing was that there were no vermin; "but in the day-time one is
terribly tormented with the flies." Thus wrote one of the first
boatful of Europeans who rowed up the Swan River, and visited the
site of Perth.</p>
<p>Then Vlamingh sailed North, making careful surveys, and landing
here and there. Everything he saw was very bad: "the soil dry and
sandy, and but little adapted for the habitation of animals, still
less of men"; "a great plain very barren"; "the country twice as
barren as what we had seen before." They saw mountains, and walked
to the top, greatly fatigued by the excessive heat; it was the 25th
of January. There was no water, and they nearly fainted from
thirst. "We could see our ships, and wished a thousand times over
that we were on board again." At last they found a great pool of
water "slightly brackish"; and made way back to the ships with very
sore eyes.</p>
<p>Then they sailed to Dirck Hartog's Road, and found that what had
been thought a peninsula was an island. On the island, nailed to a
half-rotten post, was the "common pewter dish" with the inscription
recording Dirck Hartog's visit on the <i>Eendracht</i> eighty years
before. Vlamingh took it away for a marvel, and erected a new pole
with a new pewter dish, which recorded both Hartog's visit and his
own, and which was found by the next visitors over a hundred years
later. Then Vlamingh explored the great Bay behind Dirck Hartog's
island. Here, if anywhere, one would expect to find the long-sought
place of refreshment for ships sailing from the Cape to Batavia.
The Dutch caught "three great sharks." Dampier, a few years later,
had a similar experience in the same place and named it Sharks Bay.
The Dutch also caught turtles, each big enough to provide a meal
for twenty-four. But the coast was "rocky, dry, and forbidding."
They dug holes to get water, but it was so salt that it could not
be drunk without injury to health. Sharks Bay was evidently not the
place for a half-way settlement. Vlamingh sailed on round
North-West Cape to Willem's River, where he "found ground but
little suited for anchoring."</p>
<p>From the business point of view, the voyage was the final
condemnation of West Australia. It had been minutely surveyed from
Swan River to North-West Cape, and it was an utterly hopeless
country from end to end. "Nothing has been discovered," report the
Governor-General and Council, "but a barren bare desolate region.
Neither have they met with any signs of habitation, some fires
excepted, and a few black naked men. Neither were any remarkable
animals or birds observed, except, principally in the Swan River, a
species of black swans, three of which they brought to us alive,
and they would have been sent to your Nobilities had they not died
one by one shortly after their arrival here." And this was Marco
Polo's Beach!</p>
<p>In 1705 ships were sent to explore the North-West coast. In
spite of Tasman's map, the idea persisted that, somewhere between
Cape Keerweer and Willem's River, existed a passage leading
Southward or Eastward to the South Sea. In 1699 Dampier sailed
along the North-West coast in the <i>Roebuck</i>, and had "a strong
suspicion" that Tasman's solid coastline was in reality "a kind of
archipelago of islands," and that somewhere behind this screen
there was perhaps "a passage to the South of New Holland and New
Guinea into the great Eastward." Dampier sailed on to Timor, and
perhaps explained his views to the Dutch Governor there, whom he
describes as "a civil, genteel, and sensible man." But it is also
likely enough that the Dutch were already aware of the inevitable
imperfections of Tasman's survey. Indeed one may reasonably guess
that Tasman himself gave information in his Journal of 1644, which
is now lost, that would indicate these imperfections, and the
necessity of further search on the long and difficult coast.</p>
<p>The Dutch, then, in 1705 thought it worth while to go over the
North-West again. The "Instructions" were to sail to "Van Diemen's
Land in Hollandia Nova" (i.e. the Van Diemen's Land not of the
South-East, but of the North-West), "which is said to consist
altogether of islands, a matter which will then be cleared up."
They were to sail thence Eastward, and to explore the whole Gulf of
Carpentaria. They were diligently to observe whether there was any
passage. But, in case such a passage was found, they were to take
special care not to run too far into it, "lest you should be
carried away by currents."</p>
<p>The Dutch seamen returned with the report that they had
thoroughly explored the "North-West corner of Van Diemen's
Land"&mdash;still the Van Diemen's Land of the North&mdash;and
their Chart still exists to prove the excellence of their work. It
covers, however, only the stretch of coast from Bathurst Island to
Coburg Peninsula. And, though the survey is far more accurate than
that of Tasman, the main features of this very difficult coast are
still misunderstood. Bathurst Island and Melville Island are still
represented as promontories. And Van Diemen's Gulf, which separates
them from the mainland, is still represented as a deep bay. Into
this "bay" the Dutch had sailed forty miles, without finding any
diminution in the saltness of the water. And it was "supposed by
our people that this inlet runs right through to the South side of
New Holland," and that there were other passages, both to East and
to West. "From this it seems to follow that the South-land in a
great measure consists of islands, a supposition not at all
improbable, considering that on its South side, from the point
called Leeuwin to Nuytsland, it is entirely girt and surrounded by
innumerable islands." The theory seemed to be confirmed by "the
rude and barbarous character and malicious disposition" of the
natives; for "such serious defects are much more generally found
among islanders than among the inhabitants of continents."
North-West, in short, was as bad as West; the best hope was that
you might be able to get through it to some better
land.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* King, vol. i, p. to6, writes of this voyage:
They explored "the great bay of Van Diemen, but did not reach its
bottom, having been very likely prevented by the strong tides,
which in the entrance of Dundas Strait are altogether
uncommon."]</p>
<p>To the Dutch the most interesting part of the South-land was the
Abrolhos, and on those fearful rocks our study of their story shall
end. Ships continued to be wrecked on them. Dampier heard over and
over again from several able seamen that ships ran aground there,
when they thought themselves to be a great way off. He guessed that
the Dutch had given that part of the land the name of "Indraught,"
to warn sailors that it magnetically <i>drew</i> ships <i>in</i>
too fast; though, in his opinion, "it is the nearness of the land
rather than any whirlpool or the like that surprises
them."<sup>*</sup> The Dutch charts, he believed, made the South
Sea too wide, and the Indian Ocean too narrow. Whatever the cause,
the shipwrecks continued, and the Abrolhos became a museum of Dutch
antiquities. In 1840 some Englishmen visited the
islands.<sup>**</sup> They found remnants of a ship, and near them
a copper coin of the East India Company dated 1620, which seemed to
suggest the wreck of Pelsart's <i>Batavia</i> in 1628. On another
island were relics of another ship, with a coin dated 1700, which
perhaps had been lost by some passenger on the <i>Zeewyk</i> in
1727. "On this island we found a large number of small glass
bottles about the size and form of Dutch cheeses, very orderly
arranged in rows on the ground; a few very large bottles of similar
form; some large brass buckles which had been gilded, and much of
the gilt still existed, also numerous small clay pipes, which
served to solace our crew with the help of tobacco, as doubtless
they had done long ago for former owners, and one brass gun with
vermilion paint still on the muzzle."</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>Again and again people had tried to find in the South Seas
something that was worth finding; and again and again they had
failed. The golden continent of the imagination had changed into
the Nova Hollandia of fact, eight thousand miles of sheer
uselessness. By the middle of the seventeenth century all hope was
abandoned by those who entered Australia.</p>
<p>And yet it was just at this time that a motive was stirring the
mind which was destined to accomplish that in which missionary zeal
and commercial push had failed, the motive of scientific curiosity.
It was, as Mr. J. R. Green has explained, in the days of the
English Restoration that the appeal of Francis Bacon was first
<i>heard</i>. With apparent suddenness the reign of Theology ended,
and the reign of Science began. The Royal Society was founded, and
scientific work was for the first time organised and endowed. And
Science could take for its province no region less extensive than
the World. The early transactions of the Royal Society show an
ignorance that would amaze the schoolboy; but they show also the
birth of that determined curiosity which was to launch ships to
complete the work of Quiros and of Tasman. And the first
representative of this determined curiosity was the pirate
Dampier.</p>
<p>That Dampier was a pirate was an accident. The fact was due not
to his character but to his times. In character he was akin, not to
Morgan and Kidd, but to Sir Joseph Banks and Charles Darwin. He was
a born naturalist of the most fervent class. The Somerset farmer's
boy came into the world in 1652 dowered with an everlasting
curiosity, an insatiable appetite for new experiences, the thorough
instincts of the scientific student, and an admirable capacity for
describing what he called "observables" in plain, accurate, vivid
English. He had it in his bones to be a traveller. His joy would
have been to travel like Banks in the <i>Endeavour</i>, or like
Darwin in the <i>Beagle</i>. But he was born a century too soon for
"voyages of curiosity." In another age his determination to travel
might have made him a missionary. He found as much interest in
missions as in other "observables," and his views about "virtue"
and "the fundamental truths of Christianity" were as orthodox as
those of a bishop. But, in the late seventeenth century,
missionary-voyages were not in fashion. Travel somehow he must, and
the best people to travel with in his days were pirates. Therefore
Dampier became a pirate.</p>
<p>He passed his boyhood on his father's farm, studying the
varieties of soil which it contained, and the natural produce of
each variety; a fact which he mentions in explanation of the
scientific character of his description of agriculture in Sumatra.
At school he learnt Latin, that stuck to him through life. Once in
Tonquin he had an interesting conversation with a French priest.
The priest told the pirate "what progress the gospel was like to
make in the Eastern nations"; the pirate told the priest how to
make gunpowder; and both priest and pirate were highly interested
in the conversation, though the pirate knew no French, and the
priest knew no English. They talked in Spanish; "and when," says
Dampier, "I was at a loss in my Spanish, I had recourse to Latin,
having still some smattering of what I learnt of it at
school."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Dampier, vol ii. p. 21.]</p>
<p>When his parents died, his guardian placed him with the master
of a ship, "complying with the inclination I had very early of
seeing the world." In 1670 he went a summer voyage to Newfoundland,
but was so pinched by the rigour of the climate, that he determined
never to go to that part of the world again. Then, receiving "the
offer of a warm voyage and a long one," he sailed in an
East-Indiaman for Java, where he stayed two months, gaining no
doubt some knowledge of, and more interest in, the world in which
Java was the centre, learning what the Dutch knew about the
Philippines, and the Moluccas, and the great dim regions of the
South. Returning to England, he soon grew weary of staying ashore,
enlisted in the navy, and was present in battles against the Dutch
in 1673.</p>

<br>
<b>51. WILLIAM DAMPIER<br>
(From the painting by Thomas Murray in the National Portrait
Gallery.)</b></p>
<p>Then in 1674 Dampier became sub-manager in a Jamaica plantation.
Soon, finding himself "clearly out of his element," he went to sea
again, and by coasting voyages became acquainted with all the ports
and bays about Jamaica. And now his fate was certain. Jamaica was
the metropolis of the pirate-world. Every sensible Jamaican seaman
was a pirate, and Dampier went with the others. But the
pirate-trade was in a bad way. It had been born in war against
Spain. But the unforgivable Spaniards had made peace, and the
"privateers, who had hitherto lived upon plundering them, were now
put to their shifts." The idler sort were content to continue in
"the privateer trade," which still went on in a meagre and
unsatisfying sort of way. The "more industrious sort" went to cut
logwood in the Bay of Campeachy; but even these "thought it a dry
business to toil at cutting wood." In fact the pirate wood-cutter
was probably the driest person in history. One of them, named Mr.
John Hooker, was once invited into a cabin where a great bowl of
punch containing six quarts had been brewed for the entertainment
of the company. "Mr. Hooker, being drunk to by Captain Rawlings,
lifted the bowl to his lips, and pausing a moment to say that he
was under an oath to drink but three draughts of strong liquor a
day, he swallowed the whole without a breath, and so, making
himself drunk, disappointed us of our expectations, till we made
another bowl."</p>
<p>Dampier sailed to Campeachy under a captain who vainly sought to
assuage this great dryness by deluges of rum and punch. Dampier
himself had no gift in the way of drink, and, as he somewhere says,
"abhorred drunkenness." He was in fact an abstemious and meagre
student, hardly worth eating, as a fat pirate captain afterwards
told him, when there was talk of mutiny and cannibalism. But the
life in the tropical forest was exactly the life he wanted. There
was plenty of money to be got, he says, "if men would be diligent
and frugal"; a phrase which surely suffices to stamp him as the
most ridiculous pirate that ever sailed ship! But, in truth,
Dampier cared no more for money than for drink. He went to
Campeachy for the same reason that took Wallace to Borneo. He
enjoyed the tropical forest as only a scientific enthusiast enjoys
one. Taking with him hatchets, axes, knives, saws, wedges, a
pavilion to sleep in, and a gun with powder and shot, he studied
the habits of monkeys, ant-bears, sloths, armadillos, spiders, and
other natives of the fascinating jungle.</p>
<p>But the logwood-cutter was a pirate out of work. When trade was
bad, he cut wood and drank rum. When trade revived, he preferred to
plunder and drink rum. Dampier went, without enthusiasm, the way of
his companions. They sacked Portobello, getting thirty pounds a
man. Dampier does not mention the fact among his "observables." No
one ever hated more than he to talk shop. He omits all professional
details, not because he is ashamed of them, but because he thinks
them uninteresting. If you wish to know these facts, he advises you
to read the professional work on piracy by "my ingenious friend Mr.
Ringrose." Dampier gets rid of uninteresting Portobello with a
phrase:&mdash;"the first expedition was to Portobel, which being
accomplished"&mdash;and he passes on to tell how his companions,
disdaining the dwindling and over-done trade on the Atlantic side,
"resolved to march by land over the isthmus of Darien upon some new
adventure in the South Seas."</p>
<p>They followed Drake's way over the isthmus, and tried to follow
Drake's way in raids on Spanish towns on the Pacific. But here
Dampier's narrative hurries at prodigious pace. And indeed his
ingenious friend Mr. Ringrose has a poor story to tell. The attacks
were muddled, and failed. They got as far as the island of Juan
Fernandez; the island which gave Defoe, who got all that was worth
getting from pirate-stories, the suggestion of Robinson Crusoe,
though for some reason he chose to shipwreck him, not on his proper
home, but on an island in the estuary of the Orinoco. The pirates
were told that many years ago a ship had been cast away on the
island. Only one man had survived, who had lived alone for five
years before a ship came: Robinson Crusoe the First. And now the
pirates themselves provided the island with Robinson Crusoe the
Second. Three Spanish ships suddenly appeared. The pirates hurried
away, leaving an Indian who happened to be on shore hunting goats.
They did not return. Trade went from bad to worse. Failures led to
quarrels, and Dampier joined a party who marched back over the
isthmus to the "North side." Here they joined various gangs of
ruffians, Dutch and French as well as English, and sailed about the
West Indies in the ordinary dull and dirty routine of the trade,
while Dampier busily wrote notes in his precious Journal; four
pages, for example, on the manatee or sea-cow, and two on the
cocoa-tree. At last the gang broke up, and Dampier went with his
share to Virginia in 1682.</p>
<p>Dampier lived in Virginia for thirteen months. Then came a ship
under a captain who, says Dampier, "was a sensible man and had been
some years a privateer." He and his friends had now "a ship of good
force in which they resolved to make a new expedition into the
South Seas." Dampier and his "fellow travellers" were easily
persuaded to travel with them. His motive was as plain as could be.
The "trade" he regarded as "lawful" but uninteresting. But he came
into these seas the second time, he says in plain and honest
language, "more to indulge in my curiosity than to get wealth." One
feels, in fact, that Dampier was hardly treating his friends
fairly, and they also felt this. Piracy is a serious trade, and a
man who undertakes it should undertake it in a piratical spirit. A
man who has no particular objection to the ten commandments, and
cannot even raise a thirst when in the Tropics, has no right to be
a pirate. Dampier was making use of an honourable trade to serve
his personal convenience. When he should have been thinking about
murder and loot, he was thinking about crocodiles and beetles. No
wonder his exasperated comrades talked of eating him. And, looking
at his portrait and remembering his habits, no wonder they
didn't.</p>
<p>The "travellers" sailed round Cape Horn, and made for Juan
Fernandez. The Indian, who had been left behind on the earlier
voyage, came down to the sea-side to "congratulate our safe
arrival." He had lived a Robinson Crusoe life for three years, in
such picturesque detail that Defoe had little to do but describe
and elaborate. Then they got down to business on the coasts of
Chili and Peru. Dampier gives only enough trade detail to make the
story hang together. But he has several pages about the varieties
of turtles in the Gallapagos Islands. Business was still bad. The
wicked Spaniards, when attacked, defended themselves. The pirates
waited for a treasure ship, and, when it came, had to run away from
it, glad to escape.</p>
<p>Then Dampier joined the <i>Cygnet</i> of London under Captain
Swan. Swan had been sent by London merchants to trade with
Spaniards and Indians, but his men had forced him to turn pirate.
They suspected, however, and with good reason, that Swan was on the
look-out for some opportunity to return to London as honest trader.
He was now persuading his pirates that a good plan would be to sail
North to Mexico, thence take the Spanish route to the Philippines,
and "cruise off Manila." Dampier welcomed the new opportunity to
indulge his curiosity.</p>
<p>In Mexico the Spaniards caught fifty pirates in an ambush, and
killed every one; but Dampier was happy, and wrote page after page
about Mexican indigo, cochineal, and vinello. The discouraged
pirates came to like Swan's idea of a cruise off Manila. But they
were "almost daunted" by the thought of the long unbroken voyage
from Mexico to Guam in the Ladrones, the half-way place of call for
Spanish ships. The Spaniards estimated the distance, with fair
accuracy, at two thousand three hundred to two thousand four
hundred leagues, and the length of the voyage at sixty days. But
the pirates had less than sixty days' provisions. Swan told them
that the English books made the distance less than two thousand
leagues, and that Drake and Cavendish, the last Englishmen who had
sailed that way, had done the distance in less than fifty
days.<sup>*</sup> "His reasons," says Dampier, "were many but
weak." However, they prevailed, and the voyage was made in
fifty-one days. Dampier afterwards learnt that the pirates had
planned, in case provisions failed, first to eat fat Captain Swan,
and then all those who had promoted the voyage. "Ah, Dampier," said
the Captain, "<i>you</i> would have made them but a poor meal."
Dampier, indeed, had lived on a very short allowance,
and&mdash;even apart from the suggestion of
cannibalism&mdash;thought that his health had greatly benefited by
his abstinence.</p>
<p class="note">[* In fact, Drake did the voyage in 68 days,
Cavendish in 45.]</p>
<p>At Guam, Swan sought not booty but refreshment. Spanish Governor
and pirate captain changed presents and compliments. Then they
jogged for Mindanao, one of the islands of the Philippines that had
not been subdued by the Spaniards. The idea was to get a commission
from the prince of the island to plunder ships about Manila, "for
our men, it should seem, were very squeamish of plundering without
license." They were made welcome. It was thought that they were a
company sent by the English East India merchants to settle a
Factory; and there was disappointment when they explained that they
had merely called for provisions. This put great thoughts into
Dampier's head. Why not accept the suggestion, and establish an
English factory at once? The natives had long "desired the English
to settle among them, and had offered them any convenient place to
build a fort in, giving this reason that they do not find the
English so encroaching as the Dutch or the Spaniards." Mindanao was
an excellent business site. Most, if not all, of the Philippines
were rich in gold. The Spaniards would trade in spite of government
restrictions; for "Spaniards can and will smuggle as well as any
nation I know." Thus the English would at last regain their lost
foothold in the Spice Islands. Their enemy would still be the
Dutch, who "being seated among the Spice islands, have monopolised
all the trade into their own hands, they will not suffer the spice
to grow on the uninhabited islands, but send soldiers to cut the
trees down." Yet spice was still to be found by those who knew, and
might be had in spite of "the little deceitful arts of the Dutch
seamen in these parts&mdash;I believe there are nowhere greater
thieves."</p>
<p>The pirates, Dampier thought, would make excellent merchants.
There were men among them who understood every useful trade. "We
had sawyers, carpenters, joiners, brickmakers, bricklayers,
shoemakers, and tailors;, we only wanted a good smith for great
work, whom we might have had at Mindanao." "We had a great
advantage above raw men sent from England, who proceed usually too
cautiously, coldly and formally to compass any considerable design,
for we were all inured to hot climates, hardened by many fatigues,
and in general daring men, and such as would not be easily
baffled."</p>
<p>Dampier discusses his proposal in a thorough way that enables
him to explain his views about the whole problem of the Pacific.
Suppose you have an English factory in the Philippines; how are
English men to get there, and how are they to get back? Not by the
Cape of Good Hope, for sailing that way you would have to pass the
Strait of Malacca, or the Strait of Sunda, or some other
Dutch-commanded Strait. To avoid the Dutch, you must go round Cape
Horn. Then you might sail up the American coast as far as you
chose, and thence make for the Philippines. But there is a still
better plan in Dampier's mind. Why not take the opportunity, as you
go out or come home, to get some news of "Nova Hollandia" and
"Terra Australis"? The reason of men's ignorance of these countries
is that, after rounding Cape Horn, they have "designed some
business on the Peruvian or Mexican coast," and have therefore
sailed North instead of sailing North-West. Dampier suggests that,
after rounding Cape Horn, you might "stretch over towards Nova
Hollandia." And again, "returning, you may probably touch somewhere
on Nova Hollandia, and so make some profitable discovery without
going out of your way." And, apart from Nova Hollandia, as Tasman
had shown, "all that vast tract of Terra Australis which bounds the
South Sea, is as yet undiscovered."<sup>*</sup> And Dampier can
himself add an interesting bit of information about Terra
Australis. For Captain Davis, one of his pirate friends, had told
him lately that, sailing in Latitude 27&deg; S., about five hundred
leagues from Chili, he saw a small sandy island, and that Westward
of it was "a long tract of pretty high land, tending away towards
the North-West out of sight." "This," comments Dampier, "might
probably be the coast of Terra Australis Incognita."</p>
<p class="note">[* Dampier writes very curiously about the
relations of Nova Hollandia and Terra Australis. His map shows
knowledge of Tasman's voyage. Yet he writes, "New Holland a part of
Terra Australis" (vol. i. p. 450); and also, "New Holland is a very
large tract of land. It is not yet determined whether it is an
island or a main continent; but I am certain that it joins neither
Asia, Africa, nor America." (!) Sometimes he uses Terra Australis
as equivalent to Nova Hollandia.]</p>
<p>Dampier thought that Captain Swan might easily have managed this
excellent design of a Factory, for at sea he "had his men as much
under command as if he had been in a King's ship." But at the
island they were getting out of hand. Those who had money lived
ashore with their Delilahs, buying them a ring or a wristband or an
armlet with half an ounce of gold at a time. Those who had no money
lived on board, and sent ashore for "rack and honey to make punch,
wherewith they grew drunk and quarrelsome." Then, by chance, some
of them came across the Captain's journal, in which he had
"inveighed bitterly against most of his men." Thereupon they sailed
away, leaving Swan and thirty-six men ashore. Dampier chanced to be
on board.</p>
<p>The plan now was "to cruise before Manila." They took some
ships, and Dampier wrote greatly about canes, and tar-trees, and
mangoes, and turtles, and bats as big as ducks. He was weary of
"business," and longed "to give them the slip." But they sailed to
Tonquin and Cochin China&mdash;where "women sit in the streets
selling dishes of tea hot and ready-made"&mdash;to Formosa, to the
Bashee islands, and Dampier makes us well acquainted with all those
seas. Then they determined to go to Cape Comorin. The direct way
was the Strait of Malacca; but they feared islands and shoals, and,
they feared still more English and Dutch ships. So they decided to
"go round on the East side of all the Philippine islands, and so,
keeping South towards the Spice islands, to pass out into the East
Indian Ocean about the island of Timor." This was "a very tedious
way," and there would be shoals in plenty but there would be no
English or Dutch ships "which were their greatest fear." "I,"
writes Dampier, "was well satisfied enough, knowing that, the
further we went, the more knowledge and experience I should get,
which was the main thing I regarded, and should also have the more
variety of places to attempt an escape from them, being fully
resolved to take the first opportunity of giving them the
slip."</p>
<p>They sailed through the dangerous tangle of Spice Islands, and
came to Timor. "Being now clear of all the islands, we stood off
South, intending to touch at New Holland, a part of Terra Australis
Incognita, to see what the country would afford us." On the 4th of
January, 1688, they saw land in Latitude 16&deg; 50', and came to "a
point of land," about three leagues to the Eastward of which was "a
pretty deep bay with abundance of islands in it, and a very good
place to anchor in, or hale ashore." In 1821 Captain King, after
making a careful survey of the coast, decided that the "point of
land" was Cape L&eacute;v&ecirc;que, the Cape at the West side of the opening of
King's Sound. King called the pretty deep bay "Cygnet Bay," and the
abundance of islands "Buccaneer's Archipelago."</p>
<p>Dampier had seen many lands and many peoples, but never had he
seen land or people so unpleasing as Australia and Australians. The
land was "a dry and dusty soil," that was "destitute of water
except you make wells," and that was entirely destitute of food.
The only trees they could recognise were the "dragon trees," which
were "about the bigness of our large apple trees, and about the
same height. The rind is blackish and somewhat rough; the leaves
are of a dark colour; the gum distils out of the knots or cracks
that are in the bodies of the trees." The other trees "were not
known to any of us," and none "bore fruit or berries." There was
nothing to eat except turtle and manatee, very little to drink, and
nothing whatever to carry away.</p>
<p>And the people were worthy of their land. They are, writes
Dampier, "the miserablest people in the world. The Hodmadods of
Monomatapa, though a nasty people, yet for wealth are as gentlemen
to these; who have no houses and skin garments, sheep, poultry and
fruits of the earth, ostrich eggs, etc., as the Hodmadods have; and
setting aside their human shape, they differ but little from
brutes. They are tall, straitbodied, and thin, with small long
limbs. They have great heads, round foreheads, and great brows.
Their eyelids are always half-closed, to keep the flies out of
their eyes; they being so troublesome here, that no fanning will
keep them from coming to one's face; and, without the assistance of
both hands to keep them off, they will creep into one's nostrils,
and mouth too, if the lips are not shut very close...They have
great bottle noses, pretty full lips, and wide mouths. The two
fore-teeth of their upper jaw are wanting in all of them...Neither
have they any beards. They are long visaged and of a very
unpleasing aspect, having not one graceful feature in their faces.
Their hair is black short and curled, like that of the negroes; and
not long and lank like the common Indians. The colour of their
skins, both of their faces and the rest of their body, is coal
black, like that of the negroes of Guinea. Their costume consisted
of a piece of the rind of a tree, and a handful of grass or
bough."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. picture of "natives of Western Australia" in
Stokes's <i>Discoveries in Australia</i>, 1846. Stokes describes,
in vol. i. pp. 88, 89, the natives of the districts visited by
Dampier. Cf. Martin's "Journal of Exploration in N.W. Australia" in
<i>Journal of Royal Geographical Society</i>, vol. 35, p. 284. When
Banks examined the natives on the Eastern coast, he noted that they
differed from Dampier's Westerners, especially in two respects. (1)
Their "absolute colour" seemed to be rather chocolate than black,
and (2) the hair "in some was as lank as a European's, in others a
little crisped, but in none resembling the wool of the negroes."
Banks thought that, for once, Dampier might have been careless in
his observations. The description of Stokes, and later explorers,
however, show that Dampier was substantially right. The colour of
the Westerners is black and their hair is often "curled" or
"frizzled," though not, we are told, woolly like a negro's.]</p>
<p>One of their "camps" was visited, but it proved to be "only a
fire with a few boughs before it" to keep off the wind. "They have
no houses, but live in the open air, without any covering; the
earth being their bed, and the heaven their canopy...Their only
food is a small sort of fish, which they get by making weirs of
stone across little coves or branches of the sea; every tide
bringing in the small fish, and there leaving them a prey to these
people, who constantly attend there to search for them at
low-water. This small fry I take to be the top of their
fishery...What Providence has bestowed on them they broil on the
coals and eat it in common. Sometimes they get as many fish as
makes them a plentiful banquet; and at other times they scarce get
everyone a taste...When they have eaten, they lie down till the
next low-water, and then all that are able march out, be it night
or day, rain or sun, 'tis all one; they must attend the weirs, or
else they must fast. For the earth affords them no food at all.
There is neither herb, root, pulse, nor any sort of grain for them
to eat that we saw; nor any sort of bird or beast that they can
catch, having no instruments wherewithal to do so." Their weapons
were wooden swords and a sort of lance.</p>
<p>Dampier illustrates the degree of their civilisation by an
incident that happened in the course of a visit to a small island
on which camped about forty of them. There were some wells of water
there, and the Englishmen proposed to take some of it on board in
small six-gallon barrels. It occurred to them that it would be
troublesome to carry the barrels, and that it would be a good plan
to bribe the natives to carry them by a present of "finery." So
they put on one "an old pair of breeches," on another "a ragged
shirt," and on a third "a jacket that was scarce worth owning,
which yet would have been very acceptable at some places where we
had been. Then we brought these new servants to the wells, and put
a barrel on each of their shoulders for them to carry them to the
canoe. But all the signs we could make were to no purpose, for they
stood like statues, without motion, but grinned like so many
monkeys, staring one upon another; for these poor creatures seem
not accustomed to carry burdens; and I believe that one of our
shipboys of ten years old would carry as much as one of them. So we
were forced to carry our water ourselves, and they very fairly put
the clothes off again, and laid them down, as if clothes were only
to work in. I did not perceive that they had any great liking to
them at first, neither did they seem to admire anything that we
had."</p>
<p>The pirates had touched at New Holland to see "what the country
would afford them." It had afforded them exceedingly little; though
Dampier had satisfied his desire, for "more knowledge and
experience" by vision and study of the miserablest and most
ungentlemanly people in the world. The pirates made a stay of nine
weeks, till the 12th of March, 1688; and it seems surprising that
they stayed so long. Dampier had been trying to persuade them to go
to some English factory, but "was threatened to be turned ashore
and left here for it." However, at the Nicobar Islands, he and two
others managed to make their slip away. They bought for an axe a
canoe "about the burden of one of our London wherries," and, in
company with four Malays and "a mongrel Portuguese," sailed for
Achin in Sumatra. They met a storm so ferocious that "our little
ark was in danger to be swallowed by every wave; and, what was
worst of all, none of us thought ourselves prepared for another
world"; and Dampier describes his reflections in a passage that
might have been written by Robinson Crusoe. On the twentieth day,
however, they came to shore, in desperate condition.</p>
<p>To recover his health he took a trip to Tonquin. Here, having
two dollars in pocket, he determined to have a walking tour, giving
one dollar to a Tonquinese guide, and reserving the other for
travelling expenses. In spite of his guide, he very nearly got into
serious trouble in one place, by mistaking a funeral feast for a
meat-market, and offering to buy a pound or two. Later he had the
interesting Spanish-Latin conversation over "a glass or two of
wine" with the French priest, which gave him opportunity in his
Journal to describe his own religious views. "The English and the
Dutch in those parts of the world," he says, "are too loose livers
to gain reputation to their religion. The Romanists are the only
men who compass sea and land and gain proselytes." On the other
hand while "the gross idolatry of the Papists" gives them an
advantage in their efforts to convert pagan idolaters, such
conversion from one idolatry to another seems to him of little
religious value. The first care of missionaries, says the
ex-pirate, "should be to bring the people to be virtuous and
considerate, and their next, to give them a plain history and
scheme of the fundamental truths of Christianity, and show how
agreeable they are to natural light, and how worthy of God."
However, the Catholic converts were, he understood, falling off
again "as rice grew plentiful."</p>
<p>Commercial rambles in the Eastern seas passed the time for a
year and a half. Dampier can tell you all about Tonquin and
Cambodia and Sumatra and Malacca, and many less known places. Then
he spent five months at Fort St. George by Madras&mdash;"as
agreeable a landscape as I have anywhere seen"&mdash;and another
five months as gunner in the English factory of Bencouli, on the
Western coast of Sumatra. Everywhere he describes all things, from
Christian missions to Mangostan and Pumple Nose. But his main note
is the call to English merchants to wake up, and claim their share
of the rich Oriental trade, which the Dutch have monopolised.
"Though men ought not to run inconsiderately into new discoveries
or undertakings, yet, when there is a prospect of profit, I think
it not amiss for merchants to try for a trade. If our ancestors had
been as dull as we have been of late, 'tis probable we had never
known the way so much as to the East Indies...What care was
formerly taken to get us a trade with the East Indian and other
countries!...But now, as if cloyed with trade, we sit still
contented, saying with Cato, 'Non minor est virtus quam quaerere
parta tueri.'" Had, for example, the chief of the English factory
at Tonquin been "a man of spirit," he might have got "a trade with
Japan; and to China as much as they pleased."</p>
<p>At last Dampier began to long for his native land. He had
acquired a half-share in a "painted prince," whose tattooings he
describes in enthusiastic detail. No small advantage, he thought,
would be gained by showing him in England. Then, with bags of
gate-money in pocket, the showman would return to the prince's
island, and engage in lucrative trade, under the prince's
patronage. Dampier reached England in 1691. But he "fell among
rooks," and had to sell his share in the painted prince, who was
afterwards shown as a sight, and died of the smallpox at
Oxford.</p>
<hr class="longer">
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. THE VOYAGE OF THE
<i>ROEBUCK</i></h2>
<p>The painted prince was dead; but, in spite of "rooks," one asset
remained, the precious Journal so diligently written, and so
carefully preserved through all adventure and disaster. It was both
a fascinating account of travel in strange lands, and a scientific
study of things seen. Students of science were now organised in the
Royal Society, and were there debating, with plentiful and
ingenious ignorance, subjects concerning which the ex-pirate had
first-hand and exact knowledge. In 1697 a large part of the Journal
was printed in a book dedicated to the President of the Royal
Society, Charles Montague, Earl of Halifax, one of the most
important politicians of the time. Dampier hopes that, as the scene
of his travels "is not only remote, but for the most part little
frequented also, so there may be some things in them new even to
you; and some not altogether unuseful to the public." He avows "a
hearty zeal for the promoting of useful knowledge, and of anything
that may never so remotely tend to my country's advantage." And he
is "desirous to bring in my gleanings here and there in remote
regions to that general magazine of the knowledge of foreign parts,
which the Royal Society thought you most worthy the custody of,
when they chose you for their president." He trusts that Lord
Halifax will "judge him capable of serving his country."</p>
<p>The President of the Royal Society judged Dampier capable of
serving his country. He introduced him to the First Lord of the
Admiralty, who consented to Dampier's proposal that he should be
sent in command of a ship to explore New Holland. One is at first
thought somewhat surprised to find that Dampier's special wish was
to explore New Holland. But he justly refused to accept the few
leagues of miserable country he had seen as a fair sample of "this
large and hitherto almost unknown tract of land, situated so very
advantageously in the richest climates of the world." To his
sun-worshipping nature it appeared that New Holland would have in
it "all the advantages of the torrid zone, as being known to reach
from the Equator itself (within a degree) to the Tropic of
Capricorn and beyond it." "In coasting round it," he wrote in his
Journal, "which I designed by this voyage, if possible, I could not
but hope to meet with some fruitful lands, continents or islands,
or both, productive of any of the rich fruits, drugs or spices
(perhaps minerals also) that are in the other parts of the torrid
zone, upon equal parallels of Latitude; at least a soil and air
capable of such upon transplanting them hither, and cultivation. I
meant also to make as diligent a survey as I could of the several
smaller islands, shores, capes, bays, creeks, and harbours, fit as
well for shelter as defence, upon fortifying them; and of rocks,
and shoals, the soundings, tides and currents, winds and weather
variation; whatever might be beneficial for navigation, trade, and
settlement;...I intended especially to observe what inhabitants I
should meet with, and to try to win them over to somewhat of
traffic and useful intercourse, as there might be commodities among
them that might be fit for trade or manufacture...Though, as to the
New Hollanders hereabouts, by the experience I had had of their
neighbours formerly, I expected no great matters from them."</p>
<p>The voyage, then, was to be&mdash;to use Sir Joseph Bank's
useful phrase&mdash;"a voyage of curiosity," a voyage "mainly"
aiming, as Dampier always "mainly" aimed, at "more knowledge and
experience." But there was also hope that this increased knowledge
and experience would lead to increased trade. Tropical New Holland,
including under that name New Guinea and the adjacent islands, was
fairly well in the Latitude of the Spice Islands. Why should it not
be made the centre of an English spice trade that should eclipse
that of the Dutch? It was an argument that persisted for a century,
and was used by those who, like Sir Joseph Banks and Mr. Matra,
urged the foundation of a colony in New South
Wales.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Part of it (N.S.W.) lies in a climate parallel
to the Spice Islands, and is well fitted for the production of that
valuable commodity, as well as the sugar cane, tea, coffee, silk,
cotton, indigo, tobacco, and the other articles of commerce that
have been so advantageous to the maritime powers of Europe,"
Matra's <i>Proposal</i>, 1783; <i>Historical Records of N.S.W.</i>,
vol. i. part 2, p. 2.]</p>
<p>Dampier was a man in some ways well qualified to conduct a
voyage of curiosity. He was probably the most curious adult
Englishman then alive; and his curiosity was that of a scientific
mind trained by ample experience. He was, moreover, a learned and
skilful navigator and Pilot. He had made special study of winds and
currents, and was an acknowledged expert in all the arts needed in
the navigation of a ship. He had some part of the equipment of a
Captain Cook, as well as some part of the equipment of a Sir Joseph
Banks. On the other hand, say our modern critics, he lacked the
qualities that were necessary to success, the qualities that make a
leader of men. And our modern critics are probably right.</p>
<p>And yet one feels that Dampier had been set a task in which many
a leader of men would have failed. The ship that was given him for
this voyage of exploration in distant and unknown seas was the
<i>Roebuck</i> of 290 tons. On the return journey she "foundered
through perfect age," after an attempt to mend the leak had shown
that "the plank was so rotten that it broke away like dirt." The
crew that was to sail this aged and rotten ship to the end of the
earth and back were men whose morality was probably as bad as that
of Dampier's pirate comrades, and whose ability was certainly very
much less. The seaman of Dampier's day, writes Mr. Clark Russell,
after a compliment to that seaman's intrepidity, had the
characteristics of the savage. He was "a ruffian in his behaviour;
he was a brute in his tastes; he conversed in a dialect that was
almost wholly formed of oaths, and he pursued his calling in a skin
soaked with liquor that was served out to him by the gallon at a
time." Dampier describes his seamen with his usual scientific
detail; and he makes me believe that they were, to write with
becoming shortness, incompetent, dirty, smellful,<sup>*</sup>
rebellious, murderous,<sup>**</sup> arid&mdash;worst of all&mdash;"
heartless enough to the voyage at best." Dampier, the ex-pirate,
had undertaken to keep in order this gang of brutal ruffians; and,
in dealing with them, he had to bear the blame of the piratical
reputation unsupported by the strength of the piratical character.
"Anyone," he says very justly, "who is sensible of these
difficulties will be much more pleased at the discoveries and
observations I have been able to make than displeased that I did
not make more."<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* They caused an ill-smell wherever they went and
their hammocks would stink sufficiently."]</p>
<p class="note">[** He found it was not safe to sleep in his cabin,
and was forced to lie on the quarter-deck with such officers as he
could trust, and "with small arms handy."]</p>
<p class="note">[*** <i>Voyages</i>, vol. ii. p. 343.]</p>
<p>Dampier's excellent plan had been to sail round Cape Horn, and
begin his discoveries upon "the Eastern or less known side of the
Terra Australis." Had he donc so, he might have left Cook little to
do. But this plan was thwarted, he says, by the time of the year.
Sailing on the 14th of January, 1699&mdash;apparently he <i>had</i>
to sail then or not sail at all&mdash;he would have been obliged to
round Cape Horn in a very high latitude in the depth of winter, and
this was one of the few ways in which the Sun-Worshipper was
unwilling to add to his knowledge and experience. He therefore had
to go by the usual Cape of Good Hope route. He spent a month in
Brazil, at Bahia de Todos Santas&mdash;the modern San
Salvador&mdash;and wrote a description of the place which occupies
twenty-six pages in the modern edition of the Journal. In order to
give his mutineers no chance&mdash;he was sleeping on the
quarter-deck with arms handy&mdash;he did not call at the Cape, and
jogged for New Holland. He followed the usual Dutch route, and on
the 31st of July, like so many Dutch skippers, he saw land in the
neighbourhood of Houtman's Abrolhos.</p>
<p>His plan had been to "coast round" New Holland. There were now
two ways of doing so. He might sail Southward and then Eastward,
following the line of the discovery of De Nuyts, connecting it with
Tasman's discovery of Van Diemen Land, and then connecting this
with Tasman's discoveries in New Guinea. Had he taken this route he
might have been first to sail through Bass's Strait, first to coast
Eastern Australia, second to sail through Torres Strait. But it was
midwinter, and the voyage seemed too cold for one who believed that
wealth was "directly under the sun." "I confess," he writes, "I was
not for spending any time more than was necessary in the higher
Latitudes; as knowing that the land there could not be so well
worth the discovering as the parts that lay nearer the line, and
more directly under the sun." He decided therefore to coast round
New Holland the other way;&mdash;"to coast along to the Northward,
and so to the East, and so thought to come round by the South of
Terra Australis (i.e. New Holland) in my return back, which should
be in the summer time there."</p>
<p>Dampier, therefore, sailed North, seeking "a Harbour to refresh
us after our tedious journey." He came to the great bay behind
Dirck Hartog's island, where Vlamingh had caught sharks three years
before. Dampier also caught sharks, and called the place Sharks
Bay. His account of the place is similar to that which Vlamingh
gave three years before, and to that which Freycinet gave one
hundred and two years later. The sharks were savoury, the raccoons
(kangaroo rats?) were "very good meat," and the turtles
"indifferent sweet meat." The bush flowers were beautiful and
fragrant, and "for the most part unlike any I had seen elsewhere";
at last one really good thing had been seen in Australia! But the
country was waterless. They dug wells again and again, but to no
purpose.</p>
<p>Hence Dampier sailed northward along the coast, keeping at a
distance, however, and believing that what he saw was more probably
a screen of islands than a continuous coast. He came to the "range
of islands" that is now called "Dampier's Archipelago." They all
looked dry, rocky, and barren. Dampier despaired of getting water,
but thought he might find "some sort of rich mineral or
amber-greece." But he found nothing of interest save beautiful
wild-flowers, and he named the island Rosemary Island after one of
the shrubs. But the great multitude of islands, and the strong
tides running between them, were putting questions. Dampier was
sailing by Tasman's Chart, and was growing dissatisfied with it.
"The shore is laid down as all along joining in one body or
continent, with some openings like rivers; and not like islands as
they really are." He concluded that Tasman "came not so near the
shore as his line shows," and that his hard outline of coast was
founded on ignorance and guess-work. It is unlucky that the loss of
Tasman's Journal for the voyage of 1644 makes it impossible to know
what his answer to this criticism would have been. Dampier, at
least, could only see islands. There might be continent behind
them, but Dampier doubted. All he saw from about 27&deg; to about 20&deg;
looked like "nothing but ranges of pretty large islands against the
sea, whatever might be behind them to the Eastward, whether sea or
land, continent or islands." His own guess was that "here might be
a kind of archipelago of islands, and a passage possibly to the
South of New Holland and New Guinea into the great South Sea
Eastward." It was possible indeed, that "the high tides and great
in-draught" were "occasioned by the mouth of some great river." But
it seemed more likely that there was "a channel or strait." It was
impossible to make further exploration, for there was urgent need
of water. But he thought that on his way home he might be able to
seek the Eastern entrance of the supposed channel, which might be
in the region of New Guinea, and to sail through it back to
Rosemary Island.</p>
<p>Dampier's guess was wrong. But it seems, nevertheless, to have
been a good guess, and bears good testimony to Dampier's scientific
seamanship. A century later Flinders, summing up geographic
knowledge before his own voyage of 1802, and the problems which he
had hoped to solve in that voyage, wrote that Dampier's guess was
supported by "a fair induction from facts." By that time Cook's
voyage had proved that the supposed passage could not lead into the
great ocean Eastward. But it was thought "possible that it might
communicate with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and even probable that a
passage existed from thence to the unknown part of the South coast
beyond the Isles of St. Francis and St. Peter. But whether the
opening were the entrance to a strait, separating Terra Australis
into one or more islands, or led into a mediterranean sea, as some
thought; or whether it were the entrance of a large river; there
was, in either case, a great geographical question to be settled,
relative to the parts behind Rosemary Island."<sup>*</sup>
Flinders' own voyages proved that, if there were a passage behind
Rosemary Island, that passage communicated neither with the South
coast nor with the Gulf of Carpentaria. But the "geographical
question relative to the parts behind Rosemary Island," which
Dampier had asked with so much good judgment, remain unanswered
till an even later date.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders, vol. i. p. lxvi.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Cf. the voyages of King, and of Stokes.]</p>
<p>Dampier looked for an opening, but he looked far more eagerly
for some water. In Latitude 18&deg; 21', in the bay now called Roebuck
Bay, he went ashore with a few men, armed with muskets and
cutlasses, and carrying shovels and pick-axes to dig wells. They
dug eight or nine feet, but there was no water. At last they found
"a rundlet of brackish water," not fit to drink, but good enough to
boil their oatmeal porridge, whereby they might save their other
water for drinking. The country was so barricaded with a long,
chain of sandhills that they could see nothing of what was further
inland. What they could see were "Savannahs" bearing a sort of thin
coarse grass, and a poor scrub of woodland. Standing in the
savannahs were "several things like haycocks." They looked like
Hottentot's houses, but were found to be "so many rocks." If
Dampier had looked more closely he would probably have found that
they were so many ant-hills. Two or three dingoes were seen "like
hungry wolves, lean like so many skeletons, being nothing but skin
and bones."</p>
<p>There was a "rencounter" with the natives, who were even worse
to look at than the dingoes. They refused friendship and ran away.
Dampier with two men chased them, hoping to learn whence they got
water. A nimble young man overtook them, but they attacked him with
wooden lances, and Dampier had to shoot one of them. Their chief
was "a young brisk man painted with a circle of white paste about
his eyes, and a white streak down his nose;...his painting adding
very much to his natural deformity; for they all of them have the
most unpleasant looks and the worst features of any people that
ever I saw, though I have seen great variety of savages."
Apparently they were even worse than "the miserablest people in the
world" whom, in the previous voyage, he had seen forty or fifty
leagues to the North-East. "These were much the same blinking
creatures (here being also abundance of the same flesh-flies
teasing them), and with the same black skins, and hair frizzled,
tall and thin, as those were." Like them also they seemed to live
chiefly on shell-fish and small fry, caught in holes in the sand at
low water.</p>
<p>Dampier had now "spent about five weeks in ranging off and on
the coast of New Holland, a length of about three hundred leagues."
He had landed at three several places to see what there might be
thereabouts worth discovery, and especially to recruit his stock of
fresh water and provisions. He had found nothing worth discovering,
nothing to eat, nothing to drink. He now thought to sail to the
place where the <i>Cygnet</i> had anchored, that happy place where
you could get water by sufficient digging. But everlasting "shoals"
made it "a very tedious thing to sail along the shore." He "edged
further off to sea," lost sight of land, and got North of the place
he aimed at. He was "almost weary" of the shores of New Holland.
The shoals seemed endless; the coast was unknown, save for Tasman's
unsatisfying chart, and the tides were strong, high, and dangerous.
He decided that the best plan was to go forward to New Guinea, and
steered away for Timor.</p>
<p>In Timor both Portuguese and Dutch had forts. Dampier came first
to the Dutch fort. The Governor took them for plundering pirates,
but Dampier explained that this time he was in a King's ship, and
only wanted water. "The Governor replied that he had orders not to
supply any ships but their own East India Company; neither must
they allow any Europeans to come the way that we came. 'You are
come to inspect into our trade and strength, and I will have you
therefore be gone with all speed.'" On better acquaintance,
however, the Governor proved to be "a civil, genteel, and sensible
man," asked Dampier to dinner, and gave him one of the best
entertainments he ever had while abroad. "Our liquor," he quaintly
writes, "was wine, beer, toddey, or <i>water</i>, which we liked
best after dinner." Later he called at the Portuguese fort, where
the Deputy gave him a handsome present of animals and fruit.</p>
<p>Thoroughly refreshed, Dampier sailed for New Guinea on the 12th
of December, 1699. He saw New Guinea on New Year's Day 1700,
rounded the Western end, and then sailed on an Eastern course, wide
of the coast, till he came to the point of the island of New
Hanover. The three islands of the modern map,&mdash;New Hanover,
New Ireland, and New Britain,&mdash;were drawn by Tasman as one
land, and as part of New Guinea. Dampier did not notice the
passages that separate New Ireland from New Hanover and from New
Britain. But, sailing down the hitherto unknown Eastern coast of
New Britain, he discovered the passage that separates New Britain
from New Guinea. He sailed through this passage, Dampier Strait,
and, having proved that "this Eastland does not join to New
Guinea," he named it "Nova Britannia." He wrote of the island, in a
passage that attracted much attention, with very high praise. "The
mountains and lower lands were pleasantly mixed with wood-land and
savannahs. The trees appeared very green and flourishing; and the
savannahs seemed to be very smooth and even; no meadow in England
appears more green in the Spring than these...It is also very well
inhabited with strong well-limbed negroes, whom we found very
daring and bold at several places...It is very probable the island
may afford as many rich commodities as any in the world; and the
natives may be easily brought to commerce." Dampier had been right.
Wealth existed "directly under the sun." Here was the English
Spice-island.<sup>*</sup></p>

<p>MAP IN DAMPIER'S Voyages.</p>
<p>Dampier had meant to sail round New Holland, and, according to
this plan, should now have sought to round the Eastern end of New
Guinea, with a view to sailing down the unknown Eastern coast of
New Holland, and then of coming round its South coast in the
Summer. Another plan had been to seek, somewhere to the South of
New Guinea, the Eastern entrance of the Channel which, he believed,
reached its Western entrance between Rosemary Island and Roebuck
Bay. But these plans had become impossible. "The many difficulties
I at this time met with, the want of convenience to clean my ship,
the fewness of my men, their desire to hasten home, and the danger
of continuing in these circumstances in seas where the shoals and
coasts were utterly unknown, and must be searched out with much
caution and length of time; hindered me from prosecuting any
further my intended search." He sailed back along the North coast
of New Guinea to Timor.</p>
<p>He had intended to make for the coast of New Holland in about
20&deg;, and to seek for the "Trial Rocks," for he believed that the
discovery of them would be of great use to merchants trading to
these parts. But he fell ill; his men were "very negligent" when he
was not on deck; he could not trust them to navigate the ship; and
he thought it wisest to make for Batavia. Here he was allowed to
buy provisions, and an attempt was made to patch the rotten ship
for the voyage home. By miracle they got as far as the Island of
Ascension, where the ship sprang a leak. Attempts to mend it made
it worse, for "the plank was so rotten it broke away like dirt."
The ship foundered, but the crew got safely to land, though many of
Dampier's precious books and papers were lost. The crew were
rescued by British men-of-war that chanced to come that way.</p>
<p>Dampier's welcome home was a court-martial. The accuser was
Lieutenant Fisher, whom Dampier had put in irons, and had left in
prison at Bahia in Brazil. Fisher accused Dampier of being a bad
navigator, cruel to trustworthy seamen, and over kind to pirate
friends. Dampier accused Fisher of calling him "Old Rogue, Old Dog,
Old Cheat," and so incensing the men against their captain. The
court-martial, which included Sir George Rooke and Sir Cloudesley
Shovel, gave the verdict "that Captain William Dampier has been
guilty of very hard and cruel usage towards Lieutenant Fisher." He
was "fined all his pay to the Chest at Chatham." And, further, it
was the opinion of the Court that "the said Captain Dampier is not
a fit person to be employed as commander of any of Her Majesty's
ships" (June 1702).</p>
<p>I bow with respect to the verdict of a court-martial. But it
seems to me that another court-martial should have been held before
Dampier's trial: a court-martial to consider the character of the
First Lord of the Admiralty, who had deliberately appointed in
ex-pirate to command a ship whose planks were as rotten as dirt,
manned by a crew whose morality was in the same condition as the
planks. When the crime of the First Lord had been suitably
condemned, it might perhaps have sufficed to say to the ex-pirate
that he had failed to achieve the impossible, and to congratulate
him on his miraculous survival.</p>
<p>It does not seem, however, that the verdict was taken very
seriously. Dampier still retained the reputation, which he did not
very well deserve, of being a first-rate pirate chief with a
speciality in the South Sea. When, in the same year (1702), war
broke out against Spain and France, a syndicate of London merchants
was formed, as syndicates had been formed in the days of Elizabeth,
to gain big dividends by "privateering" in the South Sea; and they
chose Dampier to sail as captain in a ship named the <i>St.
George</i>, with a commission from the Lord High Admiral, who was
the Queen's own husband. The story was a tenth-rate pirate story
not worth the telling, save for one incident. Dampier hunted the
Spaniards in consort, for a time, with a tiny ship called the
<i>Cinque Ports</i>, whose captain was a ruffian named Stradling,
and whose mate was named Alexander Selkirk. According to our modern
critic, Selkirk was "on the whole about as troublesome a seaman as
ever stepped a deck"; but Dampier thought him "the best man in the
ship"; and possibly both statements are true. After quarrelling
with Dampier, Stradling called at Juan Fernandez, the island in
which already in our story two men had played the part of Robinson
Crusoe. Here Selkirk chose to land, partly because he hated
Stradling with good reason, and partly because, again with good
reason, he was convinced that the <i>Cinque Ports</i> would shortly
go to the bottom. Here for four years he lived the life of Robinson
Crusoe the Third.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* It is likely that Defoe had read all these three
Robinson Crusoe stories. It is curious that he placed his hero, not
in Juan Fernandez, but in an island in the estuary of the Orinoco.
He describes "the great draft and reflux of the mighty river
Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found
afterwards, our island lay; and this land, which I perceived to the
W. and N.W., was the great island Trinidad." Friday was a Carib
from Trinidad.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dampier was cruising in the <i>St. George</i>,
fighting French and Spanish ships; taking some small prizes, but on
the whole giving little satisfaction to his greedy and quarrelsome
crew. Two parties of malcontents, one after the other, got
possession of barks, and made the perilous voyage to the East
Indies. Dampier was left in the <i>St. George</i>, with
twenty-eight men and boys, "to make war upon a whole nation."
Moreover the <i>St. George</i> was a ship whose bottom was like
that of the <i>Roebuck</i>. When examined, it was found to resemble
a honeycomb; nowhere was the plank much thicker than an old
sixpence; and you could easily thrust your thumb through it. The
carpenter stopped the holes with tallow and charcoal; but did not
dare to drive a nail. At last Dampier took a small Spanish bark, in
which he also made the voyage to the East Indies. The Dutch seized
the ship, and Dampier, says an English writer in 1744,<sup>*</sup>
"returned naked to his owners, with a melancholy relation of his
and their misfortunes, occasioned chiefly by his own odd temper,
which made him so self-sufficient and overbearing that few or none
of his officers could endure him." Dampier may have had an "odd
temper" as ship commander; but, again, there were other reasons for
his nakedness. In spite of failure, he was "introduced to the
Queen, had the honour to kiss her hand, and to give her some
account of the danger he had run through."</p>
<p class="note">[* Campbell, the editor of the 1744-1748 edition of
Harris's <i>Voyages</i>.]</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear that Dampier was a very good Pilot and a
very bad Captain. He could not handle the seamen of his period, but
he knew as much about navigation as any man living. These facts
were recognised when, in 1708, a syndicate of Bristol merchants
sent two ships to wage war on the enemy, and at the same time to
earn big dividends for shareholders. The command was given to
Woodes Rogers, a friend of Dampier, and an able captain. Dampier
was Pilot. It was the business of Rogers to quell the mutinies, and
order the battle against the great Spanish treasure-ship. It was
the business of Dampier to advise what courses should be taken in
the seas he knew so well. They called for refreshment at Juan
Fernandez, and "our pinnace returned from the shore, and brought
abundance of crayfish, and a man clothed in goatskins, who looked
wilder than the first owners of them." It was Alexander Selkirk,
who gave an account of his life more vivid, though less detailed,
than that which Defoe wrote in his famous book a few years later.
Selkirk, who had been Dampier's friend, joined the ship as mate.
The voyage was well-managed, and was very profitable. We seem to be
once more in the spacious days of Drake. With astonishing ease
Spanish towns were sacked, and Spanish ships were captured. Then
they ran along Dampier's old route to Guam, and then sailed among
the islands off New Guinea; and Rogers agreed with Dampier's
opinion that these islands should be of special interest to
commercial Englishmen. "It is most certain these islands would all
of them bear spice, and afford immense riches to this nation if
they were settled." They came to Batavia, where the seamen got
arrack for eight pence a pound, and thought themselves in Paradise.
They were home in September 1711, and the syndicate made a nett
profit of &pound;170,000.</p>
<p>Here ends knowledge of Dampier's life. "He vanishes," says the
modern biographer, "like a puff of tobacco smoke."<sup>*</sup> He
died in 1715. He is important in our story, not as a discoverer,
but as a student and as a writer. He discovered nothing that had
not been discovered before, save the Eastern coast of New Britain,
and the strait between that island and New Guinea. But his
writings, immensely and deservedly popular, made people understand
the interest of the South Sea. Englishmen had hitherto known
nothing and thought nothing of the South Sea. The learned might
read old records of the voyages of Quiros, Le Maire and Tasman; but
they read them without interest and without faith, as one would
read a rather dull fairy-tale. For the unlearned there was nothing
to read. To both learned and unlearned Dampier's narratives
revealed a new and a strange world, crowded with things interesting
to men of all sorts and conditions. The young lady of Queen Anne's
reign could afford to leave the latest novel, even by Defoe, uncut
upon her table; for the best things in the latest novel were taken,
without acknowledgment, from the pages of Dampier and his "fellow
travellers." Men of science found a new world of deeper interest;
they could study the only exact account of tropical plants and
animals in a book that was a vivid record of strange adventure.</p>
<p class="note">[* Clark Russell, p. 182.]</p>
<p>It was from Dampier that Banks learnt of the strange and
beautiful bush-flowers that he sought at Botany Bay. To the
geographer he explained precisely that which was known, and that
which remained unknown, and he pointed to the paths of practicable
exploration. To the merchants he suggested that voyages of
curiosity might lead to voyages of profit, that enormous
possibilities of lucrative trade awaited them in Southern and in
Eastern seas. With both hands Dampier had poured forth such wealth
of fascinating information, that for the first time Englishmen felt
at home in the South Sea, able to find their way about, and
beginning to think that it might be worth while to contend with the
Dutch for trade settlement therein.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>Yet, half a century passed before another Englishman landed in
New Holland. Dampier's books were good reading, but his argument
was not strong enough to induce men to put their hands into their
pockets. The power of pure science was still too slight to launch
ships on voyages of curiosity. The main chance was the appeal to
men of commerce, who were powerful enough to do almost anything
they liked. But the men of commerce thought there were more
important things to attend to. As for New Holland, the Dutch had
known thousands of miles of it for a century, and had not thought
it worth while to found a single factory. What the Dutch could not
turn to profit must be pretty bad, and Dampier himself had proved
that it was very bad indeed. New Britain, it was true, seemed to be
in a fertile place. But New Britain was a long way off. Its
exploitation would be expensive, and money could be better spent in
nearer places.</p>
<p>Thus, so far as action is concerned, the first half of the
eighteenth century was a period of singularly little interest in
our story. The Dutch had already discovered far more than they
could use, and thought that further exploration would be a mistake.
"To reduce a continent near three thousand miles broad," explains
an English writer in 1744, "is a prodigious undertaking, and to
settle it by degrees would be to open to all the world the
importance of that country." The day of the Dutch as a progressive
world-power was waning. They stood nervously in defence of a
gigantic monopoly, that was wonderfully out of proportion to their
numbers and their strength. The day that was coming was the day of
the British and the French. But, in the early eighteenth century,
British and French were fighting out their rivalry in the Atlantic.
When America's question was settled, they would have spare time for
Australasia. Meanwhile the Dutch were allowed another century's
lease of their monopoly.</p>
<p>And yet this period has an interest of its own&mdash;an interest
that consists, not in voyages, but in the growth of ideas which led
to voyages.</p>
<p>In 1717 and 1718 Jean Pierre Purry, a servant of the Dutch East
India Company, wrote two Memorials, which urged the Company to
found a colony in Nuytsland. He pointed to the enormous length of
the country that had been discovered in the South. There were five
or six hundred leagues from Edelsland to the islands of St. Francis
and St. Peter; and who could say what lands existed between these
islands and New Zealand, another six or seven hundred leagues away?
All this huge country was in the best climate in the world. It must
contain many excellent lands, and the trouble would be to choose
the best. True, the country bore a bad reputation. But all that was
known about it was that the bare coast-line was inhabited by
ignorant savages. Of course, here as elsewhere, must be deserts and
mountains, but who could reasonably say that the whole country was
worthless? Exploration would probably show that it contained mines
of gold and silver as rich as those of Mexico and Peru.</p>
<p>It was reasonable enough to guess that, within its vast limits,
would be found "one of the best countries in the world," a country
able to produce grain, silk, tobacco, wine, and oil. A colony
founded here would be of the greatest service, as a place of
refreshment for the Company's ships, and as a source of supply to
all the Company's settlements in the Indies. It could be easily
formed by labourers from Java, who would appreciate the change of
climate, or by slaves. Five hundred or six hundred picked soldiers
should be sent to reconnoitre; for it was possible that the natives
were giants, and that they possessed forts and "machines of war
better than our bombs and cannons."</p>
<p>And there was need of haste. If the Dutch did not grasp the
opportunity of using a land which contained "perhaps more riches
than any other part of the world," the British or the French would
certainly do so. Would Hollanders be content to abandon "New
<i>Holland</i>" to strangers? The British were especially to be
dreaded. "One must confess there is no people in all the universe
so alive, so active, so enterprising." For they are colonists as
well as merchants;&mdash;"they themselves go to <i>live</i> in a
good land." And, if ever British or French made a settlement in
Nuytsland, and formed there a basis for warfare, with difficulty
would the Dutch be able to maintain their position in the East
Indies.</p>
<p>Purry argued with eloquence and with truth; but he did not
convince. Colonisation and fortification, he admitted, cost much
money. The Company, he said, could get the money back by taking
one-fifth of the wine, oil, grain, and fruit produced. But the
Company did not believe him. It preferred to take the chance of a
British or French settlement.</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>In 1721 there was a Dutch voyage that is interesting not from
what it did but from what it suggested. The voyage of
Roggeveen<sup>*</sup> looks back to the earlier Spanish story, and
looks forward to the British story to which we shall come. Since
the days of Le Maire (1615), the Dutch had thought little about the
great golden continent, Terra Australis Incognita. Their concern
had been with the "Company's New Netherland," the huge island they
had cut out of Terra Australis, and found to be a land of
incredible badness. Tasman, indeed, thought that "Staten Land" (New
Zealand) was a promontory of Terra Australis Incognita, but it
seemed an even more murderous place than the Company's New
Netherland, and his only thought was how to get through it or round
it, in order to find a way to Chili. But now the argument of Quiros
once more inspired a Dutch navigator. A gentleman named Roggeveen,
who had made a fortune in Batavia, persuaded the Dutch West India
Company to send him, in command of three ships, to search for the
unknown continent, for which Quiros had searched in 1606 and Le
Maire in 1616.</p>
<p class="note">[* "Two, if not three accounts of Roggeveen's
expedition were published soon after his return to Europe, from the
pens of persons who sailed with him." Two of these are translated
in Campbell, de Brosses, Callender and Dalrymple. "It was not until
1836, however, that the official log of the commander himself came
to light: it was printed a couple of years later at Middleburg, in
the original Dutch." The part which tells the story of the
discovery of Easter Island is translated by Corney in <i>The Voyage
of Captain Don Felipe Gonzalez</i> (Hakluyt Society).]</p>
<p>He touched at the Falkland Islands which he called "Belgia
Australis," because its inhabitants would be strictly antipodes to
the inhabitants of the Low Countries. The land looked beautiful and
fertile, but Roggeveen postponed examination till he should return
from the discovery of the Continent. To make sure that he would get
round Cape Horn he sailed as far South as 62&deg; 50'. Huge icebergs
seemed to prove that the Southern Continent extended to the Pole;
for it was held that such vast hills of ice could not be produced
in the sea, and therefore proved the existence of big rivers. The
great number of birds also seemed to prove that this continent
could not be far away. Then, sailing Northward, Roggeveen visited
the island of Juan Fernandez, and appreciated its advantages so
highly that he thought of settling it, as a place of shelter and
refreshment to ships bound to Southern lands. That plan, however,
he also postponed till his return.</p>
<p>Then he began the real business of the voyage, the search for
that part of Terra Australis which must exist, as he believed,
between the 30th and the 36th degree; and experience proved, he
argued, that between these degrees, both in the North and in the
South, are the richest, pleasantest, and most fruitful countries in
the world.</p>
<p>First, he sought for that part of Terra Australis which the
English privateer Captain Davis declared he had seen in 28&deg; in the
year 1680. But Roggeveen could only find there a little island,
which he called Easter Island, because he discovered it on Easter
Day. It is now agreed that this most interesting of Pacific islands
is the same land that Davis had seen. But Roggeveen sailed on
puzzled and disappointed. We cannot exactly make out his course. So
says Captain Cook, and so says Captain Cook's modern editor. He
sailed eight hundred leagues without discovering land. Then, in
about 15&deg;, he discovered exceedingly beautiful islands, which
modern writers tell us were the Samoan group. But Roggeveen
despaired, and decided to sail to the East Indies, in spite of the
protest of officers who urged that he should winter in the land of
Quiros, which, they said, could not be above one hundred and fifty
leagues away. He found islands in about 11&deg;, which some thought
were part of Terra Australis Incognita. At last he reached Java,
where, as in Le Maire's story, his ships were confiscated by the
East India Company, as the ships of an interloper.</p>
<p>Once more, the search for Terra Australis Incognita had failed.
But, once more, it had failed in a way that enabled the party of
Quiros to argue that the existence of the unknown continent had not
been disproved; that, on the contrary, things had been observed
that tended to strengthen the belief that the continent would in
the end be found by those who sought in faith. Roggeveen's voyage
was inspired by Quiros. It gave strength to the movement of ideas
that sent forth Cook.</p>
<p>The story turns to notice British plans. In 1744-1748 a writer
named Campbell brought out a new edition of the Collection of
voyages that had been published by Harris in 1705. Campbell's plan
was to tell the story in such a way that it would point a moral. He
printed the original narratives, and he added prefaces,
introductions, and remarks which explained the lessons which
Englishmen should learn from their reading. The chief lesson was
the importance of commerce. His work was dedicated to the
"Merchants of Great Britain," and he sought to prove that "to
commerce we owe our wealth." It was to commerce also that we owe
our strength; for "whoever is master at sea must be master at land
likewise."</p>
<p>And it is in order to show one way by which commercial wealth
and strength may grow, that he prints and explains the narratives
of travel in the South Sea. Very interesting to us are the
geographical conclusions which he founds upon them. "It is most
evident from Tasman's voyages," he writes "that New Guinea,
Carpentaria (i.e. Cape York peninsula), New Holland, Van Diemen
Land, and the country discovered by Quiros make all one continent,
from which New Zealand seems to be separated by a strait, and
perhaps is part of another continent." The outlines of the
continent which centres in New Holland are well known. The only
"Terra Australis" that now remains "incognita" is the continent
which, as we must assume, lies between New Zealand and America: a
continent which probably includes New Zealand itself, and the
various promontories that had been seen by Quiros, Le Maire, Davis,
Roggeveen, and others.</p>
<p>Campbell was deeply interested in this Terra Australis
Incognita. He quoted with acceptance Roggeveen's arguments, mainly
taken from Quiros, to prove its existence and its richness. British
merchants were always grumbling about the decay of the old trades.
They should find out new trades. The war gave an excellent
opportunity to exploit the South Sea. Anson had sailed on his
famous voyage in 1741, and returned in the year of the publication
of Campbell's book. There was no reason either to be complaisant to
the Spaniard or to fear him. Nor need British maritime power dread
the wrath of the Dutch. The British should adopt Roggeveen's
excellent plan for settlement at Belgia Australis (the Falkland
Islands), and at Juan Fernandez. "By the help of those two colonies
undoubtedly the Southern Indies had been by this time effectively
discovered." Whatever nation shall revive and prosecute the plan
will become in a few years "master of as rich and profitable a
commerce as the Spaniards have to Mexico and Peru, or the
Portuguese to Brazil." The Englishman had dreamed the dream of
Quiros&mdash;with a difference.</p>

<br>
<b>53. PART OF MAP IN HARRIS'S <i>Voyages</i><br>
(Ed. Campbell, 1744.)</b></p>
<p>The search for Terra Australis Incognita must, no doubt, be
"left to the industry of future ages." For practical men of
business the interesting continent was Terra Australis Cognita:
"the great Southern Continent which Tasman surrounded, and the
bounds of which are tolerably well known"; tolerably well known, at
least, to the Dutch, though to other nations New Holland was still
a "chimera." The Dutch had discovered the continent, but they had
made no use of it, and never would make use of it "till either
their trade declines in the East Indies, or till they are obliged
to exert themselves to exclude other nations." And they have taken
all possible pains to prevent any relation being published that
might invite or encourage any other nation to make attempts that
way. True, Pelsart's voyage had been published. It had been
published because it had been thought likely to frighten people
away. Tasman's voyages had never been published entire, and
probably the Company had never intended that they should be
published at all. True, again, a map showing his discoveries had
been made on the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall. But no
<i>description</i> had been published. Strangers might gape at the
map as a curiosity. Wise Dutchmen would say:&mdash;"Behold the
wisdom of the East India Company! A resource for the benefit of
posterity!"</p>
<p>When the Dutch said that New Holland was a worthless country,
there was no reason to believe them. It was incredible that a land
so huge was everywhere altogether bad. No doubt in the Tropic of
Capricorn the weather would be very hot, and the country
unwholesome and disagreeable. But, both Northward and Southward,
life would be pleasant. The climate of the continent was, on the
whole, the happiest in the world. The climate of Van Diemen's Land
was like that of the South of France. The Northern regions, under
the sun, would be hot, but they would also be exceedingly rich. The
lands which Quiros discovered (Espiritu Santo, the modern New
Hebrides) are part of this great island-continent, and Quiros
declared that they abounded in gold, silver, pearls, and spices.
Dampier's description of New Britain praised its rich fertility.
The narratives of Le Maire and Roggeveen confirm faith in the
existence of lands very attractive to merchant and to settler. To
make settlement in this part of the world would, no doubt, be
difficult to any nation except the Dutch, who could easily have
done so from Batavia, from the Moluccas, or from the Cape. But the
British have no reason to fear the Dutch dog in the manger. The
British East India Company, helped perhaps by Parliament, should
send a small squadron to sail in Tasman's tracks, and to get exact
up-to-date information, so that "we might know, as well and as
certainly as the Dutch, how far a colony settled there might answer
our expectations." "By this means all the back (East) coast of New
Holland and New Guinea might be thoroughly examined." If the East
India Company refused to do its duty, this would give opportunity
to the Royal African Company, who might establish a colony in
Madagascar, and thence trade with New Guinea, or better still, with
New Britain, "the properest place for them to settle in," and a
convenient centre for trading with the East Indies on the one side,
and with Terra Australis on the other. If the Royal African Company
also refused, here would be the chance for the South Sea Company to
do something to justify its name. The Company had not yet sent a
single ship on voyage of discovery in the South Sea. Here they
might gain some equivalent of the lost Assiento Contract. They
should first settle Juan Fernandez. Sailing thence, they might take
slaves from New Guinea to Peru. Thence also they might sail, in a
two months' voyage, to Van Diemen's Land. They might make a
settlement on the South coast of Terra Australis (Nuyts-land?), and
get perchance a trade in gold and spices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the French enemy also was thinking of the Southern
Continent, and the direction of his thought was determined by a
curious historical incident. In 1663 there was published in Paris a
book with the title "Memoirs concerning the establishment of a
Christian Mission in the Austral Land." The author signed himself
"J.P.D.C. Pr&ecirc;tre Indien." He had a curious story to tell. In 1503
the Sieur de Gonneville sailed South, with the design of sailing in
the course of Vasco de Gama to the East Indies. He was driven from
this course by a furious storm, and came to a large country which
he called Southern India, where he stayed six months. Then he
sailed home, accompanied by a native prince, whom he promised to
return to this country "instructed in the European arts, and
particularly the art of making war, which these Australians desired
with an incredible passion." But the promise was not kept. The
Indian prince remained in France, was baptised, and married a
relative of Gonneville. His great-grandson was the "pr&ecirc;tre indien,"
who told the story in order to urge that he should be sent as
missionary to the land of his Australian ancestors.</p>
<p>Unhappily he was unable to say where that land was. Gonneville's
ships had, on the return journey, been captured by an English
privateer, who robbed him of his journal, and everything he had. On
landing, he had on the 19th of July, 1505, made a judicial
declaration, authenticated by all the proper forms of law. In this
declaration he had given some description of the Austral land he
had discovered&mdash;it was a very fertile land, and the natives
were wondrously affable, and received the French as "angels from
heaven"&mdash;but by inexplicable mischance he had said no word
that could throw light on the question of its locality, and no one
had the least idea where this Southern India was. No wonder that
the longing of the "Indian priest" of the seventeenth century to
visit the land of his great-grandfather did not avail to take him
there.</p>
<p>It was, however, a story that interested his French
fellow-countrymen, and it was much talked of in France in the early
eighteenth century. Patriotic French geographers held that
Gonneville's voyage "secured without difficulty to the French
nation the honour of the first discovery of the Austral lands
sixteen years before the departure of Magellan."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* De Brosses, vol. i. p. 103.]</p>
<p>Frenchmen began to grow ashamed that they had so long delayed to
make good the claim conferred by first discovery. The trouble,
however, remained that, while the "Land of Gonneville" certainly
belonged to France, no one knew where the land of Gonneville was.
Some thought it was in the region of the "Cape of the Austral
Lands," that had been marked on the maps of the South Atlantic in
Latitude 42&deg;, Longitude 7&deg; (from Teneriffe), on the evidence
perhaps of some unknown seaman who had seen Tristan d'Acunha or
Gough Island. Captain Lozier Bouvet thought that it was in this
Longitude but that the Latitude was perhaps 48&deg;.<sup>*</sup> He
persuaded the French East India Company that this was the very
place they needed for the refreshment of their ships. It would also
be a good basis to trade with the Spaniards of La Plata and the
Portuguese of Brazil. The affable natives would again receive the
French "as angels from Heaven." There would be lucrative commerce,
and millions of infidels would be converted to the Christian Faith.
Lozier Bouvet was of the school of Quiros. He dreamed a French
dream of prosperous discovery in Terra Australis Incognita. Only
the French dream was to come true in the South Atlantic.</p>
<p class="note">[* De Brosses, vol. i. p. 104; Rainaud, p.
396.]</p>
<p>In July 1738 he sailed with two ships, commissioned by the
Company to discover "the Austral lands." He searched for "the Cape
of the Austral lands," that was marked in the Charts in Latitude
42&deg;. But he found no cape, and thought that perhaps its discoverer
had seen an iceberg in the middle of a fog. But on New Year's Day
1739, in Latitude 54&deg;, and in Longitude slightly Westward of the
Cape of Good Hope, he saw land, or thought he saw land, high and
rugged, covered with snow and almost hidden in fogs, which he
called the Cape of the Circumcision, in memory of the Festival of
the day. For several weeks he saw what looked like land, but fogs
and ice prevented approach. Some thought that "the Cape" was, not
the tip of a continent, but a small island; and apparently it was
in fact the small island which now bears the name of its
discoverer. But Bouvet returned to France convinced that he had
actually "coasted the Austral continent from Longitude 7&deg; to
50&deg;:&mdash;I say the Austral continent, for I believe that the ice,
the penguins, the sea-wolves, amphibious animals, which we
constantly found for the space of 48&deg; of Longitude, can make good
this opinion." He admits that this part of the continent "will be
of little use to Europeans, if all the years are like the year we
experienced."</p>
<p>But he was in no way discouraged. He had found the continent,
and the continent was the continent that had been described by
Quiros, From the Cape of Circumcision he wished to sail round the
South of Ncw Holland to Espiritu Santo, and then to return by Cape
Horn. He was in love with Espiritu Santo, its spices, its gold, its
pearls, its silk. In the spice trade alone, the French might
undersell the Dutch, and make ten million a year. The French would
find, as Dutch and British had found, that only a great trade can
sustain a great navy. So argued the enthusiastic Bouvet. But the
French Company was like other Companies, and said No.</p>
<p>But France was waking up. The new Renaissance which made the
modern world was stirring French minds. Old world-problems were
being re-surveyed from the points of view of Science and of
Humanity. A new spirit of active inquisitiveness was at work,
insisting that more knowledge must be gained in order that the
world might be put into order, and that human happiness might be
increased.</p>
<p>In this new spirit, Maupertuis wrote letters to Frederick of
Prussia "on the progress of the Sciences," summing up what had been
learnt, and what remained to be learnt, and recommending research
in special directions as "useful for the human race, and curious
for scholars." He drew attention to the peculiar interest of the
problem of the South. All the world knows that in the Southern
Hemisphere is "an unknown space in which may be situated a new part
of the world greater than any of the other four." Maupertuis is
astonished that no prince has had the curiosity to explore these
immense solitudes, and to ascertain if they are occupied by land or
by sea. He is convinced that huge lands will be found. All those
who have navigated the South Sea have seen "points and capes and
sure signs of a continent near at hand." Bouvet had seen continual
signs of land in the South Atlantic for forty-eight degrees of
Longitude, and the enterprise had been abandoned too soon, for
Science shows that the visit was a month too early. But a better
field of exploration exists in the South Pacific, where the Austral
lands approach much more nearly to the Equator, in climates where
the most precious products of nature are found.</p>
<p>And Maupertuis pointed to the special interest which these
Southern lands will possess both for the man of science and for the
man of commerce. "They form so-to-say a world apart, in which one
cannot foresee that which exists. The discovery of these lands,
therefore, may offer the greatest utilities for commerce, and the
most marvellous spectacles for Science." It is in isles of the
South Sea that travellers say that they have seen savage hairy men
with tails, "a kind of mean between the monkeys and ourselves." And
Maupertuis would rather have an hour's conversation with the
Missing Link than with the greatest genius in Europe.</p>
<p>Maupertuis' Letters were read as a lecture to a learned Society.
When the lecture was over, one of the audience, Charles de Brosses,
President of the Parliament of Dijon, made a speech of half an hour
on discoveries in the South Seas. His ideas were similar to those
of Maupertuis. He had long studied the subject, both "as citizen
and as geographer," and he knew a great deal about it. The learned
Society was so impressed by the curious and novel character of what
he said, that he was requested to write a Memoir, and to read it at
the next meeting. The Memoir was highly appreciated, and he was
persuaded to develop his opinions in other memoirs. Finally, at the
urgent request of scientific friends, de Brosses published in 1756
a book entitled "History of Navigations to the Southern lands;
containing what is known of the manners and the products of the
countries discovered to the present time; treating also of the
utility of making more ample discoveries, and of the means of
forming a settlement there." In these volumes, much used by Cook
and Banks on the <i>Endeavour</i>, de Brosses gave extracts from
narratives of forty-seven voyages in the South Sea. But the parts
that are of interest to us are Book I, in which he discusses "the
utilities of discovery," and Book V, in which he discusses "the
means of forming a settlement in Southern lands."</p>
<p>When the President of the Parliament of Dijon wrote of the
"utilities of discovery" he wrote not as a bagman but as a
gentleman of honour. The first thought must be not of dividends but
of glory;&mdash;the glory that belongs to the hero who has greatly
benefited both his country and humanity. The discovery of Terra
Australis will be, not only the most useful, but also the most
noble enterprise whereby a sovereign may make glorious his name."
To add to the Globe a new world, to enrich the old world with all
the natural products, and all the useful usages of the new world,
this would be the effect of such a discovery." How compare the
glory of war with the glory of so splendid a service to mankind?
What modern King can compare his glory to the glory of Columbus and
Vespucci? Are not the Phoenicians, who discovered and civilised
Europe, more famous than the conquering Assyrians and Egyptians?
The princes of Portugal by their studies, their constancy, their
courage, their generosity, made their tiny country great, and
brought a renaissance to all Europe. And "it is not a paradox to
say that it is by geographical enterprises that a King may gain the
greatest glory, and that the most famous of modern sovereigns will
be he who will give his name to the Southern World."</p>
<p>For this is work that must be done by the Head of a State. It is
beyond the strength of an individual, and it is beyond the spirit
of a Commercial Company. For the merchant has not the spirit of the
gentleman. He seeks immediate profit, and his only curiosity is
curiosity for gain. Hence the abandonment of Bouvet's enterprise.
But a State should take large and long views, and should pursue its
aims with persistency till they are achieved. It should think in
centuries, and should build for eternity.<sup>*</sup> Thus a State
can see the wisdom of making foundations deep and strong. It can
undertake discovery in the spirit of pure curiosity, though this
spirit may rightly be fortified by the reflection that eventually
the things discovered will be of great service to mankind. It is
wrong to expect that a voyage of curiosity will pay a dividend. But
it is right to be sure that "advantages without number, foreseen
and unforeseen, will be drawn from a vast unknown continent, which
extends from the Line to the Antarctic Circle."</p>
<p class="note">[* De Brosses, vol. ii. p. 368.]</p>
<p>And if a State should undertake with ardour and with constancy
this glorious work, it should be France! It was the French
Gonneville who "first discovered the Austral world!" Yet his
countrymen, "forgetting next day the happy chance of an enterprise
so honourable, have by their natural levity lost all advantage, and
have allowed themselves to be robbed by Spaniards and Portuguese of
all honour of the first discovery."<sup>*</sup> And <i>now's</i>
the day that the French should press their claim to this glory. In
a voyage of curiosity, knowledge must be the first thought; but let
it be remembered that knowledge will give wealth and strength.
Discovery means commerce, and commerce means Sea Power. What time
more fitting to think of Sea Power than the year 1756, "when a
neighbouring Power (Great Britain) visibly affects the universal
monarchy of the Sea without respect or consideration for any other
nation!" In such circumstances, a voyage of curiosity is of
interest to the citizen as well as to the geographer.</p>
<p class="note">[* De Brosses, vol. i. p. 11.]</p>
<p>And what, shortly, is the argument that proves the proposal to
be useful, as well as noble? Observe, first, the enormous extent of
the region that is covered by our phrase "the Southern Lands." It
is a region that includes everything South of the Cape of Good
Hope, of the Moluccas, and of the Straits of Magellan. It is a
region of eight or ten million square miles, and is more than
one-third of the Globe!</p>
<p>Now the contents of this huge region are partly known, partly
unknown. The known Southern lands are the Pacific Islands, New
Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, New Holland, Carpentaria, and New
Guinea. The unknown Southern land is the vast continent, that
<i>must</i> exist further South, though only "Capes" have hitherto
been seen. It <i>must</i> exist because it has to balance the land
in the North. The laws of physics show that, but for this unknown
Southern continent, the earth would rotate by the Poles, instead of
rotating by the Equator. It centres in the South Pole, and its
promontories project far northwards in various places, and
especially between New Zealand and America.</p>
<p>And how inconceivably great must be the interest of these
Southern lands, known and unknown, which occupy one-third of the
Globe! How can one doubt that they will furnish objects of
curiosity, and opportunities of profit, equal to all that has been
furnished by America? How many peoples, differing amongst
themselves, and <i>greatly</i> differing from <i>ourselves</i>, in
figure, in manners, in usages, in ideas, in religion! How many
animals, insects, fishes, plants, trees, fruits, drugs, precious
stones, fossils, and metals! And, no doubt, in all these genera
there are millions of species of which we have not even a notion,
since this world has never had communication with ours, and is to
us, so to say, almost as strange as would be another planet. What
branches of trade in skins, silks, spices, medicines, dye-woods,
gold and jewels! And, again, what a chance of selling our coloured
glass-beads, our brandy, our sixpenny mirrors, at a profit as
enormous as that gained in the first voyage to the East Indies!</p>
<p>And it will be a trade profitable to <i>both</i> sides. The
natives want iron as much as we want gold. "The Australian" will
make profit by giving anything he has for a pair of scissors; and,
in addition to the pair of scissors he will gain French culture,
and those will become men who have now nothing human but their
figures. As the Phoenicians discovered and civilized the Europeans,
so will the French discover and civilize the Australians, who after
all are not likely to be much more brutal than were the Europeans.
True, the coast-people seem "completely barbarous," but this in no
way proves that one who penetrates this prodigious extent of
country will not find civilized nations from whom we ourselves may
learn an infinity of things. Even America seemed barbarous enough
till Mexico and Peru were discovered.</p>
<p>For convenience of discussion, let us divide this huge Southern
third of the world into three parts, corresponding to the three
seas. The South Atlantic may be called "Magellanica," the South
Pacific "Polynesia," and the South Indian Ocean
"Australasia"&mdash;a word now first coined.</p>
<p>In "Magellanica," Bouvet's discovery should be followed. Ice no
doubt is a difficulty, but ice means land; the more land the more
ice, and the more ice the more land. The best physicists hold that
the open sea does not freeze even near the poles. Ice-fields prove
great rivers, and great rivers prove a great continent. Bouvet
should have gone on. Away from the great rivers the coast would
have been accessible, and even the great rivers would be open in
summer. Probably the soil in this Latitude is barren; yet there may
be the same opportunities of trade as in Hudson's Bay. And, apart
from trade, the discovery cannot fail to be of scientific interest.
It will furnish to the observer phenomena that will throw light on
the configuration of the earth, on astronomy, on navigation, on
gravity, on the oscillations of the pendulum, on magnetism. Here is
the chance for an enthusiasm of curiosity. More than two centuries
have passed since the world was first circumnavigated by sailing
from West to East. One day some one will undertake to make the
circuit by sailing from North to South, and will succeed in spite
of cold and winds!</p>
<p>In "Magellanica" also are the islands visited by Roggeveen and
others (the Falkland Islands), concerning which "the English do not
conceal their opinion that, if one could find there a place of
refreshment, one would draw from it an inconceivable advantage, and
that the master of a place so advanced towards the South would, in
time of war, be master of the two seas." Moreover, in this region
are Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, with products of value, such as
skins, wools, dyes, and whales. A settlement here could make
lucrative trade with China. It could also at last determine the
much debated question, are the Patagonians of gigantic stature?</p>
<p>The best way to pass from "Magellanica" to "Polynesia" is not
through the Straits but round Cape Horn. And Polynesia is a very
fascinating field for exploration. No one has visited the Solomon
Islands since Mendana in 1567, and no one has visited Espiritu
Santo since Quiros in 1606. Later navigators have taken a Northerly
course across the Pacific, and have left unexplored the huge region
in the South which <i>must</i> contain a continent. Yet they have
already discovered innumerable islands, healthy, fertile, charming,
the happiest lands in the world. None of these islands are occupied
by Spain, except Guam in the Ladrones, and thus Polynesia still
offers a virgin field. The natives of some islands are friendly,
and inclined to trade, and it will be easy to found a colony that
would be very useful both to men of science and to seamen.</p>
<p>The man of science would find himself in a new world, in which
everything would be singular&mdash;men, land and sea. He would find
interest in the problem presented by chains of tiny islands, which
seem to suggest a submerged mountain ridge, showing its summits
above water. He would find interest also in studying the manners of
peoples isolated for so many centuries from the rest of mankind,
and still preserving, perhaps, the life of the primitive man. Here,
we find, says Le Maire, as in the first age of which the poets
write, man wholly simple, as produced by nature. What an
opportunity for French philosophers of the age of Rousseau! And,
further, we would be able to study not only man brutal and savage,
like the natives of New Holland, who live like fierce animals in
herds in the woods, but also men who have made some advance in
civilization, by using "the portion of intelligence that Heaven has
given them."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from such a colony the seamen might explore the
Southern Continent, find out what New Zealand is, where no European
has ever set foot, rediscover the land where Drake had landed, and
the country which Davis had seen, and which Roggeveen had failed to
find. Juan Fernandez, one of the finest places in the universe,
should be settled and fortified. Spain would much prefer that it
should be in the hands of French friends rather than remain a safe
refuge for British pirates, who by pillage and smuggling devastate
the Spanish coasts.</p>
<p>But "Australasia" has still greater attractions as a place of
settlement. Here are solid masses of land that are known to exist,
New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, Carpentaria (Cape York Peninsula),
New Guinea, New Britain, New Zealand; though these lands are
probably not one continent, but huge islands separated by unknown
straits. Here is the opportunity for France to do things on a large
scale, and in the grand style. "If Spain, Portugal, and Holland
have immortalised their names by discoveries and colonies, they
have left to France a great and noble task; to France, to whom are
due the earliest maritime enterprise in the discovery of the
Canaries and Guinea, and of Australasia itself; France, who now
sees herself able, by reason of the flourishing condition of her
East India Company, to make progress, soon if she wishes, that will
place her level with the three other nations, and give her even in
these distant regions the rank that she holds in the European
Republic!"</p>
<p>Which of the Australasian lands shall have the honour to be the
scene of French enterprise? New Zealand and Van Diemen's Land are
too distant, too Southerly, too unknown. In New Holland landing
seems to be everywhere difficult. Pelsart's voyage shows that the
West coast is beset by an infinite number of little islands. The
land near the sea is sterile and naked, like soil that the ocean
has only just left uncovered, before the action of sun and rain, or
accumulation of vegetable matter, have had time to make a soil in
which plants and trees may grow and flourish. That on the coast
looks stillborn. It offers no curiosity except a wood that can be
used for dyeing, gum trees, and shells of wonderful beauty and
size, The natives are brutal and stupid, unable to work, insensible
of the advantages of commerce. Dampier writes about a dangerous
labyrinth of waterless islands. Carpentaria also has a difficult
and unattractive coast. New Holland, then, is unsuitable for
enterprise at present, though later explorations in the interior
may reveal rich and civilized natives, the Mexicans and Peruvians
of Australasia. On the other hand, "the Austral Land of the Holy
Spirit" is, according to the report of Quiros, exceedingly
attractive; but it has not been explored for a century and a half,
and is therefore not the place for immediate settlement. There are
agreeable descriptions of New Guinea, but its coasts though
beautiful are very high and difficult. Fertile islands further West
are near Batavia, and the Dutch would certainly trouble a new
settlement.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the best site for a colony is New
Britain. The words of Dampier and Roggeveen suffice as testimony to
its fertility, and to its commercial advantages. Situated in the
Latitude of the Spice Islands, it will produce spices as good as
the spices of the Moluccas. If spices do not grow there, they can
be planted, and will certainly flourish. Thus the French will share
the lucrative monopoly of the Dutch. New Britain has also an
admirable geographical situation. It is near the Moluccas and the
Philippines, yet not too near. It is conveniently placed for trade
with China, with the Ladrones, with the innumerable islands of the
Pacific. It will form an excellent "entrep&ocirc;t de commerce." It will
be a suitable basis for the exploration of Carpentaria, the Austral
Land of the Holy Spirit, New Holland, New Zealand, and Van Diemen's
Land, whether these lands are one continent, as some think, or are
separated by straits, as seems more probable. One would learn what
these lands are, and what are their utilities. Discovery might
gradually extend from the Tropics to the South Polar Circle. A ship
might be sent to see if there is a strait behind Rosemary Island,
as Dampier suspected; to see if some arm of the sea separates
Carpentaria from New Holland; to find if the land of Quiros is as
promising as he says; to make the grand tour of Australasia as
Tasman made it. Thus the geography of this great part of the world
would be made clear; an exploit sufficient by itself to make men
immortal.</p>
<p>The expedition should sail, not from France, but from
Pondicherry, the French fort in India. Three ships should be sent,
and they should be well equipped. For it is an enterprise truly
royal, and glory must be preferred to profit. It would be well to
explore the West coast of New Britain, hitherto unvisited;&mdash;a
suggestion that might have brought the French to Rabaul.</p>
<p>Thus de Brosses sketched the outline of a scheme which, he
hoped, would make France mistress of the New World of the South.
Honour and glory were to be won, not by conquest, but by discovery,
by commerce, and by settlement. And it is important to notice the
stress that was placed on settlement. Frenchmen were not merely to
discover, and to trade; they were also to colonize, to form
permanent communities that were to be the roots of further
enterprises, and to give political and military power. It was a
proposal to found a French Empire in the South.</p>
<p>And de Brosses faced the great question that he had raised. Is
it, or is it not, desirable that a European nation should possess
colonies that would make it a World Empire? There were Some who
held that a State is weakened by colonization. The Spanish Empire,
it was argued, had been fatal to the Spanish nation. Spain had been
neglected, in order that gold mines might be exploited. Is it not
better to be a healthy and prosperous Nation than a diseased and
decadent Empire?</p>
<p>De Brosses discusses this question in a passage that is very
interesting. Colonization, rightly understood and rightly managed,
should be, he argues, not the destruction of the Nation, but its
expansion. It should tend, not to diminish the population, but
greatly to increase it. A Frenchman who becomes a colonist doss not
cease to be a Frenchman. He is a Frenchman living in favourable
circumstances, that enable him to render the French State special
services. Mother country and colony should help each other to grow.
The mother country founds the colony and protects it. The colony
enriches the mother country with the products of the earth, and
provides work and wages for more artificers, manufacturers,
fishermen, and seamen. Thus from its colonies a European Nation
should gain increased wealth, increased population, and increased
Power of the Sea; and one cannot too often say in France, and in
1756, that "he who is master of the Sea is master of the Land." In
short the future belongs not to the European Nation as it is, but
to the European nation expanded by colonization into a World
Empire.</p>
<p>And, to descend from high to low, there is one particular way in
which mother country and colony should be useful to each other. A
State, like a house, requires a sewer. There must be some
arrangement for the discharge of uncleanness, and the outlet should
be placed at a reasonable distance. If the matter is properly
managed the uncleanness disappears, and nothing remains save the
fecundity it has given to the soil. A criminal is intolerable in a
civilised community, but he may render good service in a young
colony, and may eventually become a respectable freeman. Rome
herself was founded by a gang of bandits. Criminal women would be
especially useful in this way; for "a woman who bears a child each
year is a treasure to an infant colony." Common beggars and
vagabonds will also be useful colonists, and Foundling Hospitals
will be a "species of reservoir distributing streams of population
to the colonies." It would not be wise to <i>found</i> a colony
with this material. But, when a colony has been established, the
deportation of criminals will greatly increase its prosperity.</p>
<p>As for the Spanish Empire, it is not a model to be copied, but
an example to be avoided. Frenchmen should take their lessons not
from the Spaniards but from the Dutch, who have generally aimed,
not at conquest, but at commerce and cultivation, and who have made
their colony at the Cape one of the most agreeable and rich
possessions in the world. In the cantons of Terra Australis,
Frenchmen should found colonies which should exhibit the Dutch
virtues, and be exempt from the Dutch faults. "A colony placed in a
land analogous to that from which the Dutch get their precious
products, sustained by a strong marine in the motherland,
frequently visited by her ships, often recruited both by young free
citizens and by criminal slaves, distributed gratuitously at first
among the colonists, who will not be able to buy the expensive
slaves of Africa, such a colony, I say, cannot fail to grow and to
bear fruit." For a commercial colony is far more valuable than a
gold colony. It produces a greater navigation, and a greater
population; more wealth, and more strength.</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>De Brosses' discourses were written by a very patriotic French
gentleman who regarded Great Britain as his country's worst enemy.
Yet they are now far more interesting to Englishmen than to
Frenchmen. Reading them, we find ourselves for the first time in
touch with the ideas which sent forth Cook and Banks to explore the
Pacific, which founded the convict colony in New South Wales, and
which have given the British race supremacy in the Southern
lands.</p>
<p>And British students saw at once the interest of de Brosses'
argument. In 1766 John Callender published the first volume of his
<i>Terra Australis Cognita</i>&mdash;the second and third volumes
were published in 1768&mdash;a work which is in the main a free
translation of de Brosses, with additions, omissions, and
modifications, which are made with the object of showing that the
arguments which the Frenchman addressed to his fellow-countrymen
have still greater force when addressed to the British.</p>
<p>Though it may be true, argues Callender, that French de
Gonneville first discovered the Austral lands, it is also true, as
de Bross&eacute;s' own volumes show, that "the best and surest accounts of
this Terra Australis are deduced from our own navigators, Drake,
Narborough, Cavendish, Dampier, and others." And the British are
far better able to achieve the Empire of the South than are the
French. De Brosses, writing in 1756, had bitterly complained that
Great Britain was "visibly affecting the monarchy of the sea." When
Callender wrote ten years later, Great Britain had won the war, and
her possession of Sea Power was indisputable. Insolent is the
victors' triumph! "Vain," writes Callender, "are the repeated
exhortations of the French writer, addressed to a nation which is
so far from being able to prosecute new discoveries that they have
been stripped by the late war of the best foreign settlements they
possessed; and by the ruin of their marine seem totally disabled at
present to attempt anything of moment in this way. Far other is the
case of this happy island. United among ourselves, respected by
foreigners, with our marine force entire, and (humanly speaking)
invincible, aided by a set of Naval officers superior in every
respect to those of the nations around us, with a Sovereign on the
throne who is filled with the most ardent and laudable desire of
seeing his native country great and flourishing. These, I say, are
incitements that seem to render everything possible to Great
Britain. The extensive countries of the Terra Australis, hitherto
untouched, open to us a field worthy of our attention in every
respect." And Callender proceeds, with amazing coolness, to steal
every one of de Brosses' arguments and to address them to his
British readers. He thinks&mdash;as de Brosses had thought before
him, and as Dampier and Campbell had thought before de
Brosses&mdash;that the best place for a settlement is New Britain,
the island discovered, he reminds his readers, by "our celebrated
navigator, Dampier." De Brosses had said that the flourishing
condition of the French East India Company would enable it to found
the colony. Well, the French East India Company had now ceased to
flourish, while on the other hand the English East India Company,
after the deeds of Clive, will find it "easy to extend themselves
into Australasia." The expedition should start not from
Pondicherry, but from Madras. Australasia, argues Callender, must
fall to Great Britain because Great Britain possesses the Sea
Power. And Callender was right.</p>
<p>We have been studying in this chapter the growth of the ideas
which produced the South Sea voyages of those navigators among whom
Cook stands pre-eminent. It remains to mention a writer whose book,
like that of de Brosses, was in the Library of the
<i>Endeavour</i>, and which was carefully considered by the
voyagers.</p>
<p>Alexander Dalrymple was a servant of the British East India
Company. In his youth he had been fascinated by the stories of
Columbus and Magellan, and had longed himself to be the hero in
some great voyage of discovery. At Madras he studied the old
records of the Company, and was impressed by the great value of the
commerce in the Eastern islands from which the English had been
driven by the Dutch. In 1759 he refused a good position at Madras,
and took command of a small ship in which he made voyages to "the
Eastern parts." He obtained exact knowledge of those parts, and won
the reputation of a highly skilled hydrographer. In 1765 he
returned to England, and engaged in eager study of the forgotten
documents which told the story of the exploration of the South Sea.
He obtained possession of the Memorial of Arias; and, studying a
sentence<sup>*</sup> in the light of recent discoveries, he saw
that Torres must have sailed through a Strait between New Guinea
and New Holland some thirty-eight years before Tasman had declared
in his map that there was no Strait but only a Shallow Bight.</p>
<p class="note">[* Arias said that Torres sighted "a very extensive
coast which he took for that of New Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands);
from thence he sailed Westwards, having constantly <i>on the right
hand</i> the coast of another very great land which he continued
coasting, according to his own reckoning, more than six hundred
leagues, having it still <i>on the right hand</i>." Dalrymple did
not obtain Torres' own letter till a much later date. His
translation of it was first published in Burney's <i>Voyages</i> in
1806, with a remark that it had "lately" been obtained.]</p>
<p>But the main result of Dalrymple's studies was that he became a
disciple of Quiros, a fervent believer in the great rich unknown
continent of the South. In the South Seas still remained the
opportunity for a new Columbus, a more successful Quiros. And
Dalrymple hoped that he would himself be the hero of the last great
story of discovery. He hoped to obtain command of a South Sea
expedition. And meanwhile he busied himself in preparing for the
press his <i>Collection of Voyages to the South Seas</i>, a work
which was published in, 1770. But Dalrymple wrote not primarily for
the student of History. His main purpose was to point out, not how
much had been done, but how much remained to do. And already in
1767 he had in print a tiny volume, not published till 1769,
entitled <i>Discoveries in the South Pacific to 1764</i>, in which
he summed up once more the argument which claimed to prove that the
Southern Continent exists, and that it is well worth finding. The
volume, which was to play an important part in the voyage of the
<i>Endeavour</i>, had a map which marked Torres' route through his
Strait, and which illustrated the argument of the text that a
continent must occupy the unknown South.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See Illustration 54, immediately below.]</p>
<p>Once more it is urged that the existence of the continent is
based on nothing less than physical necessity. Land in the South
<i>must</i> balance land in the North. Now, within the Tropics, it
is true, the lands to the South <i>do</i> fairly balance those to
the North. But in the temperate regions there is nothing in the
<i>known</i> South to balance the great mass of land in the North.
Therefore, in the <i>unknown</i> South a continent must exist.
Dalrymple's conclusion is that "the space unknown from the Tropics
to 50&deg; S. Lat. <i>must</i> be nearly all land."<sup>*</sup> And,
though this fact has not been proved by "absolute experience,"
proof has been given sufficiently convincing to the eye of faith.
Again and again land had been seen exactly where, according to laws
of physical necessity, land <i>must</i> be. In the late sixteenth
century, Juan Fernandez had found West of Chili in 40&deg; a very
"fertile and agreeable continent, inhabited by a white and
well-proportioned people." In 1599 Gerrards in 64&deg; had seen
mountains which seemed to extend to the Solomons. In 1606 Quiros
had seen indications of land in 26&deg;, and again in 17&deg;. In 1616 Le
Maire had seen the same in 51c&deg;, in 1624 the crew of the <i>Orange
Tree</i> had seen the continent in 50&deg;, and again in 41&deg;.</p>

<p>In 1685 Davis had seen it in 28&deg;. It is true that in 1722
Roggeveen had failed to rediscover Davis Land; but in the same
locality he had discovered Easter Island, an island of singular
interest in respect to the continent which must lie near at hand.
"It is from the descriptions of that island that we are enabled to
form some idea of the continent adjoining; no voyage hitherto
performed points out so strongly the original of the Peruvian
manners and religion. That country whence Mango Capac introduced
arts, laws, manufactures, and all the comforts of civilised life,
cannot fail of amply rewarding the fortunate people who shall
bestow letters instead of quippus, and iron in place of more
awkward substitutes." Easter Island is not the Southern Continent,
but its archaeological relics confirm the theory that this
continent was the source of the civilization of
Peru.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See elaborate description of these relics in
Mrs. Routledge's <i>Easter Island</i>.]</p>
<p>What, then, is the geographical conclusion? It is that the coast
of the Southern Continent runs Northward on a line "but a very
little West of the common track towards Juan Fernandez island,"
that it turns Westward about 28&deg;, and joins the land of which
Quiros saw signs in 26&deg; and in 17&deg;. Thence it probably runs
South-West to Tasman's Staten Land (New Zealand), which may, no
doubt, be islands, but which is more likely to be the Western side
of the continent. It appears, then, that in Latitude 40&deg; the
continent extends over one hundred degrees of Longitude, that is to
say it is larger than the whole of Asia from Turkey to the
extremity of China, and it has the riches of the country from which
the first Inca came to Peru! What a country, he added in the
edition of 1770, for the British merchant now in trouble about
declining trade in America! The American colonies have a population
of two million. The Southern Continent probably has a population of
fifty millions!" The scraps from this table would be sufficient to
maintain the power, dominion, and sovereignty of Britain by
employing all its manufacturers and ships."</p>
<p>Dalrymple had good hopes that he might be given the opportunity
to be the Columbus of the South. In 1768 the British Government
consented to the request of the Royal Society that a ship should be
sent to some island in the South Seas to observe the transit of
Venus. It was understood that the opportunity would be taken to
explore the South Seas, and to endeavour to solve their problems.
Dalrymple had commended himself to the Royal Society, and had
apparently persuaded them that his views deserved at least to be
tested. They recommended him to the Government as "a proper person
to be sent to the South Seas, having a particular turn for
discovery, and being a naval navigator, and well-skilled in
observations." But now came a fatal hitch. The Government was
willing that Dalrymple should go as a scientific observer; but the
commander of a King's ship must be an officer of the King's Navy.
Dalrymple, in reply, would go as commander or he would not go at
all! The end was that the man, who had spent his life in navigation
and in study of tropical seas, had to stay at home, and the command
was given to Lieutenant Cook, who had never even crossed the
Equator! Dalrymple never forgave the supplanter. But he gave a copy
of his booklet, which had been printed but not yet published, to a
young aristocrat, Mr. Joseph Banks, member of the Royal Society,
who also sailed on the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>In the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) Great Britain and France
fought their long fight in America to an end. But the spirit of
fight in them was stronger than ever, and it seemed possible that
the new battlefield would be Australasia. Neither country greatly
desired supremacy in the Pacific, but neither country was willing
that the other should attain it. There are curious personal links
connecting the fight that had ended in Canada and the fight that
seemed likely to begin in the Pacific. Bougainville, who nearly
discovered Eastern Australia in 1768, had been the favoured and
brilliant Aide-de-Camp of Montcalm.<sup>*</sup> Cook, who actually
discovered it in 1770, had sounded the St. Lawrence while
Bougainville fought on its banks.</p>
<p class="note">[* See Parkman's <i>Wolfe and Montcalm</i>.]</p>
<p>The war ended in 1763. In the same year the French government
determined to form that settlement on the Falkland Islands which,
according both to French and English geographers, would give
supremacy in the South Sea. The chivalrous Bougainville,
representative of qualities that have made French soldiers loved
even while feared, offered to found the settlement at his own
expense. "He has talent," Montcalm had written to his wife, "a warm
head and a warm heart. He will ripen in time." Bougainville had
ripened. He had fought the Canadian fight to an end; a bitter end
made sweet by brave sacrifice.</p>

1881.)</b></p>
<p>The field was lost, but all was not lost. French honour
remained, unstained and shining. The British had won the West. But
the South remained a virgin field for the chivalry of France. "The
French nation," wrote Bougainville, "is capable of conquering the
greatest difficulties, and nothing is impossible to her efforts, as
often as she will think herself equal at least to any nation in the
world."</p>
<p>Bougainville's offer was accepted. He chose for his colonists
"several Acadian families, a laborious intelligent set of people,
who ought to be dear to France on account of the inviolable
attachment they have shown, as honest but unfortunate citizens";
and with them he founded the first French colony in the South. In
the middle of the fort he erected a small obelisk. "The King's
effigy," he wrote, "adorned one of its sides, and under its
foundations we buried some coins, together with a medal, on one
side of which was graved the date of the undertaking, and on the
other the figure of the King, with the words 'Tibi serviat ultima
Thule.'"</p>
<p>But the British Government also was thinking about "ultima
Thule." The Falklands, it was explained, had been discovered by
Englishmen in the days of Elizabeth, and the claim was good though
old. So in 1764 it sent Byron with instructions to take possession,
and then to proceed on a voy.age of discovery in the Pacific. Byron
came to the Falklands in January 1765, "touched to the Westward of
our settlement," says Bougainville, "and took possession of these
islands for the Crown of England, without leaving a single
inhabitant there!" Then Byron, promising his sailors double pay for
a big and dangerous venture, sailed through the straits in weather
"dreadful beyond all description." Taking a West-North-West course
he came to the Northern end of the Society Islands, but missed
Tahiti. Thence he sailed North-West for the Ladrones. He discovered
a few small islands, but, writes Besant, "like Magellan, he seemed
to avoid discovering the archipelagos between which he passed by a
kind of miracle." He came home in 1766.</p>
<p>His ship, the <i>Dolphin</i>, was sent out again in the same
year under Wallis. With her sailed the <i>Swallow</i> under
Carteret, who in vain pointed to the fact that the ship was rotten.
They also took the route through the straits, and spent four months
in passing them! The <i>Swallow</i> sailed so badly, that Wallis in
the <i>Dolphin</i> got far ahead, and never saw her again. Wallis's
chief discovery was Tahiti, which he named "King George the Third's
Island." Then, like Byron, he took the well-worn route to the
Ladrones and Java, and came home in 1768. It was a quick voyage,
only six hundred and thirty-seven days, but unsatisfying to
curiosity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Carteret, in his rotten little ship, was making a
brave voyage. He came to Pitcairn Island, touched the Southern
groups of the Society Islands, and sailing thence on a course
<i>Southward</i> of that taken by Byron and Wallis, he rediscovered
Santa Cruz and the Solomon Islands. Two hundred years had passed
since Menda&ntilde;a had left these islands. No other European, so far as
we know, had visited them; no one knew where they were, and some
doubted their existence. Tasman thought he was among them when, in
reality, he was among the Fijis. Carteret rediscovered them, but
did not recognise them. Thence, compelled by extreme distress to
abandon his desire to make discoveries in the unknown South, he
sailed for New Britain, discovered the strait between that island
and New Ireland, sailed through it, and discovered the Admiralty
Islands. Bougainville overtook him as he neared home. "His ship,"
wrote the Frenchman, "was very small, went very ill, and when we
took leave of him, he remained as it were at anchor. How much he
must have suffered, in so bad a vessel, may well be conceived."
Carteret came home in March 1769, nearly a year after Wallis's
return.</p>
<p>If Englishmen sailed the Pacific, Frenchmen must do the same,
and must do it better. In November 1766&mdash;three months after
Wallis and Carteret had sailed&mdash;Bougainville also sailed with
two ships, the <i>Boudeuse</i> and the <i>Etoile</i>. His orders
were "to proceed to the East Indies by crossing the South Seas
between the Tropics." On his way he was to give the Falklands to
France's ally Spain, who claimed them as belonging to South
America. This business delayed him; it was not till December 1767
that he entered the straits, a year behind the Englishmen, whose
initials and names he found cut on Patagonian trees. He noted, for
the benefit of scientific friends, that the Patagonians are tall
but not gigantic.</p>
<p>Then he began systematic search for Terra Australis. He looked
in vain for Davis Land, and "according to M. de Bellin's Chart," he
writes, "I must have sailed over it." Then he looked for the coast
marked in the Charts in about 18&deg; to 20&deg;, and described as "lands
and islands seen by Quiros." There were plenty of islands but no
trace of a continent, and Bougainville concluded that geographers
had deceived themselves. "Upon the whole," he writes with admirable
sense, "I know not on what grounds our geographers lay down, after
these isles, a beginning of land seen, as they say, by Quiros, to
which they give seventy leagues of extent...If any considerable
land existed hereabouts, we could not fail meeting with it...I
agree that it is difficult to conceive such a number of low
islands, and almost drowned lands, without supposing a continent
near them. But geography is a science of facts; in studying it,
authors must by no means give way to any system formed in their
studies, unless they would run the risk of being subject to very
great errors, which can be rectified only at the expense of
navigators."</p>
<p>Bougainville found no continent, but he found that which made
amends. In April 1768 he came to the lovely island which Wallis had
visited ten months before. Wallis had called it "King George the
Third's Island." Bougainville, for sufficient reasons; called it
"New Cythera"; but he found that the natives called it "Taiti"
(Tahiti). He described its charms with the words of a lover. Every
prospect pleased, and men and women&mdash;especially
women&mdash;pleased still more. Tahiti became the Paradise of the
sensual man, who has forgotten the Ten Commandments, and desires to
enjoy "the ease of the golden age."</p>
<p>Before sailing from Tahiti, Bougainville "buried an act of
taking possession, inscribed on an oak plank, and a bottle well
corked and glued, containing the names of the officers of both
ships." A native named Aotourou begged that he might be allowed to
sail with them, and Bougainville assented, thinking that he would
be of use on their island-voyage, and that his eventual return,
enriched by useful knowledge, would cement the French alliance
"with a powerful people living in the midst of the finest countries
in the world." In 1916 we saw in Sydney Tahitian soldiers on their
way to fight the battle of France.</p>
<p>Sailing from Paradise, after only a fortnight's stay, on a
course more <i>Southerly</i> than that taken by the British,
Bougainville came in May 1768 to the group of islands which he
called "the Archipelago of the Navigators," and which we call
Samoa. Hence he took a very bold course, slightly South of West,
precisely the course which again and again in the course of one
hundred and fifty years had been deliberately declined by seaman
after seaman&mdash;by Schouten, Tasman, Roggeveen&mdash;as certain
to lead to great danger on the unknown coast South of New Guinea.
It was a course which had been taken only once before, by Torres in
1606.</p>
<p>Sailing on this course, Bougainville came in May to a group of
islands of singular interest in our story. He named them "the Isle
of Pentecost," "Aurora," "Pic de l'Etoile," and "the Isle of
Lepers." On the last of these islands he landed, collected wood and
fruit, and "buried at the foot of a tree the Act, taking possession
of these isles, engraved on an oak plank." But the natives seemed
bad, and the fruit was not as good as in New Cythera. But there
were other lands to the South and to the West; in fact "we saw land
in all parts of the horizon; we were, so to say, shut up in a great
gulf." It was hard to make out whether the lands were continuous,
or were divided by passages. Bougainville sailed along the Western
side of the "great gulf," by a fine shore covered with trees, and
with patches of land apparently cultivated, and he came to a "great
inlet" with an opening five or six leagues wide. He sailed into it
two or three leagues, and came to a "fine bay." No bottom could be
found with a two hundred fathom line. Two boats were landed to
reconnoitre. The natives shot a couple of arrows, which served the
sailors as a pretext for a general discharge of muskets. "The
negroes howled excessively in the woods, where we could hear their
drum beating. I immediately made signal to the boat to come on
board, and I took my measures to prevent our being dishonoured in
the future by such an abuse of the superiority of our power."</p>
<p>Bougainville's words bring memories to the student's mind, and
these memories were in his own mind as he wrote. He called the
group of islands "the archipelago of the Cyclades." But "as for
ourselves," he writes, "everything conspired to persuade us that it
was the 'Tierra Austral del Espiritu Santo.' Appearances seemed to
conform to Quiros's account; and what we daily discovered
encouraged our researches. It is singular enough that, exactly in
the same Latitude and Longitude where Quiros places his bay of St.
Philip and St. James, on a coast which at first sight seemed to be
that of a continent, we should find a passage exactly of the same
breadth which he assigns to the entrance of his bay."</p>
<p>Bougainville was right when he believed that he had stumbled on
Quiros's Espiritu Santo, unvisited since 1606. But he was, it
seems, wrong when he believed that he had entered the bay of St.
Philip and St. James. His chart seems to show that he did
<i>not</i> visit the North Side of Santo, where lies that bay. He
sailed through the passage between Santo and Malicolo, and
apparently the "great inlet" was somewhere in the passage.</p>
<p>However, he was in Espiritu Santo where Quiros and Torres had
been. And the geographical problem before him now was something
like that which Torres had faced when he sailed hence. But, whereas
Torres had plunged South-West in search of an unknown Terra
Australis, Bougainville knew that in that direction was the unknown
Eastern coast of New Holland. How far away was this coast it was
impossible to guess. Campbell had declared in 1744 that Espiritu
Santo was actually part of New Holland. And de Brosses' book of
1756 had printed a map which gave the same view. But de Brosses'
text, as Cook afterwards pointed out, in defiance of de Brosses'
map, declared that "all the vast interval lying between Leeuwin and
Quiros's discovery is so unknown that one cannot tell what part of
it is land, and what part is sea," and had thought "more likely"
the view that the unknown was, not one continent, but "large
islands, separated from each other by canals or arms of the sea."
Bougainville had now proved that, in respect to Espiritu Santo, de
Brosses' map was wrong, and de Brosses' text was right. The same
fact, we remember, had been proved one hundred and sixty years
before by Torres; but the route of Torres was known, it seems, only
by Dalrymple, and Dalrymple, who told the fact to Mr. Banks, did
not tell it to Bougainville. All that Bougainville knew was that,
somewhere to the West, must be the East coast of New Holland, and
he bravely resolved to sail Westward for three hundred and fifty
leagues. "I resolved," he writes, "to do it, though the condition
and the quantity of our provisions seemed to give us reason to make
the best of our way to some European settlement."</p>
<p>He therefore sailed West in Latitude 15&deg;. Had he persevered he
would have come to the Australian coast near Cooktown, and would,
likely enough, have been wrecked where Cook was wrecked two years
later. But, after a week's sail, he found himself in the midst of
dangers. He saw sandbanks and shoals, a low land to the South-West,
and breakers to the North-West that appeared to stretch without
end. "The sea broke with great violence on the shoals, and some
summits of rocks appeared above water. This last discovery was the
voice of God, and we were obedient to it...I gave orders to steer
North-East by East, abandoning the scheme of proceeding further
Westward in the Latitude of 15&deg;." He concluded that the Eastern
coast of New Holland was not much better than the Western coast
which Dampier had seen in the same Latitude. "I should willingly
believe, as he does, that this land is a cluster of isles, the
approach to which is made difficult by a dangerous sea, full of
shoals and sandbanks. After such an explanation, it would be
rashness to risk running in with a coast from whence no advantage
could be expected, and which one could not clear but by beating
against reigning winds. We had only bread for two months, and pulse
for forty days; the salt meat was in great quantities, but it was
noxious, and we preferred the rats. Thus it was by all means time
to go to the Northward, and even to deviate a little to the
Eastward of our course."</p>
<p>He sailed three days, and then "a delicious smell announced the
vicinity of the land." Bougainville had "seen but few lands which
bore a finer aspect; a low ground, divided into plains and groves,
lay along the seashore, and from thence rose like an amphitheatre
to the mountains whose summits were lost in clouds." He was on the
South side of New Guinea near the Eastern end, not far away from
the point at which Torres in his voyage from Espiritu Santo had
made land. Torres, greatly daring, had turned Westward, and had
found his Strait. But Bougainville had read no account of Torres'
route, and, though he thought it "probable" that a strait existed,
he dared not face the risk. Had he, like Cook, two years later, had
on board Dalrymple's Chart, showing the track of Torres, it seems
likely enough he would have turned Westward, and that a French and
not an English captain would have been second to thread the
Strait.</p>
<p>Not daring to sail West, Bougainville had to sail East, and "to
endeavour to get out of this gulf as soon as possible." He found
himself in a position of extreme danger, caught in a huge gulf,
bristling with shoals and reefs and islets, while a South-Eastern
swell was heaving him towards the land. During a dreadful
fortnight, he fought to keep the ship off land, and gradually
groped a way Eastward. For days the fog was so thick that the two
ships were obliged to fire guns in order to keep company. "In the
dark, in the midst of a sea strewn with shoals, we were obliged to
shut our eyes to all signs of danger." Provisions were failing. The
allowance of bread and pulse was lessened. The pet dog and the pet
goat were eaten, and it was found necessary for medical reasons to
forbid the eating of old leather.</p>
<p>Bougainville was trying to get round the immense chain of
islets, reefs, and shoals that makes the Eastern tail of New
Guinea. At last he succeeded. "The Cape which we had so long wished
for" he named "Cape Deliverance," and the Gulf of which it formed
the Eastern point "Gulf of the Louisiade." "I think," he justly
adds, "we have well acquired the right of naming these parts."
Earlier navigators had "all followed the same track; we opened a
new one and paid dear for the honour of the first discovery."</p>

<br>
<b>56. PART OF MAP IN BOUGAINVILLE'S <i>Voyage autour du Monde</i>
(Paris, 1771.)</b></p>
<p>Bougainville's aim now was to round the North of New Britain. A
glance at the map shows that it was very likely that he would come
to the North-West Islands of the Solomons. We remember that
Carteret had seen some islands of the group the year before, and
had not recognised them. Bougainville also had no thought that he
was even near them. In the map, which he constructed, on his
return, he placed them in the Latitude of the Equator, and in a
Longitude slightly to the West of the Navigator Islands (Samoa);
and he wrote by them the curious words, "Solomon Islands of which
the existence and position are doubtful." His doubtful guess of the
position of islands that might not even exist, placed them five to
ten degrees too far to the North, and about thirty degrees too far
to the East. Yet, when he drew this map, he had just returned from
a voyage in the course of which he had visited, unknowingly, two of
the largest islands in the group.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See Illustration 56, directly above.]</p>
<p>He came to the island which he named Choiseul in July 1768. As
the French were anchoring in a fine bay, they were suddenly
attacked by ten war canoes, with one hundred and fifty men on
board, armed with bows, lances, and shields. They fought with
savage bravery, and a second discharge was needed to put them to
flight. The French captured two war-canoes, on one of which was
carved the head of a man with eyes of mother-of-pearl and ears of
tortoise-shell, the whole figure resembling a mask with a long
beard.<sup>*</sup> The cargo included the jaws of a man
half-broiled. "These islanders," writes Bougainville, "are black
and have curled hair, which they dye white, yellow, or red. Their
audacity in attacking us, their custom of bearing arms, and their
dexterous management of them, prove that they are almost constantly
at war." In short, though he did not suspect it, they were Solomon
Islanders, the artistic and murderous descendants of the artistic
and murderous enemies of Menda&ntilde;a.</p>
<p class="note">[* The Solomon Islanders, says Lord Amherst, are
"the artists of the Pacific."]</p>
<p>From Choiseul he sailed North-West, past the long hilly coast of
the island which is now called by his name. Then he passed a
smaller island which he named "Bonka," after the cry of natives,
who pretended to give cocoanuts, and then shot arrows. And then he
sailed away, still doubting that the Solomons
existed!<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* See <i>The Discovery of the Solomon Islands</i>,
p. lxxiv.]</p>
<p>And now where was New Guinea? Quiros had guessed that the
Solomons were near New Guinea. Bougainville thought that, if they
existed at all, they existed about twenty-five degrees away from
New Guinea. His voyage was to prove that he was wildly wrong, and
that Quiros was wonderfully right. Two days after losing sight of
the Solomons, Bougainville was at anchor in a bay of New Britain. A
sailor, looking for shells, found buried in the sand a piece of
lead with the remains of English words. The plate had been nailed,
but the savages had torn it down, and had broken it in pieces. It
was evidence to the French that Carteret had been there before
them, and they found vestiges of the English camp. "This," comments
Bougainville, "in a very strange chance by which we, among so many
lands, came to the very spot where the rival nation had left a
monument to an enterprise similar to ours."</p>
<p>The French had anchored in St. George's Bay in Dampier's New
Britain, the island which French and British geographers had agreed
to recommend as the best site for a colony in all Australasia. They
were in urgent need of refreshment, for they were in desperate
health, suffering from scurvy and "cruel famine." But their search
was strangely fruitless. To them New Britain was a land of snakes
and scorpions and earthquakes, strange insects, beautiful shells,
and tremendous cascades. They found little to eat except a few
thatch palms and cabbage trees, which they must dispute with
gigantic ants. Dampier's luck, explains Bougainville, had taken him
to Port Montague, "an inhabited district, which promised him
refreshments, and whereof the productions gave him room to conceive
great hopes concerning the country; and we, who were as indigent as
he was, fell in with a desert, which instead of supplying all our
wants, has only afforded us wood and water."</p>
<p>Bougainville, unlike Carteret, did not discover that St.
George's Bay was the opening of a passage separating New Britain
and New Ireland. He sailed round the North coast of New Ireland,
believing, as Dampier had believed, that it was part of New
Britain. Distress increased, but not one Frenchman was downhearted.
"The officers set the example, and the seamen never ceased dancing
in the evenings, as well in the time of scarcity as in that of the
greatest plenty. Nor was it necessary to double <i>their</i>
wages!" So, with light hearts in sick bodies, the French sailed the
long coast of New Guinea, which seemed "an everlasting chain of
islands." In fact, Bougainville formed the opinion that "all New
Guinea itself is a heap of great islands." At length he found a
passage which he called "the French passage," and made his way to
the little Dutch factory at Boero, and obtained refreshment. It was
full time. Not a man was free from scurvy. Half the crews were
unable to do duty. "If we had kept the sea another week, we should
have lost great numbers, and all would have fallen sick."</p>
<p>Boero was next best to Tahiti. The Dutch Governor's duty was to
explain that he was expressly forbidden to receive foreign ships
into port. But he accepted Bougainville's plea of urgent necessity,
and invited him to a supper, which was "one of the most delightful
moments" of his life. The Hollanders, he says, were so amazed by
the French hunger, that "none of them durst eat anything for fear
of wronging us. One must have been a sailor, and reduced to the
extremities which we had felt for several months together, in order
to form an idea of the sensations which the sight of greens and a
good supper may produce."</p>
<p>The passage to Batavia was one of the most difficult parts of
the voyage. The Dutch refused information, and "took the greatest
precaution to keep their charts secret," while the French charts
were "more proper to cause the loss of ships than to guide them."
However, the French arrived; and Bougainville's opinion was that
the Dutch deliberately exaggerated the dangers of the navigation.
He anchored in Batavia in September, 1768.</p>
<p>The people of Batavia tried to make the Frenchmen's stay
agreeable. There were feasts in town and country, concerts, and
charming walks. Bougainville was not ungrateful, but it was the
duty of a French patriot to say what advantages might be gained by
his country. His hosts were very wealthy, and they were also very
weak. Exclusive commerce had made the Company "more like a powerful
republic than a society of merchants"; but "the time is nigh at
hand when their monopoly will receive a mortal stroke. To desire
the destruction of this exclusive trade would be enough to effect
it. The great safety of the Dutch consists in the ignorance of the
rest of Europe concerning the true state of these isles, and in the
mysterious clouds which wrap this Garden of the Hesperides in
darkness." The Dutch build forts, but they are destroyed by
earthquakes. They send soldiers, seamen, and workmen; but the
malignant climate destroys two-thirds. The water is so bad that the
rich drink seltzer imported at great cost. It is true that the
Company destroys the spices that it cannot sell; but there are
spice islands that it does not know, and others that it cannot
conquer. The British frequent those parts, and not without design.
The voyages of Wallis and Carteret have meaning. And so, though he
does not say so, has the voyage of Bougainville. "Our author,"
comments the English translator, "endeavours to make it highly
probable that the spice trade will soon be divided among the
English and the French." From Batavia Bougainville sailed with a
very sick crew for the Isle of France. Then he called at the Cape,
where he admired the settlement of La Roch&eacute;lle, formed by
Protestant Frenchmen who still loved France. Carteret, whom he
wished to overtake, was still eleven days ahead. At Ascension
Bougainville had gained six days, and between Ascension and the
Azores he caught up. The two brave captains had friendly
conversation, and Carteret gave Bougainville an arrow he had found
on his voyage round the world, "a voyage that he was far from
suspecting we had likewise made." Then Bougainville sailed, left
behind the rotten little English ship, which seemed "as it were at
anchor," and came home in March 1769. In spite of distress and
disease, he had lost only seven in a voyage of two years and four
months. And the gallant soldier-seaman ends his admirable book with
words from his well-loved Virgil:&mdash;"Puppipus et laeti nautae
imposuere coronas."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII. THE VOYAGE OF THE
<i>ENDEAVOUR</i></h2>
<p><b>AUTHORITIES:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. THE LOGS.<br>
<br>
<i>(a)</i> One Log, which survives only in two fragments (6th Nov.,
1768-8th May, 1769, and 12th Feb.-23rd Sept., 1770), is in Cook's
own handwriting. The part of it which deals with the Australian
coast is printed, as Cook's "Private Log," in the <i>Historical
Records of New South Wales</i>, vol. i. part i. p. 1.<br>
<i>(b)</i> Bladen (<i>Historical Records of New South Wales</i>,
vol. i. part i. p. 289) says that the "Palliser Log" also is
"beyond any doubt in the handwriting of Cook himself." Wharton,
however, says that it is "not autograph." The specimens which
Bladen prints are not, in my opinion, in Cook's handwriting, and
suggest a clerk's copy of his "Private Log."<br>
<i>(c)</i> Another Log, left to the British Museum by Sir Joseph
Banks, was written by the principal officer, for the time being, of
the ship. The Australian part is printed, as Cook's "Official Log,"
in the <i>Historical Records of New South Wales</i>, vol. i. part
i. p. 79.<br>
<i>(d)</i> Several of the seamen also kept Logs which are of
considerable interest. The Australian parts are printed in the
<i>Historical Records of New South Wales</i>, vol. i. part i.<br>
<br></li>
<li>2. COOK'S JOURNALS.<br>
<br>
<b>{* In the <a href="#pubnote">Publisher's Note</a> at the
beginning of this book it is stated, contrary to what is stated in
this section, that the "autograph of Cook's <i>Journal</i>, and
also of the <i>Instructions</i> and <i>Secret Instructions</i>
issued to him" did in fact exist at the time of publication of the
book. Wood only became aware of this after the book had been
printed off.}</b><br>
<br>
In addition to the daily "Log," Cook wrote, during the leisure of
the voyage, a fuller account in a Journal. Banks refers to "the
Captain's own journals, which the clerk has copied." "The Captain's
own journals" have unhappily disappeared. "No autograph journal,"
wrote Wharton in 1893, "is, so far as is known, in existence." He
had therefore to print a <i>copy</i>. There survive, however, a few
pages in Cook's handwriting.<br>
<i>(a)</i> In the Australian Museum, Sydney, there are a few pages
in Cook's handwriting, dealing with New Zealand. I can learn
nothing of their history, but I am confident that they are
authentic. There is a full account of experiences at Poverty Bay on
the 9th, 10th and 11th of October. Cook first wrote <i>Endeavour
Bay</i>, and then crossed out this name and wrote <i>Poverty
Bay</i>. This account is fairly similar to that in the copy of
Cook's Journal, though there are differences. One wonders whether
this is a fragment of the original Journal on which the copy was
based. But then cornes a gap of thirteen days. Then very slight
entries for October 24th and 25th. Then a brief <i>enumeration</i>
of the characteristics of the Maoris. Then very slight entries from
October 30th to November 5th. Then a list of points to be noticed
in description of an unnamed Bay, and of the River Thames. Then
slight entries from November 25th to 27th. I get the impression
that these pages are a fragment of Cook's first <i>rough notes</i>,
afterwards worked into the lost Journal, which the clerk
copied.<br>
<i>(b)</i> There are also in the Australian Museum Cook's autograph
observations of the Transit of Venus, the autograph "Rules" to be
observed at Tahiti, a scrap from an autograph Journal of the second
voyage, and several very important autograph letters. Though these
documents have no history, I am confident that they are authentic.
There exists, somewhere in England, a page in Cook's handwriting,
which records the events of three days (4th, 5th, and 6th May), at
Botany Bay. The name <i>Stingray Bay</i> is corrected to
<i>Botanist Bay</i>. Mr. Kitson, in the 1912 popular edition of his
life of Cook (p, 149), describes this page as "the only page known
to exist of the Journal of the first voyage written by Cook." I
have not seen this page; but the facsimile shows that the record is
very much shorter than that of the copy. I again get the impression
that, like the pages in the Australian Museum, this is a fragment,
not of Cook's Journal, but of rough notes that were afterwards
expanded into the Journal. It certainly seems curious that this one
page&mdash;a particularly interesting page&mdash;should alone
survive. But it seems to be authentic.<br>
<br></li>
<li>3. COPIES OF COOK'S JOURNAL. There are three <i>copies</i> of
Cook's Journal.<br>
<br>
<i>(a)</i> There is a copy which was appropriated by Sir Philip
Stephens, the Secretary of the Admiralty, and which eventually came
by sale to Mr. Corner, who determined to print it. It was edited by
Admiral Wharton in 1893. It stops at the arrival at Batavia. I have
carefully examined it, and I have found no reason to question the
accepted opinion that it is the copy which Cook sent to Stephens
from that port. It is in the handwriting of a clerk. But there are
corrections in Cook's hand. Under 14th June, 1770, there is a
curious marginal note in Cook's hand (see <a href=
"#il-57">Illustration 57</a>). A good many corrections of names of
places have been made; sometimes, in my opinion, in the hand of the
clerk who wrote the Journal, and sometimes in other hands, Mr.
Bonwick's criticisms of this Journal in his booklet, <i>Cook in New
South Wales</i>, do not seem to me to be well-founded. The change
of geographical names, e.g. the change of "Stingray" to "Botany,"
does not affect the historical value of the Journal. On the
contrary, the erased <i>Stingray</i> would suffice to prove, if
proof were necessary, the early date of the Journal. It was bought
by Mr. Dangar, and presented to the Australian Museum, Sydney. It
is generally quoted as the "Corner" Journal.<br>
<i>(b)</i> There is a copy possessed by the Admiralty, and now in
the Public Record Office, which tells the story of the whole
voyage. It is, says Wharton, in the handwriting of the same clerk.
The part which tells the story of the voyage from Batavia to London
is printed by Wharton. It is generally quoted as the "Admiralty"
Journal. There is evidence that it was written later than the
"Corner" Journal.<br>
<i>(c)</i> A third copy is at Windsor Castle, and "from its
appearance," says Wharton, "was kept for and probably presented to
George III." "It has been written with especial care and by several
hands. It was evidently the last in point of time." In that case it
seems curious that it should "terminate a few days before reaching
Batavia." No doubt it was because at that point the voyage of
<i>discovery</i> ended.<br>
"The three copies," writes Wharton, "are practically identical,
except for the period August 13th to 19th, 1770, during which the
wording is often different, though the events are the same." For
that period Cook's clerk seems, in the two later copies, to have
had the use of Banks's Journal.<br>
I regret that I have been unable to consult copies (b) and (c). A
comparison of the three copies would be interesting; though it is
unlikely that it would lead to any important change of view.<br>
<br></li>
<li><a name="banks-man-jnl" id="banks-man-jnl"></a>BANKS'S
MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS. In the Preface to his edition, Sir Joseph
Hooker traced the history of the Journal to the auction sale of
Banksian MSS. at Sotheby's on the 14th April, 1886. At that sale
"Banks's Journal of a Voyage to the Sandwich Islands (!) and New
Zealand, from March 1769 to July 1771, in the autograph of Banks,"
was sold as lot 176 to an autograph dealer named Waller for &pound;7 2s.
6d. In 1893 Waller, when questioned, "did not specially remember
the purchase, and he does not believe that he has got the
manuscript." "So that where it is now," wrote Mr. Carruthers, late
Keeper of the Botanical Collections at the British Museum, "no one
knows." To this statement, Sir Joseph Hooker added in 1896 the
following note:&mdash;"I have since ascertained that the Journal
came into the possession of J. Henniker Heaton, Esq., M.P., who
informs me that he disposed of it to a gentleman in Sydney, New
South Wales." Being unable to get the use of the Journal, Hooker
printed part&mdash;about one half&mdash;of a <i>copy</i> which had
been made by direction of his grandfather, Mr. Turner, a friend of
Banks.<br>
The "gentleman in Sydney" was Mr. Alfred Lee, who sold the Journal
to Mr. Mitchell, and it is now the treasure of the Mitchell
Library, Sydney. It is a complete Journal, in Banks's handwriting,
of the whole voyage from the first day (25th August, 1768) to the
last (12th July, 1771). That is to say, this Mitchell
Journal&mdash;the Journal which "came into the possession" of Mr.
Henniker Heaton&mdash;is <i>not</i> the <i>fragment</i> of a
Journal that was sold at Sotheby's for &pound;7 2s. 6d. That fragment
went elsewhere. Where it went we will notice a little later.<br>
That the Journal in the Mitchell Library is the Journal written by
Banks on the <i>Endeavour</i> is, in my opinion, certain. It is
written in Banks's handwriting in its youthful vigour. It shows the
changes of form that one would expect in a Journal written,
sometimes from day to day, sometimes after an interval of a few
days, sometimes&mdash;as in the long descriptions of the South Sea
Islands, of New Zealand, and of New Holland&mdash;in the leisure of
the voyage. Banks frequently refers to the writing of the Journal.
He jots down the joyful days at Tahiti with such haste that he
fears he will be unable to read his own writing. He wishes his
London friends could see him sitting "journalising" at his table in
mid-ocean, while Solander botanises at the other side.<br>
A close examination shows that Banks wrote in loose sections of
four unstitched folded sheets&mdash;each section, that is to say,
making sixteen pages. Before writing, he folded each page at the
top and on both sides, in order to mark space for headlines and for
marginal notes. When he got home, he bound these sections in two
volumes. The binding was so done that some part of the marginal
notes is hidden from view; a fact which <i>proves</i> that they
were written before the volume was bound. In the middle of these
sections, Banks bound an account of various electrical experiments
written, at various dates in the course of the voyage, on "separate
papers," i.e. in another section of four folded sheets; another
proof that the binding was done after the return.<br>
On reaching the end of a part of the Journal, Banks sometimes left
a blank space. On the blank space at the end of the description of
New Zealand, he added at a later date&mdash;this is indicated by
the handwriting&mdash;a note that he had learnt at the Cape that
ships, sailing a second voyage, could easily take in good
provisions there. Banks frequently added to and corrected the
Journal. He twice corrected "Stingray" to "Botany," and changed
"New Holland" into "that part of New Holland now called New South
Wales" (see p. 443). In one place&mdash;MS. Journal, vol. i. p.
342&mdash;he added a marginal note dated 21st January, 1772, i.e.
six months after his return to England.<br>
It is highly desirable that this Journal should be printed and
edited.<br>
What became of the fragment of a Journal in Banks's handwriting
dated&mdash;according to Sotheby's Catalogue&mdash;March 1769 to
July 1771? In the Free Public Library, Auckland, New Zealand, are
three documents in Banks's handwriting. I have not seen them, but
their nature has been described by Mr. H. Shaw in his "Guide to the
principal manuscripts in the Auckland Free Public Library"; and
photographs of some pages have been sent to the Mitchell Library.
The three documents are:(i) an account of the islands in the South
Seas, including a separate account of Tahiti, which is dated March
1769; (ii) a Journal dated from October 1769 to October 1770, which
seems to be a digest of Cook's Journal; (iii) a Log of the voyage
from Batavia to England, which ends on 9th July, 1771. It seems to
me certain that these three documents formed the one item
described, very inaccurately, in Sotheby's Catalogue, as the
"Journal," and sold as lot 176, for &pound;7 2s. 6d. They are still in
"quarto sheets in folds unbound"; save the description of Tahiti,
which is on a foolscap folio sheet. One may guess that, during the
tedious voyage, Banks passed the time in writing these documents,
but, when he came home, did not think it worth while to bind
them.<br>
<br></li>
<li>4. THE JOURNAL OF PARKINSON, Banks's botanical draughtsman, has
interesting illustrations, but adds little information of
value.<br>
<br></li>
<li>5. On the 28th September, 1771, a publisher named Becket
published a <i>Journal of a Voyage Round the World</i>, written by
one of the voyagers, who, Becket was convinced, was "a gentleman
and a scholar." My guess is that the anonymous author was James
Magra, the American midshipman who, twelve years later, with name
changed to Matra, brought forward, after consultation with Banks, a
noteworthy proposal for the foundation of a colony in New South
Wales. This Journal, however, is of very little historical
importance. The most noteworthy facts are that, to the writer,
Botany Bay is "Stingray Harbour," and that he does not write "New
South Wales."<br>
<br></li>
<li>6. HAWKESWORTH'S VOYAGES OF COOK. As the Journals of Cook and
Banks were not considered to be sufficiently literary for print,
and as neither had time to prepare them for the press, they were
handed to Hawkesworth to be used as the basis of a narrative which
he put into the mouth of Cook. It has no use to those who have read
the Journals.<br>
<br></li>
<li>7. The only valuable early <i>Life of Cook</i> is that by Dr.
George Young (1835), a former Vicar of Whitby, who resided for
thirty years "near the spot where Cook was born, and amidst the
scenes where he passed his childhood and youth"; and who had
"intercourse with his relations, friends and acquaintances,
including one or two surviving school companions."<br>
<br></li>
<li>8. BROUGHAM'S LIFE OF SIR JOSEPH BANKS (in <i>Lives of Men of
Letters and Science who Flourished in the Time of George III</i>.)
gets value from the fact that Brougham's father was a school chum
of Banks, and that "in consequence of this old connexion" Brougham
had interesting conversations with Banks in his old age.<br>

<b>57. EXTRACT FROM THE "CORNER" COPY OF COOK'S JOURNAL<br>
(The marginal note is in Cook's hand-writing.)</b></p>
<p>On the 24th of November, 1639, an Englishman, the ingenious Mr.
Horrocks, first observed the transit of Venus across the
sun.<sup>*</sup> Towards the end of the seventeenth century,
another Englishman, Mr. Halley, the Astronomer Royal, foretold that
the event would occur again in 1761 and in 1769, and he implored
the English astronomers of those dates not to neglect their
duty.<sup>**</sup> In 1760 the Royal Society, mindful of these
things, wrote to the Lords of the Treasury, urging that expeditions
should be sent to St. Helena, and to Bencoolen in Sumatra, to
observe an event that had been "predicted in the last century by an
Englishman, and never observed but once since the world began, and
then by another Englishman." Englishmen in 1760 were reading of new
victories by land and sea in each day's paper. Were they at the
same time to be defeated in the Heavens by some French
scientist!</p>

would cost six shillings a day, his liquors five shillings, and his
washing ninepence. His report was that his observations had been
spoilt by "very cloudy weather." The ship of the astronomers for
Bencoolen was attacked by a French frigate. They were so
discouraged, that they concluded that they could not get to
Bencoolen in time, and that it would be best to make the
Observations from the Cape.</p>
<p>The failures of 1761 made the Royal Society the more anxious to
make good arrangements for the observations of the Transit of the
3rd of June, 1769. In February 1768 they wrote to the King. They
praised his "remarkable love of science," and they explained to the
royal enthusiast the urgency of the occasion:" the like appearance
will not happen for more than a hundred years." Moreover, it was a
matter that would appeal to the feelings of a King who gloried in
the name of Briton. French, Danes, Swedes, and Russians were
planning to intrude their observations on a celestial phenomenon,
which the British nation had discovered and had annexed:&mdash;"the
British nation justly celebrated in the learned world for their
knowledge of astronomy, in which they are inferior to no nation in
the world, ancient or modern." British astronomers should be sent
to Spitzbergen or the North Cape, to Hudson's Bay, and to some
place in the South Seas, not exceeding 30&deg; S. Lat., and between
140&deg; and 180&deg; Long. W. The expense would be four thousand
pounds.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Welde, vol. ii. p. 33.]</p>
<p>This request was also granted. It remained to choose the
commanders and the observers. The Society had ready its list of men
well qualified to observe. Among them was Dalrymple, the British
apostle of the Southern Continent, who had printed his booklet in
the previous year. But Dalrymple would not go as observer, unless
he was also appointed commander, and the Admiralty replied that the
appointment, as commander, of a seaman who was not in the Royal
Navy would be "entirely repugnant to its regulations." It became
necessary, therefore, to look for an officer of the Royal Navy, who
was also a man of science. The two qualifications seldom went
together.<sup>*</sup> But it happened that there was a man, well
known both to the Admiralty and to the Royal Society, who combined
them in a very remarkable way:&mdash;James Cook, late "Master" of
<i>H.M.S. Northumberland</i>, now engaged in surveying the coasts
of Newfoundland, who had just written a learned paper, founded on
his own observation of the eclipse of the sun.</p>
<p class="note">[* The writer of Anson's <i>Voyage</i> complains
that naval officers regarded scientific study as "effeminate." It
is a mistake, he argues, to suppose that "the perfection of
sea-officers consists in a turn of mind and temper resembling the
boisterous element they have to deal with."</p>
<p>James Cook, like William Dampier, was a farmer's boy. In a time
when "property was power," he won the highest distinction, and even
earned, at the age of thirty-nine, so much as five shillings a day,
without the smallest help from birth, education, or influence.
These facts show that, in the navy of the late eighteenth century,
the career was not wholly closed to talent. But they show, far more
distinctly, how extraordinary was the talent which opened the
career.</p>
<p>As one might, perhaps, have inferred from his works, James Cook
was Yorkshire by birth and Scotch by ancestry. His grandfather was
a Kirk-elder, and the kirk-elder's son migrated to Yorkshire. "God
send you Grace," said his mother, and God sent him a wife of that
name. In a tiny two-roomed cottage in the tiny village of Marton,
James was born in October 1728. The Register of Baptism described
him as "James, the son of a day-labourer." Later, the day-labourer
rose to be a "hind" or bailiff; and, later still, he was a builder,
so well-lettered that he was able to carve his and his wife's
initials on a house he built in 1755. He died in 1778, ending life
as he began, for the Register of Deaths described him as a
"day-labourer."</p>
<p>As for son James, he went to school and learned reading,
writing, and arithmetic; I doubt that he ever got Dampier's power
in Latin. Local tradition afterwards told that, as a birds'-nester,
he had shown "a resolute adherence to his own plans"; which we
easily believe. Then he helped his father in farm work, was perhaps
a stable-boy for a short time, served customers in a grocer's shop
in a fishing village for eighteen months, and in 1746 became
"prentice" in a big coal-shipping business at Whitby. For nine
years he made voyages in coal-boats, getting loving acquaintance
with the type of ship which, he afterwards said, was by far the
best fitted for the business of exploration. His advance was rapid,
and in 1755 he was offered the position of "Master." He declined.
In that year the first shot was fired in the war that made Canada
and India parts of the Empire. Experienced seamen were scarce in
the Royal Navy. Cook saw the tide in his affairs, and volunteered,
"having a mind to try his fortune that way."</p>
<p>From 1755 to 1758, Cook served on ships which cruised the
Channel, and fought what fights they could get. Unhappily he told
no stories of his fights, and it is the exasperation of biographers
that others told no stories about him. Imagination has to make the
best of baldest statements, like this account of a
sea-fight:&mdash;"We killed her fifty men, and wounded her thirty;
she killed us ten men and wounded us eighty." Then, in 1758, Cook
sailed for Canada in the British fleet under "Wry-necked Dick"
Boscawen, and took his modest part in the famous deeds at Louisburg
and Quebec. Did Cook, during the endless monotony of voyage, ever
tell stories of Wolfe? Probably not. Cook was a very matter-of-fact
man. To him a brave deed was a brave deed; it was your duty to do
it, to describe it in plain prose words, and then to do another.
Doubtless Cook fought what fights came his way with courage and
ability, but of them we know nothing.</p>
<p>What we do know is that he now first gave proof of that
extraordinary skill in the charting of unknown coasts, which, says
Admiral Wharton, "enabled him to originate, as it may truly be said
he did, the art of modern marine surveying." How he acquired the
considerable knowledge of trigonometry, that was needed for this
work, is beyond the powers of explanation possessed by a person of
my degree of mathematical ignorance. His school education had been
elementary. In the winter evenings at Whitby, a kindly house-keeper
had "allowed him a table and a candle, that he might read and write
by himself, while the other apprentices were engaged in idle talk"
and, no doubt, he read and wrote with terrible industry. Yet, we
are told by our best authority,<sup>*</sup> that, when he began to
survey the St. Lawrence, he "had never been taught drawing, and was
not known to have ever used a pencil before." However we may
explain miracles, Cook won a solid and well-deserved reputation by
his surveys of "the Pilotage of the. St. Lawrence," and later of
the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, his charts of which,
writes Admiral Wharton, are "not yet wholly superseded," and "their
accuracy is truly astonishing." Meanwhile, he was diligently
studying mathematics and astronomy, "without other assistance than
what a few books and his own industry afforded him." In August 1766
he made observations of an eclipse of the sun, which, in April
1767, were communicated to the Royal Society, whose
<i>Transactions</i> described him as "a good mathematician, and
very expert in his business." In April 1768 a new surveyor was
appointed "in the absence of Mr. Cook who is to be employed
elsewhere." In May, a Council of the Royal Society was held, and
"Mr. Cook," says the record, "was called in."</p>
<p class="note">[* Young, p. 11.]</p>
<p>Mr. Cook was now a man of thirty-nine. His appearance may be
easily imagined from the description written, when all was over, by
one who had sailed in the last voyage. "His person was above six
feet high, and, though a good-looking man, he was plain both in
address and appearance. His head was small; his hair, which was
dark brown, he wore tied behind. His face was full of expression,
his nose exceedingly well-shaped, his eyes, which were small and of
a brown cast, were quick and piercing; his eyebrows prominent,
which gave his countenance altogether an air of austerity." These
things the Councillors saw. And probably they guessed something
good concerning the qualities of spirit and of mind in the man who
stood before then. "Nature," says the same witness in words which
our whole story will illustrate, "Nature had endowed him with a
mind vigorous and comprehensive, with a clear judgment, strong
masculine sense, and the most determined resolution; with a genius
peculiarly turned for enterprise, he pursued his object with
unshaken perseverance; vigilant and active in an eminent degree;
cool and intrepid among dangers; patient and firm among
difficulties and distress; fertile in expedients; great and
original in all his designs, active and resolved in carrying them
into execution...He was a modest man, and rather bashful; of an
agreeable lively conversation, sensible and intelligent. In his
temper he was somewhat hasty, but of a disposition the most
friendly, benevolent, and humane." In short, Cook's temper was
Scotch&mdash;"good but short."</p>
<p>The Council saw, heard, and guessed enough to cause them to
agree with the Admiralty's proposal. They offered Cook a gratuity
of one hundred guineas for taking the observation. He and his
fellow-observer, Mr. Green, were to have &pound;120 a year between them
for victuals. He was to be raised to the rank of First-Lieutenant,
and he was to have a wage of five shillings a day. Cook accepted
the offer, and accepted it with pride.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "His pride must have been great when he found he
was to receive a commission as Lieutenant" (Wharton, p. xxv).]</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Navy Board, acting probably with Cook's advice,
had bought "a cat-built bark in burden 368 tons, and of the age of
three years and nine months." A "cat- built bark"&mdash;the word
comes from Norwegian 'kati,' a ship&mdash;is a bark that has "round
bluff bows, a wide deep waist, and tapering towards the
stern."<sup>*</sup> It was the type of ship which Cook, writing
after the voyage was ended, described as by far the most useful for
a voyage of discovery. The danger was that the ship would run
aground on an unknown savage coast. She must therefore be able to
sail in shallow waters; she must bear to take the ground, and to be
safely laid on shore for repairs; and yet, on the other hand, she
must be big enough to carry great quantities of provisions. These
qualities, says Cook, are only to be found in "North Country built
ships, or such as are built for the Coal-trade." A ship of this
sort had been chosen. She had been built in Whitby, and was like
the ships which Cook had sailed for many years in the coal trade.
Her name was "the Earl of Pembroke," but she was now re-named "the
Endeavour Bark." Her price was &pound;2,800, and &pound;2,294 was spent on
sheathing and fitting her for the voyage.</p>
<p class="note">[* Kitson, p. 88.]</p>
<p>With Cook sailed a young gentleman, whose voyage was destined to
be of great consequence. Mr. Joseph Banks of Revesby was
representative of a wealthy Lincolnshire family. Father and
grandfather had been men of special culture, keenly interested in
local history and antiquities. Born in 1743, Banks went to school
at Harrow, and later at Eton. An old schoolfellow, who became the
father of Lord Brougham, afterwards described him as "a remarkably
fine-looking strong and active boy, whom no fatigue could subdue,
and no peril daunt; and his whole time out of school was given up
to hunting after plants and insects." Banks himself told how,
strolling one day down a lane, he exclaimed, "How beautiful! Would
it not be far more reasonable to make me learn the nature of those
plants than the Greek and Latin I am confined to!"<sup>*</sup> At
Oxford he continued his botanical studies. The fame of the
Professor of the subject rests secure on the fact that, "during his
thirty-six years' occupancy of the Chair, he is said to have
delivered only one lecture, and that not a successful
one."<sup>*</sup> Why he gave one lecture I do not know. Banks
searched Cambridge, found a botanist, and brought him to
Oxford.</p>
<p class="note">[* "My father," writes Brougham, "always said that
his friend Joe cared mighty little for his book, and could not
understand any one taking to Greek and Latin."]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Dict. of Nat. Biog</i>. "In the University
of Oxford," wrote Adam Smith, late scholar of Balliol, "the greater
part of the public professors have for these many years given up
altogether even, the pretence of teaching." Cf. Gibbon's
illustrations of "the silence of the Oxford professors" in his
<i>Autobiography</i>, pp. 32-43.]</p>
<p>Leaving Oxford in 1763, he lived on the great estate at Revesby,
studied natural history, and angled days and nights. His neighbour,
Lord Sandwich, also liked fishing, and a friendship grew that
perhaps had consequences, for Lord Sandwich was a member of the
Government when the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed. The two enthusiasts
formed a plan, which failed, for suddenly draining the Serpentine
in the hope that this would "throw much light on the state and
habits of the fish," Meanwhile Banks was forming friendships in
London among more serious students of science. In 1766 he was
elected member of the Royal Society. In the same year he voyaged to
Newfoundland, and made careful study of people, birds, fish, and
plants. Then came tours in England, examination of barrows and
ancient monuments, and everlasting "botanising."</p>

<b>58. JOSEPH BANKS<br>
(From an engraving of the portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
P.R.A.)</b></p>
<p>Then came the chance of a voyage in the South Seas. Friends
advised him to prefer the usual "grand tour" of Europe. "Every
blockhead," he replied, "does that! My grand tour should be one
round the world." He never found reason to regret his choice.
Nearly half a century later, he wrote a letter to a young scientist
whose friends were seeking to dissuade him from a voyage to Java,
on the ground that the climate was unhealthy. "They seek," wrote
he, "to force you to adopt the advice of Sardanapalus, to eat,
drink, and propagate;&mdash;a serene, quiet, calm, sober way of
slumbering away life!...I was about twenty-three when I began my
peregrinations...you may be assured that if I had listened to a
multitude of voices, that were raised to dissuade me from my
enterprise, I should have been now a quiet country gentleman, quite
ignorant of a number of matters I am now acquainted with, and
probably have attained to no higher rank in life than that of
country Justice of the Peace."<sup>*</sup> So wrote, with just
self-esteem, the friend of the King, the adviser of statesmen, the
President of the Royal Society, and the Father of New South
Wales!</p>
<p class="note">[* Smith, p. 297.]</p>
<p>It is pleasant to think of him as he started on his "grand tour"
of the world, radiant in youth, health, and strength, brimming with
joy of life, eager to see, to know, and to achieve. His wealth
enabled him to do things in the grand style. His "suite" included
Dr. Solander, the friend and pupil of Linnaeus, and also three
artists, an assistant draughtsman, and four servants, two of whom
were negroes;&mdash;a very different affair from poor Dampier's
voyages. "No people," wrote Mr. John Ellis, F.R.S., to Linnaeus,
who showed the keenest interest in the voyage, "no people ever went
to sea better fitted out for the purpose of Natural History, nor
more elegantly." And he gave a list of scientific apparatus that
makes one realize how far Science had travelled since the days of
Dampier. "In short," he concludes, "Solander assured me the
expedition would cost Mr. Banks &pound;10,000."</p>
<p>Unhappily, Cook's "Instructions" have disappeared. We learn
their nature from a short description in his Journal, and from what
he did. "I was ordered," he writes, "to proceed directly to
Otaheite"&mdash;the gorgeous island which Wallis had discovered and
annexed,&mdash;"and, after the astronomical observations should be
completed, to prosecute the design of making discoveries in the
South Pacific Ocean by proceeding to the South as far as the
Latitude 40&deg;; then, if I found no land, to proceed to the West,
between 40&deg; and 35&deg;, till I fell in with New Zealand, which I was
to explore, and then to return to England by such route as I should
think proper." That is to say, Cook was to explore the South
Pacific, with a view especially to testing the theory of the
geographers that the space between America and New Zealand was
mainly occupied by a gigantic continent. It should be carefully
observed that Cook and Banks were continually referring to the
volumes of de Brosses and the booklet of Dalrymple. Dalrymple, as
we have noticed, had hoped that he would himself command the ship,
and would make the last great discovery&mdash;the discovery of a
Southern Continent as big as Asia! He had been treated, so he
believed, with cruel injustice. But this should not prevent him
from placing at the disposal of the supplanter the precious
information which he alone possessed. "In spite of the injury done
me," he afterwards wrote, "I gave Mr. Joseph Banks all the
information I could, and accordingly he carried with him the Octavo
"Account of the Discoveries made in the South Pacific Ocean," with
the Chart, which I printed several months before, though I did not
<i>publish</i> it till after Bougainville's return."<sup>*</sup>
One main purpose of the voyage was to see whether Dalrymple's
Southern Continent existed.</p>
<p class="note">[* Dalrymple's Letter to Dr. Hawkesworth.]</p>
<p>They sailed on the 26th of August, 1768, "all in excellent
health and spirits," says Banks, "perfectly prepared (in mind at
least) to undergo with cheerfulness any fatigues or dangers that
may occur." On the 10th of September they "dined in Africa, and
took leave of Europe for Heaven knows how long, perhaps for ever";
and the memory of friends made Banks sigh once, but not twice! Five
precious days he botanised in Madeira. One of them had to be
sacrificed to the "unsought honour of an official visit from the
Governor"; but Banks revenged himself on his Excellency by sending
ashore an electrical machine which "shocked him fully as much as he
chose." At the Equator, all who had not crossed before must be
ducked, from Cook and Banks to dogs and cats, or must buy off in
brandy. At Rio there was trouble, for the Governor declared that
Cook was the usual English pirate, and locked up his sailors in
loathsome dungeon on the ground that they were smuggling. Cook's
suspicion was that they were "smuggling" the clothes off their own
backs for rum. His Scotch temper rose, and he and the Governor
bombarded one another with "memorials." On Christmas Day they were
at sea, and, says Banks, "all good Christians, i.e. all good hands
got abominably drunk, so that all through the night there was
scarce a sober man in the ship. Weather, thank God, moderate, or
the Lord knows what would have become of us." They took the route
round Cape Horn, and, on the East coast of Tierra del Fuego, Banks
led a botanical expedition to some distant hills. They were
surprised by a snow-blizzard, and had to camp for the night. Two
seamen and a negro got the rum-bottle; the negro and one seaman
died; and the other seaman was unable to walk. Buchan the artist
fell in a fit, and fat unhappy Solander lay down on the snow, and
said he must sleep. But the weather cleared next day; the survivors
reached the ship; and the botanists were soon supremely happy,
collecting shells and plants.</p>
<p>They sailed from Tierra del Fuego on the 21st of January, 1769.
Their task now was to look for the continent which, according to
Dalrymple, ran "but a very little West of the common track towards
Juan Fernandez." Cook and Banks were unbelievers, and their
unbelief grew. On the 1st of March they were in Latitude 38&frac12; and
five hundred and sixty leagues West of Chili. They were, in fact,
sailing through the thick of Dalrymple's continent! Yet Cook noted
that there were not even any currents:&mdash;"a great sign that we
have been near no land of any extent, because near land are
generally found currents." Banks's unbelief was outspoken and
contemptuous. "It is some pleasure," he wrote on the 20th of March,
"to disprove that which only exists in the opinions of theoretical
writers...They have generally supposed that every foot of sea over
which they believed no ship to have passed to be land, although
they have little or nothing to support that opinion except vague
reports, many of them mentioned only as such by those authors who
first published them." He points to the flimsy character of the
historical evidence. And he even writes with disrespect of the
argument of physical necessity. "Till we know how this globe is
fixed in that place, which has been since its creation assigned to
it in the general system, we need not be anxious to give reasons
how any one part of it counterbalances the rest."</p>
<p>On the 13th of April, 1769, they came to anchor at the island
where they were to observe the transit on the 3rd of June. Wallis
had discovered it, and had called it King George III.'s Island.
Bougainville had called it Cythera, but had understood the natives
to say that they called it Taiti. Cook understood them to say
Otaheite. The modern geographer spells it Tahiti. The observation
was made with complete success on a "day perfectly clear without so
much as a cloud intervening"; the only trouble was that the sailors
took advantage of the observers' absence to purloin a great part of
the nails for sinful traffic with native women.</p>
<p>But astronomy fills few of the glowing pages in which Banks
paints Otaheite. Like Bougainville he loves the island, and all
things in it; and tremendous boyish enjoyment combines with keenest
scientific curiosity to give fascination to the nightly jottings in
his journal, written so hastily that he feared he would scarcely
understand his own language when he read it again! The island was
"an Arcadia of which we were going to be Kings." It was not only
the "very pretty girl with a fire in her eyes." The men were only
less delightful than the women. Banks gave them classical
nick-names:&mdash;Lycurgus, Hercules, and Epicurus, who "ate most
monstrously." <i>They</i> in return pronounced English as they
pleased. Cook became "Toote," Solander "Torana," Banks "Tapane";
and they drank the health of King George under the name of
"Kilnargo." With their new friends the English kept perpetual
holiday. Even their one fault added to gaiety. They were thieves,
but they were thieves of a genius that turned thieving into
miracle. If ever a man slept with one eye open, that man was Cook;
yet they stole his stockings, he says, "from under my head, and yet
I am certain I was not asleep the whole time." Banks was chief
thief-catcher; and very seriously and very happily he played the
game;&mdash;"away we set at full cry, much like a pack of
foxhounds; we ran and walked and walked and ran for, I believe, six
miles";&mdash;to find that, very early in the chase, the criminal
had turned aside to take a quiet bath in a brook.</p>
<p>But Banks was a man of science as well as a man of pleasure. His
special interest was Botany. But nothing done by men, animals,
fishes, or plants was alien to his mind. With infinite vigour and
with infinite happiness he studied Nature in all its forms. In
company with Monkhouse&mdash;fat Solander this time wisely left
behind&mdash;he had a long day's walk inland, past the hill slopes
planted with bread-fruit trees, past the last of the houses, whose
owners refreshed them with cocoanuts, up among steep rocks and
cascades, where long strips of bark served as ropes by which to
scramble from ledge to ledge, though, even on the ledges, none but
goats or Indians could stand. For minerals Banks looked in vain.
But he observed that "the stones everywhere showed manifest signs
of having been at some time or other burnt." His conjecture was
that the island owed its origin to a volcano now extinct. And, for
the comfort of the "theoretic writers," whose theories Cook had
already in part demolished, Banks suggests that their "necessary
continent may have been sunk by dreadful earthquakes and volcanoes
two or three thousand fathoms under the sea, the tops of the
mountains only remaining above the water in the shape of
islands."</p>
<p>As a sociologist, his methods of study were equally thorough.
The only way to get understanding of native customs was "to act a
character," and he was very willing. "I was prepared by stripping
off my European clothes, and putting on a small strip of cloth
round my waist, the only garment I was allowed to have. They then
began to smut me and themselves with charcoal and water, the Indian
boy was completely black, the women and myself as low as our
shoulders; we then set out." He gives a lively account of the
ceremony, and of "the surprise of our friends" at the Fort. The end
was "we went into the river, and scrubbed one another until it was
dark before the blacking came off." Better fun and better science
than the blockhead's "grand tour" in weary old Europe!</p>
<p>Both Cook and Banks wrote elaborate descriptions that show how
modern science had at last come to vigorous being. It may be
doubted that, even now, more intelligent and accurate accounts of
primitive society are often written than those recorded by the
radiant young aristocrat, and the son of the Yorkshire labourer.
Cook's formal businesslike style naturally lacks the vivacity that
gives special charm to the joyful writings of Banks. But one is
amazed&mdash;when one thinks of early days in farm and stable,
behind grocer's counter, and in collier-ship&mdash;to notice the
breadth and strength of mind, the appreciation of the points of
special scientific interest, the exactness of observation, and the
careful detail of style. Nor are touches lacking that reveal the
man. The decay of the great "Marai" or Temple shows, he says, that
"this island hath been in a more flourishing state than it is at
present, and that religious customs are (like most other nations)
by these people less observed...The mysteries of religion are very
dark, and not easily understood even by those who profess them." We
have travelled far from the days of Quiros. We are in the days of
Benjamin Franklin, and Cook has come to sweep the cobwebs of the
South Sea with the dust-broom of victorious common sense.</p>
<p>On the 13th of July, 1769, they sailed from Otaheite. With them
sailed a native named Tupia, "a most proper man, well-born, chief
Tahowa or priest of this island." Banks had added him to his
"suite." "Thank Heaven," he says, "I have a sufficiency, and I do
not know why I may not keep him as a curiosity as my neighbours do
lions and tigers." The pious priest often prayed for a wind, and
boasted of the success of his prayers, which, adds Banks, he "never
began till he perceived a breeze so near the ship that it generally
reached him before his prayer was finished." Under the guidance of
Tupia and his winds, Cook visited the neighbouring islands, and
named the group "the Society Isles," because "they lay contiguous
to one another." Then, on the 9th of August, 1769, they "launched
out into the Ocean in search of what chance or Tupia might direct
us to."</p>
<p>Cook's "Instructions" were that from this point he should
prosecute the design of making discoveries in the South Pacific
Ocean by proceeding to the South as far as the Latitude 40&deg;. Then,
if he found no land, he was to proceed to the West between 40&deg; and
35&deg; till he fell in with New Zealand, which he was to explore. His
business was to test the confident statement of the geographers,
and especially of Dalrymple, that the unknown South must be nearly
all land, that in Latitude 40&deg; a continent stretched from the coast
said to have been seen on the East by Juan Fernandez to the coast
that had been seen on the West by Tasman, a continent as rich as
Peru, and as large as the whole of Asia from Turkey to China. Cook
had already sailed in deep water over much of the Eastern part of
this "theoretic" continent. He had now to explore its Northern
coast, and then the Western.</p>
<p>The geographers represented its Northern coast by a line drawn
in the neighbourhood of Tahiti, with the inscription "Lands and
islands seen by Quiros." Bougainville had looked for this coastline
in vain, and had been puzzled to know on what authority the
geographers had drawn it. Cook made a much more thorough search. He
sailed Southward to 40&deg; 22', a point at which, according to
Dalrymple, he should have been in the middle of a con tinent as big
as, Asia. Cook could see "not the least visible signs of land," and
the most that Banks could see were some seaweed and a seal, which
he thought might signify something. Cook had intended to sail even
further Southward, but the weather grew so tempestuous that he
thought it wise to abandon the plan, and to sail Northward into
better climate. He admits that his search for "the land seen by
Quiros" was not exhaustive. It might conceivably exist in the angle
to the South-East of Tahiti that was still unexplored. But Cook
knew of no better argument for its existence there than the fact
that it did not exist elsewhere. He agreed with Bougainville's
criticism of the historical evidence on which the geographers had
built their huge structure. Dalrymple said that Quiros saw to the
Southward very large hanging clouds, and a very thick horizon, with
other known signs of a continent. "Other accounts of their voyage,"
writes Cook, "say not a word about this; but, supposing this to be
true, hanging clouds and a thick horizon are certainly no sign of a
continent...I have had many proofs to the contrary in the course of
this voyage."</p>
<p>It remained to explore New Zealand,<sup>*</sup> with a view
especially to testing the theory that had been suggested by Tasman,
and was believed by Dalrymple and "most thoughtful people" (says
Banks), that it was the Western coast of the Unknown Continent.
They had in their library "a short extract of Tasman's Journal,"
and they heartily wished that they had the whole Journal. They knew
that Tasman had raised three questions, which still remained
unsolved. Firstly, he had called the land which he had discovered
Staten Land, believing that it was continuous with the Staten Land
which Le Maire had seen Eastward of Tierra del Fuego. Long ago it
had been proved that Le Maire's Staten Land was a small island. But
it still remained possible that Tasman's Staten Land was part of a
continent. Secondly, cruising in the neighbourhood of "Murderers'
Bay," he had noticed currents which had caused him to think it
likely that there existed a passage. Thirdly, "when he came the
length of Cape Maria van Diemen, he observed hollow waves to come
from the North-East, from whence he concluded it to be the
northernmost part of the land." Cook was to test Tasman's three
guesses. He found that the first was wrong, and that the second and
the third&mdash;which had been much distrusted, we remember, by
Tasman's employers&mdash;were quite right, and very much to the
credit of his seamanship.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cook, p. 214, wrongly says that the name <i>New
Zealand</i> was given by Tasman. The name given by Tasman was
Staten Land. It was changed to <i>Nova Zeelandia</i>, however,
before 1657. See p. 278, note.]</p>
<p>On the 7th of October land was seen.<sup>*</sup> Cook named the
point Young Nick's Head, after the boy who first saw it. He sailed
into a Bay which he named Poverty Bay, "because it afforded us no
one thing we wanted."<sup>**</sup> Natives appeared in canoes, and
Cook, wishing to capture them and gain their friendship, fired over
their heads. He expected them, it seems, to jump overboard and
surrender. It was a primitive method of seeking friendship, but
might possibly have succeeded in Tahiti. Instead of surrendering,
the Maoris took their arms, and attacked with such ferocity that
the Englishmen had to kill two or three to save their own lives.
Cook admits that he had made a bad mistake; but one cannot consent,
he adds, to be knocked on the head. Then he sailed South, past the
Great Bay which he called Hawke Bay after the First Lord of the
Admiralty. He followed the coast to Latitude 40&deg; 34'; and then,
"seeing no likelihood of meeting with a harbour, and the face of
the country visibly altering for the worse," he decided that his
time would be better spent by examining the coast to the Northward.
He gave Cape Turnagain its name "because here we returned." Sailing
North, he rounded East Cape, visited "the Bay of Plenty," observed
the transit of Mercury in Mercury Bay, explored "a very fine river"
which he named the Thames, because it was "as broad as the Thames
at Greenwich," anchored in the Bay of Islands, and, rounding Cape
Maria van Diemen and the Three Kings, proved that Tasman had been
right when he had claimed the discovery of a sea-way to Chili. Off
the Three Kings the sailors celebrated their second Christmas "in
the old-fashioned way," ate goose-pie, and "in the evening all
hands were as drunk as our forefathers used to be upon like
occasions." Then Cook sailed down the West coast, charting its
features with "a mingled audacity and caution "that are greatly
admired by the modern hydrographer. He passed the islands which
screen Auckland with the remark that they probably "formed some
good harbours." He noted the noblest hill he had ever seen, and
named it Mount Egmont. Then he came to a "very broad and deep Bay
or Inlet, the Southern side of which seemed to form several Bays."
Into one of these Bays he determined to go, in order to careen the
ship and to obtain refreshment. He sailed up an inlet which he
named Queen Charlotte Sound, and anchored in "a very snug cove,"
which he named Ship Cove. He calculated that Tasman's Murderers'
Bay was fifteen miles away; in reality it was seventy miles away.
The natives heaved a few stones, but became friendly after
conversation with Tupia. They had no tradition of Tasman's visit;
and, in fact, the tribe which had murdered the Dutchmen in 1642 had
itself been murdered long before 1770.</p>
<p class="note">[* See <a href="#il-69">Illustration 69</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** He first wrote "Endeavour Bay," then struck out
that name, and wrote "Poverty Bay" ( See <a href=
"#ch-22">Authorities</a> for this chapter), a singularly
inappropriate name, say New Zealanders (M'Nab's <i>Historical
Records of New Zealand</i>, vol. ii. p. 5).]</p>
<p>The business now was to determine whether Tasman had been right
when he had inferred from the currents that the great Bay was in
reality the entrance to a passage. Cook made the same inference and
proved that it was right. While Banks and Solander were botanising,
he "climbed to the top of a hill, and in about an hour returned in
high spirits, having seen the Eastern Sea and satisfied himself of
the existence of a strait communicating with it." An old native
further told him that the land South of the passage was not a
continent, but consisted of two islands that might be
circumnavigated in a few days. On the 7th of February, 1770, he
sailed through "our new straits"&mdash;which, says Banks, "are to
be called Cook's Straits"&mdash;feeling "the force of the tide
which roared like a millstream, and ran at four knots at least when
it flowed fastest." Some of the officers still thought it possible
that the land they had now three-quarters circumnavigated might
nevertheless be united to a continent by an isthmus somewhere
between Cook's Straits and Cape Turnagain. To determine this
question in a final way, Cook sailed North till Cape Turnagain was
seen from the South. "I then," says Cook, "called the officers upon
the deck, and asked them if they were now satisfied that this land
was an island, to which they answered in the affirmative, and we
hauled our wind to the Eastward."</p>
<p>It remained to be seen whether the land to the South was also,
as the old man had told them, no part of a continent but two
islands that might be circumnavigated in a few days. They sailed
Southward, and Banks, who, in spite of sceptical tendencies, was an
enthusiastic "continent-monger," noted with regret that "the land
inclined a good deal to the West." "We on board," he writes, "were
of two parties, one who wished that the land in sight might, the
other that it might not, be a continent. I myself have always been
most firm in the former wish, though sorry I am that my party is so
small, that I firmly believe that there are none more heartily
desirous of it than myself and one poor midshipman; the rest begin
to sigh for roast beef"; an accusation marvellously unjust to Cook,
to whom discovery was meat and drink, and who would have preferred
a continent, and indeed something very much smaller, to all the
roast beef of Old England.</p>
<p>By the 10th of March, it had become evident, "much to the regret
of us continent-mongers," that the coast was falling away to an
end. They supposed Stewart Island to be a peninsula, and were
carried round the point, "to the total destruction of our aerial
fabric called Continent." They coasted Northward, noting "steep
hills covered with prodigious fine woods," a beautiful and fertile
country, yet without the smallest sign of inhabitants. On the 25th
of March, they were once more in the Western entrance of Cook's
Straits, and two days later anchored in a Bay which was called
Admiralty Bay. Cook noticed another Bay to his Westward which he
did not explore. He called it Blind Bay, and believed that it was
Tasman's Murderers' Bay. And he was nearly right. Murderers' Bay is
a small Bay in the North-West of Cook's Blind Bay.</p>
<p>The search for Dalrymple's continent had come to an end. Cook
had sailed over it East, North, and West. He had met with no land,
and "no visible signs of land." He had seen flocks of birds and
plenty of seaweed. But the birds were of the sort that fly far. And
who knows how far seaweed may drive to sea? Beans, that grow
nowhere save in the West Indies, are yearly thrown on the coasts of
Ireland and Scotland, twelve thousand leagues away. Had such things
been found floating in the South Sea, geographers would have
concluded that land was hardly out of sight, "so apt are we to
catch at everything that may point out to us the favourite object
we are in pursuit of." Cook believed he had proved that "there is
left but a small space to the Northward of 40&deg; where the grand
object can lay," i.e. the triangle to the South-East of the Society
Islands. South of 40&deg;, however, there remained plenty of space
still unexplored, and Cook was very eager to explore it. "To return
by the way of Cape Horn was what I most wished, because by this
route we should have been able to prove the existence or
non-existence of a Southern continent, which yet remains doubtful;
but, in order to ascertain this, we must have kept in a higher
Latitude, in the very depth of winter, but the condition of the
ship was not thought sufficient for such an undertaking." He
suggests that one more voyage might now suffice to clear up "this
thing which has been the object of many ages and nations." The best
plan would be that the ship should call at the Cape, thence proceed
to Queen Charlotte Sound, leave that place by the end of September,
"when you will have all the summer before you," and run to the
Eastward in as high a latitude as you please, and then either
return home by Cape Horn, or haul to the Northward, visit the lands
already known, or seek to rediscover those named in the old
voyages. "Thus the discoveries in the South Sea would be complete."
Cook had sketched the outline of his second voyage.</p>
<p>Banks, in more free and easy style, reached the same conclusion.
The <i>Endeavour</i> had, he claimed, sailed over three-quarters of
the continent of "the theoretical continent-makers." "As for the
reason about the balancing of the two poles, which always seemed to
me a most childish argument, we have already shorn off so much of
the supposed counter-balance in land, that, by their own account,
the South Pole would already be too light, unless what we have left
should be made of very ponderous materials." Had the despised
"continent-makers" read the records of recent Antarctic
exploration, they would have been able to make, if not a good, at
least a plausible reply to Banks's taunt. "A gigantic tableland, as
extensive as Europe and Australia put together, and with an
<i>average</i> height of 6,000 feet, is surely," they might have
urged, "a pretty ponderous makeweight. Our only mistake was that we
built our continent too flat, and therefore too extensive.
Exploration has proved, as we always said it would, the soundness
of our theory that there <i>must</i> be a <i>weighty</i> continent
in the South." Thus the continent-makers might plausibly have
argued; and yet, it seems, their argument would have been
ill-based. A continent, and even a mountainous continent, say our
modern geologists, is <i>not</i> a particularly weighty affair. The
Himalayas rise to heaven, not because they are heavy but because
they are light&mdash;mere handfuls of dust when compared with the
metal stuffs which drag down the ocean-bed. There is due weight in
the South, but it lies under water.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* These statements are based on information kindly
given me by my friends, Professor T. W. E. David and Professor L.
A. Cotton. See note, <a href="#cotton">earlier</a>, in Chapter
VI.</p>
<p>Banks, however, was still "continent-monger" enough to believe
firmly in the existence of a Southern continent, though much
smaller than that imagined by the theorists. There was the ice
South of Cape Horn, and ice means fresh water, and fresh water
means land. And he had seen seaweed and a seal South of Tahiti. He
confesses that his "reasons were weak," and no doubt Cook told him
so. But he eagerly agreed with Cook that another voyage was well
worth while. As "a voyage of mere curiosity," it should be promoted
by the Royal Society, helped by His Majesty.</p>
<p>"Cook," writes Mr. Reeves, "found New Zealand a line on the map,
and he left it an archipelago." He had proved that it was not part
of a golden continent; but he had proved also that it consisted of
two large islands, fertile, beautiful, fascinating, in all ways fit
to be a home of Englishmen. As one reads the journals, one becomes
aware that the writers are not merely men of science eager to know;
they are also British patriots, thinking of colonization. Banks
notes that the coast abounds in good harbours. "The Bay of Islands
and Queen Charlotte Sound are as good as any which seamen need
desire to come into." The soil is generally good. "The outer ridge
of land which is open to the sea is (as I believe is the case in
most countries) generally barren, especially to the Southward, but,
within that, the hills are covered with thick woods quite to the
top, and every valley produces a rivulet of water." The South and
West sides seemed the most barren, but on the North and the East
were seen very large tracts of land which "promised great returns
to the people who would take the trouble of cultivating them." From
the botanist's point of view the vegetation seemed monotonous; but
"the entire novelty of the greater part of what we found
recompensed us as natural historians for the want of variety." The
richness of the soil was shown by gigantic trees, the straightest,
cleanest, and largest Banks had ever seen. The timber appeared "fit
for any kind of buildings, and thick enough to make masts for
vessels of any size." Banks also has high praise for "the plant
which serves them instead of hemp or flax," and believes that it
would be "a great acquisition to England."</p>
<p>In fact, New Zealand is an excellent place for a British colony.
"It was the opinion of everyone on board," writes Cook, "that all
sorts of European grain, fruit, plants, etc., would thrive here; in
short, was this country settled by an industrious people, they
would very soon be supplied not only with necessaries, but many of
the luxuries of life...Should it ever become an object of settling
this country, the best place for the first fixing of a colony would
be either in the River Thames or the Bay of Islands." Both these
places have good harbours. In the River Thames ships might be built
and settlements might easily extend inland. Banks also votes for
the River Thames, as "in every respect the most proper place we
have yet seen for establishing a colony." Both journalists believe
that a colony might subsist in spite of the warlike character of
the natives. "So far," writes Cook, "as I have been able to judge
of the genius of these people, it does not appear to me at all
difficult for strangers to form a settlement in this country; they
seem to be too much divided amongst themselves to unite in
opposition; by which means, and kind and gentle usage, the
colonists would be able to form strong parties among them." And he
writes an admirable account of the noble barbarian, stout,
clean-limbed, active, cruel, ferocious, given to unpleasing customs
like cannibalism, yet living by a standard of moral excellence,
capable of patriotic discipline, possessing high intelligence and
artistic skill, and showing characteristics that promised capacity
for living peaceably with a civilized race, and gradually accepting
its civilization.</p>
<p>Reading these accounts of New Zealand, our wonder is that its
colonization was so long delayed.</p>
<hr class="longer">
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII. THE DISCOVERY OF
EASTERN AUSTRALIA</h2>
<p>Cook had first seen New Zealand on the 7th of October, 1769. He
sailed from Cape Farewell on the 1st of April, 1770, having spent
nearly six months in a most profitable way. His "Instructions"
ordered that, after exploration of New Zealand, he should return to
England by such route as he should think proper. He wished to
return by way of Cape Horn in order to settle the business of the
Southern Continent. "But," writes Banks, "our sails and rigging,
with which, the former especially, we were at first but
ill-provided, were rendered so bad by the blowing weather we had
met with off New Zealand, that we were by no means in condition to
weather the hard gales which must be expected in a winter passage
through high latitudes." The suggestion that they should sail
directly to the Cape of Good Hope was laid aside on the ground that
no discovery of any moment could be hoped for on that route. They
had still six months' provisions at two-thirds allowance, much more
than enough to carry them to any port in the East Indies, and on
this route there was hope of discoveries of great importance both
to geographer and to merchant. "It was therefore resolved upon
leaving this coast to steer to the Westward until we fall in with
the East coast of New Holland, and then to follow the direction of
that coast to the Northward, and what other direction it might take
us, until we arrive at its Northern extremity; and, if this should
be found impracticable, then to endeavour to fall in with the land
or islands discovered by Quiros."</p>
<p>What was Cook's conception of New Holland as he, first of
Europeans, sailed towards its Eastern coast? All the
maps&mdash;founded mainly on Tasman's&mdash;showed a continuous
coastline on the North, on the West, and on the South as far as the
islands of St. Peter and St. Francis. The huge vacancy Eastward of
those islands and of Cape York was broken only by Quiros's Espiritu
Santo, and Tasman's Van Diemen's Land. To the North was New Guinea,
known Eastward only as far as New Britain on the one side and Cape
York on the other. What were the relations of these coasts to one
another? There were two ways of thinking, one "dry" and the other
"wet." These various lands were either one continent, or they were
an archipelago of islands. "It is most evident," Campbell,
representing the dry school, had written in 1744, "that New Guinea,
Carpentaria, New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, and the countries
discovered by Quiros make all one continent." "In this immense
stretch of land," de Brosses, representative of the wet school, had
written in 1756, "we are acquainted only with some parts of the
coast lying separated from each other, without being able to affirm
whether they compose one continent or (as is more likely) they are
large islands, separated from each other by canals or arms of the
sea, the narrowest of which have been supposed by navigators to be
the mouths of rivers...Neither are we yet assured if New Holland
joins New Guinea on the North, or Van Diemen's Land on the
South...In running along the Eastern coast of the country towards
the Equator, we find the Austral land of the Holy Ghost, discovered
by Quiros. But all this vast interval lying between Leeuwin and
Quiros's discovery is so little known that we cannot tell what part
of it is land, and what part is sea." De Brosses is an agnostic; he
does not know; but he inclines to the wet theory rather than to the
dry theory. But, as Cook points out, the maps which were published
in de Brosses' volumes are not agnostic at all; they are dogmatic,
and dogmatic in a curiously irrational way. Van Diemen's Land and
the Austral Land of the Holy Ghost are drawn as parts of New
Holland. On the other hand New Holland and New Guinea are drawn as
separate lands with a well-defined strait between them, though de
Brosses had said in his text, "we are not yet well assured if New
Holland joins New Guinea"! On this point Dalrymple's chart gave the
strongest support to the view expressed in de Brosses' map. And
Dalrymple's view, as we have seen, was based on the knowledge that
Torres had actually sailed through a strait between New Holland and
New Guinea; and he had marked Torres' track on the chart included
in his booklet, an advance copy of which he had given to Banks. He
had not, however, printed his evidence for the opinion that Torres
had sailed on this route, viz. the Memorial of Arias; though he had
apparently explained his knowledge of the matter to Banks.</p>
<p>Thus there must have been three geographical questions in Cook's
mind as he sailed West: (i) Was New Holland one land with Van
Diemen's Land? (2) Was it one land with Espiritu Santo? (3) Was it
one land with New Guinea? On the first question, Cook had, for the
present, no material for even forming a guess. On the second
question, he agreed with Dalrymple's view that New Holland and
Espiritu Santo were not connected; he did not know that
Bougainville had just <i>proved</i> this fact. As to the third
question, Cook had always understood that New Holland and New
Guinea were one land; but he seems to have been impressed by the
map of de Brosses (in spite of the contradiction of de Brosses'
text), and still more by the map of Dalrymple, as explained by
Banks. He expected to find a passage between New Holland and New
Guinea; but he considered that the evidence on the subject was so
conflicting and so ancient that it would remain a "doubtful point
with geographers" till the passage was sailed.</p>
<p>Cook's aim was to "fall in with Van Diemen's Land as near as
possible at the place where Tasman left it." In this way he would
be able to prove that Van Diemen's Land was, or was not, one land
with New Holland. Unluckily, he got a little too far to the North.
Banks suspected that the ship was drawn that way by the distant
scent of roast beef. "The compass," he says, "showed that the
hearts of our people hanging that way caused a considerable
Northern variation, which was sensibly felt by our navigators, who
called it a current, as they do everything which makes their
reckonings and observations disagree." But Banks's suspicions were
again ill-founded. Cook's Journal shows that he was aiming at the
point of Tasman's departure, and with good chance of hitting it. On
the 18th of April, he was on a course which, says Wharton, "would
have made the Northern end of the Foveaux Group, and probably have
discovered Bass's Strait." But on that day Cook records, "Winds
Southerly, a hard gale with heavy squalls attended with showers of
rain, and a great sea from the same quarter." Before the Southerly
gale he ran, with the result that Bass's Strait remained
undiscovered till 1798. At 6 a.m. on the 20th of April Lieutenant
Hicks saw land, "sloping hills covered in part with trees and
bushes, but interspersed with large tracts of sand." Cook named the
land Point Hicks.<sup>*</sup> They could see no land to the South.
Van Diemen's Land ought to be there, and "the soon falling of the
sea after the wind abated" seemed to prove that it was there. But
the coast "trended South-West, or rather more to the Westward," and
this made Cook "doubtful whether they are one land or no. However,"
he adds, "every one who compares this journal with that of Tasman's
will be as good judge as I am."</p>
<p class="note">[* It seems that Point Hicks is the Cape which
Stokes in 1843 unfortunately named Cape Everard. See elaborate
discussion of Cook's landfall in a paper by Scott in the
<i>Victorian Historical Magazine</i>, December 1912.</p>
<p>From Point Hicks Cook sailed North looking for a harbour. On the
22nd of April, he noted Bateman's Bay as a place "very little
sheltered, and yet the only likely anchoring place I have yet seen
on the coast." Next day he vainly sought an anchorage in the
neighbourhood of "the Pigeon House." On the 26th he noted that
Jervis Bay appeared to be sheltered from the North-East wind; but
the appearance was not favourable enough to induce him to "lose
time in beating up to it." On the same day Banks compared the
country to "the back of a lean cow, covered in general with long
hairs, but, nevertheless, where her scraggy hip bones have stuck
out further than they ought, accidental rubs and knocks have
entirely bared them of their share of covering." On the 28th they
tried to land in the yawl at some place near
Wollongong,<sup>*</sup> but they were prevented by "the great surf
which beat everywhere upon the shore." Banks had to be content to
"gaze upon the products of nature" in one of the most lovely and
fertile regions in Australia.</p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. <i>Historical Records of N.S.W.</i>, vol. i.
part i. p. 214. Pickersgill writes: "The shore appeared very
pleasant, with tall trees, having little or no underwood, and some
very fine plains in the woods; they saw some trees like
cabbage-trees, a hut, and two small boats, ill-made."]</p>
<p>Next morning, the 29th of Apri1,<sup>*</sup> "the land appeared
different, barren, without wood." But "at daylight," writes Cook,
"we discovered a Bay which appeared to be tolerably well sheltered
from all winds, into which I resolved to go with the ship." As they
approached the South Head, a small smoke rose from a very barren
and rocky place, and, directing their glasses that way, they saw
ten "Indians," who soon left the fire, and "retired to a little
eminence, whence they could conveniently see the ships." Cook sent
the master in the pinnace to sound the entrance. Some of the
Indians followed, and, coming down to a cove a little within the
harbour, "invited our people to land by many signs and words." It
was observed, however, that they were "armed with long pikes and a
wooden weapon made like a short scimitar"&mdash;a throwing-stick
for the pike. Meanwhile other Indians remained on the rocks
opposite the ship. The bodies of some were painted with broad white
strokes, resembling a cross-belt, garters, and bracelets.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="lost-day" id="lost-day"></a>[* Dr.
Frederick Watson writes in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, 15th
September, 1920:<br>
<br>
"The accepted date for the landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay
appears in official publications and most histories as April 28,
1770. This is erroneous, the correct date being April 29; The
mistake originated with John Hawkesworth, LL.D., when he edited
Cook's voyage in the <i>Endeavour</i> for the British Government
(published in 1773), and the mistake has continued ever since. The
error has arisen in the following way:<br>
<br>
"In all the log books or journals except one, which were kept on
the <i>Endeavour</i>, the landing is described as taking place in
the p.m. of Sunday, April 29. These log books and journals, with
the one exception, were kept in nautical time, and the p.m. of
April 29 in such reckoning corresponded to the afternoon of April
28 civil time. In the one exception, a log book attributed to
Charles Green, the astronomer, the landing is described as taking
place in the p.m. of April 28. This log is presumably kept in
astronomical time, and the p.m. of the 28th would correspond to the
afternoon of April 28 civil time.<br>
<br>
"But Captain Cook, before touching on the coast of Australia, had
sailed from England, via Cape Horn. In the logs and journals, no
allowance was made for the day lost in sailing west across the
180th meridian of longitude until he arrived at Batavia, when
Thursday, October 11, 1770, was eliminated from the ship's
calendar.<br>
<br>
"The corrected reading of the logs and journals, kept in nautical
time, for the day of the landing at Botany Bay should be therefore
in the p.m. of Monday, April 30, instead of "Sunday, April 29,"
and, in the log kept in astronomical time, April 29, instead of
April 28. These dates correspond to the afternoon of April 29,
1770, according to the civil method of reckoning time.<br>
<br>
"Similar corrections must be made for most of the accepted dates
relating to the visit of Captain James Cook to the eastern coast of
Australia."<br>

Dr. Watson has very kindly corrected the dates throughout this

<br>
<b>59. COOK'S MAP OF BOTANY BAY<br>
(From Hawkesworth's <i>Cook's Voyages</i>.)</b></p>
<p>By noon the <i>Endeavour</i> was "within the mouth of the
inlet." Natives were seen on both heads of the Bay. Under the South
head were four small canoes, "the worst canoes," says Cook, "I ever
saw, made of one piece of bark, drawn or tied up at one end, with
the middle kept open by a stick." In each canoe was one man "who
held in his hand a long pole, with which he struck fish, venturing
with his little embarkation almost into the surf. These people
seemed to be totally engaged in what they were about; the ship
passed within a quarter of a mile of them, and yet they scarcely
lifted their eyes." At 2 p.m. the <i>Endeavour</i> anchored under
the South shore, abreast of a small village of six or eight houses.
An old woman came in from the bush with some sticks. She looked at
the ship, but expressed neither surprise nor concern, and lit a
fire. The fishermen landed and dressed their dinner, totally
unmoved by the sight of the ship about half a mile away. The
Englishmen also dined, and then manned the boats. "But, as soon as
we approached the rocks, two of the men came down, each armed with
a lance about ten feet long, and a short stick, which he seemed to
handle as if it was a machine to throw the lance." They showed
themselves "resolved to dispute our landing to their utmost, though
they were but two, and we thirty or forty." A parley of a quarter
of an hour was fruitless. The Indians "remained resolute." Muskets
with small shot were fired, lances were thrown, and the two
defenders of Australia ran away. The Englishmen went to the
"houses," threw beads and ribbons to the children, and took away
some forty or fifty lances.</p>
<p>Cook's chief wish was for water. He dug in the sand, and found a
little. He crossed to the North side, and found some pools on the
rocks. He returned to his diggings in the South, "by which means,
and a small stream they found fresh water sufficient to water the
ship." "A very fine stream" was afterwards found on the North
Shore, "in the first sandy cove within the island, before which the
ship might lay almost land-locked, and wood for fuel may be got
everywhere."</p>
<p>On the 2nd of May a party of ten explored the South Shore, and
"walked," says Banks, "till we completely tired ourselves." The
country, he notes, "consists of either swamps or light sandy soil,"
and its products are gum trees, and "vast quantities of grass."
Cook's impression was more favourable. The country, he says, was
"diversified with woods, lawns, and marshes...The woods are free
from underwood of every kind, and the trees are at such a distance
from one another, that the whole country, or at least great part of
it, might be cultivated without being obliged to cut down a single
tree.<sup>*</sup> We found the soil everywhere, except in the
marshes, to be of a light white sand, and produceth a quantity of
good grass, which grows in little tufts about as big as one can
hold in one's hand, and pretty close to one another; in this manner
the surface of the ground is coated." One hesitates to criticise
the agricultural notions of a farmer's son, especially when the
farmer's son is James Cook. But may one ask <i>is</i> "light white
sand" particularly suitable for "cultivation"? In fact, no
cultivators have yet tried the experiment, and the "light white
sand" still remains unfurrowed and undug a few miles away from a
population of three quarters of a million. I understand, however,
that there arc horses in the bush who agree with Cook that the
grass which it produceth is "good."</p>
<p class="note">[* Parkinson, Banks's botanical draughtsman, wrote
that the country was "very level and fertile." Pickersgill also
says that the soil was "fertile."</p>
<p>On the 4th of May, while Banks devoted the day to drying his
"collections of plants, now grown immensely large," Cook went in
the pinnace "almost to the head of the inlet." Here he landed, and
travelled some distance inland. The country was as before, but
"much richer," for "instead of sand," writes Cook, "I found in many
places a deep black soil, which we thought was capable of producing
any kind of grain. At present it produceth, besides timber, <i>as
fine meadow as ever was seen</i>;<sup>*</sup> however, we found it
not all like this, some places were very rocky, but this I believe
to be uncommon. The stone is sandy, and very proper for
building."</p>
<p class="note"><a name="meadows" id="meadows"></a>[* Where were
Cook's meadows? The question was asked with bitterness by the first
colonists, and is still discussed by Sydney historians. "The
pinnace," wrote Cook, "went to the head of the Bay...After which we
took water, and went almost to the head of the inlet." Was "the
inlet" George's River? Cook's map (<a href="#il-59">Illustration
59</a>) marks its estuary up to Tom Ugly's Point and a little
beyond. In 1788 Lieut. King saw, apparently near Sans Souci, "an
exceedingly fine black mould, with some excellent timber trees, and
very rich grass." And Tench, after going up George's River, wrote
that "the country around far exceeded in richness of soil that
about Cape Banks and Cape Solander." Or was "the inlet" Cook's
River? It is marked on Cook's map to a point near Tempe railway
station. Tench's opinion was that "Cook's meadows" were the swamps
about the estuary of Cook's River, in which he plunged knee deep,
in his hunt after Indian murderers. "We had passed," he wrote,
"through the country which the discoverers of Botany Bay extol as
'some of the finest meadows in the world.' These meadows, instead
of grass, are covered with high coarse rushes growing in a rotten
spongy bog, into which we were plunged knee-deep at every step."
Tench's <i>Complete Account</i>, p. 102. "Inland," wrote Banks in
his description of New Holland, "you sometimes meet with a bog,
upon which the grass grows rank and thick, so that no doubt the
soil is sufficiently fertile." Did Cook omit to notice that the
"deep black soil," which produced the "fine meadows" was a bog?
This seems the most probable opinion.]</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 5th, Cook crossed to the North Shore,
and walked three or four miles towards the future site of Sydney.
"We met," he says, "with nothing remarkable; great part of
the,country, for some distance inland from the sea coast, is mostly
a barren heath diversified with marshes and morasses." One may
to-day take Cook's afternoon walk, and still find "a barren heath
diversified with marshes and morasses," though a suburb is now at
last on its fringe. It is a lovely bush walk, on the side of still
lovelier coastal scenery. But Cook was thinking, not of scenery,
but of commerce and colonies; and the Sydney side showed "nothing
remarkable."</p>

<b>60. LANDING OF CAPTAIN COOK AT BOTANY BAY<br>
(From the painting by E. Phillips Pox in the National Gallery,
Melbourne. Reproduced by kind permission of the Trustees.)</b></p>
<p>What name shall we give to this Bay, so "spacious, safe, and
commodious"? Two things had seemed specially remarkable, the fish
and the wild-flowers. Shall we name it after its stingrays or after
its botany? The stingrays seemed likely to prevail. The seamen's
journals are full of praises of their number and of their size.
But, though Banks ate stingrays with reasonable appetite&mdash;a
stingray, he says, "was not quite so good as a skate nor was it
much inferior"&mdash;his mind centred in his collection of plants,
now grown so immensely large that it had become necessary to take
extraordinary care lest they should spoil in the books. One day, he
says, he "carried ashore all the drying paper, nearly two hundred
quires, of which the greater part was full, and spreading them upon
a sail in the sun, kept them in this manner exposed the whole day,
and sometimes turning the quires in which there were plants inside
out. By this means they came on board at night in very good
condition." They are still in very good condition, in spite of a
bad soaking in the Endeavour River, and some of them are now in the
Mitchell Library in Sydney, a few miles from the spot where they
were gathered a century and a half ago. No wonder if Banks began to
think them more worthy than a 336 lbs. stingray to give name to the
Bay.</p>
<p>It was a doubtful matter. Should the Bay be named after a
delight of the body, or after a delight of the mind?
Eighteenth-century seamen were carnal men, and the stingray won.
The Logs, which Cook and several other seamen wrote from day to
day, all tell that on the evening of the 6th of May the Bay was
named Stingray Harbour. Both Cook and Banks also wrote the same
name in their farewell notice of the coast of New Holland. An
officer named Pickersgill made a map, and wrote on it Stingray
Harbour. The plan at the Admiralty has the same name.<sup>*</sup>
The author of the <i>Journal of a Voyage Round the World</i>,
published September, 1771, wrote:&mdash;"We sailed from the bay
which we named Stingray Bay."</p>
<p class="note">[* Wharton, p. 247.]</p>
<p>Yet, when we look at the copy of Cook's Journal that was sent
home from Batavia, we read the following curious passage. "In the
evening the yawl returned from fishing, having caught two
stingrays, weighing near six hundred pounds. The great quantity of
plants Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found in this place occasioned my
giving it the name of Botany Bay." The passage is curious because
the second sentence is not what the first sentence would lead us to
expect. It was time to name the Bay, and the first sentence
suggests that the catch of gigantic stingrays occasioned Cook to
give it the name of Stingray Bay. And, when we look at the passage
which Cook wrote in his Log on the evening of the 6th of May, we
find that this was the case. He wrote down the sentence about the
catching of stingrays, which was afterwards copied into the
Journal; and then in the next sentence he wrote, exactly as we
would expect a logical Scotchman to write,&mdash;"The great
quantity of these sort of fishes found in this place occasioned my
giving it the name of Stingray Harbour." And when we look at the
manuscript copy of Cook's Journal&mdash;written in the handwriting
of a clerk; but signed by Cook's hand&mdash;we find that here also
the name first written was Stingray Harbour. But we observe that
the clerk has re-written his sentence, and has changed "fishes"
into "plants," and "Stingray" into "Bottany."<sup>*</sup> It seems
clear that, before this copy of the Journal was sent home from
Batavia, Banks had persuaded Cook that the fame of the Bay was not
in its perished Stingrays but in its immortal Botany.<sup>**</sup>
So the clerk was told to turn over the pages of the Journal, and to
write "Botany" for "Stingray"; and when Cook drew his <i>final</i>
map of the Bay he entitled it "A Sketch of Botany Bay." Banks also,
somewhat carelessly, turned over the pages of his own journal, in
which in several places he had written "Stingray Bay." In two
places<sup>***</sup> he corrected "Stingray" to "Botany"; but in
two places "Stingray" escaped his eye, and still stands to prove
that it held its own to the departure from New
Holland.<sup>****</sup> And on the vacant top of the pages on which
he had written the story of the visit, he wrote the headline
"Botany Bay."</p>
<p class="note">[* "These sort of fishes" and "Stingray" are
erased, and "plants Mr. Banks" and "Bottany" are written in their
places. "And Dr. Solander" is written above the line. See
Illustration 61, directly below.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Mr. Kitson, in the 1912 popular edition of his
<i>Life of Cook</i>, p. 149, says that "the only page known to
exist of the Journal of the first voyage <i>written by Cook</i>"
has, under 6th May, 1770, the following sentence: "The great number
of New Plants etc. our Gentlemen Botanists have collected in this
place occasioned my giving in (<i>sic</i>) the name of Botanist
Bay."<br>
<br>
It is unlucky that Mr. Kitson omitted to mention that this sentence
was written over another sentence which had been partially erased.
What Cook first wrote was as follows: "Sunday 6th. In the evening
the yawl returned with two stingrays one of them weighed [spces]
and the other [spaces] exclusive of the tails and entrails. The
great number (erasure) fish found at this place occasioned my
naming it Sting Ray Bay." The passage seems to show that the first
change was to <i>Botanist</i>. Banks, in the Journal now at
Auckland, which seems to be mainly a digest of Cook's Journal,
wrote <i>Botanists Bay</i>. Later the name was changed to
<i>Botany</i>. The unfortunate clerk, when told to make the
correction, spelt the word as he pleased. Under 23rd May he wrote
"<i>Bottonist</i>" and "<i>Botany</i>" on the same page.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** MS. <i>Journal</i>, vol. ii. pp. 204, 218.
When numbering his pages, at a later date, Banks made a mistake
which may cause confusion. He numbered p. 301, and then, turning
over, numbered the other side 202, and went through the 200's
again. Hence, e.g. there are two pages numbered 204. The reference
is to the second of these pages.]</p>
<p class="note">[**** MS. <i>Journal</i>, vol. ii. pp. 283 and 288.
It is curious that the name was written in the passage entitled
"Some account of New Holland," a passage which Banks must have
written after leaving Cape York.]</p>

<b>61. EXTRACT FROM THE "CORNER" COPY OF COOK'S JOURNAL</b></p>
<p>When we look through the manuscript copy of Cook's Journal, we
observe several other similar corrections. Port Stephens, Cape
Hawke, and Rockingham Bay, for example, are written in places where
earlier names have been erased. One can imagine the enthusiastic
word of Banks that, in this instance, convinced Cook of his
mistake. Banks had spent his last day in the Bay in "collecting
specimens of as many things as we possibly could, <i>to be examined
at sea</i>." As day by day this examination proceeded, as it was
realised that their treasure would revolutionise the realm of
Botany, how would the stingray be forgot!<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The "Admiralty" Journal has "Botany Bay," which
proves that this part of it must have been written later than the
"Corner" Journal. Parkinson wrote: "From the number of curious
plants we met with on shore we called the Bay Botany Bay." As
Parkinson died on the voyage from Batavia to the Cape, this passage
confirms the statement that the name was changed before the Cape
was reached. The author of the <i>Journal of a Voyage round the
World</i>, published September, 1771, says rightly that the Bay was
named "Stingray Bay"; and, somewhat curiously, omits to mention
that the name was changed to Botany Bay.]</p>
<p>The week's visit to Botany Bay fixed the site of the first
British colony in the Pacific. In 1779 Banks was examined by a
committee of the House of Commons, that had been appointed to
consider the question, what shall we do with our convicts? If it
was thought expedient to establish a colony of convicted felons in
a distant part whence escape would be difficult, and where from the
fertility of the soil they might be enabled to maintain themselves
after the first year with little or no help from England, what
place did Mr. Banks think best? His answer was&mdash;Botany Bay!
The seven months' voyage, he said, would make escape very
difficult. The natives were few and cowardly. The climate was like
that of the South of France. "The proportion of rich soil was small
in comparison to the barren, but was sufficient to support a very
large number of people." There were no beasts of prey, and sheep
and oxen would thrive. There was fish in plenty. The grass was long
and luxuriant. There were eatable vegetables. The country was well
supplied with water. There was abundant timber for fuel and for
buildings. The convicts would need one year's provisions, but
"afterwards with a moderate portion of industry might undoubtedly
maintain themselves without assistance from England." If they
formed a civil government they would increase, would provide a
market for European commodities, and it was not to be doubted that
New Holland, a country larger than Europe, would furnish matter of
advantageous return to the mother country. Banks's testimony was
the main cause of the choice of Botany Bay as the site of the
colony. And when the colony was founded, and after a prolonged
period of desperate misery, began to prosper, he said that he had
always known that this must happen. "The climate and soil," he
wrote in 1797, "are in my own opinion superior to most that have
been settled by Europeans. I have always maintained that assertion
<i>grounded on my own experience</i>."</p>
<p>After reading these words, we turn with interest to Banks's
account of his week at Botany Bay, and expect to find some glowing
picture of the place which impressed his mind so favourably. We are
disappointed, and even amazed! Not one word is there to suggest
that, as he walked himself tired over the light sandy soil of the
South Shore, tramped the sandy moors of the North,<sup>*</sup> or
looked for shells on Bare Island, he was dreaming of a British
colony on "soil superior to most that have been settled by
Europeans." He had described Tahiti as "an Arcadia." He had
recommended the River Thames in New Zealand as "the most proper
place we have yet seen for establishing a colony." But we have no
such winged word of suggestion for Botany Bay. Reading his Journal
we get the impression that he thought Botany Bay to be a very good
place for botanists, and a very bad place for colonists. And, if he
thought that, he thought right.</p>
<p class="note">[* He describes the soil as "very sandy and
resembles somewhat our moors in England."</p>
<p>The curious thing is that, while Banks, the enthusiast, has no
word of praise for anything in Botany Bay except its botany, Cook,
the cautious, has praise for nearly everything. It is Cook who
describes the Bay as "spacious, safe, and commodious," and who
points to "the very fine stream" on the North Shore, in a place
where "a ship might lay almost land-locked." It is Cook who makes
the suggestive and misleading remark that the country might be
cultivated without the cutting down of a single tree. It is Cook
who found at the head of the inlet "a deep black soil capable of
producing any kind of grain," and that <i>did</i> produce "as fine
meadow as ever was seen." It is Cook again who notes that "the
stone is sandy, and very proper for building." In short it is Cook
who thought that Botany Bay would be a good place for a settlement.
We do not know that he ever had the opportunity to testify publicly
to this effect. But one must guess that his conversation impressed
his friends, and among them Banks. Banks's recommendation of Botany
Bay as a place of settlement leaves me puzzled. But we may note, in
partial explanation, that, while it receives no support from his
own Journal, it receives fairly good support from Cook's.</p>
<p>And Cook was entirely wrong. Botany Bay is "spacious" enough,
but it is neither "safe" nor "commodious." When, eighteen years
later, Governor Phillip sailed into the Bay with his seven hundred
convict colonists, he found that there was no shelter from the East
winds, and that the greater part was so shoal that ships of even a
moderate draught of water were obliged to anchor with the entrance
of the Bay open, and were "exposed to a heavy sea that rolls in
when it blows hard from the Eastward."<sup>*</sup> "I did not see
any site," he wrote, "to which there was not strong objection." The
"very fine stream" on the North Shore was observed,<sup>**</sup>
and Lap&eacute;rouse must have used it when he anchored by that shore a
week later. But to Phillip it seemed that the least bad of all bad
places was near Point Sutherland, where there was a small run of
good water, though in very insufficient quantity,<sup>***</sup> and
in a place which the ships could not approach.</p>
<p class="note">[* "It will easily be perceived by looking at the
draft of this Bay," wrote Hunter, after a careful ten days' survey
in 1789, "that it is not possible to lie land-locked with a ship in
any part of it; you will always be exposed to the large sea which
tumbles in here with an easterly wind" (Hunter, p. 162, and
<i>Chart</i>, p. 160).]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Historical Records of N.S.W.</i>, vol. ii.
p. 589.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Tench writes: "Close to us was the spring at
which Mr. Cook watered, but we did not think the water very
excellent, nor did it run freely."]</p>
<p>The "light sandy soil" that might so easily be cultivated still
remains uncultivated. Exasperated colonists searched in vain for
"the fine meadows talked of in Cook's voyage." "I could never see
them," writes Surgeon White, "though I took some pains to find them
out; nor have I ever heard of a person that has seen any part
resembling them."<sup>*</sup> In George's River, at the head of the
Bay, "several good situations offered," wrote Phillip, "for a small
number of people, but none that appeared calculated for our
numbers," and "the swamps rendered the most eligible situation
unhealthy." It was true that there was plenty of good stone, but
the colonists were asking for bread. Botany Bay proved to be, as a
London writer<sup>**</sup> summed up the news, "picturesque and
pleasing to philosophers." In fact Cook's description seems
inexplicably optimistic; though it is fair to remember that he was
not thinking of convict colonists, and that he was in no way
responsible for Banks's preposterous promise that they would be
able to maintain themselves after one year without help from
England. We seem to be led to the conclusion that Sydney owes its
foundation to the fact that Cook, one of the most exact observers
who have ever observed, once in his life made a singular series of
mistakes.<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* King, however, climbing a hill, apparently near
San Souci, found "an exceedingly fine black mould, with some
excellent timber trees, and very rich grass" (<i>Historical Records
of N.S.W.</i>, vol. ii. p. 541).]</p>
<p class="note">[** Phillip's <i>Voyages</i>.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** The opinions of early visitors were
universally bad. "The whole country, as far as we saw," wrote Ross,
"appeared to us to be either sand, rock or swamp, and unfit for any
kind of cultivation." "A country and place so forbidding and so
hateful as only to merit execration and curses," wrote White under
date 17th April, 1790. P&eacute;ron wrote in 1802: "Botany Bay is a humid,
marshy, rather sterile place, and the anchorage for vessels is
neither good nor sure." Tench admits that the country round
George's River "far exceeds in richness the soil about Cape Banks
or Point Solander, though it is just as dry" (<i>Narrative</i>, p.
52). But after a nine days' survey of the Bay in Sept. 1789, he
wrote: "We were unanimously of opinion that, had not the nautical
part of Cook's description been so accurate, there would exist the
utmost reason to believe that those who have described the
contiguous country had never seen it. On the sides of the harbour,
a line of sea-coast more than 30 miles long, we did not find 200
acres that could be cultivated" (Tench's <i>Settlement at Port
Jackson</i>, p. 30).]</p>
<p>Cook sailed from Botany Bay at daylight on the 7th of May. At
noon they were two or three miles from land, and "abreast of a Bay
wherein there appeared to be safe anchorage." Cook called the Bay
Port Jackson, in honour of a Secretary of the Admiralty whose name
had already been given to a Bay in New Zealand. Banks does not
mention a Bay, but remarks that the coast "appeared broken and
likely for harbours."<sup>*</sup> Eighteen years later Governor
Phillip, exploring the coast for some harbour less bad than Botany
Bay, came to Port Jackson, saw in a flash of the eye that it was
"the finest harbour in the world," and dumped his convicts down on
the banks of Sydney Cove, five miles from the heads. Cook, who
sailed two or three miles from land, could see only a little way
into the harbour, but his chart, says Wharton, "gives the shape of
what he could see very accurately."</p>
<p class="note">[* In the Journal now at Auckland, however, Banks
wrote: "A Bay or Harbour in which appeared to be good anchorage,
this was called Port Jackson. Then he crossed out "good," and wrote
"safe"&mdash;Cook's word. The correction seems interesting and
almost conclusive evidence that in this Auckland Journal Banks made
a digest of Cook's Journal. Refer to the section <a href=
"#banks-man-jnl">BANKS'S MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS</a> in the
"Authorities" for Chapter XXII.]</p>
<p>Next day he saw "some broken land" that appeared to form a Bay,
which he named "Broken Bay." Cook's "Broken Bay" was in the
neighbourhood of Narrabeen. The Broken Bay of the modern map, that
splendid entrance to a river which Anthony Trollope thought more
beautiful than the Rhine, was a few miles to the North, and was not
seen from the <i>Endeavour</i>. On the 11th Cook saw "a small round
rock or island, laying close under the land," which has been
identified with Nobby Head at the entrance of Newcastle Harbour.
But Cook suspected the existence neither of this fine harbour, nor
of the river which flows into it, draining a fertile valley, which
would have been an incomparably better site for an infant colony
than Botany Bay or even Port Jackson. Next day he noted an inlet
which he named Port Stephens, which appeared to him, as he looked
from the masthead, to be sheltered from all winds. He described the
land Northward of Botany Bay as "diversified with an agreeable
variety of hills, ridges, and valleys, and large plains all clothed
with woods."</p>
<p>On the 17th he saw a "wide open Bay," which he named Moreton
Bay. Banks thought there must be a river at the back of it, because
the sea looked paler than usual; but Cook thought this appearance
was explained by the fine white sandy bottom. "Be this as it may,"
he writes, "it was a point which could not be cleared up, as we had
the wind; but, should anyone be desirous of doing it that may come
after me, this place may always be found by three hills which lay
to the Northward of it";&mdash;he named them the Glass Houses. The
land was sandy, and had no signs of fertility. With these words
Cook passed the Bay into which flows the river on which Brisbane
stands. On the 23rd he anchored in "a large open Bay," where he
found "room for a few ships to lay very secure, and a small stream
of fresh water." They killed a bustard, and named the place
"Bustard Bay." The country was visibly worse than at Botany Bay.
Banks noticed some tropical plants, "sure mark that we were on the
point of leaving the Southern temperate Zone." Some ants noticed
him, and bit more sharply than any he had felt in Europe.</p>
<p>Northward from Bustard Bay, "the coast is encumbered with
shoals," and Cook kept outside them.<sup>*</sup> Hence he passed
Port Curtis without observation. Among islands and reefs he groped
into "Thirsty Sound," so named "by reason we could find no fresh
water." The land was again bad; "no sign of fertility was to be
seen." After two days' stay, Cook sailed through a sea so "strewed
with dangers" that our modern hydrographer is amazed that he
"managed to keep his ship off the ground." He had sailed so close
to the land that he was not aware of the Great Barrier Reef, which
now began to near the coast. At sunset on the 11th of June, he saw
the first coral shoal. He decided "to stretch off all night, as
well to avoid the dangers we saw ahead, as to see if any islands
lay in the offing, especially as we now began to draw near the
Latitude of those discovered by Quiros, which some geographers, for
what reason I know not, have thought proper to tack to this land."
It was conceivable that he might see Espiritu Santo!</p>
<p class="note">[* Wharton, p. 261.]</p>
<p>It was a clear moonlight night, and he sailed with a fine breeze
of wind. The water deepened from twelve fathoms to twenty-one, and
then suddenly fell to twelve, ten, eight. Cook ordered all to their
stations, and prepared to anchor. But again they had twenty and
twenty-one fathoms, and continued in that depth until a few minutes
before 11 p.m., when they had seventeen;&mdash;and, before the man
at the head could heave another cast, the ship struck. Banks,
thinking the danger past, had gone to bed in perfect security;
"but," he writes, "scarcely were we warm in our beds when we were
called up with the alarming news of the ship being fast upon a
rock, of which she in a few minutes convinced us by beating very
violently against it...We were upon sunken coral rocks, the most
dreadful of all on account of their sharp points and grinding
quality, which cut through a ship's bottom almost immediately."</p>
<p>Cook "was upon deck in his drawers as the second blow was
struck, and gave his orders with his wonted coolness and
precision."<sup>*</sup> The ship had struck "about the top of high
water" at 11p.m. The hope was to get off at the next high tide.
They threw overboard forty or fifty tons, but the ship was not
afloat by a foot or more.<sup>**</sup> The tide again ebbed, and
again rose, and the leak gained upon the pumps.</p>
<p class="note">[* So writes Brougham, giving the gist of a
conversation with Banks. "I have heard Sir Joseph Banks describe
his (Cook's) habit of nightly making all the arrangements, and
giving all the orders which he deemed necessary when running along
an unknown coast, and having a lee-shore under his bow. After the
usual direction to call him if anything occurred, he would then
calmly undress and go to bed, and he was immediately asleep. Upon
that trying occasion he was upon deck in his drawers as the second
blow was struck."]</p>
<p class="note">[** "It is now known that on this coast it is only
every alternate tide that rises to a full height" (Wharton, p.
276).]</p>
<p>"It was," writes Cook in careful language, "an alarming and
terrible circumstance, and threatened immediate destruction." Banks
despaired of the ship, packed what might possibly be saved, and
prepared for the worst. The only hope now was to haul at the
anchors. Yet, if the ship were got off the rocks, the leak would be
still bigger, and the end would come at once. The land could be
seen six or seven leagues away. But "we well knew," writes Banks,
"that our boats were not capable of carrying us all ashore, so that
some, probably most of us, must be drowned; a better fate, may be,
than those would have who should get ashore without arms to defend
themselves from the Indians, or provide themselves with food, in a
country where we had not the least reason to hope for subsistence,
so barren had we always found it; and, had they even met with good
usage from the natives and food to support them, debarred from the
hope of ever seeing again their native country, or conversing with
any but savages, perhaps the most uncivilised in the world."</p>
<p>But the danger had to be faced. The capstan and windlass were
manned, and they began to heave. At 10 p.m. she floated, and was
hauled into deep water. To their delight and amazement she leaked
no worse than before. By some miracle the desper&agrave;te peril had
passed. The miracle was explained a little later. But for the
present we should note that the escape was due not merely to
miracle, but, also to skill, and still more to character. Cook
seldom praised people, and, when he praised, he praised in measured
words. His sailors got more floggings than compliments, and there
are hints that he regarded "gentlemen" as a nuisance.<sup>*</sup>
Yet he now allowed</p>
himself to write:&mdash;"In justice to the ship's company I must
say that no men ever behaved better than they had done on this
occasion; animated by the behaviour of every gentleman on board,
every man seemed to have a just sense of the danger we were in, and
exerted himself to the utmost."
<p class="note">[* Cf. Cook's Journal under date 23rd May, 1770:
"he (Magra) being one of those <i>gentlemen</i> frequently found on
board King's ships that can very well be spared," and the original
manuscript has another phrase which has been crossed out. With
difficulty I have read the deleted words. They are: "to speak more
plain, good for nothing." The note which Cook afterwards wrote with
his own hand on the margin of the copy of his Journal&mdash;see
<a href="#il-57">Illustration 57</a>&mdash;shows that he was led to
take a less unfavourable view of Magra's conduct.]</p>
<p>Banks, who had worked with the rest for twenty-four hours till
he was "much fatigued," writes in livelier language:&mdash;"The
seamen worked with surprising cheerfulness and alacrity; no
grumbling or growling was to be heard throughout the ship, not even
an oath, though the ship was in general as well furnished with them
as most in His Majesty's service." Their conduct seemed to Banks
not only admirable but also somewhat surprising, for, "as soon as a
ship is in desperate situation," the seamen, so he had always
heard, "commonly begin to plunder and refuse all command." He
attributed their virtue on this occasion to "the cool and steady
conduct of the officers, who, during the whole time, never gave an
order that did not show them to be perfectly composed and unmoved
by the circumstances, however dreadful they might appear." Both
officers and gentlemen proved themselves heroes. But let us not
miss this opportunity to do justice to the seamen of the
<i>Endeavour</i>. They were not wholly heroes. They got drunk
whenever they could get drink. They had "tapped" every cask of wine
on board, says Banks. They grumbled, and growled, and swore. Yet
they were at least able to see something heroic in the man who
ruled them, and to strive bravely and faithfully for their ship in
face of appalling danger.</p>
<p>The leak, though less, still gave anxiety, and it was decided to
"fother" the ship. Cook gave the job to Midshipman Monkhouse, who
had seen the process in use. Banks describes it in detail. A large
quantity of finely chopped oakum and wool was loosely stitched to a
sail, which was sunk under the ship. The expectation was that the
oakum and wool would be sucked into the leak, and would close it.
The experiment was entirely successful. "In about a quarter of an
hour to our great surprise the ship was pumped dry, and, upon
letting the pumps stand, she was found to make very little
water."</p>
<p>The boats were sent to look for a harbour, and returned with
good news. They had found the mouth of a river, the entrance of
which "was, to be sure, narrow enough and shallow, but, when once
in, the ship might be moved afloat so near the shore that, by a
stage from her to it, all the cargo might be got out and in again
in a short time." Entangled among shoals, Cook cautiously groped
towards the opening. Twice in the narrow channel the ship ran
ashore. But, "by the evening, she was moored within twenty feet of
the shore, and before night much lumber was taken out of her."</p>
<p>On the 22nd of June, at the place where Cooktown now stands, the
<i>Endeavour</i> was beached and examined. It was found that the
hole was large enough "to have sunk a ship with twice our
pumps...The coral rock had cut through the plank, and deep into one
of the timbers, smoothing the gashes before it, so that the whole
might easily be imagined to have been cut with an axe." Then the
rock had broken off, and had plugged the hole with a stone as big
as a man's fist. Hence the miracle that the ship when hauled off
had not sunk. The sheathing had been torn off, which, Cook feared,
would "let the worm into her bottom, and be of bad consequence."
But no thorough repair, no thorough examination even, could now be
made. Cook did his best to believe the assurances of the "master"
and the carpenter that no very serious damage had been done. He
<i>had</i> to sail the ship to Batavia "through an unknown and
perhaps dangerous sea," and he could only hope that she would get
there. What repairs were possible were finished by the 26th of
June. But they failed to get the ship afloat till the 4th of July.
Cook was ready to put to sea on the 21st. But persistent South-East
winds prevented sailing till the 6th of August.</p>
<p>It was a happy month for Banks. He and Solander were already
ashore "plant-gathering," while the <i>Endeavour</i> was blundering
up the Channel, and they enjoyed every hour. It was a time of
zoological romance. A seaman told Banks that he had seen "an animal
about the size of, and much like, a one gallon cagg. It was, says
he, as black as the devil, and had wings; indeed I took it for the
devil, or I might easily have catchcd it, for it crawled through
the grass." In the end Banks concluded that the crawling devil was
a large bat; the modern historian (Kitson) says it was a flying
fox.</p>
<p>But greatest excitement was caused by news of "an animal as
large as a greyhound, of a mouse colour, and very swift." Banks
himself got an imperfect view of the strange monster;&mdash;"he was
not only like a greyhound in size and running, but had a tail as
long as any greyhound's; what to liken him to I could not tell;
nothing that I have seen at all resembles him." Later, the monsters
were chased by Banks's dog: "but they beat him owing to the length
and thickness of the grass, which prevented him from running, while
they at every bound leapt over the tops of it. We observed, much to
our surprise, that, instead of going on all fours, the animal went
only upon two legs, making vast bounds, just as the jerboa does."
At last the Second Lieutenant "had the good fortune to kill the
animal which had so long been the subject of our speculation. To
compare it to any European animal would be impossible, as it had
not the least resemblance to any one I have seen." Next day they
ate it for dinner, and it "proved excellent meat." Later, they
spent a day "hunting the wild animal," and killed "a very large
one, weighing eighty-four pounds."</p>
<p>Banks saw many other remarkable things. The nests of white ants
reminded him of Druidical monuments. The pinnace brought back
cockles so large that one of them contained twenty pounds of meat,
more than two men could eat. The coxswain, who was a little man,
said that he had seen a shell so large that he had been able to get
inside it. Cocoa-nuts were picked up crested with
barnacles;&mdash;"a sure sign that they have come by sea," probably
from the land discovered by Quiros. How far that land lay to
Eastward Cook thought it hard to say. But at all events he had, so
he claimed, made it "morally certain" that Quiros "never was upon
any part of <i>this</i> coast." He did not know that, the year
before, Bougainville had made the same thing absolutely certain by
sailing from the land of Quiros to the reefs off New Holland.</p>

<br>
<b>62. THE <i>Endeavour</i> IN ENDEAVOUR RIVER<br>
(From Hawkesworth's <i>Cook's Voyages</i>.</b></p>
<p>One day Banks and the Second Lieutenant walked a good way up the
river, and Banks made the most favourable remark that he ever made
about any part of Australia. The country, he said, was "generally
low, thickly covered with long grass, and seemed to promise great
fertility were the people to plant and improve it." They camped for
the night on the banks of the river, and made a fire; but the
mosquitoes "followed us into the very smoke, nay almost into the
fire, which, hot as the climate was, we could better bear the heat
of than their intolerable stings." Next day they hunted "the
animal," and camped at night on a broad sandbank, lying on
plaintain leaves under the shade of a bush. The mosquitoes did not
trouble, and the weary were at rest;&mdash;"all of us slept almost
without intermission." They returned to the ship next day, shooting
some ducks, and observing a seven-foot alligator crawl from the
mangroves into the water.</p>
<p>It was in the Endeavour River that the Englishmen made their
only successful attempt to become acquainted with the natives. At
Botany Bay these had remained sullenly hostile. At Bustard Bay and
Thirsty Sound none had been seen. But at Endeavour River a very
precarious friendship was established. For though the natives
showed no interest in the Englishmen's toys, they showed a very
deep interest in the turtles which the Englishmen caught on the
reef. They came on board ship and asked for one, and, when their
request was refused,&mdash;it was their reef, and therefore it was
their turtle&mdash;they began to haul it away. And, when the unjust
Englishmen took it from them, they started a bush-fire, which all
but consumed Banks's tent. "I had little idea," he writes, "of the
fury with which the grass burnt in this hot climate, nor of the
difficulty of extinguishing it when once alighted."</p>
<p>The men of science were anxious to see if the natives of the
East resembled the natives of the West, who had been described by
Dampier, in general a "faithful relater." "They are," Dampier had
written, "of a very unpleasing aspect, having no one graceful
feature in their faces. Their hair is short and curled like that of
the negroes, and not long and lank like the common Indians. The
colour of their skins is coal-black like that of the negroes of
Guinea." And he had mentioned that "the two fore-teeth of their
upper jaw are wanting in all of them." Banks noticed that the
appearance of the Eastern natives was different. They did not want
front teeth. Their hair was lank, and neither woolly nor frizzled.
Their outside appeared the colour of wood-soot; but, as they were
covered with eternal filth, the native colour of the subterranean
skin was hard to tell. Banks, with his usual scientific
thoroughness, spat on his finger, and tried to penetrate the crust.
As he worked deeper, the colour altered very little, but perhaps
was nearer chocolate than coal-black. They had holes through their
noses, with "sprit-sail yards rigged across," said the sailors.
Still they were very much pleasanter to look at than had been the
inhuman creatures whom Dampier had seen on the West. Cook thought
their features "far from being disagreeable," and their voices
"soft and tunable."</p>
<p>They lived, however, like Dampier's Westerners. "They seem,"
writes Cook, "to have no fixed habitation, but move about from
place to place, like wild beasts in search of food...We never saw
one inch of cultivated ground in the whole country. Their houses
are mean small hovels, not much bigger than an oven...They have not
the least knowledge of iron or any other metal; their working tools
must be of stone, bone, and shell." Their darts, however, could be
hurled by throwing-sticks to a distance of forty or fifty yards
with almost, if not quite, as good an aim as an English musket. It
was Cook's duty, as an eighteenth-century philosopher, to add that,
though the natives of New Holland were apparently the most wretched
people on the earth, they were "in reality far more happier than we
Europeans, being wholly unacquainted with the necessary
conveniences so much sought after in Europe; they are happy in not
knowing the use of them." Banks expressed the same opinion; but, as
we have seen, he had no wish to stay in New Holland to learn the
happiness of the simple life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cook had been tied to the ship, anxiously supervising
repairs, and sending out boats to seek a channel among baffling
shoals and reefs. He never found time even to go to the head of the
harbour. He climbed the hills, however, and saw "a melancholy
prospect of the difficulties we are to encounter, for, in whatever
direction we looked, it was covered with shoals as far as the eye
could see." At last, on the 6th of August, he put to sea to face
one of the most dangerous tasks that has ever been faced by seaman.
He knew that the ship was in a bad state, though happily he did not
know how very bad its state was. He had provisions only for three
months, at short allowance. He had to race against time through a
sea of which he had no knowledge save that, in the very face of
him, it bristled with difficulties and dangers. If ever Cook in
later years had bad dreams&mdash;though I do not believe he
had&mdash;they were probably founded on his experiences between
Endeavour River and Cape York. The voyage was a nightmare in
navigation. Probably Cook did not dream about it; but he described
it, in words as truc as they were simple, as "the most dangerous
navigation that perhaps ever ship was in."</p>
<p>Sending the pinnace ahead to sound, Cook kept a look out from
the mast-head. He could see no passage;&mdash;nothing but breakers
extending endlessly to sea. He made a little way Northward, but his
hopes were disappointed by more reefs and breakers, "in a manner
all round us"; and in hot bad temper he called one deceiving
headland Cape Flattery." Landing on an island, he climbed a high
hill, whence he saw a reef of rocks, two or three miles away,
extending out of sight, on which the sea broke very high. It was
the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef. He saw several breaks in
the reef, and he determined to sail through one of them into the
open sea. "By keeping in with the main land we should be in
continual danger, besides the risk we should run in being locked in
with reefs and shoals." So he sailed through the passage in the
Barrier Reef that is now known by his name, and "found a large sea
rolling in from the South-East," which gave him "no small joy."
Ever since the 26th of May he had been "entangled among islands and
shoals." He had "sailed above three hundred and sixty leagues by
the lead, without ever having a leadsman out of the chains when the
ship was under sail; a circumstance that perhaps never happened to
any ship before, and yet it was here absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>Cook now sailed outside the Barrier Reef. But the course was
unsatisfactory. He was missing the chance of surveying an unknown
coast. He was also afraid of "overshooting the passage (between New
Holland and New Guinea) supposing there to be one"; and he "firmly
believed" there was one. And he now found that the dangers of the
outside course were even greater than those of the inside. The
"large hollow sea" proved that the ship had been damaged more than
had been thought, and one pump had to be kept constantly at work.
The trade wind blew them towards the reef, and they studied its
formation with an interest that was keener than that of simple
curiosity, and inspired an admirable description. "A reef such as
one speaks of is scarcely known in Europe. It is a wall of coral
rock, rising almost perpendicularly out of the unfathomable ocean,
always overflown at high water, generally seven or eight feet, and
dry in places at low water. The large waves of the vast ocean,
meeting with so sudden a resistance, make a terrible surf breaking
mountains high, especially in one case, where the general trade
wind blows directly upon it."<sup>*</sup> The tide dragged them
within eighty or a hundred yards of the breakers.</p>
<p class="note">[* Banks, p. 294. The passage also appears in the
"Admiralty" copy of Cook's Journal, which was written later than
the "Corner" copy, and in this part is much fuller (Wharton, p.
303). It seems that the clerk in writing the Admiralty copy had the
use of Banks's Journal.]</p>
<p>"The same sea that washed the side of the ship rose in a breaker
prodigiously high the very next time it did rise; so that between
us and destruction was only a dismal valley, the breadth of one
wave, and even now no bottom could be felt with one hundred and
twenty fathoms." Shipwreck seemed inevitable. Land was ten leagues
away, and the boats could not possibly carry the crew. "All the
dangers we had escaped were little in comparison of being thrown
upon this reef, where the ship must be dashed to pieces in a
moment."</p>
<p>Cook made for a small opening in the reef, not wider than the
length of the ship. They reached it&mdash;just too late, "the tide
of ebb rushing out like a mill-stream, so that it was impossible to
get in." The boats, with the help of the tide, pulled them one and
a half miles away; but the returning tide would certainly bear them
back on the reef. Cook made for another opening, a quarter of a
mile broad. "Narrow and dangerous as it was, it seemed to be the
only means of saving her as well as ourselves. A light breeze soon
sprang up at East-North-East, with which, the help of our boats,
and a flood tide, we soon entered the opening, and were hurried
through in a short time by a rapid tide like a mill-race." Once
more the faulty men of the <i>Endeavour</i> had shown ability to
grasp fortune. "In this truly terrible situation," says Cook, "not
one man ceased to do his utmost, and that with as much calmness as
if no danger had been near." They could not have been calmer than
the men of science. When the danger was at its extreme height, they
were taking a Lunar to obtain the Latitude. "These observations,"
records Mr. Green," were very good...We were about a hundred yards
from the reef, where we expected the ship to strike every minute,
it being calm, no soundings, and the swell heaving us right
on."</p>
<p>Only a few days had passed since Cook had felt "no small joy" in
his escape from the perils inside the reef. He had now by miracle
escaped the far greater perils outside. His Journal betrays an
unusual fatigue of mind and spirit in a passage of unusual
frankness. "Such," he comments, "are the vicissitudes attending
this kind of service, and must always attend an unknown navigation,
where one steers wholly in the dark, without any manner of guide
whatever. Was it not from the pleasure which naturally results to a
man from his being the first discoverer, even was it nothing more
than land or shoals, this kind of service would be insupportable."
The explorer will certainly be accused, either of "timorousness and
want of perseverance," or of "temerity, and perhaps want of
conduct." Cook was certain that the first of these charges would
never be brought against him. But he owns that he has engaged more
among the islands and shoals upon this coast than perhaps in
prudence he ought to have done with a single ship. But, had he not
done so, he would have remained ignorant of its produce; in short,
"it would have been far more satisfactory to me never to have
discovered it." Thus Cook apologizes!</p>
<p>Cook had leapt from the frying-pan into the fire, and was now
glad that a second leap had brought him back into nothing hotter
than the frying-pan. He was again encompassed on every side by
islands and shoals, "but so much does a great danger swallow lesser
ones that those once dreaded spots were now looked upon with less
concern." Moreover, he was determined to clear up once for all the
ancient uncertainty whether or not a strait existed between New
Holland and New Guinea. In this determination he was facing a great
risk. If there proved to be not a strait but a bay, he would have
to fight out, as Bougainville had fought out, against the trade
wind, and in most dangerous seas. But he had been convinced, by
Dalrymple's Chart, and by Banks's explanations, that it was very
probable that there was a strait, and he had come "to the fixed
resolution" to bring home exact news of it.</p>
<p>It is hard to trace his slow progress among shoals and islands,
"by a route that no one has again followed,"<sup>*</sup> with boat
all the time ahead signalling shallow water.<sup>**</sup> On the
21st of August they observed that "the main looked very narrow, so
we began," says Banks, "to look out for the passage we expected to
find between New Holland and New Guinea. At noon one was seen very
narrow, but appearing to widen." Cook named the Northern Promontory
York Cape "in honour of his late Royal Highness."</p>
<p class="note">[* Wharton, p. xxxi.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Wharton, p. 309.]</p>
<p>Ahead they saw islands, detached by narrow channels from the
mainland. Cook sent the boats to sound the Channel next to the
main. Shoals and rocks were discovered, and he signalled the boats
to lead through the next channel to the Northward. The ship
followed, and Cook satisfied himself that he "had at last found out
a passage into the Indian Seas." He had now completed his survey of
the Eastern coast of New Holland from Latitude 38&deg;, a coast which
he was confident had "never been seen or visited by any European
before us."<sup>*</sup> He landed on an island (Possession Island)
and, "a little before sunset, took possession of the country in his
Majesty's name, and fired 3 volleys of small arms on the occasion,
which was answered from the ship."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* In 1786 Dalrymple, moved by immortal hatred of a
supplanter, wrote a statement which meant that the
Portuguese-French maps of the sixteenth century proved that the
Eastern coast had been seen and visited by Europeans 200 years
before Cook's voyage; that Cook had known this fact perfectly well;
and that he had sought to pose as first discoverer by stealing the
old names (Major, p. xxxi.). The accusation was as ridiculous as it
was malicious. If Cook had, in the circumstances imagined, wished
to conceal the old discovery, he would carefully have
<i>avoided</i> the old names. But it seems perfectly certain that
in 1770 Cook had no acquaintance with these old maps. Even
Dalrymple had no acquaintance with them in 1770; for in his
<i>Voyages</i>, published that year, he does not mention them. It
seems that Banks heard of one of these old maps after his return,
bought it&mdash;at what date is not known&mdash;and gave it to the
British Museum in 1790. Unluckily we do not know what he thought
about the map. <i>If</i> the name <i>Botany Bay</i> had been given
after the return to England, a possible though improbable view
would be that it was suggested by the <i>Coste des Herbaiges</i> of
the old map. But I am sure that the name <i>Botany Bay</i> was
given in the course of the voyage, and that the sufficient
suggestion came from Banks's collection of plants. In his second
voyage, Cook named an island off New Caledonia <i>Botany
Island</i>, "because it contained in so small a space a flora of
thirty species" (Forster, vol. ii. p. 439). If Cook and Banks
thought that the old map showed a previous discovery of the East
coast, I have no doubt they said so, and without sense of
diminished glory. Cook would have been as much pleased by
identifying a Portuguese <i>Botany Bay</i> as he was pleased by
identifying Quiros's Bay of St. Philip and St. James. See able
discussions by Major, pp. xxxi. <i>et seq</i>., and by Bladen in
<i>Historical Records of N.S.W.</i>, vol. i. part i. pp. xxiii. and
p. 161.]</p>
<p class="note">[**</p>
<p>1 Cook's <i>Private Log</i>.]</p>
<p>With the pinnace feeling the way before her, the
<i>Endeavour</i> sailed through the straits to which Cook gave the
ship's name, passing safely over the great bank which nearly bars
its Western end, and which has caused it to be disused in favour of
the "deep though narrow channel"<sup>*</sup> North of Prince of
Wales Island. He landed on Booby Island, "now the great landmark
for ships making Torres Strait from the West."<sup>**</sup> A swell
from the South-West, "together with other concurring
circumstances," writes Cook, "left me no room to doubt but we had
got to the Westward of Carpentaria, or the Northern extremity of
New Holland, and had now an open sea to the Westward; which gave me
no small satisfaction, not only because the dangers and fatigues of
the voyage were drawing to an end, but by being able to prove that
New Holland and New Guinea are two separate lands or islands, which
until this day hath been a doubtful point with geographers. As I
believe it was known before, I claim no other merit than the
clearing up of a doubtful point." That is to say, Cook had been
told by Banks, on the authority of Dalrymple, that Torres,
according to a statement of Dr. Arias, had sailed through the
strait in 1606. But he held that the truth of this statement needed
to be proved by modern experience; and this proof he had now
established. He had sailed through one channel, and he believed
that a better channel would some day be discovered among the
islands he could see to the North, "if ever it became an object to
be looked for."</p>
<p class="note">[* Wharton, p. 313.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Wharton. p. 314.]</p>
<p>In his Log, written from day to day, Cook said that "possession
was taken of <i>the country</i>"; no name is mentioned. Banks, in
his Journal, described the country he was leaving under the
headline "Some account of New Holland";&mdash;evidence again that
no new name had been given. In the copy of Cook's Journal which he
sent home from Batavia the country is named New Wales;<sup>*</sup>
which seems to show that the name was given in the course of the
voyage from Cape York to Batavia. In the two copies of Cook's
Journal, which were written apparently on the voyage from Batavia
to England,<sup>**</sup> the name is "New <i>South</i> Wales." And
Banks, perhaps at the same date, corrected his headline as
follows:&mdash;"Some account of that part of New Holland now called
New South Wales."<sup>***</sup> When Dr. Hawkesworth, using the
Journals of Cook and Banks, wrote his account of the voyage, he
generally called the country "New Holland"; but he wrote "New
Wales" once (vol. iii. p. 649), and New South Wales twice (vol.
iii. pp. 616 and 622).<sup>****</sup> There seems to be no evidence
as to Cook's reason for giving the name of New Wales, and for
changing that name to New South Wales.<sup>*****</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* "New Wales" is written on a space from which
other words had been erased. I thought that patient study of the
erased words might throw light on this curious problem. But, as far
as I can make out, what the clerk wrote first was "<i>New
Whales</i>"! The pages of this part of the Journal are headed: "New
Wales, or East Coast of New Holland."]</p>

<p class="note">[***** In an interesting letter in the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>, 29th Jan., 1921, Captain James H. Watson, a
very thorough and helpful student of early Australian history,
points to the curious fact that a territory in Hudson's Bay was
called <i>New Wales</i>, <i>South Wales</i>, and <i>New South
Wales</i>. If Cook, on his homeward voyage, turned over the
multitudinous leaves of <i>Harris's Voyages</i>, vol. ii.(1744-1748
edition)&mdash;I do not remember evidence that it was in the
<i>Endeavour's</i> library, but surely it was&mdash;he would have
read (p. 245) that in 1611 Thomas Button, a Welshman, discovered "a
great continent called by him <i>New Wales</i>." On p. 413 he would
have read that in 1621 Thomas James named the land "the
Principality of <i>South Wales</i>." On p. 284 he would have read
"all that country goes by the name of <i>New South Wales</i>; and
on p. 404 that Button "discovered another country to which he gave
the name of <i>New South Wales</i>." If he had turned to the atlas
of Robert de Vaugondy, geographer of Louis XV., dated
1751&mdash;surely it also was in the <i>Endeavour's</i>
library&mdash;he would have found that the author, after describing
James's discovery, wrote "all the entrance of this bay was called
<i>New South Wales</i>."<br>
<br>
"<i>This</i> New South Wales," writes Captain Watson, "must have
been known to Cook, as, being on the charts of the period, it must
have come under his notice during the time he was engaged on survey
work on the coast of Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence River." It
would seem unlikely that Cook would have in mind this <i>New South
Wales</i> of Hudson's Bay when he beat his brains for a name for
the Eastern coast of New Holland. But the coincidence of the change
from <i>New Wales</i> to <i>New South Wales</i> is certainly
curious; and it is also noteworthy that, as Captain Watson has
remarked, the "General Chart" of the world in the 1784 edition of
Cook's <i>Voyages</i> has <i>New South Wales</i> not only in New
Holland but also in Hudson's Bay. Cook had a way of naming places
without giving his reasons; and, when his reasons are given by
another, they are not always reasons that would have occurred to
everybody. He gave the name <i>New Hebrides</i>, Forster explains,
because "the Hebrides are the westernmost islands of Great
Britain"; and the name of <i>New Caledonia</i> because it "suited
not only the good disposition of the people, but also with the
nature of the country." The natives, Cook wrote, "had little else
than good nature to bestow, in which they exceed all the nations we
have yet met with"; but he considered it unnecessary and
superfluous to explain that it was for this reason that he called
their country <i>New Caledonia</i> (see <a href=
"#new-caledonia">below</a>). He may have had an equally good reason
for giving the name of <i>New Wales</i> and <i>New South Wales</i>,
but it remains unexplained. The best guess&mdash;in fact the only
guess&mdash;is that there came into mind Thomas Button's discovery
of "a great continent, called by him <i>New Wales</i>."]</p>

<b>63. EXTRACT FROM BANKS'S JOURNAL</b></p>
<p>Both Cook and Banks wrote systematic descriptions of the land
which they had coasted for two thousand miles.</p>
<p>Banks's description of the country of which he was to become the
Patron Saint was in the highest degree unfavourable. Patriotic
Australians cannot resent his desscription, for it is a very
accurate description of what he saw. But we may regret that our
candid friend enjoyed no opportunity to see some of the more
pleasing aspects of the country which he was to recommend nine
years later as the best possible locality for a British settlement.
One would imagine, as one reads his Journal, that his main purpose
was to make quite sure that no Englishman would ever think of
settling in New Holland.</p>
<p>"In the whole length of the coast which we sailed along, there
was a very unusual sameness to be observed in the face of the
country. Barren it may justly be called, and in a very high degree,
at least as far as we saw. The soil in general is sandy and very
light; on it grows grass tall enough, but thin set, and trees of a
tolerable size, never however near together, being in general
forty, fifty or sixty feet apart. This, and spots of loose sand,
sometimes very large, constitute the general face of the country,
as you sail along it, and, indeed, the greater part even after
penetrating inland as far as our situation would allow us to do.
The banks of the bays were generally clothed with thick mangroves,
sometimes for a mile or more in breadth. The soil under these is
rank, and always overflowed every spring tide. Inland, you
sometimes meet with a bog, upon which the grass grows rank and
thick, so that no doubt the soil is sufficiently
fertile.<sup>*</sup> The valleys also between the hills, where runs
of water come down, are thickly clothed with underwood; but they
are generally very steep and narrow, so that, upon the whole, the
fertile soil bears no kind of proportion to that which seems by
nature doomed to everlasting barrenness. Water is a scarce article,
or at least was so when we were there (April to August), which I
believe to have been the very height of the dry season. At some
places we saw not a drop, and at the two places where we filled for
the ship's use (Botany Bay and Bustard Bay) it was done from pools
not brooks.<sup>**</sup> This drought is probably owing to the
dryness of a soil entirely composed of sand in which high hills are
scarce.</p>
<p class="note">[* See note, <a href="#meadows">earlier</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** This statement does not seem consistent with
the previous statement about "the hills where runs of water come
down." But the hills and runs of water must have been at the
Endeavour River, where Cook says there were "several fine
rivulets." The "two places where we filled for the ship's use" must
be Botany Bay and Bustard Bay. But Cook writes of "a small stream"
at both those places.]</p>
<p>"A soil so barren, and at the same time entirely void of the
help derived from cultivation, could not be supposed to yield much
to the support of man. We had been so long at sea, with but a
scanty supply of fresh provisions, that we had long been used to
eat everything we could lay our hands upon, fish, flesh, or
vegetables, if only they were not poisonous, yet we could only now
and then procure a dish of bad greens for our own table, and never,
except in the place where the ship was careened, did we meet with a
sufficient quantity to supply the ship"; and Banks gives a list of
the "bad greens" they had managed to eat. They had found no eatable
fruits, save in the South a cherry with nothing but a slightly acid
taste to recommend it, and in the North "a very indifferent fig."
They tried some palm nuts, but were "deterred from a second
experiment by a hearty fit of vomiting." The hogs ate the nuts with
good appetite, and the men envied the hogs their powers of
digestion; but two hogs died, and the rest were saved only by
careful nursing. The only useful plants were the gum tree, and a
bulrush which gave a resin of a bright yellow. In view of the
barrenness of the soil, the variety of plants seemed wonderful, but
they were as useless as they were various. Even the timber was so
hard that the carpenter who cut firewood complained that his tools
were damaged.</p>
<p>As to fish, flesh, and fowl, voyagers sick of sea-fare could eat
with joy anything that was not salt and that was not poisonous. "A
hawk or a crow was to us as delicate, and perhaps a better relished
meal than a partridge or a pheasant to those who had plenty of
dainties." But "Kangooroos" were scarce, and birds were shy. "A
crow in England, though in general sufficiently wary, is, I must
say, a fool to a New Holland crow, and the same may be said of
almost all, if not all, the birds of the country." And, making an
effort to say all that could be said for the country, he concludes
as follows:&mdash;"Upon the whole, New Holland, though in every
respect the most barren country I have seen, is not so bad but
that, between the production of sea and land, a company who had the
misfortune to be shipwrecked upon it might support themselves even
by the resources that we have seen; undoubtedly a longer stay and a
visit to different parts would discover many more."</p>
<p>That was the best that our Patron Saint could say in favour of
our country. We cannot complain of his criticism, for it was just
criticism of what he saw. But we may, perhaps, be permitted to
wonder at the contrast between this criticism of 1770 and the
praise of 1779 and of later dates. In 1797 he wrote that the soil
of New Holland was in his opinion superior to most that have been
settled by Europeans, and that this opinion was grounded <i>on his
own experience</i>. Yet, immediately after he had gained this
experience, he summed up New Holland as in every respect the most
barren country he had seen. He wrote no words of suggestion that
colonists would do well to settle there; and the nearest he got to
that suggestion was in the remark that, "were any man to settle
here," he would find the study of ants uncommonly
interesting&mdash;"industrious as they are, their courage, if
possible, excels their industry." One can only explain the contrast
by some theory of the growing optimism of old age.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cook's description shows that he had in mind
the idea of colonization, and that he regarded New South Wales with
favour. He states plainly, it is true, that "the land naturally
produces hardly anything fit for man to eat," that "the natives
know nothing of agriculture," and that "the country itself, so far
as we know, doth not produce any one thing that can become an
article in trade to invite Englishmen to fix a settlement upon it.
However," he continues, "this Eastern side is not that barren and
undesirable country that Dampier and others have described the
Western side to be. We are to consider that we see this country in
the pure state of nature; the industry of man has had nothing to do
with any part of it, and yet we find all such things as nature had
bestowed upon it in a flourishing state. In this extensive country,
it can never be doubted but what most sorts of grain, fruit, roots,
etc., of every kind would flourish here were they once brought
hither, planted and cultivated by the hands of industry, and here
are provender for more cattle at all seasons of the year than ever
can be brought into the country." It is "indifferently well
watered, even in the dry seasons, with small brooks and springs,
but no great rivers unless it be the wet season." The soil, though
sandy, is "indifferently fertile, and clothed with woods, long
grass, shrubs, plants, etc." The coast North of 25&deg; "abounds with a
great number of fine bays and harbours, sheltered from all
winds."</p>
<p>It was not Cook's way to write with enthusiasm. He said enough
to show that he thought the soil of New South Wales would probably
do "indifferently well" if "planted and cultivated by the hands of
industry." But, as Adam Smith's political economy was based on the
assumption that all men are Scotchmen, so, I am inclined to say,
Cook's commendation of New South Wales as a place for settlement
was based on the assumption that settlers are Ironside farmers from
Scotland or Yorkshire. He certainly did not think of them as
shiploads of convicts.</p>
<p>The voyage of discovery was finished. "On the West side," wrote
Cook, "I can make no new discovery, the honour of which belongs to
the Dutch navigators." He was henceforth in seas that had been
charted by predecessors. He was using the charts published in the
volumes of de Brosses, and found them "tolerable good." He tried
the coast of New Guinea, but, like Torres, was driven off by
everlasting shoals, after "one of the most fortunate escapes we
have ever had from shipwreck." They managed, however, to land on a
part of the coast that is "scarcely known to this day."<sup>*</sup>
They tried to climb some cocoa-nut trees, but failed to do so.
Cook, with remarkable humanity, refused to cut down the trees,
because that would certainly have led to an attack by the natives,
and to undeserved slaughter.</p>
<p class="note">[* Wharton, p. 333.]</p>
<p>He determined to leave the New Guinea coast, and to keep on the
South side of Java; for, as to the North side, "we were all utter
strangers." The ever-suspicious Banks hints that their departure
was due to growing home-sickness. No one in the ship, he declares,
was free from this contemptible disease, except the Captain, Dr.
Solander and himself; "and we three," he explains, "have ample
employment for our minds."</p>
<p>Cook intended to land on Timor Laut, an island which, he
believed, had not been settled by the Dutch. But he missed Timor
Laut, and came to Timor, where, as in Dampier's days, was a strong
Dutch Fort. The sailors wished to call for roast beef, but Cook
refused, fearing the "jealous eye" of the Dutch. More by chance
than by design; he came to the little Dutch island of Savu, and,
when they actually saw before them "a flock of cattle grazing," the
demand for roast beef became irresistible, and even the austere
captain had to consent. The Dutch Factor allowed him to buy
buffaloes&mdash;at an extortionate price. But he complained that
the English were far too inquisitive about spices. And, indeed,
Parkinson the draughtsman afterwards boasted that he had taken
nutmegs and cloves ashore, and had ascertained that the people were
acquainted with them.</p>
<p>Then Cook groped the way to the Straits of Sunda. He complained
that either his Longitude was wrong, or that the Straits were
faultily placed in all the charts. The fact was that his Longitude
was wrong by three degrees; a fact that shows how impossible it was
to determine Longitude even by the highest seamanship of the day,
and makes one marvel once more that so many ships came home. On the
4th of October he was off Java, and got the news of the day, or
rather of the year, from a Dutch ship. It was that "the Government
in England was in the utmost disorder, the people crying up and
down the streets 'Down with King George! King Wilkes for ever!'",
that "the Americans had refused to pay taxes of any kind, and an
English army had been sent to deal with the rebellion." He anchored
at Batavia on the 11th of October.<sup>*</sup> He declared, with an
economy of truth, that he came "from Europe."</p>
<p class="note">[* "Wednesday, 10th, according to our reckoning,
but by the people here Thursday, 11th." He dated the next day
Friday, 12th. See <a href="#lost-day">previous note</a> for the
reason for the discrepancy.<br>
<br>
The <i>red</i> ink with which the <i>dates</i> are marked gradually
grows paler. From 6th October a brilliant dark red ink appears,
drawn, no doubt, from a bottle bought in Batavia.]</p>
<p>It was evident that the <i>Endeavour</i> could not proceed
without thorough examination and thorough repair. Cook found, to
his great annoyance, that it would be necessary to place her in the
hands of the Dutch shipwrights. The ship was shown to be in a
condition far worse than had been supposed. "In one place two and a
half planks near six feet long were within
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch of being cut through; and here the
worms had made their way quite through the timbers, so that it was
a matter of surprise, to everyone who saw her bottom, how we had
kept her above water, and yet in this condition we had sailed some
hundreds of leagues in as dangerous a navigation as in any part of
the world, happy in being ignorant of the continual danger we were
in." In the end Cook gave the Dutch shipwrights a very handsome
testimony;&mdash;"I do not believe there is a marine yard in the
world where work is done with more alertness than here, and where
there are better conveniences for heaving ships down in point of
safety and despatch." The Dutch methods were different from the
English, and better.</p>
<p>In view of the delay, Cook forwarded to the Admiralty by a Dutch
ship copies of his Journal and Charts. He also wrote a letter to
Secretary Stephens that is of singular interest, as giving his own
immediate impression of one of the most famous, most dangerous, and
most fruitful voyages of British History. "Although," he wrote,
"the discoveries made in the voyage are not great, yet I flatter
myself they are such as may merit the attention of their lordships,
and although I have failed in discovering the so much talked of
Southern Continent (which perhaps do not exist), and which I myself
had much at heart, yet I am confident that no part of the failure
of such discovery can be laid to my charge. Had we been so
fortunate not to have run ashore, much more would have been done in
the latter part of the voyage than what was, but, as it is, I
presume this voyage will be found as complete as any before made to
the South Seas on the same account."<sup>*</sup></p>

that Cook first wrote:&mdash;"as great and as compleat, if not more
so, than...," and then made modest Corrections.]</p>

<br>
<b>64. EXTRACT FROM COOK'S LETTER FROM BATAVIA TO THE SECRETARY OF
THE ADMIRALTY,<br>
DATED 23RD OCT. 1770</b></p>
<p>Cook stayed in Batavia from the 11th of October to the 26th of
December. It was a dreadful time. When the Englishmen arrived, they
were; thanks to Cook's system of anti-scorbutics and bathing, in
insolent good health. Not one man had been lost by sickness during
the whole voyage. There was not one sick man on board. The sailors,
rosy and plump, "jeered and flaunted much" at the white-faced Dutch
who came alongside. They were warned of the extreme unwholesomeness
of the place. But they laughed, thinking themselves well-seasoned
to any climate, and "trusting more than all," writes Cook, "to an
invariable temperance in everything, which we had as yet
unalteredly kept during our whole residence in the warm
latitudes";&mdash;a statement which is, no doubt, true in some
sense, but which nevertheless surprises readers who remember the
events of Christmas days, and of other days. But in Batavia trust
in "invariable temperance" was misplaced. Everyone fell sick. The
only exception was the sailmaker, an old man of seventy or
eighty&mdash;ages were vague in those days&mdash;who had been
invariably intemperate;&mdash;"generally more or less drunk every
day." Surgeon Monkhouse died. Tupia died;&mdash;"a shrewd,
sensible, ingenious man," says Cook, "but proud and obstinate,
which often made his situation on board both disagreeable to
himself and to those about him."</p>
<p>Banks was "seized with a tertian, the fits of which," he says,
"were so violent as to deprive me entirely of my senses, and leave
me so weak as scarcely to be able to crawl downstairs." His
servants were as bad as himself, and Solander became ill for the
first time in his life. The two sick botanists bought a Malay woman
apiece, "hoping that the tenderness of the sex would prevail even
here, which, indeed, we found it to do." In charge of their nurses
they went to a country-house, and gradually recovered strength.
But, when the ship sailed, seven had died, forty or more were sick,
and the rest were weakly. Cook said that Batavia was the
unhealthiest place upon the globe.<sup>*</sup> "We came in here
with as healthy a ship's crew as need go to sea, and, after a stay
of not quite three months, left it in the condition of a hospital
ship; and yet all the Dutch captains said we have been very
lucky."</p>
<p class="note">[* "The unwholesome air of Batavia is the death of
more Europeans than any other place upon the globe of the same
extent."]</p>
<p>Banks had not been too ill to use his eyes, and to take notes.
The country reminded him of the flatness of his native
Lincolnshire. The canals made carriage inconceivably cheap, but
also made the air inconceivably unwholesome. He writes enthusiastic
praise of the fertility and wealth of Java. He describes the
elaborate organization of the spice business. Nutmegs, for example,
have been extirpated in all the islands except Banda, "which easily
supplies, the world, and would easily supply another, if the Dutch
had another to supply." He understood, however, that there were
spices in islands away to the East, which the Dutch had not
examined. In a curious and not very pleasing passage, he discusses
the chance of capturing Batavia, and decides that it is a very good
one. The defences are weak; and, of every hundred soldiers who
arrive, at the end of the year, fifty are dead, twenty-five in the
hospital, and not ten in perfect health. Banks evidently thought,
as Bougainville had thought two years before, that it would be well
to claim a share in the spice trade, in the teeth, which were not
very sound teeth, of the Dutch dog in the manger.</p>
<p>The <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Batavia on the 26th of December
in good repair, though "in the condition of a hospital ship:" But
they were out at sea again, and there was no expectation of
tragedy. But the disease was in them, and broken health grew worse.
Disasters came fast, and Cook's Journal for this passage is mainly
a collection of conscientious obituary notices. Corporal Trusslove
died, "a man much esteemed by everybody on board"; then Mr.
Sporing, "a gentleman belonging to Mr. Banks's retinue"; Mr. Sydney
Parkinson, Natural History painter to Mr. Banks, who left, in
addition to his pictures, an interesting Journal; Mr. Green, the
very skilful, industrious, and courageous observer, who had taken a
successful Lunar when a hundred yards distant from almost
inevitable destruction on the Coral Reef, but who had "lived in
such a manner as greatly promoted the disorders he had had long
upon him"; Midshipman Monkhouse who had "fothered" the ship; John
Ravenhill, the aged and much-drinking sailmaker, who perhaps had
not been permitted to be so invariably intemperate on board as he
had been on land. Twenty-three in all died; and those who did not
die were hardly able to tend the sails, and to nurse the sick.
Banks, who had himself "endured the pains of the damned almost,"
was the only stricken man who recovered.</p>
<p>At last the South-East trade-wind brought relief. They came to
Capetown in March 1771, and stayed a month. The Australian, whose
feelings have been a little hurt by Banks's statement that his
country is in every respect the most barren country he had ever
seen, is pleased to find that he thought South Africa more barren
still. "The infinite and, to an European, almost inconceivable
barrenness of the country," he wrote, "makes it necessary that
people should spread themselves very widely"; and Cook wrote
explicitly that no country seen this voyage&mdash;not even New
Holland!&mdash;"afforded so barren a prospect as this, and not only
so in appearance but in reality." The true importance of the Cape,
it was rightly observed, was as the half-way house between Europe
and Asia;&mdash;"the whole town may be considered as one great Inn
fitted up for the reception of all corners and goers." Banks, as
always, has interesting things to say about the ladies. "In
general," he wrote, "they are handsome,...and when married, (no
reflection upon my countrywomen), are the best housekeepers
imaginable, and great child-bearers. Had I been inclined for a
wife, I think this is the place of all others I have seen where I
could have best suited myself." The fact, however, is that, when
Banks was inclined for a wife, he suited himself in England.</p>
<p>They reached St. Helena on the 1st of May, and stayed until the
5th. Banks got an unfavourable impression, and he has a very hard
saying about the English and Dutch as colony-makers:&mdash;"Were
the Cape now in the hands of the English it would be a desert, as
St. Helena in the hands of the Dutch would infallibly become a
paradise." And he declared that the cruelties of the English to
their slaves are both more frequent and more wanton "than ever
their neighbours the Dutch, famed for inhumanity, are guilty
of."</p>
<p>Cook was nearing home. On the 18th of June he got late political
news from New England schooners cruising for whales. King George
had behaved very ill for some time, but the colonists had brought
him to terms at last. Disputes were at an end; "and, to confirm
this, the Master said that the coat on his back was made in Old
England." On the 13th of July Cook anchored in the Downs. "I
flatter myself," he wrote to the Admiralty, "that the discoveries
we have made, though not great, will apologize for the length of
the voyage." Their Lordships replied that they extremely well
approved of the whole of Cook's proceedings. Cook had an hour's
talk with the King, who was also pleased to express his
approbation. The Royal Society also was gratified. Cook had been
well worth his five shillings a day, and the grant of four thousand
pounds had proved more than was needed. The Society generously
voted that the balance which Cook had saved should be expended on a
bust;&mdash;a bust not, of course, of Cook, but of George.</p>
<p>"I have made no very great discoveries," Cook repeats in a
letter to his old employer, Mr. Walker of Whitby, "yet I have
explored more of the South Sea than all that have gone before me;
in so much that little remains now to be done to have a thorough
knowledge of that part of the globe." There is a curiously
apologetic tone in all Cook's estimates of the value of his
discoveries. He had to meet the accusation of geographers like
Dalrymple that he had not discovered their Southern Continent. And
he can only modestly suggest in self-defence that one reason of his
failure is that that continent does not exist. But Banks, at all
events, had no need to apologize. Geographical discoveries might
not be satisfactory to geographers. Long fed on boundless hopes of
Golden Continents, how angrily they spurned the scanty fare of New
Zealand and New Holland! But botanical discoveries had far
surpassed even the great expectations of the botanists. Mr. John
Ellis, F.R.S., who had written to Linnaeus the great news that
Banks and Solander were setting forth, now wrote to him the still
greater news that they had returned;&mdash;returned "laden with the
greatest treasure of natural history that ever was brought into any
country at one time by two persons,"<sup>*</sup> Linnaeus implored
his correspondent to persuade Solander to send him "some specimens
of plants from Banksia in Terra Australis"; for, he added, "the
new-found country ought to be named Banksia from its discoverer, as
America from Americus." The great botanist will see these specimens
as Moses saw Canaan. He has been distressed, and even deprived of
sleep, by the report that Solander intends to set out on a new
voyage before cataloguing what he has brought home:&mdash;this
matchless and truly astonishing collection, such as has never been
seen before, nor may ever be seen again. There were good reasons in
those days to approve the change of name of Stingray to Botany! The
week spent on its sandy shores was to make an epoch in botanical
studies as well as in political geography. It led to the foundation
of Sydney and to the British colonization of Australia. And it
also, wrote a famous botanist of later date, "proved the example
and spur of all that has been done for natural science during half
a century, in Britain, perhaps in every quarter of the
world."<sup>**</sup></p>

<blockquote>I regret that in Australia we have not the material for
a thorough study of Cook's second and third voyages. It seems that,
after his return from the second voyage, Cook himself wrote a
narrative, based on his own Logs and Journals, and on those of
Furneaux, of the scientists, and of other officers. These documents
exist in London, and have been used by Mr. Kitson, but they have
never been printed. What was printed was an <i>edition</i> of
Cook's narrative by the Rev. John Douglas, Canon of Windsor, and
afterwards Bishop of Carlisle. I gather that this deceitful
clergyman also edited the narrative of the third voyage, using the
Logs and Journals as he pleased. "Though," writes Mr. Kitson, "he
does not approach the absurdities of Hawkesworth, he has 'improved'
Cook's manuscript to such an extent in many places that passages
are quite irreconcilable with the original." I regret that I have
had to use this untrustworthy edition.</blockquote>
<p>Cook had not discovered the Southern Continent, but he had not
proved that the Southern Continent did not exist. Somewhere in the
huge vacancy of the <i>Endeavour's</i> zigzag a continent might lie
hidden, rich and large, though not so large as Quiros and Dalrymple
had imagined. Both Cook and Banks had urged another "voyage of
curiosity," to complete the discovery of the South Sea:&mdash;a
voyage which should prove once for all whether a continent did or
did not exist, which should rediscover the forgotten discoveries of
early voyages, connect things new and old, and get material for a
full and exact map of the Pacific.</p>
<p>And there was another motive in mind, about which less was said,
but which was perhaps even more compelling than the "curiosity" of
the Royal Society. French men of science were as curious about the
Pacific as British men of science. Bougainville had successors.
Surville rediscovered New Zealand two months after Cook, and French
and British navigators were on the New Zealand coast at the same
time, though neither, it seems, was aware of the other's
voyage.<sup>*</sup> Bougainville, after entertaining Aotanrou at
Paris for eleven months, put him on board a ship for the Isle of
France, with instructions that he was to be sent to Tahiti in a
ship towards the equipment of which the chivalrous Frenchman had
contributed one third of his whole fortune. The ship was to take
tools, seed, and cattle; and the plan evidently was to form a
French settlement in the beautiful island&mdash;an island
discovered and annexed by Wallis! The French would probably take
Tasman's route, make for New Zealand, and annex also those islands.
Meanwhile in 1771 the French Captain Marion had sailed to the
Pacific to search for the Southern Continent, still identified with
the land of Gonneville. And, in the same year, another French
Captain, Kerguelen, also sailed on the same quest. The British
Government had no hot desire to annex the Pacific, but was
determined that the French should not do so.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* The subject has been studied in the most
complete and exact way by M'Nab, who comes to the conclusion that
"during the next few days Cook and De Surville were within a few
miles of one another, but neither was aware of the other's
presence" (M'Nab's <i>From Tasman to Marsden</i>, pp. 46, 47. Cf.
Forster, vol. i. p. 235, <i>Historical Records of New Zealand</i>,
vol. ii. p. 266, and Kitson, p. 155).]</p>
<p class="note"><a name="easter-island" id="easter-island"></a>[** The Spaniards also regarded the British
intrusion in the Pacific Ocean&mdash;<i>their</i> Ocean!&mdash;with
bitter jealousy. Their feelings are illustrated in a very curious
way in documents which have been edited for the Hakluyt Society by
Mr. C. Corney in <i>The Voyage of Captain Felipe Gonzalez</i>, and
<i>The Quest and Occupation of Tahiti by Missionaries of Spain,
during the years 1772-1776</i>. The Spaniards were thrown into
panic by the news of Byron's voyage. They suspected that the
British were planning <i>settlements</i> in the Falkland Islands,
in the Straits, in Patagonia, in Easter Island, in Tahiti;&mdash;in
defiance of "our exclusive rights of navigation in the Seas of the
Indies!" The British minister replied to the enquiries of the
Spanish ambassador "in a bantering tone." The voyagers, he said,
"had been out looking for giants." "I answered him that, if they
had enquired of me for information concerning these folk, I would
have given it them, and spared them the voyage...He asked me if the
whole world was Spain's: and I replied that, as to that portion,
yes." "Statesmen of Madrid," writes Mr. Corney, "believed that the
alleged scheme of 'el famoso Capit&aacute;n Santiago Cok,' as they were
wont to call him, for observing at Tahiti the transit of Venus, was
merely a pretext for penetrating, in the interests of political
aggrandisement, seas and latitudes over which His Majesty of Spain
claimed exclusive sovereignty." The Spaniards took the matter in
great seriousness; sent ships to scour the seas for British
settlements; rediscovered Easter Island in 1770, named it Carlos
Island, and annexed it: and visited Tahiti in 1772. It was a bitter
story to a patriotic Spaniard:&mdash;"the islands the aforesaid
Wallace (Wallis) claims to have discovered are the same that were
seen in the year 1605 by Quiros."</p>
<p>The head of the Admiralty was Banks's old angling friend, Lord
Sandwich, who had plotted with him to drain the Serpentine in the
interests of scientific knowledge. He easily consented to join in
this larger plot, and&mdash;let us carefully remember what is
perhaps the only good deed that has ever been ascribed to
him&mdash;greatly astonished Cook by coming on board several times
to inspect the ship:&mdash;"a laudable though rare thing in a First
Lord of the Admiralty." It was resolved to send <i>two</i>
ships,&mdash;Cook remembered his experiences among coral reefs too
vividly to be content to sail again with only one&mdash;and the
purpose of the voyage was "to settle whether the unexplored part of
the Southern Hemisphere be only an immense mass of water, or
contain a continent as speculative geography seemed to suggest."
Cook was to command, and Banks was to have passage again at the
head of a scientific "suite." He made preparations with his usual
energy and generosity, and bought five thousand pounds' worth of
goods for use on the voyage. Many of the receipts can still be seen
in a volume of manuscripts, now in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, in
which Banks bound the documents which tell the story of his
industrious preparations. So busy was he in these preparations,
that he was unable to find time to write an account of his voyage
in the <i>Endeavour</i>, and therefore, like Cook, placed his
Journal at the disposal of Dr. Hawkesworth.</p>
<p>But unhappily Banks did not sail. He and Cook had different
opinions in respect to the choice of ships. Cook was a modest man,
but he was also a sensible sea captain, and could stand no
criticism of his ship. If one might believe him, the whole credit
of his discoveries was due to the excellences of the
<i>Endeavour</i>,<sup>*</sup> and he insisted that the new voyage
must be sailed in a ship of the same type. The <i>Endeavour</i>
happened to be away from England; but the Navy Board, taking Cook's
advice, bought two ships built on the same lines by the same Whitby
builder. The <i>Resolution</i> was of 462 tons, the
<i>Adventure</i> of 336. They were fourteen or fifteen months old,
and as well adapted to the intended service, says Cook, as if built
for the purpose.</p>
<p class="note">[* "It was the <i>Endeavour</i> that enabled us to
prosecute discoveries in those seas so much longer than any ship
ever did or could do,...to traverse a far greater space of sea till
then unnavigated, to discover greater tracks of country in high and
low South Latitudes, and to persevere longer in exploring and
surveying more correctly the extensive coasts of those new
discovered countries than any former navigator had done during one
voyage."]</p>
<p>But Banks took a different view. While Cook's first thought was
of navigation, Banks's first thought was of Science. About matters
of personal comfort he was indifferent. Six feet square was enough
for himself, and, whether the Sources of the Nile or the South Pole
were to be visited, he was equally ready to embark.<sup>*</sup> But
the ship on which he sailed must have accommodation for the needs
of his men of science&mdash;even on the <i>Endeavour</i>, he
complained, "my business was imperfectly done"&mdash;and he had
recommended the use of a large East Indiaman. Finding Cook's ship
"very improper for our purpose," he made protest to his friend Lord
Sandwich, who accordingly ordered drastic changes. The result of
the well-meaning attempt to please both Cook and Banks was that the
ship, in the judgment of the former, was made so "crank" that "she
could not put to sea." And Cook</p>
<p>got his own way, even when matched against Banks and Sandwich.
The new structures were removed, and Cook again declared that the
ship was the most proper ship for the service he had ever seen.
Towards the close of his life Banks told the story of his defeat in
words which showed that the injury still rankled. He was, he says,
"again offered the alternative to go or let it alone, with a good
deal of coolness." He had inadvertently allowed the Navy Board to
see his Journal; and, knowing his ideas, they thought that they
could do without his assistance. "As the alternative they had made
rendered it impossible for my people to be lodged, or to do their
respective duties, I resolved to refuse to go."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Manuscript letter in the Mitchell Library,
Sydney.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Smith's Banks, p. 26 note.]</p>
<p>One must regret that Banks did not sail in this famous voyage.
The two Forsters, who took his place, were competent men of
science, and the younger Forster wrote a book which Besant calls "a
very good book indeed." But they were doleful and querulous
comrades. In the story of the second voyage one misses the radiancy
of the human boy, and no doubt Cook missed it too. And still more
must one regret the "coolness" between old comrades in adventure
and in research. Fortunately, the letter which gives evidence of
the "coolness" gives evidence also that warmth soon returned. "Dear
Sir," wrote Cook to Banks from Capetown in November 1772, "some
cross circumstances which happened at the latter part of the
equipment of the <i>Resolution</i> created, I have reason to think,
a coolness between you and me. But I can by no means think it was
sufficient to me to break off a correspondence with a man I am
under many obligations to." And he wrote a simple newsy letter,
admirably calculated to restore an easy and friendly intercourse.
When he returned from the voyage, he visited Solander, and sent his
curiosities to him at the British Museum. "Captain Cook," wrote
Solander to Banks, "desires his best compliments to you; he
expressed himself in the most friendly manner towards you that
could be; he said 'Nothing could have added to the satisfaction he
has had in making this tour, but having had your
company.'"<sup>*</sup> The hot-tempered generous Banks knew Cook
too well to make a "coolness" into a quarrel. When Cook returned,
the Royal Society awarded him the Prize Medal of the year. "I am
obliged," he wrote to Banks, "to you and my other good friends for
this unmerited honour." In 1784 Banks himself was President of the
Royal Society, and he wrote a letter to Mrs. Cook requesting her to
accept from the Fellows of the Society "a medal in gold struck in
honour of your late husband." "As his friend, I rejoin to yours my
sincere regret for the loss this nation has suffered in the death
of so valuable a man, and that which the Royal Society feels in so
valuable a member." The words were formal, but they would have
satisfied Cook, and he would have liked the word "friend."</p>
<p class="note">[* Hooker, p. xxviii.]</p>
<p>The two ships sailed in June 1772. Cook commanded the
<i>Resolution</i>. The Captain of the <i>Adventure</i> was
Furneaux, who had sailed under Wallis in the <i>Dolphin</i>. In
November they left the Cape, and plunged South in search of the
land which Bouvet had believed to be a promontory of the Southern
Continent, and had called Cape Circumcision. There followed the
first chapter in the story of Antarctic exploration. Hilly islands
of ice two miles in circuit came into sight, and were sometimes
mistaken for land; "a view that for a few minutes was pleasing to
the eye, but, when we reflected on the danger, the mind was filled
with horror; were a ship to get against the weather side of one of
those islands when the sea runs high, she would be dashed to pieces
in a moment." The ice-islands threatened to close in upon them, and
"pack them"; and a man who had been in the Greenland trade told how
they had been "packed" for six or nine weeks. Then there appeared
"an immense field of low ice," to which they could see no end. They
tried to round it, but again and again found themselves "quite
embayed." They sailed through broken ice that reminded Cook of the
Coral Islands of the Tropical Pacific. With admirable persistence
he fought his way South to 67&deg;. Enderby Land lay a little to the
East, but Cook could see nothing but the ice-barrier, which
stretched without the least appearance of an opening. He grew
sceptical as to the argument that ice means land, and, as to birds,
they were deceivers ever. He concluded that Bouvet had seen
mountains of ice.</p>
<p>Sailing North, Cook looked in vain for the islands that had
recently been discovered by the French navigators Marion and
Kerguelen, and reported by them to be either near to or a part of
the Southern Continent. He lost sight of the <i>Adventure</i>, and
rightly supposed that Furneaux would visit Van Diemen's Land on the
way to New Zealand. Again Cook went South. He saw deceitful birds
and more deceitful clouds, and icebergs of appearance so "romantic"
that they "could only be described by the hand of an able painter."
Icebergs were handy when you wanted water,<sup>*</sup> but Cook was
dismayed by the awful danger of being surrounded by them at night.
Long hollow swells proved that, if there was land to the South, it
must be at a great distance. They were in Latitude 58&deg;, and the
cold was far more intense that the cold in the same Latitude of the
North. Winter was approaching, and in March 1773 Cook resolved to
sail for the rendezvous in New Zealand, in order to seek the
<i>Adventure</i>, and to obtain refreshment. He had "some thoughts,
and even a desire, to visit the East coast of Van Diemen's Land,"
in order to satisfy himself if it joined the coast of New South
Wales. But the winds were unfavourable, and he made straight for
New Zealand.</p>
<p class="note">[* According to Forster, they discovered the fact
"that nature forms great masses of ice in the midst of the wide
ocean, which are destitute of any saline particles, but have all
the useful and salubrious qualities pf the pure element."]</p>
<p>At the end of. March 1773 he came to Dusky Bay in the South-West
corner of the South island. He had observed and named the Bay on
his first voyage. He found, as he had expected, good anchorage, and
resolved to examine the Southern end of the island. Today one may
see the stumps of the great rimu-trees which Cook's men cut down,
covered with creepers and surrounded by the new jungle. They used
the trees to brew a beer which Cook praised highly; but he was
thinking of medicine rather than of drink, and his taste in liquor
was probably utilitarian. They explored the neighbouring coves,
"every place affording something, especially to us to whom nothing
came amiss." Some climbed the mountains, but could see nothing
inland but more "barren mountains with huge craggy precipices
frightful to behold." They shot ducks in Duck Creek, landed geese
in Geese Cove, and lunched in Luncheon Cove. For half an hour they
had "chit-chat" with two native women, and the sailors made the
laborious joke that "women did not want tongue in any part of the
world." "Her volubility of tongue," says Cook of one of them,
"exceeded every thing I have ever met with." Nevertheless, he
summed up strongly in favour of Dusky Bay, not only as a place of
refreshment, but also as a possible centre of British commerce; and
"although," he wrote, "this country be far remote from the present
trading parts of the world, we can by on means tell what use future
ages may make of the discovery." He praised especially the
magnificent timber, which was "large enough to make mainmast for a
fifty-gun ship."</p>
<p>Thence Cook sailed to the rendezvous in Queen Charlotte Sound,
where, on the 11th of May, he found the <i>Adventure</i>. Furneaux
had anchored there six weeks before. After losing sight of the
<i>Resolution</i> on the 7th of February, he had sailed for Van
Diemen's Land. He had seen land on the 9th of March, and had found
the soil "very rich." He thought he was on Tasman's South Cape. In
reality he was on the South-West Cape. He sailed Eastward
identifying the headlands with those named by Tasman, and
identifying them all wrongly.<sup>*</sup> Owing to his initial
mistake he always imagined that he was further to the East than was
the case. He anchored in Adventure Bay in Bruny Island and thought
that he was in Tasman's Frederick Henry Bay on the East coast.
Later he realised that Frederick Henry Bay was further North, but
he never realised that it was also further East. That is the reason
why on the modern map that Bay is on the West side of Tasman's
peninsula, and not, where Tasman put it, on the East. When he
rounded Cape Pillar he thought he was rounding Maria Island. He
intended to sail North till he came to Point Hicks, the first point
seen by Cook on the East coast of New Holland. By so doing, he
would finally settle the question, left undetermined by Cook,
whether New Holland and Van Diemen's Land were or were not one
land. He sailed as far North as the islands now called Furneaux
Islands, but the wind was unfavourable to further progress. So he
sailed for New Zealand, recording his opinion that "there is no
strait between New Holland and Van Diemen's Land, but a very deep
bay." Bayley the astronomer, however, thought it very "evident that
this is the mouth of a strait which separates New Holland from Van
Diemen's Land."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Cf. Walker's <i>Early Tasmania</i>, p. 137. See
Illustrations <a href="#il-47">47</a> and <a href=
"#il-48">48</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** M'Nab's <i>Historical Records of New
Zealand</i>, vol. ii. p. 200.]</p>
<p>Cook himself had wished to visit Van Diemen's Land to determine
this question. But he considered that Furneaux had "in great
measure cleared up that point," and that he had no business there.
On the 7th of June he sailed Eastward to see whether a continent
was to be found between 40&deg; and 46&deg;. He calls attention to the
date, and claims that this voyage will show that "it is practicable
to go on discoveries even in the depth of winter." The search was
fruitless, and Cook became confirmed in the opinion that "there is
no Southern Continent between America and New Zealand." The "large
hollow swell" proved that no land was near. If a Southern Continent
existed, it existed in a very high Latitude, and, could only be
discovered in a midsummer voyage.</p>
<p>So Cook sailed North to Tahiti, and arrived there in August. He
was welcomed in that loving island with a warmth of affection that
touched emotion. A venerable old lady could not look upon him
without tears, and Cook found it almost impossible to refrain
"mingling my tears with hers." When they sailed, Furneaux took with
him a native named Omai as a present for Banks, who "kept him as an
object of curiosity, to observe the workings of an untutored
mind."<sup>*</sup> Lord Sandwich introduced him to the King, and
the workings of the untutored mind led him to exclaim, "How do,
King Tosh? "</p>
<p class="note">[* Smith's <i>Banks</i>, p. 42.]</p>
<p>In September Cook sailed West, discovered the Harvey Islands,
and rediscovered the islands of Amsterdam and Middleburg, which
Tasman had discovered one hundred and thirty years before. Cook
called them the "Friendly Islands." In November he was again in
Queen Charlotte's Sound, but the <i>Adventure</i> did not arrive,
and her story henceforth is apart from that of the
<i>Resolution</i>. Cook renewed his study of the Maori character,
which greatly interested him. The Maoris brought a broiled head
aboard, and ate it in the presence of the Englishmen. Cook was
horrified, but "curiosity got the better of indignation," and he
ordered a piece of flesh to be broiled. His estimate of the Maori
character shows how science was teaching men to understand rather
than to condemn. He sees clearly that the Maoris, in spite of
ancient and unpleasing habits, had reached "some state of
civilisation." "Few," he writes, "consider what a savage man is in
his natural state...The New Zealanders are certainly in some state
of civilisation; their behaviour to us was manly and mild; they
have some arts; are less addicted to theft than other islanders;
are honest among themselves; their cannibalism is an ancient
custom; they eat their enemies as their enemies would eat them."
They are, in short, not wicked heathen, but old-fashioned and
slow-learning Tories.</p>
<p>In November Cook buried a bottle containing information for
Furneaux, and sailed to make thorough exploration of the huge
region of the South-East Pacific, where, if anywhere, the unknown
continent must exist. He plunged South-East, and touched the Arctic
circle; then back North, till he approached his earlier tracks;
then South once more to a point even further South than those
reached before. The cold became so intense that it could hardly be
endured. The ice-barrier seemed impassable. Cook counted "97
ice-hills within the field, looking like a ridge of mountains
rising one above another till they were lost in the clouds." "Such
<i>mountains</i> of ice," he thought, "never were seen in the
Greenland seas." Petrels seemed to show there must be land further
South, but it was impossible to sail further, and Cook thought that
question would perhaps never be determined. "I will not say," he
wrote with his usual carefulness, "it was <i>impossible</i> to get
further South; but the attempting it would have been a dangerous
and rash enterprise. It was my opinion that this ice extended quite
to the Pole, and perhaps joined to some land to which it had been
fixed from earliest time. I think there must be some land behind
this ice...Yet I, who had ambition not only to go further than
anyone had been before, but as far as it was possible for man to
go, was not sorry at meeting this interruption." He was certain
that "no continent was to be found in this ocean but what must lie
so far to the South as to be wholly inaccessible on account of the
ice."</p>
<p>Cook had now accomplished the main task. He had finally
destroyed the theory that a Southern Continent extended into warm
and temperate regions. The problem for the future was not the
search for "Terra Australis," but "the siege of the South Pole,"
and that problem Cook willingly bequeathed to those who might think
the game worth the candle.</p>
<p>But, though Cook felt no interest in the South Pole, he felt
deep interest in the Pacific. Here much remained unknown that was
knowable, and well worth knowing. "There remained room for very
large islands in places wholly unexamined." And there also remained
fascinating problems bequeathed by old navigators; islands which
they had discovered, and which no one had seen for centuries, must
now be rediscovered, and must be explained in relation to things
known. A true map of the Pacific must be constructed, that would
enable men to understand the story of two hundred years of
exploration.</p>
<p>Cook therefore sailed North. He sought for the continent that
had been seen by Juan Fernandez in the late sixteenth century, and
he concluded that it could be "nothing but a small island." He saw
plenty of birds; "but I do not believe," he wrote, with something
like temper, "there is one in the whole tribe that can be relied on
in pointing out the vicinity of land." In March 1774 he
rediscovered Roggeveen's "Easter Island,"<sup>*</sup> and wrote an
account of the big statues which seem to suggest a clue, not yet
fully understood, to the problem of Pacific
civilisation.<sup>**</sup> For the present, Cook pointed to the
extraordinary fact that "the same nations have spread themselves
over all the isles in this vast Ocean from New Zealand to this
island, one quarter the circumference of the globe."</p>
<p class="note">[* The Spaniards had rediscovered it before him in
1770, and had annexed it. See <a href="#easter-island">earlier
note</a>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See Mrs. Routledge's <i>Easter Island</i>.]</p>
<p>In the same month, March 1774, Cook rediscovered the Marquesas,
islands unvisited since Menda&ntilde;a and Quiros discovered them in 1595.
He determined their exact situation, and thus obtained a clue to
the geography of Menda&ntilde;a's voyage. The change of civilisation was
illustrated by the change of name. The Port Madre de Dios of Quiros
became Cook's Resolution Bay. The natives of the Marquesas, he
wrote, are "without exception the finest race of people in this
sea"; a statement which makes the more sad R. L. Stevenson's sad
description in 1888.</p>
<p>In April he was in Tahiti again, where he witnessed a grand
naval review of one hundred and fifty large double canoes, each
containing forty men. Once more he was plagued by the one fault of
his friends; and he discusses, with admirable understanding and
charity, the question how one may best deal with good-natured and
even affectionate kleptomaniacs. He called at his old haunts in the
Society Islands, and was everywhere received with affection, which
he returned in a way so warm that one gets an insight into a
sometimes unsuspected element in his austere and reticent
character. He describes one chieftain as "a good man in the utmost
sense of the word." Another friend asked him to come back again;
and, when he found this could not be, "he asked," says Cook, "the
name of my Marai or burying place. I told him Stepney, the parish
in which I live when in London, and they shouted 'Stepney Marai no
Toote.'"</p>
<p>Then he sailed again to the Friendly Islands, and thence sailed
on to learn the truth about Quiros's Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.
Bougainville, we remember, had rediscovered the land of Quiros in
1768, and had proved that it was no continent, but a group of
Islands, which he named the Great Cyclades. Cook now explored them
with far greater thoroughness, and thought himself justified in
giving them a Scotch name,&mdash;"the New Hebrides."<sup>*</sup> He
noticed how easily Quiros had misunderstood the geography of the
discovery. "It was not without reason," he wrote, that Quiros
thought the land to be "part of the Southern Continent, which at
that time, and till very lately, was supposed to exist." Cook
himself, like Quiros, saw "land further than the eye could
reach."</p>
<p class="note">[* "The Hebrides," explains Forster (vol. ii. p.
366), "are the westernmost islands of Great Britain."]</p>
<p>In interesting detail, Cook traced the geography of the story of
1606. He visited a Bay which, he was perfectly sure, was the Bay of
St. Philip and St. James;&mdash;the Bay in which Quiros had founded
the City of New Jerusalem which was never built. "I found the
general points to agree so well with Quiros's description, that I
had not the least doubt about it." He recognised the long deep
harbour, and the passage up it gave him almost as much trouble as
it had given Quiros that stormy night when he sought in vain to
anchor. The whole topography of the place fitted the story which
Quiros had told; the very deep water two cables from the beach, the
freshwater stream so large and deep that boats could enter it at
high tide, the luxuriant vegetation, the sides of the hills
chequered with plantations, and every valley watered by a stream.
Even the poisonous fish were there, and they poisoned Cook's men as
one hundred and sixty years before their ancestors had poisoned the
men of Quiros.<sup>*</sup> Cook thought the evidence sufficient,
and he called the Eastern point of the Bay, Cape Quiros. (August
1774.)</p>
<p class="note">[* Cook's men were poisoned by fish eaten in the
island of Ambrym; but Forster recognised them as "of the same
species" as those which had poisoned the Spaniards in the Bay of
St. Philip and St. James. The Spanish <i>pagrus</i> is the red
sea-bream (<i>sparus erythrinus</i>). Forster, vol. ii. pp. 237 and
244.]</p>
<p><a name="new-caledonia" id="new-caledonia"></a>Sailing
Southward, he discovered (4th September) a large island which he
called New Caledonia; he was in Scotch mood during this period of
the voyage. He does not explain why he gave the name to this
island, but we are to gather a hint from his statement that the
inhabitants "had little else than good nature to bestow, in which
they exceed all the nations we have yet met with."<sup>*</sup> The
country seemed to be barren, and to resemble New Holland in the
same Latitude. In fact he thought it possible that New Caledonia
might be connected with New Holland by isles and sandbanks; but he
heard later that the Frenchman Surville had proved that this was
not the case. In spite of the barrenness of the island, it grew
good timber;&mdash;a noteworthy fact, for Cook knew no island in
the South Pacific, except New Zealand, where a ship could supply
herself with masts and yards.</p>
<p class="note">[* Forster (vol. ii. p. 378) explains: "The whole
land, appearing to be very extensive, was honoured with the
appellation of <i>Nova Caledonia</i>." He adds (p. 406) that the
name "suited not only the good disposition of the people, but also
with the nature of the country."]</p>
<p>Still sailing South, Cook discovered the tiny island which he
named "Norfolk Island," "in honour of the noble house of Howard";
and he wrote a description which had the result of linking its
history in sinister way with the convict colony in New South Wales.
"If it had been of a greater size," wrote Forster, "it would have
been unexceptionable for a European settlement."</p>
<p>In October he was once more in Queen Charlotte Sound. He
gathered from the natives, who welcomed him by "jumping and
skipping about like madmen," that the <i>Adventure</i> had come in
soon after the departure of the <i>Resolution</i>. He also heard a
story about the massacre of a boatful of Englishmen, but could make
little of it. He retained his kindly view of the Maori character;
"notwithstanding they are cannibals," he remarks quaintly and
truthfully, "they are naturally of a good disposition, and have not
a little humanity." Even later, when news of the massacre of the
<i>Adventure's</i> men had been followed by news of the massacre of
Captain Marion and his Frenchmen, Cook, after mentioning the facts,
could add: "nevertheless I think them a good sort of people; at
least I, have always found good treatment from them." Surely never
was man better able than Cook to distinguish between essential and
irremediable bad nature and a troublesome but passing phase of
Toryism in a noble character.</p>
<p>He left New Zealand in November 1774, and now made the voyage
thence to Cape Horn, which he had desired to make in the
<i>Endeavour</i> in 1770. "I have now done with the South Pacific,"
he wrote, "and flatter myself that no one will think I have left it
unexplored, or that more could have been done." Passing Cape Horn,
he sought to explore the "extensive coast" laid down by Dalrymple
in the South Atlantic. He discovered only an island&mdash;which had
been discovered two and a half centuries before by Amerigo
Vespucci<sup>*</sup>&mdash;and named it South Georgia. It was
midsummer, and the island was no further South than 54&deg; or 55&deg;, yet
it was wholly covered with snow;&mdash;a fact that made Cook
reflect that perhaps after all he had been mistaken about Bouvet's
Cape of Circumcision. Cook's thought, when he failed to discover
that cape, had been that Bouvet had seen an iceberg, and had
imagined it to be an island. In view of snow-covered South Georgia,
Cook now thought that perhaps Bouvet had discovered an island, and
that he (Cook) had imagined the island to be an iceberg. If one
looks at a modern photograph of Bouvet Island, one realizes that
Cook's second thought was likely enough to be true; the island,
even at photographic distance, looks more like an
iceberg.<sup>**</sup> Cook, therefore, would have liked to search
once more for "Cape Circumscission"; but the ship needed repair,
and the men needed refreshment; so he at last consented to steer
for the Cape, where he arrived in March 1775. He found that
Furneaux had brought the <i>Adventure</i> to the Cape twelve months
before, and had given an account of the massacre of a boat's crew,
which explained the story Cook had heard in New Zealand. He
anchored at Spithead on the 30th of July, 1775, after an absence of
three years and eighteen days.</p>
<p class="note">[* See Fiske's <i>Discovery of America</i>, vol.
ii. p. 104.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Mills' <i>Siege of the South Pole</i>,
p.40.4.]</p>
<p>The main object of the voyage had been to determine whether
there was or was not a Southern Continent that extended from the
South Pole into temperate and tropical regions. Cook had proved
that such a continent did not exist. "A final end had been put,"
thus justly he summed things up, "to the searching after a Southern
Continent, for near two centuries a favourite theory among the
geographers of all ages." He believed, nevertheless, that a
Southern Continent existed, and he thought it probable that he had
actually seen it. Its neighbourhood seemed to be indicated by the
excessive cold, and by the ice-islands. But the Southern lands that
had actually been discovered&mdash;he refers apparently to South
Georgia&mdash;were "lands doomed by nature to perpetual
frigidness,...whose horrible and savage aspect," he wrote, "I have
not words to describe." How much more horrible and savage must be
the unknown continent of the still further South! "If any one
should have resolution and perseverance to clear up this point by
proceeding further than I have done, I shall not envy him the
honour of the discovery; but I will be bold to say that the world
will not be benefited by it."</p>
<p>Cook has a somewhat chilly way of insisting on the negative
importance of his voyage. In the history of exploration, he is the
apostle of the victorious common sense of his period, more anxious
to brush away cobwebs than to stir men to new enthusiasms. He seems
to take greater pleasure in the destruction of mistakes than in the
discovery of truth. Yet it was a voyage of amazing fruitfulness. He
had proved that the Southern Continent of the theorists did not
exist; but he had also made it very probable that an Antarctic
Continent did exist. He was the last seeker of the continent, which
Mercator had drawn, and which Quiros had described. But he was also
the first scientific explorer of the South Polar Regions, the
precursor of Weddell and Ross, of Shackleton, Amundsen, and Scott.
And, moreover, the work he had done by the way, the work of
exploration in the temperate and tropical regions of the South
Pacific, was of very great value. North, South, East, and West,
Cook had voyaged through the immense ocean, with searchlight and
measuring-rod, discovering islands, rediscovering the discoveries
of earlier days, bringing into existence a map of the Pacific
which, while much remained to be filled in, was at least correct in
its outlines and conceptions. When the polite French navigator
Lap&eacute;rouse complained that Cook had left nothing for his successors
to do but to praise him, the compliment was sincere, and, in the
sense in which the words were spoken, it was true.</p>
<p>"Cook," wrote Lap&eacute;rouse, "will always appear to me the greatest
of navigators, the true Columbus of this country."<sup>*</sup> Cook
made no such claim, and probably he would have willingly consented
to the claim which Quiros had made to that title. <i>His</i> claim
was only that he had done his "duty." He made, however, one modest
boast. In a voyage of over three years only four men had died. Of
the four only one had died of sickness, and his sickness had not
been scurvy. Cook had not discovered the Southern Continent, but he
had discovered something far more valuable. He had discovered that
by the use of anti-scorbutics, by careful airing of the ship, by
scrupulous attention to cleanliness, a very long voyage might be
made through all variations of climates without injury to health.
And he believed that this discovery would "make the voyage
remarkable when disputes about a Southern Continent shall have
ceased to engage attention." And the men of science agreed with
him. In February 1776 Cook was elected member of the Royal Society,
and he wrote a paper in explanation of the means he had used for
the prevention and cure of scurvy. The Society awarded to him the
Copley gold medal for the best paper contributed during the year.
"If Rome," said the President, "decreed the Civic Crown to him who
saved the life of a single citizen, what wreaths are due to that
man, who, having himself saved many, perpetuates in your
Transactions the means by which Britain may now, on the most
distant voyages, preserve numbers of her intrepid sons, her
mariners?"</p>
<p class="note">[* Lap&eacute;rouse was writing especially of the Sandwich
Islands.]</p>
<p>In August 1775 Cook, now at the height of fame, was appointed
Fourth Captain of His Majesty's Royal Hospital for Seamen at
Greenwich. His salary was &pound;200 a year, with a residence, fire and
light, and one shilling and twopence a day table-money. And yet,
with all this mass of wealth, he was not happy! "The
<i>Resolution</i>," he wrote to his old friend, Mr. Walker of
Whitby, "was found to answer even beyond my expectation, and is so
little injured by the voyage that she will be soon sent out again.
But I shall not command her. My fate drives me from one extreme to
another; a few months ago the whole Southern Hemisphere was hardly
big enough for me, and now I am going to be confined within the
limits of Greenwich Hospital, which are far too small for an active
mind like mine. I must confess it is a fine retreat, and a pretty
income, but whether I can bring myself to like ease and retirement,
time will show."</p>
<p>Time soon showed. In February 1776 he offered to command the old
ship, and his offer was accepted. He was happy as a lover. "I have
quitted," he wrote to Mr. Walker, "an easy retirement, for an
active, perhaps dangerous, voyage...I embark on as fair a prospect
as I can wish." The second ship, the <i>Discovery</i>, sailed under
Clerke, most charming of Cook's men, who had served him both in the
<i>Endeavour</i> and in the Resolution.</p>
<p>Cook's third voyage is in the main off the track of our story.
It was a voyage in the <i>North</i> Pacific. Its object was to find
a Northern passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic; and the chief
work accomplished was the discovery of the Sandwich Islands&mdash;a
discovery which Cook regarded as "the most important that had
hitherto been made by Europeans throughout the extent of the
Pacific Ocean"&mdash;and the exploration of the West Coast of North
America from Oregon to the extreme North-West point of the
continent. Only the introductory part of the voyage comes within
our view.</p>
<p>Cook sailed in July 1776. He called at the Cape, and when the
<i>Resolution</i> left, "she was so stocked with animals that she
resembled Noah's Ark." Compared as a sea-craft with Noah's Ark,
however, she was in a bad way. "If I return in the
<i>Resolution</i>," wrote Cook to Banks, "the next trip I may
venture in a ship built of gingerbread." He passed the barren
islands discovered by his French rival, Marion, and called at the
barren island discovered by his other French rival, Kerguelen. In
January 1777 he came to Adventure Bay in Van Diemen's Land, and
repeated Furneaux's mistakes in his endeavours to identify Tasman's
landmarks. He described Tasmanian timber as "tough, straight,
suitable for spars, or even masts, if any means could be found to
lighten it." The natives, he thought, had "less genius than even
the half animated inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego." Unluckily, he
did not think it worth while to sail Northward to Point Hicks to
test Furneaux's opinion that Van Diemen's Land and New Holland are
one land.</p>
<p>In February he was once more in Queen Charlotte Sound. The
Maoris gave an account of the massacre of Furneaux's men, and he
concluded that it would be neither just nor wise to seek vengeance.
With all their Tory faults he loved them still. Yet he saw the
faults clearly enough. The people of each hamlet by turn applied to
him to destroy the others. "They must live," he explains, "under a
perpetual apprehension of being destroyed by each other; the desire
of a good meal may be no small incitement; war is their principal
occupation." Their articles of commerce, he adds, are "curiosities,
fish, and women."</p>
<p>He left New Zealand in the same month, visited the Hervey or
Scott Islands, and spent two or three months in the Friendly
Islands;&mdash;"future navigators," he writes, "may behold these
meadows stocked with cattle brought by the ships of England." Once
more he discusses with understanding and with charity the
psychology of the innocent kleptomaniac; "great allowance should be
made for the foibles of these poor natives of the Pacific, whose
minds are overpowered with the glare of objects equally new and
captivating." A flogging made no more impression on them than it
would have made on the mainmast. But Clerke thought of a punishment
that proved wonderfully effective; he shaved their heads. In August
they came to Tahiti, and Ornai, the native whom Furneaux had taken
to England, was restored to his fatherland. In November Cook sailed
Northward, and passed out of our story of the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The sense of Cook's greatness grows in the student's mind. He
does not storm our admiration as, for example, does Drake or Wolfe.
There is a certain quietness and reticence in his life, as in his
conversation, and as in his writings. He was, we are told, a good
talker, yet none of his talk has lived. He wrote accounts of his
own voyages in admirable English, but his object was to get the
story told, and, as we read, we think rather of the story than of
the man. In no one moment does Cook shine forth the evident hero.
His character in some way reminds one of that of his greatest
contemporary, George Washington&mdash;he who won a great war
without winning a battle. His greatness appears as we think, not of
one moment, but of the whole life. Heroism was so wrought into the
texture of character, that he tells a heroic story in a way that
makes one imagine it a matter-of-course affair. We think that the
story lacks interest, when the fact is that it lacks egotism. Cook
solves the riddle of the Pacific, and he tells you that he has done
his duty, and has made "a complete voyage." We have to find for
ourselves that none but Cook could have done this duty, or could
have completed this voyage; that the reason of victory was
greatness of mind, of will, and of spirit.</p>
<p>Cook possessed a marvellous combination of qualities. His
physique was splendid; he could do anything, endure anything, eat
anything, and digest almost anything;<sup>*</sup> he was only once
seriously ill, and was then cured by eating the ship's dog in the
way of soup. His activity of mind, both in speculation and in
affairs was amazing. He had the full scientific temperament, alike
enthusiastic&mdash;though he would have hated the word&mdash;and
sceptical; eager to know, and to know nought save the truth. And he
had wonderful judgment in the drawing of inferences, and in the
balancing of argument. His eye for scientific problems was as keen
as that of a professional student. He observed, for example, the
curious problem of the precise relation of the peoples of New
Holland and of New Guinea, and he discussed, a century before
Darwin, the probable origin and growth of the coral islands.</p>
<p class="note">[* His only failure was with poisonous fish in New
Caledonia, which made him exceedingly ill, and exceedingly angry.
Next time one was caught, "he ordered it to be cleaned and boiled,
in spite of the earnest representations of all his messmatcs, who
warned him against its pernicious effects. It was at last set
before him, by his positive orders, and his friends found no other
means to save him than to ridicule his mad design. Their humorous
and satirical remarks had a better effect than friendly
admonitions, and he desisted from the attempt" (Forster, ii. pp.
403 and 439).]</p>
<p>And he applied the same vigour of mind to the solution of
practical questions. In the story of exploration he is the great
organiser of victories. His was the policy of thorough. He first
thought out in full and exact ways all the matters of necessary
detail:&mdash;the choice of ships, the instruments of navigation,
the methods of coastal survey, and, above all, the means of
preserving health. And, having thought things out, he got things
done. He not only did things himself, he persuaded others to do
them. He was a Scotchman's son, and therefore a philosopher. Very
remarkable are his quiet studies of psychology:&mdash;the
psychology, for example, of affectionate South Sea island thieves,
and of drinking, cursing, courageous, faithful British seamen. He
understood them, and he knew how to persuade them to do what he
wanted them to do, or as much of it as it was in any way possible
that they should do; for, like Burke, he believed that a large part
of wisdom is to know how much of the corruption of human nature it
is wise to tolerate.</p>
<p>And dominant in the centre of things was character. Those who
sailed with him said that his nature was very passionate. There are
facts that illustrate this judgment; and on his last voyage he was
guilty of actions which one would like to forget. But the witness
who records these actions was himself amazed by them;&mdash;amazed,
because they stood in inexplicable contrast to his usual conduct.
In general, he ruled his passions with such apparent ease that one
is tempted to wish that he had been a trifle less virtuous. British
seamen in those days were still famous for what Mr. Forster, one of
the scientific gentlemen on the <i>Resolution</i>, called the
dreadful "energy of their language." Yet I do not remember that
Cook ever used a phrase above the average. And he had his
opportunities. What, for example, did he say when he found that the
islanders had stolen his stockings from under his head while he was
wide awake? The carnal man would like to know, but there is
silence. We look eagerly into his virtuous life for some small
redeeming vice. "Temperance in him," wrote Captain King, who sailed
in the last voyage, "was scarcely a virtue; so great was the
indifference with which he submitted to every kind of self-denial."
Surgeon Samwell quarrels with this statement. Cook, he says "had no
repugnance to good living; he always kept a good table, though he
could bear the reverse without murmuring"; a statement which makes
his virtue exceed the measure attributed by King. His "austerity"
was due, not to lack of capacity for pleasure, but to perfection of
moral self-control.</p>
<p>Cook, to use Cromwell's phrase, was a man of a spirit, and his
spirit was the spirit of the gentlem&agrave;n. In his intercourse with men
of high rank and great wealth, he was always courteous, always
dignified, not claiming equality but assuming it. He was their
equal and more than their equal, not because he was a great British
navigator, but because he was a British gentleman. And he was a
farmer's son, self-educated and self-made, and his pay when he
named Port Jackson was five shillings a day. As a child cannot be
too careful in choosing his grandfather, so a country cannot be too
careful in choosing its discoverer; and a country with the ideals
of New South Wales could have made no more happy choice.</p>

<p>The voyages of Cook are the triumph of our story. The hero has
arrived, has done his work, and has ta'en his wages.<sup>*</sup> We
expect the interest of discovery to dwindle. The big facts have
been determined. The exploration of detail is a smaller business,
and affords smaller scope for heroic venture. So we think as we
close the last volume of Cook's Voyages. Yet many great things
remained to be done, and the doing of these things called forth the
energies of men of charming character and of heroic build. In fact
there is no chapter in our story more rich in personality than the
chapter which tells of the successors of Cook.</p>
<p class="note">[* "He strives as an athlete all his life long, and
then, when he has come to the end of his striving, he has what is
meet." Plutarch, quoted in Gladstone's Diary. Morley, vol. iii. p.
87.]</p>
<p>Cook was the destroyer of the Southern continent. But while he
destroyed he also discovered:&mdash;he discovered, in addition to
small islands, the three great lands of the South. He first
reconnoitred and roughly defined the outline of the Antarctic
Continent, destined, in spite of Cook's discouraging remarks, to be
besieged and stormed by heroes "dear to God and famous to all
ages." He first called New Zealand into existence, with strong
recommendation of its merits to those who thought of settlement. He
first surveyed the Eastern coast of Australia, and he first
believed that Australia would grow grain if "cultivated by the
hands of industry." Cook himself placed no very high value on these
three lands; he thought, apparently, that the Sandwich Islands were
worth all three of them put together. Still, as we mark these
things, we understand that our story has not lost interest, though
the nature of the interest has changed. One does not like to
compare Cook to a star, for he would have bitterly resented the
comparison. But, if one were permitted to do so, one would be
tempted to say that Cook was evening star of the old story, and
morning star of a new story, not less heroic and far more
fruitful.</p>
<p>For the present, we follow this new story only in one direction.
The siege of the South Pole, its most heroic chapter, cannot now be
told. The map of the Pacific Islands had been drawn by Cook with so
much accuracy that little remained to be added, or to be corrected,
save in the way of detail. New Zealand's geographic business had
also been settled by Cook with thoroughness. But in Australia much
remained to be learned. Even here Cook had "reaped the harvest of
discovery," but, as Cook's greatest successor said, "the gleanings
of the field remained to be gathered,"<sup>*</sup> and they were
gleanings of very considerable value. In the introduction to the
volumes in which Flinders told the story of his voyages, he showed
in careful way the problems which Cook had bequeathed to his
successors, and it is well that we should observe what those
problems were.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders, p. lxxxiii.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See Illustrations <a href="#il-68">68</a> and
<a href="#il-69">69</a>.]</p>
<p>Cook had surveyed the Eastern coast from Point Hicks to Cape
York, and he had accomplished this task with a success, which, in
view of its difficulties, was one of the greatest exploits in the
history of navigation. But his map was a first sketch made with
very imperfect instruments&mdash;for in 1768, says Flinders,
"time-keepers were in their infancy, and he was not furnished with
them"<sup>*</sup> and made also, generally, from a distance,
without opportunity to examine even the most important features
that were noticed. He had won his way to Torres Strait by a route
of such incessant and prodigious dangers that the only service he
had rendered to his successors was the knowledge that there was one
route which no sensible seaman would ever again sail.<sup>**</sup>
He had got through Torres Strait by a passage difficult and
dangerous; but, apart from this one passage, the huge chaos of the
Strait remained unexplored. The next British ships that sailed the
Strait, under Bligh and Portlock in 1792, took nineteen days to get
through;<sup>***</sup> and the next, under Bampton and Alt in 1793,
took seventy-two days; facts which "deterred all other commanders
from following them." "Perhaps," wrote Flinders, "no space of three
and a half degrees in length presents more dangers." Yet, if a
passage "moderately free from danger" were found, ships might save
"five or six weeks of their usual route by the North of New Guinea,
or the more Eastern Islands."</p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders, Preface, p. vii.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Wharton, p. xxxi: "a route which no one has
ever again followed."]</p>
<p class="note">[*** See Ida Lee's <i>Captain Bligh's Second Voyage
to the South Sea</i>. The writer also tells the story of Bligh's
3,600 mile row from Tahiti to Timor in the 23-feet long boat of the
<i>Bounty</i>, in the course of which he passed through another
channel in Torres Strait.]</p>
<p>Westward from Cape York, geography rested entirely on very old
Dutch authority. There was good evidence that, in the early
seventeenth century, the Dutch had carefully explored the Eastern
side of the Gulf of Carpentaria to 17&deg; Lat.; but "it was certain,"
wrote Flinders, "that those early navigators did not possess the
means of fixing the positions and forms of lands with anything like
the accuracy of modern science." And the geography of the South and
West coasts of the Gulf, of Arnhem Land, and of the Northern Van
Diemen's Land, rested on authority that was far less satisfactory.
The maps, it was true, gave the outline with a firm hand. But there
was no information whatever about the voyage which had produced the
map. The "general opinion" was&mdash;and the general opinion was
right&mdash;that the voyage was Tasman's voyage of 1644. But though
Tasman's "Instructions" were extant&mdash;Flinders says that they
had been "procured." by Banks, and had been printed by
Dalrymple&mdash;no record survived of the voyage itself; and the
map itself, thus unsupported, "was considered as little better than
a representation of fairy land." A voyager might find the coast as
it was drawn on the map; or he might find that there was no coast
at all;&mdash;that the "Gulf," was not a Gulf, but was, as some
early Dutch navigators had suspected, the opening of a passage
which ran to the South, and divided the continent into two
parts.</p>
<p>The North-West coast had also, it was understood, been mapped by
Tasman. But Dampier, while using Tasman's map, had concluded that
it was a superficial piece of work, and that it expressed a radical
misconception. Dampier believed that what Tasman had drawn as a
continuous coastline was in reality a collection of islands, and he
believed, in particular, that somewhere behind Rosemary Island was
the opening of a great channel that communicated with the Eastern
and Southern coasts. Now Cook had proved that there was no channel
with outlet on the Eastern coast. But it remained at least possible
that there was a channel behind Rosemary Island with outlets in the
Gulf of Carpentaria, in the Australian Bight, or in soma great
mediterranean sea in the unknown heart of the continent. Or, again,
instead of a channel there might be the mouth of a mighty river,
the Amazon of New Holland. There was certainly "a great
geographical question to be settled relative to the parts behind
Rosemary Island."</p>
<p>The Chart of the Western coast seemed to be founded on good
information as far South as Rottenest Island; "but, for its
formation from thence to Cape Leeuwin, there were no good
documents." And knowledge of the South, from Cape Leeuwin to the
Island of St. Francis and St. Peter, rested on one voyage, that of
the <i>Gulden Zeepaart</i> in 1627, a voyage of which no record
remained, save the bare statement on the map that it had been
made.<sup>*</sup> And Eastward of the Islands of St. Francis and
St. Peter, all the way to Point Hicks was sheer vacancy, broken
only by the fragmentary outline of Van Diemen's Land, as discovered
by Tasman in 1642, with a slight extension to the North East that
represented the small discoveries of Furneaux in 1773. It was this
almost unbroken vacancy between the Eastern edge of Nuytsland and
Point Hicks that offered the chief attraction to explorers. "Its
investigation," wrote Flinders, "had formed a part of the
instruction of the unfortunate French navigator Lap&eacute;rouse, and
afterwards of those of his countryman Dentrecasteaux; and it was,
not without some reason, attributed to England as a reproach, that
an imaginary line of more than two hundred and fifty leagues'
extent in the vicinity of one of her colonies should have been so
long suffered to remain traced upon the charts under the title of
UNKNOWN COAST."</p>
<p class="note">[* In 1791, however, Vancouver had sailed from King
George III.'s Sound to Termination Island, and in 1792
Dentrecasteaux had sailed nearly as far as the Dutch turning-point.
See <a href="#gulden-seepaart">earlier</a> and <a href=
"#dentrecasteaux">later</a>.]</p>
<p>The "unknown coast" presented problems of peculiar interest,
both scientific and practical. Was Van Diemen's Land continuous
with New Holland, or was it separated by a strait that would give a
very useful passage to ships? Furneaux, the seaman who had best
opportunity of knowing, had thought that they were one land, and
that the region between Point Hicks and Furneaux Island was not a
Strait but a Bay; and Cook had accepted Furneaux's opinion. On the
other hand Governor Hunter, sailing across this region in 1789, had
argued from the appearance of the sea, and from the set of the
current, that there was "either a very deep gulf or a strait."</p>
<p>Still more fascinating was the problem offered by the gap
between De Nuytsland and Van Diemen's Land or Point Hicks. It was a
gap which, in terms of modern geography, contained the whole coast
of South Australia, very nearly the whole coast of Victoria, and
the North coast and most of the West coast of Tasmania. Such coasts
were one possibility in the mind' of the explorer. But there were
other possibilities of a peculiarly exciting character. Here in
this "unknown coast," if anywhere, would be found the clue to the
inexplicable riddle of the continent;&mdash;the fact that
apparently it had no rivers! It was "scarcely credible," writes
Flinders, "that, if this vast country were one connected mass of
land, it should not contain some large rivers, and, if any, this
unknown part was one of the two remaining places<sup>*</sup> where
they were expected to discharge themselves into the sea." If, on
the other hand, as the apparent want of rivers seemed to suggest,
New Holland was in reality no continent, but a group of islands,
then one outlet of the separating channels would most likely be
found in "this unexplored part of the South coast." If, once again,
the true explanation of the lack of rivers was that the interior
was "principally occupied by a mediterrancan sea," then the
entrance to this sea, if there was an entrance, might reasonably be
looked for in the same "unknown coast."</p>
<p class="note">[* The second, apparently, being the region behind
Rosemary Island.]</p>
<p>Thus, when Cook had done his work, and ta'en his wages, much
interest still remained in the study of Australian geography. It
was an interest that touched not only men of science, but also
merchants, and also statesmen; and not only the countrymen of Cook,
but also the countrymen of de Brosses and Bougainville. It launched
voyages of discovery, both British and French, whose records are
among the most fascinating in the whole history of exploration.
But, for us, it is only possible to note the facts which are of
essential importance in the story of exploration that we have
followed; and we will note them mainly in connection with the
central figure of this last chapter, the boy of twenty-one, short,
slight, alert, with noble brow, almost black hair, and eyes dark,
bright, commanding, who sailed for Sydney on the <i>Reliance</i> in
1795.</p>
<p>Matthew Flinders, like Banks, was a Lincolnshire man, as
students of his maps have reason to know. He was induced, he says,
"to go to sea against the wishes of his friends from reading
Robinson Crusoe." A fortnight before his death, in time of
desperate illness and hard poverty, he subscribed to a new edition
of that work. We note this clue to a character adventurous,
patient, determined. At the age of fifteen he was midshipman on the
<i>Bellerophon</i>, the famous ship on which, sixteen years later,
Napoleon surrendered. Two years later he entered the school of
Cook. He sailed under Bligh&mdash;who had sailed under
Cook&mdash;in the voyage which brought the bread-fruit from Tahiti
to the West Indies. The ships passed through Torres Strait by a
passage Northward of that taken by the <i>Endeavour</i>, and
Flinders had the chance of observing under a captain, who was as
able in seamanship as he was incompetent in politics, the greatest
difficulties in the way of navigation, and how to overcome
them.</p>

<br>
<b>65. CAPTAIN MATTHEW FLINDERS, R.N.<br>
(From an engraving, published 30th Sept. 1814, by Joyce Gold, Naval
Chronicle Office.)</b></p>
<p>In 1794 Flinders, back again in the <i>Bellerophon</i>, was
present at the battle of the 1st of June, and is said to have fired
off a lot of guns without waiting orders, and to have explained
that "he thought it a fair chance to have a shot at 'em." But "the
passion for exploring new countries" grew strong; and in 1795 he
gladly sailed on the <i>Reliance</i> with Governor Hunter, the
second Governor of New South Wales, to the half-known land of the
South. The ship-surgeon was George Bass, also a Lincolnshire man,
now aged thirty-two, six feet high, of dark complexion, and of "a
very penetrating countenance";&mdash;"a man," says Flinders, "whose
ardour for discovery was not to be suppressed by any obstacles, nor
deterred by danger; and with this friend a determination was formed
of completing the examination of the East coast of New South Wales
by all such opportunities as the duty of the ship, and procurable
means, could admit." In order to make quite sure that the "means"
would not be entirely wanting, the man with the "very penetrating
countenance" had put on board "a little boat of eight feet keel and
five feet beam," which he named <i>Tom Thumb</i>. He would
penetrate at least as far as <i>Tom Thumb</i> could be made to
go.</p>
<p>And in fact it turned out that <i>Tom Thumb</i> was the only
"means procurable." Ships were scarce and small at Sydney in 1795,
and many uses for them seemed more urgent than exploration. The
plans of the young fellows were called "romantic" by officials who
were wondering how they should get something to eat; and, "so far
from any good being anticipated, even prudence and friendship
joined in discouraging if not in opposing them." But the
"penetrating Bass," though anxious to get state aid, believed that
the best way to get state aid was the way of energetic private
enterprise. <i>Tom Thumb</i> was not the sort of vessel one would
choose for exploration of an unknown and dangerous coast. Eight
feet length and five feet beam provided cramped accommodation at
night off a stormy and rocky coast for two men of whom one was six
feet tall, though the other luckily was only five feet six. But
<i>Tom Thumb</i> would have been good enough for Robinson Crusoe,
and it was good enough for Bass and Flinders. In it, in October
1795, they went to Botany Bay and explored the "winding course" of
George's River. In January 1796 they went a second cruise in
"another boat of nearly the same size," that had been built at Port
Jackson. In it they explored the coast South of Botany Bay, entered
beautiful Port Hacking, coasted fertile Illawarra, and met brave
adventures by sea and land, dear to the heart of Robinson
Crusoes.</p>
<p>The plans of the two adventurers were "romantic," but they now
seemed likely also to be useful. Solid and kindly Governor Hunter,
striving manfully against fearful odds for the good of his
disreputable subjects, felt now that he was justified in granting
state aid to those who had shown they could do so much without it.
Midshipman Flinders, unhappily, was busy in duties connected with
the repair of the <i>Reliance</i>, a ship so rotten that the
Captain thought the safe voyage from London proved that he was
"intended to be hung in room of being drowned." But Surgeon Bass
was "less confined in his duty," and had been busy penetrating in
all directions. In June 1796 he had tried to penetrate the Blue
Mountains; but "his success," his friend has to admit, "was not
commensurate to the perseverance and labour employed; the mountains
were impassable." In August 1797 he had again explored the South
coast, and had discovered the seam of coal that is worked to this
day. Next month he had walked across unknown country from the
Cowpastures to the South Coast. And now, at the end of 1797, he had
asked Governor Hunter to allow him "the use of a good boat," and
permission to "recruit her with volunteers from the King's ships."
To the sober-minded Governor, Mr. Bass seemed "a young man of a
well-informed mind, and an active disposition"; and he "accordingly
furnished him with an excellent whaleboat, well-fitted, victualled,
and manned to his wish, for the purpose of examining the coast to
the Southward, and as far as he could with safety and convenience
go."</p>
<p>The excellent whale-boat was twenty-eight feet seven inches
long, and was fitted to row eight oars. She was manned by a crew of
six British seamen, and she carried provisions for six weeks.
Bass's proposal was to re-survey in detail the coast from Port
Jackson to Point Hicks, which Cook had surveyed in outline
twenty-eight years before. But the main interest of the voyage
would begin at Point Hicks, for at that point the charted coastline
broke. There was nothing on the map Southward of it till you came
to Furneaux's Islands and Van Diemen's Land. And there was nothing
Westward of it till you came to De Nuytsland. It remained to chart
the intervening regions, and the first business was to determine
whether the water to the South of Point Hicks was a Bay or a
Strait, i.e. whether Van Diemen's Land was an island or a part of
New South Wales. It was a question in which Governor Hunter,
himself a capable surveyor, felt a special interest. In 1789,
sailing from Furneaux Island to Point Hicks, he had argued from the
appearance of the sea, and from the set of the current, that "there
is reason to believe that there is in that space either a very deep
gulf or a strait which may separate Van Diemen's Land from New
Volland." No doubt he was very willing that the young man of
well-informed mind and active disposition should have his chance to
determine a question that was not only interesting to geographers,
but also of great importance to navigators.</p>
<p>Bass, with his six, sailed on this famous voyage on the 3rd of
December, 1797.<sup>*</sup> The three hundred miles of coast
between Port Jackson and Point Hicks had been surveyed by Cook; but
Bass&mdash;thus Flinders sums things up&mdash;"added a number of
particulars which had escaped Captain Cook, and will always escape
any navigator in a first discovery unless he have the time and
means of joining a close examination by boats to what may be seen
from the ship." He noticed the famous Kiama "blow-hole,"&mdash;"a
deep ragged hole of about twenty-five or thirty feet in diameter,
and on one side of it the sea washed in through a subterranean
passage with a most tremendous noise." He discovered the lovely
Shoalhaven valley, with "many thousand acres of open ground, whose
soil is a rich vegetable mould"; but he thought, unwisely, that
"the difficulties of shipping off the produce must ever remain a
bar to its colonization." He entered Jervis Bay, and described it
as "a wide open bay of a very unpromising appearance upon first
entering it"; but he found an anchoring place where, he thought,
ships "might at most or all times ride in safety." Bateman's Bay he
thought ill of; "there is," he writes, "no shelter except merely
from Northerly winds." "Barmouth Creek" (Bega River) he described
as "the prettiest little model of a harbour we had ever seen," but
the shallow bar made entrance almost impossible. He discovered
Twofold Bay, which, he says "may be known by a red point on the
South side, of the peculiar bluish hue on a drunkard's nose." "The
nautical advantages of the Bay, notwithstanding the anchorage is
but small, seem to be superior to any we have been in"; but, he has
to add, "we had the mortification to find that the same sterility
we had almost everywhere witnessed upon the coast still attended
it."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Bass's Journal is printed in <i>Historical
Records of N.S.W.</i>, vol. iii. p. 312 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Flinders wrote later: "Twofold Bay is not of
itself worthy of particular interest; but as nothing larger than
boats can find shelter in any other part of this coast, from Jervis
Bay round to Inlet Corner (near Wilson's Promontory) or to
Furneaux's Isles, it thereby becomes of importance to whalers and
to other ships passing along the coast."]</p>
<p>At Point Hicks&mdash;where he failed to distinguish the
"Point"&mdash;he passed the Southernmost limit of Cook's survey,
and began the exploration of unknown coast. Here, comments
Flinders, "began the harvest in which Mr. Bass was ambitious to
place the first reaping-hook." He rounded the great Southern
promontory, which seemed "well worthy of being the boundary point
of a large strait, and a corner stone of this great island New
Holland." He named it Furneaux's Land, thinking that Furneaux had
seen it in 1773. But Flinders afterwards showed that this was a
mistake, and the name was changed to Wilson's Promontory, "in
compliment," says Flinders, "to my friend Thomas Wilson, Esq., of
London."</p>
<p>Bass intended now "to make the North coast of Van Diemen's
Land." But Governor Hunter's "excellent whaleboat "was showing that
some of its parts were not so excellent as others. "The water was
observed to gush in through the boat's side pretty plentifully,"
and Bass thought it wisest to return to the promontory, and to
coast Westward; "for the state of the boat," he writes, "did not
seem to allow of our quitting the shore with propriety." They were
in fact, comments Flinders&mdash;who has a useful way of saying
things which his friend omits to mention&mdash;in "the greatest
danger; but the good qualities of his little bark, with careful
steerage, carried him through this perilous night." On a tiny
island near the promontory, he discovered with amazement a party of
seven convicts, mostly Irish, who had escaped from Sydney, and had
been deserted by their companions. Bass relieved their extreme
distress, and promised to call at the island on his return.</p>
<p>Then, coasting North-Westward, he discovered the "very extensive
harbour," which, "from its relative position to every other known
harbour on the coast," he named "Western Port." Here he stayed
twelve days, receiving impressions that were only moderately
favourable. "He had the satisfaction, however," comments
Flinders&mdash;always afraid lest his friend's modesty should lead
to an undervaluation of his work&mdash;"of placing, at the end of
his new coast, an extensive and useful harbour, surrounded with a
country superior to any other known parts of New South Wales."</p>
<p>Had Bass been able to sail round the Western Promontory of
Western Port, he would have been the discoverer of Port Phillip,
and would perhaps have been the first to observe the site of
Melbourne. But he had perforce to turn for home. He had been given
provisions for six weeks, and he had already been away for nearly
seven. In his return voyage he noticed seals upon the island near
the Promontory, and made the remark, which proved profitable to
others, that "a speculation upon a small scale might be carried on
with advantage." He took on board two of the distressed convicts,
and, giving the other five a musket, fishing lines and a compass,
he landed them on the continent, and advised them to walk to
Sydney, five hundred miles away. He had done all that he could do
for them, but they were never seen again.</p>
<p>When near the Promontory, Bass noticed the rapidity of the tide,
and made an interesting remark. "Whenever it shall be decided," he
wrote, "that the opening between this and Van Diemen's Land is a
strait, this rapidity of tide, and that long swell upon the coast
to the Westward will be accounted for." The phrase is comically
cautious. It reminds one of the saying of the Oxford classical
student who, when asked, after an examination in geometry, whether
he had proved a certain proposition to be true, replied that,
though he had not exactly proved it to be true, he believed he had
shown it to be on the whole extremely probable. The fact was,
however, as Flinders tells, that "Mr. Bass himself entertained no
doubt of the existence of a wide strait separating Van Diemen's
Land from New South Wales, and he yielded with the greatest
reluctance to the necessity of returning before it was so fully
ascertained as to admit of no doubt in the minds of others." But
there was very little doubt in the minds of others. Governor Hunter
wrote home that "we have much reason to conclude that there is an
open strait"; and Flinders thought that no other proof of its
existence was needed than that of sailing through it. Bass's odd
phrase is interesting, as a singular illustration of the modesty of
the man, and of the cautious language of the new scientific period.
In earlier days, a seaman who saw a mile of land, or even a
good-sized cloud, in the Pacific was prepared to swear that he had
seen a continent which extended from Tierra del Fuego to the
Solomons. Now Bass saw facts which proved that he had discovered
the Strait, and he was content to say, in effect, that when someone
else had discovered the Strait, the facts which he, Bass, had
noticed would be accounted for. It is satisfactory that, in spite
of all that Bass managed to leave unsaid, the Strait, thanks to
friend Flinders, bears the name of the man who discovered it.</p>
<p>Bass reached Sydney on the 25th of February after an absence of
eighty-four days. With "the assistance of occasional supplies of
petrels, fish, seal's flesh, and a few geese and black swans, and
by abstinence," he had made six weeks' provision serve for twelve.
Flinders would have given many a week's wage to have had a share in
the splendid venture and exploit. But, to the student, his absence
was perhaps an advantage, for he was the better able to praise.
Bass's own diary is modest, cautious, reticent, almost
colourless:&mdash;the one touch of colour is the artistic
description of the drunkard's nose by which you may recognize
Twofold Bay, and that touch was no doubt forced upon him by
irresistible reminiscence of things seen in Sydney; a city in
which, as Dr. Lang said, nearly everyone at this time was either
selling rum or drinking it. But when, sixteen years later, Flinders
told the story he could tell the whole truth. "A voyage," he wrote,
"expressly undertaken for discovery in an open boat, and in which
six hundred miles of coast, mostly in a boisterous climate, were
explored, has not perhaps its equal in the annals of maritime
history. The public will award to its high-spirited and noble
conductor, alas! now no more, an honourable place in the list of
those whose ardour stands most conspicuous for the promotion of
useful knowledge." And, in fact, the generally irreverent public of
Sydney had already awarded that honourable place. In 1802, two
French ships, of which we shall hear more, sailed into Port
Jackson, and a very able French man of science, named P&eacute;ron, wrote
a description of Sydney that has great historical value and
interest. He told of the discovery of the Strait "by a simple
whaleboat, commanded by Mr. Bass, surgeon of the ship
<i>Reliance</i>," and he continued:&mdash;"Consecrated, as I may
say, by this grand discovery, this bold navigation, Mr. Bass's boat
is preserved in this port with a kind of religious respect.
Snuff-boxes made of its keel are relics, of which the possessors
are as proud as they are careful, and the Governor himself
(Governor King) imagined he could not make a more respectful
present to our chief than a piece of wood from the boat, set in a
large silver <i>&eacute;tui</i>, round which were engraven the particulars
of the discovery of Bass's Strait."</p>
<p>When Bass returned to Sydney, Flinders was away on a voyage.
Duties on the <i>Reliance</i> had prevented him from joining his
friend on the whale-boat. But luck came to him three weeks before
Bass returned. Governor Hunter was sending the <i>Francis</i> to
the Furneaux Islands to bring back the cargo of a ship which had
been wrecked on one of them; and he gave Flinders permission to
sail in her, in order "to make such observations; serviceable to
geography and navigation, as circumstances might afford." Flinders
made his surveys with his usual care and ability, and he wrote some
interesting remarks about seals and sooty petrels or mutton birds.
The seals, he said, reminded him of "a farmyard well stocked with
pigs," while petrels could be had in any quantity by thrusting your
arm into their holes, if you dared face the risk that at the end of
the hole there might be a snake instead of a petrel. But Flinders'
mind was chiefly concerned with the problem of the unexplored sea
to the West, which Furneaux had thought to be a Bay. Flinders, like
Bass, reached the conclusion that Furneaux had been satisfied with
insufficient evidence. He observed from Furneaux Islands the same
significant currents which Bass had just observed from Wilson's
Promontory; and he came to the conclusion, by this independent
observation, that "the great strength of the tides setting Westward
past the islands could only be caused by some exceedingly deep
inlet, or by a passage through to the Southern Indian Ocean."</p>
<p>Flinders arrived at Sydney on the 9th of March 1798. Bass had
arrived a fortnight before. The friends exchanged notes, agreed
that a Strait existed, and determined to sail through it. Flinders
had first to make a trip to Norfolk Island. But, in September 1798,
he was free, and he had his desire. Governor Hunter gave him the
use for twelve weeks of the <i>Norfolk</i>, a sloop of twenty-five
tons, which had been built in Norfolk Island of the famous pines.
She was a bad boat in all respects, but she could float, and that
sufficed. Sailing in her, Flinders was to prove that there was a
Strait by sailing through it; and then to prove that Van Diemen's
Land was an island by sailing round it. <i>His</i> special business
would be to make observations serviceable to geography and
navigation. "My friend Bass" was to accompany him, with special
duty to make observations on the lands that would be visited. The
crew were eight volunteers from the King's ships. Twelve weeks were
allowed, and twelve weeks' provisions were put on board.</p>
<p>Flinders sailed from Sydney on the 7th of October 1798, and from
Furneaux's Islands on the 1st of November.<sup>*</sup> He made for
the North coast of Van Diemen's Land, and on the 3rd of November he
observed an inlet with shores "covered with grass and wood to the
water's edge," a remarkable contrast to "the rocky, sterile banks
observed in sailing up Port Jackson." Entering, he discovered a
harbour which he named Port Dalrymple, and it proved to be "an
excellent place of refreshment." Into it flowed a beautiful river
whose shores "presented an appearance of fertility that astonished
an eye used to those of the rocky harbours of New South Wales."
Here they spent sixteen happy days, Flinders surveying harbour and
river, while Bass tramped the country with his dogs. He was
especially impressed by sight of enormous flocks of black
swans&mdash;he once counted three hundred of them swimming within a
square quarter-mile. He heard the dying song of some scores of
them, and he says that it "exactly resembled the creaking of a
rusty ale-house sign on a windy day." Not more than two-thirds of
the flock could fly; a fact which no doubt helped to form the
opinion that Port Dalrymple was "an excellent place for
refreshment." In fact, all things suggested a settlement; and six
years later a settlement was formed forty miles up the river, which
was named the Tamar, at a beautiful place which was named
Launceston.<sup>**</sup></p>

<p class="note">[** Walker's <i>Early Tasmania</i>, p. 110.]</p>
<p>Westward from Port Dalrymple, the coast was found to trend
towards the North-West, and the water appeared to be
discoloured;&mdash;facts which seemed to indicate that "we were
approaching the head of a bay rather than the issue of a strait."
But on the 7th of December, they observed a tide from the West
which they considered "a strong proof not only of the real
existence of a passage between this land and New South Wales, but
also that the entrance into the Southern Indian Sea could not be
far distant." On the 9th they could see no main land to the West,
and "a long swell was perceived to come from the South-West." The
long swell "was likely to prove troublesome and perhaps dangerous";
but, writes Flinders, "Mr. Bass and myself hailed it with joy and
mutual congratulation, as announcing the completion of our
long-wished-for discovery of a passage into the Southern Indian
Ocean."</p>
<p>Van Diemen's Land, then, was an island, and Flinders sailed
along its Western coast, observing mountains&mdash;so writes the
man from flat and fertile Lincolnshire&mdash;which seemed "amongst
the most stupendous works of nature I ever beheld, and...the most
dismal and barren that can be imagined. The eye ranges over these
peaks and variously formed lumps of adamantine rock with
astonishment and horror." On the 11th of December he identified
Tasman's landfall, and named Mount Heemskirk and Mount Zeehan in
memory of the Dutch ships. Then he sailed along the shores which
Tasman had charted one hundred and fifty years before, recognizing
the main landmarks and correcting the detail. Rounding "the rugged
and determined front" which the extremity of Van Diemen's Land
presents to the icy regions of the South Pole," he came on the 14th
of December to Storm Bay.</p>
<p>He was now in a region that had been visited by several
navigators. Tasman had surveyed the coast, and had given names to
its prominent features. Furneaux and Cook had mistaken Tasman's
landmarks in a way that produced permanent geographic confusion. In
1792 and 1793 the French navigator Dentrecasteaux had twice made
long visits to the Channel which still bears his name; had explored
with enthusiastic praise its fertile and beautiful shores; had
explored&mdash;to use terms of modern geography&mdash;Norfolk Bay
and Frederick Henry Bay; and had sailed twenty miles up the river
Derwent, which he called the River of the North,&mdash;an unhappy
name, comments Flinders, for a river in the far South. The
hydrographer, Beaupr&eacute;, had made charts which, wrote Flinders at a
later date, "contain some of the finest specimens of marine
surveying perhaps ever made in a new country";<sup>*</sup> but
those charts were unknown to Flinders when he sailed into Storm
Bay. He had, however, a rough chart which had been made by Hayes, a
seaman who had been sent in 1794 by the East Indian Company to
explore the Australasian part of the huge domain subject to their
monopoly, and who, in ignorance of the French discoveries, had made
these discoveries again, and had given them English names.</p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders, p. xciii.; Walker, p. 8.]</p>
<p>Thus in the lovely region of Hobart there were no big things
left for Flinders to discover. His main business was to make exact
geographic reports, and to endeavour to get the confusion of
geographic names into intelligible order; the latter task proved
impracticable, and confusion became permanent.<sup>*</sup> Bass,
meanwhile, explored with his dogs both sides of the river, and,
first of Englishmen, enjoyed the delight&mdash;if a mountain ever
can be a delight to a Lincolnshire man&mdash;of climbing Mount
Wellington. His report was generally favourable, though his words
sound faint praise to those who justly regard Hobart as one of the
most perfectly situated cities in the world. To Bass the Derwent is
a "dull and lifeless stream," with "a sleepy course." If it has
"any claim to respectability, it is indebted for it more to the
paucity of inlets into Van Diemen's Land than to any intrinsic
merit of its own." The soil is, on the average, better than the
soil of New South Wales, though the best in New South Wales is
better than the best in Van Diemen's Land. Both these countries are
"poor countries"; but, at all events, Van Diemen's Land "seldom
sickens the hearts of its travellers with those extensive tracts
which at once disarm industry, and leave the warmest imagination
without one beguiling prospect." However, from the practical point
of view, it sufficed that Van Diemen's Land, though poor, was less
poor than New South Wales. "Many large tracts of land," Bass was
able to say, "appear cultivateable both for maize and wheat, but
which, as pastureland, would be excellent." The extensive valleys,
he further admits, "contain an indeterminate depth of rich soil,
capable of supporting the most exhausting vegetation." After all,
there have been many countries, besides New South Wales, poorer
than this. Bass especially recommended the land at the head of
Risdon Creek, and his recommendation prevailed. In 1803 a
settlement was made in this "fertile valley of great beauty." The
site, however, proved unsuitable for a large town, and the little
settlement moved next year to the neighbouring Sullivan
Cove.<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* <i>E.g.</i> "As I apprehend this is the place
that Tasman called Frederick Henry Bay more than a century ago, I
have prefixed that name to it in the chart" (<i>Historical Records
of N.S.W.</i>, vol. iii. p. 805)&mdash;a mistake which confirmed
once more Furneaux's mistake, and placed on the West side of
Tasman's peninsula a Bay which Tasman had placed on the East.]</p>
<p class="note">[** See Walker's <i>Early Tasmania</i>, p. 59.]</p>
<p>Flinders sailed from the Derwent, after a fortnight's stay, on
the 30th of December, and he reached Sydney on the 11th of January,
1799. He had lengthened the permitted twelve weeks to fourteen. The
fruits of the voyage were of great value. It led to the
colonization of Van Diemen's Land, and it determined the sites of
its two chief cities. But its great distinction was the definite
proof of the existence of a Strait between New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land. This was a discovery, Flinders claimed, which
shortened the passage from the Cape to Port Jackson by at least a
week; and it also made easier the passage from the South Cape of
Van Diemen's Land to the Cape of Good Hope or to India by removing
"the fear of the great unknown bight between the South Cape and the
South-West Cape of Leeuwen's Land." Ships sailing from South Cape
could now safely make a West-North-West course, or call at King
George the Third's Sound, that had been discovered by Vancouver;
and "it is to be hoped," concluded Flinders, already thinking of
the future rather than of the past, "that a few years will disclose
to us many others (i.e. other Sounds) on the coast, as well as the
verification or futility of the conjecture that a still larger than
Bass's Strait dismembers New Holland." All these good things
followed from the discovery of Bass's Strait, and "Bass's Strait,"
Flinders told Governor Hunter, the name must be. "This," he wrote
at a later date, "was no more than a just tribute to my worthy
friend and companion, for the extreme dangers and fatigues he had
undergone in first entering it in the whaleboat, and to the correct
judgment he had formed."</p>
<p>And this is our reverent and affectionate farewell to George
Bass, that clear, bright, brave and loving spirit. His day of
knightly venture was done, and the end no man knows. We follow the
story of the equal friend, still determined to carry the common
scheme to completion.</p>
<p>For to Flinders it still seemed morning. The rich gleanings of
Cook's harvest remained on the field, and he was so to gather them
that no straw would remain for his successors. "My greatest
ambition," he wrote, "is to make such a minute investigation that
no person shall have occasion to come after me to make further
discoveries." All the problems of the Australian map crowded his
mind, and, dominant among them, the problem of the still "unknown
coast" between De Nuyts's discovery of the islands of St. Peter and
St. Francis, and Bass's discovery of Western Port. Did this unknown
coast contain, as was generally believed,<sup>*</sup> "a still
larger than Bass's Strait," which "dismembered New Holland" by
running Northward till it opened into the Gulf of Carpentaria? That
was the question in Flinders' mind as he sailed back to Sydney, and
the one thing certain was that, if he did not answer it, the fault
would not be his.</p>
<p class="note">[*</p>
<p>In September 1800, Governor King wrote that "a sea or strait
running from the Gulf of Carpentaria into the Southern Ocean" was
"a very favourite idea in this country."]</p>
<p>Luck went with him. In spite of repairs, the <i>Reliance</i> was
so rotten that, in March 1800, Governor Hunter thought well to send
her home, while there was still a chance that "she may be capable
of performing the voyage." She performed the voyage, though with
difficulty, and Flinders, sailing upon her, came to England in
October 1800. He printed his "Observations" on the coasts he had
discovered, and he dedicated the pamphlet to Sir Joseph Banks.</p>
<p>For Banks, whom we left at the end of his voyage a joyful boy of
twenty-eight, was in 1800 a man of fifty-seven, still boylike in
enthusiasms and energies, but with full powers to get those things
done which his strong will and hot temper decided ought to be done.
For twenty-three years he had been President of the Royal Society,
and for twenty years longer he was to remain in that position. And,
through all those years, he used character, influence, and money to
organize scientific research as no one man ever organized
scientific research either before him or after him. He was, as one
of his political friends truly said, "His Majesty's Ministre des
Affaires Philosophiques,"<sup>*</sup> and His Majesty was far more
open to advice in affairs of philosophy than in affairs of
politics; though, as Banks knew, he could muddle an affair of sheep
as ignorantly and as obstinately as he muddled an affair of
America. And, while the whole world was the province of Banks's
studies, the country which he had made his own was the country
which, when he was leaving it, he had described as in every respect
the barrenest country he had ever seen. It was mainly his
recommendation that had caused the Government to found the colony
of New South Wales in 1788, and by March 1797 the enthusiasm of age
had so grown in him that he was wishing that he could himself go to
settle on the Hawkesbury, and was asking the question whether
England might not revive in New South Wales when it had sunk in
Europe.<sup>**</sup> It was to Banks, then, that British
secretaries turned when they needed instruction about what seemed
to them the indispensable nuisance of a convict colony, and Banks
gave instructions that were vehement and minute. He recommended
officials from Governors to Gardeners, and both Governors and
Gardeners were his obedient servants and correspondents. It was
certain that what things he thought should be done in New South
Wales would at least be attempted. Wherefore it was to Sir Joseph
Banks that Flinders dedicated his "Observations," and explained the
need of a voyage that should make a full and exact exploration of
all the coasts of Australia, "as well those which were imperfectly
known as those entirely unknown."</p>

<b>66. SIR JOSEPH BANKS, BART., P.C., K.B., F.R.S.<br>
(From a painting by Thomas Phillips in the National Portrait
Gallery.)</b></p>
<p>Sir Joseph thought well of Flinders and of his proposals, and he
easily persuaded his friend Earl Spencer, the First Lord of the
Admiralty, to give Flinders command of the best of the bad ships
that could be spared from the present war. The <i>Investigator</i>
was a sloop of three hundred and thirty-four tons, and "nearly
resembled the description of the vessel recommended by Captain
Cook." She was in a very weak and leaky condition&mdash;she began
"to leak as soon as the channel was cleared"&mdash;but Flinders was
told that "no better ship could be spared from the service," and
"my anxiety," he explains, "to complete the investigation of the
coasts of Terra Australis did not admit of refusing the one
offered." In all matters of equipment the generosity of the
Government was boundless. The Secretary told Banks that any
proposal he made would be approved, and that the whole was left
entirely to his decision. Banks told Flinders to fit out the ship
as he should judge necessary, and Flinders' judgment was probably
the best in England. Among the men of science whom Banks sent with
him was the very famous botanist Robert Brown&mdash;Banks described
him as "a Scotchman, fitted to pursue an object with constancy and
a cold mind"&mdash;and among the midshipmen was John Franklin, one
more famous Lincolnshire man, who was now first to learn the
business of discovery.</p>
<p>Flinders' ambition was to explore with perfect and final
exactness all the Australian coasts, "as well those which were
imperfectly known as those entirely unknown." But the problem that
dominated his mind was the problem of the "unknown coast" between
De Nuytsland and Western Port, and especially the question whether
it contained the entrance of a channel which "dismembered New
Holland" by running to the Gulf of Carpentaria. And it was the
exploration of this "unknown coast" which, in fact, was the most
interesting part of the <i>Investigator's</i> voyage. The end of
the story was that this "unknown coast" was discovered in four
parts by four explorers. Of these four explorers Flinders was one.
Two others were Grant and Murray in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>. And the
fourth was the French navigator Baudin in <i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i>. And,
in order to follow Flinders' story with intelligence, we must know
something of the stories of the other three explorers.</p>
<p>In 1799 Philip Gidley King, who perhaps knew as much about New
South Wales as anyone, was in England and was preparing to sail
back to Sydney as successor to Governor Hunter. He explained to
Banks that a small boat was much needed in order to explore the
shallow waters of rivers and bays; and it was finally agreed that
the perfect boat for the purpose was a sixty ton boat, named the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, that had been built by Captain Schanck of the
Admiralty with a sliding keel, the effects of which were vastly
admired. In January 1800 this tiny boat&mdash;generally called,
says Lieutenant Grant her proud commander, <i>His Majesty's Tinder
Box</i>&mdash;sailed on her long voyage. When Grant reached the
Cape, he received a letter, written after his departure by the Duke
of Portland, which informed him of the discovery of Bass's Strait,
and instructed him to sail through the Strait on his way to Sydney.
In obeying this instruction, Grant made the first discovery of part
of the unknown coast. On the 3rd of December he saw two capes which
he named Cape Banks and Cape Northumberland. On the modern map they
stand at the extreme South-Eastern corner of South Australia, on
the border of Victoria. Sailing Eastward, he named Cape Bridgewater
and Cape Nelson, sailed across an opening which he named Portland
Bay, named Cape Otway, and thence sailed to Wilson's Promontory
across an opening which he named King's Bay;<sup>*</sup> a Bay
which, as he knew, contained Western Port, and which also
contained, though he did not know it, Port Phillip. Grant's
discovery, then, had been the coast from Cape Banks to Cape Otway,
that is the Western half of the coastline of the State of Victoria;
and, further, the map of his track<sup>**</sup> invited exploration
of the great opening between Cape Otway and Wilson's Promontory,
which included Port Phillip and the site of Melbourne. Grant
described King's Bay as being one hundred miles wide, and so "deep"
that he "could not see the bottom of it from the mast-head"; and he
wondered whether this "very deep bay" was the entrance of a channel
which led to the Gulf of Carpentaria and "insulated New South
Wales." Bringing this news with him, Grant passed the Strait, the
first seaman who passed it from West to East, and reached Sydney on
the 16th of December, 1800, declaring that the <i>Lady Nelson</i>
was equal to any vessel as a sea-boat"&mdash;a statement which had
afterwards to be qualified by the admission of "the utter
impossibility of her ever being able to beat off a lee-shore."</p>
<p class="note">[* He wrote to Governor King, "One of the most
extensive (Bays) I named after yourself, as it is the largest I met
with, and is, by tolerable estimation from the ship's run on the
log, one hundred and odd miles nearly due East and West from Cape
to Cape" (<i>Historical Records of N.S.W.</i>, vol. iv. p.
269).]</p>
<p class="note">[** Grant's book (p. 69) gives his track. See

which is printed in <i>Historical Records of N.S.W.</i>, vol. iv.

<br>
<b>67. PART OF MAP IN GRANT'S <i>Narrative of a Voyage of
Discovery</i>.</b></p>
<p>In October 1801 the <i>Lady Nelson</i> was sent, under command
of Lieutenant Murray, to make further exploration in Bass's
Straits, and especially to explore the big gap of one hundred miles
which Grant had noticed between Wilson's Promontory and Cape Otway.
Sailing out of Western Port on the 5th of January 1802, Murray saw
in the afternoon, "an opening in the land that had the appearance
of a harbour," and, approaching nearer, he saw across a reef "a
fine sheet of smooth water of great extent." The entrance, however,
looked dangerous, the wind "blowed as much as our vessel likes," so
Murray sailed on, and by the end of January returned to Western
Port. Hence, on the 1st of February, he sent the launch under Mr.
Bowen to seek a channel. "Mr. Bowen reported," writes Murray, "that
a good Channel was found into this new harbour,...and according to
his account it is a most noble sheet of water, larger even than
Western Port, with many fine Coves and entrances in it." On the
15th of February 1802, Murray managed, with much suspicion and
carefulness, to sail the <i>Lady Nelson</i> through what seemed the
dangerous entrance into the harbour. "The young man," wrote
Governor King to Banks, "did very well...He discovered a spacious
harbour about six miles to the Westward of Western Port which I
named Port Phillip, after my worthy and dear friend the Admiral,
who, until now, had not had his name bestowed on either stick or
stone in the colony."</p>
<p>Thus, before Flinders reached the "unknown coast," two parts of
it had been discovered. Grant had discovered the coast from Cape
Banks to Cape Otway in December 1800; and Murray and Bowen had
discovered Port Phillip in January and February 1802. Flinders did
not hear of these discoveries till he came to
Sydney.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* <i>Voyage</i>, vol. i. p. 200.]</p>
<p>There is no reason to think that Flinders gave himself trouble
about the rivalry of British seamen, but there was a foreign rival
whose voyage was much in his mind. In May 1800 Napoleon authorised
the despatch of two ships, <i>Le G&eacute;ographe</i> and <i>Le
Naturaliste</i>, under Baudin, with instructions to explore the
Australian coasts, and in October 1800 the ships sailed. It was a
voyage the meaning of which must be interpreted in the light of
previous French plans and enterprises. Since the days when de
Brosses had studied the problems of the Pacific, "both as
geographer and as citizen," interest in those problems had burnt as
steady and as keen in France as in Britain. As rivalry in the
Atlantic ended, rivalry in the Pacific began. It took the form of
"voyages of curiosity," but the voyagers were curious not only
about affairs of philosophy, but also about affairs of politics.
Their desire was knowledge, but their talk was also of commerce and
of settlement. And they talked a good deal also of one another, and
they followed one another in a way that reminds us of the old
school game of Chevy Chase. Bougainville followed Wallis, and Cook
followed Bougainville, and Marion and Kerguelen and Lap&eacute;rouse
followed Cook.</p>
<p>Then the plot hardened. In 1756 de Brosses had proposed a French
convict colony in New Britain, and in 1788 Phillip, after a few
days in Botany Bay, founded a British convict colony in Port
Jackson. Eight days after Phillip had arrived in Botany Bay, two
French ships sailed into the Bay under Lap&eacute;rouse, and excellent
books still make the comment that England only won Australia by
those few days.<sup>*</sup> The comment is entirely wrong. There is
not the smallest reason to suppose that Lap&eacute;rouse had designs on
New South Wales.<sup>**</sup> His voyage, as both Governmental
Instructions and his own conduct show, was a voyage of curiosity;
and, when he called at Botany Bay, he had three objects only in
mind&mdash;knowledge, refreshment, and opportunity to put together
a new long boat.<sup>***</sup> He obtained what he sought, and
sailed away; and, thirty-eight years afterwards, the relics of his
ships were found at the bottom of the sea near an island in the
Santa Cruz group. Lap&eacute;rouse has no place in the story of Australian
discovery, yet we would not willingly forget the radiant figure,
true knight of Humanity, that stands so bright against the drab
circumstances of our beginning.</p>
<p class="note">[* Phillip arrived on January 18th. Lap&eacute;rouse got
sight of land on January 24th, but was unable to enter the bay till
January 26th. Phillip left Botany Bay to explore Port Jackson on
January 21st; and the British ships sailed to Port Jackson on
January 25th and 26th, leaving the French, as Lap&eacute;rouse wrote,
"alone and masters of the Bay." He sailed on March 10th.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Lap&eacute;rouse's very elaborate "Instructions" had
been drawn up in 1785 by the Comte de Fleurieu, who had probably
more complete knowledge of the geographical problems of the Pacific
than any other living man. The object of the voyage was to clear up
these geographic problems. There was no suggestion of French
settlement. It was declared that "the distance of the Pacific
islands" seems likely to prohibit nations of Europe from forming
establishments there." In Australasia, Lap&eacute;rouse was to sail
through "Endeavour Strait," to survey the Gulf of Carpentaria and
the West coast, and "inspect more particularly the Southern coast,
of which the greatest part has never been explored." Then he was to
call at Van Diemen's Land, and to sail thence to Queen Charlotte
Sound, where he was to discover if the British have made a
settlement. No reference was made to Botany Bay, or to British
plans of settlement there. Lap&eacute;rouse's correspondence shows that,
so late as the 7th of September, 1787, his intention was to sail
from Avatscha, not to Botany Bay, but, in accordane with his
Instructions, to New Zealand. On the 28th of September, however, he
wrote to the French minister that, in consequence of orders just
received from him, he will touch at Botany Bay. The French
minister's letter has not, I think, been printed. It seems clear
that it contained information about the proposed English settlement
at Botany Bay, and that it ordered Lap&eacute;rouse to call there. But it
is impossible to believe that it contained instructions to annex
New South Wales. New South Wales had been formally annexed by Cook
in 1770. If Lap&eacute;rouse had arrived at Botany Bay before Phillip, and
had fronted him with a French annexation, the act would have been
equivalent to declaration of war on Great Britain, for a locality
which the French had shown no desire to possess. It seems certain
that Lap&eacute;rouse was told to visit Botany Bay in the spirit in which,
in the original instructions, he had been told to visit New
Zealand. It was to be a visit of curiosity, though the facts
learned would be interesting to French politicians as well as to
French philosophers. A Sydney soldier (Paterson) says that
Lap&eacute;rouse expected to find a town built and a market
established.]</p>
<p class="note">[*** Cf. Scott in <i>Victorian Historical
Magazine</i>, Dec. 1912.]</p>
<p><a name="dentrecasteaux" id="dentrecasteaux"></a>Lap&eacute;rouse was a
hero to all Frenchmen, to the men of the Revolution as to the men
of the old regime; and the romance of his name strengthened the
determination that Frenchmen should take large share in the
exploration of the Pacific. In 1791 the National Assembly decreed
that two ships should be sent under Dentrecasteaux, to search for
tidings of Lap&eacute;rouse, and, while searching, to complete his work.
The voyage was a failure. No trace of Lap&eacute;rouse was found. No
explanation of unknown Australia was made. In two places, however,
noteworthy work was done. Dentrecasteaux surveyed that part of the
South Coast which had been surveyed by the <i>Gulden Zeepaart</i>
in 1627, and which had never been visited since that date. He did
not, however, sail quite so far Eastward as the Dutch seaman had
sailed, and the unknown coast remained unknown. The French
hydrographer, Beaupr&eacute;, gave high praise to the old Dutch chart, and
himself made a chart of which Flinders says "no chart of a coast so
little known as this was will bear a comparison with its original
better." The voyage left on the map the names of Esperance Bay and
Recherche Archipelago. The other place&mdash;a far more pleasant
place&mdash;in which Dentrecasteaux did noteworthy work, was, as we
have already seen, the lovely channel in Van Diemen's Land, which
still bears his name. Here at last a thoroughly attractive region
had been discovered, and it had been discovered by Frenchmen. Why
not a French colony in fertile Dentrecasteaux Channel, to match the
British colony in barren Port Jackson? True, the British had
formally annexed the whole Eastern coast from Cape York to the
South Cape of Van Diemen's Land. But it was certain that a British
Government, which was willing to make peace by the cession of
conquests like Cape Colony, would not prolong the war in order to
keep Van Diemen's Land. These thoughts are not recorded, but it
would be strange if French voyagers did not think them. It was a
country, wrote Baudin in 1802, "which ought not to be neglected,
and which a nation that does not love us does not look upon with
indifference."</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, we can understand the meaning of the
expedition which sailed under Baudin in October 1801. The plan of
it was formed by French men of science, who were organized in the
"Institute of France" somewhat as British men of science were
organized in the Royal Society. It was, in its avowed purpose,
solely a voyage of curiosity, just as the voyages of Cook and of
Flinders, of Bougainville, Lap&eacute;rouse and Dentrecasteaux had been
solely voyages of curiosity. But, as with all these other voyages,
the curiosity was a national curiosity, and was closely connected
with national ambitions. Among the members of the Institute was
Bougainville, the aide-de-camp of Montcalm, and the predecessor of
Cook. And among them too was the Comte de Fleurieu, who had written
the "Instructions" both of Lap&eacute;rouse and Dentrecasteaux, who knew
the problems of Pacific geography as well as Flinders knew them,
and who was almost as eager as he that the prize of discovery
should fall to his own countrymen. And it was as a voyage of
national curiosity that Flinders thought of it, when he heard, in
October 1800, that Baudin had actually sailed, with instructions to
do precisely those things which Flinders had for years treasured in
mind as dearest objects of British quest. Baudin was to make full
and minute examination of the Australian coasts, and especially he
was to explore the Southern coast, "where there is supposed to be a
strait communicating with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and which
consequently would divide New Holland into two large and almost
equal islands." What danger that Flinders' discoveries would be
discovered before Flinders arrived&mdash;and discovered by the
French enemy!</p>
<p>And, though the confidential instructions of the Minister of
Marine to Baudin declared that "the sole object" of the voyage was
"the perfecting of scientific knowledge," it was very possible that
it would also have other results. For French men of science were
French patriots, and, anxious as they were to enlarge scientific
knowledge, they were far more anxious to enlarge French dominions.
When P&eacute;ron, the brilliant man of science who sailed with Baudin,
was being courteously entertained at Sydney, he made scientific
studies that were careful and interesting; but, if we would know
what he thought about with keenest interest during those Sydney
days, we should read, not his scientific studies, but the
explanation in his "Report on Port Jackson" of "the project of
destroying this freshly-set trap of a great Power."<sup>*</sup> And
though, as Professor Scott has abundantly proved, it was not
Napoleon but the Institute of France who proposed Baudin's voyage,
it was to Napoleon that the proposal was made, and it was Napoleon
who approved it; Napoleon, who was becoming "weary of this old
Europe," whose thoughts were growing less continental and more
Oceanic, who was dreaming that France's future was on the
sea,<sup>**</sup> and who was planning Empires in America, and in
India, and why not beyond? There is no reason to think that, when
Napoleon sanctioned the plan of the scientific gentlemen of the
Institute, he expected Baudin to make straight the way for a
Napoleonic Empire in Australia. He was, in 1800, far too busy in
Europe, and far too weak on the sea, to be inclined to formulate
concrete plans of annexation in Australia. But British statesmen in
London, and British officials in Sydney, were convinced that a
Napoleonic victory in Europe would be followed by a challenge to
British sea power, that the ultimate aim would be to make the
Napoleonic Empire not merely European but world-wide, and that
there was reason to fear plans for a Terre Napol&eacute;on in New Holland.
Therefore they regarded Baudin's search for "scientific knowledge"
with suspicion, and their suspicion was just.<sup>***</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Scott's <i>Flinders</i>, p. 464. P&eacute;ron writes:
"My opinion, and that of all those among us who have been
<i>particularly occupied with the organization of that colony</i>,
would be that <i>we should destroy it as soon as possible</i>.
To-day we can do that easily; we shall not be able to do it in a
few years to come." He adds that Lieutenant de Freycinet" has
particularly occupied himself with examining at all points in the
coast in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson that are favourable for
the debarkation of troops." Freycinet's conclusion was that "the
conquest of Port Jackson would be very easy to accomplish, since
the English have neglected every species of means of defence."
Napoleon, no doubt, had Freycinet's statements in mind when in 1810
he ordered the equipment of a squadron to "take the English colony
of Port Jackson where considerable resources will be found." Baudin
himself warned the French Minister of Marine "that the Colony of
Port Jackson ought to engage the attention of this government...It
seems to me that policy demands that by some means the preparations
they are making for the future, which foreshadows great projects,
ought to be balanced." See very interesting documents in Scott's
<i>Flinders</i>.]</p>
<p class="note">[** Cf. his instructions to De Caen in 1805. He
intends some day to strike a blow for "that glory which perpetuates
the memory of men throughout the centuries, and it is first
necessary that we should become masters of the sea" (Scott's
<i>Flinders</i>, p. 316).]</p>
<p class="note">[*** P&eacute;ron told De Caen: "It would be easy to
demonstrate to you that all our natural history researches,
extolled with so much ostentation by the government, were merely
the pretext of the enterprise." Scott shows that scientific
research was not merely a pretext. But P&eacute;ron's words illustrate the
fact that scientists were politicians, and were more interested in
politics than in science.]</p>
<p>Such suspicions must have been in the minds of British ministers
when, in June 1800, they granted passports to the two French ships
as ships of discovery. And they were in the minds of the Directors
of the East India Company when they voted &pound;600 for the table-money
of Flinders and his officers&mdash;"this voyage being within the
limits of the Company's Charter." "I hope the French ships will not
station themselves on the North-West coast of Australia," wrote one
of the Company's Directors. And yet, in spite of these fears, there
were intolerable delays. Baudin was away in October 1800. The
<i>Investigator</i> was not ready till April 1802, and in May
Flinders wrote to Banks to express his excessive anxiety to be off,
for "the French are gaining time on us." It was not till July that
he was permitted to sail. It was a race, and Baudin had nine
months' start. If Flinders had enjoyed half that start there would
have been nothing for Baudin to discover in the unknown coast.</p>
<p>But Baudin was a bad racer; in fact he did not race at all. He
made very slow passage to Mauritius, stayed there forty days, and
only reached Cape Leeuwin in May 1801, two hundred and twenty days
after he had sailed from France. Then, as winter was coming, he
thought it best to go North, so he sailed up the Western coast,
making no important discoveries&mdash;the most interesting
discovery was Vlamingh's "flattened pewter
dish"<sup>*</sup>&mdash;and then made for Timor. Here he stayed for
fifty-six days between the 18th of August and the 13th of November,
and then sailed for Dentrecasteaux Channel in South Tasmania. Here
he stayed&mdash;"picking up shells and catching butterflies," one
of his officers complained&mdash;from January to March 1802, when
he made for Bass's Strait, and at last began the exploration of the
unknown coast, or rather the coast which had been unknown before
Grant had discovered part of it in December 1800 and Murray another
part of it in January 1802. What remained undiscovered, when Baudin
entered the Eastern side of Bass's Strait in March 1802, was the
region between the Dutch discovery in 1627 and Grant's discovery of
1800. Baudin, however, had not heard of the discoveries of Grant
and Murray, and his belief was that he still had opportunity to be
discoverer of the whole region from Western Port to Nuytsland. He
commenced his discoveries, then, from Western Port, passed Port
Phillip without seeing it,<sup>**</sup> followed the coast already
discovered by Grant from Cape Otway to Cape Banks, sailed further
Westward along fifty leagues of a particularly desolate shore,
which, he said, scarcely deserved to be visited,<sup>***</sup> and
then, on the 8th of April, met a ship which came from the West, and
which had made very careful survey of the Westward part of the
unknown coast. It was the <i>Investigator</i> under Flinders, who
had sailed nine months after Baudin, but who had nevertheless
discovered nearly the whole of the "unknown coast" that remained
unknown, and who would have discovered the whole but for an unlucky
Easterly wind which had kept him back, while it blew Baudin forward
to discover the fifty leagues of sterile coast, which were the
French portion.<sup>****</sup></p>

<p class="note">[**** When Flinders and Baudin met in Sydney a
chart of the South coast was shown to Baudin, which defined the
limits of his discovery. "Ah, Captain," remarked Freycinet, "if we
had not been kept so long picking up shells and catching
butterflies at Van Diemen's Land, you would not have discovered the
South coast before us."</p>
]
<p>Flinders had sailed from London in July 1801, when Baudin was
sailing the West coast of New Holland. He saw Cape Leeuwin in
December, having made the voyage in one hundred and forty-one days.
Thence he sailed along the utterly barren Southern coast which had
been charted by the Dutch in 1627, and by the French in 1792. He
reached the limit of the Dutch discovery at the Bay which he called
Fowler's Bay, and the neighbouring islands of St. Peter and St.
Francis. All the region between these points and Western Port was,
so far as Flinders then knew, unknown coast; and, as we have
noticed, its unknownness was made singularly attractive by a
problem which had puzzled geographers for more than a century and a
half. Flinders knew no better than Tasman had known whether the
coast he was following would run South-Eastward for Bass's Strait,
or Northward for the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was on the verge of
solving what was probably the last great question of Australian
coast geography, and the inclination was to expect that the
solution would come in the form of a channel or channels that would
either halve Australia, or cut her to pieces.</p>
<p>On the 20th of February, 1802, Flinders seemed on the edge of
this solution. A strong tide was noticed from the North-Eastward,
and the land ran to the North. There was talk that evening about
"large rivers, deep inlets, island seas and passages into the Gulf
of Carpentaria, and the prospect of making an interesting discovery
seemed to have infused new life and vigour into every man in the
ship." Flinders named a beautiful harbour Port Lincoln, "in honour
of my native province," and sailed away to the North on a passage
that might end in the Gulf of Carpentaria. But it soon became clear
that they were sailing, not in a strait, but in a gulf&mdash;a gulf
that proved to be one hundred and eighty-five miles long, and
forty-eight miles in width at the mouth. The trip had to be
finished in a rowing boat, which they rowed till their oars stuck
in the mud. They had reached the head of the Gulf&mdash;which
Flinders called Spencer's Gulf&mdash;"then a region of mangrove
swamps and flat water, but now covered by the wharves of Port
Augusta, and within view of the starting point of the
trans-continental railway."<sup>*</sup> Then Flinders discovered
Kangaroo Island, discovered and explored the Gulf of St. Vincent,
and was proceeding Eastward when, on the 8th of April, the man at
the masthead said he saw a white rock, which proved to be the sail
of the <i>G&eacute;ographe</i> under Baudin. After friendly and
interesting conversations with Baudin, he went on his way,
discovered on the 27th of April Port Phillip, which had been missed
by Baudin, but had been discovered by Murray ten weeks
before&mdash;and reached Sydney on the 8th of May, "in better
health than on the day we sailed from Spithead, and not in less
good spirits." The homesick Sydney people said that they had never
been so strongly reminded of England as by the fresh colour of the
seamen.</p>

<br>
<b>68. SKETCH FROM FLINDERS' MAP OF AUSTRALIA</b></p>
<p>Thus the facts which completed the discovery of Australia are
quite clear, and they were quite clearly expressed in Flinders'
maps. Cook discovered the coast Northward from Point Hicks. Bass
discovered the coast from Point Hicks to Western Port. Grant
discovered the coast from Cape Banks to Western Port, save Port
Phillip which was discovered by Murray, and rediscovered ten weeks
later by FIinders. Baudin discovered the fifty leagues of "sterile
waste" between Cape Banks and Encounter Bay, where he encountered
Flinders.<sup>*</sup> And Flinders discovered the coast from
Fowler's Bay to Encounter Bay. These facts were correctly and fully
given in Flinders' maps, save that he omitted to mark Murray's
discovery of Port Phillip.</p>
<p class="note">[* "The Terre Napol&eacute;on," writes Flinders, "is
therefore comprised between Latitude 37&deg; 36' and 35&deg; 40' South, and
the Longitudes 140&deg; 10', and 138&deg; 58' East of Greenwich; making
with the windings, about fifty leagues of coast, in which, as
Captain Baudin truly observed, there is neither river, inlet, nor
place of shelter; nor does even the worst part of Nuytsland exceed
it in sterility" (Voyage, vol. i. p. 201).]</p>
<p>This is the end of our story of discovery, though one regrets to
end it in full view of events so full of interest. One would have
liked to follow the rest of Baudin's unhappy voyage, and especially
to notice the long holiday spent in Sydney, which gave P&eacute;ron, the
patriotic scientist, opportunity to write the most interesting
description of the colony in its early days, and also to consider
plans by which, when due time came, the French might "destroy it as
soon as possible"&mdash;an exploit, reported Lieutenant Freycinet,
which would be "very easy to accomplish since the English have
neglected every species of means of defence." And one would have
liked also&mdash;had not Professor Scott already done this with
full equipment of learning and argument&mdash;to discuss the maps
which the French men of science constructed, when they were safe in
France, and when Flinders was safe in Mauritius!&mdash;maps which,
ignoring all discoveries by Grant, Murray and Flinders, described
the "unknown coast" from Western Port to the limit of the old Dutch
discovery as "Terre Napol&eacute;on."<sup>*</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* Flinders notes that Grant's <i>Voyage in the
Lady Nelson to New South Wales</i> was published in 1803, "five
years previously to M. P&eacute;ron's book; but no more attention was paid
at Paris to Captain Grant's rights than to mine; his discoveries,
though known to M. P&eacute;ron and the French expedition in 1802, being
equally claimed and named by them" (<i>Voyages</i>, vol. i. p.
201).<br>
<br>
Professor Scott has shown that the accusation against the French
geographers that they <i>used</i> Flinders' maps is untrue. Their
excellent maps were generally founded on their own surveys. The
only thing they stole was a survey of Port Phillip, which they
apparently obtained during their stay in Sydney (Scott's <i>Terre
Napol&eacute;on</i>, p. 105 <i>et seq</i>.). Apart from this falsehood,
the charge against them is, not they stole information gained by
the British voyagers, but that they ignored their discoveries, and
thus falsely claimed priority. See Scott's <i>Terre Napol&eacute;on</i>
and <i>Life of Flinders</i>.]</p>
<p>Still more one would have liked to follow the story of Flinders'
life in its bravery and its patience, its tragedy and its triumph.
And, indeed, one is tempted to say that his circumnavigation falls
in some sense within the limits of our scheme. His voyage from
Sydney worked Cook's outline into detail in the North, somewhat as
Bass in his whaleboat had done in the South. Port Curtis and Port
Bowen were discovered. The Barrier Reef was threaded at Flinders'
Passage, though Flinders adds the warning that, if a captain "do
not feel his nerves strong enough to thread the needle, as it is
called, amongst the reefs, while he directs the steerage from the
masthead, I would strongly recommend him not to approach this part
of the coast." He passed Torres Strait by an entrance previously
discovered, and proved that "this most direct passage may be
accomplished in three days," though he hoped to find a still more
direct passage in the following year.<sup>*</sup> He remarks,
however, that a passage in the opposite direction "has not to my
knowledge, been attempted; and I have some doubt of its
practicability...The experiment is too hazardous for any except a
ship on discovery."<sup>**</sup></p>
<p class="note">[* On the 28th of August, 1791, Capt. Edwards of
the <i>Pandora</i>, seeking passage through Torres Strait, sent a
boat to examine an opening in the reef. The boat made signal for a
passage being found, but, before the <i>Pandora</i> could sail it,
she drifted upon the reef, and sank. The crew sailed in four boats
to Timor (Flinders, vol. i. p. xvi). Flinders sailed through the
<i>Pandora's Entrance</i> (vol. ii. p. 107) at 6 a.m., 29th
October, and could have cleared Torres Strait before dusk on the
31st (vol. ii. p. 126).]</p>
<p class="note">[** <i>Voyage</i>, vol. ii. p. 294.]</p>
<p>Then he began the careful survey of the Gulf coasts. But the
rottenness of the ship became evident. In Torres Strait she had
leaked ten to fourteen inches an hour, and the carpenter now
reported that in twelve months "there would scarcely be a sound
timber in her." The best he could say was that, if the weather was
always fine, and no accident happened, she might run six months
longer. To Flinders it was bitter disappointment. His "leading
object" had been to make so accurate an investigation of the shores
of Terra Australis that no further voyage to this country should be
necessary. And now already he had to plan a return. However, there
was a chance that the rotten ship might float six months, if, in an
almost unknown sea, the weather were always fine, and accidents
never happened. So Flinders sailed, with studious carefulness, all
round the Gulf; proved that in the North of Terra Australis, as in
the South, there was no big channel, that Tasman's map of 1644 was
no fairy tale, but roughly the truth; corrected important details,
discovered important islands, sailed to Timor, where he once more
met Baudin, and thence made for Port Jackson, with ship so "decayed
both in skin and bone," that a severe gale would have crushed her
like an egg.</p>
<p>At Sydney the <i>Investigator</i> was examined, and Flinders
noticed thirteen timbers close together, "through any one of which
a cane might have been thrust." Even he had to admit that the ship
was "incapable of further service," save as "a store-house hulk."
No other ship could be found that could even pretend ability to
explore. So he sailed for England, was wrecked a week later on
Wreck-Reef Bank, and, leaving eighty seamen on that desolate
sand-bank, he, with fourteen comrades, rowed the seven hundred
miles to Sydney in an open boat of thirty-two feet. Then he sailed
for England in the <i>Cumberland</i>, a schooner that was
"something less than a Gravesend passage boat, being only of
twenty-nine tons burden"; and her small size was not her worst
defect. But he wished to get home quickly "to commence the outfit
of another ship"; and he also felt "some ambition of being the
first to undertake so long a journey in such a small vessel." But
the <i>Cumberland</i> could not run the journey. He was forced to
call at the Mauritius for inevitable repairs&mdash;for the ship
grew so leaky that the pump had to be worked almost continually,
day and night. And there he was prisoned for six and a half years,
while French scientists made the false maps which labelled his
discoveries "Terre Napol&eacute;on." Then he was released, and returned to
England in 1810, with mind unchanged, but sick in body and poor in
purse. "Morning, noon, and night," he sat close at his writings and
at his charts, and his wife laid the first copy of the book on his
bed the day before he died. "But he never understood, he was fast
wrapped in the deep slumber that preceded the end."<sup>*</sup></p>
