  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">This electronic edition of <i>A Pulpit in the Grill Room</i>
  was compiled from two sources.</p>

  <p class="note">Eight of the ten stories were extracted by Colin Choat from
  digital image files of the issues of <i>The Australian Women's Weekly</i> in
  which they were published in 1938 and 1939. These files are available at
  <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/aww">Trove</a>, the web site of the National
  Library of Australia. Digitally-restored covers of, and illustrations from,
  these issues of the magazine have been included. The first story in the
  series begins with an introductory text which appeared as a separate foreword
  in the print edition of the book.</p>

  <p class="note">Thanks and credit for supplying the remaining two stories go
  to Gary Meller, Florida, who made digital image files from his first-edition
  copy of <i>A Pulpit in the Grill Room</i> and donated them for inclusion in
  the present PGA and RGL editions.</p>

  <p class="first">IN view of the many curious adventures for which his unique
  appointment was largely responsible, Louis has asked me to explain exactly
  how it came to pass that he was first placed in that very exceptional
  position.</p>

  <p>In 1914, after seven years' service in London's most famous Grill Room, he
  threw up his very lucrative position and departed for France. In 1919 he
  limped back from the war with two crutches and many medals. He limped as far
  as Paris and looked enviously at the gay scenes in the caf&eacute;s, and thought
  that for him all that was ended. Later he returned to England and presented
  himself at the Milan.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

  </div>

  <p>"I have called because you asked me to, sir," he said to Sir Edward
  Rastall, chairman of the company. "There is nothing I can do for you. though.
  A ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel on crutches could scarcely get through an hour's work a
  week."</p>

  <p>Sir Edward took him by the arm and led him across the court to the Grill
  Room entrance. It was five o'clock in the afternoon, and the place was empty.
  Louis, who had turned his head away as he drove up in his taxi to the front
  entrance of the hotel, looked sorrowfully at that fascinating wilderness of
  white linen and sparkling glass.</p>

  <p>Every one of those private corners, vantage places from which one could
  see and not be seen, and those other more flamboyant tables plumped down in
  full view of everybody, mostly in demand by the fair sex, brought their own
  peculiar memories. If he had been alone, his eyes would soon have been
  dim.</p>

  <p>"Louis," his companion said, "do you know why we thought you worth two
  thousand a year to us before the war?"</p>

  <p>"Because I was reasonably good at my job, I hope, sir." the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"That, of course; but there are hundreds of others who are good at their
  jobs. You had what we thought a flair for placing your patrons. You see all
  those tables? It would take a diplomat to deal with the streams of people you
  had to deal with, to offend no one and please those who were worth pleasing.
  You did it, Louis. I have watched you sometimes&mdash;the plan in your hand,
  a speculative look in your eyes, a welcoming smile always there. You never
  made a mistake. Then, of course, just before the war the other thing came.
  You began to be a useful man for your adopted country, long before the first
  shot of the war was fired."</p>

  <p>"Strange things have happened here." Louis reflected.</p>

  <p>"And stranger things may come." Sir Edward commented gravely. "Ii you will
  turn your head, you will see that we have done away with that ridiculous
  little bar, and made what seems to be a low pulpit just inside the revolving
  doors."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering what that was for, Sir Edward." Louis acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"It is for you, my lad."</p>

  <p>"What on earth could I do there?"</p>

  <p>"Go on earning your two thousand a year, of course." was the prompt reply.
  "Every day you will have a fresh plan of the room, and all correspondence
  with regard to the ordering of tables will be handed to you. You know the
  weaknesses of every one of our habitues. You will study them and you will
  know exactly which clients to encourage and which we are better without. You
  will sit in your easy-chair there, watch the people come in, and seat them at
  your discretion. They will be satisfied&mdash;that is, if we want them to be
  satisfied&mdash;and you will continue to draw your two thousand a year. A few
  more details later on. You start on Monday.'"</p>

  <p>Sir Edward waved his hand and hurried away to avoid what he hated most in
  life&mdash;thanks. Monday morning found Louis ensconced in the easy-chair
  that later on was to become historical.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I SUPPOSE that I, Charles Lyson, late of His Majesty's Army,
  and now a freelance journalist, with still more serious interests, was one of
  the most regular patrons of the famous Grill Room at the Milan Hotel, and I
  had grown, after the first few days, just as accustomed to seeing Louis in
  his new position inside the room as I was to receiving that cheerful good
  morning of the concierge in the hall. This particular morning, however, was
  the first time that I had ever seen him show signs of agitation.</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and arrested my progress into the room.</p>

  <p>"You have chanced to notice who is lunching here to-day, Captain Lyson?"
  he asked in that peculiarly distinct, clear voice of his. It dropped almost
  to a whisper sometimes, yet it was always audible.</p>

  <p>"The usual crowd." I answered. "Indications also that the boat-train from
  Southampton was in early. Another all-conquering film party, I think."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled. It always astonished me that a man with so waxen a
  complexion and such set features should yet possess so sensitive an
  expression. Notwithstanding the smile. I knew that trouble was in the
  air.</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a kindness?" he begged. "Walk from here the whole length
  of the Grill Room and then return, casting a glance, perhaps, at the table
  set against the far wall on the left-hand side."</p>

  <p>Mystified, but with too much confidence in Louis to hesitate for a moment,
  I obeyed his suggestion. On my return I loitered by his chair. He knew at
  once that my journey had not been fruitless.</p>

  <p>"If you could pay me a brief visit in my room at five o'clock, it would
  give me great pleasure," he invited.</p>

  <p>I nodded acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"More like the old wolf than ever." I remarked in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"I was looking elsewhere when he entered," Louis confided. "I think that I
  must have smelt the gunpowder as he passed. I lifted my head and
  behold&mdash;it was he!"</p>

  <p>"And Madame?"</p>

  <p>"And the whole outfit." Louis murmured under his breath. "At five o'clock
  then."</p>

  <p>I took the hint and moved on. I knew now what had brought the frown to
  Louis' face, and the look of trouble into his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Administration of the Milan Hotel and Restaurant owed much to Louis,
  the Guardian Angel of the Grill Room, and did their best to prove their
  grateful appreciation. In addition to his large salary and very considerable
  benefices, always the recognised blood money of the man who wields the table
  plan of a famous restaurant&mdash;as well as being entrusted with the buying
  of the choice wines and specialities offered by the establishment&mdash;Louis
  possessed the only small flat on the ground floor of the court, the outside
  door of which, although few ever knew of its existence, was barely a dozen
  yards from his daily post of vantage.</p>

  <p>It was there that I sought him at five minutes to five that afternoon and
  found, to my great satisfaction, his only daughter, Mademoiselle Julie
  Duchesne, just returned from a matinee, smoking a cigarette, and sipping a
  glass of vermouth.</p>

  <p>"Never tell me again that Friday the thirteenth is an unlucky day!" I
  exclaimed, taking off my gloves and making for the divan upon which she was
  seated.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Charles," she said, waving me away with a little grimace,
  "to-day there are to be no frivolities. That dear father of mine awaits you
  impatiently. I am not to detain you for a single moment."</p>

  <p>I obeyed her gesture and passed at once into the inner room. Louis was
  seated before his desk, and motioned me to the chair by his side.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, please, Captain Lyson," he invited. "We were right this
  morning. The old wolf has come to life. You saw him for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Amazing!"</p>

  <p>"There is no other word," Louis acquiesced. "For months he lies in his
  chaise-longue like a lizard aching for the sunshine, breathing feebly, like
  one for whom life is passing, pale as a ghost, with those hollow eyes of his
  empty of all light. Then suddenly, where it comes from Heaven only knows, but
  he hears something. The rustling of a torn treaty destroyed by angry fingers,
  a cry of triumph from a savant in his laboratory, the clash of threatening
  voices or perhaps the dull booming of a new gun across an empty plain.</p>

  <p>"He raises his tired old head and sniffs. Battle is coming! War is at
  hand. Thousands may be leaving their homes and marching to fill the
  cemeteries. His laden ships in this port or that&mdash;Heaven knows
  where&mdash;wake to life. His agents are at work. The cheques roll into his
  bank. The great snowball has started. A few more millions for the old man, a
  few more thousands of stone crosses in the cemetery."</p>

  <p>I listened to Louis in amazement. Never in the fifteen years of our
  acquaintance had I heard him speak quite so bitterly. Apparently he regretted
  his emotion, for he shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"A waste of time, this," he concluded. "Forgive me. He has come to life
  again, but he goes still with a price upon his head...Would you mind glancing
  at this for a moment?"</p>

  <p>I stood by his side, looking down upon the plan of the Grill Room.</p>

  <p>"The Chevalier has demanded the same table to-night for dinner, and we are
  to arrange for three people, one, we are given to understand, a most
  important guest. To that, of course, we have acquiesced with pleasure. He
  wishes also, however, to reserve the table on either side of him. Our reply
  has been that number eight, which is the one nearer the main passageway, is
  at his service, but number six is engaged by a most particular client."</p>

  <p>"The particular client?"</p>

  <p>"Being yourself."</p>

  <p>"With a companion?"</p>

  <p>"With the most attractive of the many young ladies of your acquaintance.
  Understand me, please. You refuse to give up your table. It is a matter of
  sentiment. I shall have to rely upon you, Jules the wine waiter and Antoine
  the ma&icirc;tre d'hotel, who can only pass backwards and forwards at intervals, to
  bring me the scraps of information I desire&mdash;not for myself, naturally,
  but to pass on to Whitehall."</p>

  <p>I must confess that I felt a lack of inspiration about the affair. A few
  chance words picked up at a feast presided over by the Chevalier were
  scarcely likely to lead one far. Louis smiled reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"No one expects impossibilities," he assured me. "You have to listen for
  two things, and two things only&mdash;the names of steamers and the names of
  ports. We have certain information that the Chevalier, during the last twelve
  months, has purchased and paid cash for three steamers&mdash;each one of
  which has been secretly loaded with guns and ammunition. He is over here now
  to dispose of them. It is our Job, Captain Lyson, to make his task as
  difficult as possible."</p>

  <p>I helped myself to a cigarette from Louis' box.</p>

  <p>"It depends, of course, where they are lying at the present moment," I
  observed, "otherwise I think it would be difficult for him to move those
  ships into any port if war were threatened."</p>

  <p>"Threatened&mdash;no. Declared yes," was the somewhat cryptic answer. "The
  Chevalier knows every move in the game. He knows every law and by-law. He
  knows the easiest ports and the impossible ones. There are harbor masters who
  live upon his dole."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you another thing about him if you like," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"He has a voice which one can only describe as flutelike. He seldom raises
  it above a whisper, and yet If you are near enough you hear everything. I
  think you are expecting a great deal, Louis, if you believe that what I shall
  overhear of any conversation to-night will be of practical use."</p>

  <p>"It is not only words that speak," he pointed out, leaning back in his
  chair. "At that dinner there will be the Chevalier, the Comtesse de Roussilon
  his niece, and a stranger. The stranger will be the man who may buy. Bien.
  You will remark whether the Chevalier is a man for whom things are going well
  or whether he is disappointed. You will make your own comments, too, upon
  Madame's attitude. Something may be learnt from the stranger, who, if he is
  of the nationality I suspect, is not likely to be so skilled as the other two
  in concealing his feelings. In addition, do not forget that the name of a
  port, the name of a ship, the make of a gun&mdash;any one of those&mdash;may
  serve to light the way. It is only by piecing together small things that one
  is able to attempt the great coup."</p>

  <p>"You are a genius, Louis," I acknowledged. "Dinner will be?"</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"But wait," I begged him, as he stretched out his hand for one of his
  crutch-like sticks. "I have not an unlimited acquaintance among trustworthy
  young women with personal attractions. How do I know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought that would be it," he interrupted with a pleasant smile.
  "Fortunately, you are one of the few men in the world whom I can trust. I
  think that if you approach Julie you will find that she has no engagement for
  this evening. She has also very good ears and a sound idea of the game."</p>

  <p>"The affair," I admitted cheerfully, "begins to present a more attractive
  appearance."</p>

  <p>The service of dinner that evening was rather more than half accomplished
  when my high spirits and my appetite simultaneously waned. The sickly coils
  of a grim suspicion had strangled both. I waited for a safe moment, then I
  leaned across towards my vis-&agrave;-vis.</p>

  <p>"Julie," I confided, "I have a fear."</p>

  <p>"And I, too," she agreed. "They suspect us. The Comtesse has twice turned
  her head. The old man broke off just now in the middle of a sentence."</p>

  <p>I took up the wine card and discussed for some minutes with our attentive
  sommelier the relative merits of a Berncastler Doctor a trifle too young and
  an older, mellower Piesporter. While I waited for the man's opinion, I
  glanced once more, casually, but still with an interest I found it Impossible
  altogether to conceal, at that small party of three at the next table. The
  heavy, pale-faced man with the black moustache and restless manner, the
  obvious guest, had glanced suspiciously more than once in our direction. He
  held his fat white hand too often at the side of his lips when he addressed
  his host. Madame said nothing unless she leaned right across the table, yet
  their voices now and then were almost unduly raised. I sighed as I handed
  back the wine list, and decided in favor of the Piesporter...After all, what
  did it matter? For once I had failed Louis. All that could be said in our
  favor was that we had learnt when to close our eyes and ears to a great deal
  of very tempting misguidance. Avonmouth, Poole&mdash;at least half a dozen
  times I heard the names of these ports whispered. Yet the mist of unreality
  hung over it all. We were listening for truths that never came...</p>

  <p>"Be the holy, but it's himself himself that's found his way to the great
  city!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden, almost violent change in the atmosphere of
  artificiality by which we had been surrounded. The voice of the man who had
  paused at the next table was full of genuine surprise, his heartiness a real
  thing.</p>

  <p>"It's meself that's glad to see ye," he went on, addressing the Chevalier.
  "'Tis a pity the young lady can't bring a little color into her cheeks down
  in them hot countries."</p>

  <p>There was no necessity for any further disguise on our parts. A dozen
  people besides ourselves had turned round at the sound of that rolling voice
  with its not unmusical brogue and, to be honest, mellowed by just the
  slightest trace of alcoholism.</p>

  <p>"Shure, ye never paid us the visit ye promised," the newcomer went on,
  shaking his head reproachfully at the Comtesse. "We've had a hearty wilcome
  waitin' for ye but niver a sign o' ye or the ould gintle man. It's threatin'
  us badly, ye've been."</p>

  <p>The Chevalier had shrunk back a little against the wall. The cold fury in
  his eyes would certainly have driven away any ordinary intruder. The Comtesse
  began to talk. She laid her hand upon the visitor's sleeve, and his swing
  round towards her gave us a better view. The man was a stranger to me, but
  without doubt an original. He must have been six foot three at least and
  broad&mdash;large everywhere&mdash;in proportion. His cheeks were crimson,
  his deep-set blue eyes moist. There were spots of perspiration upon his
  forehead. He was wearing a roughly made suit of grey tweed, out of shape as
  though he had been travelling in it all night, and his hair was of that dull
  shade of flaming red which defies all efforts of tonsorial restraint. The
  coldness of his reception seemed to astonish him.</p>

  <p>"But what's the mather wid me having a word wid the ould gintle man?" he
  demanded of the Comtesse. "He had plinty to say that last time in Paris, and
  when he rode round me own bit of a harbor in a motor launch. We have had
  important doings togither great business that maybe he has niver told ye
  anything about, Countess. Ye wouldn't have me pass him by without a
  word?"</p>

  <p>"My uncle," the lady explained eagerly, "is Just recovering from a severe
  illness. He is not allowed to hold conversations with anyone about
  business.</p>

  <p>"Leave this to me, Mr. O'Grady," she begged. "We will go into the hall and
  listen to the music for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>An immense smile broke across the man's face. He looked down at the
  Comtesse in undisguised admiration. For the first time he lowered his voice
  and we gathered only the sense of what he said. He passed willingly away,
  however, with the fingers of his companion resting upon his arm. They turned
  to the left and made their way towards the foyer. Julie leaned across the
  table and whispered in my ear.</p>

  <p>"I think if I could only change places with the Comtesse for a few moments
  he would tell me all we want to know," she confided, gazing wistfully after
  the two departing figures.</p>

  <p>I had to be content with frowning my disapproval. The opportune moment for
  my own intervention had arrived. I pushed back my chair and approached the
  table which had been the centre of the disturbance. The Chevalier, his face a
  white arid wan mask, expressionless except for those deep-set steely eyes, in
  themselves a sea of trouble, had shrunk a little back in his chair, his hands
  folded in front of him, his long fingers fidgeting nervously with the
  marvellous black opal, strangely set, in his famous signet-ring. Opposite
  him, the man whom we had put down as the possible buyer of armaments was
  tugging furiously at his black moustache and brandishing an oblong strip of
  paper in his hand. There was a queer, abrupt silence as I presented myself. I
  addressed the Chevalier.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," I said, "may I beg to recall myself to your recollection? My
  name is Lyson&mdash;Captain Lyson. We met several times in Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>To my surprise, he recognised me at once. No words of description could
  adequately convey the frigidity of his tone.</p>

  <p>"I remember perfectly well," he acknowledged. "What I do not understand is
  your impertinent interest in myself and my niece."</p>

  <p>I felt a momentary sensation of panic, but I crushed it so far as I was
  able.</p>

  <p>"You would have the whole world crowding round your table if they knew who
  'you were," I reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he demanded icily.</p>

  <p>"I can only repeat what the newspapers have been saying for many years.
  You are a man of mystery&mdash;just the type the man in the street wants to
  know about. You are supposed to be worth countless millions, and to have sunk
  nearly the whole of it year by year in buying guns, rifles and the
  appurtenances of war. War is the great dramatic force of the world.</p>

  <p>"Foul melodrama," the Chevalier said, with a thin quiver in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," I assented. "I am a brave man, however, when I am in search of
  news, and I have the instinct for anything which will attract the
  masses&mdash;the millions who read the Sunday papers. For the last few weeks
  there have been rumors of war. Here are you away from your beloved villa, out
  of your invalid chair&mdash;here waiting, listening for something or other.
  Grant me an interview, Chevalier, and you will soon be free of me."</p>

  <p>"Very slowly, very gracefully, her eyebrows raised in faint curiosity, the
  tremor of a smile upon her lips, Madame la Comtesse returned alone.</p>

  <p>"So you have ventured to come and talk to this most unsociable uncle of
  mine, Captain Lyson," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"I wanted him to give me an interview for my paper," I told her frankly.
  "I am afraid I've only succeeded in making him angry."</p>

  <p>"Your continued presence," the Chevalier said coldly, "is of course a
  matter of taste. I have never willingly given an interview to a Journalist in
  my life, and I never shall. When I leave this room it will be to make a
  formal complaint to the manager."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't if I were you," I advised him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" he asked grimly.</p>

  <p>"Retaliation," I pointed out, "would be so easy. One, at least, of the
  newspapers to-morrow morning would be wondering why, with all these
  mutterings of coming war, you should be found in the grill-room of an
  hotel&mdash;which, although it may be the best in the world, is also a hotbed
  of intrigue&mdash;entertaining the Prime Minister," I added with a little bow
  to the sallow gentleman with the black moustache, "of a country which is
  aching to make war, but starving at the same time for the means of making it.
  And why the sudden appearance of that red faced, smooth-tongued Irishman
  should have broken up your party&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was in the Chevalier's grim visage, as he looked for a few seconds
  steadily at me, the one desire in life which is unmistakable&mdash;the desire
  to kill. I knew very well that there were corners of the world into which we
  both had penetrated where hundreds would have been ready to obey his will,
  and my life would not have been worth a moment's purchase.</p>

  <p>"I think," the Comtesse whispered, "you had better go. My uncle is not
  strong, and he has had enough excitement for this evening."</p>

  <p>"My niece is right," the Chevalier assented. "You had better go, young
  man. You may take your melodramatic trash to any newspaper you like, but I
  promise you this&mdash;the paper that prints it will not last another week.
  Tell them that when you hand in your copy, if you have the courage. One week.
  It takes men of courage to go to war; but newspapers can be bought. As for
  Journalists&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Chevalier went suddenly dumb. His lips for a few seconds seemed glued
  together. The Comtesse touched my hand with icy fingers.</p>

  <p>"Please go," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Julie greeted me on my return to our table with a smile half amused, half
  sympathetic. We drank to one another across the table.</p>

  <p>"What did you say to make him so furious?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I sampled the last glass of the Piesporter and found it as good as the
  first. I allowed myself one more glance at the adjoining table whilst I was
  signing my bill.</p>

  <p>"I was giving him the Journalistic point of view," I explained. "I am just
  beginning to realise what that little party means. The arch-butcher of the
  world, the man who has sunk millions in the purchase of every sort of weapon
  of destruction, his vis-&agrave;-vis the Prime Minister of a country whose rulers
  are groaning for the means to arm their troops, the most beautiful woman who
  was ever born in Provence, and a red-haired vulgarian who came and went like
  an exotic thunderstorm."</p>

  <p>Julie laughed gaily, yet underneath it all I knew that she was thinking.
  Those little lines on her delicate forehead meant inspiration. The sparkle in
  her eyes remained after the laugh itself had passed.</p>

  <p>"I have the great idea, Charles," she exclaimed, rising to her feet. "We
  leave now. We report progress. You are clever, my friend, but even you have
  not the brain of the old one. All worth knowing that has passed at that table
  against the wall attaches itself to the coming and going of the large man
  with the untidy clothes and red hair. What has she done with him, I wonder,
  that little Comtesse?"</p>

  <p>"We will consult the old one," I agreed.</p>

  <p>The pulpit, as everyone called Louis' high-backed easy-chair, was empty. A
  ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, who had evidently been on the look out for us, hurried
  up.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Louis has left us for the evening," he announced. "He would be
  glad to see Monsieur in his room."</p>

  <p>We made our way there. Louis was seated at his desk, his crutches leaning
  against its side, and the small carriage which he used for longer journeys
  was up against the wall. A directory with a green cover was open in front of
  him. He closed it hastily on our arrival and replaced it in his drawer.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"A bad night, Louis," I confessed. "I don't know quite where we went
  wrong, but somehow or other we gave ourselves away."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Alas," Julie intervened, "it was unmistakable. All the time we spoke
  softly, I made the google eyes at Charles here and he did his best, poor man,
  to respond. It was not a very good best!"</p>

  <p>"I am too sincere," I ventured. Louis frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>"I only want facts Just now," he reminded us. "Something gave you away.
  What happened then?"</p>

  <p>"They seemed to change the whole tone of their conversation. They
  pretended to be whispering, but it was a whisper we were meant to hear. They
  pretended never to look at us, and all the time we could scarcely fail to see
  their stealthy glances. The Comtesse would touch the Chevalier's elbow and
  move her head slightly in our direction. Once she touched her lips with her
  fingers. It all became too obvious. They wrote down the names of the places
  and then whispered others so that we could hear. Avonmouth they spoke of
  oftenest. Plymouth, Poole, Guernsey and Lowestoft now and then. All that we
  could gather was that there were some ships somewhere which could be moved If
  the money were forthcoming."</p>

  <p>"There was no interruption?" Louis asked. "No visitor to their table?"</p>

  <p>"But certainly there was&mdash;a queer one, too," Julie replied.</p>

  <p>He motioned her to keep silent. His eyes were still fixed upon mine.</p>

  <p>"They were accosted by a man," I confided, "whose presence I believe was a
  great embarrassment to them. This time I do not think they were acting. They
  hated his coming, and finally the Comtesse took him off."</p>

  <p>"You know who he was?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," I confessed. "He was a big man, dressed in ill-fitting
  grey clothes and indifferent linen. He had a tousled mass of red hair, a
  typical South of Ireland face, and a mouth like a bulldog's. Incidentally, he
  spoke with a strong Irish brogue."</p>

  <p>"What was your impression," Louis asked softly, "of the relations existing
  between this unwelcome visitor and the other three?"</p>

  <p>"The guest at the table seemed simply surprised. The Chevalier was
  furious. The Comtesse a little afraid at first&mdash;afterwards all over the
  fellow. It was she who took him away."</p>

  <p>"Where to?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," I admitted. "They just turned to the left and made their
  way towards the grand foyer. She had the air of one who was humoring a person
  whom it was necessary to get rid of. I am inclined to think that his Irish
  accent and his excitable state were neither of them assumed."</p>

  <p>Louis nodded thoughtfully. For some reason or other his attention seemed
  to have wandered. Even I, who was used to his moods, found his present one
  incomprehensible. He had the appearance of one who had precipitated his
  thoughts almost into another world. When at last I broke the silence, he
  seemed for a moment dazed, surprised to find me waiting by his side.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid some way or other, Louis," I confessed, "we made a mess of
  things. I'm sorry, but there it is. Our little effort at espionage was a
  failure."</p>

  <p>Louis pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not entirely," he began hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Then let us find out where the Comtesse has taken the man with the red
  hair," Julie broke in. "We can easily discover that."</p>

  <p>I looked expectantly at Louis. There was never anything more definite in
  the world than his shake of the head.</p>

  <p>"For to-night it is finished, Julie," he pronounced. "We will even ask for
  your adieux, little one. You must leave us quickly, please."</p>

  <p>With a fascinating whisk of her draperies, she left the room. Louis
  motioned to the chair over which I had been leaning.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Capitaine," he said, "I am sorry if I disappoint you, but
  this affair to which I have introduced you is finished."</p>

  <p>"Have I made such a mess of it as all that?" I complained.</p>

  <p>"I will not pay you compliments," Louis replied, "because it is by chance
  that you have become the man who has moved the mountain. You have involved
  yourself in a business, however, which is too great for you, and too
  dangerous. I have been in communication with our Chief. He is on his way down
  here."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you are going to chuck me?" I asked in astonishment. "I
  have a theory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Keep it to yourself," Louis advised earnestly. "The next step is not far
  away, but men will lose their lives before it is taken. You are not a
  militant, nowadays, Lyson. You are one of the most useful members of our
  circle; but this affair which approaches is one of life and death, and the
  chances are something like five to one in favor of death. The Chief will know
  how to deal with it."</p>

  <p>This was the time I became obstinate.</p>

  <p>"Louis," I argued, "wherever this enterprise may lead, I have a great
  advantage over anyone else who might be handling it. I am a genuine newspaper
  man. I am working for my Journal. I am seeking news. If the Chief sends any
  of his ordinary staff&mdash;even the Scotland Yard branch&mdash;if they are
  discovered they have no motive but one, and you know what will happen to them
  if this is such an affair as I believe it is. I am about the only person who
  can walk into it without serious risk."</p>

  <p>I had given Louis matter for thought. He made no immediate answer.</p>

  <p>"You shall plead your own case," he decided. "The Chief is on his way
  here."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;through the hotel&mdash;here?" I asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not quite. We have several private ways into this room, and there is one
  by which no one ever travels except the Chief. Do me a service quickly,
  please. Slip through and close the entrance door to the flat and, If Julie is
  still about, tell her to go at once to her room&mdash;as quickly as possible,
  if you please."</p>

  <p>Within sixty seconds I had passed through the adjoining salon and bolted
  the door, pushed back the curtain leading to the domestic side of the flat,
  pointed along it, kissed Julie good-night, and was back again in Louis' study
  in time to see the left door of the dummy fire-escape open and the real
  mystery man of the English Secret Service make his unobtrusive entrance.</p>

  <p>The newcomer waved his hand and motioned Louis to resume his seat. He
  looked at me searchingly, but offered no greeting&mdash;a fact which caused
  me no embarrassment because I knew his habits.</p>

  <p>"You are Lyson, aren't you?" he said quietly. "I have your record. What
  about this effort of yours in Journalism?"</p>

  <p>"I have found it of the greatest assistance to me in two cases," I
  replied. "It gives me a definite entree into places where my interference
  might otherwise cause suspicion."</p>

  <p>"It remains in the background as compared with your other activities?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Entirely," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I understand from Louis' message that you saw
  something of the Chevalier tonight. Tell me what happened."</p>

  <p>I repeated as briefly as possible what I had confided to Louis.</p>

  <p>"Did you take particular notice of the man with the tousled red hair?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I did, sir.'</p>

  <p>"Do you know who he was?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

  <p>My questioner smiled faintly, then he glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You live upon the premises, I understand. Captain Lyson," he said. "Go
  and pack your bag and return here in twenty minutes. Louis will then hand you
  your instructions."</p>

  <p>"Passport?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You will be crossing to Ireland," was the brief reply. "I always like to
  encourage the young, Captain Lyson," my Chief went on, with a slight smile.
  "Your observations of this evening have helped us to decide a very knotty
  point. You will know all about it a little later on."</p>

  <p>He made the smallest possible gesture of his head towards the door. I
  hurried out. An hour and a half later I was seated in a comfortable corner of
  a first-class carriage in the Irish Mall on my way to Holyhead.</p>

  <p>The man with the tousled red hair and the exuberant manner, who had
  accosted the Chevalier in the grill room of the Milan, appeared to be a very
  different person when I made my bow to him about a Week later in the audience
  chamber of ms official residence in the City of Ballydaghan. He eyed me
  ungraciously when his secretary ushered me into the room, and merely pointed
  with his penholder to a chair opposite to him.</p>

  <p>"An' what can I be do for ye?" the man whom I had come to visit asked
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I sent in my card, sir," I reminded him. "My name is Lyson. I believe I
  have the honor of addressing Mr. Michael O'Grady, Lord Mayor of
  Ballydaghan."</p>

  <p>"Ye have. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Also," I went on, "Mayor of the Harbor City of Daghan."</p>

  <p>He looked at me penetratingly. His eyes were a great deal clearer than
  when I had last seen him, and his whole appearance was more formidable.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"As Mayor of the Harbor City," I continued, "Your Worship has the right to
  admit any craft you choose into the special moorings, wharves and docks
  belonging to the city."</p>

  <p>"An' what business is that of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that," I promised. "You have already admitted and given
  special moorings to three freight steamers&mdash;one English, the
  <i>Idona</i>, and two Norwegian, the <i>Nordicka</i> and the
  <i>Katarette</i>. They lie in the inner basin of wharf number fifteen."</p>

  <p>There was a dangerous glint in the eyes of the Mayor of the Harbor City of
  Daghan as he looked across the table. His right hand had strayed into a half
  open drawer. I knew perfectly well what he was feeling, but I was confident
  that he would not shoot me until he had discovered what my business was.</p>

  <p>"So ye have been spying around me docks?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I found them too closely guarded," I told him. "What I have seen of the
  interior of wharf number fifteen I saw from a small Moth yesterday
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>The Mayor sighed regretfully.</p>

  <p>"I saw ye," he' grunted, "an' if I had had an anti-aircraft gun, it's in
  the basin ye would have been by now."</p>

  <p>"Pity you didn't know," I observed. "The <i>Katarette</i>&mdash;one of the
  Norwegian boats&mdash;is full of them."</p>

  <p>"Will ye be givin' me a chance to say a few words before the funeral?" the
  Mayor of the Harbor City of Daghan demanded.</p>

  <p>"I certainly shall," I assured him "I want to arrive first at a clear
  understanding. You have given free harborage, Your Worship, to at least two
  steamers laden to their utmost capacity with rifles, guns and ammunition, the
  property of a world-famous speculator, who is gambling with his millions on
  the probability of a war in a country where a revolution is already in
  progress."</p>

  <p>"An' why not?" the Mayor demanded. "Why should we be botherin' what sort
  of a cockpit the armament speculators may make of Europe? I am the ruler of
  these parts, an' I have the right to admit what craft I choose into me
  harbor."</p>

  <p>"Who denies it?" I answered. "I may not come here as a philanthropist, but
  I am certainly not a critic. If you will listen to me, Mr Mayor, I can save
  you from a very bitter disappointment."</p>

  <p>He looked at me as though I were something he particularly disliked. I
  knew perfectly well that he would rather throw me out of the room than
  listen. What saved him and me was a vein of natural shrewdness which
  triumphed over his prejudices.</p>

  <p>"Get on with it," he invited.</p>

  <p>So I went on with it. In a very few minutes I had made a full disclosure
  of that curious array of facts passed on to me by my Chief and the head of
  M17B in Louis' flat, during those few breathless moments before my rush to
  Euston.</p>

  <p>With every word I uttered, the excitement of my auditor increased. I had
  finished and he was standing up, with a look of fury on his face and his
  thumb pressed to a bell-push, when he let me know my fate in a few
  blasphemous but convincing words.</p>

  <p>"If it's the truth ye've bin tell in' me, me lad, it's the high spots
  ye'll be reaching. But if it's a lie, ye'll be at the bottom of the harbor
  to-night, and yer own mother wouldn't recognise ye when ye're dragged
  out."</p>

  <p>"It will be the high spots," I assured him.</p>

  <p>An hour later,&mdash;side by side in a very sinister-looking motor boat,
  flying an exceedingly official flag, we made our way in and out of the
  crowded waterways of the harbor to where a single freight steamer&mdash;the
  <i>Nordicka</i>&mdash;flying the Norwegian flag, was lying anchored some
  quarter of a mile from the nearest wharf. I was seated between the Mayor of
  the Harbor City of Daghan and the Harbor-master. Three of the Harbor Police
  occupied the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Will you refer to your papers, Mr. Mayor?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It's not necessary at all," was the gruff reply. "That's the
  <i>Nordicka</i> right enough. Well go aboard her."</p>

  <p>We shot round her hull to the port side. The gangway had been pulled up.
  The Harbor-master blew his whistle and the captain, struggling into his coat,
  made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I'm the Mayor o' the City," the red-haired man called out. "This is the
  Harbor-master and those three are guards. We're comin' aboard Let down yer
  gangway."</p>

  <p>The evidences of authority were irresistible. The man did as he was
  told.</p>

  <p>"What's all this?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I'm goin' to examine yer cargo," the Mayor said. "It's me property, as
  ye're well aware. Where do ye suggest we begin?" he added, glowering at
  me.</p>

  <p>I glanced at a packet of papers I was carrying, and we descended into the
  hold. The place was piled with cases. The Mayor pointed to one.</p>

  <p>"Open that," he ordered.</p>

  <p>The Captain shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I am not allowed to meddle with the cargo," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Ye'll be in prison in an hour it ye don't," was the savage reply. "Them
  three men are Civic Guards and they'll give ye hell if ye don't do as ye're
  told. Here's me Harbor-master, too. Ye won't be disobeying his orders.
  Whatever's inside them cases is my property. Git on wid the job."</p>

  <p>The Captain hesitated no longer. He blew his whistle. The boatswain and
  two seamen arrived, and in a few minutes several carpenters were at work. The
  lids of a dozen cases were soon prised off. The contents of every case
  consisted of a heterogeneous mass of scrap-iron.</p>

  <p>"Try the other side," I suggested. The Mayor, who was getting very red in
  the face, led the way. The same result was arrived at. He held up his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"That's be all," he declared savagely. "Show us the way to yer cabin,
  Captain."</p>

  <p>The cabin was a wooden fracture on the forward deck. The Captain led us
  there, placed a battle of whisky and some glasses upon the table and
  indicated seats. The others remained outside in a little bunch. The Mayor
  helped himself to whisky and pushed the bottle in my direction.</p>

  <p>"Did ye know the nature o' yer cargo?" he asked the Captain.</p>

  <p>"I did," the other answered. "I am not responsible."</p>

  <p>"Ye have yer sailing orders?"</p>

  <p>"Got them last night. I am Commodore, and my orders are to swap places
  with the captain of the <i>Idona</i> and to take her and the <i>Katarette</i>
  out to sea to-night, at the flow of the tide, on a certain course southward.
  I am to open papers for further orders at midnight."</p>

  <p>"An' what will ye be doin' wid this craft here?"</p>

  <p>"She's just got to stop where she is until you have unloaded what may
  belong to you."</p>

  <p>For about five minutes we were entertained by a volume of the most fluent
  and furious swearing I ever heard in my life. As its conclusion, the Mayor of
  the Harbor City of Daghan finished all the whisky that remained in the
  bottle, and called for the launch.</p>

  <p>"And where might the <i>Idona</i> be lying?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"On our starboard beam. Shes getting up steam."</p>

  <p>The Mayor nodded.</p>

  <p>"What might her cargo be?"</p>

  <p>"Machine-guns."</p>

  <p>"Where was she loaded?"</p>

  <p>"Newcastle."</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me, unless yere lookin' for throuble and the devil of a lot
  of it," the Mayor said. "The man that sint ye those orders has no authority
  in these waters. I have. The <i>Nordicka</i> will stay where she is. The rest
  o' ye can git to hell out o' here!"</p>

  <p>The Captain saluted.</p>

  <p>"I'm puttin' a guard on this old hulk," the Mayor went on, rising to his
  feet. "The rest o' ye quit. That's clear? Come on, me lad," he wound up,
  turning to me. "That was a blazin' good idea ye whispered into me ear an hour
  or so ago. We'll see how it works."</p>

  <p>We boarded the <i>Idona</i>, which was lying barely fifty yards away. The
  Master of the <i>Nordicka</i> led us down to the Captain's cabin. The latter,
  who was an Englishman, gazed at us in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I'll be havin' ye know who we are, Captain," the man with the red tousled
  hair said, belligerently. "I am the Mayor of the Harbor City of Daghan.
  That's the Harbormaster behind me and we've the Harbor Police there, too. I
  hear, ye're puttin' out to sea to-night."</p>

  <p>The Captain glanced at the Master of the <i>Nordicka</i> in amazement. The
  latter shook his head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"That's true, sir," he admitted. "I am changing over to the
  <i>Nordicka</i> myself, but the <i>Katarette</i> and the <i>Idona</i> are
  sailing."</p>

  <p>"Hand over the ship's papers," the Mayor demanded. "I am takin' them over
  to the Customs House me self."</p>

  <p>"The ship's papers?"</p>

  <p>"Hand them over and no palaver. Yell get them back when I've done wid
  them," the Mayor promised. "Come on, you lads."</p>

  <p>We made our way to the <i>Katarette</i> and went through the same
  programme. The Captain handed over his papers with obvious reluctance.</p>

  <p>"But at midnight," he protested, "they must be here. We're to sail with
  the tide."</p>

  <p>The Mayor, leading the way into the launch, turned round to the Captain,
  who followed him protesting.</p>

  <p>"Here's your Commodore," he pointed out. "He'll lead ye out of the harbor
  all right, and hell git your papers when the Customs officers have done wid
  them; but if yell take my advice, yell not hang around here five minutes
  after mid-night."</p>

  <p>We stepped into the launch.</p>

  <p>"Git back to the <i>Idona</i>," the Mayor ordered the man at the
  wheel.</p>

  <p>"But what will you do with our papers?" the Commodore demanded.</p>

  <p>"Don't ye be wondering about that, me lad," the Mayor told him, as we drew
  up by the gangway of the <i>Idona</i>. "Here's yer ship. Git ye aboard and
  git ye out of this&mdash;ye and the <i>Katarette</i>&mdash;by midnight,
  according to orders given, and by the divil himself, if ye're here a quarter
  of an hour after the time, 111 have ye blown out of the water. Come along, me
  lad." he added, turning to me.</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make a passage on this old tub," I said. "I wouldn't miss
  the fun for anything."</p>

  <p>"'Tis a pity&mdash;that. I might git to like ye a thrifle better if ye
  stopped the night wid me," he added, with something like a grin on his face.
  "I don't suppose ye've ever had a real drink of whisky."</p>

  <p>We shook hands heartily, but I bade him farewell.</p>

  <p>I told my story to Louis and the Chief some six or seven nights later. The
  latter, to whom some of the facts were already known, smiled with grim
  approval. Louis was a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand, Louis," I explained. "The Mayor of Ballydaghan was
  to have received the <i>Nordicka</i> laden to the brim with machine-guns, the
  possession of which would have made him easily the most popular man in the
  country, as a reward for sheltering the <i>Katarette</i> and the <i>Idona</i>
  in his harbor until the time when they could have been safely delivered over
  to the gentleman who was dining the other night. The Chevalier tried to be
  too clever, however, and though the <i>Idona</i> and the <i>Katarette</i>
  carried a full cargo of machine guns, the <i>Nordicka</i> had nothing packed
  away in her hold but a lot of scrap-iron. It is not my place to suggest where
  the information came from, but M17B has agents, of course, in the Harbor City
  of Daghan and it was through one of them I suppose, that I received word of
  what had happened."</p>

  <p>Louis was still perplexed.</p>

  <p>"But tell me," he asked, "why would a cargo of arms and ammunition be of
  such value to the Mayor of Ballydaghan?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand, Louis," I told him, a little impatiently perhaps,
  "that the Irish are born fighters? Ballydaghan is a city of fighting men. The
  city is rapidly becoming a harborage for Communists. The increase of their
  influence in the city is a terrible menace, and the possession of that
  shipload of arms would mean just the difference between security and
  danger."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but now I understand." Louis said. "But there is one thing more. How
  did the other two boats put out to sea without their papers?'</p>

  <p>"Well, as soon as His Worship realised that he had been sold," I
  explained, "he went completely mad. He not only ordered the other two vessels
  out of the harbor they were leaving anyway at midnight&mdash;but he carried
  out a little idea of my own and he made derelicts of them. He confiscated
  their papers, forced them to leave and, curiously enough, they steamed right
  into the jaws of a British gunboat, the Hero, who took us into Plymouth."</p>

  <p>The Chief smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think," he decided, "this young friend of ours almost deserves a pat on
  the back."</p>

  <p>Louis pressed a bell by his side.</p>

  <p>"I will give him something which I think we shall all appreciate better,"
  he remarked. "One of the last bottles of my 1899 Veuve Clicquot Rosee."</p>

     id="story02"></a>II. &mdash; TRAGEDY DINED WITH LORD BLUNT</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Tragedy Dined with Sir Gerald Daynton" in<br>
  <i>This Week</i> (US Sunday newspaper supplement), 1936</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was no doubt but that I owed to Louis, the presiding
  genius over the Milan Grill Room, my participation in a great many of the
  adventures which have made the place famous. In the matter of Paul La
  Fallaise, however, the reverse was the case. It was I who went out of my way
  to pause at Louis' seat of honour and present him to the celebrated
  Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"You know Monsieur La Fallaise by name and reputation beyond a doubt,
  Louis," I said. "He comes to London so seldom, though, that he tells me you
  have never met."</p>

  <p>"I have scarcely ever been able to induce Monsieur La Fallaise to lunch
  anywhere with me except at my club," Nesbit, my editor, and the host of our
  small party observed.</p>

  <p>Louis' little bow was as usual almost perfect. He rose a few inches from
  his place and his smile of welcome was obviously genuine.</p>

  <p>"It is a great honour and a great pleasure to meet Monsieur La Fallaise,"
  he said, "Your usual table is reserved, Mr. Nesbit," he added. "If I might
  make a recommendation, I would suggest our ortelans with a banana and grape
  salad, a bottle of our Roman&eacute;e Cont&eacute; '21 and a peach omelette with <i>Sauce
  vieux Armagnac</i> to follow."</p>

  <p>We passed on to our table situated in a discreet corner which still
  commanded an excellent view of the room. Nesbit busied himself in ordering
  the lunch. Our guest looked about him with interest as he toyed with an
  <i>ap&eacute;ritif.</i> He was an unusual type for a Frenchman&mdash;fair, tall and
  slim, with a slight brown moustache, pale sensitive face, a delightful
  expression and a reserved yet very agreeable manner. It was hard to believe
  that this was the man who, from that bare, sparsely furnished room on the
  topmost floor of the huge building in which were situated the offices of the
  great newspaper for which he worked, could be the author of those fierce and
  brilliantly written articles, a long succession of which had made him almost
  the dominant figure in French political journalism.</p>

  <p>"This meeting pleases me very much, <i>Capitaine</i>," he told me. "I am
  not quite the hermit Monsieur Nesbit would make me out but I think I have
  very fixed habits. I frequent only two restaurants in Paris and I come to
  London so seldom that I feel almost a stranger. Your Louis though&mdash; what
  a type! I hear that he knows more about food and wine than any other man in
  Europe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a few other things," I put in.</p>

  <p>Nesbit laid down the menu.</p>

  <p>"With a melon to start, I followed Louis' advice," he announced. "If he
  takes the trouble to recommend he is generally worth following."</p>

  <p>"Curiously interesting personality," La Fallaise observed. "He seems to
  have succeeded in preserving the intimacies of the small exclusive restaurant
  even in this huge place."</p>

  <p>"The fellow always was a genius," Nesbit remarked. "Seems a queer idea of
  the directors to give him that quaint sort of desk and put him in command
  here but they tell me that he had not been at his job for a month before the
  whole place was back again as it used to be before the war."</p>

  <p>"I shall recall my visit here with pleasure, I am sure," La Fallaise
  declared. "It is not often in Paris that one eats with such a crowd&mdash;
  such an agreeable crowd, too. These young ladies&mdash;they are not so chic
  perhaps as our Frenchwomen but they seem so happy and carefree."</p>

  <p>"Mostly on the stage or films," Nesbit explained. "This is a regular
  meeting house for everyone in the profession."</p>

  <p>La Fallaise smiled. Notwithstanding his silence I knew Paris well enough
  to guess the trend of his thoughts. Nesbit was busy nodding to acquaintances
  right and left. La Fallaise, who seemed to be much entertained by the novelty
  of his environment, talked to me in his pleasant, almost shy manner.</p>

  <p>"I have been during the last few weeks," he confided, "to conferences at
  Amsterdam, Berlin and Rome. It is very seldom that I go so far afield, but
  the times make it difficult for the sincere writer nowadays. More and more I
  think we grow selfish for our country's sake. It is well to travel and catch
  something, if one can, of the spirit of other countries. ... I see very few
  of my own people here. Americans in plenty. What a benefit for your nation,
  Captain Lyson, that you have a great twin brother with whom to exchange
  sympathies."</p>

  <p>There were many subjects I would have preferred to discuss with my
  distinguished acquaintance but already I had come under the charm of his easy
  manner of speech and compelling personality. I was content to listen to
  whatever he chose to talk about so long as he went on talking. I listened and
  I watched him with an equal fascination. He was quietly dressed but with
  perfect taste. He had succeeded, too, where so many failed. He was wearing a
  tie of a deep violet shade with his morning clothes, a tie which blended
  perfectly with his shirt and seemed to indicate a queer aestheticism about
  the man. I permitted myself to watch his face and his expression as he talked
  and I found it hard to believe that he was not indeed a practised orator. Yet
  in the first few minutes of our conversation he had mentioned the fact that
  he had only three times in his life spoken in public. In France, he told me,
  nothing is more important than for a journalist to write behind a pseudonym
  and to preserve his incognito.</p>

  <p>"I never go into society," he confided. "I attend no parties or public
  functions. I belong to no clubs. My circle of intimate friends is as limited
  as an archbishop's. The advantage of all that, of course, is that I preserve
  absolutely my independence. I can let the hurricane of our too excitable
  politics rage around me and then I can write what I feel to be the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"But making so few contacts with outer life," I ventured, "does not that
  make the task of handing out the truth more difficult?"</p>

  <p>He dissented with a faint, thoughtful smile which gave to his face for a
  moment even a touch of spirituality.</p>

  <p>"I know men instinctively," he said quietly. "I have no need to converse
  with them or exchange ideas. This is in effect one of the few professional
  visits I have ever paid. I came to see your Lord Blunt at his own request and
  the request of our President. He has invited me to dine with him to-night. I
  go with reluctance. It is contrary to my habit and my fixed ideas."</p>

  <p>Nesbit moved uneasily in his place. I was perhaps monopolising the
  conversation or he had some reason for not wishing me to hear the great
  French writer talk so frankly. I withdrew from the conversation for a time
  but La Fallaise&mdash;it may have been his perfect manners or he may perhaps
  have been overwhelmed by Nesbit's ceaseless flow of small talk&mdash;towards
  the end of luncheon turned suddenly in my direction.</p>

  <p>"To-night with Lord Blunt," he asked. "We meet&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Our great men in the newspaper world," I told him, "are wise in that
  respect. They keep their underlings away from them. Nesbit has dined in
  Curzon Street once I think. I have scarcely even met our chief."</p>

  <p>"A clever man in his dogged way," La Fallaise remarked, "but prejudiced.
  He has neither the finesse nor the honesty to become a great politician."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't seem to be able to hit it off with your country somehow,"
  Nesbit observed. "He has it firmly fixed in his mind that you all hate
  us."</p>

  <p>La Fallaise took up the subject seriously.</p>

  <p>"The average Frenchman," he said, "does not dislike England, If he fails
  to trust you it is because he does not understand. I ask you as
  cosmopolitans, not as Englishmen," he went on with a whimsical smile, "is
  that so wonderful after all? There is not one England, but three. There is
  the England&mdash;the House of Commons&mdash;that is to say, the England as
  she is represented by your statesmen. There is the England which Lord Blunt
  represents&mdash;the England of your press. And there is the England behind
  it all which really exists&mdash;the man in the street, you call it, the
  little man&mdash;yes?&mdash;who sometimes I think is inadequately represented
  in either the parliament or the press. Which is the England who will speak
  with his country's authority when the moment comes?"</p>

  <p>"It is pertinently put," Nesbit admitted. "It is a question you should ask
  His Lordship to-night. I know what his answer will be because he tore up my
  last editorial!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing could prove better what I always say," La Fallaise declared.
  "Your press is in the hands of bullies. You will understand both of you I am
  sure, I do not say this from an egoistic point of view, but if the owner of
  the great journal to which I chiefly contribute were to alter a single
  sentence in anything I wrote, it would be the end. The beginning for me,
  perhaps, of a new life."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you would retire?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I have a little boat," our guest confided, "a hamper of books and a small
  cellar. You would find me a hermit drifting about the waterways of the world.
  I should be very happy."</p>

  <p>"But that time," Nesbit remarked with a smile, "will never arrive."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that during the next few seconds I had a glimpse of
  another La Fallaise, perhaps the real one.</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" he answered a little wearily. "Peace is the one thing most
  difficult to gather into our lives. Peace&mdash;rest without responsibility.
  It is too much to hope for."</p>

  <p>Jules, who had been hovering about, touched me on the shoulder. Nesbit had
  paid the bill and we were showing signs of leaving. The ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel
  whispered in my ear.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Louis begs that you will not leave without seeing him. It is an
  affair of urgency."</p>

  <p>"In five minutes," I promised.</p>

  <p><br>
  It was a day, this, of curious irregularities, of slight disturbances
  suddenly inflated into sinister possibilities. I frankly failed to understand
  Louis' attitude when I sought him in his room. The cognac, which was his
  great after-luncheon weakness, stood untasted upon his desk. There were
  already the stumps of many cigarettes in his ash-tray. His manner seemed to
  me to be lacking altogether in his usual poise.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Lyson," he invited. "I want just a word with you. To tell you
  the truth it gave me quite a shock when I saw your companion at
  luncheon."</p>

  <p>"Paul La Fallaise?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He was Nesbit's guest, you know, not mine," I explained.</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether any Englishman," Louis reflected, "can appreciate what La
  Fallaise is to France."</p>

  <p>"I am prepared to believe anything," I replied. "I never met such an
  impressive personality."</p>

  <p>"He is the underground ruler of my country," Louis continued. "He can make
  or unmake governments at will. He is never ruthless, never a destructive
  critic. Every statesman whom he thinks a patriot and deserving of his support
  can command it and when he gives his support that statesman has nothing to
  fear."</p>

  <p>"I have talked with the man and I believe it. <i>Et puis?</i>"</p>

  <p>"I am not happy that La Fallaise should have brought his pen of gold and
  all his brilliancy to London to the <i>gal&egrave;re</i> in which he appears," Louis
  confessed frankly. "I have ventured to make an enquiry. I understand that he
  has come over to confer with Lord Blunt, your great newspaper
  millionaire."</p>

  <p>"And incidentally my master and Nesbit's master."</p>

  <p>Louis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It cannot be a good meeting," he said. "If La Fallaise and Blunt meet and
  La Fallaise convinces himself that the press of this country is governed as
  it partly is by Blunt, harm will come of it."</p>

  <p>I shrugged my shoulders. It seemed to me that Louis was rather wide of the
  mark.</p>

  <p>"How can we help it?" I asked. "It is only by a miracle that La Fallaise
  and Blunt have not met years ago. Of course your man is an idealist. He has
  his place amongst the gods, and Blunt&mdash;well, we know all about him. But
  what harm can come of their meeting? If I am any judge of mankind I should
  say that Paul La Fallaise was above prejudices. He may dislike and despise
  Blunt. I don't believe it will make any difference. One of the greatest gifts
  he possesses is the gift of tolerance."</p>

  <p>Louis was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he went on, "I am not intruding into secrets, I trust? Does
  Blunt give a dinner or a reception for La Fallaise to-night or are they
  meeting <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>?"</p>

  <p>"It is a dinner of three," I confided, "to take place at Curzon Street.
  Steele, our foreign editor, is flying back from Hungary."</p>

  <p>Louis sighed.</p>

  <p>"Steele is an apparently clever man," he said, "and there is no one who
  understands better the political situation in Europe, but all the same,
  compared to La Fallaise, he is the knave in the pack."</p>

  <p>The telephone at Louis' elbow rang. He took off the receiver and passed it
  at once to me.</p>

  <p>"A call for you, Lyson, put through from your rooms."</p>

  <p>An unfamiliar voice addressed me.</p>

  <p>"This is Desmond speaking&mdash;Lord Blunt's private secretary. You are
  Captain Lyson?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted. "But are you sure it is I whom you want? Mr. Nesbit and
  Monsieur La Fallaise have just left."</p>

  <p>"I have a message for you, Captain Lyson, from the chief," the secretary
  continued. "We were expecting Mr. Steele to dine to-night with his lordship
  and Monsieur La Fallaise. Mr. Steele's plane has met with a slight accident
  and he has wirelessed that he will not be here in time. His lordship desires
  you to take his place."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted, of course," I answered hesitatingly. "But are you
  sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dinner will be at eight o'clock," the secretary concluded calmly. "His
  lordship wishes you to wear a short coat and a black tie and to arrive a
  little before that hour at 26 Curzon Street. That is understood?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," I assured him. "I shall be there."</p>

  <p>Louis quite frankly had been listening. As I replaced the receiver he
  spoke eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You are dining instead of Steele?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It seems so," I replied. "I can't imagine why. I scarcely know Blunt to
  nod to and I have never been inside his house in my life."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," Louis said with a benevolent smile, "it is the best thing,
  this, which could have happened."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell me why," I begged. "I call myself a journalist
  adventurer. There are half a dozen sub-editors who know more about politics
  than I do."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled inscrutably.</p>

  <p>"I hope that I am wrong," he said, "but there is just the possibility, a
  very regrettable possibility, that other matters than politics may come up
  for discussion before your dinner is over."</p>

  <p><br>
  At five minutes to eight that evening I found myself drinking a
  <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> cocktail in the palatial library of the man whose
  newspapers just at that time might have been said to dominate the entire
  English press. I had barely exchanged a half dozen words with him in my life
  and I was still full of curiosity as to why it had fallen to my lot to fill
  the vacant place at his momentous dinner party. He hastened to enlighten
  me.</p>

  <p>"My people telephoned to Nesbit for advice," he said, "as soon as we found
  that Steele was delayed. Nesbit told me that you got on very well with this
  autocratic gentleman at luncheon so I thought you might carry on the good
  work&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"I am only too delighted to be here, sir," I said. "I have never talked to
  a more interesting man."</p>

  <p>"H'm. I call him a bit difficult myself," Blunt observed. "Not that I have
  had much to do with him. I hate personal contacts but this one could not be
  avoided. How did you find him? Is he really the bomb-slinger they say he
  is?"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, sir," I ventured, "there is no living Frenchman who could
  speak for his country more authoritatively and more honestly and if it comes
  to that more eloquently than La Fallaise. There are hundreds of thousands of
  Frenchmen, especially amongst the educated classes, who are content to follow
  him blindly."</p>

  <p>"Inclined to be anti-British, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"I should not say so. I don't think he has that fanatical faith in us as a
  seafaring and military race that a great many of his countrymen have.
  Otherwise I think he is just as anxious for our friendship as any of the
  present government."</p>

  <p>That was the end of my <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with my august chief, for a few
  moments later La Fallaise was announced. As he came smiling across the room
  with outstretched hand I found myself relapsing once more into a state almost
  of hero worship. His poise and carriage were so perfect, his English so
  pleasantly spoken, the little gleam of humour in his deep-set eyes so
  appealing that even our gruff and rather prejudiced host was impressed.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you thought it worth the trouble to come over, Monsieur La
  Fallaise," the latter said, as they raised their glasses to one another. "I
  was just telling my young friend here that I have never been a great believer
  in personal contacts but there are times when they do good&mdash;clear away a
  lot of misunderstandings and that sort of thing. So many of your people seem
  to think that we are a race of hypocrites and so many of our own educated
  people&mdash;before we lowered the price of our newspapers, eh? and got to
  the masses&mdash;used to think of France as a timid nation shivering with
  imaginary fears."</p>

  <p>"A certain amount of hypocrisy," La Fallaise observed, "is inseparable
  from the tenets of any school of diplomacy just as a certain amount of
  nervousness is the tribute which our soldiers have to pay for the confidence
  reposed in them. Take us all round, Lord Blunt, I think we are quite
  well-meaning and honest, which is just what I imagine you would believe about
  us if you spent a little more time in our midst,"</p>

  <p>The two men were standing side by side and it was in a way a sad contrast.
  La Fallaise, apart from his intellectual gifts, was of aristocratic stock and
  showed it. Blunt was an opportunist, shrewd and intelligent, but lacking
  sadly in tact and poise.</p>

  <p>"I spend several months of every year in France," the latter pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>"In our pleasure gardens," La Fallaise reminded him smiling. "We would
  like to see more of you in Paris, to have you an occasional visitor at the
  Quai d'Orsay."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," Blunt said, dragging out a thin platinum watch.
  "I'm not quite sure that representatives of the press do much good by fussing
  around too much. Five minutes past eight. What's the meaning of this, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>A young man in plain morning clothes came into the room, crossed the floor
  swiftly and handed a slip of paper to his chief. Blunt read the few lines
  upon it with a frown.</p>

  <p>"All right, Desmond," he said. "Tell them to serve dinner. Gentlemen, I
  had a surprise for you, a fourth guest who is staying in the house. Detained
  or something of the sort. We won't wait. We are informal to-night, you see,
  La Fallaise&mdash;dining in my snuggery here."</p>

  <p>Two footmen had drawn aside the heavy curtains and we followed Blunt into
  a smaller room where a round table, beautifully arranged with choice flowers
  and almost a superfluity of cut glass and silver, stood in the center of the
  apartment. La Fallaise murmured a compliment upon the scheme of
  colouring&mdash;yellow shades and bowls of yellow roses.</p>

  <p>"My housekeeper is rather clever at that sort of thing," our host
  remarked. "I am&mdash;like you, I believe&mdash;a bachelor. A nuisance if one
  entertains much but then I don't go in for that. I like to have a friend or
  two now and then but that is scarcely what is meant by entertaining
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me at first that La Fallaise was slightly bewildered. His
  conversation had little of the brilliancy and humour which had made our
  luncheon memorable. Soon, however, he resigned himself. He listened
  respectfully to his host's rather trite monologue, maintained a judicious
  silence whilst Blunt opened up moot points in present-day politics and
  discussed with flamboyant candour the mistakes of the statesmen of whom he
  disapproved. . . . The dinner was too perfect to be altogether ignored even
  by a man of apparently ascetic tastes and La Fallaise, approving of the
  flavour of his wines and the chef's culinary efforts, had the air of a man
  settling down to make the best show possible. As a rendezvous for discussion
  the feast was a failure. As it drew towards its end I felt that Blunt
  retained exactly his former views as to the one or two vexed questions which
  had arisen and La Fallaise, dragged into an alien and unsympathetic
  environment, was simply a dummy at the feast, making no effort whatever to
  arrive at a closer understanding with his host. I put in a word or two
  whenever it seemed necessary or advisable, but mostly I occupied myself in
  studying La Fallaise. He seemed to me to be a little <i>distrait</i>. There
  were times when he seemed to be looking through the picture-hung walls,
  afterwards to be listening to the deadened sounds outside with a queer sense
  of anticipation as though some gift of second sight were warning him of the
  drama to come. Curiously enough I, too, began to share this spirit of
  uneasiness. I felt a sudden thrill of apprehension as the dark figure of the
  somberly clad major domo solemnly parted the heavy curtains and stood
  respectfully on one side. The woman whom he was silently announcing swept
  into the room with something of that quiet but incomparable grace which had
  made her movements famous throughout the world. After the first flutter of
  surprise, she was easily recognisable and just as easily there flashed into
  my consciousness a swift, deadly pang of memory. I turned towards La
  Fallaise. We had both risen to our feet, he stricken with a sudden cold
  rigidity, I filled with an emotion utterly unanalysable. The woman was
  smiling at our host. He remained in his chair and motioned to the place
  opposite to him.</p>

  <p>"You have missed Hector at his best, Josephine," he said. "Knew he was
  making the cuisine for a fellow countryman, I expect. Take your place and we
  will try and forgive you. Monsieur La Fallaise of your beloved Paris, whom
  without a doubt you know. Captain Lyson&mdash;Mademoiselle Josephine Tabaret.
  Monsieur La Fallaise is, I hope, a surprise for you, Josephine. They say he
  hides away from the limelight, but his pen is a match for all my printing
  presses."</p>

  <p>Blunt finished his speech leaning back in his chair, a trifle flushed, a
  good-humoured proprietary smile upon his face. I, in ignorance, could do
  nothing but watch La Fallaise in grave discomfiture. The woman was standing
  perfectly still. The jeweled bag she had been carrying clattered to the
  floor. Her eyes seemed to have grown larger since she had recognised La
  Fallaise. I had been through the war and turned over many unhappy pages in
  the book of life, but I had never seen such an expression of horror as
  suddenly drained the colour from her cheeks and set her limbs shivering.
  "Paul!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He was facing her now, apparently perfectly calm but still indisposed for
  speech. She took a step forward, swayed as though she were in the act of
  falling, but before I could reach her she had caught at the back of the high
  chair which the footman was holding for her.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the meaning of all this?" Blunt asked, rising to his
  feet. "Can't you speak, Josephine? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>I poured out some water and tried to press the tumbler into her hand. It
  was quite useless. Her icy fingers could have held nothing. She was
  absolutely deaf and her eyes remained fixed upon La Fallaise.</p>

  <p>"You two&mdash;seem to know one another," Blunt stuttered.</p>

  <p>"I have had the honour," La Fallaise said calmly, "of occupying the
  position of husband to Madame for some years."</p>

  <p>"Lover, I suppose you mean!" Blunt scowled.</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause&mdash;a pause of cold, frozen silence. No one
  moved. One of the footmen had stolen from the room. The major domo, who had
  always presented the appearance of an executioner, was standing in the
  background. The butler, who had been serving the wines, was still at the
  sideboard. The woman had buried her face in her hands. One heard the stifled
  sobs which the rise and fall of her bosom indicated. We were all in those few
  seconds like posturing models.</p>

  <p>"I imagined my wife on her way to America," La Fallaise said. "I learn
  that she is a guest in your house. In your country, I think, Lord Blunt, you
  do not fight duels. You will permit me?"</p>

  <p>All the time, he had been fingering a ring upon his right hand. He drew it
  off, leaned towards Blunt and struck him across the cheek. I do not know
  whether it was abject cowardice or astonishment which kept the latter lying
  there half out of his chair, his arm raised as though he expected another
  attack. La Fallaise turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"If there is any answer," he said, "I am to be found at the Milan
  Hotel."</p>

  <p><br>
  Louis, too, when he had heard my story, seemed like a stricken man. I found
  him in his little dining room smoking endless cigarettes, with the half dozen
  oysters and pint of Sauterne which was his customary supper at this season of
  the year untouched before him.</p>

  <p>"You knew what was likely to happen?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing I could do," he said sadly. "I sent to every hotel in
  London but it was hopeless. She was actually staying in the man's house. La
  Fallaise had a telegram from Cherbourg. She was supposed to be singing at the
  Metropolitan in New York next week. She must have flown instead to
  London."</p>

  <p>"It has been an affair of a long time?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Two years. La Fallaise would never have known but for this unholy chance.
  He lives the life of a hermit. She was with him buried in the country
  somewhere a fortnight ago. Then see what arrives," he went on with a sudden
  hopeless gesture. "She passes unseen by La Fallaise or any of you within a
  few feet of your table at luncheon time. You know nothing. You see nothing. I
  could count the times La Fallaise has visited London since the war. He
  chooses this one night to give in to the President's wishes and come across
  to meet Blunt, and Blunt, who might so easily have told her of the coming
  guest, kept it for a surprise. Fate!"</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, you had better get on with your oysters and drink your
  Sauterne, Louis," I told him. "There will be a crowd here from the Opera
  tonight."</p>

  <p>Louis poured himself out a glass of wine and moved a little nearer to the
  table.</p>

  <p><i>"C'est raisonnable,"</i> he sighed. <i>"Mais, mon ami, ce n'est pas
  encore fini, cette affaire l&agrave;!"</i></p>

  <p><br>
  Curiously enough those words of Louis' were in my mind the whole of the next
  day. They came repeatedly between me and my work. I found myself wondering
  what a man of La Fallaise's temperament would do, faced with this situation
  so essentially a part of the drama of modern life. What was there he could
  do? I tried to place myself in the same position. Physical force was so
  impossible. The invocation of the law by a man of La Fallaise's temperament
  and outlook ridiculous. The subject was still in my mind when in response to
  an urgent message from Louis I looked in to see him on my return early in the
  evening.</p>

  <p>"La Fallaise has been here," he announced. "He came to see you. I am
  entrusted with a message."</p>

  <p>"He is still in London?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"He is still here. He wishes to see you. He is in number 128."</p>

  <p>"He took you into his confidence?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"To some extent," Louis admitted. "You see, I knew Mademoiselle Josephine
  Tabaret long before she or the world realised that she had the voice of a
  goddess, long before the world was at her feet. However, I must not keep you.
  I told La Fallaise that this was your usual hour for returning and he begged
  that you would visit him at once."</p>

  <p>"I will go, of course," I agreed. "But honestly, Louis, I don't know what
  to say to him. All day long I have been asking myself that one
  question&mdash;what does a man like La Fallaise do in such a position?"</p>

  <p>Louis made no reply. I left him and mounted to number 128 in the Court. La
  Fallaise opened the door to me himself. He greeted me pleasantly and ushered
  me into his modest apartment, very little larger than my own. Already,
  however, with a few flowers and books and a couple of water colours, which I
  knew that he must have purchased from an exhibition that afternoon, he seemed
  to have given the place a touch of his own personality. He rang for cocktails
  and waved me to an easy chair.</p>

  <p>"Captain Lyson," he said, "I have very few friends in London or if it
  comes to that&mdash;in the world. There is no one of whom I could ask the
  service I am asking of you."</p>

  <p>"I am all the more flattered," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"Will you be the bearer of a message from me to Lord Blunt?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," I promised.</p>

  <p>He unlocked a despatch box which was lying upon his writing table and drew
  out a letter. He passed it over to me.</p>

  <p>"Do you recognise the handwriting?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," I replied. "It is the handwriting of Lord Blunt."</p>

  <p>"Read it," he enjoined.</p>

  <p>I obeyed. When I had finished, my cheeks were burning. Blunt was after all
  an Englishman and by some means or other had found his way into a dominant
  position.</p>

  <p>"I have read it," I said. "You cannot expect me to understand."</p>

  <p>La Fallaise shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That letter," he confided, "has reposed in the archives of the inner
  sanctuary of the French political secret service headquarters for four years.
  It cost the man who secured possession of it four millions, the lives of
  three men, the reputation of a dozen others and ultimately his own life. It
  tells its own story. It accounts for that long series of bitter attacks with
  which the Blunt press has done its best to destroy the <i>entente</i> between
  our two countries. What do you suppose, my friend Capitaine Lyson, will be
  the result if I publish that letter and write my next week's article around
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I should think you would ruin the whole of the Blunt press," I replied,
  "and Blunt himself will commit suicide if he has the courage. In any case he
  will have to resign from every official position. Of course he would dispute
  its authenticity."</p>

  <p>"That," La Fallaise assured me, "he could not do. He was staying secretly
  at the hotel from which the letter was written and the messenger who took it
  is still alive. His handwriting is unmistakable and the change in the tone of
  his newspapers from that period is absolute confirmation of his wretched
  bargain. The bankers, too, can testify that over a million pounds went into
  Blunt's account that month. Truth may lie deep at the bottom of the well, my
  friend, but when the morning of fate dawns it is there as clear as
  crystal."</p>

  <p>He returned the letter to the place from which he had produced it and
  locked the despatch box. There was a knock at the door. A very obvious French
  manservant, carrying his hat in his hand but dressed for a journey, presented
  himself.</p>

  <p>"The car awaits Monsieur," he announced.</p>

  <p>"I am coming," La Fallaise said. "Go and take your place, Jean. See that
  the bags are down."</p>

  <p>"Everything is prepared, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed his master's wave of the hand and disappeared. La Fallaise
  threw his overcoat over his arm and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, my new friend Capitaine Lyson," he said. "If any evil chance
  should bring me again to this country we will foregather."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but what is it you wish me to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>La Fallaise shook his head. "Nothing."</p>

    <p class="caption">The Australian Women's Weekly, Septemver 10, 1938, with
    "A Rough-House at Elstree"</p>
  </div>

  <p class="first">WITH my hairbrushes still poised in mid-air, I listened for
  a moment to the timid yet imperative knock at my closed door. As the flat
  which I occupied in the Milan Court was on the topmost story and one of the
  smallest in the building, it was very seldom that I received unannounced
  visits.</p>

  <p>"You wish to see me?" I asked the young woman whom I found in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"If you please, Captain Lyson."</p>

  <p>She looked nervously over her shoulder. She was breathing quickly and gave
  me the impression of having hurried from the lift, which came no higher than
  the floor below. I ushered her into the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Would you think me crazy if I asked you to lock the door?" she
  ventured.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;only indiscreet," I answered, smiling. "Don't ask me to do that.
  Miss Hansom. I can assure you that you will be perfectly safe here."</p>

  <p>"You know who I am?" I nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are Miss Christine Hansom, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She produced a letter which, at her request. I opened and read. It was
  from a well-known Scandinavian in New York.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"My Dear Lyson,<br>
  <br>
  "The bearer is Miss Christine Hansom, an acquaintance of mine, but well known
  to several of my friends in the Nordic Embassy here. She is going over to
  play in a film in England where she has no friends. If you can do anything
  for her, you can rest assured of my gratitude.<br>
  <br>
  "Ever yours.<br>
  <br>
  "Charles Korvald."</p><br>

  <p>I glanced up at her curiously. She was very good looking in a statuesque
  northern European fashion, with large blue eyes deeply set, a profusion of
  golden hair, and a graceful figure, rather on the flowing side.</p>

  <p>"I see you with all your people in the Grill Room sometimes," I remarked.
  "I don't think I have met anyone in your show, though."</p>

  <p>"They are all strangers to me," he confided. "Some of them&mdash;Phillip
  Dean, for instance&mdash;are quite well known, but none of them was at
  Hollywood when I was there."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," I ventured, "are you in trouble of any sort? How, can I help
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Just by talking pleasantly, and looking human," she replied "I have lost
  my balance. I have nerves. I am frightened."</p>

  <p>"But what of."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you, perhaps. Not now&mdash;but soon. This is the strangest
  show I have ever been in. The author has put a great deal of money in it and
  he does all the direction himself."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"His name is Osmond Lann," she confided. "We are doing a film version of
  his novel 'The Great World.'"</p>

  <p>"Good?"</p>

  <p>"Very clever," she admitted doubtfully. "Very difficult to understand.
  especially the way we are doing it&mdash;like pieces in a jig-saw puzzle.
  Captain Lyson, I do not think that I like authors."</p>

  <p>"No great catch, are they?" I agreed.</p>

  <p>"I think," she went on, "that Mr. Lann tries to be kind, but half the time
  is so vague. He treats us as though we were all school-children living in
  another world."</p>

  <p>"Sounds as though he were inclined to be a poseur," I suggested. "Now,
  tell me why you were trembling when you came in&mdash;why you still look so
  frightened. If you need my help in any way, I must know a little more about
  it."</p>

  <p>She sat quite still for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"You will think I am silly, I know," she said presently. "I am beginning
  to have a sort of nervous dread of Mr. Osmond Lann."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;go on." I invited.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lann is his own director, producer, and everything. It is he who
  hired the studio. It is he who engaged everyone&mdash;even the cameramen.
  Nearly all the scenes are indoor ones, and when we begin a set every door in
  the studio is locked."</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about the making of films," I observed, "but is that
  unusual?"</p>

  <p>"It has never been done before in any picture I have made," she assured
  me. "Then there are other things. We have all had to take an oath of secrecy
  that we will divulge nothing of the character or the plot of the scenario
  and, besides that, there is a clause in our contracts that anyone whose work
  is disapproved of by Mr. Lann can be dismissed at once with a month's
  salary."</p>

  <p>"Sounds a little arbitrary."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is wicked. We signed because we never dreamed that it would ever
  happen, and the salaries are quite good. Now I come to the great trouble.
  Pour days ago I was called on the set to do a scene with Phillip Dean. When
  it was finished. Mr. Lann asked Phillip to drive home with him as he wished
  to discuss his rendering of the part. That was four days ago. We have never
  seen Mr. Dean since."</p>

  <p>"Dismissed?"</p>

  <p>"For incapacity, Mr. Lann told us. Worse still&mdash;he is going to play
  the part himself."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I like your author director," I admitted, offering her a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>She helped herself gratefully. Her manner was becoming more normal.</p>

  <p>"His behaviour to the rest of us," she went on, "is kindness itself, but
  that does not alter the fact that we are all terribly afraid of him. There
  seems to be no escape at any hour of the day. He engaged that large round
  table you may have noticed in the Grill Room on the day we started, and
  everyone is expected to dine there at night and discuss progress."</p>

  <p>"When exactly was Phillip Dean sent away?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The fear was back again in those great eyes. Her voice shook as she
  answered me.</p>

  <p>"Last Tuesday, after we had finished at the studio. Mr Lann took him off
  in his own car and we have not seen or heard of him since."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that he hasn't come to say good-bye to any of
  you?"</p>

  <p>"He has not been near one of us." she assured me.</p>

  <p>"Has Lann referred to his disappearance in any way?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lann came by very late for dinner that night. He just said that he
  had made arrangements with Mr Dean to relinquish the part, that Mr. Dean was
  going back to America, and that he intended to take over his part and play it
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Is he capable of doing that?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. He is an actor."</p>

  <p>"I hate to seem inquisitive," I ventured after a moment's pause, "but if
  you have come here with any idea of asking my help, I must understand a
  little more about the situation. What is your role in the film?"</p>

  <p>She half closed her eyes and moved uneasily in her chair.</p>

  <p>"A horrible one. The spirit of sexual evil brooding over the world: a sort
  of unconverted Mary Magdalene. That is all I can tell you."</p>

  <p>I could feel her eyes studying me furtively. I think that at that moment
  we both had the same thought. Whatever faults Osmond Lann might have
  possessed, he had shown at least a flair for one part of his profession.</p>

  <p>"Have you an agent at all?" I asked her.</p>

  <p>"Not now. Mr. Lann will not deal with agents. He drew up the contracts
  himself."</p>

  <p>"He pays good salaries?"</p>

  <p>"He pays me two hundred and fifty pounds a week," she confided. "I do not
  know what the others are getting, but they seem quite satisfied. My salary
  would be all right," she went on, "but I am kept here as a prisoner. I am not
  allowed to see even a newspaper man. Mr. Lann possesses the most charming
  manners in the world, but is rude to anyone who comes down wanting to
  interview me. How can he possibly expect to produce a film in the West End
  and defy the Press?"</p>

  <p>"It does seem rather a problem," I admitted. "May I think it over for a
  day or two? I will make a few inquiries about your chief, and see if I can
  discover what has become of Phillip Dean."</p>

  <p>"That is just what I want you to do." she agreed eagerly.</p>

  <p>"There is just one more question I must ask. When you came in here you
  were shockingly nervous. You even wanted me to lock the door. Nothing that
  you have told me about the situation could account for this."</p>

  <p>"Captain Lyson," she confessed, "it all comes from one thing. I am
  frightened of Mr. Lann."</p>

  <p>I looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What are you frightened of?"</p>

  <p>"The way he got rid of Phillip Dean, for one thing."</p>

  <p>"There may be a reasonable explanation for that," I pointed out. "What
  else?"</p>

  <p>She was clutching the arms of the chair and I could see where her knuckles
  were white with the tension. Her eyes almost frightened me.</p>

  <p>"Look here," I said, "I will put it bluntly. Does he pay you
  attentions?"</p>

  <p>"He is all the time." she answered feverishly, "on the borderline. In our
  work, Captain Lyson, we gain experience. We learn how to ward off that sort
  of thing. I am all the time on my guard, but I never know. Sometimes he is
  just as kind and thoughtful as a man could be, and he does not seem to have a
  wrong idea in his head; at other times he seems torn&mdash;distracted. I am
  afraid to be in the room with him. He looks at me as though he were battling
  with hideous temptations. When he has left me sometimes, I have almost had
  hysterics, and I do not want to lose this job. I have never had a chance to
  save a penny before, and here I spend nothing. I want to finish the film,
  Captain Lyson. After that, if I can get work from anyone else in the world. I
  never want to see Mr. Lann again. Listen!...is not that&mdash;someone
  outside?"</p>

  <p>She leaned forward shivering in her chair. There was a distinct rap at the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Do not answer it!" she begged. "Perhaps he will go away."</p>

  <p>"Please don't be absurd," I remonstrated. "It is probably my evening
  paper&mdash;a telegram&mdash;anything. Of course I must answer it."</p>

  <p>I threw the door open and found myself confronted by the man whom I was
  expecting to find there.</p>

  <p>"Captain Lyson?" he inquired pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"My name is Lann," he told me. "Osmond Lann. I am running a small film
  company over here and I have come in search of one of my lost treasures."</p>

  <p>Christine Hansom seemed to have quite recovered her self-possession. She
  picked up her bag and fur and came across the room.</p>

  <p>"I have not strayed very far," she said. "I was just coming down. I am not
  late, am I?"</p>

  <p>"Only a few minutes," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hansom brought me a letter from a friend in New York," I observed.
  "Charlie Korvald. You know him, I expect."</p>

  <p>Lann was standing now full in the light. I found him younger than I had
  expected, and without the slightest trace of anything sinister in his manner
  or speech. I could scarcely keep a smile from my lips when I thought of Miss
  Hansom's apprehensions.</p>

  <p>"By name only. A very clever writer, I believe, and an excellent
  critic."</p>

  <p>"Will you both have a cocktail with me before you go in for dinner?" I
  invited. "I should like to hear something about your film, Mr. Lann."</p>

  <p>He accepted my invitation without demur. We descended to the Grill Room
  lounge and sat at a round table.</p>

  <p>"I am very happy to have met you. Captain Lyson." he said, "but I would
  rather not talk about the film. When I am ready. I will invite you gentlemen
  of the Press to come and see it, and you can make me happy or miserable as
  you choose; but what they term the gossiping sort of publicity&mdash;little
  paragraphs, hints at the plot&mdash;doesn't interest me. Most of my company
  think I am mad! I suppose that is because they want to see their photographs
  in the papers."</p>

  <p>He indulged in a humorous but not altogether pleasing grimace.</p>

  <p>"Well. I shan't be able to stop it for very long." he observed.</p>

  <p>The cocktails were brought, the clock struck eight soon afterwards, and
  Lann, with a glance at Christine, rose to his feet. He turned to me with an
  apologetic smile.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse us if we hurry off, Captain Lyson. We shall meet again, I
  hope..."</p>

  <p>They left me with an uneasy sense of her condition. She seemed to me
  either like an over-worked genius on the point of a breakdown, or a woman who
  was walking hand in hand all the time with a mortal terror. As usual, when
  thoroughly puzzled, I made my way across towards the armchair at the Grill
  Room entrance where Louis, the presiding genius of the place, was
  installed.</p>

  <p>"Louis," I asked, "do you know anything about Mr. Osmond Lann's film
  company?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing personal," he answered. "Here is one of my most distinguished
  patrons, however, who does. Captain Lyson&mdash;Mr. Norman Slay..."</p>

  <p>A small man, pale but with the face and expression of a world conqueror,
  shook hands with me.</p>

  <p>"You want to know about Osmond Lann and his film?" he inquired
  crisply.</p>

  <p>I pleaded guilty to a certain amount of curiosity. He plunged at once into
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Osmond Lann," he declared, "is a brilliant writer, if anything a little
  too imaginative for our job. He showed me the script of a film not long ago.
  I couldn't touch it, but then I buy and produce films to make money. This had
  all the gifts except the money touch. He always threatened to produce it
  himself. That's what I believe he is doing. He may make a great success. He
  works on original lines. He keeps his company locked up. He has contrived to
  create an atmosphere of mystery around everything he does.</p>

  <p>"What I saw of his manuscript was beautiful&mdash;but blasphemous. He is
  capable of making it the greatest film that has ever been shown. He is up to
  all sorts of funny stunts and he changes his cameramen continually. He works
  at all manner of odd times. If he makes the huge success he may, he is
  capable of dividing the whole of the profits&mdash;and they might be
  millions&mdash;amongst his cast. If he fails, he is just as capable of
  shooting the lot of them!"</p>

  <p>"One more question," I begged. "The girl&mdash;Christine Hansom, is he the
  sort of man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, no!" Slay interrupted. "Never heard of him looking at
  a woman in my life. Lives in the clouds. That's why he will either make the
  greatest triumph that was ever known, or come the greatest cropper."</p>

  <p>He moved on with a farewell nod. Louis was welcoming some new arrivals. I
  turned away rather reluctantly, summoned a taxi and drove to my club. I was
  just cutting in for my second rubber when the page-boy called me to the
  phone. It was a message from Julie, the charming daughter of my friend Louis.
  Her father wished to see me before he retired for the night. No more bridge
  for me! I was in his sitting-room just in time to join him in a final
  whisky-and-soda and cigarette. He waved Julie away.</p>

  <p>"I have myself," he confided, "developed a slight interest in that strange
  film party of whom you spoke. My friend Monsieur Bland, from the reception
  office, came across to see me this evening. He was somewhat perturbed at the
  sudden and unannounced departure of the leading man in the company."</p>

  <p>"So was Mademoiselle Christine," I observed. "The whole thing seems most
  extraordinary.'</p>

  <p>"That he had rushed away to catch a boat without taking his clothes with
  him, or returning at all to the hotel after he had the studio, was in itself
  barely credible." Louis went on, "but that he should have left behind him, of
  all things in the world, his passport that one fails wholly to
  understand."</p>

  <p>"It determines the situation, anyway," I replied, genuinely startled.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately," Louis continued, "the young man seemed to have a passion
  for being photographed. A dozen of his pictures are in a neat packet in your
  room. It would be advisable if you spoke with your friends at Scotland
  Yard...Something is wrong with those people, Captain Lyson. They dine
  together night after night, but they never laugh. I have had my eye on them
  for some time. I do not trust a company of people who never even smile."</p>

  <p>I rose at once to my feet.</p>

  <p>"Sharnbrook?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"It would be as well." Louis agreed, as we shook hands.</p>

  <p>I discovered that Inspector Sharnbrook, who was responsible for the
  department at Scotland Yard dealing with disappearances, was on night duty,
  and within an hour the photographs and particulars of Phillip Dean's
  departure from the studio, in company with Osmond Lann, were in his hands.
  Afterwards, I returned to my apartment, read for a time in my sitting-room,
  and went unwillingly to bed. Three times I woke in the night fancying I heard
  once more that timid rap at the door. Each time I looked out on to an empty
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Morning arrived. There was no news. From the concierge I learned that the
  whole of the Osmond Lann film company had started out for the studio at eight
  o'clock. Louis was a hopeless person until luncheon-time, so I left him
  alone. I had some work to do, but I neglected it. I went round to my club and
  played squash for an hour and a half with the professional; then I came back,
  had a shower-bath, changed for lunch, and descended to invite Julie for an
  aperitif. I found her almost dancing with excitement. She pressed her
  autograph-book into my hands.</p>

  <p>"Last night," she exclaimed. "I had the courage! That strange film
  company! I only knew yesterday that it was Christine Hansom and Osmond Lann.
  I was talking to father when they came out and I had the courage." she
  repeated "I asked for their autographs. Mr. Lann&mdash;oh, how handsome he
  is! He signed his name.</p>

  <p>"You shall see it here. Afterwards he stood talking with father, and Miss
  Hansom pretended that the light was bad and she made me follow her back into
  the room. Her fingers were trembling so that she could scarcely hold the pen.
  'Please do this for me,' she begged. 'Tell Captain Lyson to wait in his
  apartment for a message from me all to-morrow afternoon. He must not
  leave&mdash;all the afternoon and evening, mind.' You will stay, will you
  not? I promised that you would."</p>

  <p>"I shall stay," I agreed.</p>

  <p>"Is she ill?" Julie inquired. "She is so beautiful&mdash;those great blue
  eyes. I could look into them for hours. And that gorgeous hair! She is the
  most exquisite thing I ever saw, but she shivers all the time. I think she is
  ill. Why does she want to see you? Of course, I think she is marvellous
  but&mdash;I am jealous! ..."</p>

  <p>Louis had nothing to add to his earlier report, but I could tell from his
  manner that he was taking the affair seriously. I abandoned my intention of
  inviting Julie for lunch, and mounted once more to my room. I lunched there,
  I took my coffee and smoked innumerable cigarettes. I lit a pipe and read a
  novel, only to throw the latter away in a few minutes. I searched the
  newspapers. There was nothing. I tried to write letters&mdash;tried and
  failed. I spent most of the time listening.</p>

  <p>Then at last it came&mdash;towards late evening&mdash;the message for
  which I had been waiting. Even the telephone instrument itself seemed to
  reflect the grim forebodings of crisis. Her voice&mdash;a rather pleasant
  voice&mdash;seemed utterly changed. Her throat was hoarse like the throat of
  one exhausted with undue efforts of speech.</p>

  <p>"Captain Lyson&mdash;you are there?"</p>

  <p>"I'm here," I answered. "What has happened? Do you want me to come to the
  studio?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please&mdash;as quickly as you can! I do not know how you will get
  in. Everyone else has gone. Mr. Lann has just been round and locked all the
  doors. He is setting a scene. I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to be afraid of," I told her. "I'm coming. I shall be
  with you in twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"Oh, how wonderful!" I heard her say. "And you must bring&mdash;bring
  help. I think something terrible is going to happen. I am sure
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sound of her voice ended abruptly. There was a stifled cry. I heard a
  sound as though a door had been slammed. Then her voice once more&mdash;very
  faint.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I am afraid!"</p>

  <p>After that&mdash;silence.</p>

  <p>In two minutes I was prepared to leave the place. Once more the telephone
  rang. I hesitated whether or not to answer it. The seconds might be precious.
  Reluctantly, however, I snatched at the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Lyson speaking. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Inspector Sharnbrook," came the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven!" I gasped. "I was just coming round. Miss Hansom has rung
  me up from the studio. There's trouble out there. You had better bring men.
  I'm off to see what I can do."</p>

  <p>"But I am up at Epping," Sharnbrook groaned. "Just found Phillip Dean, or
  what's left of him, poor fellow, tied to a tree in the wood. A horrible
  business. Ring up Marlow at the Yard, Captain Lyson. Tell him to take a squad
  along and meet you. I will go straight there myself."</p>

  <p>Everything I did, I did mechanically. Marlow was to start within five
  minutes. I had the idea of taking the stairs in one quick burst, but pulled
  myself together in time. I might need all the breath I had presently. I took
  the lift down and hurried to the place where I was allowed to leave my car on
  the other side of the Court.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it seemed to me that I had never driven faster, at other times I
  was amazed that I was driving so carefully. The lights were just lit and a
  slight fog was hanging about, but I seemed to get into the by-ways in no
  time. There was very little traffic. The red lights meant nothing to me. I
  drove with my accelerator down, crouching over the wheel, deaf to the
  whistles and the angry shouts which followed me. I remembered my way entirely
  by instinct. I took the right corner without hesitation, when I am perfectly
  certain that in a saner moment I should have paused in doubt...</p>

  <p>Arrived at my destination, I found myself face to face with a great mass
  of buildings. The first entrance gates were locked. The porter's lodge was
  empty. I went on almost to the end of the line of studios before I was able
  to make my way inside through a space where a fallen wall was being repaired.
  I passed down the broad drive and pulled up at last in a little pool of
  darkness under some trees opposite the studio of which I was in search.</p>

  <p>The front door, as I expected, was locked and barred. The windows, which
  looked chiefly into the offices, were nothing but blank sheets of glass. I
  went up and down the side and the front and found no means of entrance. There
  was not a soul anywhere about&mdash;not a light to be seen. The studio, I
  knew, was on the ground floor behind these offices, but the way to it was
  barred by a high wall and a spiked gate.</p>

  <p>There was only one means of access to the building that I could see, for a
  man in a desperate hurry, and that I made use of. I emptied the shells from
  my revolver, gripped it by the muzzle, and smashed the nearest window, using
  my coat to deaden the sound. Then I scrambled into the deserted room, and
  paused for a moment to listen and take breath.</p>

  <p>The outer door into the passage was locked; but from the inner office
  there was a flight of stairs leading upwards. I ran up these, slipping back
  the shells into my gun, and with my torch in my left hand. On the landing,
  which I reached in half a dozen strides, was a mercifully open door. I turned
  down a corridor to And at the end of it only a fire escape.</p>

  <p>Then for the first time I had evidence that I was not alone in the
  building. Only twenty or thirty feet below, from the large projection room of
  the studio, I heard the smooth, pleasant voice of Osmond Lann. I stood
  rigid&mdash;listening.</p>

  <p>A curious sense of unreality crept over me. I had either gone crazy, or
  this was some dream. Lann's voice, scarcely raised above its usual pitch, was
  clearly audible. He was giving some quite ordinary stage directions. His tone
  was kindly and unflurried. There was no suggestion of anything unusual going
  on.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to trouble you again," I heard him say, "but you must grip that
  goblet of wine you have there a little more
  naturally&mdash;greedily&mdash;so. When I put on this record,
  remember&mdash;you must all stop drinking and look up. The music astonishes
  you. Your quarrels are all forgotten. There must be a look of reverence in
  your eyes as you lean forward."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of voices from below. I crept towards the iron rail of
  the fire-escape and descended some dozen rungs. I was now in what seemed to
  be an empty loft, but with an open space in the wall. I groped towards it and
  in a moment found myself looking down into the main studio where, scarcely a
  dozen yards away, the strange business of making a film in comparative
  darkness seemed to be in progress.</p>

  <p>Creeping cautiously a few inches farther forward, I could see ten or
  twelve men seated at a rough trestle table. Something about their grouping
  seemed to me curiously familiar.</p>

  <p>It was more like a dream picture than anything I had ever seen. Every one
  of the men was wearing the strangely-fashioned clothes of thousands of years
  ago There were loaves of bread upon the table, and great earthenware jars of
  wine. Osmond Lann, in a long cloak of brown wool, one end of which was thrown
  over his shoulder, was moving up and down, changing the position of one man,
  rearranging the flowing robe of another, refilling the glass of a third.</p>

  <p>Ail this I saw only by straining my eyes, for the sole illumination came
  from a single lamp in the middle of the room. The two great cameras on their
  stands were both out of use. The room seemed cold and dead The only other
  article of furniture in it was a wooden couch covered all over with bundles
  of sacking.</p>

  <p>"Remember," I heard Lann say, "you wake from a drowsy slumber at the sound
  of the music. The fumes of the wine are still with you, but when you hear the
  music you forget...Just as you are, then."</p>

  <p>He crossed the floor with long, graceful strides, selected a record and
  placed it upon an opened gramophone. While he was bending over his task, one
  of the figures at the table half rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lann!" he called out.</p>

  <p>Lann swung round, and I seemed to see his frame stiffen. I had the idea
  that he was angry His voice was severe and stern.</p>

  <p>"There is to be no speech." he said</p>

  <p>"But I ask you, sir," the man continued, "what is the use of this:
  grouping and rehearsal, when there is no camera going and no lighting? You
  must forgive me if I say that it seems like waste of time We are all of the
  same mind."</p>

  <p>There was an uneasy murmur from the others, and for the first time I
  realised that they were under the influence of some sort of dope, for their
  voices were thick and confused.</p>

  <p>"You must leave all this to me," Lann begged in a tone of gentle
  persuasion. "I wish to have this picture in my mind. Presently we shall do it
  to the hiss of the cameras and with the lights burning you up. This is more
  the real thing we are rehearsing. That will be the artificial."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This time there was a curiously menacing note in Lann's voice.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>The music had begun to steal into the place, the strangest music I had
  ever heard, the fervent, supplicating voices of human beings in agony, with
  an undernote of raw, uncouth chords melting now and then into harmony. Lann
  listened in the attitude of a man well pleased, then he turned towards the
  switch. More lights flashed out into the room I realised instantly what I had
  already suspected. Those eleven figures seated at the table were helpless.
  They were lolling in every conceivable pose of abandon. The coarse tablecloth
  was stained with spilt wine. Two of the jars had been overturned and from one
  the wine was still dripping. Lann moved his head gently as though in
  approval.</p>

  <p>"That's good," he said. "It is very good indeed. Now be careful. Let there
  be no speech."</p>

  <p>He turned his back upon them, moved towards the wooden couch, stooped down
  and flung away the coverings. It seemed to me that there was blood in my eyes
  as I dug my nails into the soft partition by means of which I was supporting
  myself. Christine Hansom was lying below me bound with cords to the side of
  the couch! As the lights flooded the room her cry of agony drowned even the
  swelling crescendo of the music.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" she shrieked. "Will none of you help? He means murder! Are
  you cowards, you others?"</p>

  <p>The man who had spoken to Lann staggered to his feet, only to fall in a
  heap across the table.</p>

  <p>"It's this beastly muck he's shoved down our throats!"</p>

  <p>There was an uneasy sense of movement and more groaning. Two or three of
  the men at the table struggled up, only to collapse again. Lann looked round
  at them reproachfully. He was curiously and completely isolated.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he ordered. "This is the critical moment. Let no one
  interfere!"</p>

  <p>He turned his back upon them, and thrusting his hand underneath his gown
  drew out a long knife. Christine's cry of horror rang through the building. I
  leaned forward into space, holding the partition with my left hand.</p>

  <p>"Lann!" I cried. "If you don't drop that knife, I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>He turned and faced me without the slightest trace of discomposure Even at
  that moment there was something beautiful in his expression.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see who you are." he said, "but this knife was put into my hand
  to rob the world of sin! Sin lies there bound at my mercy. Whoever you
  are&mdash;would you choose to have the world set free from sin, or pass on to
  the end in names and misery?"</p>

  <p>"If you touch that woman," I warned him, making a fierce effort to imitate
  his self-possession, "I will shoot you dead where you stand. You're mad.
  Lann! Try to remember that's a live woman there! Just for a moment come back
  to earth. Listen to the truth. You're a madman in a world of sane people! If
  you touch her you will hang!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at me tolerantly, with very much the air of a grown-up listening
  to a fractious child. I fancy myself as a shot, and I took care that my
  bullet was only a foot from his head. He never even winced. The echoes of the
  discharge seemed to fill the place. The smile remained upon his face.</p>

  <p>"The next one will be in your heart!" I warned him.</p>

  <p>Still that smile, but this time there was a curious gleam of cunning in
  his eyes. He moved to the other side of the couch, dropped on one knee and
  leaned over the woman by whose body he was now more or less shielded. The
  knife was glistening in his hand, and slowly creeping higher.</p>

  <p>Outside the studio it seemed to me that there was a confused babel of
  sound. I called out at the top of my voice for help. I looked below and I was
  afraid. I sent another bullet through the roof. One of the men from the table
  had risen to his feet and struggled across the floor, but he fell to the
  ground groaning. The knife had reached a steady position, and it seemed to me
  that I could see the fire in the man's eyes, see him stiffen himself for the
  blow. I realised then that it was useless to wait. I must take my chance. I
  stretched out my arm and fired...I knew that my finger had never faltered,
  but a moment of madness seized me, too. I heard the sound of Lann's cry of
  agony and it was like music; but it came too late. I had taken the risk of my
  twenty-foot Jump, and the building seemed to be falling in upon me.</p>

  <p><br>
  When I opened my eyes, Sharnbrook and I seemed to be the only people in the
  studio. I took a long gulp from the flask he was holding towards me.</p>

  <p>"Where's everybody?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Eleven doped men I have had to send to the hospital for the moment," he
  confided. "Miss Hansom is sitting in the car outside. It took Marlow and
  three men to get Lann out of the place. He is screaming mad&mdash;must have
  been coming on for years."</p>

  <p>I looked upwards at the broken boarding.</p>

  <p>"Pretty good jump, that, Sharnbrook," I said, struggling to my feet.</p>

  <p>"It was a mighty good shot," he replied with a grin. "Clean through his
  forearm! Come along&mdash;this way."</p>

  <p>A waft of fresh air in the passage made a new man of me. I could even wave
  my hand to Christine Hansom, who was leaning out of the opened window of the
  limousine. I still felt, however, like a man on the fringe of delirium.</p>

  <p>"I drove down here in seventeen minutes," I told Sharnbrook, clutching at
  his arm. "I shall have a dozen police summonses in the morning!"</p>

  <p>"We'll take care of those," he promised.</p>

    "The Third Shot"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">UNDER cover of my midday edition of the "Evening Standard,"
  I watched the girl come sauntering up the long narrow passage between the
  tables to the place where I was seated. Everyone stared at her. She had the
  air of one who has recently arrived from a journey, but her clothes possessed
  cut and distinction. Her hat and veil were distinctly Fifth Avenue, and her
  nails had just that exotic touch of pink that only the American manicurists
  seem able to produce.</p>

  <p>When she reached the end of the room, instead of swinging round to the
  entrance doors, she stopped in front of my table.</p>

  <p>"How do you do. Captain Lyson?" she asked affably.</p>

  <p>I promptly lowered my paper and rose to my feet. I realised her
  significance, but for the moment I was unable to place her. She was extra
  ordinarily young, but she had been over lavish with all those little touches
  which the fashions of the moment seem to demand. Her eye lashes had been
  tampered with, al though they would have been just as attractive untouched.
  Her lips were becarmined clumsily, but her beautifully shaped mouth still
  retained its charm. Her hair, however, remained natural, a beautiful corn
  color, and her sleepy eyes were just the right shade of brown.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my name is Lyson," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"I was at Daddy Maine's party the other night." she reminded me.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I remember. Won't you sit down?" I invited, still secretly
  perplexed.</p>

  <p>She glanced over her shoulder out into the courtyard. The waiter held a
  chair for her and she sank grace fully into it.</p>

  <p>"How long does it take to get here from Southampton?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"About two hours," I told her. "Are you expecting anyone on this
  boat?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so." she confided. "I had word last night some of the Rawson
  boys were coming along, and I'm afraid they'll make it ugly for Ed if they
  do. Ed's my partner, you know. He's in the show with me."</p>

  <p>I recognised her then. She was a recent importation from the States and
  had drifted from Dorchester House to a well-known cabaret, where she was
  doing dancing and songs.</p>

  <p>"Of course," I said. "You are Myra, aren't you, and your partner's name is
  Ed?"</p>

  <p>She smiled approvingly. "That's right. Myra and Ed. Of the Caf&eacute; de Lyon
  Cabaret."</p>

  <p>"Will you have some coffee?" I invited.</p>

  <p>She shook her head reluctantly. "I guess I'd better not stay around just
  now." she said "I'm scared about the crowd that's coming over. There might be
  a shooting. Ed went down to Waterloo to check them off from the special. He
  ought to have been back an hour ago."</p>

  <p>She had moved her chair so as to be able to see into the court; suddenly
  she sprang to her feet. She waved her hand desperately at a young man who had
  just driven up in a blue two-seater. "That's Ed!" she exclaimed. "You'll
  excuse me?"</p>

  <p>A certain fear that she might return with Ed in tow led me to call for my
  bill. My old friend Jules looked at me curiously as I signed.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur a bien dejeune?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Comme toujours."</p>

  <p>He lingered for a moment. It was obvious there was something he would have
  liked to say if he had dared. In the end he made his little bow and departed.
  The omnipotent Louis, however, when I reached his desk, was less reticent. He
  glanced up and down the room and leaned forward. "May I be permitted a word
  of advice, my young friend?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Louis. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"The young lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very chic," I interrupted. "Myra Grey. Dancing now at the Caf&eacute; de Lyon.
  Myra and Ed. you know."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is a friend." Louis said gravely, patting the back of my hand.
  "I give him serious advice. Do not encourage the acquaintance of
  Mademoiselle. Just now, at any rate, she is not a good person to know. Please
  remember that."</p>

  <p>I was puzzled. Louis' advice was good to follow at any time but it seemed
  strangely given, in the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the child?" I asked. "She can scarcely be out of
  her teens."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not." was the grim reply. "There are two detectives in this room,
  though, who are doing all they can to keep her and her boy friend in sight.
  He is wanted in New York. They are a tough crowd. Captain. They do not belong
  to the places they are going. Do not be led into joining any of their
  parties. Keep away! Take my advice. Captain Lyson."</p>

  <p>"From what I have seen of Ed." I observed as I turned away, "I probably
  shall."</p>

  <p>I have a fancy when dining at a restaurant where dancing is a part of the
  evening's amusement for sitting in the background and issuing forth at
  reasonable intervals. Julie Louis' attractive daughter, preferred to sit at a
  table on the dancing floor and plunge into the thick of it the moment the
  music started. I gave in to her as I generally did, and we were on our feet
  most of the time. Julie was one of the most delightful partners in the world.
  The music, too, was world-famous. I enjoyed every minute of it and yet, when
  the signal was given from the orchestra that the cabaret was about to
  commence. I led her back to our table and sank into my chair with a sigh of
  satisfaction. She looked at me searchingly with her head on one side.</p>

  <p>"You like no longer to dance with me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Julie, my darling, there is nothing in the world I enjoy more," I assured
  her. "I thought it pleasant to sit down because I am still with you, and next
  to dancing with you I like to look at you. Incidentally. I have been on my
  feet all day."</p>

  <p>Julie, although she loved to dance, loved also to eat, and for a time we
  devoted ourselves to a perfectly cooked <i>sole colbert</i>. A Spanish lady
  danced for us and met with a reasonable amount of appreciation. During the
  brief interval, the manager came across to pay his respects.</p>

  <p>"You have a wonderful crowd tonight. Gustave." I observed.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "We have a tum which is unique in all the world."</p>

  <p>"The American couple?"</p>

  <p>"Ed and Myra," he assented. "There has never been seen such dancing in
  London. But this new idea of theirs&mdash;well. I find it a little too much
  for me," he added deprecatingly. "They are introducing a novelty. For myself
  I am not so sure that it is what the people want."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in the changed performance. I trust, which makes it
  unsuitable for the young?"</p>

  <p>Julie rapped my knuckles and Gustave smiled. "It is not that sort of
  affair." he assured me.</p>

  <p>Julie heaved a delicate little sigh of disappointment.</p>

  <p>Gustave was on the point of leaving us, but I called him back. I pointed
  to a very desirable table in the front row, a few yards from our own. "What
  fortunate couple are you keeping that for. Gustave?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"That table is kept for two gentlemen&mdash;strangers, but still very
  important people. You will see."</p>

  <p>The cabaret continued. An attractive-looking Frenchwoman sang two or three
  songs. There was some freak pianoforte playing. Then the lights went up, the
  music crashed and dancing began again.</p>

  <p>"All these shows," I observed to Julie as we loitered through a very slow
  foxtrot, "are monotonous."</p>

  <p>"Did not Monsieur Gustave say that he had found a novelty for us?"</p>

  <p>"He has perhaps the two most skilful dancers in the world from an
  acrobatic point of view," I acknowledged. "But unless they can invent a
  perfectly new dance they are not likely to have a very great success. The
  girl is extraordinarily beautiful. That might help, of course."</p>

  <p>Julie drew a little away from me. "She is a friend of
  yours&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"I met her at one of those silly parties one goes to for a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>My partner looked at me severely. "I do not like it that you go to these
  night places alone and meet so many beautiful women."</p>

  <p>She paused, then asked with a smile, "By the way, Just how old are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I am thirty-seven," I told her. "Eighteen years older than you."</p>

  <p>She sighed with content. "To be thirty-seven is not to call oneself a
  Methuselah," she said. "I was afraid it might have been worse. It is because
  Father always says you are so trustworthy that I think of you as being older
  than you are."</p>

  <p>"If we were in your little salon," I confided, "I should box your ears."
  She laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>Just then the music paused. The familiar rattle took its place.</p>

  <p>"Myra and Ed," I said.</p>

  <p>The lights were growing dim. The dance orchestra had slipped away from
  their places. The music had changed its character. Two men glided into the
  vacant places at the table on the dancing floor which had I been empty all
  the evening. One was short and fat, with clean-shaven face, benevolent
  expression but a peculiar mouth. The other was thinner, a little gaunt, with
  high cheek bones. They both wore dinner coats and black ties. They were
  smoking rather over-sized cigars, and a bottle of champagne stood in the ice
  by their side.</p>

  <p>"Our new neighbors," I whispered to Julie, "are scarcely worthy of their
  prominent position."</p>

  <p>Julie was too occupied to take much notice of my remarks. The lowering of
  the lights and that clear staccato music was having its effect upon her.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she gripped my wrist. Coming down the broad flight of stairs from
  the balcony floor was the strangest figure I had ever seen. It was a
  man&mdash;a young man&mdash;bent almost double, creeping down with long,
  slinking footsteps, pausing every now and then, glancing around
  fearfully.</p>

  <p>His fair hair was plastered straight over his forehead, coming down almost
  to his eyebrows. His long fingers reached the stairs; sometimes as he paused
  in his descent he balanced himself leaning on the palm of one hand. As he
  drew nearer, one realised that he was giving an impression of a man in deadly
  fear. On the last few stairs his pace became slower. He hesitated before
  taking that last step on to the dancing floor.</p>

  <p>There was a silence in the room which, after a few seconds, became
  absolutely uncanny. One could almost hear the pent-up anticipation, almost
  feel the excitement of the crowd. It resolved itself into a little gasping
  murmur&mdash;the indrawn breaths of many people.</p>

  <p>With the spotlight focused upon her, the girl was coming slowly from the
  shadows behind our chairs. I had tried to tell Julie that she was beautiful,
  but I felt then that nothing I could have said was adequate. Her figure was
  the figure of a fairy. Her steps, miracles of graceful progress. She was
  smiling, but there was a faint expression of hunger in her eyes, a queer,
  stifled desire, a line almost of cruelty in that young but perfect mouth.
  Then, as she reached the edge of the dancing floor her arms were slowly
  outstretched. The man who had crawled his way down the stairs straightened
  himself&mdash;a long, lithe figure with greedy, deep-set eyes and satyr-like
  mouth.</p>

  <p>The music suddenly changed. Even as they stood looking at one another, it
  became harshly passionate, with a murmuring voluptuous rhythm dying away
  underneath. They came together like a flash of lightning. Her arms were
  around his neck. He lifted her high off the floor. They were away at the
  other end of the room. Her feet, too, were joining in the riot of action.
  They danced. Such dancing.</p>

  <p>"Ah, mais c'est ravissant!" I heard Julie's stifled whisper.</p>

  <p>She was clutching my arm fiercely. The light of the room seemed to be
  coming and going, according to the movements of that frantic dance.</p>

  <p>They passed sometimes with slow, passionate steps, sometimes in a whirl,
  the girl's lips parted, the light in her eyes matching the burning in his.
  Then the music grew slower.</p>

  <p>When I realised that the end of the dance was coming, I felt what dozens
  of people told me afterwards that they, too, felt&mdash;a great relief. It
  was torturing to watch it was naked passion burst loose. Their footsteps were
  moving to a different tune. One felt that it was the end.</p>

  <p>The music led the dancers to the last sobbing bar. Her arms were around
  his neck. She drew him towards the place where our two neighbors were seated.
  One arm unwound itself. They were preparing, as it seemed to me, to make
  their bow. Then from the table close to us came the sudden sound of a chair
  kicked away. There was the muffled report of a gun. The long arms of the
  dancer shot over his head. Two waiters rushed to hold him up. Myra's scream
  of horror rang out through the place. A pandemonium of voices beat against
  the ceiling. Those who were near saw the dark spot on his evening shirt
  slowly grow larger. They half carried, half dragged him up the
  stairs.</p><a id="pic6"

  <p>Gustave and half a dozen of his myrmidons blocked the way at the foot.
  There must be no rush. Gustave seemed trying to quiet the hysterical crowd.
  Suddenly there was again that strange rattle from somewhere behind the
  orchestra.</p>

  <p>The music was playing the same staccato, elf-like harmony which had
  heralded the approach of the dancers. I felt my forehead and found it wet.
  Julie had her arms around my neck. We were both of us staring at the other
  flight of stairs down which, with the same slow stealthy movements, came the
  dancer.</p>

  <p>A miracle had happened! The shirt he was wearing was un crumbled and
  unstained. Only his hair flopped about his face and almost covered his eyes.
  He paused for a moment to brush it away. A death-like silence seemed to have
  stolen throughout the place. With those strange, slinking steps once more he
  reached the floor.</p>

  <p>There was a floating wave of perfume close to our chairs, a faint movement
  of skirts.</p>

  <p>The girl had come out from the background. She passed our table, she
  passed the table where the two men had been seated&mdash;empty ever since the
  sound of that gun. She held out her arms She was across the floor with the
  same wonderful bound. She was in the air&mdash;she was being held close to
  his heart&mdash;she was lifted up&mdash;shaken passionately all in a few
  seconds. And then they danced.</p>

  <p>The music resolved itself almost without our being able to trace the
  beginnings into one of the old fashioned Viennese waltzes. It grew faster and
  faster, became louder and louder, the dance wilder, but drowning everything
  else was the applause, which it seemed to me would never end even after the
  dance was over. Six times after they had climbed the stairs, the dancers came
  back.</p>

  <p>The cheering went on. No one would go away. Gustave realised that the
  guests were still half-dazed. They needed an explanation.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "we have presented to you to-night a
  dance dramatisation of a killing. The two gangsters were part of the show;
  the revolver was simply a revival of an old trick; the changed shirt and
  collar were waiting for our male performer at the top of the stairs. I feel
  that these explanations are due to you because of the astonishing
  interpretation given by my two artists which I do not mind telling you has
  been a revelation to all."</p>

  <p>No such success as was achieved by Myra and Ed in their amazing turn had
  ever been vouchsafed to any cabaret performance, since night snows had become
  established in the West End of London. The Caf&eacute; de Lyon, almost in
  self-defence, doubled their prices, and even then every table in the place
  was booked for weeks and weeks ahead.</p>

  <p>I never had any desire, however, to witness the performance again. Julie,
  with various friends, must have gone a dozen times. Even Louis on his
  crutches had himself transported there one Sunday night. Curiously enough, he
  shared a certain shrinking which I had felt from the first at the
  spectacle.</p>

  <p>"It is too near reality," Louis decided. "The girl," he went on, "well, in
  effect she terrifies me! She is not acting. She feels it. There is no one
  like her upon the stage. But for myself my heart beats too fast I cannot
  watch her."</p>

  <p>"You and I are of one mind, Louis," I muttered.</p>

  <p>"Ever look up their dossiers down at the Yard?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not interested," I said.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing definite against the girl except associations," Louis
  said, "but the man has a notch on his gun. He was very lucky to escape a
  murder trial."</p>

  <p><br>
  Four days later I was finishing my luncheon, when I saw Myra coming slowly up
  the carpeted way towards my table. I had a newspaper propped up before me,
  but it was a useless subterfuge. I knew the exact moment when she paused in
  front of the table. I lowered my paper and rose to my feet mechanically. She
  looked at me and smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"You are the only man in London," she said, "who has not sent me a message
  of congratulation. Most of them&mdash;more than that."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely thought," I replied, "that I knew you well enough."</p>

  <p>She signalled to a waiter&mdash;there were half a dozen hanging round
  waiting for a word or a glance from her. She accepted a chair and sat down. I
  had no alternative but to resume my own seat.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to know me better, my fierce friend?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, no," I answered. "That may sound rude, but I have a fancy that
  you are like me in one respect you are truthful."</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her chair, her fingers tapping the tablecloth, her eyes
  searching for mine. She seemed somehow to diffuse an atmosphere for which I
  could find no words. "Say, you're scared of me." she declared.</p>

  <p>I Jumped at the by-way of excuse. "It is true," I admitted. "I sit here
  even now in mortal terror. Is that bullet due for my chest?"</p>

  <p>She turned her head lazily. Ed had followed her and was standing behind
  her. With his long hair, his sallow complexion and displeasing expression, he
  seemed to belong somehow to a foreign and unfriendly world.</p>

  <p>"Say, you'd better meet Ed," she drawled, "Captain Lyson. You've no need
  to go gunning with him, Ed He's not walking down my street if he can help
  it."</p>

  <p>"My fault we didn't meet at the party the other night," Ed remarked. "I
  was canned before we got there. Somehow over here the liquor don't seem so
  fierce but it goes to the spot a darn sight faster."</p>

  <p>He was reaching out for a chair heedless of the lack of any invitation,
  but the girl stopped him with a lazy gesture. "Wait for me in the car," she
  enjoined.</p>

  <p>He obeyed without demur. Left alone with me she edged her chair a little
  closer.</p>

  <p>"He's common, Ed, isn't he?" she said sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"He is an amazing dancer," I observed.</p>

  <p>"He learnt that on the sidewalk," she said. "Say, I saw you at the first
  night of our show."</p>

  <p>"I was there," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"Anything to say about it?"</p>

  <p>"It was the most wonderful show of its sort I ever saw," I told her. "You
  are the most beautiful dancer I have ever seen. Ed is quite the best male
  dancer in the world."</p>

  <p>"And then?" She tapped with her fingers upon the tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"I like your finger-nails," I confided. "I think you must have brought
  your manicurist over with you."</p>

  <p>The smile which had parted her lips faded. They quivered, became suddenly
  tremulous. I remembered that it was a child against whose spell I was
  fighting. She was looking down at her nails.</p>

  <p>"We don't seem to get to understand one another very well, do we?" she
  complained. "I guess you English are about as slow as they said you
  were&mdash;or are you really scared of me, Captain Lyson?"</p>

  <p>"Terrified to breath," I confessed. "I wish you would go away."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Listen. Do you know why we came to London?"</p>

  <p>"Got into trouble in New York," I replied, not too amiably.</p>

  <p>"We sure did," she admitted. "There was a guy who took the opposite line
  to you. He was crazy about me. Ed turned irritable, although it was no
  concern of his, and they started gunning. He got his&mdash;that poor
  fellow&mdash;and Ed very nearly got the chair. Anyway, it ended our show in
  New York. I Just wondered whether you had heard of it. Perhaps you're scared
  of Ed?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am," I agreed. "I don't like men who go gunning."</p>

  <p>"If a man has a girl or thinks he has, he's got to keep her some way,"
  Myra argued. "If Ed was the sort I could marry, perhaps he'd calm down. But I
  couldn't. Do you know how old I am? Sixteen," she confided. "It's time I knew
  what I wanted, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She was telling the truth. I was suddenly sure of it. She was little more
  than a child and yet all this woman's stuff was bubbling up in her.</p>

  <p>I rose to my feet. "Look here, Miss Myra," I said. "I don't care how old
  you are. I don't care whether you marry Ed or not. I want you to leave me
  alone."</p>

  <p>"I never ought to have come over with Ed," she sighed. "I feel that now.
  It's going to be difficult for me to go on." She rose unwillingly to her
  feet. "Ill go if you'll promise me one thing."</p>

  <p>"All right," I replied. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"When I send a card, will you come and see our show once more?"</p>

  <p>"I will," I promised.</p>

  <p>She picked up her purse, favored me with a little nod and strolled
  off.</p>

  <p>A table at the Caf&eacute; de Lyon in those days was worth a ten pound tip to any
  ma&icirc;tre d'hotel attached to the place, but there was no hesitation when I
  presented the card which I had found in my room that morning. Julie and I
  were ushered to the same places we had occupied previously. This time,
  however, we were just units in a packed mass of West End sightseers. It was
  with the utmost difficulty that enough space had been kept for the
  performance. Dancing by the diners was out of the question, the place was
  jammed.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen anything like this in my life," Julie cried.</p>

  <p>"There has never been such a hit in my memory," I agreed. "I don't know
  why. The show is dramatic, of course, but it's rather horrible."</p>

  <p>"It is exciting," Julie said in a low tone but with sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>I wished that I had never given the promise to come.</p>

  <p>"I believe you are excited, too," Julie laughed. "You are so pale. But
  your eyes I like, to-night."</p>

  <p>"I simply detest the whole show. The sooner it is over, the better I shall
  be pleased," I assured her.</p>

  <p>Julie, very light-hearted and happy, chattered away and gradually I became
  more normal. Nevertheless, I shivered when I saw the two conspirators in
  their dinner jackets take their places near us. The lights grew dim One heard
  a fluttering sigh from the closely packed audience. Down the stairs Ed was
  crawling, looking furtively from side to side His face seemed ghastly pale
  against the shadows. He was more like an animal than a man.</p>

  <p>He was nearing the bottom stair when I heard half-stifled exclamation and
  knew that Myra was coming. She made her way slowly. Now and then she touched
  a table as though to balance herself, for the passage had grown narrower and
  narrower. Just behind the front row, a man was seated alone by the side of a
  pillar, a long, lean-faced man with black eyes. Her fingers, it seemed as
  though by accident, touched his arm as she passed. Then she paused and with
  one swift forward step was on the floor. The music was playing a little
  louder and it seemed, as their arms went out towards one another, that she
  had leaped straight into the rhythm of it. Like the wind, she seemed to have
  found his embrace and the dance began.</p>

  <p>I watched, and there was not any doubt at all that Ed was the most
  marvellous dancer in the world. It was the same performance over again, but
  with the nearing of the climax. I felt the sense of excitement grow almost
  unbearable.</p>

  <p>The crisis came at last. Both the men in their dinner jackets had levelled
  their revolvers. The shots spat out. I found myself still listening. I could
  have sworn that I had heard three, but the men who had fired were doing their
  stunt, racing for the back exit. Ed had once more collapsed, the sinister
  spot was showing on his shirt front. Myra's shriek supplied the last thrill
  of horror and the little procession passed up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The music went on, hesitated and then went on again. The time for the
  triumphant descent by the other flight of stairs had arrived. Ed should have
  been there in his clean shirt and his evil, mocking face. There was no sign
  of him, but there were indications of trouble behind. I felt a sudden catch
  in my breath. I looked towards the table by the pillar. The man who had been
  seated there had disappeared. The wine from a bottle which had fallen to the
  floor was creeping in a thin stream across the carpet.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Charles?" Julie gasped. Gustave was standing half way down
  the stairs holding on to the banisters. His voice was broken. "Ladies and
  gentlemen&mdash;an unfortunate accident...There will be no more performance
  to-night. If everyone would kindly leave without undue haste."</p>

  <p>There was a volume of eager shouting. The orchestra left their places. I
  called to Gustave and he came towards me, his face as white as chalk. I
  capped the small table by the side of the pillar.</p>

  <p>"The third shot," I told him, "came from the man who was seated here."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">IT was perfectly well understood at the Milan Grill Room
  that, unless I telephoned by at least an hour before the usual time for
  luncheon, the third table on the right against the wall as one entered the
  room was reserved for me. It was somewhat of a shock, therefore, to enter the
  place on a certain eventful morning, glance towards my table and find it
  occupied by perfect strangers. I turned to a favorite ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel who
  happened to be passing.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of that?" I asked severely.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders as only a Provencal can do.</p>

  <p>"C'est Monsieur Louis." he confided. "Another table has been prepared for
  Monsieur."</p>

  <p>I turned round to where Louis was seated at his pulpit-like desk. He
  beckoned to me with his usual respectful gesture and I knew at once that
  there was some reason for this unexpected happening. I leaned towards him and
  indulged in a word or two of remonstrance. He stopped me at once.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Capitane." he said. "I ask your pardon for having changed
  your position to-day. I am begging for your help. A young lady, whose father
  was one of my most valued clients, has embarked upon an enterprise which
  fills me with misgivings. I cannot dissuade her from it. She lunches here in
  a quarter of an hour under conditions which I consider highly dangerous. She
  needs supervision; if necessary, a strong arm and a quick wit. I have
  ventured to give you a table next to hers in a more secluded corner of the
  room and I am also considering the matter of asking you to accept the
  companionship of another man whom I think you know slightly."</p>

  <p>"Is it to lead anywhere&mdash;this affair, Louis?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>Louis, although he appeared to the world to be nothing more than the head
  waiter at the Milan Grill Room, was a man of importance in many other ways.
  Scotland Yard trusted him with their inquiries. A certain Secret Service
  branch of considerable importance, of which I myself was a humble member,
  made frequent use of him. He shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>"This is just a little drama such as you love to watch happening in the
  very midst of the turmoil of life." he said. "Intervention may be
  necessary&mdash;I trust not. The luncheon party in which I desire you to take
  an interest will be of two, then there will come a third. It is my hope that
  it will end with you and the man who shares your table at luncheon also
  included."</p>

  <p>"Never in my life. Louis," I confided, "have you sent me to luncheon in
  such a confused state of mind. I don't know what to look for or what to
  expect."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled at me in kindly, almost fatherly fashion. I could not help
  thinking to myself what a handsome picture he presented with his black hair,
  his finely-shaped features and complexion of that waxen pallor which seemed
  to have nothing whatever to do with ill-health. He waved his hand to a waiter
  who was lingering below. I was escorted to my new quarters, a table neatly
  arranged for two, next to one in the most secluded corner in the room.</p>

  <p>The change from my usual surroundings was so complete that I could
  scarcely believe that I was in the same restaurant, yet in a moment or two
  the old associations asserted themselves. There was another larger table, but
  laid only for two people, in the corner, and in the background there was our
  giant ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, Jose, a born fighter, who did very little waiting
  indeed, although no one's black tie or shirt front was more immaculate, but
  who was always hovering round if trouble came. In these surroundings I took
  up the menu and ordered my lunch. Even though the gloom of this sunless
  corner was a little depressing, there remained the thrill of coming adventure
  which Louis' guarded words had inspired.</p>

  <p>I am afraid that my response to Sub-Commissioner Parkinson's pleasant
  greeting, as he paused at my table before I had even finished my cocktail,
  was not an entirely cordial one. Apart from my conversation with Louis, it
  happened to be just one of those days when, for other reasons, I was not
  particularly anxious to be seen on intimate terms with a representative of
  Scotland Yard, however distinguished.</p>

  <p>"All alone?" I inquired grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"I am in that unfortunate position," the Sub-Commissioner, who was a tall,
  hatchet-faced man acknowledged. "That isn't all, either. I am on just one of
  those jobs when it doesn't do to attract attention, and there is nothing
  which makes one so conspicuous as to be lunching alone in a place like
  this."</p>

  <p>I summoned a waiter and ordered him to bring another cocktail. My
  uninvited guest handed his stick and hat to a passing cloakroom
  attendant.</p>

  <p>"The trouble about you, my dear Lyson," my companion remarked, as he took
  up the menu, "is that you have too many activities. You are a valued member,
  I understand, of M17B which brings you at times into touch with my own
  organisation, and you are also a cock-a-hoop Journalist."</p>

  <p>"Cock-a-hoop fiddlesticks!" I answered resentfully. "I am on a job now
  which, if you hadn't come blundering along, and if Louis hadn't rather upset
  my scheme, would have provided me with an excellent story."</p>

  <p>"Let me set your mind at rest at once," the Sub-Commissioner remarked.
  "This time, at any rate, our interests are not so far apart. I am not going
  to steal your thunder. You are not going to interfere with my sleuthing. In
  other words, we are both here as observers of the same possible drama."</p>

  <p>"I might have guessed it," I muttered. "We are the tools of that great man
  who watches us from his seat of vantage. Perhaps you can tell me a little
  more of what it is that we have to expect."</p>

  <p>The Sub-Commissioner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I know very little more about the affair than you yourself," he assured
  me. "I gather from what I have heard that our friend Jose, who for the moment
  is out of sight, will be hanging round as a bodyguard in case there is actual
  trouble, and that you and I are to take such part in the adventure as our
  chivalrous instincts may dictate. Louis is rather like that. He loves a dash
  of mystery."</p>

  <p>"You might give me an idea of what we have to expect," I suggested.</p>

  <p>Parkinson shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"There again, the man of mystery prevails." he said. "You are to pick up
  what you can of the affair by listening and watching. As a matter of fact,
  Louis doesn't know what is going to happen any more than we do. So now to our
  muttons."</p>

  <p>The broiled sole which Parkinson had ordered came along at that moment and
  with the serious business of luncheon established our conversation, after a
  few words of mild invective on my part, became a trifle desultory. Suddenly
  my companion stopped in the middle of a casual sentence. I knew from the keen
  light in his eyes&mdash;rather sunken eyes&mdash;that what was happening in
  the room close at hand was interesting him. I, too, looked up. A girl, well
  but quietly dressed, with an interesting, thoughtful face and sorrowful grey
  eyes, had taken her place at the corner table close to ours. Her companion
  was a middle-aged man of an utterly different type. He was obviously either a
  successful business man, a stockbroker or someone engaged in a similar
  occupation. His keen blue eyes darted here and there, as though in search of
  acquaintances. He handed the menu to his companion with an exaggerated
  gesture of devotion. His voice&mdash;not wholly a pleasant one&mdash;reached
  us distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you fancy, my dear. Oysters are in season now, remember, and if
  you don't fancy them, they always serve good caviare here. A roast pheasant I
  should suggest afterwards, and what about a glass of champagne?"</p>

  <p>The girl, it seemed to me, shivered slightly. Her companion was turning
  over the pages of the wine list and noticed nothing. He had the air of a man
  who was very likely to make mistakes when in the company of a sensitive
  person. We heard her softly-spoken reply.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I never drink champagne in the middle of the day. I should
  like half a dozen oysters, a little cold pheasant and some salad."</p>

  <p>"And to drink?"</p>

  <p>"A light Moselle, or water."</p>

  <p>The man gave his order, then he leaned across the table and began to talk
  in a lowered voice. She sat back in her chair listening, apparently, but with
  a far-away look in her eyes and with an expression about her lips which was
  completely baffling. They had glanced carelessly at us as they had taken
  their places, and it was clear that neither of them had recognised either
  Parkinson or myself.</p>

  <p>"You are right," I told my companion quietly. "All the same, if these are
  two of the puppets in Louis' little drama, I cannot see how I could possibly
  be concerned. I never saw either of them before in my life."</p>

  <p>The Sub-Commissioner remained silent, and I knew just enough of his
  methods to realise that it would be better to follow his example. My
  restraint was rewarded. A moment later he went on speaking in that soft
  velvety tone of his which usually meant that he was interested.</p>

  <p>"I happened to know that the young lady would be here between one and
  half-past two to-day," he confided, "I rang her up in the name of an intimate
  friend, asking her to lunch. I found out that she was coming here, and from
  Louis I found out in whose name that particular table was booked."</p>

  <p>"How did you know that she was going to sit there?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Parkinson smiled.</p>

  <p>"Louis showed me the plan of the room, of course. If you want to know the
  name of the man, though, I will tell you. That is Sir Julien Fairhaven."</p>

  <p>"Never heard of him," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"That seems odd," Parkinson observed, tapping a cigarette upon the
  tablecloth and lighting it. "He's a baronet and I'm not sure that he's not a
  Privy Councillor. He's a director of more companies than I could ever
  remember the names of. He rules in, a dominion which you or I perhaps, don't
  know much about. It is a certainty that his finger-prints have never been
  asked for in Scotland Yard, nor has that scandal mongering newspaper of yours
  ever had occasion to write of him with bated breath or hat in hand. He
  commits no sins, and he subscribes to every hospital in London. He loves to
  hear himself described as a sportsman, and I believe he owns racehorses, but
  for the little he knows about the turf or any other game, he has to pay
  dearly."</p>

  <p>"What relation is he to the girl?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"None at all that I know of. She had a fiance who used to work on
  half-commission for a stockbroking firm Sir Julien was interested in. Perhaps
  that's how they became acquainted."</p>

  <p>"Is there a Lady Fairhaven?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>My companion looked at me with shocked surprise.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lyson!" he exclaimed. "I thought even you knew a little more
  about the social world than that. Lady Fairhaven was a Moray!"</p>

  <p>A mutual acquaintance who paused to gossip with us broke off our
  conversation. When we were alone again it was Parkinson who asked me a
  question.</p>

  <p>"You lunch here every day, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Generally," I admitted, "I came this morning, though, because I wanted to
  see something of a young man with rather a queer history behind him, who I
  understood was to be let out of prison at eleven o'clock this morning and had
  told the warder that he would have his first luncheon here. I think Louis
  knew something of him and I thought if he felt inclined to talk I might have
  got some copy."</p>

  <p>"What was his name?" Parkinson asked.</p>

  <p>"Lenwood," I answered. "Malcolm Lenwood."</p>

  <p>"Small world," the Sub-Commissioner observed, lighting another cigarette.
  "Malcolm Lenwood was the name of the fiance who used to sell stocks and
  shares on half-commission for the House in which Sir Julien had an interest.
  So you see, after all Lyson, my butting in and Louis' little scheme have not
  interfered so much with your luncheon plans, especially," my companion
  concluded, stiffening a little in his chair and depositing his cigarette in
  the ash-tray, "as the young man is walking straight into your Journalistic
  arms."</p>

  <p>For a brief space of flying moments it seemed as though the stage were set
  for drama. The young man, tall and handsome, although the complexion was
  unhealthy and expression furtive, dressed in the correct attire of the moment
  in clothes that were almost painfully new, was a likely enough actor in any
  scene of violence. The girl, who awaited his approach, had lost her listless
  manner. She was leaning a little forward, and one felt that she was vibrating
  with the pent-up desire for action. Her companion, heedless of the Nemesis
  which was closing upon him, was engrossed in the very excellent meal which
  she so far had neglected. In the background I saw Louis, who had raised
  himself in his strangely-shaped cubicle, watching intently and with a queer
  look of apprehension, the young man's fateful progress. He, like Parkinson
  and myself, seemed to have grasped the grim possibilities of the next few
  seconds...</p>

  <p>Everything of drama was, as a matter of fact, to be curiously delayed.
  That was because one frail girl was able to dominate both an agitated young
  man torn by a thousand furies, and an obstinate, conceited and cowardly
  pedagogue who, if he had known what risks he was running in those few
  seconds, would have forgotten alike his self-conscious dignity and his
  frenzied regard for appearances, and would have been pushing his way towards
  the door with his coat-tails flying behind him.</p>

  <p>The young man came to a halt. The girl, who had risen to her feet, held
  him by both hands and drew him nearer to her. I noticed the slight
  awkwardness in his acceptance of her gesture and a glint of metal under his
  coat-sleeve. As yet, however, he had not realised the sinister element in the
  situation She was whispering in his ear, talking quickly and inaudibly, and
  he was listening intently. She was making some sort of an appeal to him, to
  which he was listening in puzzled silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly expression crept into his features. He would have shrunk away,
  but she was holding him. One hand was free, the other she gripped. He forced
  himself to swing round. He recognised for the first time the man who was
  sitting at the table. Once more expression claimed him His eyes blazed with
  sudden anger. It was to be her triumph, however. Her little laugh was so
  amazing that both men seemed paralysed. The paroxysm of fear passed from Sir
  Julien's face, and the fury from the young man's. They leaned upon her words.
  She raised her voice a trifle and this time I heard what she said.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"A kind of nudism of the passions, isn't it?" she observed. "Malcolm came
  in to kill you, Sir Julien, and his gun is safely in my bag. He doesn't want
  to kill you any more. We are going to arrange things differently."</p>

  <p>Sir Julien laid down his knife and fork. I could see that his hands were
  trembling. His appetite was failing him. It was clear that he was both angry
  and terrified.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "I shall ask to be excused."</p>

  <p>"No you will not," the girl insisted. "You will keep your promise, sit
  this luncheon out and be civil to any additional guests I may ask to join
  us."</p>

  <p>"And if I don't?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall give Malcolm back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice suddenly dropped. I heard no more. Perhaps the consciousness of
  being an eavesdropper, even though there was nothing personal about the
  affair, brought its sudden quota of shame. I leaned over towards
  Parkinson.</p>

  <p>"Your wealthy baronet," I remarked, "doesn't seem to appreciate the young
  man's butting in to his party. I hadn't noticed before that the girl is
  really beautiful."</p>

  <p>"You will have a better opportunity of observing her in a minute or two,"
  my companion replied. "You heard her speak of additional guests,
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Those additional guests are to be you and I."</p>

  <p>Parkinson was right. It was barely two minutes before a ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel
  brought us a few scribbled lines on the back of a menu card. Parkinson laid
  it on the table in front of me. They were written in a woman's bold, clear
  handwriting:</p>

  <p>"I shall ask you to fulfil your promise to Louis. Come please, and bring
  your friend, Captain Lyson."</p>

  <p>I followed Parkinson's example and rose cheerfully to my feet. After all,
  it seemed to me that I might get my story. We crossed the few feet of vacant
  space and made our bow. The girl nodded to us both in friendly fashion. Jose,
  hovering in the background, pushed up chairs for us.</p>

  <p>"These are two friends of mine, Sir Julien," she said. "Mr. Parkinson"
  (she laid a certain amount of stress upon the "Mr.") "and Captain Lyson. I
  asked them to join us for coffee because I think they might help clear up
  this little affair."</p>

  <p>Sir Julien bowed stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I am pleased to welcome any friends of yours, Miss Rodney," he said, in a
  tone which reeked of displeasure, "but surely this discussion into which you
  have dragged me is a private one? Besides, I should imagine that Lenwood
  himself is scarcely in the humor to make acquaintances just now."</p>

  <p>There was an underlying sneer in Sir Julien's voice, but the girl ignored
  it.</p>

  <p>"I really don't see why not," she observed. "Mr. Lenwood will, I hope,
  soon be meeting all my friends. Mr. Parkinson and Captain Lyson, I should
  like you to know my husband. He has only been out of prison three hours,
  since when we've been married, so you must forgive him if he seems a little
  dazed."</p>

  <p>There was an instant's silence. So far as I was concerned, I could think
  of nothing to say. Sir Julien, on the other hand, seemed troubled in the
  opposite direction.</p>

  <p>"This is absurd!" he exclaimed. "Perfectly ridiculous! How can you have
  married him?"</p>

  <p>"I found the arrangements all quite easy," the girl assured him. "I had
  the certificate in my bag when I met Malcolm this morning. I had a little
  difficulty with him," she went on with a faint smile, "because he knows I
  have a great deal of money, but he is getting more reconciled. I am afraid
  that my stage management of this little meeting, too, has not been very good.
  The poor fellow hasn't had lunch yet and that is his first cocktail...Waiter,
  another Dry Martini...I insist, Malcolm. In ten minutes you will be able to
  have your lunch."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what all this fooling is about?" Sir Julien demanded
  angrily. "Why have you made me promise to sit out your wretched party? I am a
  man of my word, but there are limits."</p>

  <p>"And there are reasons, Sir Julien," the girl assured him. "Believe me, I
  am not disposed to waste many words at this function. Perhaps you will feel
  more inclined to listen patiently if I can tell you that I am in a position
  to claim, if I chose to claim it, the reward of &pound;1000 you offered for the
  return of your private diary and ledger and several other documents which
  were abstracted from your personal safe at the office&mdash;let me
  see&mdash;somewhere about four months ago."</p>

  <p>Fortunately most of the people at the adjoining tables had left, and there
  was scarcely anyone who was in a position to see that anything unusual was
  taking place among our small party. I have never seen such a change in a man
  as took place in Sir Julien. A moment or two ago his face had been scarlet
  and the veins were standing out on his temples. Now, almost with the rapidity
  of moisture vanishing from a looking-glass, the color was fading from his
  cheeks, his lips were trembling, he had the appearance of a man on the verge
  of a stroke.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about the burglary?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't call it by so harsh a word," the girl remonstrated. "Some of
  the books and documents stolen were scarcely your property, were they?
  Malcolm's account book, for instance, which contained a note of all the
  transactions authorised and initialed by you which he undertook on behalf of
  the firm...No, don't interrupt me," she went on. "The book, of course, had
  vanished when you let Malcolm down, denied any responsibility for the
  bargains he had made on your behalf, and gave evidence which sent him to
  prison.</p>

  <p>"With the rest of the business I shall not trouble these two gentlemen.
  You know it and I know it. Malcolm's story was word for word the truth. You
  made a huge mistake in entering into that rubber speculation. You saddled
  Malcolm with the result, and let him go to prison sooner than face a loss of
  a few hundred thousand pounds which you could have well afforded. You are a
  very conceited man, Sir Julien, and I think that the loss of your personal
  prestige counted for even more than the money."</p>

  <p>There was another curious little silence. The young man for the first time
  seemed aware of the cocktail which stood by his side. He raised it to his
  lips and drained the contents, smiling as he felt for the girl's fingers and
  drew her hand into his. He seemed to have recovered his manhood just as the
  man at the head of the table seemed to have become a shrunken effigy of his
  former self.</p>

  <p>"Why have you dragged these two strangers into this business?" Sir Julien
  asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"Well, for this reason," the girl explained. "I have a paper drawn up here
  for you to sign, exonerating Malcolm; confessing your grave error in having
  overlooked certain circumstances which throw a different light altogether
  upon those transactions. You will take him back into the office in his former
  position for, say, a month&mdash;he won't want to stay longer&mdash;and you
  will take the chair at the dinner which his friends will give him to
  celebrate his return and the clearance of his name."</p>

  <p>Sir Julien's eyes were fixed upon Parkinson's and there was fear stamped
  upon his face.</p>

  <p>"If I agree?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have paid several visits to Scotland Yard," the girl continued,
  "and I have also consulted a criminal lawyer. It is a matter of doubt whether
  actually the law has any hold upon you, Sir Julien, and I think the feeling
  is that if you do your best to make amends for your various mistakes, you
  will have nothing to fear in the way of prosecution." The girl paused for a
  moment and the Sub-Commissioner bowed his assent. "As regards Captain Lyson,"
  she continued, "he represents a' newspaper with the owners of which you are
  not on the best of terms and his version of this little luncheon-party would.
  I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Sir Julien called out. "I'll sign. If there's to be no trouble
  outside, I'll sign."</p>

  <p>"I appear here as a private individual altogether," Sub-Commissioner
  Parkinson intervened. "As a matter of fact, I am retiring from the Force
  almost at once. Still, I am able to tell you that as a result of a
  consultation at headquarters, it has been decided that unless strong pressure
  is brought upon us by Mr. and Mrs. Lenwood, and the various books and
  documents in the case, which as yet we have not seen, are laid before us, we
  can make no move in the matter."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes moved questioningly towards me. Something of that light of
  fierce and terrified inquiry had gone; the anxiety still lingered.</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances," I assured him, "you are safe from publicity so far
  as I am concerned, Sir Julien. I must confess that I should like to make a
  story of the whole business, but I shall follow Mr. and Mrs. Lenwood's wishes
  in the matter."</p>

  <p>Sir Julien raised the glass with which his nervous fingers had been
  fumbling so long, and drained its contents.</p>

  <p>"I'll sign," he announced as he put it down empty.</p>

  <p>The girl, who had never for one moment lost her self-possession, laid a
  half-sheet of typewritten foolscap before him and produced a fountain pen. He
  made an attempt to use his monocle, but the nervous twitchings of his face
  made it impossible. He fitted on a pair of spectacles and read.</p>

  <p>"This is awful," he groaned as he came to the end. "It will be
  published?"</p>

  <p>"It will be published," the girl assured him. "But," she added, and her
  voice was as hard as granite, "it is a very lenient punishment."</p>

  <p>"I would rather take Lenwood back on an increased salary," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Malcolm will find something better to do than work for you, or anyone
  else in the city," she told him. "I didn't hold on to my job with you because
  I needed the money. I happen to be a very rich woman."</p>

  <p>Her late employer signed. His fingers trembled, but his signature was
  clear enough. The girl blotted the document and placed it in her bag.</p>

  <p>"For three years, Sir Julien," she said, "ever since I accepted a post in
  your office, you have pestered me with invitations to lunch and dine, which
  somehow I have evaded. Now at last you have had your luncheon and I hope you
  have enjoyed it. Perhaps you will be so kind as to pay the bill."</p>

    <p class="caption">The Australian Women's Weekly, February 5, 1938, with
    "Murder at the Milan"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">REGGIE gave me rather a shock when he made his casual
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I didn't come in to see you, old chap," he observed,
  "I am dining with that charming girl, Julie."</p>

  <p>"The devil you are!" I exclaimed, genuinely startled "When did you fix
  that up?"</p>

  <p>"I saw her in the lounge last night at supper time," my younger brother
  explained straightening his tie before my mirror. "Jove! She did look pretty,
  too. We got talking and I asked her if she'd dine to-night. I was afraid she
  wouldn't&mdash;those French girls have such queer ideas about that sort of
  thing, she said 'Yes' like a shot. I'm to meet her down below in about ten
  minutes."</p>

  <p>I suppose I showed that I was a little surprised. Reggie, who was now
  engaged in mixing himself a cocktail on my sideboard, looked round.</p>

  <p>"Nothing against it, is there, Charles?" he asked. "Of course I know old
  Louis is only a ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel and that, but the girl is quite presentable
  and this is the Bohemian side of London, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You infernal young cub!" I answered indignantly. "Of course there is
  nothing against it, if she's willing."</p>

  <p>"Well, after all," Reggie went on, lighting a cigarette, "her father is
  ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel here, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He has an important position in the hotel management," I replied. "He
  could be a director any day, if he chose. Apart from that, he was well
  educated, he comes of an excellent family of its sort and his girl has been
  strictly brought up. There's no reason in the world why anyone should not
  dine with her. Louis is one of my particular friends. There is no one for
  whom I have a greater regard."</p>

  <p>"You're not sweet on the girl yourself are you, Charles?" the young man
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I happen to be nearly twenty years older than she is," I replied stiffly.
  "Besides--"</p>

  <p>The telephone-bell rang. It was Louis speaking at the other end.</p>

  <p>"I should like you to come down. Lyson," he said. "I am about to receive a
  visit which puzzles me a little, from a man who puzzles me a great deal.
  There is an affair which might develop."</p>

  <p>"I'll be down in thirty seconds." I promised him.</p>

  <p>I hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Well, you go to your dinner, old man." I told Reggie, "but remember--no
  playing about with that young woman. She wouldn't understand it anyway, and
  another thing--well. I have Just told you that her father is a great friend
  of mine--"</p>

  <p>"I say, you are not suggesting--" my brother began in an aggrieved
  tone.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" I told him rather irritably. "I know what you young men on
  leave from Sandhurst are like. You get above yourselves sometimes. You can't
  help it--that's why I have given you a word of warning...See you later."</p>

  <p>I left him there and hurried down from my seventh-floor flat in the Milan
  Court. I saw Julie sitting in a corner of the lounge looking, even to my
  prejudiced Judgment, extraordinarily pretty. She waved her hand to me, but
  made no movement when I crossed the little hall and made my way to her flat.
  As a rule she was there ready to welcome me if I paid a visit before going in
  to dinner. Louis' voice bade me enter. I found him apparently on the point of
  leaving to take up his accustomed position in the Grill Room. He looked at me
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"You were up late last night, mon capitaine?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to confess," I assured him. "I went to the ballet with my young
  brother. He joined a party of young friends here for supper and I went to
  bed. To-day I have had three games of squash with the professional, and here
  I am. As a matter of fact, I'm in the pink. What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"It is not exactly trouble," Louis replied, "but one of the most
  extraordinary men in Europe, who some years ago seemed likely to become one
  of the most famous, has arrived in London. I heard from Scotland Yard that he
  was expected. He has telephoned for a table tonight. They brought me word,
  and I replied that we were full. Since then he has telephoned again and I
  gather that he is on his way here."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Keretsky," Louis confided. "One of the mystery men of the world. Ten
  years ago, after he had been absolutely nominated dictator of Russia, he
  suddenly dropped out of life, and all that we know about him lately is that
  he has been paying frequent visits to Trotsky in Norway. The Moscow
  authorities seem to have got it into their heads that he is planning to get
  back to Russia and that he is concerned in a plot to upset the present regime
  and to occupy the post he ought to have taken years ago.</p>

  <p>"There has been very little about it in the Press, but M17B have definite
  information that an attempt was made upon his life three weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"I heard about that," I confided. "The young Russian who told me was
  terribly excited. He seems to have looked upon Keretsky as Russia's one hope
  of salvation."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand the politics of Russia," Louis remarked, "nor, I
  imagine, does anyone else, but I do know that the hotel authorities here want
  to keep out of anything in the shape of trouble, and when he applied to the
  hotel for a room there was nothing doing."</p>

  <p>"Supposing he turned 'up now. What are you going to do about it?" I asked.
  "At the present moment there are dozens of unoccupied tables."</p>

  <p>"I shall have to persuade him to go away quietly," Louis replied. "If he
  is a man of common sense he will see the importance of doing so. London just
  now is full of commercial envoys who favor the present regime, and if
  Keretsky escaped assassination--and M17B have reason to believe that he is in
  danger of that--if he were involved in any sort of a disturbance, that would
  suit them just as well. He would be deported and never heard of again."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him by sight?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Louis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have never even seen a picture of him," he replied. "I sent for you,
  Captain, because there is no harm in showing you his record presently and I
  know it will interest you even to catch a glimpse of a man who has lived such
  a life."</p>

  <p>"What if he comes in now, makes his way to an empty table, and sits down?"
  I asked.</p>

  <p>Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"He would not be allowed to remain there," he replied. "I have brought
  Jose up to the main entrance and Marco is looking after the far side."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door. In response to Louis' invitation it was
  thrown open and Jose, our giant ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel who acted as unofficial
  watchman over the place, and who had only lately been a famous Hungarian
  wrestler, made his appearance, ushering in a stranger.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman requires a table in the Grill Room for dinner, Monsieur
  Louis," he announced. "I have explained that we are full up tonight."</p>

  <p>Even Louis, the man of infinite savoir-faire, found no words for a moment.
  Neither could I do anything but stare. I thought of that long record of crime
  and fierce, lustful adventure at which a certain section of the Press had
  always hinted, and I gazed incredulously at the pale-faced little man of
  studious appearance, with bent shoulders and the ingenuous expression of a
  child, who had crossed the threshold carrying his black Homburg hat in his
  hand. His hair was silvery white; his eyes, disguised under thick spectacles,
  were still obviously blue; his legs and arms seemed to be the limbs of a
  schoolboy; his mouth the wistful, sensitive mouth of an elderly lady used to
  the gentler walks of life. Of necessity, it was he who spoke first, for
  neither Louis nor I could find words.</p>

  <p>"My name is Paul Keretsky," he announced, addressing himself to Louis. "I
  am very disappointed that there is difficulty about a small table for me. I
  have made an appointment to meet a friend here and I have long wished to find
  myself in this famous restaurant and to make the acquaintance," he added, "of
  its director."</p>

  <p>Louis' manner was more than courteous. He was almost kind.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Monsieur Keretsky," he said, "but we have a very large
  clientele here--a regular clientele who use the place as a club and come from
  day to day. With them and the guests who are staying in the hotel, whom we
  have to consider, we are always over-full."</p>

  <p>The visitor smiled a little pathetically.</p>

  <p>"I am not a very large person," he said, "neither is the guest whom I am
  expecting. We are not people of fashion, and an out-of-the-way corner would
  content us."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Keretsky," Louis explained, "in this matter I am not entirely my
  own master. We have a good many kind friends who like to take their meals
  here in peace, and who do not wish to be confronted with unusual patronage.
  The last time you entered an hotel in Warsaw, for instance--"</p>

  <p>"But I can assure you that in that case I was guiltless," the little man
  interrupted eagerly. "In Warsaw they were afraid of me because of certain
  information which had come into my possession, and the man whom I shot had
  been sent from Russia with instructions that I was to be made away with at
  the first opportunity. He missed me with his first cartridge, and naturally I
  shot him. Would you have had me submit myself to death at the hands of an
  assassin? A weakly man like me must protect himself."</p>

  <p>Louis coughed.</p>

  <p>"You will understand, Monsieur Keretsky," he said, "however much you may
  have been in the right, a visitor who is likely to have murderers upon his
  track is not a desirable visitor in any hotel or restaurant."</p>

  <p>The white-haired little old gentleman seemed almost on the point of
  bursting into tears. He restrained himself, however.</p>

  <p>"I make enemies," he complained, "because I have genius and read the
  secrets of many men without rifling despatch boxes or corrupting their
  secretaries. I know that I carry with me a great deal of dangerous knowledge.
  I make no use of it, however. If I take my own risks, is there any reason why
  I should be shut off from communion with my fellows?"</p>

  <p>"I am not your judge," Louis replied, "but I do not wish you in my Grill
  Room. You must dine elsewhere, if you please."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two our visitor seemed plunged in the depths of dejection,
  then apparently he resigned himself.</p>

  <p>"What about the companion who may arrive at any time between now and seven
  o'clock?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You can leave a message," Louis suggested. "We will tell your friend
  where to find you."</p>

  <p>"It is a lady," he confessed a little hesitatingly. "May I sit and watch
  for her in your small lounge here?"</p>

  <p>Louis seemed to consider the matter.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me your word, Monsieur Keretsky," he asked, "that you are
  not carrying any form of weapon?"</p>

  <p>Keretsky shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Louis," he said. "I do not tell falsehoods. I know that my life
  is in continual peril. I sleep with a revolver under my pillow and never move
  without it when I leave my room. It is in my hip pocket at the present
  moment."</p>

  <p>"If you like to leave it in my keeping," Louis proposed, "you may wait
  until your friend arrives, on condition that you take her away at once,
  without offering her a cocktail and without any attempt to enter the Grill
  Room."</p>

  <p>The unwanted visitor drew himself up in dignified fashion.</p>

  <p>"You are asking me to place my life in the hands of my enemies, Monsieur
  Louis," he pointed out. "I will not consent."</p>

  <p>"Then if you leave the lady's name here, she shall be told," Louis
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"The lady's name may not be mentioned," was the quiet reply.</p>

  <p>He drew a plain leather case from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"If your decision is fixed, Monsieur Louis," he said, "I will ask you to
  send one of your men to intercept the lady whose portrait is here. She will
  need only to be told that I have returned to my rooms in Number Five,
  Barrymore Gardens, Bloomsbury. She will understand."</p>

  <p>"And this little picture?" Louis asked, with the case already in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"It can be returned to her," Keretsky replied.</p>

  <p>"Your commission shall be accomplished." Louis promised.</p>

  <p>The little man made a bow to both of us--a gesture not devoid of
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good evening, gentlemen," he said and, escorted by Jose took
  his leave. Louis was a man almost without personal curiosity He passed me the
  case without opening it.</p>

  <p>"Would it amuse you to await the arrival--if she ever comes--of this
  lady?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I stretched out my hand and tool it into my keeping.</p>

  <p>"Delighted," I acquiesced. "I'll report later."</p>

  <p>I took up my position in a corner of the lounge facing the entrance,
  ordered a cocktail and, glancing round to be assured that no unattended young
  woman was about, I opened the case.</p>

  <p>I don't remember that the picture at which I glanced had any striking
  effect upon me during those first few moments. I simply visualised it as the
  portrait of a young woman of attractive appearance, with mystery in her
  face--mystery and repressed humor--and a provocative curl to her lips. Her
  hair was brushed back from her forehead and apparently arranged in plaits
  behind.</p>

  <p>I gathered that she was fair. It was obvious that she must be beautiful. I
  closed the case with a snap and glanced around. There was certainly nobody in
  the lounge who resembled in the least degree the picture of Keretsky's
  friend.</p>

  <p>My cocktail arrived. I sipped it and lit a cigarette, then I yielded to a
  sudden impulse and opened the case again. This time I studied the face more
  carefully and the longer I looked the more I was conscious of that curious
  little emotion, which must have been born at my first glance.</p>

  <p>No one could say from such a rudely executed portrait whether the girl was
  beautiful or not, but one thing was certain. She was unusual; she was
  exciting; she was full of humanity.</p>

  <p>I raised my glass to my lips with my right hand and drained its contents.
  All the time, I held the portrait in my left hand and my eyes never wandered
  from it. I don't remember whether it was seconds or minutes that I sat there
  studying it. Suddenly, I was conscious of a curious little waft of
  perfume--something that reminded me dimly of the East, of scented green tea
  and japonica lily. I realised that someone was standing before my chair. I
  sprang to my feet I was standing face to face with the original of the
  portrait.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me," she said, speaking in a very pleasant voice with
  some trace of a foreign accent, "but I find you looking at a picture which
  belongs to my uncle--a picture of me, and my uncle is not here. I feel that
  you may have perhaps some message, yes?"</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me," I begged. "I was so interested in looking at the
  picture that I forgot to look out for the original."</p>

  <p>"An excellent excuse," she murmured; "but why were you looking for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Your uncle found himself unable to dine here," I explained. "He asked
  that someone should await your arrival and tell you that he had returned to
  Number Five, Barrymore Gardens, Bloomsbury."</p>

  <p>She was clearly disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I wanted so much to sit in that Grill Room," she sighed, looking through
  the plate-glass windows. "Will you tell me, sir, please, how it comes about
  that you are the bearer of his message?"</p>

  <p>"Allow me to introduce myself," I begged. "I am Captain Lyson, retired,
  late of the Grenadier Guards, and at present of no occupation. I am a great
  friend of Louis, the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel here, and I chanced to be in his office
  when Mr. Keretsky was brought in. Louis explained that every table in the
  restaurant was taken and your uncle asked that someone should keep a look-out
  for you and deliver the message."</p>

  <p>"I do not quite understand why you were selected, though," the girl
  remarked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I volunteered. I was meaning to dine here anyhow, and to sit in the
  lounge and drink a cocktail, so it was a simple thing to do. I have been
  amply rewarded."</p>

  <p>She looked at me with a little twitch at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"Is that a truthful speech?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is the truth," I assured her. "By the by, may I not offer you a
  cocktail?"</p>

  <p>She uttered a little exclamation of relief. I drew up another chair to the
  table and she sat down.</p>

  <p>"I was hoping so much that you would take pity on me," she said smilingly.
  "I should like, if you please, a Kirsch and bitters."</p>

  <p>I ordered the concoction, and another dry Martini for myself. She seemed a
  little amused at the situation. She was entirely without any awkwardness.</p>

  <p>"This," she said, as she toyed with the small biscuits which I had
  ordered, "is very much pleasanter than turning away from that inhospitable
  door and pushing my way through the crowds back to Bloomsbury."</p>

  <p>"It is also very much more agreeable for me," I ventured, "than to have
  taken my cocktail alone."</p>

  <p>"You live here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have a very small flat on the seventh floor in the Court," I told her,
  "up in the attic almost."</p>

  <p>"Then you are very fortunate," she said slowly. "I have not been inside,
  but everyone tells me this is one of the few places in London that preserves
  an atmosphere."</p>

  <p>I thought of Louis, I thought of Jose, I thought of the directors of the
  hotel, and I didn't care a rap.</p>

  <p>"It would be possible for you to see more of it if you are really
  curious," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"How?" she asked promptly.</p>

  <p>"If you will give me the pleasure of dining with me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly I saw that she had beautiful soft hazel-green eyes--hazel which
  matched the beautiful sheen of her hair.</p>

  <p>"But you mean it?" she cried Joyfully.</p>

  <p>"I am a little shabby," she confessed, looking up at me, "is it not so? I
  have better clothes which I would have worn if I had known it was to be with
  you and not my uncle that I was to dine."</p>

  <p>I said one of those absurd things that men do say on those occasions and
  she laughed gaily into my face.</p>

  <p>"But this mighty autocrat of yours--Louis?" she asked "Will he allow me to
  enter?"</p>

  <p>I quaked inwardly, but with her eyes upon me I flouted this
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Louis would never take exception to a guest of mine." I assured her.</p>

  <p>She finished her cocktail.</p>

  <p>"Let us then explore." she proposed.</p>

  <p>I rose with well-simulated courage and led her into the room. Louis
  behaved just as I knew he would. His eyebrows were slightly raised as I
  passed his desk, and he directed one swift, searching glance at my companion.
  Afterwards, however, the customary smile of welcome lightened his face. We
  passed the rostrum and I conducted my guest to my table, placing her in the
  seat which I usually occupied, from which one had a very fair view of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"But I do think that this is marvellous," she said, in her slow,
  deliberately spoken English. "I am happy to be here, Captain Lyson. You have
  been very kind to me, a stranger."</p>

  <p>"I should like," I said with a smile, "to be a stranger no longer."</p>

  <p>She looked puzzled for a moment, then a dazzling smile broke over her
  face. No wonder she was attracting so much attention. Notwithstanding her
  clothes, and the somewhat careless arrangement of her hair, she was
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"You wish to know my name!" she exclaimed. "Indeed you shall, I am called
  Nadine and I come from the wild country of Georgia. In my own land I am
  called differently. Here I am Miss Collitzoff."</p>

  <p>She ordered dinner, and I noticed that it was Jose who made a sudden
  appearance at our table and took the order. He avoided my eye. I had an idea
  that I was in disgrace. Only a few tables away, Julie was sitting with my
  young brother. My companion ordered caviare with iced vodka, lobster cooked
  in some fashion of which I had never heard, but which Jose seemed to
  understand, and a salad of mixed fruit and vegetables.</p>

  <p>"And to drink?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Might I," she begged, "could I have just two glasses of champagne? Since
  this is to be a fete day dinner, I do as you desire. I ask for things I like
  most."</p>

  <p>"That pleases me," I assured her. I ordered a half bottle of Bollinger, a
  plain lobster, and some cold meat for myself, with a whisky and soda. Then
  she leaned back in her chair and began the serious business of gratifying her
  curiosity by looking about her. Soon I heard a little gurgling cry. Her dark
  eyebrows, so curious and yet attractive a contrast to her hair, were drawn
  together, her mouth had hardened, there was a cold, angry light in her eyes.
  She counted rapidly.</p>

  <p>"The seventh table from here under the window," she pointed out. "The dark
  man with the loose face and shining clothes. He is my uncle's enemy. It is he
  who has sworn to get him back into Russia, knowing very well that if he ever
  crosses the frontier he passes to his death."</p>

  <p>"A nasty piece of work." I observed. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"In the world he comes from there are no names," she said. "He is Number
  Nine. His task in life is only finished when my uncle leaves it."</p>

  <p>The service of dinner began and, from whatever shadowy and mysterious past
  my companion had emerged, she seemed to forget all her troubles when she
  heard the tinkle of the ice in her glass of vodka.</p>

  <p>After all, I told myself, although without conviction, I was behaving like
  an impulsive fool. I had known a moment of madness and given in to it. She
  belonged to that very different world which Louis, with excellent reasons,
  was determined should find no footing in his restaurant. I looked at the man.
  He was a gross, unpleasant brute.</p>

  <p>Dinner drew towards a close. My companion had reached the stage of
  drinking her coffee, and sipping a Kirsch liqueur. Conversation with her had
  not been easy. All the time her thoughts had seemed a little far away.
  Suddenly she turned towards me and laid her beautiful fingers upon my
  wrist.</p>

  <p>"Captain Lyson," she said. "I do thank you very sincerely for the best
  dinner I have eaten for very many years. It was so wonderful. You may think I
  am greedy?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," I insisted, "I admire your epicurean taste in eating
  and drinking. I think it is a gift to be cultivated."</p>

  <p>She smiled and she patted my wrist again almost caressingly.</p>

  <p>"You are a nice man," she said. "If I knew you more, I should like you
  very much. I think perhaps I was very careful about my dinner tonight because
  it will probably be my last. I am afraid that you will think me very
  ungrateful, because what I shall do will not please you."</p>

  <p>Her other hand had been wandering in her bag. She withdrew it with a quick
  motion, but it seemed to me that the bag had a shrunken appearance. There was
  no sort of farewell from her, simply one haunting look, the glimmer of a
  smile. She walked down the narrow carpeted avenue between the tables, and
  reached her destination before I could rise to my feet. She was standing in
  front of the stout man with the loose face and the sneering mouth almost
  before I realised that she had left me.</p>

  <p>He saw her coming, but his only movement was to shrink a little back in
  his place. He called out one monosyllable in a language I knew nothing of and
  then once, twice, there came the smothered, almost velvety report of a
  silenced revolver. A spasm seemed to pass down his frame as he fell all on
  one side.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me in those few seconds that worse things were happening, for
  I saw her deliberately turn and point the revolver to her left side. As she
  did it, however, Jose towered over her. He caught her wrist. The weapon fell
  noiselessly to the carpeted floor. Above the tumult of voices, I heard her
  reproachful cry as she realised that she was in the hands of a giant.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"That was not kind of you."</p>

  <p>It was much later that night before I saw Louis. I was tired out in body
  and mind when I returned from my evening's pilgrimage, but I went straight to
  his room. He was engaged, the little maid told me, in making out his sheet
  for the evening. Louis looked up from his task. His face was inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Louis," I said simply. "Of course I ought to have just given
  the girl the message and left. You see I didn't. Unfortunately, I invited her
  to dinner."</p>

  <p>"Would it be an impertinence," Louis inquired, "If I were to ask you
  why?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," I assured him. "I asked her because I have Very seldom
  in my life met a woman who made such an impression on me. I obeyed an
  irresistible impulse. All I can say is that I am sorry."</p>

  <p>Louis remained tantalisingly not committal.</p>

  <p>"Might I ask what has become of the young lady?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"She is in prison," I confided. "They declined to let me see he but they
  assured me that friends were already at work and her lawyer was engaged."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," Louis observed. "You are very much behind the times Captain
  Lyson. It appears that I know more than you."</p>

  <p>He took pity upon my obvious eagerness and went on:</p>

  <p>"They have found plenty of proof already that the dead man is one of the
  worst of the Russian Communist spies who ever set foot it this country. They
  have already deciphered his instructions, which were that he should not leave
  the country until he had disposed of Keretsky."</p>

  <p>"Then, if she had not shot him--?" I began eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Louis agreed. "If she had not shot him, he would have killed
  her uncle on sight. I might perhaps have been a little more frank with you,
  for I knew something of this, and it was one of the reasons why I refused to
  let Keretsky have a table."</p>

  <p>"What will happen to her, then?"</p>

  <p>I asked.</p>

  <p>"Very little--if anything," Louis replied. "She is an aristocrat with
  important connections in Paris. She will undergo a nominal imprisonment and
  be deported."</p>

  <p>The old sympathetic gleam was shining out of Louis' pleasant brown
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have not yet had an opportunity of telling you," he continued, "that if
  I had been in your position to-night I should have done precisely what you
  did."</p>

  <p>He spoke down a tube to one of his ma&icirc;tres d'h&ocirc;tel.</p>

  <p>"Two champagne cocktail at once," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"For you and me?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"To drink the health," Louis said with a smile, "of Paul Keretsky and La
  Belle incognita."</p>

    <p class="caption">The Australian Women's Weekly, February 12, 1938, with
    "Julie Joins the Force"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">IT was by the purest chance that I happened to have paid my
  monthly call at Scotland Yard and was seated with Inspector Hearnshaw when
  the red telephone upon the table nearest to his elbow suddenly tinkled.</p>

  <p>I knew Just enough about that room to understand the significance of this.
  I saw the sudden change on Hearnshaw's face. He gave me a swift glance as he
  lifted the receiver. I made for the door, but he motioned me back. What I
  heard of his terse comments and orders during the next two minutes made me an
  admirer of the man for life. He set down the receiver with a touch as soft as
  velvet, then he pressed down the last in a little row of buttons.</p>

  <p>"Number Three Service Car. Squad Number Three, all accessories. Supply
  vacancies with substitutes if anyone away. Start in ten minutes," he ordered.
  "I will give the driver directions." He nodded and I took up my hat.</p>

  <p>"I'll get off, Inspector," I told him. "There's nothing doing down our
  way. Louis sent his compliments, but we have no report to make. Another time
  will do for our gossip. A big Job?" I asked wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Two men&mdash;a wealthy stockbroker and his valet&mdash;murdered in
  Berkeley Square. A dressing case full of jewels stolen and only one man in
  the job."</p>

  <p>"And that man?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Wheadon, the swine," Hearnshaw answered with considerable heat.</p>

  <p><br>
  I had half finished changing for dinner that night when an urgent message
  arrived from Louis, the ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel who was so invaluable to Scotland
  Yard. I found him still in the sitting-room of his small flat on the ground
  floor of the Milan Court looking more worried than I had ever seen him in my
  life.</p>

  <p>"You have perhaps seen the evening papers, Captain?" he asked me.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I was going to look at one over my cocktail before dinner. I
  know about the double murder and jewel robbery, though. I was at Scotland
  Yard when the news came in over the telephone."</p>

  <p>"What time was that?"</p>

  <p>"About twelve o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Up to half an hour ago," Louis said gravely, "there had been no
  arrest."</p>

  <p>"If this man Wheadon is really responsible." I observed, "that isn't so
  very surprising. It is his thirteenth or fourteenth job and they have never
  laid a finger on him up to now."</p>

  <p>"There is much disturbance here," Louis told me. "The hotel is crammed
  full. More than half the guests are rich people. An affair like this makes
  everyone nervous. See&mdash;" He drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and
  unlocked a drawer. From it he he took a well-worn manuscript typed in large
  characters.</p>

  <p>"This is a copy of criminal messages worked out by Scotland Yard during
  the last few years," he confided. "It comes from the cipher room there. This
  clipping is from the agony column of last Monday's <i>Times</i>. It commenced
  with a text and ends: 'So loved our holiday and looking forward to
  Broadstairs!' Worked out by an expert, the message reads: 'Shall be at Milan
  Hotel from ten o'clock Wednesday night for three hours. W.'"</p>

  <p>"The fellow wouldn't dare to come here," I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Well, your friend, Inspector Hearnshaw, believes that he would dare
  anything," Louis replied. "Hearnshaw was in here not an hour ago&mdash;a
  wreck of a man. He had been on a wild drive. He was shaken to pieces and
  could scarcely speak for anger. They had had two smashes and after the last
  one, which was not far from Norbury, he swears that he actually saw Wheadon,
  driving a racing coupe, turn into a side street and dash away. The fellow
  even waved his hand before he disappeared!"</p>

  <p>"It seems a pity that he was able to give them the slip when they got so
  near to him." I remarked a little tritely.</p>

  <p>"It is more important," Louis rejoined, "to decide where he has got to.
  There is no doubt that he changed his route three or four times during the
  chase, but not one of them, with the exception of Norbury, led him to any of
  the great ports. Hearnshaw has drawn what is almost a foolproof cordon around
  the whole circle, somewhere inside of which the fellow must be. They are
  moving that cordon inch by inch towards London. If Wheadon escapes it will be
  the greatest blow the prestige of the Yard has ever suffered."</p>

  <p>"Well, it isn't exactly our show, is it?" I pointed out. "So far as we
  know the fellow has never set foot in the Milan."</p>

  <p>Louis looked at me reflectively. "I told you about the cipher message in
  'The Times'." he reminded me. "To-night is the twenty-second. Hearnshaw has a
  theory that his man was not trying to get away. He was trying to double back
  upon London."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" I muttered.</p>

  <p>"You begin to understand, yes?" Louis asked. "He really means to keep his
  appointment here at the Milan Hotel."</p>

  <p>"How are your bookings for tonight?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Three-quarters of the dinner bookings are for regular clients," Louis
  replied. "Of the others I have made a list and Scotland Yard is placing them
  so far as it can in a short time. For supper the situation is more difficult.
  As you know, people drop in here almost indiscriminately."</p>

  <p>"Has Scotland Yard any descriptions of Wheadon?" I asked.</p>

  <p>For the first time during our conversation the vestige of a smile
  flickered across Louis' face. He drummed with his fingers upon the table and
  looked at me reflectively. "There are half a dozen descriptions," he said. "I
  will read you one." He opened a small memorandum book.</p>

  <p>"'James Wheadon. Age about 36. Complexion moderate, inclined to be fair,
  generally slightly sunburnt. Heavy light brown hair, well brushed back from
  forehead, a slight curl over the ears. Height 5ft. 11in. Eyes blue. Carriage
  a little stiff as though from military training. Manners easy. Speech rather
  deliberate, voice of a good tone. Carefully dressed. Excellent hands, well
  manicured. Slightly military moustache. A few freckles.'"</p>

  <p>"Is it my fancy?" I ventured.</p>

  <p>Louis' smile deepened. "Anything strike you about his description?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they say we never see ourselves as other people see us, otherwise I
  should say that it is a very fair description of myself."</p>

  <p>"To use one of your own colloquialisms." Louis admitted, "he is the dead
  spit of you. In Paris he always uses an eyeglass, which changes him a good
  deal, but he was pointed out to me as a dangerous character on the lawn at
  Longchamps once and I have never forgotten the likeness. Then at Deauville he
  scarcely ever removed his sun spectacles, but the likeness was always
  there."</p>

  <p>I felt my chin doubtfully. "This isn't going to bring any trouble my way,
  I hope?" I observed.</p>

  <p>"I think monsieur may rest without disquietude," Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I am dining with your daughter this evening," I went on. "She
  ought to be able to identify me."</p>

  <p>"I am happy to hear that Julie will be so well occupied," Louis said a
  little drily. "Nevertheless, I trust that you have not the intention of
  leaving us to-night."</p>

  <p>"I think Julie's idea was to dance downstairs," I told him. "After what
  you have told me, though, I shall be here for supper, I promise you. Julie
  won't mind."</p>

  <p>Perhaps because I knew that among these sleekly groomed, suave looking
  people in the foyer and in the great dancing-hall below there were at least
  fifty doughty men from Scotland Yard, who carried death in their hip pockets
  and who were prepared to deal it out without hesitation if they should come
  in touch with the man they sought, the Milan seemed to me to possess an
  unreal aspect that night. Everywhere the spirit of disquiet with which I
  myself was infected seemed to have found a disturbing place among the whole
  company. Julie became a little annoyed with me.</p>

  <p>"To-night, my dear Charles," she complained, as we danced in the main
  restaurant, "you are not yourself. You make conversation. All the time' your
  eyes search the different tables."</p>

  <p>"You are a sensible girl, Julie," I said, as we reached the far end of the
  floor and were in comparative seclusion. "I don't mind telling you that it is
  true, my dear."</p>

  <p>"You have something on your mind?"</p>

  <p>"I have," I confessed. "Those people who ought to know have assured
  us&mdash;your father and me&mdash;that James Wheadon is likely to visit the
  Milan some time to-night."</p>

  <p>She drew momentarily away from me. There was horror in her face. There was
  also eagerness. "Charles, are you in earnest?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a subject to joke about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how could they suspect that?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "There is some information, of course."</p>

  <p>"But who is there to give him away?" she asked. "They say he is always
  alone."</p>

  <p>"He must dispose of the spoils somewhere," I reminded her. "He might be
  meeting a buyer here, or his message may have been one of sheer bravado."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what he is like?" she queried.</p>

  <p>"Well, according to your father, who has seen him," I replied, "he is
  rather like me. I never thought I had much of a criminal appearance, but he
  is about my height and complexion and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Julie's piquant little face was suddenly lit up with joyous mirth. She
  threw back her head and laughed. "Charles, my dear, it is absurd!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps one of the most foolish things I ever did in my life was to answer
  that measured tap on the door of my room in my suite in the Milan Hotel where
  I had gone to freshen up.</p>

  <p>A young man was standing in the dimly lit corridor, and a single glance at
  him almost took my breath away with astonishment. He gave me no time to
  recover. With a movement which was forceful but not obviously discourteous he
  pushed past me into the room, closed the door and stood facing me. Just a
  second or two too late I realised what was happening.</p>

  <p>"You have the name of being a man of common sense, Captain Lyson." he
  said. "You will show it now. You may never have an opportunity again."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Get further back into the room, keep well away from the telephone and
  bells, fold your arms and listen."</p>

  <p>I did as I was bidden. I could see where he had me covered from the little
  bulge in his overcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"I want your passport," my visitor announced crisply.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself," was my curt reply.</p>

  <p>"Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Where you are not likely to find it."</p>

  <p>His eyes flashed. Except for that one moment of ferocity even his
  expression seemed to have been patterned upon my own. The likeness had almost
  taken my breath away.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he exclaimed, "we won't waste words. You probably know who I
  am. I have had you under observation for some time. You realise that I am
  almost your exact double. I am wearing a coat from your tailor, a hat from
  your hatter, shoes from your bootmaker, my hair has been cut by your
  coiffeur.</p>

  <p>"Where is the passport?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"In a drawer of my writing desk."</p>

  <p>With two swift paces he was there. He removed the telephone and placed it
  out of reach, he cut the cord of the bell switch and threw the stand into the
  wastepaper basket. All the time the bump was pointed in my direction.</p>

  <p>"Where are your keys?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"In my pocket," I answered.</p>

  <p>He came close up to me. I took a quick step on one side and went for him.
  The bullet seemed to burn my cheek and flick my ear, but it was a bullet
  fired in vain and I felt convinced that I was the stronger man. The straight
  left, however, which should have gone crashing into his face was averted by a
  lightning-like parry. In a moment we were locked in one another's arms. I
  entered into the struggle rather fancying myself as a wrestler. It was all
  over in thirty seconds and I discovered that I knew nothing at all about that
  science. I was on my back and the snout of his vicious-looking little
  revolver was pointing straight into my face.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool, Lyson," he cried, "and a dead one unless you do exactly
  as I ask. Do show a grain of common sense, man. I am a professional killer.
  You haven't a chance against me. Throw me your keys."</p>

  <p>I did as I was told.</p>

  <p><br>
  There is a chambermaid at the Milan Hotel, Nellie Moore by name, whose
  savings bank book still contains evidence of her amazing shrewdness and
  enterprise on the night when I was left unconscious in my room. Unlike the
  valet and the waiter who, finding the door locked, had made only casual
  efforts to deliver messages to me, she insisted on seeing one of the floor
  managers with the consequence that an hour or so after I had been left by my
  double and when I was on the point of asphyxiation I opened my eyes to
  welcome the sweet rush of cold air through the wide-flung windows and felt
  life stirring once more in my pulses. I was helped into a chair and I think
  that among the tangle of questions and exclamations around me the thing which
  brought me finally back to consciousness was a remark of the waiter.</p>

  <p>"This is a queer show," I heard him say to the floor manager. "It's not
  ten minutes ago since I saw the Captain having supper with Miss Duquesne down
  in the Grill Room!"</p>

  <p>I staggered to my feet. I was a pretty haggard sight as with nervous
  fingers I strove to rearrange my tie before the looking-glass.</p>

  <p>"What's it all about, Captain Lyson?" Antonelli, the floor manager, asked
  me anxiously.</p>

  <p>"It's Wheadon," I groaned. "He wanted my passport and he's got it. Let
  Louis know, for heaven's sake. IH be down directly." Antonelli sighed as he
  moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"For the love of heaven don't let the man who is having supper with Miss
  Julie leave the Grill Room!" I cried. "He has murdered two people already
  to-day!"</p>

  <p>The floor manager was puzzled. "But, Captain Lyson," he exclaimed, "surely
  I saw you supping with Miss Julie yourself as I came through?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand, you fool," I half sobbed, half shouted, "the
  blackguard's trying to get away on the strength of his likeness to me? With
  my passport hell manage it if you idiots are not quicker!"</p>

  <p>I was weaker than I thought; for I had to be helped to the lift. My hand
  was resting on Antonelli's shoulder as I staggered to the plate-glass windows
  in the small cocktail lounge which led into the Grill Room. My table was only
  a few feet away and clearly visible. Seated at it was Julie and the man for
  whom all Scotland Yard was searching that night. Wheadon was leaning forward
  in his chair&mdash;even his attitude, the poise of his head&mdash;seemed
  fashioned on one of my own eccentricities. The signet ring upon his finger
  was mine.</p>

  <p>They were evidently on the point of departing, for he had scrawled his
  initials or rather mine&mdash;upon the bill which lay on a plate by his side.
  Julie's fingers were toying with the fastenings of her ermine cape; in her
  eyes there was a great perplexity. She seemed to be breathing quickly, to be
  listening almost as one spellbound.</p>

  <p>"Give Louis the word," I whispered to Antonelli. "He will know how to act.
  Tell him I am here. Wheadon is hemmed in by men from the Yard. They are only
  waiting for his move."</p>

  <p>I stood a little back from the window and I watched the floor manager
  approach Louis and whisper in his ear. Louis listened with a smile which
  perplexed me. The man's message seemed to have little significance for him.
  He just nodded, broke off to wish an impressive good-night to some departing
  guests and dismissed Antonelli.</p>

  <p>Julie and her escort were now on their feet. ''Tie latter leaned over with
  a smile to help her fasten her cape and with a little Jerk of the shoulders,
  which might at any time have been mine, he followed her to the door. Louis
  looked up unperturbed, smiled his adieu to Julie and nodded a friendly
  good-night to my double. I felt the perspiration breaking out on my forehead.
  If Antonelli had been disbelieved or if Louis had misunderstood him, the man
  had only a few more yards to go with Julie to be on his way towards freedom!
  They came into the lounge. I shrank back in the corner, one hand grasping the
  revolver I had snatched from the drawer just as I left my room.I shrank back
  in the corner, one hand grasping the revolver I had snatched from the drawer
  just as I left my room. Wheadon threw the cloak which was given him over his
  shoulder, gave his pourboire to the cloakroom attendant and turned to the
  valet, who was waiting to help him, with another ticket. I could hear him
  distinctly from where I stood.</p>

  <p>"I have a bag there," he said. "Will you take it out to my car? You will
  find the car just a yard or two from the entrance, a new Rolls Royce."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Captain Lyson," the man answered.</p>

  <p>He took up the morocco leather dressing case, and followed them down the
  lounge. Was everyone mad, I wondered. Then all of a sudden I drew a deep
  breath of relief. The man who was carrying the bag had never been a cloakroom
  attendant at the Milan! The two or three dark figures who were now guarding
  any possible attempt at re-entrance to the Grill Room were familiar enough,
  but they had nothing to do with the place, and each of those two doors by
  which one could pass from the little hall out into the courtyard were blocked
  now&mdash;two men standing on the threshold of each&mdash;and though as yet
  there was silence there was something portentous about the atmosphere. Julie,
  evidently according to plan, had slipped down the stairs into the ladies'
  room. She was safe. I thought with relief.</p>

  <p>Then from that other door which led to Louis' flat, two dark figures came
  out and even as realisation came to Wheadon, even as he knew that he had
  walked into a trap, they were upon him from behind. Their fingertips could
  scarcely have touched the sleeve of his coat before he made his spring. I
  think that as he jerked the revolver from his pocket he recognised me, but if
  so it was a recognition that passed like a flash of no import. He had already
  looked down the avenue leading to death, and they were carrying his body
  through the open door in a matter of seconds after the bullet from his weapon
  had ended his life.</p>

  <p>Julie was the heroine of the night, we all decided, as we sat in Louis'
  sitting-room until the small hours. Everyone agreed that it had been one of
  the most dramatic captures Scotland Yard had ever brought off. Wheadon's
  plans had been almost foolproof. The car outside would not have landed him at
  Heston but at a deserted farmhouse on the Wiltshire Downs, which was the real
  whereabouts of the plane, within an hour and a half of leaving London, and
  the plane itself was fuelled for a thousand-mile run. Julie, still at times
  shivering, was seated by my side on the divan gripping my fingers
  tightly.</p>

  <p>"At first, Charles," she confided, "it was simply uncanny. I could not
  believe that it was not you. I even felt a little thrill when he looked at me
  sometimes in just the same way as you do! Then he became serious, or perhaps
  it was a pretence, and I was frightened. It was terrible! He wanted me to go
  with him to Paris. We could be married to-morrow. All sorts of wonderful
  adventures he talked about. Then I was really afraid. I struggled on. I
  believe he thought that I was on the verge of consenting. I was to give him
  my answer in the car when we were alone When we stood up to leave the place
  and <i>mon pere</i> there just smiled and wished us good-night I nearly
  screamed! I could not have borne it for many more seconds!"</p>

  <p>"And where," I asked, still in a measure bewildered, "did you imagine I
  was all this time?"</p>

  <p>Louis smiled apologetically.</p>

  <p>"There's a certain grim humor in that, Captain Lyson," he pointed out. "I
  wrote a note begging you to go to your club and stay there until alter
  midnight. You were better out ol the way. Everything had been so elaborately
  prepared and a single slip might have ruined the whole business. That note I
  gave to Marius himself to be delivered into your hands."</p>

  <p>"I never got it."</p>

  <p>"No, but Wheadon did," Louis said grimly. "When he came in. Marius never
  hesitated. He had just been starting for the lift, but directly he saw
  Wheadon he handed the note over to him."</p>

  <p>I put my hand to my forehead My head was as yet none too clear. "But when
  Wheadon came in," I said, "Marius must have realised that he had made a
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Of course he did! Fortunately he came straight to me and I was in time to
  prevent his making a fool of himself. You can't blame the police. They knew
  they had Wheadon but they wanted the jewels, too."</p>

  <p>I looked around at the little gathering. There was Inspector Hearnshaw,
  Louis himself, Julie, clinging to my side, Parkinson, an ex-Sub Commissioner,
  and Sir Edward Rastall, the managing director of the hotel. I looked last at
  Julie and I realised the truth. "You knew all the time," I exclaimed breaking
  a somewhat strained silence.</p>

  <p>Her arms went around my neck. "You must forgive me, Charles." she
  whispered, her beautiful eyes pleading. "They persuaded me. If you had known
  it would have been so much more difficult. And just fancy&mdash;three hundred
  thousand pounds worth of jewels in that dressing case!"</p>

  <p>Louis, who had been watching my face a little anxiously, drew a breath of
  relief. He summoned his own servant from the next room. "Fill the glasses
  once more, Angelo," he ordered and turned back to his guests.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Australian Women's Weekly, March 19, 1938, with "The
    Three Strangers"</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">IT was a typical luncheon-time crowd who were swarming in
  through the portals of the Milan Court, filling the small lounge and finding
  their places in the Grill Room beyond. I paused in my conversation with Louis
  the omnipotent ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel, to watch some of his apparently endless stream
  of clients. They were of all classes, from the politician hurrying along from
  Whitehall, the man of business descending from his taxi often flushed with
  excitement of money getting, a sprinkling from the theatrical world, a much
  larger and more motley crowd from the cinemas, and the usual nondescript
  medley of foreign residents in the hotel or casual visitors. It was a
  fascinating task sometimes to put them in their places.</p>

  <p>It seemed easy to classify everybody until the three strangers pushed
  their way through the swing doors and stood within a yard of Louis' desk,
  looking around them curiously and with the air of having drifted into
  unfamiliar surroundings?</p>

  <p>There was a friendly rivalry between Louis and me as to our ability to
  classify easily the various types who found their way into the kingdom of
  this most famous ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel in London. In this case it was he who came to
  a conclusion more easily than I. He leaned forward with something more than
  his usual urbane smile. There was a touch of human kindness in his
  simply-asked question.</p>

  <p>"Can I do anything for you, sir?" he asked the eldest of the three, a
  thin, white-haired gentleman in semi-ecclesiastical garb.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, sir," was the pleasant response. "We were intending to
  take our luncheon here, but the place seems very full."</p>

  <p>"I can give you a table." Louis replied, beckoning to Jose. "Have you any
  preference as to its position?"</p>

  <p>"We should like," the girl by his side suggested timidly, "a table
  somewhere near the one usually occupied by Mr. Marketin."</p>

  <p>"Marketin?" Louis repeated, with some hesitation.</p>

  <p>"You must know him very well," the girl continued. "We read in the paper
  only last week that he lunched here nearly every day."</p>

  <p>"He is," her elderly companion ventured, "a great power in the cinema
  world."</p>

  <p>I whispered in Louis' ear.</p>

  <p>"I should let them have their own way," I suggested. "He can't bite their
  heads off."</p>

  <p>"The papers said that he lunched here nearly every day," the girl
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"That is perhaps a slight exaggeration," Louis said pleasantly. "However,
  of course I know the gentleman you mean. He usually sits at one of that group
  of tables on my left, and there is one there now laid for two, but it could
  easily accommodate three. You would like to have it?"</p>

  <p>"If you would be so kind, sir," the elderly gentleman replied with a sigh
  of relief.</p>

  <p>It was a very exceptional thing for me to interfere between Louis and his
  patrons, but I felt impelled to ask a question. The nervous old gentleman,
  the girl with her intriguing abstractions, and the handsome but bucolic
  looking youth were all unusual in their way, and I was interested.</p>

  <p>"Have you any acquaintance with Mr. Marketin, sir?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say that we have," was the somewhat hesitating reply. "My
  daughter, however, read in this article she speaks of that Mr. Marketin was
  always looking for new types for the&mdash;er&mdash;cinema plays which he
  produces. I had the idea that I might venture to introduce myself."</p>

  <p>My curiosity amounted to impertinence, but I persevered.</p>

  <p>"On account of the young lady?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no." she replied promptly. "We never dreamed of such a thing. It is
  my brother here who wishes to go on the films. Everyone in our part of the
  world thinks that he ought to."</p>

  <p>I looked at the young man who certainly had all the assurance which the
  other two lacked. He was dressed in a different fashion to them for the girl
  wore the clothes of a village dressmaker, but she could have worn a smock and
  remained a creature of grace.</p>

  <p>Her brother wore what appeared to be a ready-made suit from the emporium
  of an outfitter in a market town, clothes of sporting cut which hung
  reasonably well upon his shapely figure, but which left him lacking the air
  of distinction certainly possessed by the other two.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me if I seem inquisitive," I said, "but I was wondering how you
  proposed to approach Mr. Marketin if you haven't a letter to him."</p>

  <p>"I myself have raised that question," the elderly gentleman remarked.</p>

  <p>"Is he very terrifying?" the girl asked.</p>

  <p>I hesitated.</p>

  <p>She came out on to the platform and stood there patiently, looking
  inquiringly into my face. "What is it, please?" she asked softly.</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"I scarcely know him." I confessed, "but I believe he has the reputation
  of being a little difficult. However," I said, feeling that I had gone far
  enough, "I wish you good fortune."</p>

  <p>With a gesture of farewell I left them and went over to my table. A few
  minutes later I saw Jose usher them to their places. The elderly gentleman
  gave up his hat with reluctance to an insistent vestaire.</p>

  <p>The girl, as she sat there facing me, smoothing her gloves and looking
  about her with awed interest, was, I realised, subtly but unquestionably
  attractive. Her boyish figure lost very little of its charm in the simple
  clothes she was wearing, her almost over large eyes were full of languid
  interest, her manner as she spoke first to her father and then to the young
  man was calm, but perfectly self-possessed. It was easy to see that it was
  she by her encouragement who was setting them both at their ease. She held
  the menu in her hand as one accustomed to order luncheons, and Jose received
  her commands and ventured upon several suggestions with his best air. A
  carafe of water was placed upon the table...I finished my cocktail, ordered
  my grilled sole with a Riz Diane to follow and made my way back to Louis'
  desk.</p>

  <p>"I see your proteges have settled down." I remarked.</p>

  <p>He looked at me with that benevolent smile once more upon his face.</p>

  <p>"There is something that one might consider pathetic." he confided, "about
  that trio."</p>

  <p>"Did they tell you their names?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman's name is Spenser. He is not a clergyman as I thought but
  an ex-schoolmaster. I think that he has been persuaded to come to town by his
  daughter for the sake of her brother. They live in a village with about forty
  inhabitants on the edge of a moor in Devonshire, twenty miles from even a
  market town. The young man has a post in a bank. He has also the accent of
  the local school where he was educated. It is indeed a little pathetic."</p>

  <p>"I hope Marketin will let them down lightly," I ventured.</p>

  <p>Louis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Marketin is a man of uncertain temper," he said. "For the rest, you know
  him as well as I do. If it had been the young lady who was anxious to go upon
  the films I think I should have tried to persuade them that Mr. Marketin was
  a stranger here."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not pretend at my time of life," Louis answered with a smile, "to be
  an infallible judge, but it is my opinion that the young lady, whose name,
  by-the-by, is Lorna, is far too attractive and too unaware of the fact to be
  drifting about in these circles with a scholarly simpleton and a conceited
  lout."</p>

  <p>"What can one do?" I asked the presiding genius of the place.</p>

  <p>He answered me literally.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;nothing," he admitted. "With you it is different. You have a
  bowing acquaintance with Marketin."</p>

  <p>"No more than I can help," I muttered</p>

  <p>"Never mind&mdash;it is sufficient. You belong to the class with whom he
  is always seeking to ingratiate himself. I suggest that, out of kindness to
  those three strangers, before they have had an opportunity of making a faux
  pas, you go up to speak to him and, finding them there, present them as
  acquaintances of yours."</p>

  <p>I considered the matter without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I don't like putting myself under an obligation to Marketin," I
  objected.</p>

  <p>"You need not," was the prompt reply. "He will be only too flattered at
  your addressing him."</p>

  <p>I indulged in a little grimace, but, of course, I consented.</p>

  <p>With my promise to Louis in mind I watched Marketin curiously when he made
  his appearance. He was a short, thickly-built man, who wore heavy
  tortoiseshell rimmed glasses and had a habit of doing everything in life at
  express speed.</p>

  <p>He passed through the lounge, holding his stick and hat out to the
  vestaire, who had to follow him into the room to gain possession of them. He
  nodded to Louis and strode down between the tables to the one he generally
  occupied. Arrived there, he took off his glasses and looked around to see if
  any of his business acquaintances were in the vicinity. Apparently there was
  no one he knew, so he sat down, snatched up the menu, hit a glass with the
  edge of his knife to secure the attendance of a waiter, gave an order in
  apparently one breath, readjusted his spectacles, and propped up a paper in
  front of him. He ate the first course of his luncheon at top speed, pushed
  back his chair, and called for another dish. He disposed of that in about the
  same length of time, drew a cigar from his case and called for coffee. During
  the whole performance he had scarcely taken his eyes off the script he had
  propped up in front of the menu before him.</p>

  <p>There was something like consternation upon the faces of his three
  neighbors when he tapped upon the table and evidently snapped out a demand
  for his bill. Perhaps I should have made no movement but I caught a glimpse
  of the girl's face. A few seconds later I was on my way down the room.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Marketin," I said, pausing at his table.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Morning," he replied, regarding me doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"My name is Lyson. I have met you at some of these film shows and at Lady
  Trehsam's last week," I continued, plunging deep into the mire of
  snobbery.</p>

  <p>"Lady Tresham's? Ah&mdash;h'm. Yes, I suppose I was there. One forgets,"
  he went on rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I know you are the busiest man in London," I said. "Could you find time
  just to say how-do-you-do to three friends of mine from the country who have
  come up purposely to see you?"</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"I never talk business in a restaurant," he said. "Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"Here," I answered. "Mr. Spenser," I said, turning towards him, "this is
  the gentleman you were asking me about&mdash;Mr. Marketin. He would like to
  make your acquaintance, but he is the busiest man in town. Just shake hands
  and tell him what you want."</p>

  <p>They all three sprang to their feet and ranged themselves at the table. It
  is my conviction that he was flattered by their promptness.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spenser laid his hand upon his son's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My boy wants to go in for the films," he said.</p>

  <p>"So do a hundred and fifty thousand others," was Marketin's comment.</p>

  <p>"I am only asking for a screen test," the young man put in eagerly "Just
  one."</p>

  <p>"Friend of Captain Lyson's, eh?"</p>

  <p>I caught the pleading in the girl's eyes and I answered quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it. Write your name and address on the back of this card,"
  he went on presenting one. "Come to my office at four thirty this afternoon
  and I will send you to one of the studios. Excuse me now, please," he added,
  pocketing his change and dropping a shilling on the table.</p>

  <p>"We are so grateful," the girl said softly.</p>

  <p>Marketin was without a doubt the biggest bluffer in the profession, but he
  was not an utter fool. The sound of that soft, velvety voice, the light
  flowing out from her eyes kept him for a moment rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>"What about the young lady?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," Mr. Spenser smiled, "has no ambitions towards film
  work."</p>

  <p>"Why not? She may have gifts. You never can tell. Come with your brother,
  young lady. You shall both have screen tests."</p>

  <p>She hesitated. She glanced at her father and then at her brother, whose
  face had clouded over.</p>

  <p>"But I don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He brushed her protest away.</p>

  <p>"Both of you or neither," he snapped out. "Good morning. Good morning,
  Lyson."</p>

  <p>He was gone before anyone could speak. One almost looked to see the dust
  rise from the well-shaken carpet under his flying heels...</p>

  <p>On my way out I paused to speak to Louis.</p>

  <p>"I did a silly thing," I confessed.</p>

  <p>"Et puis alors?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I introduced them to the fellow. The young man is going to have a screen
  test."</p>

  <p>"Eh, bien?"</p>

  <p>"Marketin made it a condition that the girl went, too."</p>

  <p>Louis frowned. He glanced at the three empty places.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where they are staying in London?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not an idea," I told him.</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"What you did I was responsible for," he said. "We must hope for the
  best."</p>

  <p>I was seated at my usual luncheon table at the Milan a week or ten days
  later studying the menu when I was conscious of a whirlwind of approaching
  footsteps. A waiter was pushed impatiently away.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a word with you&mdash;at once&mdash;Captain Lyson?" the
  newcomer demanded in a harsh, unpleasant voice.</p>

  <p>I looked up in surprise and recognised Marketin. He was still wearing his
  hat and overcoat, from the pocket of which was protruding a strip of
  highly-glazed photographs, and his appearance was rendered less attractive
  than usual by reason of the perspiration which had broken out upon his
  forehead and the vicious turn of his lip.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?" I invited. "Or are you in a desperate hurry?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer me for a moment. Those spectacles were very enclosing,
  but I had an idea that the man felt ill.</p>

  <p>"Are you lunching here?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you go and remove your coat and hat," I suggested, "and
  come back and lunch here? We could talk at the same time."</p>

  <p>He looked at his overcoat. He felt his hat. It seemed as though he were
  just realising the condition in which he had presented himself. He left the
  room and when he came back he had the air of a man who had made a great
  effort. He had bathed his face and eyes and he spoke without his habitual
  cascade of words.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to have interrupted you," he said. "I sit down with you
  here&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I answered. "Have a cocktail?"</p>

  <p>"I had two outside," he confided. "I felt the need of them. I will have
  another&mdash;yes&mdash;but no more to drink with lunch. Something cold with
  a salad," he ordered, waving away the menu. "I can eat, perhaps, when I see
  the food, but I cannot order it. Captain Lyson," he went on, leaning across
  the table, "where did you find those three fiends?"</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Strange words, I know," the man muttered, "but they are strange people. I
  am a Hungarian, Captain Lyson. I am used to peculiar types&mdash;to women who
  thrill and stab and hurt, to men who laugh and are gay and play to the fool,
  and to their elders who say nothing but whom no one can break. I have never
  met anyone like those three."</p>

  <p>I was staggered at the man's appearance and speech. I thought of that
  simple little trio&mdash;the quiet, half sulky girl with her fragile air and
  voice like the ripple of a Devonshire stream, the boy with his cheap good
  looks, and the old schoolmaster with his soft, gentle manners. I came to the
  conclusion that Marketin was a little mad.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the truth," I confessed. "I know nothing about them. I
  liked their appearance. They seemed to me simple people who had come to
  London on an absurd errand and I tried to make it easier for them."</p>

  <p>"I can't get rid of them," he complained.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean you can't get rid of them?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>His lunch was brought&mdash;cold chicken and ham, I think it was. He fell
  upon it with his usual furious haste while I was watching the filleting of my
  sole. Suddenly he broke off. His knife and fork remained suspended. He could
  have used his napkin to advantage. He just talked.</p>

  <p>"You are a man of some consequence, Captain Lyson," he said. "For that
  reason I glanced at the young man. Pah! The studios of London are overcrowded
  with that type. I should have shaken my head and walked away. But the
  man&mdash;the elderly man&mdash;his fingers were on my coat sleeve and I
  turned round. The girl was looking at me. The first impression I had of her
  was that she was plain and ill-dressed, and then I saw something else. Where
  it came from I don't know. We Hungarians are supposed to have a sort of
  second sight. I tell you, Captain Lyson, I saw something in that girl's face
  which might have set multitudes swaying and rocking, which might have lifted
  the roofs of the theatres into the air! I saw it, caught it for a moment in
  those ruminating eyes as she looked at me. Of course, the effect did not
  last. I was smiling even as I Stood there, but I could not go away without
  making sure that she came to my office. That was why I agreed to make a
  screen test of the young man."</p>

  <p>He fell upon his food again, finished everything upon his plate and sat
  wrapped in gloomy silence.</p>

  <p>"I have seen nothing of them since that day," I reminded him. "Tell me
  what has happened."</p>

  <p>He caught at a waiter who was passing.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a half flask of Hungarian claret&mdash;Carlowitz," he directed.
  "Some cheese," he ordered from another waiter. "I will tell you," he went on,
  turning back to me and pushing his empty plate unceremoniously away. "They
  came&mdash;all three of them. The girl scarcely spoke, yet every time I
  raised my eyes she was looking. They call me a hard man in my office, Captain
  Lyson. Mine is a hard job. I have to behave like a wild animal sometimes. I
  gave them a card to a man who owns a studio and I sent them away in my car.
  The tests were to be sent to me as soon as they were finished. Do you know
  that since I then I have been sick with longing to hear their footsteps, the
  knock at the door, their names announced?"</p>

  <p>They brought him the wine and he drank half a glass eagerly but with more
  restraint. The frozen look had gone from his face.</p>

  <p>"I do myself good with talking," he said. "It is good that I found you
  here. Now listen. The screen tests came back. The young man? horrible! The
  girl's&mdash;look."</p>

  <p>He drew a little roll from his pocket, just ordinary sheets of
  photographer's proofs already worn a little through constant handling. I
  looked them through but even as I commenced I uttered a little
  exclamation.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the girl," I cried.</p>

  <p>"It is the girl," he assured me with a groan. "Just look at what seems to
  be shining out of those eyes," he continued, tapping on the second of the
  photographs with a forefinger which was none too clean. "Look at that
  pose&mdash;look at those curving lips. Look at the next one&mdash;look at the
  tenderness of them! She is like one of the strange flowers from that strange
  country she raves about&mdash;where she lives. And here here&mdash;further
  on. That is the woman who could send men mad with a snap of the fingers or
  beckon them to her without a movement. Elisabeth Bergner&mdash;all these
  others that we crawl about on our knees to&mdash;they do not
  belong&mdash;they have not got it! She has."</p>

  <p>The man's words sounded as though he were ranting but he was
  earnest&mdash;that was the strange part, ol it. His face was lit up like the
  face of a prophet and the longer I looked at those cheap, glazed pictures the
  more impressed I felt with the truth of those broken words of his.
  Nevertheless, it was incredible.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Marketin," I reminded him. "I saw the girl. I saw nothing like
  that."</p>

  <p>"You did," he almost cried out. "Wait," he went on, shaking his fist
  almost in my face. "Think&mdash;think hard. You saw her there. Now, you tell
  me&mdash;there was something strange about her? There was something behind
  those calm, set little features, some fire behind those placid eyes which
  came and went, some power from heaven or hell which twisted that mouth to
  tell a different story with every second. Here, if you are so blind that you
  cannot see," he concluded, "give me back those photographs."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. To tell you the truth, I hated the idea of parting with
  them.</p>

  <p>"Marketin," I said, "I realise a little what you mean, but remember this
  sort of business is all out of my life. All the same, these
  photographs&mdash;frankly, they are wonderful. I find it hard to believe that
  they are photographs of that girl and then all of a sudden I look and
  there&mdash;there is no doubt about it. Get on with your story. Tell me about
  them. What did you do when you realised?"</p>

  <p>Marketin's face was suddenly almost reverent.</p>

  <p>"I felt," he confessed, "as though I had been living in darkness and there
  was suddenly light. I saw fame and glory opening up before my eyes. It was I
  who would present her&mdash;the greatest genius of the century! I felt it was
  almost too much for me. However, I steadied down. JSent a formal note.
  Addressed it to the father. I said&mdash;would he come and bring the girl. I
  said nothing about the young man. They all three appeared. The moment they
  walked into my little office I felt the place had become what it is&mdash;a
  shabby little den, smoky, ill-ventilated, with hideous daubs upon the wall
  and common furniture. They sat down and I felt that I was transported into a
  palace. Look here, Lyson," he said. "I know I am talking like a madman. I am
  not mad. You are the first man I have been able to talk to about them. You
  must realise how I felt to understand."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I soothed him. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"I was not quite so unnerved then as I am now," he continued. "I told them
  the screen tests had arrived. I could not show them the pictures for the
  moment. The young man's, I said, were good in their way, but the film studios
  in London were full of his type of actor waiting for employment. I could
  offer him nothing definite. As regards the young lady, I told them, if she
  was content to stay here and work she could commence her salary from the end
  of the week. I offered her ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;pounds a week, any sum
  sufficient to keep her while she was taught something of the
  technique&mdash;a week or two would be ample time&mdash;otherwise I would
  give her an agreement for the first film she acted in and for three years
  afterwards. Salary would commence at twenty-five pounds a week, I told them,
  when she was acting. When I had finished they were all three sitting there
  mute. It was the young man who exploded first. I will not tell you what he
  said. He got up and was going to walk out of the office, but his sister
  clutched his arm. Their father, too, he did his best to soothe the young man.
  There was a good deal of wild and useless talking. The girl was almost dumb.
  She sat there, her hands folded in her lap, listening to her father and the
  boy and me. Then she got up and patted her brother's shoulder
  affectionately."</p>

  <p>"'This is all very absurd,' she said. 'There has been some stupid mistake,
  Clarence. I have not the slightest desire to act on the films. I should be
  perfectly hopeless.'"</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" I ventured to ask Marketin.</p>

  <p>"You will not believe me, Captain Lyson," he groaned. "All my life I have
  tried to get the best talent and the best stories cheap. I have tried to get
  them at a quarter or a half of what they were worth. That has been my life. I
  made that girl listen to me&mdash;I don't know how. I only said a few words.
  I told her that she had a gift which as yet she did not understand. She had a
  body of which she had no knowledge. She had a personality which one of the
  unknown powers of the world had given her and with which she could succeed in
  becoming, if she wished, the greatest artist of our days. She only laughed at
  me. Her father looked at me as though I were crazy. I wrote out an agreement
  and even wrote a cheque with trembling fingers for two hundred and fifty
  pounds! She had only to sign. The money was hers. She refused. The old man
  looked at me as though&mdash;as though&mdash;oh, well, that doesn't
  matter.</p>

  <p>"'We are rather wasting time,' she said at last. 'Do you really mean that
  you can do nothing for Clarence?'</p>

  <p>"'Nothing at all,' I told her savagely...</p>

  <p>"I sat in my chair and I watched them go. The walls of the room seemed to
  close in upon me. The palace had gone. I was sitting in my own filthy little
  office. The light had gone out."</p>

  <p>"And since then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I have not seen them. I have been a half-a-dozen times to the shabby
  hotel where they stay and they will not see me."</p>

  <p>He rolled up the photographs and secured them with a rubber band.</p>

  <p>"The hotel," he told me, "is called the Western Counties Hotel. It is in
  the street leading down to Paddington Station. Will you go there and see what
  you can do. Captain Lyson?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go there this afternoon," I promised him.</p>

  <p>A gleam of light was in his face as he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in my office until seven o'clock," he said as he left me.</p>

  <p>The Western Counties Hotel was a shabby, grimy-looking building, a languid
  conversion from a tall, cheaply-built dwelling-house. There was a familiar
  smell of stale cooking as I entered, oilcloth on the floor, a decrepit
  reception desk from behind which a middle-aged woman in black, with
  brass-colored hair and many Jingling ornaments, came forward to greet me with
  an ingratiating smile. Her face fell as I made my inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spenser and his son and daughter left half an hour ago," she
  announced, glancing at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Did they leave any address?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," was the indifferent reply. "They Went to the railway
  station."</p>

  <p>"Their baggage?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>She smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"There wasn't much to speak of," she said, "and what there was they
  carried. If you want to see them particular their train don't go until four.
  They're off to Devonshire or somewhere."</p>

  <p>I thanked the woman and hurried out. Arrived at Paddington I bought a
  platform ticket and hastened to where the express was standing. I saw with
  relief that there were still twenty minutes before it started. The long train
  was packed, but I found them at last the three of them&mdash;huddled together
  in a third-class carriage built for six and already full to its complement. I
  opened the door. The boy scowled at me. Mr. Spenser greeted me courteously
  but with marked surprise. The girl, looking wanner and paler than ever, just
  smiled. I think she guessed why I had come.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to your daughter for a moment?" I asked Mr. Spenser.</p>

  <p>He stood up to allow her to pass. She came out on to the platform, and
  stood there patiently, looking inquiringly into my face.</p>

  <p>"What is it, please?" she asked softly.</p>

  <p>"I think you can guess, Miss Spenser," I told her. "I have come from
  Marketin."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He wants me to stay in London and play in films. He is quite wrong,
  believe me, Captain Lyson. I have no desire for that life. I should be a
  failure. I am aching&mdash;aching in my heart&mdash;here&mdash;" she said,
  her bare hand pressed to her bosom, "to get home."</p>

  <p>"But are you sure that you understand?" I asked earnestly. "It is not only
  the money, but fame is a great thing. You could make a name. Marketin is not
  a man who makes mistakes. He is willing to sink a great deal of
  money&mdash;all he has in the world&mdash;to start you. There is no fear of
  failure. Think how different a life you would have."</p>

  <p>"How do you know what my present life is?" she asked, with that peculiar
  little smile already forming at her lips.</p>

  <p>"Only from what I have gathered," I persisted. "Your father told us
  frankly that his income was eighty pounds a year. Your brother is earning
  less than his keep. That must mean poverty for you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose we don't seem opulent," she admitted, "and yet I, at any
  rate, and I believe my father, when the work goes well with him or he has
  caught a few trout, are happy."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she went on, "I will tell you where we live. There are only four
  rooms and the cottage is terribly uncomfortable, but it is built on the side
  of what we call in Devonshire a Coombe. I go to sleep at night with the sound
  of the stream in my ears. I wake sometimes and there is a grey mist shrouding
  it and hiding us from the world. Then the sun rises and the mist fades away
  in silver and gold. And we have the most beautiful trees growing up towards
  the low-lying clouds that are so often on the moor. And when they become
  sparse, there is the heather and the yellow gorse, or in winter the grey
  skies and the booming wind. That is when I look upwards, and when I turn
  round and look the other way to where the stream is biting its way, tumbling
  and rolling towards the bottom of the Coombe, then there is the sea and its
  sound is always there. It soothes me to sleep. It wakes me in the morning.
  Just so long as I want to be awake it keeps me awake and when I want to go to
  sleep it soothes me to sleep. Then we have flowers&mdash;wild
  flowers&mdash;all around us so that we need no garden. And the scent of
  everything! Captain Lyson, did you walk into the hall of our little
  hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered.</p>

  <p>She half-closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am an ill woman," she went on, "till I get back to the scent of the
  Devon earth, until I hear the swaying of the trees and the song of the birds.
  How anyone can live up here I cannot imagine. How anyone can think here. All
  one's thoughts must be grotesque. There is nothing beautiful to see or touch.
  It may be the life for some people big cheques and theatres and beautiful
  restaurants and motor cars and houses with parks to them. That may suit some.
  It would not suit me."</p>

  <p>There was a terrible finality about her words, a queer look of shining
  happiness in her face as she talked. It was all foolishness, of course. It
  was all because I could not make her understand, but what was I to say? The
  very things which Marketin had divined in her, the things that belonged to
  another world which it seemed a miracle that he, the little half-mad
  Hungarian, should have divined, were there like an impassable barrier.</p>

  <p>"My father is like me," she murmured. "He is very happy. He is writing his
  book on cheap paper with a scratchy pen, but while he writes he is in the
  world he loves, and when he is weary he stands at the edge of the stream and
  listens to all the sounds I, too, worship and watches the birds come out and
  the fish rise and the water come tumbling down He is also content."</p>

  <p>"If you stayed," I pleaded, "you would be famous even before your first
  picture was produced. Think what you could do for your brother."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I could do nothing for him that would be for his good," she said. "If I
  bought him a salaried place&mdash;would that help him? What sort of a life
  could he have drawing money he could not earn? Your little friend, Mr.
  Marketin, told me the truth about him. It may seem terrible selfishness to
  you, Captain Lyson, but if we are truthful to ourselves we must always be
  selfish. I could not help him. I have but one life to give away, and that I
  shall hold for myself. I must."</p>

  <p>"You never think of marriage&mdash;of the larger places in life?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>She smiled and looked at me pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Why should I trouble about such possibilities when I am already happy? I
  have so many more beautiful things to look at and marvel at and enjoy than
  anything connected with myself. Good-bye, Captain Lyson. It has been nice of
  you to take all this trouble. Your little friend may be right in a way. I may
  have a gift I know nothing about. If so, I am content not to use it."</p>

  <p>I helped her back into the carriage. Her father courteously held out his
  hand and gripped mine.</p>

  <p>"If you change your mind&mdash;" I said to the girl.</p>

  <p>"You must come and see our stream some time when you take a summer holiday
  or a winter one for that matter, Captain Lyson," she interrupted quietly. "It
  never changes its mind."</p>

  <p>A thin little hand waved out ol the window. The train gathered speed,
  started smoothly on its long Journey. I went back to Louis. His face fell as
  I told him of my failure.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," he admitted "You told her everything&mdash;you
  explained?"</p>

  <p>"I said very little," I acknowledged. "It would have been of no use."</p>

  <p>"Why are you so sure?" Louis asked me curiously.</p>

  <p>"I think," I told him, "that I must have seen what Marketin saw."</p>

  <p>I telephoned to Marketin. Often afterwards I wished that instead I had
  gone to see him. An impulse, I suppose it was of pity, led me to drop him a
  line to his office that evening and invite him to luncheon on the following
  day. But Marketing days of lunching at the Milan Grill were over. The last
  edition of the evening papers paid him the tribute of a placard&mdash;</p>

  <p class="headline">WELL-KNOWN CINEMA AGENT FOUND SHOT IN HIS OFFICE.</p>

  <p>The morning papers had a sympathetic little memoir. There was nothing in
  his affairs which offered any explanation of his suicide, but then Marketin,
  after all, had some touch of genius which accounted for his queer ways. I
  wondered whether the newspapers ever found their way into that lonely corner
  of Devonshire, whether the girl herself would spare a stray thought for her
  would be prophet as she listened to the ceaseless tumbling and music and
  thunder of her beloved stream falling into the sea.</p>

  <p class="first">JULIE sometimes calls me an old maid. I admit that I have
  fixed habits as regards the greater part of my dally life.</p>

  <p>It was consequently rather a shock to me to wake up suddenly at half-past
  seven one morning and discover, towering over me by the side of the bed, a
  huge giant of a fellow with a fair beard cut rather short, very blue eyes,
  and an air of patient amiability such as I have seldom seen equalled. This
  vision held out a huge hand to me. I shook it before I realised what I was
  doing. Then I sat up in bed.</p>

  <p>"What the mischief do you want?" I asked. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>With a beatific smile he produced a card and handed it to me. Upon it was
  engraved with many flourishes:</p>

  <p>"Baron Conrad von Corberg."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want with me at this hour of the morning?" I inquired.
  "And how did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"I came in through your sitting room," he confided. "I have asked the
  valet respecting your habits, and I find that you do not rise until eight
  o'clock. That does not suit me. I have another case at eight-thirty. I am
  obliged to take you at half-post seven."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling me what you are talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you while we work," was the cheerful answer. "I looked in the
  bathroom and I discovered that you have plenty of warm towels. Will you
  kindly remove your pyjamas&mdash;see, I will assist you&mdash;and lie flat
  upon the bed? Yours is the right type of mattress, I am glad to see," he went
  on approvingly. "It has hard springs&mdash;not too much give. So," he
  demonstrated, pushing it down with his fist. "I now fetch a towel. Everything
  else&mdash;powder, the special preparation of my own that I sometimes use, I
  have ready here."</p>

  <p>"But what the mischief is all this about?" I persisted. "What do you
  propose to do to me?"</p>

  <p>He seemed a little hurt. He looked at me with wide open eyes filled with a
  gentle reproof.</p>

  <p>"Why, to massage you," he explained. "It is for that I have come."</p>

  <p>"But I never ordered you," I expostulated. "I don't want to be massaged. I
  am not going to be massaged. Who sent you here?"</p>

  <p>"No one," he admitted cheerfully, his fingers all the time occupied with
  the buttons of my night attire. "So. That is excellent. A good chest, but,
  alas, it is always so&mdash;at thirty or afterwards&mdash;and your neck, that
  needs attention. Stomach is not so bad. Still, we shall improve that."</p>

  <p>He was at it before I could remonstrate further. I lay still for a few
  momenta and felt his hands travelling over me with what I realised to be the
  inspired touch of the trained masseur.</p>

  <p>"You see, it is good, that&mdash;yes?" he asked with the eagerness of a
  child. "Soon you will never be able to rise without your morning massage. You
  will respond, too. You have an excellent frame, Captain Lyson. You are just a
  little short of exercise, otherwise I should say in perfect condition."</p>

  <p>Since it seemed that Fate had ordained that I was to be massaged, I left
  off arguments and allowed him to proceed. At three minutes to eight he
  finished, pulled the bedclothes up to my neck, took the tea tray from my
  astonished valet and placed it by the side of the bed.</p>

  <p>"You would like me to make your tea for you&mdash;yes? Sugar&mdash;cream?
  Afterwards you will rest for ten minutes, then you take your bath as
  usual."</p>

  <p>He disappeared into the bathroom.</p>

  <p>"You excuse?" he called out, as I heard the toilet basin being filled. "I
  wash my hands&mdash;so. You are a good subject, Captain Lyson."</p>

  <p>He came back to me, his face beaming. He put on his coat and came to my
  bedside.</p>

  <p>"Four days a week I shall wish to come," he announced. "Which four days
  would you prefer?"</p>

  <p>"What I should like to arrive at is, who told you to come at all?" I
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"But no one," he explained. "How could you know whether you wanted massage
  or not until you tried? Most of my patients I get in this way. I mark them
  down myself as likely. Sometimes I find their names in the list of members of
  a well-known club, sometimes I come across them at the restaurants, more
  often than anything I visit the actors and the cinema-men and those who have
  to study their appearance greatly."</p>

  <p>And how did you arrive at my name?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It came with others," he replied. "I do not remember."</p>

  <p>"Do you find that everyone submits as meekly as I do?"</p>

  <p>"I seldom have any trouble," was the well-satisfied reply. "Sometimes I
  find that a man may take months and months making up his mind to embark upon
  a course of massage, although he knows all the time that it would be good for
  him. That is what first gave me the Idea. I choose my clients. I find out
  their habits. I appear. You are a client of mine now. I come to-morrow
  morning or Thursday&mdash;which?"</p>

  <p>"What do I pay for all this?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For the massage that you have received, my dear sir," was the prompt
  reply, "nothing. Nothing at all. It is my gift&mdash;my introduction to you.
  Henceforth the fee will be one guinea, and if you wish my services oftener
  than four times a week there might be some reduction allowed."</p>

  <p>"You mean that the massage I have just received&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He smiled a broad, happy smile.</p>

  <p>"It is a gift," he repeated. "It is my own idea. No one else has built up
  a connection as I am building it up in just the same manner. I shall be here
  on Thursday at the same time, and I am sure that I shall find you happy to
  receive me."</p>

  <p>He picked up a small bug and a rather well-worn black felt hat. Then he
  walked happily away</p>

  <p>On the morning of my impromptu massage I motored a friend down to Woking,
  where we had a pleasant round of golf, and returned to my small flat in the
  Milan Court just before one. Before going to my table, I paused to talk for a
  few minutes to Louis, who was seated at the desk from which he superintended
  the destinies of the famous restaurant.</p>

  <p>"Louis," I inquired, "do you notice anything special about my appearance
  this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing very special, Captain," he replied "You are looking very
  fit."</p>

  <p>"It's going to cost me a guinea a morning to look as fit as this all the
  time," I confided. "Do you know that a ruffian whom I had never seen before
  barged his way into my rooms this morning, insisted upon massaging me, and
  went away without charging me a penny? I gathered, however, that he has
  adopted me as a regular patient at a guinea a time!"</p>

  <p>"It appears to me a little unusual that he should come without any
  arrangement," Louis observed.</p>

  <p>"He is a very unusual person," I declared. "Here's his card," I went on,
  laying it upon the desk before him. "Where, may I ask, is Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"In the flat I believe," Louis replied, "Go in and have a cocktail with
  her, Captain Lyson. She will be delighted."</p>

  <p>"I certainly will," I agreed.</p>

  <p>I knocked at the door of Louis' little flat, which was only a few yards
  away from the entrance to the Grill Room.</p>

  <p>Julie herself admitted me.</p>

  <p>"Dear man!" she exclaimed. "Do tell me that you have come to ask me to
  lunch."</p>

  <p>"Nothing was farther from my thoughts," I assured her.</p>

  <p>Her face fell.</p>

  <p>"<i>M&eacute;chant</i>! And I am so <i>triste</i> to-day. Madame Gandin has gone
  back to Paris."</p>

  <p>"Of course I came to beg you to lunch with me," I said. "Julie, look at
  me, please. Well? Anything special?"</p>

  <p>"You look very well, and I like your tie."</p>

  <p>I told her of my morning's adventure. She laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"I think it is delicious," she said. "Fancy that great strong man standing
  over your bed, holding you down whilst he pummelled and rubbed you!"</p>

  <p>"It sounds exaggerated," I admitted, "but it isn't. If he hadn't looked so
  frightfully good-natured, and so pleased with himself, I should have wriggled
  away somehow. As it was, I just lay there like a lamb."</p>

  <p>We drank our cocktails and indulged in a little gossip&mdash;Julie was a
  great friend of mine&mdash;and presently strolled out to my table. Louis,
  leaning over his desk, detained me as we passed. He was still holding in his
  hand the card I had given him.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Captain," he begged. "This name&mdash;it sounds somehow
  familiar to me. Corberg. A foreigner, I imagine."</p>

  <p>"Scandinavian, I should think," I told him. "Most of the good masseurs
  are."</p>

  <p>"Is he coming again?"</p>

  <p>"Thursday morning."</p>

  <p>"There would be no harm," Louis suggested, lowering his voice, "If you
  asked him a few questions as to why he singled you out as a likely
  patient."</p>

  <p>"I certainly will," I promised. "It's something I don't understand
  myself."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>So on Thursday morning, at three minutes to half-past seven, when I heard
  a gentle knock at my door, I made up my mind to solve the mystery of the
  Baron von Corberg's unsolicited attentions. The question which was already
  framed upon my lips, however, was never asked. There was the Baron von
  Corberg right enough, with that delightful smile upon his lips, and just
  behind, looking into the room with an air of amused curiosity, stood the most
  beautiful feminine replica of the man it was possible to conceive.</p>

  <p>The Baron introduced as proudly. "I take a liberty, Captain Lyson," he
  said. "I present you to my sister&mdash;Greta von Corberg. Sometimes I bring
  my sister with me on my rounds."</p>

  <p>I drew the bedclothes a little tighter around me and sat upright.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;charmed, of course," I rejoined. "But really&mdash;I
  must apologise, Miss von Corberg. I may have the pleasure, perhaps, of seeing
  you later on."</p>

  <p>If she noticed my embarrassment, she completely ignored the irritation
  which accompanied it. She came over to the bedside and held out her hand. Her
  smile was completely and utterly disarming.</p>

  <p>"I am very happy to meet you, Captain Lyson," she said. "I like to know my
  brother's clients, then we can talk about them later in the day, when he has
  finished his rounds. You excuse that I come into your bedroom? We are not so
  strict, perhaps, in those ways as you are in England."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not exactly usual, you know," I ventured.</p>

  <p>"I wait, if you permit, in your salon. It is a liberty, perhaps, that I
  have taken?" she asked, looking at me anxiously. "I am so sorry."</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," I assured her. "Delighted to see you. In fact, I
  should have been disappointed if you hadn't come in. Will you make yourself
  comfortable in my sitting-room?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she replied. "It is very kind of you. I will be quite quiet,
  and not disturb anyone."</p>

  <p>"You will find the morning papers there," I told her. "Come along, von
  Corberg," I added as he appeared from the bathroom, "We must not keep your
  sister waiting too long."</p>

  <p>"My sister would not wish that I should hurry," he assured me. "I thought
  it might give you pleasure to see her, Captain. Might I," he went on, hanging
  up his coat and turning up his cuffs, "take one further slight liberty?"</p>

  <p>His expression was that of a wistful, shaggy-haired dog.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"She is hungry, my sister," he confided. "She has magnificent health, but
  just now she is failing a little. There was some difficulty about our coffee.
  Excuse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do ask her to ring the bell and order anything she wishes from the
  waiter," I interrupted. "And get to work now, there's a good fellow."</p>

  <p>He was across the room in three strides and, opening the door, he spoke a
  single sentence to the girl in a language which was strange to me. Then he
  returned eagerly to his task. No more smiles. No conversation. Very soon my
  whole body was in a glow.</p>

  <p>"A beautiful response," he declared. "Your body reacts marvellously. You
  play the game of golf&mdash;yes? When I have done with your arms, they will
  be like elastic. You will drive the little white ball farther than anyone has
  ever driven it before. So."</p>

  <p>He recommenced. Once he paused for a moment and held his head on one side
  as though to listen. We heard the clatter of china in the next room.</p>

  <p>"My little Greta," he murmured, "she has her breakfast. That is good."</p>

  <p>"Does she do anything?" I asked. "Any professional work?"</p>

  <p>He looked shocked.</p>

  <p>"My sister," he said. "No. She is of a noble family, you understand,
  Captain Lyson. She could not possibly mix with the people of the studios.
  Sometimes, when things go not so well, I have wished that there was some way
  that she could honorably earn a little money for her frocks. I do not mind
  wearing old clothes myself, but a girl so beautiful as my sister should not
  be shabby. She herself, however, does not mind. Some of her things," he
  continued, his tone becoming one of reverent admiration, "she makes
  herself."</p>

  <p>I had a reply ready for him, but it was just at that moment that he chose
  to make a vigorous and, so far as I could see, wholly unprovoked attack upon
  my stomach and for a few minutes I was speechless. When I recovered the gift
  of speech, it was to find the young lady leaning through the doorway. She
  waved her hand to me.</p>

  <p>"I wish good-bye," she said with an enchanting smile. "Such coffee I have
  not tasted for a long time. I thank you for my breakfast, Captain Lyson. My
  life is saved! I make a promenade in the park till I meet my brother."</p>

  <p>"You can have him when you like," I gasped. "I've had enough."</p>

  <p>She laughed deliciously, waved her hand once more and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Your sister," I remarked, as soon as I had recovered my breath, "is
  extraordinarily good-looking."</p>

  <p>"All our family," he confided gravely, "are the same. Good looks,
  however," he added with a sigh, "are not always a blessing."</p>

  <p>"In your sister's case, so far as you are concerned," I observed, "I
  should think they are a great responsibility."</p>

  <p>He made no immediate reply. When he had finished with me, however, he
  pocketed the guinea I had left by my bedside with a low bow. Then he made an
  observation which for the moment puzzled me.</p>

  <p>"When I have saved enough money," he said, "I shall send my sister back to
  her own country and arrange for her marriage. Until then, I keep her so far
  as possible by my side. It is for that reason that I thank you for your
  hospitality of this morning."</p>

  <p>"Bring her whenever you like," I invited as he put on his coat. "She can
  always wait for you in the sitting-room."</p>

  <p>"It Is a great kindness," he assured me. "I shall take more care than ever
  of your health. Until Monday, then."</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>I took my bath, shaved and made my toilet. When I reached the
  sitting-room, I smiled at the state of the young lady's breakfast tray. Both
  rolls had disappeared, also every scrap of the butter, and the coffee-pot was
  empty. I rang the bell for my own breakfast and turned to my letters.
  Half-way down the pile I came upon an oblong envelope on the back of which
  was the very familiar O.H.M.S. seal.</p>

  <p>I was about to open the envelope, in fact, I had already inserted the
  point of my knife, when I stopped short. I carried the envelope to the
  window, adjusted my glass firmly, and stared at the seal. I felt it
  delicately with my finger. It was unusually soft and there was a suspicion of
  warmth. I examined the letter next in the pile beneath. There was a tiny spot
  of red wax, not bigger than the head of a pin, which seemed to have dropped
  on to the envelope.</p>

  <p>From the first, I had been conscious of a lingering reminder of the
  perfume which I had noticed when the beautiful Greta stooped over my bed. I
  sniffed vigorously round the place where the letters stood. There was no
  doubt about it. Notwithstanding the more exotic perfume, there was still a
  faint suggestion of the smell of sealing-wax. I examined the ashtray. A match
  had been lit, the remains of which were still visible. There was also,
  somewhat to my disappointment, a cigarette-stump which might have accounted
  for its presence.</p>

  <p>"Put my tray down on a chair," I told the waiter. "Don't disturb the other
  table for a moment. You can come in and fetch the tray when I ring."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed orders without any sign of surprise. My hand was straying
  towards the telephone-receiver, and he knew that I often had private
  messages. As soon as he had gone, however, I bolted the door and made a brief
  search in the vicinity of the table where the letters had been. There were
  distinct spots of sealing-wax upon the floor in several places. I had no
  longer any doubt that my private communication from M17B had been opened and
  sealed up again.</p>

  <p>I paid a visit to my friend Louis that morning, Louis the patron saint of
  the Grill Room, and my confederate in many adventures.</p>

  <p>I said nothing of my mission until our morning cocktail was gleaming in
  our glasses and the waiter had disappeared. Even then, I examined the three
  doorways which led out of the room&mdash;the one into the lounge, the one
  into Louis' bedroom and the one into Julie's quarters. He watched me, amused
  but perplexed.</p>

  <p>"We are perhaps back in the old days when your Englishman wrote that great
  play 'Diplomacy'," he suggested. "Listeners at every keyhole, the perfume of
  a lady's handkerchief in a rifled drawer, deciding the fate of a whole
  continent!"</p>

  <p>"Louis." I replied, "you are very much nearer the mark than you imagine. I
  begin to realise that the game is still played&mdash;on the Continent at any
  rate, if not so much over here. I have to-day been asked by a masseur to
  allow his sister to wait for him in my sitting-room, and the little cat
  opened one of my private letters and sealed it up again with a false
  stamp!"</p>

  <p>"This is a serious business of which you speak," Louis said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Not so serious as it might have been," I told him. "The letter which the
  young lady opened was from M17B, and it contained the information that within
  three days there would arrive a record of important changes in the cipher
  code between ourselves and Seventy-seven Quay d'Orsay."</p>

  <p>"The information was given to you in cipher, the old cipher, I
  presume?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. But you know how simple it is, Louis. Anyone who had once
  mastered it could at any rate blunder through the message."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Inform the Chief, of course," I said, "Afterwards I shall toy with the
  matter."</p>

  <p>Louis glanced at me keenly.</p>

  <p>"This sister of the Baron's?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Take note that I do not say the most attractive," I replied, "but she is
  without a doubt the most beautiful woman I ever saw in my life. The Baron
  confided to me as he punched my ribs this morning that to walk with her in
  the streets was an annoyance. People stopped upon the pavements and
  stared."</p>

  <p>Louis looked thoughtfully for a minute at the point of his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You know, my dear Captain Lyson," he said, "how great is the confidence I
  repose in you, but I ask myself whether it is as well for you to take this
  matter so lightly."</p>

  <p>"Louis," I explained, "to put it frankly, we do not get much out of our
  job. It is ill-paid, at times hopelessly dull, now and then highly dangerous.
  An odd thrill comes as a surprise. We generally have to be content with
  sending in reports and letting other people finish the job. I have a fancy
  that I would like to see the denouement of this one."</p>

  <p>"The Department does not like it," Louis reminded me uneasily.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Monday morning at a few minutes before seven-thirty found me with a
  dressing-gown over my pyjamas, turning over the recently arrived letters in
  my sitting-room. I turned my head at the soft knocking on the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," I invited.</p>

  <p>The Baron and his sister entered. She gave a little start as she saw me
  sitting there, and it seemed to me that her eyes went swiftly towards the
  pile of letters in front of me. The Baron appeared disturbed.</p>

  <p>For the beneficial application of the massage, Captain Lyson," he warned
  me, "it is inadvisable to occupy the brain or body first. You permit me to
  suggest that you preserve the rest of your correspondence."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," I told him, "I cannot do that. I have a communication of
  some importance to study here," I went on, tapping a long envelope. "I shall
  ask you to postpone my massage until to-morrow morning. As I did not let you
  know&mdash;I searched for your address, but it was not upon the
  card&mdash;you will allow me to pay."</p>

  <p>I pushed a pound note and a shilling towards him, but he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"That I could not accept," he said. "Permit me to come when you change for
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"At half-past seven, then," I said. "You will excuse me now, please. As
  you see, I am occupied."</p>

  <p>They both turned reluctantly away. The girl looked over her shoulder from
  the door. I waved my hand.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mademoiselle," I said. "Sorry to hurry you away."</p>

  <p>The changed cipher was among my correspondence and I realised at once its
  importance. It was unlikely that I, personally, should be affected, but, as I
  had learnt on the previous day, communications were passing every hour
  between the Quay d'Orsay and Whitehall concerning important affairs in
  Europe. I locked the papers away in my safe, which I had had removed during
  the previous day into my bedroom, and made my toilet.</p>

  <p>During the morning I went round to Whitehall, and I ascertained that
  nothing was transpiring which would involve any communications with me. From
  another branch which I also visited I failed to obtain the slightest,
  information concerning the Baron or his sister.</p>

  <p>"New to the business, I should think," Louis remarked, when I talked to
  him after lunch. "All the same, if you are sure about the tampering with your
  official letter, I should report the incident to headquarters and tell your
  masseur that his ministrations do not suit your health. It is always a
  dangerous game to play," he went on, "to try to deal with these affairs
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Right, as usual," I acknowledged. Perhaps I was wrong not to have told
  him that I was expecting the Baron von Corberg at seven-thirty.</p>

  <p>Within a few moments of half past seven there came a soft tap at the door.
  In response to my invitation it was slowly opened and Greta von Corberg
  entered. I rose to my feet, finding it a difficult matter to conceal my
  admiration. Her white evening frock was shabby, but seductively fashioned,
  and her wealth of golden hair was naturally and gracefully arranged.</p>

  <p>"Where is your brother?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He is not coming."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you here?"</p>

  <p>8he closed the door behind her and approached the desk before which I had
  been seated.</p>

  <p>"I am in trouble," she confided. "I have left my brother."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"He has been very unkind," she told me, her beautiful eyes seeking eagerly
  for mine. "He says that I bungle, that I am fit for nothing. He is very
  angry."</p>

  <p>"Because you left drops of sealing wax all over the place?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She stared, momentarily.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by drops of sealing-wax?"</p>

  <p>"When you went through my letters the other morning you removed the seal
  of one envelope and replaced it," I told her. "You were not very
  careful."</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands together.</p>

  <p>"It is all new to me," she said. "I did what I was told. I was clumsy. Now
  Conrad has sent me away."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I have come to you," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You must take care of me. I will work for you&mdash;anyhow you like. I
  will go on with this stupid spy business if you wish, or I would rather do
  your letters and type them."</p>

  <p>The allurement of her soft voice with its slight foreign accent, the eager
  pleading of her eyes, were almost Irresistible.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," I acknowledged. "I don't keep a seminary for young girls, you
  know."</p>

  <p>She came nearer, and for the life of me I could not have moved. Her arms
  went, suddenly round my neck.</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was strong&mdash;strong as a young lioness&mdash;but I too have
  muscles. Soon I was holding her wrists firmly. She looked at me
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"You are hurting," she pleaded. "Please let me go."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. She waited eagerly for my words. I was listening,
  however, to an unusual sound in the next room. Perhaps she heard it too, for
  she threw herself suddenly into my arms.</p>

  <p>"Do not shake your head at me," she begged. "It is not kind that you do
  that. I am very unhappy. You must be my friend, please, or I do not know what
  will become of me. Please&mdash;please&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I disengaged myself as gently as possible, and took a step towards my
  bedroom door.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" the called out. "You must not leave me."</p>

  <p>"I think," I told her, "that it is almost time I went to see how your
  brother is getting on in the next room."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" she cried passionately. "I will not be left here alone!"</p>

  <p>I opened the door and directly I saw what was happening in the bedroom I
  closed and locked it behind me. The Baron was kneeling before my safe with a
  huge bunch of keys in his hand.</p>

  <p>"No luck, Baron," I remarked pleasantly. "It's a devil of a lock."</p>

  <p>He was scared, but he disposed of the keys somewhere in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I come to give you your massage," he said as he rose.</p>

  <p>I rang the bell. There was the sound of a key in the lock almost
  instantly. Inspector Hearnshaw stood upon the threshold. I beckoned him into
  the room. The Baron stared at him in horror.</p>

  <p>"You give me in charge?" he exclaimed in a hurt tone</p>

  <p>"Nothing so old-fashioned," I assured him. "Half an hour at the Passport
  Office, perhaps, a quick train to Southampton and a little voyage back to
  where you came from, you know, Baron. That's the idea. You will find
  Mademoiselle in the next room, Hearnshaw."</p>

  <p>Hearnshaw was back again in a moment, looking a little perturbed</p>

  <p>"The young lady has fainted," he announced. "Better ring for a
  chambermaid."</p>

  <p>The Baron and I hurried in. Greta was stretched across my couch, her arms
  hanging limply down, her dress disarranged. Her cheeks were ghastly pale.</p>

  <p>"Do not be alarmed, Captain Lyson," the Baron enjoined. "That is the best
  thing that Greta does," he went on.</p>

  <p>"Greta, my dear, I fear this gentleman would not leave you here, even if
  Captain Lyson permitted it. We are to be deported."</p>

  <p>To my amazement, she stood up. She resembled a beautiful, sulky child.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to be deported," she protested. "I will do no harm
  here."</p>

  <p>The Baron shook his head sadly. "The gentleman from Scotland Yard would
  not permit it," he told her. "You have been a foolish girl. We return
  home."</p>

  <p>I pointed to the door, which Hearnshaw was holding open.</p>

  <p>"You must go," I said firmly, "and you too, Baron. If you take my advice,
  you will stick to massage."</p>

  <p>He thrust another card into my hand.</p>

  <p>"If you are ever abroad," he murmured.</p><br>

  <p class="first">FANSHAW of the "Home Notes Department," as it was jocularly
  called at headquarters, bustled into the room where I was passing the time
  talking to Inspector Hearnshaw.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Lyson," he greeted me. "Is this your note?"</p>

  <p>He held it out to me--a crisp, though slightly crumpled, banknote for one
  thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"Well, I wouldn't like to go as far as that," I said, perhaps a little
  wistfully, "but I brought it here. Hearnshaw knows exactly how I came into
  possession of it."</p>

  <p>"It's a damned queer story," the Inspector admitted.</p>

  <p>"What about the note?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely genuine," was the decision. "Paper, ink, every mortal thing
  O.K. That's a Bank of England note for one thousand pounds, and I don't mind
  telling you that I shouldn't at all mind having the spending of it myself.
  Catch hold."</p>

  <p>He handed the note over to me. I folded it and placed it in my
  pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"What does one do now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Hearnshaw looked dubious.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me anything you did would be risky," he remarked. "I should
  say--spend it quickly, but you might be called upon to refund it!"</p>

  <p>"Tell us exactly how you came into possession of it," Fanshaw suggested,
  passing his cigarette case.</p>

  <p>"Simple as ABC," I answered. "I always sit at the same table for luncheon
  and very often for dinner at the Milan Grill Room. I walked in for luncheon
  the day before yesterday. In due course I shook out my napkin and this was
  coiled up inside it. Of course, I thought it was a joke but as no one could
  see any indications of the note being a false one I brought it round to your
  department here. Now you have just told me it's good."</p>

  <p>"Anyone owe you a thousand pounds likely to return it in that peculiar
  manner?" Hearnshaw asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul in the world," I told him.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you ask my advice," he decided, "I should stroll into your bank,
  fill in a credit slip and pay it in. They will give it another test, you may
  be sure. If they credit it--well, then you had better sit back and see if
  anything happens."</p>

  <p>I picked up my hat and gloves, made my adieux and drove my small coup&eacute;
  round to the West End branch of a famous bank. The cashier welcomed me
  courteously and accepted the note I passed across.</p>

  <p>"Will you credit my account with that, Mr. Ashe?" I asked him, filling in
  a credit slip.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Captain Lyson. A one-thousand-pound note. Not too many of them
  going about."</p>

  <p>"You had better make certain it's O.K.," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"It looks all right," the cashier remarked. "I'll just let our expert have
  a glance at it if you have any doubt yourself."</p>

  <p>I waited for only a few moments. The man came back smiling.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly all right," he observed. "Bring us as many more as you can of
  them, sir. Anything else we can do for you?"</p>

  <p>I cashed a small cheque and called round at the club where I played a
  rubber or two of bridge. It was about seven o'clock when I arrived at the
  Milan Court, knocked at the door of Louis' small suite on the ground floor
  and was promptly bidden to enter. Louis, the beneficent manager of the Grill
  Room, leaning upon his stick, was watching Julie, his daughter, manipulating
  a cocktail shaker. She turned eagerly towards me as I entered.</p>

  <p>"The note?" she exclaimed. "Was it really genuine?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," I told her. Julie clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"That means roses for me--or chocolates perhaps," she laughed. "A thousand
  pounds! But it is a fortune!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but where did it come from?" I asked. "No one that I know of owes me
  a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Never mind where it comes from," Julie protested. "Where is it going to?
  What are you going to do with it? There are many ways," she went on, looking
  at me with an ingenuous smile, "in which a young man, already wealthy, might
  spend generously an offering like that which has dropped from the skies. In
  my opinion the deserving poor of to-day are to be found amongst the class of
  young women whose fathers' ideas of a dress allowance are a little cramped,
  and whose one ambition in life is always to give pleasure to the young men
  who take her out."</p>

  <p>Louis held out his glass for replenishment. He was looking more than a
  little worried.</p>

  <p>"One must remember," he said, "that thousand-pound notes do not drop from
  the sky like this without bringing a message. If I were you, Captain, I
  should pay that money into the bank and sit upon it. You will probably have
  to return it to its owner before long."</p>

  <p>"I shan't part with it too easily," I remarked, following Louis' example.
  "Two can play at a game like this."</p>

  <p>Julie's large eyes flashed at me in joyous expectation.</p>

  <p>"To-night," she reminded me, "you have asked me to dine with you. Is it
  not so?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," I answered. "We are going to dine in the Grill Room, go on to
  the ballet and dance down in the restaurant for an hour or so
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Such happiness!" she murmured. "Tell me, my cavalier, what shall I
  wear?"</p>

  <p>"White," I replied promptly. "All colours become you but you are ravishing
  in white."</p>

  <p>"I have worn my white gown with you twice," she meditated. "It has brought
  me no particular success."</p>

  <p>"To-night," I told her, "I am in a susceptible frame of mind and there is
  that thousand-pound note lying at the bank, consequently I am possessed of an
  extraordinary sense of opulence!"</p>

  <p>"I shall be ready at a quarter to eight," she promised.</p>

  <p>I turned and spoke to Louis for a moment a little more seriously.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever known anything like this happen before?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Never," he assured me.</p>

  <p>"Is there any reasonable explanation which occurs to you?"</p>

  <p>I fancied that there was the slightest possible hesitation about his
  manner. Nevertheless, his reply was decisive.</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p><br>
  Julie was waiting for me in the lounge when I descended and made a little
  curtsey in response to my glance of admiration.</p>

  <p>"How I shall survive the evening I don't know," I confessed.</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't," she answered. "I am tired of being an old maid."</p>

  <p>We made our way into the Grill Room, exchanged a word with Louis, who I
  thought had rather a preoccupied air, and approached my table. It was laid
  for two and in the napkin in front of my chair was a very beautiful dark
  crimson carnation.</p>

  <p><i>"Tiens!"</i> Julie exclaimed. "The money ceases and flowers arrive.
  Look quickly, Charles. There is perhaps a <i>billet doux</i> with it."</p>

  <p>There was no <i>billet doux</i> there nor any written message of any kind
  but wrapped around the stem of the carnation was another crumpled but
  obviously veritable thousand-pound note! I must confess that I felt a little
  helpless. The second anonymous thousand-pound note within twenty-four hours!
  I turned towards my companion. She seemed dazed but was promptly helpful.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" I asked her.</p>

  <p>"We break our rule and order a second cocktail while we consider the
  matter," she suggested.</p>

  <p>I obeyed and the cocktails duly arrived.</p>

  <p>"And now?"</p>

  <p>She folded the note carefully in four.</p>

  <p>"You place that in your pocketbook," she directed. "And lean over,
  please."</p>

  <p>She picked up the carnation and arranged it carefully in my buttonhole. We
  toyed with our cocktails whilst we waited for our first course. Julie lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"The next step, please?" I enquired. "No banks open, you know."</p>

  <p>"We drink these cocktails to the welfare of your heavenly benefactor," she
  declared, "and after that we ask the advice of my wise parent. Until then we
  do not speak again of these miracles."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," I agreed. . . .</p>

  <p><br>
  As soon as we had finished our meal and I had signed the bill we made our way
  towards Louis' desk. I noticed that all the time during our approach his eyes
  were fixed upon the carnation in my buttonhole. It may have been my fancy but
  he certainly seemed to me to be looking more than ever disturbed.</p>

  <p>"You found that in your place?" he asked, indicating my adornment.</p>

  <p>"I did," I answered, "and there was not a single one of the waiters who
  either put it there himself or saw anyone else do it. And with the
  carnation--" I tapped my pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"Another note?"</p>

  <p>"Another note."</p>

  <p>He drew himself up and, with the help of his stick, descended.</p>

  <p>"We are not very busy to-night," he said. "Jos&eacute;, keep an eye upon the
  door. I shall be in the flat."</p>

  <p>We followed him there. I had been so engrossed in my own affairs during
  the last few days that I had scarcely given a thought to anyone else and I
  was shocked, as he sank into his easy chair, to see the dark rings under his
  eyes and the even more striking pallor of his face with its finely cut
  features. He seemed, if such a thing were possible, to have grown thinner
  during the last twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>"Another thousand-pound note," he muttered, looking up at me, and I could
  see the veins on the backs of those delicate hands of his standing out as he
  gripped the arms of the chair. "And the carnation."</p>

  <p>Julie suddenly, regardless of her toilette, dropped on her knees by the
  side of his chair, her left arm embraced him, with her right hand she
  caressed his cheek.</p>

  <p><i>"Mon p&egrave;re,"</i> she whispered, "you are distressed! You know something.
  You suspect something. Is there a disaster behind these strange happenings?
  If there is Charles will face it bravely. You distress yourself too much,
  <i>mon pauvre</i>!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her tenderly. Her words apparently gave him courage.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he admitted. "The whole affair has revived an ancient fear.
  Perhaps I take it too seriously."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to be alarmed about anyhow that I can see, Louis," I said
  reassuringly. "If this is the beginning of a conspiracy what can anyone hope
  to gain by it?"</p>

  <p>"It is a strange way of doing things," he reflected. "In this world,
  though, there are many strange people."</p>

  <p>"Too mild a word," I insisted. "Lunatics! No sane person would play such
  tricks."</p>

  <p>Louis looked up at me suddenly. There was something of the prophet in his
  still set face and firm voice.</p>

  <p>"It is no lunatic who is dealing with you, Captain Lyson," he assured
  me.</p>

  <p>"Then you have an idea who it is?" I rejoined swiftly.</p>

  <p>"I suspect," he admitted. "But even then I could give you no coherent
  explanation. When I think that it is good for you to know the little that I
  surmise I shall tell it to you. Meanwhile," he concluded, rising once more to
  his feet, "I must go back to my place and you must be off to your
  ballet."</p>

  <p>He waved us away.</p>

  <p>"Upon your return from Covent Garden please come to me," he begged. "If I
  am not at my desk I shall be here."</p>

  <p>We promised and went on our way light-heartedly. I could find no tragedy
  in these strange happenings and Julie was looking adorable. It was not until
  the curtain went down on the first part of the programme and Julie and I were
  promenading amongst the crowd of notabilities in the foyer that it suddenly
  occurred to me that I might be entering upon the next chapter of my fantastic
  adventure. Strolling amongst the others was a tall, slim man of distinguished
  and unusual appearance. He walked in a fashion of his own with his hands
  behind his back. His face--he was clean-shaven with excellent features--was a
  little worn and more than a little lined. His height enabled him to look over
  the heads of most of the crowd but now and then he returned a greeting and
  vouchsafed a smile. In the lapel of his dress coat he was wearing a carnation
  of exactly the same unusual dark crimson as my own! Julie, whose fingers
  rested after the fashion of the foreigner upon my arm, suddenly tightened her
  grip.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she asked me softly, "who is that?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have seen him before," I admitted, "but I can't remember
  where."</p>

  <p>"You noticed his carnation--yes? It is exactly like yours. There is not
  another one in the place."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," I confessed, "and I notice something else at the present
  moment," I added. "I believe the curtain is going up on our comedy drama. The
  stranger is about to speak to us."</p>

  <p>I was right. With a courteous bow the latter paused in front of us. He
  addressed us as though we were old acquaintances. His voice was pleasant but
  his speech slow. There was just the suggestion of a foreign accent.</p>

  <p>"A very beautiful performance," he remarked. "Matveich to-night is at his
  best. A genius and at his best. We are fortunate."</p>

  <p>"It is the first time I have ever been in the audience when he has
  conducted his own music," Julie confided.</p>

  <p>"Well, I congratulate you," our new friend said.</p>

  <p>"The dancing--well, he has chosen perfect marionettes, but their
  interpretation is so graceful that one can forgive. So you, Captain Lyson, I
  am glad to see," he went on, turning to me, "are wearing the insignia of your
  new order."</p>

  <p>"In complete ignorance, if I may say so, as to its significance," I
  ventured.</p>

  <p>"You are curious?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it reasonable that I should be? Naturally I want to understand the
  meaning of these mysterious gifts."</p>

  <p>"And I," Julie interposed, "being a woman and possessed of even greater
  curiosity would like to know your name, sir, and why Captain Lyson has been
  tormented in this strange manner?"</p>

  <p>"Tormented is, I trust, too cruel a word," our friend objected. "I may
  have piqued his curiosity a little. It was necessary to incite his
  interest."</p>

  <p>"And your name, please?" Julie persisted.</p>

  <p>"That is a very simple affair," he replied. "My name is Alexander."</p>

  <p>"Alexander," she repeated. "Alexander what?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Who is there of us who would be willing to disclose
  at a moment's notice all the dear secrets of his life even to so charming a
  young lady as Louis' daughter? I have been called Prince Alexander, I have
  been called General Alexander, I have been called plain Mr. Alexander. You
  can take your choice. Any one of them would be more or less correct."</p>

  <p>"And the thousand-pound notes?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They constitute your entrance fee and your first year's subscription to
  the most exclusive club in the world," he confided. "It is a club, too, which
  has exceptional conditions. For instance, in most institutions of the sort
  the member pays his entrance fee and pays his subscription. In the case of
  the club to which you have been elected a member the club pays you."</p>

  <p>I was assailed with a sudden sentiment of mild irritation.</p>

  <p>"I am elected a member of a club, then, without knowing even its name and
  it pays two thousand pounds for the privilege of my membership?" I asked
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Neatly put," was the faintly ironic rejoinder. "Spend the money if you
  like. It is yours. In the meantime you will be asked to present yourself at
  headquarters within a few hours. A slight formality. Nothing that need
  disconcert you."</p>

  <p>"But supposing I don't wish--"</p>

  <p>"Ah, we will not suppose anything like that," our new acquaintance
  interrupted, showing signs of departure. "If you have any doubts ask my
  esteemed friend and, I gather, yours--Louis. <i>Au revoir, Mademoiselle</i>.
  My compliments, the compliments of Alexander, to your father. And to you,
  sir--<i>&agrave; bient&ocirc;t</i>."</p>

  <p>A Cabinet minister was waiting for him a yard or two off. They walked up
  the broad stairs together. Julie caught once more at my arm.</p>

  <p>"But this," she exclaimed, "I adore! And where in this world before have I
  seen a man so chic, with such a delightful presence? Alexander! Charles--tell
  me what uncrowned monarchs are wandering about the world?"</p>

  <p>A ray of hope suddenly presented itself.</p>

  <p>"Come along," I suggested, hurrying towards the doorway which led to our
  places. "We have your father to fall back upon. Hurry, Julie," I went on as a
  ripple of applause around us quickly deepened into a roar. "Matveich is
  taking his place."</p>

  <p><br>
  That night an extraordinary thing happened. Louis, my old friend Louis,
  showed distinct signs of wishing to avoid me. He left his desk as we arrived
  from Covent Garden and before I could intercept him he had entered his flat.
  When we returned from dancing in the restaurant below, although there were
  still people supping in the Grill Room, Louis had deserted his post. Julie
  was herself distressed.</p>

  <p>"What can be the matter with <i>mon p&egrave;re</i> tonight?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>I hesitated. She easily read my thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You must come in with me, of course," she continued. "We will ask what he
  means by hiding from us."</p>

  <p>We entered the flat. Louis was not in the tiny reception room. He was not
  in his study. Julie passed through into his bedroom closing the door after
  her. I waited for a few moments, then, as neither of them appeared, I went
  back into the little reception room and mixed myself a whisky and soda. I was
  so much a friend of the house that I kept a pipe in Louis' rack by the side
  of the fireplace. I helped myself to some tobacco and settled myself in an
  easy chair. It was at least a quarter of an hour before Julie reappeared,
  during which time the telephone bell had been ringing all the time in the
  bedroom. When she came she seemed a little flushed and I fancied that she had
  been engaged in some sort of a dispute.</p>

  <p>"Papa will come immediately," she announced.</p>

  <p>"He is all right, I hope?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," she replied. "He has been searching for some papers. He is
  expecting an important visitor."</p>

  <p>"Had I better go?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is your affair, I think. Since you are here he wishes you to
  remain."</p>

  <p>"I would like to stop," I admitted frankly.</p>

  <p>"Because you hate to leave me?" she asked with one of her provocative
  gestures.</p>

  <p>"Chiefly," I replied. "There is also another reason. I could not sleep a
  wink unless I had at least a glimmering of an idea as to what all this is
  about."</p>

  <p>Then Louis made his appearance and I was relieved to see that he was
  altogether a changed man. He established himself in his favourite chair and
  Julie hastened to mix his usual nightly beverage--a concoction of lime juice,
  tonic water and gin. He glanced at his watch and then at the clock.</p>

  <p>"I have ten minutes for explanations," he began. "I think, Captain," he
  went on, "that I can explain a good deal of what must seem very mysterious to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," I begged. "I'm all for it."</p>

  <p>"You met the Personage whom I will call Alexander to-night at the ballet,
  I understand?"</p>

  <p>"That is true," I replied. "He came and spoke to us. He spoke of my having
  joined some club or another."</p>

  <p>"You need not take that too seriously," Louis assured me. "Things have
  changed during the last few hours. As to Alexander, I think I am one of the
  few people in Europe who really know who he is. He is one of the great ones
  of the past world. He was Chief of Staff to the Grand Duke Michael and
  notwithstanding the fact that he was a very young man then he was practically
  responsible for all the Russian victories against Austria. He is the one
  remaining aristocrat of the old regime who still possesses ideas and the
  courage to fight."</p>

  <p>"What can he do in these days?"</p>

  <p>"He can fight against the one power in the world which he loathes and
  detests, the power which has ruined and corrupted his country," Louis went on
  gravely. "Never mind where the money came from--he is enormously wealthy. The
  whole of his wealth and his great influence--great, although he keeps it all
  the time underground--is devoted to one purpose, to fighting anarchists and
  the whole doctrine of communism in its worst phases wherever it springs up.
  He has already advanced over two millions to help the Spanish rebels. He is
  the most hated and dreaded man living amongst the Bolshevists of Russia. I
  tell you now a serious thing. He holds his hand at nothing when he is
  fighting against the leaders of these people. There is one who has still
  maintained a European influence. That one Alexander has sentenced to death.
  He needed the help of a brave man of adventurous spirit and I think, Captain
  Lyson, that you were the person whom he was going to call to his assistance.
  Fortunately it has become unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean Trobenitzky?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Heinrich Trobenitzky," Louis agreed, "Sometimes, however, the rats fight
  it out amongst themselves. The powers in Russia have become afraid of
  Trobenitzky. They have chased him out of his hiding place. He had plans for
  going to France but those plans have not matured. He took a risk and landed
  here with a false passport. He was arrested to-night--Hearnshaw was here--in
  this place. I have just heard from Hearnshaw that bail was refused."</p>

  <p>There was a soft knocking at the outer door and, without waiting for a
  reply, the man who had introduced himself to us in the foyer of the opera
  house made his appearance. Louis, leaning heavily upon his stick, rose to his
  feet and greeted the newcomer with every mark of respect. He motioned me to
  wheel out an easy chair.</p>

  <p>"You will permit me for a moment, sir," he begged, "to offer a few words
  of explanation?"</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that this strange visitor stiffened visibly. He was taller
  even than Louis and he looked at him as a prince might look at a courtier who
  had taken a liberty.</p>

  <p>"Do I need explanations from you, Louis?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Circumstances have so decreed it, sir," was the respectful reply. "They
  have also delivered into your hands exactly what you desire--only through a
  different channel."</p>

  <p>Louis paused. Alexander remained grimly and haughtily silent. Louis faced
  his task gallantly.</p>

  <p>"Trobenitzky spends to-night, sir, in an English prison."</p>

  <p>This time it was Louis who had scored. His listener, who was wearing a
  silk-lined cape over his evening clothes, threw it suddenly back as though
  short of breath. His cold eyes flashed. There was something splendid about
  his poise, something which seemed to suggest the eagle raising its head to
  scent the battle from afar.</p>

  <p>"Trobenitzky!" he repeated. "In an English prison! Repeat that,
  Louis."</p>

  <p>"It is true, sir," Louis assured him. "For reasons which you will
  understand better in a moment I have spent the whole of the last few hours
  upon this affair. Trobenitzky fled in terror from the home which has
  sheltered him lately dreading the arrival of assassins from Moscow. France is
  not ready for him. Germany will have nothing to do with him. He landed in
  England."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Alexander muttered--a long drawn-out syllable.</p>

  <p>"They had news of his coming," Louis proceeded. "Just now English
  statesmen are not looking for trouble of that sort. His passport was out of
  order. He was arrested to-night in my Grill Room and taken to Bow Street. To
  some extent it was a technical matter but it was sufficient. When I say that
  he is spending the night in an English prison it is the truth. He may leave
  it to-morrow but he will not step outside the cordon which the English police
  are drawing around him."</p>

  <p>"If they knew what I know," Alexander said calmly, "he would hang."</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely likely," Louis continued, "that he will leave this country
  alive. Still--will you hand this to our august visitor, Lyson?"</p>

  <p>I took the narrow strip of paper and passed it to Alexander. It was an
  open cheque signed by Louis for two thousand pounds!</p>

  <p>"I wish to point out to you in great respect and humility, sir," Louis
  went on, "these facts. Captain Lyson, although he has retired from active
  service, still holds a commission in the British army. He has remained a
  member of our military Secret Service. He also has liaison connections of
  which we do not speak with Scotland Yard. It would be the end of his career
  if he joined your society, sir. He loves adventure. He hates like poison that
  monster you hate, sir. But--"</p>

  <p>Alexander held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said.</p>

  <p>He looked at the cheque and he glanced across at me.</p>

  <p>"Is it true, Captain Lyson," he asked, "what Louis has just told me?"</p>

  <p>"It is, sir," I admitted.</p>

  <p>He tore the cheque in two.</p>

  <p>"A pity," he sighed.</p>

  <p>"Trobenitzky will be remanded to-morrow, of course," Louis explained. "He
  will be granted bail but he will be under police surveillance for the whole
  of the time he is allowed to remain in England. His campaign in France is
  already brought to an end."</p>

  <p>"And his life on this earth," Alexander said, "will soon follow. ... In
  the midst of tragedy we blunder into comedy," he concluded, turning towards
  me with a smile. "Captain Lyson, you will do me the honour of joining my club
  as an honorary member and I hope you will give me the pleasure of dining one
  night with Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"It will give me great pleasure, sir," I replied.</p>

  <p><br>
  That was the end of it all. The finest-looking man I have ever seen took his
  leave with a slight comprehensive gesture of farewell. Julie and I dined with
  him in great splendour a few nights later and the matter of the two
  thousand-pound notes became the subject of a friendly argument between our
  host and myself. The matter was decided whilst Julie was engaged in
  conversation with a very charming lady at the next table to whom we had been
  presented.</p>

  <p>"An idea occurs to me, my friend," Alexander declared. "I will accept your
  offer to return those notes on one condition. It is this. I have noticed--you
  will excuse me--some signs of an affectionate understanding between you and
  the daughter of my old friend Louis?"</p>

  <p>"We are great friends certainly," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he went on. "One can never tell how these things go, of
  course, and I trust that nothing I say will seem to you in the least
  presumptuous, but if by any chance I should hear that 'a marriage has been
  arranged' between you two young people you agree that this money which you
  have thrust back upon me shall be devoted to a wedding gift?"</p>

  <p>Julie was returning to the table so I had to make up my mind quickly.</p>

  <p>"I agree. A princely gift it will be if ever the occasion arises," I
  acknowledged in some embarrassment.</p>

  <p>So those two thousand-pound-notes were temporarily returned to the great
  anti-anarchist war chest of which Alexander holds the key. The dark
  carnation, however, which he had placed in her hand upon leaving the little
  flat a few nights before, Julie refused to part with.</p>
