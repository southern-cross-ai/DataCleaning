<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">
WAIST-HELD in the chains and soused in the fifty-foot-high
spray, Joe Byng eyed his sounding lead that swung like a pendulum
below him, and named it sacrilege.</p>

<p>"This 'ere navy ain't a navy no more," he muttered. "This
'ere's a school-gal promenade, 'and-in-'and, an' mind not to get
your little trotters wet, that's what this is, so 'elp me two
able seamen an' a red marine!"</p>

<p>From the moment that the lookout, lashed to the windlass drum
up forward, had spied the little craft away to leeward and had
bellowed his report of it through hollowed hands between the
thunder of the waves, Joe Byng had had premonitory symptoms of
uneasiness. He had felt in his bones that the navy was about to
be nose-led into shame.</p>

<p>At the wheel, both eyes on the compass, as the sea law bids,
but both ears on the more-even-than-usual-alert, Curley Crothers
felt the same sensations but expressed them otherwise.</p>

<p>"Admiral's orders!" he muttered. "Maybe the admiral was
drunk?"</p>

<p>The brass gongs clanged down in the bowels of H.M.S. Puncher
and she gradually lost what little weigh she had, rolling her
bridge ends under in the heave and hollow of a beam-on monsoon
sea.</p>

<p>"How much does he say he wants?" asked her commander.</p>

<p>Joe Byng in the chains and Curley Crothers at the wheel both
recognized the quarter tone instantly, and diagnosed it with
deadly accuracy; every vibration of his voice and every fiber of
his being expressed exasperation, though a landsman might have
noticed no more than contempt for what he had seen fit to log as
"half a gale."</p>

<p>"He says he'll take us in for fifty pounds, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! Tell him to make it shillings, or else to get out of my
course!"</p>

<p>It is not much in the way of Persian Gulf Arabic that a man
picks up from textbooks but at garnering the business end of
beach-born dialects&mdash;the end that gets results at least
expense of time or energy&mdash;the Navy goes even the Army
half a dozen better. The sublieutenant's argument, bawled from
the bridge rail to the reeling little boat below, was a marvel in
its own sweet way; it combined abuse and scorn with a cataclysmic
blast of threat in six explosive sentences.</p>

<p>"He says he'll take us in for ten pounds, sir," he reported,
without the vestige of a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ask Mr. Hartley to step up on the bridge, will you?"</p>

<p>Two minutes later, during which the nasal howls from the boat
were utterly ignored, the acting chief engineer hauled himself
along the rail hand over hand to windward, ducking below the
canvas guard as a more than usually big comber split against the
Puncher's side and hove itself to heaven.</p>

<p>"It beats me how any man can keep a coat on him this weather,"
he remarked, and the sublieutenant noticed that the streams that
ran down both his temples were not sea water. "Send for me?"</p>

<p>His temper, judging by his voice, would seem to be a lot worse
than could be due to the pitching of the ship.</p>

<p>"Yes. There's a pilot overside, and our orders are to take a
pilot aboard when running in, if available. There are three men
bailing that boat below there, and the sea's gaining on them.
They'll need rescuing within two hours. Then we'd have a pilot
aboard and would have saved the government ten pounds. Point is,
can you manage in the engine-room for two or three hours longer?
Three more waves like that last one and the man's ours
anyway!"</p>

<p>"He might not wait two hours," suggested Mr. Hartley. "He
might get tired of looking at us, and beat back into port. Then
where would be your strategy?"</p>

<p>"Then there wouldn't be a pilot available. I'd be justified in
going in without one. Point is, can you hold out below?"</p>

<p>"Man," said Mr. Hartley, "you're a genius." He peered through
the spray down to leeward, where the pilot's boat danced a death
dance alongside, heel and toe to the Puncher's statelier swing.
"Yes; there are three men bailing, and you're a genius. But no!
The answer's no! The engines'll keep on turning, maybe and
perhaps, until we make the shelter o' yon reef. There's no
knowing what a cherry-red bearing will do. I can give ye maybe
fifteen knots; maybe a leetle more for just five minutes, for
steerage way and luck, and after that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even crouched as he was against the canvas guard he contrived
to shrug his shoulders.</p>

<p>"But if we go in there are you sure you can contrive to patch
her up? It looks like a rotten passage, and not much of a berth
beyond it."</p>

<p>"I could cool her down."</p>

<p>"Oh, if that's all you want, I can anchor outside in thirty
fathoms."</p>

<p>Curley Crothers heard that and his whole frame stiffened;
there seemed a chance yet that the Navy might not be disgraced.
But it faded on the instant.</p>

<p>"Man, we've got to go inside and we've got to hurry! Better in
there than at the bottom of the Gulf! Put her where she'll hold
still for a day, or maybe two days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say a month!" suggested the commander caustically.</p>

<p>"Say three days for the sake of argument. Then I can put her
to rights. I daren't take down a thing while she's rolling
twenty-five and more, and I've got to take things down! Why, man,
the engine-room is all pollution from gratings to bilge; if I
loosened one more bolt than is loose a'ready her whole insides
'ud take charge and dance quadrilles until we drowned!"</p>

<p>"You won't try to make Bombay?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to give ye steam as far as the far side o' yon reef.
After that I wash my hands of a' responsibility!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Mr. White!"</p>

<p>The sublieutenant hauled himself in turn to windward. Curley
Crothers gave the wheel a half-spoke and looked as if he had no
interest in anything. Joe Byng in the chains bowed his head and
groaned inwardly; his sticky, spray-washed lead seemed
all-absorbing.</p>

<p>"Tell that black robber to hurry aboard, unless he wants me to
come in without him."</p>

<p>The little boat had drifted fast before the wind, and the
sublieutenant had to bellow through a megaphone to where the
three men bailed and the ragged oarsmen swung their weight
against the storm. The man of ebony, who would be pilot and
disgrace the Navy, balanced on a thwart with wide-spread naked
toes and yelled an ululating answer. With his rags out-blown in
the monsoon he looked like a sea wraith come to life. The big
gongs clanged again, and the Puncher drifted rather than drove
down on the smaller craft. A hand line caught the pilot precisely
in the face. He grabbed it frantically, fell headlong in the sea,
and was hauled aboard.</p>

<p>"He says he wants a tow for that boat of his," reported the
sublieutenant. "Said it in English, too&mdash;seems he knows
more than he pretends."</p>

<p>"Missed it, by gad, by just about five minutes!" said the
commander aloud but to himself. "Well&mdash;the bargain's made,
so it can't be helped. That boat's sinking! Throw 'em a line,
quick!"</p>

<p>The pilot's crew displayed no overdone affection for their
craft, and there was no struggle to the last to leave it. One by
one&mdash;whichever could grab the line first was the first to
come&mdash;they were hauled through the thundering waves and
their boat was left to sink. Then, before they could adjust their
unaccustomed feet to the different balance of the Puncher's
heaving deck, the gongs clanged and the destroyer leaped ahead
like a dripping sea-soused water beetle, into her utmost speed
that instant.</p>

<p>All conscious of his new-won dignity, and utterly regardless
of his boat, the pilot had found the bridge at once. He clung to
the rail there and braced one naked foot against a stanchion. To
him the ship's speed seemed the all-absorbing thing, for either
Mr. Hartley had forgotten just how many revolutions would make
fifteen knots or else he had underestimated his engine-room's
capacity. The Puncher split the waves and spewed them twenty feet
above her, racing head-on for the reef, and Curley Crothers was
too busy at his wheel to pass the pilot the surreptitious insult
he intended.</p>

<p>The gongs clanged presently, and the Puncher swallowed half
her speed at once, giving the pilot courage.</p>

<p>"This exceedingly damn dangerous place, sah!" he remarked.</p>

<p>"No bottom at eight!" sang Joe Byng in the chains.</p>

<p>Three words passed between the commander and Crothers, and the
Puncher hove a weed-draped underside high over the crest of a
beam-on roller as she veered a dozen points, ducked her starboard
rail into the trough of it, and sliced her long thin nose,
sizzling and swirling, into the welter ahead. It was growing
weedier and dirtier each minute.</p>

<p>"No bottom at eight!" chanted Joe Byng.</p>

<p>And at the sound of his voice the pilot hauled himself up by
his leverage on the rail and found his voice again.</p>

<p>"This most exceedingly damn dangerous place, sah!"</p>

<p>But the commander was too busy acting all three L's&mdash;
Log, Lead and Lookout&mdash;his shrouded figure swaying to the
heave and fall and his eyes fixed straight ahead of him on the
double line of boiling foam. He had conned his course and had it
charted in his head. There was no time to argue with a pilot.</p>

<p>"Port you-ah hel-um, sah! Port you-ah hel-um!"</p>

<p>"By the mark&mdash;seven!" sang Joe Byng from the
chains.</p>

<p>"Port you-ah hel-um, sah!" yelled the pilot in an ecstasy of
fright.</p>

<p>"Starboard a little," came the quiet command.</p>

<p>Curley Crothers moved his wheel and the Puncher's bow yawed
twenty feet, as if Providence had pushed her.</p>

<p>"Gawd A'mighty!" murmured Joe Byng, gazing open-mouthed at
fifty feet of jagged rock that grinned up suddenly three waves
away.</p>

<p>The pilot braced both feet against a stanchion and tried to
take the weigh off her by pulling.</p>

<p>"Half speed, sah! Go slow, sah! Go dead slow, sah! You'll pile
up you-ah damn ship, sah! Ah tell you, sah, you'll pile her up as
suah as hell, sah! 'Bout a million sharks round he-ah, sah! For
the love o' God, sah&mdash;Captain, sah&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, muzzle him, some one!" ordered the commander, and the
jiggling, complaining engines danced ahead, the horrid gray
beneath the pilot's ebony notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"By the deep&mdash;four!" warned Joe Byng in a level
sing-song. The two gongs clanged like an echo to him, and the
Puncher's speed was reduced at once to her point, of minimum
stability. She rolled and quivered like a living thing in fear,
falling on and off, nosing out a passage on her own account
apparently, and seeming to be gathering all her strength for one
tremendous effort.</p>

<p>"That's bettah, sah! That's bettah, Captain, sah! Go astern!
This he-ah's the bar, sah&mdash;damn bad place, the bar, sah!
Go astern, sah. Captain, sah, d'you he-ah me&mdash;go astern!
Try again, 'nother place further up, sah. Captain, sah! Over that
way; that way thar&mdash;that way, sah!"</p>

<p>He pointed through the sky-flung spray with a trembling finger
and his voice was rich with doleful emphasis, but the commander
held his course and carried on. There seemed neither sympathy nor
understanding on that unsteadiest of ships. Curley Crothers,
solemn-faced as Nemesis and looking half as compassionate, moved
his wheel a trifle. Joe Byng in the chains kept up his even
sing-song, expressionless, as if he were an automatic clock that did
not care, but must record the truth each time his dripping
pendulum touched bottom.</p>

<p>"And a half&mdash;three!"</p>

<p>White foam was boiling in among the dirty welter, and the
Puncher's bow pitched suddenly as the first big bar wave lifted
her; a second later her propellers chug-chug-chugged in surface
spume as she kicked upward like a porpoise diving.</p>

<p>"Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy!" groaned the pilot. "This he-ah
watah's full of sharks, an' that's the bar! You're on the bar
now, Captain, sah!"</p>

<p>"By the mark&mdash;three!" Byng chanted steadily.</p>

<p>"Starboard a little more," said the commander leaning forward
and shoving the pilot away to leeward at the same time. Then he
shouted to the fo'castle head, where a bosun's mate and his crew
had climbed and were awaiting orders in evident and most
unreasonable unconcern.</p>

<p>"Get both anchors ready!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" came the answer, and efficiency controlled by
experts proceeded at kaleidoscopic angles to defy the elements.
The big steel hooks were ready in an instant.</p>

<p>"Stop her!" ordered the commander.</p>

<p>The gongs clanged out an alarm and the throbbing ceased.</p>

<p>"Hard astern, both engines!"</p>

<p>Again there was a clangor under hatches, and the suffering
bearings shrieked. The Puncher dropped her stern two feet or so,
and the foam boiled brown round her propellers. The shock of the
reversal pitched the pilot up against the forward rail, where he
clung like a drowning man.</p>

<p>"For the love o' God, sah! Captain; sah, we've struck! Ah told
you so; Ah said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a half-three!" chanted Joe Byng.</p>

<p>"Stop her! Starboard engine ahead! Port engine ahead! Ease
your helm! Meet her! Half speed ahead!"</p>

<p>The Puncher pitched and rolled, kicking at the following
monsoon that thundered at her counter and tossing up the foam
that seethed about her bow. She trembled from end to end, as if
the pounding of the water hurt her.</p>

<p>"Helm amidships!" ordered the commander suddenly.</p>

<p>"'Midships, sir!"</p>

<p>"Full speed ahead, both engines!"</p>

<p>The Puncher leaped, as all destroyers do the second day they
are loosed. She sliced through the storm straight for the coral
beach beyond the bar, shaking her graceful shoulders free of the
sticky spray&mdash;reeling, rolling, thugging, kicking, bucking
through the welter to where quiet water waited and the
ever-lasting, utterly unrighteous stink of sun-baked Arab
beaches. As each tremendous breaker thundered on her stern each
time she lifted to the underswell, the pilot vowed that she had
struck, rolling his eyes and calling two different deities to
witness that none of it was any fault of his.</p>

<p>"Thar's no water, sah&mdash;no water, Captain, sah&mdash;
not one drop! You've piled up you-ah ship! Ah told you so; Ah
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the deep&mdash;four!"</p>

<p>"And a half-four!"</p>

<p>"By the mark&mdash;five!"</p>

<p>The Puncher was across the bar, gliding through muddy water on
an even keel and giving the lie direct to him whose fee was ten
pounds English. The pilot drew a talisman of some kind from
underneath the least torn portion of his shirt, and to the
commander's amazement kissed it. It is not often that a woolly
headed, or any other, native of the East kisses either folk or
things. But the commander was too busy at the moment to ask
questions.</p>

<p>"Have your starboard anchor ready!" he commanded, making
mental notes.</p>

<p>"Ready, sir!"</p>

<p>The glittering, wet, wind-blown beach and the little estuary
slid by like a painted panorama smelling of all the evil in the
world as the Puncher eased her helm a time or two seeking a
comfortable berth with Joe Byng's chanted aid.</p>

<p>"Let go twenty fathoms!"</p>

<p>The pilot sighed relief as the starboard anchor splashed into
the water and the cable roared after it through the hawse
pipe.</p>

<p>"What nationality are you?" asked the commander, watching the
Puncher swing and gaging distances, but sparing one eye now for
his unwelcome but official guest.</p>

<p>"Me, sah?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you."</p>

<p>The pilot looked anywhere but at his questioner, and a picture
passed before the commander's eyes&mdash;a memory, perhaps, of
something he had read about at school&mdash;of Christians in
Nero's day being asked what their religion was.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid to tell me?" he asked, softening his voice to
a kinder tone as he remembered that God did not make all men
Englishmen, and turning just in time to cause Crothers to
withdraw his right leg.</p>

<p>The pilot's toes were, after all, not destined to be trodden
on just then.</p>

<p>"No, sah, Ah'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"What are you, then?"</p>

<p>"Ah'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well? What?"</p>

<p>"Ah'm English!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Captain, sah, Ah'm English!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Are you? Um-m-m! Mr. White, give this man his ten pounds,
will you? And get his receipt for it."</p>

<p>That appeared to end matters, so far as the commander was
concerned; official dignity forbade any further interest. But it
was not so very long since Mr. White was senior midshipman, and
it takes a man until he is admiral of the fleet to unlearn all he
knew then and forget the curiosity of those days.</p>

<p>"Now, I should have thought you were a Scotchman," he
suggested without smiling, studying the salt-encrusted wrinkles
on the ebony face. "You like whisky?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah&mdash;positively, sah! Yes, Captain, sah&mdash;
Ah do!"</p>

<p>Mr. White sent for whisky and poured out a stiff four fingers,
to the awful disgust of Curley Crothers, who saw the whole
transaction. The pilot consumed it so instantly that there seemed
never to have been any in the glass.</p>

<p>"I suppose your name's Macnab&mdash;or Macphairson&mdash;
which? Sign here, please."</p>

<p>The pilot took the proffered pen in unaccustomed fingers and
made a crisscross scrawl, adorned with thirteen blots. The pen
nib broke under the strain, and he handed it back with an air of
confidential remonstrance.</p>

<p>"That thing's no mo-ah good," he volunteered.</p>

<p>"So I see. Now tell me your name in full, so that I can write
it next to the mark. It's a wonder of a mark! Mac&mdash;what's
the rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Hassan Ah."</p>

<p>"Machassan?"</p>

<p>"No, sah. Hassan Ah."</p>

<p>"And you're English?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"With that name?"</p>

<p>"Mah name makes no diffunts, sah. Ah'm English."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;here's your money. Cutter away, there! Put the
pilot and his crew ashore! Sorry about your boat, pilot, but it
couldn't be helped."</p>

<p>"Makes me believe that I'm a nigger!" muttered Curley
Crothers, not yet released from duty on the bridge.</p>

<p>"First time I ever wished I was a Dutchman!" swore Joe Byng,
coiling up his sounding line.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the cutter's captain swung the boat's stern
in shore when he judged that he was reasonably near enough and
too far in for sharks. He had his orders to put the pilot and his
crew ashore, but the means had not been too exactly
specified.</p>

<p>"Get out and swim for it, you bally Englishman!" he ordered,
using a boat-hook on the nearest one to make his meaning
clear.</p>

<p>One by one they jumped for it, the pilot going last. He
plainly did not understand the point of view.</p>

<p>"Ah'm English!" he expostulated. "Lissen he-ah, Ah'm English!
Damwell English!"</p>

<p>"All right; let's see you swim, English!" jeered the cutter's
captain, and the pilot took the water with a splash.</p>

<p>"Ah su-ah am English!" he vowed, as he swam for the shore, and
he stood by the sea's edge repeating his assertion with a
leathery pair of lungs until the cutter had rowed out of
ear-shot.</p>

<p>"English, is he?" said Joe Byng to Curley Crothers in the
fo'castle, not twenty minutes later. "I'd show him, if I had him
in here for twenty minutes!"</p>

<p>"That fellow's interested me," said Crothers. "He's got me
thinking. I vote we investigate him."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Ashore, fathead."</p>

<p>"There'll be no shore leave."</p>

<p>"No? You left off being wet nurse to the dawg?"</p>

<p>"I brush him, mornin's; if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"Is he fit?"</p>

<p>"Fit to fight a bumboat full o' pilots!"</p>

<p>"Could he be sick for an hour?"</p>

<p>"Might be did."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Morning?"</p>

<p>"At about two bells?"</p>

<p>"It could be done."</p>

<p>"Then do it!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, Joe Byng my boy, you and I want shore leave; and the
pup&mdash;and he's a decent pup&mdash;must suffer for to make
a 'tween-deck holiday. Get my meaning? I've a propagandrum
that'll work this tide. You go and set the fuse in the pup's
inside; and mind you, time it right, my son&mdash;for two bells
when the old man's in the chair!"</p>

<p>So Joe Byng, who was something of an expert in the way and
ways of dogs, departed in search of an oiler with whom he was on
terms of condescension; and he returned to the fo'castle a little
later with the nastiest, most awful-smelling mess that ever
emanated even from the engine-room of a destroyer in the Persian
Gulf (where grease and things run rancid.)</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="first">
LYING lazily at anchor off the reeking beach of Adra Bight,
the Puncher looked peaceful and complacent&mdash;which is
altogether opposite to what she and her commander were, or had
been, for a month. The ship hummed her shut-in discontent, as a
hive does when the bees propose to swarm, and her commander
&mdash;who never, be it noted, went to windward of the one word
"damn"&mdash;used that one word very frequently.</p>

<p>He sat "abaft the mainmast" at a table that was splotched
already with abundant perspiration, and the acting engineer who
stood in front of him shifted from foot to foot in attitudes
expressive of increasing agony of mind. It grew obvious at last
that there was a limit to Mr. Hartley's store of courteous
deference.</p>

<p>There had been news, red hot but wrong, of dhows loaded to the
water-line with guns and ammunition somewhere up the Gulf. India,
ever fretful for her tribes beyond the border, had borrowed
Applewaite and his destroyer by instant cablegram, and jealously
held records had been broken while the Puncher quartered those
indecent seas and heated up her bearings. It was almost too much
to have to come back empty-handed. It was quite too much to have
to run for shelter under the lee of Adra's uninviting coral reef.
And to be told by an acting engineer that he would have to stay a
week was utterly beyond the scope of polite conversation.</p>

<p>"Why a week?" asked Commander Applewaite, with eyebrows raised
to the nth power of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Why a week?" asked Mr. Hartley, breaking down the barrier of
self-restraint at last. "I'll tell you why. Because, although the
guts of her are so much scrap-iron, you've a crew of engineers
who could build machinery of hell-slag&mdash;build it, mind
&mdash;and could get steam out o' the Sahara, where there isn't
any water at all.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;conditional upon the act o' God and your
permission&mdash;I'm willing to perform a miracle. Because the
whole engine-room complement is dancing mad for shore leave, and
there'll be none this side o' Bombay; and because, in consequence
o' that, creation would be a mild name for what's about to happen
under gratings until the shafts revolve again. Man, I wish ye'd
take one peep at her bearings, though ye wouldn't understand.</p>

<p>"Because you're lucky; any other engineer in all the navies o'
the world would take a month to tinker with her, even if he
didn't have to send to Bombay for a tow. Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do!" said Applewaite, his mind wandering already in
search of suitable employment for the crew. "Get the repairs done
as soon as possible; we stay here until you have finished what is
necessary."</p>

<p>It looked like an evil moment for asking favors, but it was
the time laid down in Regulations when such things as favors may
be had; and it was the moment Curley Crothers had picked out for
asking for shore leave.</p>

<p>"Come 'ere, Scamp. Come along, Scamp. Come along 'ere&mdash;
good boy!" he coaxed, dragging by a short chain in his wake the
sorriest-looking bull terrier that ever acted mascot in the
British or any other navy. Courteous and huge and cap in hand,
his weather-beaten face smiling respectfully above a snow-white
uniform, he took his stand before the little table. His outward
bearing was one of certainty, but his shrewd, slightly puckered
eyes alternately conned the expression of his commander's face
and watched the dog.</p>

<p>The lee, scuppers were the goal of the dog's immediate
ambition, for he was a well-brought-up dog and such of the
decencies as were not his by instinct he had learned by painful
and repeated acquisition. But at the moment Curley Crothers
showed a wondrous disregard for etiquette.</p>

<p>"He's very sick, sir," he asserted, tugging a little at the
chain in the hope of producing instant proof of his contention.
But the dog was gamiest of the game, and swallowed hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Well? I'm not a vet. What about it?"</p>

<p>"The whole ship's crew 'ud be sorry, sir, if 'e was to lose
'is number. He's the best mascot this ship ever had, by all
accounts."</p>

<p>"He hasn't brought us much luck this run!" smiled Applewaite,
remembering a long list of "previous convictions" and wondering
what Crothers might be up to next.</p>

<p>"No, sir? We're still a-top o' the water, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! He gets the credit for that, eh? But for him, I suppose
we'd have piled up on the reef yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Saving your presence, sir."</p>

<p>Curley Crothers made a gesture expressive of a world of
compliment and praise, but he kept one eye steadily on the dog;
he seemed to imply that but for the presence of the dog on board
the commander might have forgotten his seamanship.</p>

<p>"Well? What do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"Seeing the poor dog's sick, sir, and you and all of us so
fond of him, and all he needs is exercise, I thought perhaps as
'ow you'd order me an' Byng, sir, to take 'im for a run ashore.
There'd be jackals and pi-dogs for 'im to chase. A bit o' sport
'ud set 'im up in a jiffy. He's languishing&mdash;that's what's
the matter with him."</p>

<p>There were almost tears in his voice as he tugged at the chain
surreptitiously, in a vain effort to produce the cataclysm that
was overdue. But for all his efforts to appear affected, his eyes
were smiling. So were his commander's.</p>

<p>"Why Byng?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Byng cleans him, sir. He knows Byng."</p>

<p>"Then, why you?"</p>

<p>"Why; he knows me too, sir, and between the two of us, we'd
manage him proper. S'posin' he was to get huntin' on his own and
one of us was tired out chasin' him, t'other could run and catch
him. If there was only one of us, he couldn't."</p>

<p>"I see. Well? One of the other men might take him on the
chain. A good-conduct man, for instance."</p>

<p>Crothers tugged at the chain, and the unhappy dog drew away
toward the scuppers with all his remaining strength.</p>

<p>"He's cussed about the chain, sir&mdash;apt to drag on it
and try to chaw it through. Besides, sir, when a dawg's sick,
he's like a man&mdash;same as me an' you; he likes to 'ave 'is
partic'lar pals with 'im. Now, that dawg's fond o' me an'
Byng.'</p>

<p>"I see. But supposing exercise isn't what he wants after all?
Suppose he needs a long rest and lots of sleep? How about
that?"</p>

<p>The argument had reached a crisis, and Curley realized it.
Joking or not, when the commander of a ship takes too long in
reaching a decision he generally does not reach a favorable one.
The leash was tugged again, this time with some severity. The
martyred Scamp was drawn on his protesting haunches close to the
official table, that the commander might have a better view of
his distress. And then the expected happened&mdash;
voluminously.</p>

<p>Curley stood with an expression of wooden-headed, abject
innocence on his big, broad face, and looked straight in front of
him.</p>

<p>"He certainly is sick, sir," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Sick. Good heavens! The dog's turning himself inside out!
That's the last time a thing like this happens; he's the last dog
I ever take on a cruise. Take him away at once! Bosun&mdash;
call some one to wipe up that disgusting mess!"</p>

<p>"Take him ashore, did you say, sir?"</p>

<p>"Take him out of this! Take him anywhere you like! Yes, take
him ashore and lose him&mdash;feed him to the sharks&mdash;
give him to the Arabs&mdash;take him away, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Me and Byng, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you and Byng! Did you hear me tell you to take him
away?"</p>

<p>"Very good, sir; thank you!"</p>

<p>Curley Crothers saluted without the vestige of a smile, and
hurried off before the dog could show too early signs of
recovering health and strength or the commander could change his
mind.</p>

<p>"Come on, Scamp," he whispered. "That was nothing but a
temporary disaccommodation to your tummy, doglums; we'll soon
have you to rights again."</p>

<p>He dived into the fo'castle with the dog behind him, and there
were those who noticed that the terrier's whip-like tail no
longer hugged his stomach, but was waving to the world at
large.</p>

<p>And thirty minutes later, as the Puncher's launch put off with
Curley and Joe Byng comfortably seated in the stern, it was
obvious to any one who cared to look that Scamp was the happiest
and healthiest terrier in Asia.</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder what they did to him," mused the Puncher's
commander, watching from beneath his awning. "Those two men live
up to the name they brought aboard! I believe they'd find means
and a good excuse for walking to windward of a First Sea
Lord!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="first">
NOW an Arab would as soon allow a dog to lick his face as he
would think of eating pork in public with his women folk; so the
bearded, hook-nosed believers in the Prophet who looked down from
the rock wall that lines one side of Adra knew what to think of
Curley and his friend Joe Byng long before either of them
realized that they were being watched.</p>

<p>Arrayed from head to ankles in spotless white, their black
boots looking blacker by comparison, they proceeded in the
general direction of the distant village, with the order and
decorum of sea lords descending on a dockyard for inspection
purposes. The trackless sand proved hot and sharp; the dog proved
in poor condition from the voyage and the morning's incidental
martyrdom, and Byng was generous-hearted. He picked up the dog
and carried him; and Scamp displayed his gratitude in customary
canine way.</p>

<p>The comments of the watching Arabs would not fit into any
story in the world, and it is quite as well that Crothers and Joe
Byng did not hear them and could not have translated them, for in
the other case trouble would have started even sooner than it
did. As it was, they tumbled and maneuvered over unresisting sand
through almost tangible stench to where a gap in the ragged wall
did duty as a gate. As they came nearer, a banner with the star
and crescent was displayed from the wall-top, but no other sign
was given that their coming was observed.</p>

<p>It was not until they had debouched (as Crothers termed it) to
their half-right front and had taken to a narrow one-man track
that ran below the wall that any over attention was paid them.
Suddenly a hook-nosed Asiatic gentleman emerged through the
once-was gateway&mdash;a picture of a Bible shepherd but for
the long-barreled gun he carried instead of crook&mdash;a brown
shadow against brown masonry. He challenged them in Arabic, and
Curley Crothers answered him in Queen Victoria's English that all
was well.</p>

<p>"Everything in the garden's lovely!" he asserted, in a
deep-sea sing-song. "How's yourself?"</p>

<p>The man repeated whatever he had said before, this time with a
gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Friend!" roared Byng and Curley both together. And the bull
terrier took the joint yell for a war cry, or a bunting call, or
possibly the herald's overture that summons bull pups to
Valhalla. He was bred right and British Navy trained and his was
not to reason why. He waited for no second invitation, but lit
out from Byng's arms like a streak&mdash;a whip-tail,
snow-white streak&mdash;for where the Arab's hard lean legs
shone shiny-brown below his fluttering brown raiment.</p>

<p>"Come back, there!" yelled both keepers in excited unison, but
they called too late.</p>

<p>Each grabbed for the chain too late. Their heads and shoulders
cannoned and they fell together on the hot, dirty sand while
Scamp and the Arab made each other's intimate acquaintance in a
whirl of ripping cloth and legs and teeth and blasphemy.</p>

<p>That in itself was bad enough, and good enough excuse if such
were wanted for war between the Shadow of God Upon Earth and
England's distant Queen; but there was worse to follow.</p>

<p>One does not laugh, between certain parallels, unless the
ultimate degree of insult is intended. And Curley Crothers and
Joe Byng did laugh. They held their ribs and laughed until their
muscles ached and their strong men's strength oozed out of
them.</p>

<p>They were laughing when they grabbed the dog at last and
pulled him off. They laughed as they set the Arab on his feet and
gave him back his gun; and they laughed at him with Christian and
mannerly good grace when he spat at them in awful frenzy until
the spittle matted in his beard. And, being gentlemen after a
fashion quite their own, they smilingly apologized.</p>

<p>Arabia lies in the middle of the zone where laughter is not
wisdom. And a smile lies midway in the measure of a laugh. A
laugh might be unintentional. A smile must be deliberate. And the
Arab's spittle was run dry. Creed, custom, law of tooth for tooth
and the thought of half a hundred co-religionists all watching
him from crannies in the wall combined to make him shoot, since
further means of showing malice were denied him; and he raised
the long butt to his shoulder with meaning that was
unmistakable.</p>

<p>And so, with sorrow that the East should be so lacking in good
fellowship, but with the ready instinct of men who have been
trained for war, they closed with him from two directions,
swiftly, bull-dog-wise, and took his gun away. And how could even
an able seaman help the dog's taking a share in the game
again?</p>

<p>So far, nobody had done anything intended to be wrong&mdash;
least of all the dog. The Arab was defending institutions;
Crothers and Joe Byng were bent on holiday, and full of kind
regards for anything that lived; and the dog was living dogfully
up to well-bred-terrier tradition. It was as if two harmless
chemicals had met and blended into nitroglycerin.</p>

<p>Deprived of his gun, the Arab drew a knife; and no British
sailor lives who does not understand the quick-loosed answer to
the glint of steel. Fist and boot both landed on the Arab quicker
than his own thought served the knife, and the weight of quick
concussions jarred him into all but coma. This time Byng caught
the dog in time and held him back, leaving Curley Crothers to
finish matters by making the long knife prize of war. Once more
he helped the Arab on his feet, smiling hugely and gentling the
iron sinews with huge paws that could have wrenched them all
apart if need be.</p>

<p>"Take my advice, cully, and weigh quick!" he counseled,
looking the Arab over and making sure the unfortunate had not
been too much hurt. "Run for shelter where you can cool your
bearings! Run off to the mosque and pray, to make up for all that
cussing. Go and be good! And next time you meets us, be friendly
&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>The Arab was too apoplectically angry to comply, but Crothers
took him by both shoulders and shoved him; and finding himself
shot forward out of reach, seeing safety ahead and its possible
corollary of awful vengeance, he suddenly achieved discretion and
scampered through the gap in the wall.</p>

<p>"'E's gone to fetch his pals. Look out, mate!" warned Joe
Byng.</p>

<p>"Not 'im!" vowed Crothers. "'E's 'ad enough, that's all! We've
seen the last of 'im!"</p>

<p>And the most amazing thing of all was that Crothers believed
just what he said&mdash;Curley Crothers, to whom Red Sea and
Persian Gulf ports were as an open book, and to whom the Arab
customs and religion and reprehensible tendencies were currently
supposed to be first-reader knowledge. It was he who had proved
there were no harems&mdash;he who coined the Navy adage,
"Search an Arab first, and sit on him, before you come to
terms!"</p>

<p>Yet here he was, advising Byng to disregard a looted Arab's
spittle! There is no accounting, ever, for the ways of
shore-leave sailor-men.</p>

<p>"Come on, Joe," he said. "Lead the dawg&mdash;he can walk
now&mdash;and let's see what Adra looks like."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p class="first">
ALL might have been well, and both seamen might have reached
the Puncher again with dignity and grace, had they not entered
Adra, past the only jail in that part of Arabia. And an Arab jail
being rarer and one percent more evil than any other evil thing
there is, the two of them quite naturally paused to make its
closest possible acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Look out for vermin!" cautioned Curley, standing on tiptoe to
peer in through the close-spaced iron bars.</p>

<p>They forgot the dog. The jail, for the moment, challenged all
their waking senses, the olfactory by no means least.</p>

<p>"Can you see anything?" asked Byng.</p>

<p>Before Crothers could answer him, a snarl, then a yap, then a
quick, determined growl gave warning of the terrier's interest in
something else than fleas.</p>

<p>He had been scratching himself peacefully a moment earlier;
now, like a bower anchor taking charge, he ripped the chain
through Byng's hand and was off&mdash;chin, back and tail in
one straight, striving line&mdash;in full chase of a
pariah.</p>

<p>The yellow cur yapped its agony of fear; the nearest hundred
and odd mangy monsters of the gutter took up the chorus; within
five seconds of the start there was the Puncher's mascot racing
after one abominable scavenger, and after him in just as hot
pursuit there raced the whole street-cleaning force of Adra
&mdash;tongues out, eyes blazing, and their mean thin barks all
working overtime.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Scamp!" groaned Byng, estimating rapidly.</p>

<p>"Not yet it ain't!" said Crothers, grabbing Byng's arm and
nearly tearing out the muscles.</p>

<p>It was a crude way of rousing Byng's latent speed, both of
thought and movement, but it worked. Before Joe could swear,
even, Crothers was off like the wind, with Joe after him, using
the string of oaths he had meant for Crothers on the sand that
gave under him and made him stumble at every other stride.</p>

<p>Adra turned out, as a colony of prairie dogs might from
planless burrows; only these had more venom in their bite than
prairie dogs and came from structural instead of natural, from
flea-bepeppered instead of grass-grown dirt. Man, woman and child
&mdash;the grown men armed, the women veiled in dirt-brown, some
of them, and some (mostly the better-looking) unveiled and
unashamed, the little children mostly naked and colored with all
the human hues there are&mdash;raced, yelling, through a swarm
of flies in hot pursuit. Never since Shem's great-grandson gat
the Arab race was there a procession like it.</p>

<p>Behind its mud-and-Masonry decrepit wall that guards only the
seaward side, Adra straggles quite a distance desertward; and
there are winding streets enough to hide an army in, provided
that the army did not mind the fleas. Scamp, view-halloaing his
utmost, led that most amazing hunt a quite considerable circuit
before other men and dogs, arriving from a dozen different
directions, set a limit to his unobstructed movement.</p>

<p>He knew what he was after, but they did not; they had come to
see. For a moment they seemed to think that Scamp was the object
of the chase, and a dozen guns of a dozen different kinds and
dates were aimed at him.</p>

<p>And then, as consciousness dawns on a man recovering from
choloform, there swept over their lethargic Eastern brains the
simultaneous idea that Curley Crothers and Joe Byng were the real
quarry; and&mdash;again like men recovering from chloroform
&mdash;they did not quite know what to do. Should they slay,
there was the Puncher to be reckoned with; and the Puncher's port
quick-firers could be seen commanding Adra by any man who cared
to climb the wall.</p>

<p>Besides, an Arab's hospitality is proverbial. He very seldom
kills a visitor on sight.</p>

<p>On the other hand a man, and particularly a British sailor,
who runs has reason, as a rule. Therefore these two men were
evidently guilty. Therefore they must not escape. In five seconds
the affair had changed from a spectacular amusement, with Adra's
population in the role of super-heated audience, to a hunt of
Crothers and Joe Byng.</p>

<p>Within ten seconds each of the sailors lay with his face
pressed hard into the sand and at least a dozen Arabs sitting on
him. Scamp&mdash;utterly forgotten now by all except the
sailors&mdash;still behind the one stray pariah and ahead of
all the rest but beginning to appreciate the fact that he was
hunted, and beginning to feel spent&mdash;raced on, took three
sharp turns in close succession, and was gathered all unwilling
in the arms of an enormous black man who snatched him from the
very teeth of the following pack and dispersed them, howling, by
means of well-directed kicks.</p>

<p>"Ah seed you yesterday, Ah did," said his deliverer in
English; and, recalling principle, the terrier bit at him&mdash;
only to find himself muzzled by a horny, huge fist that caressed
even while it rendered impotent.</p>

<p>"Ah'm fond of little dogs! Ah'm English!"</p>

<p>Scamp understood nothing of the conversation, but with canine
instinct realized that he was safe; and after that he was
satisfied to lie and pant. With five red inches of tongue hanging
out, and no sign whatever of his white-uniformed guardians to
trouble him, a black man's arms were as good as any other place;
he did not waste half a thought on Byng and Crothers.</p>

<p>But Byng, three turnings back, spat filthy sand out of his
mouth the moment an Arab deemed it safe to leave off sitting on
his head, looked wildly around for Crothers, and bellowed:</p>

<p>"Where's the pup?"</p>

<p>Crothers, spitting out sand, too, twenty yards behind where
the swifter Byng had fallen, called back:</p>

<p>"Dunno. Whistle him!"</p>

<p>Byng tried to whistle, and the Arabs mistook the effort for a
signal. In an instant both men were face-downward again,
struggling for breath and clawing at the dirt. Then worse befell.
The gentleman whose brown anatomy had suffered from the seamen's
feet and fists just previous to their invasion of the town limped
up with his eye teeth showing and his flapping cotton raiment
still unmended where the dog had torn it. Any other wrath,
however awful, could be nothing but the shadow of his state of
mind; and since he knew the more vindictive portions of the Koran
all by heart, and was quoting as he came, there was little need
of words to illustrate further his attitude.</p>

<p>He seemed to be a person of authority. An Arab town or village
is a democracy in which each free man has his say; not even a
sheik can overrule the vote of a majority, and this man was no
sheik. But rage and self-assertion will generally exercise a
certain weight in tribal councils, and the crowd in this case was
too doubtful of the facts to have any settled notions of its
own.</p>

<p>"To the jail with them!" the new arrival almost shrieked, and
about a dozen in the crowd took up the cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"To jail with them!"</p>

<p>"Infidels! Worshipers of dogs! Wine-drinkers! Eaters of pig
flesh! Dogs and the sons of dogs&mdash;what mothers gave them
birth? Are your hands, True-believers, fit bonds for them? To the
jail! To the jail that Abdul Hamid caused his men to build for
such as these!"</p>

<p>He stooped and looked deliberately to make sure that Crothers
could not break away, then came closer and spat on him, saving
half his spittle with impartial forethought for the struggling
Byng, who looked up in time to see what was in store for him.
Being spat on is even less exhilarating than it sounds or looks,
and Byng waxed speechless after passing through a many-worded
stage of blasphemy.</p>

<p>Crothers, the larger of the two and by six brawny inches more
phlegmatic, bode his time in silence, so that neither of them
spoke a word while they were hustled and cuffed along the street
between the unbaked brick hovels. It was not until the reinforced
iron door of Adra's one stone building slammed on them that
either of them said a word.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm not a mean man," protested Crothers.</p>

<p>"No?" said Byng, monosyllabic for a start.</p>

<p>"No," repeated Crothers, "I am not, Joe Byng. But&mdash;and
I says it solemn; I says it with one 'and above my 'ed, and I'd
take my affidavy on it in a court o' law, if it's the last word I
ever does say an' it's my dying oath&mdash;so 'elp me Solomon
and all 'is glory; I'm a Dutchman if I wouldn't like to 'ave a
come-back at that Arab."</p>

<p>Byng lay full length on his stomach, and buried his face in
his arms. He was still too full of wrath for words.</p>

<p>"I'd kick his mother, if I couldn't land on him," mused
Crothers. And then he busied himself about conning his new
bearings. It was a four-walled jail&mdash;one-doored,
one-windowed, iron-barred&mdash;ill-smelling, verminous, too
hot for words and too suggestive of the opposite of home, sweet
home to call forth humor, even from a seaman.</p>

<p>"They'll come an' rescue us," moaned Byng. "They'll quarantine
the pair of us for being lousy, and they'll turn the perishing
salt-water hose on us. We're due for the brig for Gawd knows 'ow
long; our reppitation's gone; we've been spat on by a&mdash;by
a Arab, and we 'aven't hit 'im back; an' we've lost the pup.
We've gone an' lost the pup! Gawd! There ain't no more good in
nothin'!"</p>

<p>Which shows no more than that Joe Byng in his sorrow
overlooked a circumstance or two. For instance, there were rings
in the floor that Crothers eyed with keen curiosity. They were
anchored in the solid blocks of stone.</p>

<p>"It's better than it might be, mate!" he argued
optimistically. "They might 'ave gone and chained us up to
those!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="first">
ARABIA has some peculiarities, not all of them discreditable,
which she does not share with any other country. There is, for
instance, the kind custom that dictates the setting free of
slaves when they have rendered seven years' good service.</p>

<p>That rule (and it is rather rule than law) tends to eliminate
all class and color prejudice. Provided that a man will bow to
Mecca three times daily and refrain from pork and wine, he may
wear whatever skin God gave him and yet mingle with the best. He
may even marry whom he will and can afford; and he may be
whatever his ability, ambition, and audacity dictate.</p>

<p>And Hassan Ah had never been a slave, so he had even less to
overcome than might have been the case. He stalked Adra socially
uncondemned where once he had caught fish, groomed camels, and
done other irritating jobs. His old fish-catching days had given
him an intimate acquaintance with the reef, and his small-boat
seamanship, born of hard pulling in the trough of beam-on-seas,
was well suited to the local type of craft.</p>

<p>So nobody questioned his right to the title of harbor pilot.
And if certain perquisites went with an otherwise barren office,
that was to be expected. Who worked for nothing, or for the empty
honor of it, in Arabia?</p>

<p>Nobody can pass the reef at night in shallow-draft lateen-sail
boats without having him on board; and though he was never
ostensibly paid for his services, it was understood that he
performed pilot service in return for certain other opportunities
that sometimes came his way. When things happened on the high sea
that were not discussed in public, it was understood that Hassan
Ah could have discussed them as thoroughly as anybody if he
chose.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, and within limits that were only more or
less definable, he was something of a personality. Men listened
to him when he raised his voice in argument, and as one who could
grant favors on occasion his words had weight.</p>

<p>The sun was very nearly in its zenith, beating down on dry
Arabia between racing black clouds, when he had finished talking
to the local council in the ramshackle old council-house, skin
and mat curtained, that faced the sheik's where the main street
broadened for a hundred filthy yards into a market-place. All
through his argument he had held a pure-white bull terrier
between his knees as proof that he knew whereof he spoke.</p>

<p>"Can any of you hold him without being bitten?" he demanded.
And they did not seem to care to try.</p>

<p>"I know the ways of these men!" he asserted, drawing
extravagant expressions of contentment from the dog in proof of
it.</p>

<p>So the others in the stuffy council place gave the dog a wide
berth and no privilege, but conceded him the right to hold the
beast, if he wanted to, without personal defilement. And since
the way of the world is that a man who has won the first of his
contentions can win all the rest with half the ease, he persuaded
them with a hurricane of black man's rhetoric to do what Arabs
consider almost wicked.</p>

<p>Unbelievers who are prisoners should die, beyond all
question.</p>

<p>"As the dregs of oil shall the fruit of the tree of Al Zakkum
boil in the bellies of the damned!" the sheik quoted. "They
should be hurried, therefore, to the punishment that waits!"</p>

<p>But Hassen Ah outargued him.</p>

<p>"Then they will land men from the ship, who will search our
houses," he asserted. "Is there a majority in the council who
would like to be searched by unbelievers?"</p>

<p>"Then bind them, and take them to their ship, and tell a tale
of much drunkenness and wrong-doing. Ask an indemnity, and show
the proofs, which will be easy to arrange."</p>

<p>"They, too, will tell their tale!" said Hassan Ah in perfect
Arabic.</p>

<p>Unlike the more enlightened peoples of the West, Arabs do not
encourage the mutilation of their mother-tongue; they teach it as
carefully as they talk it, and this negro spoke like an Arab of
the blood.</p>

<p>"There are certain damages they have received&mdash;some
bruises on the face and tears in the clothing that does not
belong to them but their government," he continued. "They would
lay all the blame on us, and would breathe in the face of an
appointed man, in proof that they were not drunk. And who could
get other drink than coffee or water here? And who would believe
the rest of our story, having found that part to be a lie? There
would be a landing, and a search for proof, and much
unpleasantness. Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>If he had intended to add further arguments, the sheik saw fit
to nip them in the bud; for there were some men in the
council-room who did not know as much as Hassan Ah. Any free man
may speak in council in Arabia.</p>

<p>"What is thy way, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>The woolly headed pilot laughed aloud, taking care to make it
evident that he was laughing at the prisoners; to laugh at a
sheik or a sheik's bewilderment would be too dangerous.</p>

<p>"I would send them to the ship well satisfied," he
answered.</p>

<p>"With money?" asked the sheik.</p>

<p>"With whose money?" asked Hassan Ah.</p>

<p>"With thine?" shot back the sheik.</p>

<p>"In the name of Allah, no!"</p>

<p>The black man laughed again, and rose to lean against the wall
behind him, gathering the dog up in his arms.</p>

<p>"If it is the order of the council," he asserted, "I will send
them back satisfied, with a tale to tell that will bring about no
landing. Also, I will give the council much amusement."</p>

<p>"But will other sailors land afterward, seeking similar
amusement?" asked the sheik.</p>

<p>"No! There will be an order that none land!"</p>

<p>The sheik took a vote on it. Heads nodded solemnly all around
the room as his eyes sought each half-veiled face in turn. His
own face was almost altogether shielded by the brown linen
head-dress, for men of his race like to reach a judgment
unobserved. They were all nods that answered him, and he saw fit
to keep his own opinion to himself.</p>

<p>"Thou seest? These others are all with thee. Have it thine own
way, Hassan Ah. Unlock thou the riddle and on thy head be the
answer! Thou hast our leave to go."</p>

<p>So Hassan Ah set out undaunted for the jail, with a terrier in
tow behind him and a huge smile on his broad-beamed face. And
behind him a murmur rose that:</p>

<p>"It was well. He brought the warship in, instead of leaving it
outside or&mdash;as any wise man would have done&mdash;
wrecking it on the outer reef, where it could have been plundered
at discretion. Let him send the sailors back again and bear the
consequences!"</p>

<p>And within a minute of the pilot's arrival at the window of
the jail (through which he peered for two minutes before
speaking) the whole of Adra's council, followed by the city's
children in a noisy horde, proceeded in a cluster after him and
took up position, each as he saw fit, at different vantage
points.</p>

<p>Then Hassan Ah shook a loose bar of the window until it
rattled, and so called attention to himself. Crothers and Joe
Byng raced for the window neck and neck, and reached it
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"You two men want you-ah dog?" asked Hassan Ah, and the
chained dog leaped up at the window as both men swore at
once.</p>

<p>"You pass him in here! Come on, you black-faced cornerman!
There'll be a cutter's crew ashore pretty soon to rescue us, and
if you don't hand that dog over before they get here you'll get
the worst whipping you ever had in all your black life!"</p>

<p>"They'll feed you to the dog when they're through with you!"
vowed Byng.</p>

<p>"Come on, MacHassan!" ordered Crothers. "Get the key and pass
the dog in. That'll settle your account. T hen you's free. You
needn't be 'fraid."</p>

<p>"Ah'm English," said the pilot of the day before, with an
enormous grin that showed a pound or two of yellow ivory. "Ah'm
not afraid; Ah can lick you; Ah can fight same as you men. Ah'm
English!"</p>

<p>"Fight? You Irish Chink! Which of us two do you want to
fight?" asked the outraged Byng. "Come on in here! I'll fight
you!"</p>

<p>But to Byng's amazement Hassan Ah pointed to Crothers, who was
heavier by forty pounds or more and taller by at least half a
head.</p>

<p>"Ah choose him!" he grinned; and Curley Crothers clenched both
fists in absolute but quite unterrified amazement.</p>

<p>"Come on, then," he answered. "Open the door." Then, as an
afterthought&mdash;"I'll fight you for the dog."</p>

<p>"Ah don't want to kill that little man," said Hassan Ah. "But
Ah'll give you the dog, win or lose, if you'll fight me. You
fight fair? You fight English?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" said Crothers. "I fight Queensberry rules.
That suit you?"</p>

<p>"Oh-ah, yes! Keensby rules, that's it. All right-o!"</p>

<p>Hassan Ah produced his key and turned it in the creaking lock.
He was stripping himself even before the two sailors were out in
the sun, and by the time that Crothers and Joe Byng had realized
that there was an audience of something like a thousand,
including children, he was standing posed like a gladiator, with
the straight-down tropic sun streaming off his ebony hide. As
Crothers, not quite sure even yet that the whole affair was not a
joke, began to doff his blouse it dawned on him that if the thing
were true it would not be a picnic.</p>

<p>"Do you mean this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah shohly do. Are you afraid o' me?"</p>

<p>That, of course, settled matters. The thing was not a joke,
and Englishman or nigger&mdash;black, green, white, or gray
&mdash;the plot must be licked forthwith and in accordance with
the rules.</p>

<p>Crothers spat into his hands, while Joe Byng folded up his
blouse and knelt on it. He eyed his antagonist for at least a
minute, summing him up and ignoring none of the woolly-headed
one's physical advantages in weight and strength, in height and
reach, in being used to the climate and the glare, the odds were
all with Hassan Ah. Then he sized up the moral odds; and though a
biased audience might be at first supposed to weigh against him
too, the sight of all those Arabs waiting to see him beaten
roused his fighting dander.</p>

<p>"Do you represent the bloke that spat on us two men?" asked
Crothers.</p>

<p>"Ah represent maself! Ah'm English! Ah fight English, and
Ah'll prove it!"</p>

<p>"Aw, wade into him!" advised Joe Byng. "London Prize Rules
&mdash;no time called until a man's down. Go on, Curley&mdash;
lead!"</p>

<p>"Do you agree?" asked Crothers.</p>

<p>"Suttainly!" The black man seemed disposed to agree to
anything so long as he could get what he was after.</p>

<p>"Then here goes!" said Crothers; and he stepped in and led for
the honor of the British Navy.</p>

<p>Oh! It was a fight! Crothers knew what he was up against the
instant that his left fist slid along an ebony forearm and his
nose collided with what seemed like an iron club. Steamship pilot
this man might not be, but fighting man he very surely was. He
hit straight and guarded high. He was no untutored savage. He had
the hardest to acquire of all the Christian arts at his fingers'
(or rather his fists') ends, and the heavyweight champion of
Gosport took a double reef in his fighting tactics while he
sparred for time in which to recover from the shock of that first
blow. The claret was streaming down his face and he was
dizzy.</p>

<p>"Oh, wade into him, mate!" urged Joe.</p>

<p>It is always easier to see what should be done than to do it.
The sand was not slipping and giving under Joe Byng's feet, nor
were his fists and wrists aching from contact with hard ebony. To
him the thing seemed easy, and he was as anxious to get into the
fight himself as was the terrier that strained at his chain. But
Crothers, who had won a hundred fights at least in cleaner
climes, fought canny and tried to make the black man tire himself
with wasted effort.</p>

<p>And the Arabs sat in silence, like a row of vultures waiting
for the end. Even the little children held their clamor and
subsided into motionless calm. There was not a movement along the
roofs or the wall, or in the rings of those who squatted. Arabia
was spellbound, watching something she had never seen before and
trying to puzzle out the wherefore of it. There were knives and
guns available, yet these men fought without weapons. The white
contender had a friend, but the friend did not join in. Why? Had
Allah struck all three men mad? They sat still to see the end,
having no doubt but that it would prove to be a judgment.</p>

<p>Curley Crothers was the first to close a round. He put an end
to round one at the end of three minutes by missing with a heavy
right swing, ducking to avoid terrific punishment, slipping in
the yielding sand and falling.</p>

<p>"Back with you!" yelled Joe Byng, afraid that the pilot would
take liberties and ready to jump in and stop him if need be. But
he wasted his excitement.</p>

<p>"Ah told you Ah'm English!" said the pilot, stepping back and
letting Crothers find his corner.</p>

<p>Curley was glad enough of a rest on Joe Byng's knee, and too
intent on getting back his wind to listen over carefully to Joe's
advice. When Joe called "Time" he stepped in readily again; and
this time it was Hassan Ah who suffered from surprise.</p>

<p>Curley had been getting out of practise on board ship; he had
needed waking up, and round one had done it for him. Round two
and the six that followed it were exhibitions of the "noble art"
that men in any of the larger cities of the world would have paid
out a fortune to have seen.</p>

<p>There was racial prejudice, and service pride, as well as the
usual decent man's desire to win to make a real mill of what
might have been nothing out of ordinary; and there were the quite
considerable odds against him that&mdash;after the first
repulse&mdash;usually make men like Crothers do their
utmost.</p>

<p>Even the Arabs lost their stoicism while round two was under
way. Byng yelled, and the terrier yelped, but the Arabs only
shifted their position. That, though, was proof enough of their
excitement; they actually sighed in unison when Hassan Ah thrust
his ungainly chin in the way of a crushing right-hand smash, and
laid his broad back on the sand.</p>

<p>After that it was slug-and-come-again with both of them, each
getting wilder as round succeeded round, but neither man
obtaining much advantage. Twice it was Crothers who went down;
then he discovered a soft spot in Hassan's ribs, and after that
he kept the black man busy on the desperate defensive.</p>

<p>There was no doubt of the end, then, barring accidents. Even
Hassan Ah could not have doubted it; but he did his black man's
uttermost to put it off, and he fought as gamely as anybody ever
fought since prize-ring rules were drafted. He did not foul, or
take undue advantage once.</p>

<p>It was a plain, right-handed, battering-ram punch to the neck
that ended things, and Hassan Ah lay coughing on the sand with
bulging eyes while Joe Byng tended Curley's hurts.</p>

<p>"Hasn't the nigger got any pals?" asked Crothers; and then it
occurred to Byng that the most hurt man was surely most in need
of mending. Both he and Crothers bent over him, then, and they
soon had him on his feet again.</p>

<p>"Ah told you Ah'm English!" were the first words he succeeded
in spluttering through swollen lips.</p>

<p>"Now, what d'you mean by that exactly?" asked Joe Byng, his
attitude toward him almost entirely changed. A man who loses
gamely is entitled to respect if not to friendship.</p>

<p>Hassan Ah searched in the tattered shirt that he had laid
aside, and pulled out a folded piece of paper after a lot of
fumbling. He opened it gingerly, and holding one corner of it
displayed the rest with evident intention not to allow it out of
his grasp.</p>

<p>"That says Ah'm English!" he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Crothers, rubbing an injured eye in order to see it
better. "Can you read, you black heathen?"</p>

<p>"No," said the pilot. "That says Ah'm English, but Ah can't
read!"</p>

<p>"Well, MacHassan," said Curley Crothers, reading the document
a second time. "Black or white, you fight like a gentleman. I'm
proud to have licked you. Good-by, and good luck! Here's my
hand!"</p>

<p>They shook hands, and the seamen started shoreward with the
terrier in tow.</p>

<p>"Did you read the paper?" asked Crothers. "It was dated Aden
&mdash;non-coms' mess of some regiment or other. 'This is to
certify that this regiment taught Hassan Ah to use his fists, and
that he has since licked every single mother's son of us!' Pity I
didn't see that first, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno," said Joe Byng, who had not had to do the
fighting. "You licked the savage, anyway."</p>

<p>Hassan Ah was right. There was no more shore leave granted.
Crothers and Joe Byng were punished with extra duty and "confined
to ship" for coming back with the marks of fighting on them; and
the Puncher gave no further signs of life until, some three I
days later, her long-suffering engines turned again and she
departed through the channel that had brought her in.</p>

<p>Then the sheik and three others and a certain Hassan Ah went
down at midnight to the jail and lifted with the aid of long
poles passed through the rings in them the largest floor stones
of that vermin-infested building. But the vermin did not trouble
them. What they were after and what they lifted out was the cases
of guns and cartridges the Puncher had contrived to miss.</p>
