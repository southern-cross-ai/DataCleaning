  <h2><a name="part1"

  <h3>BY W. ROBERTSON NICOLL</h3>

  <p class="first">AS the years pass they disengage the virtue of a writer, and
  decide whether or not he has force enough to live. Will Stevenson live?
  Undoubtedly. He is far more secure of immortality than many very popular
  writers. The sale of his books may not be great, and he may even disappear
  from the marts of literature now and then, but he will always be revived, and
  it may turn out that his reputation may wear as well as that of Charles Lamb.
  For he engages his readers by the double gift of personality and style. The
  personality of Stevenson is strangely arresting. In the first place it was a
  double personality. In his journey to the Cevennes he reflects that every one
  of us travels about with a donkey. In his "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
  Hyde," the donkey becomes a devil. Every Jekyll is haunted by his Hyde.
  Somebody said that "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" showed
  Stevenson as Poe, with the addition of a moral sense. Critics may differ as
  to the exact literary value of the famous little book, but as an expression
  of Stevenson's deepest thought about life it will retain its interest.</p>

  <p><a id="pic03"
     name="pic03"></a></p><br>
  <img src="1300231h-images/Stevenson-03.jpg"

  <p>He was not content to dwell in a world where the lines are drawn clear,
  where the sheep are separated from the goats. He would have a foot in both
  worlds, content to dwell neither wholly with the sheep nor wholly with the
  goats. No doubt his ruling interest was in ethical problems, and he could be
  stern in his moral judgments, as, for example, in his discussion of the
  character of Burns. He was by nature and training religious, "something of
  the Shorter Catechist." His earliest publication was a defence of the
  Covenanters, and in his last days he established close friendships with the
  Samoan missionaries. Yet he was by no means "orthodox," either in ethics or
  in religion. Much as he wrote on conduct, there were certain subjects, and
  these the most difficult, on which he never spoke out. On love, for example,
  and all that goes with it, it is quite certain that he never spoke his full
  mind&mdash;to the public at least. Another very striking quality in his
  personality was his fortitude. He was simply the bravest of men. Now and
  then, as in his letter to George Meredith, he lets us see under what
  disabling conditions he fought his battle. Human beings in a world like this
  are naturally drawn to one who suffers, and will not let himself be mastered
  or corrupted by suffering. They do not care for the prosperous, dominant,
  athletic, rich and long-lived man. They may conjecture, indeed, that behind
  all the bravery there is much hidden pain, but if it is not revealed to them
  they cannot be sure.</p>

  <p>They love Charles Lamb for the manner in which he went through his trial,
  and they love him none the less because he was sometimes overborne, because
  on occasions he stumbled and fell. Charlotte Brontë was an example of
  fortitude as remarkable as Stevenson, but she was not brave after the same
  manner. She allowed the clouds to thicken over her life and make it grey.
  Stevenson sometimes found himself in the dust, but he recovered and rose up
  to speak fresh words of cheer. He took thankfully and eagerly whatever life
  had to offer him in the way of affection, of kindness, of admiration. Nor did
  he ever in any trouble lose his belief that the Heart of things was kind. In
  the face of all obstacle he went steadily on with his work, nor did he ever
  allow himself to fall below the best that he could do. An example so
  touching, so rare, so admirable, is a reinforcement which weary humanity
  cannot spare. With these qualities, and, indeed, as their natural result,
  Stevenson had a rare courtesy. He was, in the words of the old Hebrew song,
  "lovely and pleasant," or rather, as Robertson Smith translated it, "lovely
  and winsome," in all his bearings to men of all kinds, so long as they did
  not fall under the condemnation of his moral judgment. With a personality so
  rich, Stevenson had the power of communicating himself. He could reveal his
  personality without egotism, without offence. Many writers of charming
  individuality cannot show themselves in their books. There is as little of
  themselves in their novels as there would be in a treatise on mathematics, if
  they could write it. Perhaps less. There have been mathematicians like
  Augustus de Morgan, who could put humour and personality into a book on
  geometry.</p>

  <p>But Stevenson had not only a personality, he had a style. His golden gift
  of words can never be denied. He may sometimes have been too "precious," but
  the power of writing as he could write is so uncommon that he must always
  stand with a very few.<br></p>

  <p>We believe that Stevenson's style is largely an expression of his
  courtesy. He wished as a matter of mere politeness and goodwill to express
  himself as well as he could. In fact, it was this courtesy that led him to
  his famous paradox about the end of art, his characterisation of the artist
  as the Son of Joy. "The French have a romantic evasion for one employment,
  and call its practitioners the Daughters of Joy. The artist is of the same
  family; he is of the Sons of Joy, chooses his trade to please himself, gains
  his livelihood by pleasing others, and has parted with something of the
  sterner dignity of man."</p>

  <p>The theory that all art is decoration cannot be seriously considered. It
  was certainly not true of Stevenson's art. He wished to please, but he had
  other and higher ends. He had to satisfy his exacting conscience, and he
  obeyed its demands sincerely and righteously, and to the utmost of his power.
  But he was too good a man to be satisfied even with that.</p>

  <p>Milton put into all his work the most passionate labour, but he did not
  believe that pleasure was the end of art. Nor would he have been satisfied by
  complying with his conscience. He had a message to deliver, and he delivered
  it in the most effective forms at his command. Stevenson had his message,
  too, and uttered it right memorably.</p>

  <p>If the message had to be put in a few words, they would be these: <i>Good
  my soul, be brave!</i> He was bold enough to call Tennyson a Son of Joy, but
  he would have assented with all his soul to Tennyson's lines:</p>

  <p class="verse">And here the singer for his art<br>
  Not all in vain may plead;<br>

  <h2><a name="part2"
     id="part2"></a>THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</h2>

  <h3>BY G. K. CHESTERTON</h3>

  <p>All things and all men are underrated, much by others, especially by
  themselves; and men grow tired of men just as they do of green grass, so that
  they have to seek for green carnations. All great men possess in themselves
  the qualities which will certainly lay them open to censure and diminishment;
  but these inevitable deficiencies in the greatness of great men vary in the
  widest degree of variety. Stevenson is open to a particularly subtle, a
  particularly effective and a particularly unjust disparagement.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"
     name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300231h-images/Stevenson-12.jpg"

  </div><br>

  <p>The advantage of great men like Blake or Browning or Walt Whitman is that
  they did not observe the niceties of technical literature. The far greater
  disadvantage of Stevenson is that he did. Because he had a conscience about
  small matters in art, he is conceived not to have had an imagination about
  big ones. It is assumed by some that he must have been a bad architect, and
  the only reason that they can assign is that he was a good workman.</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"
     name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>
  <img src="1300231h-images/Stevenson-13.jpg"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The mistake which has given rise to this conception is one that has much
  to answer for in numerous departments of modern art, literature, religion,
  philosophy, and politics. The supreme and splendid characteristic of
  Stevenson, was his levity; and his levity was the flower of a hundred grave
  philosophies. The strong man is always light: the weak man is always heavy. A
  swift and casual agility is the mark of bodily strength: a humane levity is
  the mark of spiritual strength. A thoroughly strong man swinging a
  sledge-hammer can tap the top of an eggshell. A weaker man swinging a
  sledge-hammer will break the table on which it stands into pieces. Also, if
  he is a very weak man, he will be proud of having broken the table, and call
  himself a strong man dowered with the destructive power of an Imperial
  race.</p>

  <p>This is, superficially speaking, the peculiar interest of Stevenson. He
  had what may be called a perfect mental athleticism, which enabled him to
  leap from crag to crag, and to trust himself anywhere and upon any question.
  His splendid quality as an essayist and controversialist was that he could
  always recover his weapon.</p>

  <p>He was not like the average swashbuckler of the
  current parties, tugged at the tail of his own sword. This is what tends, for
  example, to make him stand out so well beside his unhappy friend Mr. Henley,
  whose true and unquestionable affection has lately taken so bitter and
  feminine a form. Mr. Henley, an admirable poet and critic, is, nevertheless,
  the man <i>par excellence</i> who breaks the table instead of tapping the
  egg. In his recent article on Stevenson he entirely misses this peculiar and
  supreme point about his subject.</p>

  <p>He there indulged in a very emotional remonstrance against the reverence
  almost universally paid to the physical misfortunes of his celebrated friend.
  "If Stevenson was a stricken man," he said, "are we not all stricken men?"
  And he proceeded to call up the images of the poor and sick, and of their
  stoicism under their misfortunes. If sentimentalism be definable as the
  permitting of an emotional movement to cloud a clear intellectual
  distinction, this most assuredly is sentimentalism, for it would be
  impossible more completely to misunderstand the real nature of the cult of
  the courage of Stevenson. The reason that Stevenson has been selected out of
  the whole of suffering humanity as the type of this more modern and occult
  martyrdom is a very simple one.</p>

  <p>It is not that he merely contrived, like any other man of reasonable
  manliness, to support pain and limitation without whimpering or committing
  suicide or taking to drink. In that sense of course we are all stricken men
  and we are all stoics. The ground of Stevenson's particular fascination in
  this matter was that he was the exponent, and the successful exponent, not
  merely of negative manliness, but of a positive and lyric gaiety.</p>

  <p>This wounded soldier did not merely refrain from groans, he gave forth
  instead a war song, so juvenile and inspiriting that thousands of men without
  a scratch went back into the battle. This cripple did not merely bear his own
  burdens, but those of thousands of contemporary men. No one can feel anything
  but the most inexpressible kind of reverence for the patience of the
  asthmatic charwoman or the consumptive tailor's assistant. Still the

  <p>Their stoicism is magnificent, but it is stoicism. But Stevenson did not
  face his troubles as a stoic, he faced them as an Epicurean. He practised
  with an austere triumph that terrible asceticism of frivolity which is so
  much more difficult than the asceticism of gloom. His resignation can only be
  called an active and uproarious resignation. It was not merely
  self-sufficing, it was infectious. His triumph was, not that he went through
  his misfortunes without becoming a cynic or a poltroon, but that he went
  through his misfortunes and emerged quite exceptionally cheerful and
  reasonable and courteous, quite exceptionally light-hearted and
  liberal-minded. His triumph was, in other words, that he went through his
  misfortunes and did not become like Mr. Henley.</p>

  <p>There is one aspect of this matter in particular, which it is as well to
  put somewhat more clearly before ourselves. This triumph of Stevenson's over
  his physical disadvantages is commonly spoken of with reference only to the
  elements of joy and faith, and what may be called the new and essential
  virtue of cosmic courage. But as a matter of fact the peculiarly interesting
  detachment of Stevenson from his own body, is exhibited in a quite equally
  striking way in its purely intellectual aspect.</p>

  <p>Apart from any moral qualities, Stevenson was characterised by a certain

  <p>The faith of Stevenson, like that of a great number of very sane men, was
  founded on what is called a paradox&mdash;the paradox that existence was
  splendid because it was, to all outward appearance, desperate. Paradox, so
  far from being a modern and fanciful matter, is inherent in all the great
  hypotheses of humanity. The Athanasian Creed, for example, the supreme
  testimony of Catholic Christianity, sparkles with paradox like a modern
  society comedy. Thus, in the same manner, scientific philosophy tells us that
  finite space is unthinkable and infinite space is unthinkable. Thus the most
  influential modern metaphysician, Hegel, declares without hesitation, when
  the last rag of theology is abandoned, and the last point of philosophy
  passed, that existence is the same as non-existence.</p>

  <p>We must not, therefore, be immediately repelled by this paradoxical
  character of Stevenson's optimism, or imagine for a moment that it was merely
  a part of that artistic foppery or "fuddling hedonism" with which he has been
  ridiculously credited. His optimism was one which, so far from dwelling upon
  those flowers and sunbeams which form the stock-in-trade of conventional
  optimism, took a peculiar pleasure in the contemplation of skulls, and
  cudgels, and gallows.</p>

  <p>He justified it because it was a battle, because it was an inspiring and
  melodious discord. He appealed to a certain set of facts which lie far deeper
  than any logic&mdash;the great paradoxes of the soul. For the singular fact
  is that the spirit of man is in reality depressed by all the things which,
  logically speaking, should encourage it, and encouraged by all the things
  which, logically speaking, should depress it.</p>

  <p>Nothing, for example, can be conceived more really dispiriting than that

  <p>Stevenson's great ethical and philosophical value lies in the fact that he
  realised this great paradox that life becomes more fascinating the darker it
  grows, that life is worth living only so far as it is difficult to live. The
  more steadfastly and gloomily men clung to their sinister visions of duty,
  the more, in his eyes, they swelled the chorus of the praise of things. He
  was an optimist because to him everything was heroic, and nothing more heroic
  than the pessimist.</p>

  <p>To Stevenson, the optimist, belong the most frightful epigrams of
  pessimism. It was he who said that this planet on which we live was more
  drenched with blood, animal and vegetable, than a pirate ship. It was he who
  said that man was a disease of the agglutinated dust. And his supreme
  position and his supreme difference from all common optimists is merely this,
  that all common optimists say that life is glorious in spite of these things,
  but he said that all life was glorious because of them. He discovered that a
  battle is more comforting than a truce. He discovered the same great fact
  which was discovered by a man so fantastically different from him that the
  mere name of him may raise a legitimate laugh&mdash;General Booth.</p>

    <p>Men of the most widely divergent types are connected by these invisible
    cords across the world, and Stevenson was essentially a Colonel in the
    Salvation Army. He believed, that is to say, in making religion a military
    affair. His militarism, of course, needs to be carefully understood. It was
    considered entirely from the point of view of the person righting.</p>

    <p>It had none of that evil pleasure in contemplating the killed and
    wounded, in realising the agonies of the vanquished, which has been turned
    by some modern writers into an art, a literary sin, which, though only
    painted in black ink on white paper, is far worse than the mere sin of
    murder. Stevenson's militarism was as free from all the mere poetry of
    conquest and dominion as the militarism of an actual common soldier. It was
    mainly, that is to say, a poetry of watches and parades and camp-fires. He
    knew he was in the hosts of the Lord: he did not trouble much about the
    enemy. Here is his resemblance to that Church Militant, which, secure only
    in its own rectitude, wages war upon the nameless thing which has tormented
    and bewildered us from the beginning of the world.</p>

    <p>Of course, this Stevensonian view of war suggests in itself that other
    question, touching which so much has been written about him, the subject of
    childishness and the child. It is true, of course, that the splendidly
    infantile character of Stevenson's mind saved him from any evil arising
    from his militarism. A child can hit his nurse hard with a wooden sword
    without being an aesthete of violence. He may enjoy a hard whack, but he
    need not enjoy the colour harmonies of black and blue as they are presented
    in a bruise. It is undoubtedly the truth, of course, that Stevenson's
    interest in this fighting side of human nature was mainly childish, that is
    to say, mainly subjective.</p>

    Stevenson, even the terms which have been most definitely attached to him
    tend to become misleading and inadequate, and the terms "childlike" or
    "childish," true as they are down to a very fundamental truth, are yet the
    origin of a certain confusion. One of the greatest errors in existing

    <p>Many great moral teachers, beginning with Jesus Christ, have perceived
    the profound philosophical importance of the child. The child sees
    everything freshly and fully; as we advance in life it is true that we see
    things in some degree less and less, that we are afflicted, spiritually and
    morally, with the myopia of the student. But the problem of the boy is
    essentially different from that of the child.</p>

    <p>The boy represents the earliest growth of the earthly, unmanageable
    qualities, poetic still, but not so simple or so universal. The child
    enjoys the plain picture of the world: the boy wants the secret, the end of
    the story. The child wishes to dance in the sun; but the boy wishes to sail
    after buried treasure. The child enjoys a flower, and the boy a mechanical
    engine. And the finest and most peculiar work of Stevenson is rather that
    he was the first writer to treat seriously and poetically the aesthetic
    instincts of the boy.</p>

    his rattle there has gathered a splendid service of literature and art;
    Hans Andersen and Charles Kingsley and George Macdonald and Walter Crane
    and Kate Greenaway and a list of celebrities a mile long bring their
    splendid gifts to the christening. But the tragedy of the helpless infant
    (if it be a male infant&mdash;girls are quite a different matter) is simply
    this, that, having been fed on literature and art, as fine in its way as
    Shelley and Turner up to the age of seven, he feels within him new impulses
    and interests growing, a hunger for action and knowledge, for fighting and
    discovery, for the witchery of facts and the wild poetry of geography. And
    then he is suddenly dropped with a crash out of literature, and can read
    nothing but "Jack Valiant among the Indians." For in the whole scene there
    is only one book which is at once literature, like Hans Andersen, and yet a
    book for boys and not for children, and its name is "Treasure Island."</p>

       name="bn1"></a> <b>The Rev. Lewis Balfour, grandfather of Robert Louis
       Stevenson</b></p>

    <p class="note">In "Memories and Portraits" Stevenson described his
    grandfather, the Rev. Lewis Balfour, Minister of Colinton, as "of singular
    simplicity of nature; unemotional, and hating the display of what he felt;
    standing contented on the old ways; a lover of his life and innocent habits
    to the end." "Now I often wonder," he added later, "what I have inherited
    from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of
    preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that
    either of us loved to hear them."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn2"
       name="bn2"></a> <b>The birthplace of Robert Louis Stevenson/ No. 17,
       Heriot Row, Edinburgh</b></p>

    <p class="note">Robert Louis Stevenson, only son of Thomas Stevenson, Civil
    Engineer, was born on November 13th, 1850, at No. 8, Howard Place,
    Edinburgh. The house was one of a row of unpretentious stone buildings,
    situated just north of the water of Leith. When Louis reached the age of
    two-and-a-half, a removal was made to a more commodious dwelling in
    Inverleith Terrace; but this proving unsuitable to the child's delicate
    health, the family settled at No. 17, Heriot Row, which continued to be
    their Edinburgh home for thirty years.</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn3"
       name="bn3"></a> <b>Thomas Stevenson, father of Robert Louis
       Stevenson</b></p>

    <p class="note">Of his father, Stevenson wrote also in "Memories and
    Portraits." "He was a man of a somewhat antique strain; with a blended
    sternness and softness that was wholly Scottish, and at first somewhat
    bewildering; with a profound essential melancholy of disposition, and (what
    often accompanies it) the most humorous geniality in company; shrewd and
    childish; passionately attached, passionately prejudiced; a man of many
    extremes, many faults of temper, and no very stable foothold for himself
    among life's troubles."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn4"
       name="bn4"></a> <b>At the age of six/Other early photographs</b></p>

    <p class="note">In his nurse's possession there remains a treasured album
    containing a series of photographs of Robert Louis Stevenson, dating from
    babyhood onwards: the first, as an infant on his mother's knee; the second,
    at the age of twenty months; and again, at four years old, with bright,
    dark eyes, wide apart, and stiff curls framing his face. In the next, taken
    at the age of six, his hair is cropped to a manlike shortness. His hands
    have lost their baby podginess, and are nervous, long-fingered. He has a
    whip in his grasp, which falls slackly down, as if toys were not in his
    line, and he looks pensively ahead. A few years later he was photographed
    with his father, on whose shoulder one hand is resting, the other being
    tucked, boyishly, into his pocket. "Stevenson calls himself 'ugly' in his
    student days," writes Mr. Baildon; "but I think this is a term that never
    at any time fitted him. Certainly to him as a boy about fourteen (with the
    creed which he propounded to me, that at sixteen one was a man) it would
    not apply. In body Stevenson was assuredly badly set up. His limbs were
    long and lean and spidery, and his chest flat, so as almost to suggest some
    malnutrition, such sharp angles and corners did his joints make under his
    clothes. But in his face this was belied. His brow was oval and full, over
    soft brown eyes, that seemed already to have drunk the sunlight under
    southern vines. The whole face had a tendency to an oval Madonna-like type.
    But about the mouth and in the mirthful, mocking light of the eyes, there
    lingered ever a ready Autolyens roguery, that rather suggested the sly god
    Hermes masquerading as a mortal. The eyes were always genial, however gaily
    the lights danced in them; but about the mouth there was something a little
    tricksy and mocking, as of a spirit that already peeped behind the scenes
    of life's pageant and more than guessed its unrealities."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn5"
       name="bn5"></a> <b>Colinton Manse</b></p>

    <p class="note">But it was at Colinton that Stevenson passed the happiest
    days of his childhood. "Out of my reminiscences of life in that dear place,
    all the morbid and painful elements have disappeared," he wrote; "I can
    recall nothing but sunshiny weather. That was my golden age: <i>et ego in
    Arcadia vixi</i>." In "Memories and Portraits" he drew a vivid picture of
    the Manse. "It was a place at that time like no other; the garden cut into
    provinces by a great hedge of beech, and overlooked by the church and the
    terrace of the churchyard, where the tombstones were thick, and after
    nightfall 'spunkies' might be seen to dance, at least by children;
    flowerpots lying warm in sunshine; laurels and the great yew making
    elsewhere a pleasing horror of shade; the smell of water rising from all
    round, with an added tang of paper-mills; the sound of water everywhere,
    and the sound of mills&mdash;the wheel and the dam singing their alternate
    strain; the birds from every bush and from every corner of the overhanging
    woods pealing out their notes till the air throbbed with them; and in the
    midst of all this the Manse."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn6"
       name="bn6"></a> <b>Swanston Cottage</b></p>

    <p class="note">Two other houses were closely connected with the pleasant
    memories of Stevenson's youth&mdash;Swanston Cottage, the country residence
    of his parents, and Colinton Manse, the abode of his maternal grandfather.
    The situation and history of the former he described in "Picturesque Notes
    on Edinburgh," indeed, the cottage and its garden have been immortalised by
    Stevenson, both in prose and in verse, "Upon the main slope of the
    Pentlands...a bouquet of old trees stands round a white farmhouse, and from
    a neighbouring dell you can see smoke rising and leaves rustling in the
    breeze. Straight above, the hills climb a thousand feet into the air. The
    neighbourhood, about the time of lambs, is clamorous with the bleating of
    flocks; and you will be awakened in the grey of early summer mornings by
    the barking of a dog, or the voice of a shepherd shouting to the echoes.
    This, with the hamlet lying behind unseen, is Swanston."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn7"
       name="bn7"></a> <b>Stevenson's mother</b></p>

    <p class="note">There is no descriptive sketch of Stevenson's mother from
    his pen&mdash;a want probably accounted for by the fact that she survived
    him. In person she was tall and graceful; her vivacity and brightness were
    most attractive, and some idea of her undaunted energy and spirit may be
    gathered from Mr. Cope Cornford's "Robert Louis Stevenson," in which he
    says of Mrs. Thomas Stevenson, "At past sixty, after a lifetime of
    conventional Edinburgh, this lady broke up the house in Heriot Row, removed
    herself and her belongings to Apia, learned to ride bare-backed and to go
    bare-footed, and took on the life at Vailima and the life of Tusitala's
    native friends with equal gusto and intelligence. Stevenson was fond of
    calling himself a tramp and a gipsy, and that he could do so with justice
    was owing to the fact that his mother was Margaret Balfour."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn8"
       name="bn8"></a> <b>Robert Louis Stevenson in fancy dress</b></p>

    <p class="note">From the days of his toy theatre onwards, Robert Louis
    Stevenson had always taken an intense interest in matters theatrical, and,
    with another of his friends, Fleeming Jenkin, he took part in numerous
    amateur performances. The portrait in fancy dress was no doubt the outcome
    of this favourite pursuit.</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn9"
       name="bn9"></a> <b>Stevenson at the age of twenty</b></p>

    <p class="note">Three-and-a-half years were employed by Stevenson in
    preparation for the profession of civil engineer. He spent the winter and
    sometimes the summer sessions at the University of Edinburgh. In 1871,
    however, he informed his father of his inclination to follow literary
    pursuits. Engineering was given up forthwith, and it was arranged that he
    should study for the Scottish Bar, to which he was called in July
    1875.</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn10"
       name="bn10"></a> <b>Alison Cunningham ("Cummy")</b></p>

    <p class="note">Another important factor in his early life was the devotion
    of his nurse, Alison Cunningham, "Cummy," as he invariably called her,
    whose care during his ailing childhood did so much both to preserve his
    life and foster his love of tales and poetry, and of whom, until his death,
    he thought with the utmost constancy of affection. "My dear old nurse," he
    wrote to her, "&mdash;and you know there is nothing a man can say nearer
    his heart, except his mother or his wife&mdash;my dear old nurse, God will
    make good to you all the good that you have done, and mercifully forgive
    you all the evil."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn11"
       name="bn11"></a> <b>Robert Louis Stevenson at the age of
       twenty-five</b></p>

    <p class="note">In the photograph you have him "bewigged as Robert Louis
    Stevenson, Advocate, and there is the suspicion of a playful duplicity in
    the would-be wisdom-framed face."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn12"
       name="bn12"></a> <b>Robert Louis Stevenson in the "Barts" hat,
       1876</b></p>

    <p class="note">It was at this period that Stevenson came in close
    companionship with Sir Walter Simpson, "the Bart.," who was also studying
    Law. Sir Walter figured as "The Cigarette" to Stevenson's "Arethusa" in
    "The Inland Voyage."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn13"
       name="bn13"></a> <b>Chalet la Solitude, Hyères</b></p>

    <p class="note">In the hope of finding a climate suited to his health,
    Stevenson went abroad at the close of 1882, and settled for a time at
    Hyères, where, by the end of March 1883, he was established in a house of
    his own&mdash;the Chalet la Solitude. This was a picturesque cottage, built
    in the Swiss manner, on the slope of the hill just above the town, and
    here, for some eight or nine months, he enjoyed the happiest period of his
    life. "We all dwell together and make fortunes in the loveliest house you
    ever saw, with a garden like a fairy story, and a view like a classical
    landscape," he wrote. "Little? Well, it is not large. But it is Eden and
    Beulah and the Delectable Mountains and Eldorado and the Hesperidean Isles
    and Bimini."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn14"
       name="bn14"></a> <b>Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson</b></p>

    <p class="note">On his return with Sir Walter Simpson from the Inland
    Voyage, Stevenson became acquainted with Mrs. Osbourne, who was later to
    become his wife. The marriage took place in San Francisco in the spring of
    1880.</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn15"
       name="bn15"></a> <b>A photograph taken in America, 1887</b></p>

    <p class="note">Year after year the struggle against ill-health was
    increasing, and in 1887 Stevenson's uncle, Dr. George Balfour, insisted on
    a complete change of climate, and a second voyage to America was
    undertaken. In the following June began the South Sea cruises, which, after
    three years of wandering, culminated in the period of settled residence at
    Samoa.</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn16"
       name="bn16"></a> <b>Molokai, the terrible leper settlement</b></p>

    <p class="note">While in the South Seas, in 1889, Stevenson paid a visit to
    Molokai, the leper settlement in the Hawaiian Islands, which resulted in
    his famous "Letter to Dr. Hyde," in defence of Father Damian, who died a
    month previous to his arrival. "The place as regards scenery is grand,
    gloomy, and bleak," he wrote, describing the settlement. "Mighty mountain
    walls descending sheer along the whole face of the island into a sea
    unusually deep; the front of the mountain, ivied and furred with clinging
    forest, one viridescent cliff; about half way, from east to west, the low,
    bare, stony promontory edged in between the cliff and the ocean; the two
    little towns (Kalawao and Kalaupapa) seated on either side of it, as bare
    almost as bathing machines upon a beach; and the population gorgons and
    chimaeras dire."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn17"
       name="bn17"></a> <b>Stevenson's house at Vailima/ Dining- and reception
       hall at Vailima</b></p>

    <p class="note">About three miles inland, on the hills above Apia (the
    chief town of Upolu in the Samoan group), the Stevensons made their home in
    November 1890. The house itself was erected on a clearing of some three
    hundred acres, between two streams, from the westernmost of which the steep
    side of Vaea mountain, covered with forest, rose to a height of thirteen
    hundred feet above the sea. From this stream and its four tributaries the
    estate was called Vailima, the Samoan name for Five Waters. "This is a hard
    and interesting and beautiful life that we lead now," he wrote. "Our place
    is in a deep cleft of Vaea mountain, some six hundred feet above the sea,
    embowered in forest, which is our strangling enemy and which we combat with
    axes and dollars." The house was built of wood throughout, painted a dark
    green outside, with a red roof of corrugated iron. The building was finally
    enlarged in compatibility with the requirements of the family, and
    consisted, after December 1892, of three rooms, bath, storeroom, and
    cellars below, with five bedrooms and library upstairs. On the ground floor
    a verandah, twelve feet deep, ran in front of the whole house and along one
    side of it. The chief feature of the interior was the large hall. "My house
    is a great place," he added on another occasion; "we have a hall fifty feet
    long, with a great red-wood stair ascending from it, where we dine in
    state." The two posts of the big staircase were guarded by a couple of
    Burmese gilded idols.</p>

    <p class="note">Stevenson gave many glimpses of his life at Vailima in his
    letters to Mr. Sidney Colvin. The following extract seems typical:&mdash;"I
    know pleasure still; pleasure with a thousand faces and none perfect, a
    thousand tongues all broken, a thousand hands and all of them with
    scratching nails. High among these I place the delight of weeding out here
    alone by the garrulous water, under the silence of the high wood, broken by
    incongruous sounds of birds. And take my life all through, look at it fore
    and back and upside down&mdash;though I would very fain change
    myself&mdash;I would not change my circumstances."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn18"
       name="bn18"></a> <b>Stevenson and his favourite horse, "Jack"</b></p>

    <p class="note">His favourite exercise was riding, and he was an excellent
    horseman. "Jack," the New Zealand pony which he bought in 1890, carried him
    well. "I do not say my Jack is anything extraordinary, he is only an island
    horse, and the profane might call him a Punch, and his face is like a
    donkey's, and natives have ridden him and he has no mouth in consequence,
    and occasionally shies. But his merits are equally surprising, and I don't
    think I should ever have known Jack's merits if I had not been riding up of
    late on moonless nights."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn19"
       name="bn19"></a> <b>Tembinoka, the King of Apemama/Mataafa, the "Rebel"
       King</b></p>

    <p class="note">Stevenson's influence with the natives was probably as
    great as that of any white resident in the islands. He was certainly
    respected by them as a whole, and by many he was beloved. Indeed, his
    friendship with Tembinoka, the king of Apemama, whose character is
    described in "The South Seas," forms an important episode in that volume.
    "He is the Napoleon of the group, poet, tyrant, altogether a man of mark.
    'I got power,' is his favourite word; it interlards his conversation."
    Another chief, with whom Stevenson was in great sympathy, was Mataafa, the
    "rebel" king who was defeated and banished in August 1893, upon outbreak of
    war in the island. Mataafa he believed to be the one man of governing
    capacity among the native chiefs, and it was his desire that the Powers
    should conciliate rather than crush him. "Mataafa is the nearest thing to a
    hero in my history, and really a fine fellow; plenty of sense, and the most
    dignified, quiet, gentle manners."</p><br>

    <p class="note"><a id="bn20"
       name="bn20"></a> <b>H.M.S. <i>Curaçoa</i> at Apia, Samoa</b></p>

    <p class="note">During Stevenson's four years' residence in Samoa, no fewer
    than eight British men-of-war entered the harbour, and at the time of the
    bombardment of the rebels of Atua, H.M.S. <i>Curaçoa</i> was more often
    stationed at Apia than any of the others. "We have in port the model
    warship of Great Britain," he wrote, describing a cruise to Manùa: "she is
    called the <i>Curaçoa</i>...a ship that I would guarantee to go anywhere it
    was possible for men to go, and accomplish anything it was permitted man to
    attempt."</p><br>

       the opening of the "Ala Loto Alofa," Oct. 1894.</b></p>

    <p class="note">After taking up his abode at Vailima, Stevenson only twice
    returned to the world of populous cities. In the early part of 1893 he
    spent several weeks in Sydney, where he visited his friend, the Hon. H.H.
    Wise. In September of the same year be made a voyage to Honolulu. On his
    return to Apia in November, he was gratified by the mark of esteem and
    gratitude extended to him by the native chiefs, who cleared, dug, and
    completed the road to Vailima&mdash;till then a mere track, which could
    only be traversed in dry weather by wagons or by a buggy, goods being taken
    to the house by two New Zealand pack-horses. On the estate itself the route
    lay by a lane of limes, and this was cut off by the Ala Loto Alofa, or
    "Road of the Loving Heart," which the chiefs cut to commemorate Stevenson's
    kindness to them during their imprisonment by the European Powers.
    "Considering the great love of Tusitala, in his loving care of us in our
    distress in the prison, we have therefore prepared a splendid gift. It
    shall never he muddy, it shall endure for ever, this road that we have
    dug." Upon its completion a great Kava drinking was held, there was a
    solemn returning of thanks, and Stevenson gave an address, which was his
    best and most outspoken utterance to the people of Samoa.</p>

    <p class="note">Only two months later, on December 3rd, 1894, Stevenson
    died. He was in his forty-fifth year. The Union Jack which flew over the
    house was hauled down and placed over the body as it lay, in the hall where
    he had spent some of the most delightful hours of his life.</p><br>

    <p class="note">It was Stevenson's great delight to keep open house at
    Vailima, and especially to organise any festivity in which the natives
    could share. An example of this hospitality was the entertainment given to
    the band of the <i>Katoomba</i>, on September 12th, 1893. "I got leave from
    Captain Bickford to have the band of the <i>Katoomba</i> come up, and they
    came, fourteen of 'em, with drum, fife, cymbals and bugles, blue jackets,
    white caps, and smiling faces. The house was all decorated with scented
    greenery above and below. We had not only our nine outdoor workers, but a
    contract party that we took on in charity to pay their war-fine; the band
    besides, as it came up the mountain, had collected a following of children
    by the way, and we had a picking of Samoan ladies to receive them. They
    played to us, they danced, they sang, they tumbled."</p><br>

    <p class="note">On the tombstone, built of great blocks of cement, are
    carved the Scotch thistle and the native ante, and between them is a bronze
    plate bearing the following inscription, his own requiem:&mdash;</p><br>

    <p class="verse">"Under the wide and starry sky<br>

    Glad did I live and gladly die,<br>

    <p class="note">His devoted Samoans cut an almost perpendicular pathway to
    the top of the mountain Vaea, which he had designed as his last
    resting-place. Thither with almost herculean labours they bore him, and
    decked his grave with costly presents, of the most valuable and
    highly-prized mats. There he lies, by a strange, almost ironic fate, under
    other stars than ours. Driven forth, not, thank God, by neglect nor by any
    injustice of man, but by the scourge of sickness and threat of death and
    the unfriendliness of his native skies, into his beautiful exile amid
    tropic seas, he draws, and long will draw, perhaps while the language
    lasts, with a strange tenderness, the hearts of men to that far and lonely
    Samoan mount.</p><br>
