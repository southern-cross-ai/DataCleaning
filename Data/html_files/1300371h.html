  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">The advent of Tresholm, professional gamester,
     makes Monte Carlo buzz</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Dec 1928<br>
  Syndicated by The Metropolitan Newspaper Service, New York, 1929</h3>
  <br>

  <p class="first">AT a corner table in the restaurant of the Hotel de Paris,
  at Monte Carlo, four very distinguished local notabilities were enjoying a
  midday banquet.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Robert, the director of the hotel, was host, white-haired, but
  vigorous, with keen dark eyes.</p>

  <p>On his right sat Monsieur le General de St. Hilaire, from the barracks at
  Nice, a soldierly-looking person, with fierce gray mustaches, who wore his
  imposing row of ribbons with the air of one who has earned them.</p>

  <p>On the left of his host was Monsieur Desrolles, the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i>
  of Monaco, a man of mysteries, if ever there was one, tall, dark and
  hatchet-faced, severe of deportment, as befitted the custodian of many
  secrets. The fourth man at the table was Gustave Sordel, the leading spirit
  in the <i>Societé des Bains de Mer</i>, that vast organization responsible
  primarily for the gambling-rooms, and, in a minor degree, for such less
  important institutions as the Baths, the <i>Tir aux Pigeons</i>, the Café de
  Paris, and the golf-course.</p>

  <p>The conversation was of food and its glorious corollary, wine. Monsieur
  Robert was engaged in the pleasing task of making the mouths of his guests
  water.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he broke off with a frown. At his elbow stood Henri of the
  reception bureau, with a paper in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What is this, Henri?" he demanded. "Monsieur Grammont is in his office.
  You see that I lunch with friends? An occasion, this! Why am I
  disturbed?"</p>

  <p>Henri overweighted with apologies.</p>

  <p>"It is Monsieur Grammont who thought that you should see this, without
  delay," he confided. "It is a thing incomprehensible. One does not know
  whether to allot the room."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Robert produced a horn-rimmed eye-glass, and adjusted it. The
  allotment of the rooms is no concern of mine," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"You will permit a word of explanation, Monsieur," the young man begged
  eagerly. "From the Blue Train there arrived, a quarter of an hour ago, this
  gentleman, Monsieur Andrew Tresholm, an Englishman. He had engaged by
  correspondence a room looking over the gardens, with bath and small salon.
  Monsieur Grammont suggested Suite 39. I took him to it upon his arrival.</p>

  <p>"He was satisfied with the apartments and the price. All goes well, you
  perceive. I hand him the papers from the Bureau of Police, and invite him to
  sign them. He fills in his name&mdash;you see it there, His age, thirty-six.
  His place of birth, a county in England. He arrives at 'profession.a He
  leaves that blank. Monsieur Desrolles," the young man added, "will remember
  his recent injunction."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i> assented. "We wish in all cases to
  have this profession stated. There has been a certain slackness in this
  respect."</p>

  <p>Henri bowed his grateful acknowledgments across the table.</p>

  <p>"I desire to carry out the official request," he continued, "and I press
  Monsieur Tresholm to fill in the space. He protests mildly. I insist. He
  takes up the pen, hesitates. Then he smiles. He is of that type&mdash;he
  smiles to himself. Then he writes. Behold, Monsieur Robert, what he
  writes."</p>

  <p>The great man took the paper into his band and stared at though
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"'Occupation'," he read out, "'professional gambler'."</p>

  <p>"'Professional gambler'," Monsieur Robert repeated, reading from the
  paper.</p>

  <p>They all exchanged bewildered glances.</p>

  <p>"A joke perhaps?" the General suggested.</p>

  <p>The young man shook his bead.</p>

  <p>"This Monsieur Tresholm seemed perfectly serious," he declared. "I asked
  him if he were in earnest, and he replied, 'Certainly. . . It is, the only
  profession I have,' he assured me, 'and it keeps me fully occupied.' Those
  were his words. 'Am I to send this in to the police?' I asked him.
  'Certainly,' he assented. 'If they must know my profession, there it
  is'."</p>

  <p>"Here, perhaps, is the end of the world for us," said Monsieur Robert. "A
  professional gambler, mark you. He may know something. A defeating system may
  have arrived. Soon you may have to close your doors, Gustave, and I my
  hotel."</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"></a></p><br>

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Henri waited patiently. "What am I to do about the gentleman's room,
  Monsieur Robert?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Give it to him, by all means," was the prompt reply, "See that Madame
  Grand adorns it with flowers, that the servants, too, show this eccentric
  every attention Stop, though! His luggage!"</p>

  <p>"He has a greet deal of very superior quality," Henri confided. "There is
  also a motor-car of expensive make."</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma foi</i>! He makes it pay!" Monsieur Robert grunted. "But that is
  very good. Excellent!"</p>

  <p>Henri took his leave, and they all began to talk at once.</p>

  <p>"An imbecile without a doubt."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps a humorist."</p>

  <p>"Stop, stop, my friends!" Gustave Sordel begged. "There have been others
  who have arrived here with equal confidence. We have heard before&mdash;we of
  the Casino&mdash;of the invincible system. Our visitor may be very much in
  earnest. All I can say is, he is welcome."</p>

  <p>The young man from the reception bureau once more approached their
  table.</p>

  <p>"I thought it would interest you, sir," he announced, addressing his
  chief, "to see this gentleman. He has asked for a corner table for luncheon.
  He arrives now, in the doorway."</p>

  <p>They looked at him with very genuine curiosity. A well-built young; man,
  of a little over medium height, dressed in gray tweeds. His complexion was
  sunburnt his eyes blue, his features good, and there was a quizzical curve at
  the corners of his lips and faint lines by his eyes which might have denoted
  a humorous outlook.</p>

  <p>Gustave Sordel looked at his victim with the eyes of the shearer who has
  opened his gates to the sheep. "He is of the type," he derided. "They believe
  in themselves, these young Englishmen with systems. We shall see."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Robert grunted once more.</p>

  <p>"All very well, Gustave," he declared; "that man is no fool. Discoveries
  are being made now which have startled the world&mdash;things that were
  declared impossible. Why should it not have arrived at last&mdash;the perfect
  system?"</p>

  <p>"The gambler with inspiration," Sordel observed, "sometimes gives
  temporary inconvenience, but it is upon the world with systems that we
  thrive. I will drink to the health of this brave man."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Andrew Tresholm, an hour or so later, stood upon the steps
  of the hotel, looking out upon the gay little scene. A small boy, posted
  there for that purpose, rushed to the telephone to announce to the <i>chefs
  de partie</i> and officials of the Casino the impending arrival of this
  menace to their prosperity. There was a little stir in the hall, and everyone
  neglected his coffee to lean forward and stare. The Senegalese porter
  approached with a low bow and a smile.</p>

  <p>"The Casino, sir," he announced, pointing to the stucco building across
  the way.</p>

  <p>"I see it" was the somewhat surprised reply. "Darned ugly place, too!"</p>

  <p>The man, who spoke only French, let it go at that. Tresholm pointed to a
  quaint little building perched on the side of the mountain overhead.</p>

  <p>"What place is that?" he asked in French.</p>

  <p>"The Vistaero Restaurant, sir," the man replied. "The <i>Salles
  Priveés</i> have been open since two o'clock. The Sporting Club will be open
  at four."</p>

  <p>Tresholm showed no particular sign of interest in either announcement A
  moment later he descended the steps, and the four very prosperous-looking
  Frenchmen seated in the lounge rose to watch him.</p>

  <p>"The battle commences," Gustave Sordel exclaimed, with a chuckle. But
  apparently the battle was not going to commence, for Tresholm stepped into a
  very handsome two-seated car which a chauffeur had just brought round, took
  his place at the wheel, and, skirting the gardens, mounted the hill.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" Monsieur Robert joked. "Your victim escapes, Gustave."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary." was the complacent reply, "he mounts to the bank."</p>

  <p>In less than half an hour, instead of dealing out his packets of mille
  notes to the ghouls of the Casino according to plan, Andrew Tresholm was
  leaning over the crazy balcony of the most picturesquely situated restaurant
  in Europe looking down at what seemed to be a collection of toy buildings out
  of a child's play-box. A waiter at his elbow coughed suggestively, and
  Tresholm ordered coffee. He stretched himself out in a wicker chair and
  seemed singularly content. The afternoon was warm, and Tresholm, who had ill
  endured the lack of ventilation in his so-called <i>train de luxe</i> the
  night before, dosed peacefully in his chair. He awoke to the sound of
  familiar voices&mdash;a woman's musical and pleading, a man's dogged and
  irritable.</p>

  <p>"Can't you understand the common sense of the thing, Norah?" the latter
  was arguing. "The luck must turn. It's got to turn. Take my case. I've lost
  for four nights. Tonight, therefore. I am all the more likely to win. What's
  the good of going home with the paltry sum we have left? Much better try to
  get the whole lot back."</p>

  <p>"Five thousand pounds isn't a paltry sum by any means," the girl
  protested. "It would make things much more comfortable for us even though you
  still had to go on at your job."</p>

  <p>"Darn the job," was the vicious rejoinder.</p>

  <p>Tresholm, who was now quite awake, rose deliberately to his feet and moved
  across to them.</p>

  <p>"Do I, by any chance, come across my young friends of Angoulême once more
  in some alight trouble? Can I be of any assistance?"</p>

  <p>The youth glanced across at him and scowled. The girl swung round.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tresholm!" she exclaimed. "Fancy your being here! Aren't we terrible
  people, squabbling at the top of our voices in such a beautiful place?"</p>

  <p>Tresholm sank into the chair which the young man, with an ungracious
  greeting, had pushed towards him.</p>

  <p>"I seem fated to come up against you two in moments of tribulation," he
  remarked. "At Angoulême, I think I really was of some assistance. You would
  never have reached the place but for my chauffeur, who fortunately knows more
  about cars than I do. A little pathetic you looked, Miss Norah&mdash;forgive
  me, but I never heard your other name&mdash;leaning against the wall by the
  side of that exquisite mountain road, wondering whether any good-natured
  person would stop and ask if you were in trouble."</p>

  <p>She smiled at the recollection. "And you did stop," she reminded him
  gratefully. "You helped us wonderfully."</p>

  <p>"It was my good fortune," he said lightly, but with a faint note of
  sincerity in his tone. "And this time? What about it? May I be told the
  trouble again? A discussion about gambling apparently. Well, I know more,
  about gambling than I do about motor-cars. Let me be your adviser."</p>

  <p>"Much obliged. It's no one else's trouble except our own," the young man
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"Or business, I suppose you would like to add," Tresholm observed equably.
  "Perhaps your sister will be more communicative.</p>

  <p>"I told you that night at the hotel at Angoulême of my reputation. I am a
  meddler in other people's affairs. You young people have been disputing about
  something. Let me settle the matter for you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the girl agreed with enthusiasm. "Let me tell him, Jack."</p>

  <p>"You can do as you jolly well please," was the surly rejoinder.</p>

  <p>The girl leaned across the little round table towards Tresholm. "We told
  you a little about ourselves at Angoulême during the evening of the day when
  you had been so kind to us," she reminded him. "We are orphans and we have
  been living together at Norwich, just on Jack's salary. Our name, by the by,
  is Bartlett We hadn't a penny in the world, except what Jack earned.</p>

  <p>"Then two months ago, quite unexpectedly, a distant relative, whom we had
  scarcely ever heard of, died and left us five thousand pounds each. We
  decided to pool the money, have a holiday &mdash;Jack's vacation was almost
  due&mdash;and, for once in our lives, have a thoroughly good time."</p>

  <p>"A very sound idea," Tresholm murmured.</p>

  <p>"The place we both wanted to come to," she went on, "was Monte Carlo. We
  bought a little motor-car&mdash;you know something about that&mdash;and we
  reached here a few days ago. It was lots of fun, but, alas, ever since we
  arrived Jack and I have disagreed. His point of view&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell him that myself." her brother interrupted. "Ten thousand pounds
  our legacy was&mdash;nine thousand we reckoned, when our holiday's paid for,
  and the car. Well, supposing I invested it, what would it mean? Four hundred
  and fifty a year. Neither one thing nor the other. It's just about what I'm
  earning. It wouldn't have helped me to escape, I should have had to go on
  just the same, and I hate the work like poison."</p>

  <p>"Four hundred and fifty a year would have made life very much easier for
  us, even though you had to go on working," she remarked wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Thinking of yourself as usual," he growled. "Well, anyhow, you agreed at
  first."</p>

  <p>"Agreed to what?" Tresholm inquired.</p>

  <p>"To taking our chance of making a bit while we were here," he explained.
  "We decided to risk a couple of thousand pounds and see if we could make
  enough to live quietly somewhere in the country, where there was golf and a
  bit of shooting."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't my idea," she ventured.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it wasn't," he scoffed. "You're like all women. You're too
  frightened of losing to make a good sportsman."</p>

  <p>"Well, we have lost" she rejoined drily&mdash;"not two thousand but
  four."</p>

  <p>"That seems unfortunate," was Tresholm's grave comment "What is the
  present subject of your dispute?"</p>

  <p>"Simply this," the young man confided. "We have spent or shall have spent,
  by the time we get home, a thousand pounds of the legacy. We have lost at the
  tables four thousand, and sold the little car we bought for half what we gave
  for it We have five thousand left Norah wants me to promise not to go into
  the Casino again, and to leave for home at once with five thousand pounds in
  the bank. I want to go, neck or nothing&mdash;win back at least our five
  thousand&mdash;perhaps a good bit more. The luck must turn."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Tresholm agreed. "There's a certain amount of reason in what
  your brother says, Miss Norah."</p>

  <p>She looked at him almost in horror.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say that you're going to advise him to risk the rest of
  our legacy!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Tresholm made no direct reply. He passed around his case and lighted a
  cigarette himself.</p>

  <p>"Well," he pronounced, "I have a certain amount of sympathy for your
  brother's point of view. If I were in his position and had lost as much as
  you say, I think I should want a shot at getting some of it back, but," he
  added, checking the young man's exclamation of delight and the girls little
  cry of disappointment with the same gesture, "I should want to know that the
  odds were level"</p>

  <p>"Roulette's a fair enough game," the young man protested. "One chance in
  thirty five against you&mdash;and zero, of course."</p>

  <p>"You may call that fair," Tresholm said calmly; "I don't. I am assuming
  that with your small capital you're backing the numbers. Very well. The bank
  has the pull on you the whole of the time to the extent of five or six
  percent If you play <i>chemin de fer</i>, the <i>cagnotte</i> amounts to
  about the same thing.</p>

  <p>"I am with you in spirit, my young friend, but gambling at Monte Carlo
  isn't what I call gambling at all. You're fighting a man of equal ability a
  stone heavier than yourself. It can't be done. It's automatic. You must
  lose."</p>

  <p>"That's what I say," the girl declared triumphantly. "We're simply foolish
  to dream of throwing away the last of our money."</p>

  <p>"But people do win," her brother insisted There's that Hungarian who won
  half a million francs the night before last."</p>

  <p>"The Casino takes pretty good care to advertise it when anything of that
  sort happens," Tresholm pointed out. "He'll probably be in again tonight and
  lose the lot, and more besides. Now listen to me, Bartlett" he went on. "I'm
  not against you in spirit I'm against you in this particular proposal because
  you want to take on an impossibility.</p>

  <p>"The people who win here are just the people who play to amuse themselves,
  and who go away when they've had their fun. People in your position, with a
  few thousand pounds left over from a legacy and nothing else to fall back
  upon in the world, are the people who inevitably lose."</p>

  <p>The young man thrust his hands into his trousers pockets.</p>

  <p>"It's no good trying to be scientific in gambling," he said. "If you want
  to have a plunge, you always must have a bit up against you, of course.
  What's it matter so long as you win? I never mind backing a horse at odds on,
  so long as it's a certainty."</p>

  <p>"There is such a thing as fair gambling," Tresholm pointed out. "I'll toss
  you for your five thousand pounds, if you like. That's a level
  affair&mdash;no <i>cagnotte</i>, no zero. You can choose the coin."</p>

  <p>The girl gave a little cry. Her brother gasped.</p>

  <p>"You're not serious?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tresholm!" she remonstrated.</p>

  <p>"I'm perfectly serious," he assured them both. "You seem to think that I
  know nothing about gambling. On the contrary, I am described in the police
  records of this principality as a professional gambler. I must live up to my
  reputation. I will toss you for five thousand pounds. Shall I send for a
  coin?"</p>

  <p>"No!" the girl almost shrieked.</p>

  <p>Tresholm shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he acquiesced. "You would like to prolong the agony. Dine
  with me, both of you, tonight at the Hotel de Paris at half past eight We
  will either toss, or play any game you like where the odds are level, for
  whatever sum you like up to five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at him reproachfully through a mist of tears. Her brother
  was exuberant.</p>

  <p>"You're a sportsman," he declared. "I wanted to dine at the Paris once
  more before we left. We'll be there at half past eight."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Gustave Sordel paid a special visit to the hotel just before
  dinner-time that evening. He encountered Monsieur Robert in the hall.</p>

  <p>"But what has arrived!" he exclaimed. "All the afternoon my chefs have
  been on the <i>qui vive</i>. I have reinforced every table to the extent of a
  hundred thousand francs. I arranged for a high table at <i>chemin de fer</i>,
  and, if Monsieur Tresholm had wished to take a bank at <i>baccarat</i>
  tonight, it could have been managed. Yet behold the strange thing which has
  arrived. He has not as yet taken out his ticket&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the Sporting Hub, perhaps?" Monsieur Robert suggested. "Three times I
  have sent there. No one of his name has applied for a card."</p>

  <p>"This affair gives one to think," Monsieur Robert admitted, "At present he
  dines with a young Englishman and his sister&mdash;a couple <i>bien
  distingué</i>, but poor. They left here last week for a cheaper hotel. Of
  what interest can they be to him?"</p>

  <p>Sordel shrugged his shoulders. "After all." he pointed out "even a
  professional gambler must have his moments. He waits far the night without a
  doubt."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the restaurant, Tresholm, to all appearance, was very much
  enjoying his dinner. Bartlett was excited and talkative. Norah, on the other
  hand, was very quiet. She ate and drank little, and her manner, especially
  towards her host, was reserved, not to say cold.</p>

  <p>"Your sister, Bartlett" the latter confided, "is displeased with me. I
  wonder whether I might ask why."</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

  </div>

  <p>"Because you have taken his side against me," she said, looking at him
  with a smoldering anger in her eyes. "You are encouraging him to gamble with
  that last five thousand pounds. I hoped so much that you would have been on
  my side, that you would have told him to keep that money, for both our sakes,
  and not to enter the Casino again."</p>

  <p>"And if I had told him that" Tresholm asked calmly, "would it have made
  any difference?"</p>

  <p>She reflected for a moment. "Perhaps it would not," she admitted. "He is
  very self-willed. He would probably have had his own way, and yet, somehow or
  other, I am sorry that it should have been you who encouraged this."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that you are quite just to blame me," he complained. "You
  must realize that nothing I could have said would have made the slightest
  difference. You know that you yourself have used all your persuasions. Your
  brother would have lost every penny in the Casino, if I had not offered him a
  saner chance of gambling with me."</p>

  <p>"I can't explain," she sighed. "I am just disappointed."</p>

  <p>They left the table, crossed the lounge and entered the elevator. In the
  corridor Bartlett stopped to speak to an acquaintance.</p>

  <p>The girl suddenly turned to her companion.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tresholm," she begged, "don't do this. Let him lose his money in the
  Casino, if he must I don't like the idea of you two sitting down to play
  against one another. I don't like it There's something horrible about it"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," he asked, "that, if your brother must throw his money
  away, I might as well have it as anybody else?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;do you really mean that you are what you said?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there is a certain amount of truth in what I told you," he
  acknowledged. "If you go to the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i> here in Monaco, he will
  show you my papers."</p>

  <p>"Then I think it is all very terrible," she pronounced sadly. "I am very
  sorry that we ever came to Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>"Now for the terms," Tresholm said, as he and Bartlett seated themselves
  at a small table. "First of all, here are two tickets for the Blue Train
  tomorrow. It is understood that, whether you win my money or I win yours, you
  make use of them."</p>

  <p>"Right-o!" the young man agreed, pocketing the yellow slips.</p>

  <p>"I require more than a casual acceptance of that proposal," Tresholm
  persisted. "I require your word of honor."</p>

  <p>"That's all right" the other acquiesced. "I promise upon my honor."</p>

  <p>"And I am your witness," Norah intervened gravely.</p>

  <p>"Furthermore, whether you win or lose," Tresholm continued, "you must
  promise not to return within twelve months."</p>

  <p>"Agreed. Come along. Let's start"</p>

  <p>"The game I leave entirely to you," Tresholm announced. "There are, as you
  see, four new packs of cards. I will cut you highest or lowest to win,
  whichever you like, or I will play you two-handed poker, or <i>piquet</i>, or
  any other game you prefer."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden gleam in the young man's eyes. "<i>Piquet</i>?" he
  repeated. "You play <i>piquet</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Rather well," Tresholm warned him. "I should advise you to choose
  something else."</p>

  <p>Bartlett laughed confidently. "<i>Piquet's</i> good enough for me," he
  declared. "I used to play it with my old governor every night Let's get on
  with it," he added, moistening his dry lips. "A hundred pounds a time,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever you like," was the reply.</p>

  <p>It was midnight before the matter was concluded. Bartlett, white and
  distraught, with a dangerous, almost lunatic, gleam in his eyes, was pacing
  the room excitedly. Norah, unexpectedly calm, was still seated in the chair
  from which she had watched the gambling with changeless expression. Tresholm
  remained at the table. Before him lay a check for five thousand pounds which
  the young man had just signed.</p>

  <p>"Ready, Jack?" she asked at last.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," he growled. "Come along."</p>

  <p>Tresholm rose. "You've had a fair deal with level odds for your money,
  haven't you?" he asked his late opponent.</p>

  <p>"I'm not complaining," was, the broken reply. "I suppose it's no use
  asking you to lend me a hundred just to have one shot at the Sporting
  Club?"</p>

  <p>"Not the least use in the world," Tresholm refused. "The hundred pounds
  would go just where the rest of your money has gone. There are some of us who
  are made to win at games of chance; others to lose. You are one of the
  predestined losers. If you take my advice, you will never again, so long as
  you live, indulge in any game of chance for money." He opened the door. The
  girl passed out slim and dignified, without a glance in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Good night Miss Bartlett" he ventured.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Mr. Tresholm," she replied. "I congratulate you upon your
  profitable evening."</p>

  <p>With that they both disappeared.</p>

  <p>Tresholm returned to his place at the table, playing idly with the
  cards.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Blue Train, disturbingly early upon its return journey,
  just as it is usually outrageously late upon its arrival, came groaning round
  the bend from Mentone, snorting and puffing into the Monte Carlo station.
  Norah settled down sadly in her compartment while her brother made his way to
  the restaurant car to secure seats for dinner.</p>

  <p>Then, glancing idly out of the window, she suddenly gave a little gasp.
  Very deliberately along the platform came Tresholm, calm and undisturbed.
  Behind him was a small boy carrying an enormous bouquet of roses.</p>

  <p>She shrank beck in her place. Anything rather than see him! Before she
  could decide upon any means of escape, however, the roses were on the seat by
  her side, and Tresholm was standing bare-headed before her.</p>

  <p>"A little farewell offering for you. Miss Bartlett which you must accept,
  and a farewell note here for you to read as soon as the train has started,"
  he added, handing her a letter. "Will you shake hands?"</p>

  <p>In her moment of indecision she forgot and she looked up at him. Directly
  her eyes met his, clear, gray and somehow compelling, she gave in. Her
  fingers rested for a moment in his. Then he raised them and brushed them with
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said gratefully, "that you did not carry your resentment
  too far. You will accept the roses, I hope, as an inadequate peace-offering,
  and think of me as kindly as you can."</p>

  <p>Then he was gone, and it was not until after the train had passed through
  the first of the two tunnels that she remembered the note. She tore open the
  envelop and read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Lady of Angoulême,</p>

  <p class="letter">I very much fear that your perceptions were keener than
  your brother's last night and that you realised the fact that I was playing
  with marked cards&mdash;part of the equipment of the professional gambler.
  The unexpected luxury of a qualm of conscience has, however, seized me, and I
  return your brother's check for his imaginary loss.</p>

  <p class="letter">I still hold him, however, to the conditions of our
  bargain, and, if you will accept the advice of such an unprincipled person,
  keep him away from gambling in any shape or form, even though the odds should
  seem level. There are some men who are born winners. I am one of them. There
  are others who are born losers. Your brother is one of those.</p>

  <p class="letter">Fate, alas, deals out other favors to the latter class,
  which she denies to the former.</p>

  <p class="letter">Which is why I must sign myself,</p>

  <p class="letter">Unhappily yours,<br>
  Andrew Tresholm."</p><br>

  <p>Fragments of a torn check fluttered across the compartment. Even in her
  dazed state, even under the spell of that great throbbing joy with which she
  waited for her brother's return, there crept into her mind a faint, wonderful
  doubt&mdash; a doubt which sometimes, when she looked backwards, seemed to
  color those hours of agony with a little halo of romance. Was it altogether
  by chance, she wondered, in those moments of reflection, that the only
  possible means by which her brother could have been induced to return to
  England with that five thousand pounds were precisely those which Tresholm
  had employed?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In his sitting-room, Tresholm found the four packs of cards
  neatly stacked upon the mantelpiece. He rang the bell for the waiter.</p>

  <p>"You might return those," he begged, "to whomever you borrowed them
  from."</p>

  <p>The waiter collected them with a smile, also the fifty-franc note which
  Tresholm passed him.</p>

  <p>"I borrowed them from one of the clerks in the office, Monsieur," he
  confided. "I trust that Monsieur had fortune,"</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded slightly, but without his usual smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am generally lucky," he confessed.</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Tresholm took a Gambler's chance,<br>
  but the stakes were temptingly high and he couldn't resist</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Jan 1929<br>
  Syndicated by The Metropolitan Newspaper Service, New York, 1929</h3>
  <br>

  <p class="first">TRESHOLM brought his car to a standstill under a
  close-leafed magnolia tree, jammed on the brakes, and lighted a cigarette.
  For six miles, ascending gradually from the sea-level, he had climbed the
  mountainous road until he had reached the fruitful plateau which embosoms the
  the slopes of the Lesser Alps. Blue and cold, the landscape lay below him,
  gray here and there, with the shimmer of turning olive leaves, the vineyards
  and meadows like little squares of patchwork, the flower fields daubs of
  brilliant color, the river winding its way amongst them, a glittering thread
  of silver. In front, barely a mile distant, was one of the old hill towns,
  the houses of which might well have been carved out of the living rock. The
  air around him was pleasantly brisk. In the majestic distance, the snow still
  lay upon the mountains.</p>

  <p>His resting-place was peaceful and well-chosen. On his right was a humble
  French domain, a trim white house, with red roof and green shutters,
  separated from the road by a carefully tended vineyard, an orchard of orange
  trees wandering up to a plantation of pines behind. A very pleasant, sunny
  spot it seemed, cut off from the world by the ravine, on the farther summit
  of which was the old town and the precipitous way by which one climbed from
  the great thoroughfares below. Scarcely a human being in sight, scarcely a
  toiler in the fields.</p>

  <p>An imaginary solitude. Tresholm started as he realised the fixed stare of
  a gaunt figure in blue jeans, standing only a few feet away from him in the
  vineyard, partially concealed by a scrubby hawthorn hedge. It was more than
  the ordinary scrutiny of the curious peasant; in fact, it became clear to
  Tresholm during those first few seconds that the man was not a peasant at all
  He was tall and thin, and there was something fine-cut about his features.
  The brown fingers which grasped the pruning-knife were well-formed and
  shapely, and as he returned that intense gaze, a queer wave of remembrance
  swept into Tresholm's brain. Like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, those scraps of
  memory mocked him: the bleak wind-swept plain; the wilderness, dotted all
  over with a maze of tin huts and framework buildings; the road of a great
  city with its myriads of blinding lights; a room high up in a huge official
  building; the thunder of tram, below; the ceaseless movement of multitudes
  crawling like ants along the pavements.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the two men reached the end of that unwinding coil of memory at
  the same moment, for the watcher in the vineyard turned abruptly away and
  strode off towards the house. With a muttered exclamation, Tresholm pressed
  the starting-button of his car, turned in at the rude gateway, drove up the
  rock-strewn approach to the house, and pulled up in its shadow. He descended,
  and waited for the man, who was still climbing from below.</p>

  <p>"You're Dows, aren't you?" he greeted him&mdash; Jasper Dows, Naval
  Intelligence Department at Washington? Let me see, how many years ago?... Who
  cares?"</p>

  <p>"I am Jasper Dows, all right," he admitted, "but Washington Naval
  Intelligence Department&mdash;I don't know what you're talking about. All
  gone! I'm a small landed proprietor of Les Tourettes. Eighty acres&mdash;you
  can see the lot, I remember you, though. You're Tresholm. Blast you!"</p>

  <p>"Why blast me?" his visitor remonstrated.</p>

  <p>Jasper Dows laughed bitterly and stood for a moment in silence. When he
  spoke again, there was a change in his manner.</p>

  <p>Some of the resentment had gone.</p>

  <p>"Not your fault, of course, Tresholm," he acknowledged. "Come in and drink
  a bottle of wine. It's long enough since I talked my own language."</p>

  <p>They passed into a small sitting-room, in which were some quaint pieces of
  old Provençal furniture, a mass of flowers in a rude china basin, but with
  carpetless floor and empty walls, poverty lurking even in its cleanliness. A
  woman rose hastily from a chair in a corner with its back to the
  window&mdash;a woman far too attractive for her surroundings, evidently
  English or American, a little startled at the sight of an unexpected
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman whom I used to know, Sara," the master of the house
  announced. "My wife, Tresholm. We want a bottle of last year's vintage, dear,
  and a couple of glasses."</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"></a></p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300371h-images/Tresholm03.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>She greeted Tresholm pleasantly, left them for a few minutes, and returned
  with a bottle of wine and two glasses upon a tray.</p>

  <p>"The most brutal thing I ever did, to bring her over here," Jasper Dows
  acknowledged, as, with a word of excuse, she hurried away again. "She would
  come, though. She's that sort of woman."</p>

  <p>"But what was the trouble?" Tresholm asked gravely. "When I left
  Washington&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You knew nothing about it, of course, the other interrupted. "The trouble
  was disgrace and ruin." "That's rather hard to believe."</p>

  <p>"There were a few men in my department who thought so at the time. They
  changed their minds, though, and out I went. I got the sack, Tresholm.
  Cashiered&mdash;chucked out of the service. Do you know who brought it about?
  Of course you don't. I'll tell you. Here's one of them." He picked up a copy
  of the Nice <i>Éclaireur</i>, which had been lying upon the table, and read a
  paragraph from the English and American news: class="newspaper" "Considerable
  excitement has been caused in the Sporting Club during this week by the very
  spirited gambling of an American millionaire, Mr. Josh Chandler, of New York.
  We understand that he was successful in breaking the bank twice in one
  evening." "That's one of them," Jasper Dows continued, throwing the paper
  down. "Josh Chandler was one, and you were the other."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" Tresholm expostulated, wondering for the moment whether
  the man had lost his wits.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, drink your wine, and listen. You are the one man in the world
  to whom I can tell the story."</p>

  <p>Tresholm listened, and it was late in the afternoon, with the sun sinking
  over the Esterels, when he glided down again from the farm among the
  mountains to take his place in the stream of vehicles panting along the
  lighted way.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Gustave Sordel, being at a loose end the following morning, crossed the
  road from the Casino about a quarter of an hour before luncheon, and took an
  aperitif with his friend Monsieur Robert, the director of the hotel. They
  found seats in a retired corner of the lounge.</p>

  <p>"The doors of the Casino are still open?" the latter demanded, in gentle
  badinage.</p>

  <p>"And likely to remain open, so far as regards this eccentric of yours,"
  was the good-humored reply. "Figure to yourself, my dear friend, this
  Monsieur Tresholm. He rests here within a stone's throw of the Casino, he
  inscribes himself a professional gambler, and he has not yet taken out his
  card of admission. What does he do with himself?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what he did yesterday," Monsieur Robert volunteered, "He
  left his chauffeur, and he drove out into the country. When he returned, he
  dined alone&mdash;the dinner of an epicure, mind you, and drank with it half
  a bottle of of my finest Burgundy." "And afterwards?" "He went to bed."</p>

  <p>"Imbecile&mdash;for what does he wait?"</p>

  <p>"For money, perhaps. One cannot storm your stronghold, my dear Gustave,
  without the sinews of war."</p>

  <p>The director of the Casino moved a little nearer to his friend.</p>

  <p>"As to that," he confided, lowering his voice," I can tell you something.
  Have no fear for your hotel bill. Yesterday morning&mdash;it must have been
  before our friend started for his motor trip&mdash;I was at the bank, and
  I&mdash;I myself, mind you, was compelled to wait. An important client was
  with the manager.</p>

  <p>"When he came out from the office it was this Monsieur Tresholm. They were
  around him as though he were a Rothschild. The manager even escorted him to
  the door whilst I waited."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Robert was interested. "You ventured upon an enquiry,
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Up there they are discreet," was the cautious reply. Monsieur Blunt, as
  you know, has little to say. In his position, he is wise. He brushed aside
  all my interrogations. 'Monsieur Tresholm,' he whispered in my ear, 'comes to
  us with excellent recommendations from the highest quarters.' What more than
  that can be said of any stranger? Yet that is the man who announces himself
  as a professional gambler, and in four days he has not crossed the threshold
  of the Casino or of the Sporting Club."</p>

  <p>They spoke of other things, and as they talked Tresholm himself entered.
  He was in tennis togs, carrying a racket under his arm, and instead of
  passing directly across the lounge, he made a detour towards the restaurant
  which led him past the divan where the two men were seated. The hotel
  director greeted him cordially.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur was successful in finding a game this morning?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I found just the game I hoped for," Tresholm confided.</p>

  <p>"Excellent! And your apartments, they are comfortable?there is nothing one
  can do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," was the courteous assurance. "Everything is as one
  expects to find it at the Hotel de Paris? perfect."</p>

  <p>He would have moved on, but his interlocutor detained him.</p>

  <p>"Let me present my friend, Monsieur Sordel," he begged. "It is Monsieur
  Tresholm, you understand," he added, turning to his companion, "who has
  perpetrated this jest upon the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i>. I present, you
  understand, one professional to another. It is a matter of attack and
  defense. Monsieur Sordel directs the ?Casino."</p>

  <p>Tresholm smiled as he shook hands. "Your friend," he remarked, "is a man
  of many affairs."</p>

  <p>"As yet," Sordel rejoined. "I have not had to number yon amongst my
  responsibilities."</p>

  <p>"That will come, without a doubt," Tresholm predicted. "When I first
  arrived, I had some young friends to entertain. Yesterday the weather was so
  perfect that I had a fancy for the country. Today, who knows?"</p>

  <p>He passed on with a nod of farewell, and the two men exchanged significant
  glances.</p>

  <p>"It may be today, then," Gustave Sordel observed.</p>

  <p>Tresholm paused to interview a <i>maître d'hôtel</i> and order luncheon
for two
  in half an hour, after which he ascended to his room, took a shower-bath and
  changed his clothes. He descended in time to welcome his guest&mdash;an
  American, Chandler by name, his recent opponent at tennis, and a man
  apparently of about his own age. There was a marked difference between the
  two, however as they strolled together into the restaurant&mdash;Tresholm
  lean, bright-eyed and sunburnt, to all appearances as hard as nails, and in
  perfect condition; his companion, built on stockier lines, more than a little
  fleshy, carefully dressed and groomed, but with the air of one to whom the
  night pleasures of the principality had made their successful appeal.</p>

  <p>"Lucky to have come across you this morning," he remarked, as they took
  their places. "Don't know that I should have got a game at all. Fellows here
  seem sort of cliquish. Don't fancy taking a stranger in if they can help
  it."</p>

  <p>"I dare say they make up their sets beforehand," Tresholm suggested
  tactfully.</p>

  <p>"Maybe. Guess I'd better let a few of them know who I am. My old dad left
  twenty million of the best. You bet I don't have to wait long for a game at
  any club over on the other aide."</p>

  <p>"Twenty million dollars is a great deal of money." "Piled it up during the
  war, the old man did," his son confided.</p>

  <p>"You were over on this side?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't get the chance. I was in the navy, but they wanted me in
  Washington. Seaplane stuff, most of the time. Gosh, they kept me at it,
  too!"</p>

  <p>His first high-ball was beginning to loosen the young man's tongue.</p>

  <p>He was filled with placid satisfaction with himself and his
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Say, I ought not to have let you whip me like that this morning," he
  observed. "Six?two, six?one. Not often I get it in the neck like that."</p>

  <p>"A little lazy round the back line, weren't you? A late night?"</p>

  <p>"Say, if anyone can tell me how to get to bed early in this little burg,
  he's a winner with me," Chandler declared gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I was playing <i>chemie</i> until five this morning."</p>

  <p>"I rather thought roulette was your game," Tresholm remarked. "Didn't I
  see that you had a big win yesterday or the day before?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred and thirty-eight thousand of the best, I skun em," the young
  man boasted. "I had them all scared. They don't understand having anyone up
  against them who can afford to lose just as much as he wants to. It don't
  matter a snap of the fingers to me whether I win or not. That's where I've
  got them cold.</p>

  <p>"A hundred and thirty-eight thousand," Tresholm repeated softly, thinking
  for a moment of that poverty-stricken farm up in the mountains. "That's a
  great deal of money, Mr. Chandler."</p>

  <p>"I guess it seems so over here," was the complacent reply. "See that bulge
  in my pocket? There it is, and they can have the lot back this evening, if
  they can get it."</p>

  <p>Conversation languished for a time and then continued upon somewhat formal
  lines. Towards the close of their meal, the American, who had been
  scrutinizing his host closely, asked him a abrupt question.</p>

  <p>"Say, haven't we met somewhere before, Mr. Tresholm? Something about you
  seems kind of familiar to me ever since you came up and asked me for a
  game."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised," was the somewhat vague acknowledgment. It's a
  small world, you know."</p>

  <p>"Ever been in the States?"</p>

  <p>"Not lately. I dare say we come across each other in Paris or somewhere,"
  Tresholm observed. "I wander about a good deal"</p>

  <p>"Same here. I don't have to do any work, and over this side's good enough
  You Europeans know how to live the life. Say, that's a bully two-seater of
  yours, Mr. Tresholm."</p>

  <p>"Glad you like it. How about a little run into the country this
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"It will keep me awake at any rate," the young man agreed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At Nice, Chandler, who had dropped off to sleep before they had reached
  Beaulieu, woke up and demanded a highball. They stopped at the Negresco bar
  where he relapsed into an easy chair with a sigh of content.</p>

  <p>"Some car of yours," he admitted; "but I guess we've come about far
  enough, eh? This seems a pretty good spot to me."</p>

  <p>"Only a little farther on," Tresholm begged. "I want to call on a man I
  used to know, if you don't mind. We can look in here again coming back, if
  you want to."</p>

  <p>Chandler's acquiescence was a little ungracious, but he suffered himself
  presently to be escorted out to the car, where he sank back among the
  cushions and promptly went to sleep. Tresholm drove smoothly on until they
  were just short of Cagnes, when he turned off the main road and crept upwards
  towards the ridge which encircled the lesser mountains.</p>

  <p>Outside the little farmhouse, he pulled up and shook his companion.</p>

  <p>"Come along in and see my pal," he invited.</p>

  <p>Chandler sat up, blinking, and looked around him. "Where are we?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere between Cagnes and Vence. We have a visit to pay."</p>

  <p>Chandler descended grumpily, and Tresholm, opening the unfastened front
  door, ushered him into the bare sitting-room. The unwilling guest looked
  about him distastefully.</p>

  <p>"Don't seem to me as though we'd get a drink here," he decided. "I guess
  I'll leave you to your friend and wait outside."</p>

  <p>Then Tresholm did an unexpected thing. He locked the door, placed the key
  in his pocket and pointed to a hard wooden chair.</p>

  <p>"You'll sit there, and wait until we've finished a little matter of
  business," he directed.</p>

  <p>Josh Chandler was dumfounded. He stared first at the man who had suddenly
  abandoned his role of courteous if somewhat silent host and addressed these
  threatening words to him, and then at the no-less-alarming figure in blue
  overalls who had pushed aside the curtains and appeared upon the threshold of
  an inner room. As he stared, his memory also reasserted itself. His sleepy,
  drink-sodden brain cleared beneath the shock.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" he exclaimed. "It's Jasper Dows&mdash;and"?his eyes
  traveled fearfully towards Tresholm&mdash;"and the Englishman!"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. His gaze wandered from the worn face of his
  former associate back to Tresholm, cold, supercilious, tight-lipped, hard yet
  flexible as a piece of steel.</p>

  <p>"What's this&mdash; a hold-up?" he demanded. "I'm getting out of
  here."</p>

  <p>"You'll stay just where you are," Tresholm enjoined calmly.</p>

  <p>"Who's going to stop me?"</p>

  <p>"I am. You can have a rough-house if you want it, Chandler. Oh, yes, I
  know you're a strong fellow, but I am a boxer. You wouldn't live with me for
  thirty seconds. No good patting your hip pocket either. I felt you over in
  the car. You'd better listen quietly,"</p>

  <p>"What the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, do be quiet," Tresholm begged a little wearily. "It isn't any use.
  You're up against it. You've recognised me. I know the truth as between you
  and Jasper Dows. You'd better look upon me as your protector. I think if I
  left you two alone, he'd kill you."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm afraid?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to be if you're not," was the quiet rejoinder. "If you think a
  thrashing will help you to listen more patiently, come outside and have it.
  If not, get back to your chair."</p>

  <p>"I'm right enough here. Get on with it"</p>

  <p>"We won't specify the actual date," Tresholm began, "but some ten or
  eleven years ago, not being in the financial position to which your father's
  millions have since boosted you, you sold copies of various plans of proposed
  new American seaplanes to the secret service agent of another country who
  happened to be in Washington."</p>

  <p>Chandler looked around the room as though to be sure that there were no
  other auditors but that stern, haggard figure standing between the parted
  curtains.</p>

  <p>"I sold them to you," he said hoarsely. "I've been wondering&mdash;I was
  wondering all luncheon-time where I'd seen you before."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Tresholm acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"You sold them to me, and I paid you a very handsome sum of money for
  them. Unfortunately, the fact that the plans had been copied leaked out, and
  the affair was traced either to Jasper Dows, or to you. As is usually the
  case, the innocent man got it in the neck, and you, the guilty one,
  escaped.</p>

  <p>"Jasper Dows was considered lucky to be cashiered. His father cut off his
  allowance and died without leaving him a penny. His friends gave him the cold
  shoulder, and here he is, working himself to death, earning just enough to
  live on. By rights, you ought to be in his place, Chandler. I know the person
  from whom I bought the plans, don't I?"</p>

  <p>The accused man leaned forward. His eyes were full of a very malicious
  light.</p>

  <p>"You know all right, you confounded spy," he agreed, "but you can't tell.
  Supposing I did sell them to you, what about it? You can't open your mouth,
  and I'm not going to. There isn't another soul in the world knows the
  truth&mdash;and you can't tell."</p>

  <p>Tresholm eyed him for a moment meditatively. "What a foul swine you are,"
  he remarked, in bitter disgust.</p>

  <p>"However, either you forget one trifling circumstance, or things may be
  different in your country. We have a statute of limitations&mdash;ten years
  it is fixed at in my department The ten years are up. Added to this, my
  papers went in some time ago. I am a free man. Chandler. How do you like
  that?"</p>

  <p>Apparently, Chandler didn't like it at all.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "Is this blackmail?"</p>

  <p>Tresholm inclined his head very slightly. I alway said that you were not
  quite a fool, Chandler," he confided. "It is blackmail, and you are the
  victim."</p>

  <p>The young man was dazed. Tresholm pointed authoritatively to his chair. He
  sat down.</p>

  <p>"Let us consider the matter now from a business point of view," he
  continued "Jasper Daws, you had better join us."</p>

  <p>"I'll stay where I am," was the low, passionate reply. "If I'm in the same
  room I might kill him."</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he assented. "Well, I'll proceed on your behalf. Our friend
  Jasper Dows, Chandler, would have inherited at least half a million from his
  father, if it hadn't been for your machinations. Very well, we'll start with
  that. I think you told me on the tennis-courts this morning, and at luncheon
  today?several times, if I remember rightly,?that the old man, as you called
  him, had left you twenty millions. We'll take half a million away from you.
  Half a million dollars, Chandler?not a great sum for the ruin of a man's
  life."</p>

  <p>"What else?" was the gruff demand.</p>

  <p>"Several little things. First of all, you won, as all Monte Carlo knows, a
  hundred and thirty-eight thousand francs last night I can see the mille notes
  bulging in your pockets. You have even confided to me the fact of their
  presence there. You will hand them over to Jasper Dows for immediate
  expenses."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, now we come to the point. Your confession of having sold the plans,
  and of Jasper Dows' innocence, is drawn up here. Your signature will be
  witnessed by the American consul, who is now walking with Mrs. Dows in the
  garden&mdash; but?listen to me calmly&mdash;this is where my friend Jasper
  Dows is inclined to be generous. He has, as it happens, no desire to return
  permanently to America. Your confession, therefore, will only be used to
  insure the clearing of his name.</p>

  <p>"That is to say, it will simply be placed before the authorities in
  Washington. His rank in the service will be restored, and that is all he
  desires. You have nothing to lose in this direction, for yon held no
  commission. You were simply a shirker, placed in the department by influence
  to escape active service."</p>

  <p>"Ill have nothing to do with this business!" Chandler shouted.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Tresholm begged, holding out his band. "Consider for a moment what
  will happen if you agree. You will have made such atonement as is possible to
  Jasper Dows, even though it may have been under compulsion. For the rest of
  his life he will enjoy the comfort of which you have deprived him for the
  last ten years, and his honor will be re-established. Consider what a relief
  this will be to that sensitive conscience of yours, Chandler."</p>

  <p>"Blast you!" the other snarled.</p>

  <p>"On the other band," Tresholm went on, unmoved, "if you refuse, being a
  free-lance in life and having a fancy for my friend Jasper Dows here, and his
  wife, I shall take the trouble to pay a visit to Washington myself, where I
  still have many friends. I shall place the facts before the authorities, and
  I shall place them equally before every one of those enterprising and
  brilliant young journalists who are apt to gather around when any social
  scandal or the rumor of it arises. In other words, Chandler, I'll emblazon
  your name on the roll of disgrace from New York to San Francisco, and never
  again, so long as you live, will you be able to put your foot upon the deck
  of a westward-bound steamer."</p>

  <p>Chandler unbuttoned his cost threw the great pile of mille notes upon the
  table, produced his check-book and drew his chair up to the table.</p>

  <p>"I'm beat" he decided.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  </div><br>

  <p>"I always said that you were not quite a fool," Tresholm acknowledged
  pleasantly. "Dows, you might call in Mr. Wisely."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At Nice, on their homeward journey, Tresholm stopped outside a garage.</p>

  <p>"I have brought you so far, much against my inclination," he said to his
  companion. "You can hire a car here. Get out and look after yourself."</p>

  <p>Chandler slouched surlily off, and Tresholm drove on to Monte Carlo.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They sat together in the sunshine outside the Café de Paris the next
  morning&mdash;Jasper Dows and Tresholm. The former had just descended the
  hill from the bank.</p>

  <p>"So it was all right, eh?" his companion asked.</p>

  <p>Jasper Dows had the air of a man who had been living in the darkness for
  years. Even his tone, when he spoke, was the tone of one half dazed.</p>

  <p>"They didn't even hesitate," he announced wonderingly. "The money was
  there already to my credit&mdash;five hundred thousand dollars in French
  francs. I could have drawn the lot if I'd liked."</p>

  <p>"Good! Where's the wife?"</p>

  <p>Dows' face suddenly softened. An almost beatific smile parted his lips.
  One might have fancied that his eyes were a little dim.</p>

  <p>"She's shopping," he confided. "I just pushed a handful of mille notes
  into her bag, and she's gone off with them like a child into toy-land. After
  tea years' poverty, Tresholm!. Never a hundred francs to spend. Making and
  remaking old clothes . . . . And now she's shopping!"</p>

  <p>Tresholm Summoned a waiter and busied himself with the lighting of a
  cigarette. Jasper Dows was feeling his way back to life again.</p>

  <p>"There was one thing yesterday, Tresholm." he said, "that puzzled me. Our
  Secret Service isn't quits the same as yours, of course, but&mdash;that
  statute of limitations now. I don't quite get that."</p>

  <p>Tresholm leaned back in his chair and looked up at the blue sky.</p>

  <p>"Chandler's just the sort of idiot who would swallow such a story," he
  murmured. "You and I know well enough, Dows, that never so long as I lived
  could I have opened my lips."</p>

  <p>"It was just a bluff then?"</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded. "It seemed the only way of dealing with him&mdash;just a
  gamble as to whether he swallowed it or not. I like a gamble sometimes.
  Rather in my line, as it happens," he added, pausing to wave his hand to
  Gustave Sordel, who was passing.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3">THE MASTER CHEAT OF MONTE CARLO</a></h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">First a hold-up and a crooked game of
     cards&mdash;<br>
  A strange evening, but what followed was stranger</p>
  <br>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Feb 1929<br>
  Syndicated by The Metropolitan Newspaper Service, New York, 1929</h3>

  <p class="first">TRESHOLM stood upon the top-most step of the Hotel de Paris
  at Monte Carlo, looking doubtfully out at a not very exhilarating prospect A
  low-lying bank of clouds obscured the panoramic hills, the pavements were
  rain-splashed, there were little puddles in the road.</p>

  <p>The chairs and tables at the Café de Paris opposite were piled up
  together, The <i>commissionnaire</i> outside the Casino awaited arrivals with
  a huge umbrella already unfurled. The Senegalese head porter, standing by
  Tresholm's side, showed all his white teeth in a smile of expectancy.</p>

  <p>"A day for the Casino, Monsieur," he hazarded.</p>

  <p>Tresholm gazed meditatively across the Place at the great stucco-fronted
  building, and the very fact of his hesitation seemed to create a little wave
  of excitement in his immediate neighborhood. The man who worked the lift to
  the underground passage held open the gates hopefully. A boy in buttons
  prepared for a dash across the Place to announce the coming event.</p>

  <p>By intuition, or some invisible means the rumor of this long-expected
  descent upon the stronghold of gambling began to spread. The chief <i>maître
  d'hôtel</i> of the restaurant followed by two of his subordinates, strolled
up as
  though casually to pay respects to an excellent client.</p>

  <p>"A day to remain indoors, I fear, Monsieur," he ventured. "One might amuse
  oneself at the tables for a time."</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded absently. As yet he made no move. Several people in the
  lounge prepared to follow him if he should cross the square.</p>

  <p>A self-declared professional gambler who had been in Monte Carlo for at
  least a week, and had not once entered the gambling rooms! The thing was
  amazing. This morning, however, what else could happen? There was the Casino,
  with its doors hospitably open, through which was passing all the time a
  little stream of the world in mackintoshes. The thing seemed predestined.</p>

  <p>And then a thin shaft of silver appeared from some partially hidden place
  and crept down from skywards. The gray puddles flashed like molten silver.
  The waiters from the Café de Paris came tentatively out and, after a look
  around, began to rearrange the chairs and tables.</p>

  <p>The shaft of sunlight grew broader with the moments. Up in the sky a patch
  of blue was unexpectedly visible. The of rain for one moment became diamonds
  and then ceased. The clouds were parting like the drawing of a curtain in a
  theater.</p>

  <p>And then, unmistakably, sunshine&mdash; sunshine smiling down upon the
  Place as though to explain that those leaden hours had been just a joke. The
  sun shone clearly, its tender warmth chasing all the damp out of the moist
  atmosphere. Monte Carlo was itself again. Tresholm threw away his
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he exclaimed to his Senegalese friend in the blue uniform. "I
  shall go out to Cagnes and play golf."</p>

  <p>The man tried to conceal his disappointment as he summoned the car. The
  lift attendant turned away in disgust. The <i>maître d'hôtel</i> followed his
  example. The expectant little crowd in the lounge resumed their places, and
  Tresholm stepped into his coupé and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Later in the day, it was to mean something to him that the sunshine should
  have appeared at that particular moment.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tresholm put on his brakes, stopping the car at once, while his headlights
  disclosed the man standing in the middle of the road with uplifted arms.
  After a round of golf, he was in an excellent humor and prepared to play the
  good Samaritan to anyone. A broken-down car, perhaps? Someone desiring a
  lift? He leaned forward to scrutinize the man who had hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur will descend," a hoarse voice insisted.</p>

  <p>Tresholm was utterly taken by surprise and uncertain, for the moment, how
  to act. With his hand upon the door of the car stood a person of most
  ruffianly appearance, wearing a narrow black mask and holding an ugly-looking
  automatic. Not only that but a second man had appeared out of the shadows and
  was hanging on the other door.</p>

  <p>It is probable that, if Tresholm had not been dreaming and required
  several seconds to realize the position, his impulse to make a dash for it
  would have been successful. As it was, however, the opportunity had passed.
  His first assailant had him at his mercy, and the man who had clambered up
  behind was in a position to deal him a nasty blow on the top of his head.</p>

  <p>Tresholm reflected. He had little money with him, and he was unarmed
  Discretion was certainly indicated. He held up his hands</p>

  <p>"1 will descend," he agreed, "if you will wail while I draw to the aide of
  the road."</p>

  <p><i>"Vite!"</i> was the harsh command.</p>

  <p>Tresholm had every intention of keeping his word, but there was a most
  unexpected change in the situation. A flashlight illuminated the road. There
  was the report of a gun from behind, followed by another. The man who had
  accosted him dashed for the wood from which he had issued, followed by his
  companion, and the third, who had clambered into the coupé, leaped out and
  went down the ravine on the other side like a scared rabbit.</p>

  <p>Tresholm descended to find them all disappeared, and the <i>deus ex
  machina</i> a small two-seated car with dazzling headlights, which had
  evidently just turned the corner. In the middle of the road stood the slim
  figure of a woman, with a pistol in her hand.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"></a></p><br>

  </div><br>

  <p>She nodded and beckoned him to her. He obeyed the summons, hat in hand.
  The twilight was merging into night, but the moon had scarcely yet risen. He
  saw her only indistinctly, but he gathered she was young, and, to all
  appearance, French.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "I am grateful for your arrival."</p>

  <p>"One is foolish to travel along this road at night without being prepared
  for trouble," she remarked. Monsieur is probably a tourist, or he would have
  known that."</p>

  <p>"It is true," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"You are hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Not a scratch."</p>

  <p>"Or robbed?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, thanks to you, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him for a moment intently, almost, he thought,
  inquisitively.</p>

  <p>He saw now that her eyes were dark and her features regular. She was
  sufficiently good-looking, but her appearance was spoiled by a lowering,
  almost sulky expression. She seemed to resent his presence, to resent having
  been under the necessity of offering aid. Her voice only was pleasant.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur speaks French so well," she said coldly, "that I am in doubt as
  to his nationality."</p>

  <p>"I am English. My name is Tresholm, and I am staying at the Hotel de
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"You are the eccentric," she asked, "who registered here as a professional
  gambler?"</p>

  <p>"My little joke," he apologized.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she went on, "you must have had some reason for what you
  did. You gamble at times, yes?"</p>

  <p>"Now and then," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"<i>Piquet</i>, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>For a moment, Tresholm was oppressed with a sense of unreality. An attack
  by footpads in the center of civilisation, a deliverer so unexpected, and a
  question so apparently pointless!</p>

  <p>What on earth could it matter to her or to anyone whether or not he played
  a somewhat neglected game? His companion appeared to realize his
  bewilderment; she stamped her foot and frowned at him impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Please do not think that I am a crazy woman," she begged. "I have a
  reason for asking you such a question. Now will you please listen to me. You
  are Mr. Tresholm. Very well. You will admit that I have been of some service
  to you."</p>

  <p>"A service for which I am greatly obliged," he assured her. "I should
  certainly have lost my temper and my money, if nothing else, but for your
  opportune arrival."</p>

  <p>"Well, you shall do something for me in return," she said, still without
  the vestige of a smile, or any note of graciousness in her tone. "You will do
  me the favor of accompanying me to the villa where I live, which is near
  here, and taking either a whisky and soda or a cocktail before you
  proceed."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," he acquiesced.</p>

  <p>She stepped back into her car and took her place at the wheel. "Will you
  follow me, please?" she asked, "I would ask you to drive with me, but I see
  that you have no chauffeur."</p>

  <p>The two-seated car moved slowly on, with Tresholm behind. Just before
  reaching the outskirts of Monaco, the girl extended her hand, and they turned
  down one of the narrow roads which connect the Lower and Upper Corniche.
  After a few hundred yards' descent her hand went out again, and she turned
  between two broken-down gates, along an unkempt cypress-bordered drive, until
  they reached a deserted-looking villa. The façade was weather-stained and
  shabby. Its rows of windows were like great glaring eyes, uncurtained; the
  gardens were desolate; the whole place had an unkempt and forsaken
  appearance.</p>

  <p>The girl descended from her car, and in obedience to her gesture, Tresholm
  followed her into an ill-furnished room upon the ground floor.</p>

  <p>"A quarter to seven," the murmured, as though to herself. "Monsieur
  Tresholm, it is very hind of you to pay me this little visit"</p>

  <p>"If I can be of any service," he ventured, more than ever puzzled.</p>

  <p>"You may be," she answered. "I cannot tell. It depends upon what manner of
  man you are. You seem to have courage, although you let yourself be rescued
  from footpads by a girl."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I submitted to the inevitable, Mademoiselle,"
  he replied.</p>

  <p>She placed a bottle of whisky, a siphon and a glass upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of this villa before, Mr. Tresholm? Do you know who I
  am?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I must confess my ignorance."</p>

  <p>"Well, they talk about us sometimes," she remarked,&mdash;"not very
  favorably. This is supposed to be a place to avoid. I live here with my
  father. He is supposed to be a man with whom you should have nothing to do.
  You are sure that you have not heard of us?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"My name is Brignolles&mdash;Lucie Brignolles."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I am sorry," he confessed, "but the name is unfamiliar
  to me."</p>

  <p>"You never heard of either of us?"</p>

  <p>"The other one being&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"My father&mdash;Monsieur Brignolles."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, no. You must remember that you yourself correctly
  described me as a tourist"</p>

  <p>"So much the better," she declared. "I will tell you about my father
  before we begin. You call yourself a professional gambler. An effort at
  humor, I should imagine, for you seem prosperous. My father is also a
  professional gambler. Unfortunately, the occasion is rare nowadays when he
  can find anyone to play with him. His reputation is none too good. He is
  barred from the Casino. We have no friends. Are you listening?"</p>

  <p>"I have beard every word," ho assured her.</p>

  <p>She looked across at him gloomily. He thought that he never had seen a
  more sullen expression in his life. Even the beauty of her eyes was
  marred.</p>

  <p>"My father has ill health," she went on. "He cannot live very long. He has
  only one passion, and that is to play cards and to rob anyone who plays with
  him. I have to tell you this, but I am his daughter, and my sympathies are
  entirely with him as against any tool whose money he can take. I have been to
  Nice to try to find someone to come and play <i>Piquet</i>. He is quite
  invincible at <i>Piquet</i> He can win just as much money as his opponent
  chooses to play for. Will you play with him?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I will," Tresholm accepted, with a queer little smile. "I must
  warn you that I am rather good at the game myself."</p>

  <p>"You could not succeed against my father, because he cheats," she rejoined
  curtly. "Nevertheless, it will probably make his last few days happier, if he
  can win some money from you. Can you afford to lose?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly can," Tresholm assured her.</p>

  <p>"You are wealthy?" she insisted.</p>

  <p>"Sufficiently."</p>

  <p>"Remember," she told him, "you are fully warned. You will not complain
  afterwards ?"</p>

  <p>"I give you my promise," he replied, "that I will submit to whatever may
  happen to me."</p>

  <p>She produced another siphon of soda-water and set out a card-table. "You
  need not he afraid of the whisky and soda," she said dryly. "This is a
  gambler's den, but that is the end of it. You are here to be cheated, but the
  drinks are all right. Sit there, please, and wait while I fetch my father.
  Your solitude will give you an excuse to escape if you are afraid."</p>

  <p>He opened the door for her and she passed him as though utterly
  unconscious of his presence. Tresholm resumed his seat with a little grin. He
  loved adventure. Although he had a sort of instinctive confidence in the
  ungracious young woman who had just left him, he fully realized that he might
  very well find himself involved is a singularly unpleasant adventure. He
  waited for her return, however, without any feeling of apprehension. Very
  soon, he heard footsteps. She opened the door and entered.</p>

  <p>Leaning upon her arm was a tall, emaciated-looking man whose suit of
  ancient gray tweeds hung loosely upon his shrunken figure. It needed only a
  glance into big face to convince Tresholm that the girl had been right about
  his health.</p>

  <p>"This is my father," the girl announced shortly. "Mr. Tresholm. A
  gentleman staying down at Monte Carlo. He will play <i>Piquet</i> with you
  for an hour."</p>

  <p>"Very good of him, I am sure&mdash;very good," the old man declared, as he
  extended a skinny hand. "Pleased to welcome you, Mr.&mdash;what did you say
  his name was, girl?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>She spelled it out with care.</p>

  <p>"Tresholm," he murmured. "Quite a good name. Very kind of you to give me a
  game, sir. Will you sit there? I have brought the cards."</p>

  <p>He laid two packs of cards and some markers upon the table, and lowered
  himself, assisted by his daughter, into the chair. He commenced shuffling,
  and Tresholm watched his long fingers, fascinated. One part of the man, at
  least, retained its old nimbleness.</p>

  <p>"What points do you care to play, sir?" the old man asked.</p>

  <p>"I am in your hands," Tresholm replied.</p>

  <p>"Would twenty-franc points seem too much?"</p>

  <p>"I could manage that," Tresholm agreed. "I should warn you, sir, that
  although I have not played lately, I am supposed to be rather good."</p>

  <p>The old man looked across at him without expression in his face.</p>

  <p>"There is no one in the world," he said, "who can beat me at
  <i>Piquet</i>"</p>

  <p>They cut for deal. Monsieur Brignolles won.</p>

  <p>"It is permitted to smoke?" Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," the girl acquiesced, "so long as you have your own
  cigarettes. We have nothing. We have just that bottle of whisky and some
  soda-water, in case we can find anyone foolish enough to come and play."</p>

  <p>"And your father?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "He neither drinks nor smokes," she confided. "His
  state of health does not permit it."</p>

  <p>Whatever Monsieur Brignolle's state of health may have been, his mentality
  Tresholm decided, after the first few games, remained unimpaired. He
  discarded with brilliant intuition, and he played his cards unerringly.
  Tresholm for the first time found himself outclassed. He lost with better
  hands; he lost heavily with bands of equal value. Each time his opponent drew
  as though inspired. The last card was scarcely played before he was preparing
  for the next hand. It was as though he played for a great stake, and against
  the clock.</p>

  <p>The girl did the scoring, and every time she passed the sheet to Tresholm
  for his inspection, she did so with a half-malicious, half-triumphant
  smile.</p>

  <p>"You must say when you would like to leave off, Mr. Tresholm," she
  remarked once.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tresholm must have his revenge," her father squeaked hastily. "It is
  not for you to interfere."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you one thing, Mademoiselle Brignolles," Tresholm confided.
  "Your father is not only the finest piquet player whom I have ever
  encountered, but I can assure you that he is also the finest player in the
  world. I have never seen such intuition. One could imagine that he might be
  one of those rare people in the world who can see through the back of the
  cards."</p>

  <p>The girl shot one malign glance at him and did not speak again until the
  next game was finished. Tresholm glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of being late for your dinner?" she asked, with a note of
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least." he assured her. "I only looked at the watch to be
  certain that I should not be. If I leave here in another half-hour, that will
  suit me admirably."</p>

  <p>"If you are sure you can afford it," she mocked, "Prosperity has come to
  the house. I see that you already owe nineteen milles."</p>

  <p>"I must economize in other directions," Tresholm replied. "At any rate, I
  am having a wonderful lesson at the game."</p>

  <p>They played on in silence. The old man shivered every now and then, as
  though affected by an ague, but the cards left his hand with uncanny
  precision.</p>

  <p>In the intervals between the deals Tresholm ventured to glance around, and
  it seemed to him that he never before had sat in such a terrible room. The
  color-wash was peeling off the walls. There was dust upon the frames of the
  few hideous pictures. There was not a whole article of furniture in the room.
  To make matters more uncomfortable, there was a fire of huge logs burning
  upon the hearth, and not a single window open, but although Tresholm felt his
  cheeks burn and his forehead become damp, his host's face never changed in
  its waxen pallor. A sudden vigorous distaste of his surroundings, the
  ugliness it all, the terrible old man, the sullen girl got on Tresholm's
  nerves. He began to make mistakes in playing his cards and suffered for them
  severely. The girl smiled maliciously.</p>

  <p>"Only ten minutes longer," she consoled him. How glad you will be to go.
  Never mind, worse might have happened, if I had left you to the robbers on
  the hill."</p>

  <p>"The game is very interesting," Tresholm assured her, speaking with an
  attempt at lightness. "I am outclassed, but so would anyone else be."</p>

  <p>She shivered palpably. Her father's long, nervous fingers were toying with
  the cards which remained in the little pack. He drew them out one by one,
  glanced back at his own hand and hesitated. Finally he discarded, throwing
  three cards only, instead of five, to which he was entitled. Tresholm, when
  the last card fell upon the table, had lost more than in any previous
  game.</p>

  <p>The girl began to add up the scores. Her father looked over her shoulder,
  checking the totals. When she had finished, she looked at them in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how much you have lost, Mr. Tresholm?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Quite a good deal, I am afraid," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You have lost thirty-one thousand francs," she announced.</p>

  <p>"As much as that?" he rejoined coolly.</p>

  <p>"Have you the money in your pocket?" the old man asked, with a note of
  nervous harshness quavering in his voice. "If not, my daughter had better
  return to the hotel with you."</p>

  <p>"I never carry more than a few milles," Tresholm replied. "I have my
  check-book."</p>

  <p>"Where do you bank?" Brignolles asked.</p>

  <p>"Here in Monte Carlo"</p>

  <p>The old man's face cleared. "If you have not the money, I must take a
  check then. Lucie, fetch pen and ink."</p>

  <p>She placed writing materials upon the table, and Tresholm wrote out a
  check</p>

  <p>While he was filling in the counterfoil he was conscious of someone
  looking over his shoulder. He turned around and met the old man's greedy
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"But what a balance!" the latter declared breathlessly. "You are a rich
  man, Mr. Tresholm?"</p>

  <p>"I have enough for my needs," was the quiet reply.</p>

  <p>The girl threw open the door. "What does it matter to us whether Mr.
  Tresholm is rich or not?" she demanded. "He has enough to pay his debt." His
  debt?" Tresholm murmured. She looked at him with challenge in her eyes. The
  old man shuffled across to the cupboard and took out a glass and a bottle.
  The girl swung around. "Come this way," she enjoined. "I will see you out."
  They passed down the wretched little hall, and she opened the front door.</p>

  <p>Well," Tresholm said, "many thanks for saving me from the bandits."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to thank me for," she rejoined curtly. "You paid, all right."</p>

  <p>She closed the door, and Tresholm drove away from the place with an
  infinite sense of relief. The girl returned wearily to the shabby little
  room. Before she reached the door, she heard her father calling her. He was
  standing at the table with a pack of cards in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Lucie," he cried, "where is the other pack?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I do not know," she answered.</p>

  <p>"It is gone!" the old man shrieked. "Do you suppose&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>She searched the table, turned the box upside down, looked everywhere
  feverishly. Then they faced one another&mdash;father and daughter.</p>

  <p>"He has taken it away!" the former groaned. "Stop him, Lucie!"</p>

  <p>She listened to the sound of Tresholm's horn as she turned from the avenue
  into the road.</p>

  <p>"Too late!" she muttered. "You may as well tear up the check, Father."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At eleven o'clock on the following morning, the girl stood in the road
  below the bank and watched the great doors roll slowly back. She looked in
  her bag. The check was safely there. She closed it, turned her back upon the
  Boulevard des Moulins and slowly entered the gardens. She chose a secluded
  seat and sat there in what seemed to be a sort of apathetic stupor. After
  some time she rose, left the gardens by the lower exit, and looked up at the
  Casino clock. It was exactly eleven.</p>

  <p>She crossed the road, sat down at one of the tables outside the Café de
  Paris, and ordered a cup of coffee. At half past eleven she paid for her
  coffee and mounted the hill. At five-and-twenty minutes to twelve she crossed
  the portals of the bank. She made her way to the nearest cashier's window,
  unfastened her bag, and produced the check. As she handed it across, she felt
  her heart give a great throb. For a single moment the man's face before her
  was blurred; everything in the bank was hazy. Then she came to. She was
  herself again. Even the sullen expression had returned. She was like any
  ordinary customer waiting for her money.</p>

  <p>"Would like any small change, Madame?" the cashier asked.</p>

  <p>"A little please," she answered, not too steadily.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the check once more. Then he counted rapidly through three
  packets of ten-mule notes pinned together, pushed them across the counter,
  and added a mille in hundreds and fifties. The girl stuffed them into her
  bag. She walked a little uncertainly towards the door. Then she came face to
  face with Tresholm, who was talking to the bank manager. She gave one little
  gasp, but recovered swiftly. She was passing on when he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mademoiselle," he said. "I hope you found that I had
  enough money to meet your fathers check."</p>

  <p>The bank manager laughed. An excellent joke. The girl looked at Tresholm,
  and for a moment he was startled. There was a curious new quality in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Could I speak to you for a moment?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly." he acquiesced.</p>

  <p>Ho opened the door for her and nodded his farewell to the manager. She led
  the way across the road to the gardens.</p>

  <p>"How is your father this morning?" Tresholm asked politely.</p>

  <p>"He is well as he is likely to be," was the toneless answer. "Do you mind
  sitting down here; I wish to ask you a question."</p>

  <p>He seated himself by her side, immaculate in his white flannels, his
  pongee coat and the carnation is his buttonhole. In the rather pitiless
  sunlight, the shabbiness of her own clothes, well-cut thought they were, was
  a little pathetic.</p>

  <p>"I want to know why you did not stop payment of that check," she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Stop payment of the check?" he repeated. "But why should I? I lost the
  money." "Yes, you lost the money," she agreed, But&mdash;" She paused
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"If you thought I was going to stop payment of it," he asked, "why weren't
  you here on the steps at ten o'clock this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I was," she confessed. "That was what I was supposed to do&mdash;to cash
  it as soon as the doors were opened. I thought I would give you a chance
  though. I waited."</p>

  <p>"Very sporting of you!" he murmured. "Anyhow, I never meant to stop
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she persisted. "You know that you were cheated; you know that
  my father was playing with marked cards. You even brought them away with you
  as evidence!"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady!" he expostulated. "You haven't your facts correctly,
  and you seem to have an entirely wrong view of the situation. It is true that
  I brought away a pack of your father's cards last night, but that was simply
  because I thought he was better without them. Besides, didn't I own up to
  being a professional gambler? I am always interested in the appurtenances of
  my profession."</p>

  <p>"I do not believe that you are a professional gambler at all," she
  declared, with a sudden flame of anger in her face and tone.</p>

  <p>"But I can assure you that I am," he pleaded earnestly. "Everyone who
  comes to Monte Carlo and signs his papers at a hotel has to have a
  profession. That is mine. Now, I don't went to seem unsociable," he went on,
  "but don't you think you ought to be getting home? Your father will be
  uneasy."</p>

  <p>She opened her bag and dashed the little pile of notes upon the ground
  between them.</p>

  <p>"You knew you were being cheated!" she cried passionately. "You knew that
  you had no chance. You lost that on on purpose. It was charity."</p>

  <p>"Young lady, it was nothing of the sort," he insisted. "I thoroughly
  enjoyed the experience. Your father's skill at the game, to begin with, is
  phenomenal; his technique in those other matters was also amazing."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, will you!" she sobbed. "One has to suffer enough without such
  gibes."</p>

  <p>"Now please be reasonable," he begged. "I assure you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then, for a moment he broke off and affected to be busy lighting a
  cigarette. When he was prepared to resume the conversation, the young woman's
  breathing was a little more normal, and she had disposed of her
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Within a few feet of them, the uniformed garden attendant was standing.
  His eyes were glued on the packet of notes.</p>

  <p><i>"Quelque chose est tombée, monsieur,"</i> he pointed out. Tresholm
  peered at the notes through his eye-glass.</p>

  <p><i>"Ça n'est pas à moi,"</i> he declared, with a little gesture of
  abnegation.</p>

  <p>The man turned to the girl. <i>"À mademoiselle, peut-être?"</i> he
  suggested, pointing to the money.</p>

  <p><i>"Ça ne m'appartient pas,"</i> she echoed.</p>

  <p>The man drew a little nearer to the notes. There was a gleam of cupidity
  in his eyes. Tresholm's foot fell gently upon them.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said, "believe me, the young lady is mistaken. The notes
  are hers. I saw them fall from her bag. Owing to a slight difference of
  opinion between us, she refuses to pick them up. I, too, am obstinate."</p>

  <p>He passed across a hundred-franc note, and the keeper at once decided that
  a hundred francs in the hand were worth more than a bundle of mille notes
  upon he ground.</p>

  <p><i>"Monsieur est très gentil,"</i> he murmured and departed.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mademoiselle," Tresholm continued, "to leave those notes on the
  ground there may eventually result in trouble. If our friend had been a
  gendarme, for instance, we might have been marched off to the
  <i>commissaire</i> to account or the singular fact that we are sitting with a
  bundle of mille notes between us which neither of us will touch.</p>

  <p>"Now, I will set you a good example," he added, coolly possessing himself
  of her bag, picking up the notes, unfastening the clasp and dropping them in.
  "That I trust, will be the first step," he concluded, "towards our complete
  reconciliation. You will not deny that the <i>sac</i> is yours."</p>

  <p>The bag lay upon the girl's knees. She said nothing. She was suddenly very
  white. Is her eyes was vacancy, and yet, when he ventured to look towards
  her, was it his fancy, or were there unfathomable depths of wistfulness
  lurking, there?</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said gently, "why make the world a gloomier place than
  it is? It should be a place, you know, where human beings take pleasure in
  helping one another and in receiving help. The fates have made me, through no
  merit of my own, a very rich man. I have few pleasures. One you can give me
  by picking up that bag and shaking hands with me and mentioning no more that
  ugly word 'charity,' because, after all, remember that is a phrase ill-used
  by all of us. You permit?"</p>

  <p>Almost before she knew what was happening, he had risen to his feet. He
  raised her fingers to his lips&mdash;very well-shaped and carefully tended,
  he saw they were&mdash;and, with a little smile of farewell, he passed on.
  The girl remained in her place, her eyes following his departing figure, the
  bag clasped tightly in her hands.</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4">ONE NIGHT IN NICE</a></h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">An air of suspense hung over the gay town when
     rumors were spread of<br>
  mysterious happenings on board the battle-ship that lay in the harbor.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, Mar 1929<br>
  Syndicated by The Metropolitan Newspaper Service, New York, 1929</h3>
  <br>

  <p class="first">EARLIER in the day, Tresholm had brought his car to a
  standstill and had joined a crowd of people gazing down into the harbor of
  Villefranche, where a battle-ship lay anchored. The reason for their mild
  excitement was easily apparent. Instead of being surrounded by the usual
  stream of boats coming and going, the sea around the ship was deserted, the
  gangway was drawn up, and a flag was flying, which perhaps Tresholm alone
  among that little company rightly understood&mdash;the navy flag, warning off
  all visitors or tradespeople of any description. The only craft visible was
  the battle-ship's own pinnace, which had just left the landing-stage.</p>

  <p>Tresholm adjusted his field-glasses and studied the scene below. The two
  passengers who were being escorted on board were Monsieur Desrolles, the
  <i>Chef de Sûreté</i> at Monaco, and a companion whom Tresholm chanced to
  recognize as the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i> at Nice.</p>

  <p>Something had happened to disturb the serenity of life upon the
  battle-ship. His understanding of the flag, and his recognition of the two
  men in the pinnace helped him to realize the probable nature of the event. He
  watched the pinnace cutting through the water, leaving behind its trail of
  foam, watched the gangway let grudgingly down and the two visitors received
  on board, watched afterwards the immediate drawing up of the gangway and the
  sheering off of the pinnace. Then he drove on to Nice.</p>

  <p>It was a gay night at Maxim's, Nice's moat fashionable bohemian
  restaurant. The exhibition dancers never had been received with more favor.
  Tresholm, inclined to wonder why he had lingered on after a late dinner to
  the small hours of the morning, still felt no impulse to depart There were
  two people and one circumstance in the room which interested him&mdash;the
  girl with the misty eyes at the table opposite and the small man who was his
  left-band neighbor, a man with rather high color, a wizened face, hair as
  stiffly upright as porcupine quills. He was correctly dressed for the evening
  and he ate his supper with an <i>Éclaireur du Soir</i> propped up in front of
  him. These were the two people whom Tresholm, always observant of the world
  around him, had singled out as being of interest.</p>

  <p>The circumstance was another matter&mdash;a long table laid for fourteen,
  at the end of the room, which had been unoccupied all the evening and which
  was now being slowly and unwillingly dismantled. Tresholm leaned forward as
  the <i>maître d'hôtel</i> passed.</p>

  <p>"You are disappointed of some guests tonight, Louis?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"A party of officers from the battle-ship in Villefranche Harbor, sir,"
  the man confided. "Some of them visit here most nights, but this was to be a
  very special affair. The wine and the supper were ordered a week ago. It was
  the fête-day of the one who has been our best patron here."</p>

  <p>"The celebration has been postponed then?" Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>The <i>maître d'hôtel</i> approached a step nearer. "Monsieur has not
heard then
  of what has arrived?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing at all," Tresholm replied.</p>

  <p>The man leaned forward. "One knows nothing, though one bears sometimes
  wild stories," he said. "Leave from the battle-ship has been stopped. It is a
  pity, for the supper has been cooked. They will come another day."</p>

  <p>The man bowed himself away, and Tresholm, aware of the cause of his sudden
  reticence, continued his meal without remark. Presently he looked across at
  the opposite table. The girl with the misty eyes smiled at him slightly. With
  nothing in mind save the gratification of his almost impersonal interest, he
  rose to his feet and crossed the floor.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle will dance?" he invited.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle hesitated, and, it seemed to Tresholm, looked at his
  neighbor.</p>

  <p>Then she rose slowly.</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur wishes," she assented.</p>

  <p>The dance was a success, and as Tresholm led her back to her seat he was
  somewhat confident that his curiosity concerning her was justified.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle would care to share my table for a time?" he suggested. "We
  both seem to be alone."</p>

  <p>She demurred. "Sit with me for a few minutes," she begged, "I like this
  side of the room better.</p>

  <p>"Why do you prefer your table to mine?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is your neighbor," the confided. "I do not like him. He looks at me
  all the time. I know very well that if we talked together he would
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he, if it amuses him?" Tresholm rejoined, smiling. "We are
  not going to discuss secrets of state, are we?"</p>

  <p>The girl took out her vanity-case and dabbed at her lips.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have something to say to me," she ventured. "I do not know
  what it is, but I can guess. I would prefer that Monsieur did not hear; so, I
  should think, would you."</p>

  <p>Tresholm showed no signs of surprise at her unexpected speech. There had
  certainly been no thought of adventure in his mind when he had decided to
  stay her for dinner. Yet old habits were strong. At the first breath of it,
  he felt himself back in the old life. He was playing a part, even before he
  knew it.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to hear from me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She finished with her vanity-case and put at deliberately away. "You will
  probably ask me first where Arthur is," she said, with a faint smile. "After
  that, you will talk business."</p>

  <p>"Then where is Arthur?" Tresholm demanded.</p>

  <p>"In the Casino." She paused, expectant, for his next question. Then she
  caught the air of bewilderment in his face, and her own expression changed.
  <i>"Eh bien?"</i></p>

  <p>"It seems to me," Tresholm confessed, that this is where I break down.
  Shall we dance again?"</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged. She was evidently ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Tonight I am tired," she pleaded. "I prefer not to dance any more.
  Perhaps Monsieur had better return to his table. I am
  expecting&mdash;a&mdash;a friend."</p>

  <p>He rose. "I trust that I have not offended in any way."</p>

  <p>She looked at him keenly. "Only by seeming to be what you are not."</p>

  <p>She suddenly rose, and Tresholm became aware of one of the professional
  dancers standing at the table. She accepted his invitation to dance, and
  Tresholm returned to his place. His neighbor glanced up from the newspaper as
  he sat down, and addressed him in English, which showed only the slightest
  trace of a foreign accent,</p>

  <p>"Scarcely a success, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Tresholm admitted, concealing his surprise, "that I was not
  exactly popular with the young lady:"</p>

  <p>The little man dropped his eye-glasses, folded up his newspaper and leaned
  towards his companion.</p>

  <p>"Am I right in believing that your name is Tresholm," he asked, "and that
  when you registered at your hotel in Monte Carlo, you described yourself as a
  professional gambler?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Tresholm admitted. "An effort at humor which has led to
  several misunderstandings. The hotel clerk was persistent that I should fill
  in the space, and I could think of nothing else for the moment?"</p>

  <p>"Not being anxious to disclose your real profession," the other
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Having retired from it, whatever it may have been," was the swift
  rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"Retired?"</p>

  <p>"Formally and actually."</p>

  <p>"Then what are you doing her tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I am here entirely by accident."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know all that," was the somewhat impatient interruption. "With me
  it is unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"May I ask who you are?"</p>

  <p>"I will tall you," the other replied, "although I expect you know already.
  My name is Vigaud&mdash;Charles Vigaud&mdash;not unknown to the headquarters
  of the police here. Now, Mr. Tresholm we know one another. Presently I may
  have a suggestion to make to you. But wait. Things are about to happen."</p>

  <p>There was a disturbance at the door, a hurrying forward of the
  <i>vestiaire</i>, a vision of bowing waiters, a <i>maître d'hôtel</i>
hastening
  towards the place where the long table had been dismantled. Ten or twelve new
  arrivals were divesting themselves of hats and coats.</p>

  <p>Vigaud turned to Tresholm with a queer smile.</p>

  <p>"Our friends, the naval officers," he remarked. "The commander must be in
  a gracious mood."</p>

  <p>"Do they belong to the ship that was flying the warning-off flag?"
  Tresholm inquired.</p>

  <p>Vigaud nodded. "This has been their usual meeting-place for many nights,"
  he confided. "This morning all leave was stopped and they were not
  expected."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>The other shrugged. "A robbery on board, one hears."</p>

  <p>They came presently down the room&mdash;ten very presentable young men.
  They were popular, evidently, for shouts of welcome greeted them. The girl
  with the misty eyes alone looked down at her plate and never once glanced up
  as the long file trooped past her.</p>

  <p>Tresholm, happening by chance to notice the fact, watched the young men
  curiously. The first half-dozen, either by design or accident, ignored her
  completely. Towards the end of the procession, however, one of the
  youngest-looking of the officers glanced anxiously across at her table.</p>

  <p>Tresholm's gaze followed the lad curiously. He fancied there was a certain
  tenseness in his expression, shared by none of his companions. They took
  their places noisily. Vigaud chuckled.</p>

  <p>"An idea," he commented&mdash;"without a doubt an idea!"</p>

  <p>"What's it all about?" Tresholm inquired good-humoredly.</p>

  <p>His companion appeared to have become less communicative.</p>

  <p>"One asks oneself," he murmured.</p>

  <p>The young men from the battle-ship settled down to enjoy themselves, and
  no one was more swiftly uproarious than the youth whose entrance had
  attracted Tresholm's attention. Ladies with inclinations towards dancing
  seemed to arrive as though by magic from all directions. Every one of the
  party danced, including the boy. His partner, however, was a little,
  fair-haired Frenchwoman, from whose eyes he scarcely once looked away.
  Tresholm, who was intrigued by a situation which he utterly failed to
  understand, ordered another bottle of wine and postponed his intention of
  leaving. The girl with the misty eyes suddenly smiled across at him, with a
  little gesture of invitation. Tresholm hastened to her side, and she slipped
  eagerly into his arms.</p>

  <p>"But your hands are cold!" he exclaimed, as they swung down the room.</p>

  <p>"As cold as my heart, Monsieur&mdash;cold with fear," she answered.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"></a></p><br>

  </div><br>

  <p>He looked at her, puzzled. There was little doubt but that she was
  speaking the truth. Such natural color as she may have possessed had left her
  cheeks so completely that the rouge remained like an ugly daub upon her livid
  skin. Her body was quivering.</p>

  <p>"Come to the bar," she begged. "I am not fit to dance. I thought at first
  that you brought me a message from George. We had a little code
  arranged&mdash;that is of no consequence&mdash;you must help me. Indeed, you
  must help me."</p>

  <p>They sat on stools, and, with a whispered word of mingled excuse and
  injunction, she left him for a few moments, The barman leaned across the
  counter.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur knows the young lady well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I never saw her before this evening," Tresholm replied.</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur is ignorant of certain things," the man advised, "if he is
  concerned, he would do well to be careful. It is a night, this, when disaster
  might come.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew what you are talking about!" Tresholm exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The man leaned a little farther over the counter. He looked furtively to
  the right and to the left. Then suddenly he stiffened. Mademoiselle stood
  once more by Tresholm's side. She had washed the rouge from her face, and
  although she was terribly pale, she looked once more herself.</p>

  <p>"I have engaged a <i>salon privé</i>," she whispered. "Monsieur will come.
  I have something to say to him. He followed her down the passage, and the
  young barman looked after them anxiously. With a little sigh, the latter drew
  his account block from his pocket, scribbled a few lines upon one of the
  pages torn from it, and handed it to a gray-haired <i>maître d'hôtel</i>.</p>

  <p>The man nodded and made his way up the crowded room to where Tresholm's
  neighbor was still seated. He handed the note to him without a word, and
  slipped away. Vigaud adjusted his eye-glass and read the few lines carefully.
  Then he glanced across at the empty place opposite and shrugged. His bill was
  already paid, as though in expectation of some such emergency. He made is way
  through the throng and strolled out into the night.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tresholm was a man rarely ill at case, but a certain fineness of
  sensibility inspired in him a swift revulsion to his tawdry and meretricious
  environment.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "you must forgive me, but I find these
  surroundings distasteful. Unless you can offer me an immediate explanation of
  the service which you require from me, I must leave you."</p>

  <p>"I shall explain," she assured him quickly. "Have patience for a few
  moment, I beg."</p>

  <p>"At least, let me unlock the door," he begged.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she insisted. "There must always be that delay. Now I
  explain."</p>

  <p>He stood icily upon the other side of the table. She poured out two
  glasses of champagne, drank one and threw the other upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"You know my nationality," she began. "For the last few years there has
  been unrest in this part of the world. I speak both languages. I have many
  acquaintances. In the war I was in a government bureau."</p>

  <p>She paused to listen for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he invited, a little less coldly.</p>

  <p>"My instructions came to me a month ago, but first I had to wait for three
  weeks. Since then I have been working. There is a? battle-ship in the harbor.
  My task was to make friends with one of the officers. The ship is fitted with
  some secret device for resisting torpedoes. Half-way across the Atlantic she
  was submitted to tests&mdash;you understand, Monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well," Tresholm assented. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"The results of these tests," she continued, "were entered in the
  Admiral's private diary. My task was to obtain the page upon which the
  results were written, while he was in Toulon. I succeeded."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you haven't been hoaxed?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "A great deal was done for me," she confided. "On the
  first visitors' day someone whom I have never seen in my life took a wax
  impression of the key of the small cupboard where the diary is kept. The key
  was given to me four days ago. I gave it to my friend. Yesterday, he brought
  me the page, cut out."</p>

  <p>"Have you parted with it yet?"</p>

  <p>"They won't let me," she cried, almost hysterically. "I have been driven
  crazy. The French police are suspicious. They have not ventured to search my
  rooms, but there is an agent of the police outside my door who pretends to be
  a fireman, and they follow me in the street, so that I dare not post a letter
  or approach any of my intimates here. My telephone, I know, is guarded. I
  have been nearly crazy with anxiety. The man into whose hands I was to pass
  the page of the diary has been in the restaurant tonight, but I had to signal
  him to go away. Opposite me sits Vigaud, an agent of the French police. I am
  terrified."</p>

  <p>"Where is this page of the diary at the present moment?" Tresholm
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I have it with me," she confided. "I throw myself upon your generosity,
  Monsieur. My heart has ached ever since I did this thing. I repent. I sob at
  night with terror. That poor boy! I saw his face this evening"</p>

  <p>"You mean the tall youth at the end of the procession?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They tell me if it is discovered he will be shot. I want the page
  restored to him."</p>

  <p>"What would he the good of that?" Tresholm pointed out. "You can't cut a
  page out of a diary and replace it."</p>

  <p>"This is different," the told him eagerly. "The book is of a different
  fabrication. Each day of the week is on a separate page, with holes at the
  top through which two clips pass. The poor boy still has the key. He could at
  least take his chance of replacing it."</p>

  <p>"How are you going to communicate with him?"</p>

  <p>"I can't," she cried, "but you could."</p>

  <p>"Even if I did," Tresholm deliberated, "it seems to me long odds about his
  being able to replace it. Has anyone discovered it is missing?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, Monsieur, what has happened," she declared eagerly. "The
  Admiral's secretary, with whom he left his keys, had occasion to go to the
  safe. He found things disturbed. The alarm was given. The ship was isolated.
  Afterwards a search was made."</p>

  <p>"This one page from the diary?"</p>

  <p>"It was not noticed. The secretary&mdash;he decided that he had been
  mistaken in the disturbance of the papers. People were allowed once more to
  come and go from the ship as they willed, but tomorrow,
  Monsieur&mdash;tomorrow the Admiral returns. He will be told of the scare,
  and he will search for himself. It must be returned before midday
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>She listened for a moment with the old terror in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I had a letter from that poor boy this morning&mdash;a pathetic letter.
  If only he knew how I longed to give him back the page! No harm has been
  done. Not a soul has seen it. Nevertheless, when the Admiral returns, a
  report of the scare will be made to him and the theft will be discovered.
  George will be suspected first of all, because he is the Admiral's nephew and
  is allowed access to the cabin. Poor boy, he is not of the nature of those
  who conspire. He will break down. He will confess. He will be shot."</p>

  <p>Tresholm stood considering the problem.</p>

  <p>"You are my hope!" she cried. "Directly you came in, my heart, gave a
  leap. You were pointed out to me at Monte Carlo. They told me that you were a
  great gambler. Take the risk, Monsieur. You will save this boy's life. You
  are English. So little can happen to you. Ah!"</p>

  <p>She sprang away. Down the passage came footsteps, which in their very
  tread seemed grim and official. To Tresholm she behaved like a madwoman. She,
  flung herself upon the couch, pulled off her stockings and concealed them
  beneath the cushions. Then she burst into a senseless fit of gay but
  hysterical laughter.</p>

  <p>Then there came the knocking at the door&mdash;a brief, imperative
  knocking. She answered,, Her voice was stifled&mdash;angry, but not
  terrified.</p>

  <p><i>"Qui est là?"</i></p>

  <p>"Open the door, in the name of the police," was the stern reply.</p>

  <p>She unlocked the door and stepped back with a little cry. A very
  official-looking inspector of police had entered, followed by two gendarmes.
  They closed the door behind them.</p>

  <p>The inspector addressed himself to Tresholm:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said, politely, "I demand pardon for this unusual
  intrusion, but a grave theft has been committed in the neighborhood, and this
  lady is under suspicion."</p>

  <p>"You arrest me?" she shrieked.</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p><i>"Pas forcement!"</i> the inspector replied. "If this gentleman and you
  will submit yourselves to a search, and the missing property is not found on
  either of you, our disagreeable duty will be completed."</p>

  <p>"But how impossible!" she exclaimed. Search me&mdash;a woman? It is
  incredible!"</p>

  <p>"We have a female attendant outside," was the civil response, "and an
  empty room."</p>

  <p>She scowled at him, and then turned to Tresholm.</p>

  <p>"I ask a thousand pardons, <i>cheri</i>," she said. "Shall we humor this
  man and then perhaps we shall be left alone?"</p>

  <p>"I am at your disposal," he conceded.</p>

  <p>The gendarme unlocked the door, and Mademoiselle passed out into the care
  of a woman who was waiting in the passage. Tresholm divested himself of his
  outer garment, handed over his belongings and saw every pocket of his clothes
  being turned inside out. After an even closer search of his person, the
  official saluted. "A thousand pardons. Monsieur." he apologized courteously.
  Permit me to play the part of valet. I trust we are more fortunate with the
  lady."</p>

  <p>"What is this missing property?" Tresholm inquired.</p>

  <p>"A packet of a hundred mille," the man answered glibly.</p>

  <p>Tresholm smiled. "A great deal of money," he remarked, helping himself to
  some of the wine and passing the bottle towards the inspector.</p>

  <p>In due course the door opened, and the woman searcher returned with her
  charge. A glance between the former and the inspector was sufficient.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Mademoiselle demanded angrily, "we may now be allowed to finish
  our wine."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to prevent it. Mademoiselle," was the inspector's
  regretful reply, as he saluted and took his leave.</p>

  <p>The door was closed and locked. Mademoiselle listened to the retreating
  footsteps, her hand still upon the key. Her face was drawn, and dark rims
  were forming under her eyes.</p>

  <p>"But this is terrible," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better put your stockings on?" Tresholm suggested.</p>

  <p>She continued to listen for a moment. Then she stole back to the couch and
  drew out the stockings from beneath the pillows and pulled them on.</p>

  <p>"The safest of all hiding-places," she murmured.</p>

  <p>She held up her foot. He leaned forward and felt the sole. There was
  something stiff there.</p>

  <p>"They are beautifully made by a friend at Lyons," she confided. "No one
  would ever believe that there is a double sole. And you&mdash;you consent now
  to help me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best," Tresholm promised.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The two cars full of noisy sailor boys were bought to an unexpected halt
  at the commencement of the dark descent to the Villefranche Harbor. A
  long-bonneted two-seater was slewed across the road, completely barring
  progress.</p>

  <p>Tresholm advanced out of the shadows. With his hat pulled over his
  forehead and his coat-collar turned up, he was quite unrecognizable.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he apologized, "I didn't see the bend, put on my brakes too soon,
  skidded round and stalled my engine. If you fellows wouldn't mind pushing me
  off the road, I'll get her going somehow or other."</p>

  <p>They all tumbled out good-naturedly enough. In the darkness Tresholm
  managed to slip a pocketbook into the young man's hand.</p>

  <p>"No more of this confounded foolery, mind," he whispered.</p>

  <p>The boy looked around. They were well behind the others.</p>

  <p>"I swear there won't be, sir," he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Think you'll get it back all right?"</p>

  <p>"Certain," was the confident reply. "Tell you what, sir&mdash;you really
  want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you've given me a lot of trouble tonight," Tresholm acknowledged.
  "I's like to feel that it wasn't for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Stop on the hill, sir, just before the bend. My pal's on signalling duty
  tonight. I'll send you three white flashes as soon as the job's done. He'll
  think it's for a little girl we know at Cap Ferrat."</p>

  <p>With a final push, the car was on the right road once more, its bonnet
  turned. Tresholm jammed on the brakes.</p>

  <p>They trooped back to their cars, and Tresholm, starting his engined,
  curiously enough, without trouble mounted the hill. At the top she swung into
  the side of the road and gazed downward.</p>

  <p>The shapes of the greet battle-ship and the three attendant gunboats were
  defined with curious accuracy by their brilliant line of lights. Everywhere
  was deep silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the signal came, somehow eloquently dramatic, significant of a
  catastrophe averted. Three times the brilliant white rays pierced the
  darkness. Tresholm slipped in the clutch and started off to complete his
  journey. Behind Mount Agel, the dawn, colorless as yet, was lightening the
  sky.</p>

  <br>

  <p>INSTALLED in an easy chair in a corner of that somberly lighted
  bar&mdash;a quaint contrast to the brilliantly illuminated, somewhat garish
  restaurant adjoining&mdash;Tresholm became suddenly tense, assailed by a wave
  of memories. He bent forward, his lean face strained, his eyes fixed upon the
  approaching figure.</p>

  <p>A strange flood of memories this&mdash;the pungent perfume of the Campagna
  herbs, the April sunlight flooding the plain, even to the outskirts the city,
  the dark and splendid outline of St. Peter's itself, the music of those hasty
  words, the longing of her dark eyes, then the thundering hoofs, the crack of
  the huntsman whip&mdash;off again into the mild distraction of the hunt! But
  oh, that perfume, how it clung!</p>

  <p>It was Lena who recognized him&mdash;a child when he had left Rome. She
  caught at the arm of her companion.</p>

  <p>"Margherita, see, It is Signor Tresholm!"</p>

  <p>He came forward then. The world of sweet fancies and memories had slipped
  back where it belonged. He smiled and raised her fingers to his lips.</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"
     name="pic9"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300371h-images/Tresholm09.jpg"

  </div><br>

  <p>"Princess," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"You, Andrew!" she replied.</p>

  <p>The seconds possessed their full measure of bitter sweetness. Lena claimed
  her few words, and the princess turned towards their companion&mdash;a
  somewhat weary-looking elderly man.</p>

  <p>"Duke," she said, let me present Mr. Andrew Tresholm&mdash;the Duca di
  Michani. Signor Tresholm was at his embassy in Rome when my husband
  interested himself in politics&mdash;five, six, alas, seven years ago."</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands.</p>

  <p>"I knew your chief very well, of course, Signore," the duke
  acknowledged.</p>

  <p>The princess turned to Tresholm.</p>

  <p>"You are not by any chance alone?" she asked.... "Yes? Then join us.
  Indeed, if you will, you will relieve me of some anxiety. Here, it is
  difficult to explain. This little enterprise of ours is undertaken much
  against my will. You would be of great assistance if you would join us."</p>

  <p>"I will do so with pleasure," Tresholm accepted. "I must warn you though,
  that I seldom dance."</p>

  <p>"Yet I seem to remember," the woman murmured, "when the music was to your
  fancy, there were few who danced like you."</p>

  <p>"It may be for that reason." he rejoined, "that today I dance but
  seldom."</p>

  <p>Arrived at their table, to which they were escorted by the manager and the
  head waiter, Lena floated away almost at once with her escort. The princess
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Lena is the sister of my heart" she acknowledged. "Always she
  understands. Now, before I bring myself to realize how happy it has made
  me&mdash;even this brief meeting&mdash;let me tell you of this embarrassment
  in which we find ourselves. I came here tonight because of it, in fear and
  trembling. With you, however, I feel safe."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, by all means," he begged and glanced at her.</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," she confided, "last month we announced Lena's engagement to
  Bartoldi."</p>

  <p>"I read of it," Tresholm murmured. "In spite of our vow not to write. I
  nearly sent you a line."</p>

  <p>"The affair seemed well enough. Bartoldi is poor, but Lena is rich. I knew
  little of the young man. Like most others, he was supposed to be gay. What
  would you have? He is only twenty-four. It was thought that marriage would be
  good for him. I begin to doubt it. Indeed, I am frightened."</p>

  <p>"Tell me exactly why," Tresholm suggested.</p>

  <p>"We discovered one thing&mdash;he is a gambler."</p>

  <p>"Just how do things stand at present?" Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>"Gastone, as I told you, is not rich," the princess explained. "He comes
  here as our guest. He brought with him a hundred thousand lire for gambling.
  He has lost that. He has drawn another hundred thousand lire from home, he
  has borrowed some from me, and tonight he has borrowed from Lena.</p>

  <p>"It is not only his money losses, but he himself is changing. Lena and I
  refuse to play at all, hoping that may have some effect. We came here last
  night with Michani and two other friends. Gastone arrived just as we were
  leaving. He behaved disgracefully. He quarreled with the man with whom Lena
  was dancing, and declared that until she was married she must dance with no
  one but him. He made a scene. I was much ashamed, and a little
  frightened.</p>

  <p>"Today he has obtained money somehow, and he is playing. As soon as he has
  lost it all, I fear that he will follow us here. He will, perhaps. make
  himself disagreeable. Last night he behaved like a madman. Ha wanted to fight
  a perfectly harmless youth with whom she was dancing."</p>

  <p>She broke off while Tresholm ordered supper and wine. Almost immediately
  Lena and her escort returned to the table. Conversation became gay. The duke,
  approving alike of the caviar and the champagne, unbent. He danced again with
  Lena. The princess looked at her companion, and a little smile parted her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"The dances are not the same, but the music&mdash;it remains. Andrew, you
  will dance with me?"</p>

  <p>They danced, and he was back again in the flood of memories. There were a
  few whispered words, but the silence had its tumultuous charm.</p>

  <p>When at last they sat down, it seemed to Tresholm that she was avoiding
  his eyes. Then suddenly she touched his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Bartoldi!" she exclaimed. "Look! In the doorway."</p>

  <p>Tresholm turned and met the gaze of the young man who had just entered.
  Bartoldi was very decorative, but he was not altogether sober. He stood
  there, gloomy, almost ferocious-looking. The princess waved. He approached
  with deliberate footsteps.</p>

  <p>"I looked for you in the club, he said. "It was arranged, I thought, that
  we should come here."</p>

  <p>The princess toyed with her fan.</p>

  <p>"At twelve o'clock, dear Gastone," she reminded him. "At one o'clock you
  were still playing. We persuaded the duke to be our escort, and I was
  fortunate enough to find here one of my dearest friends.... Mr. Andrew
  Tresholm&mdash;Prince Bartoldi."</p>

  <p>The greeting between the two man was of the slightest. There was a a
  smile, however, upon Tresholm's lips.</p>

  <p>"The prince occupies himself a great deal with the game," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"As yet, I have not played."</p>

  <p>"But surely you have been here for some time?" the princess asked.</p>

  <p>"Three weeks," Tresholm confessed.</p>

  <p>The young man was staring at him solemnly. "You have been here three
  weeks," he repeated, "and you have not yet entered the Casino or the Sporting
  Club?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>The music was once more alluring. Lena smiled at Bartoldi.</p>

  <p>"We dance, Gastone, yes?"</p>

  <p>The young man muttered something in Italian. Tresholm rose. "Perhaps you
  will honor me," he begged.</p>

  <p>She rose without hesitation. Bartoldi set down his glass.</p>

  <p>"Lena!"</p>

  <p>She affected not to hear him and would have hurried her partner off, but
  Tresholm lingered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Signor Tresholm," Bartoldi said, "I do not know who you are. The
  Signorina is my fiancée, and in Italy it is not the custom&mdash;"</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"
     name="pic10"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300371h-images/Tresholm10.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Pity we're in Monaco," Tresholm interrupted pleasantly, as he moved
  away.</p>

  <p>The princess leaned forward. "Gastone," she said, "it seems to me that we,
  who may be your new relatives, will have a little more to put up with than we
  expected. There is one thing, however, which I should never forgive, and that
  is your making yourself ridiculous before any dear friend of mine. You may
  make yourself at ease concerning Signor Tresholm. He is an Englishman of
  distinguished family who was in the Diplomatic Service of his country when I
  knew him. Continue your supper, please. You have lost again, I fear."</p>

  <p>"I have lost" the young acknowledged sullenly. "I have lost all the money
  I could scrape together, and all the money they would lend me at the bar.
  Never was anyone plagued with such accursed luck."</p>

  <p>"It is a little message from fate," the princess told him. "You are not
  meant to win. The man who plays against fate, playa hopelessly."</p>

  <p>"Women know nothing about gambling," Bartoldi declared savagely.</p>

  <p>"That may be why we win," was the suave rejoinder.</p>

  <p>Tresholm and his partner returned, and the supper-party drifted on without
  disaster. Towards its close, Tresholm found himself once more alone with his
  hostess. Lena and Michani were dancing, and Bartoldi had gone to the bar in
  search of an acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" the princess asked Tresholm suddenly. "I believe that
  Gastone is not so bad. It is just this gambling. And Lena, alas, adores him.
  Already he has borrowed all our spare money, and my hands are now tied. I
  have promised my husband I will lend him no more. What can one do with him?
  Advise me, dear friend."</p>

  <p>Tresholm smoked thoughtfully for a moment. "I will do what I can to help
  him. You have your car here? Very well. When you leave, the duke can escort
  you and your sister. I will propose to Prince Bartoldi that he and I walk to
  the hotel. If I fail with the young man, I can at least let you know at the
  end of four days what I think of him."</p>

  <p>"You are just as sweet to me as ever, dear Andrew," she whispered. "If
  only I had had the courage in those days!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Your place dear Margherita," he sighed, "was always In
  the great world."</p>

  <p>They left soon afterwards. On the pavement outside, Tresholm offered his
  cigarette-case to the young man.</p>

  <p>"Shall we walk?" he suggested. "It is only a few yards to the Paris, and
  Michani is sufficient escort for our hostess and the Signorina."</p>

  <p>The young man assented without graciousness.</p>

  <p>"Had bad luck at the tables, haven't you?" Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>"Infernal," was the disgusted assent. "It is all a matter of capital. I
  could have got it back, but I can't raise any more money. The old prince is a
  miser, my lawyer is in England, and not one of my friends is out here."</p>

  <p>"Upon certain conditions," Tresholm said, "I will be your banker to the
  extent of, say, a million francs."</p>

  <p>"I will pay any interest" the young men declared eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I am not concerned about interest," Tresholm assured him. "If I lend you
  this money, you will give me an I.O.U. and pay me back the exact sum,
  but&mdash;you won't like my terms."</p>

  <p>"The terms then, if you please."</p>

  <p>"It is now," Tresholm reflected, "Tuesday morning. The sum I mentioned
  will be at your disposal on Friday at midnight The terms are these: that
  between now and then you do not attempt to gamble; you do whatever I
  choose."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to ask that I do anything impossible during the four
  days?" the young man ventured.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever. Most of the time I shall spend with you."</p>

  <p>They turned into the Hotel de Paris.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," Bartoldi said. "It is so arranged then. Tomorrow
  morning, I am at your service."</p>

  <p>"Turn up at half past ten in tennis kit," Tresholm enjoined.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Bartoldi was a slow starter at tennis on the following morning, but
  improved considerably towards the close of the seance. Tresholm, who had won
  the first three sets, was obliged to fight hard for the fourth, and lost the
  fifth. They wandered off to the Royalty for cocktails with the princess and
  Lena, who had been interested spectators. The princess took Tresholm's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," she remonstrated. "I hear that you have offered to lend
  Gastone money, without any restrictions as to gambling."</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded. "He doesn't get it till midnight on Friday though," he
  reminded her, "and until then he's on his honor not to play at all."</p>

  <p>They drank their cocktails in the sunshine, and on a sudden inspiration
  motored out to Beaulieu for luncheon. Afterwards, the princess suggested a
  visit to Cannes, but Tresholm shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind," he begged, "Bartoldi and I want to go to the Sporting
  Club."</p>

  <p>The young man's eyes glittered. The Princess and Lena were astonished.</p>

  <p>"To the Sporting Club!" the latter exclaimed. "I thought Gastone was not
  to play till Friday."</p>

  <p>"We aren't going to play; we're going to look on," Tresholm confided.</p>

  <p>At a few minutes past four, the event for which Monte Carlo had been
  waiting took place. Tresholm mounted the steps of the Sporting Club,
  accompanied by Bartoldi, and turned into the Bureau.</p>

  <p>"Got to get my ticket," he explained.</p>

  <p>The young Italian stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that you haven't even taken a ticket out?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Haven't been in the place since I arrived," Tresholm confessed. "Come and
  sign for me."</p>

  <p>Tresholm's appearance caused a sensation. His ticket was made out by the
  senior clerk, while the junior one rushed to the telephone. The news spread
  in all directions. When they entered the rooms, the croupiers stood up and
  craned their necks with curiosity. The chef of the <i>plaque roulette</i>
  table covertly counted over his capital. The chef at the
  <i>trente-et-quarante</i> board sent at once for a supply of five-mille
  plaques. The man whose appearance had created such a sensation, however,
  entered the gambling-rooms modestly. He made no attempt to change any
  money.</p>

  <p>His companion stood with his hands in his pockets, his eyes on the
  board.</p>

  <p>"<i>Quatorze</i>," he groaned as the spin was concluded. "Signor Tresholm,
  let me have a mille. I must back seven and twenty-nine after fourteen."</p>

  <p>"What on earth for?" Tresholm demanded. "Under our conditions you are not
  playing."</p>

  <p>"And you? You will not play either?" Bertoldi asked.</p>

  <p>"No, not at present."</p>

  <p>The next number was thirty-four, the next thirty-five, the following one
  six.</p>

  <p>"You'd have lost your money, wouldn't you?" Tresholm remarked
  casually.</p>

  <p>"Look at that Dutchman," Bartoldi whispered. "He must have eighty mille
  there."</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded. "Clever fellow!" he murmured. "Let's watch some of the
  other tables."</p>

  <p>They wandered down to the far end of the room. When they came back the
  Dutchman at the <i>plaque</i> table was changing a bundle of mille notes.</p>

  <p>"Soon lost his eighty mille," Tresholm observed. "Jolly interesting, isn't
  it. Let's look at the <i>chemie</i>."</p>

  <p>The <i>chemie</i> game was dragging wearily along. At each table, the
  croupier glanced round almost wistfully at their approach. Tresholm remained
  blandly indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Time for our first cocktail," he suggested to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven!" the other replied.</p>

  <p>They sat down and smoked in a corner of the bar.</p>

  <p>"Queer thing at that table that's just broken up," Tresholm remarked.
  "Eight people went to cash their chips, and there wasn't a winner among them.
  <i>Cagnotte</i> had the lot. Jolly interesting to watch all the same! Drink
  up quickly, and we'll get back to the roulette."</p>

  <p>When the time came the young man rose unwillingly. Things at the table had
  changed. The Dutchman was nervously fingering the last of his mille notes. A
  newcomer had collected a pile of plaques. They watched for a time and then
  walked down to the other tables. When they came back the Dutchman had
  increased his stock by a few plaques. The newcomer was cashing mille
  notes.</p>

  <p>"Must play badly, these fellows, I think," Tresholm observed. "They never
  seem to keep it. Let's go over to the <i>Cercle Privé</i> for an hour.</p>

  <p>They strolled away.</p>

  <p>"Always gives me the hump, this place," Tresholm remarked. "To think that
  some of these broken-down, miserable-looking men and women were once decent
  folk. Came here, lots of them, with plenty of money, good homes and all the
  rest of it, and then set themselves to play against a certainty. Imbeciles,
  of course, but one can't help feeling sorry for them!"</p>

  <p>They wandered down to the <i>Salles Privées</i>.</p>

  <p>"There are a couple of <i>plaque</i> tables in the Schmit Room," Tresholm
  said. "Quite high play, I believe."</p>

  <p>Bartoldi followed his companion without enthusiasm. At first sight, one of
  his numbers appearing produced in him a fit of restlessness. After about an
  hour, however, he scarcely made an observation. Every now and then he glanced
  at the clock.</p>

  <p>They stayed for a quarter of an hour. It was Bartoldi who led the way out
  of the rooms. As they mounted the steps of the Hotel de Paris, Monsieur
  Robert the manager, came hurrying forward.</p>

  <p>"At last, Monsieur Tresholm, they tell me that you have entered the
  lists," he exclaimed. "What fortune? The Casino is perhaps mortgaged to
  you?"</p>

  <p>Tresholm smiled. I have just been looking on," he confided. "I haven't
  played."</p>

  <p>"You could watch and not play?" the other gasped.</p>

  <p>"Why not. I find it amusing enough."</p>

  <p>"All these people seem very interested in you," Bartoldi remarked
  curiously as they mounted in the lift.</p>

  <p>Tresholm smiled. "I have a reputation," he explained, "which as yet I have
  not attempted to justify."</p>

  <p>Dinner was distinctly a cheerful meal. Bartoldi was a little tired
  nervous, but he improved in humor and appearance as the evening went on. The
  princess was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand." she told Tresholm frankly. "Gastone tells me that
  instead of keeping him away from the gaming-rooms, you have pressed him to
  accompany you there, and on Friday you are lending him all that money.</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded. "I am gambling," he confessed.</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace. "You have the right to, without a doubt, but
  Gastone&mdash;he will only lose your money."</p>

  <p>"The luck may change."</p>

  <p>It was eleven o'clock before they left the dining-room, and everyone was
  in excellent humor. Lena turned towards Tresholm.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't we all go straight to that little Russian place an dance?"
  she suggested. "Gastone doesn't mind."</p>

  <p>"Just one hour at the Sporting Club first, please," Tresholm begged.</p>

  <p>"And I thought you didn't play," the princess intervened
  reproachfully,</p>

  <p>"It's a wonderful game to watch." Tresholm rejoined. They made their way
  through the passage silently. The princess drifted Into the <i>chemie</i>
  room. Tresholm, with his hand resting lightly upon Bartoldi's shoulder, took
  up his old position at the roulette table. There were more people playing and
  the gambling was heavier.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-nine!" the young man exclaimed irritably. "Oh, if only I could
  back the seven and the fourteen."</p>

  <p>Tresholm remained deaf. Twenty-five turned up, then nineteen, followed by
  twenty-seven. An English nobleman collected a great pile of ten-mille
  plaques.</p>

  <p>"Over two hundred thousand francs he's won while we've been standing
  here," Bartoldi murmured feverishly.</p>

  <p>"Let's watch the other table for a time," he suggested.</p>

  <p>They strolled around. In half an hour they returned. The Englishman was
  cashing a check. He looked up and nodded as Tresholm passed.</p>

  <p>"What's become of all those plaques," the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"All gone," was the frowning response. "They spin too quickly."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose that's it Tresholm agreed, half to himself. "They spin too
  quickly. They don't give you a chance to keep your winnings."</p>

  <p>Lena leaned forward and passed her arm through his. "Margherita wants to
  go," she pleaded. "Everyone feels like dancing tonight."</p>

  <p>"What about Bartoldi?" Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to go if you're ready," the young man assented, almost
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Just half an hour more," Tresholm stipulated.</p>

  <p>Even Bartoldi sighed with relief when they left the Sporting Club a short
  time later. There were still signs of strain about him, but he danced with
  spirit, and of his own accord inquired about the morrow's plans</p>

  <p>"Tennis at ten-thirty," Tresholm told him. "Two decent fellows want to
  make a foursome. And Thursday morning&mdash;what about a foursome at Mont
  Agel?"</p>

  <p>"I should love it," Lena declared. "Alas, it is so long since I played,"
  the princess sighed.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, we will give them a game," Tresholm promised....</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew just what your idea is, Andrew," she said to him a little
  later, when they were alone at the table. "Of course, I know that you have
  promised to lend Gastone some money, and that is what makes him agree to
  everything you suggest, but why don't you keep him away from the tables
  altogether? Surely that would be best. This afternoon the poor boy was
  standing there in agony."</p>

  <p>Tresholm nodded with satisfaction. "You noticed that too, did you?" he
  observed. "Good!. The young man is to have this money I promised him at
  midnight on Friday. After that I shall try to explain." "Dear Andrew," she
  begged, "Lena is so worried. She is afraid you don't realize what this
  gambling may mean to him."</p>

  <p>"You know that they call me here?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I know," she admitted&mdash;"'the professional gambler.' It was a
  <i>blague</i> of yours."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," he went on, "there is perhaps a little truth in it. As a
  professional gambler I must know something of the psychology of
  this&mdash;shall we call it habit or vice? I am the physician. Bartoldi is my
  patient You are the amateur who intervenes. Dear lady, shall we dance?"</p>

  <p>She came willingly enough into the clasp of his arms, and again he thought
  of those great bunches of Roman violets, their purple glint and their April
  fragrance.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tresholm glanced at his watch and passed his hand through the young man's
  arm. "Come into the bar, Bertoldi. It is midnight on Friday, and your period
  of probation is up."</p>

  <p>The young man, who had been looking down at the roulette table, turned
  around with alacrity. Tresholm led he way into the inner portion of the bar
  and drew out a packet from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Her you are," he announced. "There's a hundred mille in each of
  these&mdash;ten of them. Get as much fun as you can out of it. It ought to
  last you a few nights, at any rate."</p>

  <p>The young man smiled.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to believe in anyone's winning," Mr. Tresholm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dare say they do sometimes," was the casual reply. &mdash;"if they
  have to leave in a hurry just after a run of luck. We've been watching for
  four afternoons and four evenings, haven't we?"</p>

  <p>"Watching till I'm blamed sick at the sight of the ball," the young man
  declared vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Well, we haven't seen anyone who kept his winning, have we?" Tresholm
  observed.</p>

  <p>Bartoldi stopped a young man who was passing.</p>

  <p>"Here's the sixty mille I owe you, Françous," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is excellent," the other exclaimed as he pocketed the money. "You
  have been winning, yes?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't played for the last few days,"</p>

  <p>Bartoldi excused himself and made his way to the bar, summoning Joseph to
  a conference. Joseph approached, glum, and with regrets already framing
  themselves upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"I will take my I.O.U.'s, Joseph," his patron said. "Sixty mille, I
  think."</p>

  <p>The sun broke through the clouds. Joseph's famous smile illumined his
  face.</p>

  <p>"The I.O.U.'s are here, Monsieur le Prince," he said, producing them.</p>

  <p>Bartoldi tore them up. Tresholm was talking to the princess and Lena, who
  were just leaving the room with the Duca di Michani.</p>

  <p>"Margherita," Bartoldi announced, "I owe you fifty thousand. <i>Voilà</i>.
  And you, Lena, thirty thousand. You have room in your bag, I hope. Now I have
  only one creditor."</p>

  <p>"My dear Gastone!" the princess exclaimed. "Now I shall be able to play
  again."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that you wouldn't like to keep this a little longer?" Lena
  asked wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Not for a second." he assured her. "I was suggesting to the princess an
  hour or two at the Carlton," Michani proposed.</p>

  <p>"Well, we've gone there for several nights." Tresholm observed. "Tonight I
  think we ought to stay for a little time to see Prince Bartoldi play."</p>

  <p>Michani indulged in a significant grimace. There was distress in the
  princess's face. Nevertheless they trooped out to the roulette table. As
  though instinctively, Tresholm and his young companion stood where they had
  watched the game hour after hour for the last four days.</p>

  <p>Tresholm's eyes followed the whirling of the ball.</p>

  <p>"Nineteen," he announced, "I should never have thought of nineteen. What
  are you for, Bartoldi? Maximums on seven, fourteen, twenty-nine, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>Lena's hand stole through the young man's arm.</p>

  <p>"I may stand by you?" she whispered. "I do not disturb?"</p>

  <p>Tresholm was watching his companion closely. Bartoldi's attitude was that
  of a genuine spectator&mdash;if anything a trifle bored. He held a packet of
  notes in his hand, but he was whispering to Lena, and they both laughed. The
  he leaned forward and watched the croupiers.</p>

  <p>"What a silly game!" he exclaimed suddenly. "I say," he added, turning to
  Tresholm. "do you mind if we go on up to the Carlton? You and I have to play
  against those fellows at tennis tomorrow at half past ten, so we ought not to
  be too late."</p>

  <p>The little procession passed down the stairs, Lena's arm through her
  fiancé's, the princess's head close to Tresholm's.</p>

  <p>"But you are a magician, dear friend," she murmured.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Later in the evening they found themselves alone for a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Every since I knew you, dear Andrew," she said, "you've been helping
  people out of trouble. There was that second secretary who had an affair with
  Signor Catoni's wife. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't make me out too much of a busybody," he begged. "Dear Margherita,
  you permit?"</p>

  <p>"Margherita and nothing else, for always," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Then, Margherita," he went on, "believe me, this little episode has given
  me given me real pleasure. It is a hobby of mine to speculate upon human
  nature and its byways, of which gambling is one. I figured to myself that,
  after the first agony of watching a game of chance when one was hopelessly
  without the means of joining in, the flatness of it would begin to depress.
  That was my theory. Afternoon after afternoon, night after night, we watched
  that stupid mechanical toy, and every time the young man has become bored. At
  he suffered, but only for a short time. By comparison, the tennis we arranged
  for him, the golf, the companionship of your delightful Lena gained every
  hour in value. Tonight I am certain he was honest. The game did not attract
  him. I am proud of my patient."</p>

  <p>"And you, the physician!" she murmured. "Is there no one who can pay your
  fee?"</p>

  <p>Then the lights went down; shadows crept through the place. Without a
  word, they rose.</p>

  <p>"The last thing the true physician thinks of is his fee," Tresholm
  confided.</p>

  <p>Her lips almost brushed his in that subdued light. "So the patient has to
  offer," she whispered.</p>

     name="story6">THE GAMBLER'S ROAD</a></h2>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">A Final Reckoning</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>, May 1929<br>
  Syndicated by The Metropolitan Newspaper Service, New York, 1930</h3>
  <br>

  <p class="first">PIERRE GOURDAIN, son of the Niçois millionaire jeweler, and
  one of the young elegants of the Sporting Club at Monte Carlo, presented
  himself at the main <i>Bureau de Change</i> with only a weak effort at that
  immobility of expression which, in the life of the Casino, is counted part of
  the equipment of the chic gambler.</p>

  <p>Both his hands were filled with red plaques, and he had no sooner
  deposited them upon the desk than from his bulging pockets, he produced two
  more handfuls. The cashier spread them before him in rows of ten. Then he
  produced an incredible pile of mille notes, done up in series of tens. He
  turned them over with agile forefinger, pausing to examine more closely a
  small portion of them.</p>

  <p>"There is some sealing-wax on the backs of these," he pointed out.
  "Monsieur objects?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," the young man assured him.</p>

  <p>The forty-six packets were transferred to to the pocket of the fortunate
  young man. The cashier leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur returns to Nice tonight?"</p>

  <p>The young man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur will play tomorrow night?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt. While the Sporting Club is open, I play nowhere
  else."</p>

  <p>The Gourdains were a well-known local family, and the cashier was a born
  Monegasque. He leaned forward once more.</p>

  <p>"Why not leave a portion of the money, Monsieur Gourdain?" he suggested.
  "You can collect it when you arrive tomorrow."</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Why should I do that?" he protested "My banker thinks that I gamble
  heavily. Tomorrow I shall show him: I shall deposit half, and bring the
  remainder away with me. He will believe then that it is possible to win."</p>

  <p>"Four hundred and sixty thousand francs is a great deal of money take to
  Nice at three o'clock in th morning," the cashier warned him.</p>

  <p>"Why, my friend," the young man expostulated, "this is one of the safest
  roads of Europe. Besides, in car at a hundred kilometers an hour what can be
  done? I stop for no one That I can promise."</p>

  <p>There was a rush of business, and the fortunate gambler passed on. He
  lingered at the bar for a word with Joseph and a final whisky-and-soda. The
  popular barman leaned across the counter.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has had good fortune tonight?"</p>

  <p>Pierre Gourdain smiled. "Good enough to ask you to take one of those boxes
  of cigars home with you, Joseph."</p>

  <p>"That is very kind of Monsieur," was the grateful acknowledgment "But
  Monsieur Gourdain. why not leave some of your winnings with me? It goes into
  the safe, or I can get you a Casino check."</p>

  <p>"What on earth for? I am going straight back to Nice and, as you see, I
  am, as always, sober."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," was the reply; "but the road between here and
  Nice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, it is the safest in the world!" the young man interrupted. "I have
  never heard anything more than a rumor of any attempt at robbery."</p>

  <p>"<i>Écoutez</i>, Monsieur Gourdain," Joseph begged eagerly. "Up till last
  week, yes; since last week, even the night before last, there has been
  trouble on the road."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Robbery?"</p>

  <p>Joseph nodded. "There is an American who was robbed of fifty thousand
  francs&mdash;as yet he is not able to ex- plain how."</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing of this," Pierre Gourdain declared.</p>

  <p>"No?" Joseph remarked meaningly. "Do we hear much of what happens in Monte
  Carlo, save of the galas, and the brilliant crowd at the Sporting Club, and
  the great winnings? Nevertheless, this is the truth. Besides the American,
  there was a man found dead two mornings ago, in the road near Cap d'Ail. and
  not a sign or a word as to how he got there&mdash;a man in evening clothes,
  with empty pockets. What does one think? I ask you, Monsieur Gourdain."</p>

  <p>"Who is to know, Joseph," Gourdain asked him, "that I leave here tonight
  with money?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Gourdain," Joseph confided. "It has been said that there are
  spies about here; that when a large win comes to anyone out of Monte Carlo,
  like yon, the news is passed on by telephone. I speak more than I should,
  perhaps, but I have my Ideas."</p>

  <p>One of the perambulating deities of the place crossed the threshold of the
  bar and looked around the room. Joseph faded away like a ghost.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Gourdain made his thoughtful departure. As he struggled into his
  heavy overcoat, a person whom he had passed on the stairs entered the
  telephone-booth. ?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Four o'clock glowed upon his illuminated timepiece as Tresholm,
  homeward-bound from Toulon, swung round one of the last of the terrible
  curves of the Lower Corniche close to Cap d'Ail.</p>

  <p>Against the high bank on his left, all the elements of tragedy were
  disclosed to him by his cautiously operated head-light. He turned it off and
  descended. His chauffeur was already in the road.</p>

  <p>"An accident I'm afraid," Tresholm muttered.</p>

  <p>"It's that car from Nice, sir," the man volunteered.</p>

  <p>They both hurried forward. An overturned car was leaning against the bank,
  with an ambulance wagon drawn up just short of it; upon the ground a
  prostrate form, over which were bending a woman in a nurse's costume and a
  man who had the appearance of a doctor. A gendarme in the Monegasque uniform
  turned towards the two new arrivals.</p>

  <p>"What has arrived," Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>A motor accident" the man replied. "Monsieur would do well to proceed.
  There is by chance here a doctor and a nurse. Further aid is not
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"You are of the gendarmerie of Beaulieu or Nice?" Tresholm inquired,
  looking at the man's uniform.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence, that. Monsieur will please proceed. My orders
  are to allow no one to loiter."</p>

  <p>"Your orders? From whom?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Docteur Earnshaw," was the prompt response. "It is a question
  whether the injured man will live, A crowd around him would be fatal. Pass
  on, If you please."</p>

  <p>"I have some knowledge of medicine," Tresholm persisted. "I may be of
  assistance."</p>

  <p>He thrust aside the man's outstretched arm and approached the prostrate
  form. The doctor, a clean-shaven, gray-haired man, swung round at the sound
  of his footsteps. The nurse looked at him with startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"There has been an accident, I fear. Can I be of any assistance? Tresholm
  asked.</p>

  <p>"You and your chauffeur can help us to carry this unfortunate fellow to
  our ambulance, if you will be so kind," the doctor suggested.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Tresholm ventured.</p>

  <p>"We scarcely saw," the doctor replied. "He us, traveling at a tremendous
  speed at the beginning of the turn here. Perhaps he did not allow himself
  quite enough room. Perhaps he had drunk too much. He gave a gave a tremendous
  skid, hit the side of the bank, and the car turned over. We found him lying
  by the roadside here."</p>

  <p>"Is he seriously hurt?"</p>

  <p>"I can find no signs of life."</p>

  <p>Just then another car drew up. A man and a woman leaped from it and ran
  towards the scene of the accident.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" the woman cried.</p>

  <p>Tresholm sprang between her and the injured man. "You must not look," he
  said.</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"
     name="pic11"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300371h-images/Tresholm11.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The four men picked up the injured man and carried him to the ambulance.
  The nurse arranged the pillows for his head. Still he gave no sign of
  life.</p>

  <p>"How far do you go?" Tresholm asked.</p>

  <p>"To Nice," the doctor answered. "I have a small clinic in the Boulevard
  Dubouchage. My name is Doctor Earnshaw."</p>

  <p>"I seem to know the young man by sight," Tresholm reflected.</p>

  <p>"He is quite well known in Nice," the doctor confided gravely. "He is the
  son of a rich jeweler&mdash;a great gambler I fear. Thank you so much for
  your help sir."</p>

  <p>Tresholm returned thoughtfully to his car. He paused to watch the
  departing ambulance thread its careful way round the curve.</p>

  <p>"We'll get along Johnson," he called out to his chauffeur who was
  examining the wreck.</p>

  <p>"Queer things, them skids sir," the man remarked "The road's as dry as a
  bone at the turn here, and there ain't too much dust. Besides, that the front
  of the car's all smashed in, as though it had hit something solid. The bank's
  soft enough. No more than an odd bit of rock or two that wouldn't hurt
  anything."</p>

  <p>Tresholm crossed the road at once and examined the car with his chauffeur.
  The terrible condition of the bonnet and the smashed front-springs was
  difficult to understand.</p>

  <p>"It does seem queer," Tresholm ruminated.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen the front of a car buckled up like that before, sir, just
  with running up a bank," the man commented. "Looks to me as though there
  might have been dirty work before the doctor and the ambulance came along. He
  wouldn't think anything about that, naturally, seeing the car overturned
  here, and the man dead or unconscious."</p>

  <p>Tresholm walked a few pace, along the road. They were some distance from
  any habitation, except the ghostly Château d'Ail. whose empty windows had
  looked down upon the road for forty years. Tresholm studied them
  meditatively. Then he returned to his car.</p>

  <p>"The young man's face was familiar to me." he repeated. "I fancy he's been
  pointed out as a gambler from Nice."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tresholm. the unwilling victim of a gala dinner a few nights later,
  unfolded his napkin and glanced sideways at the card of the woman on his
  left. She caught his eye. smiled, and adjusted the strip of pasteboard so
  that he could read it more easily.</p>

  <p>"Earnshaw," she murmured. "Isobel Earnshaw. That is my name. Yours I know,
  but I wonder whether you can remember where we met last."</p>

  <p>Tresholm was genuinely intrigued. Something about the woman's eyes was
  vaguely reminiscent. She was a a handsome woman, beautifully dressed. Her
  pearls were beautiful, her plainly coiffured hair attractive. Sense of
  familiarity was there, but for one Tresholm was at a loss.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you somewhere recently," he admitted. "The amazing thing is
  that I cannot recall where."</p>

  <p>"I will not spoil your dinner by leaving you guessing. Those were tragical
  moments in which we met Three or four o'clock in the morning it must have
  been, a mist over the moon, and that terrible accident"</p>

  <p>"You were the nurse!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "And my husband was the doctor. You can see him on the other
  side of the table. It was a great grief to both of us that we were unable to
  do anything for that poor young man. He must have been dead several minutes
  before we arrived."</p>

  <p>"It was a horrible tragedy," Tresholm said gravely.</p>

  <p>"It was indeed," she assented, and turned to answer a remark from her
  left-hand neighbor. Tresholm leaned towards his hostess, Lady Westerton.</p>

  <p>"We were speaking of that poor young man's motor accident on his way back
  to Nice." he explained. "One has seen so little of it in the papers."</p>

  <p>"I was remarking the same thing to my husband this morning," Lady
  Westerton agreed. "Have they found any trace of all that money he was
  supposed to have with him?"</p>

  <p>Tresholm turned once more to Mrs. Earnshaw. "Lady Westerton was saying
  something about the young man's having had a large sum of money."</p>

  <p>"An exaggeration, I should imagine," she commented thoughtfully. "He was
  undressed at the clinic naturally. The night-sister too my place, but I am
  sure I should have heard of it if he had had any unusual sum."</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table, and spoke to her husband. "Lady Westerton has
  been telling us that that poor young man, Monsieur Gourdain, was supposed to
  have a considerable sum of money In his possession."</p>

  <p>"Seven mille and some odd change," her husband replied. "I know, because I
  locked it up."</p>

  <p>"There are always rumors of that sort," Isobel Earnshaw reminded them. "In
  this case, however, it must have been a mistake, for there was certainly no
  time for anyone to have robbed him and to have gotten away before we arrived
  on the scene."</p>

  <p>A guest from the other side of the table intervened. "There is no doubt
  that the young man won a large sum that night" he said, "but he probably left
  it somewhere in Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>"He had plenty of, time." the doctor remarked. "They say that he left the
  Sporting Club at three o'clock in the morning. It couldn't have taken him
  more than ten minutes to get to Cap d'Ail, and it was nearly four when we
  came upon him."</p>

  <p>The party broke up as usual with a general exodus to the Sporting Club.
  Tresholm found himself afflicted with a curious fit of uneasiness. He watched
  the play for a time, and then, acting upon a sudden impulse, descended the
  stairs and strolled out into the soft night. He walked the length of the
  terrace, and returning found himself in front of the Casino. He joined the
  thin stream of entrants and made his leisurely progress through the
  "Kitchen."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he came to a standstill. Mrs. Earnshaw was seated at one of the
  tables, playing&mdash;and playing for high stakes. He watched her closely.
  She had a book in her hand which she studied before each bet, but she was
  losing constantly. He changed his place and strolled round behind her. She
  must have had four mille in stakes on the table, mostly around twenty-one and
  red. Twenty-two and black turned up. Her reluctant fingers stole into here
  bag. She drew out a packet of notes and passed five of them to the
  croupier.</p>

  <p>Tresholm for a moment almost betrayed himself. On the backs of the notes
  were little spatterings of red sealing-wax. He watched the note disappear
  into the <i>tronc</i> of the table. Then he walked silently away. The sordid,
  crowded room existed no longer. He looked into the darkness; he saw the
  flickering beams of moonlight upon the white road, the little groups of
  figures, the young man sobbing out his last breath&mdash;watched those white,
  cool fingers stealing in and out of his pockets.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tresholm made friends with the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i> of the principality.
  It was rather a one-sided affair, for that functionary was reserved though
  polite, and Tresholm was on the borderline of being inquisitive. He persisted
  in discussing" the tragedy of the Lower Corniche Road.</p>

  <p>"You see, Monsieur," he ventured, "it is not as though it were the first
  affair of the sort. There have been two others presenting similar
  characteristics."</p>

  <p>"From whom have you that information?" Monsieur Desrolles demanded.</p>

  <p>"I gathered it with difficulty," Tresholm replied evasively.
  "Nevertheless, there was Monsieur Pierre Lavalle, the contractor from Saint
  Raphael, who was found dead, with a burst tire on his car, not a mile from
  the scene of the present tragedy. He too, is reported to have been winning at
  the Casino, yet when he was discovered he had barely a mille note upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Then there was the wine-grower from Juan-les-Pins&mdash;I have forgotten
  his name&mdash;and his was a small affair, but when Be left the Casino he
  certainly had seventy or eighty thousand francs in his pocket of which there
  were no traces when his body was found at the roadside.</p>

  <p>"It may be. as you say, a dangerous road. Monsieur Desrolles, but it is
  odd that these three accidents should have happened to men who left Monte
  Carlo with large sums of money which were never seen again."</p>

  <p>"The affairs in question are occupying my department" the <i>Chef de
  Sûreté</i> declared. "At the same time, let me remind you of this&mdash;there
  is no direct evidence that any one of these three man whom you have mentioned
  actually had a large sum of money in his possession when the accident
  occurred.</p>

  <p>"Young Monsieur Gourdain is known to have called somewhere in Monte Carlo
  on his homeward way, and also at a dancing place in Cap d'Ail. Lavalle sat in
  a café two hours on his return journey and the person from Juan was,
  according to the medical sodden with drink. All these might well have been
  robbed elsewhere than upon the scene of the accident."</p>

  <p>"That is true," Tresholm admitted, but as against that, no traces of the
  money have been discovered."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there has been no word of it in the papers."</p>

  <p>"In England," the <i>Chef de Sûreté</i> pointed out. "you often make
  escape from justice an easy thing for the criminal. You show him in what
  direction the police are working, and against whom their suspicions are
  directed. That is not our method."</p>

  <p>"Admitting all this," Tresholm insisted patiently, "do you believe,
  Monsieur Desrolles, that these three tragedies were ordinary accidents?"</p>

  <p>"My answer to you, Monsieur Tresholm, is that we have no reason to suppose
  otherwise," was the rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"In you case, as you are a friend of Monsieur Robert's, I will treat you
  with some confidence, and I will venture to remind you of one fact. The
  amateur detective does not exist in France. We find that official business
  proceeds more satisfactorily without interference from outsiders."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Desrolles," said Tresholm, "I am not an amateur detective, and I
  have no wish to force your hand in any way. I will walk away from here with a
  seal upon my lips. Please listen to what I have to say."</p>

  <p>"I will listen to what you have to say, Monsieur Tresholm," the other
  decided.</p>

  <p>"The clerk who handed Gourdain notes for some of his winnings is reported
  to have apologized for the fact that a number of them had been spattered with
  red sealing-wax. I have seen notes spattered in the same fashion within the
  last twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>"You would recognize the person who passed them?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I could tell you her name, if you would like to hear it."</p>

  <p>"I am listening."</p>

  <p>"Her name is Isobel Earnshaw. She is the wife of the doctor whom I saw
  upon the road bandaging the young man's head that night."</p>

  <p>Tresholm was confused at the result of his words. Whether from shock or
  for some other reason, Desrolles was incapable of speech. Tresholm had the
  queer feeling that the man was personally affected.</p>

  <p>"The lady in question, Tresholm went on. "was gambling in the 'Kitchen'
  for sums which, for a doctor's wife, were enormous. I suggest, sir, that you
  look up the dossiers of Doctor Earnshaw and his wife."</p>

  <p>The functionary was himself again. There was a new and rasping note in his
  voice, however.</p>

  <p>"There is no one in the neighborhood," he announced scornfully, who needs
  to look at a police dossier of Doctor Earnshaw, or his wife. The doctor has
  practised in Nice for seventeen years, served In the war, and has amassed,
  without doubt, a comfortable fortune. He has been married for twelve years
  and his wife enjoys the respect of the whole community."</p>

  <p>"A good record," Tresholm admitted.</p>

  <p>"So good," Desrolles continued, "that your suggestion took my breath away.
  There are many bundles of mille notes, Monsieur Tresholm, which bear traces
  of sealing-wax."</p>

  <p>Tresholm rose unwillingly. "After what you have told me,
  Monsieur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, sit down," the other interrupted. "We must consider this matter. Any
  theory you may have formed concerning Earnshaw and his wife is of course,
  absurd. But tell me what was in your mind."</p>

  <p>"Simply this. I am fond on an adventure&mdash;a gambler outside of
  gaming-rooms, you understand. I had an idea of leaving the Sporting Club a
  heavy winner one night and testing the affair by going to Nice myself. If you
  approved of my plan and were willing to help me. I thought we might perhaps
  solve this mystery."</p>

  <p>Desrolles was scribbling with his pen.</p>

  <p>"Your plan is worth considering," he conceded. "See me later, and we will
  work out the details. In the meanwhile, Monsieur Tresholm, let me impress
  upon you one thing&mdash;the necessity for discretion. Upon that condition
  alone we work together."</p>

  <p>"I agree," Tresholm assented.</p>

  <p>On the following night Tresholm justified himself, at least in the eyes of
  all Monte Carlo. The news went flashing from the Sporting Club back to the
  hotel and through the Casino. The attack upon its resources was opened.
  Tresholm had bought a million francs' worth of plaques, and was playing a
  steady, systematic game of roulette at maximums.</p>

  <p>An hour later a further bulletin was issued. Affairs were going ill with
  he intrepid gambler. He was half a million down, and losing steadily. Gustave
  Sordel, hurrying through the passage, chuckled to himself. It was a tardy
  triumph, but worth while.</p>

  <p>Tresholm backed the same numbers and every possible combination of them
  without flinching his losses. His luck began to turn when a vacated place
  next to the croupier on the opposite side of the table was taken by a
  woman.</p>

  <p>Their eyes met as she sat down. whatever surprise Tresholm may have felt,
  he succeeded in concealing it. His greeting was friendly. Following her first
  smile, however, was a look in her beautiful eyes which puzzled him. He had
  suddenly become of some account to her. So might she have looked at him if,
  by some incredible chance, she had overheard his conversation with Desrolles.
  She had betrayed only a trace of it but, she was afraid.</p>

  <p>Luck at the tables is a singular thing, or the world's interest in that
  mechanical toy, the roulette-wheel would long since have evaporated. The
  woman opposite him was playing on black numbers of low denominations.
  Tresholm, with every stake, was directly opposed to her. From the moment of
  her sitting down, his numbers dominated the board. In five spins he won <i>en
  plein</i> three times. His luck was prodigious. The heap of disks in front of
  him grew and grew. As be won, his <i>vis-à-vis</i> lost.</p>

  <p>"You are Invincible, Mr. Tresholm," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You are playing against the table," he rejoined. "The run of it is for my
  numbers."</p>

  <p>At one o'clock she left off playing, and at a quarter past Tresholm rose.
  The cashier handed him back his check for a million, which he had cashed at
  the beginning of the evening, and over a million in mille notes.</p>

  <p>For once he broke through his habit of silence.</p>

  <p>"It Is perhaps as well for the Casino, Monsieur Tresholm," he said. "that
  you are only an occasional player. Would you like me to send one of the
  clerks up with you to your room?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks very much," Tresholm replied, "but I am staying at the Negresco at
  Nice&mdash;moved in there yesterday.!</p>

  <p>In the bar he called for a whisky-and-soda. Joseph welcomed him.</p>

  <p>"Walk quickly through the passages. Monsieur." he advised A million francs
  burn in the pocket."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going through any passages," Tresholm said. "I am going to Nice.
  I'm staying at the Negresco for a few days."</p>

  <p>There was a rush of custom, and Joseph moved reluctantly away. Tresholm
  finished his drink and turned leave the room. In the entrance he came face to
  face with Isobel Earnshaw.</p>

  <p>"Better luck now I've left?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She ignored his question, laid her long nervous fingers on his arm and
  drew him into the little recess.</p>

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Mr. Tresholm," she said, you will think that my nerves have all gone
  because I have been losing tonight, but it is not that. I have a
  superstition&mdash;a real one. Don't go to Nice tonight."</p>

  <p>"But my dear lady, why not? I am not like young men&mdash;a reckless
  driver&mdash;and I shall call nowhere on the way.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I implore you&mdash;do not go.</p>

  <p>Their eyes met for a single moment.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "this, I believe, is kindness, which I shall always
  remember. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>He strode out, and down the stairs. As he stood waiting for his hat and
  overcoat, someone hurried into the telephone booth.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The Sporting Club was still crowded an hour and a half later, when
  Tresholm made his unexpected reappearance. He strolled into the bar, and
  Joseph stared and asked breathlessly:</p>

  <p>"You changed your mind, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly that," Tresholm admitted. "I found the road just beyond Cap
  d'Ail practically in the hands of the police, and such a hullabaloo going on
  that I thought I'd come back."</p>

  <p>Gustave Sordel. who had been at the bar, leaned forward. "What, then, has
  arrived?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Tresholm paused for a moment, and in that moment he heard soft movements.
  He had no need to turn his head; he knew who had stolen up onto the vacant
  stool by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "do you happen to know a sort of deserted
  <i>château</i> on the road near Cap d'Ail?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. All the world knows it," Sordel assented. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>There was a little indrawn breath on his other side?almost a sob. Tresholm
  was merciful. He avoided the temptation of a dramatic recital.</p>

  <p>"I found a barrier across the road here." he recounted. "The Nice police
  had got possession of the place. From the little I could gather. It seems to
  have been temporarily In the possession of a doctor. Someone had gotten hold
  of the place before him I suppose, though, and just round the bend there was
  a most diabolical affair, worked by an engine from a secret opening In the
  wood, which dragged an iron structure up to the right-hand side of the road.
  That's the thing young Gourdain ran into, of course, and probably others. As
  a matter of fact, it was out tonight?for me."</p>

  <p>There was a babel of questions.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see that Mrs. Earnshaw isn't well?" Tresholm protested. "Give
  me some brandy, Joseph."</p>

  <p>"Was anyone arrested?" someone asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>The fingers of the woman gripped his own. She was deathly pale, but her
  eyes commanded.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she Insisted. "Tell your story."</p>

  <p>"There Is not so much to tell," he obeyed reluctantly, "among
  whom&mdash;it was ridiculous, of course," he added, "but your husband was
  nominal owner of the property&mdash;so, as a matter of form&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What else?" she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Let me take you home," he begged.</p>

  <p>"It you don't tell me everything," she? gasped, "I shall die. Can't you
  see? I must know!"</p>

  <p>"There was another tragedy," he confided. "Monsieur Desrolles&mdash;no
  doubt it was a point of honor with him&mdash;he thought that the Nice police
  had been too officious; he drove up, passed me on the way, in fact, found out
  what had happened, and blew his brains out."</p>

  <p>There was a little shiver of emotion. Isobel Earnshaw stretched out her
  hand for the brandy.</p>

  <p>"You yourself have received a slight wound, Monsieur," Sordel
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Tresholm dabbed his cheek with a handkerchief and nodded.</p>

  <p>"A blood-thirsty night," he observed. "Someone took a pot-shot at me from
  a car."</p>

  <p>The woman dropped a white pellet into her glass. She drew closer to
  Tresholm.</p>

  <p>"It was? Armand Desrolles who tried to shoot you," she said. "He did it
  because of me. I'm glad he failed. You're a brave man anyhow, although you
  deceived Armand and went for the Nice police."</p>

  <p>She drained the contents of her glass. Tresholm suddenly saw the
  cloudiness of the liquid and snatched at it, but he was too late.</p>

  <p>"An affair of thirty seconds," she assured him. "You took a gambler's
  chance, anyhow, and I like you for it."</p>

  <p>"Tresholm!" someone called out.</p>

  <p>He turned his head. Another voice was raised above the general hubbub.</p>

  <p>"Look out! What's happened to Mrs. Earnshaw?"</p>

  <p>She slipped from her stool, clinging his shoulder to break her fall. Her
  arm dragged him down, her pale lips whispered:</p>

  <p>"I was a gambler from birth, through life&mdash;to death," she faltered.
  "You, too. Goodbye."</p>
