 <h2><a name="story01"
    id="story01">1. THE STRETELLI CASE</a></h2>

 <p>Detective-Inspector John MacKenzie has retired&mdash;the newspapers are
 filled with stories of his exploits. His immediate chiefs are equally filled
 with wonder, suspecting many reasons for his premature withdrawal from the
 services of his country, but never by any chance hitting upon the real cause,
 which was the unquenchable antagonism between his sense of duty, his sense of
 justice, and his grim sense of humor.</p>

 <p>And this conflict of emotions arose over the Stretelli case, which most
 crime experts and the majority of people consider as having been rounded off
 on a certain cold December morning in Nottingham Prison.</p>

 <p>In a sense this was true; yet, with the compliments of his Chief in his
 ears and with the knowledge that there was a vacant post for a new
 superintendent to be filled, duty, justice, and humor battled it out so
 briskly in his mind that he sat down in his office and wrote his
 resignation.</p>

 <p>In one sense Mackenzie was old-fashioned, and when a card was brought into
 his office inscribed "Dr. Mona Stretelli, Madrid," he sniffed. He was
 prejudiced against women doctors, though this was the first lady who had ever
 called upon him professionally.</p>

 <p>"Show her in," he said, and wondered exactly what had brought a Spanish
 lady doctor to Scotland Yard.</p>

 <p>She was in the room before his speculations were carried far&mdash;a girl
 of middle height, dark, capable, and even pretty.</p>

 <p>"I am very honored to meet you, doctor," he said conventionally, speaking
 in French. "What can I do for you?"</p>

 <p>She smiled faintly at the brusque greeting.</p>

 <p>"You can give me ten minutes of your valuable time, Mr. Mackenzie," she
 said in perfect English. "I have rather an important statement to make."</p>

 <p>She handed him a letter bearing the Home Office stamp. It was an
 introduction from a high official, and Inspector Mackenzie ceased to
 wonder.</p>

 <p>"Do you know Mr. Peter Morstels?" she asked, and he shook his head.</p>

 <p>She hesitated.</p>

 <p>"In London you must hear... rumors about people&mdash;in the West End, I
 mean. Have you ever heard of Margaret Stretelli?"</p>

 <p>Mackenzie frowned. "Of course! I thought the name was familiar. Stretelli!
 You are related?"</p>

 <p>She nodded. "She was my sister," she said quietly.</p>

 <p>"Was&mdash;she's not dead?"</p>

 <p>The girl nodded again, and he saw that her eyes were wet.</p>

 <p>When Margaret Stretelli disappeared from London, nobody at police
 headquarters was either relieved or sorry, but the event did not pass
 unnoticed. Margaret belonged to the bobbed-hair set that had its meeting-
 place in a Soho restaurant. She was known to be an associate of questionable
 people; there was talk of cocaine traffic in which she played an exciting but
 unprofitable part; there was one wild party into which the police had
 intruded, and a minor court case where she had figured, a little vulgarly, as
 the driver of a car which had charged a lamp-post. Police headquarters was
 mildly interested in her vagaries, knew her to be well off in the matter of
 money, and when she was no longer seen at her haunts they made discreet
 inquiries, to discover that she had married a gentleman farmer in the
 Midlands, and had run away from him a very few weeks after the marriage, and
 had gone to New York.</p>

 <p>A very uninteresting and commonplace story, hardly worthy the attention of
 Scotland Yard's recording angel, yet, since all crime has its basis in the
 commonplace, the circumstances were duly noted and filed.</p>

 <p>"Perhaps I had better tell you our story," she began. "My father was a
 doctor of Madrid, and on his death he left five million pesetas between his
 two daughters, myself and Margaret. I had taken up my father's profession,
 the profession of medicine, and was in my third year when he died.</p>

 <p>"Poor Margaret loved life&mdash;as she understood it. Three months after
 father's death, she left Madrid for Paris, ostensibly to study music. From
 Paris she went to London, and, so far as I can learn, she got into a very
 undesirable set. How she came to meet Mr. Morstels, I have never been able to
 discover. It is certain that she had wasted a great deal of money when she
 came under his influence. He proposed to her and they were married at
 Marylebone Registry Office, and she left with him for his home at Little
 Saffron.</p>

 <p>"She was seen there by some of the villagers, and, so far as can be
 ascertained, lived with him for three weeks. How much longer she was a
 resident is not known. It may have been three months, it may have been no
 longer than a month. But, when she disappeared, the story that she had run
 away from her husband was accepted as true by the villagers of Avignon, who
 had got quite used to the unfortunate character of Mr. Morstels'
 marriages."</p>

 <p>"He had been married before?" asked Mackenzie.</p>

 <p>"Twice," said the girl; "and each time his wife ran away and was divorced
 by him. Mr. Mackenzie, I am satisfied that my sister has been murdered!"</p>

 <p>Mackenzie sat up in his chair.</p>

 <p>"Murdered? My dear young lady, that sort of thing does not
 happen&mdash;"</p>

 <p>He stopped suddenly, realizing that this was the type of crime that did
 happen.</p>

 <p>"Possibly his story is true, and your sister ran away," he suggested.</p>

 <p>She shook her head.</p>

 <p>"That is impossible. Had she run away she would have come to me. We were
 always the best of friends, and though she was wilful and headstrong, she
 never got into a strait when she did not ask me to get her out of it."</p>

 <p>"Have you seen Mr. Morstels?" asked Mackenzie. "I have seen him: I saw him
 yesterday for the first time," she said, "and the sight of him convinces me
 that my sister has been murdered."</p>

 <p>"That's rather a serious statement to make, but I realize that you would
 not advance such a theory unless you had good grounds," said Mackenzie, with
 a smile. "After all, doctors as a profession are not easily influenced or
 given to making rash statements, are you?"</p>

 <p>She shook her head. "I am not, certainly," she said, rising and walking up
 and down the room, her voice rising agitatedly. "Forgive me, Mr. Mackenzie,
 but I am so convinced that poor Margaret is dead that, if she walked into the
 room at this moment, 1 know that I should be suffering from an illusion."</p>

 <p>"But why do you feel this?" Mackenzie persisted. "Beyond the fact that Mr.
 Morstels seems to be, by your account, a much,married man, nothing is known
 against him."</p>

 <p>"I have been making inquiries," she said.</p>

 <p>"The local police speak well of him, but I think that I can furnish you
 with some details which may be of interest. Before Margaret left London, she
 drew from the bank the sum of six thousand five hundred pounds. Where is that
 money?"</p>

 <p>"Did you ask him?"</p>

 <p>"I asked him, and he said that one of his greatest misfortunes was that
 the lady, when she left him, had taken with her not only her own money but
 some of his. He had the audacity to ask me if I was prepared to refund
 it."</p>

 <p>Mackenzie sat hunched up at his desk, his chin in his hand, a heavy frown
 on his face.</p>

 <p>"It grows more and more like a conventional murder story," he said. "I
 hope for your sake, Miss Stretelli, that you are mistaken. I will see Mr.
 Morstels."</p>

 <p>On a wintry morning, when the frost showed whitely on the bare branches in
 Mr. Peter Morstels' orchard, Detective-Inspector Mackenzie made his leisurely
 way from the little railway station, a pipe between the teeth, the furled
 umbrella, without which he never moved, under his arm. In sight of Hill
 Cottage he stopped and carefully inspected the rambling house with the ugly
 concrete extension that had recently been completed. It stood on the slope of
 a hill, a picturesque dwelling, owing something of its charm to distance.
 Five minutes later he was inspecting the building nearer at hand, and he was
 not impressed.</p>

 <p>The man who answered his knock was unusually tall and broad, a veritable
 giant of a man. His thin hair was flaxen, his big face ruddy with the glow of
 health. Standing square in the doorway, he looked down upon the detective
 with a scowl of suspicion.</p>

 <p>"Good morning, Mr. Morstels. I am Inspector Mackenzie from Scotland
 Yard."</p>

 <p>Not a muscle of the big man's face moved. No flicker of lid hid for a
 second the pale blue of the saucer eyes.</p>

 <p>"Glad to see you, officer. Come in."</p>

 <p>He led the way to a stone-floored kitchen, low-ceilinged and clean.</p>

 <p>"I'm wondering if Miss Stretelli sent you? She did, eh? I thought it was
 likely. If I haven't had enough trouble with her sister without her coming to
 me with fantastic stories about my wife!"</p>

 <p>"Where is your wife?" asked Mackenzie bluntly.</p>

 <p>"In America somewhere&mdash;she never told me the town she was going to,
 naturally. I've got her letter upstairs."</p>

 <p>He was gone a few minutes, returning with a sheet of gray paper. It bore
 no address.</p>

 <p class="letter">I am leaving you because I cannot endure the quietness of
 the country. I am writing this on board the "Teutonic." Please divorce me. I
 am not traveling in my own name.</p>

 <p>Mackenzie turned the letter over in his hand.</p>

 <p>"Why didn't she use ship's stationery?" he asked pleasantly. "A women in a
 hurry to get away does not usually unpack her trunks in order to get
 stationery that is available in the saloon. I suppose you traced her through
 the passenger list&mdash;oh, of course, you couldn't. She was traveling in
 another name. I wonder how she got over the passport difficulty?"</p>

 <p>He said all this musingly, watching the man before him, but if he expected
 to irritate Peter Morstels into an indiscreet statement, he was to be
 disappointed.</p>

 <p>"That was her business," said the other calmly. "She did not take me into
 her confidence. Her sister thinks I have killed her!"</p>

 <p>He laughed quietly. "Fortunately, I was alone when she called the other
 day. A nice story would have gone through the village if my servant had heard
 her!"</p>

 <p>His eyes never left the detective's face as he spoke.</p>

 <p>"I suppose she told you something of the sort?" he queried. "If she did,
 you're at liberty to search the house, dig up the ground, and pull the place
 to pieces. I can say no fairer than that. The only things I have of hers are
 some clothing she did not take away. Would you care to see it?"</p>

 <p>Mackenzie followed him up the stairs to the big bedroom at the front of
 the house. In a wardrobe closet he found a fur coat, two or three dresses,
 and half a dozen pairs of shoes. These latter he examined carefully, one by
 one, and found a pair that had not been worn.</p>

 <p>Mackenzie, who knew something of women, drew his own conclusions. An
 examination of the garden and the grounds brought him no nearer to a solution
 of the girl's disappearance.</p>

 <p>"What are you building there?" he asked, pointing to the half- finished
 concrete annex. The man smiled slowly.</p>

 <p>"That was to have been a new bathroom for my lady! Hill Cottage wasn't
 good enough for her. I wasbuilding this place as a sittingroom for myself,
 but she made me remodel it for her use. I'm a poor man, Mr. Mackenzie, but I
 would have spent my last sou for that woman! She had plenty of
 money&mdash;thousands&mdash;but not a penny did she give me. Not that I
 wanted it."</p>

 <p>Mackenize drew a long breath.</p>

 <p>"You've been rather unfortunate in your matrimonial affairs," he said, and
 had nothing but a grunted agreement.</p>

 <p>The detective went back to town that morning in a thoughtful mood. He
 found Mona Stretelli waiting for him in his office.</p>

 <p>"I see by your face that you have learned nothing," she said.</p>

 <p>"You must be a thought reader," he smiled. "The only thing I am satisfied
 about, and this is unofficial, is that Morstels is a liar. He may be a
 murderer, too, but&mdash;there is a 'but'!"</p>

 <p>"Do you think that, if you had authority to search, you should find
 anything?"</p>

 <p>Mackenzie shook his head.</p>

 <p>"I don't think so," he replied regretfully. "This man is more than an
 ordinary criminal. If he has killed these unfortunate women&mdash;"</p>

 <p>He saw her turn white and stagger, and ran to her assistance.</p>

 <p>"It is nothing," she said, and suddenly her black brows met, and there
 came a fire in her eyes that startled him.</p>

 <p>"I swear to you," she said, in a low, vehement tone, "that this man shall
 not escape! He shall suffer for his crimes&mdash;"</p>

 <p>Suddenly she stopped, and her compressed lips gave some indication of the
 self-restraint she was exercising. She held out her hand.</p>

 <p>"I shall not see you again," she said.</p>

 <p>That afternoon, Mackenzie reported to his Chief, and put the matter
 plainly to him. The Commissioner was not hopeful.</p>

 <p>"I am afraid we can do nothing. Naturally, this unfortunate Spanish girl
 is excited by the loss of her sister, but these disappearances are very
 common, particularly when the person who disappears is&mdash;let us say
 Bohemian. She will very likely turn up at Monte Carlo next season."</p>

 <p>Mackenzie disagreed. He did not see Mona Stretelli for a fortnight,
 though, to his surprise, he read about her. There had been a sale of some old
 jewelry, the property of a deceased Marquis, and she had purchased a famous
 paste ring, which had been the property of Marie Antoinette, for
 &pound;200.</p>

 <p>A picture of the ring appeared in some of the London newspapers, the
 editors being possibly attracted by the quaint and even bizarre setting. It
 was such a ring as no woman could wear&mdash;it was enormously
 large&mdash;and he was puzzled that she had overcome her distress so that she
 could indulge in a frivolity of this kind.</p>

 <p>Then, about a week later, a most amazing thing happened. She went to
 Scotland Yard unannounced one evening, and he expected some news, but
 certainly not the news she gave him.</p>

 <p>"Mr. Mackenzie," she said, "I have been very ungenerous in reference to
 Mr. Morstels, and I am perfectly satisfied that my suspicions were ill-
 founded."</p>

 <p>He looked at her in amazement. 'Have you seen him?" he asked.</p>

 <p>She nodded; there was a flush in her cheek and her voice was unsteady as
 she answered him.</p>

 <p>"I am going to be married to Mr. Morstels this week."</p>

 <p>He looked at her, speechless with astonishment.</p>

 <p>"Married?" he gasped. "But, knowing what you do&mdash;"</p>

 <p>"I am afraid we were both very prejudiced against Peter," she said calmly.
 "I have found him a most charming and fascinating man."</p>

 <p>"I should imagine you have," said Mackenzie grimly. "But do you realize
 what you are doing?"</p>

 <p>She nodded.</p>

 <p>"And you're really going to marry him?"</p>

 <p>"Yes," she replied. "I am marrying him when&mdash;when his divorce
 proceedings are through. I am staying with him for a week. His aunt is coming
 to chaperon me. I told you I would not see you again," she said, with a
 half-smile, "but this time I mean it!"</p>

 <p>With a curt farewell she was gone. As she was leaving the room, the bag
 she was carrying under her arm slipped and fell. She picked it up hurriedly
 and passed out of the room, but in falling the bag had opened and a long
 moir&eacute; silk purse had fallen out.</p>

 <p>He did not notice it until she had gone. Picking it up, he opened the
 purse, thinking to find a card bearing her Paris address. All there was in
 the purse was an oblong receipt form which interested him considerably.</p>

 <p>A few seconds later she was announced again. Evidently the girl had
 discovered her loss.</p>

 <p>"I know what you have come for," said Mackenzie, looking at her flushed
 face. "I found it on the floor a few seconds ago."</p>

 <p>"Thank you," she said, a little breathlessly, and without another word she
 turned and went away. The next morning he received a wire telling him she was
 leaving for the country.</p>

 <p>Mackenzie thought many things&mdash;but mostly his mind was occupied by
 one problem: what value would the homicidal Peter Morstels place upon the
 eccentric ring of Marie Antoinette? The reason for the purchase of the ring
 was now clear.</p>

 <p>On the second morning after the departure of the girl, he strolled down to
 Waterloo Station to see the passengers off and to watch the departure of the
 boat-train for Southampton. There was a very big trans- Atlantic passenger
 list, and so many people were crossing to America that the train was run in
 two sections.</p>

 <p>"Queer how these Americans travel," said the station inspector,
 recognizing him. "Look at that old lady."</p>

 <p>He pointed to a bent figure in deep mourning, walking painfully along the
 platform with the aid of two sticks. "At her time of life to be risking a sea
 voyage!"</p>

 <p>"Extraordinary," agreed Mackenzie.</p>

 <p>When he returned to the house that afternoon he found a letter waiting for
 him. The envelope was soiled and muddy, the address was in pencil. Inside was
 a visiting-card&mdash;Mona Stretelli's&mdash;and scrawled on its face were
 the words: "For God's sake come to me!"</p>

 <p>Mackenzie carried the news to his Chief, and from that moment he was out
 of the case, though he had credit for all that followed.</p>

 <p>"But, my dear fellow, you must take the case!" insisted his Chief, but Mac
 was adamant, and to Inspector Jordan belongs all the immediate credit for the
 discoveries.</p>

 <p>It was near midnight when Jordan arrived at the farm, and this time he
 went armed with authority, for he had seen his Chief and had impressed him
 with the seriousness of the possibilities. Peter Morstels, half dressed,
 opened the door himself, and turned a little pale when he saw his
 visitor.</p>

 <p>"Where is Mona Stretelli?" asked Jordan curtly.</p>

 <p>"She has left," said Peter. "She left me the night she arrived here. My
 aunt could not come, and she would not stay without a chaperon."</p>

 <p>"You're lying," said the detective shortly, "and I am going to place you
 under arrest while I make a search of the house."</p>

 <p>The search of the house revealed nothing, but in the morning Jordan
 questioned the villagers, and produced evidence which made the case against
 Morstels look black. Two men who, returning from a neighboring village, had
 passed by a short cut within a quarter of a mile of the house, had heard a
 woman's sharp scream at nine o'clock that night. It came from the direction
 of Hill Cottage. No further sound was heard, and apparently the villagers
 took little notice of the occurrence. When questioned by the detective,
 Morstels admitted that, for some unaccountable reason, which he had put down
 to hysteria, Mona Stretelli had started screamiug.</p>

 <p>"She was like a lunatic," he protested. "Must I be arrested because a
 woman screams? I gave her an hour to calm down, then I went to her room and
 knocked at her door, but there was no answer. I opened it, and she was
 gone&mdash;possibly through a window, for it is a window from which she could
 drop easily to the ground."</p>

 <p>"That story isn't quite good enough," said Jordan. "I am going to remove
 you to the police station, pending an examination of the ground."</p>

 <p>The whole of the estate, such as was not covered by trees, was very
 carefully probed and dug, and on the third day of the investigation the big
 discovery was made. Under about four feet of earth was found a heap of
 charred bones; but, most damning of all, the ring of Marie Antoinette!</p>

 <p>Jordan came back to London and woke Mackenzie with the news.</p>

 <p>"He evidently disposed of the bodies by burning," he said exultantly.
 "There is a huge fireplace in the kitchen, and the bodies could be burnt
 without detection. We have our pathologist, who swears that the bones are
 human."</p>

 <p>"They are not necessarily the bones of Mona Stretelli," said Mackenzie
 warningly.</p>

 <p>"But there is the ring!" he said in triumph. "That is sufficient!"</p>

 <p>Throughout the trial that followed, Morstels preserved a sangfroid which
 was remarkable. The only time he broke down was when the death sentence was
 pronounced, and then it was only for a few moments.</p>

 <p>On the morning before his execution, Mackenzie went to Nottingham Prison
 to see him, at the condemned man's request. He was smoking a cigarette and
 chatting with one of the warders, and he greeted the detective with a little
 nod.</p>

 <p>"You brought me bad luck, Mackenzie, but I'm going to tell you something.
 I did kill several women&mdash;three or four, I forget," he said, with a
 shrug of indifference. "They are all in concrete, the foundations of my new
 house," he chuckled. "But Mona Stretelli I did not killthat I swear. It is a
 bit tough on me, Mac, that I'm to swing for a murder which I did not
 commit!"</p>

 <p>He brooded for a minute, then:</p>

 <p>"I should like to see this girl Stretelli and congratulate her."</p>

 <p>Mackenzie did not reply until he wrote his resignation. He had seen in
 Mona Stretelli's purse a receipt from a Steamship Company for her passage. To
 make doubly sure, he had gone to Waterloo and recognized her, though she was
 well disguised, as she boarded the train.</p>

 <p>The night after she was supposed to have been murdered, she was on the
 broad Atlantic, bound for a new home, a new land, and a new life, leaving

 had purchased from an anatomical establishment, and the ring which was to

 <h2><a name="story02"
    id="story02">2. THE LOOKER AND THE LEAPER</a></h2>

 <p>Foley, the smoke-room oracle, has so often bored not only the members of
 the club, but a much wider circle of victims, by his views on heredity and
 the functions of the <i>hormones</i>&mdash;for he has a fluent pen and an
 entree to the columns of a certain newspaper that shall
 be&mdash;nameless&mdash;that one is averse to recalling his frayed
 theories.</p>

 <p>He is the type of scientist who takes a correspondence course in such
 things as mnemonics, motor engineering, criminology, wireless telegraphy, and
 character-building. He paid nothing for the <i>hormones</i>, having found
 them in an English newspaper report of Professor Parrott's (is it the name?)
 lecture. <i>Hormones</i> are the little <i>X's</i> in your circulatory system
 which inflict upon an unsuspecting and innocent baby such calamities as his
 uncle's nose, his father's temper, and Cousin Minnie's unwholesome craving
 for Chopin and bobbed hair. The big fellows in the medical world hesitate to
 assign the exact function of the <i>hormones</i> or even to admit their
 existence.</p>

 <p>Foley, on the contrary, is prepared to supply thumb-nail sketches and
 specifications. When you go to the writing-table in the "Silence" room, and
 find it littered with expensive stationery, more or less covered with
 scrawly-wags, it is safe betting that Foley has been introducing his new
 friend to some wretched member whom he has inveigled into an indiscreet
 interest.</p>

 <p>But <i>Hormones</i> apart, there is one theory of evolution to which Foley
 has clung most tenaciously. And it is that the ultra-clever father has a fool
 for a son.</p>

 <p>Whether it works the other way round he does not say. I should think not,
 for Foley senior is in his eightieth year, believes in spiritualism, and
 speculates on margins.</p>

 <p>Foley advanced his theory in relation to Dick Magnus.</p>

 <p>John Seymour Magnus, his father, is popularly supposed to be in heaven,
 because of the many good qualities and characteristics recorded on the
 memorial tablet in St. Mary's Church. Thus: He was a Good Father, a Loving
 Husband and a Faithful Friend, and performed Many Charitable Deeds in This
 City.</p>

 <p>There is nothing on the memorial tablet about his Successful Promotions or
 Real Estate Acquisitions. He was bracketed first as the keenest business man
 of his day. A shrewd, cunning general of commerce, who worked out his plans
 to the minutest detail, he ran his schemes to a time-table and was seldom
 late. All other men (except one) would comprehend the beginning and fruition
 of their schemes within the space of months. John Seymour Magnus saw the
 culmination of his secret politics three years ahead.</p>

 <p>There was one other, a rival, who had the same crafty qualities. Carl
 Martingale was his contemporary, and it is an important circumstance that he
 supplied, in his son, a complete refutation of all Foley's theories. Carl and
 John died within twelve days of one another, and both their great businesses
 went to only sons.</p>

 <p>Dick took over the old man's chair, and was so oppressed by his
 uncongenial surroundings that he sold it for a ridiculous figure to Steven
 Martingale. The two were friends, so the sale was effected over a luncheon
 for which Dick paid.</p>

 <p>Steven had arranged the lunch weeks ahead, had decided upon the course of
 conversation which would lead up to the question of sale, and had prepared
 his reply when Dick was manceuvered into offering the property. For Steven
 was his parent, and worse. Old Carl was a selfmade boor, with no refined
 qualities. Steven had the appearance and speech of a gentleman and shared
 certain views on life with the anthropoid ape.</p>

 <p>Ugly stories floated around, and once old Jennifer came into the club in a
 condition bordering on hysteria and drank himself maudlin. He had hoped to
 bag Steven for the family, and had allowed his pretty daughter Fay a very
 free hand.</p>

 <p>Too free, it seems. Nothing happened which in any way discommoded Steven.
 The old fellow owed him an immense amount of money, and Steven knew to a
 penny the exact strength of these financial legirons.</p>

 <p>He was a strikingly handsome fellow, the type the shop-girls rave
 about&mdash;dark, tall, broad of shoulder and lean of flank, an athlete and
 something of a wit. A greater contrast to Dick could not be imagined, for
 Dick was thinnish and small, fair haired, rather short-sighted (Steven's
 flashing eye and long lashes were features that fascinated) and languid.</p>

 <p>But he did not develop his left-handedness until after he was married.</p>

 <p>Both Dick and Steven courted Thelma Corbett, and never a day passed but
 that their cars were parked in the vicinity of the Corbett
 <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. Corbett being on the danger-zone of bankruptcy was
 indifferent as to which of the two men succeeded in their quest, and Thelma
 was in a like case.</p>

 <p>She was one of those pretty slender creatures whom. meeting, leave you
 with a vague unrest of mind. Where had you met her before? Then you realized
 (as I realized) that she was the ideal toward which all the line artists who
 ever drew pretty women were everlastingly striving. She was cold and sweet,
 independent and helpless, clever and vapid; you were never quite certain
 which was the real girl and which was the varnish and the
 finishing-school.</p>

 <p>To everybody's surprise, she married Dick. Steven had willed it, of
 course. He half admitted as much one night between acts when we were smoking
 in the lobby of the Auditorium. Dick had at that time been married for the
 best part of a year and was childishly happy.</p>

 <p>"I can't understand how Dick came to cut you out, Steven," I said. He was
 feeling pretty good toward me just about then, for I had pulled him through a
 sharp attack of <i>grippe</i>.</p>

 <p>He laughed, that teasing little laugh of his.</p>

 <p>"I thought it best," he said, a statement which could be taken two ways.
 That he was not exposing his modesty or displaying the least unselfishness,
 ho went on to explain:</p>

 <p>"She was too young, too placid. Some women are like that. The men who
 marry them never wake them up. Some go through life with their hearts asleep
 and die in the belief that they have been happy. They have lived without
 'struggle,' and only 'struggle' can light the fire which produces the perfect
 woman. I figured it that way."</p>

 <p>I was silent.</p>

 <p>"I figured it that way"&mdash;a favorite expression of his&mdash;explained
 in a phrase the inexplicable.</p>

 <p>"That is why you find the most unlikely women running away with the most
 impossible men," he went on; "the heavens are filled with the woes of perfect
 husbands and the courts shudder with their lamentations. They are bewildered,
 stunned, outraged. They have showered their wealth and affection upon a
 delicate lady, and in return she has fled with a snubnosed chauffeur whose
 vocabulary is limited to twelve hundred words and whose worldly possessions
 are nil."</p>

 <p>I said nothing, and soon after the bell rang and we went back to our
 seats. He drove me home that night and came up to my den for a drink, and I
 reopened the subject of Dick and his wife.</p>

 <p>"Dick is one of Nature's waste products," he said. "He has neither
 initiative nor objective in life. How could old Magnus breed such a son? He
 was the cleverest, shrewdest, old devil in the City. Dick is just pap and
 putty&mdash;a good fellow and a useful fellow for holding my lady's wool or
 carrying my lady's Chow, but&mdash;"</p>

 <p>He shook his head. "No 'struggle' there, Steve?" I asked. "Foley's theory
 works out in this case."</p>

 <p>"Foley is a fool," smiled Steven. "What about me? Aren't I my father's
 son?"</p>

 <p>I admitted that.</p>

 <p>"No, Dick lives from breakfast to supper, and could no more work out a
 scheme as his father did than I could knit a necktie."</p>

 <p>"And there is no 'struggle' in the establishment?" I repeated, and he
 nodded gravely. "There is no 'struggle,'" he said, and although he never said
 the words I felt him saying "as yet."</p>

 <p>Steven became a frequent visitor at the Magnus' house&mdash;Dick told me
 this himself. "He's an amusing person," he said&mdash;I met him in the Park,
 and he stopped his car to talk"&mdash;and I can't help feeling that life is a
 little dull for Thelma."</p>

 <p>It was much duller for people who were brought much into contact with
 Thelma, but I did not say so. She was the kind of hostess who wanted
 entertaining.</p>

 <p>Everybody loved Dick in those days, and he was welcomed wherever he went.
 Later, when he passed through that remarkably awkward stage, a stage which we
 usually associate with extreme adolescence, he was not so popular, and I was
 a little bit worried about him. It grieved me to see a man with all the money
 in the world making a playtime of life, because people who live for play can
 find their only recreation in work, and he never expressed the slightest
 desire to engage himself in the pursuit which had built up his father's
 colossal fortune. He rode well, he shot well, he played a good game of golf,
 and it was a case of "Let's get Dick" for a fourth at bridge.</p>

 <p>"The fact is," said Dick, when I tackled him one day, "heavy thinking
 bores me. Maybe if I had to, I would. Sometimes I feel that I have a flash of
 my father's genius, but I usually work out that moment of inspiration in a
 game of solitaire.</p>

 <p>"One afternoon he took me home to tea, arriving a little earlier than
 usual. He was evidently surprised to find Steve's car drawn up near the
 house. He should have been more surprised when he walked through the French
 windows opening from the lawn to the drawing-room, and found Steve and Thelma
 side by side on a settee examining Medici prints. It may have been necessary
 for the proper study of Art that Steve's hand should be upon the girl's
 shoulder. Evidently she did not think so, for she tried to disengage herself,
 but Steve, much more experienced in the ways of the world, kept his hand in
 position and looked up with a smile. As for me, I felt <i>de trop</i>.</p>

 <p>"Hello, people!" said Dick, glaring benignly into the flushed face of the
 girl, "do my eyes behold a scandal in process of evolution? Or have I
 interrupted an exposition on the art of Michael Angelo?"</p>

 <p>Steve rose with a laugh.</p>

 <p>"I brought Thelma some pictures," he said, "they're a new lot just
 published; they are rather fine, don't you think?"</p>

 <p>Dick looked at the pictures and, having no artistic soul, said that they
 struck him as a little old-fashioned, and I saw the girl's lips curl in
 disdain of her husband, and felt a trifle sad.</p>

 <p>Another time (I have learnt since) Dick found them lunching together at
 Madarino's, a curious circumstance in view of the fact that she had said she
 was going to spend the day with her mother.</p>

 <p>Then one afternoon Dick went home and sounded his motor-horn loudly as he
 swept up the drive, and discovered his wife at one end of the drawing-room
 and Steve at the other, and they were discussing Theosophy loudly.</p>

 <p>After tea Dick linked his arm in Steve's and took him into the
 grounds.</p>

 <p>"Steve, old boy," he said affectionately, "I don't think I should come and
 see Thelma unless somebody else is here, old man."</p>

 <p>"Why in Heaven's name shouldn't I?" asked Steve. "What rubbish you talk,
 Dick! Why, I've known Thelma as long as I've known you."</p>

 <p>Dick scratched his chin.</p>

 <p>"Yes, that seems a sound kind of argument," he said. "Still, I wouldn't if
 I were you. You know, servants and people of that kind talk."</p>

 <p>But Steve smacked him on the back and told him not to be a goomp, and
 Thelma was so nice that evening that, when during a week-end Dick surprised
 his wife and Steve one morning walking with linked hands along an
 unfrequented path through the woods, he did no more than give them a cheery
 greeting, and passed on with a grin.</p>

 <p>It was about this time that Dick started on his maladroit career. He
 became careless in his dress, could not move without knocking things over,
 went altogether wrong in his bridge, so that you could always tell which was
 Dick's score by a glance at the block. There was usually a monument of
 hundreds, two hundreds, and five hundreds erected above the line on the debit
 side, and when men cut him as a partner they groaned openly and frankly.</p>

 <p>Harry Wallstein, who is a lunatic collector, gave him a rare Ming vase to
 examine, and Dick dropped it, smashing the delicate china into a hundred
 pieces. Of course he insisted upon paying the loss, but he could not soothe
 Harry's anguished soul. He had a trick too, when he was taking tea with some
 of his women friends, of turning quickly in a drawing-room and sweeping all
 the cups on to the floor. In the street he escaped death by miracles. Once he
 stood in the center of a crowded thoroughfare at the rush hour to admire the
 amethystine skies. A motor lorry and two taxicabs piled themselves up on the
 sidewalk in consequence, for it had been raining and the roads were
 slippery.</p>

 <p>Dick footed the bill for the damage and went on his awkward way. It is
 extraordinary how quickly a man acquires a reputation for eccentricity.
 People forgot the unoffending Dick that used to be, and knew only the
 dangerous fool who was. When he called on Mrs. Tolmarsh, whose collection of
 Venetian glass has no equal in the country, the butler was instructed never
 to leave his side, to guide him in and out of the drawing-room, and under no
 circumstances to allow him to handle the specimens which Mrs. Tolmarsh
 invariably handed round for the admiration of her guests. Nevertheless he
 managed to crash a sixteenth-century vase and a decanter which had been made
 specially for Fillipo, Tyrant of Milan, and was adorned with his viperish
 crest.</p>

 <p>And in the meantime Steven gave up his practice of calling three times a
 week on Mrs. Magnus and called every day.</p>

 <p>Dick did not seem to mind, although he took to returning home earlier than
 had been his practice. I might have warned Dick. I preferred, however, to say
 a few words to Steven, and I got him alone in a corner of the library and I
 did not mince my words.</p>

 <p>"I shall not moralize, Steven," I said, "for that is not my way. You have
 your own code and your own peculiar ideas concerning women, and so far you've
 got away with it. I do not doubt that you will get away with this matter
 because Dick seems to be drifting down the stream towards
 imbecility&mdash;but there are, thank Heaven, a few decent people in this
 town, and if you betray Dick you are going to have a pretty thin time. I
 won't commit the banality of asking you to look before you leap, because I
 know you're a pretty good looker!"</p>

 <p>"Leaper!" he corrected. "No person who looks very carefully leaps at all.
 The world is divided into those two classes&mdash;lookers and leapers.
 Anyway, I am not very greatly concerned by what people think of me. If I
 were, I should have entered a monastery a long time ago. You've been straight
 with me, Doctor, and I'm going to be straight with you. My affairs are my
 affairs and concern nobody else. I shall do just as I think, and take a line
 which brings me the greatest satisfaction."</p>

 <p>"Whosoever is hurt?" I asked.</p>

 <p>"Whosoever is hurt," he said, and meant it. "I know just what is coming to
 me. I have figured it out."</p>

 <p>There was no more to be said. To approach Dick was a much more delicate
 matter, for he was impervious to hints.</p>

 <p>A week after I had talked to Steven I met Hariboy, who is a banker of
 standing and the president of my golf club. I met him professionally, for I
 had been called into his house to perform a minor operation on one of his
 children, and I was cleaning up in his dressing-room when he strolled in, and
 after some talk about the child he said:</p>

 <p>"Steven Martingale is going away."</p>

 <p>"Going away?" I repeated. "How do you know?"</p>

 <p>"I know he has taken steamship accommodations for Bermuda. My secretary
 and his secretary are apparently friends, and she told my girl that Steven is
 doing a lot of rush work, and that he is leaving for a long holiday on the
 18th."</p>

 <p>"Do you know by what line?" I asked, and he told me.</p>

 <p>Luckily the manager of the shipping office was a patient of mine, and I
 made it my business to call on him that afternoon.</p>

 <p>"Yes, the ship leaves on the 18th," he said, "but I haven't Mr. Martingale
 on my passenger list."</p>

 <p>We went through it together, and I traced my finger down the cabin numbers
 and their occupants.</p>

 <p>"Who is this in No. 7 suite?" I asked. He put on his glasses and
 looked.</p>

 <p>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I don't know who they are. It's not an uncommon
 name," he added humorously.</p>

 <p>So that was that!</p>

 <p>I do not think I should have moved any further in the matter if I had had
 the slightest degree of faith in Steven's honesty. But Steven was not a
 marrying man. He had once told me that under no circumstances would he think
 of binding his life with that of any woman, and had expounded his philosophy
 with that cold-blooded logic of his, which left me in no doubt at all that
 whatever fine promises he might make to Thelma Magnus, only one end of that
 advenlure was inevitable.</p>

 <p>I sought Dick all over the town, and ran him to earth in the first place I
 should have looked&mdash;the card-room of Proctor's Club. I entered the room
 in time to hear the peroration of a violent address on idiocy delivered by
 Dick's late partner. His opponents were too busy adding up the score to take
 any interest in the proceeding.</p>

 <p>Dick sat back in his chair, his hands in his pockets, a little smile on
 his thin face.</p>

 <p>"Fortunes of war, old top," he murmured from time to time.</p>

 <p>"Fortunes of war be&mdash;" roared Staine; who was his victim. "You go
 four spades on the queen, knave to five, and not another trick in your
 hand...!"</p>

 <p>"Fortunes of war, old top," said Dick again, paid his opponents and rose,
 upsetting the table and scattering the cards in all directions.</p>

 <p>"Awfully sorry," he murmured; "really awfully sorry!"</p>

 <p>That "awfully sorry" of his came mechanically now.</p>

 <p>"Now, Dick," said I, when I'd got him into my car, "you're coming straight
 home with me, and I'm going to talk to you like an uncle."</p>

 <p>"Oh, Lord!" he groaned. "Not about Thelma?" I was astounded, and I suppose
 looked my astonishment. "Everybody talks to me about Thelma," said Dick
 calmly. "She's a dear, good girl, and as honest as they make 'em. I'm not a
 very amusing chap, you know, Doctor," he said mournfully, "and Steven is the
 kind of fellow who can keep a room in roars of laughter."</p>

 <p>"But, my dear, good man," I said impatiently, "don't you realize that a
 man of Steven's character does not call daily on your wife to tell her funny
 stories?"</p>

 <p>"I don't know," said Dick vaguely. "Thelma seems to like him, and I've
 really no grudge against old Steve. He's a leaper too," he said, with a
 quick, sidelong glance at me, "and that makes him ever so much more
 interesting to the women." he chuckled at my astonishment. "He was telling
 us the other night about that amusing conversation he had with you."</p>

 <p>"He did not tell you the whole of the conversation, I'll swear," said I
 dryly, but Dick showed no curiosity.</p>

 <p>"Old Steven is a good fellow," he repeated. "I like him, and I tell
 everybody who comes to me with stories about him and Thelma that he is my
 very best friend."</p>

 <p>I groaned in the spirit.</p>

 <p>"Then," said I in despair, "it is useless telling you that Steven has
 booked two berths by the steamer which leaves on the 18th for Bermuda."</p>

 <p>He nodded. "I know; he is taking his aunt," he said. "I got the same yarn
 from Chalmers, and I asked Steven, and he told me, yes, he was going
 away&mdash;"</p>

 <p>"In the name of Smith?" I asked pointedly.</p>

 <p>"In the name of Smith," repeated Dick gravely. "After all, he's a big
 power in the financial'world, Doctor, and it is not good business for him to
 advertise his comings and goings."</p>

 <p>After that there was no more to be said.</p>

 <p>"We're having a little party on the 17th at the house. I wish you would
 come along," said Dick before I left him. "I've particularly asked Steve to
 come. It will be a send-off for him, though of course nobody must know that
 he is going abroad."</p>

 <p>The dear, simple fool said this so solemnly that I could have kicked him.
 What could I do? I had a talk with Chalmers, who is as fond of Dick as I am,
 and he could offer no advice.</p>

 <p>"It's hopeless," he said, "and the queer thing is that Dick has arranged
 to go out of town on the night of the 17th. So we can't even drag him to the
 ship to confront this swine!"</p>

 <p>"Do you think he'll marry her?" I asked after a long pause in the
 conversation.</p>

 <p>"Marry her!" scoffed Chalmers. "Did he marry Fay Jennifer? Did he marry
 that unhappy girl Steele? Marry her!"</p>

 <p>It was a big party which Dick gave. His house lay about twenty miles out
 of town and is situated in the most gorgeous country. It was a hot autumn
 day, with a cloudless sky and a warm gentle breeze, the kind of day that
 tempts even the most confirmed of city birds into the open country.</p>

 <p>I do not think it was wholly the salubrious weather that was responsible
 for the big attendance. Half the people, and all the women who were present,
 knew that on the following day Steven Martingale was leaving for Bermuda, and
 that Thelma would accompany him.</p>

 <p>I saw the girl as soon as I arrived, and noted the bright eyes, the
 flushed cheek, and the atmosphere of hectic excitement in which she moved.
 She was a little tremulous, somewhat incoherent, just a thought shrill.</p>

 <p>All Dick's parties were amusing and just a little unconventional. For
 example, in addition to the band and the troupe of <i>al fresco
 performers</i> and Grecian dancers, he usually had some sort of competition
 for handsome prizes, and the young people, particularly, looked forward to
 these functions with the greatest enjoyment. On this occasion there was a
 revolver-shooting competition for ladies and gentlemen, the prize for the
 women being a diamond bangle, and for the men a gold cigarette case.</p>

 <p>Most men imagine themselves to be proficient in the arts which they do not
 practice, and nine out of ten who have never handled a gun boast of their
 marksmanship.</p>

 <p>Dick sought me out and took me into the house and upstairs to his own
 snuggery.</p>

 <p>"Doctor," said he, as he dropped into an easychair and reached for his
 cigarettes, "spare a minute to enlighten me. What was the Crauford smash? I
 only heard a hint of it last night, and I'm told that dad was positively
 wonderful."</p>

 <p>It was queer he had never heard of Ralph Crauford and his fall. Old Man
 Magnus and he were bitter enemies, and whereas Crauford must nag and splutter
 from day to day, Magnus was prepared to wait. As usual he laid his plans
 ahead, and one morning failed to turn up at his office. The rumor spread that
 he was ill, and there was suport for the story, because you could never pass
 his house without seeing a doctor's waiting car. It was a puzzling case, and
 I myself was fooled. So was every specialist we brought in. For weeks at a
 time Magnus would be well, and then he would have a collapse and be absent
 from his office for days.</p>

 <p>And all the time the Crauford crowd were waiting to jump in and smash two
 of the stocks he carried. We had advised a trip abroad, but it was not till
 the end of a year of these relapses and recoveries that he consented. He went
 to Palermo in Sicily, and after a month it was announced tffat he had died.
 Then the fun started. Crauford jumped into the market with a hammer in each
 hand, figuratively speaking. Tyne River Silver fell from 72 to 31, and all
 the time the executors of the estate were chasing one another to discover
 their authority to act. This went on for three days and then the blow fell.
 Old Man Magnus appeared on 'Change, looking a trifle stouter, a little
 browner, and infinitely cheerful.</p>

 <p>Crauford had "sold over." It cost him his bank balance, his town house,
 and his country estate plus his wife's jewelry to get square with Magnus.</p>

 <p>Dick listened to the story, his eyes beaming, interrupting me now and
 again with a chuckle of sheer joy.</p>

 <p>"Wonderful old dad!" he said at the end; "wonderful old boy! And he was
 foxing all the time. Kidding 'em along! The art of it, the consummate art of
 it! Specialists and sea voyages and bulletins every hour!"</p>

 <p>He stood up abruptly and threw away his cigarette.</p>

 <p>"Let's go and see the women shoot," he said.</p>

 <p>There was the usual fooling amongst the girls when their end of the
 competition started. In spite of their "Which-end-shall-I-hold-it?" and their
 mock terror, they shot remarkably well.</p>

 <p>I had caught a glimpse of Steven, a silent, watchful, slightly amused man,
 who most conspicuously avoided Thelma, but came down to the booth and stood
 behind ier when she fired her six shots for the prize. Incidentally not one
 bullet touched the target, and the wobbling of her pistol was pitiful.</p>

 <p>Steven's shooting was beautiful to watch. Every bullet went home in the
 center of the target and the prize was assuredly his.</p>

 <p>"Now watch me, Steve," said Dick, and at the sight of Dick with a gun in
 his hand even his best friends drew back.</p>

 <p>He fired one shot, a bull's-eye, the second shot was a little bit to the
 left, but nevertheless a bull's-eye, the third shot passed through the hole
 which the first had made, the fourth and fifth were on the rim of the black
 center&mdash;and then he turned with a smile to Steven.</p>

 <p>"My old pistol is much better than the best of the new ones," he said.</p>

 <p>He had refused to shoot with the weapons provided, and had brought a long
 ungainly thing of ancient make; but as he was not a competitor in the strict
 sense of the word, there had been no protest.</p>

 <p>The sixth shot went through the bull and there was a general clapping.</p>

 <p>"How's that?" said Dick, twiddling his revolver.</p>

 <p>"Fine," said Steven. "The Looker shoots almost as well as the Leaper,"
 laughed Dick, and pressed the trigger carelessly. There was a shot and a
 scream. Steve balanced himself for a moment, looking at Dick in a kind of
 awed amazement, and then crumpled up and fell.</p>

 <p>As for Dick he stood, the smoking revolver still in his hand, frowning
 down at the prostrate figure.</p>

 <p>"I'm sorry," he muttered, but Steven Martingale had passed beyond the
 consideration of apologies. He was dead before I could reach him.</p>

 <h3>* * * * *</h3>

 <p>That old-fashioned revolver of Dick's had seven chambers, and people
 agreed both before and after the inquest that it was the kind of fool thing
 that Dick would have.</p>

 <p>"He ought to have seen there were seven shots when he loaded the infernal
 weapon," said Chalmers. "Of course, if it was anybody but Dick I should have
 thought that the whole thing was manoeuvred, and that all this awkwardness of
 his had been carefully acted for twelve months in order to supply an excuse
 at the inquest and get the 'Accidental Death' verdict. It is the sort of
 thing that his father would have done. A keen, far-seeing old devil was John
 Magnus."</p>

 <p>I said nothing, for I had seen the look in Dick's eyes when he said
 "leaper."</p>

 <p>At any rate, the shock wakened Dick, for his awkwardness fell away from
 him like an old cloak, and Thelma Magnus must have found some qualities in
 him which she had not suspected, for she struck me as a tolerably happy woman
 when I met her the other day. But I shall not readily forget that hard glint
 in Dick's eyes when he spoke the last words which Steven Martingale was
 destined to hear. I had seen it once before in the eyes of John Seymour
 Magnus the day he smashed Crauford.</p>

 <p>Maybe some of the old man's <i>hormones</i> were working. I should like to
 ask Foley about it.</p><br>

 <h2><a name="story03"
    id="story03">3. THE MAN WHO NEVER LOST</a></h2>

 <p>The man in the gray cashmere suit who lolled with his face to the Hotel de
 Paris was dimly conscious that from one of the balconies he was being
 particularized. He guessed also that he was in process of being described,
 but he was hardened to notoriety. He could almost hear the man tell the girl,
 "That is the celebrated Twyford&mdash;the fellow with the system who breaks
 the bank regularly every week."</p>

 <p>Too lazy and somnolent to raise his head even to identify the newcomers to
 Monte Carlo (as he guessed they were), he stretched his long legs to the sun
 and settled sideways for greater comfort.</p>

 <p>He was forty and grayish. A lean, clean-shaven face; large, regular white
 teeth that showed readily, for he was easily amused; eyes of steady,
 unwinking blue, and a gun-metal nerve: these were some of the features and
 qualities of Aubrey Twyford, The Man Who Never Lost.</p>

 <p>"That's Aubrey Twyford," said the envious young man on the balcony. "I
 wish to Heaven I had half his luck or a tenth."</p>

 <p>"Poor Bobby!" said the girl. Her eyes were sympathetic and kindly, and at
 the pressure of her hand on his arm he turned.</p>

 <p>"Whose luck?"</p>

 <p>The middle-aged lady who came through the French windows and joined them
 on the balcony had no sympathetic quality in her tone, nor was there
 kindliness in her nod.</p>

 <p>"Hello, Bobby," she said, and gave him her cheek; "I heard you had
 arrived. Who were you talking about?"</p>

 <p>He nodded to the square and, shading her eyes, Mrs. Brane took in the
 lounging figure, from the tips of his white shoes to the crown of his gray
 hat.</p>

 <p>"That's Aubrey Twyford&mdash;they call him The Man Who Can't Lose. He
 comes to Monte Carlo every season from February to May and never leaves the
 table except as a winner."</p>

 <p>"Wonderful man!" said Mrs. Brane dryly. "Are you thinking of emulating his
 example, Bobby?"</p>

 <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, aunt," said Bobby Gardner with a laugh, "I
 had hopes."</p>

 <p>She sniffed.</p>

 <p>"I hate gamblers," she said shortly. "He must be a very horrid person."
 She looked again at the object of their conversation.</p>

 <p>Twyford had risen and was walking slowly to meet a short, stout man who
 had come down the steps of the Hotel de Paris.</p>

 <p>"That's Souchet, the big Paris banker. He is a millionaire, and I wouldn't
 change places with him for all his money. His daughter ran away with the
 chauffeur this week, and the poor old gentleman is quite knocked out. He is
 losing money at the tables, but the beggar can well afford it," said Bobby
 gloomily.</p>

 <p>The girl had gone into the room, and his aunt walked closer to him.</p>

 <p>"Why did you come to Monte Carlo, Bobby"</p>

 <p>"Why?" His pretence of surprise was very transparent. "Why, I come here
 every year."</p>

 <p>"But why have you come now?" she asked.</p>

 <p>He did not immediately reply nor meet her eye.</p>

 <p>"I am getting very tired of this business, Bobby," she said quietly. "You
 are making a fool of Madge. The girl is simply worried to death. Why don't
 you propose to her if you are going to?"</p>

 <p>He laughed a little bitterly, for Bobby had occasional moments when he was
 sorry for himself.</p>

 <p>"With &pound;400 a year?"</p>

 <p>"Bah," she said contemptuously, "as if money made any difference!"</p>

 <p>He swung round.</p>

 <p>"It makes a lot of difference. Madge is a very rich girl and I am a very
 poor man. When I can meet her on something like equal terms, I will ask
 her."</p>

 <p>"That is just your vanity," said the elder woman; "man's vanity It would
 not worry you if she were poor and you were rich. You would not regard it as
 being an undignified thing for her to accept your wealth."</p>

 <p>"That is different," he said.</p>

 <p>"Only from a man's point of view," said she, and walked back into the
 sitting-room.</p>

 <p>A quarter of an hour later all three passed into the rooms, through the
 big and terribly serious public room into the ornate <i>Cercle
 Priv&eacute;e</i>. They passed along the roulette tables and came to the
 crowd about the <i>trente-et-quarante</i> players.</p>

 <p>"That is the only game he ever plays," said Bobby in an undertone. "Look
 at him packing it up!"</p>

 <p>Before this man in gray, with his expressionless face and his lean, white
 hands, was a thick pile of thousand-franc notes, and whilst they looked he
 had added 24,000 to his stock. On the opposite side of the table Bobby saw
 the dour, bearded face of Souchet the banker. He was not gambling, unless
 betting in louis can be so described, but five out of every six stakes he
 played were raked to the croupier.</p>

 <p>"Who is Aubrey Twyford?"</p>

 <p>"It is a rum story," said Bobby, leading the girl to one of the seats by
 the wall. "He used to be a professor of psychology, a man who never gambled
 and took his modest holiday every year in Monte Carlo. People who knew him
 here twenty years ago say that he never risked as much as a five-franc piece
 on the table until he discovered his system."</p>

 <p>"Has he a system?" she asked.</p>

 <p>Bobby nodded.</p>

 <p>"The Casino authorities have tried to find what it is. They have had
 detectives and officials watching him for years. All his coups have been
 recorded and examined by the best system experts in Europe, but apparently
 there is no system at all. I have reason to believe they have searched his
 baggage time and time again to discover some clue which will put them on to
 his scheme of play, but they found nothing."</p>

 <p>"That is very strange, Bobby," she said.</p>

 <p>"This is his last season, by the way. He told me yesterday he was chucking
 it up."</p>

 <p>At that moment there was a stir at the table. Souchet and Twyford rose
 together and walked away, Souchet explaining something with a little smile
 and The Man Who Never Lost nodding his reply as he pocketed his winnings.
 Bobby noticed that he needed two pockets.</p>

 <p>"Go on about him," said the girl. "I am fearfully interested."</p>

 <p>"About twelve years ago he started playing, and since then he has never
 looked back. The Casino officials say that he has taken nearly &pound;700,000
 from the tables in the past ten years."</p>

 <p>She frowned.</p>

 <p>"What are you thinking about?" he asked quickly.</p>

 <p>"I had an idea," she said. "That is all."</p>

 <p>He did not press her. Mr. Aubrey Twyford entertained on a lavish scale.
 His table, in a corner of the Caf&eacute; de Paris, was always crowded for
 dinner, and when Bobby and the girl came in that night they found the usual
 throng about him.</p>

 <p>"I forgot something about Twyford, and I ought to tell you this in justice
 to him," he said. "He is most awfully good to people who have bad luck. I
 have known him to go down to see off a man who has gone broke, and to hand
 him an envelope containing every penny he had lost. You see," said Bobby,
 with a smile, "one is frightfully communicative at Monte Carlo, and one knows
 just how the other fellows are doing at the tables. Last season a widow came
 down with &pound;3000 and lost it in four days! She had come down because she
 wanted to raise enough money to buy her son a business. It was a mad sort of
 idea, and Twyford told her so when he got into conversation with her the
 first day she played, and do you know what he did? He gave her &pound;6000 on
 the day she left Monte Carlo on the promise she would not gamble again."</p>

 <p>"It is incredible," said the girl. "Who is that man next to him?"</p>

 <p>"That is young Stanton. His father is a very rich Manchester merchant. He
 won 200,000 francs this afternoon."</p>

 <p>She laughed.</p>

 <p>"Is the financial position of anybody in Monte Carlo secret?" she
 asked.</p>

 <p>"Not a bit," laughed Bobby. "I bet you, the croupiers could tell you your
 income to within a pound."</p>

 <p>Mr. Stanton had taken a little too much wine. He was loud and
 talkative.</p>

 <p>"I'm going to set 'em alight tonight," he said, with a laugh. "Stand by,
 everybody, and wee me break the bank."</p>

 <p>Twyford raised his glass of Vichy water and sipped.</p>

 <p>"It is very unlucky to talk about breaking the bank," he said.</p>

 <p>"Luck?" said the other. "My dear chap, there isn't any luck in it! One has
 only to keep one's head&mdash;"</p>

 <p>"Don't despise luck," said Aubrey. He had a rich mellow voice and spoke
 slowly and deliberately. "There are three lucky moments in every twenty-four
 hours, no more. I have studied the subject very carefully. If you get in on
 the flood-tide of your luck, you can't lose. If you strike any of the other
 minutes you cannot win."</p>

 <p>"Do you suggest that you only win for three minutes in every twenty- four
 hours?" scoffed Stanton.</p>

 <p>"I am not talking about myself," said the other quietly. "I work on a
 system, and by my system I cannot lose."</p>

 <p>"But if you've got a system," persisted Stanton, gulping down a glass of
 champagne, "why is it you are not playing all the time? Why, you go for days
 without making a bet!"</p>

 <p>"I shall bet tonight," said Twyford quietly, "and I shall win and win
 heavily. I am going to play maximums of twelve thousand francs."</p>

 <p>"What we ought to do"&mdash;it was Souchet the banker who spoke&mdash;"is
 to follow our friend, but how? He does not play his stake until they start
 dealing the cards, and then it is too late to follow him." Twyford
 smiled.</p>

 <p>"That is also part of my system," he said dryly.</p>

 <p>The girl leant across the table to Bobby.</p>

 <p>"Bobby," she said, "take me back to the Casino when Mr. Twyford goes. I am
 most anxious to watch his play."</p>

 <p>"I'll get you a seat near him," said Bobby. "There are generally one or
 two sleepers who will give up their seats for a louis."</p>

 <p>"Sleepers?" she said, puzzled.</p>

 <p>"That isn't the name, I don't think," he said, and explained that there
 was a class of habitu&eacute; at the rooms who did nothing but sit on the
 off-chance that somebody would put down a stake and either walk away or
 forget to take his winnings. In this case the wily watcher reaches out his
 hand and rakes in the "sleeper" unless the croupier is extra vigilant and has
 noticed who staked the money.</p>

 <p>Presently the big party broke up, and they strolled through the
 caf&eacute; across the deserted square. With very little difficulty Bobby
 secured a seat, two removed from Twyford, for the girl. immediately opposite
 her sat the optimistic Stanton, flushed and voluble.</p>

 <p>True to his word, Twyford produced a bigger pad of notes than he had taken
 away in the afternoon. His first stake was for twelve thousand francs, and
 this he lost. He lost his second stake on black. He staked again on black and
 won. The girl watched him, fascinated. He dodged from black to red, from red
 to <i>couleur</i>, from <i>couleur</i> to <i>invers</i>, and five out of
 every six coups he won. It was enthralling to the girl, possibly because the
 scene and the setting were so novel and bizarre. She watched the dealer as
 with amazing dexterity he led out the two lines of cards...</p>

 <p><i>"Rouge perd et couleur."</i></p>

 <p>A clicking of counters against rakes, a flutter of mill notes, and
 invariably it seemed it was toward Aubrey Twyford that the notes fluttered.
 She kept note of the colors in a little book which Bobby had provided. There
 was no method in the run of the cards; they dodged from black to red and from
 red to black. They ran three times on black before they started zig-zagging
 from black to red again, and it seemed that everybody at the table was
 losing&mdash;except The Man Who Could Not Lose.</p>

 <p>Mr. Stanton was no longer voluble. His big pile had steadily decreased
 until it was the merest slice. He was losing his nerve. He would put a big
 stake upon a color, then change his mind and withdraw the greater part of it
 before the cards were dealt. Once he put down a maximum, hesitated, and took
 it off, substituting 500 francs on the red. The red won, and he cursed
 audibly. Aubrey Twyford, who had had his maximum on the red, smiled.</p>

 <p>At eleven o'clock Stanton pushed back his chair and walked round to
 Twyford.</p>

 <p>"They've cleaned me out," he said. "I've lost 300,000 francs. You don't
 seem to have done so badly."</p>

 <p>Twyford smiled.</p>

 <p>"Do you want any money?" he asked.</p>

 <p>"No, I've finished for the night," said Stanton. "I'll try again in the
 morning," and walked past him to the bar.</p>

 <p>Twyford caught Bobby's eye and nodded.</p>

 <p>"Come and drink orangeade," he said. "I am bloated with wealth."</p>

 <p>"May I introduce Mr. Twyford?"</p>

 <p>The girl looked into the half-smiling eyes of The Man Who Could Not Lose,
 and saw a whole wealth of humanity and humor in their depths.</p>

 <p>"You must drink orangeade, Miss Radley," he said; "everybody does it."</p>

 <p>"It sounds yery innocuous," she laughed.</p>

 <p>"That is just what we want," said he. "I have been watching your wonderful
 system, Mr. Twyford," she said.</p>

 <p>He chuckled.</p>

 <p>"I hope you are not going to tell people how I do it," he said dryly.
 "Everybody watches my wonderful system and I fear they are as wise as ever,
 though why they should not understand it from the first, Heaven only
 knows."</p>

 <p>They sat down in the big, comfortable armchairs with which the buffet was
 well furnished, and the waiter brought them great tumblers of fragrant
 orange-juice packed to the brim with cracked ice.</p>

 <p>"When I have finished at Monte Carlo, I must write a book about my
 system," said Twyford.</p>

 <p>"And I will be one of your first readers," said the girl. "I am sure I
 shall come straight to Monte Carlo and win a fortune."</p>

 <p>He shook his head, and the smile vanished from his face.</p>

 <p>"It requires a heart of iron to work my system," he said. "It is just
 because I am getting human that I am giving it up."</p>

 <p>Bobby went to the bar to get some sandwiches, and the girl turned to the
 man.</p>

 <p>"Mr. Twyford," she said, speaking rapidly in a low voice, "there is
 something I want to say to you. You are really leaving Monte Carlo for
 good?"</p>

 <p>He nodded.</p>

 <p>"And you are not going to work your system again?"</p>

 <p>"I am not," he said; "that you may be sure."</p>

 <p>"Suppose, Mr. Twyford," she dropped her eyes and fingered the arm of the
 chair nervously, "suppose somebody offered you a big sum for your system,
 would you sell it?"</p>

 <p>She looked up sharply and saw he was smiling.</p>

 <p>"Not for myself," she said, going red, "but there is
 somebody&mdash;somebody I want to see well off."</p>

 <p>"I could not sell it," he said shortly. "I am very, very sorry, and I am
 really acting in the best interests of the&mdash;er&mdash;somebody you want
 to help, but it is impossible."</p>

 <p>She bit her lip.</p>

 <p>"May I ask you not to tell&mdash;?"</p>

 <p>He raised his hand to stop her and regarded the returning Bobby with more
 interest. Her aunt came into the buffet at that moment and claimed her.</p>

 <p>"You ought to be in bed, Madge," she said. "Bobby, why do you keep Madge
 up so late?"</p>

 <p>Then she saw Twyford, and the girl introduced them.</p>

 <p>"Have you been teaching them your system, Mr. Twyford?" she asked, with a
 little smile.</p>

 <p>"I teach all Monte Carlo my system," he laughed, "and really the Casino
 should charge a fee to see me play."</p>

 <p>When the women had gone, Twyford turned to Bobby and favored him with a
 long scrutiny.</p>

 <p>"Mr. Gardner," said the elder man, "you aren't playing today."</p>

 <p>Bobby shrugged as he sank back in his seat.</p>

 <p>"What's the use?" he said. "I fool about with louis, and I neither make
 money nor lose money. I haven't the nerve to be a gambler, and yet I never
 have been so tempted to risk every cent I have as I am today.</p>

 <p>Twyford sucked at his straw.</p>

 <p>"Bad news?" he asked.</p>

 <p>"No," said Bobby, "just a realization of what a perfectly useless ass I
 am!"</p>

 <p>"That sort of thing does upset you," said Twyford.</p>

 <p>"Do you know what I am going to do?" asked Bobby suddenly, and his fresh
 young face fired at the thought. "I'm going tb have a real old gamble
 tomorrow. I've got a couple of thousand pounds which I've been putting aside
 for&mdash;for&mdash;well, for something, and I'm going to play thousand-franc
 stakes!"</p>

 <p>"You will lose," said Twyford, without hesitation. "Every man who goes out
 to win big money because he must win big money loses."</p>

 <p>"How do you know I must?" said the other sharply.</p>

 <p>"I gather from your tone that it is necessary for you to have a lot of
 money," said Twyford, "and when a man goes out to win that money he
 loses."</p>

 <p>"Always?"</p>

 <p>"In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred," said Twyford; "I think the
 percentage is a little higher. I kept very complete psychological data during
 the first few years I was at Monte Carlo, and I think it works out at
 ninety-nine point four per cent."</p>

 <p>Bobby stared at him.</p>

 <p>"Then I am going to be the point six per cent. that wins!" he said, and
 rushed off to see the girl before she retired for the night.</p>

 <p>Twyford looked after him with a little smile, then with a shrug of his
 shoulders he beckoned the waiter.</p>

 <p>Bobby Gardner came down to the vestibule of the hotel the next morning and
 found Twyford reading a newspaper. "I was waiting for you," he said. "Do you
 think you could persuade your ladies to take an auto ride to Grasse?"</p>

 <p>"It is awfully kind of you," said Bobby gratefully.</p>

 <p>The girl was at first reluctant. She had felt the last night's refusal as
 a rebuff, but Mrs. Brane wanted to go to Grasse to buy some perfumes, and
 Madge consented.</p>

 <p>It was a much more pleasant ride than she had anticipated. The beauties of
 the Grand Cornich had been so often described to her that she was prepared to
 be bored, but the wonder of hill and valley, of narrow mountain roads and
 dizzy precipices, filled her with amazement and delight.</p>

 <p>It was on the journey back, when they had stopped at the Gorge du Loup for
 afternoon tea, that Aubrey Twyford beckoned her more with a look than a
 gesture, and she detached herself from Bobby and went to him.</p>

 <p>"I have been thinking of what you said last night," he said. "Will you
 walk a little way up the Gorge with me?"</p>

 <p>"About the system?" she said quickly.</p>

 <p>He nodded.</p>

 <p>"You will sell it?"</p>

 <p>"No, I will not sell it," he said, "but I will give it to you. I have
 decided to leave Monte Carlo tomorrow. All the stories they tell about me are
 perfectly true. I am a very rich man, and there is no further need for me to
 gamble. First," he said, turning and facing her, "you must promise me that
 you will not reveal my secret until after I have left Monte Carlo."</p>

 <p>"I promise," she said, "but&mdash;"</p>

 <p>"There must be no 'buts,'" he said, "not even to Mr. Gardner!"</p>

 <p>He saw the colour mount to her cheek, and smiled inwardly, then, taking
 her arm, he slowly paced the road, and the system of The Man Who Could Not
 Lose was revealed.</p>

 <p>At first she was incredulous. Then she felt a sense of revulsion. Then, as
 his calm, even tones related the story of his years at Monte Carlo, she
 recognized that he was speaking as a doctor might speak about his cases,
 cold-bloodedly and scientifically. At the end of the revelation she held out
 her hand.</p>

 <p>"I am awfully obliged and grateful to you, Mr. Twyford. No, I shan't tell
 Bobby, and I don't think I shall tell anybody else."</p>

 <p>"You will see tonight," he repeated for the second time.</p>

 <p>She inclined her head gravely. They were nearing the party again when he
 said suddenly:</p>

 <p>"Miss Radley, Bobby Gardner is a real good fellow, as clean a specimen of
 a boy as I have ever met. I have seen him here year after year, and I have
 particularly studied him."</p>

 <p>She had gone very red, but it was with a smile that she asked:</p>

 <p>"Why do you tell me this, Mr. Twyford?"</p>

 <p>"It was quite unnecessary," he agreed. "I am sure you have noticed those
 qualities yourself."</p>

 <p>The <i>trente-et-quarante</i> table was crowded when Twyford took his
 seat. Bobby, bright of eye and inordinately cheerful, laid his modest fortune
 before him, and nodded brightly to Twyford. Then the gambling began. Bobby
 started with a stake of a thousand francs and won. He increased his stake and
 won again. With the exception of three he won twelve successive coups, and
 suddenly Twyford rose from the table with a little laugh, picked up the
 remainder of his money, and left the <i>trente- et-quarante</i> table for
 good.</p>

 <p>He stood watching Bobby, and Bobby was winning heavily until the girl
 whispered something in his ear when he, too, rose, both hands filled with
 notes and counters.</p>

 <p>Twyford was sitting on a bench smiling, and he jerked his head inviting
 them, but he was only looking at the girl.</p>

 <p>"Come and sit down," he said. "I want to ask you a question."</p>

 <p>He shook an admonitory forefinger at her, and she laughed. "I am not going
 to ask you whether you told Bobby Gardner my precious secret," he said.</p>

 <p>"I thought you were," she replied in surprise. "I am merely going to ask
 you this. Have you become engaged to Bobby since I saw you last?" She
 nodded.</p>

 <p>"That explains it," said the other. He rose and shook hands with both of
 them, and The Man Who Could Not Lose left the gaming rooms, never to
 reappear.</p>

 <p>"You see," began the girl, "Mr. Twyford was a great psychologist."</p>

 <p>"But do you mean to say," said the incredulous Bobby, "that he told you
 his system before he left?"</p>

 <p>She nodded.</p>

 <p>"By the way," he added, "do you know he lost nearly 200,000 francs last
 night!"</p>

 <p>She nodded again. "I guessed that," she said, "but I don't think that will
 worry him very much."</p>

 <p>"What was the system?" said Bobby.</p>

 <p>"I was telling you," said the girl severely, "when you interrupted. He
 studied the people of Monte Carlo, especially the gambling people, for eight
 years, and the thing he discovered was that there are conditions under which
 a gambler cannot win. If a man is worried about some outside matter, if he is
 losing steadily and cannot afford to lose, or if he comes to the tables and
 simply must win money, Mr. Twyford knew that whatever else happened, his
 money would go, and the majority of his stakes would vanish. And when he
 found this out he took the trouble to discover who at Monte Carlo was in
 trouble, who wanted money very badly, who was playing with their last
 stakes&mdash;and he played against them. If they backed red he backed black,
 if they backed <i>couleur</i> he backed <i>invers</i>."</p>

 <p>"Good lord!" gasped Bobby; "was that playing the game?"</p>

 <p>"That's what I asked him," said the girl, "and he had no difficulty in
 convincing me that it was. It was not he who was influencing the bad luck of
 the others, their bad luck was simply influencing him to fortune. Sometimes
 the man with the bad luck would only lose a few thousand francs, and Mr.
 Twyford would win hundreds of thousands by betting against him. If he knew a
 man or woman whom he 'had played against was ruined, he always made good
 their losses before they left&mdash;he said he could afford to, because he
 was very often playing twelve thousand francs against their forty. He said it
 is the only system in the world, and I believe it is."</p>

 <p>"But why did he lose last night?" asked Bobby, and the girl smiled.</p>

 <p>"I suppose it was because he was playing against somebody who ought to
 have been radiantly happy," she said. "Didn't you hear him ask me if I had
 accepted you?"</p>

 <h2><a name="story04"
    id="story04">4. THE CLUE OF MONDAY'S SETTLING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It did not seem possible to May Antrim that such things
could happen in
an ordered world. She paced the terrace of the big house overlooking the most
beautiful vale in Somerset, her hands clasped behind her, her pretty head bent,
a frown of perplexity upon her pretty face.</p>

  <p>Everything must go... Sommercourt... the home farms... the house in
Curzon Street... her horses... she checked a sob and was angry with herself
that it needed the check.</p>

  <p>And why?</p>

  <p>Because John Antrim had signed a paper&mdash;she thought such things only
happened in romances. Her father's stability she had never questioned. She
knew, as all the county knew, that he was a wealthy man beyond fear of
disaster. And out of the blue had come this shattering bolt. It was incredible.
Then she caught a glimpse of him. He was sitting in his favorite seat at the
far end of the terrace, and at the sight of that dejected figure, she quickened
her pace.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a faint smile as she came up to him, dropping her hand
on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Well, May? Thinking things out, too!"</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to," she said, "but I find it difficult to make a start. You
see, dear, I don't understand business..."</p>

  <p>"Sit down."</p>

  <p>He made a place for her by his side.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you a story. Sounds formidable, eh? It begins on the
18th of March when the steamship Phoenician Prince left New York for
Southampton. She is a vessel of 18,000 tons, one of two, the property of the
Balte Brothers, Septimus Balte and Francis Balte being the partners who control
the stock."</p>

  <p>"Our Francis?" asked the girl in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Our Francis," repeated John Antrim grimly.</p>

  <p>He went on:</p>

  <p>"On board were five million in British, French, and Italian notes, which
had been redeemed from the American money market, and were being consigned to
the Anglo-American Bank of London. These were packed in six tin cases, soldered
air and water tight, and enclosed in stout wooden boxes. They were deposited in
the strong-room, which is on the port side of G Deck. Its door opens into a
cabin which is occupied in extraordinary circumstances by a quartermaster.</p>

  <p>"On this occasion one of the owners was on board, Mr. Francis Balte, and
because of the importance of the consignment he had the quartermaster 's cabin
fitted up for his own use. During the day, and when Mr. Balte was absent from
the cabin, it was occupied by his personal steward, Deverly.</p>

  <p>"Francis kept the key of the strong-room in his possession. It never left
him day or night. On the night of the 26th, the purser went to Francis with
certain documents relating to the money. Francis opened the doors of the
strongroom and the purser checked the packages; the door was closed and locked.
There was no bathroom attached to the cabin, and Balte used an ordinary sponge
bath which was brought in by the steward, together with a dozen small towels.
These were used to lay on the floor, with the idea of saving the carpet, which
had been newly laid&mdash;in fact, especially for Mr. Balte's comfort. The
steward went in later, took away the bath and six towels, the other six being
unused."</p>

  <p>May frowned again. What had the towels to do with the narrative?</p>

  <p>He must have interpreted her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I have interviewed the steward," he said, "and the loss of the towels
seemed to him to be the queerest part of the whole proceedings. The next
morning, as the ship approached the Needles, the purser came down, accompanied
by half a dozen seamen. Balte was asleep, but he got up and handed the key of
the strong- room to the purser, who opened the doors, to
find&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"I should never have underwritten such a vast amount."</p>

  <p>"You underwrite!" she gasped. "Is that why... you are responsible for the
money?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was stark madness," he said bitterly. "Ordinarily I should only have
been saddled with a small proportion of the loss. But in a moment of insanity I
accepted the whole risk. That is the story.</p>

  <p>"The ship was searched from end to end&mdash;every inch of it. The
steward was on duty in the alleyway outside&mdash;he sat with his back to the
door, dozing he admits. It was impossible for anybody to get through the
porthole, supposing, as was the first theory of the police, that a man let
himself down over the side and scrambled through the port. The steward was full
of the mystery of the towels&mdash;six towels and six boxes of notes! But in
one respect he was very informative. He distinctly heard in the middle of the
night a sound like that of a watch or clock being wound up. 'Creak, creak,
creak'&mdash;he gave me a wonderful imitation."</p>

  <p>"What on earth was it?"</p>

  <p>"He heard it six times faintly but distinctly. He says so now, but he
also says that he thought it might have been the creaking of gear&mdash;one
hears strange noises on board ship. And we come again to the fact that six
towels were missing. To my mind that is significant. The boxes were very heavy,
by the way, many of the notes were of small denomination and had been subjected
to hydraulic pressure in the packing to get them into as small a compass as
possible. Roughly each box weighed 140 pounds with its iron clamps and
bands."</p>

  <p>May was interested.</p>

  <p>"I never realized that paper money had weight," she said. "How many five
pound notes could an ordinary man carry?"</p>

  <p>"A strong man could carry &pound;100,000 worth," replied Antrim," but he
would not care to carry that amount very far. So there it is, my dear.
Somewhere in the world is a clever thief in the possession of nearly a third of
a ton of negotiable paper. And I am responsible."</p>

  <p>They sat in silence until</p>

  <p>"Daddy... why don't you see Bennett Audain?"</p>

  <p>"Bennett?" he was startled, and then a smile played at the corner of his
lips. "Bennett came to me just before I left town. He had heard from somebody
that I was involved and, like the good fellow that he is, offered to help
with... with money. I had an idea that I would see Francis."</p>

  <p>She pursed her lips thoughtfully. Francis Balte she knew and did not
dislike. She had met him at the house in town&mdash;a vague, cheery man, full
of commonplace phrases.</p>

  <p>"You mean that I should let Bennett take the case in hand!" asked John
Antrim, with a little grimace. "I mistrust amateur detectives, and although I
admit your cousin is clever&mdash;he is also the veriest amateur. Curiously
enough the loss of the towels interested him more than the loss of the
money."</p>

  <p>Her mind was made up.</p>

  <p>"You are to telephone Bennett that we are dining with him tonight," she
said determinedly.</p>

  <p>"My dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Daddy, you must do it&mdash;I feel that Bennett is the one man who can
help."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The real seven ages of man's conscious existence may be divided into the
periods when he wishes to drive a locomotive, when he wants to be a detective,
an Adonis, a soldier (or sailor), a millionaire, a prime minister, and a
boy.</p>

  <p>Bennett Audain never got beyond the second period, but he realized some
of the others, for he had been a soldier, he was undoubtedly good-looking, and
as unquestionably rich.</p>

  <p>The right kind of obsession is an invaluable asset for a young man of
great possessions, and to current crime he devoted the passionate interest of
the enthusiast. He was both student and worker; he had as great a knowledge of
the science which is loosely described as "criminology" as men who had gained
fame in its exposition; he certainly understood the psychology of the criminal
mind better than any police officer that ever came from Scotland Yard&mdash;an
institution which has produced a thousand capable men, but never a genius.
Indefatigable, patient, scientific in the sense that science is the fanaticism
for veracity," which is the scientist's basic quality.</p>

  <p>"It is queer that a fellow like you should take up psycho-analysis. I
should have thought it was just a little off your beat." John Antrim looked
critically through his glass of port.</p>

  <p>"There are queerer things," said Bennett, with an amused glance at the
girl. "It is queer, for example, that having taken a hundred-mile journey to
consult me about the strong-room robbery, you haven't yet mentioned it."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled, but the frown on her father's face deepened.</p>

  <p>"Don't sneer at psycho-analysis, Daddy," she warned him. "Bennett will
give us a demonstration&mdash;won't you, Bennett?"</p>

  <p>They were dining together at Bennett Audain's house in Park Lane. The big
room was dark save for the shaded lamps on the table and the soft glow that
flushed the Persian rug before a dying fire.</p>

  <p>Bennett had a nervous smile, charming in its diffidence.</p>

  <p>"That is a popular label for a queer new system of mind-probing," he
said. "I am not accepting or rejecting the Freudian philosophy, and I'm not
enough of a doctor to understand his theory of neuroses. I merely say that
those responsible for the detection and prevention of crime might, with profit,
employ the theory of idea-association."</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew a pattering of rain against the curtained window.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said John Antrim, and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>Bennett laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I knew you would look at your watch when you heard the rain," he said,
and the other stared. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Association of ideas," said the other calmly. "You told me when you came
that you thought of leaving May in London and driving back alone to
Sommercourt. Uncle John," he leant across, coming from the dusk of shadow into
the yellow light, "if I could get the right man to question I would save you
exactly a million!"</p>

  <p>Antrim frowned horribly.</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," he said, in his gruffest tone. "I have been caught. But I
was a fool to underwrite the whole consignment&mdash;a mad fool. You can do
nothing; the best and cleverest police officers are working on the case. "What
could you do&mdash;by psycho-analysis?"</p>

  <p>He leant back with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Who is the right man?" asked May eagerly.</p>

  <p>Bennett, his eyes fixed on vacancy, did not answer at once.</p>

  <p>"Where is Francis?"</p>

  <p>The girl started, as well she might, for the question was shot at him
with unexpected violence.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;-only I had an idea"&mdash;Bennett Audain was apologetic
to a point of panic. "I&mdash;I get a little explosive at times, which is
terribly unscientific "</p>

  <p>"But is human," smiled the other.</p>

  <p>John Antrim got up.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he is at the Elysium Club?"</p>

  <p>"There is a 'phone over there." Bennett pointed to the shadows. "It is
rather late, but perhaps he'll come round."</p>

  <p>Antrim hesitated. Before he could make up his mind what to do, May was
'phoning.</p>

  <p>Apparently Balte was at the club.</p>

  <p>"He's on his way," she smiled; "poor soul, he was most embarrassed to
hear my voice."</p>

  <p>May returned to the table.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, what a night! You can't return to Sommercourt, Daddy."</p>

  <p>The rain was swishing savagely at the windows, the ceaseless broom-like
sweep of it across the panes, the faint tick of the enamel clock on the high
mantelpiece, and the wheezy breathing of Bennett's old terrier, stretched
before the fire, were the only sounds in the room until Balte came with a
clatter.</p>

  <p>He was a stout man of thirty-five, fair and ruddy of face, and he brought
into the shadowy room something of his own inexhaustible vitality.</p>

  <p>"Glad to come, Miss Antrim." He stopped dead at the sight of John Antrim.
"Pretty wild night, eh&mdash;I'm blessed if it has stopped blowing since I
arrived. Old Sep writes that he was in Torquay yesterday, and the sea was
absolutely breaking over the front&mdash;tramcars drenched and wrecked. Funny,
being wrecked in a tramcar."</p>

  <p>He put his red hands to the blaze and rattled on.</p>

  <p>"Dreadful thing, eh, Miss Antrim! "What's the use of the police&mdash;eh?
What's the use of 'em? Want men like Audain, full of up-to-date ideas. Wish it
had been anybody but you, Antrim." He shook his head mournfully.</p>

  <p>"Ever heard of Freud?" asked Bennett, his chin on his clasped hands, his
absent gaze on the fire.</p>

  <p>"Freud&mdash;no. German, isn't he? Nothing to do with the Germans, old
boy, after that beastly war. They sunk three of our ships, by gad! Who is he,
anyway?"</p>

  <p>"A professor," said Bennett lazily, "and an authority on the mind. Why
don't you sit down, Balte?"</p>

  <p>"Prefer standing, old boy. Stand and grow better&mdash;eh, Miss Antrim?
What about this Hun?"</p>

  <p>"He interprets dreams "</p>

  <p>"Ought to be in the Police, that's where he ought to
be&mdash;interpreting some of those pipe-dreams they have," he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what I am getting at," said Bennett and explained.</p>

  <p>May held her breath, sensing the deadliness of the play.</p>

  <p>Mr. Balte was amused.</p>

  <p>"You say one word and I'll tell you a word it suggests?" he said. "That's
a kid's game&mdash;used to play it when I was so high. You say 'sugar,' I say
'sweet'; next fellow says 'orange,' and so forth."</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Balte," interrupted May, "Bennett thinks he can get at your
sub- conscious mind. He believes that he can even tell what happened when you
were asleep."</p>

  <p>Mr. Balte pulled at his nose and looked down. He was thinking. He
wondered if Bennett Audain could get at his mind about May Antrim, and could
put into words all that he had dreamed yet had not dared to say, all that he
had schemed for. The thought caught his breath. He loved her so, this girl
whose beautiful face had never left his vision; he had dared so much for her
and she never knew. To her he was one of the thousands who served as a
background of life.</p>

  <p>"Try, old boy," he said huskily; "I don't believe in it, but if you can
get hold of any information that will help Mr. Antrim&mdash;you don't know how
I feel about that&mdash;go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Sit down."</p>

  <p>Mr. Balte obeyed. His china-blue eyes were fixed on his interrogator.</p>

  <p>"Ground," said Bennett unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"Eh&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;-earth," responded the other.</p>

  <p>"Dig."</p>

  <p>"Garden."</p>

  <p>"Hole."</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;I nearly said 'devil,' " chuckled Mr. Balte. "This is
funny&mdash;like a game"</p>

  <p>But it was an earnest game with Bennett Audain. Presently:</p>

  <p>"Shares," he said.</p>

  <p>"Slump," it came promptly, one word suggested by the other. Balte added:
"Everything is slumping just now, you know..."</p>

  <p>They went on quickly. Bennett recited the days of the week.</p>

  <p>"Monday?"</p>

  <p>A grimace&mdash;the faintest&mdash;from Balte.</p>

  <p>"Er-unpleasant&mdash;starting the week, y'know."</p>

  <p>Bennett shot out the days.</p>

  <p>"Friday!"</p>

  <p>"Calendar&mdash;thinking of a calendar, y'know."</p>

  <p>"Key?"</p>

  <p>"In door."</p>

  <p>He got up.</p>

  <p>"A silly game, Audain." He shook his head reproachfully. "Admit it. I
can't play games&mdash;too worried. Poor old Sep is half off his head, too."</p>

  <p>"Where is Septimus?" asked Bennett.</p>

  <p>"At Slapton&mdash;pike-fishing. Hmm, how people can sit in a punt all
day... fishing. Well, what are you going to do, Audain? Can you help us? The
police&mdash;pshaw!"</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me this?" asked Bennett. "Are you a heavy sleeper?"</p>

  <p>The stout man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you sleep late in the mornings?"</p>

  <p>"No; up at six, bright and jolly." He paused. "Now I come to think of it,
I was very sleepy that morning. Drugs, eh... do you think I was
drugged&mdash;chloroform and that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Bennett, and let him go.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked the girl when the door had closed upon the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Stay in town for a day or two," said Bennett Audain.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock the next morning he called a justly annoyed police
inspector from his bed. Fortunately Bennett knew him very well.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Audain; his trunks were searched. Mr. Balte insisted."</p>

  <p>"How many trunks had he in the cabin?"</p>

  <p>The inspector, cursing such matutinal inquisitiveness, answered:</p>

  <p>"Four."</p>

  <p>"Four? Big ones?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; pretty big and half empty."</p>

  <p>"Did you smell anything peculiar about them?"</p>

  <p>The inspector wagged his head impatiently. His legs were getting cold and
the bed he had left was entrancingly warm.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I did not smell them."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Bennett's cheerful voice.</p>

  <p>"The worst of these amateur detectives is that they jump all ways at
once," said the inspector as he shuddered back to bed.</p>

  <p>"M'm," said his wife, on the border-line of wakefulness.</p>

  <p>Bennett, at his end of the wire, looked out of the window into the gray
moist morning on to the stark, uneasy branches of park trees.</p>

  <p>The hour was 7.5. Essential people had not yet turned in their beds; even
the serving-maids and men-servants had scarcely blinked at the toilsome day.
Bennett Audain went back to the remains of his breakfast and wished, when he
had had Francis Balte under examination, he had said, "Paint." Mr. Balte would
surely have responded "See."</p>

  <p>Mr. Balte had a large house at Wimbledon. He was a bachelor, as was his
brother. He was a simple man, as also was his brother. They had inherited
considerable property at a time&mdash;the last year of the war&mdash;when
property had a fictitious value. The cream of their father's estate had been
swallowed by the Treasury in the shape of death duties. Their skimmed milk was
very thin and blue in the days of the great slump. Stockholders in Balte
Brothers Incorporated Shippers&mdash;and they were many&mdash;watched the
shrinking of profits indignantly. The last general meeting of the Company had
been a noisy one. There was one fellow in particular, a bald man with
spectacles, Francis had noted miserably from his place on the platform&mdash;a
violent, intemperate man, who had talked of a change of directors, and he had
received more "hear-hears" than had Francis when he had expressed the pious
hope that trade would improve and shipping return to its old prosperity.</p>

  <p>It was Sunday morning, and Francis sat in his library. It was a room
containing many shelves of books which he had never read, but the bindings of
which were in the best taste. His elbows were on the table, his fingers in his
untidy hair, and he was reading. Not the Sunday newspapers, his usual Sunday's
occupation.</p>

  <p>These were stacked, unopened, on the little table by the easy-chair. It
was a book, commonly and commercially bound, and the more he read the more
bewildered he grew. A little shocked also, for this volume was embarrassingly
intimate.</p>

  <p>Thus his brother found him. Septimus, lank and bent and short-sighted,
glared through his powerful glasses at the studious figure and sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Got it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Francis closed the book with a bang.</p>

  <p>"It is all medical stuff," he said. "Audain is a bit cranky. Going?"</p>

  <p>The question was unnecessary. Septimus was muffled to the chin, his fur
gloves were under his arm, and his big racing car was visible from the library
window.</p>

  <p>"If there is anything in this Audain stuff, let me know. I've read
something about psychoanalysis&mdash;I thought it was for shell-shocked people.
So long."</p>

  <p>"When will you be back?"</p>

  <p>"Tuesday night. I've written the letter."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>Francis stirred the fire thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Create a bit of a stir your resigning from the Board," he said;
"wish..."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. I was going to say that I wished it was me. Better you.
Everybody knows you're in bad health.... Warm enough?"</p>

  <p>"Ay," said his brother, and went out pulling on his gloves.</p>

  <p>Francis did not go to the window to see him off. He bent over the fire
uncomfortably, jabbing it unreasonably.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him after a long time that his brother had not gone. He
put down the poker and shuffled across to the window&mdash;he was wearing
slippers. There were two cars in the road, bonnet to bonnet, and a man was
standing by the seated Septimus. They were talking.</p>

  <p>"Audain," said Francis, and meditated, biting his lip. Presently Septimus
went off and Bennett Audain came briskly up the path. Francis admitted him.</p>

  <p>"Energetic fellow!" he cried. His voice was an octave higher than it had
been when he spoke to his brother, his manner more virile and masterful. He was
good cheer and complacency personified. "Come in, come in. You saw old Sep?
Poor old chap!"</p>

  <p>"He tells me that he is resigning from the shipping business." Bennett
was warming his hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes; he's going to the south of France, old Sep. Going to buy property.
Queer bird, Sep. But he was always a land man&mdash;farms, houses... anything
to do with land... very shrewd."</p>

  <p>Bennett glanced at the table, and the other anticipated.</p>

  <p>"Interpretation of Dreams&mdash;eh?" he chuckled. "You've got me going on
Freud.</p>

  <p>Don't understand it. Of course I understand what he says about dreaming
and all that... but that game of yours... eh?"</p>

  <p>Bennett changed the subject, Francis wondering.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is not a bad house," he agreed amiably. "A bit bourgeoise, but
we're that kind. Quaintly constructed&mdash;would you like to see over it?"</p>

  <p>A home and its attractions can be a man's weakness. In a woman, its
appointments are the dominating values , architecture means no more than
convenience. And Bradderly Manor was a source of satisfaction to Francis. They
reached the wind- swept grounds in time, because there was a workshop in which
old Sep labored. It was to him what laboratory, studio, music-room, model
dairy, and incubatory are to other men. It was a workshop, its walls lined with
tool cabinets. There was a bench, an electric lathe, vices, drills... an oak
panel with its unfinished cupids and foliage testified to the artistry and
workmanship of Septimus Balte.</p>

  <p>"Always was a wonderful workman, old Sep," said Francis in admiration.
"Do you know, he was the inventor of a new depth charge that would have made
his name if the war hadn't finished "</p>

  <p>"That's it, is it?"</p>

  <p>Francis looked round.</p>

  <p>Bennett had taken from a shelf a large paint can. It had not been opened.
The manufacturer's red label pasted on the top of the sunken lid was
unbroken.</p>

  <p>"That's what?"</p>

  <p>Bennett held the can for a second and replaced it.</p>

  <p>"Luminous paint," he said. "Lefvre's&mdash;he's the best maker, isn't
he?"</p>

  <p>Francis Balte said nothing. All the way back to the house he said
nothing. Bennett followed him into the library and watched him as he filled a
pipe from a jar which he took from the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said miserably. Bennett saw tears in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The two things I am not sure about are," Bennett ticked them off on his
fingers: "One, was John Steele the cause? Two, why the towels?"</p>

  <p>The stout man puffed furiously and all the time his eyes went blink,
blink, blink.</p>

  <p>"Friday&mdash;Calendar; that's how you knew. You wouldn't think I'd fall
so easily. But you must have known all about it or why should you know I meant
the Racing Calendar?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed. I did not know that you and your brother had a stud of horses
and raced them in the name of John Steele. That was easy to discover. When I
decided that it was the Racing Calendar you meant, the official journal of the
Jockey Club, I went to the publishers and got the register of assumed
names."</p>

  <p>The pipe puffed agitatedly. No... we lost money on racing, but that
wasn't it; bad business... over-valuation of assets. I wonder what she will
think about me..."</p>

  <p>He sank down in a chair, the pipe dropped from his mouth, and he wept
into his big red hands.</p>

  <p>"I have no interest in punishment," said Bennett Audain, and May Antrim,
watching the pain in his delicate face, nodded. She was beginning to understand
Bennett Audain.</p>

  <p>"In solutions of curious human puzzles, yes," said Bennett, as he sipped
his tea and noted joyously the first splashes of green that had come to the
park trees in one night, "but not in punishment. If you like to put it that
way, I am unmoral. Your father received his money?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he did, Bennett&mdash;the six boxes arrived at his office
yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>Bennett laughed very softly. "It is good to be alive when the buds are
breaking, May. I feel a very happy man. Suppose you wanted a clockwork
contrivance made, where would you go to get the work done? Look up the
Classified Directory. No mention of clockwork- makers or makers of mechanical
toys. Yet there are ten people in London who do nothing else. There is a man
named Collett in Highbury who made a sort of time- bomb during the war. I went
to him after I had learnt that Septimus Balte was working on war inventions. I
found that by patient inquiry. It is queer how soon people have forgotten all
things pertaining to the war."</p>

  <p>"But why did you inquire about clockwork at all?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Creak!" mocked Bennett. "Did your father tell you how the steward had
heard a noise, six noises, as of a watch being wound? Well, I found Mr. Collett
a secretive, furtive man, but reasonable. He had made a simple water-tight
machine. It operated a large spool which was held in position by a catch and
released three hours after it had been set. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>May nodded.</p>

  <p>"Why water-tight?" asked Bennett. "The spool itself was outside, and
presumably was designed to work in the water. Attached to the steel box
containing the mechanism were two iron bolts, one at the top above the spool,
one at the bottom. Now what was attached to the spool? Nothing but ten fathoms
of stout light, cord, a double length of it. Now do you see?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted the puzzled girl.</p>

  <p>"Then I will explain further. At the end of the cord was a small cork
buoy, probably covered with canvas and certainly treated with luminous paint.
The towels&mdash;" he laughed,</p>

  <p>"I ought to have thought of the use to which they would be put, but I had
not seen the cabin. And the strange thing is that when I put myself in the
place of Francis, it never occurred to me that if boxes weighing 140 pounds and
clamped with iron were pushed through a porthole, the brass casings of the port
would be scratched&mdash;unless the boxes were wrapped in cloth of some
kind."</p>

  <p>"Then he threw the boxes into the sea!" gasped May, sitting back.</p>

  <p>Bennett nodded.</p>

  <p>"First he took the buoys and attachments from his trunks, then he wound
up the mechanism, threw that and the buoy out of the porthole&mdash;the buoy
being attached by a short length of chain to the under-bolt of the clock-work
case &mdash;then he heaved up the money-box and pushed that after. They sank
immediately. No belated passenger leaning over the rail would see a luminous
buoy floating back. Nobody saw those buoys but Septimus, waiting in his motor-
boat twelve miles south of Slapton Sands. And he did not see them until the
three hours passed and, the spools releasing the buoys, they came to the
surface. Then he fastened a stouter rope to one of the double cords and rove it
through the bolt.... He salvaged all six boxes in an hour, which isn't bad for
a sick man."</p>

  <p>She shook her head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"How... why... did you guess?"</p>

  <p>"Guess?" Bennett's eyebrows rose. "It wasn't a guess. Who else would have
stolen the boxes? In fiction the thief is the last man you suspect. In fact,
the thief is the last man you'd acquit. The police always suspect the man who
was last seen near the scene of the crime, and the police are generally right.
I knew half the Balte secret when the word 'key' suggested 'wind' and
'Monday'&mdash;the day racing men settle their bets&mdash;suggested
'unpleasant'."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Francis and 'poor old Sep' should at this moment be boarding the
Rotterdam at Plymouth," he said.</p>

  <p>"But why... he had heavy losses, but he would not have been ruined. Did
he want the money so badly "</p>

  <p>"There is a woman in the case," said Bennett gravely. "Somebody he dreamt
about and planned for."</p>

  <p>"Poor man!" said May softly. There were tears in her eyes, he noticed,
and remembered Francis Balte's words: "I wonder what she will think about
me?"</p>

<hr>

 <h2><a name="story05"
    id="story05">5. CODE NO. 2</a></h2>

   <p>The Secret Service never call themselves anything so melodramatic. If
they speak at all, it is vaguely of "The Department"&mdash;not even "The
Intelligence Department," you will note. It is a remarkable department,
however, and not the least of the remarkable men who served&mdash;in a minor
capacity, it is true&mdash;was Schiller.</p>

  <p>He was an inventive young Swiss with a passion for foreign languages. He
knew all the bad men in London&mdash;bad from the violently political
standpoint&mdash;and was useful to the Chief Secretary (Intelligence), though
Bland and the big men... well, they didn't dislike him, but they sort of... I
don't know how to put it.</p>

  <p>Watch a high-spirited horse pass a scrap of white paper on the road. He
doesn't exactly shy, but he looks at the flapping thing very expectantly.</p>

  <p>He was never in the Big Game, though he tried his best to get there. But
the Big Game was played by men who "chew ciphers in the cradle," as Bland put
it.</p>

  <p>In some mysterious way Schiller got to know that Reggie Batten had been
shot dead whilst extracting the mobilization orders of the 14th Bavarian Corps
from a safe in Munich&mdash;this was in'll, and the sad occurrence was
described as an "aviation accident."</p>

  <p>The Munich military authorities took Reggie's body up in an aeroplane and
dropped it... and the Munich newspapers gave poor Reggie some beautiful
notices, and said that the funeral would be at two o 'clock, and they hoped
that all his loving friends would gather round. Such of his unsuspecting
acquaintances as did gather were arrested and searched, their lodgings and
baggage ransacked, and were in due course most incontinently sent across the
frontier.</p>

  <p>Bland, who was in Munich, did not attend the funeral; in fact, he left
the beer city without lingering unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>He was back in town only a day when Schiller asked for an interview.</p>

  <p>Bland, square-chinned, clean-shaven, and wholly impassive, heard
particulars of Schiller's application and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You are altogether wrong in your view of Mr. Batten," he said. "He was
unconnected with this department, and his death was due to a very deplorable
accident. Therefore I cannot give you his job."</p>

  <p>Schiller heard and bowed.</p>

  <p>"I have been misinformed, sir," he said politely.</p>

  <p>He went to work in another way and made a carefully planned attack upon
the Chief Secretary, who had-reached that delicate stage of a man's career
which is represented by the interregnum between the end of a period of
usefulness and the consciousness of the fact.</p>

  <p>Sir John Grandor had been in his time the greatest Intelligence man in
Europe, but now&mdash;he still talked of wireless telegraphy as "a wonderful
invention."</p>

  <p>Yet Sir John was chief, and a fairly shrewd chief. His seal of office was
Code No. 2, which no mortal eye had seen save his. It lay on the bottom shelf
of the safe between steel-bound covers, sheet after sheet of close writing in
his own neat hand.</p>

  <p>No. 2 Code is a very secret one. It is the code which the big agents
employ. It is not printed, nor are written copies circulated, but is learnt
under the tuition of the Chief himself. The men who know Code No. 2 do not
boast of their knowledge, because their lives hang upon a thread&mdash;even in
peace time.</p>

  <p>Schiller could never be a big agent. For one thing, he was a naturalized
foreign subject and the big men are nationals, trained to the Game from the day
they enter the Office. They are educated men, condemned for life to dissociate
themselves from the land of their birth, and who they are, or where they live,
is known only to three men, two of whom have no official existence.</p>

  <p>Sir John liked Schiller and did many things for him. He told him stories
of his past adventures and Schiller listened attentively. In the course of one
of these post-prandial discussions (he was a most presentable young man, and
Sir John frequently took him home to dinner), Schiller casually mentioned Code
No. 2. He spoke of it with easy familiarity, and Sir John discussed the Code in
general terms. He told his guest how it was kept in the special safe, how it
was made up on the loose-leaf system, and how it was a nuisance because it was
always in disorder because he had to consult it every day, and invariably
replaced the sheets he had been using on the top, irrespective of their
alphabetical right to that position.</p>

  <p>The young man had innocently suggested that he should come to Sir John's
office every night and sort them out, but the old man smiled benevolently and
had said he thought not.</p>

  <p>Bland summoned Grigsby to his office one day, and that florid young man
came to the tick of the clock.</p>

  <p>"This fellow Schiller is bothering me," said Bland in the low tones which
are almost second nature in the Service. "He is a smart fellow and very useful,
but I mistrust him."</p>

  <p>He has a blameless record," said the other, staring out of the window,
"and he knows little of the bigger things&mdash;Sir John is a ditherer, but
he's close enough. What is worrying you now?"</p>

  <p>Bland strode up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"He is inventing a new wireless receiver," he said, "and he has got the
old man interested. He works all day at it in his room, and at night he carries
it down to Sir John's office, where it is most religiously locked in the
safe.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is absurd to imagine that the box&mdash;it is about the
size of a biscuit-tin&mdash;can contain anything with human intelligence and
get out in an air- tight safe and walk around, or go squinting at the code;
but, somehow, I don't like it."</p>

  <p>Grigsby chuckled.</p>

  <p>"It's a new one on me," he confessed. "I'm not denying that Schiller
isn't clever; he invented a draught excluder for my room which is a model of
ingenuity, but I can hardly imagine a wireless receiver which reads and
transmits a code from the interior of a steel safe."</p>

  <p>But Bland was not convinced.</p>

  <p>He sent for May Prince. She was holiday-making in Devonshire, but came at
once to town: a straight slip of a girl&mdash;she looked eighteen, though in
truth she was ten years older&mdash;with the loveliest smile in the world, a
pair of appraising gray eyes, and a mouth which, in repose, was a little
inclined to droop.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to disturb you on your holiday," said Bland, "but I want Schiller
kept under observation. Next week you will be discharged from the Department
for neglect of duty. You will retire with a grievance, and you will tell
Schiller, whom you will continue to meet, that I am a beast and that I lose a
great deal of money backing racehorses. I will have a few bookmakers' accounts
prepared for you, which you will show discreetly."</p>

  <p>"Is he to blackmail you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Bland shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If he is all I think he is, he will not. No, he might give you
confidence for confidence&mdash;so long."</p>

  <p>And May, with a nod, went out.</p>

  <p>Schiller's invention took an unconscionable time to develop. Yet he was
enthusiastic over its possibilities and inspired the Chief with some of his
enthusiasm. He worked in his spare time at the machine, and regularly every
evening at live minutes to six he would carry his heavy box to the Chief's
office, solemnly deposit his burden on the iron grill which formed the one
shelf of the safe, and watch the locking up with a jealous eye.</p>

  <p>And May Prince had nothing to report. Three days before that fatal 1st of
August which brought so much destruction and misery to Europe, Bland, who had
been working day and night in the interest of his department, went up to
Schiller's room to question him regarding the bona fides of a certain Antonio
Malatesta, suspected of being an agent of the Central Powers. Bland very seldom
visited the offices of his subordinates, but on this occasion his 'phone was
out of order.</p>

  <p>He found the door locked and knocked impatiently. Presently it was opened
by the smiling Schiller. The table was covered with a litter of wire, electric
batteries, tools, and screws, but of the great wireless receiver there was no
sign.</p>

  <p>"You are looking for my wonder-box, sir?" said Schiller. "She is in my
safe&mdash;soon I will give you the most remarkable demonstration! Even today I
caught a signal from the Admiralty&mdash;through a closed window."</p>

  <p>Bland was not listening.</p>

  <p>He stood erect, his nose in the air, sniffing.</p>

  <p>There was a faint, sweetish smell&mdash;a scent of camphor and something
else. Schiller watched him through narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Bland, and, turning on his heel, left the room.</p>

  <p>A telegram lay on the table. It had been delivered in his brief
absence:</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>SCHILLER IS AGENT IN CENTRAL EUROPEAN PAY. HE IS
HEAD OF CRYPTOGRAM DEPARTMENT. HAVE PROOF.&mdash;MAY.</tt></p>

  <p>Bland pulled open the drawer of his desk, took out an automatic pistol,
and raced through the door, and took the stairs two at a time.</p>

  <p>Schiller's door was open, but he had gone.</p>

  <p>He had not passed out through the lobby or the front entrance of the
building, but a commissionaire on duty at the side door had seen him pass and
had heard him hail a cab.</p>

  <p>Bland went back to his office and put through a 'phone call to the
police:</p>

  <p>"Watch all railway stations and docks. Arrest and detain Augustus
Schiller."</p>

  <p>He described him briefly, but with a sure touch.</p>

  <p>"It is very lamentable," said Sir John, really troubled, "but I can , t
think he has taken away anything of importance. Has he removed his
invention?"</p>

  <p>"I have that all right, Sir John," said Bland grimly, "and tonight with
your permission I am going to see what happens."</p>

  <p>"But surely you don't think!"</p>

  <p>Bland nodded.</p>

  <p>"I haven't monkeyed with it at all, but I've listened very carefully
through a microphone and there is no doubt that it contains a clockwork
mechanism. It is almost silent, but I have detected the sound. I suggest that
we place the box where it is usually put, leave the safe door open, and
watch."</p>

  <p>Sir John frowned. All this seemed a reflection on his judgment and, as
such, was to be resented, but he was too loyal a man in the Service to which he
had given forty-five years of his life to allow his injured vanity to come
before his public duty.</p>

  <p>At six o 'clock the box was placed in the safe.</p>

  <p>"Is that where it was always put?" asked Bland.</p>

  <p>"I generally&mdash;in fact invariably&mdash;put it on the iron grid."</p>

  <p>"Just above Code 2, I see, sir."</p>

  <p>The Chief Secretary frowned again, but this time in an effort of
thought.</p>

  <p>"That is true," he said slowly; "once, I remember, when the box was
placed a little to one side Schiller pushed it to the center, which I thought
was a little impertinent of him."</p>

  <p>The two men drew up a couple of arm-chairs and seated themselves before
the safe.</p>

  <p>Their vigil promised to be a long one.</p>

  <p>Eight, nine, ten o'clock passed, and nothing happened.</p>

  <p>"I think it is rather ridiculous, don't you?" asked Sir John testily, as
the quarter to eleven chimed.</p>

  <p>"It seems so," said Bland doggedly, "but I want to see&mdash;good
God&mdash;look!"</p>

  <p>Sir John gasped.</p>

  <p>Immediately beneath the box was Code 2, enclosed in a leather binder, the
edges of which were bound, for durability sake, with a thin ribbon of steel.</p>

  <p>Now, slowly the cover of the book was rising. It jerked up a little then
fell, leapt again and fell back, as though there were something inside which
was struggling to get free. Then of a sudden the cover opened and remained
stiffly erect, forming, with the contents, the letter L, the upright of which
was the cover.</p>

  <p>There was a "click," and the interior of the safe was illuminated with a
soft greenish radiance. It threw a glow upon the top page of the code which
lasted for nearly a minute. Then it died away and the cover of the book
fell.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" whistled Bland.</p>

  <p>He lifted the black box carefully from the safe and carried it to Sir
John's desk, examined the bottom of the box with a long and patient scrutiny,
then set it down.</p>

  <p>"Code No. 2 is in the hands of the enemy, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>It was daylight when he finished his investigations. Half the box was
taken up by accumulators. They supplied the current which, operating through a
powerful magnet, lifted the cover of the Code-book. They gave the light to the
wonderful little mercurial-vapor lamps, which afforded the concealed camera
just enough light to make an effective exposure.</p>

  <p>"The little clockwork arrangement is, of course, simple," said Bland,
"that sets the time for the machine to work and switches the current on and
off. It probably opens and closes the shutters which hide the lens and the lamp
and the magnet. I suspected the camera when I smelt the film in his room."</p>

  <p>Sir John, white and haggard, nodded.</p>

  <p>"Get me out of this as well as you can, Bland," he said gruffly. "I'll
retire at the end of the year. I'm a damned old man."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door and paused with his fingers on the handle.</p>

  <p>"There are thirty men's lives in Schiller's keeping," he said; "their
names and addresses are in that book. I suppose he got through the book. I am
so careless that I changed the order of the pages almost every day, and the
devil has been at work for nine months. He ought to have worked through the
book by now, for there was a different sheet on top every time."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best, sir," said Bland.</p>

  <p>Schiller was away&mdash;and safely away&mdash;before war was declared. He
was seen in Holland and was traced to Cologne. There was no possibility of
changing the code, and messages were already coming through from agents.</p>

  <p>Bland took a bold step. Through a man in Denmark he got into
communication with Schiller and offered to make a deal. But Schiller was not
selling. In the telegraphed words of the emissary whom Bland had sent:</p>

  <p>"Schiller is receiving an enormous fee from enemy government for decoding
wireless messages that your agents are sending. He alone knows the code."</p>

  <p>Nothing daunted, Bland again got into communication with the traitor,
offering him an enormous sum if he would consent to return to a neutral country
and retain his secret.</p>

  <p>"Meet me in Holland, and I, will fix everything," his message ended. It
elicited a reply which was characteristic of the ingenious master-spy:</p>

  <p>"Come into Belgium and I will arrange."</p>

  <p>A mad suggestion, for Belgium was now enemy ground, but Bland took his
life in his hands, and a long glass dagger in his handbag, and left the same
night for the Continent.</p>

  <p>Bland went into Belgium by the back door and made a laborious way to
Brussels. It would not be in the national interest to explain the means and
methods he employed to make his entry into that carefully guarded land, but it
is sufficient to say that he met Schiller, looking very prosperous, in the
estaminet of the Gold Lion at Hazbruille, a small village on the Ghent-Lille
Road.</p>

  <p>"You are a very brave man, Mr. Bland," complimented Schiller, "and I wish
I could oblige you in what you wish. Unfortunately, I cannot."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you bring me here?" asked Bland.</p>

  <p>The other looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"I have a certain code," he said quietly. "I have it complete with
certain exceptions: there are three pages missing. What do you want for
them?"</p>

  <p>Here was a staggerer for a smaller man than Bland.</p>

  <p>"That is a fair offer," he said, calmness itself, "but what is the
particular code you are buying?"</p>

  <p>"No. 2," said the other, "I thought "</p>

  <p>Bland interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"No. 2 Code?" he said, sipping his bock (he was for the time being a
Belgian peasant). "Of course, that's rubbish. Neither you nor I know No. 2
Code; the code you stole was No.3."</p>

  <p>Schiller smiled superiorly.</p>

  <p>"When you get back to London," he said, "ask your Chief whether 'Agate'
does not mean 'Transports loading at Borkum.'"</p>

  <p>"You might have got hold of that particular word by accident," said Bland
grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"Ask him if 'Optique' does not mean 'Emperor has gone to Dresden,'"
persisted the calm Schiller.</p>

  <p>Bland looked round the room thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You know a great deal, my friend," he said.</p>

  <p>The woman who managed the estaminet came in a little later and found
Bland pulling slowly at a rank cigar, his elbows on the table, a half-emptied
bock before him.</p>

  <p>The woman glanced with a little smile at Schiller.</p>

  <p>"He's tired," said Bland, emptying the bock. "Let him sleep on. And don't
let the flies disturb him," he added humorously.</p>

  <p>Schiller lay sideways on the bench at which Bland was sitting, his face
to the wall, and over his head was a coarse blue handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"He will not be disturbed," said Madame, and pocketed the five-sou tip
that Bland gave her with a grateful smirk.</p>

  <p>"When he wakes," said Bland at the door, "tell him I have gone on to
Ghent."</p>

  <p>Three hours later a German <i>Landsturm</i> soldier who had come for his
evening coffee, whisked away the handkerchief which covered the sleeper's face,
and stammered:</p>

  <p>"<i>Gott</i>!"</p>

  <p>For Schiller was dead, and had been dead for three hours. It took even
the doctor quite a long time to discover the blade of the glass dagger in his
heart.</p>

  <p>A week after this Bland was dressing for dinner in his West End flat, and
had reached the patience stage of bow-tying, when his valet informed him that
Grigsby had called.</p>

  <p>"I told him you were dressing, sir," said Taylor, "but Mr. Grigsby is
that full of his horse winning the Gatwick steeplechase that he won't take 'No'
for an answer."</p>

  <p>Taylor was a privileged person, and was permitted to be critical even of
Bland's friends. Taylor was an ideal servant from his master's point of view,
being simple and garrulous. To a man in Bland's profession garrulity in a
servant was a virtue because it kept the employer always on his guard, never
allowed him the delusion of safety or the luxury of indiscretion. Moreover, one
knew what a garrulous servant was thinking and, through the medium of secret
agents, what he was saying.</p>

  <p>"Show him up here," said Bland after a while.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grigsby came noisily into the dressing-room, though his greeting of
Bland was a little cold.</p>

  <p>"I've a bone to pick with you," he said. "What the devil have you been
saying to Lady Greenholm about me? You know my feelings about Alice "</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment, please," said Bland sharply, and turned to his servant.
"Taylor, you can go to the General Post Office with the letter you will find on
the hall-stand."</p>

  <p>Mr. Grigsby waited until he heard the door of the flat close, then walked
into the passage and shot the bolt of the front door.</p>

  <p>He came back to where Bland was standing with his back to the fire, his
hands thrust into his trouser pockets.</p>

  <p>"You're sure he had No. 2?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Bland nodded.</p>

  <p>Grigsby bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It isn't worth while worrying about how he got it&mdash;now," he said.
"The question is, who will get it next!"</p>

  <p>Bland opened a cigar case, bit off the end of a cigar, and lit up before
he replied.</p>

  <p>"What news have you at this end!" he asked. "I was across the border
before they discovered his death; naturally, I have heard nothing save what our
Amsterdam man told me."</p>

  <p>"The code is in London," said Grigsby briefly. "As soon as he was dead a
cablegram was sent to Valparaiso by the authorities in Brussels. It was
addressed to a man named Van Hooch&mdash;probably a third party. Here it is
"</p>

  <p>He took out a pocket-book and laid a slip of paper on the table. The
message was short and was in Spanish:</p>

  <p>"Schiller's London lodging."</p>

  <p>"It's rather puzzling," said Bland. "Schiller wouldn't have written the
code out&mdash;he was too clever for that. And yet he must have given the
authorities a guarantee that the secret should not be lost with his death. It
has probably been arranged that he should tell some person agreed upon&mdash;in
this case a man in South America&mdash;in what manner the code was hidden. The
exact locale he left until his death, probably sealed up amongst his private
papers."</p>

  <p>"That is a sound theory," said Grigsby. "He told you nothing more?"</p>

  <p>Bland shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I had to kill him of course," he said with a note of regret. "It was
pretty beastly, but the lives of thirty good men were in his holding. He
probably knew where they were stationed."</p>

  <p>"And the man that comes after will also know," said the other grimly. "We
start tonight to make a very scientific search of his lodgings."</p>

  <p>But the flat in Soho Square yielded no profit.</p>

  <p>For the greater part of a fortnight three of the smartest Intelligence
men (including Lecomte from the French department) probed and searched,
slitting furniture, pulling up floors, and dismantling cupboards.</p>

  <p>And the result was a negative one.</p>

  <p>"I'll swear it is there," said Bland dejectedly. "We've overlooked
something. Where is May Prince?"</p>

  <p>"She's at the Chief Censor's. She has an office there," explained
Grigsby.</p>

  <p>May came in some triumph.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd send for me," she said. "I could have saved you such a
lot of trouble!"</p>

  <p>Bland was all apologies.</p>

  <p>"I've neglected you terribly, May," he said. "Do you know, I have never
seen you since you sent me the wire about Schiller?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know that&mdash;Schiller is dead, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One reads things in the Censor's office&mdash;innocent letters from
Holland, with messages written between the lines in formic acid and milk which
becomes quite visible if you use the correct formulas. Mr. Schiller was a
remarkable man; and his father was one of the greatest scholars Switzerland has
produced, though he was blind. What do you want of me now?"</p>

  <p>Bland explained briefly. The girl knew of Code No. 2 and the secrecy
which surrounded it, and realized the urgency of the situation.</p>

  <p>"By the way, how did you know that he was an enemy agent?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I discovered his code," she replied cryptically.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the two men she went to the flat in Soho Square. The
flooring had been replaced and the rooms were habitable again. She made a tour
through the flat, then she returned to the big dining-room.</p>

  <p>"This is the room where the code is," she said decisively.</p>

  <p>It was a cheerful apartment, papered in a rich brown. A broad dado of a
simple design belted the walls, and the wainscoting had been painted a
chocolate color to harmonize with the paper. From the ceiling hung an electric
fitting, and at this May glanced.</p>

  <p>"We've had that down," said Bland, "and the wainscot has been taken out,
but we've found nothing."</p>

  <p>"Will you leave me alone here for a few minutes?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>The two men withdrew, but they were hardly out of the room before she
followed, her eyes blazing with the joy of discovery.</p>

  <p>"Got it!" she laughed. "Oh, I knew&mdash;I knew!"</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" demanded the astonished Bland.</p>

  <p>"Wait," she said eagerly. "When do you expect your South American
visitor?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow&mdash;of course, the room will be guarded and he will have no
chance of searching."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were still dancing when she nodded.</p>

  <p>"We shall see&mdash;tomorrow. I fancy you will have a very frank visitor
from Valparaiso, and when he comes I want you to send for me."</p>

  <p>"What on earth "</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait, please! What will he say?" She closed her eyes and frowned.
"I can tell you his name; it is Raymond Viztelli."</p>

  <p>"You knew this all along?" asked the astonished Grigsby, but she shook
her head.</p>

  <p>"I knew it when I went into the room," she said, "but now I am guessing.
I think he will offer to help you discover the code, and he will tell you there
is a secret panel in the wall, and that it will take days and days to make the
discovery. And I think he will ask you to be present when he makes his
search."</p>

  <p>"He needn't ask that," said Bland unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I think you're very mysterious, May, but I've a kind of feeling that
you're right."</p>

  <p>She had a few questions to ask the janitor of the building before she
left.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Schiller did all his own decorations&mdash;in the dining-room,
didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss," said the man. "A regular feller he was for potterin' about
with a paste-pot or a paint-brush."</p>

  <p>"And he has paid his rent in advance?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, miss."</p>

  <p>"And he said that nothing was to be done to the flat till he came
back?"</p>

  <p>"His very words!" said the caretaker.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," said May.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock next morning a card was brought to Bland. It was
inscribed: "Se&ntilde;or X. Bertramo Silva," and written in a corner, "of
Valparaiso."</p>

  <p>Bland pressed a bell, and in a little time Grigsby and the girl came
in.</p>

  <p>"He's come," said Bland shortly, and handed her the card.</p>

  <p>The visitor was shown in. He was a dapper little man with a pointed
beard, and spoke excellent English. Moreover, after the preliminaries he
plunged straight into the heart of his subject.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be very frank with you, Mr. Bland," he began; and Bland
shooting a swift glance at the girl, saw the laughter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I was for some time an agent of the Central Powers&mdash;I tell you this
because I wish you to clearly understand my position," he went on. "Safe in
South America, I thought no call would be made upon my services. A few weeks
ago, however, I received a cablegram which was intercepted by the British
authorities.</p>

  <p>"I had known, of course, that in certain eventualities I might be obliged
to come to England to make a search for certain documents, and that I should
learn the place where they were hidden by telegram. That telegram came&mdash;I
am here!"</p>

  <p>He flung his arms dramatically.</p>

  <p>"I came straight to you on my arrival. I tell you frankly why I came,
because I decided, the night before I reached Plymouth, that the game was not
worth the candle. I will assist you as far as possible to discover the
documents, and then I will, if you will allow me, return to South America."</p>

  <p>It was all very amazing to Bland. The man had said almost all that May
had predicted he would say. He looked at the girl again, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"You understand that your search " began Bland.</p>

  <p>"Will be under the eyes of the police?" interrupted the man from
Valparaiso. "I would prefer it."</p>

  <p>"You would like to start your search at once, I suppose?" asked Bland.</p>

  <p>"The sooner the better," said the other heartily.</p>

  <p>"One moment."</p>

  <p>It was the girl who spoke.</p>

  <p>"You have a very good memory, se&ntilde;or?" she asked.</p>

  <p>For just a fraction of a second the smile died from the man's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have an excellent memory, madame," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>They went together in a cab and were admitted to Schiller's flat by the
police officer on guard.</p>

  <p>"Have you any theory?" asked Bland as they stood in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the other quickly. "I think the documents are hidden in a
recess in the wall behind a secret panel. It may take a week to find the panel.
This is a very old house, and it is possible Mr. Schiller chose it for some
structural advantage it may have had."</p>

  <p>Again Bland thought rapidly&mdash;the frankness of the man, his
willingness to help&mdash;the talk of secret panels was all in accordance with
the girl's amazing prophecy.</p>

  <p>He saw the glee in her eyes&mdash;glee at the mystificaton of her
Chief.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the little man.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," he said.</p>

  <p>Se&ntilde;or Silva bowed.</p>

  <p>"I will take this wall first," he said, "and I will search for the
evidence of a panel. My fingers are perhaps more sensitive than yours "</p>

  <p>His hand was outstretched toward the dado, when&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>At the sound of the girl's sharp warning Se&ntilde;or Silva turned.</p>

  <p>"Before you go any farther," she said, "let me ask you if you value your
life?"</p>

  <p>The Chilian shrugged and spread his hands.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, madame."</p>

  <p>The girl turned to Bland.</p>

  <p>"If this man learns Code 2, what will happen to him?"</p>

  <p>Bland looked from May to the face of the stranger.</p>

  <p>"He will certainly die," he said simply.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You may go on if you wish, but you are starting a little too far to the
right."</p>

  <p>His face went a ghastly gray.</p>

  <p>"To the right!" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"The message to you begins at the door, Se&ntilde;or Viztelli," she said
calmly.
"The code does not begin until you reach the window. "Will you continue?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, having no words.</p>

  <p>Bland called in his men and they hustled the little South American into a
cab.</p>

  <p>"And now explain," said Bland.</p>

  <p>The girl walked to the wall near the door and touched the dado.</p>

  <p>"Feel," she said.</p>

  <p>Bland's fingers touched the wall-paper gingerly. He felt a few pin-point
eruptions, passed his hand to the right, and felt more. Then the truth dawned
on him.</p>

  <p>"Braille!" he whispered. The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"Schiller's father was a blind man," she said, "and Schiller evidently
took up the study of the alphabet by which blind men read. Silva was informed
how the code had been written and learnt it against the time when it would be
necessary to take over Schiller's work."</p>

  <p>She ran her fingers along the dado.</p>

  <p>"There are seven lines of writing, and they run round the room," she
said. "Schiller pasted this dado on himself&mdash;a bit at a time&mdash;as fast
as he was able to photograph Code 2. This is how the top line begins.</p>

  <p>"To Raymond Viztelli," she read. "Keep up pretense helping police; be
frank, as I have told you. Tell them there is a secret panel, and you will be
able to come often. Code begins: 'Abraham' means 'New guns have been
fitted.'"</p>

  <p>Bland caught her hand and gently drew it away.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be a nice live girl and dine with me tonight," he said
half humorously, "do not pursue your investigations any farther."</p>

  <p>That afternoon Bland did a little amateur paper-stripping and made a good
job of it.</p>
  <hr>

 <h2><a name="story06"
    id="story06">6. THE MEDIAEVAL MIND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There can be no question that the D'Ortons were mediaeval
minded.
Charles, the eldest of the brothers (he was once a doctor), had been twice
submitted to the indignity of a police prosecution&mdash;once for beating a
youthful robber of his orchards; once for an assault upon a serf of his who had
expressed political views which were violently opposed to those held by his
master. The Reverend Hubert, that hard-faced curate of souls, was in conflict
with his evangelical bishop most of the time, and had created what were locally
known as "scandals" by his treatment of parishioners; and Leslie D'Orton,
youngest of the trio, had carried his mediaevalism to such lengths that his
effigy had been burnt by the enraged villagers of Badleigh-in-the-Moor.</p>

  <p>They were men who sincerely hated the spirit of the time, though they
were not averse from its conveniences. Electric light and motor cars, and
expensive flats in Park Lane&mdash;all the advantages which are to be had by
pushing buttons and turning switches were tolerable despite their modernity.
They loathed the vulgar rich and despised the still more vulgar poor. Charles,
white-haired and red-faced, had only French servants at his little palace near
Saffron Walden; the Reverend Hubert was the only parson in England who never
went about without his walking footman.</p>

  <p>It was the D'Ortons' misfortune that Jean Alys D'Orton was entirely
devoid of the mediaeval spirit. She was, it is true, only a half-sister, the
relic of an unfortunate and indiscreet marriage contracted by their father, in
his middle age, with one Mary Jean Potter, a very pretty lady, entirely without
historical associations. She brought to the family no coat-armor, no lions
couchant or leopards rampant; no more of heraldry indeed than was to be found
inscribed on the six hundred thousand golden sovereigns which were hers (had
she exchanged paper for metal) and which now should have been her daughter's.
Miss Potter was literally the daughter of potters, rich Midland
potters&mdash;but potters.</p>

  <p>"I am common clay, Charles," said Jean, when he had remonstrated with her
over some low escapade of her teens. "I have nothing that is Plantagenet in my
system. When I wish to meet artists and dance with actors, my conscience
doesn't prick me a little bit."</p>

  <p>She was a slim, tall, pretty girl with yellowish ("clay-colored," said
the Rev. Hubert) hair, and she had eyes like her mother's&mdash;big and dark
and devastating.</p>

  <p>That they had entirely devastated one susceptible man was the main reason
why the three brothers sat at breakfast in Leslie D'Orton's flat one dull
November morning. It was something more than a meal: it was a board meeting of
the Mediaevalism Corporation. Something more serious than that even. There was
a morning newspaper on the table, folded to display an alarming and a very
inopportune column that had thrust itself into notice.</p>

  <p>In a sense the news it contained struck at all the ancient privilege of
class&mdash;those fine rights of acquisition and maintenance which established
the castles of the Rhine and the strongholds of the Komitadjis.</p>

  <p>"Very depressing," said Charles, and stroked his trim white moustache
thoughtfully. " Deuced unpleasant."</p>

  <p>"But these were trustees of a public company," insisted the Rev. Hubert.
"I don't think it comes quite into the same category, Leslie? Are we not taking
rather a fantastic view of&mdash;er&mdash;possibilities?"</p>

  <p>The thin-faced young man with the deep-set eyes shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I'm a lawyer, or I'm supposed to be one. What is the use
of deceiving ourselves?"</p>

  <p>The Rev. Hubert picked up the paper again. The column which interested
him was headed: "Seven Years for Faithless Trustees." He abominated the word
"faithless."</p>

  <p>"The responsibility for all this," he said soberly, "lies with that
wretched Potter woman. It was a crime to leave the money in... as it were...
after all, we have done our best."</p>

  <p>"Let me put the matter plainly and a little brutally," said Leslie, as he
pushed back from the table. "We three are the trustees of some &pound;630,000.
We have administered the money in a way which no court of law would
countenance. If Jean marries the right kind of man&mdash;that is to say, if we
could pick and choose her husband&mdash;there could be nothing to worry about.
But Jean 1"</p>

  <p>They were silent at this, being one in their despair of Jean and her
erratic and vulgar predilections.</p>

  <p>"You don't think this Mortiboy affair is serious?" asked Hubert.</p>

  <p>"Mortimer," corrected Leslie. "Yes, I do. If he were the ordinary type of
smug missioner, I shouldn't worry. The kind of fellow who runs an uplift
mission in the East End is generally illiterate and usually common. But
according to Jean, Mortimer is a Cambridge man, by no means pious, and more
interested in teaching boys to box than saving their immortal souls."</p>

  <p>"Diabolical!" said Hubert, with a grimace. "I preached a sermon on that
very subject last Sunday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We don't want sermons now, Hubert," said Charles testily. "Here is the
point: we're in a devil of a mess if Jean decides to run away with this
wretched youth. What is he like?"</p>

  <p>They both looked at Leslie for information, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't met him. Jean wanted to bring him to dinner, but I put my foot
down. The only thing I. know about him is that he has beautiful eyes and a
noble character, and that his handicap at golf is some ridiculous figure."</p>

  <p>"Four," grunted Charles. "You told me that. I thought it was absurd. I
can't understand how any man can keep his handicap at four if he wastes his
time running sing-songs for the scum of Whitechapel. What is his
profession?"</p>

  <p>Leslie looked at him significantly.</p>

  <p>"He is a lawyer," he said; "in the solicitors' branch, and that makes it
worse."</p>

  <p>Another long silence.</p>

  <p>"How much of Jean's money is left?" asked Hubert.</p>

  <p>The red-faced Charles coughed. He was the financial genius of the
family.</p>

  <p>"More than a half," he said loudly; "and I am perfectly certain that the
Court would accept our explanation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Court would accept no explanation," said Leslie. "You can make up
your mind on that subject. A hundred thousand pounds spent on a treasure-
hunting expedition to Cocos Island is not what any Chancery judge would agree
as a gilt-edged adventure."</p>

  <p>"Tiggerly is honest enough," said Hubert. "A thoroughly reliable man. A
little coarse of speech&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a little mad," broke in Leslie. "He is coming up to see me tonight,
by the way. He says he knows now where he made his mistake.... If we can
finance another expedition..."</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of the D'Ortons that such a statement was not
received with derision. Bather was their attitude one of regret.</p>

  <p>"How far has this affair gone?" asked Charles.</p>

  <p>"The Mortimer affair?" Leslie bit his thin lower lip. "Very far, I should
imagine. He wrote to me asking for a private interview. That means business.
There is... how much left!"</p>

  <p>"Nearly three hundred thousand," said Charles D'Orton. "Nearly... quite
enough for any girl."</p>

  <p>"Three&mdash;nearly," repeated the younger brother mechanically. "Now if
we could arrange a marriage to anybody but this down-and-out adventurer..."</p>

  <p>At that particular moment Jean Alys D'Orton was arranging a marriage with
no other assistance than a rather good-looking young athlete could give to
her.</p>

  <p>She was walking slowly across Green Park, and the man who paced by her
side had none of the appearance which is usually associated with a down-and-out
adventurer.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he was saying, "how can I meet these formidable brothers of
yours?"</p>

  <p>She smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"There is going to be an awful row, Jack; they won't meet you! You don't
know the heroic efforts I've made to get an audience of their majesties."</p>

  <p>"Will you risk a cold in the head and sit down?" he asked. They were very
near to the entrance of the park. "What is the real trouble? They can't object
to me personally, because they don't know anything about me. They can't imagine
that I'm a fortune-hunter, because I've money of my own. And if they took the
trouble to inquire into the beginnings of my obscure family&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My dear, they frighten me sometimes; they're mediaeval." She turned
round suddenly and faced him. "You've heard about the old barons who put their
young sisters in a turret room and kept them there for years to keep their
dowries? They're like that, Johnny. Don't laugh&mdash;I'm awfully serious.
Fortunately, they haven't the turret room, but they have the turret mind."</p>

  <p>"But what is it all about?" he asked, puzzled. "What is their objection?
They don't want to keep you single all their lives? And is your dowry a
tremendous amount?"</p>

  <p>She evaded this question.</p>

  <p>"Did you write to Leslie, as I asked?"</p>

  <p>He nodded and felt in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I had a letter back from his secretary requesting me to refrain in
future from addressing him. I nearly went round and kicked him."</p>

  <p>"I wish you had," she said gloomily.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a while, and then:</p>

  <p>"It is to do with the dowry. I don't know how exactly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are they your trustees?" he asked quickly. "Your brothers, I mean?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"When do you have control?"</p>

  <p>""When I am twenty-five or when I am married." she answered, and he
whistled.</p>

  <p>"I wonder!"</p>

  <p>Jack Mortimer knew a great deal more about the aristocratic D'Ortons than
they imagined.</p>

  <p>"Queer devils!" he said at last. "Are they by any chance your guardians
in law? Can they prevent your marriage?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then what the dickens have we to worry about?" asked Jack Mortimer
joyously.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later she was passing to her room, when Leslie called her
into his study. She shared the flat with her half-brother, but it was about the
fourth time in the long years of their association that she had ever been
invited into that handsome apartment.</p>

  <p>"Charles has gone back to Devonshire," he said, without preliminary, "and
he's awfully anxious about you, Jean&mdash;about your health, I mean. He wanted
to know whether you would like to come down and spend a few weeks in the
country."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, and then: "Anyway, I couldn't possibly go." It needed a
little courage to say. but she got the words out at last. "Leslie, I'm going to
be married."</p>

  <p>The hand that went up to his upper lip shook a little.</p>

  <p>"Really? This is news. You realize you cannot get married without the
consent of your guardians!"</p>

  <p>"I have no guardians," she replied, so brusquely that his heart sank.
Evidently she had been taking advice. At any rate he did not dispute this
point.</p>

  <p>"When is the interesting event to be?"</p>

  <p>The actual date had never been discussed. She made up her mind quickly.</p>

  <p>"In a fortnight," she said. "Just before Christmas. Mr. Mortimer and I
are going away to Switzerland."</p>

  <p>He scratched his chin, his dark eyes never leaving her face.</p>

  <p>"This is very... unexpected," he said. "I am not so sure that Charles
will approve."</p>

  <p>Charles was the senior of the brothers, and theoretically the head of the
house.</p>

  <p>"And, Leslie"&mdash;she was nervous now, on delicate ground, and spoke
hurriedly&mdash;"Jack&mdash;Mr. Mortimer said that when we returned from our
honeymoon would be time for him to discuss... business with you... I mean, the
question of my money. I told him I came into control on my marriage."</p>

  <p>"That interested him, I am sure," said Leslie dryly; it was a tactical
error on his part.</p>

  <p>"Jack Mortimer has all the money that we shall ever require," she said
coldly. "He has an income of his own. If you do not wish him to discuss the
matters, his lawyers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why he shouldn't discuss it," said Leslie abruptly,
and then, with a nod, dismissed her. It was not an unusual method of
parting.</p>

  <p>Leslie got his elder brother on the phone just before he left his hotel
for the country. Hubert was still in London. That afternoon there was a
consultation/ at the end of which Leslie went to Lincoln's Inn Fields and
consulted a school- friend who was also a lawyer. The solicitor's face
lengthened as he heard the frank recital.</p>

  <p>"You're not serious?" he asked, when the young man had finished.
"Because, if you are, you're in about as bad a position as you can possibly
be."</p>

  <p>"We've employed the money to the best of our ability " began Leslie, but
the lawyer stopped him.</p>

  <p>"By your admission you've used enormous sums for your own personal
benefit. You have in fact been living on your sister's capital for the past six
years. If this went into Court, nothing could save you from penal
servitude."</p>

  <p>Leslie D'Orton's face went white.</p>

  <p>"You mean that seriously?" The lawyer nodded.</p>

  <p>"And of course this would affect also your two brothers. You've put
yourselves in rather a tight place, my friend, and the only thing I can suggest
is that you persuade your sister to postpone her marriage. In other words,
postpone your exposure."</p>

  <p>Poor comfort was this to carry to his brethren. The three men met in
Charles's sitting-room at Paddington, and three mediaeval minds found one
solution simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Jean mustn't marry," said the Rev. Hubert; "or if she marries, it must
be a man of our finding."</p>

  <p>They consulted through the hours that followed, and in the end, when
Leslie D'Orton, stiff with sitting, rose and stretched himself, he had one
comment to make which was both illuminating and truthful.</p>

  <p>"Whichever way the thing goes, it means penal servitude for all of us."</p>

  <p>The Rev. Hubert, least perturbed of the trio, offered the sententious
observation that one might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb. Leslie
got back to his flat to find a burly, middle-aged sea-captain waiting for him,
and Captain Tiggerly was prepared to talk to the extent of his vocabulary on
enormous treasures buried under landslides on Cocos Island.</p>

  <p>Even by the lax standard of the sea, he was not a nice man. His earlier
adventure in search of treasure had been hampered by a mutiny, which he had
quelled single-handed; he narrowly escaped a charge of manslaughter in
consequence. But he was an enthusiast.</p>

  <p>"Here's the old sloop, ready for another go, my lord." (Invariably he
addressed his benefactor by this title.) "I could take in all the stores I
wanted in a week... she wants two new yards..."</p>

  <p>"Can you find a crew?" asked Leslie.</p>

  <p>The seaman grinned.</p>

  <p>"Pick 'em up two a penny," he said. "I got a sort of crew now&mdash;I've
been carrying cement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where are you lying?"</p>

  <p>"In the Pool,7 said the captain quickly. "You can come over and see her
if you like."</p>

  <p>Leslie went into the hall and called the maid.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," she replied. "Miss D'Orton went out to dinner. A gentleman
called for her. He asked for you."</p>

  <p>Leslie nodded, closed the door carefully behind him, and fastened the
baize door, which further precluded all eavesdropping. Then he sat down at the
table opposite the skipper.</p>

  <p>"There's a man," he began, "named Mortimer. He runs a boys' club at
Wapping..."</p>

  <p>Nearly a month later there were peculiar happenings on the edge of
Dartmoor. On the morning of the 23rd of December the inhabitants of the
villages, within gunshot of Prince-town, heard the boom of a cannon. That deep
and awesome sound meant only one thing. Farmers called in their hired men to
give instructions about the locking up of barns, the fastening of windows.
Later, big cars loaded with policemen and warders came slowly through the mist
that lay on the moor, stopped long enough to tell of the escape of a convict
serving a life sentence for murder, and passed on. The mist turned to rain, and
a gale blew up from the Channel.</p>

  <p>The night that followed was a desperate one for a man who, traveling only
by night, was making his way to Exeter. He came in time to a high ridge of
ground, felt for a flat-topped boulder, found one passably comfortable, and sat
down to recover his breath. He was in excellent condition, but he had not eaten
that day, and he had walked sixteen miles since sundown over a country which
was largely foreign to him. And now it was very dark, and the road he had
chosen was no more than a hillside track. He was wet through, naturally; it had
not ceased raining since he made his escape. Almost he had forgotten what it
felt like to be dry: "amphibian "&mdash;that was the word; he had been trying
to think of it all day.</p>

  <p>The rain soaked down and he was content. His left heel was blistered, he
had torn both hands with brambles, and the little scratches were painful in a
sharp, nagging kind of way. There had been compensations both for solitude and
hardship: the fragrance of pine smoke trailing in the wind from a cottage
chimney; the sound of a child's laughter that came through an open window just
before a nurse or mother had closed it; the fairylike lights of a tiny village
lying in the fold of the moor and seen from a high crag that jutted up from the
hillside like a gaunt monolith.</p>

  <p>He wished he had a cigar&mdash;one of those long, thin brown things that
he loved to smoke. Or a pipe or a cigarette even. But wishes put weight on a
man's feet and a new burden to his heart. He got up stiffly and went over the
crest, descending gingerly and with great caution the steep slope on the other
side.</p>

  <p>He had an uncanny feeling that danger was very near at hand; that he was
being spied upon, though the night was like ink. Once he imagined he had heard
the ring of an iron-shod foot....</p>

  <p>The hill sloped steeply on his right, and he walked on the side of his
feet most of the time. He could see nothing, hear nothing but the "tipple-
tipple" of rain on rock. Far away to the north the low, scudding clouds were
dyed salmon pink. A big town there, he thought&mdash;Exeter. Or maybe... no, it
must be Exeter. And was it north or east? The wind helped him to determine.
These storms blew in from the Atlantic&mdash;south-west. The glow in the sky
was on his left front as he stood with his back to the weather. North.</p>

  <p>He went farther down the track, and of a sudden it became smooth to his
feet. A made road. He felt leftwards cautiously. A wire fence with cylindrical
posts and concrete. And there was a shallow ditch. A farm or a house
perhaps&mdash;then unexpectedly lights came into view. He must have rounded a
shoulder of rock. A big house. He could see the glow of many windows.</p>

  <p>The man called Tom Burt halted to take counsel with himself, and decided
to push on. He had gone a dozen paces....</p>

  <p>"Hands up!"</p>

  <p>The voice was harsh, inhuman. It was more like the bark of an infuriated
crocodile.</p>

  <p>"Don't you move or I'll put a dose of shot into your stummick.... Joe!"</p>

  <p>He must have roared the word over his shoulder, for his voice sounded
fainter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burt was startled alike by the command and by the astonishing fact
that he could be seen by his invisible enemy.</p>

  <p>"Joe... dam' ye!"</p>

  <p>A shuffle of footsteps and a squeaky voice came from the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Gotcher gun... see him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Shoot him if he don't do as I tell him. Walk, mister&mdash;straight
ahead."</p>

  <p>Burt obeyed.</p>

  <p>Now he understood. His challenger was waist-high in a ditch, and the
wayfarer had been visible against the gloomy skyline.</p>

  <p>"Go on&mdash;right up to the house. I'm follerin' you. Don't let him out
of your sight, Joe."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the unseen youth.</p>

  <p>Tom Burt was amused in a ghastly way (that was his own description), but
he was puzzled too. The house was large, and, as he had seen, three of the
rooms were brightly illuminated. There was a white-pillared portico before the
door, and under this were two powerful lamps that threw an oblong of light on
the yellow-graveled ground.</p>

  <p>The door was open and he had sight of a broad, paneled hall; a red fire
burnt on an open hearth. The masks of a dozen foxes stared stonily from the
walls. He saw a rack of hunting-crops, and behind the glass window of a
cabinet, a dozen guns.</p>

  <p>"Stop where you are now and turn round. Joe, shut that door!"</p>

  <p>Burt swung round.</p>

  <p>He had guessed his captor was old; there was no surprise here. He was
picturesque with his white beard and bald head shining with moisture. Dark,
menacing eyes glared from under the bushy white eyebrows; how he might be
dressed was a matter for conjecture&mdash;he wore a dark weatherproof that
reached to his heels. The long-barrelled army revolver in his hand did not
waver as did the shot-gun in the hands of the boy. The youth's teeth were
chattering, the eyes in the pale face were scared and fearful. He started the
door closing with his foot, and backed up to it until with a bend of his spare
body he closed it with a crash.</p>

  <p>"Just you wait here: this boy'11 kill you sure as God if you move!"</p>

  <p>The old man slouched past him. Burt heard the sound of a door open and
close. There was a long mirror in the hall and he was standing opposite, he
found, when he turned his head.</p>

  <p>A ludicrous sight! His sodden overcoat clung to his legs, the brim of his
sou'- wester dropped dismally over his ears. He was terribly unshaven, and when
he smiled he was hideous.</p>

  <p>"A merry Christmas!" he said, and bowed to himself.</p>

  <p>The youth breathed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Don't you go movin' about, mister!" he warned.</p>

  <p>Burt grinned at himself again for the joy of experiencing his own
ugliness.</p>

  <p>"Be of good heart, my child," he said, and the snub nose of the youth
wrinkled in embarrassment.</p>

  <p>A door opened behind the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Burt turned and walked through the open door. He was in a large hall
with a high raftered ceiling. Before the stone fireplace two men were standing.
One, the younger, was in evening dress; the elder wore a faded golf suit. He
was very stout, red-faced, and white-haired, and his eyes protruded like a pug
dog's. His companion, a thin-faced man with a black smear of moustache, stood
with his back to the fire, his hands behind him.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," he said, with ironical politeness. "I hope you have
enjoyed your walk?"</p>

  <p>"The air was good," replied Burt," the scenery, I have no doubt, was
excellent, but the feeding was exceedingly poor."</p>

  <p>The elder of the two turned to the old man.</p>

  <p>"Get him some food," he said gruffly.</p>

  <p>A little clock ticked musically in some part of the room, and this, and
the falling of a log in the fireplace, were the only sounds that disturbed the
interval of silence between the old man's departure and his return with a
tray.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;leave it, Gald," nodded the younger man, and when the
door had closed on the ancient: "Eat, my friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And drink," suggested Mr. Burt as he sat down at the table, "and, in
view of the festive season, be merry? Tell me that tomorrow I die and I shall
call you a liar."</p>

  <p>"Damn cheek," growled the red-faced man, but his companion silenced him
with a look.</p>

  <p>The wanderer was very hungry, but he was also very sane. He did not eat
ravenously, but slowly, and was still hungry when he pushed back his plate and
drained the long glass of beer.</p>

  <p>"A full man is a dull man," he said. "Would you of your charity supply me
with a cigarette?"</p>

  <p>The younger of the two offered a gold case and his unwilling guest took
and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "produce your denouement!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked the younger man.</p>

  <p>"Haroun al Raschid," smiled Burt. "A prince in disguise wandering about
the earth to learn at first hand of the lives and trials of his people."</p>

  <p>"You're the man who escaped from Dartmoor Prison last night"&mdash;the
young man spoke with great deliberation and care. "I haven't had time to
discover your name, but I don't think that matters for the moment. Are you
married?"</p>

  <p>There was an amused glint in Burt's eyes as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Would you be willing to marry a lady for five thousand pounds and an
aeroplane trip to safety?"</p>

  <p>"And a new and dry suit of clothes," suggested Burt; "and by clothes I
include such indelicacies as underwear."</p>

  <p>"Why argue with him?" exploded the red-faced gentleman. "Tell him he's
got to do it; tell him you'll hand him over to the police an' all that. Damn it
all, Leslie..."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Charles, please," said Leslie O'Orton. "Let me manage in my
own way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me." Mr. Burt was pardonably intrigued. "Marriages are much
easier arranged in heaven than performed on earth. There are certain time-
wasting preliminaries, banns, special licences, and so forth, are there not? I
hate to suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is arranged," said Leslie.</p>

  <p>He walked up and down the broad strip of carpet before the fireplace, his
hands behind him.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take you into my confidence... by the way, you are a
convicted murderer? A life prisoner?"</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary to call me names?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"It isn't, of course. You seem to have been a gentleman. That will make
things easier. I have&mdash;we have a sister. It is not necessary to tell you
the kind of foolish trouble she has got into. It is necessary that she should
be married. You were our choice from the moment we heard of your escape."</p>

  <p>"I am flattered." Mr. Burt showed his teeth in a smile.</p>

  <p>""We have been looking for you all day: by the greatest of good luck we
heard through the police that you were heading this way. My old groom found you
without having the least idea as to our plans."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me: is your sister a willing agent in the matter!"</p>

  <p>Charles grunted something.</p>

  <p>"That is neither here nor there," said Leslie. "There is another man, of
course: he is at the moment on a sailing ship bound for the Pacific. You need
not consider him."</p>

  <p>He saw the eyes of the man open wider.</p>

  <p>"Good God! You shanghaied him!"</p>

  <p>Leslie smiled.</p>

  <p>"That is beside the point. Are you prepared to marry this lady?"</p>

  <p>"But I understand that by the laws of the country " began Mr. Burt.</p>

  <p>"A marriage is only legal when performed within certain hours. We have a
special license dispensing with that formality. Are you agreeable? If so, my
brother's car is waiting to take you to London. You need have no fear about
detection: we have taken the most elaborate precautions&mdash;we believe in
miracles and we anticipated the miracle of your arrival. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Burt nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is all one to me," he said. "The mystery of it appeals to me."</p>

  <p>Leslie went out of the hall and made his way upstairs. There was no
turret tower in Charles D'Orton's Devonshire house, but there was an attic
chamber which served the purpose. No weak maiden wrung her hands or wept in
this lumber room. The girl who sat glowering at the Reverend Hubert was neither
subdued nor tearful.</p>

  <p>"... it is only because I think you are all mad that I listen to you,"
she was saying when Leslie entered the room. "You can't imagine that I shall
overlook this..."</p>

  <p>She looked up at Leslie.</p>

  <p>"Have you found my ideal husband?" she demanded, her eyes hard with
anger.</p>

  <p>To her surprise he nodded.</p>

  <p>"You have to be sensible, Jean. This man Mortimer was not the man for
you. As I have told you, he was already married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why did you send a wire in his name saying he was here and wanted to see
me?" she asked furiously. "If any harm has come to Jack Mortimer I will never
rest until I have put you in prison. Mediaeval? You're prehistoric, Leslie...
mad. And as to this man you've got, you can send him away. Or I'll tell
him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He knows," said Leslie, and his gravity almost sent her into a fit of
hysterical laughter. "As soon as you are married he will leave you," said
Leslie, who did all the talking. "We are doing this for your own good, Jean, to
protect you against fortune-hunters. In a few years' time you can divorce this
man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll not marry him&mdash;can I see him!" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Please remember, Jean " began the Reverend Hubert in his most ponderous
tone.</p>

  <p>But she had followed her half-brother from the room. For three days she
had paced this little attic room, trying to wrest reality from a situation so
fantastic that she could not believe she was waking. She had her moments of
panic, too....</p>

  <p>She almost ran into the hall. Her husband-designate was sitting at the
end of the long table, a second glass of beer before him.</p>

  <p>"Is this the lady?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"This is the lady," said Leslie.</p>

  <p>"She is not favorably impressed by me," said Tom Burt, "and I can hardly
blame her."</p>

  <p>At the sight of the scarecrow the girl's face had gone the color of
chalk. The man rose and bowed.</p>

  <p>"In happier times, madame, I was better looking." He turned to Leslie.
"Do you anticipate any very strong objection on the part of the lady? I ask
because, as you probably know if you have studied my career of crime, I am
something of a hypnotist! For example...!"</p>

  <p>He snapped his fingers in the air, and the girl stared at him.</p>

  <p>"What the devil " began the unimaginative Charles.</p>

  <p>"This lady is now completely under control," said Mr. Burt calmly. "Ask
her to do anything you wish and she will do it."</p>

  <p>Leslie looked from one to the other in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Will you marry this man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said dully.</p>

  <p>Charles stared open-mouthed as the Reverend Hubert stumbled and blundered
through the ancient ritual. Certain provisions had not been made.... Jean Alys
D'Orton was married with Leslie's signet ring.</p>

  <p>He left her sitting limply in a chair, staring at her husband, and
hurried to the telephone in his study.</p>

  <p>"Is that the police station?... I am Mr. D'Orton. I have the man you want
at my house&mdash;the escaped convict&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At your house, Mr. D'Orton?" was the surprising reply. "He was caught at
Newton Abbot five hours ago!"</p>

  <p>Leslie's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"You mean Burt....?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, Collwood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Leslie flew back to the hall. The scarecrow was standing behind the
girl's chair.</p>

  <p>"What's your name!" he asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burt smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have several. When old man Tiggerly got me aboard his dirty little
ship he called me Tom Burt&mdash;when I jumped overboard off Teignmouth he
called me several things that are unprintable. I heard him, because the boat in
which he and his son followed me to shore was less than a dozen yards away when
I got to land. He chased me on to the moor: if I hadn't gone to sleep and lost
myself you would have been in prison hours ago. My real name, by the way is
Mortimer&mdash;if there is anything in the marriage, that is your sister's name
too!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Charles did not refer to that dreadful night until the train was running
along the Lake of Geneva a few days later. They were bound for Italy. Hubert
followed as soon as he had disposed of his living&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer
were very reasonable.</p>

  <p>"That hypnotism business... by Gad... to keep her quiet... we 'd have
smelt a rat if she 'd jumped at him. By Gad, that's a lovely old building!" He
pointed to the Chateau Chillon, which is undoubtedly mediaeval.</p>

 <h2><a name="story07"
    id="story07">7. THE KNOW-HOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What you need, Dian, is a little of my know-how in those
pretty legs of
yours."</p>

  <p>That was almost a daily saying of Alana Vane.</p>

  <p>Dian's legs were indubitably pretty&mdash;theatrical gossip writers used
to call them "shapely." Johnny Crewe objected, very naturally, to any reference
to them at all.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he was rather sensible, approved her stage career, had an
implicit and unshakeable faith in her ultimate success, and longed for its
coming.</p>

  <p>He could have married right away&mdash;he was a very well-off young man,
even in the days of Alana. But&mdash;Dian must have her chance. Marriage would
mean the breakdown of the "position" she had built with such labor, and the
shutting of the door which seemed at the point of yielding.</p>

  <p>Alana used to sigh at this talk of marriage. She was very beautiful in
her way. Dian Donald did not know her in the days before she began to look sad,
and the straight lines deepen on each side of her face: to Dian she was always
the most lovely woman in the world, and the public thought so too. The Elcho
Theatre was never without its queues. She had saved more bad plays and given
value to more valueless music than any woman on the stage. Her personality was
electric, her voice glorious. She was one of the few musical comedy actresses
that could act. Few spoke of her by her surname&mdash;she was "Alana," and so
her name appeared on poster and programme.</p>

  <p>She was Dian's height and Dian's build, and on the stage had something of
Dian's childlike loveliness.</p>

  <p>"Marriage! Humph!" She sighed, and shook her head. "It's fine and it's
heart- breaking. You're better off, Dian, as a single understudy than as a
married star. And you're a good understudy, darling. The world's best. If you
had the sense of a rabbit, you'd take the small parts Dowall offers you and get
away from me. A little know-how, and your name would be in lights, and you'd be
drawing down three hundred pounds a week instead of six."</p>

  <p>"Miss Forsyant is 'off' tonight," said Dian.</p>

  <p>Alana nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;she's dining with Freddie. He said he was going to his club
to meet a man, but he's dining with Elsa. I suppose it's all right. But it's
hard not to tell him I know."</p>

  <p>Freddie was big and florid, and notoriously gallant. He had been an
assistant stage director when Alana found him in a third-class show that she
had made into a first-class show. His salary had been about on a level with
Dian's. And then Alana fell in love, and they were married; and after that,
Freddie did no more work: only took people out to dinner&mdash;chorus girls at
first, and then principals, and then the lovely Elsa, who was blue-eyed and
calculating. All this happened before the big break, and it was like Alana that
she should play to the very last night of the show, should come smiling to the
footlights and make her little speech before the curtain fell, never to rise
upon her again.</p>

  <p>She divorced Freddie, and vanished from London. Dian, who wept very
little, wept much that night when she took farewell of her friend.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to New York: I may come back next year. I've asked Dowall to
give you some sort of a part. I'll give you absent treatment for know-how,
darling! And, Dian... Elsa's got a lot of money. I didn't know that until I
found Freddie was negotiating for the lease of the Elcho. You may find her
difficult, but stick it out&mdash;fame in a night for you, my dear; you know
the stories of the understudies!"</p>

  <p>That was Alana's last joke. The understudy who rises to fame in a night
was one of her favorite gibes at the story-tellers, for she knew that such
things do not happen.</p>

  <p>So passed Alana. So came Elsa Forsyant and a new type of performance.
There was a failure and another failure, and then a half-success. Freddie, the
florid, began to grow streaky lines round his china-blue eyes&mdash;Dowall, the
old director, grinned sardonically.</p>

  <p>"It's the type of show that's wrong," insisted Freddie. "Let's get back
the Alana kind."</p>

  <p>"Where's your Alana?" sneered Dowall.</p>

  <p>"Elsa could do it on her head."</p>

  <p>Freddie said this defiantly. Mr. Dowall made audible sounds of
derision.</p>

  <p>"It's on her feet she's got to do it," he said; "and those kinds of show
cost money."</p>

  <p>This significantly: he had a pretty shrewd idea that the financial
position of Freddie and his new wife was not very sound.</p>

  <p>"You get the show together. I'll find the money."</p>

  <p>He might speak with confidence, but he had certain inward doubts. The
theatre was a heavy responsibility. The first two shows had been financed by
himself; for the rest he secured backing, and he had exhausted that source of
revenue in his one effort. Still, suckers were born at the rate of one a
minute.</p>

  <p>So Great Heart was born, but the particular sucker that Freddie sought
did not attach itself to his clumsily baited hook, until one day he met a most
agreeable young man waiting at the stage door to escort a member of the company
to dinner....</p>

  <p>The rehearsals of Great Heart remained a bad memory to those who took
part in them. The "book" was bad, the music was in the main written by a
surprising young aristocrat. Do-wall said openly that Freddie had been paid a
considerable sum by the composer for the opportunity. The hard- working chorus
alone were efficient. Elsa insisted upon her lines being altered again and
again&mdash;she was not very strong on her "h's"&mdash;and shamelessly took to
herself not only the best lines but the best songs in the play. She would have
no other pretty girl in the play. She must be alone, incomparable. She changed
the leading man twice&mdash;once because he was so tall that he made her look
short, once because his voice was so good that it drowned her own rather feeble
notes.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she did not come to rehearsal for days....</p>

  <p>"I read the part," said Dian, snatching a hasty tea with Johnny in the
Palm Court of the Carlton. "Oh, Johnny! It is terrible at the theatre! Mr.
Dowall just sits in the stalls and glowers. And Freddie doesn't seem- to care
much. He was worried last week, but now he doesn't trouble to come to
rehearsals."</p>

  <p>John Crewe moved uneasily in his chair. He was a fresh-faced and youthful-
looking man of thirty.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really!" he said awkwardly. "He seemed very cheerful about it all
when I lunched with him on Monday."</p>

  <p>She looked at him incredulously. "You lunched with Freddie? You didn't
tell me! I didn't know that you had met him."</p>

  <p>"You listen to nothin'&mdash;you just stand about and chatter like a lot
of old crows... and we open tomorrow! No&mdash;tonight! All right&mdash;you can
all go home. Tonight I want everybody in the theatre at 5:30: chorus,
principals, everybody. We open, and God help us! If we postponed we'd be worse!
Alight!"</p>

  <p>He waved the company to the devil&mdash;they melted noisily.</p>

  <p>He called his familiar to him.</p>

  <p>"Not a costume that fits, half the shoes haven't arrived, the orchestra's
a crime, and the stage hands the biggest bunch of left-handed bimbos I've seen
since I left the fit-ups. Fit-ups! Gawd, they'd give points to this mob! Twenty-
five minutes changing one set! There'll be a riot in the theatre tonight!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowall was a gloomy man, with a deeply lined face. His scowl was
permanent.</p>

  <p>Two girls came towards him along the narrow space between the orchestra
and Row A. Elsa came boldly, with the air and manner of a proprietress, a
small, supple lady, expensively perfumed, her hands glittering.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Dowall, I can't open tonight. I've got no voice, and I'm simply
a bundle of nerves."</p>

  <p>Dian, the understudy, would gladly have missed the interview, but she had
been commanded to appear.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowall looked at the leading lady steadily. She was pretty: even her
worst enemy could not deny the loveliness of regular features and faultless
complexion. Her figure was sometimes described by ecstatic paragraphists as
divine&mdash;Mr. Dowall would concede that also.</p>

  <p>But he, of all men, knew the shrew behind those deep blue eyes, knew
something of the meanness of her soul, and of those red lips of
hers&mdash;anyway, she had got her Freddie, and that was the end of it; and
Alana Vane was somewhere in the Western States of America&mdash;picture-making,
people said vaguely; breaking her heart, her friends were certain. And there
was Freddie, in the back row of the stalls, curled up and faintly snoring. What
anybody could see in Freddie&mdash;Mr. Dowall shook a weary head.</p>

  <p>"You're a bundle of nerves and you're not all you might be, Elsa, and
you've got a doctor's certificate tucked away in your stocking, and the show
opens tonight."</p>

  <p>He stated the facts calmly.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose we shall do? Postpone for a month, and bring the
company down to Monte Carlo to give you a chance of rehearsing under favorable
conditions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't be sarcastic at my expense, Dowall." Her voice rose a
note.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you something?"</p>

  <p>The grim-faced producer put his thumbs in his armholes and looked up at
her.</p>

  <p>"If you were Alana I'd be foaming at the mouth and rolling on the floor.
Alana matters. You don't matter two rows of pins. You've got a part in the play
and you'll just fill it: you'll dance well and sing reasonably; your fans will
say 'Isn't she wonderful!' and the people who don't like you will say they like
you better when you're doing something else. The play's a flop that you
couldn't save. She could. When your husband changed his wife, he lost the best
leading woman in the world."</p>

  <p>She was livid with fury.</p>

  <p>Dowall listened, and yet didn't listen. Dian crept away unnoticed.</p>

  <p>"You... you're fired! You don't know how to produce a show! It's your
incompetence..."</p>

  <p>"Say it with flowers!" snarled Mr. Dowall.</p>

  <p>Freddie was waiting for her in a decidedly cheerful and conciliatory
frame of mind. He listened without any comment to her shrill tirade....</p>

  <p>"He insulted me, and you sat there snoring like a pig! I wonder I didn't
smack his face.... You'll fire Dowall at once, Freddie!"</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Freddie chuckled.</p>

  <p>"He will be crushed in the general debacle," he said.</p>

  <p>She snapped at him.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't use foreign words to me! I know that you're better
educated than I am. What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean I'm taking no further risks with the Elcho. I've sublet the
theatre and I've sold the production."</p>

  <p>She switched on the light of the car to see him better.</p>

  <p>"You've sold the production."</p>

  <p>"Lock, stock, and barrel; hook, line, and sinker!" he said, almost gaily.
"The bare cost of the production is eight thousand&mdash;I had a banker's draft
for twelve this afternoon&mdash;and the only contract is an exchange of
letters."</p>

  <p>There was another spectator of the final scenes at the rehearsal. John
Crewe sat in the center of the deserted dress-circle, his coat pulled up over
his ears, and watched with increasing gloom chaos succeed chaos. He was a
witness, too, of the little scene between Elsa and Mr. Do wall, and when the
girl went back to the stage and he saw Dowall follow, he rose stiffly, and,
making his way down a dark staircase, passed through a little iron door on to
the stage. Dowall had just finished speaking to the understudy, and on Dian's
face was a look of despair.</p>

  <p>He helped her into her coat and they walked up the street towards an all-
night restaurant.</p>

  <p>"We'll both feel better after we have had something to eat," he said,
with an assumption of cheerfulness that he did not feel. "Your Elsa is rather a
termagant, and I didn't like her at all in the show; but I suppose
tomorrow&mdash;tonight she'll be better."</p>

  <p>"She isn't playing tonight," wailed Dian. "Oh, Johnny, I've got to
appear! Isn't it ghastly?"</p>

  <p>He wasn't so shocked at this as he might have been.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that's good news! You're certain to be better than she. What's
the matter with her?"</p>

  <p>Dian shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was bad temper and that she would appear, but Mr. Dowall is
certain she won't. She wants people to believe that the play has failed
because, owing to illness, she could not make her appearance. And it will fail,
Johnny. Mr. Dowall is the best prophet I know, and he says that failure is
inevitable."</p>

  <p>Johnny stopped dead in his stride.</p>

  <p>"The devil he did! That's bad news to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it doesn't matter," she said, ignorant of the cause of his
perturbation. "Anyway, I'm giving up the stage. What Alana said was
true&mdash;the story of the understudy who leaps to fame in a night is all
moonshine. I shan't either leap there or walk there or even crawl there." And
then she saw his face and her heart sank. "What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Let us eat first," he said ruefully.</p>

  <p>They went into the warm, well-lighted saloon of the restaurant and
ordered coffee and fried eggs; and the food was very comforting.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, as he lit a cigarette, "I am going to tell you how many
sizes of fool I am. That show belongs to me."</p>

  <p>She stared at him in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"I bought it," he said grimly. "Mr. Fred Vane told me the tale so
effectively that I have not only bought the show but I have taken a lease of
the theatre!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Johnny!" she gasped. "You never have! My dear, you'll lose every
penny&mdash;how wicked of him! But you can get your money back if she doesn't
appear. You must have stipulated for her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I stipulated for nothing: I didn't even have a contract with him. It was
one of those clever exchanges of letters to save lawyers' fees. And then he
laughed. "You needn't worry your little head about it. I don't want to lose
twelve thousand pounds, and have in addition the liability of the theatre on my
hands, but it won't absolutely break me, though it will make a big hole in my
reserves."</p>

  <p>He took her home and left her, almost in tears, at her Bloomsbury
lodging; then he went back in time to intercept the brain-weary Mr. Dowall just
as he was leaving the theatre.</p>

  <p>Dowall listened scowlingly and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You're the sucker, are you? I was wondering who it was. Making this show
go will be as easy as selling ice-cream to Eskimos. There's only one person in
the world who could save it, and that's Alana."</p>

  <p>"She's not in England."</p>

  <p>Dowall shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; she was in New York when I heard of her last. Anyway, she couldn't
rehearse it in time, and that's that. You've got to face the certainty of
losing your money, just as I've got to face the certainty of losing my job.
That doesn't worry me much, because I've been praying for the end of my
contract. Alana &bdquo;..!" He shook his head and sighed. "There's one chance
in eight with Alana, but with nobody else!"</p>

  <p>John agreed unhappily.</p>

  <p>In her dressing-room sat Dian, numbed and panic-stricken. She was dressed
for the first act, had been "made-up" and dressed for an hour.</p>

  <p>She gazed hopelessly at inevitable failure. The play was bad, the music,
the production, everything. To have made her appearance in the middle of a
successful run... that would have given her a chance.</p>

  <p>She looked round the resplendent dressing-room&mdash;it was
Elsa's&mdash;and shivered.</p>

  <p>The play might run a week&mdash;a month perhaps; and it was Johnny's.
Failure might not ruin him, but it would hurt him badly. This added
responsibility was disastrous.</p>

  <p>The telephone bell tinkled.</p>

  <p>She took up the instrument, thinking it was Johnny, and heard the stage
doorkeeper:</p>

  <p>"It's some sort of trunk call&mdash;I can't get it quite, miss. Will you
hang on?"</p>

  <p>She waited: in her ear were strange splutterings and whinings. Distant
voices spoke incomprehensibly. Some one near at hand said.... "Clear now to
your call...."</p>

  <p>And the noises died, and she heard a gentle voice:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, honey?"</p>

  <p>It was Alana's! She would have known it anywhere.</p>

  <p>"Alana! How wonderful! Are you in London?"</p>

  <p>Alana's soft, gurgling voice came to her.</p>

  <p>"No, honey&mdash;I'm in New York. I read you were opening tonight, so I
thought I'd call you...."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"It's all right&mdash;I guess I'm not too well... speaking from bed,
Dian&mdash;they didn't want me to talk, these doctors... but, you know,
honey... wanted to wish you luck and the ' now-how'... You forget yourself,
kid... just forget yourself... I'll be right along wishing for you... just
forget you're Dian... and remember that I'm with you...."</p>

  <p>The voice stopped: Dian thought she heard a woman's voice say something
sharply, and then there was a click, and a man said, "Call to New York
finished."</p>

  <p>For half an hour Dian sat looking straight ahead of her. The call boy
knocked at the door, and bellowed her name; and she rose and went out with a
feeling that it was not she who walked so light-heartedly along the dim passage
that led to the stage.</p>

  <p>Johnny did not reach the theatre till nearly eight o'clock, just before
the curtain rose, and he was staggered to find the best box occupied by
Freddie. At least he might have had the decency to keep away that night!</p>

  <p>The programme had been "slipped" with the information that, owing to
severe indisposition, Miss Elsa Forsyant would not make her appearance; and
with this as a text, John Crewe made his way to Freddie's box in an endeavor to
save something from the wreckage.</p>

  <p>Freddie listened with half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old man, but when I sold you the production I didn't undertake
that Miss Forsyant should appear. She's terribly ill... the doctor thinks it's
a, complete nervous breakdown and has ordered her away to the Riviera. But the
show's all right: don't let old Dowall rattle you. And that young lady of yours
is going to make a big hit, believe me."</p>

  <p>He slapped Johnny on the back, and John Crewe had to exercise a great
deal of self-restraint to prevent himself slapping back.</p>

  <p>He had hardly reached his seat when the curtain rose.</p>

  <p>The opening was weak. The best producer in the world could have done
nothing with the aristocrat's music. There was a stir in the theatre; the
gallery began to cough. Mr. Jevons, the conductor, a nervous man, mopped his
wet brow and communicated his nervousness to the orchestra. The first comedy
scene was painfully unfunny. Johnny writhed in his seat. And then, with a burst
of music&mdash;all the good numbers in the show had been imported for Elsa's
benefit &mdash;there came&mdash;Alana.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about it at all. For a moment the big house gasped,
and then, as it recognized its favorite, it rose and roared. She was a little
taken aback by the reception, smiled nervously, bowed, and began her number.</p>

  <p>It was Alana, with all her vivacity, all her cleverness, all the tricks
of hands and head: Alana's voice, Alana's twinkling feet. Again and again they
called her back.</p>

  <p>Crewe looked across to the box where Freddie was sitting. His face was
white, his mouth wide open. He sat like a man stricken dumb. In some mysterious
way the play had gathered itself together, as though the very presence of the
great star added some galvanic quality to its composition which it had not
possessed until she came on to the stage.</p>

  <p>The first act passed like a flash. Again came Alana; again she sang and
danced; again her drawling voice electrified her lovers. John saw them picking
up the little slips from the floor and scanning them. Who was Dian Donald? Was
it a new name by which Alana desired to be known? Had she been reconciled to
her husband....?</p>

  <p>The curtain fell, rose again, fell again, rose... On the tenth curtain
the house lights were switched on.</p>

  <p>John was passing the box on his way to the door leading to the stage when
Freddie appeared, dishevelled and shaken.</p>

  <p>"Back?... My God! It gave me a shock! Never had anything like it...."</p>

  <p>But John was already pushing open the steel door, and in a few seconds
was on the stage. He made his way through the electrified stage hands, down a
flight of stairs, and knocked at the door of Dian's dressing-room. She opened
it herself, and to his amazement she wore the same costume that Alana had
worn.</p>

  <p>"How was I?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She was trembling; her voice shook. He gaped at her.</p>

  <p>"You? Wasn't it Alana?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, a little hysterically.</p>

  <p>"Of course it wasn't, you silly booby! Didn't they give me a wonderful
reception? Johnny, I've got the know-how. You remember Alana said I would one
day? She's been on the phone to me tonight&mdash;it was wonderful!"</p>

  <p>He was silent, did not interrupt her when she began to speak rapidly
about the possibility of the play being a success.</p>

  <p>"The second act is the best. Even Mr. Dowall says so."</p>

  <p>"Where is Dowall?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Dowall was in his office, a tiny cupboard of a place opening from the
stage. John hurried back to find him sitting at his table, his head upon his
hands.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>The old producer looked up.</p>

  <p>"Beats me to blazes. You might have thought she was Alana... the same
technique. Did you notice that three-step movement of hers? Only Alana could do
that. By gosh, she's a riot! All the stage hands say she's as good as Alana at
her best."</p>

  <p>He stabbed John's shirt-front with his blunt forefinger.</p>

  <p>"You've got a chance with this show&mdash;just a chance. I never thought
they'd take to that girl&mdash;by gosh, what talent! And nobody guessed...."</p>

  <p>John saw the second act through as in a dream. The comedy which he had
thought dull took on an unexpected sparkle. The chorus, which had been a ragged
line of bored girls singing flatly, became a mechanically perfect entity,
radiantly lovely, rhythmic of movement. And Dian went from triumph to triumph.
One little song of the aristocratic composer which Elsa had committed herself
to sing was the biggest hit of the show. The management had not even troubled
to "plug" it, being only too anxious to have it over and forgotten.</p>

  <p>John heard people speaking around him.</p>

  <p>"It's Alana... it isn't Alana but it's very much like her... she's better
than Alana..."</p>

  <p>And every now and again he saw somebody in the audience consulting that
little slip which told of Miss Elsa Forsyant's indisposition and the
understudy's appearance.</p>

  <p>The curtain fell at last. Johnny could not believe that the play was
over. He met a dramatic critic hurrying forth putting on his coat.</p>

  <p>"Great show... new Alana... this is a bit of luck for Freddie Vane."</p>

  <p>When he reached the stage, Dian was the center of an excited group of
chorus girls, and he had to push his way to her side.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it wonderful, wonderful?" she breathed. "Oh, darling, I'm so glad,
for your sake! Everybody's been so sweet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not Alana!"</p>

  <p>The voice was shrill. Nobody would have recognized it as Freddie's. He
was like a drunken man, shaking from head to foot, his under lip quivering, his
eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>"You're not Alana... everybody thinks you're Alana..."</p>

  <p>And then he began to laugh hysterically. Possibly he had been drinking.
Some stage hands took him back to his box, helped him on with his coat, and put
him in a cab.</p>

  <p>"Let's stay up until the newspapers come out.... I want to see the
notices," Dian begged, and Johnny humored her; took her and two of the company
to his private room in the hotel, before he sent a messenger to Fleet Street to
collect the early morning editions.</p>

  <p>He opened the first of these, saw a headline and gasped:</p>

  <p class="headline">"TRAGIC COINCIDENCE"</p>

  <p>and the first paragraph ran:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Whilst the new Alana, Miss Dian Donald, scored a most
amazing individual triumph in <i>Great Heart</i> at the Elcho Theatre last
night, at the very moment of her appearance, when even the most experienced
members of the audience mistook her for the great star of a few years ago, the
real Alana Vane died, whilst she was in the act of talking on the wireless
phone to Miss Dian Donald from her sick- bed..."</p>

  <p>"Was it a good notice?" asked Dian anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Johnny, as he folded up the paper. "But I think we'd better
read these when we're alone."</p>

 <h2><a name="story08"
    id="story08">8. CHRISTMAS EVE AT THE CHINA DOG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Inventors are proverbially consecrated amongst the gods.
Tam M'Tavish
recalled the proverb and grinned at the reeking pot which bubbled and frothed
above the burner.</p>

  <p>It was a large iron pot, and he had first qualified for his ration by
extemporizing from the tubes of an ancient bicycle a tripod from which his
boiler was suspended.</p>

  <p>The draughty little barn which housed the home-scientist was a discarded
army hut of iron, and its few appointments were of a character which would not
burn. Moreover the boiling mess, which from time to time he stirred with an
iron rod, was non-inflammable. The smell of it poisoned the adjoining fields
and penetrated to the village a mile away, but Tam, in the throes of invention,
sniffed nothing.</p>

  <p>The tap of a stick's iron ferrule against the door roused him from his
rapt contemplation of the cauldron. The little man rose reluctantly, stooping
to turn down the flame of the burner, opened the door and stepped out into the
light.</p>

  <p>At first he thought the caller was a complete stranger. A glimpse of the
car's bonnet on the road at the end of the garden explained how the visitor had
come.</p>

  <p>"Why, Tam," said the stranger, "you're just as skinny and ugly as you
always were!"</p>

  <p>Tam's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"It's not Mr. Merrick?" he said in genuine astonishment. "Why, Mr.
Merrick, sir, you have changed."</p>

  <p>In the days of the war, Merrick had been one of the brightest and most
resourceful of the fighting airmen, and Tam spoke no more than the truth when
he said that his erstwhile comrade had changed. It was not a change for the
better. Sudden prosperity had not agreed with Walter Merrick: it had made him
unhealthily plump, and had brought tiny sacks under his eyes, and an
unwholesome color to the skin which Tam remembered used to be like the skin of
a girl.</p>

  <p>"Changed, have I?" said the other carelessly. "Well, you haven't. What
are you doing in there, Tam?"</p>

  <p>"It's a wee invention of mine," said Tam solemnly. "A new dope, Mr.
Merrick. 'Tis fireproof and waterproof, and I ha' no doots that I'll be making
me fortune one of these days."</p>

  <p>"You're married, aren't you!" said Merrick, as he walked towards the
house, with the shirt-sleeved Tam at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Tam, with that habitual caution which made him admit even
such important facts as his marriage with an air of reservation, "but ma lady
is awa'&mdash;in America. She's American," explained Tam, "and her folks wanted
to see the wee bairn."</p>

  <p>"So you're a grass widower&mdash;h'm, that's awkward."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrick looked round the cozy sitting-room into which Tam had ushered
him without any evidence of approval.</p>

  <p>"Why do you live out in this God-forsaken part of the world&mdash;I
suppose it is handy for your air taxi&mdash;I saw your advertisement in <i>The
Times</i> the other day. What is the bus like?"</p>

  <p>"She's like all the buses you ever knew, Mr. Merrick, sir," said Tam. He
was wondering why the absence of his wife should be described as "awkward."
"She has the engine of a bomber and the wings of a scout. I bought bits of her
from the disposal board, and I assembled them myself. You're not wanting a
ride, Mr. Merrick?"</p>

  <p>His eyes twinkled mischievously.</p>

  <p>"A ride? Good lord, no," said Mr. Merrick. "I haven't the nerve for it
now, Tam; I think I must be getting old."</p>

  <p>"Maybe your nerves are losing their confidence in ye," said Tam
quietly.</p>

  <p>Merrick had seated himself in a chair by the window and was looking
around restlessly.</p>

  <p>"My nerves are gone, that's a fact," he admitted. "I wouldn't dare trust
myself with a joy-stick now, though I don't suppose I'd be afraid to go as a
passenger, especially if you were the pilot, Tam."</p>

  <p>"Any testimonial you'd like to give to me would you kindly put into
writing, Mr. Merrick! I'm making a collection of them."</p>

  <p>There was an awkward pause. The visitor had certainly not yet revealed
his business, and Tam was curious to hear.</p>

  <p>Presently the object of his visit was exposed.</p>

  <p>"Tam," he said suddenly, "I'm wondering how you're fixed for money. Would
you like a five hundred pound job?"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred a year or five hundred a week?" asked Tam.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred pounds for a few days' work," said Mr. Merrick
impressively.</p>

  <p>He rose from his chair and paced up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what it is all about, Tam," he said, " and you'll
understand that I am putting myself rather in your power. It's about a
girl."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Tam quietly, "I was thinking it was, Mr. Merrick, sir."</p>

  <p>"She's very unhappy," said Mr. Merrick, who was no story-teller, and left
many gaps to be filled in by his hearer. "The fact is, Tam, she's married to a
fellow who doesn't appreciate her."</p>

  <p>"I've read of such cases," said Tam. "Ye have to get married before ye
get thoroughly unappreciated."</p>

  <p>"But I'm fond of her," said Mr. Merrick doggedly, "and she's fond of me.
I'm a pretty...</p>

  <p class="cp">:<br>
  [BLOCK OF UNRECOVERABLE OCR ERRORS]<br>
  :</p>

  <p>Merrick saw the hard look in Tam's eye.</p>

  <p>"It is all square and above-board," he added hastily.</p>

  <p class="cp">:<br>
  [BLOCK OF UNRECOVERABLE OCR ERRORS]<br>
  :</p>

  <p>"...an' a fine lady he married, Mr. Merrick.</p>

  <p>Tam looked at the floor for a long time. Then he walked slowly to the
door and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Ye'11 be getting along now, Mr. Merrick," he said. "There'll be rain
coming, or my corn is committing pair-jury."</p>

  <p>"All right," said the other, his face red with anger, "if you're going to
play the sneak on an old comrade, Tam, of course I'm in your power."</p>

  <p>"I would no outrage yar sense of decency by so low doon an action," said
Tam with cold sarcasm. "There's na reason to sneak against ye, Mr. Merrick;
ye're no married, and if ye were I shouldna want your wife, or the chaperone
within yair gates, to go zooming off to Paris wi' me. Noo, will ye get oot?"
His voice trembled with suppressed fury, and Mr. Merrick did not look back as
he strode down the flagged path of the garden to his waiting car.</p>

  <p>Tam went back to his room not a little perturbed. Such problems as these
came very seldom into his experience, and when, as they did at times, he caught
glimpses of an ugly side of life, more ugly than the battle-fields of France
and Flanders had shown him, he was nauseated.</p>

  <p>Before he had joined the Flying Corps he had been a mechanic in a Glasgow
factory, and his life had been one of singular austerity. He had hated war: his
chief offense against society had been his hatred of war, and his steadfast
refusal to join the army until the sheer mechanics of flying had lured him into
uniform. But there were things he hated worse than war.</p>

  <p>He had heard, and perforce been a spectator, of uncleanly things, but to
him they were part of the phenomena of the circumstances in which he found
himself. He was a spectator without ever having the faintest idea that he could
be a participator in irregularities which neither offended nor interested
him.</p>

  <p>He was not readily shocked, but now, as he sat down and thought out the
situation which had been presented to him that afternoon, he was first
bewildered, then horrified. Little Selby had been a favorite of his: Tam had
liked him because of his sheer incompetence. He was the worst pilot in the
flight, crashed more machines on landing than any other man in the squadron,
and had escaped the consequence of his blundering so often that he had earned
the nickname of "the immortal Selby." He was a straight little man, with a
heart as big as his head, a man without fear or malice. He had eventually been
transferred to the tactical bureau of the corps, where he had made a big name
for himself. Tam went to his wedding, and had admired, in his critical way, his
fluffy little bride. Tam was not a fair judge of women. Whatever might be their
qualities, they were foredoomed to fall short of the standard represented by
the girl who bore his name, and who, at that moment, with the chubby son of his
house, was visiting her relations on the other side. It didn't seem possible
that a girl like Mrs. Selby... and yet Tam knew in his heart of hearts that
Merrick had spoken the truth. To go to the injured husband was impossible. To
warn the girl herself was beyond Tam's courage.</p>

  <p>He went back to his little barn to find half his precious dope had boiled
over on the floor, extinguishing the fire and adding to the general confusion
of smells the additional pungency of escaping gas.</p>

  <p>It was a week later before Tam found time to go to London. His
experiment, and a hiring which took him into Cornwall, intervened.</p>

  <p>Selby, he discovered, was employed by a firm of city architects, but he
was not in his office. He had not been there for three days. Tam inquired for
his private address, and took a bus to Hampstead to call at the house, without
having any definite idea in his mind as to what he would say, or what excuse he
would make for his visit when he got there.</p>

  <p>He had, too, an uncomfortable feeling that Mrs. Selby knew of his refusal
to aid Merrick, and the knowledge that he was privy to her secret could not
fail to be embarrassing to both.</p>

  <p>The house, a little villa, was locked up. No answer came to his knock;
the blinds were drawn; and he inquired of a neighbor. The neighbor was so
woodenly discreet that Tam felt his heart sink. Then by a piece of good luck he
came upon a gossiping milkman who supplied disquieting information.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Selby had gone away; whither, nobody knew. She had left a note,
because the housemaid had seen Selby read it on his return in the evening. The
next morning he closed up the house, and himself disappeared.</p>

  <p>The milkman was satisfied that the lady had run away, and that her
husband had started off in pursuit of her, and that was the view that Tam took
until he read the next week in the newspaper a paragraph saying that John
Selby, an ex- officer of the Royal Air Force, had been charged with being drunk
and disorderly in the west end of London, and had been discharged with a
caution.</p>

  <p>Tam came to London again and tried to find his old comrade. At the police
court they furnished him with the address that the prisoner had given. This
proved to be a furnished room in Bloomsbury, which Selby had quitted the day
after his appearance at the police court.</p>

  <p>Tam went back to his experiments with a sad heart.</p>

  <p>It was four days before Christmas that he received a letter, and the
handwriting on the envelope seemed familiar. He opened it. It was from Selby,
and it was dated from Tunbridge Wells.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Tam (it ran), I hear you have been making inquiries
about me and I am sorry I missed you. At present I am in a nursing home, rather
run down, but I hope you will come and call upon us when I get out, which will
be some time in the new year. My wife will be very glad to see you. She has
been abroad for a little while, but she is now back in town."</p>

  <p>Tam read the letter again. "She is now back in town." He frowned, and
then a smile slowly dawned on his face, and he went back to the work of
painting his machine, for he had discovered that non-inflammable dope for which
inventors had sought, a dope that rendered even a soft wood fireproof, so that
he could thrust a stick painted with the wonder into the heart of a coal fire
and withdraw it hot but flameless. The sturdy little air-taxi grew green under
his persevering brush, and his diminutive assistant and he worked while
daylight lasted, covering fuselage and wings, rudder post, and elevators with
the fire- resisting concoction.</p>

  <p>On the Christmas Eve Tam had finished his work. It had been a raw, gray
day, a southwesterly gale had blown itself out, and had been succeeded by a
drizzling rain, and Tam, who, like most Scotsmen, had less of a sentimental
interest in Christmas than in the New Year, retired to his snuggery to read.</p>

  <p>Two long shelves carried his reading matter, and the literature was of a
type which is very seldom found in the libraries of ordinary students. For they
were those stories of daring and adventure which delight the heart of youth.
Stories of superhuman cowboys, of unnaturally villainous desperadoes, and
amazingly brilliant detectives, who discovered on the last page the solution
which the reader had found for himself on the second. Stories of heroic young
sailors, who, although of a tender age, had ordered captains from the bridge in
moments of peril, and had piloted gallant barques to safe harborage amidst the
applause of beautiful passengers. They were all very precious to Tam, and more
convincing, more human than the tales of Phryxus or Ulysses, or the Pythian
Apollo.</p>

  <p>He filled his pipe and settled back comfortably into his chair, and only
the sound of rainwater dripping from the runnels and the occasional flap-flap
where the wind caught a loose board of his hangar broke the stillness.
Presently the sound of the tapping board got on Tam's nerves, and he rose,
slipped on his boots, and went out into the night with a hammer and a nail. He
nailed down the board, opened the door of the hangar and took a look at the
machine. He touched the glittering paint with his finger, and wiped his finger
on his overall before he withdrew, locking the door behind him. As he drew
nearer the house he was conscious of a shrill sound. It was the telephone
ringing, and he hurried indoors.</p>

  <p>"Is that Mr. M'Tavish?" said a voice.</p>

  <p>"That's me," said Tam.</p>

  <p>"We've a job for you tonight."</p>

  <p>"Who is it talking?" asked Tam.</p>

  <p>The speaker gave the name of a firm that Tam did not remember having
heard before.</p>

  <p>"It's no' a night for flyin'," said Tam discouragingly, for the cheerful
fire and the open book on the table had a powerful appeal. "There's no moon
and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The fee is a hundred guineas each way," was the reply. "The glass has
gone up and the wind is veering to the west. It is a case of life or death, Mr.
M'Tavish."</p>

  <p>Tam scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"Will it no' do in the morning?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," was the emphatic reply. "A gentleman has been bitten by a mad dog.
He must get over to Paris tonight to the Pasteur institute for an injection.
You can bring him back before the early morning."</p>

  <p>"Is there no Pasteur institute in this country?" asked Tam in surprise.</p>

  <p>"This is a special case," said the man impatiently. "Will you take it?"</p>

  <p>"How long will he be?" asked Tam.</p>

  <p>"He'll be with you in an hour," was the answer.</p>

  <p>Tam looked at his watch. It was eight o'clock.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Does he know where I live? I'll be waiting in the
field."</p>

  <p>"Flash a lamp," said the speaker. "He will come over on his motor-
bicycle."</p>

  <p>"Where are you speaking from?" asked Tam.</p>

  <p>"From London," and then they were cut off.</p>

  <p>Tam hung up the telephone receiver, put a fire-guard before the fire, and
then went up to change. A quarter of an hour later with some difficulty he
wheeled the aeroplane from its hangar and filled up his tanks. Then he dragged
the machine to the end of the field he leased. A night ascent had no terrors
for Tam, particularly now that the wind had fallen and the stars showed through
the breaking clouds.</p>

  <p>He had been waiting half an hour when he heard the "ticka-tick" of a
motor- cycle coming along the road. Presently it stopped and he flashed his
hand-lamp. A few minutes later a man came walking towards him out of the
darkness. He saved Tam from committing the impertinence of flashing his lamp
upon him by stopping to light a cigarette. Tam had a glimpse of a man with a
close-cropped iron beard and heavy black eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You'll no' be able to smoke, sir," said Tam.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shan't I?" said the other gruffly as he threw his cigarette away.
"Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Ah've just to swing the prop," said Tam, and was moving off.</p>

  <p>"You'd better take this money," said the passenger, and thrust a roll of
notes into Tam's hand.</p>

  <p>"It would have done any time," said Tam politely. Nevertheless, he
buttoned it away into his pocket. The stranger, he noticed, was dressed in a
leather coat perfectly equipped for the journey.</p>

  <p>"Where would you like to be landing?" said Tam. "There are two
aerodromes."</p>

  <p>"There's one to the east of the city&mdash;the old army aerodrome."</p>

  <p>"It's no' used now," said Tam.</p>

  <p>"It will do," said the man. "It is nearest to&mdash;to the institute."</p>

  <p>Tam looked at him suspiciously. He was not the type of man who would be
engaged in smuggling, beside which he carried no baggage whatever, and the
things in which smugglers find profit have bulk. Tam knew that it was an
irregularity to land passengers at any other than the official aerodromes, but
he was not a stickler for the law. Tam, at heart, was a revolutionary.
Regulations filled him with an insane sense of resentment, and his first
temptation on being acquainted with a new rule was to break it.</p>

  <p>"Will you be able to land here on the return journey?" asked the
passenger.</p>

  <p>"I'll land or fa'," said Tam laconically.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the machine was racing through a mist of cloud, and
they glimpsed the world below at intervals. Tiny spangles of light at wide
intervals and parallelograms of lighted pin-points distinguished country from
town.</p>

  <p>Now they were over the sea, rolling and pitching in the uneven air which
the storm had left in its trail.</p>

  <p>Calais light stabbed up at them in vivid, narrow beams, and an air-way
lighthouse sent a steady pillar of light to the sky to direct them. Soon Paris
was ahead on the horizon, a blur of white and yellow lights, and Tam banked to
the left and peered downward for the landing ground he had known so well during
the war.</p>

  <p>It lay in the center of a triangle, the base of which was the white arcs
of a railway siding, the apex a blast furnace, the blue light of which was
visible.</p>

  <p>Tam had not landed here for eighteen months. It might have been built on
for all he knew, or worse still, it might be littered with war stores, the fate
of so many aerodromes.</p>

  <p>He could see nothing in the black void to which the nose of his machine
was pointing. Down, down he swept, and then peering through two eyes which were
veritable slits he dropped the nose a fraction more, flattened out and landed
without mishap.</p>

  <p>"Here ye are, sir," he said. "What time will ye be thinking of
returning?"</p>

  <p>The man leapt lightly to the ground.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not back by three o'clock I shall not be coming at all," he said,
and added, "I shall have been detained in the institute for further
treatment."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said Tam gravely. "The best way into the town is along
by the railway. You strike the road about five hundred yards away."</p>

  <p>The stranger did not trouble to reply. He disappeared into the darkness,
and Tam remembered that he had not asked him his name. He lit his pipe and was
walking round the machine when he felt something soft at his feet, and turned
the flashlight on it. It was the stranger's leather coat, his gloves and the
helmet he had been wearing. Apparently he had carried some sort of cloth cap in
his pocket. Tam looked at the coat and smiled ruefully, for it was daubed and
streaked with the fire-resisting dope which was perfect in all respects save
that it refused to dry.</p>

  <p>It happened that that night Mr. Merrick entertained a party at the "Chien
de Chine," which at the moment was the rendezvous of all that was smart and
fashionable in Paris. At eleven o'clock in the evening his dinner-party might
be said to have only just begun for most of the guests. For Mr. Merrick it had
begun in the afternoon at the American bar at Pangianas, and eleven o'clock
found him tearfully voluble on women and their fickleness. He had an interested
audience. For "Walter Merrick was an extraordinarily wealthy young man, and
those kind of orators command a respectful hearing. "Donna e mobile" from the
orchestra furnished at once the text and the excuse for the lecture, which
began with a toast which he insisted upon all his guests drinking. The toast
was "Absent fairies" and most of the company knew who his fairy was and the
circumstances in which she had flown away.</p>

  <p>"... mind you, I admit I was disagreeable," said Mr. Merrick a little
thickly. "But when a woman whines all the time about another fellow, what is a
fellow to do? I sent her packing! She bored me, she wearied me, but, girls, I
adore her!"</p>

  <p>He blinked back two drunken tears.</p>

  <p>"She's got 'n impossible husband, the awful fool&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He went on to talk frankly and, to the ears of any decent man or woman,
unpleasantly. They would have got up and left the gilded-mirrored room, and
would have drunk in God's fresh air with gratitude and relief. But the
acquaintances Walter Merrick had accumulated&mdash;and he had had the pick of
every revue house in Paris&mdash;only imperfectly understood him when he spoke
in English, and would not have been greatly offended if they had understood
all.</p>

  <p>"What I think about women&mdash;" resumed Merrick after a pause.</p>

  <p>He got so far when the door opened slowly. A man with an iron-gray beard
stood in the doorway. The bemused host did not see him for a moment, and when
he did a frown gathered on his plump face.</p>

  <p>"Hello, who the devil are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The stranger did not reply. He raised an automatic which was in his hand
and fired twice, and Walter Merrick fell across the table stone dead. Before
the most excitable could scream, the door closed with a crash and a key was
turned.</p>

  <p>It was half-past one when Tam thought he heard somebody moving toward
him, and pressed the key of his electric lamp.</p>

  <p>"There you are!" said a voice. "Put out your lamp. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Tam. "Did ye get what ye wanted?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the man shortly.</p>

  <p>They made a good get-away, but it was not till they were over Abbeville
that Tam remembered that he had not mentioned the leather coat which he had
stowed in the fuselage. He leant forward and tapped the man on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Your coat's under your seat," he yelled, and saw the passenger nod, but
he made no attempt to shelter himself from the keen southwesterly wind.</p>

  <p>Tam reached Horsham, flying unerringly by certain land-lights which were
familiar to him, and he made his landing in the dark without troubling to fire
the magnesium flares under his wing tips. It was four o'clock when he said good-
bye to the stranger, and heard the "ticka-tick" of his cycle growing fainter
and fainter in the direction of Horsham town. Then he turned to the task of
housing his machine.</p>

  <p>"A happy Christmas to ye, son," he said grimly as he stood surveying
himself in the bedroom mirror. "Ye're a grand pilot but, man, ye're a puir,
mean kind of inventor," and he spent another hour ridding himself of the dope
that would Hot dry on anything except his clothing.</p>

  <p>It was later in the morning over a frugal breakfast that he read of the
murder of Walter Merrick. The reporters had given a very graphic description of
the orgy which had preceded the murder, and one had secured an almost verbatim
report of Merrick's drunken homily. Tam read the account through several times.
Then he folded the paper and went on eating his breakfast with great calmness.
Now the story of May Selby's folly was revealed in all its ugliness, for
although no names were given, Tam guessed who the woman was&mdash;the woman who
had "bored" the exigent Mr. Merrick and whom he had sent "packing."</p>

  <p>In the afternoon he got out his little two-seater and drove to Tunbridge
Wells, a journey of twenty miles.</p>

  <p>He had no difficulty in finding the nursing-home where Selby was
confined, and almost immediately he was taken by the matron to the big room
which the sick man occupied.</p>

  <p>"No," said that lady in reply to his question. "Mr. Selby isn't very ill.
He requires rest and quiet. He has been suffering a little from over-
strain."</p>

  <p>"Has he been here long?"</p>

  <p>"For nearly a week," said the matron. "He has a room on the ground floor
in one of the wings. He is such a light sleeper that the slightest noise
awakens him. Mrs. Selby is with him now."</p>

  <p>Tam stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Selby?" he said in a panic, and then, drawing a long breath, "Verra
good, ma'am if ye'11 be kind enough to show me the way."</p>

  <p>Selby was in bed, a fair-haired young man, his face was drawn and a
little wasted by care, but he greeted Tam with a smile and a nod.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you, Tam," he said. "You got my letter."</p>

  <p>"Aye, I got your letter. Good afternoon, Mistress Selby."</p>

  <p>The girl who was sitting by the side of her husband's bed rose and held
out her hand. Something had matured what had been mere prettiness into an
almost ethereal beauty, thought Tam. There was no challenge in her eyes as he
had expected. She met him with the assurance which wisdom gives to saint and
sinner alike, and which comes from a knowledge of the worst. Her eyes were red,
Tam noticed, and Selby with his quick intuition must have realized that Tam had
noted this.</p>

  <p>"My wife is rather upset by the death of an old friend of ours," he said.
"You remember Merrick, Tam?"</p>

  <p>The coolness of the question took Tam's breath away.</p>

  <p>"Aye, I remember him," he said, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"He was the man who was shot in Paris last night," said Selby gently, and
Tam looked at him fascinated.</p>

  <p>"You don't say," he said; then:</p>

  <p>"Have you been to Paris lately?" asked Selby unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Tam was silent for a moment, then he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I've no' been to Paris for months," he replied, and his voice was as
steady as Selby's.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Selby went soon after, and Tam was left alone with the sick man.</p>

  <p>"It's a grand room you've got, Mr. Selby, sir," he said. "A beautiful
large window, and you could drop into the garden as easy as saying knife. And I
don't doot that ye could keep a nice little motor-cycle in yon garage."</p>

  <p>He nodded his head toward the open window.</p>

  <p>"I dare say I could, Tam," said Selby quietly.</p>

  <p>Tam rubbed his chin with an irritable gesture.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Selby, sir," he said, "do ye remember the theatrical entertainments
we used to have in France? They were fine and gay. And do ye remember how ye
used to make up like an auld gentleman, so that you're best friends wouldn't
know ye?"</p>

  <p>Selby did not reply.</p>

  <p>"I'll be awa' the noo," said Tam, and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>The other hesitated, and then with a quick movement clasped the
outstretched palm.</p>

  <p>Tam held the hand for a moment, then turned its palm upwards. There was a
faint green stain across the fingers.</p>

  <p>"Ye'11 find pumice-stone the only thing that'll take it off," said Tam,
and walked slowly to the door.</p>

  <p>With the edge of the door in his hand he turned.</p>

  <p>"Did ye not know, Mr. Selby, sir," he said reproachfully, "that ye could
no' smoke a cigarette in a bus! It was verra unprofessional, Mr. Selby, sir,
verra unprofessional."</p>

    id="story09">9. THE UNDISCLOSED CLIENT</a></h2>
  <p>A snowy night in early March; underfoot, the stone sidewalk smeared with
a film of mud. Yet Mr. Lester Cheyne did not hurry: his walk, the slow pace of
a man who was thoroughly enjoying a happy experience which he was loathe to
bring to the end, which was marked by the cozy lobby of Northumberland Court
and the luxury of a suite that lay beyond.</p>

  <p>The snow fell in a picturesque and almost theatrical way, large distinct
flakes that fell vertically and showed themselves to the best advantage in the
light of the big arc lamps. Along the Embankment the bare arms of the plane
trees were marked white; in the dark river that ran at the far side of the
granite parapet, two tug-boats were passing, one up and one down river. They
were tagged with green and red lights that splashed shivering and grotesque
reflections on the water. A span of yellow lamps located a distant bridge...</p>

  <p>Lester, his throat enveloped in the upturned lambskin of his coat collar,
could admire and absorb and enjoy. He had a wonderful feeling of content, such
as any healthy man might experience who had performed a difficult task to his
entire self-satisfaction.</p>

  <p>It was the rush hour: the offices were emptying and the sidewalk held a
triple line of hurrying walkers. He edged near to the railings of the Temple,
not desiring to hamper the toilers of the world in their homeward trek. He also
was a toiler, but in another sphere. He liked to think of himself as a general
who, in the silence of a room aloof from his fellows, planned subtle and
successful movements against an enemy, overwhelmingly superior in point of
numbers and backed by limitless resources.</p>

  <p>He was a slim, good-looking man of thirty-five, who looked ten years
younger. When he was revealed to strangers as a successful lawyer, they were
politely incredulous; yet he was very successful, and his sleek limousine and
the apartment with the waxed walls and the silken tapestries were there to
proclaim his prosperity to the world.</p>

  <p>It was not a novel experience to be jostled as he strolled: elbows had
grazed him, shoulders had lurched against his. A grunted pardon politely waved,
and they passed on into the obscurity of the night and the oblivion of their
unimportance.</p>

  <p>But the girl in the brown coat did more: touched him with her arm,
slipped sideways, and was caught deftly by the smiling Lester, and remained
everlastingly in his life as a memory never to be expunged.</p>

  <p>She fell ungracefully, one foot sliding outward, one doubled beneath her,
arms flung violently in an effort to balance.</p>

  <p>He caught her as awkwardly under the arm, and she slid forward, so that
she became a human wheelbarrow that he was unconsciously pushing.</p>

  <p>"Sorry... awfully sorry!"</p>

  <p>He must either allow her to sit down in the snow and mud, or she must get
up of her own power, for his rubbers had caked up with half-frozen slush and
his foothold was precarious.</p>

  <p>She recovered herself with the commendable agility of youth.</p>

  <p>Twenty... younger perhaps. Or older. He wasn't sure. The white light of
the spluttering arc lamp was merciless enough to tell whatever unpleasant truth
there was to be told. But the verity was very pleasant. Eyes any color, but big
and with little droops at the corners that gave her a certain lure. Mouth very
red. Complexion faultless so far as could be judged.</p>

  <p>She came erect, gripping at his fur collar: it was not an unpleasing
sensation.</p>

  <p>"I'm dreadfully sorry&mdash;I slipped."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," he said, and laughed.</p>

  <p>When she smiled she was rather beautiful. He had not seen any woman...
girl, whatever she was... quite so beautiful. At least, not for a very long
time. And because they met in the atmosphere and environment of adventure she
was almost painfully interesting.</p>

  <p>"I knew something was going to happen to me this night," she said in the
friendly way of one who shared equal mastership of the situation, if mastership
was called for. "I slipped up once this morning at home, and I slipped over a
rug in the office; the third trip was sure to come."</p>

  <p>She gave him the grim little smile that naturally accompanies a nod of
farewell, and quickened her pace to leave him behind. Then her right arm shot
out and caught hold of the railings. In a fraction of a second he overtook
her.</p>

  <p>"You'd better walk with me&mdash;I am wearing rubbers. Have you far to
go?"</p>

  <p>"Charing Cross tube," she said ruefully. "Thank you, I will: I seem
rather short on suitable footwear."</p>

  <p>She lived in a girls' club at Hampstead and worked in an office on King's
Bench Walk. She had seen two of the plays he mentioned...</p>

  <p>Shabby? Not exactly. Cheaply dressed described her better. He could price
the coat&mdash;the bargain stores sold them in saxe, t&ecirc;te de
n&egrave;gre, tobacco, fawn, navy, and black, and the fur collar had been, in
the lifetime of its original wearer, attached to a frisky white tail and a pair
of lop ears.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lester Cheyne had his private and personal record of past adventures,
and these included at least one young lady who had pounded the keys of a
typewriter by day, and had grown sentimental in his society after business
hours.</p>

  <p>But high or low, he could not parallel that face or overcome the
irritating sense that he had once met... seen... heard her before. A face in a
crowd perhaps, or he had caught a glimpse of her one sunny evening in summer.
He often walked this beat before dinner. The river inspired him.</p>

  <p>"Have you had dinner?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I? Lord, no! I take supper when I get home&mdash;when I'm hungry. I
think I shall be hungry enough tonight!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to be considering something; his head drooped forward.</p>

  <p>"If I suggested that I should give you dinner, would you call the
police?"</p>

  <p>He had a mock solemn brand of banter that never offended even a chance
acquaintance, and seldom failed to bring about whatever lay at the end of
it.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. One can't walk between the Temple and Charing Cross
six hundred times a year without gathering a few invitations to dinner," she
smiled.</p>

  <p>"And how many have you accepted?" he asked blandly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. He gathered that these extemporaneous hosts had drawn
blank.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you would," he said, "and yet I am most respectably
placed. I have a Member of Parliament as my neighbor on the left, and the Dean
of Westchurch has the flat on my right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was the slightest tinge of disappointment in her voice. "That would
be impossible, wouldn't it&mdash;I mean..."</p>

  <p>She did not say what she meant, but that hardly mattered. He was not
amazed that she had even considered the dinner invitation, because women could
not amaze him. He understood them too well. They were made of the very stuff of
unexpectedness. But he was a very quick thinker: as a general he struck like
lightning at the first weak spot exposed. This quality of his had been of
enormous profit to him.</p>

  <p>"I almost wish my dean was a bishop and the Member of Parliament a
Cabinet Minister," he murmured regretfully, "and that I, instead of being the
most humble of lawyers, were the Chief Justice on his bench!"</p>

  <p>Here was the parting of her ways. She had either to talk of snow and tugs
that went gleaming up and down Thames River, or else she must dovetail a
comment to his last words.</p>

  <p>"Are you a lawyer? Then I must know you. There isn't a barrister in the
Inner Temple I haven't seen."</p>

  <p>So he talked lawyers and his own insignificance until they began to slow
their paces, the yellow glow of the Underground station being just ahead of
them. Before the open booking-hall they lingered, yet nearer to the sidewalk's
edge than to the station. She wore a sort of pinky-brown silk stocking,
ludicrously inadequate in this weather. The neat ankles were mottled with
mud.</p>

  <p>"I would not dare ask you to dine and go to a show&mdash;you'd hate going
as you are. But a grilled pheasant and a spineless sole and a plebeian rice
pudding to follow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't! You are making me feel like a shipwrecked sailor."</p>

  <p>Still she hesitated and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is awfully nice of you, and somehow I know that you are&mdash;right.
But I couldn't possibly. Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>He nodded towards the railway bridge. Beyond, you can just see the
austere corner of Northumberland Court, all gray stone and sedate and
statesmanlike windows.</p>

  <p>"Where is that?"</p>

  <p>"Northumberland Court&mdash;next to the National Liberal Club. Its
austerity is depressing. My two maids are Churchwomen, and, fearing the worst,
peek through keyholes to make sure they are not missing it. At least I suspect
them. One goes to church on Sunday morning and one on Sunday night. They are
very English and can reconcile their deep religious convictions with a moderate
but regular consumption of Pale Ale!"</p>

  <p>She was looking at him all the time he talked, a half smile on her face,
a kind of reluctant amusement in her eyes. They were gray, turning blue on the
slightest provocation.</p>

  <p>"You talk like a novelist!" she said, and he was faintly annoyed. There
was an inference of plagiarism. "There is no sense in half-adventures," she
said. "Produce your roasted pheasants and your Church of England
parlormaid!"</p>

  <p>She walked more quickly now; seemed to him a little breathless. He hoped
that he was not mistaken in this. He thought he could define exactly her point
of view. She was crossing a Rubicon&mdash;but a shallow Rubicon. One could wade
back at the first hint of danger&mdash;could even stop in the middle and
cogitate upon the wisdom of the passage. So many women had created in their
minds this practicable stream, learning later in some pain of soul the
unfathomable depth of it, the swirl and fury of its inexorable current.</p>

  <p>His flat was on the ground floor. One frosty-faced virgin opened the door
to him, and vanished rapidly into the dining-room to set another place. Her
counterpart hovered at the door of the little drawing-room, ready to act as
guide or <i>vestiare</i>, or to perform whatever service woman can render to
woman.</p>

  <p>"Put your coat and hat in my room," said Lester. "Mary will show
you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gosh&mdash;look at me!"</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes were wide opened&mdash;she pointed a white finger towards
the photograph that leant limply against a vase on the mantelshelf.</p>

  <p>His first emotion was of anger at his stupidity in leaving the photograph
lying about. It came that morning; he thought he had locked it away in the
drawer. Possibly the dyspeptic Mary had propped it against the Chinese
candlestick.</p>

  <p>Followed a thrill of wonder. There certainly was a distinct likeness
between Lady Alice Farranay and Miss Brown Coat. A likeness and yet not a
likeness... that of course accounted for the strange sense he had had of
meeting a familiar face. He explained the dissimilarity.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly!" She had the lofty contempt of an elder sister. "I'm
shingled and she isn't&mdash;that's the only difference. I don't
know"&mdash;she was suddenly dubious&mdash;"the nose... These studio
photographers retouch so... but I am like her."</p>

  <p>She had pulled off her hat with a shake of her head, and now the likeness
was not so apparent.</p>

  <p>"She has a fringe... I haven't. If I grew a fringe and allowed my hair to
grow, and dressed it in that blobby way over the ears..."</p>

  <p>Mary at the door was stepping from foot to foot impatiently&mdash;the
girl became aware of her ingratiating smirk&mdash;a painful grimace which at
once beckoned and inquired and went out.</p>

  <p>Lester took up the photograph, examined it coldly, and laid it away in a
drawer. After dinner it must go into the safe, with the photograph of Lady
Alice that the butler took the day Johnny Basterby went to India, and the
letters he wrote to her, vulgarizing in the crudity of words a something which
had brought Alice Farranay into the splendid haze which is God.</p>

  <p>A difficult proposition.</p>

  <p>That is why Lester looked so coldly on the picture. The stuff of
unexpectedness was here. A fighter, and yet she did not have the appearance of
a fighter. Would she go down battling?&mdash;that was a question which very
nearly concerned Lester Cheyne. Never before had he felt a qualm of misgiving
or had the shade of a desire to back out, or recognized the depth and strength
of his own private Rubicon. The letters? Could they be interpreted in any other
than the obvious way? The butler's photograph... a back view, though
unmistakably her ladyship. But might not a second cousin be permitted the
liberty of an encircling arm as they paced towards Gollards Covert? He was
leaving for India the next day, remember. These problems Mr. Cheyne had taken
to the Thames Embankment and had settled to his complete satisfaction, when the
brown-coated girl had executed pirouettes in the snow.</p>

  <p>She would not fight. That kind of woman never fought, especially when
they had money to burn. Not intelligent women. Alice could draw a check for
twenty-five thousand pounds as easily as for ten. And the Undisclosed Client
would benefit as usual.</p>

  <p>Lord John Farranay was immensely rich. If he lived to inherit his
father's dukedom he would be even richer. There was some doubt as to whether he
would live. His father was ninety, Lord John a little over fifty, nearly thirty
years his wife's senior. But John Farranay had lived&mdash;not nicely, it is
true, and he was an older man than his father, who had sown his wild oats in
the hunting-field.</p>

  <p>A tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you are!"</p>

  <p>He was relieved to see her. That word was revelation. Relieved. Never
before in all his life had he welcomed diversion from the business at hand.</p>

  <p>"You look awfully nice. What have you been doing to yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I tried to work down a fringe. What have you done with the
picture? What a shame! You have put it away!"</p>

  <p>"Pheasant!" he smiled. "And rice pudding!"</p>

  <p>She admired the furnishing, the taste, the quiet luxury of everything. In
the hall she stopped to look at the etchings, and before she sat down at the
polished table must inspect the Corot over the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"Soft... and air and breeze in it, isn't there!"</p>

  <p>The lace mats on the table were rather fascinating. She fingered their
texture with a sure, understanding touch.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are married? There's a sort of woman atmosphere which
can't be your Pale Ale&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Entered Mary with plates and dishes on a dumb waiter, and comment
continued along these lines would have been embarrassing.</p>

  <p>She was immensely pretty; not skinny either, as so many of these poor-
eating typists are. And rather beautiful hands. Her throat too&mdash;he was a
connoisseur in the matter of throats. The line of them should incline a little
forward and have as their capitol a peculiarly rounded chin.</p>

  <p>"Wine you won't have, of course. Water is good for the young. I think I
will take water too, Mary."</p>

  <p>When the white-aproned servitor woman had gone:</p>

  <p>"Do you know, this is very unreal? It is rather like one of those day-
dreams that wanders on under its own power and brings you into such strange
places. My name is Lois Martin. I suppose you are entitled to know that."</p>

  <p>"Mine is Lester Cheyne... I'm sorry, I should have told you that
before."</p>

  <p>She took up the glass of water and drank slowly; put it down, patted her
lips with the serviette.</p>

  <p>"Who is she?&mdash;is that a very impertinent question?"</p>

  <p>"Who? You mean the photograph? She's&mdash;er&mdash;just an
acquaintance... a friend of a friend. I don't know much about her except that
she is married to a very rich man who is rather jealous, rather mean, and
desperately unwholesome. He is thirty years older than she."</p>

  <p>"Why did she marry him?"</p>

  <p>"He is very rich."</p>

  <p>Lois Martin sighed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose one ought to have a contempt for women who marry rich men. But
money means an awful lot: it comes into everything. It keeps you out of crowds,
and you can't get into crowds without having something rubbed off&mdash;polish
or bloom. And it keeps other people&mdash;people you love&mdash;out of crowds
and queues. The divine thing that money buys is&mdash;isolation."</p>

  <p>Curiously he looked at her. She spoke with a strange earnestness.</p>

  <p>"And whom do you love?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She was thinking of something, for she started at the sound of his
voice.</p>

  <p>"Nobody&mdash;yet. I love dreams and the beautiful things that come in
dreams."</p>

  <p>Her left hand rested on the table. Sure of her agreement, he reached out
and covered it with his, and she did not draw her hand away. So far and no
farther he went. This almost resemblance to Lady Alice was rather
amusing&mdash;added a piquancy to the situation. To make love to one woman and
to blackmail her twin ... it was amusing.</p>

  <p>"I rather like you," he said. "Do people worry you who have immediate
likings and dislikings?"</p>

  <p>"No. An interest which has to be flogged or coaxed is a pale substitute
for the real thing. People either magnetize you and you jump an awful long way
towards them, or else they belong to the crowd."</p>

  <p>He was encouraged.</p>

  <p>"My view entirely. I like to jump right into the grand salon of
friendships&mdash;I loathe giving my name at the door and being handed on
through the antechambers, my virtue explained at every stage. By the time
you've got to the middle of things there is nothing to be learnt about you and
you're a bore exposed!"</p>

  <p>When she said, as she did at eight o'clock, that she must go, he offered
no objection.</p>

  <p>"But I do hope that you will come to dinner one night&mdash;soon. I have
an idea at the back of my head that we may be awfully useful to one
another&mdash;I am shamelessly utilitarian, aren't I? But I feel that way
towards girls&mdash;especially girls who are working for their living, and who
aren't just looking for a good time and hang the consequence."</p>

  <p>The paternal note seldom failed him, but for once there was a serious
purpose behind his little speech. But how she might be employed, or whether he
could employ her at all, were questions that tomorrow must answer.</p>

  <p>She was hesitant again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know... I should like to come, awfully."</p>

  <p>Her scrutiny of his face was searching: she seemed baffled at the end of
it. Not that his face was inscrutable to the student of physiognomy.
Superficially he was handsome in a dark, pinched way. There were pictures of
notable Florentines in the National Gallery that were of his type without his
glossy little moustache. He was thin-lipped, blue-chinned, deep-eyed. Giovanni
Bellini painted a Doge of Venice who was not unlike Lester Cheyne, though he
was darker than Loredano.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;would you like me to come, really?"</p>

  <p>Here was the conventional surrender.</p>

  <p>He drove her home to Hampstead in a taxi and they held hands lightly most
of the way.</p>

  <p>She was quite different in most respects from the average pick-up,
ladylike if not a lady. Though this quality was not essential, he had found.
One pair of red, warm lips differed only from another in respect to the soul
and the imagination back of the caress they offered.</p>

  <p>Therefore he had every reason to be pleased with himself when he returned
to Northumberland Court to the contemplation of Lady Alice Farranay, that
beautiful but stiff-necked lady who might go down fighting but probably would
not.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cheyne's office was in the city of London, near Aldermanbury. It was
like and yet unlike a lawyer's office. The appointments and furnishings
reflected his own luxurious tastes. His staff was restricted to a girl who
typed with two fingers and got through life with half a brain. She came in to
him when he rang his bell, a dumpy young lady in an artificial silk jumper and
a string of imitation amber beads.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mortlake has been waiting half an hour," she said in a hushed
voice.</p>

  <p>In two years of service she had learnt only this: she must not shout.</p>

  <p>"Show him in, Clarissa."</p>

  <p>His mood was gay and friendly. Her homely face was distorted in a smile
of respectful reproof, for her name was Annie, but she was usually called Miss
Synes.</p>

  <p>A dapperish man, with a head too big for his thin body and an unhealthy
white face, tiptoed into the room, holding a derby hat in his hand. He sat down
in the chair which the girl had placed, and laid his hat on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Anything?" He drooped his head on one side&mdash;a gesture of
interrogation.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Mortlake."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cheyne had already run through the letters: there was none bearing
the Melton Mowbray postmark.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;she'll write. Her ladyship is very obstinate, but she won't...
you don't think she will?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cheyne shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You know her ladyship best," he said. "I am rather worried about the
business&mdash;in fact, I am almost sorry that I agreed to act for you. The
case is so very peculiar; in fact, it has almost the appearance of
blackmail."</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of Mr. Cheyne's operations was that there always came a
moment in his relationship with his Undisclosed Clients when he expressed the
wish that he was not acting for them and when their "cases" bore some
verisimilitude to the crime of extorting money by threats. And yet invariably
he went on to the bitter end, until, in fact, a check or a sealed packet of
banknotes enabled him to write "finis" to the episode.</p>

  <p>There was sometimes an unpleasant aftermath. His clients had been known
to complain in bitterness of the inadequacy of their reward.</p>

  <p>There was the valet of the Honorable Arthur Keverling, who found a bundle
of letters from the young wife of the Minister of Justice; and Millie Winston,
the lady's maid, who brought to Aldermanbury the stupidly indiscreet diary of
her mistress'; and that wretched wastrel, the brother of Fay Lanseer, who
thought that five thousand was a mighty poor share of the seventy thousand
pounds which Lord Charholm had paid rather than hear his letters read in open
court&mdash;Fay being his wife's best friend. But in the end they had been glad
enough to avoid the alternative which Mr. Cheyne had offered&mdash;the return
of money and documents under cover of a letter in which Mr. Cheyne would
express his pain and indignation that he had been unwillingly and innocently
the agent of blackmailers.</p>

  <p>Mortlake was visibly alarmed.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how you can say that, Mr. Cheyne. When I came to you first,
you told me that I was to sue her for money lent and for damages... my being
kicked out at a minute's notice and all that."</p>

  <p>Which was true.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cheyne was a blackmailer, but no vulgar blackmailer. He might very
properly threaten to sue for the return of mythical loans; that is part of a
lawyer's business. He might take into his possession documents of a most
compromising character, letters such as men and women have written to one
another since the art of writing was invented, but he only did this to prove
that the mere possession of such letters by his client was proof of his
trustworthiness. For who would give letters of this kind to a servant for safe
custody unless he or she was on such terms of friendship with the hireling that
the loan, for the recovery of which action was taken, might very well have been
solicited and granted? And if the victims of the Undisclosed Client retorted
that the letters had been stolen, that was a very serious charge indeed, and
Mr. Cheyne over his own signature suggested, nay demanded, that the pilfering
servant should be prosecuted.</p>

  <p>"You left Lady Alice's employment six weeks ago&mdash;were you with her
long?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen months," said Mr. Mortlake. "His lordship engaged me soon after
the marriage. I must say she's the best of the pair. His lordship is a swine in
every way."</p>

  <p>"Jealous?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mortlake smiled.</p>

  <p>"Of his own shadow! He used to be, anyway, till he took up with Miss
Wenbury. He'd give his head for a divorce and her ladyship knows it. He's
poisonous...."</p>

  <p>He explained just why Lord John Farranay was poisonous, and Mr. Cheyne
listened. He was not at all squeamish.</p>

  <p>"The letters might get him the divorce&mdash;the photograph is worthless.
We want something more. I wonder..."</p>

  <p>His brows met in a disfiguring frown.</p>

  <p>The girl in the Brown Coat beautifully arrayed and with that fringe
manipulated, might very well be Lady Alice But exactly how he might use this
resemblance was not clear.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;don't come tomorrow. Say Friday, or, better still, next
Monday."</p>

  <p>Miss Synes' answered the bell and stood imploringly at the open door
until the visitor passed her.</p>

  <p>Another letter, thought Mr. Cheyne. He dipped his pen in ink.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Madam,</p>

  <p class="letter" style="text-align:center">Yourself and an Undisclosed
Client</p>

  <p class="letter">We are surprised that we have not had a reply to our
letter of the 13th inst. You will, we feel sure, appreciate our desire to spare
you unnecessary trouble and expense, nor is it our wish to place on record the
name of our client, since we feel sure that it would be painful to you to have
thus emphasized a financial transaction which might not be regarded as
consonant with your dignity.</p>

  <p class="letter">Briefly we restate our claim: in October last you borrowed
from our client the sum of fifty thousand pounds, giving him as security
certain letters which passed between yourself and Captain John Basterby, now on
the staff of H. E. the Viceroy of India. The statement in your brief note of
the 3rd to the effect that the letters were stolen by our client, who had never
possessed so large a sum as fifty thousand pounds, constitutes a very serious
charge. We feel in the circumstances that we must challenge you to prosecute
our client for his alleged theft. In so far as concerns his ability to command
so large a sum, we have our client's assurance that he inherited a considerable
fortune from an uncle in America. We have again to request the name of your
lawyer, who will accept service on behalf of our client.</p>

  <p>Very correct; very proper. He blotted the draft and summoned his typist
to make a fair copy.</p>

  <p>Two nights later came the girl in the Brown Coat&mdash;punctually. Mr.
Cheyne let her in.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind a cold dinner? My maids have developed symptoms of
influenza. Don't be alarmed!"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a bit alarmed," she said.</p>

  <p>He was afraid she would come in evening dress: bargain-basement evening
dress might spoil her. Except that she wore a lighter frock and had a pair of
new shoes obviously purchased for the occasion, she was the same exquisite lady
of his recollection.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking a lot about you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Like?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;these beastly mornings and nights, and the thought of you
tramping through the slush with a herd of dirty people&mdash;and packed in
stuffy cars. You don't belong to crowds. I've thought of what you said about
crowds. How much do you earn a week?"</p>

  <p>She named a sum as he relieved her of her coat. A ridiculously small sum
it was.</p>

  <p>"Absurd!"</p>

  <p>He chucked the coat on the settee and led her to the fire, and when his
arm went round her she did not so much as shiver. She even smiled up into his
face.</p>

  <p>"We are getting along," she said.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. I suppose I should if I were properly constituted. But it is rather
easy to be made a fuss of, and one doesn't carry around the Girl Guides' Code
of Conduct."</p>

  <p>Stooping, he touched her lips with his, and then she pushed him gently
away from her.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something. Are you in the Temple?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;City. I'm commercial. I've a bleak little office off Queen
Victoria Street."</p>

  <p>She made a little face.</p>

  <p>"How uninteresting! I hoped at least you were a police lawyer. Crime is
so awfully fascinating. We are Chancery lawyers; dull! I could scream
sometimes. You do a lot of work here, don't your'</p>

  <p>She pulled at the handle of the green wall-safe.</p>

  <p>"How funny! That doesn't seem to go with the furniture, and you have
wonderful taste."</p>

  <p>"Come and eat," he replied, purring. He loved appreciation of his finer
side.</p>

  <p>There was wine on the table, but he offered her none until she pushed
forward her glass.</p>

  <p>"Bless your bright eyes!" He toasted her, and immediately afterwards: "I
am going to make you rich," he said, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like temptation," she said, and he admitted that it was.
Women love directness. He knew all about women. Too great a subtlety silts up
progress. Yet he was a delicate speaker and she listened without protest.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't... I don't think I could. There would be awful trouble at the
club. One is supposed to be in by twelve. And... no!</p>

  <p>And yet it was an easy matter to send somebody for her belongings next
day. She had a friend there who would pack them.</p>

  <p>"Talk about something else. Where is the picture of the beautiful lady
like me? Who is she&mdash;really?"</p>

  <p>He poured her another glass of wine and then filled his own.</p>

  <p>"She is the defendant in a case I am bringing on behalf of&mdash;an
Undisclosed Client."</p>

  <p>She wanted him to explain further, pleaded with him to bring the
picture.</p>

  <p>"A little alteration and you would be her double," he said, when he
brought it back and laid it on the table before her.</p>

  <p>She stared down at the photograph.</p>

  <p>"Who was she?"</p>

  <p>"She was the daughter of a disagreeable old soldier," he said carelessly.
"But to the devil with her! Let us speak of really important things."</p>

  <p>He was behind her as he spoke; both his arms went round her, meeting at
the waist; the shingled head was against his cheek, the fragrance of hair and
skin was a little heady, and he had his first heart-thump.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she has an Undisclosed Client too," she suggested, and he
laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Even now you don't understand&mdash;and after all the trouble I took to
explain! Only lawyers have clients&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her head turned&mdash;his lips sought hers.</p>

  <p>"No... I couldn't. I was stupid to come here. Drink your wine."</p>

  <p>She struggled out of his grasp, but not frantically. Surrender was in
every gentle movement of her.</p>

  <p>He lifted the glass.</p>

  <p>"Here's to us!" he said.</p>

  <p>"To the Undisclosed Client!" she mocked, and they drank together.</p>

  <p>"Queer how you and I met," he said, and dabbed his lips with a silk
handkerchief. "Out of all the millions that walk these greasy streets&mdash;you
are terribly like her."</p>

  <p>"Like?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Alice&mdash;except for the way you dress your hair, you might be
her double."</p>

  <p>The girl had been looking down at the tablecloth, fiddling with the stem
of her wine-glass. Now she raised her eyes and there was a queer smile in
them.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am&mdash;I should be, you know. I am Lady Alice Farranay!"</p>

  <p>His mouth opened in surprise and then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You took my breath away: your little joke, eh!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Alice. You see, you are a difficult man to fight. I had heard
about you&mdash;Fay Keverling told me. Of course you had the letters and things
from Mortlake&mdash;my butler? I see I am right."</p>

  <p>"You're&mdash;Lady&mdash;Alice?"</p>

  <p>He was numb with amazement&mdash;he had never felt quite as he felt now,
so dazed, so peculiarly stupefied.</p>

  <p>"I thought it would be easy&mdash;but not so easy as it was. And when you
asked me here to a little dinner, I knew that you would be alone. I had to do
it. I have an Undisclosed Client too&mdash;one worth fighting for," she said,
and he smiled crookedly.</p>

  <p>"By gad&mdash;you've a nerve... now suppose you go, Lady... Lady
Alice..."</p>

  <p>His forehead was wet, he was surprised to find when he put up his hand to
it.</p>

  <p>"What d'you expec' to get... coming here?"</p>

  <p>Why was his speech so thick, and his heart bumping so?</p>

  <p>"The letters... they are in your safe. I had to guess that. And the key
is on the chain in your pocket. I put some stuff in your wine when you were out
of the room. Morphia and something else&mdash;there is a dear old doctor who
would have given me poison if I had wanted it.... Of course I knew you would be
alone..."</p>

  <p>He did not hear the rest very distinctly. Clutching the edge of the table
and bringing all his will power to bear, he attempted to walk to the door. And
then his knees doubled under him and he found the floor very pleasant to lie
upon and dream upon...</p>

  <p>The girl watched him till he lay still, and then, leaning over him, she
unfastened the golden key-chain he carried, examined the ring, and, choosing a
key, walked to the safe. This she unlocked with a hand that did not tremble.</p>

  <p>She took out the letters and read their beginnings... near the end of one
a sentence arrested her eye.</p>

  <p>"...I have a feeling something happened. You will tell me, beloved, won't
you? And I'll stand by you..."</p>

  <p>Lady Alice Farranay smiled faintly and dropped letters and photograph
into the fire and watched them consumed to ashes. On the table was her
photograph. It had been a shock to find herself confronted with that when she
first entered the flat. But by drawing his attention to the resemblance she had
stifled surprise before it had formed. This photograph went the way of its
fellow; curled blackly in the flames, and was poked to fragments.</p>

  <p>Relocking the safe, she fastened the keychain to the pocket of the
unconscious man, picked up her overcoat, then she walked out into
Northumberland Avenue and hailed a taxi.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Mr. Cheyne was in retirement at a little Italian town when he read the
announcement in the Paris edition of an English paper. He knew, of course, that
the old Duke and his impossible son had died in the same week, but this
intelligence was both new and startling:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Lady Alice Farranay gave birth yesterday to a son, and
Billshire is rejoicing that the Dukedom is not, as was feared, extinct. Lady
Alice is the daughter of the late General Sir Gregory Starmart, and comes of a
famous fighting family."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Mr. Cheyne&mdash;for very good reasons he called himself
"Mr. Burton Smith," and he had shaved off his moustache. "Humph! Baby!...
Undisclosed Client! I never thought of that!"</p>

 <h2><a name="story10"
    id="story10">10. RED BEARD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One of his most jealously guarded secrets should have
perished when the
safety- catch of John Mildred's Browning pistol caught in a loose strand of
thread as he was pulling his gun. How that thread came to be there may be
explained in technical language by Mildred's housekeeper, who kept his clothes
in repair.</p>

  <p>The thread was stout, but broke at the second jerk, and the mischief was
done. At the first tug a loop had formed about the catch and had pulled it to
safety, and when John threw his gun at Red Beard nothing happened. He saw the
mischief and thumbed down the catch, but by this time the visitor had fired
three times, shattering the aorta arch and the pulmonary artery.</p>

  <p>John, his hands widespread on the table, stared at his murderer, and in
his last moment of life God gave him vision.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad... didn't shoot," coughed John Mildred thickly, and smiled.</p>

  <p>Then he sat down carefully in his writing-chair and as carefully died. I
found him reclining over the table, his head on his arms, and 'phoned Central
Office.</p>

  <p>Evidence produced: One Browning pistol unfired, with loop of thread
jammed between safety-catch and chamber; one broken thread in hip pocket; one
weeping, hysterical housekeeper who admitted Red Beard at 10:15 p.m., and had
heard the shots and "Mr. Mildred's last words, poor gentleman," and had
subsequently been pushed aside by Red Beard. Evidence of unexploded cartridges
in Mildred's faithless pistol, and three shells from the murderer's
gun&mdash;and Mildred. He was killed by three shots from a Holt automatic 45
calibre.</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn, Deputy Chief of the Department, came along with me to conduct
the examination, and he kept the real police at bay in the hall below until we
had finished; this by virtue of our special warrants and the fact that
Brinkhorn is all sorts of a great white chief, a deputy sheriff, a puller of
strings, and what not.</p>

  <p>"Rum how old Mildred hated people with whiskers," I said, remembering
John's eccentricity. "I'll bet it was the humiliation of being shot out by Red
Beard that hurt him most."</p>

  <p>"You can't choose your murderer in these times," said Brinkhorn, always
the philosopher; "help me lay him on the sofa, I want to search his
pockets."</p>

  <p>But I suggested leaving him until the real police came&mdash;they are
frantically jealous folk, and Brinkhorn agreed.</p>

  <p>John had a little smile on his white face when we, having admitted the
impatient coppers, put him down. It was as though he had lived long enough to
see a capital joke in circumstances which arranged his dissolution.</p>

  <p>The police made notes and would have collected his papers and probably
would have sealed up the room also, but Brinkhorn stopped them, 'phoned the
Chief Commissioner, and secured endorsement of the divine right of Military
Intelligence to interfere. Then we bundled the cops out of the room, lit our
pipes, took off our coats, and got busy. It was a warm room, being centrally
heated. We opened the drawers systematically, taking the locked drawers
first.</p>

  <p>John was one of those card-index maniacs, who flourish even in
departments like ours. If you wanted to discover his trouble you turned up "T"
so to speak. As a matter of fact, we knew most of his secrets, but not the
cause of his feud with the red-bearded man. We hoped to find it here. He had
told us, of course, little bits about Red Whiskers, but had so punctuated his
recital with those deep, choking chuckles of his, that we never really knew how
much there was in it.</p>

  <p>"The point is," said Brinkhorn, sitting down suddenly in the chair from
which we had just removed the dead man (you cease to be sentimental after your
tenth violent death), "the point is, was old man Mildred pulling our legs when
he told us that he was being threatened?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I have seen the letters," said I; "they followed him about all over the
shop. They used to be waiting for him at the club. Even when he went on secret
missions, which nobody but you and I knew about, he would find them waiting for
him at his hotel, addressed to him in his assumed name. They were always signed
'Red Beard,' and always telling him that his time was near at hand."</p>

  <p>I shall always remember Brinkhorn as he sat, his chin resting on his
hand, his elbow on the table, his eager, handsome face momentarily clouded.</p>

  <p>"He never showed them to me," he said, half to himself; "that is curious,
because I was one of his best pals. I am not saying," he said, hastily
apologetic, "that you didn't know him better in many ways than I, and it is
only natural that you should, because you were working together, and most of
the coups he pulled off during the war were as much to your credit as to
his."</p>

  <p>"In some cases more to his than mine, in some cases more to mine than
his," said I. "He deserves the whole credit for catching von Klotz, the woman,
Minnie Lauer, and the Pfeifer gang, whilst I think that pretty well all the
credit for catching Schmidt, da Silver, and Martinique go to me."</p>

  <p>That may sound immodest, but four years of strain and danger and
sleepless anxiety have destroyed most of my affectations, even the pose of
modesty.</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better go through the record of the men he pinched," he
said; "this is obviously a vendetta, and one of the relatives of the gentleman
who 'marched with a firm step to the gallows' as the newspapers say, is behind
this affair. Afterwards we will talk to the housekeeper lady if she has quite
recovered. By the way," he said suddenly, "what happened to that card that was
on the floor when we came in!"</p>

  <p>There certainly had been a card, one of those large index cards on which
Mildred was wont to enter data, and it had assuredly been lying-midway between
the door and the desk when we came into the room. It was not there now.</p>

  <p>"I picked it up," I said, "and put it on the desk."</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn turned over the papers, but there was no card. "Whereupon he
cursed all interfering policemen, and 'phoned the nearest station, but without
success. The two active and intelligent officers of the law who had made a
superficial search of the desk, had taken nothing away with them. I looked at
Brinkhorn and Brinkhorn looked at me.</p>

  <p>"It is strange," he said, and we dropped the subject temporarily.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty at all in unearthing the record of the men whom
Mildred had hunted to death. We found the index number under
"E"&mdash;"Espionage, convictions for," and we took their dossiers out of the
deep twin cabinet beneath the bookcase. There they were, the whole crowd of
them, and it pleased me to see how he had marked my cases, or rather those in
which I played a more prominent part than he, with a big "T" for Templey, which
is my name.</p>

  <p>We carried them to the desk under the light, and went through them
carefully. Willie von Klotz, Hans and Johanna Pfeifer, the van Lauer woman,
Bissing, Prensa, Schumacher&mdash;they were all there.</p>

  <p>"Who was Goertz?" asked Brinkhorn suddenly. "I don't seem to remember
that case."</p>

  <p>"You were in France at the time," I said, "but it was an ordinary typical
case of espionage. Mildred shadowed him for a week before he arrested him at
Plymouth. He was shot in the Tower."</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn read through the closely written precis in silence, his head in
his hands.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this," he said.</p>

  <p>"'Von Goertz is an officer of the Prussian Hussars. He speaks English and
French fluently. In appearance he is a fine-looking fellow, tall and well made.
He has a good forehead, blue eyes, and'&mdash;" Brinkhorn paused and looked
up.&mdash;"'A striking red beard!'"</p>

  <p>"H'm," said I, "this is not our Red Beard at any rate, for Goertz was
shot and Mildred saw the execution."</p>

  <p>"You are sure of this?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," said I. "I can give you the name of the Provost Marshal who
superintended the business."</p>

  <p>"There is no chance of course, of his having got away or having escaped
death?" mused Brinkhorn.</p>

  <p>I smiled.</p>

  <p>"Men who are shot at twelve paces with soft-nosed bullets do not, as a
rule, escape death," said I dryly.</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn looked across to the sofa where Mildred lay.</p>

  <p>"Then it wasn't Goertz," he said; "let us have the lady up."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cummins, the housekeeper, had reached the feeble and helpless
condition of hysteria, when even the sight of Mildred's body would not unduly
distress her, but to make absolutely sure, Brinkhorn and I pushed the sofa into
the dressing- room and shut the door.</p>

  <p>We got her seated, and I put her through a mild cross-examination.</p>

  <p>At 9:30, Mr. Mildred being out (so her story went), there came a ring at
the front door, and, thinking it was her employer, she opened it to discover a
man on the doorstep. It was snowing heavily, a particularly wild night, and
there was only a dim electric light in the doorway and that covered by an art-
shade, so that she had the vaguest impression as to the visitor's
appearance.</p>

  <p>"Was he tall?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Middle size, if anything. He wore a long fur-lined overcoat and a soft
hat, and he had gloves&mdash;big furry gloves on his hands."</p>

  <p>She was emphatic as to the red beard which flowed over the front of his
coat and glistened with melting snow. Equally sure she was that that part of
his face as was visible was "as white as death."</p>

  <p>He asked if Mr. Mildred was in, and when she said No, he said he would
wait. She hesitated, but he was urgent, speaking in a gruff voice which somehow
did not seem to her to be natural.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mildred had so many strange visitors, she said in extenuation (and
this we understood perfectly well), that she did not like to deny him, and led
the way up to Mildred's room, switching on the table-lamp and bringing forward
an arm- chair where he might sit. Happily her perturbation of mind was set at
rest a few moments later, when she heard Mildred's key in the lock of the front
door, and went to meet him with the information that a gentleman had called.</p>

  <p>"And he expected him, sir," said the trembling housekeeper. "When I told
him a gentleman was waiting, he said, smiling quite pleasant, 'Has he got a red
beard?'"</p>

  <p>"And you said 'Yes,'" said Brinkhorn, nodding. "Did he say anything more
to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more, sir. I heard him go into his room, and then I thought I
would go upstairs to find if he wanted anything&mdash;he usually had a cup of
tea. I was outside the door when I heard voices, then three shots"&mdash;her
lips trembled. "I heard Mr. Mildred say, 'I am glad I didn't shoot you,' and
for a bit I thought it was all right. I was very frightened, sir. I was going
downstairs when the door was flung open and the red-bearded gentleman dashed
down past me. Then I telephoned to Mr. Templey at his club&mdash;Mr. Mildred
told me I was always to telephone to Mr. Templey in case of emergency, and that
is all I know, sir."</p>

  <p>"You heard nothing beside the shots and Mr. Mildred saving, 'I am glad I
didn't shoot you'?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

  <p>"Has the red-bearded gentleman been here before?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been warned not to admit the red-bearded man?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>Again she was hesitant.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mildred did say," she said, "that he was expecting a funny visitor
one of these days, and he asked me how tall I was."</p>

  <p>"That's a rum question to ask you," smiled Brinkhorn.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was, sir, but you know Mr. Mildred would have his little
joke."</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn lifted his head.</p>

  <p>"There's the bell, Mrs. Cummins. I think you will find it is the police
ambulance. I shall leave one of my men here tonight. Nothing must be dusted or
tidied or in any way touched in this room until I give you permission."</p>

  <p>We accompanied Mildred's body and saw him put away in the hospital
mortuary, then I accepted Brinkhorn's invitation to go home with him to
supper.</p>

  <p>"If your wife doesn't object to a visit at this hour," I said.</p>

  <p>"I have just telephoned to her," said Brinkhorn, "and she will be glad to
see you."</p>

  <p>(One of the advantages of marrying a widow, thought I, as the taxi drove
slowly across Westminster Bridge in a perfect blizzard, is that she is
accustomed to the eccentricities of mankind and nothing surprises her, even the
apparition of her husband arriving home with a guest at midnight.) Great minds
think alike, and Brinkhorn must have had a telepathic wave.</p>

  <p>"God has given me a very intelligent wife," he said, with a happy little
laugh. "I would like to bet if we gave her all the facts of the case she would
find a solution to the mystery of Red Beard. How she hates the Huns, poor
girl!"</p>

  <p>The story of Mrs. Brinkhorn was known to me. She had been the wife of a
Canadian officer, and was on her way to England, accompanied by her baby boy,
to join her husband. Her voyage coincided with the big gas attack in the Ypres
salient, and her husband was killed on the very day that U.97 had torpedoed a
liner in which she was traveling. She and a few passengers who were landed on
the Irish coast were the only survivors. Undoubtedly she hated the Hun.</p>

  <p>"The case is a pretty simple one," Brinkhorn went back to our dead
friend. "Mildred is, or was, a clever servant of the Department of Justice,
lent by Washington to our Counter-Espionage Bureau. In the course of the four
years he brings to justice a large number of German agents, amongst them von
Goertz, whose brother determines to be revenged upon the slayer of his
relative. Being a Hun, and totally ignorant of the Anglo-Saxon temperament, he
thinks he will terrorize Mildred by writing threatening letters, the
terrorization consisting not so much in the letters and their contents, but
lying in the fact that this unknown avenger is able to demonstrate his
knowledge of Mildred's movements.</p>

  <p>"He awaits a favorable opportunity, gains admission to Mildred's room,
probably ransacks his bureau&mdash;by the way we must find out what happened to
that card&mdash;and shoots our pal."</p>

  <p>"How do you account for Mildred's curious speech?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"About being glad he didn't shoot him? Yes, that's rather quaint! Have
you any theory?"</p>

  <p>I made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Of course it may be this," Brinkhorn went on, "that Mildred preferred
that his murderer should endure the suspense of a trial."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't Mildred's way," said I. "There wasn't a kinder-hearted man
in the world than John."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you one of these days," said I, as the cab drew up before the
house in Bryanston Square where Brinkhorn lived.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brinkhorn was a truly remarkable woman. She showed neither annoyance
nor impatience with her husband for bringing a guest to the house at that hour,
and had a nice little supper waiting for us. I had met her once before, but had
never been so struck by her ethereal beauty. She wore a negligee costume of
deep blue chiffon velvet. It was a sort of costume which to my ignorant eyes
might have either been a dressing-gown or a dress, but I can only recall an
impression of stateliness which was particularly pleasing.</p>

  <p>"The telephone awoke Frank," she said with a smile; "he wants to come
down to say goodnight."</p>

  <p>"Have him down," smiled Brinkhorn.</p>

  <p>When the sleepy little fellow came toddling into the room, it was clear
to me that Brinkhorn loved the child as much as if it was his own. He pushed
him toward me for my admiration. He was a plump, sturdy little chap, and
Brinkhorn laughed as I pulled up the leg of his pyjama.</p>

  <p>"A sturdy boy," said I, patting his calves.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brinkhorn smiled faintly and put out her hand to the boy.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Frank dear; you must go back to bed," she said.</p>

  <p>She rejoined us a few minutes later, and by this time we were deep in the
discussion of Mildred's end.</p>

  <p>She listened without interruption until Brinkhorn turned to her.</p>

  <p>"I was saying, my dear," said he, "that if we could leave this case in
your hands, we would be pretty certain to find Mildred's murderer."</p>

  <p>"You have a very great opinion of my genius," she said.</p>

  <p>"And very rightly," said Brinkhorn warmly. "Now I am going to tell you,
Templey, what I have never told anyone else. I have had a great deal of success
in this war, and half of it is due to my wife. She has been my ghost and has
done a lot of the work I have got credit for. Yes, you have, dear," he said,
when she laughingly protested; "I rely upon your judgment absolutely."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Templey is shocked," she smiled; "he thinks you have been betraying
terrible Government secrets to me."</p>

  <p>"It takes a great deal to shock me, Mrs. Brinkhorn," said I, "and I must
confess that I am tremendously interested in what your husband says. Although
he is not aware of the fact, I have taken up Mildred's murder, and intend
applying myself single-handed to tracking down Mr. Red Beard, and I believe you
can be of the greatest assistance to me."</p>

  <p>They both stared at me.</p>

  <p>"You think I am impertinent," said I, "and it certainly does sound as
though I was taking advantage of your confidence and hospitality, but there are
points in this case which your husband has overlooked, and which I feel sure I
could, with your assistance, elucidate. Mysteries which could be cleared
up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Including the mystery of the disappearing index card?" interrupted
Brinkhorn.</p>

  <p>"Even that," said I.</p>

  <p>"I should be glad to help you, said the girl&mdash;I judged her to be
about twenty- seven. "When would you like to call me into consultation?" she
asked, with quiet laughter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There's a challenge for you," mocked Brinkhorn.</p>

  <p>"If it were not so late, I should say&mdash;now!" said I.</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"I will go up and hold the boy's hand until he goes to sleep," he said.
"How long is this consultation going to last?"</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes," I suggested.</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn exchanged amused glances with his wife.</p>

  <p>"In ten minutes, when I come back, you shall have the whole mystery
cleared up. Mildred's assailant shall be in the hands of justice."</p>

  <p>"I won't promise that," said I, "but I promise that I shall know who
committed the murder."</p>

  <p>He paused at the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget the missing card," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is the first mystery which shall be unraveled," said I, and the
door clicked behind him.</p>

  <p>For a second or so we looked at one another, and then the laughter died
out of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Templey?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Are you left-handed, Mrs. Brinkhorn?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Why?" She colored slightly.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you in a moment," said I, and putting my hand in my inside
jacket pocket I took out a card and laid it on the table. "We will settle the
question of the missing card straight away," I said. "I picked it up from the
floor and put it in my pocket. Will you read it?"</p>

  <p>She took it in her hand and her eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Why, this is all about me," she said.</p>

  <p>"I think you know," I said, "that Mr. Mildred had a passion for
collecting data about his cases. Let me read this to you:</p>

  <p>"'Mary Mabel Tensthall. Born New Jersey 1891. Married George O. Fenton,
citizen U.S.A. Detroit 1912. One son. Lived Canada. Husband killed Ypres
salient, April 1915 (1st Canadians). Mary Mabel and her child on way to meet
her husband, April 1915 in S.S. Calgary. Mined or torpedoed off the Fastnets
with all hands and passengers except few survivors brought to Queenstown. Note,
they were third class.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Underneath was written:</p>

  <p>"'M.M.T. booked from St. Paul (local sipping office) First-class saloon
tickets.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I and my boy were two of the survivors," she said.</p>

  <p>"Read underneath, Mrs. Brinkhorn; you will see these words: 'M.M.T.
booked from St. Paul (local shipping office) First-class saloon
tickets.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But that proves what I say. I traveled first class."</p>

  <p>"No first-class passengers were saved," said I.</p>

  <p>"That is a mistake," she replied quietly. "Mr. Mildred got things all
wrong."</p>

  <p>"Now I will read you a little memorandum that I took myself this evening
about a man named von Goertz, who was shot in the Tower of London in the early
part of 1915.</p>

  <p>"'Von Goertz is supposed to have been working with his wife and
child.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Mrs. Brinkhorn.</p>

  <p>"Here is another little item I jotted down from Mildred's description. It
was from the body marks of von Goertz:</p>

  <p>"'Mole right shoulder. Large orange-colored birth-mark on inside of left
calf."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Mrs. Brinkhorn again.</p>

  <p>"Your boy has that mark too, Mrs. Brinkhorn," I said.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence then:</p>

  <p>"And now," I asked, "will you please show me your right hand."</p>

  <p>She made no movement.</p>

  <p>"You served me tonight with your left. That is why I asked you if you
were left-handed. You passed the bread with your left hand. You poured out the
wine for me with your left hand. "Will you please let me see your right?"</p>

  <p>"What an absurd request!" she said, but she did not show me.</p>

  <p>"When a Browning pistol is fired," said I, "there is an escape of gas
from the chamber, which leaves a black patch on the hand between the finger and
thumb. Will you show me your right hand?"</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"No, I will not," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then I will tell you the rest of the story," said I. "You were in
Ireland when your husband was killed. You were at Queenstown when the survivors
came in. To my knowledge, they were searching for the wife of von Goertz, and
it was pretty well known that Mrs. Von Goertz&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Baroness von Goertz," she corrected.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said I&mdash;"was in Ireland. You had sworn to
yourself to avenge the death of your husband, and the torpedoing of the Calgary
gave you your opportunity. Posing as the wife of Captain Fenton, you made your
way to London, sought out Brinkhorn, who fell in love with you. You married him
that you might get deeper into the secrets of his Bureau. It was because he
trusted you and confided in you that you know all the movements of Mildred,
which were often known only to myself and your husband. It was you, and you
alone, who shot him, and he recognized you just before his death and said he
was glad he had not shot you."</p>

  <p>She was as white as a sheet and sat bolt upright, her hands folded in her
lap.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>It was the only question I could not answer. I had laid my watch on the
table when Brinkhorn went out, and six minutes had already passed.</p>

  <p>"You may think that I am trying to escape you," she said, "and that I am
lying to save my life." There was a thrilling sincerity in her voice, and I did
not doubt her. "I loved my husband. I adored him. To me he was a god. We German
women have a capacity for adoration which you will never understand. You will
understand less, and believe me less, when I tell you that I love Frank
Brinkhorn. Will you give me until twelve o'clock tomorrow to decide?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>Brinkhorn came in a few minutes later.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said jovially, "have you made your great discovery?"</p>

  <p>I laughed.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Brinkhorn has been very helpful," I said, rising to go.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to tell me?" he said, in mock disgust.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," said I.</p>

  <p>He looked at me sharply.</p>

  <p>"What an officious devil you are, Templey!" said he; "and I didn't
realize that you knew I had resigned from the Department."</p>

  <p>"Resigned from the Department?" It was my turn to be surprised. "When did
this happen?"</p>

  <p>"Today," said he. "But for Mildred's death, Grace and I would be leaving
for South America on Saturday. I have a ranch in the Argentine, and I want to
get the bugs and cobwebs of war out of my brain."</p>

  <p>I looked at Mrs. Brinkhorn, and there was an appeal in her eyes which I
have never seen before, and I hope I shall never see again.</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, with a gaiety which I did not feel, "I will extend your
time, madam, until Saturday midnight."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>I do not know whether she ever told Brinkhorn. I had a wire from him last
week, saying that he didn't intend returning to England, and asking me to
settle his bills, and the last word in the wire was "Thanks."</p>

  <p>I found I had to settle Mrs. Brinkhorn's bills as well, and there was one
from Clarkson for spirit gum and red crepe hair. I paid it without batting a
lid. After all, Mildred, standing on the border-line of eternity, was glad he
had not killed her, and Mildred was a pal of mine, and his implied wishes were
sacred. Still, I thought it was funny that I should have to pay for the Bed
Beard!</p>

 <h2><a name="story11"
    id="story11">11. THE MAN WHO KILLED HIMSELF</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Preston Somerville was standing on his balcony as the train
wheezed and
snorted up the last stiff slope to Caux. So that he saw the man and the woman
arrive. There were a pair of prismatic field-glasses on the little, round, iron
table which, with a basket-chair, constituted the furniture of the balcony, and
he focused them upon the station.</p>

  <p>Yes, he was right, and, curiously enough, he had expected them that very
day by that very train. They would not see him, the gaudy sun-blind above him
was cover; besides, he was too far away. He watched them walking up the path, a
porter carrying their two valises. Behind, walking at his leisure, was George
Dixon; him he had recognized almost before he had stepped on to the
platform.</p>

  <p>Marie and the man were coming to the hotel of the Stars! They might, in
decency, have gone to the Palace or the Grand, or to one of the big pensions.
But Templar! He smiled. Templar had no finesse.</p>

  <p>He looked again through the glasses.</p>

  <p>Marie had grown stouter. He could not see the color of her hair, but
doubted whether it was still the same fluff of gold that he had known seventeen
years before.</p>

  <p>As to Templar, he had put on flesh considerably. It was over a year since
he had seen him!</p>

  <p>Somerville shrugged his shoulders and turned to survey the glory of Lac
Leman, blue, purple, and eau de nil. There was snow on Grammont that had come
in the night. The Dent du Midi was white down to the tree line. Two thousand
feet below him was Territet, a toy-town set in a garden. A beautiful country
and a wonderful world, and for him prospects of the brightest, except...</p>

  <p>He walked back into his room, unlocked a bureau and took out a weather-
stained grip. It was fastened with two locks, and these he opened at leisure.
He put in his hand and pulled forth a leather case which also needed unlocking.
There were two packages of letters, a few photographs, and something in a blue
envelope. He had carried this around for years. There was absolutely no
necessity for his doing so. Indeed, it amounted to a folly. It was a
certificate of marriage, and recorded the fact that Preston George Somerville
had married Marie Clara Legrande, and the date was seventeen years before. Why
a man should carry about the evidence of his own bigamy, that criminal folly of
his which, for seventeen years, had been an unceasing nightmare, he could not
explain. He had married when he was eighteen, and his married life had been
short but violent. His wife had left him, and then Marie Templar had come
along. He might have told her the truth, and was on the point of doing
so&mdash;he put away the certificate and locked it up. He had spent the greater
part of seventeen years wondering as much over the things he did not do as
those he had done.</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, looked up, and crossed the room with outstretched
hands to welcome George Dixon.</p>

  <p>"Why, you're looking fine, Preston," said that man of law, returning the
grip. "How on earth did you know I was in Switzerland? It knocked me over to
get your wire."</p>

  <p>"I read the newspapers," said Somerville, "especially the Visitors' List,
and I spotted you at Interlaken."</p>

  <p>"One item of news I've to break to you, old man," said Dixon, "and it is
that I must be back in London in three days' time. That means that I must leave
this paradise tonight or tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Somerville nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't be better," he said. "Sounds uncomplimentary, doesn't it?
Well, it isn't really."</p>

  <p>"And now what is the trouble?" began the lawyer. "And before you tell me
anything, I suppose you know who is here?"</p>

  <p>Somerville nodded again.</p>

  <p>"I came up in the train with him," Dixon went on. "Is there going to
be&mdash;a settlement?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is going to be a settlement."</p>

  <p>Somerville's voice was soft, and he seemed to be speaking half to
himself.</p>

  <p>"Well, if I can do anything to bring that about, Preston, I'll wait a
week," said the other heartily. "Man, you've been ten times a fool to have let
this thing go on. I could have stopped it for you ten years ago when you first
told me, if you 'd only given me the word."</p>

  <p>"I'll stop it&mdash;myself," said Somerville, and Mr. Dixon looked at him
curiously.</p>

  <p>"How did this man Templar come into the case? You never explained it to
me."</p>

  <p>Somerville was filling his pipe, his eyes fixed upon the bluey-white
mountains, and he did not reply immediately.</p>

  <p>"There is much that I haven't told you," he said, "but Templar is the
easiest thing to explain. Marie, that is my second wife, was a member of a
third-class musical company which came to the wilderness where I was nursing my
private grief&mdash;I think that is the expression. Templar was her manager in
more senses than one. I think I was a little mad. In fact, I think I was very
mad. I was keen on Marie, and that in itself was a form of lunacy. I am not
going to make excuses, George, and really the excuse I offer reveals my
greatest offense; but I was not sober for fourteen days when I took Marie
Legrande&mdash;God knows what her real name was&mdash;to the nearest joy town,
perjured myself before the necessary official, and took her for better or for
worse. She discovered the truth three months afterwards, through Templar.
Personally, I think she would have let the thing go without bothering, only,
unfortunately"&mdash;he pronounced all five syllables of the
word&mdash;"Templar wasn't of the letting-go sort. It was my misfortune that I
had money. That's the story: Templar and she have been running together ever
since. I tell you, I don't think Marie is a bad lot. She is one of the weak,
fluffy type, who loves the good things of life, and I have kept her and Templar
on Easy Street ever since. I have lived through"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"I am going to be melodramatic, if I am not careful", he said,
with a faint smile. "I was content to pay and go on paying, only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Only what?" asked George.</p>

  <p>The other got up and strolled out on to the balcony, looked around and
came back before he answered.</p>

  <p>"When my first wife ran away from me, I had been married about six
months," he resumed in that slow, matter-of-fact tone of his. "Seven or eight
months later&mdash;in fact, a few weeks after I had married Marie&mdash;I
received a note from my first wife, asking me if I could meet her. It was that
note which fell into the hands of Templar, and left him in no doubt whatever as
to my offense. That, however, is by the way. I met the first Mrs. Somerville,
and she made me a present&mdash;the most wonderful present that any man has
ever received at the hands of a woman." His voice shook momentarily.</p>

  <p>From his inside pocket he took a flat leather case, opened and handed it
to the Lawyer. George Dixon saw the smiling face of a girl, radiant and
beautiful, looking out at him from the leather frame.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"My daughter."</p>

  <p>"Your daughter!" gasped George. "But I never knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That was one of the secrets I kept," said Somerville, and took the case
back.</p>

  <p>He looked at the face for a moment, closed the cover, and replaced it in
his pocket.</p>

  <p>"That was one of the secrets I kept," he repeated, "and will explain, if
nothing else does, just why I have been so complacent. I know as well as you
that, if I went into court, my punishment would be purely nominal. I might even
gain the respectful sympathies of a court crowded with stout ladies from
Bayswater. But this"&mdash;he tapped his pocket&mdash;"how would it affect
this? No, no, George, that wasn't the solution."</p>

  <p>"But does Templar know?"</p>

  <p>Somerville nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is why he's coming three months before his time," he said. "He only
discovered the fact a month or so ago. My little girl is at Cheltenham, and
apparently she took part in some school theatricals, and earned an honorable
mention in the local newspaper. The honorable mentioner, unhappily, added the
name of Preston Somerville as the father of this delightful debutante. They had
a pull before they knew about Maisie. What sort of a pull have they now?"</p>

  <p>"But there must be a solution, there must, Preston," said George.
"Couldn't you send the girl to America&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Somerville stopped him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Solutions and solutions," he said; "and because I have hit upon one I
telegraphed to you, providentially discovering you at Interlaken, to come along
and see me. My affairs at home are in pretty straight order, but I wanted you
to know about the girl, because you may have to administer my estate."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" cried George Dixon. "You're not going to find that way out!
Think, think, Preston! You used to be so clever at this sort of thing when we
were at Oxford. Don't you remember our crime club discussion, how you used to
work out the solution of all the story mysteries, and plan to the minutest
detail mysteries even more mysterious than appeared in newspapers? Surely some
of that old ingenuity remains?"</p>

  <p>Somerville stopped in his restless stride and looked down at the other.</p>

  <p>"It's curious you recall that," he said, "extremely curious. Because, as
I say, I think I have found the solution to all my problems."</p>

  <p>George sprang up, his eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"I knew you would, old fellow. By Gad, I'm glad!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've found a solution," said the other slowly. "I've had a
detective watching these two people. It was he who wired me that I might expect
them here. My sleuth discovered many interesting facts, but none quite so
vitally important as " he paused.</p>

  <p>"As?" said George Dixon impatiently.</p>

  <p>"As the thing he carries in his right-hand waistcoat pocket," said
Somerville, speaking with quiet emphasis.</p>

  <p>""What is it?" asked the other curiously.</p>

  <p>"That you will discover. We must leave the revelation to the very last
chapter," smiled Preston Somerville. "But there it is, snug in his right-hand
waistcoat pocket." He laughed softly. "I've lived through hell because of that
man," he said, without raising his voice. "The woman is different. I'm certain
of that. She alone would never trouble me."</p>

  <p>He heaved a long sigh, then turned abruptly to his friend, and his tone
was brisk and businesslike.</p>

  <p>"Now, George, I'll tell you just what I want you to do, in case my scheme
goes wrong...."</p>

  <p>In a large double bedroom of the Hotel of the Stars, the stout and florid
Mr. Templar sat on the edge of his bed, looking at the lady who was registered
in his name. She was on her knees before her open valise, unpacking with some
show of reluctance.</p>

  <p>"You told me that we'd only be here a day," she said discontentedly.</p>

  <p>"It all depends. Marie," said the other, speaking through his cigar. "We
may have to wire home for money."</p>

  <p>Her next words confirmed Mr. Somerville's judgment.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you leave him alone?" she asked, twisting round and sitting on
her heels. She was still a passably pretty woman, though the gold of her hair
did not carry conviction to the sophisticated. "Poor devil! We've bled him
enough, and we've got enough too, Joe; why not let's go back home and see that
farm you're always talking about!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Templar chuckled. There was little of the desperado in his
appearance, for he was mild, thin-haired, and readily amused. His face was
pink, his bulging eyes unlined. He took life very easily.</p>

  <p>"If I had listened to you," he said good-humoredly, "you'd have had
twenty weeks' engagements a year at about four pounds per. I should have been
managing dirty little third-rate companies in dirty little fourth-rate towns.
Here you are in a beautiful country, living on the fat of the land at the best
hotels, and you're grousing. You haven't had a bad time for years; not a real
bad time."</p>

  <p>She had resumed her unpacking.</p>

  <p>"It depends on what you call a bad time," she said. "I've had my bad
times, don't you worry! And you've had yours too, Joe." She swung round.
"There's been times when you've thought that Preston was going for you. Do you
remember that night in Paris when you saw him with the fellow from Scotland
Yard, walking through the cafe?"</p>

  <p>He blinked and swallowed.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," he said uneasily. "Prison&mdash;phew! I'll never do that! I
have lived like a gentleman, and I think I can die like a gentleman," and his
hand strayed to his right-hand waistcoat pocket. "There's something in that
farm idea, dear," he said after a while. "I've always said so too. Let's try
him this once, and then we'll chuck it."</p>

  <p>She, on her knees, laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"If you've said that once, you've said it forty times; anyway, I'm not
going to see him."</p>

  <p>"Did I ask you to?" demanded Mr. Templar in an aggrieved tone.</p>

  <p>It was not till the next morning that he met his victim. They were alone
on the broad stoep of the hotel, looking down over Territet. Templar made his
usual gambit.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Somerville, I am sorry to trouble you again, but things have
been going pretty badly."</p>

  <p>"They'll go worse for you," interrupted Somerville, with unexpected
malignity. "I shall live to see you some cold, misty morning hauling stones
from the Dartmoor quarries. I've promised myself the pleasure of a trip to
Princetown with this object."</p>

  <p>Templar was speechless. This was not the man he had known, the cynical,
quiet gentleman with the hard smile, who had paid without question, and had
offered him no other offense than his contempt.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I," he spluttered. "What do you mean? Suppose it is you who go
there?" He raised his voice. " Suppose I send you there and bring... your
daughter to see you! That makes you sit up, old man? Suppose I bring her
down... to see you? That's a different tale, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>A faint flush had come to Somerville's lean cheeks, but his provocation
had served its purpose. Templar's loud voice had brought an inquisitive waiter
to the verandah, who lingered a moment, eyeing them interestedly, until the
fact that his presence was not required was made obvious, and he retired.</p>

  <p>"How much do you want this time?" asked Somerville in a quieter voice.</p>

  <p>"Three thousand," said Templar, made bold by anger." That is, seventy-
five thousand francs Swiss."</p>

  <p>Somerville walked to the balustrade of the stoep and leant on his folded
arms, looking down to the lake. In Templar's eyes he was a crushed and beaten
man. That final argument about the daughter had been sufficient, said Templar
to Templar, and exulting in the new weapon he planned other raids, conveniently
forgetting the attractions of farm life which panic had conjured.</p>

  <p>Presently the other man looked round.</p>

  <p>"Meet me tomorrow afternoon at three o 'clock, in the Gorge du
Chauderon."</p>

  <p>"Gorge du Chauderon?" said Templar, puzzled. "Where's that!"</p>

  <p>"You walk down the hill to Glion, turn to your right through the town,
and you'll strike a road which leads eventually to Les Avants. Near the bridge
which crosses the gorge, you will find a path which runs down to the river-bed.
It's a nice, quiet place, where we are not likely to be interrupted."</p>

  <p>"Why not here?" asked the stout man. "I can come to your room
tonight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll get your blood-money in the Gorge or nowhere," said the other
decisively. "What's the matter with you, Templar? As a rule, you don't care for
your 'allowance' to be transferred in a room, where the transaction might be
witnessed by a hidden detective; that was the excuse you made in London for
taking me out in the middle of the night to the Embankment."</p>

  <p>"There are plenty of places we can meet," growled Templar,
"besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's the place I have decided upon," said Somerville.</p>

  <p>Templar was eyeing him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"There's going to be no monkey tricks, you know, Preston Somerville!" he
blustered. "If you try... I'll have no mercy on you!"</p>

  <p>Somerville snapped his fingers contemptuously, and turned away.</p>

  <p>"At three o'clock," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'll be there"&mdash;between his teeth; "and if you attempt
any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Somerville did not wait. He walked leisurely along the stoep, turned in
through the lounge, and made his way to the manager's office. Templar followed.
He had his doubts and his own fears. He took a chair where he could watch the
entrance to the bureau, and as the time passed and Somerville did not make a
reappearance, he began to fidget. Twenty minutes had gone when his prey came
out, talking in low tones to the manager, and Templar thought that the manager
looked across at him with a certain significance. He felt hot, wiped his neck
with his handkerchief, and rose to his feet with a self-conscious cough, and
stalked back to his room with the self-conscious carriage of one wholly
disinterested in Somerville's existence.</p>

  <p>Disjointedly and with unusual heat he retailed the particulars of his
meeting to the silent woman. He was badly rattled; was impelled three times to
the bottle of whisky he kept in his trunk, and rendered all the more irritable
by her unresponsive attitude.</p>

  <p>"Well, say something," he snapped at last. "What's he after? What's his
game? He never treated me like that before. Is he short of money?"</p>

  <p>She looked him straight in the face.</p>

  <p>"Joe," she said, "do you want my advice?"</p>

  <p>"If it's the kind of advice I want," he said, biting savagely at the end
of his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll leave Caux at once," she said. "I don't know much about
Preston&mdash;I didn't live long enough with him to discover all his little
ways. But he's cleverer than ten devils if he's put to it. And it's not like
him to lose his temper."</p>

  <p>She sat a moment with pursed lips, then rose jerkily.</p>

  <p>"I'm going," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're going! Where are you going? You're not going anywhere," he said
sharply, and she swung round on him.</p>

  <p>"Don't try any of that rough stuff with me, Joe," she said. "I'm going
back to Paris by the night train. You can stay and get what you like, but I'm
through with this. The Lord didn't give me the equipment of a blackmailer, and
I don't think He gave it to you either," she said. "I know what has put you up
in the air; his talk about Dartmoor!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Templar testified to the shrewdness of her guess with that nervous
little blink of his.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea if you went," he said, after a while.
"Anyway, there's no need for you to stay. But, by thunder, if he tries any of
his funny business with me...!" He drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>He saw her off that night by the last train down the mountain, a greatly
relieved woman; their farewells were unemotional. Then he went back to his room
and slept, and his sleep was interrupted by bad dreams.</p>

  <p>In the morning a further happening disturbed him not a little. He had
taken his breakfast in his room, and had spent an hour reading the newspapers
on the stoep. On his return to his room he found that the valet had unpacked
and had brushed and hung his clothes; but, what was more disturbing, had taken
from the bottom of his valise the somewhat theatrical revolver which Templar
carried with him, and had laid it on the dressing-table. It was an excellent
weapon, despite its silver plating and mother-of-pearl butt.</p>

  <p>"Who told you to unpack my grip?" demanded Templar angrily.</p>

  <p>The astonished valet raised his shoulders to the level of his ears and
smiled.</p>

  <p>"I thought monsieur desired. It is usual," he said.</p>

  <p>"I gave strict orders that my bag was not to be touched! I told you
myself!" roared Templar. "I'll complain to the manager and have you fired, damn
you!"</p>

  <p>What could a well-meaning valet do but raise his shoulders again to the
level of his ears and smile even more despairingly before he melted from the
aggrieved presence.</p>

  <p>Templar took up the revolver and examined it. He would want that, at any
rate. If this fellow tried any monkey tricks (Templar's vocabulary was a
limited one), he would show him! He searched in his bag, took out a little
packet of cartridges, loaded the weapon, and slipped it in his hip pocket. The
weight of it gave him no little comfort. The sense of its possession added to
the sum of his confidence, and he needed all the confidence he could muster.
There was something sinister and menacing in the name of that place, Gorge du
Chauderon, which made him shiver, though he was to find the journey thereto
prosaic enough. He went down to the Glion by train, and walked along the hill
road cut in the steep slope of the gorge. He found the little path without
difficulty, and slid and slipped down through a wilderness of larch and pine to
the rocky valley bottom. He stopped to rest now and again, for he had plenty of
time. There was no sign of Somerville. He half expected to find him a fellow-
traveler along this tortuous descent. But Somerville had gone ahead, and was
sitting on a rock in a small clearing, in sight of the furious stream which
leapt and dashed on its impetuous journey to the lake.</p>

  <p>Somerville sat waiting in this drowsy spot, where the ceaseless "shish-
shish" of the mountain river drowned the ceaseless shrill of crickets. From
where he sat he could see the naked peak of Jarman and the scarred shoulder of
Rocher de Naye. He heard the hesitating footsteps of his enemy and rose to his
feet.</p>

  <p>Templar stopped dead on seeing him, all his suspicions and fears
revived.</p>

  <p>"Come along, man, what are you afraid of?" called Somerville, and the man
advanced with hesitant footsteps. He peered from left to right, seeking the
witness he always suspected was lurking somewhere within hearing; but the thin
vegetation hereabouts offered no cover, and he came closer.</p>

  <p>"Sit down on that rock, Templar," said Somerville. "Let's talk."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any talking," bullied the man. "I haven't come here for
conversation&mdash;I've come&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I have," said Somerville. "I'm going to tell you something."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"'I'm going to tell you this," resumed Somerville. "You're at the end of
your tether, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that's it?" Again he looked round. "You think you've caught me,
do you?"</p>

  <p>"I have not only caught you," said Somerville evenly, "but I am going to
kill you."</p>

  <p>Templar leapt up, and in his hand glittered and flashed the weapon he had
jerked from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are, are you?" he breathed. "Well, if it comes to killing,
Somerville&mdash;I guess two can play at that game. You try any of your monkey
tricks ..." He paused, at a loss for breath, and Somerville laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"Keep your gun," he mocked. "I hoped you would bring it. I repeat I am
going to kill you," he went on. "For a very long time, nearly seventeen years,
you have lain on my life like a horrible dream. You thought it was because I
feared for myself that I shrank from the disgrace which would attach to my
name. You now know, having made the discovery recently, that I was afraid
for&mdash;some one else."</p>

  <p>"Your daughter. I know all about that," interrupted Templar, who had
regained something of his nerve.</p>

  <p>"I only want you to realize just how I have suffered," said Somerville,
"so that, if a tardy sense of justice is awakened in you before you die, you
may have the comforting reflection that you deserved all that came to you."</p>

  <p>He walked slowly towards the other, and Templar leveled his pistol.</p>

  <p>"Don't come any nearer," he said hoarsely. "I'll shoot you like a
dog&mdash;by God I will!"</p>

  <p>"Shoot!"</p>

  <p>The contempt in the tone might have stung another man to desperate
action, but Templar cowered.</p>

  <p>"Shoot! You fool, whatever you do, you're doomed! Shoot! You haven't the
guts... your hand is shaking... ah!"</p>

  <p>Somerville, drawing nearer and nearer to the wobbling barrel, suddenly
launched himself at the man. One hand gripped the revolver and wrenched it from
Templar's grip, dropping it on the grass at his feet. The struggle which
followed was short. Preston Somerville, lean and lithe, was all muscle and
nerve&mdash;his opponent started the fight at this unfair advantage, that he
was wholly demoralized.</p>

  <p>For a second or two they swayed, Templar squirming and clawing, and then
he fell, grazing his cheek against the rough face of a boulder.</p>

  <p>Somerville stooped, turning him over, and noted the lacerated cheek with
a lift of eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," he said steadily. "Most excellent! If I had designed that
scratched face of yours, Templar, I could not have executed the deed more
neatly&mdash;get up!</p>

  <p>He had picked up the revolver and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>Templar rose shakily.</p>

  <p>"You'll suffer for this," he said in jerks.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, you will suffer&mdash;that is why you are here."</p>

  <p>A look of fear, blind, hysterical fear showed in the prominent eyes, and
Somerville smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to kill you&mdash;here," he said. "As a matter of fact, in
a few minutes you will be climbing that path again. I intend that you shall
spend the rest of your years in a Swiss prison, Templar&mdash;one of those
mountain prisons where men go through life seeing nothing but gray peaks and
white peaks until they die. Doing nothing but digging and quarrying until
somebody digs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Templar's voice was a squeak.</p>

  <p>"You can't do it! See! You try... you try!"</p>

  <p>Somerville nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am going to do it."</p>

  <p>He took the man's revolver from his pocket and laid it on the rock beside
him. Then he produced a thick pad of banknotes. Templar saw they were each for
a thousand francs. His next proceeding was more difficult to understand. With a
small pen-knife he made a little incision in his wrist. It was no more than a
scratch, and the blood bubbled slowly to view. He waited a second, then lifted
his revolver.</p>

  <p>"Come here!" he said sharply.</p>

  <p>Slowly the man obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Lay your finger-tip on that cut," he commanded.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?"</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>The reluctant Templar obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Now take that note&mdash;the top one."</p>

  <p>"Look here!" But the revolver barrel drove forward into the pit of his
stomach, and Templar clutched the note with his bloody fingers.</p>

  <p>"Give it to me," said Somerville, taking the money and examining it. "An
excellent impression. The chain is complete."</p>

  <p>Templar was breaking quickly.</p>

  <p>"What's the game, hey?" he fretted. "What's the idea of all this fooling?
You're not going to scare me, Somerville, take it from me! I've seen too much
of play-acting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The chain is complete!" Somerville's voice was harsh and joyous.
"Listen! Here are the links. First you quarrel with me this morning in the
presence of a waiter&mdash;that it happened to be I that started the quarrel is
immaterial. Next I inform the hotel manager that you are a bad character who
has demanded money from me."</p>

  <p>Templar's face was purple.</p>

  <p>"Next," said Somerville, "I instruct the valet&mdash;he attends me
also&mdash;to open your bag in order that he may identify your revolver. He
could never forget having seen the elegant weapon. Next I meet you alone here
in the Gorge du Chauderon&mdash;and next?"</p>

  <p>The truth was dawning on Templar&mdash;the hideous trap into which he had
fallen. He could only blink and swallow and swallow and blink.</p>

  <p>"Next," said Somerville slowly, "I am found dead here&mdash;your revolver
near by; your bloodstained finger-print on a banknote... the marks of a
struggle on your face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Templar screamed the words. "You'd never do it, Mr. Somerville!
For God's sake&mdash;you'd never do it... suicide...!"</p>

  <p>The torrent of his speech ran into a delta of sheer incoherence.</p>

  <p>"Suicide," said Somerville. "I've planned it all&mdash;step by step.
You've given me seventeen years to plan it, you dog... and you're going down
with me. They'll find my body here&mdash;I wrote to the police at Les Planches
to tell them I was meeting you and asking for protection. The letter will be
delivered this afternoon&mdash;I even worked out the time."</p>

  <p>He lifted the wad of banknotes and held them out.</p>

  <p>"Take these," he said. "Take them all save the one which must be found by
my side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a howl Templar struck at the extended hand, and the grass was strewn
with the scattered notes.</p>

  <p>Then he turned and fled up the path, sobbing like a frightened child. He
must reach the road&mdash;find a man&mdash;a witness, and return to the place
before... before... He must have a witness&mdash;somebody who had seen
Somerville alive...</p>

  <p>Half-way up the path he was stricken motionless.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The hills echoed and re-echoed at the pistol shot. He turned open-
mouthed, ashen, toward the sound. He was paralyzed, could only mouth
incomprehensible noises of woe. He could descend and recover the note. Face
that? With a wail he turned and fled up the side of the hill, stumbling out
into the roadway almost under the wheels of an empty fiacre.</p>

  <p>The driver looked at the dishevelled figure wonderingly. As for Templar,
he could only outstare the coachman, who had pulled his horse to a halt.</p>

  <p>What suspicion was in this peasant's mind? Templar pulled himself
together with a superhuman effort, and pushed back the hair from his streaming
forehead.</p>

  <p>"Glion&mdash;Gare!" he muttered, and stumbled into the victoria.</p>

  <p>He would get down to Territet, he thought. The funicular left every ten
minutes. After Territet? There was the lake or the rail. He could get to
Italy&mdash;seven hours' run, but he'd have to wait until the morning for a
train. Or to Lausanne, or That was the scheme! By boat to Evian! Evian was in
France, and an hour's journey across the lake.</p>

  <p>He took courage at the thought.</p>

  <p>He paid the <i>cocher</i>, and the man looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"M'sieu has injured himself? See, there is blood on M'sieu's fingers."</p>

  <p>Templar remembered and cursed. He offered no explanation, walked straight
to the ticket office, and secured his billet. The car waited, and he fumed. Why
were they waiting? The answer came when the sky-blue train from Montreux
clanked into the station. Two men got out, and Templar bit his lip to stop the
cry which he could arrest in no other way. They were Swiss gendarmes. Of
course! The police office was at Les Planches, half-way between Montreux and
Glion. He would like to have crouched down in the high pew-like compartment out
of sight, but he braced himself to sit stock still.</p>

  <p>The policeman spoke to the <i>chef de gate</i>, then walked briskly from
the station and turned on to the road. A bell tinkled, and Templar could have
wept his relief as his car dropped slowly on its steep run to Territet.</p>

  <p>He had a quarter of an hour to wait for a boat to Lausanne. No steamer
ran direct to the French ports from this end of the lake, and at Ouchy he
discovered that the last boat for Evian had already gone.</p>

  <p>It was getting late now, so he went up to Lausanne and snatched a hasty
meal. The way out was by rail. Valorbe was only a few miles, and he discovered
that a mixed train ran to Pontarlier at eleven o'clock&mdash;and Pontarlier was
France. He took his ticket and went into a gloomy waiting-room, and, choosing
the gloomiest corner, sat down to wait.</p>

  <p>He spoke and understood French, and all that evening in the cafe and in
the crowds which flocked the quais of Lausanne Station he had listened intently
for some word of the crime&mdash;his crime! The one crime of all crimes which
he had not committed and was incapable of committing.</p>

  <p>But he had heard no word.... The Swiss police kept these things quiet.</p>

  <p>Prison... years and years... all his life... they did not execute for
murder in Switzerland.</p>

  <p>He shook his head violently.</p>

  <p>"No... no prison for me."</p>

  <p>From outside the waiting-room a man watched him through the window. It
was rather difficult to see Templar, because he had chosen his corner well, but
the watcher identified him and walked back along the platform to the entrance,
where two policemen were standing.</p>

  <p>"The man is in the waiting-room," he said in French, "in the corner
nearest the clock. Do not forget his name is Templar."</p>

  <p>"You accuse him of having stolen your bag?" said one of the policemen.</p>

  <p>The man nodded, and the policeman moved off. Templar heard the door open,
and sat bolt upright at the sight of the uniforms.</p>

  <p>"M'sieu Templar?" said one of the policemen.</p>

  <p>Templar nodded.</p>

  <p>"I arrest you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Templar had taken the little phial from his right-hand waistcoat pocket,
and had swallowed its contents at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"Prison....? No prison for me..."he said thickly. "Blackmail, yes... but
not murder... not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They caught him as he fell, and one went to look for the man who had
charged him.</p>

  <p>But Somerville had disappeared from the tragedy he had staged.</p>

  <p>An hour later he was speeding back to Montreux in a fast motor-launch. On
the way he dropped overboard the silver-plated revolver which he had fired into
the air that afternoon.</p>

  <p>It was a bad day for the man Templar, when an inquisitive detective had
discovered that he was in the habit of carrying cyanide in his right-hand
waistcoat pocket.</p>
