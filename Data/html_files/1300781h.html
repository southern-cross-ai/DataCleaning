<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>IN THE TILT-YARD</h3>
<p>King James, fully recovered from the terrible fright occasioned
him by the Gunpowder Plot, had returned to his norm of
pusillanimity. Guy Fawkes, unbroken in spirit, however broken in
body by torture, had expiated on the gallows in Paul's Yard the
attempt&mdash;in his own bold words&mdash;to blow the Scots beggars
back to their mountains.</p>
<p>The beggars remained and profited by the distribution amongst
them of the acres and possessions of the conspirators, most of whom
were gentlemen of substance.</p>
<p>For the King, too, the matter had not been without ultimate
profit, of a more spiritual kind. It had enabled him by an exercise
of the arts of kingcraft&mdash;a term signifying little more than
the shameless use of falsehood and dissimulation&mdash;to parade
before the world the divine inspiration vouchsafed to monarchs. It
was, he pretended, the acuteness with which kings are
supernaturally endowed which had enabled him to enucleate from
obscurest utterances the true aim and nature of the plot, and thus,
almost miraculously, to avert a national catastrophe.</p>
<p>Some material profit, too, was to be extracted from it, in the
course of a further display of the spiritual graces and
accomplishments of this astounding prince. He was enabled to argue,
cogently enough, that people themselves so intolerant as the
Papists, on whose behalf it had been sought to blow him and his
Parliament into a better world, deserved no toleration; that the
Scarlet Woman on her seven hills propounded, indeed, the mystery of
iniquity. Hence he was justified in proceeding against Papists and
at the same time against Puritans&mdash;so as to be perfectly
consistent in his exclusive upholding of the Established
Church&mdash;by means of heavy fines and confiscations. Thus he
replenished his sadly depleted treasury and was enabled further to
relieve the necessities of those Scots beggars&mdash;and some
English ones, too&mdash;who clustered about him.</p>
<p>It did not trouble his elastic royal conscience that the plot of
a few desperate men, for which he now punished an entire community,
was directly sprung from his own bad faith in an earlier exercise
of his art of kingcraft. Readily enough had he promised toleration
alike to the co-religionaries of his mother and to the Puritans,
when they had approached him on the subject in Scotland in the days
of his own anxieties touching his succession to the throne of
England. They were foolish to have trusted him. They should have
perceived that a man who would not raise a finger to save his own
mother from the block, lest by doing so he should jeopardise his
inheritance of the English crown, would never scruple about a false
promise or two that would help to ensure the unanimity of all
classes of Englishmen in his favour. By breaking faith when he
discovered that the Episcopalian religion, which made him head of
the Church as well as of the State, was the only religion fit for
kings, he provoked not only the Gunpowder Plot, but that earlier
conspiracy in which Catholics and Puritans were united, the
strangest bedfellows adversity ever made.</p>
<p>All this, however, was now happily overpast. The heel of
authority was firmly planted on the neck of Papist and Puritan, and
their recusancy was being sweated out of them in the gold that was
so urgently required to maintain the prodigal splendours of the
court of this new kingdom of Great Britain. For now, in the year
1607 of the coming of Our Lord and fourth of the coming of King
James, his majesty was in dire straits for ready money.</p>
<p>Never before in the history of the country had there been, and
never since has there been, such reckless extravagance as that
which distinguished the descent of the Scots from their Northern
fastnesses in the train of a king who was a veritable beggar on
horseback.</p>
<p>Out of the stern and arid North he had come into the promised
land of plenty, a land that flowed, and flowed richly, with milk
and honey at his command. His commands, however, had been so free
and frequent that at last the springs were showing signs of
exhaustion. Fortunes lavished upon favourites by a prince who had
never learnt and never did learn the value of money were draining
the resources of the nation. Finding his hands, which hitherto had
been ever empty, to be suddenly filled with gold, he had scattered
it in almost childish recklessness, spending for the mere love of
spending, who in thirty-seven years of life had never had anything
to spend. Similarly, finding himself a free and uncontrolled fount
of honour, who hitherto had been overborne and brow-beaten by rude
nobles and ruder clerics, he spouted honours so freely that in the
first three months of his reign, apart from the new earls and
barons he created, he distributed no less than seven hundred
knighthoods, so that to be a knight became so common as to be
almost disreputable. There was no lack of point in the announcement
nailed by a satirist on the door of Saint Paul's, offering to train
weak memories in the titles of nobility.</p>
<p>When at last he began to feel himself hard-pressed for money, he
had summoned Parliament so that it might provide, only to make the
discovery, next in horror to the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot,
that the Commons, far from acknowledging his divinity, would
scarcely acknowledge his majesty. His own views and Parliament's on
the function of the Commons were found to be widely divergent. The
session resolved itself into a battle between absolutism and
constitutionalism; and it was in vain that, with the polemical
skill in which he took such pride, he argued that kings are in the
Word of God called gods, as being His lieutenants and vicegerents
on earth and therefore adorned and furnished with some sparks of
Divinity. The Commons, perceiving no spark of divinity in his
majesty's very human if excessive need of money, were so impudent
as to treat him as a man, and to vote him certain subsidies which
would not even pay the monstrous debts he had piled up.</p>
<p>If this annoyed him, it nowise served to curtail his
extravagance or the munificence in which he delighted, largely no
doubt because in its indulgence he gratified his desire to feel a
god. So he went his ways, junketing and banqueting in this land of
milk and honey, with revels and maskings, tournaments and
mummeries. He discovered that the exercise of hunting was not
merely pleasant in itself, but an absolute necessity to the
preservation of his health, whilst cock-fighting was so important a
relaxation to his mind, so that its vigour might subsequently be
renewed, that he paid the master of the cocks as much as any two
Secretaries of State. And for the rest, as Sir John Harrington
wrote from court, 'Now that the gunpowder fight is got out of our
heads, we are going on hereabouts as if the Devil was contriving
that every man should blow himself up by wild riot, excess, and
devastation of time and temperance.'</p>
<p>Being at heart a woman, his majesty loved to look upon fine men,
and he saw to it that those immediately about him were fine, not
only in person, but also in apparel and equipment, and he showered
upon them honours and riches at the expense of his new kingdom.
There was Philip Herbert, whom he had made Earl of Montgomery, the
handsome, oafish, rowdy, and unworthy brother of the splendid
Pembroke; there was Sir John Ramsay, whom he had created Viscount
Haddington, between whom and himself lay perhaps the truth of the
dark Gowrie business; there was the magnificent Sir James Hay, who
eventually became Earl of Carlisle, a courtier trained in France,
where he had served in the Scots Guards; and there was a host of
lesser handsome satellites, mostly Scots, who sunned themselves in
the royal favour, had their will of the weak prodigal king, and
preyed upon him much as light wanton women will prey upon a man who
delights in feminine companionship. His want of dignity in his
relations with his minions was as ludicrous as his excess of it in
his relations with the Commons.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a cloud of these lively, gorgeous fritillaries,
you behold him on a fair September morning in his pavilion in the
tilt-yard at Whitehall. There was to be riding at the ring and
there were to be other joustings of a mild order, in the nature of
pageants rather than of tourneys, so as to display fine
horsemanship and athletic beauty without danger to life or limb,
for his majesty did not relish shows that were too warlike.</p>
<p>Dazzling as Ph&oelig;bus himself rode forth the magnificent
James Hay in a doublet of cloth of gold, a short cloak of white
beaver trailing from his shoulders, a white-plumed white beaver hat
above his golden curls. He was attended, as became so magnificent a
paladin, by close upon a score of esquires, who again were followed
by as many pages in his cerulean livery, with his arms embroidered
on each breast. To be his shield-bearer Sir James had chosen the
handsomest of his esquires, a youth of twenty, who for beauty of
face and straight shapeliness of limb must draw the eye in any
assembly. He drew now the eyes of all in the ladies' gallery as he
rode forward alone in advance of the others, mounted on a
mettlesome white horse, to do his appointed office and present his
lord's escutcheon to the King.</p>
<p>The King rolled his big liquid eyes, and under the veil of his
thin sandy beard, the heavy lips of his loose mouth smiled
approval. His majesty loved good horses and admired good
horsemanship, an art he was never to master for himself, although
more than half his days were spent in the saddle. He was lost now
in admiring wonder of the superb mastery of the advancing
rider.</p>
<p>'Like a centaur. Ay, and a bonnie,' he muttered thickly in his
singsong Scots voice.</p>
<p>A final curvet at the very steps of the royal gallery, and the
horse was pulled up, so sharply that it almost sat down on its
haunches like a cat. Yet all would have been well with the horseman
if he had not already disengaged one foot from the stirrup
intending to complete his display by a leap to the ground which
should bring horse and man to a simultaneous standstill. The result
was that he lost his balance at the very moment of gathering
himself for his leap, and, cumbered as he was by the shield, he
came heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>Philip Herbert at the King's elbow advertised his inherent
boorishness by a loud guffaw.</p>
<p>'Your centaur's come in pieces, Sire.'</p>
<p>But the King never heard him, which was perhaps as well for him.
The royal eyes were upon the young man, who sprawled in a curiously
helpless attitude upon the dusty ground after an instant's aborted
effort to rise.</p>
<p>'God's sake!' the King muttered. 'The lad's hurt.' And he heaved
himself out of his crimson chair and stood forth, a man a little
above the middle height, whose thick ungainly body was carried upon
thin rachitic shanks. He had been suckled by a drunkard, and to
this it was attributed that he had not been able to stand until his
seventh year; nor did his legs thereafter ever grow to normal
strength.</p>
<p>Already esquires and pages were on foot and hastening to the
fallen young man's assistance, Sir James Hay, on horseback close at
hand, directing them. There was silence in the assembly of
spectators, all of whom had risen. In the ladies' gallery, the
Countess of Essex, a fair-headed child of fifteen of an
extraordinary loveliness, leaning forward, clutching the wooden
rail before her with a slim gloved hand, drew attention to herself
by the anxious note of her outcry and the insistence with which she
demanded to know the extent of the young man's hurt, which none yet
could tell her. Her mother, the Countess of Suffolk, that
ample-bosomed, sneering-mouthed, pock-marked woman, restrained her,
whilst smiling upon the tenderness of her solicitude for an unknown
youth.</p>
<p>Then the King became the centre of interest. Leaning heavily
upon Herbert's shoulder, he shambled down the steps. He bent over
the young man, who lay supine and helpless, his right leg at an odd
angle. This leg, they informed his majesty, was broken. A page had
already gone to summon bearers and a hand-litter.</p>
<p>'Poor lad! Poor lad!' mumbled the King on an almost maudlin
note. Small ills observed could singularly move this man to
tenderness, who could yet perpetrate great and bloody cruelties
which he was not called upon to witness.</p>
<p>The youth shifted his head upon the pillow it had found on the
knee of another esquire, and his fine eyes looked up in awe at
compassionate majesty. Though livid and drawn by pain, the beauty
of his face remained singularly arresting. Not more than twenty
years of age, he was still beardless, and only a little auburn
moustache shaded the shapely mouth, at once firm and sensuous. He
pushed back the tumbled red-gold hair from his moist brow and made
as if to speak, then checked, not knowing what might be required of
him by etiquette in such a case.</p>
<p>But the King had little thought for etiquette. Goggle-eyed he
considered this long slim lad, and he was so overcome at the
thought of so much physical perfection being perhaps permanently
marred that a tear rolled down his prematurely furrowed yet florid
cheek.</p>
<p>'Who is he? How's he called?' he gruffly questioned.</p>
<p>Sir James, who had dismounted, pushed forward, hat in hand, to
answer him.</p>
<p>'His name is Carr, may it please your majesty; Robert Carr of
Ferniehurst.'</p>
<p>'Carr o' Ferniehurst!' The King seemed taken aback. 'The son of
Tom Carr! God's sake!'</p>
<p>He bent lower to scan more closely the handsome man grown out of
one who some years ago had served him as a page in Edinburgh, but
who had been dismissed for his persistent bad Latin at grace, which
to the King had smacked of irreverence.</p>
<p>Young Carr's white mask of pain was irradiated by a smile to
behold himself remembered.</p>
<p>'God save your majesty,' he said in an accent even more broadly
Scots than the King's own.</p>
<p>'It's thyself needs saving now, lad,' the King mumbled. He stood
upright again and became brisk in the issuing of orders, and more
indistinct in speech than usual in this briskness.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr was to be conveyed no farther than Mr. Rider's house in
King Street, near at hand. Let word be sent ahead at once that a
room be prepared for him. At the royal nod one of his gentlemen
sped upon the errand, whilst another departed in quest of his
majesty's own physician. The repairs to the lad's leg were to be
carried out by the most skilful hands available, so as to ensure
that so lovely a body should suffer no permanent impairment.</p>
<p>Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery, holding premier place among
the favourites, looked down his handsome nose in disdain. Why did
his old dad and gossip, as he familiarly called his sovereign, make
all this bother about a raw Scots esquire of no account?</p>
<p>Dull fellow that Herbert was, he lacked the wit to perceive that
another of Guy Fawkes's beggars was come to court.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE RISING SUN</h3>
<p>Very soon it became apparent that the fall in which Mr. Robert
Carr had broken his leg had flung him headlong into the lap of
fortune.</p>
<p>The King had outstayed the show in the tilt-yard. So much he
owed to the gentlemen who were providing this entertainment. At its
conclusion, however, he had postponed his return to the palace, to
turn aside and visit Mr. Rider's house in King Street, so that he
might personally ascertain the exact extent of Mr. Carr's injuries.
He went attended by a group of gentlemen, among whom was Herbert,
very sulky now at what he accounted a fresh and excessive
manifestation of royal caprice.</p>
<p>At Mr. Rider's they found his majesty's physician, who relieved
anxieties which could hardly have been greater had the patient been
an old and valued friend.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr, his leg set, and now out of pain and moderately
comfortable, lay in a pleasant room whose latticed windows stood
open to the September sunshine and Mr. Rider's pleasant garden
behind the house. As the door opened, he turned his head with its
tumbled mane of red-gold hair, and from his pillow looked to see
who came.</p>
<p>It startled him to behold under the lintel the figure of the
King, loutish and ungainly despite rich saffron-coloured velvet and
gleam of jewels. The corpulence to which his majesty's body already
tended was aggravated in appearance by thickly bombasted breeches
and a doublet stuffed and quilted so as to render it dagger-proof
and thus quiet his congenital timorousness and abiding dread of
cold steel. This affliction of physical fear under which he was to
labour all his days was perhaps to be traced back to that night in
Holyrood, two months before his birth, when Rizzio was brutally
stabbed to death at his mother's feet.</p>
<p>He stood now upon that threshold, rolling his big wistful eyes
in a face whose lines bore the imprint of an age considerably
beyond his forty years. In repose his countenance ever wore that
vacant quality of melancholy that is to be seen in the brute
creation. And it reflected, no doubt accurately, a soul which was
not to be beguiled from its fundamental sadness and loneliness
either by the free indulgence of the man's egregious vanity or the
liberal pursuit of sensuous satisfactions.</p>
<p>Closely followed by the physician, who had met him in the outer
room, he shambled forward to the trundle-bed, leaving his gentlemen
on the threshold. He came, he announced, no more than to inquire of
Mr. Carr, himself, how he did.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr, flushing deeply, between awe and gratification of an
honour so far in excess of his poor deserts, answered in his broad
Northern accent that he did very well, which immediately opened the
door to the King's ever-ready and usually trivial
facetiousness.</p>
<p>'Ud's death!' He spoke thickly and indistinctly, his tongue
being too thick for his mouth. In theory he condemned all
blasphemy, and, indeed, had written a treatise upon the evils of
it; in practice he seldom sought vehemence of expression without
having recourse to its emphatic aid. 'If you account yourself very
well with a broken leg what'll ye deem yourself when it's whole
again?'</p>
<p>The courtiers in the background offered the murmur of laughter
that was expected. But Mr. Carr did not even smile.</p>
<p>'Your majesty's gracious concern had been cheaply bought at the
price of both legs broken.'</p>
<p>If his accent was uncouth to English ears, his matter at least
left little to be desired in courtliness. The King pulled at his
thin tuft of sandy beard and smiled, nodding his head in
approval.</p>
<p>'Say you so? Faith, it's a graceful enough answer. Ye'll have
been in France, I doubt, with Sir James.'</p>
<p>Mr. Carr confessed it. He had spent two years at court
there.</p>
<p>'And ye'll have learnt among those leeching loons to cast French
capriolles of speech. Nay, never look downcast. I bear no rancour
for civilities even when they're but clavering.'</p>
<p>The handsome young face flushed again, and the bright eyes slid
away abashed under the benevolent gaze of royalty.</p>
<p>Not until the King had left him, which followed presently, did
the possible significance of that visit begin to break upon the
dazzled wits of Mr. Carr. Not until the visit was repeated on the
following morning, and again on the morning after that, did Mr.
Carr permit himself to believe that which until then appeared
almost too daring a suspicion. When three mornings later he was
waited upon by a Gentleman of the Household accompanied by a page
bearing a basket of such rare exotic fruits as peaches and musk
melons, sent by the King from the royal table, certainty was piled
on certainty. Moreover, the bearer of these gifts, a very splendid
Scots gentleman who named himself to Mr. Carr as Sir Alan
Ochiltree, was very civil, very solicitous on the score of Mr.
Carr's hurt and health, and very ready to profess himself at Mr.
Carr's orders and eager to serve him.</p>
<p>The sudden change of fortune which all this seemed to presage
for the penniless young Scot bewildered him. It had happened so
abruptly, had been so utterly the fruit of chance, and was so far
beyond any calculation he would have dared embark upon, that,
despite the abundance of the confirmation and whilst already
believing, he yet hesitated to believe. It lent truth to the
courtly speech he had used to the King, for it was true enough that
to penetrate so far into the royal esteem he would willingly have
suffered both his legs to have been broken.</p>
<p>The King's visits continued daily, and daily became more
protracted. Soon there was scarcely an hour of the day but some
great gentleman or other, eager to follow his majesty's example,
came to wait upon Mr. Carr to inquire into his state of health. By
the end of the week, the outer room of the house in King Street
might have been mistaken from the quality of its tenants for one of
the antechambers of the Palace of Whitehall.</p>
<p>Sir James Hay, who whilst Mr. Carr was in his service had paid
but indifferent attention to him, was now a daily visitor, and of
such assiduity that the erstwhile patron seemed almost to have
become the suitor. Even my Lord of Montgomery did not disdain to
court the favour of the young Scot, and then one day, as if to set
a climax upon all, the Lord Chamberlain, the great Earl of Suffolk,
came in person to wait upon Mr. Carr and to overwhelm him with
civilities.</p>
<p>He had heard of Mr. Carr, he announced, and of Mr. Carr's
unfortunate accident from his daughter, Lady Essex, who had been a
distressed witness of the event and had spoken of it daily since.
Mr. Carr, although he had never heard of the lady, was deeply
flattered to have drawn upon himself the eyes and thoughts of such
exalted nobility. Her ladyship, my lord continued, had, in common
with his own countess, been moved to deep concern on Mr. Carr's
behalf, and it was in the hope of being able to allay their
anxieties that his lordship now sought news of the invalid in
person.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr thanked him becomingly. After all, the young Scot was
well bred, he had profited by his courtly experience in France, and
gathering now confidence and self-assurance rapidly from the
consequence with which he found himself treated, he put forth an
easy charm of manner of the kind that rarely fails to win friends
for a man.</p>
<p>My Lord of Suffolk was relieved. At least this youth, of whom
men spoke already as the new favourite, was no rowdy overbearing
oaf like so many of the royal pets, like, for instance, Montgomery,
with whom his lordship almost collided as he issued from Mr. Carr's
chamber.</p>
<p>Montgomery came in boisterously. 'What brings the old sea-fox to
your bedside?' For all that his lordship was not yet out of the
house, young Herbert made no attempt to subdue his vibrant voice.
That was the rude way of him: reckless ever of what offence he
gave.</p>
<p>The demureness of Mr. Carr's reply seemed almost a reproof. 'No
more than the desire to be civil.'</p>
<p>'Which is when most he is to be mistrusted, like all the
Howards: a greedy, self-seeking pack made up of wolves and foxes;
and he the worst of them. Beware of Howards! Avoid their embraces
as ye would the Devil's. There's as much profit to a man in the one
as in the other.'</p>
<p>Mr. Carr made no answer beyond a pensive smile. A book was
closed upon his forefinger to mark the place where he had been
reading before the coming of the Lord Chamberlain had interrupted
him. He smiled to think how fully he was already accounted of the
court that his choice of a party was being guided for him, if,
indeed, his suffrages were not being sought.</p>
<p>Anon came the King in a blue velvet doublet which he had
buttoned awry, thereby increasing the ungainliness of his
appearance. It was stained, too, with gravy like all his suits, for
clumsy and untidy in all things, he was in nothing more so than in
his eating, unless it was in his drinking. To behold him at table
was to understand why the impudent Buckingham at a much later date
entitled him 'his sowship.'</p>
<p>The King drove out Montgomery and took the chair at the head of
the bed, as was now his daily custom. He mumbled inquiries as to
how his dear lad fared and what the physician had to report upon
his progress, then asked him what he read. Mr. Carr held up the
book, and smiled. The King smiled too; he put back his head a
little with a certain jauntiness and his eyes gleamed pride. For
the volume was a copy of the 'Basilicon Doron,' that monument of
pedantry which his majesty, like a new Machiavel, had produced some
years ago for the instruction of the Prince his son. Mr. Rider, an
experienced courtier, had, in Mr. Carr's own interest, procured him
the copy.</p>
<p>The King grunted approvingly. 'So, so! Ye take the trouble to
become acquainted with the best parts of me.'</p>
<p>He desired to have Mr. Carr's opinion of the book. Mr. Carr
considered that it would be a presumption for one so rudely tutored
as himself to utter an opinion of a work so scholarly and
profound.</p>
<p>'Ye're none so rudely tutored after all, since ye perceive the
scholarliness and profundity.' Squirming with satisfaction he
pressed Mr. Carr to tell him what part he had liked best.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr, who had found the work of an intolerable, soporific
tedium, and could remember of it only that which he had last read,
spoke of necessity to this. In all this monument of erudition, said
he, written it was clear by one who was at once a philosopher and a
theologian, he would venture to select for his preference the part
that dealt with marriage.</p>
<p>The King's satisfaction seemed diminished. He knew how far in
this matter his own performance had fallen short of his precepts.
In public he could be almost uxorious. But in private there was
little in common nowadays between himself and Danish Anne, for all
that she had borne him seven children. At Denmark House in the
Strand she kept not only her own establishment apart from him, but
was assembling a court of her own; and it began to look as if she
would make of that court the foundations of a party in the State
that might yet come into conflict with the King's desires and
policies. Yet, since this troubled him less than the Queen's
constant company might have done, he was well content.</p>
<p>His majesty changed the subject. He talked of horses and
horsemanship, of dogs and hunting and falconry, matters these of a
gentleman's education in which Mr. Carr showed intelligent
knowledge. Then the talk shifted to Scotland and to the days when
young Robert Carr, by favour of Esm&eacute;, Duke of Lennox, who
had been his father's close friend, had entered the royal household
as a page. Laughing now, the King alluded to his annoyance at the
lad's incurable blundering over the Latin grace when it was his
duty to say it before meat, which had ultimately led to his
dismissal.</p>
<p>'No doubt ye'll have mended that lack of learning since?'</p>
<p>Mr. Carr in confusion confessed that he had neglected to do so.
His majesty was shocked into sudden incredulous gravity.</p>
<p>'A gentleman without Latin! Ud's death! It's worse than a woman
without chastity. For whereas to the latter Nature herself may at
times oppose obstacles, as it becomes us to remember lest we judge
too harshly of their frailty, to the former there is no natural
obstacle at all.'</p>
<p>Taking that for his text, he descanted at great length with a
wealth of recondite verbiage and classical allusion in one of those
vain displays of erudition in which this royal pedant delighted.
The end of it all was a declaration that he could not have Mr. Carr
about his person as he intended unless the shortcomings of the
young man's education were repaired. He loved to have about him, he
vowed, gentlemen of taste and learning, which did not explain the
favour he showed to Philip Herbert and some others whose taste and
learning did not go beyond the matter of dogs and horses.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr abased himself in regrets for the neglect he had
practised. It should be repaired without delay.</p>
<p>'I mean it so to be,' the King assured him. Himself he would be
the lad's preceptor. 'I care not,' he vowed, 'if I fling away as
much time as shall teach you. It might be less profitably wasted,
Robin.' He stroked the young man's cheek with a finger, which, if
thick, soft, and jewelled, was none too scrupulously clean.</p>
<p>Thereafter, daily, during the mending of his limb, Mr. Carr
struggled bravely with a Latin grammar, whose intricacies were
expounded to him by the royal pedagogue. It was a form of torture
to which he submitted with great fortitude, for the sake of all
that he now supposed to hang upon it. If he was conscious of his
own dullness, at least he was relieved from anxiety by the patience
of this King, who was born to play the schoolmaster, a patience
founded upon the satisfaction which his vanity derived from the
free display of his own learning.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr was still at declensions and conjugations when towards
the end of October the doctors at last permitted him to set foot to
the ground again, his leg now mended, and so soundly that its
shapely symmetry was nowise impaired.</p>
<p>King James was there to witness those first steps in
convalescence as gleefully as a fond father observing the first
steps of his own offspring, and he sharply commanded Philip Herbert
to lend the lad an arm for his support. My Lord of Montgomery
complied, however deeply it may have galled him to play the valet
to this young upstart. If he was rancorous, he did not suffer it to
be perceived, and this not even when, from being courted by those
who sought the royal favour, he found it prudent to do some
courting in his turn and join the ever-growing stream of those who
wooed Mr. Robert Carr.</p>
<p>The throng of gentlemen of birth and quality to be met in the
outer room of Mr. Rider's house in King Street, during the last two
or three weeks of Mr. Carr's confinement there, was but an earnest
of the crowds that were to assemble in Mr. Carr's own antechamber
at Whitehall when presently he was translated thither by the
infatuated monarch. Had the young Scot been acquainted with the
Arabian Nights he must have conceived that he lived in one of them,
befriended by some benevolent djin whose fiat had transmogrified
his world. Sumptuous quarters were allotted to him, indeed the best
that Whitehall, now fallen into a ramshackle state, could provide.
His lodging overlooked the privy gardens. It was a lodging that for
some years had been tenanted by Sir James Elphinstone, a gentleman
of great lineage and greater pride who had enjoyed the esteem of
the late Queen. Sir James, when ordered to vacate the premises,
went vehemently protesting to the Lord Chamberlain, who conveyed
the protest in more temperate terms to his majesty. His majesty
would listen to no pleas, enter into no discussions.</p>
<p>'I maun ha' it for Carr,' was all he said, and this with such
grim finality that my Lord of Suffolk went out backwards at once,
to inform Sir James that he must pack and quit.</p>
<p>By the King's orders these new quarters were extravagantly
refurnished to receive their new tenant. Rich hangings and rare
carpets were procured to adorn them, and when installed there Mr.
Carr found a regiment of grooms and pages to minister to him, who
hitherto had been his own body-servant and whose highest
consequence had been reached as another man's esquire. There were
tailors to provide a sumptuous wardrobe to replace the few
threadbare garments that he owned, pronounced by the King as fit
only for a peasebogle; and there were tiremen to array him in these
glories under the supervision of the King himself, who did not
disdain to display himself as much an arbiter of elegancies as he
was proud to boast himself a theologian and a poet. Jewellers from
Goldsmith's Row spread gaudy, glittering toys before young Robin,
of which the paternal monarch commanded him to make choice. Barbers
and hair-dressers combed and curled and scented his red-gold locks
and trimmed to a dagger-point the little auburn beard which he had
allowed to grow since his accident.</p>
<p>If the lad was allotted no preceptors, this was because the King
himself desired to continue in that office. He could trust no tutor
in England to give the boy's Latin that genuine Roman pronunciation
practised in Scotland, upon which his majesty prided himself not a
little. The wits accounted it a pity that his majesty was not
attracted by the same purity of diction where English was
concerned, both in his own case and that of his pupil.</p>
<p>In those wintry days, if Mr. Carr was not closeted with the King
at his studies, he was at table with him, or riding with him, or
lending him his arm when he went to give audience; for such a hold
had the young Scot's beauty of person and charm of manner taken
upon King James that he could no longer bear him out of his
sight.</p>
<p>By Christmas the name of the new favourite, who had outstripped
all rivals and perched himself on a pinnacle of eminence such as
none had ever yet scaled, was on the lips of every man and woman in
London. At Denmark House, where the Queen held her court under the
virtual leadership of the elegant accomplished Pembroke, much
frequented by the austere young Prince Henry, and where it was the
fashion to contemn the minions by whom King James surrounded
himself, lampoons were being freely written with Mr. Robert Carr
for their butt. Whilst naturally enough there were many to sneer at
the sudden exaltation of this penniless Scots nobody, and many
envious ones at court who hopefully predicted that the upstart's
fall would follow soon and prove sharper even than his rise, yet
all who came in contact with him succumbed to the charm of his
engaging personality. Even amongst those who came jaundiced by
jealousy, there were some whom he converted at the first meeting by
his frank boyishness and the modesty with which he bore himself in
circumstances which must soon have begotten arrogance in a nature
less finely tempered. His breeding saved him there. For let men
sneer at him as they would for an upstart, the fact remained that,
if poor, he was gently born and of courtly rearing, to which his
graceful easy carriage bore constant witness, despite the
uncouthness of his Northern speech. His good looks, youthful
eagerness, and the bright joyousness that flowed from him, making
him a creature of warmth and sunshine, brought men easily to
understand and even to approve the royal infatuation.</p>
<p>His success remained still in his own eyes an unreal
dream-business from which he might at any moment awaken to his
former precarious estate. It continued so even when one day he
found Sir James Hay, his former patron, actually inviting his
suffrages.</p>
<p>Sir James, whose ambitions were pre&euml;minently ambassadorial,
desired to be appointed envoy to the court of France. He had taken
advantage of the fact that the King used him intimately to solicit
the office, and he now begged of Carr that he would endorse the
request for him. Mr. Carr almost gasped. If anything could make him
realise to the full the change in his fortunes which a few months
had wrought, this should do it.</p>
<p>He bowed very gravely, almost pale as he answered: 'Sir James,
it is not for you to beg anything of me; but to command me. You may
count upon me in this. I will speak to his majesty to-day, since
you require it; though if you are granted the office, you will owe
it rather to your own deserts and influence than to any poor word
of mine.'</p>
<p>Sir James had stared a moment; indeed, he had looked hard to see
if he was not perhaps being mocked, so unusual was such a tone as
this in a favourite. But perceiving the lad's earnest sincerity, he
had bowed in his turn.</p>
<p>'Sir,' he said, smiling, 'you make me proud to have been your
friend.'</p>
<p>As in this, so in all. Mr. Carr's purse, which the doting
monarch kept well supplied, was ever in those days at the disposal
of the needy whom he could not succour otherwise, and that he was
free from the venality which others in his place have seldom failed
to manifest, he gave early proof. Wooed by a place-seeker for a
post in the customs, who came to him recommended by no less a
person than the Attorney-General, he lent the usual ready ear to
the man's representations of his worth and fitness for the office.
He promised readily to lay the petition before his majesty.
Thereupon the man, instructed perhaps by Mr. Attorney himself in
the place-seeker's sure way to a favourable patronage, made it
plain that he did not ask to be served for worth alone and that
upon his receiving the appointment there would be three hundred
pounds for Mr. Carr.</p>
<p>The young man stiffened and changed colour. A moment he paused,
his clear eyes hard as they measured this presumptuous
trafficker.</p>
<p>'Wait upon me again to-morrow, and you shall ken his majesty's
pleasure in the matter.' Coldly he inclined his head, and passed on
to the next suitor.</p>
<p>But there was no coldness in his manner when anon he came to
tell the King of this insult. The King's cackling laugh cropped his
indignation in full flow.</p>
<p>'God's sake! If my faithful Commons would but insult me in such
like manner I'd greet for joy.'</p>
<p>Mr. Carr looked askance at him, which increased his mirth.</p>
<p>'Did ye discern,' quoth the King, 'if the carle had qualities to
fit him for the office?'</p>
<p>'He boasted of them; and there was a letter from Mr. Attorney to
assert it. But ...'</p>
<p>'Why, then he'll serve as well as another, and it's not every
suitor for the place will be as ready to part with so much silver.
A God's name, take his three hundred, give him the office, and bid
him go to the devil. Customs, is it? Tell him his own customs
commend him finely.'</p>
<p>His majesty laughed over the matter at the moment. But anon,
when once more alone, he became serious on a belated thought that
suddenly assailed him. Robert Carr was honest! It was a startling
quality to discover in a courtier. The fellow was a prodigy. To
have singled him out for trust and favour was an instance of the
acuteness of his royal wits in selecting servants. It confirmed him
in the belief that he could read a man's worth at a glance. King
James was pleased with himself, and therefore the more pleased with
Carr who had made him so. At last amongst all these self-seeking
flatterers, these leeching carles, who fawned upon him for their
own profit and who were ready to sell him whenever occasion
offered, he had found an honest man; one who had desired nothing of
him and was so little disposed to take advantage of his favour that
he denounced the first suitor who had sought to bribe him.</p>
<p>This was a man to grapple to him with hoops of steel, to lean
upon and to trust.</p>
<p>Decidedly Robin must make better progress in Latinity.</p>
<p>The highest destinies awaited him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THOMAS OVERBURY</h3>
<p>Mr. Thomas Overbury, gentleman, scholar, and poet, sometime
gentleman-commoner of Queen's College, Oxford, where he had taken a
degree in arts, and law student of the Middle Temple, was homing
from foreign wanderings. Enriched in worldly experience, but in no
other gear, he was lured back to England by the hope of finding
employment worthy of his undoubted talents and exceptional
accomplishments.</p>
<p>Whilst not himself a Scot&mdash;he was the son of a
Gloucestershire squire and bencher of the Middle Temple, who in the
old days had enjoyed the patronage of Sir Robert Cecil&mdash;he had
several high-placed Scottish friends, made during a visit to
Edinburgh three years before the old Queen's death. On his return
from that visit, Mr. Overbury had been charged with a delicate
mission from the King of Scots to Elizabeth's Secretary of State,
which he had fulfilled zealously, discreetly, and intelligently.
Sir Robert Cecil thereafter had employed him for a while, hoping
much from a man of his attainments. But Overbury's restlessness and
desire to widen his knowledge of the world had sent him upon those
foreign wanderings.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury's ambitions were not immodest, and he hoped by the
aid of some of his possible patrons to gratify them in securing
some appointment about the court, in which he might stay his own
necessities with anything that the Scottish locusts might have
spared.</p>
<p>He put up at the Angel in Cheapside, a house of indifferent
comfort but modest charges, attuned to the modest means at his
command, and thence reconnoitred the position he intended to
attack. In this his patience was not greatly taxed. The landlord of
the Angel was garrulous as all his kind, and perceiving in certain
details of gear and manner that this guest was newly landed from
foreign parts, accounted him a suitable victim. Again after the
fashion of his kind, his talk was chiefly of the doings of the
great world, the events at court and the minuti&aelig; of courtly
life. True, he began his discourse with a lament on the subject of
the plague, the ravages it had wrought in the city in the year of
his gracious majesty's accession, and the wise measures by which
the city fathers had at last stamped it out. Thence at a stride he
reached Whitehall and its gay doings, and drew a parallel, which he
intended should be flattering to King James, between the present
court and that of the old Queen, which in the later years of her
reign had been what the Scots would have called dour. But there was
no dourness he vowed about King James. That was a man after the
heart of any honest vintner, a great trencherman and a prodigious
drinker of strong wine.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury rose from his breakfast of salt herrings and
Scottish ale, a tall wiry gentleman of a deceptive slenderness that
lent him an appearance almost of delicacy. His pale saturnine face
was long and narrow, with a good nose and chin, a lofty brow about
which the brown hair clustered crisply, and full eyes, wide-set and
observant, whose keenness he had a trick of dissembling by a sleepy
droop of the lids. The comely whole was saved from asceticism by
the red fullness of his lips. By the discerning he was to be read
at a glance as a man strong in all things: strong in his passions
and desires, and as strong in his power to curb them. In his
carriage there was an indefinable aloofness, a stateliness that
offered barriers to presumption; in his movements and gestures, in
the way he turned his head and used his hands, there was a grace
that was inherent. He was in his twenty-eighth year, but he looked
older, having lived hard, and worked hard in lucubrations from his
Oxford days. He had immolated his youth on the altar of ambition,
and, ignoring the lures which life offers to the young, he had
laboured at equipping mind and spirit with the scholarly knowledge
which he regarded as the necessary weapons of one who looks to
prevail by his wits alone.</p>
<p>He rose, then, from his salt herrings and Scottish ale, and
looked down his aquiline nose at the vintner.</p>
<p>'You tell me, sirrah, that King James is a drunkard and a
glutton.'</p>
<p>The landlord's fat body quivered like a jelly, being shaken by a
sudden gust of terrified indignation.</p>
<p>'Sir, sir! Here's wanton twisting of my words!'</p>
<p>'Your words? I heard no words from you touching the King save in
commendation of his vast appetite and unquenchable thirst. These
may be goodly virtues in a vintner's eyes, but in plain terms they
are no better than I've named them. Nay, never sweat, man. I am no
spy of Cecil's as you may be supposing now; neither am I in the pay
of Spain as you may have supposed before.'</p>
<p>The man quailed before that lofty, almost contemptuous
manner.</p>
<p>'Your worship,' he faltered, 'the very words I used were
scarcely my own. They were the talk of almost every man in the city
since the banquet at the Guildhall, offered by the Lord Mayor to
his gracious majesty.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury sneered. 'Faith! It may be worthy of you city
hucksters to ask a gentleman to dinner, and then weigh the food he
eats, measure the wine he drinks.' Abruptly he dropped the subject.
'When was this banquet?'</p>
<p>'A week ago, worshipful sir. You might have seen the procession
from these windows: as brave a show as the city's seen for many a
day; the velvets and satins and the jewels and the housings of the
horses. There was the King's grace on a white palfrey, and there
was Sir James Hay in cloth of gold, and my Lord of Montgomery, and
my Lord Chamberlain, and&mdash;bravest of them all&mdash;there was
Sir Robert Carr riding at the King's right hand, with a smile for
everybody, and ...'</p>
<p>'Whom did you name?' So sharp was the tone of Mr. Overbury's
interjection, so taut on a sudden was his tall, slim figure, that
the vintner checked at the very beginning of the catalogue he was
proposing to rehearse.</p>
<p>'Sir Robert Carr I said, worshipful sir: the new favourite on
whom they say his majesty dotes as on a son. And, faith, no man who
sees the gentleman could grudge him his good fortune. A
frank-faced, winsome, golden-headed lad, with as honest a blue eye
and as merry a laugh as ever you saw.'</p>
<p>The vintner rambled on in eulogies. But Mr. Overbury was not
listening. His breath had quickened a little; there was even a stir
of colour in his pale cheeks. Presently he interrupted again, to
ejaculate the single word: 'Impossible!'</p>
<p>The vintner checked to stare at him.</p>
<p>'Impossible does your worship say? But I assure you, sir, that I
tell you no more than ...'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury waved him contemptuously into silence. 'I answered
my own thoughts, master landlord, not any words of yours. This
Robert Carr, whence is he, do you know?'</p>
<p>'Why, from Scotland, to be sure.'</p>
<p>'From Scotland, ay: whence else with such a name? But from where
in Scotland? Do you happen to have heard?'</p>
<p>'Why, yes. I've heard tell.' He scratched his bald pate to
stimulate recollection. 'They do name him Sir Robert Carr of
Fernieside, or Furniebank, or Fernie-something.'</p>
<p>'Would it be Ferniehurst?' There was a faint excitement now in
the calm gentleman's tone.</p>
<p>The vintner smacked fist into palm. 'Ferniehurst it is. That's
it. You have it, sir. Ferniehurst it is.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury startled him by such a burst of laughter as you
would never have expected from a man of his countenance.</p>
<p>'Robin Carr o' Ferniehurst! And the King's favourite? Come,
landlord, tell me more of this.' He sat down again. 'Tell me all
you know.'</p>
<p>Readily enough the vintner rehearsed for him the town talk on
the subject. The sum of it was that whoever had a suit to prefer at
court should prefer it nowadays, not to my Lord Chamberlain as
heretofore, nor to my Lord Treasurer or my Lord Montgomery,
powerful though they both were, but to Sir Robert Carr, whose
influence with the King was the weightiest of all.</p>
<p>To Mr. Overbury this news was fantastic. Robert Carr, the
stripling with whom he had been acquainted, in Edinburgh, had in
those days sat at his feet and offered a brotherly love to the
older man, who, although then but two and twenty, had seemed of a
full maturity to the boy of fifteen. And mature Overbury had been
even then; a scholar, a lawyer, and with the airs already of an
accomplished man of the world, or at least so they appeared to the
raw Scots lad. That he should have taken notice of this boy, and
treated him in every sense as an equal had transmuted into worship
the awe and wonder with which Robin had at first regarded him. This
Robin had been a sweet lovable lad, as Mr. Overbury remembered him.
What changes, he wondered, had been wrought by the six years that
were sped? How would Robin regard now the man whom once he had
esteemed so highly? In those days he had been constrained to look
up at Mr. Overbury; now, from the eminence to which a turn of
Fortune's wheel had hoisted him, he would of course look down, and
his perspective would of necessity be different.</p>
<p>Speculation Mr. Overbury realised was idle. His course lay in
ascertaining.</p>
<p>He spread out the meagre contents of his saddlebags, and
selected, without difficulty where the choice was so restricted, a
suit of dark purple velvet which had already seen much service. He
brushed it carefully, and arrayed himself. Jewels he had none
wherewith to set it off; not so much as a gold chain. But the
collar of fine Mechlin, which in France was already superseding the
starched ruff, lent him a certain modishness, and his fine figure,
graceful carriage, and air of assurance must do the rest.</p>
<p>He sallied forth into the noisy street and the gusty airs of
that March morning, and made his way to Paul's. Here he found a
place in one of the new hackney-coaches that drove to Westminster,
carrying four for a shilling. His companions were a merchant bound
for the court and two gentlemen from the country on a sight-seeing
visit to the capital, all of whom he chilled by his aloofness.</p>
<p>Set down at Charing Cross, he proceeded on foot along Whitehall,
past the bourne posts and into the broader space set off by gilt
railings and dominated by the imposing tessellated gateway which
Holbein had built for Henry VIII.</p>
<p>After that he was for some time tossed like a tennis-ball, as it
seemed to him, from yeomen of the guard to lackeys, and from
lackeys to ushers, and had he not in one of the galleries by great
good fortune come upon the new Earl of Salisbury, it is odds that
he would have had all his pains for nothing.</p>
<p>A gentleman usher armed with a wand had ordered him none too
courteously to make way, and as he stepped obediently aside and
half-turned to face the little limping gentleman who with two
attendants following him was bustling to audience, he found himself
confronting the first Secretary of State.</p>
<p>The little gentleman's keen eyes returned his glance. The little
gentleman checked in his stride, and named him in accents of
surprise.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury was justified of his faith in Sir Robert Cecil's
memory.</p>
<p>In answer to my lord's swift probing questions, Mr. Overbury
rendered a brief account of himself. He had arrived but yesterday,
and was intending to wait upon his lordship to-morrow.</p>
<p>'And why not to-day?'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury offered a truthful explanation. The handsome,
sensitive face of the deformed, splay-footed little earl was
lighted by a smile of bitter-sweet understanding. Mr. Overbury,
answering this, explained further that he was urged rather by his
memory of his old friendship for Robert Carr than by any news of
the position the young Scot now held in the King's favour. Yet his
lordship's smile persisted.</p>
<p>'The latter would quicken the former, not a doubt,' said he.
Then, abruptly, he added: 'Come you now with me. I am on my way to
the King; and where the King is, there shall you find Carr.'</p>
<p>It was as he promised. His majesty was moving down the privy
gallery when they entered it, and Robin Carr&mdash;a full-grown
resplendent Robin Carr in whom Mr. Overbury barely perceived traces
of the Scots lad who had been his friend&mdash;stepped beside him.
As he moved or stood, the King leaned heavily upon him, his left
arm flung about the favourite's shoulders. This was not merely, and
as it may have seemed to many, in token of his maudlin affection,
but actually as a measure of support rendered necessary by the
weakness of his royal legs. Yet maudlin only was his habit of
permitting his gross fingers to toy with the lad's red-gold
ringlets, or pinch his cheeks, what time he stood to hear one
suitor or another.</p>
<p>They were pausing thus before the vulture-headed old Earl of
Northampton, when Sir Robert's wandering and rather vacant gaze
alighted on Mr. Overbury, straight and tall beside the little
Secretary.</p>
<p>Instantly that gaze quickened into life, and in a flash the
handsome young face was aflush and irradiated by delighted
surprise. If the old affection had lain dormant for years, so
strong was its call in the moment of undergoing this abrupt
awakening, that Sir Robert unceremoniously disengaged the royal arm
from about his neck, and flung forward with both hands outheld to
greet his friend.</p>
<p>The King broke off his speech in amazement to look after him,
and a frown rumpled his brow. Instantly Haddington, one of those
who followed in attendance, stepped into the place at his majesty's
side which Sir Robert had so abruptly vacated. The King took his
arm in silence, what time his big eyes continued to stare after Sir
Robert and to con the man who had drawn him as a magnet draws a
sliver of steel.</p>
<p>Northampton's crafty face was slewed round on his scraggy neck,
and he too followed the course of the young Scot with dark old eyes
that seemed to smoulder in his parchment face.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sir Robert, ever in boyish oblivion of all but this
old friend, this paragon about whom his earliest illusions had been
woven, was wringing his hands and asking him a dozen questions in a
breath.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury laughed at so much and such generous impetuosity.
Then, observing the King's aggrievedly indignant stare, he realised
the breach of manners into which Sir Robert's eagerness had
betrayed him. He observed also, for his eyes missed nothing, the
evil leer of Northampton and the tight-lipped, satisfied smile of
my Lord Haddington. It imported at once to repair this situation.
Therefore he laughed as he replied:</p>
<p>'My answers shall be full in season, Robin. Presently his
majesty claims your attendance.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert looked over his shoulder, met the royal glance, and
grew conscious of his fault. Lord Salisbury saved the situation by
advancing with him and drawing Mr. Overbury after him to be
presented.</p>
<p>The King's curiosity, being awakened, required no less. His
reception of this stranger, however, was cold, and upon hearing him
named, he punned upon the name as execrably and cruelly as once he
had punned upon Raleigh's.</p>
<p>'Overbury? Ah! And a thought overburying in his port, I
think.'</p>
<p>That said he turned his shoulder upon the bowing gentleman. But
Salisbury would not leave it there.</p>
<p>'May it please your majesty, Mr. Overbury is no newcomer to your
service or to mine.'</p>
<p>The King's brows went up in chill inquiry.</p>
<p>'Once he was your majesty's trusted messenger to me, and
diligently he discharged his trust.' And his lordship added a
mention of the occasion.</p>
<p>Now it was an amiable trait in the character of King James that
he never forgot&mdash;unless there were strong reasons why he
should&mdash;the debt to any who had served him in those hungry
anxious days of waiting for the English crown, or to any who had
contributed in however slight a measure to his ultimate translation
from the wilderness into this Land of Plenty. Fortunate was it for
Mr. Overbury that my lord could name him for one of those, else it
is certain that his first appearance at court would have been his
last.</p>
<p>The King turned and scanned again the pale saturnine face more
closely and less coldly.</p>
<p>'I don't recall him, which is odd, for my remembrance is the
kingliest part of me. But since it's as you say, little beagle, we
shall look to see him here again.' He took his arm from
Haddington's. 'Come, Robin,' he commanded, and with Robin once more
to lean upon, he passed on.</p>
<p>But Sir Robert had whispered a word to Lord Salisbury, and this
word was a message which his lordship now delivered.</p>
<p>As a consequence, some hours later, when the audience was over
and when his majesty, having dined, had retired to sleep as was his
wont in the afternoon, the friends met again in Sir Robert's
lodging, whither Mr. Overbury had gone to await him.</p>
<p>No mean suspicion&mdash;such as might have beset another in his
place&mdash;touched young Carr's frank generous nature that he was
being sought from motives of worldly advancement. Warmly he
embraced his friend and demanded to know why his Tom had not sought
him earlier. Mr. Overbury, more self-contained, as his nature was,
quietly explained that he had only just arrived in England. His
saturnine eye conned the young man closely and commented at once
upon his fine vigorous growth and dazzling appearance. The
full-skirted doublet of dull red velvet with its waspish waist was
in the height of fashion; his silk stockings, each gartered with a
bunch of ribbons, were drawn over the knees of his cannioned
breeches; a starched ruff made his golden head, in the word of Mr.
Overbury, look like that of John the Baptist on a charger. There
were jewels in his ears and a rich gold chain upon his breast.</p>
<p>He called for cake and wine to regale his visitor, who had
fasted whilst awaiting him, and Mr. Overbury was again enabled to
admire the rich blue-and-silver liveries of Sir Robert's lackeys,
the costly service of gold plate which was set before him, the
wrought gold cup and the golden jug containing the choicest of
sweet Frontignac. Here, indeed, was a change from the Northern fare
of small beer served in pewter and oatcakes presented on a wooden
platter.</p>
<p>They sat and talked far into the afternoon, until the March
daylight was fading, and the spacious, richly hung chamber was
aglow in the light of the great sea-coal fire that blazed under the
wide chimney-cowl. At first there had been reminiscences of
Scotland in the days of their first meeting. Then Mr. Overbury
talked of his travels and of foreign ways with a dry-witted
liveliness that made sharp pictures leap to the eye. At last they
came to consider the fortunes of Robin Carr; and Mr. Overbury
learnt the stages by which his friend had climbed to the
vertiginous heights on which he found him perched.</p>
<p>But oddly enough this narrative of achievement, which should
have glowed in the telling, grew more and more sombre as it
approached its end. There was, Mr. Overbury discerned, a shadow
over the sun of this romantic emprise. Bluntly he said as much, and
desired to know its nature.</p>
<p>Sir Robert fetched a sigh. He passed a hand over his brow in a
gesture of weariness. He stared into the fire as he answered
haltingly.</p>
<p>'I am enviable only in appearance and to the vulgar. To be as I
am is to be a toy, a minion; and that's unworthy, unmanly. I am
well enough to walk with the King, to hunt with him, to carouse
with him. He'll lean upon my shoulder, pull my hair as if I were a
lap-dog, or pinch my cheek as if I were a woman. He loads me with
gifts. I am finely lodged, as you see. I may command what moneys I
require. Were I a king's son I could not lie more soft. For all
this the unthinking maybe envy me; the charitable pity me, perhaps;
but certain it is that the worthy despise me. I never meet
Pembroke's eye, or Salisbury's, but I meet frank and undisguised
contempt. In Suffolk's and Northampton's I meet the same, but
thinly veiled, because they are men whose stomachs are above their
hearts. Mean tool though they account me, they know that I may
serve them, and the knowledge keeps them striving to be civil. The
Queen never looks on me but she sneers openly, and Prince Henry,
who is accounted&mdash;ay and rightly&mdash;the noblest lad in
England, follows the example of his mother. So that no friend of
the Prince's&mdash;and his friends are many and of worth&mdash;can
be anything but enemy of mine.</p>
<p>'At times I am tempted to strip myself of all and go my ways. I
am weary of it, too, on other grounds. The King is exacting. My
presence is too constantly required, my attention must all be at
his command. I can have no friends, no associates of my own
choosing. He's sulky as a jealous woman now, because I was overfree
with my joy at seeing you. God help me, Tom, the burden of it grows
at times intolerable.'</p>
<p>Moved by passion he had risen, and now he leaned his arm upon
the chimney-cowl, his brow upon his arm.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury sat silently aghast at these revelations.</p>
<p>'What I've said to you, Tom, I've never yet said to any but
myself; indeed, scarcely to myself. It's as frank a confession as
ever Papist made to priest. And it was a necessary confession;
necessary to my sanity, letting out some of the humours that fester
in me. I think God must have sent you, so opportunely you are
come.'</p>
<p>'Opportune to what?' wondered Mr. Overbury.</p>
<p>'To advise me, Tom.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury sighed. 'From what you've said I opine your heart
advises you already.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert groaned. 'Ay!' He swung round to face his companion,
who sat grimly thoughtful, elbow on knee, chin on clenched hand.
The interview was taking a turn very different from all that Mr.
Overbury could have supposed, and, for his own sake, hoped. 'If the
King needed me for aught that matters, all would be so
different.'</p>
<p>'Aught that matters?' quoth Mr. Overbury. To a sensitive ear his
tone might have implied a doubt of the real consequence of anything
in this curious business of living.</p>
<p>Sir Robert explained himself. 'If I could be of use in affairs;
do honest work; fulfil some position of service, real service;
discharge some office.'</p>
<p>'What hinders? You are a recognised fountain of patronage, they
tell me. You can obtain such things as these for others. Why not
for yourself?'</p>
<p>'Because I lack the ability, so the King supposes. I am not
scholarly. I haven't much Latin.' He spoke bitterly.</p>
<p>'Latin?' Mr. Overbury laughed. 'What Latin has Tom Howard, whom
I find Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, in addition to
being Lord Chamberlain and Earl of Suffolk? You may become a man of
affairs without Latin.'</p>
<p>'It is objected that I have no knowledge of affairs.'</p>
<p>'Yet of all knowledge that is the most easily acquired. Why,
Robin, I vow you're needlessly dejected. If you've the will, a way
were easily found.'</p>
<p>'Not as easily as it is for you to assert it. You have
advantages. You were at Oxford and ye're learned in law.'</p>
<p>'What I know, I learnt from books; and those are free to
all.'</p>
<p>'Books, ay! I ken. I've been at books. The King himself has been
my Latin tutor. But progress is slow. And meanwhile, I am what I
am. Admitted to the King's Council, I have to recognise that every
man who fawns upon me for my patronage and favour with his majesty
is my better. I sit silent, like a silly bairn or feckless woman,
when affairs are being discussed. But yesterday it was this Dutch
business to which I had to listen shamed by my own ignorance.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury smiled tolerantly. 'Whilst others talked who knew
perhaps as little. The first art ye've to learn, Robin, which it
needs no books to teach you, is the art of dissembling this same
ignorance that afflicts you. Ignorance is more common than you
think.'</p>
<p>'Pretence would not have served me then.'</p>
<p>'Why not? What was the business?'</p>
<p>Sir Robert shrugged almost impatiently. The nature of the
business seemed an irrelevancy to his grievance. Briefly,
nevertheless, he stated it.</p>
<p>'The King's in sore distress for money. His debts are something
over a million pounds, and the new taxes devised by Salisbury since
he became Lord Treasurer are but a drop in the ocean.'</p>
<p>'Come now! This alone shows some knowledge of affairs.'</p>
<p>'I but rehearse what yesterday I heard. The King, it seems, has
a claim on the Netherlands for some eight hundred thousand pounds,
for services rendered by the old Queen in the war with Spain. He
holds as security the towns of Flushing, Brell, and ...
another.'</p>
<p>'Rammekens,' said Mr. Overbury.</p>
<p>'Rammekens; that's it. I see ye ken.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury smiled to himself. Sir Robert continued: 'Since the
Dutch cannot pay and the King must have the money, it is his notion
that he should sell the towns to Philip of Spain.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury laughed outright. 'And how did that crack-brained
notion fare at the hands of his majesty's advisers?'</p>
<p>Sir Robert was startled by the promptitude with which Mr.
Overbury had qualified the business. But he answered his
question.</p>
<p>'They talked from dinner until supper, some for and others
against it; but they reached no conclusion.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury's face wore a curious look as seen in the
firelight. 'What reasons did those urge who opposed it?'</p>
<p>'That the sale would be regarded as a betrayal of the Protestant
cause, and would give rise to bitter discontent in England.' Then,
dismissing the matter, he reverted to his own personal grievance.
'I could but sit there mute, a useless fribble without opinion to
offer.'</p>
<p>'Why should you not have had an opinion?'</p>
<p>'Because I have had no means of forming one.'</p>
<p>'Neither had they. But it skilled not with them. Ha! You rail at
others for faults that are your own. It's human enough; but it
leads a man nowhere. The matter, you say, is to be discussed again.
Now mark me closely. I am newly out of Holland, and I lack no
warrant for what I am to tell you. Make your own use of it. Convert
it into your own. By which I mean, do not recite it merely as a
lesson learnt.'</p>
<p>Thereafter at length, in detail and deliberately, Mr. Overbury
expounded the state of things Spanish in the Netherlands, whilst
the young man listened avidly. 'With that knowledge,' he concluded,
'advise boldly. As a last resource, you may cite me as your
authority. But if you do, remember to make it plain that you drew
the information from me because you accounted that thus you might
serve the King's interests. All information of affairs must be
derived from some source or other. He is fittest for the control of
affairs who knows how to discern the sources and how to reach
them.'</p>
<p>He rose and held out his hand. Night was closing in by now, and
still there was no light in the room save the glow of the fire.</p>
<p>Sir Robert clasped that hand eagerly and firmly. His voice was
anxious.</p>
<p>'You'll come again?'</p>
<p>'Whenever you require me. I am your servant, Robin. I am lodged
at the Angel in Cheapside where at need you'll find me.'</p>
<p>Sir Robin passed an arm through Mr. Overbury's, and went with
him from the room along the gallery leading to the stair-head. Here
at last he surrendered him to an usher who was to reconduct
him.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Overbury might appear to take his leave without having
discharged any part of the business which had brought him. He had
made no mention of employment for himself. That was because his
methods were more subtle. The man who can discover himself to be
required is in no need to offer himself. He can better serve his
ends by waiting to be sued.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE BOND</h3>
<p>His Majesty sat in council with his Lord Treasurer, his Lord
Chamberlain, his Lord Privy Seal, the slender, supple Sir Thomas
Lake, who had been so valued a servant to the old Queen, the
ponderous, swarthy Sir Ralph Winwood, and some others who matter
less.</p>
<p>On a stool beside the great gilded chair in which the King
lolled and fidgeted at the head of the Council board, sat Sir
Robert Carr, not yet a Privy Councillor and therefore feeling that
his presence here was just such a tolerated intrusion as might have
been that of Archie Armstrong, the King's fool.</p>
<p>The greybeards were talking. The Dutch towns were again the
subject, and divergent views were being freely expressed. The two
Howards, being Catholics in sympathy even if they did not in secret
attend Mass as was commonly supposed, were stout advocates of the
proposed sale to Spain, which might have the effect of tightening
the friendly relations between James I and Philip III. Salisbury,
who carried no interests but those of England in the stout heart
contained in his frail body, as vigorously opposed the sale, on the
ground of the well-founded discontent it would engender throughout
the land.</p>
<p>The King listened to both sides, interjecting now to answer one
and now the other, and enjoying himself vastly in the part of
Solomon, a r&ocirc;le so dear to his vanity that it was with
difficulty he was restrained from sitting as a judge in the Court
of King's Bench.</p>
<p>He answered Cecil now.</p>
<p>'You urge a matter of sentiment against a matter of necessity;
and I cannot call to mind that the history of the world, of which
my knowledge is considerable, affords a single instance in which
sentiment is able to triumph over necessity in the end. Necessity
must be served. If, so that the sentiments of the nation may be
honoured, Parliament can be induced to remove the necessity by
granting adequate subsidies, Parliament may be convened for the
purpose. But I am none so very hopeful there. Because if Parliament
had shown a proper sense of its duty and obligations to the
anointed sovereign, and a seemly obedience to his wishes, we should
not now be considering these other measures for furnishing
supplies.'</p>
<p>The Howards applauded him. Northampton, the greatest sycophant
of his time, pronounced the discourse an unanswerable marvel of
lucidity and logic. Suffolk bluntly declared that it was idle to
respect the sentiments of a nation which did not respect the
necessities of its king, and that, if the towns were sold to King
Philip and the nation were presented with an accomplished fact, it
must be made to see that the blame for anything distasteful in the
bargain must fall on Parliament which had left the King no other
course.</p>
<p>Northampton, returning to the assault, and carrying matters
further, his vulturine head and smouldering glance challenging
Salisbury at every word, asserted that too much was being assumed
on the subject of so definite a measure of alliance with Spain.
Such an alliance made for peace; the peace of the world; and thus
for general prosperity. This required only to be understood by the
nation to be applauded, and the old rancour fostered by men such as
Raleigh and other sea-robbers would soon die down.</p>
<p>This carried the debate into by-ways in which it was in danger
of being lost, when Sir Robert Carr, taking his courage in both
hands, made bold at last to intervene.</p>
<p>'Have I your majesty's leave to say a word on this?'</p>
<p>It startled them. Scornfully it amused them. So much their
countenances showed. The King, who had been toying with the lad's
shoulder-knot, paused in the act, and turned to regard him, rolling
his eyes fearfully in his alarm.</p>
<p>'Ye'd intervene in the Council!' he muttered, scandalised. Then
he recovered, and laughed his thick laugh. 'Ecod! Is it not writ:
"Out of the mouths of sucklings ..."? To it, lad. Let's hear this
word of yours.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert cleared his throat. 'Since this matter was last
discussed two days ago, I've had an opportunity to look into Dutch
affairs. Let that, Sire, excuse my presumption now.'</p>
<p>'Ye've been looking into Dutch affairs!' The King laughed, and
the Council laughed with him, all but Cecil, who suddenly
remembered Overbury, and already blamed himself for having
neglected to ascertain what that man, whom he knew for a shrewd
observer, might have discovered on his foreign travels. Young Carr,
he instantly perceived, either by accident or design, had
forestalled him there. Therefore he alone was not surprised by what
ensued.</p>
<p>Sir Robert's opening was blunt.</p>
<p>'Your discussion here is so much waste of time and labour. For
it rests upon the assumption of a state of things which does not,
in fact, exist.' He paid no heed to the snortings of contemptuous
impatience, but ploughed steadily ahead. 'You assume upon
inadequate information&mdash;information which if it was once
correct is so no longer&mdash;that King Philip will buy these
towns, which it certainly would be within your majesty's rights to
sell.'</p>
<p>Men shrugged and turned their shoulders to him. The upstart
presumed too far upon his favour. Only the King troubled to
question him.</p>
<p>'And for why would he not buy?'</p>
<p>'Because he cares, I take it, as little as another to waste
money. As long as Spain's intention was to continue the war, so
long was it possible to do what you now deliberate. But the chance
is gone! The Archduke Albert is still in the Netherlands, it is
true. But he is already taking measures for their evacuation. Spain
recognises herself, at last, at the end of her resources. Within
three months, maybe less, she will be negotiating peace with the
United Provinces. Therefore Spain no longer wants these towns. It
follows, then, that to offer them for sale to her would merely be
to provoke discontent at home to no purpose and to rouse in the
Dutch a resentment which must render the ultimate recovery of the
debt more difficult than it now is.'</p>
<p>It was a bombshell to scatter dismay among those supercilious
gentlemen.</p>
<p>Cecil and those who thought with him were not displeased by news
which rendered impossible an act whose effect on public opinion
must be disastrous. The others mingled with annoyance at the news
annoyance at the source from whence it came. Each one of them would
have challenged it had not the King forestalled them.</p>
<p>'Ud's death!' he ejaculated. 'How come you by all this knowledge
of Spain's intentions?'</p>
<p>If to magnify himself Sir Robert was disingenuous, he but
practised the disingenuousness which Mr. Overbury had counselled.
He represented that, having been sought yesterday by a gentleman of
his acquaintance who had but lately landed from the Netherlands, he
had seized the opportunity to gather information which should
perhaps be of assistance to their lordships in deciding this matter
which he knew to be vexing them.</p>
<p>'This gentleman of your acquaintance,' quoth the King, 'would be
that long-legged carle my Lord Treasurer presented to us.'</p>
<p>'The same, Sire. Mr. Overbury.'</p>
<p>'Overbury. Ay! I mind me. But what do we ken about him that we
should heed his words?'</p>
<p>'My Lord Treasurer can speak to the worth of his opinion.'</p>
<p>My Lord Treasurer did so. He was impressive. 'In the past I have
found him shrewd and cautious. If he says that Spain is on the eve
of making peace, he will have good grounds for it in what he has
observed. That being so, Sir Robert's reasoning from the facts is
not to be assailed.'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay! But if this man were mistaken in his speerings?
<i>Humanum est errare</i>, you know, my lord; and human inferences
are to be taken cannily.'</p>
<p>Young Carr, eager to follow up his advantage and, whilst the
occasion served, to impress himself upon them as something more
than the fribble they had hitherto regarded him, was swift to
supply the answer.</p>
<p>'A very little time will show whether Overbury's report agrees
with the fact. Meanwhile, prudence suggests no action whatsoever.
If in two or three months' time it be found that, instead of
withdrawing from the Netherlands, the Archduke is renewing or
increasing measures against them, then will be the time to consider
this sale, and then the time to make the sale to best advantage. If
the war drags on there can be nothing lost by waiting.'</p>
<p>'It's a Daniel come to judgment!' crowed the King, and his
delight to discover such qualities of mind hitherto unsuspected in
this handsome lad of his affection was freely displayed then and
thereafter.</p>
<p>Later, when alone with Sir Robert, the King, having further
considered, expressed a desire to test for himself the extent of
Mr. Overbury's knowledge of Netherland affairs. As a consequence a
messenger from Sir Robert waited next morning upon Mr. Overbury to
bid him to Whitehall. Sir Robert's own barge, which had come down
on the last of the ebb, awaited him amid the press of boats at
Queenhithe.</p>
<p>The King, having need of him, received him kindly, and played
the well-rehearsed part of a genial good-humoured fellow. In reply
to the royal questions Mr. Overbury expressed himself crisply,
lucidly, and wittily upon the state of affairs which he had lately
found in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>His majesty quoted Lucian, and Mr. Overbury capped the quotation
with such scholarly fullness that the King congratulated him upon
his Latinity whilst censuring his Oxford pronunciation.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury accepted both criticisms with a bow, making no
attempt to defend his accent.</p>
<p>'Ye don't take my corrections amiss,' said his majesty.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury bowed again with the utmost gravity. 'He that hates
to be reproved by the master sits in his own light.'</p>
<p>The King's eyes quickened at the phrase. Its modesty, subtle
flattery, and neatness all pleased him. 'Ye're a wit, I
perceive.'</p>
<p>A pale smile illumined that narrow melancholy face. 'My wit,
sir, is but as the marigold. It opens to the sun.'</p>
<p>Thereafter, the King's dinner-time being at hand, Mr. Overbury
was given leave to depart, having done something to remove the bad
impression his first appearance at court had created upon the royal
mind.</p>
<p>He stayed to dine with Sir Robert, and, a lover of good food and
good wine, he had occasion to admire the sumptuousness in which he
found his friend in these respects. When the cloth was raised, and
they were come to the comfits, Mr. Overbury opened the matter that
was in his mind.</p>
<p>'Yours, Robin, was not the only messenger that sought me this
morning at the Angel. There was a note from my Lord Treasurer,
bidding me to wait upon him at the earliest.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert nodded, but said nothing. Mr. Overbury resumed.</p>
<p>'His lordship and I have already some acquaintance. I served him
once in the old Queen's time, and his message means that I may
serve him again if I wish, or so I conjecture. Why, else, should he
send for me?'</p>
<p>'Why else, indeed?' Sir Robert smiled. 'I am glad, so glad, a
door is to be opened for you.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury displayed surprise. 'You're glad?' A little smile
that was tinged with regret flickered upon his lips. 'In that case
there is no more to say.'</p>
<p>'No more to say of what? And what for would I not be glad? Do I
not wish you well, Tom?'</p>
<p>'Of course you wish me well; as I wish you well.' And he
repeated: 'There's no more to say. I shall wait upon my Lord
Treasurer to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'Have you been hesitating?'</p>
<p>'Not hesitating. Waiting. Waiting to know your will with
me.'</p>
<p>'My will with you?' Sir Robert understood less and less.
Inwardly Mr. Overbury damned the sluggishness of his wits.</p>
<p>'Cecil sends for me because what happened yesterday shows that I
may be of use to him. But before going, I bethought me that perhaps
the same notion might have occurred to you. And I should be loath
to serve another, Robin, if you had need of me.'</p>
<p>'Need of you!' Sir Robert rose in the excitement that
accompanied understanding. 'Why, so I have: great and urgent need,
as you have seen. And ye could serve me as could no other man; for
in learning and knowledge of affairs you supply all that I
lack.'</p>
<p>'Why, then ...' Mr. Overbury was beginning; but the other swept
warmly on.</p>
<p>'But what have I to offer you compared with the employment you
could find with Cecil?'</p>
<p>'No matter for that.'</p>
<p>'Ay, but there is matter to it. It were to abuse your
friendship; to trade upon your love.'</p>
<p>'The trading would be mutual.' Mr. Overbury adopted complete
frankness. 'You have the graces of person and of manner that have
already conquered the King's affection. I have the knowledge and
resource which would enable you to win a real position at court, to
rise from being a mere minion&mdash;the word is yours,
Robin&mdash;to become a powerful influence in the State. Thus you
and I united compose a whole that should be irresistible. Each of
us in this is the complement of the other. Apart each of us counts
for little. United we could rule, if not the world, at least this
England.</p>
<p>'Yesterday, in this matter of the Netherlands, you increased
your credit with the King and no doubt with every member of the
Council. Already they discover in you an unsuspected force. Let
that be maintained awhile&mdash;and I could teach you to maintain
it&mdash;and you will be the power behind the throne; you will be
consulted and your views respected on every matter of weight that's
to be decided. Cecil grows old and sickly, riddled with ills; and
he, poor cripple, is the only man amongst them. When he
relinquishes the helm of this ship of State, it should be yours to
grasp it.'</p>
<p>Standing, Sir Robert had heard him out. As he ceased, the
younger man sank back into his chair, his face flushed, his eyes
aglow. He was trembling in his excitement at the dream-prospect
spread before him. Had Overbury the power to convert it into
reality? It was possible. If his own favour with the King were
backed by such knowledge as Overbury could supply, it was probable.
Already he beheld the fruits of it: saw his position at court
justified by something more than a comely face and a shapely figure
and a King's capricious fancy for such externals. He saw the sneers
converted into looks of deference; saw his self-respect restored by
the respect he inspired in others.</p>
<p>'Well, Robin?' quoth the watchful Mr. Overbury at length, to
rouse him from his daydream. 'What is your will in the matter? It
lies with you.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert raised his glowing eyes to look at his companion.
'You offer much, Tom,' he said.</p>
<p>'No more than I'll perform.'</p>
<p>'I doubt not that.' He held out a hand across the board, a hand
that trembled. 'Do as you propose. Stand by me, Tom, to make common
fortune with me, as I with you.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury took the hand in his own grip, which was as steady
and cool as the resolute brain controlling it. 'It is a bond,' he
said.</p>
<p>'A bond in which I'll never fail of my part,' said Sir Robert
fervently.</p>

<h3>LADY ESSEX</h3>
<p>As in the person, so in all the actions and transactions of Mr.
Overbury there was the neat tidiness which proceeds from methodical
habits. With him thought and plan were ever the precursors of
speech and act. Thought revealed to him that the success of his
alliance with Sir Robert Carr must depend upon the world's
assumption that Sir Robert moved upon his own unsupported
inspiration. Therefore Mr. Overbury took good care completely to
efface himself for the present.</p>
<p>He waited on the morrow upon the Lord Treasurer. But the offer
of an under-secretaryship which Cecil made him he declined with a
polite show of gratitude and reluctance. The reason he advanced
was, truthfully, that he had made other plans: less truthfully,
that these plans might entail his going abroad again shortly, in
obedience also to a restless, roving disposition.</p>
<p>They parted with mutual expressions of good will, sincere on
both sides, and of regret which can have been sincere only on the
part of my Lord Treasurer.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury removed himself in the course of the next few days
from the Angel in Cheapside to a more commodious lodging of his own
near Paul's Wharf. Here for the next few months he remained
comfortably established, with a single servant to wait upon him, a
sleek, discreet, intelligent Welsh lad named Lawrence Davies, who
quickly became devoted to him. Here he was visited at least twice a
week by Sir Robert, who came by water and with hired sculls, his
identity unsuspected. He would commonly dine or sup with Overbury
and remain for some hours, to be primed with such information as he
sought, and tutored in the uses of it.</p>
<p>From this lodging Mr. Overbury would sally forth, sometimes to
the inns of court to renew old acquaintances and to seek fresh ones
among the men of law; sometimes to Paul's, in the Middle Aisle of
which between the hours of three and six all manner of folk were to
be met and all manner of news was to be canvassed. Often he was to
be seen dining in ordinaries, and occasionally he would visit the
Royal Exchange and the taverns thereabouts, the Three Morrice
Dancers or the White Horse in Friday Street, where the fishmongers
drove their trade. Wherever he could set his finger upon the pulse
of the town, which again was to be accounted the pulse of England,
he was assiduous. As much with this intent as to indulge a poet's
natural taste for the drama, he was often at the Globe Theatre on
Bankside, where Mr. Shakespeare was still at work; and because he
was in a sense kin with such men, he frequented the suppers at the
Mermaid, introduced there by Mr. Ben Jonson who we know esteemed
him highly. Easy and affable in manner, he ingratiated himself into
all companies, engaged all and sundry in conversation, assuming in
some assemblies the character of a lawyer, in others that of a poet
and man of letters.</p>
<p>Often he would, himself, be the bearer of tidings in his various
haunts, announcing new measures which as yet were in the
egg&mdash;matters which Sir Robert informed him were under
contemplation&mdash;so as to put them to the touchstone of public
opinion and study the various comments they provoked. In this
manner he was able to advise with confidence that the enactments
touching the fines upon recusants, which of late had been relaxed,
should be fully enforced so as to replenish the ever-empty purse of
royal prodigality. Similarly he dictated leniency in dealing with
certain lingering activities of the levellers, perceiving that
public opinion was strongly on their side and that indignation was
all against the usurpations which had provoked those outbreaks.</p>
<p>In short, had he been a spy in Cecil's pay he could not have
acted other than he did throughout that year (when he was generally
supposed to be abroad), save that no spy of any Secretary of State
was ever half so diligent, alert, accomplished, and insinuating as
was he.</p>
<p>Invisible and unsuspected, he dictated policy to the Privy
Council through the lips of Sir Robert Carr, who garnered all the
glory and increased in credit at a rate that to some appeared
alarming.</p>
<p>Towards the consolidation of Carr's position nothing contributed
more than the fulfilment of his timely prognostication touching
Spain and the Netherlands. Early in the new year came an invitation
to England to co&ouml;perate in the peace settlement, as France was
already disposed to do.</p>
<p>The King slobbered and dribbled in sheer rapture to discover in
his beloved Robin the gifts of statecraft, not only in this, but in
almost every subject. The lad's penetration and insight into the
heart of the nation seemed almost uncanny. With so little
experience of the world and so few opportunities of observing
national life at first hand, his shrewd comments, trenchant
criticisms, lucid inferences, and daring forecasts argued a power
of deductive reasoning amounting to genius.</p>
<p>The Howards&mdash;and old Northampton in particular&mdash;began
to perceive in him a person to be respected, one who, if provoked
to enmity, might presently be able to crush them without effort.
Therefore, with gifts and flatteries they studied all ways of
making him their friend.</p>
<p>Forewarned against them by Overbury, and obeying implicitly the
dictates of this shrewd famulus, Sir Robert held aloof, received
their advances with a distant frigid condescension oddly at
variance with his ordinarily friendly nature, and thereby drove
them to almost frantic lengths of sycophancy.</p>
<p>Because the King favoured him, and because he now revealed
himself in all senses worthy of that favour, these men courted him
assiduously. And the more assiduously did they court him, the more
did the King favour him, taking ever-increasing pride in a creature
whose merit flattered the discernment of his creator. Thus his
popularity and influence spread in ever-widening circles as that
year advanced.</p>
<p>As a result of all this, he found himself ultimately with so
much business on his hands on the King's behalf that it became
necessary&mdash;as he represented to his majesty&mdash;to seek a
secretary who should assist him more closely and to whom he could
give his confidence more freely than to any of the three or four
amanuenses whom already he employed.</p>
<p>When his need became known there was no lack of candidates for
the office. Scarcely a gentleman about the court but had some
nephew or cousin or even son who would be proud to serve under Sir
Robert Carr. Sir Robert looked into the qualifications of those
submitted, but could not be satisfied. And then one day he
announced to the King a piece of great good fortune. Mr. Thomas
Overbury was returned to town and had been to wait upon him. Mr.
Overbury was in need of employment, and his reappearance at such a
moment seemed to Sir Robert singularly opportune. For he fulfilled
the requirements of Sir Robert more than any man alive, and subject
to his majesty's approval Sir Robert proposed to take him into his
service.</p>
<p>Thus had it been concerted between them. Sir Robert's reputation
for ability in affairs was so completely established that none
could attribute the continued display of it to any wits but his
own. Mr. Overbury, therefore, might now without damage to Sir
Robert step into the open from behind the arras which had hitherto
concealed him.</p>
<p>The King demurred. He thrust out a sulky nether lip. 'I mind me
of him, ay. The horse-faced carle that was here nigh upon a year
since.' He remembered with a pang the flash of intimacy which he
had seen pass between the two. 'Is he not maybe an over-important
gentleman for your needs, Robin? A dour fellow I deemed him.
Overburying I named him, and rightly I think.'</p>
<p>But Sir Robert insisted, employing craft, and reluctantly the
King yielded his consent.</p>
<p>However unobtrusive Mr. Overbury might be in his character of
secretary, the moment was one in which it was impossible for him to
be unobtrusive in his own. His famous 'Characters,' those
inimitable sketches of contemporary life, penned to beguile the
loneliness of idle hours in his lodging at Paul's Wharf, had lately
been published by Lisle, the bookseller at the Tiger's Head in
Paul's Yard. The little work had attracted the attention of the
wits. They were loudly acclaiming it, and purchasing it widely to
use it as a whetstone for their own small talk. A copy of it
reached the hands of the King, who read it with reluctant
admiration mingled with envy. His jealousy of any man who might
rival him in scholarship was irrepressible, which may have
contributed to his scandalous treatment of Sir Walter Raleigh, and
to his affection for Philip Herbert, who made butts of all scholars
below the royal rank, and indulged at their expense his ignorant
buffooneries. His majesty, however, dissembled his envy, swallowed
the spite which is the inevitable fruit of it, and condescendingly
from his own Olympian heights of learning bestowed a benediction
upon an author so generally acclaimed. As a result Mr. Overbury
began to be seen about the court much earlier than would otherwise
have been the case.</p>
<p>If on the score of his own merits he was the recipient of
courtesies from those who could appreciate them, as the favourite's
favourite he shared the open contempt in which Sir Robert was still
held by the few&mdash;those of the Queen's party and of Prince
Henry's&mdash;and the secret animosity of which Sir Robert was the
object at the hands of those who had learned to fear his influence
and to perceive in it an obstacle to their own advancement.</p>
<p>The perspicient Mr. Overbury missed none of this. But he was not
perturbed. He met the contempt that was rooted in envy with the
deeper and deadlier contempt that springs from the consciousness of
intellectual superiority, and he knew how to wound whilst
preserving an inscrutable sardonic urbanity of surface towards the
victim of his pitiless wit.</p>
<p>The improved relations between Spain and England resulting from
their co&ouml;peration in the peace settlement of the Netherlands
led the King in the course of that year 1610 to turn his thoughts
to the promotion of a Spanish marriage for his son. Despite his
stout Protestantism, King James was anxious to prove himself a king
who ruled by love and who by the loving arts of peace could achieve
more than had ever been achieved by force of arms.</p>
<p>As a preliminary to any definite proposals, his majesty offered
a great banquet at Whitehall to the Spanish Ambassador, the Count
of Villamediana, and the Constable of Castile, Don Pedro of Aragon.
It was the most lavish of the many lavish junketings that had piled
up King James's enormous load of debt.</p>
<p>About himself, his Queen, and their son Prince Henry, his
majesty assembled the nobility and beauty of the court, to welcome
the two illustrious representatives of King Philip and their train
of Spanish grandees.</p>
<p>They dined in public state in the great audience chamber, and
after many toasts, in the course of which his majesty became mildly
intoxicated and very maudlin, the tables were removed and the floor
was cleared for dancing.</p>
<p>First came a coranto, in which the stout, flaxen-haired,
freckled Queen, deep-bosomed, broad-shouldered, and almost
masculine of countenance, was led forth by Don Pedro of Aragon.</p>
<p>After this the King, sleepily benign and slightly lachrymose,
lolling in his great brocaded chair under a canopy of cloth of gold
with the blazonry of united England and Scotland behind his head,
desired to show off his son's paces to the Spaniards. He commanded
him to dance a galliard, and gave him leave to choose a partner,
subject to his majesty's confirmation of the choice.</p>
<p>The handsome boy, who was the hope of England and the ornament
of his not very decorative house, assented willingly enough. He
delighted almost as much in dancing as in the sterner exercises for
which he was already renowned. Although still in his seventeenth
year, he was of a good height and excellently shaped, as graceful
in body as in mind, and in all things the very antithesis of his
sire. High-spirited, valiant, gracious, and even at this young age
a patron of all deserving arts, he was fast becoming the idol of
the people, whilst the very flower of the nobility was to be found
surrounding him at Saint James's Palace, where he held his court.
Athletic in his pursuits and austere in manners, God-fearing and
studious by inclination, he contrived to be dignified and princely
beyond his years. Inevitably a gulf was widening daily between
himself and his father, opened by jealousy on the one hand and
disdain on the other. Each, however, masked his feelings. Prince
Henry studiously preserved the appearances of filial piety, and
King James displayed a fatherliness which was as much a pretence as
his uxoriousness.</p>
<p>The young Prince, standing now beside his father's chair, swept
the brilliant assembly with his glance upon no random quest. It
travelled purposefully until it reached the young Countess of
Essex, and was there arrested. Then he leaned towards the King, and
announced his choice in a murmur audible to his majesty alone. The
King smiled and nodded his great head covered by the heavily plumed
and diamond-buckled hat. The Prince, thus authorised, stepped
forward to claim the Countess.</p>
<p>Blushing a little, but displaying no more agitation than was
proper in a child as yet unfamiliar with the court, she suffered
herself to be led forth, full conscious of the great honour done
her, and unconscious of the envy it provoked in other feminine
breasts. But a few months older than the Prince, this daughter of
the Earl of Suffolk was already acknowledged to be the loveliest
ornament of King James's court, where as yet she had been all too
rarely seen. Delicately featured and very fair, the fire of life
glowed brightly in eyes whose colour shifted with the light from
blue to violet. As in the case of Prince Henry, it was universally
agreed that her outward graces were but a reflection of inward
spiritual worth. We have it on the word of one who knew her well
and had no cause to judge her generously that her goodness of
heart, her gentleness and her sweetness of disposition outshone the
ravishing beauty of her person. And with all this she was
sprightly, lively, and gay, and utterly adorable. She stood a
little above the middle height, and at this stage was almost
sylph-like in her virginal slimness. For although she had been four
years now a wedded wife, she still remained a maid. Her husband,
the Earl of Essex, a year or so younger than herself, had been
parted from her at the altar and sent upon his travels to complete
his education and to grow to manhood before claiming the custody of
his wife. The marriage had been one of policy, in which the wishes
of neither child had been consulted.</p>
<p>One of the early acts of King James's reign had been the
reinstatement of the son of that Earl of Essex whom Elizabeth had
loved and beheaded, in the titles and confiscated estates of his
unfortunate father. The Howards, too, had found favour in his royal
eyes for the sake of that Duke of Norfolk who had suffered
similarly under Elizabeth for his devotion to King James's mother.
And the marriage of Robert Devereux and Frances Howard, because
desired by her family, had been promoted by the King as being to
the advantage of both houses.</p>
<p>Until lately the young Countess had been kept more or less in
retirement at Audley End. Accounted until now too young to take her
proper place at court, she had pursued in the quiet of the country,
and saving for occasional visits to Whitehall, the studies that
should enable her to adorn the station which was hers by birth and
marriage.</p>
<p>That she had profited by them she now evinced as she moved
through the sprightly measure of the galliard with the Prince for
partner, displaying a grace and liveliness as well as an assurance
in her steps which captivated the entire court, and made the
stately Spanish gentlemen about his majesty almost as eloquent in
their praise of her beauty and art as they were in the praise which
etiquette prescribed of the person and deportment of the
Prince.</p>
<p>Having reconducted her to the care of her mother, and
constrained her to resume her chair, the Prince, instead of
returning to his father and the Spanish guests as would have been
more fitting, lingered in talk with her, bending over her where she
sat. The court looked on, and with covert amusement was blended
open surprise at conduct so very unusual in this austere young man.
If embarrassed at being made the object of these open attentions,
Lady Essex was nevertheless flattered by them, considering from
whom they proceeded, particularly when remembering his reputation
for reserve where women were concerned.</p>
<p>But whilst she listened to the Prince and spoke to him in her
turn, Lady Essex scarcely looked at him, and this not from any
shyness, but because her eyes were busy elsewhere. Covertly their
glances were directed towards the royal dais, drawn thither by one
who stood near the King, one whom the King used familiarly, patting
his shoulder or pinching his arm as he addressed him. A tall,
straight-limbed young man this, in blue velvet that glittered with
jewels, broad of shoulder, but tapering thence to a graceful
slimness. His handsome head, framed in a cloud of red-gold hair,
proudly carried and radiant with youth and health and ready
laughter.</p>
<p>Once before she had seen him, on a day nearly three years ago,
in the tilt-yard at Whitehall, when he had been flung from his
horse, and she had cried out in fear and pain for him, and had long
thereafter been haunted by the memory of his white face, as he lay
helpless and swooning in the dust. If he had looked radiant and
splendid as he rode that day on his big white horse, infinitely
more radiant and splendid did he look now, standing so self-assured
beside the royal chair.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Prince, bending his auburn head, continued to
utter amiabilities, and she knew without looking at him that his
eyes were devouring her the while. Thus until the King, grown
impatient, put an end to the matter. Court usage required that
either he or his deputy should tread a measure with the Countess of
Villamediana. Since James's own rachitic legs did not permit him to
dance, it was necessary that his son should represent him. He
despatched Sir Robert Carr to summon the Prince to his duty.</p>
<p>My Lady Essex, covertly watching them, caught the flash of
jewels on the royal hand as it was raised to point in her
direction, and then saw Sir Robert detach himself from the group
about the dais and come straight towards her and the Prince.</p>
<p>If she had flushed when his highness had approached her, she
paled now at the approach of Sir Robert, which she could not even
suppose to be in any way concerned with her. By the time he came to
halt before her at the Prince's side, she was conscious of
quickened heartbeats, of a sense of embarrassment amounting almost
to panic. She dissembled it by making play with her fan of
peacock's feathers, and masking with the edges of it the lower part
of her face.</p>
<p>Sir Robert bowed to her formally, as if to crave her indulgence,
and she admired again at close quarters his grace and his air of
noble self-command. Then he addressed himself to the Prince, and
his broad Scots accent startled her. Yet she reflected instantly
that it was no worse than the King's, and scarcely out of place in
a court presided over by a Scottish monarch. It was, indeed, almost
a maxim that a king, even in his shortcomings and infirmities,
would be the model of his courtiers.</p>
<p>'His majesty is asking for your highness.'</p>
<p>The Prince nodded almost imperceptibly, as he might have nodded
to a lackey.</p>
<p>Sir Robert stood his ground a moment, with the feeling that his
face had been slapped in public. But his lips retained their
deferential smile. Retaliation was out of the question. Humiliation
might be avoided only by ignoring that contemptuous dismissal; but
to remain, some pretext was necessary. He found it instantly in the
person of Lady Suffolk, and he turned to address her where she sat
beside her daughter, a stout woman in whose crafty, pock-marked
face it was difficult to discover the source of any of the grace
and beauty that earlier had distinguished her. Ordinarily he might
have feared from her an imitation of the Prince's manner such as
sycophancy prescribed. But Lady Suffolk was a Howard, and the
Howards were too actively wooing his friendship in those days to
leave him under any apprehension here. If her ladyship was
uncomfortable in this situation, she dissembled it. After all, the
Prince's discourtesy to Sir Robert had been no more than a
lightning flash which she might easily have failed to perceive. She
spoke to him civilly, even pleasantly.</p>
<p>His highness stared haughtily at Sir Robert's shoulder, which
was quite deliberately turned to him. Then with a low bow to Lady
Essex, he swung round and walked stiffly away to obey his father's
summons.</p>
<p>Malice whispered in Sir Robert's ear, showed him how he might
gall the Prince, who had so deliberately slighted him. Acting upon
it, he reminded Lady Suffolk that he had not yet been honoured by
presentation to her lovely daughter, thereby increasing the
unsuspected tumult in that lovely daughter's virginal breast.</p>
<p>The fiddlers in the gallery were tuning up for the last coranto,
as Sir Robert, bowing low before the youthful lady who was to shape
his destiny, murmured conventional amiabilities. No embarrassment
had tied her inexperienced tongue when a prince had similarly
addressed her under the watchful eyes of a whole court. Yet now she
was dumb. She could do no more than smile, and look up at him, to
look away again as quickly, as if dazzled by the radiance of his
countenance, the effulgence of his steady glance, which yet had
none of that devouring, wooing quality which had marked Prince
Henry's.</p>
<p>The Prince, as his father's deputy, was leading forth the
handsome Spanish Countess; the Queen had partnered with the stately
Earl of Pembroke; the Princess Elizabeth had given her hand to the
Count of Villamediana; and other noble couples were making haste to
take the floor. Sir Robert surrendered completely to the impulse of
his playful malice. Humbly he craved the honour of Lady Essex's
hand for the coranto. It was so instantly surrendered that he was
almost startled. Indeed, a pretext for refusing him the honour
would have surprised him less.</p>
<p>The musicians struck up, and the dance began. Sir Robert
displayed himself fully as graceful in the more sedate coranto as
the Prince had done in the sprightlier galliard. He carried his
head high, and there was a gleam of mockery in his eyes with which
to meet the occasional frosty glances of his highness. Lady Essex
moved with less certainty and self-possession through this measure
than she had shown in the more intricate paces of the galliard. She
was vexed with herself for this; yet so far as her partner was
concerned she need not have troubled. His mind was so intent upon
levelling the score with Prince Henry that he scarce gave a thought
to the ravishing lady who was affording him the means to do so.</p>
<p>As he was leading her back to her mother's charge, he thanked
her becomingly.</p>
<p>'Your ladyship has honoured me beyond my poor deserts.'</p>
<p>She had herself in hand by now and flashed him a quick answer:
'Your deserts are small, then, Sir Robert.'</p>
<p>'Compared with the honour, madam, they are naught. All things
are relative.'</p>
<p>She looked up at him, and quickly away again. 'You rally me, I
think,' she said, and he caught a note of odd complaint in her
voice. Was this bewitching child, he asked himself, already a
graduate in the arts of dalliance, and did she affect this tone to
challenge him? Or was she honest? He would meet sincerity, real or
simulated, with sincerity which was both at once.</p>
<p>'Judge for yourself, my lady, upon the truth; which is that,
when I begged the honour, I feared it would be denied me.'</p>
<p>'It would tax you, sir, to show reason for the fear.'</p>
<p>'I accept the challenge. The reason lay in that you had last
condescended to a prince.'</p>
<p>'Now that is almost treason. Condescension is for princes.'</p>
<p>'Saving only where Lady Essex is concerned.'</p>
<p>She grew so daring as frankly to laugh at him. They had reached
her mother now. 'You take advantage of my youth, Sir Robert.'</p>
<p>He bowed as she resumed her seat. 'No advantage, madam, but to
serve you, and that were an advantage I must always covet.'</p>
<p>He commended himself to Lady Suffolk, and took his leave.</p>
<p>As he was retracing his steps to the royal dais, the Prince
swept past him, moving with a stride better suited to Blackheath
when playing there the game of golf which the Scots had newly
brought with them to England. Straight for Lady Essex he steered
his course, as if determined to complete the work of giving her
name to the gossips which his choice of her for the galliard had
already started.</p>
<p>And there was more to follow. The courtiers were crowding now to
the windows, to witness the baitings in the yard which the King had
ordered for the entertainment of his Spanish guests. The Prince
offered his hand to Lady Essex, and conducted her to a little
balcony in which there was room for not more than three and into
which no third intruded, since her mother did not see fit to do so.
The Countess of Suffolk, greedy of royal favour and the perquisites
accompanying it, saw no disadvantage in leaving her daughter alone
thus with the Prince. After all, my Lady Essex had a husband of her
own (if one who was absent and not yet of age) and on that score
was entitled to be her own guardian.</p>
<p>Lady Essex, still a little bemused, as Sir Robert had left her,
suffered his highness almost listlessly to have his way.</p>
<p>She leaned beside him on the parapet of the little balcony and
looked down into the wide quadrangle, where a crowd of townsfolk
surged behind the barriers about the ring. In this a great shaggy
bear, chained to a post, now shambled to and fro as far as the
length of his chain permitted, now stood still with rocking body
and plaintive grunts expressive of his apprehension.</p>
<p>His highness was speaking, but no longer with any of the
sprightliness with which he had erstwhile addressed her. There was
a touch of sulkiness in his manner, of resentment even, as if his
having danced a galliard with her gave him certain rights.</p>
<p>'That fellow, Carr,' said he. 'You danced with him. Why?'</p>
<p>The audacity of it took her breath away. Only on the
recollection that he was Prince of Wales and her future king did
she restrain her indignant mirth.</p>
<p>'For the same reason that I danced with your highness. Because
he did me the honour to invite me.'</p>
<p>'Honour! Faugh! The word is hollow. Your ladyship is not so
easily honoured.'</p>
<p>'Your highness mistakes me. I am but a simple child.'</p>
<p>'Which is why I would not have your simplicity deluded.'</p>
<p>'Would he delude it, sir, do you suppose?' There was mischief in
her eyes, which but increased their witchery upon him.</p>
<p>'Ay, by making you suppose him something who is nothing, an
upstart nobody from Teviotdale.'</p>
<p>'Your highness does not like him. Is being Scottish the worst
with which you can reproach him?'</p>
<p>He bit his lip and glared at her, to be distracted by the
archness of her smile.</p>
<p>'The fellow is not fit to approach you; an upstart, scarcely
gentle.'</p>
<p>'Nay, now there you wrong him. For I found him all
gentleness.'</p>
<p>'I mean in birth, not in manners.'</p>
<p>'Surely manners are of more account than birth. And his manners
were faultless. He spoke no ill of any.'</p>
<p>His highness was out of patience at the implied rebuke. 'You
defend him?'</p>
<p>'I have not yet perceived the need. And why does your highness
speak of him?'</p>
<p>'Why?' He checked and laughed. 'Why, indeed, when there is so
much that is better worth our while?'</p>
<p>Came a babble of voices and a baying of dogs to draw their
attention to the scene below.</p>
<p>The bearward and his men were entering the enclosure.</p>
<p>The grooms retained by their leashes four pairs of straining,
eager mastiffs, furiously barking now at sight of their uncouth
prey. The great bear reared himself upon his haunches to receive
the charge of which his instincts warned him. Two dogs were loosed
and bounded forward with a last short yelp to leap gallantly at the
beast's throat. One he cuffed aside with a blow of his great paw
which rent its flank. The other he received in a hug which crushed
its ribs, then hurled it from him dead.</p>
<p>The crowd, in which city prentices ever eager for such a show as
this were conspicuous, howled its delight in Bruin's prowess. The
King and his nobles from the windows and balconies above looked
down almost as eagerly.</p>
<p>Lady Essex, seated upon a stool which a gentleman usher had
placed for her, used her fan of peacock's feathers to screen off
the view from her piteous eyes. She was white and nauseated by that
first glimpse of bear-baiting.</p>
<p>'Oh, cruelty!' she murmured.</p>
<p>The Prince faced her, leaning his elbow on the parapet, his
shoulder to the show, as if to proclaim that his interest in it was
far less than in his companion. With the arguments of a boy and a
sportsman he set about combating her aversion. The cruelty was more
apparent than real. Dogs and bear obeyed their respective natures,
which were combative. Each yielded to the lust of battle which the
sight of the other aroused, and therefore relished it.</p>
<p>If his discourse carried no conviction to that gentle lady, at
least she preferred it to the brutality of the spectacle itself,
and so was content to listen to expositions until the show was
ended and she could lower her fan without being sickened by what
confronted her.</p>
<p>The bear-baiting was followed by a performance of tumblers and
rope-dancers in which the displays of skill and agility delighted
her as highly as the previous displays had disgusted her.</p>
<p>The Prince, watching her eager face and parted lips, delighted
in her delight and was growing oblivious of his surroundings, when
suddenly a step sounded behind them. His highness swung round
irritably, to be confronted by a splendid figure in blue velvet. It
was Sir Robert Carr again, who now came to make a third upon that
balcony.</p>
<p>'Sir,' the Prince informed him curtly, 'we are private
here.'</p>
<p>The lady's breath seemed suspended at that rudeness. There was
distress in her eyes.</p>
<p>Sir Robert, very calm, a man well schooled by now in courtly
deportment and secure in his sense of consequence, smiled easily
into the boy's angry face.</p>
<p>'Your highness should not suppose that I intrude here without
orders.'</p>
<p>The lady's distress increased. Perhaps she feared he might
suppose that she, too, regarded his advent as an intrusion.</p>
<p>The Prince's glance lost nothing of its hardness, Sir Robert's
nothing of its suavity.</p>
<p>'His excellency the Count of Villamediana is taking his leave,
and his majesty desires the attendance of your highness.' He paused
to add with a touch of peremptoriness. 'They wait, your highness.'
He stood aside to give passage to the Prince, as if inviting him to
depart. Prince Henry hesitated, looking at the lady. Sir Robert, as
if answering that look, added further: 'I will be her ladyship's
escort if she will suffer it.'</p>
<p>The Prince looked beyond him, into the room. Espying Sir Arthur
Mainwaring, he suddenly beckoned him. 'Her ladyship shall have a
gentleman of my own for escort,' said he, to put the favourite
down. And added rashly: 'I am master here.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert commanded himself with a difficulty none would have
suspected from his maintained urbanity. He bowed formally as Sir
Arthur approached. To his amazement, however, the lady was suddenly
on her feet, a bright red spot in either cheek.</p>
<p>'No master of mine, your highness,' she hardily informed the
young Prince, and hardily met the instant discomfiture of his
glance. The child had suddenly become a woman. 'I own no master
other than my husband, and in his absence I am mistress of myself.'
Her glance shifted to the favourite. 'I thank you, Sir Robert, for
the escort you have offered.'</p>
<p>Prince Henry had the sense to perceive that his boyish arrogance
had carried him too far and that her ladyship was justified of her
self-assertion. The perception, however, did not soothe his ruffled
spirit.</p>
<p>He bowed abruptly. He was determined to have the last word in
the matter and to cast a final insult at Sir Robert. 'I do not
felicitate your ladyship.'</p>
<p>On that he stalked angrily from the balcony into the room, and
went to attend his sire.</p>
<p>Lady Essex quitted the balcony a moment later with Sir Robert in
attendance. The favourite shouldered Sir Arthur aside as if he had
been so much rubbish and all but trod on that gentleman's toes in
his concern to clear a way for her ladyship. Once past him, Lady
Essex spoke.</p>
<p>'I am no party, sir, to the ill manners of his highness.'</p>
<p>'You are gracious, madam, to give me in words an assurance with
which your acts had already provided me. But the ill manners are
naught. I shall forget them.'</p>
<p>'You are charitable, Sir Robert.'</p>
<p>'Just understanding. Ill manner springs from ill temper, and
perhaps in his highness's place an interruption might similarly
have distempered me.'</p>
<p>Her mother advanced to meet them. He resigned his charge and
took his leave, unconscious that the eyes that followed him as he
went to rejoin the King were questioning and a little wistful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>VENERY AND TENNIS</h3>
<p>King James observed signs which led him to suspect that he was
not as deeply loved as he deserved to be for his great gifts of
character and intellect. This from infancy had ever been his secret
grievance. Loneliness had ever overwhelmed him, and in his
desperate efforts to escape from it he had gone to odd lengths and
strange shifts, himself lavishing affection and gifts with an utter
lack of discrimination, in almost hysterical endeavours to purchase
that which he could not inspire. He might at times delude himself
that from this person or from that he was the recipient of the
great blessing he sought so ardently. But he could not now blind
himself to the fact that with the nation as a whole&mdash;noble and
simple alike&mdash;he was being regarded without reverence.</p>
<p>There were various sound reasons for this which his majesty
overlooked, persuaded as he was that all that he did must be right,
since in absolutism it is an article of faith that a king can do no
wrong.</p>
<p>His cousin, the Lady Arabella Stuart, was languishing in the
Tower&mdash;where soon, as a result of this unjust confinement and
her broken heart, she was to go mad and die&mdash;consigned thither
by this superficially genial and good-humoured king, whose royal
bowels were not to be touched by compassion in the case of any man
or woman whom his pusillanimity could construe into a possible
agent of danger to himself. All her offence lay in that with royal
blood in her veins she had made a runagate marriage with William
Seymour, whose blood, remotely, was also royal. King James,
yielding to fantastic fears that his throne might be menaced by
this unfortunate couple or by their offspring, practised upon them
the dreadful pitilessness of the coward. The world of gentle and
simple alike, being ever tender of lovers, looked on and muttered
against the inhumanity of the King.</p>
<p>The project of a Spanish marriage for Prince Henry, upon which
his majesty was said to have set his heart, was being censured
openly or tacitly by the worthier part of the nobility, headed by
the Prince of Wales himself, and by sound Protestants of all
classes, who agreed with the Prince's assertion that two religions
could not lie in one bed.</p>
<p>The King's desperate straits for money&mdash;the very servants
of the household and officers of the Crown were clamouring now for
wages which must somehow be paid&mdash;had constrained him to such
measures as the sale of monopolies, which rendered him unpopular in
the City; the levying of forced loans&mdash;so-called
benevolences&mdash;which had offended the gentry who were concerned
to provide them; whilst Puritans and Catholics were being ground
down under the fines for recusancy now remorselessly enforced.</p>
<p>And now as a last and most desperate expedient came the sale of
honours. King James had invented and instituted the order of
baronets, membership of which was to be purchased for a little over
a thousand pounds. This did little harm. The purchasers of the
title were stamped by the very title itself. But when presently
other patents of nobility were offered at prices on a rising scale,
culminating in ten thousand pounds for an earldom, it was perceived
that the hallmark of worth was to be acquired by the worthless and
the stamp of nobility to be set upon the ignoble&mdash;the
huckster, the haggler, the truckler&mdash;with ten thousand pounds
to spend on spurious honours. This fired the indignation of that
small section of the nobility which was not already out of conceit
with his majesty upon other grounds.</p>
<p>Few, indeed, now were those who remained loyal, and these few
were loyal to the office rather than to the man.</p>
<p>The contemplation of such a state of things reduced his majesty
to tears. He wept easily, especially when swept by gusts of
self-pity, and never so easily as over lack of response to the
affection which flowed so generously from his loving nature.</p>
<p>Tearfully he unburdened himself to Sir Robert Carr. He
inveighed, in terms which characteristically mingled piety with
lewdness, against human ingratitude and the hardness of the heart
of man, pointing out how fatherly had been his conduct towards the
nation, how unfilial the nation's conduct towards himself. Working
up from tears to anger, he finally announced in a passion that all
of them 'maun gang to the Deil!' and gave his attention entirely to
the pursuit of venery.</p>
<p>But even here new sorrows awaited him.</p>
<p>He hunted at Richmond. The weather was fine and warm, the
country air invigorating, and he was at the pastime dearest to his
heart. Finding himself attended by a vast concourse of members of
his lately disgruntled court, his spirits rose. Things could not be
so bad as in his depressions he had imagined. He did not perceive
that it was not himself who had attracted so noble an assembly, but
Prince Henry, whose attendance he had commanded.</p>
<p>Booted and spurred, in the suit of Lincoln green which he
affected on these occasions, a little feather in his hat and a
hunting-horn slung at his side in place of the detested sword, his
majesty followed the hounds on a horse of which it might be said
that it carried him rather than that he rode it. Sir Robert Carr,
Montgomery, and Haddington kept close to him as a body-guard; the
huntsmen hung on the flanks; the Court trailed after them.</p>
<p>At the end of a hard chase, on the edge of the forest near the
river, a stag was pulled down by hounds as it was making for the
water, and the jubilant monarch, who felt the achievement to be
entirely his own, blew a mort over the carcase.</p>
<p>Followed, under the shade of the oaks, a generous collation,
with abundance of wine and much gaiety, in which the easy-going
King, having completely recovered his usual spirits, set the
example. He was almost gallant towards the few ladies who had
shared the chase, and gave particular attention to the Countess of
Essex, all in green like himself, who had accompanied her cousin,
the Earl of Arundel. The King made merry upon the absence abroad of
her ladyship's husband and on the subject of the reception awaiting
him on his return. His majesty's pleasantries, which were a little
questionable, brought a frown to the brows of Prince Henry. With
difficulty his highness curbed the annoyance aroused in him, and no
sooner was the collation ended than he rose and begged his father's
leave to depart with those who had accompanied him. He explained
that as he was returning to Saint James's, he was at the mercy of
the tide. He would ride to Kew where the wherries waited, and there
leave the horses in the charge of the grooms.</p>
<p>His majesty, who by now was coming to regard the heir to the
throne as the most troublesome of his subjects, gave leave readily
enough to him and his company. Not until they were actually
departing did he realise what this meant to him and why the
concourse that day had been so numerous and brilliant. Only a small
group of courtiers, apart from the huntsmen and servants, remained
with the King. The main body trailed off in the wake of the
Prince.</p>
<p>King James observed this departure in goggle-eyed dismay, all
the joviality gone out of him. Seated on a cushion, his back
propped against an oak, he seemed to sag together like an empty
bag. A tear ran down his cheek.</p>
<p>'God's sake!' he muttered. 'Will he bury me alive?' He fetched a
ponderous sigh. 'The Lord's will be done!'</p>
<p>Sir Robert offered him wine. He thrust the offer aside. 'No, no.
I've drunk deep enough this day; and of a bitter cup, God knows.
Help me up, Robin; and let's be going.'</p>
<p>As they came by an avenue in the forest, in the neighbourhood of
Sheen, Sir Robert thrust forward to the side of Lady Essex, who
with her cousin Arundel was of those who rode back with the King to
the Palace at Richmond where Elizabeth had breathed her last. He
chose a moment when she was alone, riding two or three lengths in
advance of her cousin, who was deep in talk with the sprightly Lady
Hay.</p>
<p>She looked round to see who came, and went first white, then
red, upon perceiving the identity of the green-clad gallant drawing
level with her. She contrived to smile a greeting to him, and even
to utter one, with a boldness that almost surprised herself.</p>
<p>'You compassionate my solitude, sir.'</p>
<p>'No need for that since it is of your own seeking; besides which
I find you in the best of company: your own. My fear was to
intrude.'</p>
<p>'Then we are both at fault in our surmises, Sir Robert.'</p>
<p>'I am honoured, madam, that you should have borne my name in
your remembrance.'</p>
<p>'You were supposing my memory infirm?'</p>
<p>'Rather myself scarce worth remembering by one for a place in
whose recollection there are many suitors.'</p>
<p>'Here's gallantry in the garb of modesty, I think.' There was a
hint of wistfulness in her playful tone, as if she could have
desired the gallantry to be sincere.</p>
<p>'Am I different in that from others?'</p>
<p>'Alas! no.'</p>
<p>'Is it matter for a sigh?'</p>
<p>'That you should be cast in the common mould of courtiers? Is it
not?'</p>
<p>'Madam, I'll cast myself in any mould you favour if you will
designate it.'</p>
<p>'You might find that of sincerity becoming.'</p>
<p>'So I might if I knew the precise fashion of it. I was bred up
in courts, my lady.'</p>
<p>'Were you so?' She turned her head to look at him. The surprise
in tone and glance provoked a smile in him, a radiant smile
displaying strong white teeth behind the auburn beard.</p>
<p>'What else had you supposed?' he wondered. 'Am I so loutish a
gouk as to make the thing incredible?'</p>
<p>'It is that Prince Henry said ...' She checked, realising her
indiscretion.</p>
<p>'Ah! Prince Henry!' He sighed in his turn, but with mock
solemnity. 'He'll have represented me as a swineherd, so as to
commend me to your regard. You may have observed that he does not
love me. But is it matter for wonder? Here you behold a house
divided against itself; and to serve the King is to offend his
highness. I am conscious of no other offence.'</p>
<p>She made him no answer. Child though she might be in years, yet
she was woman enough to know that another cause of offence existed,
provided, however unwillingly, by herself.</p>
<p>They rode some little way in silence. The head of the cavalcade
had spurred ahead. Keeping pace with it at first, they presently
slackened rein when they perceived that the remainder of the
company advanced more leisurely. Thus they came to find themselves
almost alone among the sunshine-dappled shadows of the forest. It
lent a sense of intimacy to their companionship, of which the
Countess was intensely conscious. At last Sir Robert spoke.</p>
<p>'Your ladyship came, I think, in the Prince's train?'</p>
<p>Her answer supplied a slight amendment. 'At the bidding of my
cousin Tom, to behold a stag-hunt for the first time.'</p>
<p>'Yet you did not choose to return with his highness.'</p>
<p>'Why, no; since Tom remains.'</p>
<p>'That need not have hindered your ladyship from following your
inclinations.'</p>
<p>'You assume too much, Sir Robert.' She was a little on her
dignity all at once. 'I am following them. I am a Howard, and
loyalty is our tradition.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert smiled as he thought of one or two Howards who had
lost their heads through departing from that same tradition. That,
however, was irrelevant.</p>
<p>'Loyalty, madam, is a duty. I spoke of inclinations.'</p>
<p>'Inclinations?' The spirit of mischief smiled in bright eyes. 'A
woman's duty when performed must be taken to display her
inclinations.'</p>
<p>Thus she evaded him, and left unanswered the question that was
in his mind.</p>
<p>Soon it was to arise again; for the Prince's hostility to him,
which had been covert hitherto, seemed now to seek occasions for
open expression. Its next came a week later in the tennis-court at
Whitehall. Sir Robert and Mr. Overbury had matched themselves
against my Lord Montgomery and Sir Henry Trenchard, a gentleman of
the Prince's household.</p>
<p>The Lord Chamberlain's quarters overlooked the court, and at one
of its open windows appeared now, attracted by the game, a group of
ladies which included the Lord Chamberlain's wife and her
daughter.</p>
<p>Victory fell easily to Sir Robert's side. As it was being
achieved, Prince Henry sauntered into the little gallery above the
court, attended by some gentlemen of his following. Perceiving Lady
Essex at the window, his highness was prompted to seize the
opportunity which the tennis-court afforded him of serving two
purposes at once: to display his prowess to her ladyship, and to
put down this upstart who seemed to have found some favour in her
eyes.</p>
<p>It is distressing to present a youth of such fine parts,
normally so amiable, gifted, and accomplished, in these scenes of
pettiness into which an unrequited passion thrust him. His very
inexperience in dalliance but served further to betray him.</p>
<p>He came forward now with all the assurance of his athletic
skill, for in all bodily exercises he was of an unusual address. He
had trained his muscles against fatigue by long and arduous
walking. He was an expert with the long bow, the art of which he
strove to keep alive; and he was always ready to match himself
against any man at tennis, at tossing the caber, at riding at the
ring or any other feat of horsemanship.</p>
<p>'Sir Robert, they tell me you are accounted a doughty opponent
at tennis. Will you make a match with me?'</p>
<p>If the invitation surprised Sir Robert, the haughty, unfriendly
tone of it left him no doubt that it was not from love of the game
that he was challenged. Since it was not to be shirked, he bowed
submissively.</p>
<p>'Your highness's servant.'</p>
<p>The Prince threw off jerkin and doublet, bound his auburn hair
in a white kerchief, and, being lightly shod, was ready.</p>
<p>He derived an advantage from his freshness in opposing one who
was scarcely rested from the game. But the advantage was not
sufficient for his needs. Sir Robert, sound in wind and limb, more
mature of body, and of a natural strength which was more than a
match for the Prince's cultivated vigour, combined with the
endowments of nature an expertness at the game which was probably
unrivalled. Tardily the Prince learned the lesson that it is
prudent first to ascertain the strength of him you propose to
challenge. Not that he was yet suffering defeat. But&mdash;and this
was even more galling&mdash;he was being made gradually to perceive
that whether he suffered it or not would be entirely as his
adversary elected. Point by point Sir Robert kept level with him,
playing easily, without exertion, and making it clear to the
onlookers that he found here no need to call out his reserves.</p>
<p>As the Prince's suspicion grew that Sir Robert toyed with him,
he put it to the test by deliberate slackness, and found Sir Robert
still avoiding the advantage. Finally the Prince took the point
which gave him the lead, and in a moment, without effort, Sir
Robert was level with him again. His highness, deeply mortified,
lost control of himself. He walked furiously forward, without
attempting to take the last ball his opponent had driven. His face
was white.</p>
<p>'I'll play no more, sir.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert looked at him a moment with raised brows. Then he
bowed. 'As your highness pleases.'</p>
<p>The Prince confronted him, his glance so menacing that
instinctively the gentlemen who were present drew nearer.</p>
<p>'You do not ask, sir, why I break off.'</p>
<p>'I am not so presumptuous as to probe the reasons of a
prince.'</p>
<p>'Then you may have them without probing. You are too much the
courtier even when you play at tennis.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert smiled a little as he bowed again. 'No less at least,
I trust, than I am now.'</p>
<p>The Prince blinked and frowned a moment over his meaning; then,
perceiving it, he loosed the full tide of his anger.</p>
<p>'You insolent dog!' He swung aloft his racket, to strike.</p>
<p>With a cry of 'Sir! Sir!' Mr. Overbury slipped in and caught his
wrist. He gripped it as firmly as he dared, but not so firmly as to
prevent his highness from instantly wrenching it free. The
intervention, however, gave him time to recover from his momentary
fury.</p>
<p>'Why do you hinder, sir? I desired to test the extent of Sir
Robert's courtiership.'</p>
<p>'A blow, your highness, is no test from one whose rank makes him
secure from its return.'</p>
<p>The Prince stared wide-eyed amazement at the long, pale,
masterful countenance. Slowly the colour came to suffuse his young
face from chin to brow.</p>
<p>'What do you mean, sirrah?'</p>
<p>'To serve your highness.' And he explained: 'The racket would
have hurt Sir Robert's head less than your own honour.'</p>
<p>The Prince looked round at his gentlemen, all of whom were grave
as mutes. He laughed on a hard short note. 'I am at school again,
it seems. I am being tutored in tennis and in honour.' Abruptly he
flung down his racket. 'Come, sirs,' he commanded shortly, and
stalked off to the little gallery, to resume his garments. Thence
he presently departed, all following him save only Sir Robert and
Mr. Overbury.</p>
<p>'We remain upon the field, it seems,' said Sir Robert, smiling
grimly.</p>
<p>'With all the honours, saving perhaps the honours of war,' said
Mr. Overbury. 'If we survive I'll add a chapter to my "Characters"
and entitle it "The Prince."'</p>
<p>'If we survive?'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury shrugged. 'This was the skirmish. The battle is to
follow. And unless I've little skill at guessing, it will be fought
in his majesty's closet.'</p>
<p>'Bah!' Sir Robert was contemptuous. 'Let the boy bear his tales.
The King's none so fond at present.'</p>
<p>'It depends upon how he presents his story. Between us we've
singed the divine quality of royalty.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert shrugged, and turned away to get his doublet. As he
went he raised his eyes to the window occupied by the ladies. A
kerchief fluttered a greeting to him; bright eyes smiled
mischievous commendation upon him. He bowed, his hand upon his
heart.</p>
<p>'Poetic!' said Mr. Overbury. 'Most poetic! You receive the
tribute which was all the prize his highness sought. Have you
observed, Robin, that in this world things never happen as the
foolish and presumptuous plan them?'</p>
<p>The ladies were withdrawing from the window. Perhaps my Lady
Suffolk accounted her daughter excessively imprudent.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury sighed pensively. 'A sweet child, that daughter of
the House of Howard. I could write sonnets to her if I thought his
highness would buy them against his need: something in the manner
of Mr. Shakespeare, who is a master of the Italian measure.'</p>
<p>'Why, thou venal rogue, is not the lady a sufficient
inspiration?'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury was helping him into his doublet. 'Inspiration,
yes: but there's the translation of it in labour. With a golden rod
I could strike Castalian springs from any rock. But soft! Here
comes an ambassador of wrath, or I'm mistaken.'</p>
<p>It was Sir James Elphinstone, one of the Prince's gentlemen, and
the knight who once had been dispossessed of his lodging in the
palace to make room for the favourite, a matter which he had never
forgotten or forgiven. He bore down upon them truculently, his
right hand twirling his mostachios, his left on the pommel of his
sword, thrusting it horizontally behind him.</p>
<p>He came to a halt before the Scot. 'Sir Robert,' quoth he,
'certain words fell here a moment since.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury slipped neatly between them. 'You're right, Sir
James. And the best of them fell from me, as commonly happens when
I'm of the company. I've an uncommon gift of words in prose or
verse, and it's a gift entirely at your service. Peace, Robin! The
gentleman's concern is with words and me; and I'm here to give him
both&mdash;or as much of them as he can stomach.'</p>
<p>Tall Sir James, his eyes level with Mr. Overbury's, scowled
darkly. 'Sir, I have no affair with you.'</p>
<p>'If I thought that were true, I could soon mend it.' Thus Mr.
Overbury on a light note of badinage. 'But I'll demonstrate your
error. You are come, I take it, as the deputy of his highness.'</p>
<p>'You are correct so far.'</p>
<p>'I am correct however far. I make a habit of it.'</p>
<p>Here Sir Robert sought again to elbow him aside. But he would
not budge. 'Let be, Robin. D'ye not perceive this is an affair
between deputies? I as your deputy will meet his highness's deputy,
or jackal, or bully swordsman, or roaring boy, or gutter-blood, or
whatever else he accounts himself.'</p>
<p>'Sir,' roared Sir James, 'you are insufferably offensive.'</p>
<p>'I told you I have an uncommon gift of words.'</p>
<p>Sir James was out of countenance before this frigid mockery. He
could but storm.</p>
<p>'By God, sir, d'ye rally me?'</p>
<p>'What then, Sir James? What then? Will you skewer my vitals and
devour me whole? I exist to do your pleasure whatever it may
be.'</p>
<p>Sir James's furious eye measured him from head to foot. Sir
James recovered some of his wits and employed them.</p>
<p>'I have said that my affair is not with you, but with the fellow
who skulks behind you.'</p>
<p>After that Sir Robert was not to be restrained. 'Skulks!' he
roared, and 'Fellow!' He put forth his strength, and thrust Mr.
Overbury aside. The next moment Sir James was rolling in the dust,
knocked over by a blow from the infuriated Scot.</p>
<p>He gathered himself up, dissembling his hurt, grinning his rage
and satisfaction. Though at some cost to his person, dignity, and
apparel, he had, he considered, accomplished the mission on which
he came. 'By God, you shall meet me for this.'</p>
<p>'Meet you? Meet you!' Sir Robert, tense and athletic, snorted
scornfully. 'I'll beat your bones to a jelly when you please; and
that's the only way I'll meet you. I do not fight with
jackals.'</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury laughed. 'Did I not tell you so? Lord! Sir James,
had you listened to me you might have saved your pains; ay, and
your breeches.'</p>
<p>Sir James, white-faced and glowering upon Sir Robert, had no
ears for the taunt.</p>
<p>'This ends not here,' he said. 'Nor thus. Be sure of that.' He
paused. Then, very minatory, he repeated: 'Be sure of that.' Since
he could think of nothing else to add, he departed abruptly.</p>
<p>Sir Robert watched him go. Then he took up his hat. He looked at
Mr. Overbury, who was solemn.</p>
<p>'Again we remain upon the field, Tom,' he laughed.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury shook his head bodefully. 'It's but another
skirmish. The battle is still to come. Let your Te Deum wait until
it's over.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>PREFERMENT</h3>
<p>King James in bedgown and slippers, his head swathed in a
multi-coloured kerchief, sat on the edge of his great canopied bed,
looking like Pantaloon in the comedy. His fingers tugged fretfully
at his thin sandy beard. There was humidity about the corners of
his bovine eyes, and a melancholy beyond the usual in their
depths.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, tense with choler, strode restlessly to and
fro in the royal bedchamber, talking briskly and vehemently. He was
inveighing against Sir Robert Carr and Sir Robert's henchman, Mr.
Thomas Overbury. Sir Robert, he complained, had ever been wanting
in respect to him; but to-day his insolence had transcended all
pardonable bounds. Mr. Overbury had been his accomplice in this,
and thereafter Sir Robert had gone to unutterable length of
audacity. He had grossly manhandled a gentleman of the Prince's
following, and this within the very precincts of the palace. His
highness seemed to imply by his tone that the locality magnified
the offence into a sacrilege.</p>
<p>So long as the complaint had been concerned with Sir Robert's
conduct, the King had sought to stem the vigour of his son's
invective and to belittle the whole matter.</p>
<p>'Tush! Tush! Here's a garboil all about naught. The truth is ye
can't abide Robin, which is but a sign of the lack of discernment
I've remarked in you. That not liking him ye should have put
yourself in his way as ye seem to have done, is a sign of your lack
of prudence which I've similarly remarked. Being my son, I cannot
refrain from marvelling at the general want of judgment in you, for
which you have my profound commiseration.'</p>
<p>Whereafter he added with a touch of peremptoriness: 'Be off home
to bed with you, a' God's name, and sleep yourself into better
sense.'</p>
<p>Anger, however, had rendered the young man insubordinate. 'My
tale is but half-told,' he had answered, and thereupon resumed his
pacing and his stormy narrative.</p>
<p>The King groaned, and aloud inquired from his soul of his God
what he had ever done to be plagued with such a son as this, who
came demanding of him the impossible. For to punish Robin for a
matter in which his majesty's heart told him Robin was not to blame
was as unthinkable as it would be unkingly.</p>
<p>Then came the mention of Mr. Overbury and the gross insults to
Sir James Elphinstone by which he had fanned the flames of discord.
The King grew less disconsolate. A scapegoat might be found for
Robin, and thus would his obstreperous son be satisfied. And than
Mr. Overbury no scapegoat could have been preferable to his
majesty, who had no love for the horse-faced carle.</p>
<p>King James assumed the mantle of Solomon, and the canopied bed
became the judgment throne.</p>
<p>'On my soul, ye clutter my wits wi' your clatter and clavering.
If you want justice of me, let me have a plain tale, so that I may
pronounce upon it. How came Robin to lay hands upon Sir James?'</p>
<p>The Prince's tale&mdash;which we may suppose to represent his
gentleman's report to him of what had passed&mdash;was that Sir
James had been grossly insulted by Mr. Overbury with the object of
provoking him to a duel.</p>
<p>'A duel!' The King was genuinely horror-striken. 'A duel, did ye
say? I'll deal with Mr. Overbury. As God's my life, he shall learn
to respect the laws I make. Get you gone and leave this in my
hands. I'll deal with it before I sleep.'</p>
<p>The Prince, however, was far from satisfied. Mr. Overbury, he
protested, was by no means the chief offender.</p>
<p>'Ye'll leave me to be the judge of that when I've sifted the
matter, as sift it I will. God save us all! Are we to have duelling
again? And here in my very court? Away! Away!'</p>
<p>He summoned his gentlemen-in-waiting and constrained his
highness, still unsatisfied, to take his leave. Then he despatched
Lord Haddington in quest of Sir Robert Carr.</p>
<p>The messenger found Sir Robert with Mr. Overbury in the severely
furnished chamber which served them as a workroom. Here despite the
lateness of the hour Mr. Overbury was still at those labours which
were increasing almost daily in arduousness.</p>
<p>In a high-backed padded chair, at a vast oak table which served
him for a writing pulpit, sat the favourite's secretary. He was
entrenched on three sides, as it seemed, by a parapet of piled-up
documents, and lighted in his labours by two clusters of candles in
great silver branches.</p>
<p>Here were papers concerned with petitions of all kinds, with
monopolies, benevolences, matters of poundage and tunnage, and
foreign dispatches, all awaiting the immediate attention of one who
virtually discharged the duties of a Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Mr. Overbury, in a wine-coloured bedgown, worn over shirt and
breeches, sat quill in hand, making marginal notes upon an imposing
document.</p>
<p>To receive his visitor, Sir Robert rose from the window-seat
where he had been lounging at the open casement, for the night was
hot as with the threat of thunder. A faint odour hung upon the air,
vague to the nostrils of Lord Haddington, who was only slightly
acquainted with tobacco.</p>
<p>Sir Robert, who had been on the point of going to bed,
dissembled his reluctance at the summons. This reluctance was
increased when his lordship told him significantly that the Prince
had been with his father. By now the afternoon's scene in the
tennis-court was the talk of all the court. Here, then, it seemed,
was the battle which Mr. Overbury had predicted. Metaphorically, as
he went, Sir Robert girded up his loins.</p>
<p>He found the King alone, awaiting him. His majesty no more
desired witnesses for the scene with Carr than for that which had
taken place with the Prince.</p>
<p>Enthroned once more upon the canopied bed, the skirts of his
gown swathing his lean shanks, the King received the favourite with
a countenance of unusual gravity. He laid before him the complaints
of the Prince, alluded severely to the manhandling of Sir James
Elphinstone, and was very hot upon the subject of Mr. Overbury and
his endeavours to put a duel upon Sir James.</p>
<p>He would have, he announced, no brawlers about his court and no
duellists within his kingdom, and not a day longer would he
tolerate the presence of a man who set his known wishes at
defiance. He was King, and he would be obeyed. He would so, by
God's death! Breathing noisily, from rage and adenoids, he paused
and gave Sir Robert at last a chance to answer him.</p>
<p>'Your majesty is not correctly informed of what took place.'</p>
<p>'How?' The King scowled upon him. 'Have you not heard that I had
Prince Henry's word for all?'</p>
<p>'Prince Henry was not himself a witness of all. This matter of
Tom Overbury, now, is at once true and false; but more false than
true. Sir James was the brawler. He came to brawl with me. He was
the duellist in this. He came to force a duel upon me&mdash;came
back to do so after his highness had left us.'</p>
<p>'On you! He came to force a duel upon you, Robin?' Majesty was
appalled. The current of the royal wrath was instantly diverted.
'Body o' me! What are ye saying?'</p>
<p>'It was so as to forestall him, so as to shield me from this
fire-eater, that Tom got between us and offered himself as my
deputy.'</p>
<p>The King's goggle-eyes were glaring at him. This mention of
Overbury, this warm defence of him, once again changed the
direction of the King's anger. His mounting tenderness was suddenly
converted into suspicion.</p>
<p>'How came ye, then, to lay hands upon Sir James?'</p>
<p>Sir Robert told him. The King rolled his eyes as he listened.
His answer, when it came, was indirect.</p>
<p>'Among ye, ye make a bear-pit of my palace. Ye provoke his
highness into derogation from his royal dignity, and ye so anger
him that he comes storming here to me, forgetting that, if I am his
father, I am also his king. Say what ye will in defence of that
rogue Overbury, if he had not used the words he used to Sir James
Elphinstone, the affair might have been kept within the bounds of
decency.'</p>
<p>'I have already informed your majesty ...'</p>
<p>'I ken well what ye've informed me. But my eyes are keen enough
to see through words into the very heart of the matter, and to form
opinions for myself. There's no way but one to end this, to restore
peace and provide against repetitions of anything so unseemly. This
fellow Overbury must go.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert stiffened, and the colour deepened in his face. He
would have spoken, but the King stayed him, raising his hand and
assuming a masterfulness of air and tone, such as he had never yet
employed to his favourite.</p>
<p>'Not a word of protest, Robin. It's not a request ye've heard,
but a command. A royal command. See it executed.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert used his wits briskly. He bowed, utter submission in
every line of his stalwart, graceful figure, utter submission in
his voice.</p>
<p>'I am your majesty's most loyal subject and most obedient
servant. Mr. Overbury will have left Whitehall and your majesty's
service by this time to-morrow.'</p>
<p>The King's face lighted with triumph, and remained so until Sir
Robert added:</p>
<p>'Have I your majesty's leave to accompany him?'</p>
<p>'Accompany him? Accompany him! For God's sake tell me what you
mean?'</p>
<p>'What I have said, Sire. My wish is to go with Mr.
Overbury.'</p>
<p>'By God, you don't.'</p>
<p>'Your majesty may send me to the Tower for disobedience. But
short of that I go with Mr. Overbury.'</p>
<p>The King stared his gloomy dismay and vexation into that
resolute countenance. The royal lip began to tremble. The royal
eyes grew lachrymose. Then rage exploded from him.</p>
<p>'Ye maun baith gang to the Deil!' he roared in broadest Scots,
and slipped off the bed to stand shaking with passion.</p>
<p>Sir Robert bowed, and moved backwards towards the door.</p>
<p>The King's bellow arrested him. 'Where are ye going?'</p>
<p>'I understood your majesty to dismiss me.'</p>
<p>'You understood nothing of the kind. I vow ye desire to
exasperate me. I warn you, Robin: I'll not be trifled with.' He
shambled forward a little, and grew maudlin. 'I've been good to
you, Robin; and this is an ill requital. Are you as ungrateful as
the rest?'</p>
<p>'Sire, naught that you can do&mdash;not if you send me to the
Tower, or even to the block&mdash;will quench my gratitude and love
...'</p>
<p>The King interrupted him, taking up the word. 'Love? You have no
love for me. You're like the rest. All is make-believe, play-acting
to gain your ends. Love joys in giving. You, like the others, seek
only to take.'</p>
<p>'Sire, I have not deserved this. You are unjust.'</p>
<p>'Unjust, am I? In what am I unjust? Have you not proved yourself
when you announced that you'll desert me for this rogue
Overbury?'</p>
<p>'If I did less I should be a party to the cruel wrong that is
being done this man, for having shown himself ready to risk his
life for mine. That is all his offence, Sire. What a contemptible
rogue should not I be if I did not insist upon sharing a punishment
which I have brought upon him?'</p>
<p>'It remains that I count for naught.'</p>
<p>Sir Robert looked him straightly between the eyes. 'Could your
majesty ever again trust or esteem me if I were so dead to honour
and to obligations as to abandon that loyal man at such a
moment?'</p>
<p>Again the King evaded the question. 'Obligations? And what of
your obligations to me?'</p>
<p>'I have never been unmindful of them. To the best of my poor
ability and strength I have served your majesty loyally and
faithfully, ay, and unsparingly. My life, Sire, is yours. I would
yield it up willingly in your service, as God's my witness.'</p>
<p>The appeal to tenderness, fervently uttered, played havoc with
the royal emotions, ever vulnerable to such assaults.</p>
<p>'Robin! Robin!' He advanced upon the young man, holding out his
hands, and brought them finally to rest on Sir Robert's shoulders.
'You mean that? For God's sake say that you mean it. For God's sake
say that ye'll not forsake me; that ye'll not break my lonely old
heart!'</p>
<p>Sir Robert smiled with the irradiating, irresistible tenderness
of which he had the gift.</p>
<p>'In forsaking you, Sire, I should be breaking my own heart
together with my fortunes. Yet ...'</p>
<p>'Say no more, Robin. Say no more, man.' The King's grip
tightened on his shoulders. 'I believe you. You're true steel in a
world of painted laths.'</p>
<p>He loosed his hold and went shambling away again, wiping his
eyes. 'Henry'll be angry if I do naught. He'll no doubt come raging
to me again with his hectorings and his insolences. But I'll bear
it. For your sake, Robin lad, I'll bear it all.'</p>
<p>It was a capitulation which might have satisfied Sir Robert. But
he did not yet choose to be satisfied. He knew the vacillations of
the royal mind; knew that this might change again.</p>
<p>He did not desire, he announced, that the King should suffer
griefs on his account. He did not deserve it, and, all things
considered, he thought it would be better if the King dismissed him
together with Mr. Overbury. As it was, he had too many enemies at
court; there were so many great lords who treated him cavalierly,
whose eminence placed them beyond the reach of his resentment.</p>
<p>He drove the King to frenzy by his determination. He was bidden
to hold his clavering tongue. He was assured by a fond monarch, now
utterly terrified of losing him, that he should be made as great a
lord as any in the land, so that he should take precedence of any
insolent gentleman who in the past might have presumed upon
superior rank.</p>
<p>Then, finding that Sir Robert still wavered, the King had
recourse to cajoleries and pettings, and finally made an abject
surrender. Not only should Mr. Overbury remain, but he should
receive the honour of knighthood and be raised to the dignity of a
gentleman of the household. As for Sir Robert himself, he should
have the castle of Rochester with the title of Viscount, besides
the vacant Barony of Winwick in Northamptonshire; he should be
invested with the Order of the Garter, become a member of the Privy
Council and Keeper of Westminster Palace for life. Thus should men
know the love and esteem in which he was held by his king, and they
should honour him or it would be the worse for them.</p>
<p>On that, long after midnight, the King embraced and dismissed
him, and went at last to bed exhausted by the emotions of the
evening. Robin's determined championship of Mr. Overbury, reviewed
in retrospect, fanned the King's singular and abnormal jealousy.
The circumstance that he had been compelled to yield at all where
Overbury was concerned, rendered that detestable fellow more
detestable than ever in the royal eyes.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of weak, unstable natures to give
generously under pressure, and, thereafter, hating their own
weakness, to hate the recipient of the gifts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>IMPORTUNATE WOOERS</h3>
<p>Prince Henry's pursuit of my Lady Essex showed little sign of
prospering. There were few opportunities of meeting the lady, and
none of being private with her. To create or increase them, his
highness was driven to odd shifts, the oddest of which was his
tightening relations with the Earl of Northampton.</p>
<p>He knew his lordship to be, like all the Howards, a
crypto-Catholic, which in itself was a thing detestable to the
fervently Protestant Prince. He knew him for a friend of Spain and
suspected him of being secretly in the pay of King Philip, which
was still more detestable. He knew him also for one of the most
ardent advocates of the Spanish marriage, which was most detestable
of all. But just as the pangs of hunger will make a thief out of an
honest man, so will the pangs of love compel the most scrupulous to
discard his scruples.</p>
<p>The Lady Essex, beloved of her great-uncle, was often to be
found at Northampton House, the magnificent palace which he had
built himself in the Strand. Prince Henry, informed of this, came
to be found there scarcely less often.</p>
<p>Surprised at first by this sudden friendliness of a Prince who
hitherto had hardly acknowledged his existence, the crafty old
nobleman looked about him for the reason. His keen vulturine eyes
were not long in discovering that his little golden-headed niece
was the lure that drew this royal tiercel. Now, despite his
affection for her, which was probably as deep as any affection his
lordship was capable of feeling, he saw here only matter for
self-congratulation. It signified little that his niece's honour
should run the risk of being tarnished, so that his own insatiable
ambitions should be served. And with the Prince on his side, the
head of a party hitherto hostile to himself, there appeared to be
no bounds to the achievements that might yet be his. Robert Cecil
was growing old and infirm&mdash;his lordship took no account of
the fact that he was himself over seventy, and the older
man&mdash;and soon now would have to make room for a new Lord
Treasurer and chief Secretary of State. It would not be the fault
of my Lord Northampton's planning if he did not succeed to that
coveted office. But not in his most sanguine moments had he
ventured to hope that the friendship of the Prince of Wales would
come to strengthen the ladder by which he meant to climb.
Therefore, he blessed the little niece who made this possible, and
was careful, by the courtier arts of which he was a master, to
remove all obstacles from Prince Henry's path.</p>
<p>The Earl became all at once of an extreme sociability, and for a
season Northampton House was rendered the scene of extravagant
gaieties. There were banquetings and dancings and masques, to which
all the Court was bidden, and there were more discreet and private
affairs, little water parties and little intimate dinners for not
more than a half-dozen, whereafter his highness would be free to
wander with the lady in the cool garden by the river.</p>
<p>But be it that the young Countess was the victim of an excessive
prudery, be it that she feared the tongue of gossip, be it that
other causes were at work, whilst the Prince's opportunities of
being in her company were abundant, his opportunities of being
private with her were scarce and fugitive.</p>
<p>Nor was this all that went to stir vexation in his highness. A
certain Sir David Wood was much about Northampton House in those
days, and he contrived, consciously or unconsciously, to put
himself damnably in the Prince's way. This Sir David was a
gentleman newly out of Spain and deep in the Earl's confidence. A
boldly handsome man, something under thirty, gay of temperament and
engaging of manners, he fell an instant victim to the beauty and
witchery of the Lady Essex. Being a masterful fellow, accustomed to
take what he lacked, and to practise an utter directness of aim, he
made no secret of the matter. He laid siege to her ladyship, was
ever at her elbow, and either did not, or else refused to, perceive
that in doing so he put himself in the Prince's way.</p>
<p>Northampton looked on aggrieved. Sir David knew too much about
his lordship and his Spanish dealings to be incontinently
dismissed. Therefore the Earl took at last the course of speaking
to his niece in mild reproof of the apparent lightness of her
conduct.</p>
<p>The suggestion offended her.</p>
<p>'In what am I light? I do not beckon Sir David, or detain him at
my side. Indeed, I find him almost as importunate as his highness.
I desire the attentions of neither. Yet I am glad to have both,
since each serves to protect me against the other.'</p>
<p>This was more than his lordship cared to hear.</p>
<p>'His highness is one, and Sir David quite another. The
attentions of a prince are not lightly to be repulsed. Loyalty
forbids it, unless those attentions should become unwelcomely
insistent. But a plain gentleman such as Sir David is easily
whipped to heel by a lady who values her good name. She needs but
to show him plainly that she values it.'</p>
<p>Her ladyship acted that very day upon this advice; although her
uncle's words were not by any means the spur that drove her.</p>
<p>Sir David dined alone with the Earl, and, as dinner was ending,
espying her ladyship in the garden, announced his intention to take
the air.</p>
<p>Scarcely was Sir David gone forth than the new Lord Rochester
was announced.</p>
<p>Robert Carr came, accompanied by the lately knighted Thomas
Overbury, to discuss with the Lord Privy Seal certain matters
arising out of letters newly received from Spain.</p>
<p>The Earl gave him the cordial welcome he reserved for all men
who might be useful to him, and conducted the twain to his
handsome, well-stocked library above-stairs.</p>
<p>Their business was soon done, and then, the day being warm and
his lordship's terrace pleasantly cool, Lord Rochester proposed
that they should remove themselves thither to discuss what yet
remained.</p>
<p>In the gardens below, my Lady Essex wandered with the assiduous
and enterprising Sir David. The gallant knight was making the most
of his opportunity, and her ladyship was listening without any
positive annoyance, for Sir David, after all, was no clumsy-footed
wooer. Chancing, however, to raise her eyes to the terrace, and
finding herself suddenly surveyed by one of the two gentlemen who
sauntered there with her uncle, she abruptly checked and the
half-smile with which she had been listening perished on her
lips.</p>
<p>My Lord Rochester paused to doff his plumed hat and to bow low
in salutation. Then he passed on with his companions.</p>
<p>Sir David looked hard at her ladyship. 'And who may be that fine
fellow?' said he, in his easy way, for he was no respecter of
persons.</p>
<p>'That is my Lord Rochester,' she answered him.</p>
<p>'Robin Carr!' he ejaculated, and he looked again, interest
quickening in his eyes as they took stock of one so famous. Then he
transferred his gaze once more to his companion.</p>
<p>'Your ladyship feels the heat!' he exclaimed in sudden
solicitude. 'You are pale.'</p>
<p>She looked up at him with her deep-blue, candid eyes, and smiled
a little wistfully.</p>
<p>'You look at me too closely, Sir David.'</p>
<p>He took the mild reproof for challenge. 'Who would not that were
blessed with the occasion? I gaze on you as I've seen them gaze in
Spain on images of worship, save that I never saw one gaze with the
half of the devotion that I feel.'</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes before his ardent glance. 'Their piety,
then, is small,' said she.</p>
<p>'On the contrary, it is great. But my adoration is still
greater.'</p>
<p>Her brows were puckered in a frown. Her tone became severe. 'Sir
David, I am no object for your adoration.'</p>
<p>'If I find you so, can I help myself? It is something none can
deny me.'</p>
<p>'My husband might. I have a husband somewhere. You are
forgetting it, Sir David.'</p>
<p>'Not fifty husbands could deny me the freedom of worshipping
you.'</p>
<p>'Yet, if you respect me, the existence of one will make you deny
yourself the freedom of uttering it.'</p>
<p>'Unless you give me leave.'</p>
<p>'How could I?' Her tone became impatient. 'You are mad, Sir
David.'</p>
<p>He fetched a sigh. His face was oddly white. He spoke in tones
of utmost humility.</p>
<p>'What do I ask, when all is said, that you should so harshly
refuse me? I offer. I do not beg. I am ready to give without
guerdon. I demand nothing in return.'</p>
<p>'Sir David, I do not understand you. It is as well,
perhaps.'</p>
<p>'Yet what I say is plain and simple. I simply announce myself
your servant now and always. Since you can give me nothing, that is
little matter. I give myself to you against your need of me. That's
all, my lady&mdash;my dear lady. Rest in the knowledge that there
lives one man at least who will adventure all to serve you. To you
it may seem a little thing ...'</p>
<p>'Surely no little thing, Sir David.' She sighed. 'Yet something
that I wish you had not said; for I can say nothing in return.'</p>
<p>He grew vehement. 'Have I asked you to say aught? All I hope is
that you will bear my words in your memory. The knowledge of that
will bring me happiness.'</p>
<p>It is difficult to credit Sir David with such abstract chivalry
as he professed. It was skilful in that on the one hand it opened a
line by which he could retreat in good order from a position upon
which his assault had been too precipitate, and on the other he
left the way prepared for a renewal of the assault should the
occasion ever offer. For that his words must touch her and linger
pleasantly in her memory he knew as surely as that she was a
woman.</p>
<p>Whilst he stood waiting, hoping for some answer, the Earl's
voice summoned him to the terrace. His opinion was required on some
question of fact or policy connected with King Philip. He gave it,
and a discussion followed provoked by Sir Thomas Overbury. The
discussion dragged on, and Lord Rochester grew evidently impatient,
for presently, leaving the group of three to talk the matter out,
he sauntered down the steps to pay his respects to Lady Essex.</p>
<p>His willingness to leave the business to Sir Thomas was no more
than his normal habit, just as nowadays it was increasingly
becoming his majesty's habit to leave affairs to the hands of his
lordship. The King adopted this course because at heart he was
indolent, hating all labours&mdash;apart from politico-literary
ones, such as his present 'Counterblast to Tobacco,' which
flattered his vanity&mdash;and detesting all business that was not
directly concerned with the raising of money. Lord Rochester,
following the King's example, entrusted affairs to a deputy,
because&mdash;unlike the King&mdash;he knew the deputy to be more
competent than himself.</p>
<p>Had Sir David been aware of this, he would have watched Lord
Rochester less closely as he joined her ladyship where she wandered
in the green alleys of the garden.</p>
<p>She wore a rose-pink gown with a short Dutch waist above the
Catherine-wheel of her farthingale, and hanging sleeves that showed
a lining of paler pink. Her golden head was covered by a cap with
side-wings coming to a little peak in the middle of her brow,
which, like her tall pickadell, was of snowy linen and flimsiest
lace. Her dark blue eyes smiled a greeting into the paler eyes of
the approaching gentleman. It was a smile which might have
increased Sir David's anxieties could he have beheld it at close
quarters.</p>
<p>The new Viscount received with becoming modesty her
felicitations upon his recent preferment. Then he spoke of Sir
David Wood, his Spanish travels, his accomplishments, his knowledge
of affairs. Thus until her ladyship interrupted him, laughing.</p>
<p>'Is it ever to be your lordship's habit to entertain me with
talk of other men?'</p>
<p>He remembered their last words, a month ago in Richmond Park,
and again their words on the occasion of the banquet to the Spanish
Ambassador, and he joined in her laughter.</p>
<p>'Not my habit, I trust. But, indeed, it seems hitherto to have
been my misfortune.'</p>
<p>'And mine, I think,' said she.</p>
<p>'Why yours?'</p>
<p>She paused a moment, hesitating; then took courage. 'I might
prefer that you should tell me of yourself.'</p>
<p>'Of myself?' He looked at her, a faint surprise upon his face.
But her eyes were averted, and the lovely, tranquil mask of her
countenance told him nothing.</p>
<p>'It is a topic on which you should be able to speak with much
authority,' said she, by way of explanation.</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' he said. 'But would I?' He laughed. 'Is his own self
a topic upon which any man dare be truthful?'</p>
<p>'Yet, if he dare not, who can be? Not his enemies, for they
traduce him out of hate; nor his friends, for they magnify him out
of love. How, then, does one learn the truth of any man?'</p>
<p>'None ever does,' said he. 'Truth is an over-elusive thing. Sir
Francis Bacon is asking through the lips of Pilate what it is. And
Sir Francis is the last man in England to supply the answer to his
own question.'</p>
<p>'You are bitter, sir,' she told him. 'I wonder why?'</p>
<p>'Neither sweet nor bitter, madam. I but study to be honest.'</p>
<p>'Honesty is another word for truth. Why trouble after that which
you say is over-elusive?'</p>
<p>He laughed again. 'You are too shrewd for me. You batter me with
my own weapons. I cry you mercy.'</p>
<p>'You shall have that from me and more,' said she on a betraying
note of gentleness.</p>
<p>His lordship looked at her, faintly wondering; and because
perhaps for the first time conscious of the bewitching appeal of
her fresh young loveliness. 'More?' he echoed. 'What more could I
presume to ask of you?'</p>
<p>'Can I tell until you ask? I have no gift of divination.'</p>
<p>'Have you not?' He was still looking at her, and a new light was
quickening in his eyes. Very softly and slowly he added: 'I wonder
is there any gift you lack.'</p>
<p>'Oh, a many, I can assure you.'</p>
<p>'But not such, I'll swear, as any man would miss or desire to
find.'</p>
<p>Her manner remained light, but her pulse beat faster. 'Now
speaks the courtier to whom truth is elusive because he so renders
it.'</p>
<p>Thus she spurred him on with natural feminine guile, which
requires no tutoring. But his lordship's eyes, wandering in that
moment from her gentle face, were caught by a metallic sheen, and,
looking through a gap in the laurel bush by which he stood, he
discovered a great gilded barge of twelve oars with the royal
standard trailing in the water astern, coming alongside the steps
of Lord Northampton's garden. Out of the canopied stern stepped a
glittering group, aptly described by Lord Rochester's next
words.</p>
<p>'What dragon-flies are these that come rising from the
water?'</p>
<p>Ahead of some four attendant gentlemen the lithe, stripling
figure of the Prince of Wales stepped briskly towards her ladyship,
until presently, beside the laurel bush which had screened him
hitherto, his highness beheld her tall companion.</p>
<p>He continued to advance, but the eagerness had departed from his
young face, the elasticity from his stride.</p>
<p>He stood bowing before her. She, wishing him at the bottom of
the river, dropped him a curtsey. My lord, bareheaded, and inwardly
almost as vexed by the interruption, offered an obeisance. Peace,
superficially, had been restored between Prince and favourite, as a
preliminary to their receiving the Order of the Garter at the same
investiture.</p>
<p>Possibly the Prince perceived that, if his complaints were in
their sequel to accomplish no more than the favourite's preferment,
he had better in future hold his peace.</p>
<p>Compliments being exchanged, his highness stared coldly into his
lordship's face.</p>
<p>'You have leave to go, my lord,' he said in curt dismissal.</p>
<p>Tone and glance combined to sting his lordship. But disobedience
was out of all question. He bowed.</p>
<p>'Your highness is gracious,' he murmured, not without sarcasm,
and would have turned to depart but that he found his loose sleeve
caught in her ladyship's grip. She had been stung with him and for
him, and far more deeply than he. So far as in her power it lay,
she would salve the wound.</p>
<p>'We will seek his lordship together,' she said demurely, in
allusion to her uncle. 'He is on the terrace there and he will be
honoured by your highness's visit.'</p>
<p>'Nay, nay,' said the Prince. 'We'll not disturb his lordship yet
awhile.'</p>
<p>She smiled brightly in answer. 'He would never forgive me if I
did not.' And, turning on her heel, she led the way.</p>
<p>Her assumption that the Prince came to visit her uncle was usual
and fully justified. Since she, herself, was no more than a casual
visitor there, it was not to be supposed that he came on her
account.</p>
<p>His highness, blaming his own hesitancy in making the point
clear to her, promised himself that he would amend it at the
earliest moment. Meanwhile, sulkily, he followed but a half-step
behind her, Lord Rochester keeping pace with him, and the Prince's
gentlemen bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>Having delivered him up to her uncle, my lady took her leave
upon a pretext that she was awaited by her mother, and so departed
in some vexation at the course of things.</p>
<p>Her departure rendered Prince Henry conscious that his visit to
the Earl was really without purpose, and very soon thereafter he
re&euml;mbarked with his gentlemen in his stately barge. He made
little attempt to dissemble his ill-humour or the source of it.</p>
<p>'Carr! Carr! Always Carr! Is there no place in the world where I
can be safe from that fellow's intrusion?'</p>
<p>He uttered the question aloud; addressing it to no one in
particular, but rather to the Universe in general. Nevertheless,
among his immediate following there was one who understood that
this was less a question than a prayer, and addressed himself to
contriving that it should be answered.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MRS. TURNER</h3>
<p>The understanding gentleman who undertook to play Providence to
his highness was Sir Arthur Mainwaring, a slight, elegant fellow of
an almost Spanish complexion and with all a Spaniard's traditional
heat of blood. He was alert, swift, ingenious, alive in every fibre
of him, expert to his finger-tips in every kind of intrigue, and
without scruples of any kind to hamper him.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur plied his nimble wits to serve his prince with a
courtier's usual hope of being served himself on the rebound. And
he went to work with all an artist's reticence, disclosing nothing
of his aims, so as not to blunt the dazzling surprise of the
accomplishment when he should present it.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur had a mistress, chosen with great discrimination: the
beautiful, clever, and equally unscrupulous Anne Turner, who
affluently maintained herself in the early widowhood to which Fate
had doomed her by the exercise of her abundant talents, enterprise,
and industry. She conducted in Paternoster Row, at the sign of the
Golden Distaff, a considerable establishment for the purveyance of
modish luxuries to the wealthy and the noble. Already she was well
known at court, and almost it might be said that she held a court
of her own wherein she was sought by great ladies who desired the
secrets of beauty and elegance which she&mdash;in her own young
person a mirror of elegance and of beauty&mdash;was induced to
dispense. She drove a brisk trade in perfumes, cosmetics, unguents
and mysterious powders, liniments and lotions asserted to preserve
beauty where it existed and even to summon it where it was lacking.
The widow of a physician of some skill, she had turned to good
account certain notebooks which he had left, containing a
serviceable collection of prescriptions of an infinitely varied
character. Among them was the recipe for yellow starch, which she
dispensed. This had become so widely fashionable for ruffs and
pickadells that of itself it had rendered her famous.</p>
<p>No less brisk was the trade she drove in fashionable appliances,
many of her own invention, and in articles of apparel, chiefly of
her own devising; whilst her services had been more than once
engaged by Ben Jonson and others to design and provide the costumes
for the masques so frequently held at Whitehall.</p>
<p>It was also rumoured that she amassed gold in another and less
licit manner: that she dabbled in fortune-telling and the arts of
divination. But such matters were only whispered, for none wished
any harm to Mrs. Turner, and it would have been dangerous to utter
these things aloud during the reign of a king who was the author of
a monument of pedantic nonsense on the subject of demonology and
who employed witch-finders to harry unfortunate old women
throughout the land.</p>
<p>A pretty, fluffy, fair little woman, sleek and luxury-loving as
a cat, Mrs. Turner provided abundantly not only for her own
expensive tastes, but also for those of her lover, Sir Arthur,
whose own unaided resources would scarcely have sufficed to
maintain him at court.</p>
<p>She owned a very pleasant country house at Hammersmith, with a
fair garden on the river, and it was the thought of this garden
which set the ingenuities of Sir Arthur's mind in movement. To
convey the Prince thither, and so earn his gratitude&mdash;and all
that this implied&mdash;should be easy when the time came. The
difficulty lay in procuring the presence there of Lady Essex. This
was a problem worthy of our gentleman's ingenuity. To its solution
he applied himself at once with diligence and confidence.</p>
<p>Circumstances opened a way for him at the outset. The Queen's
brother, King Christian of Denmark, was about to visit the English
Court. Preparations of lavish entertainment were afoot, to include
a masque&mdash;the Masque of Solomon&mdash;which Ben Jonson was
writing and for which Inigo Jones was designing and constructing
the mechanical and architectural parts. Mrs. Turner was entrusted
with the confection of the dresses for the Queen of Sheba and some
other characters in the masque.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur took an early opportunity of enlarging to Lady Essex
upon the tiring talents of Mrs. Turner, so eloquently, that he
moved her ladyship to desire to be dressed by her for the ball that
was to follow the performance. Thus was the elegant little
widow&mdash;duly informed of the ultimate purpose to be
served&mdash;introduced to the lodging of the Lord Chamberlain's
lady.</p>
<p>She was well received, and she exerted all her talents on behalf
of Lady Essex, delighting her ladyship by the gown of cloth of
silver which she fashioned for her. She showed herself of an
extraordinary assiduity, sparing no pains to achieve perfection,
and in the course of these the acquaintance ripened and widened,
enabling Mrs. Turner to display other than tiring talents which
were equally at the service of the Countess. She praised, and very
justly, the pearly beauty of my lady's skin. It was, she admitted,
beyond human power to improve it, but she had a creamy perfumed
pomade that would preserve its glorious perfection. She possessed
also the secret of a special glove to be worn of nights, which
would enhance the white beauty of my lady's hands. And she had
other beauty secrets, whose mention excited my lady's desire to
possess them, and moved my lady to use her with more than ordinary
friendliness, considering their different estates. Out of all this
it followed that on a day of the week following the Masque of
Solomon, a coach drew up at the sign of the Golden Distaff in
Paternoster Row. Out of it stepped a dainty female figure, wimpled
in grey and hooded to screen her features from the gaze of
inquisitive city folk.</p>
<p>She was admitted by a lean, knock-kneed man of perhaps fifty,
whose dress of rusty black was relieved only by a broad, unstarched
collar of lawn. His face was long and bony and sallow; all the
blood in it seemed to have fled to the thin, pointed nose. There
was a slight cast in one of his beady black eyes, and his
expression was one of sinister melancholy.</p>
<p>The young Countess shivered at sight of this unlovely usher to a
beauty-parlour.</p>
<p>Within, however, her ladyship found an air of comfort and
refinement. A portrait in oil of the late Dr. Turner, imposing as a
Privy Councillor, looked down austerely from the tall overmantel
upon his widow's pleasant, dimly lighted parlour. The floor was
strewn with aromatic herbs, which combined with the freshly cut
roses in a bowl of Italian ware to render the room agreeably
fragrant. An Eastern carpet, bright-hued, covered the long table;
chairs upholstered in red velvet stood beside it, and some delicate
pieces of Venetian glass sparkled on a tall buffet that was richly
carved with little images of nymphs and satyrs.</p>
<p>Here to her waiting ladyship came the bright little widow, all
eagerness to give welcome and service. My lady suffered herself to
be conducted above-stairs to a more spacious room, lined with
coffers and presses, whose varied contents were displayed to her
admiring and interested eyes. Thus, the Countess, who in reality
sought no more than the widow's beautifying gloves, spent a full
two hours surveying brocades for gowns, embroideries from the
Levant, laces from Flanders, comfit-boxes and scent-phials from
Italy, knitted stockings of spun silk from Spain, besides ribbons,
garters, shoulder-knots, and a dozen other fripperies of home
manufacture. And in the end she departed without the gloves,
because the widow assured her that she kept no stock of them, since
to be effective they must be freshly prepared. A pair of them
should be ready for her ladyship in two days' time.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that, two days later, my lady was again in
Paternoster Row.</p>
<p>Mrs. Turner received her with the announcement that she had
stayed in town especially in order to serve her. Now that the hot
weather was upon them, it was her custom to spend most of her time
at her country house on the river, leaving the conduct of affairs
in Paternoster Row to her woman Foster and the girls under her
charge, as well as to her man Weston. This Weston, the
unprepossessing fellow who admitted Mrs. Turner's patrons, was, she
said, a trained and able apothecary, who had been in her late
husband's service. He was skilled in making up the various pomades
and unguents to her recipes.</p>
<p>She summoned him now to bring the gloves, which had been
specially prepared. Together with these she supplied a little pot
of pomatum that was fragrant with some hyacinthine distillations,
of which Mrs. Turner asserted that the secret was hers alone. To
demonstrate exactly how it should be used, she took the Countess's
right hand in her own left, and proceeded to stroke it from
finger-tips to wrist as if applying the unguent.</p>
<p>And now there came a sudden oddness into the widow's conduct.
Midway through this operation, she abruptly checked, and the
Countess felt her hand gripped with almost hurtful firmness. Mildly
surprised, she looked up to find Mrs. Turner's face enigmatically
set. The dark eyes dilated under the arched brows, now slightly
raised; the red lips were tightly compressed.</p>
<p>'What is it?' quoth her puzzled ladyship.</p>
<p>'Sh! Wait! Don't speak! Don't move, or it will escape me. Wait,
wait!'</p>
<p>The tone, so mysteriously impressive, wrought upon the younger
woman's imagination. This and the tightened grip upon her hand, the
altered countenance and the quick excited breathing of the widow
gave her the impression of being in the presence of something
abnormal and uncanny.</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Mrs. Turner, her voice hushed almost to a whisper.
'Yes! I feel it plainly. It is all about you, like ... like a mist.
It saturates you, yet you yourself are scarcely aware of it.'</p>
<p>'What?' begged the Countess. An odd, indefinable fear began to
stir in her. 'What?'</p>
<p>'The longing, the yearning, the love that is being poured out
for you, offered up to you like an incense. It is all about you in
billowing clouds. I feel it so plainly. Oh, so plainly.'</p>
<p>'You feel it?' The Countess began to be afraid. She sought to
release her hand; but the effort was too feeble to defeat the other
woman's firmness. 'What do you mean? What do you feel? How do you
feel it?'</p>
<p>'Do not ask me how.' Mrs. Turner's tone was vehement, for all
that it remained low and awed. 'There are mysteries none can
explain; forces known to some only because they have experienced
them. I gather it all from the touch of your hand. Almost I see the
man whose longing wraps you about. He is noble and great, comely,
gallant, young; he is high-placed. High-placed. He stands near the
King, himself. And you ... And you ...'</p>
<p>She broke off abruptly, and let fall the hand. Abruptly her
voice returned to its normal pitch. 'I can tell you no more. At
least, not now.'</p>
<p>The girl was staring, wide-eyed, amazed, even troubled. Her face
had lost some of its colour; there was an agitation in her
breathing. She was in the presence of something she did not
understand, something that perplexed, disturbed, and awed her.</p>
<p>She said so frankly, and begged for explanations, a request that
seemed to shake the widow with sudden fear.</p>
<p>'Oh! I should not have told you. I should not. I could never
make you understand these forces which I do not understand myself.
They govern me; they compelled me to speak. I had no more will than
the leaf that is swept up by the breeze. Of your pity, sweet lady,
forget what I've said. Forget it.'</p>
<p>The Countess was moved by her distress. Compassionately she set
a hand upon the widow's shoulder. 'Why, so I will, since you ask
me. Say no more.'</p>
<p>'And you'll tell no one? You promise me that? It was my
affection for you betrayed me. Promise! Promise!'</p>
<p>'I promise it.' The Countess was emphatic in her desire to allay
the little woman's alarm. 'I've forgotten it already.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Turner knew too much of womankind to suppose that the
affirmation was exact, and my lady discovered it on her way home.
Far from having forgotten the little incident, she could turn her
thoughts to nothing else.</p>
<p>Those words, so oddly spoken in that hushed voice, subtly
conveying almost a suggestion that the speaker uttered them despite
herself, continued to ring in her ears.</p>
<p>'... the man whose longing wraps you about. He is noble, great,
comely, gallant, young. He is high-placed. He stands near the King
himself.'</p>
<p>To whom could these words allude but to Robin Carr: that noble,
comely, gallant young man whom her thoughts never quitted, and than
whom no man stood nearer to the King?</p>
<p>There was something as supernormal and uncanny about the matter
of the disclosure as about its manner. Lady Essex had heard, of
course, of seers and diviners, who had power to perceive distant,
past, and future things, and she believed in the reality of their
powers as implicitly as did most people in her day. It must be that
gifts of this nature were in the endowment of Anne Turner. They
were accounted unholy of origin by the general, from the King
himself who condemned them in his essay on Demonology. But did it
follow that they were really so? And, unholy or not, they touched
upon the one matter on which her ladyship passionately desired more
knowledge.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that early on the following
morning she was to be found again at the sign of the Golden
Distaff, driving the widow hard with questions which appeared to
terrify her and which she struggled fearfully to elude. Driven
mercilessly to the last ditch by the Countess's importunities, she
made a distracted appeal <i>ad miseri-cordiam</i>.</p>
<p>'Oh! I was mad, mad, to have told you what I felt. I should have
been on my guard against it. If I had esteemed you less, it would
have been easy to have found strength.'</p>
<p>'But why? Why? Where is the harm?'</p>
<p>'The harm?' Mrs. Turner's fair, winsome face was distorted by
fear; the plump body, so warm and shapely, was shivering. 'There is
no harm. There is no wrong in what I did. But there is the danger
of how others might regard it.'</p>
<p>'If that is all you fear, Anne, be at peace. No living soul
shall know of it from me.'</p>
<p>'Dare I trust you?' The widow clung to her. 'Will you promise
that?'</p>
<p>'I will swear it,' said the Countess solemnly.</p>
<p>Profusely Mrs. Turner thanked and blessed her, pronouncing her
an angel of goodness as of beauty.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, standing slim and straight, smiled gently down
upon her, chiding her for her foolishness in so unnecessarily
alarming herself.</p>
<p>'Perhaps I have been foolish,' Mrs. Turner agreed, now entirely
soothed. 'After all, it is not as if I had read the future for
you.'</p>
<p>'The future?' Her ladyship was quick to fasten upon this. She
set a hand, a fine jewelled hand, upon Mrs. Turner's shoulder.
'Would that be possible? Would it?' Eagerness and apprehension were
blended in her young face and parted her red lips.</p>
<p>Mrs. Turner recoiled, and back came the panic to her
countenance.</p>
<p>'Why do you ask? Why do you seek to probe?'</p>
<p>'Why don't you answer?'</p>
<p>'Do you seek the ruin of a poor woman who desires only your
good, my lady?'</p>
<p>Lady Essex accounted that her question, after a fashion, had
been answered.</p>
<p>'Why will you suppose that of me? How could I have any such
intentions? I need your help, dear Turner. I need knowledge of what
is to come; knowledge of ... of ...' She broke off in maidenly
hesitation, and her cheeks grew red. 'Oh, Anne! If you have this
power and you will use it for me, I will pay you well.'</p>
<p>'My God! My God!' The widow was in obvious distress. She wrung
her hands. She sped on tiptoe to the door, opened it and looked out
into the passage. They were in the little ground-floor parlour with
its Venetian glasses and cut flowers and the stern portrait of the
late Dr. Turner.</p>
<p>Having reconnoitred, the widow seemed to breathe more easily.
'My God! If Foster or one of the women should have overheard you!
It is not safe even to mention such things here. They are too
dangerous. So dangerous that I would not venture on them for all
the gold in the world.'</p>
<p>Lady Essex sighed. She was pale now, and full of hesitation.
'You give me no hope, then?'</p>
<p>'Hope?' The widow stared at her out of a face that was now
expressionless. 'What do you want of me? That I take the risk of
being burnt for a witch?'</p>
<p>'Where is the risk in serving me? I can be silent. For my own
sake I should have to be. You are forgetting that. And I would pay
you well, Anne,' she repeated.</p>
<p>At this the widow flared up. 'Have I not said that not all the
gold in the world would tempt me? I do not do such things for gold.
I drive no such trade. God be thanked, I am in no need to do so.
But ... If your need is urgent, I would do it for love of you!'</p>
<p>'Why, then ... When, Anne? When?' cried the eager child.</p>
<p>The widow smiled wryly. 'You are quick to take me up. Well,
well, you shall have your way; and I pray God I may not suffer for
it. I know no other living soul for whom I'd do so much. Nor can I
promise a deal, for my skill is not so great as that of some.
Still, what I can I'll do, since I've promised.'</p>
<p>'God bless you! Oh, God bless you, Turner.'</p>
<p>'But not here. It is too dangerous here. And I need things which
are not here at hand. Also in the peace and quiet of the country
results are better. I go to Hammersmith this afternoon. Come to me
there. Not to-morrow. Not on the Lord's Day. Come Monday. I'll give
you full directions. There we shall be quiet, and you shall have
your wish, or as much of it as I can afford you. But on your life,
my lady, no word of this to anyone, whoever it may be.'</p>
<p>The Countess, eager and grateful, pledged herself solemnly to
secrecy, and so at last departed, content.</p>
<p>Content, the widow watched her go. She should deserve, she
thought, the warm commendations of Sir Arthur.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>METHEGLIN</h3>
<p>If Mrs. Turner's black-and-white timbered house at Hammersmith
was not imposing, at least its creeper-clad exterior was
attractive, and its interior snug almost to the point of luxury,
whilst the garden, which ended in a flagged terrace above the
water, extended to some two acres, well planted with trees and
shrubs and parterres of flowers. Privet hedges enclosed a
kitchen-garden, a section of which was devoted to the growth of
special herbs, spurges, euphorbi&aelig;, and plants of a
saponaceous nature, employed by the widow in some of her
wonder-working preparations. All was well tended, trim, and neat,
like Mrs. Turner's own person. As a parapet to the terrace on the
river's brink there was a low brick wall, in which, at intervals,
little bays had been practised, equipped with seats.</p>
<p>On this terrace on a languid afternoon in July sauntered Mrs.
Turner with my Lady Essex.</p>
<p>This was the third visit paid the widow by her ladyship in the
course of a week, and so far the results had been meagre. The Fates
had given but a poor response to the sibyl's endeavours to
propitiate them.</p>
<p>On each occasion she had retired alone with the Countess to a
cool, partially darkened room, opening directly upon the garden,
and there, having locked the door, she had taken from a sandalwood
box a sphere of solid crystal of the size of an apricot, swathed in
black velvet. Her elbows resting on the small table before her, her
neat golden head in her white hands, she had sat gazing intently
into this lucent sphere, wherein she hoped to see mirrored some of
that immediate future into which the young Countess desired so
ardently to pry. In the aggregate, however, the results had been
vexatiously scanty, and they added little to what Mrs. Turner,
without any crystal to assist her, had already been able to
descry.</p>
<p>Greater success might have attended her endeavours had they not
received a check from the Countess on the occasion of the first
visit.</p>
<p>In the heart of the crystal, Mrs. Turner announced, the comely,
gallant, noble youth of whom she had formerly spoken resolved
himself out of a mist.</p>
<p>'His blue eyes gaze out at me with a longing that is akin to
pain. His lips part. He speaks a name. It is Frances. He bows his
auburn head in thought.'</p>
<p>But here the Countess had interrupted. 'Auburn? Nay! His hair is
bright gold.'</p>
<p>Instantly, in confusion, she sucked in her breath, as if she
would have sucked back the betraying words. The widow, however,
sitting as one entranced, gave no sign beyond a momentary
dilatation of her narrow eyes that she had so much as heard the
interruption. But it clearly conveyed to her two facts: that
however much Prince Henry might be enamoured of the Countess, it
was not upon him that her ladyship's thoughts were dwelling, and
that the eagerness with which the Countess desired more knowledge
concerned some other than himself. Like the Prince, this other
person must also be young, gallant, comely, and noble, and so
high-placed that he, too, stood very near the King, since so far,
it was clear, these details had described him. The matter required
reflection and information. Mrs. Turner, therefore, was carefully
vague in her disclosures, postponing any definite revelation until
she should have had an opportunity of conferring with Sir
Arthur.</p>
<p>The ingenious knight had little difficulty in naming the
gentleman so inadvertently described by her ladyship.</p>
<p>'Hair of bright gold and stands very near the King?' He frowned
a moment in thought. 'Who should it be but Carr? Plague take him!
Do you say he occupies her thoughts?'</p>
<p>'Should not you conclude as much from what I've told you?'</p>
<p>Sir Arthur considered. 'Perdition swallow both him and his trick
of commanding fortune. He finds all that he seeks; and all that he
doesn't seek, seeks him. Look, Anne, she must be turned aside.
Wound her pride. Persuade her that he is indifferent. Tell her
...'</p>
<p>'Teach hawks to stoop,' said the widow. 'You may show me what to
do, but never how to do it.'</p>
<p>So when next closeted with her ladyship in the seclusion of her
cosy bower, she peered into the gleaming orb, she beheld there a
figure which she described in greatest detail: tall, handsome,
broad-shouldered, magnificent of mien and apparel; the George upon
his breast; a jewel in his ear, gleaming through a cloud of hair of
the colour of spun gold; a little peaked beard and upturned
mostachios about a comely mouth; eyes of clearest blue that were
full of laughter; a careless attitude towards all the world.</p>
<p>The Countess listened intently, greedily, unblinking, her bosom
stirring under her bodice of green taffeta, which rose to the
throat and was there closed by a ruff, encircling her upright
collar.</p>
<p>The dreamy, monotonous voice continued.</p>
<p>'He stands so high, deems himself so secure in the King's regard
that he can be careless of the regard of others. He has lately been
preferred. The George upon his breast is newly come there. I see
great nobles bowing before him. They address him ... by name ...
"Lord Rochester."'</p>
<p>The Countess clasped her hands, leaning farther forward.</p>
<p>'But he recks little of them, or of any. Carelessness is the
greatest attribute of his nature. Love has never touched him,
cannot touch him, unless it be love of himself; for beautiful as
Narcissus, like Narcissus he is in love with his own image. Yet
there is one who, misguided, bestows her thoughts on him. Let her
poor soul beware the fate of Echo, and put this Narcissus from her
mind. He fades. A mist is forming.'</p>
<p>The widow paused. Lady Essex had sunk back in her tall chair.
Her eyes, a moment since so bright and eager, were veiled now
behind lowered lids; her hands, still clasped, had fallen listless
to her lap; the colour had perished from her cheeks.</p>
<p>Soon Mrs. Turner, still peering intently into the crystal,
announced a fresh vision.</p>
<p>'Another comes. This is he who was here before; one who, younger
than the other, yet stands even higher, and stands there by right
of birth and noble blood. His nobility is stamped upon his face. It
comes from the very soul of him. He is the Prince of Wales. He is
very earnest. Sh! He speaks. "I love you, Frances; I love you so
that I shall find you wherever you may hide yourself. Soon, very
soon we shall meet. I am coming to you now."' She paused, to add a
moment later: 'He's gone; the crystal clears. I can see no
more.'</p>
<p>She lowered her hands from her face, and sank back in her chair
with a sigh. Then with one of her brisk movements she turned her
head to glance, smiling, at her companion. At sight of her
ladyship's white face, drooping glance, and the lines of pain about
her lips, the little widow cried out in sudden concern.</p>
<p>'Why, what has happened, child, to distress you? Is't what I've
told you?'</p>
<p>A wan smile lighted momentarily the sweet, pale face. 'It is
nothing.' Her voice faltered a little, as if tears were not far
off. 'You did not tell me quite what I had hoped to hear. Perhaps
we are not meant to pry beyond the reach of our natural
senses.'</p>
<p>'Oh, dear, my lady!' Mrs. Turner was on her feet. 'Let us out
into the air. It is cool in the garden.'</p>
<p>And so they came to seek the terrace. Awhile they paced there,
then rested, and then paced again, and my lady spoke of going. But
Mrs. Turner, whose eyes ever and anon raked the bend of the river
towards Chelsea, beguiled her to linger, with talk in the course of
which she skilfully drew from the Countess a deal more of her mind
than her ladyship intended to reveal.</p>
<p>An hour or so was spent in confidences, when at last a gilded
red barge of six oars came into view rounding the bend. It kept
close to the Middlesex shore, and as it approached, two gentlemen
in plumed hats were to be seen in the stern-sheets, one sitting and
the other standing. He who stood suddenly doffed his hat and
bowed.</p>
<p>'Why, it is Sir Arthur, as I live!' cried the widow in delighted
surprise.</p>
<p>She waved a hand in almost rapturous acknowledgement of the
greeting.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur stooped to speak to his sitting companion, who
nodded. Then he issued a command to the watermen in their
beef-eater liveries, and the barge came gliding towards the little
jetty at the wall's foot.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur stepped from the vessel, and turned to proffer his
arm to the other gentleman, who, disregarding it, leapt nimbly
ashore with the easy grace of the athlete. Sir Arthur preceded him
up the steps to announce him.</p>
<p>'My dear Anne, I have so praised your metheglin to his highness,
that he must stay to taste it.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Turner gave evidence of being flustered, of being taken by
surprise. 'His highness!' she gasped, and dropped a low curtsey as
the Prince stepped up beside his gentleman.</p>
<p>Into the surprise and even vexation of Lady Essex was woven a
suspicion that here was being played a concerted scene, until she
saw the blank amazement that overspread the boy's handsome,
high-bred face with its finely arched nose and full, glowing eyes.
That he was not acting she was instantly assured. He frowned as he
turned impulsively to question Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>'You knew of this?'</p>
<p>'Of what, your highness?' The slim, dark gentleman seemed taken
aback. 'On my life,' he protested, 'I had no thought for anything
but the metheglin.'</p>
<p>The Prince uncovered, and bowed low to Lady Essex. 'This, madam,
is a happiness I had no thought to find here.'</p>
<p>Her ladyship curtsied in silence, a little trouble showing in
her eyes.</p>
<p>Almost before she realised it, she was alone with him. He had
declined the widow's invitation to go within. He would taste her
preparation of metheglin, of which Sir Arthur boasted, out here in
the cool; and she had gone off to fetch it, accompanied by Sir
Arthur.</p>
<p>Lady Essex remained despite herself in some embarrassment, born
of a desire to withdraw, which she knew not how to fulfil. The
Prince observed her as she stood leaning on the parapet, straight
and slim in her gown of pale green taffeta, her face half-averted,
her eyes upon the water and the wooded shore beyond. He addressed
her without assurance.</p>
<p>'Madam, I have said this is a happiness I had no thought of
finding here. Yet I must bless the chance.' He drew nearer, and,
standing close beside her, uncovered, leaving the breeze from the
water to ruffle the thick auburn locks about his smooth white brow.
'I hope, madam, that you do not altogether condemn it.'</p>
<p>'That were discourteous and undutiful, and I trust that I am
neither.'</p>
<p>'I am not concerned, madam, with either courtesy or duty in
you.'</p>
<p>She gave him a fleeting glance that was cool and discouraging,
as was the half-smile that flickered across her lips. 'That is a
pity, highness. For I offer both.'</p>
<p>'And nothing besides?' He was very eager.</p>
<p>'Nothing besides, I think. Your highness has no claim to more;
nor has any man unless it be my husband.' Her lips came together
firmly.</p>
<p>The Prince's face displayed his boyish annoyance. 'Your husband?
Pshaw! That's what my father would call a peasebogle. What do you
know of a husband, or he of you? Were you ever lovers ere you
entered your child-marriage? You use his name deliberately to deter
me.'</p>
<p>'If your highness perceives so much, why is it your pleasure to
ignore it?'</p>
<p>'That is a clear question, Frances.' He used her name for the
first time.</p>
<p>'But one that your highness need not be at the pains of
answering.'</p>
<p>He smiled with the least shade of bitterness. 'It were a
discourtesy not to do so. I ignore your coldness because I account
it to spring from a mistaken sense of duty.'</p>
<p>'Your highness is modest.' She turned to face the house, and
leaning against the parapet wondered would the others never
return.</p>
<p>Prince Henry bit his lip, and, as he looked at her, pain was
blent with ardour in his eyes.</p>
<p>'Why so cruel, Frances?' Abandoning all subtleties he cried out
frankly: 'I love you so deeply; so sincerely!'</p>
<p>She allowed her agitation to display itself. She spoke sharply.
'Your highness must not say these things to me.'</p>
<p>'Why not, since they are true? Why not? Is your absurd
marriage&mdash;a marriage that is yet no marriage&mdash;to make the
obstacle?'</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily. 'I have understood that my Lord
Essex was your friend from boyhood, your playmate before he became
my husband.'</p>
<p>He flushed. 'What's that to the matter? Does it make his
marriage with you less than a crime of your elders? You'll not
pretend that you love him, who was scarcely thirteen, a gloomy,
awkward boy, when you saw him last?'</p>
<p>'I need no pretences of any kind. I am a wife. That should make
me safe from other men's wooings.'</p>
<p>'A wife in name only,' he insisted. 'That is not to be a wife.
Such marriages as yours are easily annulled.'</p>
<p>'Annulled?' Almost she laughed, but without suspicion of mirth.
'And to what purpose the annulment? Or does your highness offer
marriage to follow thereafter?'</p>
<p>She looked him straightly between the eyes as she asked the
question, and she saw his glance momentarily falter, saw the flush
deepen in his face and spread to his brow. An instant he hesitated,
brought thus face to face with his own hitherto scarce considered
intentions. Then his boyish ardour and impetuosity supplied the
answer.</p>
<p>'By my faith, I will do even that, Frances.'</p>
<p>'Even that!' said she, and smiled now with very definite scorn.
'I thank your highness for the "even." There's a whole world of
revelation in that "even." It tells of sacrifice, as a last
resource.'</p>
<p>Her irony stirred his anger. 'Am I to be denied the dearest
thing in life because I am what I am?' He was passionately sincere.
'Am I to go loveless because I was born heir to the throne of
England? If so ...'</p>
<p>She interrupted him without ceremony. 'I have for you, Prince
Henry, no such love as you desire of me. Of your pity, then, do not
torment me further.'</p>
<p>From red that he had been, he now went pale. Long he looked at
her with hurt, brooding eyes, eyes in which there was something of
that bodeful look that haunted the eyes of all the Stuarts. Then he
bowed in token of absolute submission to her will, and, like Sir
David Wood, before a similar dismissal at her hands, he offered
service where love was unacceptable.</p>
<p>'I thank you for your plainness; and I honour you for it. I but
beg you to remember that my love for you remains; that I am your
servant, Frances, a friend and servant to count on in your
need.'</p>
<p>'Ah! Now you are good and generous and princely, indeed.'
Impulsively she held out her hand. He took it and bore it to his
lips. 'For this I honour you so that you almost make me regret that
I have not more to give.'</p>
<p>'I am content,' he said. 'Content to be your friend.'</p>
<p>But that was not quite all his thought. To have been entirely
frank, he must have said that he was content to be her friend until
he could be more. Lacking though he might be in worldly experience,
yet his mother-wit revealed to him that between man and woman
friendship is to be regarded as the antechamber of love, and in
that antechamber he was&mdash;since perforce he must
be&mdash;content for the present to wait with such patience as he
could command.</p>
<p>At the stage to which things had come, the return of the others
was almost as welcome to his highness as it was to her
ladyship.</p>
<p>Mrs. Turner led the way, followed closely by Sir Arthur, bearing
a tall jug. After them came Weston in a white jerkin, carrying a
silver tray on which were four Venetian glasses, fashioned to look
like agate cups.</p>
<p>The widow's metheglin, cunningly flavoured with ginger,
rosemary, betony, borage, and thyme, proved to the Prince's palate
as rare and pleasant, he protested, as Sir Arthur had promised.
Whilst they quaffed it, Weston was despatched for ale, which he
dispensed to the watermen.</p>
<p>Then, to the infinite surprise of Sir Arthur, who had supposed
that some hours would be spent here in pleasant dalliance, even at
the cost of abandoning the journey to Richmond, the Prince
announced that he must push on while the tide served. They
re&euml;mbarked and departed, leaving Mrs. Turner intrigued and
Lady Essex very thoughtful.</p>
<p>'You had no knowledge, Anne, that his highness would be
coming?'</p>
<p>'I had,' said Mrs. Turner shortly.</p>
<p>'You had!'</p>
<p>'The crystal forewarned me. Have you forgot?'</p>
<p>'And you had no other knowledge save that? Answer me
truthfully.'</p>
<p>Whether truthfully or not, Mrs. Turner certainly answered
volubly and convincingly. How should she know the intentions and
movements of the Prince of Wales? My lady did not suppose that he
corresponded with Anne Turner?</p>
<p>My lady acknowledged that she did not. She recalled also his
obviously genuine surprise at beholding her. She must, then, accept
this as a proof of the power of the crystal and of the accuracy of
the visions it presented. If that applied to the Prince, it must
also apply to Robin Carr, and what the crystal had shown concerning
him was not calculated to cast down a lady as intent as my Lady
Essex to remember that she was a wedded wife. Yet so downcast and
dispirited did she now show herself that the little widow grew
motherly towards her, and in this spirit of motherliness sought her
confidence.</p>
<p>The girl gave it as freely as those must whose hearts are
surcharged. The sum of it was expressed in the question with which
she closed the chapter of self-revelation.</p>
<p>'Is it always so in life, Anne? Do we ever seek to elude that
which pursues us, whilst as ardently pursuing that which
eludes?'</p>
<p>The widow's narrow eyes grew narrower in sly thought. Pensively
she stroked her long upper lip. Towards Sir Arthur she had done her
part, and the attitude which Lady Essex disclosed towards the
Prince appeared to put an end to that adventure, and so to all
chance of profit either for the widow or her lover. The other was a
vastly different affair. Mrs. Turner looked down a long avenue of
possibilities.</p>
<p>After a pause she sighed, and answered very softly and slowly:
'There are ways of arresting and overtaking the elusive. There are
even ways to compel it to go about and become a pursuer in its
turn.'</p>
<p>'Ways there may be. But I seem to lack the art of them.'</p>
<p>'It is an art that is known to very few. Yet it can be
practised, and it rarely fails.'</p>
<p>My lady stared at her, struck by the hint of mystery in her
tone.</p>
<p>'To what art do your refer? What do you mean, Turner?'</p>
<p>The widow took her arm familiarly. There was a new intimacy in
her manner, which seemed suddenly to sweep away what was left of
the barriers rank had placed between them. Yet, oddly enough, the
Countess of Essex, reared in such proud consciousness of her lofty
station, did not now resent it, so urgent was her need. She
suffered herself to be conducted to one of the seats embayed in
that parapet, and sat there, the widow's hand still within the
crook of her arm.</p>
<p>'You shall hear something, child, that I have never told anyone,
that I would not tell anyone but you. When you spoke just now it
seemed to me that I was hearing my own tale of some years since,
when I loved even as you tell me that you love, one who was as
unconscious and indifferent as this gallant who has caught your
maiden fancy. I speak, my dear, of Sir Arthur Mainwaring. You see I
make no secret with you. I was in despair. I was come so low that I
began to think wicked thoughts of taking my own life, since he who
was so necessary to me was so completely beyond my reach. That was
in the year after Dr. Turner died, and when I had set up my shop in
Paternoster Row. Sir Arthur used to come there with his
sister&mdash;she who afterwards married Lord Garston&mdash;and I
loved him from the moment that I first beheld him.'</p>
<p>Lady Essex reflected that love at first sight had been her own
case, too, and her thoughts went back to that day in the tilt-yard
at Whitehall, three years ago. Her ready sympathy flowed out to
this sister-sufferer from the same cruel pangs.</p>
<p>'In my despair I had recourse to the crystal,' Mrs. Turner
resumed. 'The blessed gift of scrying has been mine almost from
childhood. I first discovered it ... But that's nothing to the
matter. In the crystal I was shown a man advanced in years, a
master of medicine, astrology, and alchemy.'</p>
<p>She broke off to demand assurances before disclosing more. 'What
I tell you, child, is secret and sacred between us, not to be
shared with any, whoever it may be.'</p>
<p>Instantly and fervently the Countess, now a prey to curiosity,
interest, and hope, gave the solemn undertakings required,
whereupon the widow resumed.</p>
<p>'His name and abode were revealed to me together with the
assurance that he would supply my needs. I sought him out that
night, and told him all. He could give me my heart's desire.
Although the price was heavy, had it taken my last angel, I must
have paid it.</p>
<p>'I came away with a little phial; no more than that, and
instructions how to use it. When next Sir Arthur and his sister
came to Paternoster Row, I offered them a metheglin which I
distilled according to a wonderful receipt. It is the metheglin I
gave you this afternoon. They tasted it that day, and in it Sir
Arthur drank the contents of the phial, which I had poured into his
cup.'</p>
<p>She ceased, and sat a moment in silence, bemused, pensively
smiling. The Countess shook her by the arm. 'Yes, yes? Well? And
then?'</p>
<p>The widow continued, the passive smile still hovering about her
lips.</p>
<p>'It was in the depth of winter, a foul night of wind and sleet.
At dead midnight I was roused by a furious beating on my door. From
my window I asked who knocked, and my heart stood still to hear the
voice of Sir Arthur imploring me to open. He was drenched to the
skin and splashed from head to foot with mud. He had ridden twenty
miles through the storm in obedience, he swore, to an irresistible
impulse to come and fling himself at my feet and declare his
passion. And until that day he had scarcely been conscious of my
existence.'</p>
<p>My Lady Essex audibly drew breath. Softly the widow closed her
tale.</p>
<p>'There is not in all England I'll swear a devouter lover than
Sir Arthur has been to me since that night three years ago. Each
time I pour for him a cup of metheglin, I think of the potion which
I mixed in that first cup he had from me, and I bless the name of
Simon Forman.'</p>
<p>'Who is he?'</p>
<p>'The alchemist who wrought the miracle. There! I've let slip his
name. Forget it, my lady.'</p>
<p>Her ladyship shook her golden head. Her eyes were
preternaturally bright.</p>
<p>'On the contrary,' said she, 'I must remember it.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>MAGIC</h3>
<p>July was almost out. The weather was insufferably hot, and
Whitehall grown stuffy beyond enduring. The King, having dissolved
some months ago in a spirit of finality a Parliament too stubborn
and recalcitrant to serve his purposes, was determined henceforth
to govern Britain without the cavillings and interferences of that
vexatious body. Meanwhile, he had gone off to indulge his
increasing indolence in the comparative cool of Royston, where he
hunted and hawked for the benefit of his health. Thence almost
daily he wrote fond letters imploring his dear lad Robin to join
him.</p>
<p>My Lord of Rochester, pleading urgency of State affairs and yet
discharging none of them, lingered on at Whitehall, thereby
puzzling Sir Thomas Overbury, who so competently relieved him of
the burden of those same affairs which were the pretext of his
lingering.</p>
<p>In that workroom of theirs Sir Thomas was at his labours, whilst
his lordship, a dazzling figure in claret and silver, with violet
hose and violet, silver-edged rosettes to his high-heeled shoes,
lounged in his favourite place on the window-seat by the open
casement. His listless fingers held a couple of unfolded letters;
his pensive eyes stared into vacancy.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas glanced at him so frequently that it is to be doubted
if the secretary's interest was really in the documents upon which
he laboured. Presently he threw down his pen and leaned back in his
chair.</p>
<p>'The King has written to you again, I see,' he said, his glance
upon the sheets in his lordship's hand.</p>
<p>My lord looked at him coldly. His mood was peevish. 'You see too
much, Tom.'</p>
<p>'I need as many eyes as Argus in your service. Be thankful that
I have them.' He paused as if waiting. Then finding the pause in
vain, he resumed: 'Does the King's letter to you touch upon this
business of the Paris embassy?'</p>
<p>'No.' His lordship showed scant interest. Nevertheless, he
condescended to ask: 'What business is that?'</p>
<p>'His majesty is considering the recall of Digby. I can perceive
no reason for the step. Digby is able and punctual, and he has
served us well. Also he is well liked at the French Court. His
removal would be a blunder, and as a blunder should be
avoided.'</p>
<p>His lordship nodded almost vacantly. But this was not enough for
Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>'Do you agree, Robin?' he asked him, and roused him by the
sharpness of his tone.</p>
<p>'Agree? Oh! Ah! You'll have good reasons for what you say.
You're better informed in the matter than I am. Of course I
agree.'</p>
<p>'Then I'll draft a letter to his majesty in that sense.'</p>
<p>Again his lordship languidly nodded. 'Ay. Do so. But ...' He
checked on a thought. 'Does his majesty give no reason for
considering the change?'</p>
<p>Overbury's lips tightened in the least suggestion of a smile.
'No direct reason. But possibly an indirect one in that he names
the man whom he desires should replace Digby.'</p>
<p>'Well? Whom does he name?'</p>
<p>'Myself,' said Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>'Yourself?' It took his lordship a moment to understand. 'D'ye
mean you are offered the French embassy by the King?'</p>
<p>'No less. It's a dazzling offer that would carry my ambitions as
far as ever they've soared in dreams.'</p>
<p>His lordship's face was blank with astonishment. 'By God! The
King has grown to love you singularly on a sudden!'</p>
<p>'Is that how you read it? Oh, Robin, Robin! The King but shows
how he detests me and desires to be rid of me. And there you have
the reason for the recall of Digby clear enough, although not
expressed. He desires you at Royston with him, and to all that he
already holds against me he now adds the blame of keeping you here
at Whitehall. I am a thorn in the flesh of majesty to be plucked
out one way or another.'</p>
<p>'If that is so, why should you not profit by it, Tom?'</p>
<p>'And leave you where you now stand? That were a poor fulfilment
of the word I pledged you when I took service with you. No, no,
Robin. You and I stand together. Because you resist the King when
he would kick me out of Whitehall, he now tries to lure me away
with bribes which he hopes may outweigh my love for you. Let be.
All that's to consider is that, after all, the King's letter to me
amounts to a royal command; and that to disobey it is akin to
treason. It is not, therefore, for me to refuse the office, but for
you to put forward the sound reasons, first why it would be
impolitic to remove Digby, and secondly why you cannot possibly
dispense with a secretary so skilled as I am in foreign matters.
Shall I draft the letter for you?'</p>
<p>'In God's name,' said his lordship fervently.</p>
<p>'I'll do it to-day. Meanwhile it will help if you do as the King
bids you, and join him at Royston.'</p>
<p>'At Royston?' His lordship's look showed how distasteful was the
suggestion.</p>
<p>'In Heaven's name, why do you linger here? What do you find to
hold you?'</p>
<p>'Ah!' ejaculated his lordship, and to Overbury's annoyance fell
again to musing.</p>
<p>After a moment Sir Thomas returned to the attack: 'You neglect
your interests and your health in lingering. It is well perhaps to
make yourself desired. But within limits. For desire of any kind
can languish and perish if starved long enough. And your health
would fare better at Royston, than in the hot reek of
Whitehall.'</p>
<p>'My health is well enough.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas looked him in the face. 'I find you, like Hamlet,
"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought." You look distempered
for all your finery. Odd's my life, man, why so gorgeous? Your
clothes would keep a bishop for a twelvemonth.'</p>
<p>'Peace!' It was an irritable growl. His lordship rose. 'I am to
dine with my Lord Privy Seal.'</p>
<p>'Is that the explanation? By the achievements of your tailor, I
should judge you to be the guest of the Pope at least.' Then on
another note he added: 'You grow friendlier than may be wise with
my Lord Northampton. Nay, now, patience, Robin! For, as your
Mentor, this concerns me. This suggestion of a Spanish marriage for
the Prince of Wales has made two parties in the State where there
were three before. The Queen and Pembroke and the Prince himself
are on one side to oppose it, whilst the Howards, as Catholics and
in the pay of Spain, uphold it. The King in the r&ocirc;le of
Solomon holds the scales. Either party may prevail with him in the
end. Each party knows that it would take a long stride towards
prevailing if it could win you to its side. That keeps both civil.
Keep them so until the events shall show where the best interest
lies. I cannot think that it will lie with Spain; therefore I
counsel that you do not grow too close with that fox
Northampton.'</p>
<p>Lord Rochester considered, fingering his little beard. 'He's
very amiable and friendly,' said he slowly.</p>
<p>'From the teeth outwards. That's Henry Howard's way. The most
delusive flatterer in the world, and as false as he's sweet. No man
knows what he carries in his heart.'</p>
<p>His lordship nodded. 'Rest you. I'll practise the like by him.'
He stood in thought a moment by the table. Then, taking one of the
two sheets he held, he placed it before Sir Thomas. 'Can you
resolve this riddle for me, Tom?'</p>
<p>Overbury's attention was at once caught by the fantastic
writing. The characters were Gothic, and their elegant form
suggested a practised and scholarly penman, who chose this means of
dissembling his hand. It was intriguing. More intriguing still was
the matter it contained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chance has revealed to me the secret of a lady's heart, which my
regard and love for your lordship drives me to make known to you.
Of this lady I dare no more than indicate that your lordship is
already well acquainted with her, that she is sprung from one of
the first families in the land, that a prince pays court to her,
and that she might not remain insensible to his insistence if she
had not already bestowed her virgin heart upon your lordship, of
which your lordship is not yet aware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It bore by way of signature the legend, 'One who wishes well to
your lordship.' Sir Thomas looked up at the magnificent figure
beside him. Humour struggled with gravity on his long, pale
face.</p>
<p>'It is concise and elegantly couched. Writ by a scholar, that is
plain. So much it tells me. The rest you should be in better case
to infer than I. That is, as to who should be concerned to inform
you that the Lady Essex sighs for you.'</p>
<p>'Ah! So you, too, think that the Lady Essex is meant?'</p>
<p>'Think? It's plain. What is less plain is why anyone should be
concerned anonymously to disclose it to you. Is it a trap, by
chance?'</p>
<p>'A trap?' His lordship was startled. Then he brushed the
suggestion aside. 'Pshaw!'</p>
<p>'I am,' said Overbury, 'by nature suspicious of all things I do
not understand. It is a prudent instinct, common to all animals,
including man.'</p>
<p>'But to what end a trap?'</p>
<p>'Many things are possible. It might be to increase the discord
between yourself and the Prince, who courts her openly; to embroil
you with him. Or it might be to make an enemy for you of her
husband.'</p>
<p>'Her husband is no husband.' There was a sudden heat in his
lordship's tone. 'Besides, he is absent abroad.'</p>
<p>'He'll return one day, perhaps before long.'</p>
<p>'What, then?' The pride and arrogance which his great position
at court were engendering in Rochester flashed out in his reply.
'To oppose me were but to shatter himself against me.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas raised his brows. 'So you've considered it already?
You're gulping the bait of this letter?'</p>
<p>His lordship turned away in silence, and sauntered to the
window. He spoke presently with his back to Sir Thomas, his eyes
upon the privy garden below.</p>
<p>'It needed not this letter,' he confessed, 'to turn my thoughts
to her.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas frowned at his lordship's back, and for a moment was
very thoughtful.</p>
<p>'You are telling me that this revelation is welcome to you.'</p>
<p>'So that if it be a gin, it is one into which I must have walked
before long without any beckoning.'</p>
<p>'But being beckoned, you'll run instead.'</p>
<p>'That is the only difference. And now you know why I am glad to
dine at Northampton House. Politics have no part in this. My Lord
Privy Seal is not the attraction. I'll keep my head where he is
concerned.'</p>
<p>'By losing it to his niece. Yet the one may lead to the
other.'</p>
<p>Lord Rochester wheeled sharply. 'It is not in your mind that
Northampton may have writ that letter?'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas laughed outright. 'I was fool enough to think it for
a moment. But on reflection I perceive the thought to be an idiocy.
The Essex alliance is too valuable to the worldly Howards that they
should jeopardise it to make the daughter of their house your
mistress. Besides, they have their pride. No, no. It was no Howard
who composed this lure.' He sighed and frowned. 'If I bid you
ignore it, you'll ignore the advice. But in God's name walk warily.
You've much to lose, Robin.'</p>
<p>'I am not by nature rash.'</p>
<p>'By nature, no. But by love the most prudent lose their caution.
I trust you'll dine with a good appetite.'</p>
<p>His lordship departed to his barge, which waited at the privy
steps. He was rowed to Northampton House in a state of eagerness
such as no previous visit to my Lord Privy Seal's had aroused in
him. The letter, as he had confessed, came but to add a spur to
inclinations and longings which had been faintly astir in him since
last he had walked and talked in the same garden with her
ladyship.</p>
<p>Lady Essex was with her uncle when he arrived. Her reception of
him was graciously friendly and no more. Sir David Wood was also of
the party, and they were moderately gay at dinner, saving that her
ladyship fell so far short of her usual norm of vivacity that
presently her old uncle rallied her upon the fact.</p>
<p>He found her pale, he declared, asked her on whom she had
bestowed the delicate roses that usually blossomed in her cheeks,
and marvelled that she did not join the Court at Royston and seek
the enjoyment of the country air. She replied that she was going
to-morrow with her mother. Hitherto affairs had kept her father
fast at Whitehall, but it was now decided they should leave him
there. And all the while she was nervously fingering a slender
phial in her waist-band, containing some drops of a precious and
very costly elixir which she had purchased from Simon Forman, the
alchemist, and asking herself how she could convey it into Lord
Rochester's cup of wine. As he sat facing her across the board,
circumstances offered her no opportunity. Consequently her spirits
sank, and the vivacity upon whose diminishing her uncle had
commented became utterly extinct.</p>
<p>Disappointment was not hers alone. As the time for departure
approached, Lord Rochester&mdash;to whom the letter he had received
was as a spark to tinder&mdash;began to think that he had had his
pains for nothing in dining thus privately with my Lord Privy Seal.
But a sudden uplifting awaited him at the very last moment. As he
was taking his leave, her ladyship announced her own return to
Whitehall, and begged a place in his barge for the journey.</p>
<p>He dissembled his joy as he handed her into the carved and
gilded cabin in the stern, whose curtains he loosed, to shelter her
from the ardour of the sun and also from the eyes of the watermen
in their blue-and-silver liveries and other wayfarers upon the
river.</p>
<p>As the barge was pushed off, he took his seat beside her on the
red velvet cushions, bareheaded and tongue-tied. Fortunately she
came provided with matter for discourse.</p>
<p>'My lord, I have a favour to beg of you,' she announced.</p>
<p>'My lady, you make me happy,' said he, with such sudden
sincerity and fervour that her gentle eyes fled startled from his
glance and a tumult started in her breast.</p>
<p>She repressed her agitation, however, to make her request, and
in making it produced a folded paper. It was a petition from Sir
David Wood for certain dues, for services rendered.</p>
<p>Sir David, trading upon such interest as his avowal of affection
might have awakened, had not scrupled to use her for the purpose of
conveying this petition directly to the very fount of patronage,
rather than entrust it to the ordinary channels. And she, out of
the gentle meekness of her nature, had very readily consented,
whilst warning him that her influence with my Lord Rochester was
slight indeed.</p>
<p>She went on now to speak of Sir David's worth, his ability, and
the esteem in which her uncle held him, and was still dwelling upon
these matters when his lordship interrupted her.</p>
<p>'What signifies, madam, is that you ask it. You may count the
petition granted.' He thrust the paper into the bosom of his
claret-and-silver doublet. 'Have you no other commands for me? My
happiness lies in serving you.'</p>
<p>She could look the Prince of Wales steadily between the eyes and
chop wit with him when he spoke so. But Robert Carr's comparatively
restrained profession of service left her confused and
tongue-tied.</p>
<p>'You are very gracious to me, sir,' she answered him
mechanically.</p>
<p>His right arm was flung along the cushions and the shallow rail
behind her. He bowed his head to peer under the brim of her dark
beaver hat with its sweeping ostrich plume of green, and his glance
was at once ardent and suppliant.</p>
<p>'Could any man whom you honoured with your commands be
less?'</p>
<p>She looked up into his face. For an instant their eyes met and
held each other, and in that instant all seemed said and all
changed between them. Then her glance fled in a panic of shyness,
and the next moment he was speaking.</p>
<p>'Frances!'</p>
<p>That was the only word he uttered. But the tone of his voice
said all that was ever packed into the most eloquent declaration.
It caressed, it avowed, it claimed.</p>
<p>A pause followed. Then he leaned nearer. His right arm was
resting, though very lightly and timidly, against her shoulders;
his left hand reached across and closed upon both hers where they
lay in her lap. She made no attempt to release them. She sat very
still, scarcely seeming to breathe.</p>
<p>'Frances!' he said again, and now, in addition to the rest,
there was an insistence of entreaty in his voice.</p>
<p>Responding to it, she half-turned to him. His right arm closed
about her, and his left went round to meet it. She was in his arms,
against his breast, her eyes veiled behind lowered lids, the
half-gloom of the curtained cabin befriending them.</p>
<p>He bent his head, and kissed her lips. Thus for a long moment
they clung, and almost swooned in the ecstasy of that first
communion. Then they fell apart, to stare, half-scared,
half-laughing, each at the other, whereafter she buried her face in
sudden burning shyness upon his breast, and in her turn uttered his
name, almost upon a sob.</p>
<p>'Robin! Robin!'</p>
<p>The oars slackened, to warn these two, to whom the world about
them was just then forgotten, that they were at the privy
steps.</p>
<p>As he handed her from the barge, something slipped from her left
hand and dropped with a tiny splash into the water. It was the
phial procured from Simon Forman. The magic of its contents was no
longer needed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>SCANDAL</h3>
<p>The affairs of England represented by those heaped documents
which made ramparts about Sir Thomas Overbury's writing-table were
suffering neglect. Sir Thomas in shirt and breeches sat writing
verses. You will not find them in any edition of his Collected
Works, for these were verses written, not in his own name, but in
that of another. They were being conceived to serve the purpose of
an amatory epistle.</p>
<p>As he paused in his labours, he smiled. It was not merely that
he took a poet's complacent satisfaction in his conceits, his
rhythms and jingles. It amused him that, having lent his wits to
Carr to build him up into the simulacrum of a statesman and help
him win a king, he should now be lending them to provide him with
the garment of the complete and perfect lover and so help him win a
mistress.</p>
<p>And the thought of this mistress, also, afforded matter for grim
amusement and satisfaction to that saturnine gentleman. There
should be a pretty scandal presently, to the profound vexation of
the stiff-necked, worldly Howards, and it should effectively put an
end to any danger of alliance between them and Rochester, such as
Overbury dreaded on every ground. Therefore he addressed himself
with zest to his task on that summer morning, the morrow of the day
on which Lord Rochester had dined with my Lord Privy Seal and
brought the Lady Essex back to Whitehall in his barge.</p>
<p>His lordship had escorted the lady to her lodging in the palace,
and thence had come to Overbury hot-foot and aglow with his
success.</p>
<p>'I mind me you said once&mdash;on that day in the
tennis-court&mdash;speaking of my Lady Essex, that you could write
sonnets to her if any would buy them against his needs. Do you
remember?'</p>
<p>'I remember well; though I did not say if any would buy them,
but if the Prince of Wales would buy them.'</p>
<p>'The Prince of Wales, or another, what odds, man?' There was a
touch of impatience in his lordship's tone. 'What skills is the
capacity. I want you to exercise it now for me. And this at once.
For to-morrow I go to Royston, following your advice.'</p>
<p>'What else do you follow in going there? I hear that the Lord
Chamberlain's lady is bound thither, and no doubt her daughter will
go with her. But that's no matter. You shall have the sonnet. Tell
me where you stand that I may know how to fashion it as if it were
your own.'</p>
<p>My lord told him, and Sir Thomas was relieved to infer that the
letter in Gothic characters, if still mysterious, was, at least, no
trap.</p>
<p>The sonnet was now written, and he was adding final touches to
it, lovingly polishing it, as a lapidary polishes a gem, when
Rochester swept in, a very different Rochester from the one who had
lounged there on the window-seat twenty-four hours ago. The gloomy,
pensive man of yesterday was transfigured into a being brisk and
radiant. He came to fling an arm about the shoulders of his Mentor
and secretary, his guide, philosopher, and friend in the fullest
sense of the terms.</p>
<p>'Well, Tom? Well? And is it done? Is it done?'</p>
<p>'It is that,' said Overbury, catching as by infection something
of the other's Scottish diction. 'Look, and content you. I have
laboured on it these four hours and more. The Italian manner is
plaguily cramping. But not Ben Jonson himself could have served you
better.'</p>
<p>My lord took up the proffered sheet, and read the first line
aloud:</p>
<p>'"O Lady, all of Fire and Snow compounded ..."'</p>
<p>There he broke off in sheer enthusiasm. 'Man! That's a grand
conceit! "O Lady, all of Fire and Snow compounded!" A grand
invocation, Tom! And it expresses her finely. A soul of fire, and a
chaste purity, cold and spotless as driven snow.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas coughed. 'The image was intended to be purely
physical. The fire is in her hair, her glowing eyes, her scarlet
lips, which no doubt could be fiery upon occasion. The snow is in
her white breast and all the rest of her which we may presume to be
as white.'</p>
<p>'I see. But why not spiritual, too? Why not?'</p>
<p>'Because I would not have her suppose that you wrote either as a
fool or a mocker. A woman has no love for either.'</p>
<p>'A fool or a mocker?' My lord was frowning. He took his arm from
the other's shoulders and stood stiffly upright. 'Why must I be
either?'</p>
<p>'The talk of the Court is that his highness has singed the wings
of his puritanical austerity at her shrine. Were you not to
substitute yourself as the holocaust, it is possible that in time
he might be quite burnt up.'</p>
<p>His lordship was annoyed, and showed it.</p>
<p>'It is not possible at all. And you know it. As for the Court's
lewd talk ... Pshaw! There never was a pure and lovely flower in
any garden but slugs must be defiling it.'</p>
<p>'It's a poetical conceit,' Sir Thomas approved.</p>
<p>My lord shrugged ill-humouredly, and moved away to resume the
perusal of the sonnet. As he read, his ill-humour was dissipated;
his eyes kindled and his cheeks flushed with pleasure.</p>
<p>'Man, ye've a gift!' he cried at last.</p>
<p>'Several gifts, Robin; several; as is known to all the world,
and to none better than myself. Will the verses serve?'</p>
<p>'Serve! Good lack! It is the very key of Heaven. There's magic
in it.'</p>
<p>'A magic key! Well, well, let it unlock for you the door to the
Garden of Delight.'</p>
<p>'I'll copy it at once. Lend me a pen.'</p>
<p>'Here is the very quill that wrote it: from the pinion of
neither Pegasus nor turtle-dove as it should have been, but of a
common goose. In time you may come to find that appropriate. Men
often do.'</p>
<p>But my lord never heeded him. He went about the task of copying
the verses in his fairest hand; then folded, sealed, and
superscribed the missive and took his leave. He was departing for
Royston, whence he would write. His train of coaches was already
waiting; for he travelled, as he did all things nowadays, like a
great prince, with a state inferior only to that of the King
himself.</p>
<p>At the last moment he remembered a paper in the breast of his
doublet, and plucking it forth tossed it down upon the table.</p>
<p>'There's a petition I desire to grant. My Lord Chamberlain will
sign and seal what's needed.'</p>
<p>He departed in haste, leaving Sir Thomas to unfold and scan the
document at his leisure. Sir Thomas frowned over it. He knew little
of the career of Sir David Wood, and of that little nothing that
should entitle him to a matter of two thousand pounds from the
royal treasury. But he did know of him that he was a creature of
Northampton's, and this supplied Sir Thomas with an excellent
reason why he should cut down the claim.</p>
<p>Upon his own responsibility, then, Sir Thomas made a grant of
half the sum petitioned, leaving Sir David, should that not content
him, the alternative of suing through the ordinary channels.</p>
<p>Because he could not to a like extent be the arbiter of all
other matters in the stream of affairs that flowed daily through
his hands, the ensuing fortnight was one of heavy stress for Sir
Thomas, who in addition to ordinary work found himself under the
necessity of sending copious expositions, elucidations, and reports
to the absent Rochester.</p>
<p>Now the King had given Rochester upon his arrival a cool and
sulky reception, had upbraided him with neglect, and had allowed
his unreasonable and womanish jealousy of Overbury to transpire in
the course of these upbraidings. Robin, his majesty opined, had
made of business a pretext. The truth was that he had remained at
Whitehall because he liked better the company he found there than
that which his majesty was able to provide at Royston. Majesty was
almost in tears that night when he took Robin to task for his
indifference. And he refused obstinately to accept any explanation
other than that which his petulance placed upon the favourite's
absence. But two or three mornings later, when my lord excused
himself from hawking with the King on the ground of pressure of
affairs, his majesty had cursed like a stable-boy, climbed down
from the horse which he had already mounted, and went off raging to
have the matter out with Robin.</p>
<p>Angrily he burst into his lordship's room, and there suddenly
checked his imprecations and stared with rolling eyes.</p>
<p>At a table strewn with papers two secretaries were at work, and
Lord Rochester, in bedgown and slippers, a long document in his
hand, was pacing to and fro in the act of dictating to one of them.
He broke off as the King, all in green, booted to the thighs, a
little feather in his conical hat, a heavy hawking glove on his
right hand, rolled into the chamber.</p>
<p>They stared at each other for a moment. Then Rochester bowed,
astonishment on his countenance.</p>
<p>Where the King had come to storm, he contented himself now with
a sulky grumble.</p>
<p>'Can ye not leave all this until later? It's a fair morning,
Robbie, and the work can keep until after dinner.'</p>
<p>'If your majesty so commands. But after dinner I desired your
majesty's own word on several pressing matters. A courier from
Whitehall came in with these last night.' He pointed to the
littered table. 'Only the more urgent business has been sent on,
and it requires early attention.'</p>
<p>'To the deil with it. Let it wait!' The King was peremptory.
'Ye're pale. Ye need the air and a gallop to whip the colour to
your cheeks.' He shambled forward, and pinched them. 'Get you
dressed. I'll stay for you.'</p>
<p>'Your majesty perceives that it is no more than a
postponement.'</p>
<p>'Ay, I perceive,' and he waved the favourite away.</p>
<p>If the royal manner remained surly, the royal heart was
uplifted. Here was proof that what his Robin had told him was true.
It was affairs that had kept him from the King's side, and not any
indifference such as James had feared and too rashly assumed.</p>
<p>As they rode forth together now, the best of friends once more,
the King chid him for his zeal. To the Devil with affairs. Let him
procure more secretaries, let him so dispose that he should not be
thus overburdened. The King would not have him kill himself in the
service of the State. The State might go hang before any man he
loved should kill himself with the labour of looking after it.
Where were Cecil and Suffolk and Northampton and the rest?
Indulging themselves in idleness while his Robin's excessive
conscientiousness made a slave of him. This must not be.</p>
<p>Rochester took order to comply with the royal wishes. He
increased the powers and responsibilities of Overbury and gave him
the overt decision of practically all home affairs that were put
forward directly or indirectly for his majesty's consideration.</p>
<p>But if this left Rochester more time to devote to the King, some
of it again was consumed by his attentions to my Lady Essex, which
were now so open and constant as to be matter for comment and
gossip.</p>
<p>Their relations, so tenderly begun upon mutual physical
attraction, became spiritually enriched during those weeks at
Royston by the gifts of soul which each discovered in the other.
For Rochester, having once committed the imposture of employing the
choice elegancies of Overbury's writings, was forced to continue
Overbury in the business of supplying them. Otherwise he must have
been driven to explain the cessation of what the lady herself
described in one of her letters to him as 'the silver-dropping
stream of your lordship's pen.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, being endowed with a very fertile literary gift and
a full sense of subtlety of thought and melody of words, found in
the task some measure of that self-expression which is the craving
of every man of letters. Where Rochester in his writings would
merely have made love, Overbury made literature as well. He wrote,
in fact, precisely as he would have written had he been himself the
suitor, which at times he almost imagined that he was.</p>
<p>Into the growing amorousness of letters and verses he wove
exquisite patterns of tender philosophy and graceful poesy,
revealing coruscating beauties of mind that could not fail to
dazzle and enchant a sensitive nature.</p>
<p>Rochester in high delight observed the daily growing effect of
this wizardry of words upon the lady. In their frequent meetings,
for which the freedom of Royston gave opportunity, the theme of her
discourse would often be derived from those treasured writings.
Thus to the erstwhile mere carnal attraction provoked by the
splendid beauty of the man, came to be added this intellectual,
spiritual delight in him, transmuting her passion into an ardent
worship based on the belief that such graces of body and of soul
had never yet been combined in any single person.</p>
<p>So far the love of these two creatures, who had become
transcendentally beautiful in each other's eyes, ran a smooth if
restricted course, unruffled by the light gossip to which it was
giving occasion, but of which it remained unconscious.</p>
<p>Not until the Court's return to Whitehall in September did this
gossip suddenly assume the proportions of a scandal. It was the
fierce jealousy of the Prince of Wales that fired the train. The
talk that linked the names of Lady Essex and Rochester had reached
the ears of his highness to wound him both in his heart and in his
pride. It affronted and mortified him deeply to find himself
outbidden in the affections of this lady to whom it began to appear
to him that he had stooped. Where now was the austere wifely duty
which she had pretexted when he had wooed her? And for what, for
whom, had she passed him by? For an upstart whom he detested and
despised. Accounting this a sign of her unworthiness, his love was
transmuted into emotions akin to hatred. These flamed up in him
during a ball at Whitehall, as the radiant pair flashed past him
and were lost in the courtly throng. By an evil chance her ladyship
dropped a glove, and was unconscious of the loss.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Mainwaring, standing by, pounced upon that slender,
perfumed simulacrum of her lovely hand, and in all innocence,
hoping to deserve well for it, proffered the token to the
Prince.</p>
<p>'May it please your highness, the glove of my Lady of
Essex!'</p>
<p>The Prince stiffened and recoiled, as if shrinking from the
touch of something unclean and vile.</p>
<p>'And what have I to do with it?' he asked, in a tone that
withered the smirking courtier before him. Then his lip curled
terribly, and in a voice that carried far and rang in a score of
listening ears, 'It has been stretched by another,' he added, and
swept on.</p>
<p>Those words lighted such a blaze of scandal that my lady's
mother, the easy-going and none too scrupulous Countess of Suffolk,
awoke to the necessity of taking steps to stifle it at the source.
On the one hand there was the responsibility towards the absent
Earl of Essex which urged her to put an end to this growing and
perilous intimacy between her daughter and the favourite; on the
other there was the position and power of Lord Rochester which made
it dangerous to apply to the matter the measures she would have
taken in the case of any other man.</p>
<p>In her distraction she took counsel with her husband, who,
reduced to a like perplexity by the alternatives before them, went
off to take counsel in his turn with his uncle Northampton.</p>
<p>Northampton remained unperturbed. 'Why so fearful? It might be
turned to account. It might serve to bring Rochester over to our
side. And if we have Rochester, we have the King.'</p>
<p>My Lord of Suffolk exploded. 'And I am to pay for that with my
daughter's harlotry? God's wounds! Here's pretty counsel for a
father!' And the swarthy little man stamped about the room in a
passion, tugging at his black beard and using stout sailor oaths
from his seafaring days.</p>
<p>The old Earl, lounging back in the chair at his library table,
derided him and his milksop scruples. They belonged to some
long-dead age, he asserted. His nephew had not kept pace with the
times. After all it was worth some little sacrifice to win the King
over to their side. And when all was said, such an affair as this
with Rochester would not make Fanny any less virtuous than any
other lady at the court of King James.</p>
<p>His nephew declined to hear more. In unequivocal terms he
pronounced his uncle a ribald old man of sin.</p>
<p>'You're not even shrewd in your lewdness,' he concluded. 'For
the thing would never bring you the fruits you hope. You'll never
have Rochester as long as Rochester has Overbury, no matter what
you do or what any of us does.'</p>
<p>'So that's the source of your sour puritanism,' the old Earl
mocked him.</p>
<p>'Think so if you choose. I am going. I am going to write to
Essex and tell him that it's high time he came home and claimed his
wife.'</p>
<p>The vulture head of Northampton slewed round on its scraggy neck
so that his eyes might follow his departing nephew. 'You're a fool,
Tom, as I've always known.'</p>
<p>My Lord Suffolk slammed the door for only answer. Northampton
shrugged and sneered. Then he grew thoughtful. Perhaps Tom Howard
was not such a fool, after all. Perhaps he was right when he said
that as long as Rochester had Overbury no man should have
Rochester, no matter what price he chose to pay. The recollection
of those words reduced my Lord Privy Seal to gloomy thought. They
brought him to suspect that, but for Overbury, he would long since
have made Rochester his puppet, and, through Rochester, the King.
Never had there been such a chance of accomplishing this as now,
when Rochester might so easily be lured into the Howard influence
by Frances. But in despite even of that, Suffolk was right.
Overbury was an insurmountable obstacle. His hold upon Rochester
was something as unbreakable as it was incomprehensible to
Northampton.</p>
<p>Long he sat there, his chin upon his bony hand, his old head
full of evil thoughts from which he could hatch no practical
measures, beyond a conviction that, if Suffolk were not quite a
fool in other matters, he was certainly a fool to bring Essex home
at such a moment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AT AUDLEY END</h3>
<p>Alarums and excursions followed now upon the spread of the
scandal.</p>
<p>My Lord Suffolk, to remove his daughter from its orbit and from
the propinquity of Rochester, decreed that she retire with her
mother to the family seat at Audley End.</p>
<p>Frances, in rebellion against a decree which must separate her
from her lover, displayed for the first time some of the strength
of character and determination which underlay the sweetness of her
nature, and offered a firm opposition to parental wishes; and this,
notwithstanding that my Lord Suffolk's language became more and
more that of the rough sea-dog he had been, and less and less that
of the urbane Lord Chamberlain he was become.</p>
<p>Viscount Rochester went off in dudgeon to take counsel with
Overbury upon measures to avenge the deadly insult of Prince
Henry's words. Overbury made philosophy.</p>
<p>'You begin to perceive what a disintegrating, explosive, and
metamorphosing force is contained in love. It can exalt the timid
into heroes and spur them on to high endeavour and to glory. It can
abase the worthy into clowns and betray them into meannesses and
vileness. Prince Henry is suffering from the same distemper as
yourself. Its manifestations are different because the course it
runs is different. You prosper in it; he does not. Compassionate
him. It is humane. It is also prudent. Because, being the King's
son, he is beyond the reach of your resentment.'</p>
<p>Naturally this did not help his lordship's justifiable anger. He
desired, he made it clear, to tear down the sky in his wrath. Sir
Thomas sought to pacify him along other lines.</p>
<p>'You may safely leave his highness to the punishment of his own
conscience. He is a young man of noble and generous nature who has
been false to himself in a moment of jealous fury. So false that he
has sought to defile the very thing he worships. It is a common
expression of jealousy, and one which he will bitterly regret when
the balance of his reason is restored. I doubt if he will ever
again be able to look upon Lady Essex without shame. Leave him to
the punishment of that. You cannot send the length of your sword to
the Prince of Wales. Besides, anything that you may do will only
feed the flames of scandal. After all, it is not as if an honest
love were in question.'</p>
<p>At this Rochester flamed up again. In what was his love not
honest?</p>
<p>'In that the lady is the wife of another man.'</p>
<p>This merely brought down upon Sir Thomas a fruitless exposition
of the grotesque nature of a marriage under which the lady had
remained a maid. Sir Thomas gently opined that this was a
shortcoming which it might be left to the Earl of Essex to repair
on his return home, which should be taking place before long.</p>
<p>The scene between them was brought to an end by the arrival of a
messenger with a note from Lady Essex. It announced in
broken-hearted terms that, succumbing to parental tyranny, she
would be leaving the court for Audley End to-morrow. To equip
herself with certain necessaries she would be that afternoon at the
Golden Distaff in Paternoster Row. Would his lordship come there
secretly, to meet her perhaps for the last time?</p>
<p>His lordship went. The lady was already waiting in the parlour
with the Eastern carpets, the cut flowers, and the gloomy portrait
of the late Dr. Turner.</p>
<p>Each came to the assignation with a deal to say to the other,
all of it plentifully rehearsed in their minds on their way
thither. In each other's presence they forgot it all, or most of
it, and in each other's arms did little more than sigh and kiss and
weep.</p>
<p>What little they did say amounted to vows of eternal fidelity,
which no power, normal or supernormal, should ever shatter.</p>
<p>'I am yours, Robin, for all the days of my life,' she tearfully
assured him. 'I shall never belong to any other whatever they may
say or do to me. Essex may spare himself the pains of seeking me,
for I shall never see him. I swear I never shall. I hate him,
Robin. Oh, my dear, I wish I were dead!'</p>
<p>He stroked her head. He laid it against his shoulder, and spoke
with his lips against her cheek.</p>
<p>'If you were dead, sweet, what would be left in life for
me?'</p>
<p>'What is there left in life for us as it is? Shall we live at
all if we are doomed to live apart? Will that be life for either of
us?'</p>
<p>Thus they talked on, uttering no more than the unpractical
rhetoric of love without any attempt to be constructive, since,
poor things, they were denied the materials for all that they
desired so ardently to build. They perceived that they were made
for each other; but perceived also the insurmountable obstacles
that thrust them apart. They perceived further, and herein lay
their only little comfort, that whilst they were thrust apart
physically there was no power on earth could sever them
spiritually. In soul they were mated irrevocably, whatever might
have happened or might happen to their bodies. Passionately they
would cling to the thought of this and find in it what strength
they could against the dark days ahead.</p>
<p>And so, with repeated final embraces and tear-be-dewed kisses,
they separated at last, and on the morrow Lady Suffolk and her
daughter departed for Audley End.</p>
<p>For days thereafter Lord Rochester gloomed about the Palace of
Whitehall without a smile for anyone, until the King supposed him
ill and sent his new French physician, Dr. Mayerne, to minister to
him.</p>
<p>But not all the science which Mayerne was credited with having
brought from France could heal the desolation in his lordship's
heart. Overbury was in better case to serve his needs; Overbury,
with his nimble, facile pen and gifts of prosody, to express in
terms of fitting beauty my lord's anguish in this separation.</p>
<p>And so Sir Thomas, already overburdened with affairs in which
his lordship's part grew daily less, spent what little leisure
remained him in pouring out another's heart in song, and thus,
vicariously, bringing relief to that other heart's surcharge.</p>
<p>From Overbury's point of view this was no better than a waste of
time.</p>
<p>His own object had been fully served by the verses he had
already written. The scandal had followed and had achieved the
desired purpose in putting an end to any possibility of a closer
intimacy between Rochester and the Howards.</p>
<p>Therein Sir Thomas was well content. Like the Earl of
Northampton, he, too, had come to watch with personal interest the
failing health of my Lord Salisbury. But he was less impatient than
the old Earl, because, for one thing, he was still young and could
afford to wait; and, for another, time was his friend in that it
enabled him to consolidate his own position and Rochester's, so
that when a successor came to be required to the office of First
Secretary of State, his own established experience and ability
backed by Rochester's influence should abundantly suffice to secure
him the coveted and exalted secretaryship. He
suspected&mdash;indeed, he had evidence of&mdash;a similar ambition
in my Lord Northampton, whose qualifications for the office
combined with his rank to make him the only formidable rival. Could
Northampton by hook or by crook win Rochester's friendship, he
might prove a real danger to Sir Thomas Overbury, frustrating his
aims and leaving him to continue as Rochester's ghost with more
labour than had ever been shouldered by a Secretary of State and
none of the honours and emoluments that should accompany the
office.</p>
<p>This danger Sir Thomas now accounted set aside. However cynical
he might suppose Northampton, he could not suppose him so lost to
dignity and self-respect as to fawn for personal gain upon the hand
that had cast this mud upon the Howard escutcheon.</p>
<p>So much being achieved, he accounted all further amorous
versifying on Rochester's behalf as a tedious piece of
supererogation. He was relieved, therefore, by a letter from the
embassy in Paris, which arrived one dull November morning, and he
almost betrayed his relief it the cheerful tone in which he
conveyed its contents to Lord Rochester when his lordship paid him
his customary forenoon visit to inform himself of the day's
news.</p>
<p>Overbury spoke first of some discontent aroused in connection
with a certain monopoly recently granted. He expounded the
situation at length until his lordship, wearied and bewildered by
details which he followed with difficulty, interrupted.</p>
<p>'Yes, yes. Settle it as you deem fitting. You know more of the
affair than I do. Prepare what documents are necessary for
signature. Is there anything else of importance?'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas fingered the papers before him, considering. 'Nothing
connected with affairs. But there's something in a letter from
Digby that may interest you. When he wrote the Earl of Essex had
been some days in Paris and was on the point of leaving for
England.'</p>
<p>His lordship threw up his head; his figure stiffened, and slowly
his colour changed. For a long moment he stood staring vacantly
before him; then, with an oath, he swung on his heel, and stalked
away to the window.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas pensively studied the back of that tall, athletic
young figure so bravely arrayed in grey and gold, and he smiled a
little wistfully under cover of his beard. Then he went to fling an
arm about his shoulders, and stood there with him looking through
the closed window upon the privy garden, so melancholy now in its
winter habit, wreathed in a vague mist and sodden by the recent
rains.</p>
<p>'Take heart, Robin, and accept the inevitable. To struggle
against it is to beat your head against a wall. Courage, child.
I'll distil your anguish into one last sonnet with which you shall
write <i>Finis</i> to this bitter-sweet chapter of your young
life.'</p>
<p>'O God!' groaned Rochester.</p>
<p>'Ay, ay, it hurts. But it is inevitable as death. And who faces
death bravely kills half its terror. Accept what you are impotent
to refuse. Stab yourself once for all with that acceptance, and
then leave time to heal the wound you'll make.'</p>
<p>'Time!' Rochester was scornful. 'How could time ever heal such a
wound as that?'</p>
<p>'There is no wound of which human soul is capable which time
cannot heal, given courage at the outset. If that were not so, life
could not be lived. Time buries all that time has brought. Some
things it may not bury as deeply as others. But at least it puts
them out of constant sight, and so brings surcease of painful
recollection. It will be so with you.'</p>
<p>'Ah, never! Never!'</p>
<p>'Others have exclaimed as much and as passionately whilst
looking upon the corpse of love before Time had had a chance to use
his shovel. Yet have they survived to love again. It is one of the
laws of life. Take comfort in the assurances it brings.'</p>
<p>'It brings me none. I do not accept it. Why must I bow? Why
submit to the consequences of an infamy perpetrated by self-seeking
ambitious fools when they made this marriage between those
children? Frances knew not what she did. She was twelve years old
when they bound her, when they defiled the sacrament of marriage
out of greed. Is that defilement to stand? Is she to suffer the
horror of this stranger's embraces because of a bond in the making
of which she had no part?'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay. For indignation there is every ground. But it is the
idle indignation over a wrong that is done and cannot be repaired.
The bond was made, and cannot be unmade.'</p>
<p>'Can it not? She can be widowed.' Rochester's eyes were
wild.</p>
<p>'Lord save us! These are the days of King James I, not of Saxon
Harold. We are a law-abiding people; not savages. If you kill
Essex, in what case shall you find yourself? What grievance even
have you against the man? He is as much a victim of this bond, as
you or Frances, as impotent to untie it if he would.'</p>
<p>'Is that so certain? If he were as reluctant as Frances to
fulfil its obligations, something might yet be done.'</p>
<p>'Something that not the whole bench of bishops could
accomplish.' Sir Thomas shook his head. 'You must bow, Robin,
before the inevitable, or you'll head for madness and
destruction.'</p>
<p>To Robin this must have seemed preferable to the imminent
finality of the severance, for, yielding to the madness against
which Sir Thomas warned him, he went off that day to Audley End,
where his abrupt and wild appearance terrified Lady Suffolk.</p>
<p>For the indiscretion of this visit she upbraided him as roundly
as she dared upbraid so great a nobleman, whose power with the King
was such that if exerted to the full it might suffice to break her
husband and her entire family. She protested that what he did was
ill done. Harm enough had his indiscreet wooing already brought
upon her misguided daughter. He would add to it immeasurably if he
pursued it now when Lord Essex was on the point of arriving home to
claim his bride. Almost with tears she besought him to be generous,
to take pity upon them, and to depart at once.</p>
<p>His lordship, splashed from riding, a little dishevelled and
wild-eyed, looked into that broad, crafty, pock-marked countenance
that once had been comely, and felt himself shamed and baffled by
her reproaches and her prayers.</p>
<p>She was a large woman of a loose, untidy shape which no
dressmaker and not even the Catherine-wheel farthingale&mdash;of
antiquated proportions&mdash;could dissemble, and in her present
distress she waddled in unlovely manner up and down the hall, where
she had received him. A bright sea-coal fire burned on the wide
hearth and dispelled some of the shadows in that gloomy place, from
whose walls dead Howards and others stared down out of their
portraits.</p>
<p>Weary in body from his long ride, and weary in soul from the
sustained agony of longings unfulfilled, his lordship's courage
left him. He felt himself defeated and constrained to accept
defeat. But to depart without sight of his beloved Frances from
under a roof that sheltered her was more, he felt, than anyone had
any right to ask of him.</p>
<p>'It grieves me to distress your ladyship,' he acknowledged
almost humbly. 'It grieves me to have been the cause of so much
past distress. Let your ladyship bear with me out of some thought
for my own suffering.'</p>
<p>It was a welcome speech to her. It showed her how she might
dismiss this importunate gentleman and yet retain his precious
favour.</p>
<p>She approached him with an air of motherliness, and set a
motherly hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>'Dear my lord, I do bear with you for that. My heart is raw for
you; for you and that poor child of mine. But, my lord, you know
that no sacrifice of mine could avail against what is done. I can
only beg you, as I beg her, to be brave, and to accept what Fate
has decreed.'</p>
<p>He looked into the broad face, whose crafty eyes were now veiled
in tears, and considered that not Fate, but she and her husband in
their greed, had decreed the immolation of their child on the cruel
altar of loveless ambition.</p>
<p>'Madam,' he begged her, 'I cast myself upon your mercy, and
implore you to let me see Frances before I go.'</p>
<p>The woman's hard mouth tightened visibly.</p>
<p>'To let me see her,' he added, in accents of utter intercession,
'for the last time.'</p>
<p>'For the last time?' she echoed. She scanned his countenance.
Its beauty and dejection moved her to belief. If that was all he
sought, or was now content to seek, there could be little harm in
granting his request. Indeed, much good might follow. Once a
definite farewell was spoken between the lovers, the road of
resignation might be less difficult to tread.</p>
<p>'You are sincere?' she asked him sharply.</p>
<p>'Madam!' He placed his hand on his heart to stress the assurance
which in his tone was blent with reproach for the implied
doubt.</p>
<p>Satisfied, she herself conducted him to her daughter's bower,
and, with a promise to seek him again presently, she left him there
alone with Frances for that last farewell.</p>
<p>But in her satisfaction my Lady Suffolk reckoned entirely
without her daughter.</p>
<p>My lord found Frances seated in the bay of a window, where she
sought to profit by the last of the daylight for the piece of
embroidery upon which she was mechanically engaged, an art this in
which her skill was very great.</p>
<p>She rose at sight of him, and stood for a dozen heartbeats
staring at him as if he had been a ghost. And in that little spell
he had leisure to consider her, and was stricken to the heart by
her appearance. The roses had all faded from her cheeks; there were
dark shadows, stains of suffering and sleeplessness and weeping
under her brows and all about those gentle, wistful eyes, which he
had always known so lively and sparkling. Very slight and frail she
looked as she stood there sharply outlined against the leaded
casement and the fading daylight.</p>
<p>Then he swept across the room to her.</p>
<p>'Robin!' she whispered, and she was in his arms, laughing and
crying at once. 'Robin! My Robin!'</p>
<p>Awhile he held her mute against him, kissing her eyes, her hair,
her lips. Then, at last, she stayed him with a question: 'How have
you wrought this miracle?'</p>
<p>It brought him to himself. Brought him from the ecstasy of
contact with her to the apprehension of things and factors external
to themselves.</p>
<p>'By the charity of your mother,' he announced miserably, 'I am
suffered this occasion of bidding you farewell; of seeing you for
the last time alone.'</p>
<p>'The last time!' Gone was her suddenly risen exaltation. Dismay
had thrust it out. 'No, no! Not that! Never that!'</p>
<p>He led her gently towards the hearth, his arm about her. He set
her in a tall-backed chair, and went down on his knees beside her,
his hands clasping hers, which lay limp and cold in her lap. There
he, who hitherto had listened to no reason, talked reason to her,
the reason which others had talked to him. This out of a sense of
duty to the word he had pledged her mother. But, as Overbury would
have said, he talked reason from the teeth outwards. In his heart
there was no such reason as he uttered. He was the miserable
captive of a pledge to utterances against which all his nature and
his passion were in rebellion. Nevertheless, he was faithful to the
bond, and dwelt upon nothing but the hopelessness of their
position, the cruel necessity for final severance.</p>
<p>'Your wedded husband comes to claim you, Frances. He is on his
way.'</p>
<p>On that he closed. But where he closed, she opened.</p>
<p>'My wedded husband? I have no husband. I deny him. I repudiate
the act that made me his wife at an age when I knew not what I did.
I repudiate it. I belong to you, Robin. You may have me when you
will, all that is me. All. For I vow to you, to you and to God here
in your presence, that I shall never belong to any other man.'</p>
<p>He sought to stop her mouth with his hand. 'Dear heart! Sh! That
oath!'</p>
<p>'It is sworn, Robin, and I'll never be forsworn. Whether you
come to claim me for your own or not, yours I am; for you I'll keep
myself while I have life. And unless you come to claim me in the
end, I pray God that I may not have life long.'</p>
<p>Her wild firmness&mdash;for there was a wildness in the look and
gesture that accompanied her assertion&mdash;served only to
increase his own despair. He had hoped, perhaps, that by
resignation she would help him to the strength which he was told,
and which his own senses told him, he must in honour command. Her
more direct and simple view was devastating. She loved, and she
would possess where she loved or she would die unpossessed and
unpossessing.</p>
<p>Resentment against the fate imposed upon her swept her with
passion, brought her to her feet and away from him where he still
knelt, now empty-handed.</p>
<p>'I am waiting for my Lord Essex, to tell him what I have just
told you. I owe him nothing, for in my own self I pledged him
nothing. The pledge wrung from a little child, was not the pledge
of the grown woman. It was a child he married. Let him find the
child and take her for his own. I am not she. If, when I have
explained this to him, he should see reason, if he is a man at
all&mdash;and God knows I do not even know what he is like to look
at, into what he may have grown&mdash;if he is a man at all, he
will consent to petition the King with me to have our marriage
annulled.'</p>
<p>His lordship got to his feet with alacrity. Hope new-born lent
an elasticity to his weary limbs. Here was something all had
overlooked, something which this shrewd, lovely girl had been the
first to see. Of course, it must be so. What man of honour or of
feeling would deny a woman who met him with such a plaint and such
a demand as those which Lady Essex had announced?</p>
<p>Jettisoned then was his pledge to Lady Suffolk. The
circumstances were all changed. If Essex consented&mdash;as consent
he must&mdash;to petition the King jointly with her ladyship for
the annulment of a marriage which never having been consummated
remained no marriage in fact, whatever it might be at law, then
Rochester himself would be at hand to add his own intercessions to
a king who could refuse him nothing. The horizon so dark before was
on a sudden dazzlingly alight with a hope that was almost clear
certainty.</p>
<p>In his sudden exaltation, as he turned upon her a countenance
now radiant, and held her from him at arm's length by the
shoulders, he grew almost lyrical; and soaring in his new-born
confidence over every obstacle ended by employing the ill-omened
phrase he had used to Overbury. 'Let him know at need that, if he
insists upon your being his wife, it can only lead to your becoming
his widow.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE EARL OF ESSEX</h3>
<p>Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, arrived in England a couple of
days after Lord Rochester's excursion to Audley End, and dutifully
presented himself at Whitehall.</p>
<p>His first visit was to his father-in-law, whose letters had
accelerated his return.</p>
<p>Any hopes which Lord Suffolk might have founded upon the
personality of Essex to accomplish the conquest of Frances, and
efface from her mind all thought of the brilliant fellow with whose
name her own had been so scandalously coupled, were extinguished by
the first sight of his now adolescent son-in-law. The awkward boy
of thirteen to whom the Lord Chamberlain had married his daughter
was grown into an awkward, dull young man of twenty, incapable of
exerting charm or inspiring interest. He was short in stature,
stockily built, and clumsy in his movements. He was of a sallow
complexion, with lank black hair and heavy black eyebrows over
long-shaped eyes set in very shallow sockets. Poor of brow, he was
heavy of nose and jowl, yet the heaviness was of flesh, for the
chin was softly rounded and of small bone-structure. His mouth was
thick, obstinate, and stupid. His dress was sombre, of an almost
puritanical rigour.</p>
<p>Lord Suffolk's keen dark eyes looked him over sharply, and it
was with difficulty that his lordship dissembled his disappointment
at time's work upon this object of all his present hopes. They
exchanged compliments, and in the hope of discovering graces of
mind where graces of body were so singularly lacking, his lordship
led his son-in-law to speak of his travels. After half an hour of
it, he came to the conclusion that for all that the fellow had
learnt in his foreign wanderings, undertaken for purposes of
education, he might as well have stayed at home.</p>
<p>Then Essex spoke of Frances. He hoped that she was well,
deplored her absence from Whitehall, since he had counted upon
seeing her that very day, touched awkwardly upon the eagerness with
which he looked forward to joining her, and announced his intention
of carrying her off with the least possible delay to his place at
Chartley.</p>
<p>'I hope your lordship agrees with me that the country is the
best place for a young wife. Court life, with its idleness, luxury,
and frivolity, is unsettling. Myself I have little inclination for
it.'</p>
<p>Lord Suffolk added to his other unflattering conclusions about
his son-in-law the conclusion that he was pompous and a prig, and
he began to be really sorry for his daughter. In his reply,
however, he affected lightness.</p>
<p>'Faith, that is a matter that you and Frances must decide
between you.'</p>
<p>Lord Essex did not answer him in words, but the sudden dull set
of his face and the contraction of his brows informed his
father-in-law of the young man's deprecation of the idea that
Frances should have any part in a decision of that character.</p>
<p>The Lord Chamberlain carried him off to pay his duty to his
King.</p>
<p>In the crowded audience-chamber Lord Essex found himself an
object of interest. The true reason for this not being apparent,
his lordship was not slow to assume it due to his own
prepossessions, rank, and consequence, and possibly to the fact
that he was the son of so very well-remembered a man as his
brilliant father, who had been so great an ornament of the court of
Queen Elizabeth. In this last surmise he was accurate enough. Men
stared at him, marvelling at the disparity between himself and his
sire, almost as much as they stared at him for his wife's sake and
because of the scandal about her that was so fresh at court.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales made his way across the wide room to greet
this old playmate of his boyhood.</p>
<p>'A welcome to you, Robert! You are well advised to return. A man
should stand beside his wife. Lady Essex is too lovely a blossom to
be left to languish unguarded in the air of courts.'</p>
<p>Thus his highness expressed his content that a husband should
place Lady Essex beyond Rochester's reach, just as Rochester had
placed her beyond his own. It was very human.</p>
<p>His lordship agreed heartily, thereby provoking among those
about them some amusement which he could not understand; and he
spoke again of his early removal with her ladyship to Chartley,
where he looked forward to living simply with her and farming his
estate.</p>
<p>'Estates, like wives,' said he sententiously, 'need close
husbanding.'</p>
<p>Since men laughed outright at this, his lordship supposed that
he had been witty.</p>
<p>The King, moving leisurely down the room, was approaching them.
His majesty leaned heavily upon the shoulder of the handsomest man
that Lord Essex had ever seen, a man tall and beautifully made and
magnificently tailored in sulphur-coloured velvet. His doublet was
peaked to a tapering waist; his mantle was carelessly worn over one
shoulder; his dazzlingly white ruff was edged with little points of
gold, and above this ruff a noble golden head was nobly
carried.</p>
<p>By contrast with so much splendour of person and apparel, the
ageing monarch looked mean, boorish, and almost shabby.</p>
<p>The Lord Chamberlain presented his son-in-law, and visibly
startled the King by the presentation.</p>
<p>His majesty grunted, 'Huh! Huh!' and his eyes rolled
significantly as he slewed round his head to bestow a glance on the
magnificent favourite beside him. Fragments had reached him of the
gossip attributing to Rochester a suitor's ardent pursuit of Lady
Essex.</p>
<p>Then he gave his attention to the stocky young earl and welcomed
him in those terms of fatherly kindliness of which he could be
prodigal. Lord Rochester, meanwhile, looked down from his fine
height with hard, unfriendly, astonished eyes upon the husband of
the woman he loved. Was this dull-faced, lumpish lout the mate they
had bestowed in marriage upon his peerless Frances? It was
fantastic and horrible. Would such an oaf as this have the courage
and presumption to claim to wear the loveliest jewel of the English
Court?</p>
<p>Lord Essex spoke, answering some questions of the King's on the
subject of the French Court and the conditions of it under the
regency of the Queen-Mother, and his delivery prepossessed men as
little as his appearance. There was about him a certain ludicrous
self-sufficiency; ludicrous because assumed to cover his dullness,
the meagreness of his observations, the colourless paucity of his
expressions. By self-assertiveness of manner he sought to dissemble
the unimpressiveness of his matter; desire to convey the notion
that he was a travelled, cultured man of the world, capable of
ruffling it with the best, succeeded only in exposing his
rawness.</p>
<p>The King lost interest in him and passed on, whispering of him
presently in Rochester's ear: 'A feckless, empty dullard.'</p>
<p>Overbury, who had looked on from the background, felt his
anxieties allayed. If he was any judge of men, such an obstinate,
aggressive fellow as this would never forgo his rights, never be
persuaded to a joint petition with his countess for the annulment
of the marriage. It followed, therefore, that there must be a
speedy end to Rochester's entanglement.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sir Thomas found himself face to face with the splendid
Pembroke, the scholarly, accomplished brother of Philip Herbert,
and virtual head of the strong party which opposed the Spanish
marriage. Pembroke was observing Sir Thomas as keenly as Sir Thomas
had been observing my Lord Essex. He addressed him, a rare event,
for my Lord Pembroke made no secret of his hostility to Rochester
and those who stood by him.</p>
<p>'Your master, sir, will need now to walk circumspectly.' There
was the suspicion of a sneer upon the handsome, lofty
countenance.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas smiled pensively. 'Your lordship appears to suffer
from the same necessity.'</p>
<p>'I?' The Earl looked him over from top to toe.</p>
<p>'An innuendo based upon court gossip is hardly of the first
circumspection,' Sir Thomas explained himself.</p>
<p>'You permit yourself odd liberties.' His lordship flushed, for
he had been stabbed in a vital place. A mirror of the elegancies,
an arbiter of manners, it was his claim to contemn the vulgarities
of scandal. Yet Sir Thomas had proved him guilty of the
offence.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas's smile became one of utmost amiability. He could
excel in the art of subtly wounding.</p>
<p>'<i>Si libuerit rispondere, dicam quod mihi in buccam
venerit</i>; meaning that if I choose to reply I must be suffered
to say whatever occurs to me. Nothing else were reasonable, or
worthy of your wit, my lord.'</p>
<p>Thus he stabbed Pembroke again, and this time it was a twofold
stab. His parade of glib scholarliness towards one who accounted
himself something of a scholar, and who based his disdain of
Rochester partly upon the latter's ignorance, was in itself a
bitterness to the Earl. It deprived him of the luxury of disdaining
Overbury for the same reason; reminded him of the fact that as a
scholar Overbury's reputation stood well above his own, and was
founded upon solid achievement. He was, therefore, the more acrid
in his answer.</p>
<p>'I hope, sir, you will adhere always to the admirable principle
of frankness you expound so readily. I had not perceived it to be a
part of your equipment. In the exercise of it, will you, I wonder,
indulge my curiosity? My Lord Northampton, yonder, does he join
forces with your master?'</p>
<p>'Ah! Now you probe too deep in emptiness, my lord. What should I
know of my Lord Northampton's designs? I occupy so small a place, a
very <i>rutae folium</i>, the wrinkle of a leaf, as Martial
picturesquely has it.'</p>
<p>The great gentleman smiled disdainfully. 'In that case I must
content myself with guessing.'</p>
<p>'And you would guess, my lord?...'</p>
<p>The venom bubbled out of his lordship. 'That though at times my
Lord Northampton may have lapsed from wisdom, he will hardly lapse
so far as to lean upon a rotten staff.'</p>
<p>'It's picturesque,' said glib Sir Thomas. 'Almost as picturesque
as Martial. But it lacks his accuracy of observation. For the staff
is very far from rotten. And as for leaning on it ...' He paused to
nod in the direction of the King, who with his arm about
Rochester's shoulders was passing from the audience-chamber. 'Where
the King leans so heavily, there any lesser man may also lean with
confidence.'</p>
<p>It was true enough, as Pembroke well knew. Robert Carr had never
stood so high or so firmly planted, and it was for Overbury, who
had set him where he stood, to maintain him there by every possible
means, nor suffer him to weaken his position by any act of folly.
Pembroke, he reflected, was but one of many powerful ones who would
be ready enough to take advantage of the least gap they could
perceive in his armour. Perhaps, Sir Thomas ruminated, Pembroke
fancied that he detected one now as a result of this Essex
business, and was already sharpening his weapons in anticipation.
But Pembroke was deluded by his hopes. The personality of Lord
Essex gave security for that.</p>
<p>Rochester that night had much to say to his friend and guide on
the score of Essex, expressive of his disgust at the creature. 'To
think of Frances as the wife of such a man!' That was the burden of
his lamentation. But he made it clear that he had not drawn the
same inferences as Sir Thomas of the young earl's character; for
his confidence in the divorce not only remained unshaken, but had
been strengthened by acquaintance with the husband.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas said little. The time for words of comfort would
follow. In that confidence Sir Thomas rested. That it was well
justified the sequel was not long in proving.</p>
<p>The Lord Chamberlain took his son-in-law down to Audley End upon
the morrow. A courier had gone ahead to announce their approach,
and thus had given the young countess time to school herself into a
certain calm in receiving this husband whom she had last seen as an
awkward lad of thirteen.</p>
<p>The lad had meant little to her. The man was a horror to her
from the moment that she beheld him. Whether his short thick frame,
his heavy jowl, and foolish eyes would have revolted her if she had
not beheld at his side the graceful ghost of her lover, is matter
for speculation.</p>
<p>Her effect upon him was, from her point of view, the most
disastrous that could have been feared. He had come with a certain
curious eagerness to see how time had fashioned the woman out of
the child he had married, and he had found this woman desirable
beyond any dream he might have entertained during his years of
absence. He was in love with her, furiously and passionately, from
the moment that his dark, slow-moving eyes came to rest upon her
white, slim beauty.</p>
<p>The calm, cold dignity with which she received him served to add
fuel to the fire. How finely this cold pride became her. How much
it made her appear the great lady, most worthy to be Countess of
Essex and reign at Chartley. She suffered him to kiss her hand, and
even her cheek; and if he found both cold to the touch of his lips,
he blamed for that only the raw November weather.</p>
<p>During supper, at which he was placed beside her, little passed
between them. The Earl and Countess of Suffolk watched them
meanwhile, and particularly their daughter, with anxious eyes.
Thereafter, hoping for the best, her parents withdrew early,
leaving husband and wife alone together in the library.</p>
<p>Awhile they sat there in silence on either side of the wide
hearth, eyeing each other furtively ever and anon, in obvious
embarrassment, though the source of it was very different in
each.</p>
<p>Presently her ladyship observed in her husband's eyes the
kindling of a light of intelligence more hateful to her than their
former dullness. He rose, and crossed the hearth to come and stand
beside her chair. Then he stooped to put an arm about her,
murmuring something which if articulate escaped her comprehension.
To elude that embrace she started up and forward, and then wheeled
to confront him, standing with one shoulder to the overmantel.</p>
<p>The glow from the fire was reflected on the shimmering white
satin of her gown&mdash;for by her mother's contriving she was
appropriately dressed in bridal white. There was a glow, too, upon
her cheek-bones as if to mark the deathly pallor of the lower part
of her face. Pearls had been entwined in her bright hair. Pearls
hung upon the pearly skin of her ripening breast, of which her
modish corsage gave an ample revelation. Slim and straight, her
chin high, her eyes well above the level of her lord's, she looked
to him the most ravishingly desirable woman that he had ever seen.
And she was his to possess and to enjoy, rendered so by sacred
bonds which no human power could shatter. He exulted in the thought
as he watched her now, discovering a fresh witchery in the swift,
shy movement by which she had eluded his embrace. He must be
patient, he told himself. He must not startle this gentle, timid
creature. She was delicate and fragile as a flower, and to be
handled as tenderly. He must play the lover, and as a lover woo her
to surrender to the husband.</p>
<p>He began to speak, a note of subdued pleading in his voice, the
note proper to the humble suppliant: 'Sweet Frances ...'</p>
<p>He was checked by her suddenly uplifted hand. A jewel gleamed on
it, a blood-red ruby of great price, the gift of Carr. Her voice,
that voice of which even this dullard had caught the liquid
quality, the musical cadence, came hard as flint, forbidding.</p>
<p>'My lord, we must talk, you and I.'</p>
<p>'Why, so we must, sweetheart. But, thank God, we have all our
lives before us ...'</p>
<p>Again he was interrupted. 'Will you sit, my lord?' She waved him
to the chair from which she had just risen. Her gesture, like her
tone, was imperious. It cowed him. He obeyed. If he was dismayed,
it was not yet seriously. Women, as his little experience had shown
him, were curious creatures, to be humoured at first by him who
desires empire over them. He would be patient.</p>
<p>'This marriage of ours, my lord, into which we both entered
without any natural desire of it, at an age when neither of us
understood its meaning, without knowledge of what we did, without
any of the love that alone can sanctify a union, how do you view it
now that we have met again?'</p>
<p>That question was easily answered, especially as he perceived
how eagerly she seemed to hang upon his answer. 'How should I view
it, dear child, but as the most fortunate event of all my
life?'</p>
<p>'That is merely a gallantry of speech, my lord. I do not ask for
gallantries. I am serious. I want the truth from you. Take time to
consider if you will, my lord.'</p>
<p>'Not an instant!' he cried. 'It needs not. And what I said is no
gallantry. I have no skill in gallantry. It is the sober, honest
truth. I am in rapture ...'</p>
<p>'Leave rapture yet awhile, my lord. We are not come to it, nor
ever shall.'</p>
<p>'What's that?'</p>
<p>'That you saw me at the altar some seven years ago, we may leave
out of account at present. As man and woman we have met to-day for
the first time. You have known me now for some few hours, too few
to permit you to learn anything of me. How, sir, can you welcome to
wife a woman whom you do not know?'</p>
<p>'Dear child, I have seen you.' His tone was one of
expostulation. 'To see you is to love you. Has no one told you how
beautiful you are? Are you of such a modesty that you will not
accept the message of your mirror?'</p>
<p>He saw her lovely mouth fall into lines of scorn, saw the soft
eyes grow hard as they looked straightly, disconcertingly into his
own.</p>
<p>'You are telling me, my lord, that you desire me as a woman
...'</p>
<p>'But why not, since you are ...'</p>
<p>'A man may desire a woman as a woman whom he would not desire as
a wife. There is a difference, I think. You need not shame me by
ignoring it.'</p>
<p>Like most dullards, my Lord of Essex was not patient. Again like
most dullards, when he did not readily understand a thing he did
not perceive that the fault lay in his understanding, but assumed
that the thing was incomprehensible and, therefore, to be brushed
aside. He sprang up.</p>
<p>'Faith, if there's a difference, I do not know it, and I do not
care.'</p>
<p>'But it is necessary that you should do both.'</p>
<p>'Wherein lies the necessity? You are my wife. What more is there
to say?'</p>
<p>'My lord, you go too fast. I am not yet your wife.'</p>
<p>'Not?...' His jaw fell, his eyes stared at her from their
shallow sockets under that shallow brow.</p>
<p>'Will you please to sit, my lord?'</p>
<p>He shrugged impatiently; but he obeyed her and resumed his seat.
A man, after all, must practise patience on his wedding-night.
Later on it would be different. He meant to be her lord in
something more than name, and she should be brought to an early
perception of that corner-stone of domesticity. But for to-night
she might have her head a little longer.</p>
<p>She smiled faintly at his slight gesture of annoyance.</p>
<p>'You begin to know me, my lord. You begin to perceive that I am
less smooth than you supposed, that I can be irritating, and move
you to impatiences.'</p>
<p>He laughed in his confidence that presently he would amend all
that. She continued.</p>
<p>'Perhaps if you were to wait until you knew me better, you might
come to the conclusion which I have already reached; that a
marriage made as ours was made cannot be accounted a marriage until
at a riper age it is confirmed by mutual consent.'</p>
<p>Blank disappointment showed upon his heavy face.</p>
<p>'Do you mean that I must wait?'</p>
<p>'Not even so much as that, my lord; for this question must be
settled here to-night between us.'</p>
<p>'Question? What question?'</p>
<p>She was under the necessity of seeking words a moment. 'You
agree&mdash;do you not?&mdash;that a marriage such as ours needs
the confirmation I have said?'</p>
<p>Again he shrugged. He held out a short, stumpy hand in a
meaningless gesture. She looked at the hand, and shivered. It was,
as most hands are, an epitome of its owner. She would kill herself,
she vowed, before ever she would be pawed by such a hand as
that.</p>
<p>'If you will,' he agreed tolerantly. 'But are we not here,
together at last, to confirm it?'</p>
<p>'But the confirmation must be mutual. I have asked you, my lord,
if, now that you see me grown, it is your wish to confirm the thing
that was done before either of us was of an age to give intelligent
consent.'</p>
<p>'And on my soul I've answered you, I think. But if you will have
it again, I say again I do.'</p>
<p>'And is that all you say? Have you no thought for me? No thought
to show me a like consideration? To ask me the same question in
your turn?'</p>
<p>His impatience increased. A dull flush overspread his
countenance. 'Plague take me if I understand you!'</p>
<p>'Why, then, my lord, I must supply both question and answer.'
She made a momentary pause. Then, very white, and even trembling a
little, but keeping her eyes steadily upon him, she delivered
herself of that which was to make all clear. 'Whatever your own
wishes in the matter, I find myself unable to confirm that act of
marriage, to give my consent to it now that I have come to the age
of consent.'</p>
<p>He stared at her a long while, yet found it necessary to shift
his eyes from her clear gaze before he answered her grumblingly:
'By Heaven, madam, here's fine talk! Here's a fine welcome for me!'
He got to his feet again. 'Whether you confirm the bond or not,
you'll fulfil its obligations. You will remember that you are my
wife ...'</p>
<p>'I have told you, sir, that I am not your wife. That thing done
seven years ago, that atrocious wrong upon a couple of innocent,
ignorant children, cannot bind us in the sight of God.'</p>
<p>'Let be! Let be! It binds us fast enough in the sight of man. As
for the rest, we can wait until we get to heaven.'</p>
<p>He laughed at his profane jest with the laughter that invites
laughter. But her face remained set and stony. A shadow of fear had
entered her eyes. She had depended so confidently upon the
chivalry, the generosity of the man. She had thought it would all
be so easy; that once she explained the situation, this husband of
hers would bow to her wishes. She had not reckoned that the Earl of
Essex would have the soul of a boor.</p>
<p>'Come, child, come,' he was coaxing her, softening his voice
again. 'What's done cannot be undone, and ...'</p>
<p>'It can! It can!'</p>
<p>A ray of hope suddenly illumined her despair. That was the
maggot in his mind. This thing, he thought, was irrevocable. Once
she showed him how the deed could be cancelled, he must consent to
do her will; no man short of a lunatic would compel an unwilling
woman into wifehood. 'A marriage, the ... the ... obligations of
which are unfulfilled, could be annulled by mutual petition. If we
were to go together before the King, protesting against what was
done to us as children, telling him that we have no intention of
living together as man and wife, his majesty would not be hard upon
us. He has a kindly nature. He would not doom us to be each other's
unwilling gaolers all our lives.' She approached him by a step,
holding out her hands. 'Do you see now?'</p>
<p>His countenance slew her hopes. It was set, and almost grim, the
dark brows drawn together by a frown. Long he stared at her with
eyes whose glance grew almost malevolent.</p>
<p>This inestimable pearl of womanhood was his. So ran his
thoughts. In the hours that were sped since he had come to Audley
End that day, he had been accounting himself the happiest, the most
fortunate of men in the possession of a wife for which all men must
envy him. And now this! He was asked to relinquish her, no less. To
repress the growing hunger which the sight of her had brought him.
To the reasonableness of her plea, he gave no thought. To the
feelings which he might have aroused in her, no more. She had no
right to feelings that ran counter to the sacrament which had made
them one. She was his wife, and if at first she did not like it,
she must come to like it or it would be the worse for her. For he
most certainly did not mean to forgo a husband's rights.</p>
<p>He was angry, wounded, almost vindictive. His pride was
lacerated, his vanity torn to shreds. Yet such little prudence as
he commanded urged him for his own sake yet to be patient.</p>
<p>The embraces of such a woman to be savoured must not be
compelled. Dull-witted he might be; but not so dull-witted that he
could not perceive so elementary an article in the craft of love.
She must be won, for she was worth the winning. So he stamped his
anger and his impatience underfoot. He turned, and walked away, out
of the island of golden light from the great candlebranch upon the
table into the shadows at the room's far end, where rows of books
were dimly visible upon their shelves. He came back, and stood once
more in silence beside her, leaning his arm upon the overmantel,
his brow upon his arm, mastering himself, considering.</p>
<p>Thus in silence they stood there for some time. A log fell with
a sizzle to the hearth and a spurt of flame momentarily increased
the illumination and the heat. It seemed to rouse him. He turned to
her, and spoke gently.</p>
<p>'We will make no decision now. It were unfair, perhaps, to both
of us. You do not know me yet. If you will wait ...'</p>
<p>'I warn you that it can serve no purpose. A woman knows her
heart, my lord. I know mine. It will not change.'</p>
<p>He caught her hand in his. 'Say no more to-night!' he implored
her. 'I can be very patient, Frances. Say no more.'</p>
<p>Wearily she passed her left hand across her brow. The ordeal had
been more severe for her than he could guess. So severe that even a
postponement was now welcome. So she suffered him to kiss her
fingers, then summoned a lackey to light him to his chamber.</p>
<p>He went, poor dullard, to stifle as best he could his
disappointment on a lonely couch.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>ULTIMATUM</h3>
<p>On the morrow Lady Essex wrote at length to Viscount Rochester,
giving him the substance of that first and unloverlike interview
with her bridegroom.</p>
<p>'No man of honour or of feeling,' she wrote, 'could deny a woman
in such a matter'; and upon this she based her abiding confidence
that Lord Essex would not deny her in the end. She closed with an
appeal to her sweet Robin to love her as steadfastly as she loved
him, who was constantly in her thoughts, and with a vow of
fidelity, to be kept even at the cost of life in the unlikely event
that Lord Essex should prove deaf to the dictates of decency and
reason.</p>
<p>That letter lifted some of the gloom which in these last days
had been settling heavily upon his lordship, and there was about
him something of the old buoyancy when he went to lay it before his
counsellor and guide.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas perused it carefully. He had seen Essex, and he had
read him. He accounted her ladyship oversanguine.</p>
<p>'Lady Essex is young,' he said. 'In youth we believe what we
hope; in maturity, what we fear.'</p>
<p>His lordship, checked in his satisfaction, would have argued.
Sir Thomas spared him the trouble.</p>
<p>'It was a comment intended only to warn you to wait upon
events.'</p>
<p>'I'll wait. I'll wait.' His lordship's tone was confident.
'Meanwhile, do you write.'</p>
<p>Then Overbury understood fully why he was shown the letter. The
situation was such as to require a further flow of 'the stream of
his lordship's silver-dropping pen,' and of that Sir Thomas was the
source. These impassioned, high-flown vows demanded vows as
impassioned and high-flown in answer.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas shrugged, and wrote, counting upon his reading of
Lord Essex to render his poetical labours sterile.</p>
<p>His trust was not misplaced. For a week young Essex remained at
Audley End, making daily onslaughts upon the ramparts of what he
accounted her ladyship's unreason, and daily manifesting how
incapable he was of the patience he had promised. He carried the
war of aggression against her father and her mother, constraining
them into alliance with him to defeat his wife's obstinacy.</p>
<p>But in vain did her mother plead, her father storm in
quarter-deck terms, and her husband sullenly interject in support
of the arguments employed by one and the other. Lady Essex stood
firm as a rock before combined as before separate assaults, letting
them perceive, to their despair, that the stoutest spirit may
reside in the frailest body.</p>
<p>'If you talk until the crack of doom,' she informed them, 'you
shall not turn me from my present resolve that I will never be Lord
Essex's wife.'</p>
<p>'You are that already,' growled her husband, thus apparently
closing this line of argument.</p>
<p>'I am not. I was married without my consent being asked. And
only a monster would desire to constrain a woman into fulfilment of
such a bond. Your very insistence, my lord, but serves to make you
hateful.'</p>
<p>He stamped away to one of the tall windows of the hall in which
they were met, and stared out at the elms of the park about which
the rooks were circling noisily in the fading November
daylight.</p>
<p>Lady Suffolk, meanwhile, was answering her daughter, between
plaintiveness and irritation.</p>
<p>'This is perverse and stupid. The bond is made. Whatever the
wrong of that, it is idle now to speak of it. It is done and cannot
be undone, and it is folly and wickedness to beat your head in
rebellion against that which is accomplished.'</p>
<p>'What's done can be undone,' was the steady answer. 'It needs
but his lordship's consent.'</p>
<p>His lordship did not choose to hear because he could not trust
himself to answer without violence. He was weary of these
reiterations, and but for the restraining presence of her parents,
he might have taken a short way with her.</p>
<p>And then Lord Suffolk, heaving himself out of his chair by the
fire, broke in to swear by God's wounds that what was done could
not be undone and should not so be if he was of any account. Thus
the war of words dragged inconclusively on.</p>
<p>At the end of a weary week which had reduced them all to
despair, the Earl of Suffolk suggested to his son-in-law that he
should leave them for a while.</p>
<p>'In the pass to which things are come your case can better be
argued in your absence. Come soon again. By then I trust we shall
have brought the little idiot to some sanity.'</p>
<p>Reluctantly Essex followed the advice, and went off to occupy
his house in London, the gloomy mansion in the Strand, towards
Temple Bar, where his father had hatched the treason which had cost
him his head, the house which later, in derision of him, when he
took service with the Parliamentary forces, came to be known to
Cavaliers as Cuckold's Hall. There, pretending to busy himself with
putting the house in order, he moped and sulked for a fortnight;
finally going back to Audley End, to find things exactly as he had
left them. The only difference lay in that Suffolk, in his
exasperation with his daughter, no longer offered counsels of
patience or of prudence.</p>
<p>'She's your wife, Robert,' he said, to sum up all, 'and it's for
you to make her aware of it. I've told her that you come this time
to carry her off to Chartley. Once there, if you can't make her
docile, faith, you don't deserve her.' He set a hand on the young
man's broad shoulder. 'Take a short way with her. She's yours. Let
her know it.'</p>
<p>Thus paternally encouraged, his lordship went about taking the
short way.</p>
<p>He invaded her bower, booted and splashed as he was from his
fifty-mile ride over weather-fouled roads, and ordered out her
woman Catharine who was with her. The maid had been sewing, whilst
her ladyship was writing one of her almost daily letters to her
lover at Whitehall. Looking over her shoulder to see who entered,
she thrust the sheets into a drawer and rose to meet him, her face
suddenly white, more from anger than from fear.</p>
<p>'You are come again so soon, my lord!' she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He waited until they were alone. 'I am come, madam, to announce
to you that the time of delays is overpast.' He was very stern, but
he nowise dismayed her by it.</p>
<p>'How very like a lover! With what delicate arts you go to work
to win a woman's heart!'</p>
<p>'You had not found me lacking in delicacy if you had shown me
any kindness,' he defended himself sullenly.</p>
<p>'Like enough! But since of myself I do not choose to be kind,
you are to make me so by being brutal. You march in here, booted
and spurred, as if into a citadel which you summon to surrender.
This citadel, my lord, does not surrender to manners of that
kind.'</p>
<p>He curbed his rising temper. 'To what kind of manners do you
surrender, madam? Inform me, so that I may provide them.'</p>
<p>'To none of your providing, sir. I thought you understood.'</p>
<p>'You think too much, madam. It is a labour which in the future
you shall be spared. Henceforth it will be for me to think and for
you to act upon my thoughts.'</p>
<p>She looked at him for a long moment, and her lip curled a little
in her scorn of him.</p>
<p>'You improve with every hour of our acquaintance. You have your
whip, I see. From your tone I almost suppose it a part of your
equipment to woo me?'</p>
<p>He flung the whip from him with an oath, and sent his hat after
it. 'You have resolved to exasperate me,' he declared.</p>
<p>'That is my thought of you, my lord.'</p>
<p>He considered her dully, a flush upon his sallow face, and
considering her stroked his heavy jowl with that ineffable hand of
his. She possessed certain advantages of mind over him of which she
made him aware. Resentment of these advantages but served to harden
the obstinacy natural to him.</p>
<p>'You are wilfully perverse, my lady,' he told her. 'But it shall
not serve you. To-morrow you set out with me for Chartley. I have
been patient long enough. You are a wife, madam, and you shall
behave as one.'</p>
<p>He saw the pallor deepen in her face, and in her limpid eyes he
caught for the first time the glint of fear where hitherto he had
encountered only defiance.</p>
<p>'Even if I were a wife, sir, which I do not acknowledge, I am
not to be ordered as a slave.'</p>
<p>'You shall be ordered as you deserve,' he told her. 'If you will
be wifely, you shall find me kind and loving. If you are
rebellious, you shall find me otherwise. But in either case you
shall find me your husband and your master. Since you are given to
thinking, madam, you had best think of that.'</p>
<p>'O God!' she cried out, and then lashed him with her tongue.
'You oaf! You boor! You beast!'</p>
<p>Because he had a suspicion that his behaviour justified these
titles, he was the more infuriated. Because he knew that his
behaviour had been provoked by hers, his fury gathered strength. He
advanced upon her and took her forcibly by the shoulders,
terrorising her by his powerful grip.</p>
<p>'Madam, if I am these things, it is because you make me so.'</p>
<p>He had laid hands upon her with intent to shake her, to render
her aware of his physical strength. The mute fear in which she
suffered his touch stirred compassion to restrain him. Then that
physical contact, undertaken in anger, wrought upon him as he
paused. She was so lovely, so desirable, standing so tall and
straight in his grasp, that her eyes were above the level of his
own. Obeying his instincts he drew her gently towards him, and
softened his voice to a pleading murmur.</p>
<p>'Be kind, Frances, and as God's my life you shall find me true
and tender in my love.'</p>
<p>The word aroused her from the momentary lethargy in which she
had been suffering his embrace. She thrust against him violently
and suddenly with both hands, and so, taking him unawares, broke
loose from him.</p>
<p>'My lord,' she said, 'I want one thing only from you.'</p>
<p>He scowled his anger, embittered now by that frustration. He
snarled, then turned on his heel abruptly, and went to pick up his
hat and his whip. He stalked to the door, and there turned.</p>
<p>'No more now.' His voice was harsh. 'To-morrow we go to
Chartley. It is settled. And you go if I have to carry you there
bound hand and foot. So best resign yourself with a good grace.
You'll find it easier and pleasanter.' He went out, slamming the
door after him.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, trembling from head to foot, sat down to think.
She was at law the chattel of this oafish nobleman, who had now
clearly shown her that no consideration of kindness or generosity
would make him a party to the evasion of that law. Almost she
cursed the beauty that rendered her desirable in his eyes. But
there were other things to do. Practical things. The facts must be
faced, and met somehow.</p>
<p>That night she kept her chamber. They suffered it, humouring her
for the last time, since to-morrow her lord and master would bear
her off to Chartley.</p>
<p>But on the morrow, when they came to rouse her, they found an
empty nest, and her disappearance gave them some moments of panic
until they discovered that two horses and a groom had also
vanished. Even then their terrors were very far from allayed, and
husband, father, and mother met in council to concert a plan of
action for the recovery of that wayward girl.</p>
<p>The girl meanwhile had startled the old Earl of Northampton by
presenting herself at his house in the Strand in the early hours of
that chill December morning, and claiming sanctuary there.</p>
<p>His lordship, newly risen and wrapped in a bedgown, received her
in his bedchamber. Seated on the edge of his bed, he listened not
without sympathy to her indignant tale of this horror which they
thrust upon her. To him as to her it seemed a monstrous thing that
any woman should be flung into the embrace of a man as abhorrent to
her as was Essex to her ladyship. But going beyond that he sought
the source of this abhorrence, and, as it were, led her with him
whilst he tracked it down.</p>
<p>He pointed out to her that her attitude rested upon certain
unfortunate preconceptions, which themselves resulted from a
tenderness which had sprung up between herself and Robert Carr.</p>
<p>'And what if that be so?' she asked him. 'Is not a maid to give
her love as her instincts bid her?'</p>
<p>'A maid, ay!' he agreed, nodding his old bald head. 'But a wife
...'</p>
<p>'If I am a wife, I am also a maid; and a maid I'll be as long as
I am wife to Essex.'</p>
<p>The old man was distressed. He had never known any good to come
from struggling against the inevitable. Heartbreak was commonly the
only consequence. If Essex had been willing to petition jointly
with her, the marriage might have been annulled. But it could not
be annulled upon the petition of one party only. No law would
sanction it, since to do her right must mean to do Essex wrong. Let
her well consider that. Also let her consider the point of view of
Essex. Like her he had been bound by a contract before he was of an
age to give intelligent consent. But he had no thought to repudiate
it; he had found her all that he could have hoped and more. Who
could in reason blame him? Then there were worldly advantages to
consider. As Countess of Essex she would enjoy a great position,
that of one of the first ladies in the land. Was she to allow a
love-affair which could never come to any honourable fruition to
wreck her life and prospects at the very outset?</p>
<p>Northampton talked at length upon love, from the impersonal
point of view of a bachelor who had never taken the passion
seriously. It was a singular devastating force which swept men and
women off their feet and committed them to unutterable
extravagances and follies. But it was a force that spent itself
either by abstinence or indulgence, and often more speedily by
indulgence than by abstinence. If she would take for that the word
of one who was three times her age and who had observed a hundred
fine flaming passions fall to ashes, all might yet be well.</p>
<p>Her ladyship would not take his word for it. To her ladyship his
views seemed sordidly blasphemous. She perceived with distress
that, whilst he was reasonable and well disposed, and willing to
assist her in the minor details of her present trouble, she could
not look to this worldly, cynical old man for the heroic support
that his affection for her had seemed to promise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she was afforded the shelter of his house, and the
assurance that, when her father and her husband came to seek her,
he would do what he could to postpone the evil moment of her going
to Chartley, and even make the attempt to bend the Earl of Essex to
her ways by argument. He clearly saw, although he did not mention
it, that if the Earl would consent to the annulment, leaving
Frances free to marry Rochester&mdash;and always provided it could
be first ascertained that Rochester were as willing to become her
husband as he had been ready to become her lover&mdash;nothing
would be lost in worldly advantages, and much would have been
gained, especially for Northampton himself.</p>
<p>It was clear, however, to her ladyship that for real and
immediate help she must turn elsewhere, and that same morning saw
her at the Golden Distaff in Paternoster Row, startling Anne Turner
by her sudden appearance there and her feverish manner.</p>
<p>Weston was instantly despatched to Whitehall to fetch Lord
Rochester with all possible speed. Whilst she awaited him, her
ladyship made known her plight in fullest detail to the sympathetic
little widow. The widow, perceiving how desperate was the case,
counselled enlisting the services of Simon Forman.</p>
<p>'How could Forman help?'</p>
<p>The widow spread her hands and raised her shoulders. 'I do not
know how. But I am certain that if he would he could. He has great
power.'</p>
<p>There was no decision taken on that matter when his lordship
arrived. He came breathless from haste and eagerness.</p>
<p>'Fanny!' he cried, opening wide his splendid arms.</p>
<p>In a moment she was enfolded in them, sobbing against his
breast, and the discreet Turner had effaced herself and closed the
door upon them.</p>
<p>But after transports of mingled joy and grief, came the
consideration of action to be taken, and this proved far less easy
than kissing.</p>
<p>She laid the whole situation trustingly before him. Confidently
she waited for the advice that should redeem them both.</p>
<p>It did not come. He disappointed her. Whilst vowing with all
fervency eternal love and eternal fidelity, he could be and
continued to be glib enough; but when it came to the consideration
of practical steps, he was halting and nonplussed.</p>
<p>Almost he began to talk as old Northampton had talked. They were
face to face with the inevitable. All his hopes had been centred so
surely upon Essex doing that which honour and manhood imposed upon
him. But since Essex refused to behave so accommodatingly,
Rochester knew not where he stood or what to propose.</p>
<p>Only the death of Essex would bring a proper solution to the
difficulty. And then from this leapt another thought. He could
force a quarrel upon Essex, and attempt his life in a duel. But at
this panic seized her. Rochester might, himself, be killed, and
then what should she do? Essex was reputed skilled in arms. She had
gleaned so much. It was his only accomplishment. Never would she
consent to any such course as that.</p>
<p>But it needed no great insistence on her part to turn Rochester
from such a project. A moment's reflection showed him the folly of
it. The duel was to King James the unpardonable offence, and, even
if Rochester were to prevail both in the combat and the King's
subsequent indignation, he would face a situation in which his
marriage with Frances would have been rendered impossible by the
very act that set her free.</p>
<p>The long-drawn-out, inconclusive interview came to an end,
leaving her a despair almost more utter than that in which she had
come to it. Her disappointment distorted her judgment a little,
magnified her fears where her Robin was concerned. The difficulties
appalled him so much that he seemed ready to relinquish her. Could
it be that his love fainted at the sight of the obstacles ahead of
it? Could it be that it was diminishing already under the fret of
all these influences? She recalled the cynical words of old
Northampton on the evanescence of human passions, and to her
already overwhelming fears a fresh and terrible one was added
now.</p>
<p>Turner was her last hope. If Turner failed her, death alone
remained.</p>
<p>In that spirit she summoned the little widow.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>NECROMANCY</h3>
<p>Mrs. Turner did not fail.</p>
<p>The daughter of the opulent house of Howard could pay for such
services as were now required&mdash;prodigious, inestimable
services, fraught with great peril for those who rendered them,
and, consequently, to be rewarded commensurately.</p>
<p>And so on a dark winter's night two cloaked and hooded women,
accompanied by a man bearing a lantern and a staff, made their way
down the narrow, tortuous streets to Paul's Wharf, and there were
handed by the lantern-bearer into a waiting boat. The watermen bent
to their oars, and the tide serving they made up and across towards
Lambeth. By a footpath across fields, Weston diligently lighted
them to a tall, lonely house standing in a tangled and neglected
garden.</p>
<p>Cautiously admitted by an elderly woman after certain words
exchanged with Mrs. Turner, they were conducted to a large bare
room, dimly lighted by two candles in candlesticks of brass some
five feet tall that stood upon the bare floor. Between these on a
tripod there was a copper chafing-dish over a small blue flame,
from which a thin wisp of smoke ascended to lose itself in the
darkness overhead. The faint perfume of the sweet herbs that were
being consumed in it suffused the chamber.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, whose nervousness in this unusual adventure had
been increasing ever since she had left the house in Paternoster
Row, stood hesitating until her companion, silently tugging at her
cloak, led her across to a carved oak settle that was placed
against the farther wall. The sound of their footsteps rang loud
and hollow in that silent place, and filled her with a fear akin to
that experienced by him who treads unlawfully in another's house
and dreads that the sound may betray his presence.</p>
<p>In an eerie silence they sat waiting for some moments. Then
suddenly, with a stifled cry, the Countess shrank against her
companion. Blue lights, like stars, flickered momentarily here and
there in the gloom above them. Mrs. Turner gripped her gloved hand,
to steady her, and the Countess was grateful for that warm human
grip in this place of supernatural mystery.</p>
<p>Suddenly at the room's far end a pair of luminous hands appeared
at a height of some six feet from the ground. They seemed raised to
command. They moved vaguely to and fro for a moment, so that they,
too, appeared to flicker, with alternate glowings and vanishings.
Then they became fixed and steady, and a great voice boomed upon
the silence.</p>
<p>'On your knees! Be humble and attentive! The Master
approaches.'</p>
<p>Obedient to the command and to the tug she received from Mrs.
Turner, the trembling Countess knelt beside the widow.</p>
<p>There was a long moment's pause, and then her ladyship caught
her nether lip in her teeth to repress a scream. Where the hands
had been appeared now a human head and face, dimly revealed at the
far end of the room, where the faint candlelight was insufficient
to dispel the shadows. Its appearance was so abrupt as to leave no
conclusion possible other than it had materialised there under
their watching eyes. It was a majestic, venerable countenance, with
a high-bridged nose and a long white beard. The eyes were
undiscernible under the overhanging brow. A deep melodious voice
addressed them.</p>
<p>'Have no fear, my daughters. As you come in peace, so do I give
you welcome.'</p>
<p>The head advanced, revealing that there was a body attached to
it, a tall body in a straight gown of black velvet with a girdle of
green stones and with cabalistic emblems embroidered upon its hem.
The head was covered by a tall conical hat similarly adorned.</p>
<p>The man, moving with such slow stateliness that he seemed to
glide over the ground, the progress of his feet dissembled by his
robe, came to stand before them. He held out his hand and with it
raised first Mrs. Turner, and then her ladyship, who by now found
herself able to stand only with difficulty, so treacherously did
her limbs tremble under her. His next question, by the knowledge it
revealed, added to her terrors.</p>
<p>'What do you seek of me, Frances?' He paused, but as no answer
came from her parted lips he added: 'Dismiss your fears, and give
me your hand. Since your tongue refuses its office, your touch
shall tell me all it imports that I know.'</p>
<p>Timidly she put forth her hand. He took it and held it long in a
clasp so cold and clammy that the chill of it travelled through all
her body.</p>
<p>And then at last he began to speak; in a level, monotonous, and
colourless voice that seemed scarcely human, she heard her own
story: her marriage to Robert Devereux, her horror of this bond,
her love for Robert Carr, and her ardent desire for happiness in
this bond.</p>
<p>At last he loosed her hand.</p>
<p>'So much your touch has told me. What you desire of me, you must
tell me with your own lips, my daughter.'</p>
<p>She found her voice at last to whisper: 'Your help to resolve
these troubles.'</p>
<p>And now Mrs. Turner came to her assistance. Standing with folded
hands and lowered head, almost in an attitude of prayer, and
addressing this awe-inspiring man as Father, she told him that she
had brought her ladyship in the hope that just as his dread skill
had power to kindle love so it might have power to stifle it, and
that he would of his infinite compassion and benevolence exercise
that skill on her unfortunate sister's behalf.</p>
<p>Dr. Simon Forman heard her out in silence, and in silence turned
away when she had done. Whatever else may have been spurious about
him, his doctor's title at least was genuine. He was a graduate of
Jesus College, Cambridge&mdash;having taken his degree late in life
and after many harsh vicissitudes, including a prosecution by the
College of Physicians. He possessed great skill as a bone-setter
and was endowed with that other curious gift of healing the King's
sickness by touch alone. This gift and a certain epileptic
exaltation of fancy which included the faculty of self-deception,
besides the great profits to be derived from occult practices, may
have been responsible for leading him to become a warlock.</p>
<p>Turning from the women now, he proceeded to draw with chalk on
the floor a wide circle which had for centre the tripod with its
flanking candlesticks. Within this circle he drew a second one, and
in the belt between the two he sketched with incredible rapidity a
number of symbols which were meaningless then to the awed eyes of
the Countess, but which Mrs. Turner was later to inform her
represented the twelve zodiacal signs.</p>
<p>When this was accomplished, he passed with that solemn,
leisurely step of his to a low writing-pulpit of carved oak, which,
with the stool set before it, completed the furnishing of that
place of mystery. On this desk stood an immense volume bound in
black velvet and closed by ponderous brass clasps, an antique brass
lamp of Roman pattern, an hour-glass, a human skull, and a metal
bowl. This bowl Dr. Forman now took up, and he came back with it to
stand immediately before the tripod, across which he faced the
women. Solemnly he beckoned them.</p>
<p>'Come ye within the circle, my daughters, before my invocation
begins. Within its sheltering span you will be safe from all foes
among the spirits I am about to summon.'</p>
<p>Obediently, the Countess suffered herself to be drawn within
that belt of chalk.</p>
<p>'Beware lest you step outside that circle,' he admonished them.
'Beyond it I have no power to curb the forces that will presently
be here, and I cannot answer for your lives.'</p>
<p>With a shiver of fear her ladyship drew closer to her companion.
Had that which she sought been obtainable by any other than these
terrible means, she must by now be regretting that she had
come.</p>
<p>Taking a handful of some substance from the bowl, the
necromancer flung it into the chafing-dish. Explosively a great
blue flame leapt up and vanished, to be followed by a pillar of
black smoke which spread so that in a moment all was utter
darkness. The candle-flames gradually shrank and were finally
extinguished.</p>
<p>Cold with increasing fear, her ladyship sought warmth by still
closer contact with her companion.</p>
<p>Then from out of the darkness came the doctor's voice, muttering
rapidly and presumably in some foreign tongue, for no word of what
he said was intelligible to his listeners.</p>
<p>Again a blue flame leapt from the chafing-dish to reveal the
room as in a lightning flash and the doctor standing erect with one
arm raised in a gesture of command. As darkness fell again, his
voice rang loud and imperious in a call which he thrice repeated.
Yet a third time was the darkness split by that same flame, and as
it vanished the doctor's cry resounded again upon that same
commanding note.</p>
<p>Followed a moment's utter silence, and then a faint noise, which
grew rapidly in volume until it resembled the rush of a mighty wind
or the beating upon the air of a multitude of wings. After that,
silence again, a silence such as it seemed to the Countess that she
had never yet experienced, the utter stillness of the void.</p>
<p>Gradually then in the darkness before her she beheld a vague
human face, aglow and flickering as if it were a face of fire. It
seemed, as she watched it, to resolve itself into definite form,
and she recognised&mdash;and was relieved to recognise&mdash;the
features of the doctor. An instant later, she perceived that the
weird apparitional effect was produced by a faint reddish glow
arising from the chafing-dish. He appeared to be gazing down into
the heart of this dish, wherein some substances smouldered, and his
lips moved the while with a soft sibilant whispering in that same
strange tongue that he had used before. Thus awhile, then the lips
were still, the eyes intent. Slowly the face thus seen grew dim and
at long last vanished with the extinction of those smouldering
substances. The darkness was now complete again. Out of it the
doctor's voice rang loud and firm.</p>
<p>'Enough! Begone! Avaunt! In your dread Master's name I charge
you to depart.'</p>
<p>Again the air vibrated with that rushing sound, like the gust of
some terrific hurricane which sent the Countess cowering once more
against her companion. Gradually the sound receded and died down,
until the silence was restored, and then, to set a climax to these
marvels, the candles were alight again of their own accord. Once
more their surroundings were dimly visible and the doctor was to be
seen standing beyond the tripod.</p>
<p>'All is now well,' he said. 'You may move in safety and without
fear. Also, my daughter, I may give you hope. The spirits have
pointed the way. Study will resolve the rest. By to-morrow I shall
have sure news for you.'</p>
<p>He came round to the women, moving ever with his stately,
deliberate step.</p>
<p>'Depart in peace, my daughters,' he bade them, and held out his
long bony hand with a regal gesture. A green stone glowed from its
third finger. Mrs. Turner to set the example took the extended
hand, and, going down on one knee, humbly pressed her lips to the
magic ring. As he continued, thereafter, to proffer the hand, the
high-born daughter of the Howards, nudged by her guide, abased
herself in like manner before the warlock.</p>
<p>He folded his hands within the capacious sleeves of his black
gown, inclined his head to them, and walked majestically away into
the shadows, among which finally he vanished as he had appeared,
vanished as if he had walked unfalteringly into the wall.</p>
<p>The door behind them opened abruptly with a clang and apparently
without human agency. The Countess jumped in terror at the sound.
Mrs. Turner took her firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>'Come,' she whispered in an awed voice. 'There is no more to do
to-night.'</p>
<p>When presently her ladyship found herself once more following
the swinging lantern borne by Weston along the field-path towards
the faintly gleaming water, breathing once more the pure cold air
of the winter's night, all that she had gone through seemed to her
a fantastic dream. By comparison with the terrors aroused by that
eerie experience, she felt fearless now in the midnight loneliness
of the fields. But as physical fear receded, so the misgivings of
her spirit returned, and they abode with her until the following
noon, when the result of the doctor's studies guided by the
indications of the spirits was made known.</p>
<p>She had returned to Paternoster Row with Anne Turner, who from
being her dressmaker had gradually become her friend and was now
her confidante and accomplice. She had spent there what remained of
the night and she was but newly risen when the doctor's messenger
arrived with a letter, which filled the widow with joy on behalf of
Lady Essex.</p>
<p>Guided by the conjured spirits, Dr. Forman had discovered the
formula for a powder which could effectively still the yearnings of
love, and counteract attraction in such a degree as to transmute it
into repulsion. The preparation of the powder was simple and could
be speedily effected if the ingredients were supplied. The chief of
these was a sublimation of pearls, which were first to be melted
down and distilled. To this were to be added some simpler elements
including some drops of her ladyship's blood.</p>
<p>It was left for Mrs. Turner, who was constantly revealing her
great lore in these matters, to explain the efficacy of this
preparation. The oyster being the least amorous of all animated
species, that quintessence of oysterness which is the pearl must
infallibly, when prepared in accordance with the doctor's magic
recipe, produce an oyster-like coldness in any person to whom it
should be administered.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, who in ordinary matters was anything but foolish,
was through the very logical quality of her mind completely
convinced by an argument so logical. A large quantity of pearls was
required, since it was only the skin or outer film that survived
solution and supplied the necessary sublimate. Being without actual
pearls on her person, it became necessary to procure them at once,
for she was naturally in haste to set to work. The doctor promised
definitely that if the materials were in his hands by sunset, he
would have the powder ready by midnight.</p>
<p>Lady Essex came well equipped with money for whatever might
betide; but it was far from sufficient for the present need. She
was wearing, however, by a fortunate chance, a carcanet of jewels
equal in value to many a gentleman's estate. Without a moment's
hesitation she unclasped it and gave it into the hands of the
widow, so that she might convert it into gold, purchase the pearls,
and send them by a safe hand to the doctor with the least possible
delay.</p>
<p>All this was faithfully and expeditiously accomplished and late
that night the Countess repaired once more to Dr. Forman's lonely
house at Lambeth, there to witness further and more elaborate
marvels.</p>
<p>First there was the powder, the preparation of which the doctor
had completed with scrupulous exactitude. He delivered it to her in
a little box with a green seal, instructing her to scatter it over
her lord's meat, or mix it in his drink, and, desirably, to
administer it in three approximately equal doses. He explained to
her that, in addition to the virtue inherent in the powder itself
from the nature of its component parts, it possessed a quite
special force due to the cabalistic manner in which it had been
prepared, and to the spirits invoked to preside over the
sublimation of which it was the result.</p>
<p>Then he passed to the other matter in which she required his
help: the assurance to her of the love of Robert Carr in despite of
all difficulties and obstacles. For this, he assured her, no
medicine was now necessary. The Viscount's constancy could be
maintained and even fortified by spells upon the preparation of
which the wonder-working doctor had already been at work.</p>
<p>He produced from a small leaden coffer two little human images
modelled in wax, some six or seven inches high. They were joined by
a fine silver needle, upon which they were impaled transversely, in
such a manner that both were pierced by it in the region of the
heart. He explained to her that these images represented, one
herself and the other Carr; that the needle transfixing them was
enchanted, and that the transfixion had taken place under certain
all-powerful astrological influences fortunately present just then,
with Venus in the ascendant. Other propitious starry combinations
were to be sought, and he would prepare other similar images for
further similar magical operations under their auspices.</p>
<p>'You may rest content, my daughter. Your lord's love for you
shall not be suffered to diminish, but shall daily increase and
grow under the influence of these spells.'</p>
<p>Lady Essex, standing with bent head before him, was thankful
that the light in that weird room was so feeble that he might not
see too much of her shrinking glance and shamed flush reflecting
her tortured pudicity. It seemed to her that she had stripped
herself naked to the soul under the eyes of this warlock, and in
her desperate need she had admitted him to such knowledge as a
woman never gives to any and rarely recognises in herself. In
making free with that knowledge for her service, as was shown by
the images and the rest, this stranger and master of repulsive
practices overwhelmed her with such shame and confusion that she
doubted whether she would have faced the ordeal had she known all
that it must entail.</p>
<p>This tall, white-bearded man, with the large knuckly hands and
the assumed majesty of bearing, became suddenly repugnant and
obscene, and the very air of the place foul and mephitic. She was
pervaded by a burning horror infinitely more intolerable than the
superstitious dread which had previously shaken her in those
surroundings.</p>
<p>Tears of shame coursed down her cheeks as with Mrs. Turner she
hurried through the night in Weston's wake towards the waiting
boat. The little widow comforted her. Nothing worth achieving was
to be had in this world without sacrifice, and when all was said
all confidences were as sacred to the Master as to a father
confessor. She was not to regard him merely as a man. He was one to
whom all secrets of the human heart and of Nature had been
revealed, and she need have no fear that any human soul would ever
know what had passed between her and him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>CONSTRAINT</h3>
<p>Lady Essex, taking what comfort she could from Mrs. Turner's
assurances that her shame and humiliation would remain buried from
the eyes of the world, returned on the morrow to Northampton
House.</p>
<p>By her reappearance there she allayed in part the consternation
of her parents, who with her husband had come to the Lord Privy
Seal in search of her.</p>
<p>The King had yesterday removed himself to Theobald's, and since
Rochester had been among those who accompanied him, it was secretly
feared by Lord and Lady Suffolk that their daughter, too, might
have gone thither, a step which must have been attended, now that
Lord Essex was returned, by the most scandalous consequences.
Without betraying this apprehension to her husband, they had
despatched her eldest brother to Theobald's in quest of her, with
orders to prevail upon her, if there, to return immediately to
London.</p>
<p>It was some relief to them to perceive that this fear, at least,
had been unfounded; and however much they might reprove an intimacy
so little befitting her station as that which had led her to spend
two days and nights at the house of Mrs. Turner, they recognised
this for a comparatively unimportant evil, and were disposed to
make light of it now that she was returned.</p>
<p>In their relief they even found it in their hearts to be lenient
in other ways, and to submit to her insistence that she should
return for the present to Audley End with them, postponing yet a
little while longer her submission to her husband. Since she spoke
now of postponement, where before she had announced an irrevocable
determination, it was considered wise to indulge her, and Lord
Essex was persuaded, with the assurance that Frances at last showed
signs of melting, to exercise yet a little patience.</p>
<p>When at the end of a week at Audley End it was announced to her
that Lord Essex was about to visit her once more, she further
reassured them by refraining from offering any opposition
whatsoever. They were not to guess that she had a very definite
reason for desiring his presence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she wrote with great frankness to her lover, at
Theobald's, informing him of the magical aid which she had procured
and upon which now she counted. It was imprudent, but it was
natural that she should desire her beloved Rochester to have these
glad tidings, to revive his hopes and buttress any weakening of
intention.</p>
<p>The letter produced in Rochester just the effect she hoped, and
in buoyant mood he showed it to Overbury, who, less credulous than
his lordship, viewed it with secret contempt, offered little
comment upon it, and was quite ready to draft the answer to it in
the burning poetical terms his lordship required.</p>
<p>By the time that answer reached Audley End, Lord Essex had
departed again, and had taken some comfort with him. If her
ladyship had continued to hold aloof, this had been less markedly
so than formerly. Indeed, having administered Dr. Forman's powder
to him in accordance with directions, she placed such trust in its
efficacy that she thought it best to await now the manifestations
of aversion which it must produce.</p>
<p>Be it as a result of that sublimate which he had unconsciously
swallowed with his food, be it from other causes, his lordship was
taken violently ill on his return to town. He was put to bed in his
mansion in the Strand, and, the sickness continuing, there came a
time when his physician expressed a doubt of whether he could save
his life. In this doubt the young earl lay for some weeks, whilst
at Audley End his wife, in despite of herself, recognising the
wickedness of the hope, yet entertaining it as the one sure way of
determining all her difficulties and loosening the dreadful bonds
in which she was a captive, looked daily for news of his death,
perhaps even prayed for it.</p>
<p>Death, after all, was a surer agent than Dr. Forman. Death would
resolve all her troubles with a clean finality. If she was wicked
in this thought, it was a wickedness born of the wickedness of
others in so fettering her that she could look to little else for
her relief. Thus she wrote to her lover and even to Mrs. Turner,
and this without any such suspicion as that which instantly crossed
the mind of Sir Thomas Overbury that the magician she had employed,
in promising to render Lord Essex cold, may well have had the
coldness of death in view and had probably supplied her with one of
those slow-working poisons of whose existence rumour never ceased
to mutter.</p>
<p>News of Lord Essex's desperate condition reaching the Court,
which had now returned from Theobald's, the King sent his own
physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne, to visit him.</p>
<p>This Mayerne was looked upon askance by the College of
Physicians, who might have taken pains to curtail his growing
favour if he had not been secure in the protection of King James.
He was a Swiss of good Protestant family who had been physician to
Henri IV of France, and who perhaps because of his Protestantism
felt none too comfortable at the French Court under the regency of
Marie de' Medici, which followed upon his master's assassination.
The English Ambassador in Paris, aware of his ability and the
confidence he had enjoyed at the hands of Henri IV, had recommended
him to King James, with whom he completely established himself by
his skill in dealing with those intestinal troubles which resulted
from his majesty's imprudent gluttonies. Moreover, the doctor had
other qualities that commended themselves to his majesty. He was
plump and jolly of countenance and of a healthy rotundity of
figure. He was mirthful of disposition, and quite early in his new
office of King's Physician, he gave evidence of a discreetness and
closeness above praise. Moreover, he pronounced Latin in the Roman
manner. This was a man implicitly to be trusted, and if English
doctors&mdash;resenting that a foreigner should have usurped such a
position&mdash;spoke of him as a charlatan, they did so in secret
and among themselves.</p>
<p>Sir Theodore, rosy and mercurial, appeared at the bedside of
Lord Essex, investigated his condition, discovered a state of
gastric inflammation which his colleagues appeared entirely to have
overlooked, prescribed for him, and reported to his majesty later
that he would have his lordship out of bed in a week.</p>
<p>When his bold prognosis was accurately realised, the shrewd
doctor merely justified once again the complete trust which King
James reposed in his ability.</p>
<p>But in dragging the Earl of Essex from the jaws of death, Dr.
Mayerne doomed the Countess, as she herself wrote, both to Lord
Rochester and to Anne Turner, to something infinitely worse than
death. For, according to Forman, the intervention of pharmaceutical
agencies at so critical a stage had undoubtedly resulted in
destroying the action of the powders which he had been at such
pains to provide and supply.</p>
<p>And now, Lady Essex was urged by her parents to return to
London, so that she might be near her lord, as was natural for a
wife. If they had not consented that she should be the guest of her
uncle Northampton and if she had been less anxious to see her
lover, constraint would have been necessary to move her from Audley
End.</p>
<p>Often, however, during the three weeks of his lordship's
convalescence, she would disappear from Northampton House upon
affairs of her own, connected with Mrs. Turner. Lady Suffolk might
rail as she pleased against her daughter's intimacy with a woman of
Mrs. Turner's station. Lady Essex persisted in the intimacy, which
was now a cloak for stolen meetings with Lord Rochester. Almost
daily, either at Paternoster Row or at Hammersmith, the lovers met,
to renew their vows, express their misery, and find what
consolation they could in these stolen communions.</p>
<p>She perceived in these meetings, as she believed, the fruits of
Dr. Forman's magical operations. Her Robin was hesitant no longer;
no longer talked of resignation and of bowing to the inevitable;
but showed himself a bold rebel against Fate, determined to oppose
it to the last breath. His hopes fed hers, just as her fortitude
and her insistent vows that she would be torn limb from limb before
she should go to the arms of any other man sustained his own
determination. Still confident of the power of Dr. Forman's
powders, whose effect on this occasion had been fortuitously
destroyed by Mayerne's medicines, she but awaited the occasion to
administer to her lord another dose of them with which at great
cost she had already equipped herself. For in her despair she had
so far conquered her feelings as to visit the necromancer again,
and with a martyrdom of her dignity and pride which but gave
evidence of the strength and depth of her feelings for Rochester,
she had submitted to participation in dreadful necromantic rites in
that lonely house in Lambeth.</p>
<p>His lordship's complete recovery came at last to put an end to
the lovers' secret meetings. Together with his illness Lord Essex
appeared to have shed the last vestige of the patience which he had
hitherto commanded. His first visit when he left his house in the
Strand was to my Lord Privy Seal, a visit undertaken with very
definite intentions.</p>
<p>It was a bitter day of January. The ground of the garden of
Northampton House was hard as iron in the grip of a black frost,
the river a solid sheet of ice from shore to shore. In the Lord
Privy Seal's fine library at the end of the gallery above-stairs,
the Howards were assembled in force, not to defend but to compel
the surrender of the mutinous daughter of their house.</p>
<p>Lady Suffolk, broad and untidy, sprawled glooming in an armchair
by the hearth. The Earl of Suffolk persistently tramped the length
of the room as if it had been a quarter-deck of his younger days.
Old Northampton, pinched by the cold and more vulturine than ever
in consequence, stood holding his lean bony claws to the blaze of
the heaped fire. Lady Essex, looking very frail, her young face
pinched and white, sat a little apart, with lips compressed and
eyes that stared out vacantly upon the cheerless, icy prospect. Her
brother watched her in silence, as sulky as his parents.</p>
<p>Lord Essex arrived. He was pale of face and a little reduced in
bulk by his late illness. But his glance was hard, and his mouth
obstinate. The Suffolks gave him welcome gravely, Northampton more
cheerily, bidding him to the fire to thaw his limbs, Frances not at
all, until he had stood staring at her in dull anger for a long
minute.</p>
<p>'I suppose,' he said at last, bitter resentment in his tone,
'that you are sorry to see me on my legs again.'</p>
<p>She looked at him coldly. She hated him, and accounted that
there was righteousness in her hatred. In her eyes he was an ogre,
a tyrant, a bully and coward to take advantage of the rights
conferred upon him by a law that had been unlawfully employed. Her
hatred spoke frankly in her reply.</p>
<p>'Has anything in our past conversation given your lordship cause
to suppose otherwise?'</p>
<p>Suffolk exploded into oaths. Northampton chuckled as he
continued to warm his hands. The old sinner had as much affection
for Frances as he was capable of experiencing for any human being,
and he accounted the answer a neat one. Also the notion had grown
in his mind that alliance with Rochester, if it could be brought
about, would be of advantage to his house and particularly to
himself. And he found Lord Essex entirely detestable.</p>
<p>'You are frank, madam.' The young man spoke bitterly.</p>
<p>'It is a virtue, I believe.'</p>
<p>His bitterness became ironical. 'I must study to practise it, so
that I may not lag behind you. And we'll begin now. Frankness for
frankness, then, there has been enough of temporising. I am for
Chartley to-morrow, and I beg your ladyship to be ready to
accompany me.'</p>
<p>'You beg?' said she softly.</p>
<p>He raised his voice. 'I command, if you prefer it. Or, to be
even more precise, I merely announce it as my will.'</p>
<p>'You mean that you are not concerned to study mine?'</p>
<p>'It has been studied long enough. Too long. A wife, madam, has
no will that is not her husband's.'</p>
<p>'I am glad, sir, that my parents hear these amiable views.'</p>
<p>Suffolk stormed in. 'Enough pertness, my lady! Your parents not
only hear them, but share them. You go to Chartley to-morrow with
your lord.'</p>
<p>She studied her hands, which lay folded in her lap, so that they
should not see her eyes.</p>
<p>'I go under constraint, protesting against this ... barbarity.
You'll remember that.'</p>
<p>'You go in any way you please. But you go,' Suffolk assured her
grimly.</p>
<p>Lord Essex bowed to him. Northampton made a noise in his throat.
She caught the note of sympathy in that and swung to him.</p>
<p>'You hear them, my lord!'</p>
<p>He set his back to the fire, and clasped his hands behind him,
his old head with its bony brow and beak of a nose thrust forward.
'I hear them. They are your husband and your father, to whom the
law constrains a woman to be submissive. You begin to realise,
Fanny, that a woman is not an independent being, but the chattel of
some man or other. I give thanks to God that I am not a woman. It's
an indignity.'</p>
<p>'What the Devil do you mean?' Suffolk challenged him.</p>
<p>'The Devil knows,' said Northampton, and turned his back upon
them again.</p>
<p>Lady Suffolk essayed soothing words. 'Surely, my lord, we should
stand united in this. After all, my Lord of Essex is in the
right.'</p>
<p>'Who questions it?' barked Northampton.</p>
<p>'I do,' said Frances. 'I more than question it. I denounce
it.'</p>
<p>'Denounce and be damned,' said her father. 'And that ends it.
You go, nevertheless.'</p>
<p>'Of course. But my lord should ask himself in his own interests
if it is worth his while. I perceive that he is not concerned for
my happiness. But it is possible that he may be concerned for his
own. And I ask him: What happiness does he look to draw from
this?'</p>
<p>'The happiness will follow upon the satisfaction of taming you,'
her father assured them; and Lord Essex quietly smiled his
confidence in his powers. He took his leave upon that, since he
could perceive no profit or pleasure in remaining and announced
that he would return betimes on the morrow to fetch his bride and
carry her off to Staffordshire. He was assured by Lord Suffolk that
she would be waiting.</p>
<p>Waiting he found her, when his train of three coaches and a
half-dozen mounted grooms drew up in the courtyard of the great red
house in the Strand. My Lord of Essex travelled in becoming state
with his secretary, chaplain, chamberlain, valet, and cook. He had
counted upon making the journey partly in the leading coach with
her ladyship and partly in the saddle. He may even have flattered
himself that during those hours alone with her in the close
seclusion of that great machine of wood and leather he might make
some progress in his wooing. In this, however, he was frustrated at
the outset. Her ladyship came supported by two tiring-women of her
own, who were to accompany her.</p>
<p>He perceived at once&mdash;although he had not thought of it
before&mdash;that this attendance was the least that was fitting to
a woman of her station, and, vexed though he might be, he knew of
no good objection that he could make. He did, however, go so far as
to suggest that the women should travel with the valet and the
cook. But even Lady Suffolk was outraged by the suggestion. So he
swallowed his chagrin, climbed into the saddle, and set out on
horseback to ride beside the coach containing his lady and her
women.</p>
<p>His chamberlain, who saw to such matters and had despatched a
courier ahead, realising that there might be delays in setting out,
had decreed that they should proceed no farther than Watford on
that first day. When they reached it in the early twilight of the
winter afternoon, all was prepared at the best inn for their
reception.</p>
<p>My lord, coming chilled from the saddle, found his spirits rise
at sight of the bright fire in the best room above-stairs and the
table laid in promise of supper, with a sack posset steaming in a
bowl for his immediate refreshment. Her ladyship, entering the room
ahead of him, loosened her cloak and went straight for this, whilst
he strode to the fire to thaw his booted legs. With her own hands,
her back being fully turned to him, she brimmed a cup of the
steaming mixture of eggs and milk and Canary, and brought it to him
where he stood.</p>
<p>He was almost startled by the graciousness of the act in one
hitherto so aloof. But taking it as the first sign of melting on
her part, he smiled and thanked her. If he was a little exaggerated
in the thanks, a little excessive in his bow of acknowledgement, it
was because he could not stifle the clumsy ironies of the dullard,
and lacked the wit to perceive that playfulness was the least
likely means to his ends in the present circumstances.</p>
<p>'You will be cold, my lord,' she said in level tones, as if to
explain her action.</p>
<p>'Faith, yes! But your kindness warms me more than even the sack
itself.'</p>
<p>She threw off her cloak, and took a seat by the hearth without
answering him.</p>
<p>Anon at table, his own chamberlain and valet in attendance, as
well as the cook to carve and to add what seasonings lacked to make
the dishes fit for my lord's consumption, he essayed conversation
with her ladyship, to be answered only in monosyllables. Himself
not a talkative man and with really nothing to say that called for
many words in the saying, the talk between them after a few
splutterings as of damp powder was completely extinguished.
Thereafter his lordship ate copiously, as was his habit, and in
silence.</p>
<p>It may have been as a consequence of this that he was troubled
in the night with cramps in his stomach and required the attendance
of his physician to afford him relief.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, behind a bolted door and with her woman Catharine
occupying a truckle-bed at her feet, slept tranquilly through the
disturbance.</p>
<p>In the morning, his lordship was sufficiently recovered to have
forgotten the matter and to be intent only upon setting out early.
It was a bright frosty day, and they made good progress over the
hard roads as far as Buckingham, where they lay the night, and
where again his lordship's slumbers were broken by intestinal
trouble. His physician dosed him and remonstrated with him upon
indulging his appetite to excess, an offence which his lordship
protested he had not committed.</p>
<p>On the third night, which they spent at Coventry, his lordship
fell a prey to spasms more acute than those of either of the
previous nights, so that he looked grey and sickly in the morning
when he came to face the last stage of the journey. Her ladyship
had given him the residue of the anti-amorous powder of Dr. Forman,
and the dose may thus have amounted to more than either of the
previous ones. Craven, his physician, had protested against his
lordship's rising in the morning. He was, the doctor swore, in no
case to leave his bed, certainly in no case to expose himself to
the fatigue of a ride of some five and twenty miles. But his
lordship paid no heed. Dead or alive, the obstinate man vowed that
he would lie that night at Chartley.</p>
<p>He had to be packed into the coach with the women for the last
ten miles of the journey, by when he was too weak to protest or to
care what happened to him so that he could lie still.</p>
<p>At Chartley, which they reached in the late afternoon, the
tenants, forewarned of the coming of their lord and his lady, were
assembled to welcome them at the gates, which had been lavishly
festooned with evergreens so as to convert the gateway into a
triumphal arch. But his lordship was scarcely conscious of this, or
of the cap-wavings and hurrahs that greeted him as he drove through
the gateway to the long avenue which led to the great gloomy lonely
mansion in the very heart of that vast park.</p>
<p>They lifted him from the carriage, limp and helpless, and her
ladyship following forgot to be thankful for the respite which his
condition afforded her, in the fearful thought that Dr. Forman's
sublimation of pearls might be responsible for a condition akin to
that which had followed an earlier administration of it.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER
XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE COMEDY AT CHARTLEY</h3>
<p>In the person of the young Earl of Essex there was repeated now
at Chartley the unpleasant experience that lately he had undergone
in London, and this time without the aid of the skilful Dr. Mayerne
to help him through it.</p>
<p>Thus the respite to her ladyship endured for some weeks;
wretched, lonely, anxious weeks of yearnings holy and unholy, and
at moments almost of despair. If the illness of my Lord of Essex
once more sustained her hopes of redemption, at the same time these
hopes were now shot with a certain horror that if he died it would
be as a result of the powders she had given him, although in giving
them she had no cause to suppose that they would slay anything more
than his obnoxious love.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a measure as he improved under the
ministrations of Craven, her despair increased.</p>
<p>This is reflected in letters which she wrote at the
time&mdash;letters which survive&mdash;to Anne Turner and also to
Dr. Forman.</p>
<p>In these she expounds the situation. She has not seen her lord
since his sickness, but is apprehensive of what may happen when he
recovers. Those apprehensions, we must suppose, would be founded
upon the fear that Craven's physic, like Mayerne's, would interfere
with the action of the warlock's powders. She begs Forman to supply
her with galls in case of need, and implores him to ensure her the
continuance of Rochester's love. 'Keep the lord still to me!' is
her cry.</p>
<p>You perceive the double fear by which the unfortunate girl was
haunted in those days at Chartley: of being possessed by a man whom
she detested, and of losing the man whom she so passionately
loved.</p>
<p>By March, when the first buds were beginning to appear on the
trees in Chartley Park as a result of winter's final dismissal in a
week of sunshine and premature warmth, my Lord of Essex was well
again and lusty; and then came for her ladyship the great trial of
strength which she had been dreading. She had spent a fortune in
powders, spells, and incantations to avert the evil moment.
Nevertheless, it overtook her, and found her armed only with her
own weak strength of body, her stronger will, her wit, and the iron
determination which she gathered from her love for Rochester.</p>
<p>One sunny morning, as she sat in the room over the porch which
she had made her bower, his lordship entered unannounced, and drove
her women out by the expression of a wish to be alone with her.</p>
<p>He was a little haggard, and again he had lost some weight. But
he was still ponderous enough in body as in manner, and he
heightened the effect of it by the rigidly fashioned sombre
garments in which he arrayed himself like the Puritan he was at
heart.</p>
<p>He came in a wooing mood, having resolved upon winning her by
gentleness, bearing in mind the fable of the Sun, the Wind, and the
Traveller, which his tutor, perceiving the fundamental obstinacy of
his nature, had never wearied of reciting to him as if to impress
it upon him as a philosophy of life.</p>
<p>She had risen to receive him, and remained standing, a little
breathless and pale, until he begged her to sit again, and himself
drew up a chair and sat down opposite to her. His full dark eyes
admired the lissom girlish grace of her in a simple robe of the
brown of autumn leaves enlivened by gold lacings. She shrank a
little under his glance as if her modesty were violated by it.</p>
<p>'I trust, madam,' he said, 'that you take satisfaction in my
recovery.'</p>
<p>Once before he had said something similar, and her reply to-day
did not greatly vary from her reply on that other occasion. 'That,
my lord, must depend upon what it means for me.'</p>
<p>It was an answer that not only chilled but angered him. Like all
egotists my Lord of Essex desired to impress himself upon the world
around him, and as happens with all egotists who lack the
intelligence to do so effectively, the desire expressed itself in a
natural aggressiveness. There was more than a hint of it in his
manner now.</p>
<p>'What it means to you, Frances, will depend upon your own
wishes.'</p>
<p>The words might have sounded hopeful but for his tone and the
short, ungainly gesture that accompanied them. How she wished the
man would not gesticulate! His movements betrayed the clumsiness of
his nature so completely and detestably.</p>
<p>'My own wishes, my lord, have undergone no change since last I
announced them to you.'</p>
<p>He frowned. 'Yet the circumstances have changed; and our moods
commonly change with circumstances.'</p>
<p>'When you speak of circumstances, sir, you mean environment. You
may change environment an hundred times without changing
circumstances once.'</p>
<p>His resentment grew more sullen. The impertinent chit was
presuming to correct him, almost to school him. But still he curbed
himself.</p>
<p>'We will not quibble over words. Circumstances or environment,
it is all one. You are now in your own house of Chartley, and I
look to you to behave as becomes the mistress of the house.'</p>
<p>'Has your lordship found my behaviour unbecoming?'</p>
<p>'Plague on it, madam! I am serious.'</p>
<p>She smiled a little wistfully. 'Does your lordship find me
playful?'</p>
<p>'No, madam. I find you exasperating.'</p>
<p>There was an end to repression. He got up, seized his chair by
its back, lifted it, and banged it down again a pace or two farther
back. Thus he worked off some of his ill-humoured need for
action.</p>
<p>She answered him quietly. 'Can I be expected meekly to conform
with the wishes of those who brought me here against my will? If
so, something is expected of me which is not within the compass of
human nature.'</p>
<p>To this he had no immediate answer. He set himself to pace the
room, a man ruffled because rendered aware of the impotence of his
wit against what he accounted a wall of obstinacy. At last he
adopted a fresh line of attack.</p>
<p>'Will you tell me, madam, how long you intend to play this
comedy?'</p>
<p>But she met the onslaught in the same way, by taking him up upon
a word, and leaving the sense of what he said unanswered.</p>
<p>'Comedy! You think this is a comedy, and that I am playing?'</p>
<p>'What else, madam? What else?'</p>
<p>'To me, it is nearer akin to tragedy, a tragedy which has for
aim to slay my soul.' She spoke quietly with lowered eyes, and she
ended on something suspiciously like a sob. Then she gathered
passion, and looked up at him, raising her voice. 'Why will you
seek to constrain an unwilling woman, who desires of you only her
release?'</p>
<p>He paused before her, squarely planted on his short, powerful
legs. He made another of his absurd gestures, with both hands this
time. 'It is too late now for that, madam.' His tone was one of
ironical regret. 'It might have been possible before you came to
dwell under my roof. You have been here some weeks now. Can you
suppose after that his majesty would still listen to a
petition?'</p>
<p>'That was your reason for bringing me here!'</p>
<p>He raised his shoulders. His irony deepened.</p>
<p>'Can you blame me for taking what steps were possible to make
sure of the woman I love?'</p>
<p>'Love!' He saw the indignation in the scarlet flame upon her
cheeks. 'Is this love?' She laughed in his face. 'Is a man's love
concerned only with gaining its own ends at any cost? That is what
you have been supposing all your life, no doubt. But love places
the happiness of its object above all else. Your own egregious
self-love expresses itself in that you think of nothing but your
own desires.' Then with an infinite scorn she added: 'Do not
degrade the name of love by applying it to anything between us. You
do not even know the meaning of the word, you oaf!'</p>
<p>Oaf! She had called him oaf! And he was Robert Devereux, Earl of
Essex.</p>
<p>Galled beyond endurance, he caught her suddenly by the wrist
with one of his powerful paws, and wrenched her to her feet so that
she stood confronting him, her face close to his own which was dark
with anger, her breast touching his breast for the first time. But
this only for an instant. Immediately she recoiled, notwithstanding
that his grip so tightened that she felt as if the bones of her
wrist were being crushed.</p>
<p>'Madam, there is a measure of respect due from a wife to a
husband.'</p>
<p>'I am not your wife. You are not my husband. This is a mockery,
an infamy from which ...'</p>
<p>His open left hand descending hard upon her face struck her into
silence and brought physical fear to her for perhaps the first time
in her young life.</p>
<p>'There's to brand you,' he mocked her furiously. 'You'll bear
the mark of my hand upon you awhile to remind you to whom you
belong.'</p>
<p>'My father shall know of this; my father and my brothers, and my
brothers shall kill you for it.'</p>
<p>'Ah! Bah! 'Od rot your father and your brothers, and 'od rot
you!' He flung her from him in his passion. She hurtled against her
chair, and went over with it to lie bruised and breathless upon the
floor.</p>
<p>He stood staring down at her, smiling a little out of his livid,
anger-distorted face.</p>
<p>'Madam, I've had enough of tantrums! You'll be submissive, or
it'll be the worse for you. You shall find me kind or cruel at your
pleasure. You shall receive just that which you desire of me.'</p>
<p>Painfully she gathered herself up, white and breathless, to
answer him. 'Since you give me to choose, sir, you leave me
something for which to thank you. I shall prefer you cruel, if you
please.'</p>
<p>Something of her dignity and courage daunted him. In that moment
the dull, passionate man could with satisfaction have taken her
frail body in his hands and broken it to pieces.</p>
<p>He curbed himself, however, and, with a last inarticulate growl
where he could think of no words suitable, he strode out of the
room, slamming the door after him.</p>
<p>Bruised and shaken in soul as in body, her ladyship sat down to
write a passionate letter to the Earl of Suffolk, in which she
described the brutality of which she had been a victim. She wrote
also to the warlock in Lambeth, addressing him as her 'Sweet
Father,' begging his aid by every means human and superhuman to
rescue her from her terrible situation. By the help of her woman
Catharine, these letters were smuggled away and despatched.</p>
<p>That done, she withdrew to her own room, locked the door, drew
the curtains, and put herself to bed with her misery. There she
remained for a fortnight, seen by nobody but her women, and
refusing to present herself at table. His lordship, himself sulking
over his wrongs, left her to her own devices. At the end of that
time, wearied by a state of affairs which imposed a gloom upon the
mansion, so that even his servants moved noiselessly and in
apprehension, he went to visit her. He was denied admittance, and
departed raging. He came again and yet again, and finally in a fit
of temper he beat down the door and forced himself into her
presence, to announce to her that he would be master in his own
house and to afford practical experience of his mastery.</p>
<p>She was not to imagine, he warned her, that she could prevail
against him by childish methods such as these; nor was she to
suppose that his patience was inexhaustible. If he had consented to
humour her so far, the time had come when she must humour him or
take the consequences. She announced herself quite prepared for the
consequences, and commanded him to leave her. Instead, he laid
hands upon her. A pitched battle followed. She defended herself
with all the strength of her lithe, supple young body, using tooth
and claw and tongue and every missile that came under her eager
hands.</p>
<p>It was an indecent battle, the noise of which reverberated
through the great house and set servants listening in terror that
murder would be the outcome. At the end of it, she flung herself
bruised and battered upon the bed, and lay there prone, shaking and
sobbing as if her heart would break, whilst his lordship stalked
out with a sense of utter defeat, his face bleeding where her nails
had torn it.</p>
<p>He bore away with him, to increase his fury, the consciousness
that he had been driven to behave like a gutter-blood. But he
nursed his resentment aloof from her, and so she had some days of
peace in which to recover from that evil morning's shocks. Nor was
the scene ever repeated. Her ladyship continued to keep her room;
the blinds continued to be drawn; but realising the futility of a
locked door as a barrier against this violent man&mdash;as she
accounted him&mdash;she gave him admission when at last he came to
seek her. On this and subsequent occasions their encounters did not
go beyond words; words which increased in bitterness on either
side.</p>
<p>Then he adopted fresh tactics. He would wear her down by
inaction. She should grow weary to death of her solitude and be
driven to a despairing surrender by sheer loneliness. So he left
her now to her own inert devices. He filled his house with
neighbouring gentlemen, as a bachelor might have done, so that her
presence at table should not be required nor her absence need
excuse. Abandoning his puritanical habits, this dour young nobleman
took to carousing lustily, so that echoes of these carousals
reached her ladyship in her retreat as if to mock her into an
increase of bitterness.</p>
<p>Thus the spring came and went, and summer followed, and the
armed truce between these hostile forces was maintained with a
deepening of exasperation on the one side and a deepening of
despair on the other, since Dr. Forman, too crafty to supply
evidence that would run his neck into a noose, had left her letters
unanswered.</p>
<p>At last, one July morning, his lordship strode into my lady's
chamber, and demanded that the curtains should be drawn. As neither
of her women present showed alacrity in obeying him, he drew them
himself with an ill humour evident in the vigour he employed. Then
he commanded the women to withdraw. Perforce, however reluctantly,
they went.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, still abed, sat up wrapped in a bedgown, her
golden hair in disorder, ravishingly beautiful despite the
apprehension that paled her cheeks and stared from her dilated
eyes. Yet there was little occasion for it to-day. The beauty which
he had found so maddeningly desirable was suddenly grown odious to
him. Here was a fruit which, however fair to the sight, must be
sour to the taste. He had hungered for it so long and so vainly
that at last it had ceased to provoke his appetite. This is what he
was come to announce to her. The situation into which her obstinacy
had forced him was become intolerable. He was neither married nor
single.</p>
<p>He stood at the foot of her bed, the bust of him framed by the
rail and posts, and glowered upon her thence.</p>
<p>'I have come, madam,' he announced in words which had been
carefully rehearsed, 'to summon you for the last time to a
surrender to the circumstances in which we find ourselves.'</p>
<p>The speech sounded ominous in her ears. But she dissembled her
increasing panic, and maintained a steadiness of tone in answering
him. 'My answer, my lord, is still the same as on the first
occasion.'</p>
<p>'You obstinately refuse to fulfil the obligations of your
marriage?'</p>
<p>'I refuse, not obstinately, to fulfil the obligations of a
marriage which I do not recognise.'</p>
<p>'The law and your family recognise it.'</p>
<p>'Must we go over all this again?' Her tone was almost weary, and
she passed a delicate hand over her brow as she spoke, thrusting
back the tumbled hair. 'We move in a circle of argument, my lord,
until we are dizzy. And dizziness does not help us to see things
clearly.'</p>
<p>As usual he found himself baffled by her wit, and being baffled
grew incensed. Yet, remembering the resolve in which he came, he
practised patience a little longer.</p>
<p>'If you chose to see things clearly, madam, there would be no
need for argument.'</p>
<p>'Assume, then, that I do not choose. What follows?'</p>
<p>'You admit the obstinacy in you?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I admit anything you please. Let us come to the
matter.'</p>
<p>'Very well, madam.' He took a deep breath to steady himself.
'Very well. The matter is this: I am tired of you, sick of your
tantrums, sick of your presence in this house. You are free to
depart this house when you choose. You may go to your father or to
the Devil without fear that I shall follow to bring you back. I
curse the day I first saw you, and I pray to God that I may never
set eyes on you again.' His voice had soared with his passion as he
reached the end of his tirade. He dropped it again, to add with an
affectation of sardonic calm: 'That, madam, I think is all.' He
bowed between the bedposts. 'I have the honour to wish you a very
good day.' And he went out rolling a little in his gait, to display
his dignity.</p>
<p>In silence she had heard him, and in silence she suffered him to
depart. Almost she feared that this unexpected move concealed some
trap. It was so miraculous a solution of all her trouble and her
dread. Then she bethought her of Dr. Forman. Although he had sent
her no more powders, who could doubt but that he had continued his
magical operations on her behalf, and that these had resulted at
last in transmuting into hatred Lord Essex's unwelcome love?</p>
<p>She bounded from the bed, summoned her women, issued her orders
briskly and excitedly, and went instantly about her packing.</p>
<p>On the following Sunday, as the Earl of Northampton was sitting
down to dine in the company only of Sir David Wood, his steward
startled him by announcing Lady Essex.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>CAPITULATION</h3>
<p>The moment was one of crisis in other lives than that of Lady
Essex.</p>
<p>Robert Cecil was dead. He had breathed his last at Marlborough
some weeks ago, as he was homing from Bath whither Dr. Mayerne had
sent him to take the waters, in a last endeavour to prolong his
life.</p>
<p>His death and the chances which it must bring them had been
watched by many, but by none so closely as the Earl of Northampton
on the one hand and Sir Thomas Overbury on the other, both of whom
aspired to snatch the seals as they fell from his dead hand.</p>
<p>Each waited now, alert and ready to seize opportunity the moment
it should appear.</p>
<p>But the King made no decision. Temporarily Rochester&mdash;by
now to be regarded as the King's <i>alter ego</i>&mdash;held the
seals, whilst in conjunction with the King himself he conducted the
affairs of the exalted office of First Minister of State. The
duties of that office whilst thus governed were divided between two
shrewd and able gentlemen, Sir Ralph Winwood and Sir Thomas Lake,
an arrangement regarded by both Northampton and Overbury as
temporary merely.</p>
<p>Whilst he watched and waited, the old Earl sighed over what he
considered the daily increasing slenderness of his chances of
realising the great ambition of his life, and cursed the obstacles
in his path: Rochester whom he despised for an upstart and a
fribble, and Overbury whom he feared as a man of parts rendered
dangerous by his ability and the hold which he already had upon
power.</p>
<p>Thus his niece found him on that Sunday morning when she walked
in upon him as he was sitting down to dine. Her advent and the news
she bore were oil to the fading lamp of his hopes. If Essex were,
indeed, willing to seek the annulment of the marriage, and, if the
marriage being annulled, she were free to make a match with
Rochester, the powerful favourite must be brought into alliance
with the House of Howard. If he himself were to play the godfather
to these lovers, such should be Rochester's gratitude that in
return Northampton might surely count upon his suffrages with the
King.</p>
<p>The old man frowned as he thoughtfully pulled the tuft of grey
hair on his chin. He had been sympathetic with his niece, as became
an affectionate uncle; he had pinched her cheek and held her chin
whilst murmuring soothing words; but at the same time he had spoken
only of difficulties in her path.</p>
<p>'If that numskull Essex had but reached this conclusion before
dragging you down to Chartley, as well he might have done, all
would have been well for both of you. But after keeping you for
months under his roof, it seems idle to plead that neither of you
desires the fulfilment of the contract.'</p>
<p>'Yet it is true. I am no more his wife to-day than I was the day
he took me thither.'</p>
<p>'Maybe not. Maybe not. But what rested on evidence before rests
now upon assumption.'</p>
<p>'The servants at Chartley can bear witness ...'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay, up to a point. But only up to a point. Servants are not
always watchful. They sleep like other folk. Still, take heart, my
dear. Something may be possible. I will write to Essex.'</p>
<p>There was no betrayal in any of this of his own eagerness to
serve her to the fullest extent of his craft and his power.
Similarly now, when she expressed her wish to see Lord Rochester,
whilst it was what he himself desired, he gave no sign of it; but
rather of the opposite. His countenance darkened with thought which
might be supposed hostile.</p>
<p>'Were it not better to be off with the old love ...'</p>
<p>She interrupted him hotly. 'There is no old love. There has
never been any love in my life but Robin. I belong to him. I
belonged to him long before my lord came back from his
travels.'</p>
<p>He wagged a lean forefinger in her face, and spoke severely.
'You'd be wise, my girl, not to announce that fact too loudly, or
indeed at all. The gossip that there was of your relations with
your Robin might even now prove an obstacle to delivering you. You
cannot want to add to it by such imprudent reminders of something
that were best forgotten. If you are wise you will not see Lord
Rochester at all, nor communicate with him until our way to the
annulment of the marriage is made clear.'</p>
<p>She looked startled at first. Then she smiled wistfully.
'Sometimes it is so hard to be wise.'</p>
<p>'Generally,' he agreed with her, and shrugged. 'I have said what
I think. For the rest until you take some order for yourself, this
house is yours, and you may use it as your own. I will have rooms
prepared for you. You may receive whom you please. But ...'</p>
<p>She leapt at him and stopped his mouth with a kiss.</p>
<p>No more was said. But on the following morning, coming
unexpectedly into the library, he surprised her in her lover's
arms.</p>
<p>He played the astonished and troubled guardian with the
histrionic skill of which he was master. He stood dismayed under
the lintel for a long spell, whilst the handsome gentleman and the
lovely lady disengaged themselves from their embrace.</p>
<p>He put his niece from him when she sought with feminine arts of
cajolery to melt the severity in which he advanced into the
room.</p>
<p>'If you please, Fanny, I will have a word alone with my Lord
Rochester.'</p>
<p>My Lord Rochester, scenting trouble from that frosty tone,
stiffened visibly before bowing. 'As many as you please, my
lord.'</p>
<p>'You'll not be angry with him? The fault is mine. I sent for
him, and ...'</p>
<p>'Quiet you. I am not angry with anybody. I desire the best for
you. For both of you. That is why his lordship and I must
talk.'</p>
<p>He thrust her from the room, waved her lover to a chair, and
seating himself opposite displayed no more than a grudging
friendliness at first. He spoke of the state of things between his
niece and Essex; of the difficulties that stood in the way of her
divorcement, and pointed out that such visits with such an object
as that of which his eyes had beheld the evidence could only
increase those difficulties.</p>
<p>Then he melted a little. 'I would assure your lordship that in
all the world there is no man more conscious of your worth than I
am, and therefore more entirely your servant and&mdash;if you will
concede me the honour of the title&mdash;your friend. But my love
for my niece must be in this dark hour of her sweet young life my
first consideration.'</p>
<p>'I must honour you for that, my lord.'</p>
<p>'You will therefore bear with me in that I urge prudence upon
you, so that nothing that you now do may increase the difficulties
confronting her.' He paused. 'You would not, I am sure, my lord,
wish to jeopardise the peace of her future life by some ...
transient satisfaction.'</p>
<p>Lord Rochester coloured. 'You misapprehend me, my lord.'</p>
<p>The Earl's brows went up interrogatively.</p>
<p>'Or else,' Rochester continued, 'I do not understand your
lordship. Circumstances may not permit me to proclaim it broadcast,
which is what I should desire. But here, to you at least, I may say
frankly and freely that I love Lady Essex, and that I yield to no
man in anxiety to see this divorcement accomplished so that I may
make her my wife.'</p>
<p>It was what Northampton desired to hear in explicit terms. His
old eyes owlishly pondered the young man.</p>
<p>'You say it to me. That is safe. But a whisper of it elsewhere
may grow to a tumult. So set a guard upon your tongue as upon your
actions where Frances is concerned.'</p>
<p>For that day it was enough. By displaying his willingness to
become Lord Rochester's ally in the realisation of his hopes of
Lady Essex, the old Earl forged the first stout link of the chain
by which he counted upon attaching the favourite to himself.</p>
<p>Lord Rochester went his ways observing the prudence which the
Lord Privy Seal had enjoined. He spoke neither of the Essex affair
nor of his own hopes therein to any soul but Overbury. Overbury
would have been dismayed had he not accounted the obstacles to the
divorce insuperable. The only result of these futile struggles
would be a still greater scandal, which must widen the breach
between the Howards and Rochester and destroy the bridge which
Northampton had so craftily thrown across it. He expressed himself
freely as was his habit.</p>
<p>'Since Northampton is too astute to deceive himself with any
such hopes, it follows that he deliberately aims at deluding
you.'</p>
<p>'To what end?' Rochester was impatient of the suggestion.</p>
<p>'You will know that when he seeks your patronage or your favour.
Bear it meanwhile in mind. Take all that his lordship may have to
offer, but commit yourself to nothing in return until the prize is
well within your grasp.'</p>
<p>In his confidence that this would never happen, and that
Rochester, however much he might make a show of resenting the
warning, would, nevertheless, act upon it, Sir Thomas went serenely
about his affairs.</p>
<p>He underestimated the pertinacity, resource, and ruthlessness of
Northampton, qualities which were to be very fully displayed before
all was done.</p>
<p>The old Earl began upon Lord Essex so soon as that young
gentleman came to town, which was some weeks later. The dullard
showed that he could be violent, and stormed at the Lord Privy Seal
on the subject of his niece and of his own passionate desire to
make an end of the ridiculous situation in which he found
himself.</p>
<p>The old man took a subacid tone with him. 'One tenth of this
zeal to do as her ladyship desired of you before you went to
Chartley would have availed you more than one hundred times the
amount of it, vigorous as it is, that you display at present.'</p>
<p>The young man, who was not usually addicted to profanity, had
recourse to swearing.</p>
<p>'I would to God ...' he was beginning when Northampton crisply
interrupted him.</p>
<p>'Let us leave God out of it. The King is our more immediate
concern. And let me implore your lordship to bring more calm to the
consideration of your difficulties.'</p>
<p>'They are your niece's difficulties no less; and she created
them.'</p>
<p>'You created them between you. But that is not now important.
What matters is to discover how this very imperfect creation may be
effaced.'</p>
<p>'I am prepared to petition jointly with her ladyship for the
annulment.'</p>
<p>'You already know the difficulties resulting from your obstinacy
in dragging an unwilling woman down to Chartley. I do not remind
you of this to annoy you, but so that you may see how it has
changed the face of matters.'</p>
<p>Essex had suspected as much. Nevertheless, to hear it calmly
stated by one who knew the law and spoke with authority was cold
water to the heat of his indignation.</p>
<p>'Are we then to remain bound thus, neither wedded nor single,
until one of us dies?'</p>
<p>'At first I thought so. But I have since considered. There is a
way.' The old serpent spoke very slowly. He moved away now, so that
he had his back to the young nobleman, who sprawled carelessly in a
chair. He went to stare through the window at the boats on the
bright river and the green meadows of the Surrey bank across the
water. 'The wedding still remains no wedding after all these
months. Your lordship lays the blame for that upon my Lady Essex.
Her reluctance in the matter would hardly be accounted a proper
ground even if it were believed. To accept such a state of things
would be to establish a dangerous precedent. But if&mdash;and the
course would certainly be a more chivalrous one in your
lordship&mdash;you were to take the blame upon yourself, the issue
would be rendered infinitely more easy.'</p>
<p>Lord Essex considered, his brow rumpled with perplexity. The old
man continued to present his back to him. At last he confessed
himself baffled.</p>
<p>'I do not perceive the difference,' said he.</p>
<p>'Yet it is plain enough.' His lordship slowly turned, and
explained that which to a mind less dull should have required no
explanation.</p>
<p>Essex bounded from his chair. 'Never!' he swore. 'Shall I make
myself a laughing-stock for the whole lewd world?'</p>
<p>'You will be that in any case. You cannot now escape ridicule
whichever way you turn.'</p>
<p>'But I turn not that way.' He was very determined.</p>
<p>Northampton slowly raised his shoulders and spread his hands.
'In that case, my lord, you must resign yourself to spending the
remainder of your days in the impossible situation in which you now
find yourself. I am sorry for you, and sorry for my niece.'</p>
<p>They got no further that day, nor for many days thereafter.
Weeks passed and grew into months before the heat of indignation
engendered in my Lord Essex had simmered down to the extent of
enabling him to renew the discussion with Northampton.</p>
<p>They were months in which the lovers were driven almost to
frenzy as they observed the apparent wilting of hopes which had
seemed on the point of blossoming. They saw each other constantly,
and since Northampton discouraged these meetings, they met
sometimes at Hounslow, where her ladyship had taken up her
residence at a house purchased from Sir Roger Aston, sometimes at
Turner's house at Hammersmith, sometimes at the Golden Distaff in
Paternoster Row, and more rarely at Northampton House.</p>
<p>His assiduity in these stolen meetings caused Rochester to
neglect his duties at court and about the person of the King, and
but for the remonstrances of Overbury, who looked on with some
apprehension, this neglect might have been carried to unpardonable
lengths.</p>
<p>At last, in the early days of September, after some four or five
weeks of fruitless brooding, Lord Essex once more sought the Earl
of Northampton. He came to announce again that he would take any
way but the way which Northampton suggested. But he was less
vehement in announcing it. And by the time they parted, Northampton
had at least succeeded in bringing him to perceive that whether he
went that way or not it was the only way open to him, and that,
until he resolved himself to tread it, further discussions between
them were but a waste of time. At parting, however, Northampton
softened the harshness of this by a little worldly advice.</p>
<p>'After all, my lord, what is this price of a little ridicule
that you need boggle to pay it, considering that with it you
purchase liberty from your present bonds? For liberty men have been
glad enough to put their very lives in pawn. You avoid the ridicule
at the cost of wasting your life. Is that worth a sane man's
while?'</p>
<p>Lord Essex departed to think it over, and decided that it was
not. He came yet again, to capitulate; to announce at last that he
would do whatever Northampton desired of him, so that the result
should be the cancellation of his marriage.</p>
<p>Northampton commended the wisdom of the decision, and went to
work. Himself he drew up the petition that was to be laid before
the King, having secretly taken counsel upon it with Rochester,
whom he had kept informed step by step of what was happening. Thus
the intimacy between them grew rapidly in those days in which they
might be said to be accomplices.</p>
<p>Northampton chuckled as he conned the document which Rochester
was to lay before his majesty. If he knew the King at all, this
would afford him such a chance to play Solomon and Pontiff in one,
to display the depths of his erudition in law and in theology, as
he could scarcely ever have hoped to grasp. He imagined how James
would slobber and gurgle in delight over the pedantic periods he
would pen on the subject and the learned discourses he would hold
forth to guide bishops and lawyers in reaching a decision.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE ALARM</h3>
<p>My Lord Northampton did not overrate the King's delight at the
prospect opened out before him by the Essex petition.</p>
<p>His majesty sent for his Robin, and, closeted with him alone,
showed him the document, the preparation of which his lordship had
witnessed, and entertained him at great length with the
theological, legal, and physiological intricacies which its
contents aroused. His majesty was almost tearful on the subject of
the poor Howard lassie, and the harshness of Fate to have sent so
dour a visitation to that innocent little lamb.</p>
<p>If the petition was founded upon the truth&mdash;and his majesty
could not conceive that human wickedness could invent a falsehood
which if present must in the sequel be rendered
apparent&mdash;there could be little doubt of how the bishops would
decide; and if when he came to weigh it carefully he concluded that
it was true&mdash;for if false he depended upon the sagacity which
had fathomed at a glance the nature of the Gunpowder Plot&mdash;he
would proceed at the earliest moment to appoint a commission to try
the matter.</p>
<p>Then he bethought him that once upon a time the gossips had
linked Rochester's name with the lady's, and questioned Robin
thereupon. Rochester came prepared for this, and was frank enough
in his reply.</p>
<p>'It is true, Sire, that I entertained, and still entertain, the
deepest sentiments of affection for her ladyship.'</p>
<p>'The deepest? And how deep may that be? Deep enough for marriage
if she were free?' The great eyes so full of wondering sadness
considered the fair face of the young favourite.</p>
<p>Rochester smiled a little. 'Deep enough for that, may it please
your majesty.'</p>
<p>'Tush! Tush!' His majesty was fretful. 'Why can ye not be frank
with me? D'ye want the lass?'</p>
<p>Rochester was frank. 'As I want salvation, Sire.'</p>
<p>'Huh!' The intensity of his lordship's tone almost startled the
monarch. He fidgeted a moment nervously. Then took a sip of the
thick sweet Malaga wine from the goblet at his elbow, wiped his
sandy mostachios with a handkerchief, and at last delivered
himself. 'If ye want the lass, ye must have her.' He stretched up
his hand to pinch his lordship's cheek. 'Rogue!' he said, and
gurgled his satisfaction at being able to gratify so signally his
beloved Rabbie. 'There'll be the less delay in appointing the
commission.' Then the law-giving and theological sovereign rising
above the good-natured, fatherly fellow in him, he made haste to
add: 'Ye must have her, that is, if the commission favours the
petition.'</p>
<p>Rochester reported the King's words to Overbury. And Overbury
experienced his first real pang of apprehension; he began to ask
himself whether he had not held his hand too long, deluded by his
confidence that no acceptable petition could be framed. He learnt
now for the first time its basis, and almost sneered as he asked
Rochester how this was to be established. Rochester shrugged the
question aside as unimportant, and went to bear his good tidings to
Northampton, and later to her ladyship at Hounslow.</p>
<p>Frances wept when she heard them. Her lover, as uplifted as she
was, after having suffered scarcely less, kissed her tears away
whilst swearing to her that he would make it his life's object to
see that the future held no weeping for her.</p>
<p>Things did not move, however, as rapidly as these impatient ones
desired. The King and his Court with him were concerned at the time
with the coming of the Palsgrave, who was to marry the Princess
Elizabeth, and in the bustle of preparation for so momentous an
occasion, other affairs underwent postponement.</p>
<p>But, although the King had as yet taken no steps towards the
appointment of the commission, rumour was soon at work, bringing in
its train an unfortunate revival of the old scandal touching the
rivalry of Prince Henry and my Lord Rochester for the affections of
Lady Essex. It infuriated Rochester, who perceived here matter to
daunt the bishops in their task when they came to it, or at least
to render them unpleasantly inquisitive.</p>
<p>Prince Henry, whose feelings towards Rochester had not been
improved by the ever-increasing intimacy between the King and the
favourite, was moved to fury by the news. The Queen, the Earl of
Pembroke, and all those nobles who made up the great party hostile
to Rochester now joined the Prince in a deeper rancour against this
insolent favourite who rode roughshod over the rights of his
betters and who apparently was become so powerful with the King
that he could ride equally roughshod over the laws of God. They
stood united in the intention of using every measure to thwart the
petition when it came to judgment. They would use their influence
with the bishops to be appointed, to the end that these might
refuse the divorcement.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Overbury, who in those days employed a little army of
spies to keep him informed of what was passing, was presently able
to dismay Lord Rochester by a full exposition of this state of
affairs. He followed up the unwelcome news by advice that was still
more unwelcome.</p>
<p>'Do you see, Robin, amid what gins you are walking? Do you see
how a false step may ruin you?'</p>
<p>'Plague take you, Tom, I'm not so easily ruined.' Straight,
tall, and handsome, magnificent as ever in his raiment, he looked
indeed a man to hold his own against the world; for in these last
two years he had ripened richly in the benign and constant sunshine
of royal favour.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas fetched a sigh. 'It is such overweening confidence as
yours which has led many a tall fellow to walk with his nose in the
air until a pitfall brought him down.'</p>
<p>Rochester questioned him by a frown.</p>
<p>'These Howards, now,' said Sir Thomas. 'I've warned you against
them since the outset, since long before this woman came to bewitch
you.'</p>
<p>'What's that to the matter?'</p>
<p>'In their toils you will be a lost man, and I see you walking
into those toils whilst your eyes behold nothing but this girl's
beauty. For God's sake, Robin, rouse yourself before it is too
late.'</p>
<p>'Too late for what?'</p>
<p>'Before that happens which will topple you from your precarious
eminence.'</p>
<p>'I do not perceive its precariousness.'</p>
<p>'All eminences that depend upon royal favour alone are
precarious. The caprice that raised you may cast you down
again.'</p>
<p>'Oh, 'sdeath! Do I depend upon caprice alone, do you say?'</p>
<p>'No. You have something more. You have me,' said Sir Thomas
steadily. 'But not even I can hold you where you stand unless you
heed me.'</p>
<p>Rochester moved about the room ill-humouredly. Sir Thomas used,
he thought, an unnecessary, an indelicate frankness. And he
exaggerated. He was not so valuable a prop to my lord's greatness
as he supposed. His lordship said so with some petulance. Sir
Thomas showed no resentment. He answered with patient calm.</p>
<p>'You and I make one between us. That was the compact from the
start. You supply the brawn, the beauty, and the personal grace
which have captured the fancy of the King. I supply the
intelligence, the knowledge of affairs, and the industry which have
made you and preserve you something more than the minion to display
a tailor's tricks and gauds to the sneers of a Court.'</p>
<p>'By God, you're frank with me!'</p>
<p>'By God, I mean to be.' Sir Thomas banged the writing-table with
his clenched hand. 'Each of us is nothing without the other.'</p>
<p>'I cry you thanks for that, at least. I'm glad you own that
without me you would be nothing.'</p>
<p>'Just as you are nothing without me. United, we have this
England under our hand. In all the world there's not another man to
serve you as I have served you, just as in all the world there is
no other to serve me as you have done. If I claim much, I
acknowledge much. Break up this partnership, Robin, and you break
us both. I shall sink back to the Temple whence I sprang, to pick a
living in the practice of the law. You will sink back to the
minionship and fribbledom in which you fretted when I found you.
When it is seen that your hand no longer grasps the tiller of the
ship of State, your influence will depart from you, the homage will
cease, the King himself will begin to regard you differently, and
will cease to regard you at all the moment another fresher, younger
minion attracts an eye in which you, as a mere minion, will have
grown stale.'</p>
<p>'By Heaven, man, d'ye mean to quarrel with me?' Lord Rochester
was furious by now.</p>
<p>'I mean to avoid it,' said Sir Thomas, cold as ice.</p>
<p>His lordship stared angrily into that narrow, finely featured,
sensitive face.</p>
<p>'On my soul, then, you take an odd way to your ends.'</p>
<p>'That is only because you do not yet perceive my ends.'</p>
<p>'I perceive that you have said things which I would brook from
no other living man.'</p>
<p>'There is no other living man entitled to say them. There are
not two other men in all the world who stand to each other as you
and I. We are between us body and soul. Understand it once for all
before that happens which by parting us may ruin us both. Remember
the oath we swore to each other when we entered upon this
partnership of ours.'</p>
<p>'I do remember it.' Rochester was at the height of exasperation.
'No need to remind me of that. But perdition catch my soul if I
understand you. Who is like to part us?'</p>
<p>'You are.'</p>
<p>'I! You're mad, Tom.'</p>
<p>'Oh, not wittingly, nor with your eyes open to the fact. But
stupidly and blindly by persevering in your present courses. This
Essex business is a pitfall for you and a dangerous one. The
scandal that there was is as nothing to the scandal that there'll
be if you persist in your determination to marry her ladyship. Have
you considered how the commission may find if your name continues
to be coupled with hers, whilst your enemies&mdash;Pembroke, the
Queen, the Prince, and the rest of them&mdash;are at work to pull
you down by any means in their power? Do you not yet perceive what
an opportunity you are affording them to ruin you? Do you not see
that even the King himself will scorn to protect you if certain
things should become known?'</p>
<p>'What things?' Rochester demanded out of a sudden
intimidation.</p>
<p>'The real depth of your relations with her ladyship before her
husband came home from abroad. Court gossip is naught, we know. A
court is a place of scandalmongers. But if the scandal can be shown
to have a foundation of truth?'</p>
<p>'And who's to show that?'</p>
<p>'Who? Can you be sure that no one knows? What of Anne Turner?
What of her servants? That fellow Weston and others? What of that
warlock over in Lambeth?'</p>
<p>'He died some weeks ago.'</p>
<p>'But his wife survives, and might be brought to show that Lady
Essex practised against her lord's life.'</p>
<p>'That she never did!' thundered Rochester.</p>
<p>'I only say that Forman's widow might be brought to show that
she did. Letters may have survived into which such meanings could
be read. Her ladyship was none too prudent. And such an accusation
would gather confirmation from the fact that my Lord of Essex was
twice sick to the point of death whilst in the company of her
ladyship. Where should you stand if all that were brought to
light?'</p>
<p>His lordship's blank countenance showed the dismay that had
gathered in his heart. He sat down heavily, staring at the ever
calm Sir Thomas. 'My God!' he groaned, and again: 'My God!'</p>
<p>'You begin to understand,' said Overbury.</p>
<p>His lordship made some recovery. 'You seek to affright me with
peasebogles,' he complained. 'You state what might happen. But
there's no such likelihood. You present the worst to me.'</p>
<p>'A prudent man keeps ever before him the worst that may befall;
and this however much he may hope for the best.'</p>
<p>'So be it. You indicate the danger. How is't to be averted?'</p>
<p>'In one way only. It may cost you a bitter wrench. But the
alternative may mean the loss of all. Put this marriage definitely
from your mind. Renounce it, and announce the renunciation.'</p>
<p>'Not while I live!' Rochester bounded from his chair. 'I'll take
my chance of ruin before I do that.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas shrugged. 'To that you would have the right if you
stood alone. But I stand with you. Our partnership is a deal older
than this love-affair. And if you ruin yourself, you ruin me.'</p>
<p>'And I'll ruin us both before ever I contemplate the step you
advise. Have you no heart, Tom? Are you just a cold, calculating
brain?'</p>
<p>'I hope I do not lack a heart. But certainly I have brain enough
to know how transient a thing is the love of a woman. This love of
yours will fade the more quickly if you sacrifice your great
position to it. Who knows, indeed, if you hold to your present
course and ruin overtakes you, whether the marriage for which you
risk so much will ever come to pass?'</p>
<p>'If I were beggared, Frances would still cleave to me. I love
her with a love beyond the understanding of such men as you.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas smiled a crooked smile. 'Yet I should understand it,
seeing that it was I expressed it. Do you forget my letters and my
sonnets with which I won her for you?'</p>
<p>'You won her for me? You?'</p>
<p>'Did I not? Have you forgot?'</p>
<p>Leaning towards him across the writing-table, Rochester was
within an ace of striking him, and might, indeed, have struck him
but for Sir Thomas's next words.</p>
<p>'Robin! Robin! Are we to quarrel, you and I, after all that we
have weathered side by side? Is a woman to come between us, and
drive us asunder?'</p>
<p>His lordship straightened himself. 'It is not the woman that
will come between us, Tom, but your lack of regard for her, which,
loving her as I do, I must resent. No more of this, or we quarrel
mortally, and there is but one human being with whom I should be
more loth to quarrel than with you. Let me hear no more of it. The
dangers may exist. But they're none so imminent as your timidity
supposes.' He strode to the door. 'I'll face them, and you must
face them with me. There's no help for it. And that's my last
word.' He put an end to the discussion by going out abruptly.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas leaned back in his chair, his fingers toying idly
with a quill, his countenance calm. He was checked. But very far
yet from being checkmated. There were several moves he perceived by
which to avert a marriage which would turn Rochester into a puppet
for old Northampton. And for Rochester's sake as well as for his
own he accounted it his duty to make those moves in season.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>SIR DAVID WOOD</h3>
<p>Across the serenity of those blissful days for Lady Essex, days
in which she sunned herself in the high hopes of the fulfilment of
the love that was her life, there fell, to chill her, the shadow of
Sir Thomas Overbury.</p>
<p>Rochester in his trouble of mind exposed to her the perils to
which Sir Thomas had drawn his attention. It was weak in him to
afflict her with fears which might never be realised; but he
justified himself by the reflection that these perils threatened
her as closely as they threatened him, and that he had no right to
leave her in ignorance of them.</p>
<p>They stood in the lofty, pillared hall of her somewhat
Italianate house at Hounslow on the October morning after his last
interview with Overbury, and there he urged the matters that
oppressed him.</p>
<p>She was not at first perturbed. From the cushioned oak settle,
at right angles to the hearth with its tall, carved overmantel, she
looked up at his clouded countenance, and, smiling, shook her
head.</p>
<p>'Turner is true as steel, nor dare be otherwise. Is she to tell
the world the part she played in helping me? It would go hard with
her if she did. As for Weston, he is silenced by the same gag. The
rest is naught. Gossip is never to be stifled, and is not deeply
regarded by any person of worth. The only other who knows is Sir
Thomas Overbury. How comes he to know these matters, Robin?'</p>
<p>Robin shrugged. Her words had put a fresh complexion on the
matter, presented points which he had missed, and thus had
instantly restored his equanimity. He had started at shadows. He
answered her question; but not truthfully, because he dared not
tell her of the graces of mind he had borrowed from Overbury to
help him in his wooing.</p>
<p>'It was an indiscretion, perhaps,' he confessed. 'But Tom and I
have had no secrets from each other.'</p>
<p>She frowned a little in thought. 'Yet this was not your secret
only. It was mine as well. More mine than yours.'</p>
<p>'I confess it,' he said contritely. 'But don't blame me. Like
you I was troubled in soul and eager for advice. There was no one
else whom I could trust, and no one of so acute a mind as his.'</p>
<p>'If he is full worthy of your trust, if he is staunch and loyal,
you have done no harm. Can you be sure of that?'</p>
<p>'As sure as of myself.'</p>
<p>'Why, then you may dismiss your every fear.' She rose, and came
to put her arms about his neck with a melting tenderness. 'There
are no obstacles before us, Robin. At least none that are not
presently to be surmounted. The road to happiness lies ahead, my
dear. We shall look back upon our little pangs, our anxieties and
momentary despairs, and count them a little price to have paid for
the glory that is ours.'</p>
<p>'My heart!' he cried, and caught her to him, swearing that he
would pay more than that at need, that he would give all he had and
was, to find a haven in her arms.</p>
<p>And so trusting that Turner and Weston would be silent because
they must, and Overbury because he was loyal and true to her Robin,
she went in happy confidence of the finding of the commission which
the King was appointing, with Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
at its head. Thus until the shadow fell.</p>
<p>It happened at Northampton House. Sir Thomas Overbury was not
the only one to employ spies. The Lord Privy Seal found them
necessary, both to a proper discharge of the duties of his office,
and to the shaping of his own personal concerns. And these spies
brought him word that the rumours afloat concerning the real and
illicit object of the commission&mdash;illicit since it had for
object to break up an existing marriage so as to give Lady Essex to
the favourite who had formerly been her lover&mdash;were being
disseminated in Paul's and at the ordinaries by Sir Thomas Overbury
himself. If on the one hand Northampton was aghast at the
discovery, on the other he perceived a certain capital to be
extracted from it. Its disclosure to Rochester should suffice for
the breaking of Overbury.</p>
<p>So Northampton sent for Rochester and laid before him the
disclosures of his spies.</p>
<p>Rochester refused to believe the tale. It was unthinkable.</p>
<p>Northampton swore that, unless the damned scab&mdash;as he now
called Overbury&mdash;were checked, he would ruin all.</p>
<p>Rochester, still trusting to the loyalty of his friend, taxed
Overbury with the matter, and suffered the source of his
information to be drawn from him. Then Sir Thomas laughed.</p>
<p>'Northampton, eh! The pestilent, noisome old fool! A secret
recusant that should long since have been Star-Chambered! Haven't I
warned you against him and all that hell-brood of Howards? Do you
not perceive the fellow's aim? It is to embroil us, to part us, so
that he may have you under his hand to obtain him whatever he
covets. I'll hear no more of this. But I warn you again that if you
keep to your course you'll be forced in the end to choose between
the Howards and me, which means that you'll be forced to choose
whether you'll be served by me or live to serve the Howards.'</p>
<p>His lordship was bewildered, and knew not what to hold by. His
friendship with Overbury in one way and another was being marred.
What would follow if it were ended? In the depths of him he feared
that it might be no less than Sir Thomas foretold. Therefore he
persisted in believing what he hoped, which was that Northampton's
spies had been at fault.</p>
<p>Lady Essex, however, took a different view. Northampton saw to
this, hoping that she might prevail with Rochester where he could
not. The old Earl perceived quite clearly the motives actuating Sir
Thomas; understood perfectly that Sir Thomas was not at all
concerned with the rights or wrongs of the marriage, but merely
with his hold upon the favourite which the marriage threatened. It
became a secret duel between Northampton and Overbury for the
possession of Rochester, a duel in which neither dared too clearly
to show his hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lady Essex, driven to distraction, took affairs into
her own hands, with that firm, direct independence of spirit which
she had ever displayed.</p>
<p>Again as of old there hovered about her frequently in those days
at Northampton House the slim, elegant person of Sir David Wood,
who once had paid court to her and announced himself for evermore
her servant. As if in confirmation of this, he still bore himself
with a certain gallantry towards her, although fully informed of
what was to follow upon the dissolution of her marriage. She
determined to make proof of his sincerity. She had heard of him
that he had a certain reputation as a swordsman and that he plied a
very nimble rapier. She broached the matter to him at last, taking
him up on one of his ever-recurring protestations that his life had
no purpose but her service.</p>
<p>'These are smooth words, Sir David, and easily uttered.' She
shook her sunny head, and smiled. 'What if I were one day to take
you at your word?'</p>
<p>'I should count myself the happiest of men,' said he
promptly.</p>
<p>She laughed outright. 'Why, if it will bring you happiness, I
forgo my last scruple.' She became serious. 'I have a very
dangerous enemy hereabouts. A snake of a man who may do me mortal
hurt. It happens that you have already suffered at his hands, which
in a way makes in this a bond between us.'</p>
<p>Sir David lowered his hand to his sword hilt, and thrust up the
blade behind. 'His name, my lady?' said he, at once converted into
your truculent fire-eater for her admiration.</p>
<p>'His name is Overbury.'</p>
<p>He sucked in his breath. 'That dog! What affront does he dare
offer you?'</p>
<p>'He defiles my name in public with scandalous stories.'</p>
<p>He looked ineffable things, but said nothing until she pressed
him. Then he displayed a certain hesitancy. 'The knave stands high.
He is well protected. Lord Rochester now ...'</p>
<p>She interrupted him. She had no wish to discuss Lord Rochester's
part in this. Instead she offered a further stimulus.</p>
<p>'What was your loss at his hands, Sir David?'</p>
<p>'A matter of a thousand pounds at least.'</p>
<p>'Well, here's to pay the debt and to recover the money at the
same time, Sir David. When you have settled your own score with him
as a gentleman should, you shall have the thousand pounds from me
in satisfaction of the service you will have rendered me at the
same time.'</p>
<p>Sir David bowed. She had flicked him sharply with her reminder
of what became a gentleman in his position, and being needy, she
had tempted him beyond his powers of resistance with the glitter of
that thousand pounds.</p>
<p>'His friends may order his winding-sheet,' he said in your
fire-eater's best manner, and went about the business.</p>
<p>That evening found him in King Street just as Sir Thomas was
returning to the handsome house which he now maintained there in
the neighbourhood of the palace. By an odd coincidence he reached
the door almost at the same moment as Sir Thomas so that they were
within an ace of colliding. Each drew aside to give the other
passage.</p>
<p>'I go no further,' said Sir Thomas. 'This is my house.'</p>
<p>'Your house? Odso! Then you'll be Overbury?'</p>
<p>His tone drew Overbury's eyes more sharply, and Sir Thomas
recognised him for Northampton's creature and got the scent of
mischief breast high at once.</p>
<p>'I have long desired to meet you, sir,' said Sir David.</p>
<p>'The desire was easy of fulfilment. I am not difficult to find.
You are, I think, Sir David Wood, a friend of the Lord Privy
Seal.'</p>
<p>'I am honoured by your memory. But perhaps you have occasion for
it.'</p>
<p>'Occasion? I call none to mind.'</p>
<p>'Yet there was one in which your intervention was of a cost to
me of a thousand pounds.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas looked him over with that glance of his which he
could render so frosty and distant. 'Was it on this that you
desired to meet me?'</p>
<p>Sir David nodded. 'On this.'</p>
<p>The door was opened at that moment by Overbury's man Davies, a
brisk, well-set-up lad of a little more than twenty, with a comely
brown head, pleasant-faced and neatly attired, who was entirely in
his master's confidence.</p>
<p>Overbury waved his hand in invitation. 'Let us in, then.'</p>
<p>Sir David hesitated a moment, then, bowing slightly, crossed the
threshold. From the narrow passage he was ushered by Sir Thomas
into a long, low room that was almost bare of furniture. A little
oval table of oak stood in the window, and four tall chairs were
ranged against the wall. On a rack above the overmantel were hung a
half-dozen rapiers, whose padded points announced them for practice
swords. As many targets with daggers attached to them were ranged
on either side of this rack.</p>
<p>The long space of floor was bare, and in the middle of it was
boldly drawn a square of chalk whose sides were some seven feet in
length. Within the square, touching its sides at a tangent, there
was a circle, and within the circle a network of lines curious and
mysterious to the staring eyes of Sir David Wood.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas smiled a little under cover of his moustache as for a
moment or two he watched the other's puzzled inquiring glance. Then
he uttered a little laugh, scarcely more than a chuckle.</p>
<p>'You admire my magic circle, Sir David?'</p>
<p>Sir David started; almost he changed colour.</p>
<p>'Magic!' he echoed. 'Do you practise necromancy?'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas laughed, more freely this time. He divined the
thoughts that raced through Sir David's mind, and left the flitting
shadows of their passage on his swarthy countenance where men might
read them. Since Overbury was not only a warlock but had the
impudence to proclaim it, there should be a short way to deal with
him. King James's witch-finders should do his business.</p>
<p>'Necromancy?' Sir Thomas was echoing through his laughter. 'That
is divination by the dead. Oh, hardly that. The sorcery of this is
of a different order. This is the Circle of Thibault. You're a
travelled man, Sir David. You'll have heard of Thibault of
Antwerp.'</p>
<p>Sir David shook his head, his face forbidding. 'I do not meddle
in such matters. Thank God!' And he added. 'Ye're singularly rash
and bold, Sir Thomas.'</p>
<p>'Bold, ay. But rash! On the contrary, I am prudent. We are at
cross-purposes, I think. When a man has so many enemies among the
envious, the dishonest, and the greedy, it is well that he should
make use of some magic to protect himself in extreme cases. So I
have taken up the magic of the sword. Telomancy, it might be
called. Thibault is the greatest living master of the sword. Upon
the schools of Capoferro and Paternostier he has built a system of
his own. That circle with its lines is necessary for the perfecting
of his methods.' He turned about to Davies, who stood grinning in
the doorway, relishing his master's jest at the expense of this
stranger. 'Come hither, Lawrie. Strip off your doublet, and we'll
show Sir David the mysteries of Thibault. That is,' he added
quickly to his guest, 'if the display will afford you interest,
sir.'</p>
<p>Sir David, crestfallen a little by the explanation which
destroyed almost as soon as they had sprouted those hopes of seeing
Sir Thomas burnt at the stake, was nevertheless still profoundly
intrigued.</p>
<p>'It would interest me deeply,' said he.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas offered him a chair, and only after he had taken it
did it begin to occur to him that Overbury, having divined the
purpose of his visit, did this to mock and intimidate him at the
same time. No mean swordsman himself, however, he did not think
that he would easily be scared by any display of foreign tricks.
When these displays were over the laugh should be with him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sir Thomas rid himself of his cape-cloak, untrussed
his points, threw off his doublet, and stood forth tall and active
as a cat, the lithe proportions of him now fully displayed as he
came on guard in shirt and breeches, armed with sword alone, whilst
the slightly shorter Davies faced him with sword and dagger.</p>
<p>He explained the reason to Sir David. 'Nature, as you perceive,
has endowed me with a more than ordinary length of reach, which in
itself gives me advantages over most opponents. To render the
contest with this lad more equal, I discard the dagger. I desire
you carefully to observe my feet. It is in their movements that the
magic lies, and it is to guide them that these lines are
drawn.'</p>
<p>Davies led the attack. As Sir Thomas side-stepped, parried, and
riposted, he explained the movements, and Sir David was swordsman
enough to perceive before long the magic of it. Presently it was
Sir Thomas who attacked, and as Davies fell back before him, he
feinted suddenly, and overtook him by a lunge under his guard of
crossed sword and dagger which hit him fairly in the stomach.</p>
<p>The lunge as yet was little understood among swordsmen and Sir
David opened his eyes still wider as he looked on. A moment later,
Sir Thomas hit his opponent again by simple imbrocade achieved on a
sudden straightening of his arm after deflecting a thrust. Later
still, when Davies lunged vigorously, Sir Thomas stepped aside to
withdraw his body from the line of that hard-driven blade, and at
the same moment presented his point at the other's face over his
guard.</p>
<p>'Enough,' he cried, and stood at ease. 'That will suffice to
show Sir David the peculiar magic of my circle. Away with you,
Lawrie. If Sir David requires a closer acquaintance with Thibault,
he may take your place.'</p>
<p>But Sir David did not. As the door closed upon the departing
lad, he rose to take his leave. He had seen enough to show him that
he would never earn his thousand pounds that way. But Overbury did
not intend that he should go as easily as he had come. There was a
strain of sardonic humour in Sir Thomas, as his writings abundantly
show, which he now proposed to indulge.</p>
<p>'And now, Sir David, to business.' He was fastening his doublet
as he spoke. 'You had something to say to me, I think.' And lest
Sir David should now be reluctant to say it, Sir Thomas's next
words barred and bolted his every exit. 'You had some satisfaction
to demand of me, I think. Some accusation that I had been the means
of losing you a thousand pounds. I well remember the occasion. You
sought to make use of patronage to obtain something to which you
had no honest title. You did not first take the precaution to
inform yourself that my Lord Rochester has never made any awards
that should be against the interests of the Crown, just as unlike
most founts of patronage he has never accepted a bribe from any
suitor. This being my Lord Rochester's policy&mdash;of which at
this time of day every man is I think aware&mdash;and I being my
Lord Rochester's vehicle, it is foolish in you to have expected or
to resent any other issue. That, sir, I think, is all.'</p>
<p>And Sir Thomas smiled pleasantly into the other's angry
face.</p>
<p>'All? By God! It is by no means all. You spoke of honesty, I
think?'</p>
<p>'Does that word puzzle you? Have you no knowledge of its
meaning?'</p>
<p>''Od's wounds! You are insolent!' stormed Sir David.</p>
<p>'Unusually frank, perhaps. The matter is some two years old. Why
have your remonstrances waited until now? Is it that they are being
used as a cloak for some design you come to execute as the lackey
of my Lord Northampton?'</p>
<p>The swarthy face of Sir David Wood was livid. With difficulty he
curbed his fury so that he might answer coherently. 'You make it
very plain that your purpose is to affront me.'</p>
<p>'Am I not amiable in that? Is not that the purpose with which
you sought me? I am meeting you halfway.' He smiled ever with that
deadly, infuriating mockery. 'You cannot in reason require me to go
further.'</p>
<p>'Indeed, no,' said Sir David. 'You have gone quite far enough.'
Sir David was committed. Whatever his reluctance to engage this man
since the exhibition he had witnessed, honour did not now permit
him to withdraw. 'When will you cross to France with me?'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas shook his head. 'I have no thought of it. Affairs
demand my presence here in London. If you desire satisfaction of
me, you must obtain it here.'</p>
<p>'Here! With the edicts? The King would break the survivor.'</p>
<p>'Need that trouble you?'</p>
<p>'By God, sir, you're insufferable.'</p>
<p>'You are not required to suffer me. I shall await your
friends.'</p>
<p>Either Sir David was reduced to frenzy or he assumed it. It is
difficult to avoid a suspicion that he welcomed the way out which
the other's attitude afforded him.</p>
<p>'You count on your protection by your powerful friends at court.
But in what case am I? Who will protect me? Sir Thomas, you presume
upon your position. Again I invite you as a man of honour to cross
to France with me.'</p>
<p>'And as a man of honour I decline the invitation.'</p>
<p>Sir David gave a long stare, and finally shrugged. 'There is no
more to be said at present then.' And he moved towards the
door.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas made haste to open it for him. 'Should you change you
mind and decide to meet me here, I shall be prompt to oblige
you.'</p>
<p>Sir David disdained to answer. In the passage the waiting Davies
gave him exit to the street.</p>
<p>He went off to report his failure to her ladyship. His tale was
that the cowardly Sir Thomas refused to meet him anywhere but in
London, well knowing that no man of sense could agree to a step
that must bring down upon him the stern displeasure of the King. In
his eagerness to parade his valiance, he went too far. Sir Thomas
Overbury, he asserted violently, counted upon sheltering himself
from the consequences behind my Lord of Rochester.</p>
<p>'And if,' said her ladyship slowly, 'I were to promise you his
lordship's protection against what may come after?'</p>
<p>Sir David felt like one who has stepped foolishly into a trap.
'If your ladyship will bring me two lines in that sense above his
lordship's signature ...'</p>
<p>'You ask too much,' she interrupted him. 'How could his lordship
afford you that? It could be used to proclaim him a hirer of bully
swordsmen.'</p>
<p>Sir David was downcast. 'Yet short of that, my lady, I hardly
dare to venture.'</p>
<p>'That's it! That's it!' said she. 'You hardly dare to
venture.'</p>
<p>'Madam!' Indignation swept through him at the obvious taunt.
'You do me a deep injustice.'</p>
<p>'How can that be, Sir David! I use no more than the words in
which you have passed judgment on yourself.' She smiled a little,
pensively wistful. 'I mind me of the day on which you protested
that your life was mine in any need of it to serve me. Yet when the
moment comes&mdash;and to serve not only me but also your own
self&mdash;you are soon daunted.'</p>
<p>'Daunted!'</p>
<p>'It is clear that Sir Thomas was not daunted, and Sir Thomas has
no romantic object to allure him. You spoke of his cowardice, I
think, Sir David. Are you so sure that that fault lies in him?'</p>
<p>'You mean that it lies in me?'</p>
<p>'He is ready, at least, to do that which you confess you dare
not do.'</p>
<p>Sir David rode back to London with a black rage in his heart. To
the mortification he had suffered at the hands of Sir Thomas
Overbury, my Lady Essex had added immeasurably by telling him what
he knew to be the truth. There is in the human heart no hatred more
bitter than that which is aroused by discovery of mean verities
concerning him which a man seeks to dissemble from his own self.
The fact that Sir David had undoubtedly been stirred to love for
Lady Essex but served to deepen the complexion of his present
rancour.</p>
<p>It was a rancour that was later to bear fruit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE QUARREL</h3>
<p>The great party hostile to Rochester received in November of
that year 1612 a shattering blow in the comparatively sudden death
of its most powerful, influential, and active member, the Prince of
Wales.</p>
<p>On the 5th of the month, whilst bonfires blazed and fireworks
crackled and exploded in London streets to commemorate&mdash;as
commanded by the King&mdash;his majesty's miraculous preservation
from the gunpowder barrels of Guy Fawkes and his associates, Prince
Henry lay dying in Saint James's Palace. Never had the engaging and
able young Prince been more firmly established as the popular idol;
never had the gulf between himself and his father been wider. Out
of this grew dreadful rumours at the time, which received colour
from the fact that Mayerne, the King's foreign physician, had been
sent to attend the Prince in his last illness, and was known to
have quarrelled violently with Hammond, the Prince's doctor, on the
subject of the measures to be taken. There was a deal of talk of
the enmity between the Prince and my Lord Rochester and of the
excessive love of the King for his favourite, and from all this
conclusions were drawn very useful for the enemies of Lord
Rochester and some which even dared to go beyond him in pointing
the accusing finger.</p>
<p>But not all the rumours afloat or to be invented could diminish
my Lord Rochester, who, never more secure in the royal favour,
never exerting a greater influence over the doting King, was now at
the meridian of his power, a fixed and glowing star of unrivalled
magnitude in the firmament of the English Court, deriving an added
lustre from the partial eclipse of that group which in the past had
striven, under the &aelig;gis of Prince Henry, to curb his growth.
One who sought him at Royston in the course of the new year has
left it on record that there was no need to ask direction to his
lodgings there, since the great crowds that flocked about it fully
advertised its whereabouts.</p>
<p>The only flaw in his present happiness was that provided by
Overbury's hostility to his relations with my Lady Essex, an
hostility which had been spurred by the sense of personal peril
aroused in him by the affair with Sir David Wood. The matter
reached a sort of climax late one night during the following
April.</p>
<p>They were gay in the King's apartments at Whitehall in the
course of a protracted carousal over which his majesty presided.
But Rochester was not of the party. Indeed, of late, in the pursuit
of his love-affair and presuming upon his favour with the King, he
had been a little negligent of his duties at his majesty's side. If
the King was aggrieved, he displayed it as a woman displays her
anxieties over a lover's negligences, by increased attempts to
please him.</p>
<p>Rochester came back from Hounslow a full hour after midnight,
and going straight to his quarters was surprised to find Overbury
there with his secretary Harry Payton in attendance.</p>
<p>The consciousness that Overbury knew why he was so belated and
that he disapproved of the matter which was the occasion of it
acted as an irritant upon Rochester. He had almost a boy's sense of
having been discovered in something that must bring him a
reproof.</p>
<p>Staring from the threshold upon his friend who sat at the
writing-table, his head resting on his hand, Rochester challenged
him sharply. 'How now? Are you still up?'</p>
<p>Slowly Sir Thomas raised his head. His eyes swept over that
brilliant figure, from the diamond buckle in his plumed hat to the
rosettes on his high-heeled shoes, and a sneer curled his thin
lips.</p>
<p>'And what do you returning at this time of night? I have urgent
papers here that wait your signature.'</p>
<p>Lord Rochester came forward slowly, a scowl on his brow. Sir
Thomas waved Payton away; bade him go wait in the gallery
outside.</p>
<p>'What are these papers?' quoth Rochester.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas rose, thrusting back his chair, and proffering it by
a gesture to his lordship. The documents were spread upon the
table. 'Sit,' he said almost curtly, 'and see for yourself.'</p>
<p>His lordship looked at him, and might have observed that his
narrow face was very pale and that his eyes burned as if he had the
fever. He sat down ill-humouredly, and reached for a pen. He dashed
his signature at the foot of the first document almost without
glancing at it, and put it aside to take the next one. In a few
minutes all was done, and he flung down the pen. 'Could they not
have kept until morning?' he asked.</p>
<p>'They could not.' Overbury's tone was cold. He had remained
standing by the table. 'They are of the utmost urgency. A courier
waits below to ride to Dover. These papers are for France, and they
should have gone long since. But to be sure the whole progress of
the State must stand still while you seek the company of your
woman.'</p>
<p>'Woman?' cried Rochester coming sharply to his feet: 'Woman, did
you say?'</p>
<p>'Aye! And base! Like all her lewd brood, from her bawd of a
mother.'</p>
<p>He stood straight and tense, and by the quality of the anger in
him seemed a man at once of fire and ice, so that at one and the
same time he chilled and scorched his lordship with his person and
words.</p>
<p>Some curious magnetic quality of dominance he had to restrain
Rochester from striking him in that moment. 'Will you deny it? Can
you? Cast back your mind upon all that there has been: her
relations with you whilst her husband was abroad; her commerce
since with that bawd Turner and with filthy necromancers,
practising the Devil knows what evil rites to gain her ends with
you and Essex.'</p>
<p>'Be silent, man! In God's name!' Rochester was livid. The door
to the gallery stood ajar and Overbury's voice was vibrant and
far-reaching. 'Be silent, or I'll strike you dead!'</p>
<p>'And like the bee slay your own self in killing,' sneered
Overbury. 'For without me, I tell you again, you are nought. I have
borne you upon my shoulders, and from these have you climbed to the
eminence you hold. Yet now all my pains and all my patient labours
are to be turned to nought by the ruin of your honour and yourself,
which is what will follow for you upon this marriage. You go not
forward in the matter by my consent. I warn you now that if you do,
you had best look to stand on your own legs.'</p>
<p>But now his lordship met sneer with sneer. 'Why, here's a
threat! You may leave me when you please, and the Devil go with
you. My own legs are straight enough to bear me up, I warrant
you.'</p>
<p>'You may find it otherwise; for your tailor and I have made a
man of you between us.'</p>
<p>They glared at each other, these two who had been as Damon and
Pythias, and hatred was in the eyes of each. Each curbed himself by
an effort from giving it the expression of physical violence. It
was Rochester who spoke at last, in a dull, concentrated tone.</p>
<p>'You have said things, sir, which may be neither forgotten nor
forgiven. Things for which as God's my life I will be even with you
yet.'</p>
<p>'So be it,' said Overbury with ominous quiet, the volcano of his
passion smothered to outward view. 'I desire that to-morrow we
part. Let me have that portion which is due to me, and I will leave
you free to yourself.'</p>
<p>'So that you leave me free of you, it is what I most desire,' he
was answered, and upon that Lord Rochester flung out of the room in
a passion.</p>
<p>Overbury stood there for a spell after he had gone, immobile,
thoughtful. Then mechanically he folded the documents into a
package, tied and sealed it, and, summoning Payton, handed it to
him for delivery to the waiting courier. That done he departed the
palace, and walking like a man in a dream, went home to his house
in King Street. But not yet to bed. The April dawn was near when at
last Sir Thomas sought his couch. Nor did he sleep even then. The
turmoil of his thoughts kept sleep afar. Here was the end of all
his soaring hopes and proud ambitions. His years of patient toil
were wasted. To-morrow he would be nought again, he who had wielded
an almost kingly power, whose smile had been courted, whose nod
obeyed. The bond into which he had entered with Robert Carr, when
first he had come five years ago to lift him by the power of his
genius to the dizzy eminence on which he stood, was broken now. The
breach, as he had said, meant ruin to them both. And all this for a
woman, a golden-headed, blue-eyed enchantress, whose beauty, which
would stale with custom, blinded the fool to everything else within
his purview.</p>
<p>In these bitter reflections was the night consumed, and it was
in bitterness that he went next day to that workroom of theirs in
Whitehall, there to await Rochester, so that they might come to
their final accounts and close this partnership which had been so
portentous to them both.</p>
<p>By dinner-time he had not yet seen his lordship. The day wore
on, and still his lordship did not come. He sent to seek him more
than once. But each time his messenger brought word that my Lord
Rochester was nowhere in the palace.</p>
<p>Unopened despatches lay upon his table awaiting attention. To
clerks and secretaries who came to him for orders upon this matter
or upon that, Sir Thomas vacantly returned the answer that they had
best await the coming of his lordship. He accounted himself already
a dismissed servant, presently to depart almost as empty-handed as
he had come. For just as Rochester had through all his time of
power remained incorruptible, so had Overbury. Looking back now, he
dubbed himself a fool for his honesty. Another, foreseeing the
possibility at least of such an end as this, would have taken
advantage of his position to enrich himself. He pondered these
things now in his bitterness, as he sat there, waiting, dejected of
countenance and blear-eyed from lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Lord Rochester, meanwhile, was spending most of that critical
day closeted with my Lord Privy Seal. By last night's action Sir
Thomas had finally accomplished the very thing he sought to avoid,
and the dread of which had been at the heart of his rage. He had
definitely thrown Rochester into the ready arms of the Earl of
Northampton.</p>
<p>Northampton between elation and alarm had heard him out, his
grey predatory old countenance expressionless as a mask.</p>
<p>'We must seal the mouth of this damned scab without delay and
before he can do more mischief.'</p>
<p>'As to that,' said Rochester, 'there's an end to him. It was
agreed last night between us. We part at once, and he shifts for
himself hereafter.'</p>
<p>There was a faint note of contempt in the voice that answered
him.</p>
<p>'That's not the end of him by any means. He knows too much; far,
far too much. You have been so free in your commerce with him that
he may even hold evidence of what he knows; and even without
evidence he could deliver and maintain by his infernal wits a tale
so formidable that he would entirely wreck the chances of the
nullity when the commission shortly comes to sit.'</p>
<p>'God help us!' cried Rochester, in such dismay that Northampton
laughed outright, if none too pleasantly.</p>
<p>'It's a timely prayer,' said Northampton in derision. 'The
ground of our petition is about as firm as quicksand. Only Essex's
despair made such a document possible. As it is, the Archbishop has
already expressed his hostility, and it will need the utmost care
in the appointments to ensure a commission which will give a
majority in our favour. Leave Overbury free to talk&mdash;perhaps
even to come forward as a sworn witness to the things that are
actually within his knowledge&mdash;and there's an end to all our
hopes.'</p>
<p>The truth sent a chill through Rochester. 'What then?' he asked
helplessly.</p>
<p>They were in the library. Northampton was sitting at his
writing-table, his profile clear-cut against the window on his
left. He leaned his head on his hand, and his low-lidded eyes were
hidden from the younger man. His voice came soft and sibilant,
pregnant with terrible significance.</p>
<p>'His silence must be absolutely ensured.'</p>
<p>Rochester seemed to crumple in his chair. There was no mistaking
the meaning of that terrible old man, and Robin, whose nature was
warm, generous, and kindly, was aghast at the practical
ruthlessness of this veteran in intrigue. He recalled a March
twilight in a firelit room at Whitehall, when he had passionately
cried out against the splendours which were but evidences of his
shame in being no better than a fribble despised by all men of
worth. He remembered how Overbury had offered himself, the glowing
promises he had made of what should come of their association. He
could see him again, tall, straight, and slender, his sombre
garments redly illumined by the leaping firelight, putting forth
his hand to the clasp which was as the seal upon the unwritten bond
between them. And he heard his own voice saying, 'Stand by me, Tom,
to make common fortune with me, as I with you,' to which he was to
add a moment later, 'It is a bond in which I'll never fail of my
part.' Swiftly his mind surveyed that long and at times arduous
road which in the last five years they had travelled together. How
loyally in all things Overbury had kept to the bond, how generously
and utterly he had given the service which he promised!</p>
<p>And now on this April day he sat here in this fine room, with
all its evidences of wealth and culture about him, and listened to
its owner, this old man who, whatever else he had learnt in more
than seventy years of life, had never yet learnt pity, proposing
coldly and emotionlessly that Overbury should be blotted out lest
his tongue should threaten the aims of that same old man's
ambition. For Rochester was under no delusion on the subject of
this ambition. Overbury had made that clear, and the conviction of
Overbury's accuracy came to his lordship now with the perception of
Northampton's ruthlessness.</p>
<p>Suddenly he broke the silence, to cry out, shuddering: 'Never
that! Never!' And he rose as he spoke, urged forward by his
emotion.</p>
<p>The pallid eyelids of the old Earl were suddenly raised. They
seemed to roll back like the membrane from some reptilian eye, and
two bright steely points stabbed sharply at the young man.</p>
<p>'Never what?' quoth he in his passionless voice. 'I have made no
proposals. You answer your own thoughts, sir, rather than my
words.'</p>
<p>Rochester moistened his lips as he stared back to meet that
burning gaze.</p>
<p>'What ... What, then, is in your lordship's mind?' he asked, his
tongue stumbling over the question.</p>
<p>Faintly Northampton smiled. 'Why, nothing yet, beyond the fact I
have stated. Overbury's silence must be assured. How to do it is
yet to be considered. Could he be bought, do you suppose?'</p>
<p>Mechanically Rochester shook his head. He could not yet free
himself from the conviction of Northampton's earlier meaning. 'No
gold would buy him.'</p>
<p>'Preferment, then?'</p>
<p>Rochester turned away, and walked the length of the room in
thought, his chin sunk to his breast. Slowly he came back. An idea
had dawned in his mind,</p>
<p>'I might secure him an embassy abroad.'</p>
<p>Northampton considered. 'It might serve, provided he were sent
far enough away.'</p>
<p>'We need at this moment an envoy in Muscovy. The appointment is
being considered now.'</p>
<p>'That should be far enough. Will he accept it, do you
think?'</p>
<p>'I cannot answer for that. But in the pass to which things have
come, it is very probable.'</p>
<p>'If he refused it ...' Northampton checked on the thought. There
was a sudden gleam from his steely eyes. ''Ods life! I have it. I
see a way to seal him up until you're safely married and his
blabbing can do no harm.' And Northampton expounded a plan in which
he displayed so much craft and guile that Rochester was
awe-stricken by the glimpse it afforded into the old man's
mind.</p>
<p>It was a plan ample for their present needs, and that hardly
less would serve, Rochester was quick to perceive. When at last he
departed to Whitehall, he bore with him the resolve to act upon
it.</p>
<p>He found Sir Thomas waiting for him in that room of their close
and intimate association, that room in which their joint fortunes
had been so gradually and laboriously consolidated. Rochester
advanced briskly, and held out his hand. Pale and stern, Sir Thomas
rose, looked at the hand and then into his lordship's handsome
face.</p>
<p>'How now?' he asked almost mistrustfully.</p>
<p>'For the sake of all that's gone between us, Tom, if part we
must, at least let us not part enemies. Something I may yet do for
you, even though henceforth we go separate ways.'</p>
<p>A moment yet Overbury hesitated before taking the proffered
hand, and when at last he took it there was no warmth in his grip.
Rochester set his other hand on his friend's shoulder.</p>
<p>'We were distempered with each other last night. We uttered
words which should never have passed between you and me.'</p>
<p>'Whose was the fault?'</p>
<p>'Leave that. We have unfortunately come to a pass in which we
can no longer stand together. You disapprove the course I take. You
are determined to oppose it, and I as determined to pursue it. We
cannot agree. So that's the end of that. But it need not be the end
of all between us.'</p>
<p>'I do not see what's left.'</p>
<p>'What is to come to you, Tom? What shift will you make for
yourself?'</p>
<p>And now Overbury laughed, but with an under-current of
bitterness. 'Why, in your own words last night, my own legs are
straight enough to bear me up. I'll tread my ways upon them, never
fear.'</p>
<p>'I might help to make those ways pleasant, profitable, of
consequence. How if I brought the King to offer you the Paris
Embassy, sending Digby to Muscovy instead?'</p>
<p>'So that's the aim. To send me packing.'</p>
<p>'But at least not empty-handed, Tom. At least with an honourable
office which may lead you in time to the fulfilment of your every
ambition.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas thought of the Treasurership which he had accounted
so nearly within his grasp, and by comparison with which an embassy
was but a paltry affair. Still it was honourable, as his lordship
said. Certainly better than going back to seek a precarious
livelihood in the inns of court; and with his talents it might
conceivably lead him in time to better things.</p>
<p>So, like the philosopher he was at heart, he thrust down his
bitterness, and made his peace with Rochester upon those terms.</p>
<p>It was agreed that what had passed between them should be
forgotten; that Overbury on his side should cease all active
opposition to the divorcement of Lady Essex, and should not either
by word or deed throw any obstacle in the way of its
accomplishment. Until his future was settled, he would continue
here to discharge the functions of his secretaryship.</p>
<p>His gloom and dejection scarcely mitigated, Sir Thomas sat down
again to open the despatches which had lain all day untouched upon
his table.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER
XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAP</h3>
<p>The Lord Privy Seal was closeted with the King.</p>
<p>His majesty had supped in his bedchamber, as was often his
habit, alone save for the three gentlemen who had waited upon him.
He had washed his fingers, and wiped them on the napkin Haddington
had proffered him. Then my Lord of Northampton had been admitted,
the gentlemen in attendance had been dismissed to the antechamber,
and the Earl and the King were alone together.</p>
<p>His majesty, who was now approaching fifty, had aged
considerably since that day in the tilt-yard, seven years ago, when
first he had taken notice of Robert Carr. Persistent gluttony and
excessive drinking of sweet sugary wines had combined with
indolence to dispose him towards obesity of body above limbs which
remained shrunken. His florid face was growing wrinkled, his eyes
more lachrymose than ever.</p>
<p>He lolled in an armchair, untidily, his quilted doublet
half-unbuttoned, and his sandy head was covered by a hat, a black
velvet cone with a jewelled buckle to secure the band. On the table
before him stood a beaker and a goblet. He had filled the latter
with dark sirupy Frontignac, which he loved to sip very gradually
as he talked.</p>
<p>The Earl having announced that the matter which brought him was
of a certain gravity was invited by the King to speak with complete
frankness. Yet he hesitated a little, standing there beyond the
table, his chin in his lean claw, his beady eyes fixed and
thoughtful.</p>
<p>'There is,' he said at last, 'a certain scab who is uttering
rumours, dark hints, and other false lewdnesses which may come to
embarrass the nullity commission.'</p>
<p>'What's that?' The sudden change of the royal countenance warmed
Northampton with the assurance that he touched his majesty in a
tender place.</p>
<p>For days King James had toiled with pedantic infatuation upon
the matter. He had pored over Scripture, the Fathers of the Church,
and the Laws of England.</p>
<p>He had resolved deep problems of civil and canon law on the
subject of divorcement; he had particularly considered the knotty
question of whether a petition for divorcement could, in any case,
be made on behalf of a woman; and he had spent long hours in
cogitation and in setting down the fruits of all this labour before
reaching the decision to appoint a commission. When that decision
was reached, it was merely so that an authoritative body of lawyers
and divines should pronounce the judgment which his majesty had
already reached.</p>
<p>Not his 'Counterblast to Tobacco,' not the infinitely more
learned and profound work on Demonology, not even the 'Basilicon
Doron,' or any other of his pedantic outbursts, had ever brought
him such rich delight in his own erudition as this treatise upon
the case of Lady Essex, a treatise which ransacked all history,
divinity, and law, and must if published leave the world aghast at
the stupendous compass of his learning; a treatise which, if he had
been the meanest clerk instead of King of Britain, must still have
made his name immortal.</p>
<p>And now he was told that some kennel rat by the use of scandal
was at work to nibble at the foundations of this mighty edifice. He
could not have heard aright. Therefore he demanded that his
lordship should repeat to him this incredible thing. His lordship
repeated it, and added to it a little.</p>
<p>'This scab dares in his effrontery to criticise the policy of
your majesty in appointing the commission.'</p>
<p>''Ud's death!' James almost choked on the oath. 'My policy? My
policy! Who's this ye speak of?'</p>
<p>'His name is Overbury. Sir Thomas Overbury.'</p>
<p>The anger that now arose in King James was a different thing
from the erstwhile indignation of his offended vanity. It turned
him pale by its addition to the score against a man whom already he
hated so implacably. His goggle eyes stared at the Earl. His
jewelled fingers shook so that they were forced to abandon the
mechanical attempt to take up the cup before him.</p>
<p>It was some time before his majesty spoke. When he did so his
voice was strainedly calm.</p>
<p>'And he talks, you say, of this policy of mine?'</p>
<p>'So much, your majesty, that it is high time he were
silenced.'</p>
<p>'It is what I'm thinking.'</p>
<p>Northampton had never seen the King so grim. Never had he beheld
so completely in eclipse that quality in James which had led
Overbury to speak of him once in private to a crony as a <i>faux
bonhomme</i>. He sat awhile huddled there, his jewelled fingers
toying with the buttons of his doublet. 'If after this, Robin
should still stand between that rat and me ...' The sentence closed
in an inaudible mumble.</p>
<p>Presently his lordship ventured a comment on a sigh. 'Lord
Rochester has a great kindness for the rogue.'</p>
<p>'Too great a kindness,' growled the King. 'Had it not been for
Robin, I'd have laid him by the heels long since. And even now
Robin will come storming to me and cluttering my wits with his
clavering in defence of this eye-sorrow. But, by God's death, I'll
not be moved to weakness this time.'</p>
<p>Yet even as he took the oath he seemed shaken by a doubt of his
power to fulfil it if it ran counter to the wishes of his pampered
favourite, and by rage to think that his darling Rochester should
waste such love on that worthless rogue. Misgivings, jealousies,
and choler brought him almost to the point of tears. He slobbered
fearfully. 'Some years since,' he complained, 'I'd ha' sent him
Ambassador to France, paying even that price to be rid of him from
about the court, so that my sight should not be troubled by him.
But Robin would not have it. Robin must keep him here beside him,
never heeding my heart-scald. 'Ud's death!'</p>
<p>'If your majesty were to offer him the same again&mdash;some
foreign embassy&mdash;my Lord Rochester might not now oppose it. He
has some knowledge of Overbury's loose talk, and would I think be
as glad as any of us to have him away, at least for the present
time.'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay! But would he go? Would he go, the insolent, swaggering
carle?'</p>
<p>Northampton raised his shoulders. 'If he did not ...' And there
abruptly he checked, so abruptly that the King stared up at him
with his pale, bulging, watery eyes.</p>
<p>'What's in your thoughts, man?'</p>
<p>'If he did not go,' said Northampton slowly and very quietly,'
there would be the Tower.' He paused to add in the same quiet tone
the explanation. 'For disobedience to a royal command; for an
affront to majesty.'</p>
<p>They remained looking into each other's eyes, and the craft in
Northampton's was slowly mirrored in the King's.</p>
<p>'We'll be hoping,' said the King slowly, 'that he disobeys. He'd
be safer a deal in the Tower than in Muscovy, and he deserves it
better.'</p>
<p>Northampton's eyes narrowed. 'It might be contrived, Sire, by
the exercise of a little adroitness, that he should refuse the
embassy.'</p>
<p>'And who's to exercise it? The adroitness?'</p>
<p>'If your majesty will trust me in this.'</p>
<p>'You'll prove yourself trustworthy, indeed, ay, and adroit,
indeed, if you can bring about so desirable a consummation.'</p>
<p>'I shall hope to deserve your majesty's approval.'</p>
<p>When presently he was dismissed, it was in the assurance that by
the interview he was a gainer in two senses: the result should
enhance his credit with the King and rid the court of the plaguily
inconvenient Sir Thomas Overbury.</p>
<p>Interviews followed between Northampton and Rochester in which
the utmost frankness was employed, and between Rochester and the
King, which were less ingenuous. It was Rochester who broached the
matter to his majesty upon the morrow, in the course of their daily
discussion of affairs.</p>
<p>'The embassy at Muscovy awaits the appointment of an envoy.'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay,' said the King. 'Have ye any names to lay before the
Privy Council?'</p>
<p>Rochester paused a moment. 'Sir Thomas Overbury is about to quit
my service.'</p>
<p>'Is he so? Ah, well! I'll not pretend that I'm not glad of it. I
never loved the cullion, nor ever knew why you should love him. But
what has he to do with Muscovy?'</p>
<p>'He is better qualified for that or any other embassy than any
man I know. Your majesty held some such opinion of him once when
you offered him the embassy in Paris.'</p>
<p>'Did I so? Belike it was to be rid of him, Rabbie. Ah, well,
lad, Muscovy'll be better for him than Paris. Russia is a country
in which he may cool his super-abundant heats. And it'll take him
farther from me, though hardly far enough for my pleasure. Ye see,
I'm frank about the carle. If you ask it for him he shall have the
office.'</p>
<p>And so it fell out that two days later Sir Thomas Overbury
received a visit from the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, who came
formally in the King's name to offer him the embassy to Russia.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas was taken aback. Muscovy was not Paris. In Paris,
with his fluent French and his close intimacy with French affairs,
he could rapidly impress himself as a man of weight. But Muscovy
was altogether different. He had no Russian, knew little of
Muscovite ways and less of its politics. Moreover, it was almost as
far as the antipodes. Had Rochester, he asked himself, but played a
game with him?</p>
<p>Of all this, however, he allowed no glimpse to escape him.
Soberly he received the proposal, and soberly answered it that he
would take time to consider, an answer which caused the old
Chancellor to raise his brows. For a man of Overbury's apparent
position at court an embassage was a great honour, the acceptance
of which should require no reflection. Moreover, the offer was in
the nature of a royal command. Lord Ellesmere, however, did not
stay to argue with him, but left him to the consideration for which
Sir Thomas demanded time.</p>
<p>All the time he required was to lay the matter before Rochester,
who heard him out with a serene countenance.</p>
<p>'The King,' he was answered by the favourite, 'is loth to
displace Digby, who has served him well in Paris. But your reasons
are just enough, and if you refuse the offer of Muscovy, I nothing
doubt that France or the Low Countries with which you are so well
acquainted will presently be opened out to you.'</p>
<p>Sir Thomas was relieved by this assurance, and, trusting to it,
desired Lord Rochester to inform the King that respectfully he
declined an appointment for which he did not feel himself
equipped.</p>
<p>Two days thereafter, late in the afternoon, there came for Sir
Thomas a summons to appear before the Privy Council. He went
without hesitation or any apprehension of what awaited him.</p>
<p>With his brisk step he passed between the two scarlet yeomen of
the guard who kept the portal, and confidently entered the Council
Chamber.</p>
<p>It was a room of moderate proportions, hung with Flemish
tapestries, and lighted by a high window at the farther end,
between whose mullions the leaded panes were aglow in the evening
sunlight. A long table covered by a Persian carpet occupied the
middle of the room, and the lords of the Council were ranged in
their seats on either side of it. At a lesser table apart sat the
clerk with his scribes.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, tall and elegant in his rich dark suit and
delicately starched ruff, came to take his stand at the vacant end
of the Council table. Facing him, the King's great gilded chair
stood empty, and as his keen eyes raked the two lines of
Councillors, gliding over the Lords Northampton, Pembroke,
Nottingham, Southampton, and the rest, he observed on his right
another empty chair. Lord Rochester, too, was absent from his
place.</p>
<p>All eyes were turned upon him, and he knew that not a single
pair could he count as friendly. Not a lord present who was not
secretly his enemy, however much the greater part of them might in
the past have expressed a spurious friendliness which did not
deceive him, whilst some, like Pembroke and Shrewsbury, had ever
been avowedly hostile.</p>
<p>Although he had ruffled it for years on equal terms with them,
yet he was not one of them; and they made him conscious of it now,
allowed him to perceive in their bearing their contempt of him.</p>
<p>His fine sensitiveness was quick to apprehend all this. And yet
it scarcely galled him. What they were, they were by right of
birth, a right by which the most worthless may parade the honours
carved him by a forbear. What he was, he was by right of his own
worth, his talents, and his industry. They were but descendants. He
was of the stuff of which ancestors are made.</p>
<p>In that consciousness he stood calm and firm under the volley of
their glances.</p>
<p>The Lord Chancellor rose in his place to give him formal
welcome, and formally to repeat the offer of the Russian
embassy.</p>
<p>Calmly Overbury announced his well-considered reasons for
declining an appointment to which he did not feel himself competent
to do credit. To answer the haughty stare with which his refusal
was received, Sir Thomas added to the reasons already expressed to
Rochester in private certain excuses on the grounds of health. The
climate of Russia was of a rigour which he did not feel himself
physically able to confront.</p>
<p>But before he had come to the end of this, Lord Pembroke had
interrupted him.</p>
<p>'Sir Thomas, I'll make so bold as to remind you that the King
intends this gracious offer for your good and preferment, and I'll
beg you to weigh well your answer.'</p>
<p>Overbury looked round the board, and everywhere met hostile eyes
and sneering lips. Did they venture not only to browbeat him, but
to do it with contempt? He felt singularly alone in that moment,
like the hart when it turns to face the hounds that race to pull it
down. But like the hart at bay, he fronted them boldly, and
answered them out of the anger which their enmity was kindling in
him, and also out of his trust in Rochester.</p>
<p>'I have weighed it, may it please your lordships. It is not my
desire to leave my country for any preferment in the world. But
since the King commands, I will submit to go, provided that I am
sent to some place where I can serve with advantage to England and
honour to myself. Russia, my lords, is not of these for the reasons
I have given.'</p>
<p>The Lord Chancellor compressed his lips and inclined his head.
Less to Overbury than to their lordships he announced that he must
take the King's pleasure in the matter, and upon that went out,
leaving Overbury where he stood.</p>
<p>Their lordships took no further heed of him, but broke into
murmured talk among themselves. Conscious that he was being
deliberately ignored, he continued to stand there, keeping his head
high and his glance steady for all that every moment that passed
added to the calculated indignity of his position.</p>
<p>They were bitter moments for Sir Thomas, the more bitter since
in the pass to which things were come the future was likely to
offer little opportunity of paying off the score with these
gentlemen who now so calculatedly insulted him by their disregard.
But for my Lady Essex how different would all this have been. But
for the schemes of that scaly-headed Northampton yonder, who peered
at him now and again from under his reptilian eyelids, these
gentlemen, whatever the hostility in their hearts, would be fawning
upon him cap in hand, as they had fawned aforetime, knowing him for
the man who ruled the favourite who ruled the King.</p>
<p>The moments passed leaden-footed, and there were many of them to
pass before at long last the Lord Chancellor, moving gravely in his
fur-edged robes, re&euml;ntered. He was followed by an officer and
two yeomen of the guard, whose appearance made some stir among the
gentlemen about the Council table.</p>
<p>Overbury, too proud to yield to curiosity and turn his head, did
not yet see them, and certainly did not suspect their presence, or
else he might have had some indication of what was coming.</p>
<p>Lord Ellesmere advanced to the Council table. 'His majesty, may
it please your lordships, is rightly indignant at that, in his own
words, he cannot obtain so much of a gentleman and one of his own
servants as to accept an honourable employment from him. Rightly he
accounts this insolence of Sir Thomas Overbury's a matter of high
contempt, and he commands us to commit him for it.'</p>
<p>He made a sign to the clerk of the Council, who thereupon grew
busy upon a parchment, whilst Sir Thomas, recovering from his
momentary stupefaction, broke forth into protest.</p>
<p>'My Lord Chancellor, will you give me the law of that?' He was
white, and his dark eyes smouldered wrathfully.</p>
<p>'The law of it?' The Lord Chancellor raised his grey eyebrows.
Someone at the table laughed.</p>
<p>'Ay, the law of it,' insisted Overbury. 'I am myself more than
something of a lawyer, my lord, and before you lend yourself to
this I demand to know by what law of England the King can compel a
subject to leave the country.'</p>
<p>'You shall have law enough to comfort you ere all is done,' he
was assured, and then the clerk approached him with the document he
had been preparing.</p>
<p>Those preparations had been suspiciously brief, as Overbury was
presently to remember. Meanwhile he was still protesting and
demanding, no one heeding him, and he was still at it when the
warrant, signed by the Lord Chancellor and countersigned by
Pembroke, was handed to the waiting officer.</p>
<p>Only then, as they ranged themselves on either side of him, did
Overbury become aware of the two yeomen of the guard. He looked
from one to the other with dilating eyes. Then, commanding himself,
and sweeping their lordships once more with his haughty glance, he
took his leave of them.</p>
<p>'Well, well, my lords! It seems we must argue this another
day.'</p>
<p>They led him out, and marched him swiftly along the gallery, and
so by way of the privy gardens to Whitehall Stairs. Not until he
stood there and beheld the waiting barge of the Lieutenant of the
Tower did he perceive how complete were the preparations, and
understand the trap that had been laid for him. But as he stepped
aboard the barge there was more scorn in his heart than dismay.
They were fools, indeed, if they thought him a man so easily to be
repressed, and whatever followed he would see to it that Robin
should repent his perfidy. Thus, neither his courage nor his
confidence deserted him. Better for him had it been otherwise.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>TEMPTATION</h3>
<p>The arrest of Sir Thomas Overbury set town and court agog with
rumours. The most prevalent of them was that it was no more than a
prelude to the fall of Lord Rochester himself.</p>
<p>This was also the most foolish of them, since there can be
little doubt that his majesty already had in view the further
aggrandisement of his beloved Robin on the occasion of his
marriage, to which the nullity commission should clear the way. And
to ensure that the nullity commission should not fail in this, his
majesty continued to give his exalted attention to the suit.</p>
<p>He went out of town, carrying Rochester with him; but whether at
Theobald's, Newmarket, Royston, or elsewhere, and whatever else was
at hand for his entertainment&mdash;be it hunting, hawking, or
cock-fighting&mdash;the enthusiasm of his majesty's labours knew no
abatement. He still pondered and wrote for the enlightenment of the
divines and lawyers who were to deal with the suit, and was so
transported by his own learning and casuistry that he almost lost
sight of the object to be served in his delight over the manner of
serving it. Had the desire to please his darling Robin by setting
free for him the lady of his choice been entirely absent, had the
parties concerned in this divorcement been utter strangers to him,
he still must have delighted in so extraordinary an occasion to
parade talents whose compass, now that he came to employ them,
astounded even himself.</p>
<p>In this stage stood matters some three weeks after Overbury's
consignment to the Tower, by when the commission, headed by the
honest, God-fearing Archbishop Abbot, came to sit, and the fruits
of its first sittings were laid before the King at Theobald's.</p>
<p>In the course of his closely reasoned opposition to the suit,
the Archbishop desired to know by what text of Scripture of either
the Old or the New Testament a man might have warrant, on the
grounds set forth by the petition, to make a nullity of a marriage
solemnly celebrated; or what ancient Fathers, Greek or Latin, or
ancient Councils, General or Provincial, so interpret any text. And
he proceeded to quote Melanchthon, Pezelius, Hemingius, and several
others.</p>
<p>Abbot's gravely couched exposition threw the King into a
slobbering rage. Was the Archbishop a knave or a fool that he so
utterly ignored the masterly notes the King had sent him for his
guidance, and still dared to ask questions which the King did not
hesitate in his reply to stigmatise as 'preposterous'?</p>
<p>From that moment Viscount Rochester was for nothing in the
matter. His majesty fought now, not to pleasure his favourite, but
to vindicate his own views and his own authority. It became a duel
between the King affronted in his vanity, and the Archbishop
entrenched in his honesty. Fiercely the King went to work again
upon a lengthy dissertation to confound the Archbishop's
arguments.</p>
<p>Abbot nevertheless stood firm, and by his firmness so far swayed
the doctors and divines who sat with him that by July it came to be
generally known that the commission was divided in its findings.
Let the King rage as he might, a deadlock had been reached, from
which the only issue appeared to be through the appointment of a
fresh commission.</p>
<p>The delay was vexatious to the lovers; but infinitely more
vexatious were certain rumours which showed that not even his
confinement in the Tower could suffice to muzzle Overbury. He had
been receiving visitors, and he had been writing letters, and the
tone of his utterances grew daily more minatory in a measure as the
continuation of his imprisonment increased his indignation at the
perfidy of Rochester.</p>
<p>To his first upbraidings, Rochester had replied in mild and
friendly terms, assuring Sir Thomas that if he would exercise a
little patience all should presently be well with him, and that
upon his enlargement would follow some honourable office to
compensate him.</p>
<p>In this there is no cause to doubt that his lordship was
sincere. All he desired was that Sir Thomas should be kept close
until the nullity were pronounced and he could do no further
mischief.</p>
<p>When Overbury complained in June that he was ill as a result of
his confinement, Rochester in a letter of solicitude for his health
sent him a medicinal powder, and upon the heels of that his own
physician Craig to minister to him.</p>
<p>Northampton, however, was inspired by no such gentleness. His
relations with Rochester had now become of the closest. As a result
of this, when the King and his favourite went out of town,
Northampton stepped into the position of First Secretary of State.
He directed the courses of Winwood and Lake, who nominally held the
Treasurership between them, and he was virtually head of the
realm.</p>
<p>He took steps at once to increase the rigours of Overbury's
confinement. He sent orders to the Tower that Sir Thomas was no
longer to be allowed the exercise of walking in the grounds, that
he was to be denied all visitors, and that his man Davies, who had
hitherto attended him, should be dismissed.</p>
<p>The faithful lad wept when he received the order to go, offered
in vain to be shut up with Sir Thomas in his prison if they would
allow him to continue to serve him.</p>
<p>Next, and as a warning to other visitors of Overbury's who might
be disposed to talk, Northampton ordered the arrest of a gentleman
named Sir Robert Killigrew, who was known to have repeated
Overbury's assertion that he was in possession of knowledge which
when divulged would bring the Essex nullity suit to nought.</p>
<p>Nor did his measures end there. Sir William Wadd, the Lieutenant
of the Tower, was already under a cloud over the matter of the
escape of Seymour&mdash;the Lady Arabella's lover&mdash;from
prison. Detested by Northampton for his remorseless persecution of
Catholics, the Earl lent a ready ear to the accusations against him
of dishonesty in the matter of some jewels belonging to the Lady
Arabella, and using this as his pretext avenged himself of the
knight's laxity concerning Overbury, by depriving him of his
office.</p>
<p>In his place and, on the recommendation of Sir William Monson,
the Master of the Armoury, Northampton appointed a staid, dull, and
elderly Lincolnshire gentleman, Sir Gervase Elwes, to the
office.</p>
<p>These measures sufficed to reassure the Lord Privy Seal; but
they were inadequate to allay the alarm of his niece.</p>
<p>The dreadful rumours, which were already affording matter for
the ballad-mongers in Paul's Walk, came to renew the dismay in
which she wrote to her lover, absent in the King's train, and to
fill her with shame and indignation to find her name a subject for
rhymed ribaldries. She wearied her father, her mother, her
brothers, and even old Northampton with her bitter plaints. And
they accounted her unreasonable in that she would not be quieted by
the Lord Privy Seal's measures to tighten the bonds of the prisoner
in the Tower. Only Anne Turner listened to her with the sympathy
and feeling which it seemed to her that her case deserved.</p>
<p>They were on the Italianate terrace of the house at Hounslow,
occupying a stone seat on which a carpet and some cushions had been
spread. It was a hot and breathless day of July, and in the garden
below the shrubs hung motionless and listless under the bright
sunshine.</p>
<p>Her ladyship leaned forward, one elbow on her knee, her little
pointed chin cupped in the palm of her hand, and she looked
straight before her as she spoke.</p>
<p>'There is not one amongst them all who serves me for myself, or
ever has done. Not my Lord Northampton, nor my father, nor my
mother. They married me to improve their own fortunes. Now they are
lending a hand to my divorcement because they perceive how it may
be to the family advantage. Well might my Lord Northampton say one
day that he thanked God he was not a woman; that to be a woman is
an indignity. I have been made to savour that, God knows! I am
savouring it now. What dignity have they left me? To what
indignities have they not driven me? None knows better than
yourself, Turner. In my despair I sought the assistance of your
warlock Forman, and lent myself to abominations at the memory of
which I burn with shame. Then there were the indignities of
Chartley; that long-drawn contest; the insult of being wooed by a
man by whom I was repelled; the physical fear in which I went of
him, justified by his manhandling of me. And with all this, as if
it were not torture enough for any woman, the agony of my yearnings
for Robin, the distracting thought that we two, who love each other
as sincerely as man and woman ever loved, were held apart by the
infamous detestable bond of my unholy marriage.'</p>
<p>The little widow sought to soothe her. She set an arm about her
shoulders.</p>
<p>'Why dwell on all this now? It is to harass you for no good
purpose. All that is over and done with at last, and the future is
to make amends for what you have suffered.'</p>
<p>'Is it, Turner? Is it? Who will assure me of that? What peace of
mind is there for me while that fellow Overbury has it in his power
to ruin all even now? Think of it, Turner! After all that I have
endured, to find this villain threatening to lay everything waste
again, and this merely for ends of his own, merely out of
vindictiveness to find his own ambition thwarted. What have I ever
done to the wretch that he should bring this evil upon me? Is it my
fault that he has been sent to the Tower and that he has lost all
that he possessed and his hopes of more? What need had he to meddle
between my lord and me? Why could he not have had some thought for
my wretchedness? Why should he deny me the little peace I have
bought by years of suffering? Why? In God's name, Turner, why?'</p>
<p>Her stony impassivity was gone. She was in tears now, a panting,
desperate, broken creature.</p>
<p>'Quiet, child! Quiet!' the widow crooned, tightening her grip of
the heaving shoulders. 'All that is now safely overpast. Let him
lie and rot where he is. He can do no further harm.'</p>
<p>'Can he not? How do I know that? Remember that foul ballad you
brought me in which my name is held to the lewd mockery of lewd
men. If he is not himself the author of it, at least it could have
had no author but for the wickednesses he had uttered against me. A
little more of this and it will suffice to make an end of the
nullity. Already those words of his spoken in the Tower are ringing
through London, to encourage my Lord Archbishop in his obstinate
courses, as I hear.'</p>
<p>'Peace, child! Peace! It is not so bad as your fears make it
appear.'</p>
<p>'Peace?' she laughed fiercely in her grief and bitterness.
'There is no peace for me while that man lives. Himself he has said
it, Turner.'</p>
<p>'Then kill him.' The widow heard herself pronounce the words
before she was even aware that the thought was in her mind.</p>
<p>The Countess echoed them. 'Kill him!' She spoke musingly, ever
on that note of dreary bitterness. Then she sat up and uttered a
short, hard laugh. 'Should I hesitate, can you think, if it lay in
my power? He is as a snake in my path threatening my existence with
his poison. Could any blame me if I put my heel upon his head?'</p>
<p>The fair little widow sucked in her breath. Her long eyes had
narrowed in thought. Instinctively she looked about her in the
pause that followed. They were quite alone, and all was silent on
that terrace save for the hum of the bees that were foraging in the
wallflowers along the foot of the stone balustrade.</p>
<p>'Do you mean it?' she asked softly.</p>
<p>'Mean it?' The delicate golden head was turned, the dark
blue-violet eyes looked solemnly upon Mrs. Turner out of that
tear-stained face. 'Mean what?'</p>
<p>'Why, what you've said. That you want him dead.'</p>
<p>'What if I did?'</p>
<p>The widow pursed her lips. Her voice sank lower. 'These things
can be contrived.'</p>
<p>Lady Essex shuddered. 'O God! No, no! What's in your mind? More
necromancy? But Forman is dead, thank God!'</p>
<p>'There are others still alive. I know of more than one who is
able to do all that ever the doctor could do.'</p>
<p>'No, no!' The musical young voice rang sharp and firm. 'Not to
save my soul, Turner! There has been enough of that. I can thank
God that Forman's dead because the memory of my shameful dealings
is buried with him. I'll never soil myself in that way again.'</p>
<p>'There is no need why you should do anything at all.'</p>
<p>Her ladyship's eyes questioned the widow, and the widow
answered. 'I know of one who, if less skilled in magic than was Dr.
Forman, by much excels him in the use of medicines. He boasts a
water that can slowly kill a man and leave no trace.'</p>
<p>Her ladyship disengaged herself sharply from the other's
sheltering arm. 'What is it you suggest to me, Turner?'</p>
<p>'Dear child, I seek ways to help you. Did you not say you want
him dead?'</p>
<p>'I did not. I did not say it.' Her ladyship's voice shrilled up
a little in her vehemence, as if behind that vehemence of denial
there was something that appalled her.</p>
<p>'You said that there is no peace for you while this man
lives.'</p>
<p>Lady Essex leaned forward again, both elbows on her knees.
'There is a difference between wishing a man dead and setting out
to slay him. And yet ...' She broke off. 'I am a hypocrite, Turner.
Just now you made me shudder; you made me afraid of you; you awoke
my horror. Yet you but pointed down a road that I have already
desired to tread. Yes, even to that has desperation driven me.' She
paused a moment before adding the full explanation. 'There was a
man, a gentleman who vowed he loved me, announced himself my
servant in all things, made big talk of being glad to die for me.
It happened also that he, too, had been wronged by this fellow
Overbury. He is reputed a deadly swordsman. I charged him to pick a
quarrel with this man. He failed me. But that's no matter. I am
nice, you see, in my discriminations. I start in horror when you
propose in one way what already I have sought to accomplish in
another.' She rose abruptly. 'God help me, Turner! They'll drive me
mad, I think, before all's done.' She pressed her hands to her
brow. 'My uncle Northampton is right. It's an indignity to be a
woman.'</p>
<p>The widow sat very still, and waited. There would be great
profit in thus serving Lady Essex. The deadly water would be fully
as costly as Forman's sublimate of pearls. But not on that account
would she press the matter, or display any eagerness. She prospered
in her various trades by knowledge of the human heart. She knew
what a fruitful soil it can become under despair. She had planted
her seed. Now let it germinate.</p>
<p>'I but sought to help you, child,' she repeated presently. 'It
breaks my heart to see you so distraught. There is nothing I would
not do to serve you, dear my lady.'</p>
<p>The tenderness of her voice produced its effect. Her ladyship
turned, swift grace in every line of her. 'I know, sweet Turner. I
know. Forgive me if I was harsh. I am curst as a shrew these days.
Let us leave that now.'</p>
<p>No more was said either in the matter of Sir Thomas Overbury or
her ladyship's troubles. But in the week that followed, the widow's
words were too often in her ladyship's mind for its peace.</p>
<p>At the end of that time, fretted by lack of news of how things
were going in London, she took coach and repaired to Northampton
House. The King was at Newmarket, and Rochester was with him. But
her uncle was able to inform her that not on that account was the
matter of the nullity being neglected.</p>
<p>'I have letters from Rochester that his majesty is solving the
difficulty of the deadlock by appointing two further commissioners
upon whom he can depend, the Bishops of Rochester and Winchester.
But the whole matter is now put off until the end of
September.'</p>
<p>The delay was in itself a blow to her hopes. She knew how
readily dangers are increased by delay. She sat down wearily, and
looked at him in silence. He observed her face to be pale and
peaked, and commented upon it whilst coming to pinch some colour
into her cheeks with his lean old fingers.</p>
<p>'Fie! Fie! What will Robin say to his lady if he finds the roses
all withered in her countenance?'</p>
<p>'Will he marvel, do you suppose, considering the sleepless
nights he must guess me to have spent? I am stretched by suspense
as by a rack, and now you tell me that this must drag on, and that
perhaps I must go again before the commission to answer all their
dreadful questionings.'</p>
<p>'Scarcely that. But what then, provided all come right in the
end? And right it will come unless that scab Overbury works a
miracle.'</p>
<p>She caught her breath at the mention of that detested name.
'Unless, do you say?'</p>
<p>He hunched his shoulders, standing before her with hands folded
behind his back, his long black robe hanging loose about his lean
shanks. 'It is the only thing I fear. Elwes, the new Lieutenant,
has his orders. But it's a world of fools and traitors, and I hear
this devil Overbury is loud and confident in his daily swearing
that while he lives no nullity shall be pronounced.'</p>
<p>He fell to brooding, his chin upon his breast. Then, after a
while, he laughed with a display of yellow fangs, and patted her
cheeks, and bid her down to dine with him.</p>
<p>But his doubts and misgivings had made her heart too sick. She
could not eat. It was a dreadful thing that her fate, her whole
future destiny should hang in the balance thus; an intolerable
thing that at any moment the balance might be brought down against
her by the intervention of one who cared not what havoc he made of
her life so that his own ends were served. Sir Thomas used her, as
it seemed to her, to constrain her lover and her friends. It was as
if he held the point of a sword at her breast and said to them,
yield me my requirements or I slay her.</p>
<p>Was she to stand passive under that menace to herself and to
them when by a single gesture, a single word, she could put an end
to it?</p>
<p>Her smooth brow was furrowed, her sweet and gentle countenance
darkly overcast by her soul's travail to find the answer to that
question.</p>

<h3>THE BISHOP'S MOVE</h3>
<p>Sir Thomas Overbury was ill in body and in mind, and it may well
be that his bodily sickness derived from his mental distemper.
Denied exercise or visitors, or communication of any kind with the
outside world&mdash;saving only my Lord Rochester&mdash;he was
treated, as he violently complained to the new Lieutenant, with as
much rigour as if he had conspired against the State or plotted
against the life of the King.</p>
<p>Sir Gervase Elwes, that grave, dull man, gave a stolidly
courteous attention to his plaints, but denied responsibility in
the matter, or power to ameliorate the conditions. Sir Gervase
merely acted upon his instructions. In one particular only did he
mitigate the severity of the prisoner's condition. The servant for
whom Sir Thomas clamoured as a necessity to him since the removal
of his man Davies, a removal which he dubbed with the rest as a
deliberate inhumanity, was presently supplied him in the person of
a lean, elderly man with a forbidding countenance and a slight cast
in one of his eyes, who answered to the name of Weston. Sir Thomas,
however, yielding to his bitter humour, renamed him Cassius, from,
as he said, his lean and hungry look. A memory this of one of Mr.
Shakespeare's plays which he had seen performed some time ago on
Bankside. The fellow inspired him with hope.</p>
<p>He looked so utterly a scoundrel that Sir Thomas concluded he
would prove corruptible.</p>
<p>Assured by now that Rochester was playing him false, Sir Thomas
had reached that point where he would pass from threats to action.
He recked nothing of what might follow to himself&mdash;accounting
that in any case his ruin was assured&mdash;provided that he could
punish the perfidy of the man whom he had served so stoutly. One
certain way there was to accomplish it. From Lidcote and the others
who had visited him he had learnt the honest attitude taken up by
Archbishop Abbot in the matter of the nullity. If Sir Thomas could
contrive to be brought before the commission to give evidence, he
knew that he would not only wreck the nullity but stir up such a
scandal that the King to save his own face would be constrained to
sacrifice Rochester to the popular indignation. From his knowledge
of King James's ways, he had no doubt whatever that in such a
difficulty his majesty would never hesitate. There were elements of
comedy in the situation that moved him to laughter as he considered
them.</p>
<p>The resolve to communicate with the Archbishop was now formed.
The vehicle he thought had been found in this new servant who had
been sent to wait upon him in his wretched quarters in the Garden
Tower, which for so many in the past had been but the antechamber
of death. He knew the corrupting chemistry of gold upon most men's
loyalties, and, studying his lean and hungry Cassius, he concluded
that here was a rogue who would pawn his soul for a handful of
money.</p>
<p>He went to work with art. He sought to stir the sympathies of
the fellow with the unnecessary rigour of his treatment considering
the littleness of his offence. There were things he needed: linen,
books, and the like. Yet he must forgo them because he was not
allowed to write to those who could supply them. If Weston would
smuggle a letter to Sir John Lidcote, Sir Thomas would add a
<i>postscriptum</i> to that letter instructing Sir John to give the
bearer five pounds.</p>
<p>He saw the covetous gleam in those shifty eyes which never
seemed to meet his own, and his hopes were encouraged.</p>
<p>Weston demurred. If it were discovered, it would go ill with
him. Said Sir Thomas, who cared nothing what might happen to the
rogue, that he would so provide that there should be no risk of
discovery. Weston yielded, and left Sir Thomas to write his letter.
Now it is not by precipitancy of action that such men as Sir Thomas
Overbury win to eminence.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas wrote his letter. But it was just such a letter as he
had pretended to Weston that he desired to write. A letter
informing Lidcote of his health, of his hopes of delivery shortly
by the favour of my Lord Rochester, and requesting his
brother-in-law to send him some shirts and some books, which he
enumerated. He added the instruction that the bearer was to have
five pounds.</p>
<p>Weston did what Sir Thomas feared he might do. He carried the
letter straight to Sir Gervase Elwes. Sir Gervase examined it, and,
although finding it no more than was pretended, acted strictly upon
the instructions he had received from my Lord Northampton, which
were that no letters, excepting only such as might be written to my
Lord Rochester, should be allowed to pass. Sir Gervase sent the
letter to the Lord Privy Seal.</p>
<p>Days passed and neither shirts nor books came for Sir Thomas. He
took Weston plaintively to task, and at the same time called him a
fool for having lost this opportunity of earning five pounds
without any harm done to anyone. Weston had by now reached the same
conclusion independently. He made a frank confession, adding to it
that, if Sir Thomas would write again, he would this time contrive
the delivery of the letter.</p>
<p>But still Sir Thomas practised caution. He wrote again precisely
as before, merely adding a complaint that Sir John Lidcote should
not have heeded his previous request, and an injunction that this
time he should send the articles, not as if in answer to a request
for them, but as the result of his own assumptions that Sir Thomas
would be needing them.</p>
<p>Three days later came a parcel to the Tower, which, after close
inspection by the Lieutenant, was handed to Sir Thomas. It
contained the shirts and other things, and so brought Sir Thomas
the assurance that his letter had been delivered, and that
henceforth he would have no difficulty with Weston.</p>
<p>But before he could take further action he fell violently ill,
as a consequence it seemed to him of something that he had eaten or
drunk, and for days he lay tortured by pain and fever in that
sparsely furnished stone chamber. It gave him a pretext for writing
to Lidcote again. His condition brought about fresh requirements,
and again he tempted Weston to convey a letter for him. Weston
showed reluctance, whereupon Sir Thomas raised the price to ten
pounds, and Weston succumbed on the condition that he should read
the letter before it was sealed.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas allowed him to read it, and thereafter turned to the
table to fold and seal it. For an instant only was his back to
Weston, but in that instant he did all that was required. Into the
letter he slipped another note, already folded and held in
readiness within the palm of his left hand. It was an operation he
had previously rehearsed. Weston was at his side as he tied and
sealed the missive, and had no cause to suspect the juggling.</p>
<p>The man earned his ten pounds, and Sir John Lidcote found
himself in possession of a note for the Archbishop of Canterbury,
which he was to deliver either upon receiving from Sir Thomas a
request for peaches, or at the end of three weeks if in that time
he should not have received any communication at all from the
prisoner.</p>
<p>It was then that Sir Thomas wrote his fiercest, frankest
denunciation to Rochester and his renewed threat that, unless he
were shortly restored to liberty, he would take such steps as
should effectively make an end of all his lordship's hopes of a
nullity.</p>
<p>After that Sir Thomas, still weak and shaken from his last
illness, fell sick again much as he had been sick before, and did
not hesitate to assert to the Lieutenant who came to see him that
he was being poisoned.</p>
<p>'But you may warn my Lord Rochester,' he said between gasps,
'that if I die, his nature shall never die, for I have taken such
steps to publish it as will make him the most odious man alive. If
you have any love for his lordship, or you desire to serve him, you
would do well to warn him to have a care for my health, since
nothing more terrible could happen to him than that I should
die.'</p>
<p>If Sir Gervase conveyed the warning, Rochester made no sign.
Overbury must abide where he was until the nullity should have been
pronounced. But Sir Gervase took measures to have the cell better
ventilated and left instructions that the rushes on the stone
floor, which he found foul and noisome, should daily be
renewed.</p>
<p>Thereafter the prisoner's condition improved; but his weakness
abode in him. His vigour was sapped, and at the end of five months'
imprisonment he was the ghost of the man who had come there on that
April day in the Lieutenant's barge.</p>
<p>And meanwhile the three weeks were sped, and Lidcote, true to
his instructions, and taking steps to conceal only the channel
through which the letter was conveyed, forwarded Overbury's
communication to Archbishop Abbot.</p>
<p>The middle of September had been reached and the nullity
commission was about to sit again, strengthened now from the point
of view of Rochester by the two bishops who would vote as they were
desired.</p>
<p>The Archbishop was in the depths of wretchedness. He perceived
that he was being made the tool of worldliness, yet lacked the
means to establish this so that he could combat it as his
conscience bade him. When the letter from Sir Thomas Overbury
reached his hands he regarded it as an intervention from on high to
enable him to establish that which in his heart he already knew to
be the truth.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas wrote that the nullity suit was based on falsehoods
and concealments which it lay in his power completely to unmask,
since no man apart from those interested in the proceedings was
better informed than he of what actually had occurred. And he
demanded, in the interests of truth and of justice, human and
divine, to be summoned before the commission to give the evidence
that was in him.</p>
<p>The King was at Whitehall again, and without loss of more time
than was required to harness horses, the Archbishop got into his
coach at Croydon and rolled up to the palace to voice Sir Thomas
Overbury's demand.</p>
<p>My Lord of Canterbury reached Whitehall in the forenoon, and as
the King came through the audience gallery he observed the sturdy
figure and solemn, overcast countenance of Abbot standing
prominently on the edge of the crowd of courtiers. His majesty was
attended by Rochester and Haddington, and his face darkened at
sight of the divine who was so obstinately opposing his royal
expositions upon divinity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he advanced towards him, and gave him his hand to
kiss, whilst Rochester stood stiff and haughty in his splendour
looking down upon the portly, short-necked prelate whom he must
regard as his enemy. Haddington, on the King's other side, betrayed
a faint mischievous amusement at this meeting.</p>
<p>The King disengaged his arm from Rochester's and laid a hand
upon the shoulder of the Archbishop. He looked into that grave
countenance with its kindly eyes and broad spade beard, asked his
lordship bluntly how the great cause went forward.</p>
<p>'I am here to speak to your majesty upon it,' Abbot answered.
'If your majesty would graciously hear a word in private ...'</p>
<p>'In private?' mouthed the King. 'Huh!' He paused, hesitating,
then, abruptly consenting, he almost propelled the Archbishop
forward by the pressure of that hand upon his shoulder, and so,
leaning upon him, thrust him across the gallery into the recess of
a window, where they were quite alone. 'What is your private word,
my lord?'</p>
<p>The Archbishop did not falter. He looked the King squarely in
the face as he replied.</p>
<p>'Your majesty already knows that I have no liking for this
suit.'</p>
<p>'What's that to the matter?' wondered the King discouragingly.
'I do not perceive the necessity in a judge for liking any matter
whereupon he is called to pronounce.'</p>
<p>'It matters if he should be rebuked for doing no more than his
duty according to his conscience. It is nought to me that the Lady
Frances remain wife to the Earl of Essex or be married to another
man. But I may not give a sentence where I see no proof.'</p>
<p>His majesty frowned at this. But the prelate held to his
course.</p>
<p>'I have lived fifty-one years almost, and had my conscience
uncorrupted. I know not how soon I may be called before God, and I
am loth against that time to give a wound to my soul. All my grief
is that your majesty's hand is in this. For now there comes one who
promises such evidence that will make plain the injustice of this
suit.'</p>
<p>'How now? And who may this be?' The bulging eyes looked
startled.</p>
<p>For answer the Archbishop unfolded and proffered the note he had
received. The King took it in his plump, jewelled fingers and
glanced at the signature. He uttered a grunt. 'Huh! My old friend
Overbury! Huh!' He strove to keep his mobile countenance
inscrutable, studied to shut out of it the dark anger that welled
up in him as he read.</p>
<p>A foolish fellow in many things, in others this James Stuart was
of an almost diabolical acuteness, and never so acute as where
effects upon himself were concerned. At a glance he perceived all
the mischief Overbury might make, and all the scandal that might
recoil upon his own head, rendering ridiculous in the eyes of the
commissioners those masterly arguments of civil and canon law by
which he sought to coerce them, and himself contemptible in the
eyes of the world for endeavouring to juggle with justice and
corrupt it for the profit and pleasure of those he favoured.</p>
<p>Underneath that fatherly benignity which he affected there was
all the ruthless cruelty of the weak man, just as under that air of
simplicity amounting at times to foolishness there was a depth of
guile and craft which may not even now be plumbed. Never was a man
better epitomized than he in the <i>mot</i> of Sully which
pronounced him the wisest fool in Christendom.</p>
<p>Under the searching almost stern eyes of the Archbishop now he
was all benign fatherliness and simplicity. In the depths of him
passion boiled unsuspected; his craft was being swiftly exercised.
Too long had this insolent fellow Overbury been a thorn in his
flesh and a source of friction between himself and his darling
Rabbie. And not even now that he had flung him into the Tower did
the fellow cease from galling him; indeed, he threatened things
which in their ruthless, reckless sweep were a menace to majesty
itself.</p>
<p>The King tugged at his beard, whilst he read the note a second
time and pondered it. He lifted his plumed hat and scratched the
back of his fulvid head whilst he read it yet a third time, and all
the while he was considering. At last his countenance reflected a
decision taken, a benign decision, the Archbishop was relieved to
see.</p>
<p>'Ay, ay! If the man can say aught that signifies, he must be
heard. But what can he say of his own knowledge? He can but retail
scandals and gossip and such like. Still ...' the King paused and
sighed. 'Far be it from me to give grounds for a reproach that I
lightly stopped the mouth of any man. You must have him before
their lordships and hear the evidence he pretends to have. If it
prove nought but vindictiveness without any solid foundation of
fact, we'll deal with him afterwards. I see the fellow says he's
sick and infirm. But no doubt he'll be well enough to come before
your lordships. I'll take order about it.'</p>
<p>The Archbishop, who had feared a raging refusal to the reopening
of evidence, was moved to thank his majesty almost with tears in
his honest eyes.</p>
<p>The King patted his shoulder, murmuring some empty words in
commendation of his lordship's honesty, of which he assured the
Archbishop that he had never held a doubt, or else he would not
have placed him where he stood. Then with Abbot beside him he
shambled back across the gallery towards a group of watchful
Howards&mdash;Northampton, Suffolk, and some others of the family,
with whom now was Rochester.</p>
<p>At the moment his majesty said nothing of the matter to any of
them. But after dinner, when he was withdrawing for his afternoon
rest, he beckoned Rochester away with him, and in the privacy of
his bedchamber, having driven out the valet Gibb, who waited, he
not only showed his lordship the Archbishop's note, but informed
him of the Archbishop's natural insistence that this witness should
be heard.</p>
<p>'Obstinacy, I've ay observed,' said the King, 'to be a strong
characteristic of churchmen. They care not a rushlight what havoc
may be wrought so that they keep rigidly to the line of conduct
which their doctrine-ridden sense of duty points to them. So that
they may sleep tranquil in the sense of duty done, they care not if
half the world goes sleepless.'</p>
<p>His lordship was not listening. With dismay on his fair,
handsome face he stood there, lost to everything but the cardinal
point in this business.</p>
<p>'You'll never consent, Sire!' he exclaimed at last.</p>
<p>'Consent? D'ye perceive what it means? The clattering of this
man's venomous tongue has already brought my policy in the matter
of the nullity under criticism. Will I now consent that these
criticisms be made to appear justified, and have my judgment held
up to the opprobrium of the vulgar and the ignorant? Will I consent
to that? Well may ye assume that I will not. But his lordship of
Canterbury insists that I do, and if I oppose that plaguy
insistence the consequences to myself may be even worse. D'ye
perceive in what a cleft stick we're held by this sweet friend of
yours whom in an evil hour you brought to be your secretary? 'Ud's
death! He aims at destroying your happiness and my honour at one
and the same blow!'</p>
<p>The royal countenance was flushed. It had lost the last trace of
its usual foolishly benevolent expression, and the bulging eyes
were bodeful.</p>
<p>Yet even in that moment Rochester must pause to defend the
friend whom his conscience told him that he had already used with
excessive harshness, and that it was this harshness and the fear
perhaps of worse to follow that drove Overbury to use in
self-defence the only weapon remaining him. Something of the kind
he said, fetching a sigh as he said it, and thereby increased his
majesty's anger by a revival of his jealousy.</p>
<p>'Can ye defend him even now?' he bawled. 'Can ye defend him when
he's threatening your prospects as well as the findings of my
wisdom? In God's name, Rabbie, what is the love that lies betwixt
ye?'</p>
<p>'It's an old friendship,' said his lordship. 'And I hope I shall
ever be loyal to my friends.'</p>
<p>'Your friends! He's your friend, this scum of mankind?' There
was froth on the royal lips. Then he changed to a tone of bitter
sarcasm. 'I am then to allow him to go before the commission lest
your loyalty to him shall be affronted?'</p>
<p>'No, no. In God's name, no!'</p>
<p>'I'm glad we're of a mind at least in one particular concerning
him. Will ye tell me, then, how it's to be prevented? How I am to
avoid keeping my word to the Archbishop, which was that Overbury
should be heard?'</p>
<p>'Your majesty has already promised that?'</p>
<p>'A pox on your dull wits, Rabbie! How could I not without
betraying bad faith? It was imperative that the promise be given.
It's just as imperative that it should not be kept. Will ye tell me
how I am to accomplish this?'</p>
<p>At a time of less mental trouble and confusion it must have been
perceived by his lordship that the King was pressing him to some
definite course, demanding of him a clear expression of something
already in the royal mind. As it was Rochester heard only the
words, and entirely missed their accent.</p>
<p>With rumpled brow, and his glance on the ground, he answered
thoughtfully. 'It's to be considered.'</p>
<p>The King's glance was dulled by disappointment. 'Very true,'
said he dryly. 'Very true. It's to be considered. And if I am to
preserve my dignity and you are to marry Frances Howard, the answer
must be found.' He rose, and shambled towards the day bed, which
Gibb had prepared for him. 'Go, leave me now,' he said in another
tone, and yawned almost as he spoke.</p>
<p>Rochester bowed himself out, a very troubled man.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE KING'S MOVE</h3>
<p>My Lord Rochester was still troubled on the morrow when in
attendance upon his majesty he went to Windsor, whither the King
chose to retire until the nullity commission sitting in Lambeth
Palace should have done its work.</p>
<p>It occurred to his lordship presently that before leaving town
it would have been prudent to yield to the impulse to visit Sir
Thomas in the Tower. He might have succeeded in dissuading him by
pleading with him, in the name of their old friendship and by
sincere promises of good to follow, to abandon the vindictive
course he was bent upon pursuing. As it was, even if Overbury's
uncorroborated evidence did not suffice to wreck the nullity, it
would raise such a scandal as must make impossible Rochester's
subsequent marriage with Lady Essex.</p>
<p>It is little wonder that his lordship was moody and thoughtful
during the first three days at Windsor. He moved in dread of a
further discussion of the matter with the King. Yet, oddly enough,
his majesty never again alluded to it, nor seemed unduly troubled,
hunting daily in a spirit which almost suggested that he had no
care for anything else in the world.</p>
<p>And then on the third day came news which completely and finally
disposed of the whole matter.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Overbury was dead.</p>
<p>He had succumbed suddenly in the Tower to the disease which it
was now divulged had been consuming him for months.</p>
<p>Thus wrote my Lord Privy Seal to his majesty.</p>
<p>For Lord Rochester there was a brief note from Northampton to
inform him that all had been done for Sir Thomas which the
necessary rigours of his confinement permitted, and that as lately
as Tuesday he had been visited by the King's physician, Sir
Theodore Mayerne. Sir John Lidcote had viewed the body, the coroner
had held his inquest, and burial had immediately followed.</p>
<p>His majesty sent for Rochester, and made no secret of his
elation. The fellow had died most opportunely, a bare twenty-four
hours before he must have appeared before the commission to give
evidence. The nullity was now assured.</p>
<p>Rochester, however, did not share the elation. No consideration
could lift him above the gloom resulting from Sir Thomas Overbury's
death in the circumstances in which it had taken place. He remained
oddly conscience-stricken, obsessed by the memory of the bond that
had been between them, of the high hopes in which they had mutually
entered upon it, of the generous manner in which Sir Thomas had
fulfilled his part until lately, and of the pitiful manner in which
it was now determined.</p>
<p>In some sense he felt as if he were the murderer of Overbury,
for it was by the duplicity he had practised towards him that
Overbury had been placed in circumstances whose rigours had
destroyed him. It did not greatly help him to consider that Sir
Thomas had brought this upon himself by his own intransigence. On a
generous mind the ills that are suffered compare very lightly with
the ills that are wrought, and Robert Carr, whatever his failings
and shortcomings, was generous to the point of weakness.</p>
<p>The King's leer and his half-chuckle, as he announced to Robin
that Nature had intervened most opportunely, filled his lordship
with horror and remorse.</p>
<p>Opportunely was the word that re&euml;choed through his mind. On
the eve of being brought before the commission, Sir Thomas's death
was opportune, indeed. Singularly opportune. Suspiciously
opportune. Rochester, closeted with his majesty, was appalled by
the sudden twist of his thoughts. They raced down a fresh avenue
gathering confirmation at every step.</p>
<p>The King, looking up at him from the chair in which he lolled
with a bedgown loosely pulled about him, for the despatch from
London had reached him while he was still abed, was startled by his
aspect.</p>
<p>'Why, what ails you, Rabbie? Are ye sick, man?'</p>
<p>And Rochester looking down upon him with stern, accusing eyes,
answered slowly:</p>
<p>'Ay! Sick!'</p>
<p>'Man! What's sickened ye?' The royal uneasiness was manifest in
his goggling eyes.</p>
<p>'The opportuneness as your majesty has said of Tom Overbury's
death. Was it truly Nature that intervened so seasonably?'</p>
<p>'Nature surely, since disease is but a weapon of Nature's, and
the fellow has been far gone these weeks they tell me.'</p>
<p>'Yet your majesty hoped he might recover?'</p>
<p>'Nay, now, nay!' James almost smiled at this. 'Ye cannot impute
quite so deep a charity to me as that, and I'll not be a hypocrite
to assume it.'</p>
<p>'The facts impute it. That or something else. So solicitous was
your majesty on the matter of Tom's health that you sent your own
physician to wait upon him.'</p>
<p>James's loose mouth fell open in astonishment and dismay.</p>
<p>'I have it in a letter from my Lord Privy Seal,' Rochester
informed him. 'Sir Theodore Mayerne visited Tom on Tuesday. And on
Wednesday he died. On Thursday he would have given evidence before
the commission. These facts make up a singular procession.'</p>
<p>''Ud's death, man! What d'ye imply?' The King displayed an anger
that was not entirely histrionic.</p>
<p>His lordship, livid of countenance, shrugged disrespectfully and
sneered into the face of majesty. 'Why did you send Mayerne to
visit him? Was it that Mayerne might cure a man whose death would
be, in your majesty's own word, so very opportune? A man for whose
recovery it were, again in your majesty's own words, too deep a
charity to impute to you that you should hope.'</p>
<p>'Stop!' The King heaved himself up out of his chair. He was
trembling, and well may it have been with anger at the contemptuous
tone in which he was addressed by this favourite to whom he had
given many liberties. 'You forget to whom you are speaking.' He
pulled the loose gown about him, and strove to bring an appearance
of majesty into his untidy person. 'Sometimes, my lord, you appear
to forget that I am the King.'</p>
<p>'Sometimes,' he was boldly answered, 'your majesty forgets
it.'</p>
<p>They stood eyeing each other like men who are about to draw and
engage. The King's usually florid countenance was ashen. He shook
with wrath.</p>
<p>'I'll not forget this, Robin,' he mumbled indistinctly. 'I'll be
even with you for this.'</p>
<p>'My God!' It was a cry of horror from Rochester. He covered his
face with his hands. 'Those were the very words I spoke to
Overbury, as he has since written to remind me. And dying he'd
think it was my hand that struck him down.'</p>
<p>The pain in his voice moved the King oddly. His queer affection
for this bonny lad whelmed forth in pity to drown his wrath. He
made a noise as if clearing his throat, and shambled forward to
Rochester's side. With one hand he held his bedgown about him, with
the other he patted Rochester's shoulder.</p>
<p>'He'll know better now, lad,' were the extraordinary words with
which he sought to soothe him. 'He'll know better now. He'll know
ye're not to blame; that ye had no hand in it; and he'll know that
he brought it entirely upon himself. Why, what's to greet over,
when all's said?'</p>
<p>Rochester lowered his hands from a face that was ghastly.</p>
<p>'Come, Rabbie, come! Here's weakness. If the rogue had lived he
would have wrecked your every hope of happiness, and not only yours
but hers, which, if ye're a lover worth the name, should be of more
account to you than your own. Hasn't the poor lass suffered enough
for love of you that she should have been left to suffer more by
this fellow's malice? And what of me, Rabbie? Do I count for
naught? Is your love for Overbury far above your every other
feeling that in your sorrow for his death ye can take no thought
for the sorrows his life would have brought those who love ye? Away
with you to London, lad, to see her ladyship, and bid her be of
good cheer; tell her from me that the nullity is as good as
pronounced and that the wedding-bells will soon be ringing now.
Away with ye, until ye can think more kindly of your old dad and
gossip James and realise that ye've no better friend in all the
world.'</p>
<p>Rochester bowed and stumbled out with no word answered, leaving
his majesty very thoughtful.</p>
<p>But not until two days later did he return to town, keeping
meanwhile to his own lodgings in the castle. In that time, having
recovered from the shock of the news, he came to take a less
uncompromising view. There was after all much in what the King had
said. Overbury had become a menace not only to himself, but to King
James and to Frances. On their behalf, if not on his own, let him
now put all resentment from him. What King James had done he had a
perfect right to do in self-defence and in the exercise of
kingcraft against one who openly avowed his aims to bring the King
into contempt. And since further he must suppose that King James
had also been actuated in part at least by solicitude for himself,
he could not in justice bear him rancour.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was with a sad heart that he rode to town with
his little troop of lackeys, and sought the Lord Privy Seal at
Northampton House.</p>
<p>In the library there he found his lordship steeped in all those
affairs which but a few months ago had been in the charge of
Overbury acting on behalf of Rochester himself. He could not
repress a pang to observe in how short a time his lordship had
gathered into his own hands all those threads of policy and power,
and how completely by almost imperceptible degrees he himself had
been elbowed aside, until to-day he knew of affairs no more than
others chose to report to him.</p>
<p>His lordship came to meet him with a fond welcome. Like the King
he pronounced most opportune the decease of Overbury. Like the King
he perceived in the event only grounds for thankfulness on my Lord
Rochester's behalf. The thing, he confessed, was making some stir.
His agents reported that Paul's and the ordinaries were full of
rumours. The idle and the malicious must ever be talking to the
detraction of their betters. There was a tale abroad that Overbury
had been poisoned, and it was being said that the hand that had
administered the dose was the same that had struck down Prince
Henry.</p>
<p>'But let them talk,' the old Earl added with a contemptuous
shrug. 'They will the sooner weary. What matters is that the
fellow's death has put a term to all our troubles and
misgivings.'</p>
<p>'Yet I would that end might have been achieved without his
death,' said Rochester heavily.</p>
<p>The keen, crafty old eyes surveyed him. The Earl sighed. 'So
would we all, to be sure. And there's none to blame. All that could
be done for him was done. The King's own physician ministered to
him, as I told you, yet could do nothing to save him.'</p>
<p>Rochester looked sharply at the Earl, wondering did he know, or
did he suspect. But the old rogue's inscrutable countenance told
him nothing.</p>
<p>He muttered empty platitudes, and went in quest of Frances when
Northampton told him that she was in the house.</p>
<p>With his arms presently about her, he found at last the balm his
wounded soul was needing. She was pale and fretful, with dark
shadows under her lovely eyes heightening to feverishness their
lustre. He realised without being told that these were the signs of
all the anxieties she had been made to suffer by the activities of
Overbury, which threatened to thrust her back into the hell from
which at last she was to win respite. Realising this, and realising
as he held her how intolerable to him must have been the
irreparable loss of her, he came at last to think with the King and
with Northampton that Overbury's death in all the circumstances had
been most opportune.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER
XXVII</h2>
<h3>MARRIAGE</h3>
<p>After a jury of matrons had been empanelled, and its evidence
heard, the packed commission delivered its sentence of nullity,
transforming the Countess of Essex back again into the Lady Frances
Howard, within a week of Sir Thomas Overbury's death.</p>
<p>The seven commissioners who voted in favour of it earned thereby
the lasting approval of the King; the five who opposed it deserved
his unuttered rancour. Nor did it soften this to discover that
among the great majority of his subjects noble and simple the
opposite view was taken of the respective merits and demerits of
his commissioners.</p>
<p>Six weeks later his majesty gave fresh proof of his love for
Rochester, by creating him Earl of Somerset and bestowing upon him
the Barony of Brancepeth with its broad acres to add to his already
vast possessions, who seven years ago had been a simple esquire
owning little more than the suit of clothes in which he stood.</p>
<p>And now all the talk of court and town was of the forthcoming
marriage. To provide for it on a sumptuous scale at a time when the
Treasury was empty, the prodigal King was driven to a sale of crown
lands, and every penny proceeding from this source was recklessly
squandered in gifts and in junketings that lasted for a week from
the 26th December, the day on which the marriage was
celebrated.</p>
<p>The Lady Frances, all in virginal white and with hair unbound,
was led to the altar by the Duke of Saxony, then on a visit to the
English Court, and her great-uncle Northampton, who counted
confidently upon achieving through her the gratification of his
every ambition.</p>
<p>Always of a supple slightness, her ladyship was now seen to have
grown slighter still in the last few months, and on her countenance
there was an etherealizing pallor and in her eyes a look almost of
fear. This was compassionately assigned to all that she had borne
in the course of her unhappy marriage to Lord Essex.</p>
<p>After the banquet at Whitehall, the masque especially written by
Campion for the occasion, and the dancing that had followed this,
Robin carried her off to the village of Kensington and the house
which he had rented there from Sir Baptist Hicks.</p>
<p>Weary to exhaustion by the strain of the day and the revelry of
the night, she reclined in an armchair, whilst her bridegroom knelt
to her in all his own bridal finery of shimmering white satin laced
with silver. Thus reverently kneeling, he took her slim, shapely
hand in his, and swore so to use her as to make amends for all that
she had suffered and all that for love of him she had so bravely
fronted.</p>
<p>That oath of his appeared to galvanise her into fresh
energy.</p>
<p>'It was! It was!' she declared with a vehemence odd in one who a
moment earlier had seemed so lethargic. 'All, all was for love of
you, Robin. To make me yours without let or hindrance. Always
remember it, Robin mine. Always remember it.'</p>
<p>'Should I forget it ever, child? Could I?'</p>
<p>Her fingers made play absently with his golden curls, which were
on a level with her breast. 'Let it forgive all! Let it condone
all.'</p>
<p>'Forgive? Condone?' He laughed at her earnestness and slipped an
arm about her waist. 'Child, you're overstrained.'</p>
<p>'I am.' The caress of his voice drew tears from her. 'Oh, Robin,
Robin!' She looked down upon him, smiling wistfully. 'We have
bought and paid in advance&mdash;ay, and paid heavily&mdash;for
happiness. See to it that nothing cheats us now.'</p>
<p>'Why, what should cheat us, sweetheart?'</p>
<p>'I ... I don't know. I am full of fears.'</p>
<p>He rose and drew her up with him, and held her close against his
breast, tenderly stroking her wet cheek. 'Rest you, dear wife, and
put all fear behind you. We've done with fear and with evil of
every kind. Rest you, sweetheart.' He kissed her fondly, gently.
'I'll call your women.'</p>
<p>But there was no enduring rest just yet, for body or for mind.
The wedding festivities were no more than begun. They were to
continue for a week and on a scale such as no wedding at Whitehall
had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>Gifts of unparalleled munificence even in that prodigal reign
were showered upon the happy pair. The King alone bestowed jewels
on the bride to the value of ten thousand pounds. Masques were
performed nightly for a week, Ben Jonson writing one of them,
Campion another, and Sir Francis Bacon yet another, which he
mounted entirely at his own charges and with that reckless
extravagance which was already distinguishing him and giving
grounds for conjecture. The Lord Mayor entertained the new Earl and
his Countess at a great banquet in the Merchant Taylors' Hall, and
in the very tilt-yard in which Mr. Robert Carr had first tumbled
into the lap of fortune, a tourney was held in which no colours
were seen but his own and his lady's. Moreover, the occasion
appeared to be one which had reconciled all parties. Even the Queen
had been induced to put aside her hostility to Carr, and she
appeared so far to forget the opposition she had encouraged to the
nullity as to lend her countenance to these festivities to the
signal extent of presenting the marriage-bed to the bride. And the
noble Pembroke, the chief and most avowed of all Carr's enemies in
the past, actually rode in the tilting-match wearing the Earl of
Somerset's colours of green and gold.</p>
<p>This, however, was to prove no real alliance, but merely a truce
in hostilities which the events were abundantly to nourish.</p>
<p>The marriage, so ardently desired and reached by such arduous
labour and over obstacles apparently insurmountable, had the effect
of placing Somerset entirely in the power of Northampton and the
Howards. With at least a dozen members of the family in prominent
offices at court, they made up a formidable party, immeasurably
strengthened now by the inclusion of the royal favourite.</p>
<p>Very soon this had the effect of creating an opposing faction.
The Herberts, the Seymours, the Russells, and others bitterly
resented this monopoly of court favour by a single family, and a
family, moreover, of secret recusants.</p>
<p>Somerset perceived all this, and was far from easy or happy in
his position. He cast about him for means to secure himself, and in
that hour missed Overbury as he had never missed him yet. He needed
Overbury's sound judgment and shrewd counsel to guide him. He
perceived already that he was on the wrong side. He saw the forces
of the anti-Howard faction daily swelling, until it included almost
every man of any worth and weight, and he had a presentiment that
sooner or later a storm would break in which the Howards would be
swept away and he with them. He remembered now all Overbury's
warnings against alliance with the Howards and with that old
scoundrel Northampton in particular.</p>
<p>In his unguided casting about him for security, he took perhaps
the most disastrous step of his career. The appointment of
Secretary of State was still to make, and as the desperate
emptiness of the Treasury made the assembling of Parliament at last
a necessity, that appointment could no longer be delayed. Sir
Thomas Lake and Sir Ralph Winwood continued nominally to discharge
the duties of the office, whilst hoping for ultimate appointment.
In addition one of the Nevilles was another candidate.</p>
<p>His lordship considered, and made choice of Sir Ralph Winwood. A
big, bulky, swarthy man, this, with a plain, fleshy face,
black-bearded, and with calm, shallow-set eyes. He was
unprepossessing and sombre of demeanour and puritanically sombre of
dress. But he had diligently sued Lord Somerset's favour, and he
had come to the wedding laden with munificent gifts in token of his
service. He was, too, a man of parts, shrewd and able, and Somerset
fancied from his staid unpretentious carriage that in him he might
find another Overbury, diligently to discharge the duties of the
office whilst leaving its honours to his patron.</p>
<p>The King, yielding as usual to his favourite's wishes, bestowed
the exalted office as required upon the least likely of the three
candidates. Neville was put off with some minor perquisites and
retired in sulky resignation. Not so Sir Thomas Lake. His claim had
been far the weightiest, based upon years of faithful service and
ripe experience in affairs acquired under Elizabeth. He took his
exclusion as a personal affront from Somerset, accounted himself
injured and insulted at one and the same time, and he went over to
the camp of the favourite's enemies, to become the bitterest and
most vindictive of them all, a man vigilantly waiting for an
opportunity to pay off the score.</p>
<p>A full year went round before that opportunity came, and in that
year a great deal happened.</p>
<p>The Earl of Northampton died in June, performing that last act
of his life with a pomp and circumstance which sorted well with his
ambitions. It was an irony that he should have held for no more
than a few brief months some portion of the power for which he had
waited, schemed and striven down the years.</p>
<p>The Privy Seal went to Somerset. Upon Suffolk, at last, was
bestowed the Treasurership which Northampton had coveted, and
Suffolk's vacated office of Lord Chamberlain was also filled by
Somerset, to the exasperation of the stately Pembroke, who had
stout claims to the office and was supported by the Queen in suing
for it. It seemed as if the King's infatuation and Somerset's greed
knew no bounds.</p>
<p>All these fresh hostilities sprouting about him, quarrels with
Lennox and Hay over the question of a Spanish alliance, and the
tangle which appeared in foreign affairs under Somerset's unguided
control began to exacerbate him.</p>
<p>In the Low Countries, Spain and Austria had joined forces
against the Protestant States. The Elector Palatine was in danger,
and was calling upon his father-in-law King James to fulfil the
treaty obligations by assisting the allies, and the good faith of
Somerset came under suspicion in consequence of the pro-Spanish
leanings into which the Howards had man&oelig;uvred him.</p>
<p>Bewildered by events which he lacked the skill and judgment to
control, he longed for Overbury more passionately than ever.
Overbury's wits would have made all clear and would have pointed
the safe road, and Overbury's miserable end, thus brought
remorsefully to his mind, helped to increase his moodiness and
irritability.</p>
<p>It was said of him in those days that he was hag-ridden. His
erstwhile radiance had definitely left him. His easy affability was
dissipated, his gaiety and good-humour lost. He became gloomy,
arrogant, and inaccessible, a man whose nerves were frayed and
ragged.</p>
<p>In disagreements with the King, which were now of common
occurrence, finding himself without the ready arguments which
Overbury had formerly supplied, he adopted a bullying tone, and a
manner so outrageously overbearing and disrespectful that at last,
his majesty uttered an indignant warning, which the headstrong
Somerset would have done well to heed.</p>
<p>'You'd be wise to remember, Rabbie, that all your being, except
your breathing and soul, is from me.'</p>
<p>'For which I have given such loyalty as you never had from any,
not even though he were of your own blood,' was the haughty
answer.</p>
<p>The King's watery eyes considered him from under sullen,
frowning brows.</p>
<p>'Am I to repent having raised a man so high that he shall pierce
my ears with such speeches?'</p>
<p>His lordship shrugged contemptuously, and turned sulkily aside,
which brought the King to his feet in a passion.</p>
<p>'And now ye're insolent! By God's death, man, never let me
apprehend that you disdain my person or undervalue my qualities,
unless you would have my love for you turn to hate. Get you gone!
Go study a proper carriage and a humble behaviour before you seek
me again, so that you may wash out of my heart your by-past errors.
Go!'</p>
<p>Somerset bowed sulkily and went out, and the King, bruised at
heart, sat down to weep, like a woman whose lover grows cold.</p>
<p>The only living person towards whom Somerset still maintained
the erstwhile gentleness, affability, and graciousness which once
had enabled him to override the prejudice begotten by his sudden
elevation was his Countess.</p>
<p>They had moved from Kensington to Chesterford Park, near
Theobald's; and thence, in consequence of her ladyship's delicate
health, to Isleworth, where they were now established. Her
condition gave him some concern, and may have increased the
tenderness of the fond, devoted lover he remained. But if he was
never harsh, at least he could not even in her presence put aside
the increasing melancholy growing out of the difficulties he was
daily encountering; the hostility by which he was surrounded, and
his sense of uncertainty in the handling of affairs.</p>
<p>He gave her, as men will when troubled, more of his confidence;
told her more of the past than he had ever told her yet, and dwelt
particularly on the stout services Overbury had rendered him,
unburdening himself, to her infinite and obvious distress, of the
remorse that gnawed at his conscience.</p>
<p>Phrases from Overbury's last dreadful letter were seared as with
an acid upon his brain:</p>
<p>'Your story shall be put down to betray and so quit a friend ...
All this ill-nature shewed by the man whose conscience tells him
that trusting to him brought me hither ... My share to be a prison
upon such terms that no man suffered yet ... And he that is the
author of all and that hath more cause to love me, yea, perish for
me rather than see me perish.'</p>
<p>Thus from memory he quoted gloomily one day, until her ladyship,
deathly white and breathing hard, ran to him where he sat, entwined
her arms about his neck, and drew his golden head down upon her
breast as if to shelter it there and protect it from this foul
legion of memories that harassed and unmanned him.</p>
<p>'Dear love, you see but the fruits and not the seed in this. How
could he call you the author of his ills that was the wanton author
of his own?'</p>
<p>'Yet by my betrayal of him was he cast into an imprisonment
whose rigours resulted in his death.'</p>
<p>'It would not have been so rigorous had he not made it so.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps not. And yet sometimes I feel myself his murderer. And
I loved the man.'</p>
<p>She uttered a little moan, and held him closer. 'That you were
not. You never meant his death. Yet if you had, who that knew all
could blame you? It would have been something done in self-defence,
to save the ruin of all your life&mdash;of all your life and mine.
And mine. Have you forgotten that? Have you forgotten the
unforgivable things he said of me on the night you quarrelled? Many
a man would have slain him on the spot without pity.'</p>
<p>'Better that,' he answered. 'It would have been cleaner and more
honest. But there was that between us ... so deep a debt of love
and service ... A bond into which I entered in my need of him
...'</p>
<p>'Yet had he lived, he would have ruined our hopes. He would have
doomed me to a living death as Essex's wife, and you ... Oh, my
dear, my dear! You start at shadows. You remember but the half of
what is done.'</p>
<p>'Because I miss him and need him now more than ever I did.
Because I feel myself rudderless without him. There, I've confessed
it. I perceive now how I should have acted. I should have heeded
his appeals on the score of sickness; I should have explained
patiently to him how much the nullity meant to me, how all my
happiness was bound up in it. I could have melted him, I surely
could. He loved me. And I ... I left him to die like a rat in the
trap I had sprung for him.'</p>
<p>'Robin!' It was a cry of pain. 'Of your pity do not torture me
with more of this.'</p>
<p>'Ah! Forgive me, sweet.' He stroked the pale, lovely face that
looked so strained and anguished.</p>
<p>'Time,' she assured him, 'will soften all.'</p>
<p>'Time?' He stared before him with haunted eyes. 'Time can but
make me more conscious of my loss. Daily his absence weighs upon me
more heavily.'</p>
<p>'Leave all this,' she whispered to him with a sudden urgency of
entreaty. 'Leave the cares of office, the duties, the labours, the
court. There is no happiness in ambition. Let us go and live
quietly at Rochester or Brancepeth or where you will. We have each
other. Is not that enough, my Robin? Once away from all this you
will find ease.'</p>
<p>Well for him, perhaps, had he listened. But to the man who has
wielded it, power is as a drug without which there is no savour in
life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER
XXVIII</h2>
<h3>MR. VILLIERS</h3>
<p>The opportunity for which the vindictive Sir Thomas Lake waited
with vigilant patience presented itself at Cambridge in the
following March.</p>
<p>The King, accompanied by Prince Charles, was paying the town a
royal visit at once to honour the University and its Chancellor,
the Earl of Suffolk. A great concourse of gallants attended the
King, but it was to be observed that there were only seven ladies
in the party, and all of these either by blood or alliance members
of the Howard family. This had resulted from Suffolk's deliberate
omission to invite the Queen, an omission deeply resented and
calculated further to widen the gap between the Howards and the
opposing faction.</p>
<p>Among the various functions offered for his majesty's
entertainment was a performance of 'Ignoramus,' a burlesque written
in Latin by a fellow of Clare's and played by fellows of Clare Hall
and Queen's College. Clare Hall, where the performance was held,
had been tricked out and festively hung for the occasion, and a
little tribune had been erected for his majesty, where he sat
enthroned with the Earl and Countess of Somerset and the Earl and
Countess of Suffolk in immediate attendance upon him, to be stared
at by the academic groundlings.</p>
<p>The King showed great relish of the tedious, pedantic show, and
its ponderous humour provoked the royal mirth to frequent
outbursts. Clare Hall that evening was, however, to supply his
majesty with another object of interest besides this play.</p>
<p>During the first of the interludes, whilst raking the ranks of
the audience with his rolling, watery eyes, the royal glance came
to rest upon a slim, straight youth of perhaps a little over
twenty, very gracefully made, arrestingly beautiful of countenance.
He wore a suit of black that once may have been modish, but was now
rusty and frayed, and what took the attention was that not even so
shabby a setting could diminish the innate grace of his movements
or detract from the innate nobility of his face in its frame of
glossy chestnut hair.</p>
<p>The King favoured the young man with that almost intolerable,
persistent ogling which he bestowed upon all those who attracted
his attention. He even went so far as quite openly to point him out
to the Countess of Suffolk. The young man, grown conscious of this,
blushed and shifted a little uncomfortably on his feet where he
stood within short range of that volley of glances.</p>
<p>Amongst the observers was Sir Thomas Lake, whose dark eyes
suddenly lighted with interest and whose keen face became suddenly
keener.</p>
<p>During the next act, Sir Thomas edged his way gradually across
the hall, and at the ensuing interval the young man found a tall,
stately, and richly dressed courtier at his elbow, who smiled upon
him ingratiatingly, sought his acquaintance, and presently
displayed his interest in him by the questions he asked concerning
his family and himself. Whilst talking to him, Sir Thomas watched
the royal tribune out of the corner of his eye, and assured himself
that the royal attention had nowise diminished and that the royal
ogling continued in increased measure to see one of his gentlemen
deeply engaged with his lovely lad.</p>
<p>The young man answered Sir Thomas's questions with ingenuous
candour. His name was George Villiers, and he hailed from
Leicestershire, where his family had been established for four
centuries. His father had been dead some ten years, and had left
his family none too prosperous. The young man had been to France to
finish his education. He was newly returned, and having been home
to embrace his mother was now on his way to London to seek his
fortune. The presence of the King and Court and his natural
curiosity to behold them had delayed him in Cambridge.</p>
<p>'And so afforded me the happy chance of becoming acquainted with
so excellent and accomplished a young gentleman,' said the fine
courtier further to embarrass him. 'My name is Lake. Sir Thomas
Lake. Inquire for me at Whitehall when you come to town. It may be
my privilege to serve you.'</p>
<p>Now whatever the ambitions of Mr. Villiers, he was very far from
imagining the destiny in store for him, nor to guess, as he stared
in wonder at this magnificent and influential gentleman, that the
day was not far distant when he was to be as far above him as he
now accounted himself below. He summoned his wits to express
becoming thanks, and he did so with a grace of phrase and bearing
which Sir Thomas, closely noting, accounted of excellent augury for
the project which as yet was but an embryo in his fertile mind. It
was an embryo destined to a more rapid growth than even Sir Thomas
could have hoped. Nor was it to be necessary for Mr. Villiers to
ask for him at Whitehall. Fate was to contrive that Mr. Villiers
should travel thither with him.</p>
<p>It was in the third interlude that this began to become
apparent.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas suddenly found himself beckoned by the King, and
assailed by questions concerning that admirable young man.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas ventured to embroider his information. The lad was
not only of good family which had fallen upon diminished fortunes,
but was the son of a man who had deserved well for his stout
loyalty, and yet, as sometimes happened, had been entirely
overlooked. Sir Thomas might have been hard put to it to have
produced evidence of this; but he shrewdly guessed that, if the
royal interest were aroused as deeply as he hoped, the King would
be glad enough to accept the statement without any
confirmation.</p>
<p>The King desired that the lad be presented, and so at the end of
the performance, you behold the valedictory proceedings suspended
while his majesty utters a few benign and fatherly words to
handsome, young, out-at-elbows Mr. Villiers, who stands modestly
blushing before him. Further, he expresses a desire to see Mr.
Villiers at Whitehall, there to signify his appreciation of his
father's loyalty and make amends to the son for having neglected
suitably to reward that loyalty in the father's own lifetime.</p>
<p>It was a bewildered and rather confused Mr. Villiers who stood
gracefully to hear these surprising words spoken with a smile of
such extreme friendliness as to become almost a leer; to receive a
friendly, fatherly tap upon his smooth cheek from two soft fingers;
and to be aware of innumerable eyes focussed upon him, and in
particular a pair of fine blue eyes cold as agates by which a
handsome, gorgeous, golden-headed gentleman at the King's side
regarded him.</p>
<p>He found words in which to thank his majesty for this gracious
condescension, and, still bewildered, suffered himself to be
carried off by Sir Thomas Lake, who did not mean to lose sight of
him again just yet. For Sir Thomas was now persuaded that in this
out-at-elbow young Adonis he had found the necessary lever with
which to dislodge the Earl of Somerset from his high place.</p>
<p>Still more bewildered was Mr. Villiers, who deemed the incident
closed for the present, to find Sir Thomas waiting upon him at his
mean inn betimes on the following morning whilst he was still abed.
The fastidious, accomplished man of courts seated himself upon the
only chair&mdash;and this a broken one&mdash;which the room
boasted, and proceeded to inform Mr. Villiers that the King was
greatly pleased with him and that he was commanded to attend the
performance of a Latin pastoral in Clare Hall that evening. Sir
Thomas inquired if Mr. Villiers had much Latin, and Mr. Villiers
told him frankly and bluntly that he had none. The courtier seemed
momentarily disappointed.</p>
<p>'No matter,' said he, upon reflection. 'It was the same in
another case. His majesty will no doubt find interest in your
instruction.'</p>
<p>To Mr. Villiers this was a sentence without sense. Nor did Sir
Thomas waste breath in explaining it. He urged the young man to be
stirring, and when presently Mr. Villiers had arrayed himself in
his suit of black, which looked rustier and shabbier than ever by
daylight, he was carried off by his self-constituted Mentor, to
spend the time until dinner in ransacking the shops of Cambridge
tailors and haberdashers.</p>
<p>There came a moment when Mr. Villiers, who saw money being laid
out on his behalf with a reckless indifference to its value such as
he had never witnessed in his needy young life, demanded an
explanation of conduct he was so very far from understanding. A
little, too, he resented being swept without a by-your-leave along
some course which this masterful courtier appeared to have
predetermined.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas smiled tolerantly and adopted frankness, as men must
when deception will not serve.</p>
<p>'Have I not said that the King is very pleased with you and
desires your better acquaintance? That, sir, is your good fortune.
Mine lies in being at hand to see that his majesty is gratified in
his wishes. When you have been a little longer at court, you will
understand that this is the surest road to advancement.'</p>
<p>The gentleman spoke as if Mr. Villiers were already established
at court. It took his breath away. He could only stare. Answering
his look, Sir Thomas employed a still greater frankness.</p>
<p>'Count this not merely for generosity in me. Experience has
shown me how high a man may climb who has taken the King's eye. If
I expedite your rise, I put my trust in your gratitude. When you
are up, you shall repay the debt by reaching down a hand to
me.'</p>
<p>It was not quite the truth, but it sufficed to quiet the
remonstrances of Mr. Villiers's self-respect, and made him regard
this matter of equipment as a transaction between gentlemen to be
adjusted later. In this conviction he now submitted with a better
grace.</p>
<p>That evening, as my Lord of Somerset sat in Clare Hall
immediately behind the King, yawning under cover of his hand over
the pompous dullness of the Latin pastoral which was delighting his
majesty, he suddenly became aware of a lithe, graceful figure very
elegantly attired in a suit of mulberry velvet, that was all puffed
and slashed, a satin cape-cloak, thrust up behind by a gold-hilted
rapier, rosetted, high-heeled shoes, and glossy chestnut hair
falling heavily about an oval face of exceptional beauty. At the
elbow of this arrestingly elegant figure stood Sir Thomas Lake, to
supply a clue by which his lordship recognised the youth for the
shabby young man from Leicestershire whom the King had held last
night in talk.</p>
<p>He asked himself why Sir Thomas had been at such pains to turn
the crow into a jay, and guessing the answer sneered at what he
accounted so much waste of labour. Nor was he at all discomposed
when presently in the interlude, the King's roving eye discovered
the young man, and beckoned him to the tribune so that he might
hold him again in talk.</p>
<p>His majesty spoke of the play, repeated a line which he had
accounted witty and of whose Latinity he approved, and desired Mr.
Villiers's opinion upon it. Mr. Villiers, who was not such a fool
as to affect knowledge which he did not possess, frankly deplored
that his ignorance of Latin allowed him to do no more than admire
the motions of the players, having previously informed himself of
the argument of the play.</p>
<p>The King's expression was saddened by the information. Behind
him Somerset softly laughed his scorn, for which presently, when
Mr. Villiers had retired again, he suffered the unusual experience
of a rebuke from his master.</p>
<p>'Ye're ungenerous, Rabbie, to sneer at an ignorance that was
your own until I mended it.'</p>
<p>Somerset flushed, and his mouth momentarily tightened. But his
answer, an instant later, was suave and level.</p>
<p>'Your majesty mistakes me. I laughed at the notion of a man
wasting hours upon a play in a language he does not
understand.'</p>
<p>'Yet a man may waste hours in one way and gain much in another.
It was not to hear the play that Sir Thomas brought him.'</p>
<p>'Or busied his tailors with the fellow.'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay! But did ye mark how well he wears his clothes? Sir
Thomas thought to please me.'</p>
<p>'Sir Thomas paid you a poor compliment, Sire, if he accounted
you pleased so easily.'</p>
<p>His majesty winced at the sneer, and said no more. He was
learning to hold his tongue when his darling Rabbie adopted that
tone; but not on that account did he forgo resentment of it, and
this resentment from being stifled grew of an increasing
bitterness.</p>
<p>It may or it may not have been due to this that, at the end of
the performance, the King kept the company waiting whilst once more
he engaged in talk with Mr. Villiers. At the end of it he commanded
the young man's company at a banquet to be given at Trinity on the
following evening with a dance to follow.</p>
<p>It was in this dance that Mr. Villiers at last earned a general
meed of admiration, for the grace with which he carried himself and
his proficiency in an art which he had learnt in France. He was the
recipient of so many compliments afterwards that he was almost as
elated as was Sir Thomas Lake. Somerset, whose splendour of dress,
ease of deportment, beauty of person, and haughty assurance of
manner filled Mr. Villiers with awe, looked on languidly with that
curl of the lip which was becoming almost habitual with him. As he
watched the King's ogling of the lad and his foolish slobbering as
he talked to him, contempt for a man whose delight was so easily
aroused and whose displays of it were so wanting in dignity began
to stir in him.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Lake went swiftly to work to build upon those
foundations which he had laid so cunningly at Cambridge. Having
brought his prot&eacute;g&eacute; safely to Whitehall, he had
sought the Earl of Pembroke, whose rancour at the loss of the
office of Lord Chamberlain was altogether beyond allaying; he had
sought Abbot, the Archbishop, whose righteous indignation at the
nullity he had been forced to pronounce for Somerset's ends was
never likely to diminish; and he had sought the Queen, whose
momentary favouring of a man she had always detested was
extinguished now by the insult of her exclusion from the Cambridge
junketings, for which, although perhaps unreasonably, she chose to
blame Somerset as well as his father-in-law, Suffolk.</p>
<p>To each of them he pointed out the man he had discovered who
should drive out Somerset as one nail drives out another, and each
of them was ready enough to enter into league with him, although
the Queen was a little of opinion that the ultimate gain would be
dubious. These minions were supple enough at the outset; but once
firmly established in favour and in power, they had a way of
becoming scorpion whips for the shoulders by which they had
climbed. Mr. Villiers might to-day be modest and humble and
disposed to gratitude. So had Robert Carr once been. And as Robert
Carr now was, so might George Villiers become. Still, this was
something of which they might take the risk.</p>
<p>Thus came the conspiracy to be formed, and the necessary moneys
supplied for the further equipment and maintenance of the new
minion and for the purchase for him of the office of cupbearer to
his majesty, whereby he would be officially established in the
Palace.</p>
<p>Somerset went his ways unruffled. Beyond an occasional sneer at
the royal manifestations of infatuation, his lordship ignored the
young gentleman from Leicestershire. This until a flagrant event
warned him of the peril ahead, and revealed to him the organisation
that was at work against him.</p>
<p>The Earl of Pembroke entertained some gentlemen to dinner at
Baynard's Castle. Sir Thomas Lake was of the company, and the chief
spokesman when they had dined. Among the others were Herbert,
Hertford, and Bedford, and not a man of the dozen or so assembled
there was not the sworn enemy of Somerset. They met to concert
measures for the further preferment of George Villiers at the
favourite's expense and to his ultimate discomfiture and downfall.
The immediate necessary step, it was decided, should be to procure
Mr. Villiers's advancement to a knighthood and to the position of
one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber. The Queen, Sir Thomas
assured them, was in the business, and would be their ally in this,
and a particularly valuable ally considering the pretences of
uxoriousness which King James maintained.</p>
<p>The company, returning to Westminster in a spirit of merry
turbulence and in an elation resulting as much from the decision
taken as from the wine consumed, espied in Fleet Street outside a
painter's shop a portrait of the Earl of Somerset exposed for
sale.</p>
<p>They drew rein to consider it, to jeer and flout a portrait
whose original was too high for personal insult. Finally to indulge
his personal hostility of that original, one of the gentlemen
commanded his servant to bespatter the canvas with mud.</p>
<p>With many a gibe for the outraged painter who rushed from his
shop belatedly to protect his wares from damage, the company rode
on in delight and pride of the puerile achievement.</p>
<p>The painter in deep resentment went off to Whitehall to bear his
plaint to my Lord of Somerset.</p>
<p>His lordship heard the story, and if he changed colour a little,
he yet commanded himself sufficiently to assume contemptuously that
it was an act of drunken folly beneath the dignity of his serious
consideration. Nevertheless, he inquired the names of the gentlemen
in question. Having obtained them, he compensated the painter, and
pondered his course of action.</p>
<p>These gentlemen were without exception not merely enemies of his
own and of the Howards, but they were those who had most signally
manifested their friendship for Mr. Villiers. He concluded that the
best retort would be to deal with their pet as they had dealt with
his portrait.</p>
<p>And so it fell out that some days later a cousin and namesake of
his own whom he had made a Gentleman of the Household, and who
happened on that day to be one of the servers at the royal table,
upset as if by accident a dish of soup over the brave satin suit of
Mr. Villiers.</p>
<p>Mr. Villiers, whilst gay and friendly and easy-going, was not
yet old enough to have learned to curb impetuosity. Annoyed by the
ruin of his finery and enraged by the instant suspicion that it was
due to no accident, he leapt to his feet so abruptly that his chair
crashed over behind him. With a foul word he caught the offending
Scot a buffet on the side of the head that made him reel.</p>
<p>There was a general outcry, a belated attempt by his immediate
neighbours to restrain him, and then silence and utter
stillness.</p>
<p>Mr. Villiers, immediately conscious of the enormity of his
offence, though hardly yet of the penalty imposed by statute, stood
abashed and foolish, making no attempt to wipe the dripping mess
from his doublet. Young Carr, recovering his balance, earned
admiration by his self-command. Swinging half-round to face the
King, he brought his heels together, and bowed as if in expression
of a respect for majesty too utter to admit of his attempting
reprisals.</p>
<p>The King, open-mouthed, his tongue protruding, presented a
picture of foolish dismay.</p>
<p>Somerset on the King's right looked on with a faintly cruel
smile about his lips and eyes that were bright and hard as
steel.</p>
<p>The remainder of the company at the long table, numbering fully
a score, and the half-dozen gentlemen servers in the background
against the tapestries of the banqueting-hall, awaited the sequel
in consternation.</p>
<p>Presently Somerset spoke, after a pause calculated to heighten
the suspense. His voice cut cold and incisively into the silence.
His words were those which in the circumstances his office of Lord
Chamberlain required of him.</p>
<p>'The guard,' he said shortly, and his cousin sprang to obey, and
went swiftly to the door.</p>
<p>A shadow crossed the King's face. But he said nothing. Respect
for the forms struggled within him with his own personal
inclinations.</p>
<p>Came the officer of the guard, a vivid figure in a coat of dull
red velvet, carrying his plumed hat in his hand, his gauntleted
left hand upon the pommel of his sword, his spurs jingling
musically as he advanced. He halted, and, grave and impassive,
awaited orders, which again, quite naturally, were given him by the
Lord Chamberlain.</p>
<p>'Captain, you will escort Mr. Villiers to his quarters and
detain him there under guard until his majesty makes known his
pleasure.'</p>
<p>Mr. Villiers in distress made a movement as if to address the
King. His majesty motioned him to silence by a wave of the
hand.</p>
<p>'Ay, ay!' he said thickly. 'You'd best go.'</p>
<p>Prudently the young man commanded himself, bowed, and went out
with the officer, the King's staring, almost vacant eyes watching
him to the door.</p>
<p>As he disappeared the stillness was broken at last by a rustling
stir. Lord Somerset sighed audibly, and spoke lightly.</p>
<p>'Mr. Villiers is over-young in temper and in knowledge for a
court.'</p>
<p>'That,' said the King's mumbling voice, 'may excuse him.'</p>
<p>His lordship raised his eyebrows. 'There's no such provision in
the statute.'</p>
<p>'The statute!' His majesty was startled. He glanced at Somerset
and away. 'Huh!'</p>
<p>Somerset signed to the servers to resume their duties. But the
King suddenly got to his feet. That mention of the statute had
agitated him. Shortly he commanded Somerset to attend him, and went
out.</p>
<p>Not until they were in his own closet and he had flung himself
irritably into a padded chair did the King speak again. 'What's
this blather of a statute?' His eyes avoided Somerset's.</p>
<p>The favourite, standing easily and gracefully by the table on
which his majesty's elbow rested, explained that which required no
explaining.</p>
<p>'I allude, as your majesty well knows, to the statute of King
Henry VIII, which provides quite clearly the penalty for Mr.
Villiers's offence. For a blow given in the presence of majesty the
offending hand shall be struck off at the wrist. It's a statute
that concerns my office closely, for it is the Lord Chamberlain's
duty to see the forfeit made, and to be in attendance to sear the
stump.'</p>
<p>The King shuddered at the mental picture evoked. His glance grew
scared.</p>
<p>'Na! Na! Ye're not supposing that I'll be governed by any such
statute of that old lecher?'</p>
<p>'Lecher or not, he was King of England, and a king of some
weight in his day, and his statutes are good law.'</p>
<p>'To the Devil with good law; ay, and with you, Rabbie! Ye're
never thinking I'll suffer the mutilation of that bonnie lad? It's
blasphemy to think of it.'</p>
<p>'It would have the advantage of making a repetition of the
offence impossible.'</p>
<p>'Why, ye heartless loon! I'll not have it, I tell ye!' He
slapped the table with his open hand.</p>
<p>Somerset bowed composedly. He even smiled. 'I do not urge it,
Sire.'</p>
<p>'I thought ye did. And it's well for you ye don't.'</p>
<p>'It should suffice to send him packing. His manners will suit
Leicestershire better than Whitehall.'</p>
<p>'That's for me to settle.'</p>
<p>'Less would scarcely become your kingly dignity.'</p>
<p>'Ye may leave me to guard my kingly dignity.'</p>
<p>'Yet in some sort it is within the duties of your Lord
Chamberlain.'</p>
<p>'Hold your clavering tongue! Will you be manifesting your spite
of this braw lad? Ye'll make me believe that ye'd be glad to see
his hand struck off, Rabbie. Hah!'</p>
<p>'I'll be content to see him go.'</p>
<p>'He's not going.'</p>
<p>'Not?' My lord was supercilious. 'I await your majesty's
commands concerning him.'</p>
<p>The King glowered at him, resenting his manner.</p>
<p>'Send him to me here. I'll read him a lesson on courtly
behaviour. That shall suffice.'</p>
<p>'Your majesty is, indeed, clement!'</p>
<p>'You make me aware of it. If I were not I'd never tolerate your
sneers. I'm finding you over-graceless these days. The higher I
place you, the more intolerable you grow. It's an ill requital for
the liberties I grant you to be wanting in respect to me.'</p>
<p>'Is it lack of respect to your majesty to desire some punishment
for one who has been flagrantly lacking in it?'</p>
<p>'Ye ken well that's not the point. Your lack of respect lies in
the tone and manner you adopt with me, and I tell you I'll not
brook it from any man.'</p>
<p>'Yet you brook worse when you suffer a blow to be struck in your
presence.'</p>
<p>'It was an act of impetuosity. The lad was annoyed, and with
some justification, by your kinsman's clumsiness.'</p>
<p>'So that now my kinsman becomes the offender! Faith, your
majesty finds every excuse for Mr. Villiers.' Somerset was bitter.
'Some days since mud was flung on a portrait of mine in Fleet
Street by this young upstart's friends. Yet your majesty forbade me
to take action against them, although that was no accident.'</p>
<p>'Was this?' The King fired the question abruptly, and his eyes
narrowed.</p>
<p>Somerset gaped, and then laughed.</p>
<p>'You'll excuse him now on the grounds that the thing was
deliberate.'</p>
<p>'It's what I'm suspecting. The lout who spilled the broth was
your kinsman. Did ye suppose I'd not observed it? There's little I
don't observe, Rabbie, as you should know by now.'</p>
<p>Somerset became really angry. He hectored it roundly, breaking
into unmeasured upbraidings. It was always so, he declared. The
King would listen to any man before himself, prefer any man's word
to his own. He was insulted on every hand, and debarred by the
King's will from all redress, whilst his majesty listened to every
tale that was carried to him. He ranted on, unreasonably and
petulantly piling up imaginary grievances as vehicles for his
spleen, until the King checked him in a passion.</p>
<p>'Will ye rail at me like a carted street-walker?' He rose
trembling. 'Now, as God's my judge, I'll have no more of this. Do
you persuade me that you mean not so much to hold me by love as by
awe, and that you have me so far in your reverence that I dare not
offend you or resist your wishes? Which of us is King? Have you
forgot? And have you forgot that you are my creature and hold all
by my favour, and that as I set you up so I can put you down? Have
you forgot that? Away with you now, and remember it in future.'</p>
<p>Somerset departed, but did not remember. A succession of
unworthy and undignified wrangles ensued now between King and
favourite on the subject of Mr. Villiers, soon, indeed, now to
become Sir George Villiers and a Gentleman of the Bedchamber.</p>
<p>His knighthood came to him by the Queen's help and favour in the
following April. It was on Saint George's Day that her majesty
begged her royal husband to bestow the accolade upon young Villiers
in honour of Saint George, whose name he bore.</p>
<p>The Earl of Somerset had made objections, especially to the
young man's advancement to be a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and he
had again hectored the King in the matter. Nevertheless, his
majesty conquered his awe of the favourite, and took refuge in the
mock-uxoriousness which he loved to practise.</p>
<p>'It's the Queen herself who asks it, Rabbie! Would ye have me
refuse our dear wife the Queen?'</p>
<p>To this his lordship could make no answer. He was driven into
sullen retreat.</p>
<p>Buxom Anne of Denmark personally led the comely young Villiers
into the King's presence, and ordered him to kneel, whilst with her
own hands she proffered James the naked sword for the accolade.</p>
<p>Somerset looked on ill-humouredly, whilst the King, shuddering
as he ever did at the sight of naked steel, took the sword, and
averting his eyes from the flash of it almost poked Mr. Villiers in
the face in the act of dubbing him knight.</p>
<p>From that moment Sir George may be considered as fully launched
upon the ocean of court life. His new duties brought him into
constant contact with the King, and those responsible for this
watched with satisfaction the good use which the comely,
intelligent young gentleman from Leicestershire made of his
opportunities. They observed with equal satisfaction the growth of
the King's favour, beheld the King himself taking in hand the lad's
tuition and providing him with tutors for some of the arts
necessary in a courtier.</p>
<p>Soon Sir George was appointed Master of the Horse, by which time
his fame had spread and his name was on every tongue, and already
he had his Court within the court and no lack of suitors for his
favour and patronage.</p>
<p>Somerset, looking on with ever-increasing ill-temper, beheld
here repeated the early steps of his own career, grew conscious at
last that a formidable rival had arisen and that there was ample
ground for his jealous apprehension of ultimate supersession. With
this added fear to plague him, he increased daily in sullenness and
irritability.</p>
<p>One last attempt the King made to soften him and to allay the
jealousy which he perceived to lie at the root of it, but which he
was mistaken in supposing to be its only source. He desired Sir
George Villiers to seek the Earl's favour. Thus he thought to
conciliate Somerset by permitting him to suppose that no
advancement was possible to any man without his countenance.</p>
<p>Sir George presented himself modestly before the great
favourite, and delivered himself of a speech in which he had been
well schooled.</p>
<p>'My lord, I desire to be your servant and creature, and to take
my court preferment under your favour, assuring your lordship that
you shall find me as faithful a servant as ever did serve you.'</p>
<p>Somerset remained seated and covered, his handsome face obscured
by the shadow of his hat. His answer was of an uncompromising
harshness.</p>
<p>'I desire none of your service, and I have no favour for you. I
will if I can break your neck. Of that be confident.'</p>
<p>The younger man, bristling with anger, drew himself up to reply,
when Sir Humphrey May, who had conducted him, restrained him by a
hand upon his arm. Thus checked, Sir George bowed distantly and
departed.</p>
<p>Somerset's contemptuous laugh followed to inflame him.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>GATHERING CLOUDS</h3>
<p>My Lord Somerset's dismissal of Sir George was duly reported to
his majesty, and lost nothing in the process. His majesty was
deeply incensed at this affront to his darling Steenie, as he now
called Villiers, from his imagined resemblance to a lovely faced
picture of Saint Stephen that hung in the banqueting hall at
Whitehall. Yet, despite his loud assertions that he would not be
ruled by awe, the King dared not take Somerset to task for his
gross treatment of the young knight.</p>
<p>No resentment can be deadlier than that which must be carried
secretly. Driven inwards, it rarely fails to transmute love into
hate. And so now, as the sequel serves to show, the King, whilst
still continuing for the sake of peace to make a show of cherishing
his Rabbie, was in his heart beginning to detest him.</p>
<p>Thus far by his petulance and peevishness had that unfortunate,
hag-ridden man unwittingly conspired with those who sought his
overthrow.</p>
<p>The two most active agents of his downfall were, oddly enough,
those two candidates for the office of Secretary of State: Sir
Thomas Lake, to whom Somerset had denied it, and Sir Ralph Winwood,
upon whom he had bestowed it. The motives of the first are plain
enough, and they have been seen at work. They are humanly
straightforward if not to be admired.</p>
<p>The motives of Sir Ralph, however, are far less obvious. He owed
his appointment to my Lord of Somerset's favour; therefore it would
seem that he should be grateful, and grateful no doubt he would
have been if he had found in the office that which he was entitled
to expect.</p>
<p>But Somerset in appointing that grim dour man had thought to
provide himself with another Overbury: one who would be content to
remain in the background, discharging the onerous duties of the
Secretaryship, whilst placing at his lordship's disposal the fruits
of his experience and knowledge of affairs so as to enable his
lordship to continue to enjoy the power and glory of guiding the
country's destinies.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph, however, had not proved at all willing so to be used.
Since he was confined to drudgery, to drudgery he would confine
himself. He gave no counsel, offered no advice, did not even
trouble to keep his patron fully supplied with information. Annoyed
by the limitations imposed upon him, he sulked strictly within
them, and left my Lord of Somerset to blunder as he chose. But he
resented his position, and studied to improve it, to render it in
fact what it was in name. Perceiving that as long as Somerset
reigned no improvement would be possible, he was quite ready to
exert himself to curtail that reign. Like Sir Thomas Lake before
him, he watchfully awaited opportunity to complete what Sir Thomas
had so admirably begun.</p>
<p>He observed the growing favour of Sir George Villiers, and
whilst in his dour, puritanical heart he despised Sir George for a
minion, yet he knew from experience that minions sometimes grow
into great ministers of State, and since they have the King's ear
they must be regarded as specially supplied by Providence for the
advancement of better men. To George Villiers, properly handled,
belonged the future, and that future would be realised with a speed
proportionate to Somerset's relegation to that past towards which
he was already striding.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph did two things. He began sedulously to cultivate the
favour of Sir George Villiers, in which he but followed the fashion
of the Court, and he watched diligently for an opportunity of
accelerating the descent of my Lord of Somerset to the limbo of
things that have been, in which he was also not quite out of
fashion.</p>
<p>And then quite unexpectedly something happened whose ultimate
issue Sir Ralph was very far from foreseeing. In his capacity as
Secretary of State, a letter reached him from the King's agent in
Brussels, which he did not choose to disclose to his master the
Earl of Somerset, or, indeed, to anyone. The agent, Mr. Thoumbal,
wrote that he had a secret of importance to communicate touching
the death of Sir Thomas Overbury. He would not write of it further,
but would come over in person to acquaint Sir Ralph with it if a
license for his return to England could be obtained.</p>
<p>The dour Sir Ralph considered. He remembered old rumours of foul
play that had been circulated at the time of Overbury's death.
Assuming now that Overbury had been done to death, Sir Ralph
propounded to himself that sound old initial question in such
inquiries: <i>Cui bono fuerit?</i> Much that had happened
subsequently might conceivably be assumed to point to the Earl of
Somerset as the person to whom the elimination of Sir Thomas
Overbury had been desirable.</p>
<p>It was a thought that acted as a spur upon the resentful
Secretary.</p>
<p>So Mr. Thoumbal was quietly brought over from Brussels, and Sir
Ralph listened to a startling demonstration of the old adage that
murder will out.</p>
<p>An English lad, an apothecary's assistant named William Reeve,
lying sick at Flushing and being taken with the fear of death, had
confessed that Sir Thomas Overbury had been poisoned in the Tower
by an injection of corrosive sublimate, administered by Reeve
himself, acting upon the orders of his master, the apothecary Paul
de Loubel, who had attended Sir Thomas two days before his death.
Because of what he knew, the lad had been given money by his master
and sent abroad immediately afterwards, which is how he came to be
in Flushing.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph, his dark, swarthy face inscrutable, made careful
notes of what Thoumbal told him, procured the agent's signature to
those notes, and dismissed him back to his post at Brussels.</p>
<p>After that, Sir Ralph informed himself cautiously of Paul de
Loubel's whereabouts&mdash;no difficult matter, since the
apothecary was well known&mdash;and he descended upon him on a
sultry day of August at his house set in the reek of Lime Street
near the Tower.</p>
<p>Dr. Loubel was a little startled by the sudden appearance in his
modest dwelling of this bulky, black-bearded, black-attired
gentleman of forbidding countenance, who announced himself as the
Secretary of State and requested a word with him in private. He
ushered him into his dingy parlour on the ground floor, and invited
him to sit. The Secretary remained standing, his back to the
window, in such a way that, to confront him, the doctor must
present his face to the light.</p>
<p>'I desire,' he said in his deep, booming voice, 'a word with you
on the subject of an apprentice of yours named William Reeve.'</p>
<p>'William Reeve? Ah, yes!' The doctor appeared a little nervous,
a little flustered, which, after all, considering the rank and
consequence of his visitor, was not surprising. It had never before
happened to him to have a Secretary of State stand questioning him
in his parlour. 'William Reeve. Yes. I remember him.'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph said nothing for a long moment, during which his
solemn, dark eyes pondered the slight, neat, nervous figure before
him. Loubel was something over fifty, lean and pale of face, with
lively, intelligent eyes and a tight mouth. His hair was thin and
grey. His speech and gesture proclaimed his French origin.</p>
<p>He waited respectfully now for the Secretary to make known his
wishes, one hand folded over the other at the level of his breast,
his eyes attentive.</p>
<p>'You sent this lad abroad, I understand, some two years
since?'</p>
<p>'Send him? Ah, no. Not send. He desire' to go.'</p>
<p>The Secretary's black brows came sternly in a frown. 'You are
not to prevaricate with me, Dr. Loubel. I warn you that my
information is very full.'</p>
<p>The doctor looked distressed, even bewildered. 'I prevaricate?
I? But to what end? Worshipful sir' (and he became emphatic), 'the
lad chose to go, desire' to go. That is no prevarication.'</p>
<p>'You gave him money to go,' said the heavy voice.</p>
<p>'Money? Ah, yes, I give him money. There was somet'ing I owed
him, somet'ing I keep and save for him. He was two years here with
me. To that I added a little present. He was a good lad. He want to
see the world. I admire ambition. I help him a little. But all told
the moneys I give him were no great amount.'</p>
<p>'What was the amount?'</p>
<p>'The amount?' Loubel reflected, forefinger laid against his nose
a moment. Then he shrugged and flung out his hands. 'But how shall
I remember the amount? It is two years since, as your worship has
said. I have forgot the amount.'</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence in which Sir Ralph pondered him
with those solemn, owlish eyes. Then the Secretary changed his line
of attack.</p>
<p>'This lad Reeve was with you when you visited Sir Thomas
Overbury in the Tower?'</p>
<p>Something crossed the Frenchman's face and was gone. It was as
if a shadow had flitted over it, too elusive for interpretation by
the watchful eyes of the Secretary. The eyelids, too, had flickered
over those quick, keen eyes at the mention of Overbury's name. But
these signs, gone in a flash, left that countenance as it had been,
alertly nervous, but otherwise composed.</p>
<p>'It is possible,' he said. 'It is probable. My assistant
commonly accompanies me. Oh, undoubtedly, yes.'</p>
<p>In his mind Sir Ralph wrote him down for a baffling fellow, with
his short, jerky sentences which answered questions with the
greatest possible economy of words, and yet contrived at the same
time to colour the answers. Sir Ralph liked voluble men. They
invariably betrayed themselves sooner or later by saying too much.
This fellow by his terseness was forcing Sir Ralph into the open;
and however much he might deplore it, into the open he must go.</p>
<p>'The lad at the point of death has made a confession,' he
announced.</p>
<p>Now at last he had succeeded in startling the little apothecary.
The man's eyes dilated. His pale face seemed to grow paler. But a
moment later, his words explained all this away. It was not the
fact of the confession that had scared him. Or at least so his
words made it appear.</p>
<p>'At the point of death? Oh! He is dead, then, that poor William?
Dead! Oh!' He let his arms fall limply to his side, the palms
turned outwards.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph damned him for a play-actor. 'Whether he's dead or
not, I don't know. He thought he was dying, and confessed. That's
all that matters.'</p>
<p>'To you. Yes. Maybe, worshipful sir. But to me ... Oh, the poor
William!'</p>
<p>Thus the man clung to grief over the lad's death, and ignored
the matter of his confession, as if it were of no account.
Willy-nilly, Sir Ralph must come still farther out.</p>
<p>'Leave that!' he said sharply. 'It is his confession that
signifies.'</p>
<p>'His confession?' The keen eyes laden with inquiry looked up
into that great pear-shaped countenance, broader at the base than
at the summit. 'But what, then, did he confess?'</p>
<p>'His share in the business of which Sir Thomas Overbury
died.'</p>
<p>Loubel stared and stared at him, his countenance expressing only
bewilderment. At last he flung out his hands in that expressive
gesture of his. 'I do not understand,' he said flatly. 'I do not
understand. Your worship has some purpose to come here. You do not
come just for the honour of my house. No? If your worship will ask
frankly what you desire to know, I will answer frankly if I
can.'</p>
<p>It was almost a rebuke, and the ponderous Sir Ralph was angered
by it. He was angered, too, by the fact that he was making no
headway. He laid all his cards on the table, abruptly.</p>
<p>'This boy confessed that Sir Thomas Overbury was murdered in the
Tower. He was murdered by a poisoned injection; an injection of
corrosive sublimate. This was prepared by you, Monsieur Loubel, and
administered by him under your directions.'</p>
<p>Blank stupefaction was spread for a long moment upon the lean,
white face of the apothecary. Then he burst into laughter loud and
prolonged, in the course of which he more than once smacked his
thigh with his open palm.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph stood stiff and resentful, waiting until these spasms
of indecent mirth should abate.</p>
<p>'Oh, but that is most comic! Most droll!' Loubel wiped a tear
from his eye. 'Be'old! I wish to poison Sir Thomas Overbury with
corrosive sublimate; therefore I do not fail to tell my assistant
what I am doing, so that I can be sure that he shall betray me! Oh,
the clever way to poison, so that nobody shall ever know about it!'
And he went off into his explosive laughter again, holding his
sides.</p>
<p>'Silence, buffoon!' roared the elephantine Sir Ralph.</p>
<p>But Loubel was no respecter of persons. He suppressed no more of
his laughter than was necessary to permit of his replying. 'It is
not me who is the buffoon in this, Sir Ralph! Not me. And it is the
best buffoonery I ever hear in all my life as an apothecary.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean, sirrah?'</p>
<p>Loubel returned to gravity. But it was a gravity behind which he
showed that mirth still lurked. 'Oh, but ask yourself, Sir Ralph.
Consider the tale that is to tell. I am to poison a gentleman in
the Tower. He is nothing to me, this gentleman. I do not know him.
But I am to poison him. Very well. We admit that first preposterous
part. I choose to do so with corrosive sublimate, and by injection.
All very clumsy. But we admit that, too. I do not give the
injection myself. Oh, no. That would be too secret, and when we
poison anybody we never desire to be secret. So I take my
assistant, and give him the clyster so that he makes the injection
for me. And at the same time I say to him: "Observe, William, this
clyster contains corrosive sublimate. I tell you this so that you
may know that I am poisoning Sir Thomas Overbury, and so that you
may go afterwards and tell Sir Ralph Winwood, the great Secretary
of State, and get me hanged for doing it." This is the tale, is it
not, Sir Ralph? And you do not understand why I laugh? You think I
laugh because I am buffoon?'</p>
<p>Under the lash of the apothecary's sarcasm, Sir Ralph stood
foolish and with empurpling countenance. But there was yet a little
more to follow.</p>
<p>'And you forget, Sir Ralph, that I act as apothecary to my
brother-in-law, Sir Theodore Mayerne, his majesty's physician. I
give Sir Thomas only such things as Sir Theodore prescribe. And if
I give him corrosive sublimate, it must have been upon the
prescription of Sir Theodore. I have his prescriptions; all of
them. Would your worship wish to see them?'</p>
<p>His worship would not. In a minatory tone his worship announced
that others might follow who might desire to see them, and he
charged Loubel to keep them secure as he valued his own neck when
he came to be examined by others. He also ventured a sarcastic hope
that when this happened Monsieur Loubel would be as ready to laugh
as he was to-day. On that Sir Ralph took his departure with a sense
of discomfiture rendered the more utter by his conviction that it
had been encompassed by the clever wits of a rogue who had known
how to make a truth wear a preposterous appearance.</p>
<p>Others should deal with Monsieur Loubel. But before taking steps
towards that end he had better lay the matter as it stood before
the King. He had forgotten until Loubel reminded him&mdash;if,
indeed, he had ever known&mdash;that Overbury had been attended at
the end by the King's physician. Even a King's physician need not
be incorruptible, especially a foreigner. The narrow, puritanical
Sir Ralph was one of those Englishmen with an innate mistrust of
all foreigners. Mayerne might easily have been within reach of my
Lord of Somerset's bribes. Thus regarded, it looked more than ever
as if Somerset might be in the business. But this his majesty
should determine.</p>
<p>And so you behold Sir Ralph Winwood posting out of London in
quest of the royal Solomon. His majesty was on a progress at the
time, and Sir Ralph came up with him at Beaulieu in Hampshire at
the house of my Lord Southampton.</p>
<p>Admitted late at night to private audience with the King, who
had guzzled himself into a crapulous condition, Sir Ralph made
known what he had learnt from Thoumbal.</p>
<p>It was remarkable to Sir Ralph how sobering an effect the scent
of business had upon his majesty. At the disclosure of the
confession made by Loubel's assistant, the vinous flush departed
from his majesty's countenance, leaving it pale, the glitter of his
eyes changed from one of intoxication to one of alertness. The
whole expression of his face was altered and sobered. When Sir
Ralph spoke of his visit to Loubel, he was interrupted by
reproof.</p>
<p>'God's death, man! Why this, before ye had seen me?'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph's great bulk was doubled in a bow. 'I accounted it my
duty, Sire.'</p>
<p>'Your duty, sir, is to do my bidding; and ye had no bidding from
me in this. Well, well? A God's name!' His majesty was testy. He
thumped the table with a fist that trembled. 'Well? What said this
man Loubel?'</p>
<p>'He laughed at me, Sire,' Sir Ralph exploded, and repeated the
sarcasms with which the apothecary had met him.</p>
<p>The King eyed him contemptuously. 'D'ye not find it matter for
laughter, yourself?' he asked. 'D'ye not perceive the absurdity of
it which this fellow Loubel has made so clear that ye must come
troubling me with such a cock-and-bull affair?'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph was disconcerted for a moment. Then, recovering, 'I
might,' he said, 'if it were not for the fact that this
apothecary's lad was given money and sent packing abroad.'</p>
<p>'And what said Loubel to that?'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph told him. The King shrugged. 'In all the circumstances
it's a sufficient answer. There's no proof or shadow of proof of
any other motive.' And on that he dismissed the Secretary with an
admonition not to waste time in future on mares' nests.</p>
<p>Smarting under something akin to a rebuke, Sir Ralph withdrew in
dudgeon, very far from satisfied that the royal acumen had not here
been at fault, and therefore all the more determined to get to the
bottom of this mystery at the first opportunity. Apothecaries' boys
are not given sums of money and sent abroad by their masters out of
sheer generosity. No one would persuade Sir Ralph of that.</p>
<p>The opportunity for which he watched came in the following week.
Sir Ralph was dining with the Earl of Shrewsbury at his town house
in Broad Street. The Countess of Shrewsbury was at the time a
prisoner in the Tower as a result of the part she had played in the
attempted escape of the Lady Arabella. To procure her what comforts
he could, the Earl was paying court to Sir Gervase Elwes, the
Lieutenant of the Tower. Sir Gervase was of the party, and with a
view to advancing his fortunes was by the Earl presented to the
Secretary of State. The presentation was accompanied by a request
to Sir Ralph that he should take the Lieutenant into his
favour.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph received him courteously. During dinner he was very
thoughtful like the dour, uncommunicative man he was reputed. He
was considering what advantage he might derive from this meeting
with the Lieutenant.</p>
<p>When dinner was done, he drew Sir Gervase away from the company,
and invited him to take a turn in the open. Sir Gervase, willing
enough, and accounting this a sign that Sir Ralph was disposed to
give attention to my Lord of Shrewsbury's recommendation, went with
him into the sunlit garden. As side by side they paced its alleys,
the dry, elderly, trim Lieutenant in red and the dark, bulky
Secretary in black, Sir Ralph startled his companion by his opening
remark.</p>
<p>'I should be glad enough to take you into my friendship, Sir
Gervase, and to serve you in any way that it lies within my power;
but I must first desire that you might clear yourself of a heavy
imputation the world generally places upon you touching the death
of Sir Thomas Overbury whilst in your charge.'</p>
<p>The Lieutenant checked in his stride. Sir Ralph, checking with
him, observed that he had lost colour, that his grey eyes were very
round and solemn.</p>
<p>'You know, sir, what was done?' Sir Gervase asked, making it
plain that he had no thought of dissimulation.</p>
<p>Sir Ralph slowly nodded his big dark head. 'Oh, yes. But not how
it was done, nor your own part in it, with which I must now be more
immediately concerned.'</p>
<p>'My part in it? Faith, my part was to do what I could to save
the wretched man in so far as this was possible without hurt to my
own self. For my Lord Privy Seal was in the business.'</p>
<p>'My Lord Privy Seal!' Sir Ralph's heart missed a beat in his
excitement. 'D'ye mean my Lord of Somerset?'</p>
<p>'No, no. The Lord Privy Seal that was then. My Lord Northampton.
The Lady Frances Howard, that is now Countess of Somerset, was in
it, too, and I knew not who else might be behind them. So that in
moving to thwart their ends I ran some risk, Sir Ralph; yet for my
conscience' sake I never hesitated. But in the end, as I believe,
they prevailed in spite of all that I could do. And that, Sir
Ralph, is all the part I had in the matter of that unfortunate
gentleman. I take God to witness.'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph nodded slowly, and they moved on between the privet
hedges. They went some little way in silence, the Secretary's chin
upon his breast, his eyes thoughtful.</p>
<p>Here was a pretty tale to tell the King. Would his majesty still
agree that Sir Ralph busied himself with a mare's nest when he
found it odd that an apothecary's boy should be given money and
sent abroad by his master? And the Countess of Somerset was in it,
and my Lord of Northampton, who at the time had been Lord
Somerset's closest friend. Was it to be doubted that the Earl of
Somerset was in it, too, and that here was a weapon with which
finally to destroy the upstart favourite?</p>
<p>Sir Ralph spoke slowly at last: 'Sir, you must convince me of
this a little more; that your own part was what you say it was.
What were the measures that you took to guard your prisoner when
you discovered that his life was being attempted, and how came you
to make the discovery?'</p>
<p>The Lieutenant answered without any hesitation. 'As to the last,
it seemed to me at the time the result of Divine Providence. There
came to the Tower to be servant to Sir Thomas a fellow named
Weston, recommended by the Master of the Armoury. He replaced Sir
Thomas's own servant who could not be trusted not to carry
messages. When Weston had been there a week, I met him one evening
as he was carrying up the prisoner's soup. He held up a small
phial, and asked me, "Shall I give it to him now?"'</p>
<p>'"Give him what?" said I.</p>
<p>'"Why, this," and he added in a whisper: "The rosalgar."</p>
<p>'"Rosalgar?" I said. "Are ye mad? What is't ye mean,
fellow?"</p>
<p>'He fell into great confusion at that. "Surely, sir, you know
what's to be done," he cried.</p>
<p>'"To be done, sirrah?" I answered him, and I took him by the
collar of his coat, demanding a plain tale with a threat to have
him flogged if he lied to me, with perhaps worse to follow. In his
terror the man shielded himself behind those that had set him on.
He was acting, he swore, upon orders of Mrs. Turner, who was
employed by persons in high places, and since there was no reason
in the world why so mean a fellow should have ends of his own to
serve against Sir Thomas, it was not difficult to believe him.</p>
<p>'I took the phial from him, and flung away the poison. I
realised that I was swimming in dangerous waters; nevertheless, I
adjured him by God and his conscience to be no party to anything so
foul as murder, and that, if the offences of Sir Thomas Overbury
were such as to merit death, it must be death in lawful manner and
after trial.</p>
<p>'After that there were some delicacies sent to the prisoner from
my Lady Frances, by a woman named Turner. They came from time to
time, tarts and jellies, and once a partridge, all of which I
intercepted, and had others prepared in their stead, keeping my own
counsel in the matter lest I provoke against me the resentment of
those who were at work. But in the end they had their way in
despite of all my vigilance, and it was, as I believe and as Weston
hath since confessed to me, by a rascally apothecary's servant, who
was corrupted. His master was an approved, honest man, as I thought
and still do, acting upon the directions of Dr. Mayerne, who was
sent from court to minister to Sir Thomas when he was sick.'</p>
<p>Such was the Lieutenant's tale, and to Sir Ralph it was a
triumph to find himself justified of the suspicions which the King
had treated with such contempt. Moreover, it afforded him at last
the thing he sought. It should make an end, not only of Somerset,
but of the Howards and all the Spanish party.</p>
<p>'This man Weston?' he inquired. 'Where is he now?'</p>
<p>'He has remained with me in the Tower.'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph nodded slowly. 'Let him continue there awhile.' He
turned fully to face the Lieutenant. 'You have been frank and
honest with me, Sir Gervase, and I must esteem you for it however
much I may wish you had taken an earlier opportunity of disclosing
your full knowledge of this dark affair. Let us now return.' He
took him by the arm in friendly fashion and led him back to the
house. 'You shall hear from me soon again,' he promised him, and
this with a smile which entirely reassured the unfortunate Sir
Gervase.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE AVALANCHE</h3>
<p>Once again Sir Ralph sought the King, this time at Windsor, and
being private with him once more announced that it was touching the
death of Sir Thomas Overbury that he desired to be heard.</p>
<p>The King startled him by the vehemency of the passion into which
he was flung.</p>
<p>'God's death, man! Am I never to hear the end of that
knave?'</p>
<p>'There are matters touching his end,' said the grim Secretary,
'with which it imports that your majesty should become acquainted.'
And he proceeded calmly to repeat what he had extracted from Sir
Gervase Elwes. The royal irritation gave place to blank
stupefaction.</p>
<p>'Tell me this again,' he begged when Sir Ralph's tale was done.
'Let me have it all from the beginning.'</p>
<p>He was very attentive during that repetition, sitting very
still, with his hat pulled over his eyes, whilst his fingers toyed
absently with the diamond buttons on his green velvet doublet. Long
after Sir Ralph had done, he sat on in silence, blinking solemnly
what time he turned the matter this way and that in his mind.</p>
<p>'Look you, friend Winwood,' he said at last, 'command me this
fellow Elwes to set down in writing what he has told you. Let me
have it under his own hand that I may consider it.'</p>
<p>Winwood departed and was absent on the business for three
days.</p>
<p>On his return he brought a letter from Sir Gervase Elwes which
set forth all that the Lieutenant had already orally disclosed. It
was the letter of a man who had nothing to conceal, and who was
glad, as in the course of it he asserted, to ease himself of a
heavy burden.</p>
<p>The King read and re-read it, and announced at last the opinion
that the matter was one for the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
<p>'You had best send that letter to Coke, and bid him act upon
it.'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph opined that a beginning should be made by the arrest
of Loubel, and by that opinion provoked the King's wrathful
contempt.</p>
<p>'Loubel will laugh in the face of Coke as he laughed in yours.
Loubel's answer is plain. If he had prepared an injection of
corrosive sublimate, he'd never have confided the fact to his
assistant. That much is clear. And if we begin by provoking
ridicule, how shall justice ever be done?'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph ventured to point out Sir Gervase's assertion that the
apothecary's servant had been corrupted; that Weston had said that
the lad had had twenty pounds for his work.</p>
<p>'Ay, ay,' the King agreed. 'The apothecary's apprentice may well
have been corrupted; but not by the apothecary, who had no need to
do it. Elwes says himself that he's an approved, honest man; and
ye'll remember that he was acting for Mayerne, his brother-in-law,
whom I myself sent to minister to Overbury. There are grounds for
arresting the lad. But ye tell me he's dead or dying abroad. So
we'll begin at the other end. Let Weston be examined first. Bid
Coke attend to it.'</p>
<p>Sir Ralph accounted the King unreasonable, and the procedure
wantonly irregular. But the royal command was definite, and Sir
Ralph dared not trifle with it. He returned to London, and conveyed
those commands exactly to Sir Edward Coke.</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice got promptly to work, and an avalanche
followed.</p>
<p>Weston was arrested, examined, and re&euml;xamined, cluttered
out of his senses by the bullyings of Coke, until he confessed all
that was required of him and probably a great deal more than was
true. The phial with which Sir Gervase had surprised him had been
given to him by one Franklin, an alchemist and necromancer who
dwelt behind the Exchange; on another occasion he had received
through his son from Lady Essex another phial full of yellowish
water for the prisoner, which again he had taken to Sir Gervase,
who had broken it and thrown away the contents; and there had been
pots of jellies and tarts and other delicacies supplied by Mrs.
Turner, by whom he had been formerly employed.</p>
<p>Thus the affair began, and out of Weston's examinations followed
promptly the arrests of Mrs. Turner and Franklin, whom he had
incriminated. Next Sir Gervase Elwes was placed under arrest as an
accessory, and when he informed Coke that Weston had been employed
by him as a result of the recommendation of Sir Thomas Monson, Sir
Thomas also was arrested. From him was elicited the fact that he
had recommended Weston at the request of Lady Essex and my Lord
Northampton.</p>
<p>Next the Lord Chief Justice summoned before him for examination
Paul de Loubel, Overbury's servant Lawrence Davies, and his
secretary Payton.</p>
<p>Loubel stoutly maintained that Sir Thomas had not been poisoned
at all, but had died, in his opinion, of consumption, and that
anyway for his own part he had given Sir Thomas no physic save such
as was prescribed for him by Dr. Mayerne, whose prescriptions he
put forward. Since this was not at all the evidence Coke desired,
Loubel was troubled no further.</p>
<p>Davies and Payton between them cast suspicion upon the Earl of
Somerset; the first by asserting that he had carried letters from
the Earl to Sir Thomas in one of which there was a powder; the
second by telling of the violent quarrel he had overheard between
Overbury and the Earl one night at Whitehall some days before
Overbury's arrest, a revelation which seemed to supply a motive for
the crime.</p>
<p>Forman, betrayed also by Weston, was dead, and could no longer
be brought to answer for his dark practices. But unfortunately some
letters to him from Lady Essex survived, which were capable of a
terrible construction, and certain puppets in wax and lead which
obviously had been employed for purposes of incantation and
witchcraft.</p>
<p>And now seeing that great names were being named, the Lord Chief
Justice petitioned the King that others of greater rank be joined
with him to form a commission of investigation, and his majesty,
acceding, appointed the old Chancellor Ellesmere, Lennox, and
Zouch.</p>
<p>Echoes of the proceedings reverberated through the country,
magnified by rumour in their progress. They came to startle the
Court, which in those days of early October was at Royston, and no
member of it more than the Earl of Somerset, for all that he did
not yet begin to guess the extent to which his own name and that of
his lady were being tossed about.</p>
<p>His relations with the King had been going from bad to worse
ever since the brutal rebuff which he had administered to young
Villiers. As if to compensate the latest favourite for what he had
suffered at the hands of my Lord of Somerset, the King had shown
him an increasing tenderness, and this had but served further to
nourish his lordship's rancorous jealousy. It was in vain that the
King sought to reason with him and to assure him that none should
ever stand higher in the royal esteem than himself. Somerset
preferred the evidence of his senses to assurances, and dreaded
whither the favour shown to Villiers might ultimately lead.
Possibly with Overbury behind him to steer him in matters of
statesmanship and clearly to point the way, he might have kept his
head, content that the King should fondle and toy with his darling
Steenie so long as power remained in his own hands. But groping his
way more or less blindly now through matters of statecraft,
conscious that he was little more than a tool in the hands of the
Howards for their own ends, which might well be dangerous ones, his
confidence deserted him, and he was in no case to suffer any
rivals.</p>
<p>Hence those unseemly outbursts of jealousy which at once
infuriated and distressed the King. Once, indeed, just before
coming to Royston, his majesty had threatened him that if he
persevered in his arrogance he would be deprived of his offices and
dismissed the Court, which had merely served to goad Somerset into
an exasperatingly unreasonable retort.</p>
<p>'Ha! So the murder's out! That is what you desire. To be rid of
me. After all the fond, faithful service I have given, I am to be
discarded for the first pretty fribble that takes your majesty's
eye. That is your aim; and to make it easy you find fault with me,
and provoke me into giving you justification.'</p>
<p>The King, infuriated by the calculated perversity of this
interpretation of the facts, which it seemed idle to attempt to
combat by reason, gibbered and stormed and threatened, and finally
wept.</p>
<p>After that Somerset kept out of the King's way, sulking. He
accompanied the Court to Royston, dragging at his heels a veritable
Court of his own made up of his gentlemen and attendants, and at
Royston he continued to sulk in his lodgings until the King sent
for him. That was on the morning on which the commission of inquiry
had been appointed to assist the Lord Chief Justice in the matter
of investigating the death of Sir Thomas Overbury.</p>
<p>As Somerset stepped into the chamber where the King awaited him
alone, James, despite his half-formed resolve to make an end of
relations that were become impossible, could not help rolling his
eyes over the man in sheer admiration of his grace and beauty. He
was dressed in blue velvet slashed in the sleeves and the
ballooning trunks to show a satin lining of paler blue. His
stockings, drawn creaselessly tight, and rolled at the knee, were
gartered with broad ribbons fringed with gold. He was partly
swathed in a blue satin cloak, and emerging from its folds a fine
hand, almost as white as the lace cuff of his sleeve, rested on the
gold hilt of his sword. Erect and broad of shoulder, whence he
tapered gracefully, he carried his golden head proudly upon his
fine cambric ruff. His hair and beard were carefully dressed. His
splendid eyes, once gently liquid and appealing, were now proud and
compelling in their level glance.</p>
<p>The King combed his beard, feasting his eyes upon him in silence
for some moments. There was a virility in the man, a beauty that
was entirely male, such as his majesty delighted to behold. At last
he shifted in his chair, and fetched a sigh, perhaps at the thought
that so fine a fellow should by his own wilfulness have doomed
himself to be broken.</p>
<p>'I've sent for you, Robin, to show you a note I had from Coke
this morning. The matter concerns you something closely.'</p>
<p>His lordship advanced, flung hat and gloves upon a chair, loosed
his cloak, and took the paper which his majesty proffered. He moved
aside to the window, to read it, for the October morning was dull,
the light indifferent, and the Lord Chief Justice's hand a crabbed
one.</p>
<p>The King watched him furtively the while from under his sandy
brows, his slightly protruded tongue moving slowly upon his nether
lip. His majesty was seated at his work-table, whose surface was a
marvel of untidiness. Books large and small were heaped upon it,
documents of every character littered it, and some that were
important were buried there almost beyond recovery, and mingling
with all this dusty array of scholarship and statesmanship lay
varvels, jesses, feathered hawk-lures, a dog-whip, a hunting-horn,
and other odds and ends belonging to the chase or to the stables.
His majesty himself was wrapped in a sad-coloured dressing-gown, a
blue velvet nightcap pulled tightly down upon his brows. Thus he
lolled there watching Somerset as he read, observing the man's
violent start, and the gradual draining of colour from his face.
For what the Lord Chief Justice had written was that there was
vehement suspicion against the Earl of Somerset as accessory to the
poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury before the fact done.</p>
<p>He faced the King again, and laughed harshly and without mirth,
his eyes aflash with anger in his white face.</p>
<p>'Here's midsummer frenzy from Coke!' he exclaimed. 'God's death,
was the man drunk when he wrote this?'</p>
<p>The King looked scared as he met the fury of that glance and
tone. But he commanded himself, and even achieved an assumption of
dignity and of judicial calm.</p>
<p>'Ye'll observe that he speaks of no more than suspicion.'</p>
<p>'Ay! Suspicion. "Vehement suspicion." A plague on his soul for
his impudence, the fool! As I live, he shall be taught a proper
respect for his betters. He shall learn what it means to meddle
with me.'</p>
<p>'Tush! Tush! Coke is Lord Chief Justice. In such like matters he
has no betters in this realm; and he must proceed to them by such
courses as seem proper to him.'</p>
<p>'However improper in themselves?' Somerset challenged.</p>
<p>'On my soul, there's nought improper here. If in such evidence
as he already possesses Coke finds grounds for suspecting what he
says is suspicious, am I to blame him?'</p>
<p>His lordship flung himself without ceremony or invitation into a
chair. He was trembling with anger. To steady himself he leaned
forward, elbows on knees, facing the King.</p>
<p>'Who started this hare?' he demanded. 'This hare of Overbury's
being poisoned?'</p>
<p>'Sir Ralph Winwood was set upon the trail by the Lieutenant of
the Tower.'</p>
<p>'And this trail leads to me, does it?'</p>
<p>The King showed no resentment of the courtier's disrespectful
vehemence. He maintained his quiet, half-cowed manner.</p>
<p>'At present Coke appears to think so.'</p>
<p>'And if he follows it, he must find that it leads to me only in
passing; that it leads beyond me. That it leads upwards to heights
along which Coke may hesitate to pursue it.'</p>
<p>The King raised his eyebrows, opened wide his pale, watery eyes
in a fine display of astonishment. 'Why, Robin! Then ye do know
something of this matter?'</p>
<p>'Know something?' Somerset was leaning farther forward, scowling
at him now. 'Know something?' he repeated on a rising inflection.
Then he laughed in anger and scorn. 'I know what your majesty
knows.'</p>
<p>Still the King showed no resentment. Amazement seemed his only
emotion.</p>
<p>'What I know? What I know? And what do I know, Robin?'</p>
<p>Somerset got up abruptly. 'What no man in England knows better.
How Sir Thomas Overbury died.'</p>
<p>There was a silence in which they eyed each other, Somerset taut
as a bowstring, his air fierce, the King sagging together in his
chair, his face entirely vacuous. At last his majesty moistened his
lips with his tongue, and spoke, quietly and slowly.</p>
<p>'God knows what ye're implying, Robin. God knows what strange
maggot's burrowing in your brain. Yet in a sense what ye say is
true. In a sense there's no man better informed than myself of what
happens in this realm. Of this business I know all that's known up
till this present, from the notes Coke has sent me. Ye'd best look
at them. It'll help you to understand how the suspicion against
yourself has come to be formed. Here, man!'&mdash;and he held out a
little sheaf made up of some four pages.</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, marvelling, intimidated by the royal manner in the
unusual calm of which there was something formidable, Somerset took
the papers.</p>
<p>They were in Coke's writing, and they presented a summary of the
evidence supplied by the persons so far examined: Weston, Monson,
Elwes, Davies, Franklin, and Payton.</p>
<p>As Somerset read, following the spoor that had been started by
Sir Gervase Elwes, and saw how it led through his own wife to
himself, his senses reeled. The solid earth of reality seemed to be
slipping from under his feet.</p>
<p>He cast his mind back to that interview with the King some few
days before Overbury died, when the King's own interest in the
man's suppression was revealed, and he passed from that to the
interview that had followed Overbury's death when he had all but
accused the King of having sent Mayerne to murder him, an
accusation which the King had not attempted to deny. Yet here was a
circumstantial tale, confirmed and corroborated <i>ad nauseam</i>
by a host of independent witnesses, which established something
altogether different, which already deeply incriminated his
countess and might end by incriminating himself as deeply.</p>
<p>If his reason was bludgeoned by those notes, yet his instincts
rose up violently to reject them.</p>
<p>''Tis all false, impossible!' he cried out. 'Your majesty knows
it to be false!' His arrogance was all gone. He was a man
distracted, terrified, a change which the watchful King was not
slow to observe.</p>
<p>'How should I know it to be false?'</p>
<p>'Because your majesty knows what really occurred.'</p>
<p>'Ay! I know it now, from those notes. They leave little room for
doubt, unless all those men are liars and have agreed to tell the
same tale. Yet I never knew men to agree to lies that would put the
rope round their necks, and there are several there who have
admitted that which must bring them to the gallows. Will you still
blame Coke for his suspicions?'</p>
<p>Somerset looked blankly at the King. His wits were broken.</p>
<p>'There is something here I do not understand,' he said weakly,
passing a hand over his brow in a gesture of mental distress. 'But
this I know, as God's my witness, I had no hand in Tom's death,
nor, I'll stake my soul's salvation, had Frances.'</p>
<p>'Yet you perceive what feeds the suspicion of Coke. You stood to
profit by his death. Both of you stood to profit by it. He might
have said that which would have made your marriage impossible.'</p>
<p>'Does your majesty believe this?' Somerset was almost fierce
again.</p>
<p>'Na, na! It's no question of what I believe, but of what Coke
believes, of what these several rogues who have confessed justify
him in believing. And you'll have to answer it when he sends for
you, as send for you, no doubt, he must. Ye'll see that I cannot
arrest the processes of law; no, not though you were my own son,
Robin.'</p>
<p>The young Earl's thoughts flew instantly to his countess. If he
must answer, then so must she, against whom the suspicion was even
more vehement than against himself.</p>
<p>'My God!' he groaned. 'Is Coke to bully Frances? She's in no
state of health to bear it.'</p>
<p>And then he bethought him that she, after all, might be able to
explain how all this came about, point out the flaw in this
dreadful chain that had been forged against them. 'I'd best go to
her,' he said. 'If your majesty will give me leave, I'll go at
once.' His tone was humble. He was a beaten man.</p>
<p>The King looked at him almost wistfully. 'Ay, ay, Robin. Get you
to her. Then come to me again.'</p>
<p>He took his leave, gathered up his hat and gloves, and went out
in quest of grooms and horses. His majesty sat very still at his
littered table after he had departed; the prominent pale eyes were
wistful, but there was the least vestige of a smile about the
loose-lipped mouth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>VALEDICTION</h3>
<p>By heavy, miry roads, against a chill October wind and through a
country all golden now in its autumn garb, the Earl of Somerset
rode recklessly from Royston with no more than two grooms to attend
him. He covered the distance almost at a stretch, with only two
brief pauses at Hitchin and Saint Albans, where fresh horses were
procured, nor slackened from a gallop until nightfall and darkness
made it imperative to go more cautiously.</p>
<p>He came at last, towards midnight, a spent man on a spent horse,
with two spent attendants labouring after him, to the gates of the
great house at Henley where the Countess was then residing.</p>
<p>Haggard and splashed with mud from head to foot, he reeled like
a drunkard into the chill hall to which her chamberlain admitted
him. He ordered lights to be brought, servants to be roused, and a
fire to be kindled in the small room on the right of the hall. And
thither, whilst his orders were still being executed, almost as
soon as they had dragged the muddy boots from his legs and brought
him a hot posset of sack, came her ladyship, alarmed by this
midnight arrival, to inquire into its reason.</p>
<p>She came wrapped in a quilted gown and with hair unbound, her
bare feet thrust into fur-lined slippers. She was very pale, and
the dark shadows about her lovely eyes seemed to increase their
size and heighten their brilliance. Her face looked thin and
pinched. She was now in the seventh month of her pregnancy; and
bethinking him of this as he regarded her, his tenderness welled up
and his distraction increased at the thought of how he came to
trouble her.</p>
<p>Very gently he took her in his arms, stroking her hair and
soothing the alarm his abrupt appearance had begotten. She clung to
him protesting that whatever it was that brought him she was glad
to have him with her, and hoped that he would remain some days.</p>
<p>This, while the half-clad servants still came and went in the
room in their ministrations for his comfort. At last when they were
gone and the logs crackled aflame on the hearth, he told her, as
gently as he could, of the dreadful business that brought him.</p>
<p>They were standing before the fire, his lordship leaning upon
the overmantel, when he began the tale of Coke's suspicions, and no
sooner had he come to the matter of Weston's allegations than with
a little moan she sank against him, and his arms went round her to
save her from falling.</p>
<p>She lay thus against his breast, with closed eyes and breathing
heavily, a pallor as of death upon her face, and for a moment he
thought that she had swooned. But in the next moment she had
recovered, and bade him continue, assured him of her attention.</p>
<p>In increasing trouble of mind, his loyalty battling against the
most dreadful fears, he resumed his tale, and, as he talked on, she
gradually and by an effort recovered herself from the shock the
first intimation of the business had dealt her.</p>
<p>When he had done there was a long silence. His trouble of mind
increased with every moment of it, until at last, unable to endure
it longer, he begged her to say something, to show him the flaw in
this chain of evidence that had been wrought against them.</p>
<p>He knew, he protested, that these were but the assertions of
evil-minded men, who, be it to protect themselves or so as to hurt
him, were deliberately lying. But liars seldom were consistent. At
some part of every falsehood the proof of it was revealed. So must
it be now. Let them consider this thing together; let them see at
what point the pieces did not fit. Her own knowledge of her
relations with Mrs. Turner, whose servant Weston had been, must
help her there. He implored her to speak, and to set his fears at
rest.</p>
<p>She squatted down before the fire, sitting on her heels,
mechanically holding a white hand to the blaze. Her unbound hair
hung like a golden mantle about her white-clad shoulders. Standing
beside and above her, leaning again upon the overmantel, he could
not see her face, and it was some moments before he heard her
voice, its tone dull and level.</p>
<p>'Be patient with me, Robin. Be merciful.'</p>
<p>'Merciful?' Something seemed to grip his heart and tighten upon
it. 'Merciful?'</p>
<p>'Ay, merciful. Was it not Montaigne who said, as Christ might
well have said, that to understand all is to forgive all?'</p>
<p>A silence followed. He leaned on, looking down upon that
huddled, pathetic heap of womanhood all white and gold at his feet.
A chill crept up through his body, so that he felt his skin
contracting and roughening. From the park outside came the call of
an owl, harsh upon the stillness. Within there was no sound save
the hissing of the logs, and as it seemed to him the thudding of
his heart.</p>
<p>'Forgive all?' he echoed at last in a hushed voice of horror.
'Forgive all? Frances! Is it forgiveness that you need? Is it true,
then, this foulness?'</p>
<p>She seemed to crouch lower, as they crouch who fear a blow. 'I
loved you, Robin, as I love you now, and shall always love you come
what may. This man would have denied that love its full fruition. I
had suffered so much through my love for you. I had been brave.
Dear God, how brave I had been! And when at last the reward was
within reach, that knave would have interposed himself between you
and me. Remember that, Robin. Think only of that when you judge
me.'</p>
<p>'Oh, God!' he groaned. He folded his arms upon the overmantel,
and laid his head against them. 'You confess to being a murderess!
You, Frances!'</p>
<p>She did not answer him. She sat on, huddled there, rocking a
little, feeling as if she would swoon in her agony, yet making no
sound.</p>
<p>'God!' he said again in a thick voice of passion. 'By your deed
you justified him of his attitude towards you.'</p>
<p>It was crueller than a blow. Yet it did not numb her wits.</p>
<p>'His attitude towards me justified my deed,' she answered him.
'Do not reverse the order of these happenings. I had reached the
limit of endurance. This man, for the sake of his own ambition or
else out of the evil of his heart, would have imposed upon me a
suffering greater than any I had yet borne. I had to choose. I had
to choose between him and myself. What mercy did he deserve at my
hands who showed me none? Be just, Robin! In God's name be
just!'</p>
<p>'Just!' He echoed, and then he laughed. 'You may reserve these
pleas for Coke.'</p>
<p>'Coke!' She threw back her head and looked up at him. He beheld
the leaden pallor of her face, the sudden terror which abruptly had
effaced its beauty.</p>
<p>'Ah! That frightens you!' he sneered.</p>
<p>She rose to her knees. 'Ay, it frightens me, but not for myself.
If this knowledge should destroy your love, I care not what becomes
of me. But there is the child to think of, Robin.'</p>
<p>He strode away from the hearth, and set himself to pace the
room, a man distracted by the sudden and utter collapse of all his
world about him, a man incapable in that dreadful hour of
marshalling his thoughts in a coherent sequence. One fact stood
out. He was faced with ruin. Ruin complete and irreparable. At a
single thrust he was toppled from the great eminence to which he
had climbed. And he remembered then that he had climbed to it with
Overbury's help. Overbury alone could have hoisted him to it,
Overbury alone maintained him permanently there. And she had
murdered Overbury; and now the inevitable consequences of
Overbury's fall were overtaking him. He was to be dragged down
after him, even as Overbury had foretold, and to be dragged down in
ignominy, in infamy.</p>
<p>She rose labouredly, and stood watching him, supporting herself
against the overmantel even as he had supported himself. Her
sensitiveness required no words from him, no spoken upbraidings;
she gathered from his silence, his pacing and his distracted mien,
all that was passing in his tortured mind, and sensed something of
the aversion to herself that was rising in him. Presently she
spoke.</p>
<p>'Robin, I need your help, your mercy.'</p>
<p>He paused, and his wild eyes glared at her. 'And do you hope for
it?'</p>
<p>She shook her head. 'Not for myself. For myself I would not ask
it. I have said that if knowledge kills your love I care little
what may befall. But there is a child&mdash;your child and
mine&mdash;quickening in my womb. If I am destroyed, that innocent
is destroyed with me.'</p>
<p>'Is it not better so?' he asked her grimly. 'Is it not better
that this child should never live than that it should bear the
brand of infamy? That it should be pointed out as the offspring of
assassins, of poisoners? For in this ruin I shall be involved with
you. Your conviction inevitably must drag my own at its heels.'</p>
<p>Thus he started a fresh terror in her, brought her love for him
to override even her maternal instincts. 'That it never shall!' she
cried fiercely. 'I will tell the whole truth; declare that the
whole guilt is mine; that you had no part in it. And since you had
no part in it, what evidence can there be against you?'</p>
<p>'Evidence?' He laughed shortly. 'My enemies will see to that.
You have delivered me into their hands, doomed me to such a ruin as
they could never have hoped to encompass.'</p>
<p>She wrung her hands, driven almost to frenzy. Yet by a
stupendous effort still commanded herself, so that she might grasp
the tiller and steer the frail barque of their lives through these
angry seas. 'Then, for your own sake and for the child's, you must
make a fight, Robin. I ask it not for myself. I have played and
lost, God knows. I matter nothing now, and you need not weigh me.
Think only of yourself, of the child and yourself. You can sway the
King. You have influence with him. Show him your peril. Be frank
with him. Confess my part in this. He will never abandon you to
your enemies, and for the child's sake you must prevail upon him
not to abandon me. Afterwards, if it is your will, I will go my
ways, and never trouble you again. Oh, Robin, Robin, I would so
gladly give my miserable life for you!'</p>
<p>He stood there frowning, white and helpless. Torn this way and
that, between anger and pity.</p>
<p>'What can the King do now? The engines of the law have been set
in motion. Can the King arrest them? Can he command Coke to desist
from bringing these malefactors to justice? Upon what grounds would
that be possible? Weston, Franklin, and Turner have revealed
themselves for foul rats who live by evil, who make a trade of it.
Are they to go free? And if they do not, how shall those escape
whom they will betray for having employed them? The King can do
nothing in this pass.' He swung about and resumed his pacing. 'I
came to you in such confidence that between us we could tear this
thing to shreds, and now ...'</p>
<p>He fell silent and paced on, his chin sunk to his breast, his
eyes on the ground, his countenance distorted. At last he paused to
look at her. She was shivering, as she leaned faintly there by the
hearth; her teeth were chattering, her lips were blue.</p>
<p>'You are cold,' he said dully, mechanically, and added: 'Get you
to bed. There is no more to be done or said.'</p>
<p>She realised the truth of it. That night something had been
slain and buried, something which she had laboured so hard and, in
desperate need, so ruthlessly to bring into existence. She bowed
her head and moved stiffly across to the door. There she paused,
and turned.</p>
<p>'What shall you do, Robin?' she asked him piteously.</p>
<p>'So soon as it is dawn I shall set out to return to
Royston.'</p>
<p>'Shall I see you before you ride?'</p>
<p>He shook his head. 'To what end? All has been said, I
think.'</p>
<p>She opened the door. Yet on the threshold she paused again, and
stood a moment hesitating. 'Will you kiss me, Robin ... for the
last time, perhaps? I may never see you again.'</p>
<p>At that the man in him broke, and he fell suddenly to sobbing
like a child. He ran to her, gathered her to him, and still sobbing
kissed her face and neck, whilst she dry-eyed clung to him in
thankfulness and anguish.</p>
<p>'All is not yet lost,' he vowed in a broken voice. 'What man can
do I'll do. I'll see the King. I'll cast myself upon his mercy.
I'll go on my knees to him. He'll be content to banish us, perhaps.
Keep up your heart, my Fanny. All is not yet lost. Trust me. Trust
me. Now go. Go rest you, child, and pray.'</p>
<p>Thus, in that sudden short sharp gust of pity for her, for
himself, and perhaps for the unborn child.</p>
<p>But when two days later he was back at Royston&mdash;for the
weakness of the flesh prevented the return journey being
accomplished in a day&mdash;it was not in sackcloth and ashes, nor
in any mood of humility that he sought the King.</p>
<p>As he rode, there had recurred to him certain aspects of the
case which at Henley had been temporarily blotted out by the
distraction his wife's revelations had brought him. He remembered
again that interview with James which had followed immediately upon
Overbury's death, remembered it more particularly now, recalled the
very words the King had used. If ever words admitted guilt, the
King's had admitted it when he had bidden Somerset be reconciled.
There was a dark mystery here which baffled Somerset as he rode,
until as a result of much brooding he suddenly perceived the light.
It revived his broken courage, mantled him once more in his wonted
arrogance, and sent him with firm step and chin held high to seek
the King, indifferent to the covert sneers and sly, mocking glances
that followed him as he crossed the antechamber.</p>
<p>It was close upon dinner-time when he came seeking his majesty,
and he took it for a good omen that notwithstanding this the King
made no attempt to postpone the meeting, but dismissed the
gentlemen who were with him in his closet, and sat as before at his
work-table to hear the result of my lord's excursion to Henley.</p>
<p>'Ye're well returned, Rabbie,' he was greeted, 'and in good
time, for Coke has sent for you to go to London.'</p>
<p>Somerset raised his eyebrows. But he did not appear dismayed.
'Already?' he exclaimed.</p>
<p>'It's no matter for delays, man. Coke is a diligent servant. And
I hope you'll prove no less.'</p>
<p>'Coke can wait,' said his lordship composedly, for all that his
face was white and jaded, his eyes red from weariness. And he
added, 'I'm not going.'</p>
<p>'Not going? What's that ye're saying? It's a summons of the law.
If Coke sent for me, I should have to go. There's no avoiding
it.'</p>
<p>'Your majesty may yet come to a different opinion. You may come
to consider sending word to Coke that the matter of those notes of
his examinations is just so much rubbish so far as my incrimination
or that of my countess is concerned.'</p>
<p>'Rubbish, man? Rubbish?'</p>
<p>'Consider, Sire, the sum of the tale these rogues tell, when all
is added together. Over a period of five months Weston is in the
Tower to administer poisons to Overbury, which he says are procured
for him by Mrs. Turner and by Franklin. There is rosalgar, arsenic,
<i>aqua fortis</i>, and Heaven knows what else besides; and yet in
all this time Sir Thomas does not die.'</p>
<p>'Because the Lieutenant of the Tower was watchful, and had moved
Weston to play a double game: to accept the bribes of those who had
placed him there without carrying out their orders.'</p>
<p>'It nowhere says in these notes that Weston ultimately complied
with those orders, and gave any of the poisons to Sir Thomas.'</p>
<p>'Yet he must have done so, as is clear; or else Sir Thomas would
not have died.'</p>
<p>'Not unless someone else had stepped in at the last moment;
someone who did not hesitate to do that which Weston dared not do
since he had been discovered and intimidated by the
Lieutenant.'</p>
<p>The King's glance shifted uneasily. He stroked his beard,
spreading his hand so that the gesture partly concealed his gaping
mouth.</p>
<p>'Nay, as to that I know nought. It is a matter for Coke.'</p>
<p>'But the notes say something to the matter. Weston, in fact,
declares as much. And so does Sir Gervase Elwes. There was an
apothecary's boy with Overbury two days before he died.'</p>
<p>'The boy is dead,' the King snapped, 'and cannot now be brought
to testify.'</p>
<p>'No need for it.' His lordship was almost airy. 'He is but a
tool of no account. He did no more than he was bid. The apothecary
himself would be with him; and the apothecary would be of a
certainty Dr. Mayerne's man, to do as Dr. Mayerne prescribed. Now
Mayerne was sent by your majesty to minister to Overbury who at the
time was sick, and it would be&mdash;would it
not?&mdash;preposterous to suppose that Mayerne was guilty of
procuring his murder.'</p>
<p>They looked into each other's eyes a moment. There was a certain
grimness in his lordship's glance, complete vacuity in the
King's.</p>
<p>'Preposterous, indeed,' said the thick guttural voice of
James.</p>
<p>'Then it becomes clear, I think, that Sir Thomas was never
murdered at all.'</p>
<p>'The depositions are plain. And these rogues assert that they
were acting upon the orders of Lady Somerset, and my Lord
Northampton.'</p>
<p>'To shield themselves it is natural they should name persons of
great rank.'</p>
<p>'Yet Payton brings you in to show a motive; and Lawrence Davies
speaks to a powder you sent Sir Thomas, which made him extremely
sick.'</p>
<p>'A powder I sent him three months before he died. Can it be
pretended that he died of that?'</p>
<p>Again the King stroked his beard. The short, reddish hairs upon
his hand glinted in a shaft of sunlight that at the same time
revealed his ghastly pallor. The Earl observed that the hand shook
a little.</p>
<p>'Well, well,' said his majesty at length. 'These are matters for
Coke. Maybe ye'll persuade him by such arguments. I perceive their
logic.'</p>
<p>'Your majesty still considers that I must go before Coke?'</p>
<p>The very suggestion of disobeying the summons of the Lord Chief
Justice seemed to startle the King more deeply than formerly.</p>
<p>'Ud's death, man! What else? Have I not said that if Coke sends
for me even I must go!'</p>
<p>'Very well,' said his lordship quietly, for all that his
countenance grew overcast. 'Then I shall see to it that Coke
pursues to its end this matter of the apothecary's boy.'</p>
<p>The King sucked in his breath. 'Ye would be best advised to
leave the line of inquiry to Coke himself. That line must follow
the trail that's been started by the Lieutenant.'</p>
<p>He spoke with the quiet impressiveness of a man who conveys more
than the literal meaning of his words. 'Any other line must lead to
your destruction, Robin, and, as God's my life, I do not desire
that. I love you over-well to desire your hurt.' Still more
impressive grew the tone. 'So be discreet and place your trust in
me, and whatever the lawyers make of it, no harm shall come to you
or to your lady.' He set his hands on the table and heaved himself
up, thrusting back his chair.</p>
<p>For a moment the King and the Earl stood facing each other, the
latter a little wild of eye. It had been in his mind to interrupt
the King with a vehement threat of what he would do, of how he
would drag the truth into the light if he were unduly pressed,
insisting upon the examination of Mayerne, and by means of it
establishing the fact that side by side with the aborted plot which
his unfortunate countess had set on foot, had run another
instigated by the King, which had succeeded. In his wrath and
resentment at the treachery of James, at his employment of old
methods for providing scapegoats for his royal dignity, Somerset
had been on the point of threatening a complete exposure which
should place the brand of Cain upon the King.</p>
<p>Betimes, however, he had checked. 'Whatever the lawyers make of
it, no harm shall come to you or to your lady.' That was the
promise that had given him pause. Could he trust it? Swiftly his
mind balanced the question. He thought of Frances and of the unborn
child she carried. If he did not accept this compromise, those two
would be destroyed together with himself.</p>
<p>'Come, now, Rabbie.' His majesty spoke gently in the old
fatherly tone, addressing him by the old intimate diminutive of his
name. 'Come. You shall dine with me, and afterwards away to Coke in
London.'</p>
<p>When the King entered the dining-room leaning upon Somerset's
stalwart shoulder fondly as of old, there was consternation almost
among the gentlemen who waited there, who for some days now had
confidently been pronouncing that his lordship's star had
definitely set.</p>
<p>Throughout the meal the King glozed an abiding nervousness with
jocularity. He pledged his dear Rabbie, and drank deep, so that
even Sir George Villiers grew thoughtful and uneasy.</p>
<p>When dinner was done, and it was announced that my Lord of
Somerset's coach was waiting, it was the King himself who escorted
him to it, hanging an arm round his neck as he went with him, and
slobbering kisses on his cheek.</p>
<p>'For God's sake, when shall I see thee again? On my soul I shall
neither eat nor sleep until I see thee again. When shall it be,
Rabbie?'</p>
<p>His bewildered lordship answered that he counted upon returning
on Monday.</p>
<p>'Shall I? Shall I? For God's sake, let it be Monday.'</p>
<p>Still lolling about his neck, the King went down the stairs with
him, and at the stairs' foot detained him again and again, reaching
up to slobber his cheek.</p>
<p>'For God's sake, give thy lady this kiss for me,' he cried, and
then, lowering his voice so that only Somerset should hear his
words: 'Set your trust in me, Rabbie, and whatever may seem, be
sure no harm shall come to your lady or yourself.'</p>
<p>Somerset bent his knee, and kissed the royal hand in
leave-taking, then went briskly out and stepped into his waiting
coach.</p>
<p>The King, following him with his watery eyes, waved to him from
where he stood at the stairs' foot. Then, as the coach rolled away,
unless the gentleman standing at the royal elbow who overheard him
was a liar, the whole expression of his face was seen to alter, and
with narrowing glance he muttered thickly:</p>
<p>'Now the Devil go with you, for I shall never see your face
again.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER
XXXII</h2>
<h3>PRELUDE</h3>
<p>If, as it seemed to him, policy or the needs of kingcraft drove
King James at times into illegal courses, into violations of the
law of which he was the custodian, into, in short, acts which must
be accounted criminal, yet he usually knew how to cover up his
tracks by a further abuse of his kingly powers, and so to dispose
that no definite accusation could be sustained against him. More
than once in his career he was driven the lengths of providing a
scapegoat upon whom he could fasten the imprudence or the crime of
which he had himself been guilty, and in such a course when it
became necessary no scruple appears to have deterred him. For
whilst the woman in him shrank from contact with violence or
cruelty, yet he would never boggle at the ruthlessness of a deed
which he was not called upon to witness.</p>
<p>An instance of this is provided by the affair at Gowrie House,
in which young Ruthven and the Earl of Gowrie were coldly
butchered, an affair the truth of which will never be known, but
which certainly does not lie in the mass of falsehood provided by
the King's own account of a conspiracy against his life. Another
instance is possibly provided by the murder of the Earl of Murray,
which many believed to have been done at the King's instigation,
although Huntley, whose actual hands shed the blood, bore the
public blame of it and was by James imprisoned for the deed. Yet a
third instance is supplied by the case of Lord Balmerino. When an
imprudent letter of James Stuart's to the Pope was brought to
light, in which the Protestant monarch was found to have been
coquetting with his holiness with a view to obtaining papal support
for his claims to the crown of England, his majesty took refuge in
denouncing the letter for a forgery. He accused his secretary
Elphinstone, who was afterwards Lord Balmerino, of having forged
his signature, flung him into prison for the crime, and actually
went the lengths of having him sentenced to death, although
afterwards, in the exercise of the royal prerogative of clemency,
he pardoned him.</p>
<p>My Lord of Somerset, who knew as much of these and other similar
matters as any man alive, had leisure to reflect upon them as he
rolled through Hertfordshire in his clumsy coach, and to perceive
quite clearly that, in this matter of Sir Thomas Overbury, King
James was playing the same game.</p>
<p>It was quite clear from the evidence assembled by Coke that
there had been a plot against the life of Sir Thomas Overbury. This
plot had failed. But notwithstanding its failure it could be turned
to such account as to provide definitely and conclusively against
any accusation ever being levelled at the King. Undoubtedly several
persons would be tried, convicted, and executed for a murder which
they had not committed. But that need not trouble the royal
conscience, since those persons were undoubtedly guilty in intent;
they had certainly conspired to kill Sir Thomas, and if they had
not succeeded this had been due to an accidental intervention which
nowise reduced their guilt. They were scoundrels all, and the world
would be well rid of them in any case.</p>
<p>All this was clear to my Lord of Somerset, and because of it and
of the King's parting assurance to him, he rode to London in some
confidence that no more than a formal examination awaited him, that
his denials would be accepted by Coke, and that he would be back at
Royston by Monday as he had promised.</p>
<p>The future, it is true, looked dark. His position hereafter
would be increasingly difficult, and the ghost of Overbury must
ever stand between himself and Frances. Out of his abiding pity, to
which her approaching motherhood may have contributed, he sought to
be just; to be more than just; to practise clemency in his
judgment. He compelled himself to remember that she had sinned for
love of him; that it was as much to ensure his happiness as her own
that she had stooped to those abominable practices and enlisted the
services of those vile creatures who would now betray her. But his
conception of her had changed. His lover's fancy had exalted her
into a holy thing to which he had given worship. Now the veils were
rent and his goddess stood revealed as basely human. Still, he must
do what he could to protect her. He must reveal to her the shield
which they possessed in his knowledge of the King's guilt. When he
should have shown her that however Overbury had died, it had not
been as a result of any measures she might have taken against him,
she would find strength to deny and to persist in denial.</p>
<p>After all, against her there was nothing but the word of
discredited rogues who could not but be proved liars in the course
of the examinations. It was true that there were some dreadful
letters which she had written Forman. But these had no bearing upon
the case of Sir Thomas Overbury nor concerned anything that might
have been meditated against him.</p>
<p>His lordship was anxious to reach London and to have done with
his business with Coke, so that being free to return he might seek
her at once and instruct her in the bearing she must assume in any
examination to which she might be subjected.</p>
<p>His confidence reviving thus, he came to London, to have it all
shattered again almost in the hour of his arrival. At his sumptuous
lodging near the cock-pit he found an officer awaiting him, and a
letter signed by the four members of the commission, in which they
professed themselves his lordship's very loving friends, but
required him in his majesty's name to keep his chamber without
suffering the access of any to him other than his own necessary
servants until his majesty's pleasure should be further known.</p>
<p>Somerset, having read the letter of his 'very loving friends,'
let it flutter from his nerveless fingers. He sat down heavily and
took his head in his hands. His thoughts were with the King, who
but yesterday had been slobbering his cheeks with kisses and
protesting in maudlin accents that he would neither eat nor sleep
until Robin should return. And all the while the King knew that
Somerset went to arrest, to be detained in isolation from all until
'his majesty's pleasure be further known.'</p>
<p>He heard again the King's thick, slurring voice: 'For God's
sake, give thy lady this kiss for me.'</p>
<p>The kiss of Judas, the kiss of betrayal, it had been. James had
flung him naked to his enemies to be destroyed. And then through
the bitterness of his resentment, through the fierce resolve that
James should yet come to repent this unspeakable falsity, the
memory of his own betrayal of Overbury surged before him to turn
him ice-cold with horror and with the sense that he was but being
repaid in the coin which himself he had uttered.</p>
<p>Deceived by those smooth words and Judas kisses, he had walked
into the trap without ever a chance to communicate again with his
countess, to warn her and school her as he had been determining.
And now it was certain that no chance would be afforded them of
communicating with each other until separately or jointly they were
brought before Coke and the others for examination.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Countess of Somerset was also virtually under
arrest by order of Coke and his fellow commissioners. She had been
brought to town at about the same time that the Earl had come
thither, and she was placed in the care of Sir William Smythe in
Lord Aubigny's house in the Blackfriars. She had come attended as
befitted her rank by six women and several menservants; but of
these only two of the former were suffered to remain with her and
every precaution was taken to prevent her communicating with the
outside world.</p>
<p>She bore this with the stoicism which follows upon the cessation
of all hope. She had played her desperate game, made her desperate
throw for happiness, and she had lost. Of that she was now fully
assured. It was not a matter that depended upon the issue of any
trial that might lie in store for her. It was not for life that she
had played; but for Robin's love without which life was of little
account. And whether she lived or died, Robin's love was
irrevocably lost to her. His worship of her had been for that ideal
of womanhood which she had incarnated for him. This ideal she had
befouled and destroyed in her very endeavours to preserve it for
him. Could irony go further?</p>
<p>It was not only that her hands were imbrued with Overbury's
blood, but that all her body, her very spirit, was defiled by the
necromantic practices to which she had lent herself and by the evil
associations which she had made her own. In his eyes she was
leprous. She had seen that plainly enough in his face on that
dreadful night at Henley, before it had been momentarily effaced by
the gust of pity which had shaken him, a pity whose memory, now
that it was fully understood, set her shuddering. Better would it
have been, she thought, had he reviled and beaten her.</p>
<p>It was finished. The game was played. Love, its greatest
forfeit, had been lost. The sooner life followed, the sooner
oblivion came, the better now. And in the time of waiting, it but
remained to bear herself with such fortitude as she could command
and such dignity as she could counterfeit, for of real dignity no
rag was left her. She was as one exposed naked to the public
gaze.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Earl of Somerset wrote passionate letters to the
King protesting against his betrayal and full of covert threats of
what he must disclose if the betrayal were pushed too far. One
letter the King wrote him in answer, a letter obviously composed
for publication, wherein his majesty protested that he would do his
duty honestly and not tamper with justice.</p>
<p>That justice lost no time in getting to work. On the 19th of
October at the Guildhall began the Great Oyer of Poisoning, as Coke
described it, with the trial of Richard Weston.</p>
<p>Thus, at the very outset the dishonesty of the proceedings is
apparent. Weston was an accessory. Both on his own evidence and
that of Sir Gervase Elwes, besides the confession of the
apothecary's boy in Flushing, Sir Thomas Overbury had died
following upon an injection prepared by Loubel. Therefore Loubel
was the principal, and only after Loubel's conviction of the murder
could the field have been extended to include Weston and the
others. But Loubel was tried neither then nor subsequently, a
circumstance regarded by many as the most mysterious part of what
is known as the Overbury Mystery, whereas, in fact, it is the clue
to it. Nor was the evidence of the coroner put in, so that there
was no real preliminary formal proof that Overbury had been
poisoned at all.</p>
<p>The indictment against Weston alleged four several attempts to
poison Sir Thomas. One on the 9th of May, 1613, when rosalgar was
said to have been used; another on the 1st of July by means of
white arsenic; and a third on the 19th of July by mercury sublimate
contained in some tarts and jellies sent in to the prisoner.
Finally, on the 14th of September of that same year, Weston, it was
charged, in conjunction with another man had administered an
injection of corrosive sublimate to which Sir Thomas had
succumbed.</p>
<p>Coke, acting as judge and prosecuting counsel in one, secured a
verdict of guilty from the jury, and the unfortunate Weston was
hanged at Tyburn two days after sentence.</p>
<p>In the first week of November, Anne Turner was brought to trial.
The charge against her was of comforting, aiding, and abetting
Weston, who was no longer there to answer anything he might in
reason have been asked. Terrified, the frail little widow pleaded
not guilty.</p>
<p>Coke from the bench bespattered her with some ordures of speech
by way of shortening the work in hand and helping the jury to an
opinion about her. He dubbed her whore and bawd and witch and
Papist and several other things, thereby reducing the dainty,
golden-headed creature to an outburst of passionate weeping.</p>
<p>The charge was established by the production of letters which
had passed between the Countess of Essex and Simon Forman, and of
some of the puppets in wax and lead which had been prepared for
purposes of enchantments. Mrs. Turner had obtained possession of
these on the death of Forman, but she had neglected to destroy
them. The constable had found them in her house, and they
effectively set the rope about her pretty, delicate neck.</p>
<p>She made her last appearance at Tyburn, dressed with the modish
care which had ever distinguished her, and wearing the ruffs and
cuffs starched in yellow which she had rendered so fashionable, but
which thereafter were never to be seen again.</p>
<p>The next victim, on the charge of being an accessory, was the
unfortunate Sir Gervase Elwes, but for whom no word of all this
business might ever have been divulged. He defended himself
vigorously, skilfully, and manfully, and must by his grave
appearance and demeanour have commanded some respect and
compassion. But he was foredoomed by the ruthless Coke, and was
destroyed upon a lying assertion by Franklin that he was in league
with the Countess. Although it must have been clear that, if any of
what was alleged against him had been true, Overbury's poisoning
would never have taken five months to accomplish, he was sentenced
and hanged. Because he had been Lieutenant of the Tower, he was
executed on Tower Hill, as being a place less infamous than
Tyburn.</p>
<p>After Elwes came Franklin, the doctor and warlock, who, in some
mad hope to save himself, had suggested in his examinations that he
could incriminate half the kingdom, and this, not only for the
poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury, but for many other mysterious
deaths beginning with that of Prince Henry. He lied recklessly and
fantastically. He is comparable only with a squid which throws out
an inky cloud in the hope of being himself lost in it to the view
of his pursuers. It was in the course of his wildest lies that the
Earl was for the first time seriously mentioned as having any
direct connection with the fact of poisoning. The falsehood of his
depositions was rendered obvious by their own glaring
inconsistencies. He delayed his fate by asserting even after
sentence that he had still more to reveal, and he would have
continued these revelations to the end of his natural life had not
even Coke grown weary of his fabrications and cut them short by
dismissing him to the gallows.</p>
<p>In the first days of December, Sir Thomas Monson was brought to
trial. His guilt lay in having procured Sir Gervase Elwes to be
Lieutenant of the Tower in place of Sir William Wade. This was
assumed to be something done in order to pave the way for the
murder. He bore himself arrogantly and contemptuously before the
Court, and eventually he was put back in order that he might be a
witness against the Countess. Nor was he ever brought to trial
again.</p>
<p>There ended the prelude to the Grand Oyer of Poisoning. The
drama itself was to follow some six months later, sumptuously
staged in Westminster Hall. Meanwhile, out of all that had gone,
and out of the unfortunate wretches who had been hanged, enough
material had been squeezed, as evidence was then understood, to
serve for the destruction of the Earl and Countess of Somerset by
men who were determined to destroy them.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER
XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE AMBASSADOR</h3>
<p>In the early days of December of that dreadful year, the young
Countess in her duress in the house in Blackfriars was joylessly
delivered of a daughter.</p>
<p>She had vowed that she would not survive the event; she had even
taken steps to destroy herself, together with the child before its
birth; but in this she had been frustrated by those who watched
over her. The King, being informed of her intentions and attempts,
had with a kindness that was almost cruel sent physicians to take
charge of her and nurses to watch over her constantly so that she
might be preserved for all the suffering that awaited her.</p>
<p>She may have spared some of her pity for herself to bestow it
upon the infant at her breast. No joy bells announced its advent;
there was no pompous christening graced by royalty for the
offspring of a daughter of the great House of Howard and the wife
of one who had been First Minister of State and the greatest man in
England.</p>
<p>In March she was conveyed to the Tower, and given the lodging
which Sir Walter Raleigh had lately quitted to sail upon the
disastrous El Dorado adventure. Her babe was delivered into the
care of the Countess of Suffolk and taken to Audley End, where the
Lord Treasurer's lady was in residence during those unhappy
days.</p>
<p>As for Somerset, he had already preceded his wife to the Tower,
where, however, they were still not suffered to communicate with
each other.</p>
<p>The Earl now perceived quite clearly that, in spite of his
letters to the King, it was not only the intention to bring him to
trial, to arraign him like a criminal before men who in the past
had gone in awe of him, but that the issue of that trial was
foregone. Already he had been stripped of his great offices of
State. The privy seals had gone to the Earl of Worcester; the Lord
Chamberlain's wand of office was grasped at last by the Earl of
Pembroke. Soon, he supposed, they would be parcelling out his lands
and possessions, and out of them, no doubt, the upstart Villiers
would be richly endowed.</p>
<p>He writhed in justifiable anger, and took oath that he would
never submit to be so tamely broken. Then he curbed himself, and
wrote again to the King. This time, however, he did not rave and
threaten wildly. He sent a precise, cold, and closely reasoned
statement which so fastened the guilt of Overbury's murder upon the
King that if it were publicly made it could not be suffered to
remain unanswered. And publicly made it should be, Somerset warned
his Majesty, if he or his countess were brought to trial for a
crime which no one knew better than the King that neither of them
had committed, and which Somerset himself had never
contemplated.</p>
<p>Nor did he leave the matter there. So that the King should see
that he fully intended what he threatened and that means of
publication were not lacking, he uttered to Sir George More threats
of what he could and would do, knowing full well that Sir George
would perform his duty and report these words to the King. Without
being explicit to the Lieutenant, he announced the intention of
laying an aspersion on his Majesty of being an accessory to the
murder.</p>
<p>To Sir George the King replied that this was no more than a
trick of Somerset's idle brain, by which he hoped to shift the
trial. Under that airy answer he dissembled the panic into which
the letter had flung him. Somerset had revealed quite clearly how
completely he held the King, what dreadful havoc he could make if
in open court he were to repeat the statement he had set down, and
demand the examination of Mayerne, who had prescribed, and of
Loubel, who had administered the poisoned injection. It was a
demand that could not be refused once the accusation were lodged;
for to refuse it would be an admission of fear which could have but
one interpretation. The evidence upon which Weston had been hanged
had already established that it was the injection, which being
poisoned, had ended Sir Thomas Overbury's days. This was a blunder
of Coke's for which the King in his present rage and terror could
cheerfully have strangled the Lord Chief Justice. It was a blunder
of which Somerset's exposition took the fullest account. Loubel,
being examined, must shelter himself behind Mayerne; and Mayerne,
when his turn came, must betray the King to save his own neck.</p>
<p>And what should King James look like in the eyes of the nation
if the truth were told at this stage? He would stand revealed not
merely as a murderer, but as a murderer on so ruthless and infamous
a scale that to screen himself he had already allowed four persons,
however venal, to suffer death unjustly for a crime of his own, and
was seeking to add two victims more.</p>
<p>He was panic-stricken at the perception of the situation into
which Somerset showed that he could thrust him. The chink which he
had always known to exist in his armour gaped wider than he had
supposed possible, and the wound which Somerset threatened to deal
him through it was one which it might be impossible to staunch
before his Majesty was bled white of credit and reputation. On the
other hand, so much had already been alleged against Somerset by
those who were eager to implicate him, Coke had been so liberal in
the course of the preliminary trials in assertions of his
lordship's guilt, of which he said that the proofs were pregnant
against him, that if King James now intervened, it would be said
that he had hushed up the scandal to save the arch-offender after
the lesser ones had suffered.</p>
<p>In this horrible quandary, his majesty finally resolved to send
Lord Hay as his plenipotentiary, not only to Somerset, but to the
Countess as well.</p>
<p>The splendid courtier, who had so often and so brilliantly
represented his prince at foreign courts, had possibly never
undertaken a more delicate embassage or one in whose inmost
particulars he was less instructed.</p>
<p>He landed at Tower Wharf on a brilliant morning of May, when the
scent of lilac was strong upon the tepid air, and having presented
his credentials to the Lieutenant was straightway conducted to her
ladyship.</p>
<p>In that lodging which had been Sir Walter Raleigh's, with the
furnishings which had served that bright adventurer and even some
of his books and effects about her, she sat, pale and listless, a
neglected volume of poems in her lap. She had wasted a little
during her confinement, and there was something now almost ethereal
and unearthly about her delicate beauty. She was dressed with great
care, but in black, which threw into greater relief the snowy
whiteness of her skin and the bright gold of the heavy clumps of
hair protruding on either side of the braided coif with which her
head was covered.</p>
<p>She rose at sight of the great courtier disclosed to her by the
opening of the heavy oaken door, and her faithful woman Catharine,
who was at her needlework by the window, rose with her.</p>
<p>Lord Hay came quickly forward, scattering the rushes on the
floor in his haste to have her resume her seat. Hat in hand, he
bowed low over the hand she extended mechanically in greeting, and
brushed it with his lips.</p>
<p>The action almost surprised her. It brought tears to her eyes,
and a warmth surged in her heart for this gallant gentleman to whom
a woman's hand was still a woman's hand, even though stained as
hers must be accounted stained.</p>
<p>She looked into his bold, handsome face, and as memories arose
she wondered whether he who had been Robin's first friend was
destined now to be his last. She knew that there had been
differences between them; that for a time Lord Hay, entirely
devoted to French interests, had been hostile to Robin when he had
seemed to favour Spain. It was possible even that there might be
resentments of the great eminence to which the royal favour had
hoisted one who had first made his appearance before King James as
a simple esquire in the train of Sir James Hay, as he then had
been. How well she remembered that scene ten years ago in the
tilt-yard at Whitehall. And how much had happened in the time that
was sped. Lord Hay had aged considerably since that day when he
himself had been one of the favourites of a King who loved handsome
men. Yet because he had never climbed to such vertiginous heights
as Robin, he had been able to maintain his foothold in
security.</p>
<p>His lordship, with head deferentially inclined, announced
himself a messenger from the King and requested to be private with
her.</p>
<p>She dismissed her woman to the outer room, and resumed her
armchair. To stand immediately before her, his lordship turned his
back to the window and the light.</p>
<p>'I bring your ladyship a message of hope,' he announced.</p>
<p>'Of hope?' she echoed, and the sadness of her smile cut him more
sharply than any tears.</p>
<p>He had been of those who had voiced the spreading execration of
this woman stained with such guilt as had been brought to light by
the confessions of scoundrels who had already suffered for a crime
of which she must be supposed the instigator. But in her presence
now, her beauty, her pallor, her wistfulness, the physical frailty
of her worn body brought him to weigh the temptation she had
suffered against the sin she had committed, and he cast out every
thought but that of pity.</p>
<p>'The hope of royal clemency,' he explained.</p>
<p>'The only clemency I crave,' she answered him, 'is to pass
swiftly out from ... all this, before I come to the terrible ordeal
of my trial.'</p>
<p>'That ordeal you may sensibly lessen by your own act, my lady.
If you will confess, the trial, instead of being a minute and close
examination into your errors, will become little more than a
formality. You must submit to sentence; but that sentence will
never be carried out. I bring you his majesty's assurance of this,
provided that you will confess your guilt.'</p>
<p>'Confess?' she echoed.</p>
<p>He thought she questioned the necessity, still clinging to hope
that she might defeat her accusers and make it appear that the
evidence against her was insufficient. To dispel that imagined hope
he briefly recited what had been betrayed by Weston, by Turner, and
by Franklin, showing how their evidence was intercorroborated. She
displayed little interest until he mentioned Sir David Wood, and
told her how that gentleman had come forward to bear witness that
once she had sought to hire him to kill Overbury. She raised her
eyes at this, and looked at him, a smile of scornful pity on her
lips.</p>
<p>'Even he!' she exclaimed, and slowly shook her head. 'Those
other poor wretches I can understand. They hoped to save their
lives by putting the blame on me, where, indeed, it belongs.'</p>
<p>This was a generous admission, considering that, after all,
Turner had been the serpent who had tempted her to her
destruction.</p>
<p>'But Sir David! He was my uncle's man and owed him much. At one
time he professed to love me, and vowed himself for ever my
servant. Behold his service! It can nothing profit him to help to
break me, and yet he comes to add what he can to my load of shame.
But let be. It little signifies.'</p>
<p>'Except, madam, that it serves to complete the ring that has
been drawn about you. That is why I urge you in his majesty's name
to make a full confession, thereby disarming justice.'</p>
<p>She rose abruptly. Some colour kindled in her cheeks. She
appeared to be swept by a sudden passion.</p>
<p>'It would not occur to his majesty that this thing which I am
urged to do for clemency, I must already have decided to do for
love.'</p>
<p>'You mean, madam?'</p>
<p>'Mean, my lord? Is not my meaning plain? Must I give tongue to
the little virtue that is left me? Must I tell you, after all that
has befallen, that my love for Robin has been the lodestar of my
life? Evil has come of it, God knows. But do you think that it
could beget naught but evil? Do you not see that evil came because
evil was made a necessity to its fulfilment? Oh, my lord, in itself
my love was neither good nor evil. It was just love. The
overwhelming desire to possess and be possessed. It made use of
good or evil indiscriminately for its compelling needs. Where evil
alone would serve, it used evil perforce, as freely as now it must
use good, since through good alone can it continue to manifest
itself.'</p>
<p>She paused. My Lord Hay was a little bewildered by the passion
which lent her clarity and eloquence. Then more quietly she
continued.</p>
<p>'You may be wondering, my lord, what is all this to the matter.
You may tell his majesty that I shall confess fully and freely;
that already I had resolved upon this; but not out of any hope of
mercy; not to gain a single day of a life that must henceforth be
empty. I shall confess because, were I to deny, were I to attempt
to combat or disprove any of this that has been alleged against me,
I must endanger Robin, who is already suspect upon no better
grounds than that he is my husband. Those suspicions my confession
shall clear away. It shall be seen that my Robin had no part or
share in this, that no impeachment can be made against him. That is
why I shall confess, taking all the blame for this upon myself,
where it rightly belongs. It is all that I can now do. The only
amend, alas!'</p>
<p>She sat down again, wearily, folding her hands in her lap. His
lordship stood a moment looking at her, as if undecided. Then he
bowed from the waist, and in that attitude spoke his farewell.</p>
<p>'Madam, the resolve is as wise as it is deserving. I will
communicate it to his majesty. And I pray that you may yet be
spared for many years.'</p>
<p>'Ah, pray not that! Pray not that! Let it be clear to his
majesty that I have made no bargain. That I neither ask nor desire
mercy. That all that I can seek is rest when this last duty to
Robin shall have been fulfilled.'</p>
<p>His lordship departed in a mood blending compassion with
complacency. So far he had succeeded, and his royal master should
be well pleased with him. If only he could accomplish as much by my
Lord Somerset, the royal satisfaction should be complete.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant, who had waited, conducted him, by gloomy dank
passages, up one flight of stone steps and down another, to the
lodging of the Earl.</p>
<p>Somerset was writing busily when Lord Hay was ushered in upon
him, and the older man was shocked to perceive the change which a
few months had wrought in the prisoner's appearance. His beautiful
red-gold hair, which always had been so scrupulously combed and
frizzed, was lank and ill-kempt, and odd strands of grey had made
their appearance in it. His face was thin and pallid. Its bone
structures were thrown into prominence, filling with shadow the
hollows thus produced. His eyes, once so clear and commanding, were
dull, blood-injected, and sunken into his head. He was negligently
dressed, this man who once had been a mirror of the elegancies.
Wrapped in a purple quilted bedgown, his collar open at the throat,
his feet were thrust into slippers; and black silk stockings,
carelessly gartered, hung in creases about his calves.</p>
<p>As the door opened, he looked up, almost savagely. At sight of
Lord Hay, he rose, startled, and for a long moment remained staring
at the man who once had been his master, subsequently had been a
humble suitor for his patronage, more lately one of his enemies and
held now in the royal favour a position rendered the more assured
by Somerset's eclipse.</p>
<p>'My lord!' was all that he could ejaculate, a certain bitterness
rising in him.</p>
<p>Lord Hay bowed to him as deferentially as if he were still the
favourite and First Minister of State. He moved forward. But as
Somerset did not stir to meet him or make shift to proffer his
hand, the royal messenger contented himself with bowing again.</p>
<p>Sir George More closed the door and effaced himself to wait
beyond it.</p>
<p>'I am from the King,' Lord Hay announced, and plunged
straightway into the business. 'I am to tell you, Robin, that his
majesty deeply resents the threat in your letter to make him in
some sort accessory to your crime.'</p>
<p>'My crime!' Somerset's face was convulsed with anger. 'My
crime!' he repeated. 'He's determined then to father it upon me?
Well, well! We shall see. His majesty's resentment shall go deeper
yet when I make it clear that I am being used by him as a scapegoat
for a deed that is his own. Tell him from me, as I shall tell their
lordships if I am brought to trial, that I am neither Balmerino nor
the Earl of Gowrie. That if he wants my silence he may send
Haddington to murder me as he murdered Gowrie. But that short of
that, if he insists upon dragging me to Westminster Hall, I shall
not be silent upon what I know, nor will I consent to wear the
mantle of his infamy.'</p>
<p>'My lord, my lord!' Hay became formal again in his remonstrance.
'These are wild, mad words!'</p>
<p>'The country shall judge their madness if I am brought to
trial.'</p>
<p>'And mad the country will judge them. If you are guilty of so
infamous an attempt to shift the blame, you will seal your own doom
irrevocably.'</p>
<p>'To shift the blame, does he dare to say? I shall not seek to
shift it; but to nail it down where it belongs.'</p>
<p>'Where it belongs?' Hay stood stiff and straight and calm as he
looked into the wild eyes of Somerset. He frowned a little. 'Robin,
you delude yourself, indeed, if you dream that such measures can
avail you, that they can produce any effect upon your judges or the
country, or that you can intimidate his majesty by such threats.
The burden of evidence is too heavy against you.'</p>
<p>'Evidence! What evidence can there be since I am innocent?' His
lordship's fury vibrated in his voice. 'I had no hand in the murder
of Tom Overbury, as none knows better than the King. All the world
shall know where the blame lies before I've done, if either I or my
countess be brought to trial.'</p>
<p>Lord Hay nodded grimly. 'That is true enough. The world shall
know it upon the word of her ladyship herself; indeed, upon her
confession that she contrived the deed. Against that, what shall
your threats avail, how shall the scandals you will attempt to
raise ever touch the King?'</p>
<p>Somerset stood suddenly calmed. The high colour which
indignation had whipped into his cheeks receded, leaving them paler
than they had been before. He sat down heavily at the deal table
which was strewn with his papers, quills, and inkhorn, the table by
which Lord Hay was standing.</p>
<p>'She confesses!' He spoke hoarsely, scarcely above a
whisper.</p>
<p>Here was a factor he had left out of his calculations; stupidly,
as he now perceived. In the light of her confession, what, indeed,
could it avail him to speak to the King's guilt? Since there was
one who confessed to the crime, what could it avail to seek to
fasten it on another? She should have entrenched herself in denial;
denounced those wretches, who had been bullied and tormented into
self-accusation, for liars when they sought to implicate her in
their guilt. The rest she could have left to him and the tale he
could tell which must have made the whole thing look like a base
conspiracy against them. So long as she maintained that attitude,
the King would never dare bring them to trial, aware of the
mischief Somerset could do.</p>
<p>But since she confessed, she destroyed them both. Against that
confession there was no battling, as Lord Hay now warned him. Yet
still he resisted. 'If she confesses, she confesses to something
that is not true, although she may believe it true.'</p>
<p>'Could any man persuade their lordships of that?' said Hay
gently.</p>
<p>Somerset ignored the question. 'Yet even though she confess,
that confession cannot include me.'</p>
<p>'It must, my lord. By implication. Her motive was common to you
both. Their lordships will not be slow to perceive that. The
commission, my lord, had perceived it already, and that perception
alone sufficed them as a reason for placing you under
restraint.'</p>
<p>Somerset rose again, grumbling in his throat, and paced away to
the barred window, dragging his loose-shod feet. He stood staring
out a moment; then swung round and came slowly back.</p>
<p>'And so,' he said bitterly, 'the King thinks to have my head
under his girdle?'</p>
<p>'The King,' Lord Hay replied in a tone of reproof, 'desires to
assure you of his continued affection, and desires you to make it
possible to show you mercy.'</p>
<p>'Mercy for what?'</p>
<p>'For the crime with which you are charged.'</p>
<p>'I thank you, my lord, for not saying the crime which I have
committed. And as I have committed no crime, I desire no mercy. I
desire only that my innocence may appear. I shall defend my honour
to my last breath, and in spite of all the traps and snares that
may be laid for me. Tell the King that. Tell him, as I said at the
beginning, that I am neither Gowrie nor Balmerino.'</p>
<p>Lord Hay shook his fine head. 'I should not be your friend if I
bore that message.'</p>
<p>Lord Somerset smote the table with his open palm. 'You will not
be my friend if you do not.' With a touch of his old haughtiness he
added: 'There is no more to say, my lord.'</p>
<p>Lord Hay accepted the dismissal. He gathered his satin
cape-cloak about him and resumed his hat. 'At the moment perhaps
not, my lord. But you will reflect upon what I have said. You will
remember that you hold the key to the gates of royal mercy. It is
for you, my lord, to determine whether you will employ it. God
light you to a wise decision.'</p>
<p>'God cannot wish me to destroy my honour,' was the Earl's last
word.</p>
<p>They bowed to each other, and Lord Hay went out.</p>
<p>Alone, Somerset sat down again, folded his arms upon the table,
and laid his head upon them with a groan. He was tasting, he knew,
the bitterness that had been Overbury's when Overbury was trapped
in that same prison even as he. Like Overbury he was fighting for
his life and liberty by threats of the havoc he could wreak by his
disclosures. He was punished, indeed, poetically, for his betrayal
of his friend.</p>

XXXIV</h2>
<h3>THE MERCY OF KING JAMES</h3>
<p>After many delays and postponements, the true cause for which
must be sought in the conscience of the King and the fears that
sprang from it, the Countess of Somerset was brought to trial on a
Friday, towards the end of May.</p>
<p>Betimes she was conducted by the Lieutenant from the gloom of
her prison into the brilliance of that May morning and the dazzling
sunshine which glinted upon the corselets and headpieces of her
escort and upon the terrible axe which the headsman carried before
her with averted edge.</p>
<p>She had dressed herself with care and thought for the dread part
she was to play in the thronged theatre of Westminster Hall. She
wore a gown of black tammil, relieved at throat and wrists by cuffs
and ruff of cobweb lawn, and on her head a chaperon of cypress
cr&ecirc;pe. The funereal raiment but served to render her white
beauty the more startling.</p>
<p>With Catharine, her faithful woman, following, she embarked in
the Lieutenant's barge, and with the tide at half-flow she arrived
in less than an hour at Westminster Steps, where pikemen kept the
curious crowd in check.</p>
<p>Within the vast hall, which since six o'clock that morning had
been packed to suffocation by the nobles and gentry who could
afford to pay the high prices demanded for so rare a show, a stage
had been erected for the peers who were to sit in judgment. They
entered in procession, twenty-two of them in their robes, in the
wake of the feeble Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, who filled the post
of Lord High Steward, and followed by the Lord Chief Justice and
seven judges in scarlet.</p>
<p>The Lord High Steward, moving slowly and preceded by the bearers
of his white staff, his patent, and his seal, and six
sergeants-at-arms shouldering their maces, took his place under the
scarlet cloth of estate, bowed to the assembly and sat down. Their
lordships covering themselves sank with a rustle to their seats on
either side of him; more noisily the great crowd settled down again
in the sweltering heat of that May morning, and on the ensuing
stillness beat the droning voice of the Clerk of Arraigns. Then
came a fresh stir as the Countess, followed ever by her woman, was
conducted by the Lieutenant of the Tower to the bar. Her pallor was
deathlike, but her feet did not falter. With lowered eyes she took
her place before their lordships, and spread her fan, so as to
conceal the half of her countenance from those cruelly inquisitive,
probing glances.</p>
<p>The voice of the Clerk of Arraigns ran challengingly, like a
trumpet-call.</p>
<p>'Frances, Countess of Somerset, hold up thy hand!'</p>
<p>She obeyed, being compelled for this to put aside her fan, and
stood so whilst the indictment was read to her, tears flowing down
a face which might have been carved of marble, so white and rigid
did it remain.</p>
<p>At the end of it came the question: 'Frances, Countess of
Somerset, how sayest thou? Art thou guilty of this felony and
murder, or not guilty?'</p>
<p>She paused a moment in the deathly stillness all about her,
swaying a little before she answered with the single word which
surely must deliver her Robin of all peril. Although she spoke that
word low and fearfully, it was widely heard in the silence.</p>
<p>'Guilty.'</p>
<p>It may have occasioned disappointment, for it curtailed the
sport which those who had paid so extravagantly for their places
might have derived from the contest arising out of a defence.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Bacon, the Attorney-General, sleek and elegant, was
instantly on his feet, to charm the audience with his silken voice
and well-balanced periods, commending the course she had taken. He
had his orders from the King. She was to be dealt with leniently in
view of her confession, and no odious or uncivil speeches were to
be given.</p>
<p>It was not the supple Bacon's way to be odious or uncivil. Such
gifts as his do not need to employ bullyings and browbeatings, nor
was there any need for them here.</p>
<p>He stressed the fact that she was a spectacle of awe and
commiseration. He hinted in plain terms that the royal clemency
would follow. Meanwhile, however, he invited their lordships to
pass to the discharge of their duty.</p>
<p>'This lady,' he said, at one point in his graceful oration,
'meets justice in the way by confession, which is the corner-stone
either of mercy or judgment. It is said that mercy and truth be met
together. Truth you have in her confession, and that may be a
degree to mercy, which we must leave to him in whose power it
resides. In the mean time this day must be reserved for
judgment.'</p>
<p>At the end the Clerk of Arraigns demanded of her formally what
she could say why judgment of death should not be pronounced
against her.</p>
<p>What she replied was uttered in so low a voice that no more than
the sound of it was audible save to those immediately about her. Of
these it was Sir Francis Bacon who repeated the words after her to
Lord Ellesmere.</p>
<p>'I can much aggravate but nothing extenuate my fault ... I
desire mercy ... and that the lords will intercede for me with the
King.'</p>
<p>The frail old Chancellor, taking his white staff, delivered
judgment. He tempered it by an expression of the belief that, in
view of the humility and grief in which she had confessed, the King
would be moved to mercy, closing in the words prescribed.</p>
<p>'... That you shall be carried from hence to the Tower of
London, and from thence to the place of execution, where you are to
be hanged by the neck till you be dead. And the Lord have mercy
upon your soul.'</p>
<p>She staggered and swayed as if about to fall. To steady herself,
she clutched at the rail before her, and remained a moment clinging
to it, whilst her woman hastened to her at a sign from Sir George
More. Then, at another signal from the Lieutenant, the halberdiers
advanced, Sir George proffered her his hand, and thus led by him,
again preceded by the headsman, this time with the edge of the
gleaming axe towards her, she passed out of the hall under the gaze
of that great concourse, which included the short, sturdy figure of
the young Earl of Essex, who watched her with grim, sullen
eyes.</p>
<p>The crowd surged out into the sunshine to babble of the show and
of the greater show that was to follow on the morrow when the Earl
of Somerset should come there, not meekly to surrender, it was
said, as her ladyship had done, but fiercely to battle for his
life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, my Lord of Somerset was protesting
passionately that he would not go at all, and that if they carried
him there in his bed by main force he would stand mute and refuse
to plead. Such were the fierce assurances he gave Sir George More,
when the Lieutenant, on his return from Westminster Hall, went to
inform his lordship of how it had fared with the Countess.</p>
<p>Her confession created no fresh consternation in him. It did not
move him at all. He had been prepared for it, and he was not to
guess that she had been led to make it more for his sake than for
her own, induced by the assurance that it would earn leniency for
both of them.</p>
<p>He waved it now aside, as something done and irretrievable, but
something which did not touch him. His concern was entirely with
his own trial upon the morrow, for which he was desired to prepare
himself. He would not prepare himself, he announced to Sir George
More, because he would not be required to go; because the King
dared not bring him to trial.</p>
<p>'These are grave words to use of his majesty, my lord,' Sir
George reproved him.</p>
<p>'They are. And there are grave facts behind them. I have sent
him word already that I am neither Gowrie nor Balmerino. He'll have
read my meaning. He will know what to expect. He will understand
that I do not mean to provide a holiday for my enemies, to be
gloated over in Westminster Hall by those who for years have fawned
upon me for my patronage. If he dreams that he can doom me to that
and himself escape the punishment of this dastardly betrayal, he's
more of a fool than I've ever deemed him. But he dare not do it,
Sir Lieutenant. He dare not do it.'</p>
<p>Sir George withdrew again more troubled than ever; and he was
almost relieved when there came to him a command to wait upon the
King at Greenwich.</p>
<p>Sir George found the King abed, a very scared and shivering
monarch, who fearfully desired to know if my Lord Somerset had
decided to confess. When he had heard the Lieutenant's tale, he
mouthed and slobbered fearfully, and finally gave way to tears,
rocking himself like a distracted fishwife upon his great bed.</p>
<p>'What's to be done with him, Sir George? What's to be done with
him?'</p>
<p>Sir George, standing stiff and bewildered before the agitated
King, announced himself ready to do whatever his majesty
commanded.</p>
<p>'Have ye made it clear to him that it is not my intention he
shall suffer any harm to life? That if he will confess this thing,
of which Coke says the proof against him is pregnant, he may be
sure that my mercy will defeat the sentence?'</p>
<p>'His answer to that, Sire, is that he is neither Balmerino nor
Gowrie, whatever that may mean. I was to say so, your majesty.'</p>
<p>The royal mouth fell open. The royal cheeks were ashen. The
protruding royal eyes rolled fearfully in their sockets. 'God's
sake!' he gurgled. 'God's sake!' His majesty flung back the
bedclothes, and slewed himself round to face the Lieutenant more
squarely, his thin naked legs dangling above the floor. A look of
craft came now to harden that loose countenance. In Somerset's love
for his lady the King thought he perceived the move that would
checkmate him.</p>
<p>'It only remains,' he said, 'to let him perceive the opposite,
and perceive it plainly. Tell him from me that if he dares to utter
a single word that may bring me into contempt, he will seal, not
only his own doom, but that of his countess as well. Tell him that
I shall withdraw my mercy from them both, and that whatever betide
himself, his Countess shall hang in accordance with the sentence
passed upon her. Tell him that! Away with you now.'</p>
<p>The King peremptorily waved a dismissal, which he checked before
Sir George could begin to obey it. 'No, no. Stay!' He considered a
moment, combing his beard and audibly sucking in his breath. 'One
other thing, Sir George. At his trial to-morrow let him be attended
by two men with cloaks ready to muffle him at the first word he may
utter that does not directly bear upon the charge against him. If
he should mention me, or if he should attempt to broach any matter
connected with Loubel the apothecary, let a cloak be thrown over
his head. Let him be carried back to the Tower at once, and the
trial proceed in his absence.'</p>
<p>Sir George stood aghast. The Court would never permit such a
violation of its rights over the prisoner. But the King, reading
his alarm in his troubled countenance, reassured him.</p>
<p>'The Lord Chancellor shall have a line from me to prepare him in
case it should come to this. He will understand that reasons of
State require it, and none will interfere with you. Away with you
now to the Tower, and warn friend Somerset of what is prepared for
him, so that he may perceive the futility of attempting any such
treachery as he may have in mind.'</p>
<p>The flush of the May dawn was already in the sky when Sir
George, back in the Tower, conveyed his majesty's message to Lord
Somerset. His lordship set his teeth, and answered nothing. The
King had checkmated him. The threat to withhold mercy from himself
should he dare to execute his threat, he would have laughed to
scorn. But the threat to withdraw the promised clemency from the
Countess was another matter. The Countess had already confessed,
and upon her confession had been sentenced. She, therefore, lay
utterly at the King's mercy, and not all the influence of the
Howard family could suffice to rescue her.</p>
<p>Somerset could not deliver her to the hangman; therefore, he
must, whatever it might cost him in bitterness, abandon the line of
retaliatory attack upon which he was depending for his defence. In
spite of all that he had boasted, his must be the part of
Balmerino; to be silent as to where he knew the real blame to
lie.</p>
<p>Of this, however, he said nothing to the Lieutenant. Not yet
would he give Sir George the satisfaction of knowing him defeated
in his intentions. In other matters he did not yet accept defeat.
Since he was thus constrained to plead, he would make a stout fight
for his life and his honour. At least there should be no weak-kneed
confession from him of a crime which he had not committed.</p>
<p>Anon he rose and arrayed himself with all his old scrupulous
care in a rich suit of black from which the blue ribbon of his
George detached with startling brilliance, for deliberately he
donned his George and Garter as if to flaunt it in the faces of
those nobles who on a presumption of his guilt would already have
had his arms removed from the chapel at Windsor. His servant came
to dress his hair and trim his golden dagger beard, and at last, at
a little before nine, having broken his fast, he descended with the
Lieutenant to the waiting barge.</p>
<p>His pride sustaining him, he made his appearance in Westminster
Hall with the same outward assurance and arrogant demeanour which
he had worn in the privy gallery at Whitehall in the old days when
those two and twenty peers, assembled there to judge and if
possible convict him of infamy, had been wont to bend their backs
obsequiously before him.</p>
<p>On either side of him and a little behind him stood
unobtrusively those two yeomen of the guard, each with a cloak over
his arm, detailed to muffle him at a sign from the vigilant
Lieutenant. He paid no heed to them.</p>
<p>Summoned to plead, he pleaded 'Not guilty,' in a firm resonant
voice.</p>
<p>The Lord High Steward, in charging him to speak boldly in his
own defence, gave him the last hint of what was desired of him by
the King.</p>
<p>'Remember,' the old Chancellor admonished him, 'that God is the
God of truth. A fault defended is a double crime ... Take heed lest
your wilfulness cause the gates of mercy to be shut upon you.'</p>
<p>Sir Francis Bacon in his opening speech for the Crown promised
to carry the lantern of justice, which is evidence, before their
eyes upright. Nevertheless, all the evidence he had to offer
was&mdash;as he well knew&mdash;presumptive, and much of it
depended upon the confessions of rogues who had been hanged and
were no longer there to be questioned by Somerset. The
Attorney-General made much of the quarrel between Somerset and
Overbury, arising out of the latter's opposition to the love
between Somerset and that unfortunate lady the Countess of Essex as
she was then. This was urged as the motive for the crime. He
revealed the trap in which Overbury was taken and committed to the
Tower, and dwelt upon the appointment of Sir Gervase Elwes to the
Lieutenancy and the attachment to him of Richard Weston, which it
was now implied had been done for his own nefarious ends by my Lord
of Somerset. There was an allusion to her ladyship's attempt to
bribe Sir David Wood to kill Overbury. Then certain obscure letters
which had passed between Somerset and Northampton were put forward
and such meanings read into them as suited the purposes of the
prosecution.</p>
<p>When this formidable array of emptiness so far as his lordship
was concerned had been fully displayed, he was again summoned by
Lord Ellesmere to make a frank and full avowal of his guilt.</p>
<p>Curtly and proudly he dismissed that appeal. 'My lord, I came
hither with a resolution to defend myself.'</p>
<p>Thereafter they came to the powder which Somerset had sent
Overbury some four months before the latter's death.</p>
<p>'Four several juries,' announced Sergeant Montague, 'have found
that this powder was poison, and of this poison Sir Thomas Overbury
died.'</p>
<p>It was a preposterous statement and flagrantly at variance with
the indictment, which had it that Sir Thomas had died of an
injection of corrosive sublimate.</p>
<p>From all the frivolous and uncorroborated lies with which that
scoundrel Franklin had sought to delude the Lord Chief Justice,
certain imaginary conversations with Lord Somerset were now cited
to convict him.</p>
<p>The whole of the prosecution was taken up with the weaving of
those strands of evidence into a web in which to muffle him. It was
a cobweb which a single strong breath of truth should have blown to
fragments. That breath it was well within his power to supply. But
he knew that at the first attempt those two fellows standing just
behind him would hoodwink him and carry him away, and that all hope
of mercy would be denied his countess. So in his fight for life and
honour he must keep narrowly to the trumpery matters that had been
urged, matters which, taken severally, as they must be taken, were
so vague and impalpable that there was no seizing them.</p>
<p>It was evening before the prosecution closed, and already many
of those who had been mere spectators were in a fainting condition
and withdrew unable to endure more.</p>
<p>Lights were brought, and once again the thin voice of the Lord
High Steward summoned his lordship to set a term to the business by
pleading guilty.</p>
<p>'Your wife,' Ellesmere reminded him, 'yesterday confessed the
fact, and there is great hope of the King's mercy if you now mar
not what is made.'</p>
<p>It was, as he well perceived, at once a bribe and a threat. He
was meant to understand that, unless he also now confessed, mercy
might be withheld, not only from himself, but also from his wife.
This was an attempt to narrow down the bargain he had accepted, and
was asking of him a price altogether higher than that which had
been first concerted, a price which he could not pay.</p>
<p>'I am confident in my cause,' he answered, 'and I am here to
defend it.'</p>
<p>To that defence he now addressed himself. He had come to trial
without foreknowledge of what evidence was to be preferred against
him, and all the assistance he had received had been in a supply of
pen and ink and paper so that he might prepare his defence in a
measure as the prosecution unfolded the case. Even a skilled
counsel might have found such a course beyond his powers. Somerset
was without training in such matters; he felt the more helpless
because the chief witnesses against him were already dead and could
not be brought to be questioned by him on their testimony;
therefore he must rest his defence entirely upon argument, and his
wits were bewildered and exhausted by that day's long ordeal.</p>
<p>As he stood there, leaning upon the rail, faltering and
pondering where he should begin, the thought of Overbury surged in
his mind. If only that ready-witted fellow were at hand to speak
for him now! How he would have torn that tissue of false and
fabricated evidence into shreds and flung them into the faces of
those who urged it! He perceived the tragic irony of such a thought
at such a time and in such a cause. He put it from him, and
addressed himself to the task in hand.</p>
<p>He began with matters in which common knowledge must bear
witness for him. He vehemently denied that he had been a party to
any plot, or, indeed, that any plot had existed, to remove Sir
William Wade from the Lieutenancy of the Tower, so as to bring in
Sir Gervase Elwes in his stead. Their lordships well knew that Wade
was removed from his charge on the grounds of dishonesty towards
the Lady Arabella.</p>
<p>He passed on to the evidence of Franklin, the only evidence that
definitely linked him with his countess in the practices she had
admitted against Overbury. He denied all knowledge of that perjured
knave. He had never seen him in his life, and he challenged them to
prove by independent testimony that any relations had ever existed
between himself and the man.</p>
<p>Lastly he came to the powder which he had sent Overbury and
which it was now alleged had caused Overbury's death. He admitted
having sent it, but he denied&mdash;as the facts themselves
abundantly denied&mdash;that it was poison. On the contrary, it was
good physic, of which their lordships held evidence. He called for
the production of the letter in which Overbury had thanked him for
it and had acknowledged the gentle effect it had produced in
him.</p>
<p>But he called in vain, and being denied in this he perceived
suddenly how hopeless was all his striving. Already weary, he grew
now confused and disheartened by this clear perception that no
defence could here avail him. This court was determined upon his
conviction, since that was the pleasure of the King, to the end
that all questions touching the death of Sir Thomas Overbury should
finally be set at rest.</p>
<p>He abandoned the futile struggle with a last plea to his peers
that they should not take circumstances for evidence and an oath
before God that he was neither guilty of nor privy to any wrong
that Overbury suffered in this kind.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Lieutenant withdrew him from the bar, and the
peers retired for a little while. On their return, the Lord High
Steward resumed his place under the scarlet canopy, the
sergeant-crier called each lord by name; each one answered in turn,
and each one in turn pronounced the prisoner guilty.</p>
<p>The Earl of Somerset was once more conducted into court to be
asked what he had to say why sentence of death should not be passed
upon him.</p>
<p>Calm and pale he stood in the flare of the torches, for by now
darkness had closed down upon the scene. His glance swept the ranks
of the peers who had pronounced him guilty. He looked at the
stately Pembroke, who had ever been his enemy, and who now held the
office of Lord Chamberlain from which Somerset had been deposed; he
looked at the Earl of Worcester who now held the Privy Seal of
which Somerset had been deprived; onward his glance moved over
those nobles who in the past willingly or unwillingly had courted
him and hung upon his favour. It was a bitterness, indeed, to have
been left thus at their mercy, to be spurned and trampled by
them.</p>
<p>If in the shadows to which it had passed the spirit of Overbury
was troubled by vindictiveness towards the friend who had betrayed
him, that spirit should now be appeased by the magnitude of the
punishment which had descended upon his betrayer. Deprived of his
offices of State, to be stripped of the greater part of the vast
possessions which by the King's bounty he had held, branded with
infamy, he was now asked what he could say why sentence of death
should not be pronounced against him. Why should he say anything?
What attraction could life still offer one fallen as he had
fallen?</p>
<p>Steady and firm rang his voice with the only answer which in the
circumstances he could make.</p>
<p>'I only desire a death according to my degree.'</p>
<p>But not even the axe was to dignify the sentence, which was that
he should be hanged by the neck until he was dead. Having
pronounced it, the Lord High Steward broke his staff and dissolved
the court. It was past ten o'clock. The trial had consumed twelve
hours.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant reconducted him to the waiting barge, hemmed
about by his guard of pikemen, on whose corselets and steel caps
the red glare of the torches cast reflections that were like stains
of blood.</p>
<p>Through the luminous May night the great barge slipped down the
river on the bosom of the ebbing tide, conveying him back to the
Tower.</p>
<p>In that Tower, the sentence of death remitted by a king who did
not desire the blood of a discarded minion, he was to languish
together with his countess for five miserable years, to be
ultimately banished with her into rural remoteness from a court
whose chief pride and ornament he once had been. Reduced in
circumstances, they were to live out their embittered lives in the
ruin which Overbury had foretold him would follow upon his
association with the House of Howard.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had some foreknowledge of this as the Lieutenant's
barge brought up under the black shadow of Traitor's Gate, trusting
to the King's word that just so much merciless mercy would be shown
him and his countess in return for a silence which would have been
enforced had he attempted to violate it.</p>
<p>And lower down the river at that same hour, a king, who shivered
and sweated by turn, in panic awaited news in a fever of anxiety
that had endured since morning. To every boat that since noon he
had seen landing at the bridge below the palace he had sent a
messenger for tidings of the trial, and when the messenger returned
empty-handed, his majesty had slobbered curses at him, growing
increasingly fearful as the day wore on, unable to find
distraction, to eat, or even to sit still. Despite all precautions
the Earl of Somerset might yet have succeeded in betraying him. He
might have contrived to point out the connection between Loubel and
Mayerne, demanding to know why Loubel should be permitted to go
free in view of all the admitted facts and why Mayerne had not been
called for examination; demanding, indeed, that these omissions
should now be rectified before judgment was pronounced.</p>
<p>Such questions as these could be asked in a few words flung out
before the Lieutenant's men should have time to hoodwink the
prisoner. And once asked, those questions, although not answered by
the court, would be answered by the people thronging Westminster
Hall who had heard them. The hoodwinking and carrying away of the
prisoner not only would not prevent their being answered, but would
guide public opinion in answering them in such fashion that the
royal dignity and honour would be for all time besmirched.</p>
<p>In such fears as these did the King spend the hours of waiting
in Greenwich Palace, fears which mounted steadily as the day
advanced, until at last they were grown into convictions. That
which he dreaded must have come to pass. There could be no other
explanation of the protraction of the business. To the end Somerset
had said that he was neither Gowrie nor Balmerino. It was proof,
thought the maudlin King, that Robin had never truly loved him.</p>
<p>And then at last, late at night, when he was almost prostrate
from panic and exhausted from the lack of food, there came a dusty
messenger who had ridden hard to bring him news that the
headstrong, passionate Robin had suffered conviction without any
word that should betray his king.</p>
<p>He licked his lips as he heard the news. The colour crept slowly
back into that normally florid face. He even contrived a smile, as
he waved the messenger away. Then he heaved himself up onto his
rachitic legs, and beckoned from amongst his surrounding gentlemen
the handsome, resplendent young Villiers. He flung an arm about the
young minion's neck.</p>
<p>'So that's ended, Steenie,' he mumbled. He fetched a sigh, and
his pale, bulging eyes grew watery. 'He shall know how clement I
can be. For never could it be said of me that I could put entirely
from my heart any creature I had truly loved.' Then, on an altered,
brisker tone, and pinching the lad's smooth cheek, 'For God's sake,
let's to supper,' he cried.</p>
