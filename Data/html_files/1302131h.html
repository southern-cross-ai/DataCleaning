<h1>Cheating the Gallows</h1>

<h2>Israel Zangwill</h2>

<h3>Published in <i>The Idler</i>, February 1893</h3>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b>Curious Couple</b></p>
<p>They say that a union of opposites makes the happiest marriage,
and perhaps it is on the same principle that men who chum are
always so oddly assorted. You shall find a man of letters sharing
diggings with an auctioneer and a medical student pigging with a
stockbroker's clerk. Perhaps each thus escapes the temptation to
talk "shop" in his hours of leisure while he supplements his own
experiences of life by his companion's.</p>
<p>There could not be an odder couple than Tom Peters and Everard
G. Roxdal&mdash;the contrast began with their names, and ran
through the entire chapter. They had a bedroom and a sitting-room
in common, but it would not be easy to find what else. To his
landlady, worthy Mrs. Seacon, Tom Peters' profession was a little
vague, but everybody knew that Roxdal was the manager of the City
and Suburban Bank, and it puzzled her to think why a bank manager
should live with such a seedy-looking person, who smoked clay pipes
and sipped whiskey and water all the evening when he was at home.
For Roxdal was as spruce and erect as his fellow-lodger was
round-shouldered and shabby; he never smoked and he confined
himself to a small glass of claret at dinner.</p>
<p>It is possible to live with a man and see very little of him.
Where each of the partners lives his own life in his own way, with
his own circle of friends and external amusements, days may go by
without the men having five minutes together. Perhaps this explains
why these partnerships jog along so much more peaceably than
marriages, where the chain is drawn so much tighter, and galls the
partners rather than links them. Diverse, however, as were the
hours and habits of the chums, they often breakfasted together, and
they agreed in one thing&mdash;they never stayed out at night. For
the rest Peters sought his diversions in the company of journalists
and frequented debating rooms, where he propounded the most
iconoclastic views; while Roxdal had highly respectable houses open
to him in the suburbs and was, in fact, engaged to be married to
Clara Newell, the charming daughter of a retired corn merchant, a
widower with no other child.</p>
<p>Clara naturally took up a good deal of Roxdal's time, and he
often dressed to go to the play with her, while Peters stayed at
home in a faded dressing-gown and loose slippers. Mrs. Seacon liked
to see gentlemen about the house in evening dress, and made
comparisons not favourable to Peters. And this in spite of the fact
that he gave her infinitely less trouble than the younger man.</p>
<p>It was Peters who first took the apartments, and it was
characteristic of his easy-going temperament that he was so openly
and naively delighted with the view of the Thames obtainable from
the bedroom window that Mrs. Seacon was emboldened to ask
twenty-five per cent more than she had intended. She soon returned
to her normal terms, however, when his friend Roxdal called the
next day to inspect the rooms and overwhelmed her with a
demonstration of their numerous shortcomings. He pointed out that
their being on the ground floor was not an advantage, but a
disadvantage, since they were nearer the noises of the
street&mdash;in fact, the house being a corner one, the noises of
two streets.</p>
<p>Roxdal continued to exhibit the same finicking temperament in
the petty details of the ménage. His shirt fronts were never
sufficiently starched, nor his boots sufficiently polished. Tom
Peters, having no regard for rigid linen, was always good-tempered
and satisfied, and never acquired the respect of his landlady. He
wore blue check shirts and loose ties even on Sundays. It is true
he did not go to church, but slept on till Roxdal returned from
morning service, and even then it was difficult to get him out of
bed, or to make him hurry up his toilette operations. Often the
mid-day meal would be smoking on the table while Peters would smoke
in the bed, and Roxdal, with his head thrust through the folding
doors that separated the bedroom from the sitting-room, would be
adjuring the sluggard to arise and shake off his slumbers and
threatening to sit down without him, lest the dinner be spoilt. In
revenge, Tom was usually up first on week-days, sometimes at such
un-earthly hours that Polly had not yet removed the boots from
outside the bedroom door, and would bawl down to the kitchen for
his shaving water. For Tom, lazy and indolent as he was, shaved
with the unfailing regularity of a man to whom shaving has become
an instinct. If he had not kept fairly regular hours, Mrs. Seacon
would have set him down as an actor, so clean-shaven was he. Roxdal
did not shave. He wore a full beard and, being a fine figure of a
man to boot, no uneasy investor could look upon him without being
re-assured as to the stability of the bank he managed so
successfully. And thus the two men lived in an economical
comradeship, all the firmer, perhaps, for their mutual
incongruities.</p>
<p align="center"><b>A Woman's Instinct</b></p>
<p>It was on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of October, ten days
after Roxdal had settled in his new rooms, that Clara Newell paid
her first visit to him there. She enjoyed a good deal of liberty,
and did not mind accepting his invitation to tea. The corn
merchant, himself indifferently educated, had an exaggerated sense
of the value of culture, and so Clara, who had artistic tastes
without much actual talent, had gone in for painting and might be
seen, in pretty toilettes, copying pictures in the Museum. At one
time it looked as if she might be reduced to working seriously at
her art, for Satan, who finds mischief still for idle hands to do,
had persuaded her father to embark the fruits of years of toil in
bubble companies. However, things turned out not so bad as they
might have been, a little was saved from the wreck, and the
appearance of a suitor, in the person of Everard G. Roxdal, ensured
her a future of competence, if not of the luxury she had been
entitled to expect. She had a good deal of affection for Everard,
who was unmistakably a clever man, as well as a good-looking one.
The prospect seemed fair and cloudless. Nothing presaged the
terrible storm that was about to break over these two lives.
Nothing had ever for a moment come to vex their mutual contentment
till this Sunday afternoon. The October sky, blue and sunny, with
an Indian summer sultriness, seemed an exact image of her life,
with its aftermath of a happiness that had once seemed
blighted.</p>
<p>Everard had always been so attentive, so solicitous, that she
was as much surprised as chagrined to find that he had apparently
forgotten the appointment. Hearing her astonished interrogation of
Polly in the passage, Tom shambled from the sitting-room in his
loose slippers and his blue check shirt, with his eternal clay pipe
in his mouth, and informed her that Roxdal had gone out suddenly
earlier in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"G-g-one out," stammered poor Clara; all confused. "But he asked
me to come to tea."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're Miss Newell, I suppose," said Tom.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am Miss Newell."</p>
<p>"He has told me a great deal about you, but I wasn't able
honestly to congratulate him on his choice till now."</p>
<p>Clara blushed uneasily under the compliment, and under the
ardour of his admiring gaze. Instinctively she distrusted the man.
The very first tones of his deep bass voice gave her a peculiar
shudder. And then his impoliteness in smoking that vile clay was so
gratuitous.</p>
<p>"Oh, then you must be Mr. Peters," she said in return. "He has
often spoken to me of you."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Tom, laughingly, "I suppose he's told you all my
vices. That accounts for your not being surprised at my Sunday
attire."</p>
<p>She smiled a little, showing a row of pearly teeth. "Everard
ascribes to you all the virtues," she said.</p>
<p>"Now that's what I call a friend!" he cried, ecstatically. "But
won't you come in? He must be back in a moment. He surely would not
break an appointment with you." The admiration latent in the
accentuation of the last pronoun was almost offensive.</p>
<p>She shook her head. She had a just grievance against Everard,
and would punish him by going away indignantly.</p>
<p>"Do let me give you a cup of tea," Tom pleaded. "You must be
awfully thirsty this sultry weather. There! I will make a bargain
with you! If you will come in now, I promise to clear out the
moment Everard returns and not spoil your tête-à-tête." But Clara
was obstinate; she did not at all relish this man's society, and
besides, she was not going to throw away her grievance against
Everard. "I know Everard will slang me dreadfully when he comes in
if I let you go," Tom urged. "Tell me at least where he can find
you."</p>
<p>"I am going to take the 'bus at Charing Cross, and I'm going
straight home," Clara announced determinedly. She put up her
parasol in a pet, and went up the street into the Strand. A cold
shadow seemed to have fallen over all things. But just as she was
getting into the 'bus, a hansom dashed down Trafalgar Square, and a
well-known voice hailed her. The hansom stopped, and Everard got
out and held out his hand.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad you're a bit late," he said. "I was called out
unexpectedly, and have been trying to rush back in time. You
wouldn't have found me if you had been punctual. But I thought," he
added, laughing, "I could rely on you as a woman."</p>
<p>"I was punctual," Clara said angrily. "I was not getting out of
this 'bus, as you seem to imagine, but into it, and was going
home."</p>
<p>"My darling!" he cried remorsefully. "A thousand apologies." The
regret on his handsome face soothed her. He took the rose he was
wearing in the button-hole of his fashionably-cut coat and gave it
to her.</p>
<p>"Why were you so cruel?" he murmured, as she nestled against him
in the hansom. "Think of my despair if I had come home to hear you
had come and gone. Why didn't you wait a moment?"</p>
<p>A shudder traversed her frame. "Not with that man, Peters!" she
murmured.</p>
<p>"Not with that man, Peters!" he echoed sharply. "What is the
matter with Peters?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said. "I don't like him."</p>
<p>"Clara," he said, half-sternly, half-cajolingly, "I thought you
were above these feminine weaknesses; you are punctual, strive also
to be reasonable. Tom is my best friend. From boyhood we have been
always together. There is nothing Tom would not do for me, or I for
Tom. You must like him, Clara; you must, if only for my sake."</p>
<p>"I'll try," Clara promised, and then he kissed her in gratitude
and broad daylight.</p>
<p>"You'll be very nice to him at tea, won't you?" he said
anxiously. "I shouldn't like you two to be bad friends."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be bad friends," Clara protested; "only the
moment I saw him a strange repulsion and mistrust came over
me."</p>
<p>"You are quite wrong about him&mdash;quite wrong," he assured
her earnestly. "When you know him better, you'll find him the best
of fellows. Oh, I know," he said suddenly, "I suppose he was very
untidy, and you women go so much by appearances!"</p>
<p>"Not at all," Clara retorted. "'Tis you men who go by
appearances."</p>
<p>"Yes, you do. That's why you care for me," he said, smiling.</p>
<p>She assured him it wasn't, and she didn't care for him so much
as he plumed himself, but he smiled on. His smile died away,
however, when he entered his rooms and found Tom nowhere.</p>
<p>"I daresay you've made him run about hunting for me," he
grumbled.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he knew I'd come back, and went away to leave us
together," she answered. "He said he would when you came."</p>
<p>"And yet you say you don't like him!"</p>
<p>She smiled reassuringly. Inwardly, however, she felt pleased at
the man's absence.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Polly Receives a Proposal</b></p>
<p>If Clara Newell could have seen Tom Peters carrying on with
Polly in the passage, she might have felt justified in her
prejudice against him. It must be confessed, though, that Everard
also carried on with Polly. Alas! It is to be feared that men are
much of a muchness where women are concerned; shabby men and smart
men, bank managers and journalists, bachelors and semi-detached
bachelors. Perhaps it was a mistake after all to say the chums had
nothing patently in common. Everard, I am afraid, kissed Polly
rather more often than Clara, and although it was because he
respected her less, the reason would perhaps not have been
sufficiently consoling to his affianced wife. For Polly was pretty,
especially on alternate Sunday afternoons, and when at ten PM she
returned from her outings, she was generally met in the passage by
one or other of the men. Polly liked to receive the homage of real
gentlemen, and set her white cap at all indifferently. Thus, just
before Clara knocked on that memorable Sunday afternoon, Polly,
being confined to the house by the unwritten code regulating the
lives of servants, was amusing herself by flirting with Peters.</p>
<p>"You are fond of me a little bit," the graceless Tom whispered,
"aren't you?"</p>
<p>"You know I am, sir," Polly replied.</p>
<p>"You don't care for anyone else in the house?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, sir, and never let anyone kiss me but you. I wonder how
it is, sir?" Polly replied ingenuously.</p>
<p>"Give me another," Tom answered.</p>
<p>She gave him another, and tripped to the door to answer Clara's
knock.</p>
<p>And that very evening, when Clara was gone and Tom still out,
Polly turned without the faintest atom of scrupulosity, or even
jealousy, to the more fascinating Roxdal, and accepted his amorous
advances. If it would seem at first sight that Everard had less
excuse for such frivolity than his friend, perhaps the seriousness
he showed in this interview may throw a different light upon the
complex character of the man.</p>
<p>"You're quite sure you don't care for anyone but me?" he asked
earnestly.</p>
<p>"Of course not, sir!" Polly replied indignantly. "How could
I?"</p>
<p>"But you care for that soldier I saw you out with last
Sunday?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, sir, he's only my young man," she said
apologetically.</p>
<p>"Would you give him up?" he hissed suddenly.</p>
<p>Polly's pretty face took a look of terror. "I couldn't, sir!
He'd kill me. He's such a jealous brute, you've no idea."</p>
<p>"Yes, but suppose I took you away from here?" he whispered
eagerly. "Somewhere where he couldn't find you&mdash;South America,
Africa, somewhere thousands of miles across the seas."</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, you frighten me!" whispered Polly, cowering before his
ardent eyes, which shone in the dimly-lit passage.</p>
<p>"Would you come with me?" he hissed. She did not answer; she
shook herself free and ran into the kitchen, trembling with a vague
fear.</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Crash</b></p>
<p>One morning, earlier than his earliest hour of demanding his
shaving water, Tom rang the bell violently and asked the alarmed
Polly what had become of Mr. Roxdal.</p>
<p>"How should I know, sir?" she gasped. "Ain't he been in,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Apparently not," Tom answered anxiously. "He never remains out.
We have been here three weeks now, and I can't recall a single
night he hasn't been home before twelve. I can't make it out." All
enquiries proved futile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seacon reminded him of the thick fog that had come on
suddenly the night before.</p>
<p>"What fog?" asked Tom.</p>
<p>"Lord! Didn't you notice it, sir?"</p>
<p>"No, I came in early, smoked, read, and went to bed about
eleven. I never thought of looking out of the window."</p>
<p>"It began about ten," said Mrs. Seacon, "and got thicker and
thicker. I couldn't see the lights of the river from my bedroom.
The poor gentleman has been and gone and walked into the water."
She began to whimper.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, nonsense," said Tom, though his expression belied his
words. "At the worst I should think he couldn't find his way home,
and couldn't get a cab, so put up for the night at some hotel. I
daresay it will be all right." He began to whistle as if in
restored cheerfulness. At eight o'clock there came a letter for
Roxdal, marked immediate, but as he did not turn up for breakfast,
Tom went round personally to the City and Suburban Bank. He waited
half-an-hour there, but the manager did not make his appearance.
Then he left the letter with the cashier and went away with anxious
countenance.</p>
<p>That afternoon it was all over London that the manager of the
City and Suburban had disappeared, and that many thousand pounds of
gold and notes had disappeared with him.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard opened the letter marked immediate, and noted that
there had been a delay in its delivery, for the address had been
obscure, and an official alteration had been made. It was written
in a feminine hand and said: "On second thoughts I cannot accompany
you. Do not try to see me again. Forget me. I shall never forget
you." There was no signature.</p>
<p>Clara Newell, distracted, disclaimed all knowledge of this
letter. Polly deposed that the fugitive had proposed flight to her,
and the routes to Africa and South America were especially watched.
Some months passed without result. Tom Peters went about
overwhelmed with grief and astonishment. The police took possession
of all the missing man's effects. Gradually the hue and cry
dwindled, died.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Faith And Unfaith</b></p>
<p>"At last we meet!" cried Tom Peters, while his face lit up in
joy. "How are you, dear Miss Newell?" Clara greeted him coldly. Her
face had an abiding pallor now. Her lover's flight and shame had
prostrated her for weeks. Her soul was the arena of contending
instincts. Alone of all the world she still believed in Everard's
innocence, felt that there was something more than met the eye,
divined some devilish mystery behind it all.</p>
<p>And yet that damning letter from the anonymous lady shook her
sadly. Then, too, there was the deposition of Polly. When she heard
Peters' voice accosting her all her old repugnance resurged. It
flashed upon her that this man&mdash;Roxdal's boon
companion&mdash;must know far more than he had told to the police.
She remembered how Everard had spoken of him, with what affection
and confidence! Was it likely he was utterly ignorant of Everard's
movements? Mastering her repugnance, she held out her hand. It
might be well to keep in touch with him; he was possibly the clue
to the mystery. She noticed he was dressed a shade more trimly, and
was smoking a meerschaum. He walked along at her side, making no
offer to put his pipe out.</p>
<p>"You have not heard from Everard?" he asked. She flushed. "Do
you think I'm an accessory after the fact?" she cried.</p>
<p>"No, no," he said soothingly. "Pardon me, I was thinking he
might have written&mdash;giving no exact address, of course. Men do
sometimes dare to write thus to women. But, of course, he knows you
too well&mdash;you would have put the police on his track."</p>
<p>"Certainly," she exclaimed, indignantly. "Even if he is innocent
he must face the charge."</p>
<p>"Do you still entertain the possibility of his innocence?"</p>
<p>"I do," she said boldly, and looked him full in the face. His
eyelids drooped with a quiver. "Don't you?"</p>
<p>"I have hoped against hope," he replied, in a voice faltering
with emotion. "Poor old Everard! But I am afraid there is no room
for doubt. Oh, this wicked curse of money&mdash;tempting the
noblest and the best of us."</p>
<p>The weeks rolled on. Gradually she found herself seeing more and
more of Tom Peters, and gradually, strange to say, he grew less
repulsive. From the talks they had together, she began to see that
there was really no reason to put faith in Everard; his
criminality, his faithlessness, were too flagrant. Gradually she
grew ashamed of her early mistrust of Peters; remorse bred esteem,
and esteem ultimately ripened into feelings so warm, that when Tom
gave freer vent to the love that had been visible to Clara from the
first, she did not repulse him.</p>
<p>It is only in books that love lives forever. Clara, so her
father thought, showed herself a sensible girl in plucking out an
unworthy affection and casting it from her heart. He invited the
new lover to his house, and took to him at once. Roxdal's somewhat
supercilious manner had always jarred upon the unsophisticated corn
merchant. With Tom the old man got on much better. While evidently
quite as well-informed and cultured as his whilom friend, Tom knew
how to impart his superior knowledge with the accent on the
knowledge rather than on the superiority, while he had the air of
gaining much information in return. Those who are most conscious of
defects of early education are most resentful of other people
sharing their consciousness. Moreover, Tom's bonhomie was far more
to the old fellow's liking than the studied politeness of his
predecessor, so that on the whole Tom made more of a conquest of
the father than of the daughter. Nevertheless, Clara was by no
means unresponsive to Tom's affection and when, after one of his
visits to the house, the old man kissed her fondly and spoke of the
happy turn things had taken and how, for the second time in their
lives, things had mended when they seemed at their blackest, her
heart swelled with a gush of gratitude and joy and tenderness, and
she fell sobbing into her father's arms.</p>
<p>Tom calculated that he made a clear five hundred a year by
occasional journalism, besides possessing some profitable
investments which he had inherited from his mother, so that there
was no reason for delaying the marriage. It was fixed for May Day,
and the honeymoon was to be spent in Italy.</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Dream and the Awakening</b></p>
<p>But Clara was not destined to happiness. From the moment she had
promised herself to her first love's friend, old memories began to
rise up and reproach her. Strange thoughts stirred in the depths of
her soul, and in the silent watches of the night she seemed to hear
Everard's accents, charged with grief and upbraiding. Her
uneasiness increased as her wedding-day drew near. One night, after
a pleasant afternoon spent in being rowed by Tom among the upper
reaches of the Thames, she retired to rest full of vague
forebodings. And she dreamt a terrible dream. The dripping form of
Everard stood by her bedside, staring at her with ghastly eyes. Had
he been drowned on the passage to his land of exile? Frozen with
horror, she put the question.</p>
<p>"I have never left England!" the vision answered.</p>
<p>Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Never left England?" she repeated, in tones which did not seem
to be hers.</p>
<p>The wraith's stony eyes stared on, but there was silence.</p>
<p>"Where have you been then?" she asked in her dream.</p>
<p>"Very near you," came the answer.</p>
<p>"There has been foul play then!" she shrieked.</p>
<p>The phantom shook its head in doleful assent.</p>
<p>"I knew it!" she shrieked. "Tom Peters&mdash;Tom Peters has done
away with you. Is it not he? Speak!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is he&mdash;Tom Peters&mdash;whom I loved more than all
the world." Even in the terrible oppression of the dream she could
not resist saying, woman-like:</p>
<p>"Did I not warn you against him?"</p>
<p>The phantom stared on silently and made no reply.</p>
<p>"But what was his motive?" she asked at length.</p>
<p>"Love of gold&mdash;and you. And you are giving yourself to
him," it said sternly.</p>
<p>"No, no, Everard! I will not! I will not! I swear it! Forgive
me!" The spirit shook its head sceptically.</p>
<p>"You love him. Women are false&mdash;as false as men."</p>
<p>She strove to protest again, but her tongue refused its
office.</p>
<p>"If you marry him, I shall always be with you! Beware!" The
dripping figure vanished as suddenly as it came, and Clara awoke in
a cold perspiration. Oh, it was horrible!</p>
<p>The man she had learnt to love, the murderer of the man she had
learnt to forget! How her original prejudice had been justified!
Distracted, shaken to her depths, she would not take counsel even
of her father, but informed the police of her suspicions. A raid
was made on Tom's rooms, and lo! The stolen notes were discovered
in a huge bundle. It was found that he had several banking
accounts, with a large, recently-paid amount in each bank. Tom was
arrested. Attention was now concentrated on the corpses washed up
by the river. It was not long before the body of Roxdal came to
shore, the face distorted almost beyond recognition by long
immersion, but the clothes patently his, and a pocket-book in the
breast-pocket removing the last doubt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seacon and Polly and Clara Newell all identified the body.
Both juries returned a verdict of murder against Tom Peters, the
recital of Clara's dream producing a unique impression in the court
and throughout the country. The theory of the prosecution was that
Roxdal had brought home the money, whether to fly alone or to
divide it, or whether even for some innocent purpose, as Clara
believed, was immaterial. That Peters determined to have it all,
that he had gone out for a walk with the deceased, and, taking
advantage of the fog, had pushed him into the river, and that he
was further impelled to the crime by love for Clara Newell, as was
evident from his subsequent relations with her. The judge put on
the black cap. Tom Peters was duly hung by the neck till he was
dead.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Brief Resume of the Culprit's
Confession</b></p>
<p>When you all read this I shall be dead and laughing at you. I
have been hung for my own murder. I am Everard G. Roxdal. I am also
Tom Peters. We two were one. When I was a young man my moustache
and beard wouldn't come. I bought false ones to improve my
appearance. One day, after I had become manager of the City and
Suburban Bank, I took off my beard and moustache at home, and then
the thought crossed my mind that nobody would know me without them.
I was another man. Instantly it flashed upon me that if I ran away
from the Bank, that other man could be left in London, while the
police were scouring the world for a non-existent fugitive.</p>
<p>But this was only the crude germ of the idea. Slowly I matured
my plan. The man who was going to be left in London must be known
to a circle of acquaintance beforehand. It would be easy enough to
masquerade in the evenings in my beardless condition, with other
disguises of dress and voice. But this was not brilliant enough. I
conceived the idea of living with him. It was Box and Cox reversed.
We shared rooms at Mrs. Seacon's. It was a great strain, but it was
only for a few weeks. I had trick clothes in my bedroom like those
of quick-change artistes; in a moment I could pass from Roxdal to
Peters and from Peters to Roxdal. Polly had to clean two pairs of
boots a morning, cook two dinners, etc., etc. She and Mrs. Seacon
saw one or the other of us every moment; it never dawned upon them
they never saw us both together. At meals I would not be
interrupted, ate off two plates, and conversed with my friend in
loud tones. At other times we dined at different hours. On Sundays
he was supposed to be asleep when I was in church. There is no
landlady in the world to whom the idea would have occurred that one
man was troubling himself to be two (and to pay for two, including
washing). I worked up the idea of Roxdal's flight, asked Polly to
go with me, manufactured that feminine letter that arrived on the
morning of my disappearance. As Tom Peters I mixed with a
journalistic set. I had another room where I kept the gold and
notes till I mistakenly thought the thing had blown over.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, returning from here on the night of my
disappearance, with Roxdal's clothes in a bundle I intended to drop
into the river, it was stolen from me in the fog, and the man into
whose possession it ultimately came appears to have committed
suicide. What, perhaps, ruined me was my desire to keep Clara's
love, and to transfer it to the survivor. Everard told her I was
the best of fellows. Once married to her, I would not have had much
fear. Even if she had discovered the trick, a wife cannot give
evidence against her husband, and often does not want to. I made
none of the usual slips, but no man can guard against a girl's
nightmare after a day up the river and a supper at the Star and
Garter. I might have told the judge he was an ass, but then I
should have had penal servitude for bank robbery, and that is worse
than death. The only thing that puzzles me, though, is whether the
law has committed murder or I suicide.</p>
