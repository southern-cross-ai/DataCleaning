<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br>
<p>T<small>HE</small> following pages, of which I began the
compilation when still engaged in the arduous work of Repatriation
of the Australian troops in all theatres of war, were intended to
be something in the nature of a consecutive and comprehensive story
of the Australian Imperial Force in France during the closing
phases of the Great War. I soon found that the time at my disposal
was far too limited to allow me to make full use of the very
voluminous documentary material which I had collected during the
campaign. The realization of such a project must await a time of
greater leisure. So much as I have had the opportunity of setting
down has, therefore, inevitably taken the form rather of an
individual memoir of this stirring period. While I feel obliged to
ask the indulgence of the reader for the personal character of the
present narrative, this may not be altogether a disadvantage.
Having regard to the responsibilities which it fell to my lot to
bear, it may, indeed, be desirable that I should in all candour set
down what was passing in my mind, and should attempt to describe
the ever-changing external circumstances which operated to guide
and form the judgments and decisions which it became my duty to
make from day to day. It may be that hereafter my exercise of
command in the field and the manner in which I made use of the
opportunities which presented themselves will be the subject of
criticism. I welcome this, provided that the facts and the events
of the time are known to and duly weighed by the critic.</p>
<p>My purpose has been to describe in broad outline the part played
by the Australian Army Corps in the closing months of the war, and
I have based upon that record somewhat large claims on behalf of
the Corps. It would have overloaded the story to include in it any
larger number of extracts from original documents than has been
done. I may, however, assert with confidence that the statements,
statistics and deductions made can be verified by reference to
authoritative sources.</p>
<p>The photographs have been selected from a very large number
taken, during the fighting and often under fire, by Captain G.H.
Wilkins, M.C. The maps have been prepared under my personal
supervision, and are compiled from the official battle maps in
actual use by me during the operations.</p>

in 1918</strong></p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<h4>THE AUSTRALIAN ARMY CORPS</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> renown of the Australians as individual
fighters, in all theatres of the Great War, has loomed large in the
minds and imagination of the people of the Empire.</p>
<p>Many stories of the work they did have been published in the
daily Press and in book form. But it is seldom that any
appreciation can be discovered of the fact that the Australians in
France gradually became, as the war progressed, moulded into a
single, complete and fully organized Army Corps.</p>
<p>Seldom has any stress been laid upon the fact that because it
thus became a formation fixed and stable in composition, fighting
under a single command, and provided with all accessory arms and
services, the Corps was able successfully to undertake fighting
operations on the grandest scale.</p>
<p>There can be little question, however, that it was this
development which constituted the paramount and precedent condition
for the brilliant successes achieved by these splendid troops
during the summer and autumn of 1918&mdash;successes which far
overshadowed those of any earlier period of the war.</p>
<p>For a complete understanding of all the factors which
contributed to those successes, and for an intelligent grasp of the
course of events following so dramatically upon the outbreak of the
great German offensive of March 21st of that year, I propose to
trace, very briefly, the genesis and ultimate development of the
Corps, as it became constituted when, on August 8th, it was
launched upon its great enterprise of opening, in close
collaboration with the Army Corps of its sister Dominion of Canada,
that remarkable counter-offensive, which it maintained, without
pause, without check, and without reverse, for sixty consecutive
days&mdash;a period full of glorious achievement&mdash;which
contributed, as I shall show in these pages, in the most direct and
decisive manner, to the final collapse and surrender of the
enemy.</p>
<p>In the days before the war, there was in the British Service no
recognized or authorized organization known as an Army Corps. When
the Expeditionary Force was launched into the conflict in 1914, the
Army Corps organization was hastily improvised, and consisted at
first merely of an Army Corps Staff, with a small allotment of
special Corps Troops and services, and of a fluctuating number of
Divisions.</p>
<p>It was the <i>Division</i> * and not the <em>Corps</em>, which
was then the strategical unit of the Army. Even when the necessity
for the formation of Army Corps was recognized, it was still a
fundamental conception that it was the Division, and not the Army
Corps, which constituted the fighting unit.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A <i>Division</i> consists of three Infantry
Brigades, Divisional Artillery, three Field Companies of Engineers,
three Field Ambulances, a Pioneer Battalion, a Machine Gun
Battalion, together with Supply, Sanitary and Veterinary Services.
Its nominal strength is 20,000.<br>
<br>
An <i>Infantry Brigade</i> consists of four Infantry Battalions,
each of 1,000 men, and a Light Trench Mortar Battery.<br>
<br>
Divisional Artillery comprises two Brigades each of four batteries,
each of six guns or howitzers, also one Heavy and three medium
Trench Mortar Batteries, and the Divisional Ammunition Column.<br>
<br>
This composition of a Division was modified in detail during the
course of the war.]</p>
<p>To each Army Corps were allotted at first only two, but later as
many as four Divisions, according to the needs and circumstances of
the moment. But the component Divisions never, for long, remained
the same. The actual composition of every Army Corps was subject to
constant changes and interchanges, and it was rare for any given
Division to remain for more than a few weeks in any one Army
Corps.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of such an arrangement are sufficiently
obvious to require no great elaboration; at the same time, it has
to be recognized that, during the first three years of the war, at
any rate, the Army was undergoing a process of rapid expansion, and
that, on grounds of expediency, it was neither possible nor
desirable to adopt a policy of a fixed and immutable composition
for so large a formation as an Army Corps.</p>
<p>Moreover, the special conditions of trench warfare made it
imperative to create, under the respective Armies, and in the
respective zones of those Armies, a subordinate administrative and
tactical authority with a more or less fixed geographical
jurisdiction. Thus, the frontage held by each of the five British
Armies became subdivided into a series of Corps frontages, and each
Corps Commander had allotted to him a definite frontage, a definite
depth and a definite area, for his administrative and executive
direction.</p>
<p>It was within this Corps area that he exercised entire control
of all functions of a purely local and geographical character: such
as the maintenance of all roads, railways, canals, telegraphs and
telephones; the control of all traffic; the apportionment of all
billeting and quartering facilities; the allocation and employment
of all means of transport; the collection and distribution of all
supplies, comprising food, forage, munitions and engineering
materials; the conservation and distribution of all water supply;
the sanitation of the area; the whole medical administration
within, and the evacuation of sick and wounded from the area; the
establishment and working of shops of all descriptions, both for
general engineering and for Ordnance purposes; also of laundries,
bathing establishments and rest camps; the creation of facilities
for the entertainment and recreation of resting troops, and of
schools for their military training and for the education of their
leaders.</p>
<p>The Corps Commander was, in addition, directly responsible to
the Army Commander for the tactical defence of his whole area, for
the creation and maintenance of the entire system of field defences
covering his frontage, comprising trench systems in numerous
successive zones and field fortifications of all descriptions; for
preparations for the demolition of railways and bridges to meet the
eventuality of an enforced withdrawal; and for detailed plans for
an advance into the enemy's territory whenever the opportune moment
should arrive.</p>
<p>The extensive responsibilities thus imposed upon the Corps
Commander, and upon the whole of his Staff, obviously demanded an
intimate study and knowledge of the whole of the Corps area, such
as could be acquired only by continuous occupation of one and the
same area for a period extending over many months. It would
therefore have been in the highest degree inconvenient to move such
a complex organization as an Army Corps Staff from one area to
another at short intervals of time. On the other hand, the several
Divisions allotted to any given Corps for the actual occupation and
maintenance of the defences could not be called upon to carry out
without relief or rest, trench duty for continuous periods longer
than a few weeks at a time. During the first three years the number
of Divisions at the disposal of the British High Command was never
adequate to provide each Army Corps in the front line with
sufficient Divisions to permit of a regular alternation out of its
own resources of periods of trench duty and periods of rest. For a
Corps holding a two-Division frontage, for example, it would have
been necessary to provide a permanent strength of at least four
Divisions in order to permit of such a rotation.</p>
<p>The expedient generally adopted, therefore, was to withdraw
altogether from the Army Corps, each Division in turn, as it became
due for a rest behind the line or was required for duty elsewhere,
and to substitute some other available Division from G.H.Q. or Army
Reserve. The broad result was that such an deal as that of a fixed
composition for an Army Corps proved quite unattainable, and there
was a constant interchange of nearly the whole of the Divisions of
the Army, who served in succession, for short periods, in many
different Corps, and under many different Commanders.</p>
<p>To this general rule there was, from the outset of its
formation, one striking exception, in the case of the Canadian Army
Corps, consisting of the four Canadian Divisions, which, with rare
exceptions, and these only for short periods and for quite special
purposes, invariably fought as a complete Corps of fixed
constitution.</p>
<p>It is impossible to overvalue the advantages which accrued to
the Canadian troops from this close and constant association of all
the four Divisions with each other, with the Corps Commander and
his Staff, and with all the accessory Corps services. It meant
mutual knowledge of each other among all Commanders, all Staffs,
all arms and services, and the mutual trust and confidence born of
that knowledge. It was the prime factor in achieving the brilliant
conquest of the Vimy Ridge by that Corps in the early spring of
1917.</p>
<p>The consummation, so long and so ardently hoped for, of a
similar welding together of all Australian units in the field in
France into a single Corps was not achieved in its entirety until a
full year later, and it will be interesting to trace briefly the
steps by which such a result, strongly pressed as it was by the
Australian Government, was finally brought about.</p>
<p>Australia put into the field and maintained until the end,
altogether five Divisions of Infantry, complete with all requisite
Artillery, Engineers, Pioneers and all Supply, Medical and
Veterinary Services, in full conformity with the Imperial War
Establishments laid down for such Divisions. But the method and
time of their formation and organization, the manner and
circumstances of their war preparation, and their employment as
part of a Corps varied considerably.</p>
<p>The First Australian Division, together with the Fourth Infantry
Brigade, which was then under my command and subsequently became
the nucleus of the Fourth Australian Division, were raised in
Australia in 1914, immediately after the outbreak of war, were
transported to Egypt, where they underwent their war training in
the winter of 1915, and ultimately formed, with the New Zealand
Contingent, the body known as the "Anzac" Corps, which carried out,
on April 25th, the memorable landing on the Gallipoli
Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Second Australian Division speedily followed, being raised
in Australia during 1915, and the greater part of this Second
Contingent joined the Anzac Corps in the later stages of the
Dardanelles Expedition. Another independent Brigade (the Eighth)
was also sent to Egypt in that year.</p>
<p>The raising of the Third Australian Division, early in 1916, was
the magnificent answer which Australia made when public men and the
Press declared that the Australian people would resent the
Evacuation from Gallipoli, and the seemingly fruitless sacrifices
which it entailed. This Division was shipped direct to England, and
assembled on Salisbury Plain during the summer of 1916, where I
assumed the command of it. There it underwent its war training
under conditions far more advantageous than those which confronted
the First and Second Divisions in the Egyptian desert. The Third
Division entered the theatre of war in France in November,
1916.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Evacuation of the Peninsula, in December,
1915, led to the assembly in Egypt of the First and Second
Australian Divisions, the Fourth and Eighth independent Infantry
Brigades and some thirty thousand reinforcements and
convalescents.</p>
<p>Out of this supply of fighting material it was then decided to
constitute two additional complete Divisions, the Fourth Brigade
forming the nucleus of the Fourth Australian Division, while the
8th Brigade formed that of the Fifth Australian Division; the
remaining Brigades and the Divisional troops were drawn from
reinforcements, stiffened by a considerable contribution of
veterans taken from the four Infantry Brigades who had carried out
the landing on Gallipoli.</p>
<p>The Fourth and Fifth Divisions were thus formed in Egypt in
February and March, 1916, and the conditions of their war training
were even less satisfactory than those which had confronted the
earlier Divisions. The hot season speedily arrived; equipment,
munitions and animals materialized slowly; training equipment and
suitable training grounds were of the most meagre character; and
upon all these difficulties supervened the urgent obligation to
undertake the strenuous toil of organizing and executing, on the
Sinai desert, the field fortifications required for the defence of
the Suez Canal zone.</p>
<p>The method in which the Divisions then available in Egypt were
to be grouped for the purposes of Corps Command was ripe for
decision. It was then that the determination was reached to
constitute two separate Army Corps, to be called respectively
"First Anzac" and "Second Anzac". The former embodied the First,
Second and Fifth Australian Divisions, under General Sir William
Birdwood; the latter comprised the Fourth Australian and the New
Zealand Divisions under Lieut.-General Sir Alexander Godley.</p>
<p>This was the organization of the Australian troops when the time
arrived, in May, 1916, for their transfer by sea from Egypt to the
scene of the titanic conflict which had been for nearly two years
raging on the soil of France and Belgium.</p>
<p>This grouping did not, however, persist for more than a few
weeks. The opening of the great Somme offensive in July 1916 found
the First, Second and Fourth Divisions operating under First Anzac
in the valley of the Somme, while the Fifth Australian and the New
Zealand Division constituted the Second Anzac Corps in the
Armenti&egrave;res-Fleurbaix sector. There followed other
interchanges as the campaign developed, and by November of 1916,
the grouping stood with First Anzac employing the First, Second,
Fourth and Fifth Divisions, while Second Anzac comprised the Third
Australian, the New Zealand and the Thirty-Fourth British
Divisions.</p>
<p>The series of offensive operations opening with the great and
successful battle of Messines on June 7th, 1917, found the Fourth
Australian Division once again under the command of General Godley,
only to be again withdrawn before the concluding phases of the
Third Battle of Ypres, in September and October, 1917. The autumn
offensive of 1917, aiming at the capture of the Passchendaele
ridge, was the first occasion on which the whole of the five
Divisions were simultaneously engaged in the same locality in a
common enterprise; but even on that occasion they still remained
distributed under two different Corps Commands, and had not yet
achieved the long-desired unity of command and of policy.</p>
<p>This constant interchange of these Divisions, unavoidable as it
probably was, undoubtedly militated against the attainment of the
highest standard of efficiency. Uniform in scope and purpose as
military administration and tactical policy aims to be when
considered on broad lines, yet in a thousand and one matters of
detail, many of them of dominating importance, the personality and
the individual idiosyncrasies of the Corps Commander and of his
principal executive Staff Officers, are calculated to exercise a
powerful influence upon the functioning of the whole Corps.</p>
<p>Under each Corps Commander there grew up in course of time a
particular code of rules, and policies, of technical methods and
even of technical jargon&mdash;most of it in an unwritten form.
This nevertheless tended towards efficiency so long as the whole of
the component personnel of the Corps remained stable, but imposed
many difficulties upon Divisions and other units which joined and
remained under the Corps for a short period only.</p>
<p>The result was that a Divisional Commander and his Staff,
accustomed to work in one environment, often found great
difficulty, and occupied some appreciable period of time, in
accommodating themselves to a new environment, in which doctrines
of attack or defence, counter-attack or trench routine, supply or
maintenance were, some or all of them, widely different from those
to which they had formerly become accustomed.</p>
<p>But, in the case of Dominion troops, there was a motive far
overshadowing the desire for a removal of difficulties of merely a
technical nature. It was one founded upon a sense of Nationhood,
which prompted the wish, vaguely formed early in the war, and
steadily crystallizing in the minds both of the Australian people
and of the troops themselves, that all the Australian Divisions
should be brought together under a single leadership.</p>
<p>This ideal was associated with the hope that the Commanders and
Staffs should to as large an extent as possible, consist solely of
Australian Officers, as soon as ever men sufficiently qualified
became available. It is difficult to emphasize such a desire
without appearing to display ingratitude to a number of brilliant
General and other officers of the Imperial Regular Service. These
men, at a time when Australia was still able to produce only few
officers with the necessary training and experience to justify
their appointment to the command of Divisions and Brigades, or to
the senior Administrative and General Staffs, bore these burdens in
a manner which reflected upon them the greatest credit, and earned
for them the gratitude of the Australian people.</p>
<p>I refer, among many others, particularly to General Sir W.
Birdwood, Major-Generals Sir H.B. Walker, Sir N.M. Smyth, V.C. and
Sir H.V. Cox and Brigadier-Generals W.B. Lesslie and P.G.M. Skene.
But as the war went on, this aspect of the national aspiration
became steadily realized; one by one, the senior commands and staff
appointments were taken over by Australian Officers who had proved
their aptitude and suitability for such responsibilities.</p>
<p>The other ideal of unity of command and close association with
each other of all Australian units, proved slower of realization.
All concerned thought and hoped that it had been, at last, achieved
in December, 1917, when it was decided to abolish the two "Anzac"
Corps, and to constitute a single Australian Army Corps. This was
effected by the transfer of the Third Australian Division from
Second to First Anzac Corps, by altering the title of "Second
Anzac" to "XXII. Corps", and by substituting for the name "First
Anzac" the name "Australian Army Corps", which name it bore until
the termination of the war.</p>
<p>The only regrettable feature of this development was the
dissolution of the close comradeship which had existed between the
troops from the sister Dominions of Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Even then all hopes were doomed to disappointment. For the next
four months the Corps contained five Divisions in name only. Almost
at once, the Fourth Australian Division was withdrawn to serve
under the VII. Corps in connection with the operations before
Cambrai. Not many weeks later, when the German avalanche was
loosed, the whole five Divisions became widely scattered, and, for
a time, the Third and Fourth Divisions served under the VII.
British Corps, the Fifth Division under the III. Corps, and the
First Division under the XV. Corps. It was not until April, 1918,
that four out of the five Divisions again came together under the
control of the Australian Corps Commander, at that time General Sir
William Birdwood.</p>
<p>About the middle of May, 1918, this popular Commander was
appointed to the leadership of the Fifth British Army. In deference
to his long association with the Australian Imperial Force, he was
asked to retain his status as G.O.C., A.I.F. His responsibilities
as the Commander of an Army, and its removal to quite a different
area in the theatre of war, made it, however, impossible for him to
take any active part in the direction of the further operations of
the Australian Corps.</p>
<p>Owing to the vacancy thus created, the Commander-in-Chief, with
the concurrence of the Commonwealth Government, did me the great
honour to appoint me to the command of the Australian Army Corps, a
command which I took over during the closing days of May and
retained until after the Armistice.</p>
<p>At that juncture the First Australian Division was still
involved in heavy fighting, under the XV. Corps, in the Hazebrouck
sector, and no amount of pressure which I could bring to bear
succeeded in prevailing upon G.H.Q. to release this Division. It
was not until early in August, 1918, on the very eve of the opening
of the great offensive, that, at long last, all the five Australian
Divisions became united into one Corps, never to be again
separated. From that date onwards all five Divisions embarked (for
the first time in their history) upon a series of combined
offensive operations, the story of which I have set myself the task
of unfolding in these pages.</p>
<p>The Australian Army Corps had by that time evolved from a mere
geographical organization into one which, over and above its
component Infantry Divisions, had acquired a large number of
accessory arms and services, called Corps Troops, which formed no
part of a Division. It is desirable for the complete understanding
of the battle plans of the offensive period, to consider the extent
and nature of the whole of the fighting and maintenance resources
of the Corps.</p>
<p>These fell theoretically into two categories, comprising on the
one hand those units properly designated as "Corps Troops", which
possessed a fixed and unalterable constitution, and, on the other
hand, those additional units, known as "Army Troops", whose number
and character fluctuated in accordance with the varying needs of
the situation, and with the requirements of the various
operations.</p>
<p>These Army Troops, whenever detailed to act under the orders of
the Corps Commander, became an integral part of the Corps, and were
to all intents and purposes Corps Troops, until such time as they
had completed the tasks allotted to them. The Corps Troops were
multifarious in character, and amounted in the aggregate to large
numbers, occasionally exceeding 50,000, a number as great as that
of three additional Divisions, whose normal strength in the closing
phases of the war never exceeded 17,000.</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Army Corps comprised upwards of 300
Staff and assistant Staff Officers, clerks, orderlies, draughtsmen,
motor drivers, grooms, batmen, cooks and general helpers. The Corps
Cavalry consisted, in the case of the Australian Army Corps, of the
13th Regiment of Australian Light Horse, and was employed, in
conjunction with the Australian Cyclist Battalion, for
reconnaissance, escort and dispatch rider duty.</p>
<p>The Corps Signal Troops were an extensive organization, and
controlled the whole of the Signal communications throughout the
Corps area (except within the Divisions themselves), being
responsible for the establishment, upkeep and working of every
method of communication, whether by telegraph, telephone, wireless,
pigeons, messenger dogs, aeroplane, or dispatch rider. Apart from
telegraphists, mechanics and electrical experts in considerable
numbers, adequate for the very heavy signal traffic during battle,
and even during periods of comparative quiet, Corps Signals also
operated two Motor Air Line and two Cable Sections, for the laying
out and maintenance of wires. Those within the Corps Area, at any
one place and time, amounted to several hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>The whole of the Mechanical Transport, consisting of hundreds of
motor lorries, for the collection and distribution of ammunition,
food, forage and ordnance stores of all descriptions, was also
under the direct control of Corps Headquarters. So also were some
half-dozen mobile Ordnance Workshops, for the repair of weapons and
vehicles of all kinds. All these were permanent Corps Troops, but
represented only a fraction of those serving under the orders of
the Corps Commander.</p>
<p>Among the Administrative Services there was a large contingent
of the Labour Corps comprising some 20 Companies, for the
construction and maintenance of all roads, and water supply
installations, and for the handling, daily, of a formidable bulk
and weight of Artillery ammunition; also two or more Motor
Ambulance Convoys, for the evacuation of the sick and wounded out
of the Corps area, and a number of Army Troops Companies of
Engineers, as well as two Companies of Australian Tunnellers, who
were usually employed upon the construction and maintenance of
bridges, locks, water transport mechanism, deep dug-outs and battle
stations.</p>
<p>But the fighting units of the Corps Troops formed by far the
largest proportion, and comprised Artillery, Heavy Trench Mortars,
Air Squadrons and Tanks. The Artillery alone merits more detailed
consideration. It comprised a vast array of many different classes
of guns for many different purposes, and classified into various
categories by reference either to their calibres, their mobility or
their tactical purposes.</p>
<p>Grouped according to calibre, all guns and howitzers of
4&frac12;-inch bore or less were strictly considered as Field
Artillery which, although administered by the Divisions, was almost
invariably fought under the direct orders of the Corps Commander.
All guns and howitzers of greater bore, up to the giant 15-inch,
were known as Heavy and Siege Artillery.</p>
<p>Regarded from the point of view of mobility, all field guns and
that wonderfully useful weapon, the 60-pounder, were horse-drawn,
the larger ordnance were tractor-drawn, and the very largest were
mounted on railway trains and hauled by steam locomotive.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards tactical utilization, some natures of
ordnance were invariably employed for barrage or harassing fire,
others for bombardment, others for counter-battery fighting, and
yet others for anti-aircraft purposes.</p>
<p>The total ordnance under the orders of the Australian Army Corps
naturally fluctuated according to the daily battle requirements,
but amounted at times, during the period of the war under
consideration, to as many as 1,200 guns of all natures and
calibres, grouped in Brigades each of four to six Batteries, each
of four to six guns.</p>
<p>This very formidable Artillery equipment far transcended in
quantity and dynamic power anything that had been envisaged in the
previous years of the war, or in any previous war, as possible of
administrative or tactical control under a single Commander. It
undoubtedly became a paramount factor in the victories which the
Corps achieved. The Artillery of the Corps is entitled to the proud
boast that it earned the confidence and gratitude of the
Infantry.</p>
<p>It must be left to the imagination to conceive the complexity of
the task of keeping this enormous mass of Artillery regularly
supplied with its ammunition, of multifarious types and in adequate
quantities of each, of allocating to each Brigade and even to each
Battery its appropriate task in the general plan, and of advancing
the whole organization over half-ruined roads and broken bridges,
in order to keep up with the Infantry as the battle moved forward
from day to day. It would defy a detailed description intelligible
to any but gunnery experts.</p>
<p>The Air Force had, by the summer of 1918, also achieved a great
development. The numerous Air Squadrons had embarked upon a policy
of specialization in tactical employment, in accordance with the
build and capacities of the aeroplanes with which they were
equipped. Thus gradually the whole range of utilization became
covered, from the small fast single-seater fighting scout, intended
to engage and drive off enemy 'planes, to the slower two-seater
reconnaissance machines, employed chiefly for photography and for
the direction of Artillery fire, and the giant long-distance
bombing machines.</p>
<p>The Australian Corps had at its exclusive disposal at all times
the No. 3 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps, and employed the
machines for reconnaissance prior to and after battle, and for
contact and counter-attack work and Artillery observation during
battle. But, whenever the scope of the operations rendered it
necessary, the resources of the Corps in aircraft were enormously
increased, and as many as a dozen squadrons were on occasions
employed, during battle, in low flying pursuit of enemy infantry
and transport, in production of smoke screens, in bombing, in
ammunition carrying, and in dispatch bearing&mdash;over and above
usual reconnaissance work designed to keep Corps and Divisional
Headquarters rapidly and minutely informed, from moment to moment,
of the situation of the Infantry in actual contact with the
enemy.</p>
<p>Another branch of the Air Force activities under the direct
control of the Corps was the Captive Balloon Service. Some five
large captive or kite balloons, carrying trained Artillery
Observers, regularly ascended along the Corps front whenever the
weather and the conditions of visibility permitted, to a height of
from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and with the aid of powerful telescopes
and of telephone wires woven into the anchoring cables, kept the
Artillery regularly notified of all visible enemy movement, and of
the occurrence of all suitable targets of opportunity, such as the
flashes from enemy guns in action.</p>
<p>During battle one such balloon was invariably sent up well
forward to observe as closely as possible the progress of the
fighting, but the results were almost uniformly disappointing,
because the smoke and dust of the barrage and the general murk of
battle usually proved impenetrable to the air observer, tied as he
was to a fixed position. The reports of these observers were
usually confined to the laconic observation: "Can't see much, but
all apparently going well."</p>
<p>The last of the major fighting units of Corps Troops remaining
to be mentioned are the Tanks. These extraordinary products of the
war underwent a remarkable evolution during the two years which
followed their first introduction on the battlefield in the Somme
campaign of 1916. The standard of efficiency which had been reached
by the early summer of 1918, in the most developed types of these
curious monsters, as far outclassed that of the earlier types in
both mechanical and fighting properties as the modern service rifle
compared with the old Brown Bess of the Peninsular War. The Tank
crews had improved in like proportion, both in skill, enterprise
and adaptability.</p>

Bray, which was then still in enemy hands</small></p>
<br>
<p>Nothing can be more unstinted than the acknowledgment which the
Australian Corps makes of its obligation to the Tank Corps for its
powerful assistance throughout the whole of the great offensive.
Commencing with the battle of Hamel, a large contingent of Tanks
participated in every important "set-piece" engagement which the
Corps undertook. The Tanks were organized into Brigades, each of
three Battalions, each of three Companies, each of twelve Tanks.
During the opening phases, early in August, the Tank contingent
comprised a whole Brigade of Mark V. Tanks, a Battalion of Mark V.
(Star) Tanks, and a Battalion of fast Armoured Cars; in the later
phases, during the assault on the Hindenburg Line, a second Brigade
of Mark V. Tanks and a Battalion of Whippets also co-operated.</p>
<p>Such was the formidable array of fighting resources under the
direct orders of the Australian Corps Commander, and, together with
the five Australian Divisions, formed a fighting organization of
great strength and solidarity. It became an instrument for
offensive warfare, as has been said by a high authority, which for
size and power excelled all Corps organizations which either this
or any previous war had produced. It was an instrument which it was
a great responsibility, as also a great honour, to wield in the
task of shattering the still formidable military power of the
enemy. For in the early summer of 1918, that power appeared to be
still unimpaired, and still capable of inflicting serious reverses
upon the Allied cause.</p>
<p>Early in 1918, owing to the depletion of human material, the
Imperial Divisions were reconstituted by a reduction of their
Infantry Brigades from a four-battalion to a three-battalion basis,
thus reducing the available infantry by twenty-five per cent. But
in this reduction, the Australian Divisions during the fighting
period shared only to a very small extent. In March the strength of
the 15 Brigades of Australian Infantry in the field was still 60
Battalions. The heavy fighting of March and April compelled the
extinction of 3 Battalions, one each respectively in the 9th, 12th
and 13th Infantry Brigades; but the remaining 57 Battalions of
Infantry remained intact until after the close of the actual
fighting operations early in October. The Corps was therefore
enabled to maintain an additional twelve battalions over and above
the then prevailing corresponding Imperial organization.</p>
<p>It was thus the largest of all Army Corps ever organized, in
this or any other war, by any of the combatants&mdash;the largest
both in point of numbers and of military resources of all
descriptions, approaching, and in one case exceeding, a full Army
command.</p>
<p>But even these great resources and responsibilities were added
to, during the course of the operations, by the allocation, at
successive times, to the Australian Corps of the 17th Imperial
Division, the 32nd Imperial Division and the 27th and 30th American
Divisions. Thus, during the closing days of September, 1918, the
Corps numbered a total of nearly 200,000 men, exceeding more than
fourfold the whole of the British troops under the command of the
Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo.</p>
<p>Of this total about one-half comprised Australian troops, the
Heavy Artillery and other Army units attached to the Corps
consisting of Imperial troops. The Commanders and Staffs from June,
1918, until the end consisted almost entirely of Australian
officers, among whom the following were the senior:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4>BACK TO THE SOMME</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> early days of the year 1918 found the
Australian Corps consisting of the First, Second, Third and Fifth
Australian Divisions, while the Fourth had been transferred far
south to co-operate in the later developments of the Cambrai
fighting. The Corps was then holding, defensively, a sector of the
line in Flanders, which had in the previous years of the war
become, at various times, familiar to all our Divisions, and which
extended from the river Lys at Armenti&egrave;res, northwards, as
far as to include the southern half of the Messines Ridge.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, that very stretch of country, which in June,
1917, had been captured by our Third Division, in co-operation with
the New Zealanders. Opposite its centre lay the town of Warneton,
still in the hands of the enemy. Excepting for a small area of
undulating ground in the extreme north of the Corps sector, the
country was a forbidding expanse of devastation, flat and
woebegone, with long stretches of the front line submerged waist
deep after every freshet in the river Lys, and with the greater
part of our trench system like nothing but a series of canals of
liquid mud.</p>
<p>This unsavoury region formed, however, the most obvious line of
approach for an enemy who, debouching from the direction of
Warneton, aimed at the high land between us and the Channel Ports;
so that, tactically useless as were these mud flats, it was
imperative that they should be strongly defended, in order to
protect from capture the important heights of Messines, Kemmel,
Hill 63, Mont des Cats and Cassel.</p>
<p>During the fighting of the preceding summer and early autumn,
which gave the Australian troops possession of this territory, the
locality was dry, practicable for movement, and reasonably
comfortable for the front line troops. Now it was water-logged,
often ice-bound, bleak and inhospitable. The precious months of dry
weather, between August and October, 1917, had been allowed to pass
without any comprehensive attempt on the part of those Divisions
which had relieved the Second Anzac Corps after its capture of this
ground to perfect the defences of the newly-conquered territory. At
any rate, there was little to show for any work that may have been
attempted.</p>
<p>Now, in the very depth of the worst season of the year, the
demand came to prepare the region for defence and resistance to the
last; for the threat of a great German offensive in the opening of
the 1918 campaigning season was already beginning to take shape. It
was the Australian Corps which was called upon to answer that
demand. There followed week after week of heart-breaking labour,
much of it necessarily by night, in draining the flat land, in
erecting acre upon acre of wire entanglements, in constructing
hundreds of strong points, and concrete machine gun emplacements.
Trenches had to be dug, although the sides collapsed unless
immediately revetted with fascines or sheet iron; roads had to be
repaired, and vain attempts were made to provide the trench
garrisons with dry and bearable underground living quarters.</p>
<p>The monotony of all this labour, which long after&mdash;when the
Australians had disappeared from the scene and were again fighting
on the Somme&mdash;proved to have been undertaken all in vain, was
relieved only by an occasional raid, undertaken by one or other of
our front line Divisions, for the purpose of molesting the enemy
and gathering information. The Corps front was held by two
Divisions in line, one in support, and one resting in a back area;
the rotation of trench duty gave each Division about six weeks in
the line.</p>
<p>My own command at that juncture still comprised the Third
Australian Division, which I had organized and trained in England,
eighteen months before. Although this Division had never been on
the Somme, it had seen a great deal of fighting in Flanders during
1917. During this period, therefore, and until the outbreak of the
storm in the last days of March, 1918, my interest centred chiefly
in the doings of the Third Division, although for a very short
period I had the honour of commanding the Corps during the
temporary absence of Sir William Birdwood.</p>
<p>The information at our disposal led to the inevitable conclusion
that, during January and February, the enemy was busy in
transferring a great mass of military resources from the Russian to
the Western Front. No one capable of reading the signs entertained
the smallest doubt that he contemplated taking the offensive, in
the spring, on a large scale. The only questions were, at what
point would he strike? and what tactics would he employ?</p>
<p>Every responsible Australian Commander, accordingly, during
those months, applied himself diligently to these problems,
formulated his doctrines of obstinate defence, and of the defensive
offensive; and saw to it that his troops received such precognition
in these matters as was possible at such a time and in such an
environment. The principles of defence in successive zones, of the
rapid development of Infantry and Artillery fire power, of the
correct distribution of machine guns, of rear-guard tactics, and
questions of the best equipment for long marches and rapid movement
were debated and resolved upon, in both official and unofficial
conferences of officers.</p>
<p>All this discussion bore good fruit. Among the possible
r&ocirc;les which the Australian Divisions might be called upon to
fill, when the great issue was joined, were those which involved
these very matters. And so the event proved; and the Australians
then approached their new and unfamiliar tasks, not wholly
unprepared by training and study for the difficulties involved.</p>
<p>It was on March 8th that the Third Division bade a last but by
no means a regretful farewell to the mud of Flanders and
Belgium&mdash;regions which it had inhabited almost continuously
for the preceding sixteen months. The Division moved back for a
well-earned rest, to a pleasant countryside at Nielles-lez-Blequin,
not far from Boulogne. It was lying there, enjoying the first signs
of dawning spring when, on March 21st, the curtain was rung up for
a great drama, in which the Australian troops were destined to play
no subordinate part.</p>
<p>There followed many weeks of crowded and strenuous days, and the
story of this time must, of necessity, assume the form of a
personal narrative. Events followed one upon the other so rapidly,
and the centre of interest changed so quickly from place to place
and from hour to hour, that no recital except that of the future
historian writing with a wealth of collected material at his
disposal, could take upon itself any other guise than that of a
record of individual experience.</p>
<p>The Germans attacked the front of the Fifth British Army on
March 21st. The information which was at the disposal of our High
Command was not of such a nature that the promulgation of it would
have been calculated to elevate the spirits of the Army;
consequently Divisions situated as we were, in Reserve, and, for
the time being, entirely out of the picture, had to depend for our
news partly upon rumour, which was always unreliable, and partly
upon severely censored communiqu&eacute;s, framed so as to allay
public anxiety. Nothing definite emerged from such sources, except
that things were going ill and that fighting was taking place on
ground far behind what had been our front line near St. Quentin.
This hint was enough to justify the expectation that my Division
would not be left for long unemployed; and on the same day, March
21st, instructions were issued for all units to prepare for a move,
to dump unessential baggage, to rill up all mobile supplies, and to
stand by in readiness to march at a few hours' notice.</p>
<p>Orders came to move on March 22nd. The Division was to move
<em>east</em>, that is, back into Flanders, and not south to the
Somme Valley, as all had hoped. The prescribed move duly started,
but by March 24th had been arrested, for orders had come to cancel
the move and await fresh orders. Advanced parties, for billeting
duty, were to proceed next morning by motor lorry to Doullens, and
there await orders. Later came detailed instructions that the
Division was to be transferred from the Australian Corps to the
Tenth Corps, which latter was to be G.H.Q. Reserve, and that the
whole Division was to be moved the next night to the Doullens *
area, the dismounted troops by rail, and the Artillery and other
mounted units by route-march.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The majority of the place-names mentioned in the
remainder of this chapter will be found on Maps A or J.]</p>
<p>It was evident that the plans of the High Command were the
subject of rapid changes, in sympathy, probably, with fluctuations
in the situation, which were not ascertainable by me. There
followed a night and day of strenuous activity, during which
arrangements were completed to entrain the three Infantry Brigades
and the Pioneers at three different railway stations, to start off
the whole of the mounted units on their long march by road, and to
ensure that all fighting troops were properly equipped with
munitions, food and water, all ready for immediate employment. It
was well that my Staff responded capably to the heavy demands made
upon them, and that all this preparatory work was efficiently
done.</p>
<p>The entrainments commenced at midnight on the 25th and continued
all night. At break of day on the 26th, after assuring myself that
everyone was correctly on the move, I proceeded south by motor-car,
in the endeavour to find the Tenth Corps Headquarters, and to
report to them for orders. My fruitless search of that forenoon
revealed to me the first glimpse of the true reason for that
far-reaching disorganization and confusion which confronted me
during the next twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Over three years of trench warfare had accustomed the whole Army
to fixed locations for all Headquarters, and to settled routes and
lines of inter-communication. The powerful German onslaught and the
recoil of a broad section of our fighting front had suddenly
disturbed the whole of this complex organization. The Headquarters
of Brigades, Divisions, and even Corps, ceased to have fixed
locations where they could be found, or assured lines of telegraph
or telephone communications, by which they could be reached.
Everything was in a state of flux, and the process of getting into
personal contact with each other suddenly took responsible leaders
hours where it had previously taken minutes.</p>
<p>In its broad result, this disorganization affected most
seriously the retiring troops, by depriving them of the advantages
of rapidly disseminated orders for properly co-ordinated action by
a large number of Corps and Divisions withdrawing side by side. The
consequence was, I am convinced, that the recoil&mdash;which may
have been inevitable at first by reason of the intensity of the
German attack, and because the defensive organization of the Fifth
Army had been unduly attenuated&mdash;was allowed to extend over a
much greater distance, and to continue for longer, in point of
time, than ought to have been the case.</p>
<p>Between Albert and St. Quentin there were in existence several
lines of defence, which by reason of their topographical features,
or the existence of trenches and entanglements, were eminently
suitable for making a stand. Yet no stand was made, at any rate on
a broad front, because there was no co-ordination in the spasmodic
attempts to do so. I subsequently learned of more than one instance
where Brigades of Infantry or of Artillery found themselves
perfectly well able to hold on, but were compelled to a continued
retirement by the melting away of the units on their flanks.</p>
<p>I sought the Tenth Corps at Hautcloque, where they were to be.
They were not there. I proceeded to Frevent, where they were said
to have been the night before. They had already left. In despair, I
proceeded to Doullens, resolved at least to ensure the orderly
detrainment of my Division and their quartering for the following
night, and there to await further orders. A despatch rider was sent
off to G.H.Q. to report my whereabouts, and the fact that I was
without orders.</p>
<p>Arriving at Doullens, I tumbled into a scene of indescribable
confusion. The population were preparing to evacuate the town <i>en
masse</i>, and an exhausted and hungry soldiery was pouring into
the town from the east and south-east, with excited tales that the
German cavalry was on their heels. Influenced by the persistency of
these reports, I determined to make, immediately, dispositions to
cover the detrainment of my troops, so that some show of resistance
could be made.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this stress and anxiety, I was favoured by a
run of good luck. Within half an hour of my reaching Doullens, the
first of my railway trains arrived, bringing Brigadier-General
Rosenthal and a battalion of the 9th Brigade, sufficient troops, at
any rate, to furnish a strong outpost line for covering the eastern
approaches of Doullens, while the remainder of the Brigade should
arrive. These arrangements made, I motored to Mondicourt, where
almost immediately afterwards a train arrived, bringing
Brigadier-General McNicoll and the first battalion of the 10th
Brigade.</p>
<p>There also arrived, almost simultaneously, that rumour with the
ridiculous <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, that German armoured
motor-cars were approaching along the road from Albert and were
within three miles of that point. Those Armoured Cars proved
ultimately to be a train of French agricultural implements which a
wheezy and rumbling traction engine was doing its best to salve.
McNicoll likewise received orders to put out a line of outposts to
cover Mondicourt railway station.</p>
<p>At this point, too, endless streams of dust-begrimed soldiers
were straggling westwards. McNicoll collected many hundreds of
them, and did not omit, by very direct methods, to prevail upon all
of them who had not yet lost their rifles and essential equipment,
to call a halt and join his own troops in the defensive
dispositions which he was making.</p>
<p>My next business was to select a suitable central point at which
to establish my Headquarters, preferably where I could find a still
intact telephone service. Again by good luck I found a most
suitable location in a small ch&acirc;teau at Couturelle, whose
owner hospitably provided a much needed meal.</p>
<p>It was there, soon after my arrival, that I learned of the
presence in the neighbourhood of Major-General Maclagan; this news,
implying as it did the presence also of some at least of the Fourth
Australian Division, was a gleam of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy
prospect. Report said that he was at Basseux, and thither I
proceeded, in order to arrange, by personal conference with him,
some plan for co-ordinated action.</p>
<p>Basseux rests on the main road from Doullens to Arras, which
lies roughly parallel to the line along which, as subsequently
transpired, the vanguard of the enemy was endeavouring to advance
at that part of the front. That main road I found packed, for the
whole of the length which I had to traverse, with a steadily
retreating collection of heterogeneous units, service vehicles and
guns of all imaginable types and sizes, intermingled with hundreds
of civilian refugees, and farm waggons, carts, trollies and barrows
packed high with pathetic loads of household effects. The
retrograde movement was orderly and methodical enough, and there
was nothing in the nature of a rout, but it was nevertheless a
determined movement to the rear which evidenced nothing but a
desire to keep moving.</p>
<p>I found Maclagan at about four o'clock. His Division had already
been on the move, by bus and route march, for three days without
rest. The position to the east and south-east of him was obscure,
and he also had posted a line of outposts in the supposed direction
of the enemy, and was arranging to despatch his 4th Brigade to
Hebuterne (which the enemy was reported to have entered), with
orders to recapture that town. That the enemy was not very far away
became evident from the fact that the vicinity of the hut in which
we were conferring presently came under desultory long-range
shell-fire.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done except to arrange jointly to keep
up an effective and as far as possible continuous line of outposts
towards the south-east, and to await developments. Having made
these arrangements I returned along the same crowded road, which
was now also being leisurely shelled by the enemy, to Couturelle.
There I found that the principal officers of my Staff had
arrived.</p>
<p>Thereupon orders were issued for the concentration, after
detrainment, of my three Brigades in the following areas, each with
due outpost precautions, viz.: 9th Brigade at Pas, 10th Brigade at
Authie, and 11th Brigade at Couin. My Artillery was still distant a
full day's march by road.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock that evening I received, by telephone, my
first order from the Tenth Corps. It ran as follows: "A Staff
Officer has left some time ago on his way to you, carrying
instructions for you to report personally at once to Corbie for
orders. We have since heard that you are to go to Montigny
instead."</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour before the Staff Officer arrived, having
been delayed on the road by congestion of traffic. The instructions
he carried transferred my Division from the Tenth to the Seventh
Corps, to whom I was to report personally, without delay, at
Corbie. It was evident from the later telephone message that the
Seventh Corps had been compelled to withdraw from Corbie, and was
proceeding to Montigny.</p>
<p>This was the second stroke of good luck that day; for if the
telephone message above recited had not overtaken the Staff
Officer, it is quite probable that I should have already started
for a wrong destination, and have had to waste valuable time at a
most critical juncture. Had I failed to find General Congreve, the
Seventh Corps Commander, <i>that same night</i>, it is almost
certain that my Division would have arrived on the Somme too late
to prevent the capture of Amiens.</p>
<p>Setting out from Couturelle shortly after ten o'clock that
night, accompanied by four of my Staff and two despatch-riders,
with two motor-cars and two motor cycles, in black darkness, on
unfamiliar roads congested with refugee traffic, I did not reach
Montigny until after midnight. I found General Congreve in the
corner of a bare salon of stately proportions, in a deserted
ch&acirc;teau by the roadside, seated with his Chief of Staff at a
small table, and examining a map by the flickering light of a
candle. The rest of the ch&acirc;teau was in darkness, but heaps of
hastily dumped Staff baggage impeded all the corridors.</p>
<p>General Congreve was brief and to the point. What he said
amounted to this: "At four o'clock to-day my Corps was holding a
line from Albert to Bray, when the line gave way. The enemy is now
pushing westwards and if not stopped to-morrow will certainly
secure all the heights overlooking Amiens. What you must try and do
is to get your Division deployed across his path. The valleys of
the Ancre and the Somme offer good points for your flanks to rest
upon. You must, of course, get as far east as you can, but I know
of a good line of old trenches, which I believe are still in good
condition, running from M&eacute;ricourt-l'Abb&eacute; towards
Sailly-le-Sec. Occupy them, if you can't get further east."</p>
<p>At that juncture General Maclagan arrived and received similar
crisp orders to bring his Division into a position of support on
the high land in the bend of the Ancre to the west of Albert. I
gleaned further that the Seventh Corps was now the south flank
Corps of the Third Army, and that as the Fifth Army, south of the
Somme, had practically melted away, while the French were retiring
south-westerly and leaving an hourly increasing gap between their
north flank and the Somme, General Byng had resolved to make every
effort not only to maintain the flank of his Third Army on the
Somme, but also to prevent it being turned from the south, while
the Commander-in-Chief was taking other measures to attempt next
day to fill the gap above alluded to.</p>
<p>It was already 1 a.m. of March 27th, and I had left my Division
twenty miles away. Everything depended now on quick decision and
faultless executive action. It was fortunate that a telephone line
to G.H.Q. had been found in good working order, and that the
services of three large motor bus convoys could be arranged for to
proceed at once to the Doullens area, in order to transport my
Infantry during the night to the place appointed. I worked with my
Staff till nearly break of day, considering and settling all
detailed arrangements, and we then separated in various directions
to our appointed tasks.</p>
<p>I proceeded myself a little after dawn, with one Staff Officer,
to Franvillers, which had been decided upon as the point for
leaving the buses. There was yet no sign of any Australian troops,
and the village was being hastily evacuated by the terror-stricken
inhabitants. But there were ample and visible signs, far away on
the high plateau beyond the Ancre Valley, that the German line of
skirmishers was already on the move, slowly driving back the few
troops of British Cavalry who were, most valiantly, trying to delay
their advance.</p>
<p>The next hour was one of intense suspense and expectancy; but my
anxiety was relieved when there rolled into the village from the
north, a motor bus convoy of thirty vehicles, crowded with good
staunch Australian Infantry of the 11th Brigade, and bringing also
Brigadier-General Cannan and some of his Brigade Staff. It was not
the first time in the war that the London motorbus&mdash;after
abandoning the population of the great metropolis to enforced
pedestrianism&mdash;had helped to save a most critical
situation.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after, there arrived McNicoll, with a
battalion of his 10th Brigade. Hour after hour a steady stream of
omnibus convoys came in. No time was lost in assembling the troops,
and in directing the Infantry&mdash;company after
company&mdash;down the steep, winding road to the little village of
Heilly, and thence across the Ancre, to deploy on the selected line
of defence indicated in the orders above recited.</p>
<p>The spectacle of that Infantry will be ever memorable to me, as
one of the most inspiring sights of the whole war. Here was the
Third Division&mdash;the "new chum" Division, which, in spite of
its great successes in Belgium and Flanders, had never been able to
boast, like its sister Divisions, that it had been "down on the
Somme"&mdash;come into its own at last, and called upon to prove
its mettle. And then there was the thought that they were going to
measure themselves, man to man, against an enemy who, skulking
behind his field works, had for so long pounded them to pieces in
their trenches, poisoned them with gas, and bombed them as they
slept in their billets.</p>
<p>That, at any rate, was the point of view of the private soldier,
and no one who saw those battalions, in spite of the fatigue of two
sleepless nights, marching on that crisp, clear spring morning,
with head erect and the swing and precision of a Royal review
parade, could doubt that not a man of them would flinch from any
assault that was likely to fall upon them. Nor was there a man who
did not fully grasp that upon him and his comrades was about to
fall the whole responsibility of frustrating the German attempt to
capture Amiens and separate the Allied Armies.</p>
<p>By midday, the situation was already well in hand, and by four
o'clock I was able to report to the Seventh Corps that no less than
six Battalions were already deployed, astride of the triangle
formed by the Ancre and the Somme, on the line
M&eacute;ricourt-Sailly-le-Sec, distributed in a series of
"localities" defended by rifles and Lewis guns. As yet no Artillery
was available.</p>
<p>The 11th Brigade occupied this line to the south of the main
road from Corbie to Bray, the 10th Brigade continued it to the
north of the road, while the 9th Brigade was leaving the buses and
assembling in the neighbourhood of Heilly.</p>
<p>So far, the pressure of the enemy upon my front had not been
serious. It was obvious that he had, as yet, very little Artillery
at his disposal. We had not, however, found our front totally
devoid of defenders. During the forenoon, a few troops of our
cavalry, and a force under Brigadier-General Cummings, comprising
about 1,500 mixed infantry, the remnants of a large number of
different units of the Third Army, were slowly withdrawing under
pressure from the advancing German patrols. These valiant
"die-hards", deserving of the greatest praise in comparison with
the many thousands of their comrades who had withdrawn from any
further attempt to stem the onflowing tide, were now ordered to
retire through my outpost line, thus leaving the Australian
Infantry at last face to face with the enemy.</p>
<p>These dispositions were completed only in the nick of time. All
that afternoon the enemy appeared over the sky-line in front of us,
both in lines of skirmishers and in numerous small patrols,
endeavouring to work forward in the folds of the ground, and to
sneak towards us in the gullies. But all of them were received with
well directed rifle fire and the enemy suffered many losses.
Towards nightfall the attempts to continue his advance died
away.</p>
<p>That was, literally, the end of the great German advance in this
part of the field, and although, as will be told later, the enemy
renewed the attempt on several subsequent occasions to reach
Amiens, he gained not a single inch of ground, but, on the
contrary, was compelled in front of us to undertake a slow but
steady retrograde movement.</p>
<p>Our reconnoitring patrols discovered, however, that the enemy
already had possession of the village of Sailly-Laurette, and of
Marett and Treux Woods, but that he was not yet in great strength
on the crest of the plateau. Orders were issued to perfect the
organization of our defensive line, put out wire entanglements,
dig-in machine guns, and rest the troops in relays during the
coming night, but not to attempt any forward movement until the
next night.</p>
<p>My Artillery and other mounted units were still half a day's
march away; but Brigadier-General Grimwade, their Commander, had
been instructed to push on in advance, with the whole of the
Commanders of his Brigades and Batteries. They arrived on the scene
in sufficient time to enable the whole situation to be examined in
the daylight, and for detailed action to be decided upon. The
Artillery kept coming in during the whole of the following night,
and although men and horses were almost exhausted after two days of
forced marching, their spirits were never higher. Next morning
found the guns already in action, and engaging all bodies of the
enemy who dared to expose themselves to view.</p>
<p>I must now turn to the Fourth Australian Division. They had been
less fortunate in several respects. Maclagan was directed to leave
behind his 4th Brigade, which had on the 26th speedily become
committed to important operations under the 62nd Division in front
of Hebuterne, from which village this Brigade had driven the enemy.
This left him with only two Brigades, the 12th and 13th. He was
faced with the obligation of bringing his already over-tired
infantry, by route march, down from the Basseux area, to the high
ground west and south-west of Albert. That town had fallen and the
situation there had, by the 26th, also become very critical.</p>
<p>This march was, however, accomplished in strict accordance with
orders, and was a remarkable feat of endurance by the troops of the
12th and 13th Brigades. There can be no doubt, however, that the
effort was more than justified, for the mere presence, in a
position of readiness, of these two Australian Brigades, did much
to steady the situation opposite Albert, by heartening the line
troops and stimulating their Commanders to hang on for a little
longer. It was this last effort which brought to a standstill the
German advance north of the Ancre, as the entry of the Third
Division had stopped that to the south of that river.</p>
<p>After his two Brigades had had only four hours' rest, Maclagan
took over, with them, the control of the fighting front, opposite
Dernancourt and Albert, which the Seventh Corps had allotted to
him.</p>
<p>Thus, by the night of the 27th, as the result of the rapid
movements which I have described and the ready response of the
troops, there was already in position the nucleus of a stout
defence by five Australian Brigades, stretching almost continuously
from Hebuterne to the Somme, while another Australian Brigade, the
9th, remained still uncommitted.</p>
<p>But the situation south of the Somme gave cause for the gravest
anxiety. The north flank of the French was hourly retiring in a
south-westerly direction, and the ever widening gap was filled only
by a scratch force of odd units supported and assisted by a few
elements of the First Cavalry Division. The right flank of our
Third Army, therefore, lay exposed to the danger of being turned,
if the enemy should succeed in pressing his advantage as far west
as Corbie, and in crossing the river at or west of that town.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that, after a conference with General
Congreve, late in the day, I decided to deploy my 9th Brigade along
the Somme from Sailly-le-Sec westward as far as
Aubigny,**&mdash;far too extended a front for one Brigade, but at
least an effort to dispute the passage by the enemy of the existing
bridges and lock-gates over the Somme.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Two miles west of Corbie.]</p>
<p>The two following days were full of toil and hard travelling in
establishing touch with Divisional Headquarters to the north and
south of me, in arranging for co-ordinated action with them, and in
gleaning all possible information as to the situation, and as to
the number and condition of other troops available in an
emergency.</p>
<p>It was an especial pleasure for the Australian troops to find
themselves fighting in these days in close association with famous
British Cavalry Regiments, and that these feelings were
reciprocated may be gathered from the following letter from
Major-General Mullens, who commanded the First Cavalry Division,
which was devoting its energies to covering the gap between the
Somme and the French flank:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1"><small>"MY DEAR MONASH</small>,</p>
<p class="indent1">"I was hoping to have come to see you, when the
battle allowed, to thank you, your Artillery Commander, and your
Brigadiers who were alongside of my Division, for your most
valuable and encouraging support and assistance, especially on the
30th March, when we had a hard fight to keep the Bosche out of our
position. I was very much struck by the courtesy of yourself and
your officers in coming to see me personally, and for your own and
their keen desire to do everything in their power to help. As you
know, we had a curious collection of units to deal with, and it was
a very real relief to know that I had your stout-hearted fellows on
my left flank and that all worry was therefore eliminated as to the
safety of my flanks. Your order for the placing of your heavy guns
and batteries so as to cover my front was of very real assistance,
and incidentally they killed a lot of Huns, and what they did was
much appreciated by us all. Will you convey to all concerned my own
appreciation, and that of all ranks of the 1st Cavalry Division. It
was a pleasure and an honour to be fighting alongside troops who
displayed such magnificent <i>moral</i>. I only hope we may have
the chance of co-operating with you again, and under more
favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>On the night of March 29th I advanced my line, pivotting on my
right, until my left rested on the Ancre east of Buire, an extreme
advance of over 2,000 yards, meeting some opposition and taking a
few prisoners. This deprived the enemy of over a mile of valuable
vantage ground on the crest of the plateau along which ran the main
road from Corbie to Bray.</p>

<br>
<p>By that time it was apparent that the enemy's Artillery
resources were hourly accumulating, and on the next afternoon he
delivered a determined attack along my whole front, employing two
Divisions. The attack was completely repelled, with an estimated
loss to the enemy of at least 3,000 killed. My Artillery were
firing over open sights and had never in their previous experience
had such tempting targets.</p>
<p>On the previous day, however, the situation between the Somme
and Villers-Bretonneux, and still further to the south, had become
desperate; and much to my discomfiture I was ordered to hand over
my 9th Brigade (Rosenthal) for duty with the 61st Division, in
order to reinforce that dissolving sector. My importunity as to the
necessity for maintaining the defence of my river flank, however,
led the Seventh Corps Commander to let me have, in exchange, the
15th Brigade (Elliott), which was the first Brigade of the Fifth
Australian Division to arrive from Flanders on the present scene of
operations. This interchange of Brigades was completed by the
30th.</p>
<p>That day was further marked by a concentrated bombardment of the
village of Franvillers, in which I had established my Headquarters.
Although no serious loss was suffered, the responsible work of my
Staff was disturbed. On reporting the occurrence to General
Congreve, he insisted upon my moving my Headquarters back to St.
Gratien, which move was completed the next day.</p>
<p>On April 4th the enemy attacked, in force, south of the Somme,
and the village of Hamel was lost to us by the rout of the remnants
of a very exhausted British Division which had been sent in the
night before to defend it. This success gave the enemy a footing
upon a portion of Hill 104, and brought him to the eastern
outskirts of Villers-Bretonneux. Three months later it cost the
Australian Corps a concentrated effort to compel him to surrender
these advantages.</p>
<p>One last and final attempt to break through the Australian
phalanx north of the Somme was made by the enemy on April 5th. The
full weight of this blow fell chiefly upon the gallant Fourth
Australian Division. The battle of Dernancourt will live long in
the annals of military history as an example of dogged and
successful defence. The whole day long the enemy expended Division
after Division in the vain endeavour to compel two weak Australian
Brigades to loosen their hold on the important high ground lying
west of Albert. He well knew that the capture by him of these
heights involved the inevitable withdrawal of the Third Australian
Division also, and that thereby the path to Amiens would again lie
open.</p>
<p>The great German blow against the important railway centre of
Amiens had been parried, and from this time onwards interest in
this sphere of operations rapidly waned. It blazed up again for a
few hours only when, three weeks later, the enemy made his final
attempt to reach his goal, on this occasion by way of
Villers-Bretonneux. North of the Somme, his activity quickly died
down, and the attitude of both combatants gradually assumed the old
familiar aspect of trench warfare, with its endless digging of
trenches, line behind line, its weary trench routine, and its
elaborate installation of permanent lines of communication and of
administrative establishments of all descriptions.</p>
<p>South of the Somme, the Fifth Australian Division came into the
line on April 5th, relieving a Cavalry Division on a frontage of
about 5,000 yards, and thereby obviating any further necessity for
the maintenance of my flank river defence. This duty had been
performed for me in succession by the 15th Australian, the 104th
Imperial and the 13th Australian Brigades (the latter then under
Glasgow). My 9th Brigade still remained detached from me, operating
under both the 18th and 61st British Divisions, and performed
prodigies of valorous fighting in a series of desperate local
attacks and counter-attacks, which took place between
Villers-Bretonneux and Hangard, where the French northern flank
then lay. In this service the 9th Brigade received gallant
co-operation from the 5th Australian Brigade (of the 2nd Australian
Division), which was now also arriving in this area, after having
been relieved from trench garrison duty in the Messines-Warneton
sector in Flanders.</p>
<p>The Fifth Division and these two detached Brigades were, during
this period, serving under the Third Corps (Butler), which had been
reconstituted to fill the gap between the Somme and the flank of
the French Army. The First Australian Division was already well on
the way to follow the Second Division, when, on April 11th, it was
hurriedly re-transferred to Flanders to assist in stemming the new
German flood which was inundating the whole of that region, and
which was not arrested until it had almost reached Hazebrouck. This
task the First Australian Division performed most valiantly,
thereby upholding the reputation already earned by its younger
sister Divisions for a capacity for rapid, ordered movement and
decisive intervention at a critical juncture.</p>
<p>For some days there had been rumours that the Australian Corps
Headquarters would shortly be transferred to the Amiens area, and
would once again gather under its control the numerous elements of
the four Australian Divisions which were by now widely scattered,
and had been fighting under the orders of three different Army
Corps. There was the still more interesting and pregnant rumour
that General Lord Rawlinson&mdash;relinquishing his post of British
representative on the Supreme War Council at Versailles&mdash;was
soon to arrive and to form and command a reconstituted Fourth
British Army,* which was to be composed of the Australian and the
Third (British) Army Corps.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Fourth Army had disappeared when, in 1917,
General Rawlinson went to Versailles. The Fifth Army was not
revived until June, 1918.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<h4>THE DEFENCE OF AMIENS</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> Australian Corps Headquarters, under General
Birdwood, commenced its activities at Villers-Bocage on April 7th,
but soon after removed to the handsome seventeenth-century
Ch&acirc;teau at Bertangles, with its pleasant grounds and spacious
parks. One by one the detached Australian Brigades rejoined their
Divisions, and the Divisions themselves came back under the orders
of their own Corps.</p>
<p>The comparative calm which had supervened upon all the
excitement of the closing days of March and the first weeks of
April was rudely broken when, before daybreak on April 24th, the
enemy began a furious bombardment of the whole region extending
from opposite Albert to a point as far south as Hangard. It was
certain that this demonstration was the prelude of an infantry
attack in force, but it was not until well after midday that the
situation clarified, and it became known that the attack had been
confined to the country south of the Somme, that it had struck the
southern flank of the Fifth Australian Division, which had stood
firm and had thereby saved the loss of the remainder of the
tactically important Hill 104. But the town of Villers-Bretonneux,
lying beyond the Australian sector, had fallen and the Germans were
in possession of it.</p>
<p>It was imperative to retrieve this situation, or at least to
make an attempt to do so. The nearest available reserve Brigades of
Infantry were Australian, the 13th under Glasgow, and the 15th
under Elliott. They were placed under the orders of the Third
Corps, and by them directed to recapture the town.</p>
<p>Both Brigades had to make long marches to reach the
battleground. It was already dark before they had deployed on the
appointed lines of departure. The details of this enthralling and
wonderful night attack form too lengthy a story to find a place in
this brief narrative; suffice it to say that when the sun rose on
the third Anniversary of Anzac Day, it looked down upon the
Australians in full possession of the whole town, and standing upon
our original lines of twenty-four hours before, with nearly 1,000
German prisoners to their credit.</p>
<p>In this summary fashion, the last German attempt to split in two
the Allied Armies failed ignominiously, and the attempt was never
again renewed.</p>
<p>A comprehensive rearrangement of the whole Front in this
much-contested region then took place. The appointment of Marshal
Foch as Supreme Commander on the Western Front bore, as one of its
first fruits, a clear decision as to the final point of junction
between the French and the British Armies. This was fixed just
south of Villers-Bretonneux, and not at the Somme Valley, as was
thought desirable by some of the British Commanders.</p>
<p>The new Fourth Army became the flank British Army in contact
with the French. The Australian Corps became the south flank of
that Army. Its sector extended, from the point named, northwards as
far as the Ancre. The Third Corps was transferred to the north of
the Ancre, opposite Albert, and those two Corps comprised, for some
time to come, the whole of the Fourth Army resources.</p>
<p>The Australian Corps now organized its front with three
Divisions in line and one in reserve. My occupation, with the Third
Australian Division, of the original sector between the Ancre and
the Somme remained undisturbed, and my front line remained for a
time stationary on the alignment gained on March 29th.</p>
<p>But the Third Division had had enough of stationary warfare, and
the troops were athirst for adventure. They were tired of raids,
which meant a mere incursion into enemy territory, and a subsequent
withdrawal, after doing as much damage as possible.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I resolved to embark upon a series of minor
battles, designed not merely to capture prisoners and machine guns,
but also to hold on to the ground gained. This would invite
counter-attacks which I knew could only enhance the balance in our
favour, and would seriously disorganize the enemy's whole defensive
system, while wearing out his nerves and lowering the <i>moral</i>
of his troops.</p>
<p>Four such miniature battles ** were fought in rapid succession,
on April 30th and May 3rd, 6th and 7th, by the 9th and 10th
Brigades, who were then in line. These yielded most satisfactory
results. Not only did we capture several hundred prisoners and
numerous machine guns, but also advanced our whole line an average
total distance of a mile. This deprived the enemy of valuable
observation, and forced back his whole Artillery organization.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Map A.]</p>
<p>But these combats, and the numerous offensive patrol operations,
which were also nightly undertaken along my whole front, did a
great deal more. They yielded a constant stream of prisoners, who
at this stage of the war had become sufficiently demoralized by
their disappointments to talk freely, and impart a mass of valuable
information as to movements and conditions behind the German
lines.</p>
<p>The following list of 41 separate identifications, covering a
total of over 300 prisoners, represents the fruits of these efforts
during the period from March 27th to May 11th. From these it will
be seen that during these six weeks I had been confronted by no
less than six different German Divisions:</p>

<p>While I was thus exerting a steady pressure on the enemy and
gaining ground easterly, the Australian Corps line south of the
Somme remained stationary, and each successive advance north of the
river served only to accentuate the deep re-entrant which had been
formed on the day when the loss of Hamel forced the British front
line back along the Somme as far as Vaire-sous-Corbie.</p>
<p>While this was not very serious from the point of view of
observation, because I was in possession of much the higher ground,
and was able to look down, almost as upon a map, on to the enemy in
the Hamel basin, yet I was beginning to feel very seriously the
inconvenience of having, square on to my flank, such excellent
concealed Artillery positions as Vaire and Hamel Woods, which the
enemy did not long delay in occupying.</p>
<p>Moreover, the whole of the slopes of the valley on my side of
the river remained useless to me, because they were exposed to the
full view of the enemy, so long as he was permitted to occupy the
Hamel salient, which he had on April 5th driven into the very
middle of what was now the Corps front. I therefore made more than
one attempt to persuade the then Corps Commander to undertake an
operation for the elimination in whole or in part of this
inconvenient bend, but, for reasons doubtless satisfactory at that
time, he declined to accept the suggestion. It fell to my lot
myself to carry out this operation nearly two months later.</p>
<p>The Third Division was, however, relieved in the line by our
Second Division on May 11th, and was withdrawn for a short but
well-earned rest after six weeks of trench duty, following its
first fateful rush into the thick of the battle.</p>
<p>It was on May 12th that I received the first intimation from
General Sir William Birdwood that he was to be appointed to the
command of a new Fifth Army, which the British War Council had
decided to form, and that, upon his taking up these new duties, the
task of leading the Australian Army Corps would devolve upon
me.</p>
<p>In consequence of this and other changes, it was shortly
afterwards decided, in consultation, that Glasgow should take over
the command of the First Division, then still fighting at
Hazebrouck, that Rosenthal should command the Second Division, and
that Gellibrand should succeed me at the head of the Third
Division.</p>
<p>Far, therefore, from being permitted a little respite from the
strenuous labours of the preceding six weeks, I found myself
confronted with responsibilities which, in point of numbers alone,
exceeded sixfold those which I had previously had to bear, but
which, in point of difficulty, involved an even higher ratio.</p>
<p>There were numerous Arms and Services, under the Corps, with
whose detailed functions and methods of operation I had not been
previously concerned. The other Divisional Commanders had hitherto
been my colleagues, and I was now called upon to consider their
personalities and temperaments as my subordinates. There was a
vastly increased territory for whose administration and defence I
would become responsible. I had to be prepared to enter an
atmosphere of policy higher and larger than that which surrounded
me as the Commander of a Division. And finally there was the
selection of my new Staff.</p>

<p>My last executive work with the Third Division was the process
of putting this Division back into the line, this time in the
Villers-Bretonneux sector of our front. After handing over the
Division and all its outstanding current affairs to Major-General
Gellibrand, I assumed command of the Australian Army Corps on May
30th, with Brigadier-General Blamey as my Chief-of-Staff.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A farewell order to the Third Division was
issued in the following terms:<br>
<br>
"As I am about to take up other duties the time has come when I
must relinquish the command of the Division.<br>
<br>
"Closely associated with you as I have been, since the days of your
first assembly and War Training in <small>ENGLAND</small>, and,
later, throughout all your magnificent work during the past
nineteen months in the war zone, it is naturally a severe wrench
for me to part from you.<br>
<br>
"I find it quite impossible to give adequate expression to my
feelings of gratitude towards all ranks for the splendid and loyal
support which you have, at all times, accorded to me. I am deeply
indebted to my Staff, to all Commanders and to the officers and
troops of all Arms and Services for a whole-hearted co-operation
upon which, more than upon any other factor, the success of the
Division has depended.<br>
<br>
"It is my earnest hope, and also my sincere conviction, that the
fine spirit and the high efficiency of the Division will be
maintained under the leadership of my successor, Brigadier-General
Gellibrand; and if the men of the Division feel, as I trust they
do, an obligation to perpetuate for my sake the traditions built up
by them during the period of my command, they can do so in no
better way than by rendering to him a service as thorough and a
support as loyal as I have been privileged to enjoy at their
hands.<br>
<br>
"In formally wishing the Division good-bye and good luck, I wish
simply, but none the less sincerely, to thank each and all of you,
for all that you have done.</p>

<p>I very soon became aware that, as Corps Commander, I was
privileged to have access to a very large body of interesting
secret information, which was methodically distributed daily by
G.H.Q. Intelligence. This comprised detailed information of the
true facts of all happenings on the fronts of all the Allies, the
gist of the reports of our Secret Service, and very full
particulars from which the nature and distribution of the enemy's
military resources could be deduced with fair accuracy.</p>
<p>The numberings and locations of all his Corps and Divisions
actually in the front line, on all the Allied fronts, was, of
course, quite definitely known from day to day. The numberings of
all Formations lying in Reserve were known with equal certainty,
although their actual positions on any date were largely a matter
of deduction by expert investigators. Of particular importance were
the further deductions which could be drawn as to the condition of
readiness or exhaustion of such reserve Divisions, from known facts
as to their successive appearance and experiences on any active
battle front.</p>
<p>Our experts were thus able to classify the enemy Divisions, and
to determine from day to day the probable number, and even the
probable numberings, of fit Divisions actually available (after
one, or after two, or after three days) to reinforce any portion of
the front which was to be the object of an attack by us. They could
also compute the number of fit Divisions which the enemy had at his
disposal at any time for launching an offensive against us.</p>
<p>All such data had a very direct bearing, not only on the
probable course of the campaign in the immediate future, but also
upon the responsibility which always weighed upon a Corps Commander
of keeping his own sector in preparedness to meet an attack or to
prevent such an attack from coming upon him as a surprise. He must
therefore be alert to watch the signs and astute to read them
aright.</p>
<p>One striking feature of the information at our disposal during
the early part of June was the steady melting away of the enemy
reserves as the consequence of his resultless, even if locally
successful, assaults during the preceding two and a half months,
against Amiens, in Flanders, and on the Chemin des Dames. But it
was apparent that he still held formidable Reserves of Infantry,
and a practically intact Artillery, which he was bound to employ
for at least one great and final effort to gain a decision.</p>
<p>The junction of the French and British Armies still offered a
tempting point of weakness. As mine was now the flank British
Corps, in immediate contact with General Toulorge's 31st French
Corps, I could not afford to relax any of the precautions of
vigilance or preparation which had been initiated by my predecessor
for meeting such an attack. Consequently, during June, 1918, I
ordered on the part of all my line Divisions a maintenance of their
energetic efforts to perfect the defensive organizations. I also
undertook out of other Corps labour resources the development of
further substantial rear systems of defence, so that Amiens need
not, in the event of a renewed attack, be abandoned to its fate
without a prolonged struggle.</p>
<p>The First Australian Division was not yet a part of my new
Command, its continued presence in the Hazebrouck and Merris area,
under the Fifteenth Corps, being still considered indispensable. My
Corps front now extended over a total length of ten miles, and I
had but four Divisions at my disposal to defend it. Three Divisions
held the line, one to the north and two to the south of the Somme.
Only one Division at a time could therefore be permitted a short
rest, and this Division formed my only tactical reserve.</p>
<p>All this added to the anxieties of the situation, and focussed
the energies of the whole command on a constant scrutiny of all
signs and symptoms that the enemy might be preparing to deliver his
next blow against us. Active patrolling was maintained and
continued to yield a steady stream of prisoners. A well conceived
and planned minor enterprise by the Second Division, which was
carried out on June 10th, and was Rosenthal's first Divisional
operation, gave us possession of a further slice of the important
ridge between Sailly-Laurette and Morlancourt. It gained us 330
prisoners and 33 machine guns. But no sign of any preparations on
the part of the enemy for an attack upon us, in this zone, emerged
from the careful investigations which followed this operation.</p>
<p>The days passed and evidences increased that the enemy was now
beginning to devote his further attentions to the French front far
to the south of us. At any rate, he continued to leave us
unmolested, and the interrogations of our numerous prisoners all
confirmed the absence of any preparations for an attack.</p>
<p>The defensive attitude which the situation thus forced upon us
did not for long suit the present temper of the Australian troops,
and I sought for a promising enterprise on which again to test
their offensive power, on a scale larger than we had yet attempted
in the year's campaign. There had been no Allied offensive, of any
appreciable size, on any of our fronts, in any of the many theatres
of war, since the close of the Passchendaele fighting in the autumn
of 1917.</p>
<p>It was high time that the anxiety and nervousness of the public,
at the sinister encroachments of the enemy upon regions which he
had never previously trodden, should be allayed by a demonstration
that there was still some kick left in the British Army. It was
high time, too, that some Commanders on our side of No Man's Land
should begin to "think offensively", and cease to look over their
shoulders in order to estimate how far it still was to the
coast.</p>
<p>I was ambitious that any such kick should be administered,
first, at any rate, by the Australians. A visit which I was
privileged to pay to General Elles, Commander of the Tank Corps,
when he gave me a demonstration of the capacities of the newer
types of Tanks, only confirmed me in this ambition. Finally, the
Hamel re-entrant had for two months been, as I have already
explained, a source of annoyance and anxiety to me. It was for
these reasons that I resolved to propose an operation for the
recapture of Hamel, conditional upon being supplied with the
assistance of Tanks, a small increase of my Artillery and an
addition to my air resources.</p>
<p>I thereupon set about preparing a general plan for such a
battle, which was to be my first Corps operation. Having mentioned
the matter first verbally to Lord Rawlinson, he requested me to
submit a concrete proposal in writing. The communication is here
reproduced, and will serve to convey an idea of the complexities
involved in even so relatively small an undertaking:</p>
<p align="right">Australian
Corps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
21st June, 1918.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Fourth Army</i>.</p>
<p align="center"><small>HAMEL OFFENSIVE</small></p>
<p class="indent1">1. With reference to my proposal for an
offensive operation on the front of the "A" and "B" Divisions of
this Corps, with a view to the capture of <small>HAMEL</small>
Village and <small>VAIRE</small> and <small>HAMEL WOOD</small>,
etc., the accompanying map shows, in blue, the proposed ultimate
objective line. This line has been chosen as representing the
minimum operation that would appear to be worth undertaking, while
offering a prospect of substantial advantages.</p>
<p class="indent1">2. These advantages may be briefly summarized
thus:</p>
<p class="negindent2">(a) Straightening of our line.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(b) Shortening of our line.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(c) Deepening our forward defensive zone,
particularly east of Hill 104.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(d) Improvement of jumping-off position for
future operations.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(e) Advancement of our artillery, south of
the <small>SOMME</small>.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(f) Denial to enemy of observation of ground
near <small>VAUX-SUR-SOMME</small>, valuable for battery
positions.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(g) Facilitating subsequent further minor
advances north of the <small>SOMME</small>.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(h) Disorganization of enemy defences.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(i) Disorganization of possible enemy
offensive preparations.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(j) Inflicting losses on enemy personnel and
material.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(k) Improvement of our observation.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(l) Maintenance of our initiative on this
Corps front.</p>
<p class="indent1">3. The disadvantages are those arising from the
necessity of bringing into rapid existence a new defensive system
on a frontage of 7,000 yards and also the particular incidence, at
the present juncture, of the inevitable losses, small or large, of
such an operation in this Corps.</p>
<p class="indent1">4. In view of the unsatisfactory position of
Australian reinforcements, any substantial losses would precipitate
the time when the question of the reduction in the number of
Australian Divisions would have to be seriously considered. It is
for higher authority to decide whether a portion of the present
resources in Australian man-power in this Corps would be more
profitably ventured upon such an operation as this, which is in
itself a very attractive proposition, rather than to conserve such
resources for employment elsewhere.</p>
<p class="indent1">5. Detailed plans can only be prepared after I
have had conferences with representatives of all Arms and Services
involved, but the following proposals are submitted as the basis of
further elaboration:</p>
<p class="negindent2">(a) The operation will be primarily a Tank
operation&mdash;at least one and preferably two Battalions of Tanks
to be employed.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(b) The whole battle front will be placed
temporarily under command of one Divisional Commander&mdash;by a
temporary readjustment of inter-Divisional boundaries.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(c) The infantry employed will comprise one
Division plus a Brigade, <i>i.e</i>., 4 Infantry Brigades,
totalling, say, 7,500 bayonets; about one-half of this force to be
employed in the advance and the other half to hold our present
front defensively, taking over the captured territory within 48
hours after Zero.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Zero" refers to the day and hour, not yet
determined, on which the battle is to begin.]</p>
<p class="negindent2">(d) The action will be designed on lines to
permit of the Tanks effecting the capture of the ground; the
r&ocirc;les of the Infantry following the Tanks will be:<br>
(i) to assist in reducing strong points and localities.<br>
(ii) to "mop up".<br>
(iii) to consolidate the ground captured.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(e) Apart from neutralizing all enemy
artillery likely to engage our troops, our artillery will be
employed to keep under fire enemy centres of resistance and
selected targets&mdash;in front of the advance of the Tanks.
Artillery detailed for close targets will work on a prearranged and
detailed time-table which will be adjusted to the time-table of the
Tank and Infantry advance. Sufficient "silent" field artillery
supplied before the battle should be emplaced in advanced
positions, to ensure an effective protective barrage to cover
consolidation on the blue line,* and to engage all localities from
which enemy counter-attacks can be launched. It is estimated that,
in addition to the resources of the Corps, four Field Artillery
Brigades will be required for, say, four days in all.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Blue Line", arbitrarily so called, because this
line was drawn on the accompanying map in blue. It was to be the
final objective for the day.]</p>
<p class="negindent2">(f) Engineer stores in sufficient quantities
to provide for the complete organization of the new defences will
require to be dumped beforehand as far forward as practicable.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(g) No additional machine guns, outside of
Corps resources, will be required.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(h) Contact and counter-attack planes and
low-flying bombing planes prior to and during advance must be
arranged for.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(i) Artillery and mortar smoke to screen the
operations from view of all ground north of the Somme in the
<small>SAILLY-LAURETTE</small> locality are required.</p>
<p class="indent1">6. As to the date of the operations, the
necessary preparations will occupy at least seven days after
authority to proceed has been given. As an inter-Divisional relief
is planned to occur on June 28th-29th and 29th-30th, it would seem
that this operation cannot take place earlier than the first week
in July. The postponement of this relief would not be desirable for
several reasons.</p>
<p class="indent1">7. Valuable training in the joint action of
Tanks and Infantry can be arranged, probably in the territory west
of the <small>HALLUE</small> Valley&mdash;provided that one or two
Tank Companies can be detached for such a purpose. Thorough liaison
prior to and during the operation between all Tank and all Infantry
Commanders would have to be a special feature. For this reason only
Infantry units not in the line can be considered as available to
undergo the necessary preparation.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) <small>JOHN
MONASH</small>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Lieut.-General.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Cmdg. Australian Corps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Approval to these proposals was given without delay; the
additional resources were promised, and preparations for the battle
were immediately put in hand. As I hope, in a later context, to
attempt to describe the evolution of a battle plan, and the
comprehensive measures which are associated with such an
enterprise, it will not be necessary to do so here.</p>
<p>It was the straightening of the Corps front, as an essential
preliminary to any offensive operations on a still larger scale, to
be undertaken when the opportune moment should arrive, that made
the Hamel proposal tactically attractive; it was the availability
of an improved type of Tank that gave it promise of success,
without pledging important resources, or risking serious
losses.</p>
<p>The new Mark V. Tank had not previously been employed in battle.
It marked a great advance upon the earlier types. The epicyclic
gearing with which it was now furnished, the greater power of its
engines, the improved balance of its whole design gave it increased
mobility, facility in turning and immunity from foundering in
ground even of the most broken and uneven character. It could be
driven and steered by one man, where it previously took four; and
it rarely suffered suspended animation from engine trouble.</p>
<p>But, above all, the men of the Tank Corps had, by the training
which they had undergone, and by the spirited leadership of
Generals Elles, Courage, Hankey and other Tank Commanders, achieved
a higher standard of skill, enterprise and <i>moral</i>; they were
now, more than ever, on their mettle to uphold the prestige of the
Tank Corps.</p>
<p>All the same, the Tanks had become anathema to the Australian
troops. For, at Bullecourt more than a year before, they had failed
badly, and had "let down" the gallant Infantry, who suffered
heavily in consequence; a failure due partly to the mechanical
defects of the Tanks of those days, partly to the inexperience of
the crews, and partly to indifferent staff arrangements, in the
co-ordination of the combined action of the Infantry and the
Tanks.</p>
<p>It was not an easy problem to restore to the Australian soldier
his lost confidence, or to teach him the sympathetic dependence
upon the due performance by the Tanks of the r&ocirc;les to be
allotted to them, which was essential to a complete utilization of
the possibilities which were now opening up. That the Tanks,
appropriately utilized, were destined to exert a paramount
influence upon the course of the war, was apparent to those who
could envisage the future.</p>
<p>This problem was intensified because the battalions of the
Fourth Division who were to carry out the Infantry tasks at Hamel
were the very units who had undergone that unfortunate experience
at Bullecourt. But, on the principle of restoring the nerves of the
unseated rider by remounting him to continue the hunt, it was
especially important to wean the Fourth Division from their
prejudices.</p>
<p>Battalion after battalion of the 4th, 6th and 11th Brigades of
Infantry was brought by bus to Vaux, a little village tucked away
in a quiet valley, north-west of Amiens, there to spend the day at
play with the Tanks. The Tanks kept open house, and, in the
intervals of more formal rehearsals of tactical schemes of attack,
the Infantry were taken over the field for "joy rides", were
allowed to clamber all over the monsters, inside and out, and even
to help to drive them and put them through their paces. Platoon and
Company leaders met dozens of Tank officers face to face, and they
argued each other to a standstill upon every aspect that arose.</p>
<p>Set-piece man&oelig;uvre exercises on the scale of a battalion
were designed and rehearsed over and over again; red flags marked
enemy machine-gun posts; real wire entanglements were laid out to
show how easily the Tanks could mow them down; real trenches were
dug for the Tanks to leap and straddle and search with fire; real
rifle grenades were fired by the Infantry to indicate to the Tanks
the enemy strong points which were molesting and impeding their
advance. The Tanks would throw themselves upon these places, and,
pirouetting round and round, would blot them out, much as a man's
heel would crush a scorpion.</p>
<p>It was invaluable as mere training for battle, but the effect
upon the spirits of the men was remarkable. The fame of the Tanks,
and all the wonderful things they could do, spread rapidly
throughout the Corps. The "digger" took the Tank to his heart, and
ever after, each Tank was given a pet name by the Company of
Infantry which it served in battle, a name which was kept chalked
on its iron sides, together with a panegyric commentary upon its
prowess.</p>
<p>There remained, however, much to be arranged, and many difficult
questions to be settled, as regards the tactical employment of the
Tanks. I can never be sufficiently grateful to Brigadier-General
Courage, of the 5th Tank Brigade, for his diligent assistance, and
for his loyal acceptance of the onerous conditions which the
tactical methods that I finally decided upon imposed upon the
Tanks.</p>
<p>These methods involved two entirely new principles. Firstly,
each Tank was, for tactical purposes, to be treated as an Infantry
weapon; from the moment that it entered the battle until the
objective had been gained it was to be under the exclusive orders
of the Infantry Commander to whom it had been assigned.</p>
<p>Secondly, the deployed line of Tanks was to advance, <em>level
with the Infantry</em>, and pressing close up to the barrage. This,
of course, subjected the Tanks, which towered high above the heads
of the neighbouring infantry, to the danger of being struck by any
of our own shells which happened to fall a little short. Tank
experts, consulted beforehand, considered therefore that it was not
practicable for Tanks to follow close behind an artillery barrage.
The battle of Hamel proved that it was.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<h4>HAMEL</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> larger questions relating to the employment
of the Tanks at the battle of Hamel having been disposed of, the
remaining arrangements for the battle presented few novel aspects.
Their manner of execution, however, brought into prominence some
features which became fundamental doctrines in the Australian Corps
then and thereafter.</p>
<p>Although complete written orders were invariably prepared and
issued by a General Staff whose skill and industry left nothing to
be desired, very great importance was attached to the holding of
conferences, at which were assembled every one of the Senior
Commanders and heads of Departments concerned in the impending
operation. At these I personally explained every detail of the
plan, and assured myself that all present applied an identical
interpretation to all orders that had been issued.</p>
<p>Questions were invited; difficulties were cleared up; and the
conflicting views of the different services on matters of technical
detail were ventilated. The points brought to an issue were
invariably decided on the spot. The battle plan having been thus
crystallized, no subsequent alterations were permissible, under any
circumstances, no matter how tempting. This fixity of plan
engendered a confidence throughout the whole command which
facilitated the work of every Commander and Staff Officer. It
obviated the vicious habit of postponing action until the last
possible moment, lest counter orders should necessitate some
alternative action. It was a powerful factor in the gaining of
time, usually all too short for the extensive preparations
necessary.</p>
<p>The final Corps Conference for the battle of Hamel was held at
Bertangles on June 30th, and the date of the battle itself was
fixed for July 4th. This selection was prompted partly by the
desire to allow ample time for the completion of all arrangements;
but there were also sentimental grounds, because this was the
anniversary of the American national holiday, and a considerable
contingent of the United States Army was to co-operate in the
fight.</p>
<p>For some weeks previously the 33rd American Division, under
Major-General John Bell, had been training in the Fourth Army area,
and its several regiments had been distributed, for training and
trench experience, to the Australian and the III. Corps. I had
applied to the Fourth Army and had received approval to employ in
the battle a contingent equivalent in strength to two British
battalions, or a total of about 2,000 men, organized in eight
companies. The very proper condition was attached, however, that
these Americans should not be split up and scattered individually
among the Australians, but should fight at least as complete
platoons, under their own platoon leaders.</p>
<p>All went well until three days before the appointed date, when
General Rawlinson conveyed to me the instruction that, the matter
having been reconsidered, only 1,000 Americans were to be used.
Strongly averse, as I was, from embarrassing the Infantry plans of
General Maclagan, to whom I had entrusted the conduct of the actual
assault, it was not then too late to rearrange the
distribution.</p>
<p>The four companies of United States troops who, under this
decision, had to be withdrawn were loud in their lamentations, but
the remaining four companies were distributed by platoons among the
troops of the three Australian Brigades who were to carry out the
attack&mdash;each American platoon being assigned a definite place
in the line of battle. The dispositions of the main body of
Australian infantry were based upon this arrangement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, somewhere in the upper realms of high control,
a discussion must have been going on as to the propriety of after
all allowing any American troops at all to participate in the
forthcoming operations. Whether the objections were founded upon
policy, or upon an under-estimate of the fitness of these troops
for offensive fighting, I have never been able to ascertain; but,
to my consternation, I received about four o'clock on the afternoon
of July 3rd, a telephone message from Lord Rawlinson to the effect
that it had now been decided that no American troops were to be
used the next day.</p>
<p>I was, at the moment, while on my daily round of visits to
Divisions and Brigades, at the Headquarters of the Third Division,
at Glisy, and far from my own station. I could only request that
the Army Commander might be so good as to come at once to the
forward area and meet me at Bussy-les-Daours, the Headquarters of
Maclagan&mdash;he being the Commander immediately affected by this
proposed change of plan. In due course we all met at five o'clock,
Rawlinson being accompanied by Montgomery, his Chief-of-Staff.</p>
<p>It was a meeting full of tense situations&mdash;and of grave
import. At that moment of time, the whole of the Infantry destined
for the assault at dawn next morning, including those very
Americans, was already well on its way to its battle stations; the
Artillery was in the act of dissolving its defensive organization
with a view to moving forward into its battle emplacements as soon
as dusk should fall; I well knew that even if orders could still
with certainty reach the battalions concerned, the withdrawal of
those Americans would result in untold confusion and in dangerous
gaps in our line of battle.</p>
<p>Even had I been ready to risk the success of the battle by going
ahead without them, I could not afford to take the further risk of
the occurrence of something in the nature of an "international
incident" between the troops concerned, whose respective points of
view about the resulting situation could be readily surmised. So I
resolved to take a firm stand and press my views as strongly as I
dared; for even a Corps Commander must use circumspection when
presuming to argue with an Army Commander.</p>
<p>However, disguised in the best diplomatic language that I was
able to command, my representations amounted to this: firstly, that
it was already too late to carry out the order; secondly, that the
battle would have to go on either with the Americans participating,
or not at all; thirdly, that unless I were expressly ordered to
abandon the battle, I intended to go on as originally planned; and
lastly, that unless I received such a cancellation order before
6.30 p.m. it would in any case be too late to stop the battle, the
preliminary phases of which were just on the point of
beginning.</p>
<p>As always, Lord Rawlinson's charming and sympathetic personality
made it easy to lay my whole case before him. He was good enough to
say that while he entirely agreed with me, he felt himself bound by
the terms of a clear order from the Commander-in-Chief. My last
resource, then, was to urge the argument that I felt perfectly sure
that the Commander-in-Chief when giving such an order could not
have had present to his mind the probability that compliance with
it meant the abandonment of the battle, and that, under the
circumstances, it was competent for the senior Commander on the
spot to act in the light of the situation as known to him, even to
the extent of disobeying an order.</p>
<p>Rawlinson agreed that this view was correct provided the
Commander-in-Chief was not accessible for reference. Repeated
attempts to raise General Headquarters from Bussy eventually
elicited the information that the Field Marshal was then actually
on his way from Versailles, and expected to arrive in half an hour.
Thereupon Rawlinson promised a decision by 6.30, and we separated
to rejoin our respective Headquarters.</p>
<p>In due course, the Army Commander telephoned that he had
succeeded in speaking to the Field Marshal, who explained that he
had directed the withdrawal of the Americans in deference to the
wish of General Pershing, but that, as matters stood, he now wished
everything to go on as originally planned. And so&mdash;the crisis
passed as suddenly as it had appeared. For, to me it had taken the
form of a very serious crisis, feeling confident as I did of the
success of the forthcoming battle, and of the far-reaching
consequences which would be certain to follow. It appeared to me at
the time that great issues had hung for an hour or so upon the
chance of my being able to carry my point.</p>
<p>An interesting episode, intimately bound up with the story of
this battle, was the visit to the Corps area on July 2nd of the
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, Mr. W.M. Hughes, and Sir Joseph
Cook, the Minister of the Navy. They arrived all unconscious of the
impending enterprise, but only by taking them fully into my
confidence could I justify my evident pre-occupation with other
business of first-class importance. Most readily, however, did they
accommodate themselves to the exigencies of the situation.</p>
<p>Both Ministers accompanied me that afternoon on a tour of
inspection of the eight battalions who were then already parading
in full battle array, and on the point of moving off to the
assembly positions from which next day they would march into
battle. The stirring addresses delivered to the men by both
Ministers did much to hearten and stimulate them. As they were on
their way to an Inter-Allied War Council at Versailles, the
personal contact of the Ministers with the actual battle
preparations had the subsequent result of focussing upon the
outcome of the battle a good deal of interest on the part of the
whole War Council.</p>
<p>The fixing of the exact moment for the opening of a battle has
always been the subject of much controversy. As in many other
matters, it becomes in the end the responsibility of one man to
make the fatal decision. The Australians always favoured the break
of day, as this gave them the protection of the hours of darkness
for the assembly of the assaulting troops in battle order in our
front trenches. But there must be at least sufficient light to see
one's way for two hundred yards or so, otherwise direction is lost
and confusion ensues.</p>
<p>The season of the year, the presence and altitude of the moon,
the prospect of fog or ground mist, the state of the weather, and
the nature and condition of the ground are all factors which affect
the proper choice of the correct moment. To aid a decision, careful
observations were usually made on three or four mornings preceding
the chosen day. A new factor on this occasion was the strong appeal
by the Tanks for an extra five minutes of dawning light, to ensure
a true line of approach upon the allotted objective, whether a
ruined village, or a thicket, or a field work.</p>
<p>The decision actually given by me was that "Zero" would be ten
minutes past three, and every watch had been carefully synchronized
to the second, to ensure simultaneous action. A perfected modern
battle plan is like nothing so much as a score for an orchestral
composition, where the various arms and units are the instruments,
and the tasks they perform are their respective musical phrases.
Every individual unit must make its entry precisely at the proper
moment, and play its phrase in the general harmony. The whole
programme is controlled by an exact time-table, to which every
infantryman, every heavy or light gun, every mortar and machine
gun, every tank and aeroplane must respond with punctuality;
otherwise there will be discords which will impair the success of
the operation, and increase the cost of it.</p>
<p>The morning of July 4th was ushered in with a heavy ground mist.
This impeded observation and made guidance difficult, but it
greatly enhanced the surprise. The unexpected occurrence of this
fog lessened the importance of the elaborate care which had been
taken to introduce into the Artillery barrage a due percentage of
smoke shell, and to form smoke screens by the use of mortars on the
flanks of the attack. But the fog largely accounted for the cheap
price at which the victory was bought.</p>
<p>No battle within my previous experience, not even Messines,
passed off so smoothly, so exactly to time-table, or was so free
from any kind of hitch. It was all over in ninety-three minutes. It
was the perfection of team work. It attained all its objectives;
and it yielded great results. The actual assault was delivered,
from right to left, by two battalions of the 6th Brigade, three
battalions of the 4th Brigade, and three battalions of the 11th
Brigade. It was also part of the plan that advantage was taken by a
battalion of the 15th Brigade to snatch from the enemy another
slice of territory far away in the Ancre Valley, opposite
Dernancourt, and so, by extending the battle front, further to
distract him.</p>
<p>The attack was a complete surprise, and swept without check
across the whole of the doomed territory. Vaire and Hamel Woods
fell to the 4th Brigade, while the 11th Brigade, with its allotted
Tanks, speedily mastered Hamel Village itself. The selected
objective line was reached in the times prescribed for its various
parts, and was speedily consolidated. It gave us possession of the
whole of the Hamel Valley, and landed us on the forward or eastern
slope of the last ridge, from which the enemy had been able to
overlook any of the country held by us.</p>
<p>Still more important results were that we gathered in no less
than 1,500 prisoners, and killed and disabled at least as many
more, besides taking a great deal of booty, including two field
guns, 26 mortars and 171 machine guns&mdash;at a cost to us of less
than 800 casualties of all kinds, the great majority of whom were
walking wounded. The Tanks fulfilled every expectation, and the
suitability of the tactics employed was fully demonstrated. Of the
60 Tanks utilized, only 3 were disabled, and even these 3 were
taken back to their rallying points under their own power the very
next night. Their moral effect was also proved, and, with the
exception of a few enemy machine-gun teams, who bravely stood their
ground to the very last, most of the enemy encountered by the Tanks
readily surrendered.</p>
<p>Shortly after the battle, G.H.Q. paid the Australian Corps the
compliment of publishing to the whole British Army a General Staff
brochure,** containing the complete text of the orders, and a full
and detailed description of the whole of the battle plans and
preparations, with an official commentary upon them. The last
paragraph of this document, which follows, expresses tersely the
conclusions reached by our High Command:</p>
<p class="foot">[** Staff-Sheet No. 218: "Operations of the
Australian Corps against Hamel, etc.," published July, 1918.]</p>
<p class="negindent2">"81. The success of the attack was due:</p>
<p class="negindent2">(a) To the care and skill as regards every
detail with which the plan was drawn up by the Corps, Division,
Brigade and Battalion Staffs.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(b) The excellent co-operation between the
infantry, machine gunners, artillery, tanks and R.A.F.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(c) The complete surprise of the enemy,
resulting from the manner in which the operation had been kept
secret up till zero hour.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(d) The precautions which were taken and
successfully carried out by which no warning was given to the enemy
by any previous activity which was not normal.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(e) The effective counter-battery work and
accurate barrage.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(f) The skill and dash with which the tanks
were handled, and the care taken over details in bringing them up
to the starting line.</p>
<p class="negindent2">(g) Last, but most important of all, the
skill, determination and fine fighting spirit of the infantry
carrying out the attack."</p>
<br>
<p>Of the extent to which the tactical principles, and the methods
of preparation which had been employed at Hamel, came to be
utilized by other Corps in the later fighting of 1918 no reliable
record is yet available to me. But within the Corps itself this
comparatively small operation became the model for all enterprises
of a similar character, which it afterwards fell to the lot of the
Corps to carry out.</p>
<p>The operation was a small one, however, only by contrast with
the events which followed, although not in comparison with some of
the major operations which had preceded it&mdash;by reference to
the number of troops engaged, although not to the extent of
territory or booty captured. Although only eight Battalions (or the
equivalent of less than one Division) were committed in the actual
assault, the territory recovered was more than four times that
which was, in the pitched battles of 1917, customarily allotted as
an objective to a single Division. The number of prisoners in
relation to our own casualties was also far higher than had been
the experience of previous years. Both of these new standards which
had thus been set up may be regarded as flowing directly from the
employment of the Tanks.</p>
<p>Among other aspects of this battle which are worthy of mention
is the fact that it was the first occasion in the war that the
American troops fought in an offensive battle. The contingent of
them who joined us acquitted themselves most gallantly and were
ever after received by the Australians as blood brothers&mdash;a
fraternity which operated to great mutual advantage nearly three
months later.</p>
<p>This was the first occasion, also, on which the experiment was
made of using aeroplanes for the purpose of carrying and delivering
small-arms ammunition. The "consolidation" of a newly-captured
territory implies, in its broadest sense, its organization for
defence against recapture. For such a purpose the most rapidly
realizable expedient had been found to be the placing of a
predetermined number of machine guns in previously chosen
positions, arranged chequer-wise over the captured ground.
According to such a plan, suitable localities were selected by an
examination of the map and a specified number of Vickers
machine-gun crews were specially told off for the duty of making,
during the battle, by the most direct route, to the selected
localities, there promptly digging in, and preparing to deal with
any attempt on the part of the enemy to press a counter-attack.</p>
<p>The main difficulty affecting the use of machine guns is the
maintenance for them of a regular and adequate supply of
ammunition. Heretofore this function had to be performed by
infantry ammunition carrying parties. It required two men to carry
one ammunition box, holding a thousand rounds, which a machine gun
in action could easily expend in less than five minutes. Those
carrying parties had to travel probably not less than two to three
miles in the double journey across the open, exposed both to view
and fire. Casualties among ammunition carriers were always
substantial.</p>
<p>It was therefore decided to attempt the distribution of this
class of ammunition by aeroplane. Most of the machines of the Corps
Squadron were fitted with bomb racks and releasing levers. It
required no great ingenuity to adapt this gear for the carrying by
each plane of two boxes of ammunition simultaneously, and to
arrange for its release, by hand lever, at the appropriate time. It
remained to determine, by experiment, the correct size and mode of
attachment for a parachute for each box of ammunition, so that the
box would descend from the air slowly, and reach the ground without
severe impact.</p>
<p>It was Captain Wackett, of the Australian Flying Corps, who
perfected these ideas, and who trained the pilots to put them into
practice. Each machine-gun crew, upon reaching its appointed
locality, spread upon the ground a large V-shaped canvas (V
representing the word "Vickers") as an intimation to the air of
their whereabouts, and that they needed ammunition. After a very
little training, the air-pilots were able to drop this ammunition
from a height of at least 1,000 feet to well within 100 yards of
the appointed spot. In this way, at least 100,000 rounds of
ammunition were successfully distributed during this battle, with
obvious economy in lives and wounds. The method thus initiated
became general during later months.</p>
<p>The Corps also put into practice, on this occasion, a stratagem
which had frequently on a smaller scale been employed in connection
with trench raids. Our Artillery was supplied with many different
types of projectile, but among them were both gas shell and smoke
shell. The latter were designed to create a very palpable smoke
cloud, to be employed for the purpose of screening an assault, but
were otherwise harmless. The former burst, on the other hand, with
very little evolution of smoke, but with a pronounced and easily
recognized smell, and their gas was very deadly.</p>
<p>My practice was, therefore, during the ordinary harassing fire
in periods between offensive activities, always to fire both
classes of shell <em>together</em>, so that the enemy became
accustomed to the belief at the least that our smoke shells were
invariably accompanied by gas shell, even if he did not believe
that it was the smoke shell which alone gave out the warning smell.
The effect upon him of either belief was, however, the same; for it
compelled him in any case to put on his gas mask in order to
protect himself from gas poisoning.</p>
<p>On the actual battle day, however, we fired smoke shell
<em>only</em>, as we dared not vitiate the air through which our
own men would shortly pass. But the enemy had no rapid means of
becoming aware that we were firing only harmless smoke shell. He
would, therefore, promptly don his gas mask, which would obscure
his vision, hamper his freedom of action, and reduce his powers of
resistance. On July 4th both the 4th and 11th Brigades accordingly
took prisoner large numbers of men who were found actually wearing
their gas masks. The stratagem had worked out exactly as
planned.</p>
<br>
<p>The battle was over, and when the results were made known there
followed the inevitable flow of congratulatory messages from
superiors, and colleagues and friends, from all parts of the Front
and from England. The following telegrams received from the
Commonwealth Prime Minister were particularly gratifying:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">1. "On behalf of Prime Minister of Britain, and
also of Prime Ministers of Canada, New Zealand and Newfoundland,
attending <small>VERSAILLES</small> Council, I am commissioned to
offer you our warmest congratulations upon brilliant success of
Australian Forces under your command, and to say that the victory
achieved by your Troops is worthy to rank with greatest
achievements of Australian Armies."</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">2. "My personal congratulations and those of the
Government of Commonwealth on brilliant success of battle. Please
convey to Officers and Men participating in attack warmest
admiration of their valour and dash and manner in which they have
maintained highest traditions of Australian Army. I am sure that
achievement will have most considerable military and political
effect upon Allies and neutrals, and will heighten <i>moral</i> of
all Imperial Forces."</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">3. "In company with Mr. Lloyd George and General
Rawlinson to-day saw several hundred of prisoners taken by
Australian Troops in battle before Hamel. Rawlinson expressed to me
the opinion that the operation was a brilliant piece of work.
Please convey this to troops."</p>
<br>
<p>The following message transmitted to me by the Commander of the
Fourth Army was also received from the Field Marshal
Commanding-in-Chief:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">"Will you please convey to Lieutenant-General
Sir John Monash and all Ranks under his command, including the
Tanks and the detachment of 33rd American Division, my warm
congratulations on the success which attended the operation carried
out this morning, and on the skill and gallantry with which it was
conducted.</p>
<p align="right"><small>"D. HAIG."</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>A steady stream of visitors also set in, including numbers of
General Staff Officers, who had been sent down from other Corps and
Armies to gather information as to the methods employed. Everyone,
of course, recognized that there was only one War, and that it was
to the mutual benefit of all that all expedients calculated to
accelerate the end of it should become the common property of all.
My Staff were accordingly kept busy for many days with maps and
diagrams explaining the lines on which the enterprise had been
carried out.</p>
<p>The most distinguished and most welcome of all our visitors,
however, was Monsieur Clemenceau, the veteran statesman of France,
who, in spite of the physical effort, immediately after the sitting
of the Versailles War Council had closed, made haste to travel to
the Amiens area, and to visit the Corps for the special purpose of
thanking the troops. He arrived on July 7th, and a large assemblage
of Australian soldiers who had participated in the battle, and who
were resting from their labours near General Maclagan's
Headquarters at Bussy, were privileged to hear him address them in
English in the following terms:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">"I am glad to be able to speak at least this
small amount of English, because it enables me to tell you what all
French people think of you. They expected a great deal of you,
because they have heard what you have accomplished in the
development of your own country. I should not like to say that they
are surprised that you have fulfilled their expectations. By that
high standard they judge you, and admire you that you have reached
it. We have all been fighting the same battle of freedom in these
old battlegrounds. You have all heard the names of them in history.
But it is a great wonder, too, in history that you should be here
fighting on the old battlefields, which you never thought, perhaps,
to see. The work of our fathers, which we wanted to hand down
unharmed to our children, the Germans tried to take from us. They
tried to rob us of all that is dearest in modern human society. But
men were the same in Australia, England, France, Italy, and all
countries proud of being the home of free people. That is what made
you come; that is what made us greet you when you came. We knew you
would fight a real fight, but we did not know that from the very
beginning you would astonish the whole Continent with your valour.
I have come here for the simple purpose of seeing the Australians
and telling them this. I shall go back to-morrow and say to my
countrymen: 'I have seen the Australians; I have looked into their
eyes. I know that they, men who have fought great battles in the
cause of freedom, will fight on alongside us, till the freedom for
which we are all fighting is guaranteed for us and our
children.'"</p>
<br>
<p>The French inhabitants of the Amiens district were also highly
elated at the victory. The city itself had been, for some weeks,
completely evacuated, by official order. Not only had it become the
object of nightly visitations by flights of Gothas; but also,
somewhere in the east and far beyond the reach of my longest range
guns, the enemy had succeeded in emplacing a cannon of
exceptionally large calibre, range and power, which took its daily
toll of the buildings of this beautiful city.</p>
<p>The anniversary of the French national f&ecirc;te was
approaching, and the Prefect of the Department of the Somme,
Monsieur Morain&mdash;appreciating the significance of the Hamel
victory as a definite step towards the ultimate disengagement of
the city from the German terror&mdash;determined to make the
celebration of this f&ecirc;te not only a compliment to the
Australian Corps, but also a proof of the unquenchable fortitude of
the people of his Department.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, in the very heart of
the deserted city, amidst the crumbling ruins of its upper stories,
and of the devastation of the surrounding city blocks, he presided
at a humble but memorable repast, which had been spread in an
undamaged apartment, inviting to his board a bare twenty
representatives of the French and British Armies, and of the city
of Amiens. While we toasted the King and the Republic, and voiced
the firm resolve of both Allies to see the struggle through to the
bitter end, the enemy shells were still thundering overhead.</p>
<p>But other matters than rejoicings in a task thus happily
accomplished compelled my chief attention during the remaining days
of this July. I had to study and gauge accurately the tactical and
strategical results of the victory of Hamel, and to lose no time in
using the advantage gained. The moral results both on the enemy and
on ourselves were far more important, and deserve far more emphasis
than do the material gains.</p>
<p>It was, as I have said, the first offensive operation, on any
substantial scale, that had been fought by any of the Allies since
the previous autumn. Its effect was electric, and it stimulated
many men to the realization that the enemy was, after all, not
invulnerable, in spite of the formidable increase in his resources
which he had brought from Russia. It marked the termination, once
and for all, of the purely defensive attitude of the British front.
It incited in many quarters an examination of the possibilities of
offensive action on similar lines by similar means&mdash;a changed
attitude of mind, which bore a rich harvest only a very few weeks
later.</p>
<p>But its effect on the enemy was even more startling. His whole
front from the Ancre to Villers-Bretonneux had become unstable, and
was reeling from the blow. It was only the consideration that I had
still to defend a ten-mile front, and had still only one Division
in reserve in case of emergency, that deterred me from embarking at
once upon another blow on an even larger scale. But I seized every
occasion to importune the Army Commander either to narrow my front,
or to let the First Division from Hazebrouck join my command, or
both; but so far without result.</p>

<small>MAP B&mdash;Battle of Hamel, July 4th, 1918<br>
[<i>click map to view larger image</i>]</small></p>
<br>
<p>The only course that remained open to me was to initiate
immediate measures for taking the fullest advantage of the enemy's
demoralization by exploiting the success obtained to the utmost
possible extent. No later than on the afternoon of the battle of
Hamel itself, orders were issued to all three line Divisions to
commence most vigorous offensive patrolling all along the Corps
front, with a view not merely to prevent the enemy from
re-establishing an organized defensive system, but also ourselves
to penetrate the enemy's ground by the establishment therein of
isolated posts, as a nucleus for subsequent more effective
occupation.</p>
<p>Enterprise of such a nature appeals strongly to the sporting
instinct of the Australian soldier. Divisions, Brigades and
Battalions vied with each other in predatory expeditions, even in
broad daylight, into the enemy's ground, and a steady stream of
prisoners and machine guns flowed in. On the nights of July 5th and
6th, the Fifth Division, now in the sector between the Ancre and
the Somme, possessed themselves with very little effort of a strip
of some three hundred acres of hostile positions, bringing our
front line so near to Morlancourt as to make that village no longer
tenable by the enemy.</p>
<p>On the same nights, and again on July 8th and 9th, the Second
and Fourth Divisions advanced their lines by an average of two
hundred to three hundred yards along their respective fronts, and
this advance was, in the case of the Second Division, particularly
valuable in carrying our front line over the crest of the plateau
of Hill 104, and giving us clear and unbroken observation far into
the enemy's country, in the directions of Warfusee and
Marcelcave.</p>
<p>It was a period replete with instances of individual enterprise
and daring adventure. One incident, characteristic of the varied
efforts of these days, was the capture, single-handed, and in broad
daylight, by Corporal W. Brown, V.C., of the 20th Battalion, Second
Division, of an officer and eleven men of the German Army, whom he
stalked as they lay skulking in a trench dug-out not far from his
observation post, and terrorized into submission by the threat of
throwing a bomb at them.</p>
<p>But perhaps the best testimony of the successful activities of
my troops during this period, and of the serious impression which
they made upon the enemy, can be gathered by extracts from his own
documents, a number of which were captured during this and
subsequent fighting. Of these, the following, issued by the Second
German Army Headquarters (Von der Marwitz), are among the more
interesting:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">"The enemy has in his minor enterprises again
taken prisoner a complete front line battalion and part of a
support battalion. The reason is our faulty leadership."</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">"The enemy penetrated the forward zone of the
108th Division by means of large patrols at midnight, on July 8th,
1918, without any artillery preparation, and again on the same
night at 11 p.m., with artillery preparation, astride of the
Marcelcave-Villers-Bretonneux railway. He occupied the trenches
where our most advanced outposts lay, and took the occupants,
comprising fifteen men, prisoner. The larger part of the forward
zone has been lost."<br></p>
<p class="indent1">"In the case of the present trench Division, it
has often happened that <i>complete</i> picquets have disappeared
from the forward zone without a trace."</p>
<br>
<p>All the above refers to the period between July 4th and 12th. We
read again under date July 13th:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">"During the last few days the Australians have
succeeded in penetrating, or taking prisoner, single posts or
picquets. They have gradually&mdash;sometimes even in
daylight&mdash;succeeded in getting possession of the majority of
the forward zone of a whole Division."</p>

<br>
<p class="indent1">"Troops must fight. They must not give way at
every opportunity and seek to avoid fighting, otherwise they will
get the feeling that the enemy are superior to them."</p>
<br>
<p>One last extract from these interesting papers:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">"The best way to make the enemy more careful in
his attempt to drive us bit by bit out of the outpost line and
forward zone is to do active reconnaissance and carry out patrol
encounters oneself. In this respect absolutely nothing seems to
have been done. If the enemy can succeed in scoring a success
without any special support by artillery or assistance from special
troops, we must be in a position to do the same."</p>
<br>
<p>Our line in front of Villers-Bretonneux had for months run very
close to the eastern outskirts of that town, a circumstance which
cramped and embarrassed our defence of it. The enemy could peer
into its streets and sweep them with machine guns. He had held in
strength a locality known as Monument Wood, the ruins of a once
prosperous orchard, and his possession of it had been a source of
annoyance both to us and to the French, for it lay just opposite
the international boundary posts.</p>
<p>The time seemed opportune for a set-piece operation designed to
advance our line opposite the town by 1,000 yards, on a broad
front, to dislodge the enemy from Monument Wood, gain valuable
elbow room, and obtain mastery of the remainder of the plateau on
which the town was built. I had actually completed the draft of a
plan for such an operation, and had held a preliminary conference
with my Staff to discuss it, when it became apparent that the
nightly encroachments which the Second Division were effecting in
this region would, in the course of a few days, achieve the capture
of the whole of this territory without any special organized effort
at all.</p>
<p>And so it proved; for before the middle of July, Rosenthal had
succeeded in possessing himself, by such a process of "peaceful
penetration", of the whole of the coveted area. It was a further
evidence of the serious demoralization which our aggressive
attitude of the preceding months had wrought among the German
forces opposed to us.</p>
<p>The era of minor aggression by the Australian Corps was,
however, about to draw to a close, and the situation was rapidly
beginning to shape itself for greater events.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h4>TURNING THE TIDE</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> course of events during June and July pointed
to the conclusions, firstly, that the enemy contemplated no further
offensive operations in the Somme Valley, and, secondly, that the
condition of the whole German Second Army, astride of the Somme,
offered every temptation to us to seize the initiative against
it.</p>
<p>So far as the Australian Corps was concerned, however, my total
frontage, which had been increased (as the result of our
exploitation) to over eleven miles, precluded the possibility, with
only four Divisions at my disposal, of maintaining, even if I could
succeed in initiating, an ambitious offensive. The time was
nevertheless ripe for action on a scale far more decisive than had
become orthodox in the British Army in the past. Efforts on that
method had been confined to a thrust, limited in point both of
distance and of time, and followed by a period of inaction; they
had often given the enemy ample leisure to recover, and to
reorganize his order of battle.</p>
<p>To maintain an offensive, day after day, indefinitely, would
require sufficient resources, particularly in infantry, to allow
Divisions to be used alternatingly. Only in such a way, by having
rested Divisions always available to alternate with tired
Divisions, could a continuous pressure be maintained.</p>
<p>I took every opportunity of pressing these views upon the Army
Commander, and expressed the readiness of the Australian Corps to
undertake and maintain a long sustained offensive, provided that
arrangements could be made to shorten my frontage from a three to a
two-Division battle front, and to increase my resources, from the
present four, to five or even six Divisions. It was further
essential that in any advances attempted by us, other Corps must
co-operate on both flanks.</p>
<p>It would be bad tactics to drive into the enemy's front a
salient with a narrow base, for such a salient would make our
situation worse instead of better, affording to the enemy the
opportunity of artillery attack upon it from both its flanks as
well as from its front. The salient must therefore be broad based
in relation to its depth, and the base must ever widen as the head
of the salient advances.</p>
<p>This principle implied that a large-scale operation of such a
nature must be begun on a whole Army front, and that, even at its
inception, at least three Corps must co-operate, to be aided by the
entry of additional Corps on the outer flanks as the central depth
developed. In other words, it was a project implying a large
commitment of resources, and the urgent question was whether the
time was yet ripe for taking the risks involved.</p>
<p>The matter, however, now became a subject at least worthy of
practical discussion, and, during the days which followed Hamel,
the Staffs of both the Corps and Army were kept busy with the
investigation of data, maps, and information, while the
availability of additional resources in guns, tanks and aeroplanes
became the subject of anxious inquiry.</p>
<p>A circumstance which troubled me sorely was the fact that my
Corps stood on the flank of the British Army, and that the troops
on my right belonged to the French Army. The relations between the
Australian troops and the Tirailleurs and Zouaves of the 31st
French Corps (General Toulorge) had always been the very
friendliest, and the joint "international" posts had been the
scenes of hearty fraternization and of the evolution of a strange
common vernacular.</p>
<p>This comradeship of "poilu" with "digger" did not, however,
lessen the difficulties incidental to the joint conduct of a major
Operation of War by two Corps of different nationalities, speaking
different languages, with diverse tactical conceptions, and, above
all, of substantially divergent temperaments. The French are
irresistible in attack as they are dogged in defence, but whether
they will attack or defend depends greatly on their temperament of
the moment. In this they are totally unlike the British or
Australian soldier who will at any time philosophically accept
either r&ocirc;le that may be prescribed for him.</p>
<p>In short, it was not possible to hope for an effective
co-ordination of effort, controlled particularly by the minute
observance of a time-table, on the part of the Australian and its
adjacent French Corps, and I felt quite unprepared to count upon
it. It was for this reason that I expressed to the Army Commander
the hope that a British Corps might be obtainable to operate on my
right flank in any undertaking that should be decided upon.
Understanding that the greater part of the Canadian Corps was then
unemployed, resting in a back area, I ventured to hope that this
Corps might be made available, in the event of a decision that the
proposal should be proceeded with.</p>
<p>My hesitation to accept the French as colleagues in such a
battle was based not altogether on theoretical or sentimental
grounds. The steady progress in mopping up enemy territory to the
east of Villers-Bretonneux, which had been made by my south flank
Division (the Second) as the aftermath of Hamel, soon produced a
contortion of the Allied front line at this point which bade fair
to prove just as troublesome to me as had been the great re-entrant
opposite Hamel, which that battle had been specially undertaken to
eliminate.</p>
<p>No persuasions on my part, or on that of my flank Division,
could induce the adjacent French Division to extend any
co-operation in these advances or to adopt any measures to flatten
out the re-entrant which, growing deeper every day, threatened to
expose my right flank. I am convinced that such hesitation was
based upon no timidity, but was the result wholly of an entirely
different outlook and policy from those which the Australian Corps
was doing its best to interpret. But the experience of it made the
prospect of punctual co-operation on their part in much more
serious undertakings distinctly less encouraging.</p>
<p>The proposed offensive involved, therefore, far-reaching
redispositions, comprising a substantial displacement southwards of
the inter-Allied boundary, a lengthening by several miles of the
whole British Western front, and an entire rearrangement of the
respective fronts of the Third and Fourth British Armies. It is not
surprising that a decision was deferred, while the project was
being critically investigated from every point of view.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, a new situation arose. On July 15th, the enemy
opened a fresh attack against the French in the south. The scale on
which he undertook it immediately made it patent to all students of
the situation that he was probably employing his whole remaining
reserves of fit, rested Divisions; that he meant this to be his
decisive blow; and that whether he gained a decision or not, it
would be his last effort on the grand scale.</p>
<p>It did not succeed; for just as he had once again reached the
line of the Marne and had on July 17th achieved his "furthest
south" at Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry, a beautifully timed counter-stroke
by the French and Americans upon the western face of the salient,
extending from Soissons to the Marne, resulted on July 18th in the
capture by the Allies on that day alone, of 15,000 prisoners and
200 guns.</p>
<p>It was the end of German offensive in the war. Their mobile
reserves were exhausted, and they were compelled slowly to recede
from the Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry salient. The appropriate moment, for
which Foch and Haig had doubtless been waiting for months, had at
last arrived to begin an Allied counter offensive, and it was only
a question of deciding at what point along the Franco-British front
the effort should be made, and on what date it should open.</p>
<p>Doubtless influenced by the reasons already discussed, the
choice fell upon that portion of the front of the Fourth Army which
lay south of the Somme; in other words upon the southern portion of
the Australian Corps front. The date remained undecided, but the
requisite redisposition of Armies and Corps was so extensive that
no time was to be lost in making a beginning.</p>
<p>It was on July 21st that General Rawlinson first called together
the Corps Commanders who were to be entrusted with this portentous
task. The strictest secrecy was enjoined, and never was a secret
better kept; with the exception of the Field Marshal and his Army
Commanders, none outside of the Fourth Army had any inkling of what
was afoot until the actual moment for action had arrived.</p>
<p>Yet an observant enemy agent, if any such there had been in the
vicinity, might well have drawn a shrewd conclusion that some
mischief was brewing, had he happened along the main street of the
prettily-situated village of Flexicourt, on the Somme, on that
bright summer afternoon, and had observed in front of a pretentious
white mansion, over which floated the black and red flag of an Army
Commander, a quite unusual procession of motor-cars, ostentatiously
flying the Canadian and Australian flags and the red-and-white
pennants of two other Corps Commanders.</p>
<p>There were present at that conference, General Currie, the
Canadian, General Butler, of the Third Corps, General Kavanagh, of
the Cavalry Corps, and myself, while senior representatives of the
Tanks and Air Force also attended. Rawlinson unfolded the outline
of the whole Army plan, and details were discussed at great length
in the light of the views held by each Corps Commander as to the
tasks which he was prepared to undertake with the resources in his
hands or promised to him.</p>
<p>The conditions which I had sought in my previous negotiations
with the Army Commander were, I found, conceded to me almost to the
full extent. My battle front was to be reduced from eleven miles to
a little over 7,000 yards. It would, in fact, extend from the
Somme, as the northern, to the main P&eacute;ronne railway, as the
southern flank. And&mdash;what was equally important, and
profoundly welcome&mdash;the First Australian Division was shortly
to be relieved in Flanders, and would at last join my Corps, thus
for the first time in the war bringing all Australian field units
in France under one command.</p>
<p>The Canadians were to operate on my right, and further south
again the First French Army (Debenay) was to supply a Corps to form
a defensive flank for the Canadians. The Third British Corps was to
carry out for me a similar function on my northern flank. Thus,
four Corps in line were to operate, the two central Corps carrying
out the main advance, while the two outer flank Corps would be
employed further to broaden the base of the great salient which the
operation would create.</p>
<p>The Cavalry Corps would appear in the battle area also, with all
preparations made for a rapid exploitation of any success achieved.
The utility of the Cavalry in modern war, at any rate in a European
theatre, has been the subject of endless controversy. It is one
into which I do not propose to enter. There is no doubt that, given
suitable ground and an absence of wire entanglements, Cavalry can
move rapidly, and undertake important turning or enveloping
movements. Yet it has been argued that the rarity of such suitable
conditions negatives any justification for superimposing so
unwieldy a burden as a large body of Cavalry&mdash;on the bare
chance that it <em>might</em> be useful&mdash;upon already
overpopulated areas, billets, watering places and roads.</p>
<p>I may, however, anticipate the event by saying that the First
Cavalry Brigade was duly allotted to me, and did its best to prove
its utility; but I am bound to say that the results achieved, in
what proved to be very unsuitable country beyond the range of the
Infantry advance, did not justify the effort expended either by
this gallant Brigade or by the other arms and services upon whom
the very presence of the Cavalry proved an added burden.</p>
<p>For the full understanding of subsequent developments both
during and after the battle it becomes of special importance to
consider the proposed r&ocirc;le of the Third Corps in relation to
my left flank. It is to be remembered that the Fourth Army decided
that the River Somme was to be the tactical boundary between the
two Northern Corps. It was not competent for me to criticize this
decision at the time, but I am free now to say that I believed such
a boundary to have been unsuitable, and the event speedily proved
that it was.</p>
<p>It is always, in my opinion, undesirable to select any bold
natural or artificial feature&mdash;such as a river, ravine, ridge,
road or railway&mdash;as a boundary. It creates, at once, a divided
responsibility, and necessitates between two independent
commanders, and at a critical point, a degree of effective
co-operation which can rarely be hoped for. It is much better
boldly to place a unit, however large or small, <i>astride</i> of
such a feature, so that both sides of it may come under the control
of one and the same Commander.</p>
<p>This was especially the case in this part of the Somme Valley
which is broad, and has an ill-defined central line, tortuous, and
with the slopes on either side tactically interdependent; but most
of all because, as I have already described, the high plateau on
the north completely overlooks the relatively lower flats on the
south of the river. The point I am trying to make should be borne
in mind, for I believe it has been fully borne out by subsequent
events.</p>
<p>The decision standing, however, as it did, it fell to the task
of the Third Corps to make an assault (concurrently with that of
the Australian Corps south of the river) for the capture of the
whole of that reach of the river known as the Chipilly Bend, and of
all the high ground on the spur which that bend enfolds. The object
was to deprive the enemy of all ground from which he could look
down upon my advancing left flank, or from which he could bring
rifle or artillery fire to bear upon it.</p>
<p>The Third Corps was to operate on the front of one Division, the
58th, which, pivoting its left upon the Corbie-Bray road, was to
advance its right&mdash;in sympathy with the advance of the left of
the Australian Corps&mdash;until it rested upon the river about one
mile downstream from Etinehem. It was a movement the success of
which was rendered promising by the nature of the ground and the
disorganized condition of the enemy between the Ancre and the
Somme.</p>
<p>As regards my right flank, this was to rest as stated upon the
main railway. The Canadian Corps, of four Divisions, would take
over from the French a frontage of about 6,000 yards and deliver a
thrust parallel to and south of the railway, in the direction of
Caix and Beaucourt, and would aim at the seizure of the important
Hill 102, immediately to the west of the latter locality. At no
time did any question of the security of my right flank furnish me
with any cause for anxiety; the prowess of the Canadian Corps was
well known to all Australians, and I knew that, to use his own
expressive vernacular, it was General Currie's invariable habit to
"deliver the goods".</p>
<p>The comprehensive project thus outlined at the conference of
July 21st involved, as a preliminary step, a far-reaching
redisposition of very large bodies of troops over a very wide
front. With the readjustment of the boundaries between the Third
and Fourth British Armies we are not particularly concerned,
because this affected a region, north of the Ancre, which lay well
outside of the battle area. Nor did the internal readjustment of
the northern part of the Fourth Army front present any difficulty,
as it meant nothing more than a routine "relief" by the 58th
Division of the Fifth Australian Division which was at this
juncture holding that part of my Corps sector which lay between the
Somme and the Ancre.</p>
<p>But the southern half was a very different matter. The First
French Army was to give up to the British a section of about four
miles, extending from Villers-Bretonneux to Thennes. This was
ultimately to be taken over by the Canadian Corps as a battle
front, but that Corps still had two of its Divisions in the line in
the neighbourhood of Arras.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was of the utmost importance to conceal from the
enemy until the last possible moment any change in our
dispositions. This meant concealing them from our own troops also,
because the loss by us of a single talkative prisoner would have
been sufficient to disclose to the enemy at least the suspicion, if
not the certainty, that an attack was in preparation.</p>
<p>After examining the problem and discussing several alternative
solutions, it was ultimately decided at this conference that, five
or six days before the date fixed for the attack, the French would
be relieved in this sector by a Division, not of Canadians, but of
Australians; that under cover of and behind this Australian
Division, the Canadian Corps would come in from the north, and
would proceed to carry out its battle preparations; and finally
that the actual appearance of Canadian troops in the front line
would not ensue until three days before the battle.</p>
<p>During the preceding two days, the Australian troops would be
gradually withdrawn from the sector, leaving only one Brigade in
occupation of the line, to be backed up by the incoming Canadians
in the unexpected contingency of an attack by the enemy. This last
Brigade would quietly melt away, leaving the Canadians in full
possession of the field.</p>
<p>It was hoped that, during the days of the temporary Australian
occupation of the sector, nothing would happen which might disclose
to the enemy that the French had left it; and even if we were to
have the misfortune to lose from this sector any Australian
prisoners to the enemy, it was further hoped that, if kept in total
ignorance of the inflow of Canadians, such prisoners would be
unable to make any embarrassing disclosures. The
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, which will be told later, showed that
this judgment of possibilities was a shrewd one, and that such
precautions were not taken in vain.</p>
<p>At this period of the war, large numbers of Americans had
already arrived in France, but only few of them were yet ready to
take their places in the line of battle. The time had not yet
arrived, therefore, when, by taking over large sections of the
Western front they could help to shorten the French and British
frontages. The British front was, therefore, still so extended that
the mobile reserve Divisions at the disposal of the Field Marshal
were few.</p>
<p>This consideration made the contemplated reliefs and
interchanges of Corps and Divisions, and their transference from
one part of our front to another a matter of great complexity, and
one which required time to execute. Each stage of the process was
contingent upon the due completion of a previous stage. It is,
moreover, a process which cannot be unduly hastened, without
serious discomfort and fatigue to the troops and animals
concerned.</p>
<p>Troops destined for battle must be kept in the highest physical
condition. This means good feeding, comfortable housing, and
adequate rest. A couple of weary days and sleepless nights spent in
crowded railway trains, with cold food and little exercise, are
sufficient to play havoc with the fighting trim of even a crack
battalion. So, the daily stages of the journey must be short, and
comfortable billets must be in readiness for each night's halt. The
day's supplies must arrive punctually and at the right railhead, to
ensure hot, well-cooked meals.</p>
<p>With the very limited number of serviceable railway lines which
remained available behind the British front&mdash;and with the
congestion of traffic resulting from the daily transportation of
many thousands of tons of artillery ammunition and other war
stores&mdash;it was not surprising that as the result of the
deliberations of the conference it was resolved to advise the
Commander-in-Chief that it would take not less than five days to
rearrange our order of battle on the lines decided upon, and
another five days, after Corps and Divisions had taken over their
battle fronts, to enable them to complete their preparations.</p>
<p>Thus, the Fourth Army could be ready at ten days' notice, and
the conference broke up, pledged to secrecy and complete inaction,
until formal approval had been given to the proposals and a date
fixed for their realization.</p>
<p>The remainder of July passed with no very startling occurrences.
In the south the German withdrawal from the Soissons salient and
the Marne continued steadily, with the French and Americans on
their heels; but it was a methodical retreat, which would bring
about a substantial shortening of the German line, and so release
Divisions to rest and refit, which might conceivably become
available for a fresh assault elsewhere.</p>
<p>But there was still no sign of any such design upon that always
tender spot, the Allied junction at Villers-Bretonneux. On the
contrary, my second Division still continued to make free with the
enemy's advanced patrols, and in a very brilliant little infantry
operation by the 7th Brigade captured the "Mound", a long spoilbank
beside the railway at a point about a mile east of the town, which
dominated the landscape in every direction. The ardour of his
troops was only enhanced when they heard that General Rosenthal
himself, while reconnoitring from the Mound, had been sniped at and
had received a nasty wound in the arm.</p>
<p>The enemy attempted nothing in the way of infantry retaliation.
But whenever he had been thoroughly angered, he treated my front to
a liberal drenching of mustard gas, fired by his artillery. His
supplies of mustard gas shell seemed inexhaustible, and he would
frequently expend as many as 10,000 of them in a single night upon
the half-ruined town of Villers-Bretonneux or on the Bois
l'Abb&eacute; and other woods which he suspected were sheltering my
reserve infantry.</p>
<p>These gas attacks were annoying and troublesome in the extreme.
During the actual bombardments, troops wore their gas masks as a
matter of course, but doffed them when the characteristic smell of
the gas had disappeared. But it was warm weather, and as the sun
rose, the poisonous liquid, which had spattered the ground over
immense areas, would volatilize, and rise in sufficient volume
still to attack all whose business took them to and fro across this
ground. In this way hundreds of our men became incapacitated;
although there were a few serious cases, most of the men would be
fit to rejoin in two or three weeks. But this form of attack, and
the constant dread of it, made life in the forward areas anything
but endurable.</p>
<p>I was beset by quite another trepidation also. Prisoners
captured during the German withdrawal from the Marne, which was
then in progress, told tales of contemplated withdrawals on other
fronts, and some even asserted that a withdrawal opposite my own
front was being talked of. Judged by subsequent events, it is more
than probable that these stories were stimulated by the many
articles which were at that time appearing in the German newspapers
from the pens of press strategists, who, in order to allay public
anxiety, were representing these withdrawals as deliberate, and as
a masterpiece of strategy, compelling the Allies to a costly
pursuit over difficult and worthless ground.</p>
<p>Opposite Albert, signs that such a withdrawal was actually in
progress also began to appear, although it subsequently transpired
that, in its early stages, this procedure was merely prompted by a
purely local consideration, namely, the desire of the enemy to
improve his tactical position by abandoning the outposts, which he
had been maintaining in the valley of the Ancre, and transferring
them to the higher and better ground on the east of that river.</p>
<p>It was only natural that those of us who knew of the impending
attack, and of the immense effort which its preparation would
involve, felt nervous lest the enemy might forestall us by
withdrawing his whole line to some methodically prepared position
of defence in the rear, just as he had done once before in 1917 on
so large a scale in the Bapaume region. It would probably have been
a sound measure of military policy, but it would assuredly, at that
juncture, have had as disastrous an effect upon the <i>moral</i> of
the German people as his enforced withdrawal, which was soon to
begin, actually produced not long after.</p>
<p>The order to prepare the attack, and fixing the date of it for
August 8th, came in the closing days of July, and at once all was
bustle and excitement in the Australian Corps. Commanders, Staff
Officers, and Intelligence Service, the Artillery, the Corps Flying
Squadron, the map and photography sections spent busy days in
reconnaissance, and toilsome nights in office work. The vast extent
of the detailed work involved, particularly upon the administrative
services, can only be appreciated by a study of the plan for the
battle, which it fell to my lot, as Corps Commander, first to
formulate, and then to expound to a series of conferences which
were held at Bertangles on July 30th, and on August 2nd and
4th.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, perhaps appropriate that I should now attempt
to repeat, in non-technical language, an exposition of the outlines
of that plan.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4>THE BATTLE PLAN</h4>
<p>M<small>Y</small> plan for the impending battle involved the
employment of four Divisions in the actual assault, with one
Division in reserve. The Reserve Division was to be available for
use in one of two ways; either as a reserve of fresh troops to
exploit any successes gained upon the first day, or else to take
over and hold defensively the ground won, if the assaulting
Divisions should have become too exhausted to be relied upon for
successful resistance to a counter-attack in force.</p>
<p>The frontage allotted to the Corps was 7,000 yards, and this
extent of front accommodated itself naturally to the employment of
two first-line Divisions, each on a 3,500 yard front, each Division
having two Brigades in the front line, with one Brigade in
reserve.</p>
<p>As four Divisions were available to me for immediate use in the
battle, I decided to undertake, for the first time in the war, on
so comprehensive a scale, the tactical expedient of a "leapfrog" by
Divisions over each other.</p>
<p>This term had, long before, passed into the homely phraseology
of the war, in order to describe a procedure by which one body of
troops, having reached its objective, was there halted, as at a
completed task, while a second body of troops, of similar order of
importance, but under an entirely separate Commander, advanced over
the ground won, reached the foremost battle line, took over the
tactical responsibility for the fighting front, and after a
prescribed interval of time continued the advance to a further and
more distant objective.</p>
<p>This conception of an advance by a process of "leapfrog" had
been evolved early in 1917 in connection with a method of assault
on successive lines of trenches. It was intended at the outset to
be applied only to very small bodies of infantry, such as platoons.
A normal battle plan for a company of infantry of four platoons was
for the first two platoons to capture and hold the front line
trench, while the next two following platoons would leap over this
trench and over the troops who had gained it, and then pass beyond
to the capture of the second, or support trench. The method was
used, for the first time, on such a modest scale, at the battle of
Messines, in June, 1917, and later on in the same year was adopted
for bodies as large even as Battalions, in the fighting for the
Broodseinde and Passchendaele heights.</p>
<p>But on no previous occasion had such a principle been applied to
whole Divisions. It is true that at the battle of Messines, the
Fourth Australian Division passed through the New Zealand Division
after the latter had completed the capture of the main Messines
ridge, but this was really exploitation, undertaken in order to
take advantage of the temporary confusion of the enemy, and for the
purpose of gaining ground upon the eastern slopes of the captured
ridge. It was not a movement which was really part of the main
assault, and it was confined to a single Division.</p>
<p>On the present occasion my purpose was to carry out a clear and
definite process of "leapfrogging", not only simultaneously by two
Divisions side by side, but also as an essential part of the
time-table programme for the main battle, and before the
exploitation stage of the fighting was timed to be reached. It was,
undeniably, a daring proposal, involving very definite risks,
enormously increasing the labour of preparation and the mass of
detailed precautions which had to be undertaken in order to obviate
the possibility of great confusion.</p>
<p>The preparations necessary for a single Division proposing to
advance alone, to a prescribed distance, over country much of which
was usually visible to us from our front line, are sufficiently
complex, relating as they do, not only to the establishment of
numerous protected headquarters for Brigades and Battalions, of
miles upon miles of buried and ground cables, of dumps of all kinds
of supplies, and of dressing stations and medical aid posts; but
also to the disposition, in concealed positions, of all the
assaulting units, down to the smallest of them, of Infantry
Engineers and Pioneers. All these preparations assume a tenfold
complexity when a second Division has to make arrangements exactly
similar in character, variety and extent, using exactly the same
territory for the purpose and at the same time, and planning to
advance over more distant country, entirely beyond visual range and
preliminary reconnaissance.</p>
<p>The project also involved a much greater crowding of troops into
the areas immediately behind our line of departure, and, therefore,
enormously increased the risk of premature detection by the enemy,
both from ground and from air observation, of unusual movement and
of other symptoms which presaged the possibility of an attack by
us. The plan also necessitated the closest possible co-ordination
of effort, and mutual sympathy and understanding, between the
Commanders and Staffs of the twin Divisions having a common
jurisdiction over one and the same area of preparation, and one and
the same battle front. This was a degree of co-operation which
could not have been looked for unless the personnel concerned had
already established, from long and close association with each
other, the most cordial personal relations. And dominating all
other difficulties were those involved in the proposal to execute
this difficult and untried operation of a Divisional leapfrog, not
singly but in a duplex manner, necessitating the assurance of
exactly similar simultaneous action, similarly timed in every
stage, both before and during battle, by each of two separate pairs
of Divisions.</p>
<p>These threatening difficulties were surely formidable enough,
but I knew that I could rely upon the good-will of the Divisions
towards each other, and upon the loyal support of them all. This
seemed to me to justify the attempt, and to minimize the risks;
having regard above all else to the results which I stood to gain
if the operation could be executed as planned.</p>
<p>On no previous occasion in the war had an attempt ever been made
to effect a penetration into the enemy's defences at the first
blow, and on the first day, greater than a mile or two. Rarely had
any previous set-piece attack succeeded in reaching the enemy's
line of field-guns. The result had been that the bulk of his
Artillery had been withdrawn at his leisure, and his losses had
been confined to a few hundred acres of shattered territory. But
the task I had set myself was not only to reach, at the first
onslaught, the whole of the enemy's Artillery positions, but
greatly to overrun them with a view to obliterating, by destruction
or capture, the whole of his defensive organizations and the whole
of the fighting resources which they contained, along the full
extent of my Corps front.</p>
<p>To achieve this object I prepared my plans upon the basis of a
total advance, on the first day, of not less than 9,000 yards. This
was to be divided into three separate stages, as follows:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td>Phase A&mdash;Set-piece attack with
barrage,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

objective,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>9,000 yards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The opening phase involved no novel or unusual features so far
as the infantry were concerned, and was conceived on lines with
which the fighting of 1917 had familiarized me, modified further by
the accumulated experience gained from earlier mistakes in the
technical details of such an enterprise. The recent battle of Hamel
became the model for this phase, the conditions of that battle
being now reproduced on a much enlarged scale.</p>
<p>But there was one very important feature which distinguished the
present undertaking from the battles of Messines and Broodseinde,
and that was in regard to the frontage allotted for attack to a
single Division. At Messines, the Divisional battle front was 2,000
yards; in the third battle of Ypres it differed but little from the
same standard. For the present battle, I adopted a battle front of
two miles for each assaulting Division, or a mile for each of the
four assaulting Brigades.</p>
<p>This innovation seemed to me to be justified by four principal
factors. The first of these was that the weather, which was dry,
and the state of the ground, which was hard, made the "going" easy
and the stress upon the infantry comparatively light. Next, the
condition of the enemy's defensive works was undeveloped and
stagnant, as clearly disclosed by the air photographs which the
Corps Air Squadron produced in great numbers on every fine day. No
doubt this was due to the encroachments we had made on his forward
works during the fighting at Hamel and in the remaining weeks of
July. Thirdly, the powerful assistance anticipated from a
contingent of four Battalions of Tanks which General Rawlinson had
arranged to place under my orders led me to estimate that I might
greatly reduce the number of men per yard of front. Lastly, the
plan was justified by the known distribution of the enemy's
infantry and guns along the frontage under attack. For all these
reasons, I felt prepared to impose on the infantry a task which,
computed solely upon the factor of frontage, was more than twice
that demanded by me on any previous occasion.</p>
<p>At the same time, so extended a frontage involved the employment
of a much higher ratio of barrage artillery to the number of
battalions of Infantry actually engaged. Success depended more upon
the efficiency of the fire power of the barrage than upon any other
factor, and I could not afford to incur any risk by weakening the
density of the barrage. For this reason, I adhered to the standard
which previous experience of several major battles and many minor
raids had shown to be adequate for covering the assaulting
infantry, and for keeping down the enemy's fire. This standard
never fluctuated widely from one field-gun per twenty yards of
front, and involved the employment, on this occasion, of some 432
field-guns in the barrage alone. This result could not have been
achieved if the Fourth Army authorities had not seen their way to
place at my disposal five additional Brigades of Field Artillery
over and above the thirteen Australian Brigades which formed a
permanent part of the whole Artillery of the Corps.</p>
<p>Phase A, as already stated, involved a penetration of 3,000
yards, and the objective line for this phase, which came to be
known as the "green" line (from the colour employed to delineate it
upon all the fighting maps propounded by the Corps), was chosen,
after an exhaustive study of all aeroplane photographs, and of the
results of numerous observations, by many diverse means, of the
locations of the enemy's Artillery, so as to make certain that
during this phase the whole mass of the enemy's forward Artillery
would be overrun, and captured or put out of action.</p>
<p>The green line was, in fact, located along the crest of the spur
running north-easterly from Lamotte-en-Santerre in the direction of
Cerisy-Gailly, with the object of carrying the battle well to the
east of the Cerisy valley, in which large numbers of the enemy's
guns had been definitely located. This would give us, by the
capture of this valley, suitable concealed positions in which the
Infantry destined for Phase B could rest for a short "breather";
and would land the Infantry of the original assault in a position
from which they could detect and forestall any attempt on the part
of the enemy to launch a counter-attack before the time for the
opening of Phase B had arrived.</p>
<p>The task of executing Phase A of the battle fell to the Second
and Third Australian Divisions, in that order from south to north,
the southern flank of the Second Division resting upon the main
railway line from Amiens to P&eacute;ronne, and being there in
contact with the Canadian Corps, under General Currie. The northern
flank of the Third Division rested on the River Somme, and was
there in contact with the Third British Corps under General Butler,
while the inter-divisional boundary was at the southern edge of the
Bois-d'Accroche.</p>
<p>These two Divisions were the line Divisions during the period
immediately preceding the battle, and had been holding the line
each with two Brigades in line and one Brigade in support. Three
days prior to the battle, however, it was arranged that each
Division should hold its front with only one Brigade, thereby
making available two Brigades each for the actual carrying out of
Phase A of the attack. These assaulting Brigades were the 7th, 3th,
9th and 11th, in that order from south to north, each Brigade
having its due allotment of Tanks and machine guns, etc.</p>
<p>The total estimated time for the completion of Phase A was to be
143 minutes after the opening of the barrage at "zero" hour; and
there was then to be a pause of 100 minutes to allow time for the
advance and deployment into battle order of the succeeding two
Divisions, who were to carry out the process of "leapfrogging" and
to execute Phases B and C of the battle.</p>
<p>The planning of Phase B, or the advance from the "green" to the
"red" line, involved a totally different tactical conception and
the adoption of a type of warfare which had almost entirely
disappeared from the Western theatre of war since those far-off
days in the late autumn of 1914, when the German Army first dug
itself in, in France and Belgium, and committed both combatants to
the prolonged agony of over three years of stationary warfare. I
allude to the moving battle, or as it is called in text-book
language, "open warfare"; a type of fighting in which few of the
British Forces formed since the original Expeditionary Force had
any experience except on the man&oelig;uvre ground under peace
conditions&mdash;a disability which applied equally to the
Australian troops. Confident, however, in their adaptability and in
their power of initiative under novel conditions, I did not
hesitate to prescribe, for this second phase of the battle, the
adoption of the principles and methods of open warfare.</p>
<p>In two very important respects in particular, this type of
fighting involved conditions to which the troops had not been
accustomed, and under which they had no previous experience in
battle. In trench warfare, and in a deliberate attack on entrenched
defences, the positions of all headquarters, medical aid posts,
supply dumps and signal stations remained fixed and immovable. The
whole of the internal communications by telegraph and telephone
could, therefore, be completely installed beforehand, down to the
last detail, and the transmission of all messages, reports, orders
and instructions, during the course of the battle, was rapid and
assured. But in a moving battle no such comprehensive or stable
signalling arrangements are possible, and reliance must be placed
upon the much slower and much more uncertain methods of
transmission by flag and lamp signalling, by dispatch riders,
pigeons and runners.</p>
<p>Divisional Headquarters would, therefore, almost as soon as the
battle commenced, fall out of touch with Brigades, and they in turn
with their Battalions; information as to the actual situation at
the fighting front would travel slowly, and would reach those
responsible for making consequential decisions often long after an
entire alteration in the situation had removed the need for action.
Thus, a greatly enhanced responsibility would come to be imposed
upon subordinate leaders to decide for themselves, without waiting
for guidance or orders from higher authority, and to grasp the
initiative by taking all possible action on the spot in the light
of the circumstances and situation of the moment.</p>
<p>Again, the nature of the Artillery action is, in the moving
battle, fundamentally different from that which prevails during
trench warfare. To begin with, only that portion of the Artillery
which is in the strictest sense mobile can participate to any
extent in open warfare. The employment of Artillery is, therefore,
confined to a few and to the smaller natures of Ordnance, namely,
the 18-pounder field-gun, the 4&frac12;-inch field howitzer and the
60-pounder, which are all horse drawn and which are capable of
being moved off the roads and across all but the most broken
country. Heavier guns, from 6-inch upwards, are in practice
confined to roads, and are too slow and cumbersome to keep pace
with the Infantry. The Artillery fire action is also intrinsically
different, because the guns can be sighted directly upon their
targets, while in trench warfare they are always laid by indirect
methods, with the use of the map and compass, and without
observation, at any rate by the crew of the gun, of the objects
fired at.</p>
<p>The decision which I had to take of carrying out the second
phase of this great battle on the principles of open warfare was,
therefore, one which also involved a certain element of risk. But
it was a risk which I felt justified in taking, in spite of the
fact that the German High Command had more than once expressed
itself in contemptuous terms of the capacity of any British troops
successfully to undertake any operation of open warfare. My
justification lay primarily in my confidence in the ability of the
subordinate commanders and troops to work satisfactorily under
these novel conditions&mdash;a confidence which the event
abundantly justified. But I was placed in the position of having
either to accept this risk, or else abandon altogether the project
of a quite unprecedented penetration of enemy country to be
completed on the first day. It would have been clearly impossible
to continue the advance beyond the green line without an interval
of at least forty-eight hours, which would have been necessary to
enable the Artillery to be re-disposed for barrage fire in forward
positions and provided with the necessary supplies of ammunition
for such a purpose.</p>
<p>The Divisions which were told off to carry out the "leapfrog"
enterprise and to execute Phase B of the battle were the Fifth
Australian Division on the south and the Fourth Australian Division
on the north, the outer flanks of the attack remaining as before,
<i>i.e</i>., the P&eacute;ronne Railway on the south and the River
Somme on the north. Each of these Divisions was directed to deploy,
on its own frontage, two Infantry Brigades. Its third Brigade was
to be kept intact and to advance during Phase B at some distance
behind, as a support to the fighting line, and to be employed in
the subsequent phase, if it were found that Phase B could be
completed without calling upon this spare Brigade. The actual
dispositions of the Brigades finally proposed by the respective
Divisional Commanders and approved by me brought about the
arrangement that the four first-line mobile Infantry Brigades were
successively, from south to north, the 15th, 8th, 12th and 4th,
while the 14th and 1st Brigades followed as supports in a second
line.</p>
<p>To each of these Infantry Brigades I allotted a Brigade of Field
Artillery, to be employed under the direct orders of the Infantry
Brigade Commander, and, in addition, three Artillery Brigades as
well as one Battery of 60-pounders, to each Divisional Commander.
As my resources in Artillery were not unlimited, the twelve
Artillery Brigades, so disposed of, were necessarily drawn from the
original eighteen Brigades which were to fire the covering
Artillery barrage for Phase A of the battle. The orders to that
portion of the Field Artillery which was to become mobile in
pursuance of this plan, accordingly, were that immediately upon the
completion of their original tasks, by the capture of the green
line, they were to "pull out of the barrage".</p>
<p>This meant, in effect, that all the teams, limbers, battery
wagons, and ammunition wagons of these twelve Brigades, waiting in
their wagon lines far in rear, fully harnessed up and hooked in at
the opening of the battle, had to advance during the progress of
the first phase, so as to reach their guns just at the right time,
but no earlier, to enable these guns to be limbered up, and the
batteries to become completely mobile in order to join and advance
with the Infantry of the second phase.</p>
<p>This was an operation which required the greatest nicety in
timing, and the greatest accuracy in execution. No Australian
Artillery had ever previously undertaken such an operation, except
perhaps on the man&oelig;uvre ground, and then only on the very
limited scale of a Brigade or two at a time. That this rapid
transition from the completely stationary to the completely mobile
battle was carried out, during the very crisis of a great
engagement, without the slightest hitch, and with only the trifling
loss of two or three gun horse teams from shell fire, reflects the
very highest credit upon every officer and man of the Australian
Field Artillery.</p>
<p>The open warfare Infantry Brigades were also to be provided, out
of their own divisional resources, each with a Company of
Engineers, a Company of Machine Guns, a Field Ambulance, and a
detachment of Pioneers, so that, in the most complete sense, they
became a Brigade Group of all arms, capable of dealing, out of
their own resources and on their own ground, with any situation
that might arise during their advance of nearly three miles from
the green to the red line. A detachment of nine tanks completed the
fighting equipment of each of the four front line Brigades destined
to capture the red line.</p>
<p>I must now briefly describe the nature of Phase C, the third and
last stage in this ambitious and complex battle programme. This
phase was to consist of "exploitation", which implies that it was a
provisional preparation, which was to be carried out only if
complete success attended the two preceding phases. The objective
of Phase C was the "blue" line, which I had located about one mile
to the east of the red line, along a system of old French trenches
extending from the river at a point near M&eacute;ricourt, and
running southerly to the railway at a point a little to the
south-east of Harbonni&egrave;res. This line gave promise of
furnishing a good defensive position in which to deal with any
possible counter-attack. It also gave a good line of departure for
subsequent operations, and provided ideal artillery positions in a
series of valleys, running parallel and a little to the west of the
line itself.</p>
<p>The troops earmarked for this Exploitation Phase were the two
second line Brigades of the two Divisions which were to capture the
red line, namely, the 14th and 1st Brigades, and the orders to the
Divisional Commanders were that if the red line was reached without
mishap, without undue loss of time, and without involving the
Reserve Brigades, but not otherwise, these Reserve Brigades were to
push on with the utmost determination to secure and hold the blue
line until such time as they could be reinforced.</p>
<p>Each of these exploitation Brigades was equipped similarly to
the red line Brigades in all respects except that they were
provided with a special contingent of 18 Mark V. (Star) Tanks of
the very latest design. These differed from the Mark V. Tank
employed at Hamel and in the other stages of the present operation,
in that they were longer and had sufficient internal space to
carry, as passengers, over and above their own crews, two complete
infantry Lewis gun detachments each. It was expected that this
infantry fire power, added to the fire power from the machine guns
carried by these 36 Tanks themselves and operated by the Tank
crews, would go far to compensate for the somewhat attenuated line
of probably tired Infantry spread in two Brigades over an ultimate
frontage of over 10,000 yards.</p>
<p>No definite time-table was laid down for the closing phases of
the battle, except for the regulation of the times when our Heavy
Artillery should "lift off" designated targets&mdash;such as
villages, farms, and known gun positions&mdash;and lengthen its
range so as not to obstruct the further advance of our own
Infantry. But it was estimated that, from the opening of the
battle, the green line would be reached in two and a half hours,
the red line in six hours, and the blue line in eight hours. As the
battle was to open at the first streak of dawn, it would, if all
went well, be completed according to plan by about midday.</p>
<p>In every battle plan, whether great or small, it is necessary
first of all to map out the whole of the intended action of the
Infantry, at any rate on the general lines indicated above. When
that has been done the next step is to work backwards, and to test
the feasibility of each body of infantry being able to reach its
allotted point of departure, punctually, without undue stress on
the troops, and without crossing or impeding the line of movement
of any other body of infantry. It is often necessary to test
minutely, by reference to calculations of time and space, more than
one alternative plan for marshalling the Infantry prior to battle,
and for the successive movements, day by day, and from point to
point, of every battalion engaged.</p>
<p>The present case was no exception, and, indeed, presented quite
special difficulties. The whole of the area for a depth of many
thousands of yards behind our then front line was open rolling
country, devoid of any cover, and (except in the actual valley of
the Somme) with every village, hamlet, farmhouse, factory and wood
obliterated. The plan involved the assembly, in this confined area,
fully exposed by day to the view of any inquisitive enemy aircraft,
of no less than 45 Infantry Battalions, with all their
paraphernalia of war; not to speak of our 600 guns of all calibres,
their wagon lines, horse lines and motor parks, together with
Engineers, Pioneers, Tanks, Medical and Supply Units amounting to
tens of thousands of men and animals.</p>
<p>A new factor which, however, ultimately controlled the final
decision which I had to make as to the nature of the dispositions
prior to battle, lay in the consideration of the maximum distances
which would have to be covered by the foot soldiers in such a
far-flung battle. I had little difficulty in coming to the
conclusion that the obvious and normal arrangement was on this
occasion a totally wrong arrangement. If the assaulting Brigades
had been arranged, from front to rear, in their assembly areas
prior to battle, in the same order as that in which they would have
to come into action, this would have involved that the individual
man, who was to be required to march and fight his way furthest
into enemy country, and, therefore, was to be the last to enter the
fight, would also be called upon to march furthest from his
rearmost position of assembly before even reaching the battle zone.
The maximum distance to be traversed on the day of battle by
infantry would have amounted, according to such a plan, to over ten
miles. While this is an easy day's march on a good road, under
tranquil conditions, it would have been an altogether unreasonable
demand upon any infantryman during the stress and nervous
excitement of battle. It would have been courting a breakdown from
over-fatigue, among the very troops upon whom I had to rely most to
defend the captured territory against any serious enemy
reaction.</p>
<p>I therefore adopted the not very obvious course of completely
reversing the normal procedure, and of disposing the Brigades in
depth, from front to rear, in exactly the reverse of the order in
which, in point of time, they would enter the battle.</p>
<p>The following represents, diagrammatically, the disposition of
all twelve Brigades after having been fully <i>deployed</i> in the
actual course of the battle:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="LF-1" id="LF-1"></a><img alt="" src=
"1302421h-images/LF-1.jpg"></p>
<p>The next diagram shows how the twelve Brigades were disposed
while Phase A of the battle was in progress, and before the second
Phase had begun:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="LF-2" id="LF-2"></a><img alt="" src=
"1302421h-images/LF-2.jpg"></p>
<p>But the following diagram represents, in a similar manner, the
order of disposition of the same Brigades, in the territory under
our own occupation, immediately <i>prior</i> to the battle:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="LF-3" id="LF-3"></a><img alt="" src=
"1302421h-images/LF-3.jpg"></p>
<p>A little consideration will show that this apparently
paradoxical procedure brought about the desired result of more
nearly equalizing the stress upon the whole of the Infantry
engaged, in point, at least, of the maximum distance to be
traversed in the day's operations. But it produced something else,
also, of much greater concern, which was that the scheme involved a
leapfrogging of Divisions during the approach march into the
battle, in addition to a second leapfrogging, to which I was
already committed, to occur at a later stage during the battle
itself.</p>
<p>Thus I was confronted with the dilemma that the only scheme of
disposition which promised success for the subsequent battle was
also that scheme which made the greatest possible demands upon the
intelligence of the troops and the sympathetic, loyal and efficient
co-operation of my own Corps Staff, and those of the Commanders
acting under me. Influenced once again by the confidence which I
felt in my whole command, I did not hesitate to increase the
complexity of the plans for the Infantry action by calling upon the
four Divisions to execute a man&oelig;uvre which is unique in the
history of war, namely, a "double leapfrog", simultaneously carried
out by two separate pairs of Divisions, operating side by side. The
first leap was to take place during the approach to the battle, the
second during the progress of the battle itself.</p>
<p>This expedient, which I finally decided to adopt, in spite of
the dangers involved in its complexity and in the absence of any
precedent, was, however, as logical analysis and the event itself
proved, the very keynote of the success of the entire project. The
whole plan, thanks to an intelligent interpretation by all
Commanders and Staffs concerned, worked like a well-oiled machine,
with smoothness, precision and punctuality, and achieved to the
fullest extent the advantages aimed at.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the stress upon the troops was reduced to a
minimum. By the reduction of physical fatigue, it conserved the
energies of whole Divisions in a manner which permitted of their
speedy re-employment in subsequent decisive operations. And on the
other hand, by the great depth of penetration which it rendered
possible, it ensured a victory which amounted to so crushing a blow
to the enemy that its momentum hurled him into a retrograde
movement, not only along the whole front under attack, but also for
many miles on either flank. This recoil he was never able to
arrest, as we followed up our victory by blow after blow delivered
while he was still reeling from the effects of the first onslaught
of August 8th.</p>
<p>But, so far, I have written of the Infantry plan only; and much
remains to be told of the simultaneous action designed to be taken
by all the other arms, which rendered possible and emphasized the
success of the Infantry. No one can rival me in my admiration for
the transcendant military virtues of the Australian Infantryman,
for his bravery, his battle discipline, his absolute reliability,
his individual resource, his initiative and endurance. But I had
formed the theory that the true r&ocirc;le of the Infantry was not
to expend itself upon heroic physical effort, nor to wither away
under merciless machine-gun fire, nor to impale itself on hostile
bayonets, nor to tear itself to pieces in hostile
entanglements&mdash;(I am thinking of Pozi&egrave;res and Stormy
Trench and Bullecourt, and other bloody fields)&mdash;but, on the
contrary, to advance under the maximum possible protection of the
maximum possible array of mechanical resources, in the form of
guns, machine guns, tanks, mortars and aeroplanes; to advance with
as little impediment as possible; to be relieved as far as possible
of the obligation to <i>fight</i> their way forward; to march,
resolutely, regardless of the din and tumult of battle, to the
appointed goal; and there to hold and defend the territory gained;
and to gather in the form of prisoners, guns and stores, the fruits
of victory.</p>
<p>It is my purpose, therefore, to emphasize particularly the
extent to which this theory was realized in the battle under
review, by the achievement of a great and decisive victory at a
trifling cost. That result was due primarily to the very ample
resources in mechanical aids which the foresight and confidence of
the Fourth Army Commander, General Rawlinson, entrusted to me; but
it was due partly, also, to the manner in which those resources
were employed. And that is why I shall attempt to describe the
remainder of the Corps plan.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<h4>THE BATTLE PLAN (<em>continued</em>)</h4>
<p>S<small>URPRISE</small> has been, from time immemorial, one of
the most potent weapons in the armoury of the tactician. It can be
achieved not merely by doing that which the enemy least
anticipates, but also by acting at a time when he least expects any
action. It was a weapon which had been employed only rarely in the
previous greater battles of this war. The offensive before Cambrai,
planned by General Sir Julian Byng, and the battle of Hamel, were
rare exceptions to our general procedure of heralding the approach
of an offensive by feverish and obvious activity on our part, and
by a long sustained preliminary bombardment of the enemy's
defences, designed to destroy his works and impair his
<em>moral</em>.</p>
<p>The situation on the Fourth Army front, early in August, 1918,
offered a rare opportunity for the employment of surprise tactics
on the boldest scale. The incessant "nibbling" activities of the
Australian troops during the preceding three months had been of
such a consistent nature as to suggest that our resources were not
equal to any greater effort upon such an extended front as we were
then holding, from the Ancre down to and beyond Villers-Bretonneux.
On the other hand, the passivity of the first French Army, to the
south of the latter town, conveyed no suggestion of any offensive
enterprise on the part of our Ally in this region.</p>
<p>The problem, therefore, was to convert an extensive front from a
state of passive defence to a state of complete preparedness for an
attack on the largest scale, and to keep the enemy&mdash;who, as
always, was alert and observant both from the ground and from the
air&mdash;in complete ignorance of every portion of these extensive
preparations, until the very moment when the battle was to burst
upon him. It was, of course, a question not merely of deceiving the
enemy troops in their trenches immediately opposed to us, but also
of arousing in the minds of the German High Command no suspicions
which might have prompted them to hold in a state of readiness, or
to put into motion towards the threatened zone, any of the reserve
Divisions forming part of their still considerable resources.</p>
<p>The following memorandum, which was issued to the whole of the
senior commanders in the Australian Corps on August 1st, gives in
outline some of the measures adopted to this end:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>"SECRECY.</small></p>
<p class="indent1">"1. The first essential to success is the
maintenance of secrecy. The means to be adopted are as follows:</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) No person is to be told or informed in any
part or way until such time as the development of the plan demands
action from him. This is the main principle and will be pursued
throughout, down to the lowest formation.</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) Divisional Commanders will work out their
reliefs in such a way as will ensure that the troops in the line
know nothing of the proposed operation until the last possible
moment. This will apply in particular to any troops who may be
employed in the area south of the
<small>AMIENS&mdash;VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small> railway.</p>
<p class="indent1">"2. In order to conceal the intention to carry
out a large operation on this front the following plan has been
adopted:</p>
<p class="indent1">"The Australian Corps has been relieved of one
divisional sector by the Third Corps, and takes over a divisional
sector from the French Corps. The object of this is to lead the
enemy, and our own people, too, to believe that the action of the
French in the Soissons salient has been so costly as to demand that
further French troops had to be made available, and that this is
the apparent cause of the extension of the Australian Corps front
to the south.</p>
<p class="indent1">"3. (a) The idea is being circulated that the
Canadian Corps is being brought to the south to take over the
r&ocirc;le of Reserve Corps at the junction of the British and
French Armies in replacement of the 22nd Corps, which occupied that
r&ocirc;le until it was ordered to the <small>CHAMPAGNE</small>
front. In order that the enemy may be deceived as to the
destination of the Canadian Corps in the event of his discovering
that it has been withdrawn from the <small>ARRAS</small> front,
Canadian wireless personnel has been sent to the Second Army area,*
where they have taken over certain wireless zones.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This was in Flanders and Belgium.]</p>
<p class="indent1">"(b) To prevent the enemy from discovering the
arrival of the Canadian Corps in this region, they will not take
over from the 4th Australian Division until 'Y' night. This will
necessitate a proportion of the troops of the Fourth Australian
Division remaining in the line in this sector until 'Y' night. As
the Fourth Australian Division will be required to participate in
the attack it is proposed to distribute one brigade to hold the
whole of the line from 'W' night onwards. This will enable the
remaining two Brigades to be withdrawn, given a day or two's rest,
and allow of their part in the operation being fully explained to
them. The place of these two Brigades in rear of the line Brigade
will be taken over by Canadian Divisions.</p>
<p class="indent1">"(c) In order to deceive our own troops as to
the cause of the coming down here of the Canadians, a rumour is
going abroad that the Canadian Corps is being brought down with the
object of relieving the Australian Corps in the line. To most of
the Australian Corps this would appear to be an obvious reason for
their coming, as the idea has been mooted on former occasions.
While it is not intended that this rumour should be promulgated, it
is not desired that anyone should disclose the actual facts. This
idea, together with the idea put forth in paragraph 3 (a), should
do much to prevent the real facts from becoming known." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The secret was, indeed, so well kept, and the
"camouflage" stories circulated proved so effective, that the King
of the Belgians forwarded a strong protest to Marshal Foch because
the Canadians were about to deliver an attack in his country,
without his having been consulted or made aware of the plans; and
the Canadian Headquarters in London complained to the War Office
that the Canadian Forces were being divided, and were being sent by
detachments to different parts of the front, instead of being
always kept together as the Canadian Government desired. It is said
that even Mr. Lloyd George knew nothing of the intention to attack
until late on the day before the battle.]</p>
<p>The references to "W", "X", "Y" and "Z" days and nights in the
above memo, are to the successive days preceding Zero
day&mdash;known briefly as "Z" day, on which the battle was to
open. The actual <em>date</em> of "Z" day was kept a close secret
by the Army Commander and the three Corps Commanders concerned,
until a few days before the actual date; while the actual moment of
assault, or "Zero" hour, was not determined or made known until
noon on the day preceding the battle, after a close study of the
conditions of visibility before and after break of day, on the
three preceding mornings.</p>
<p>But these arrangements were directed only towards the prevention
of a premature disclosure of our intention to attack to the enemy,
to our own troops, and through them to the civilian public, and to
enemy agents, whose presence among us had always to be reckoned
with. It still remained to carry out our battle preparations in a
manner which would preclude the possibility of detection by enemy
aircraft, either through direct observation, or by the help of
photography.</p>
<p>Accordingly I issued orders that all movements of troops and of
transport of all descriptions, should take place only during the
hours of darkness, whether in the forward or in the rear areas; and
in order to keep an effective control over the faithful execution
of these difficult orders, I arranged for relays of "police"
aeroplanes, furnished by our No. 3 Squadron, to fly continuously,
by day, over the whole of the Corps area, in order to detect and
report upon any observed unusual movement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the normal work on the construction of new
lines of defence, covering Amiens, in my rear areas, which had been
continuously in progress for many weeks and was still far from
complete, was to continue, with a full display of activity; so that
the enemy should be unable to infer, from a stoppage of such works,
any change in our attitude.</p>
<p>Orders were also given to discourage the usual stream of
officers who ordinarily visited our front trenches prior to an
operation, and who often, thoughtlessly, made a great display of
unusual activity, under the very noses of the enemy front line
observers, by the flourishing of maps and field-glasses, and by
bobbing up above our parapets to catch fleeting glimpses of the
country to be fought over. Such reconnaissance, however desirable,
was to be confined to a few senior Commanders and Staff Officers.
All subordinates were to rely upon the very large number of
admirable photographs, taken regularly from the air, both
vertically and obliquely, by the indefatigable Corps Air Squadron.
These served excellently as a substitute for visual observation
from the ground.</p>
<p>The prohibition against the movement of any transport in the
daylight naturally very seriously hampered the freedom of action of
the troops of all arms and services, but was felt in quite a
special degree by the whole of the Artillery. Over 600 guns of all
natures had to be dragged to and emplaced in their battle
positions, and there camouflaged, each gun involving the concurrent
movement of a number of associated vehicles. A full supply of
ammunition had to be collected from railhead, distributed by
mechanical transport to great main dumps, and thence taken by
horsed vehicles for distribution to the numerous actual
gun-pits.</p>
<p>As the amount of ammunition to be held in readiness for the
opening of the battle averaged 500 rounds per gun, it became
necessary to handle a total of about 300,000 rounds of shells and a
similar number of cartridges of all calibres, from 3&frac12; to 12
inches, not to mention fuses and primers, or the immense bulk and
weight of infantry and machine-gun ammunition, bombs, flares,
rockets, and the like, for the supply of all of which the artillery
was equally responsible.* The great amount of movement involved in
the handling and dumping of all these munitions, and the deterrent
difficulties of carrying out all such work only during the short
hours of darkness, must be left to the imagination.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The weight of supplies of all kinds exceeded
10,000 tons.]</p>
<p>The artillery was, however, confronted, for the first time, with
a difficulty of quite a different nature. In the previous years of
the war every gun, <i>after</i> being placed in its fighting pit or
position, had to be carefully "registered", by firing a series of
rounds at previously identified reference points, and noting the
errors in line or range due to the instrumental error of the gun,
which error varied with the gradual wearing-out of the gun barrel.
By these means, battery commanders were enabled to compute the
necessary corrections to be applied to any given gun, at any one
time or place, so as to ensure that the gun would fire true to the
task set.</p>
<p>Such registration naturally involved, for a large number of
guns, a very considerable volume of Artillery fire, the extent of
which would speedily disclose to the enemy the presence of a
largely increased mass of Artillery, and would inevitably lead him
to the conclusion that some mischief was afoot. Fortunately,
however, the rapid evolution during the war of scientific methods
had by this juncture placed at my disposal a means of ascertaining
the instrumental error of the guns on a testing ground located many
miles behind the battle zone. This method was known as
"calibration", and consisted of the firing of the gun through a
series of wired screens, placed successively at known distances
from the muzzle of the gun. The whole elements of the flight of the
projectile could then be accurately determined by recording the
intervals of time between its passage through the respective
screens. From these data could be deduced the muzzle velocity, the
jump, the droop and the lateral error of each gun.</p>
<p>Simple and obvious as was the principle of such an experiment,
the merit of the new process of calibration lay in the remarkable
rapidity and accuracy with which the electric and photographic
mechanism employed made the necessary delicate time observations,
correct to small fractions of a second, and automatically deduced
the mathematical results required. The calibration hut, in which
this mechanism was housed, became one of the show spots to which
visitors to the Corps area were taken to be overawed by the
scientific methods of our gunners.</p>
<p>In the early days of August the calibration range of the
Australian Corps was a scene of feverish activity. All day long,
battery after battery of guns could be seen route-marching to the
testing ground, going through the performance of firing six rounds
per gun, and then route-marching back again the same night to its
allotted battle position. So rapid was the procedure that long
before he had reached his destination the Battery Commander had
received the full error sheet of every one of his guns, and by
means of it was enabled to go into action whenever required without
any previous registration whatever. This great advance in the art
of gunnery contributed in the most direct manner to the result that
when these 600 guns opened their tornado of fire upon the enemy at
daybreak on August 8th, the very presence in this area of most of
them remained totally unsuspected.</p>
<p>The manner of the employment of the ponderous mass of Heavy
Artillery at my disposal will be referred to later. The action of
that portion of the Field Artillery which was to become mobile in
the concluding phases of the battle has already been dealt with. It
remains only to describe, in outline, the arrangements made for the
normal barrage fire of the Field Artillery during the first
phase.</p>
<p>It has been my invariable practice to reduce the barrage plan to
the simplest possible elements, avoiding in every direction the
over-elaboration so frequently encountered. By following these
principles not only is the actual preparatory work of the Artillery
greatly reduced in bulk and simplified in quality, but also the
liability to mistake and to erratic shooting of individual
batteries or guns, and consequent risks of damage to our own
Infantry, are greatly diminished. These advantages are bought at
the small price of calling upon the Infantry to undertake, before
the battle, such rectifications and adjustments of our front line
as would accommodate themselves to a straight and simple barrage
line. This is in sharp contrast to the much more usual procedure
which prevailed (and persisted in other Corps to the end of the
war) of complicating the barrage enormously in an attempt to make
it conform to the tortuous configuration of our Infantry front
line.</p>
<p>For the present battle it was accordingly arranged that the
barrage should open on a line which was <i>dead straight</i> for
the whole 7,000 yards of our front, and the Infantry tape lines,**
which were to mark the alignment of the Infantry at the moment of
launching the assault, were to be laid exactly 200 yards in rear of
this Artillery "start line". The barrage was to advance, in exactly
parallel lines, 100 yards at a time, at equal rates along the whole
frontage. These rates were 100 yards every 3 minutes, for the first
24 minutes, and thereafter 100 yards every 4 minutes, until the
conclusion of the time-table at 143 minutes after Zero. By such a
simple plan every one of the 432 field guns engaged was given a
task of uniform character.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Chapter XIII.]</p>
<p>Great as was the care necessary to conceal all Artillery
preparations, it required still greater thought and consideration
to keep entirely secret the presence behind the battle front of
some 160 Tanks, and particularly to conceal their approach march
into the battle. To both combatants, the arrival of a Tank, or
anything that could be mistaken on an air photograph for a Tank,
had for long been regarded as a sure indication of coming trouble.
And, therefore, imputing to the enemy the same keenness to detect,
in good time, the presence of Tanks, and the same nervousness which
we had been accustomed to feel when prisoners' tales of the coming
into the war of enormous hordes of German monsters had been
crystallized by the reports of some excited observer into a
definite suspicion that the fateful hour had arrived, I considered
it wise to repeat on a much elaborated scale all the precautions of
secrecy first employed for this purpose at Hamel.</p>
<p>It is quite easy to detect from an air photograph the broad,
corrugated track made by a Tank, if the ground be soft and muddy
enough to record such an impression. Consequently, Tanks were
forbidden to move across ploughed fields or marshy land, and were
confined to hard surface. They moved only in small bodies, and only
at night, and were carefully stabled, during the daylight, in the
midst of village ruins, or under the deep shade of woods and
thickets. Thus, by daily stages, and by cautious bounds, each Tank
or group of Tanks ultimately reached its appointed assembly ground,
from which it was to make its last leap into the thick of the
battle, where it would arrive precisely at Zero hour.</p>
<p>But that last leap was just the whole difficulty. For the Tank
is a noisy brute, and it was just as imperative to make him
inaudible as to make him invisible. By a fortunate chance, the
noise and buzz made by the powerful petrol engines of a Tank are so
similar to those of the engines of a large-sized bombing plane, as
for example of the Handley-Page type, especially if the latter be
flying at a comparatively low altitude, that from a little distance
off it is quite impossible to distinguish the one sound from the
other.</p>
<p>It was therefore possible to adopt the conjurer's trick of
directing the special attention of the observer to those things
which do not particularly matter, in order to distract his
attention from other things which really do matter very much. In
other words, a flight of high-power bombing planes was kept flying
backwards and forwards over the battle front during the whole of
that very hour, just before dawn, during which our 160 Tanks were
loudly and fussily buzzing their way forward, along carefully
reconnoitred routes, marked by special black and white tapes,
across that last mile of country which brought them up level with
the infantry at the precise moment when the great battle was
ushered in by the belching forth of a volcano of Artillery
fire.</p>
<p>The subterfuge succeeded to perfection, as was obvious to
observers and confirmed by the subsequent narratives of prisoners.
The German trench garrisons and trench observers were fully
occupied in listening to the hum of the bombing planes, in watching
their threatened visitation for their customary "egg" dropping
performances, in engaging them with rifle fire, and in holding
themselves in readiness to duck for cover should they come too
near. They never suspected for a moment that this was merely a new
stratagem of "noise camouflage", and that the real danger was
stalking steadily and relentlessly towards them over the whole
front, upon the surface of the ground, instead of in the air.</p>
<p>But the trick would not have succeeded so well, or would perhaps
have failed altogether, if the employment of those planes had been
confined to the morning of the battle. Such an unusual
demonstration might have aroused vague suspicions sufficient to
justify a "stand to arms" and a preparedness for some further
activity on our part. And what we had most to fear was the danger
of "giving the show away" in the last ten minutes. For it would
have taken much less than that time for nervous German trench
sentries, by the firing of signal rockets, to bring down upon our
front line trenches, crowded as they were with expectant fighters,
a murderous fire from the German Artillery.</p>
<p>Consequently the puzzled enemy was treated to the spectacle of
an early morning promenade by these same bombing planes on every
morning, for an hour before dawn, during several mornings preceding
the actual battle day. Doubtless the first morning's exhibition of
such apparently aimless air activity in the darkness really
startled him. After two or three repetitions, it merely earned his
contempt. By the time the actual date arrived he treated it as
negligible. All prisoners interrogated subsequently agreed that
neither the presence nor the noisy approach of so mighty a phalanx
of Tanks had been in the least suspected up to the very moment when
they plunged into view out of the darkness, just as day was
breaking.</p>
<p>The force of Tanks placed at my disposal for the purposes of
this battle comprised the 2nd, 8th and 13th Tank Battalions,
commanded respectively by Lieut.-Colonels Bryce, Bingham and Lyon,
all under the 5th Tank Brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General
Courage. All these Tanks were of the Mark V. type, as used at
Hamel; but there were also attached to the same Brigade a Battalion
of Mark V. (Star) Tanks, of still later design, under
Lieut.-Colonel Ramsay-Fairfax, and also a full Company of 24
Carrying Tanks, under Major Partington. These Carrying Tanks were
not employed in fighting, but were of wonderful utility in the
rapid transport of stores of all descriptions across the battle
zone; and in carrying the wounded out of the battle on their return
journey. I am confident that each of these Tanks was capable of
doing the work of at least 200 men, with an almost complete
immunity from casualty.</p>
<p>There were thus available to me 168 Tanks in all, and their
dispositions have been already indicated in sufficient detail in
Chapter V. It was a definite feature of the whole plan of battle
that the combined Tank and Infantry tactics which had proved so
successful in the Hamel operation, and which have been described in
Chapter II., were to be employed and exploited to their utmost.
Each Tank became thereby definitely associated with a specified
body of Infantry, and acted during the actual battle under the
immediate orders of the Commander of that body: the working rule
was "one Tank, one Company".</p>
<p>To this was added the second working principle of "one Tank, one
task", which rules meant, in their practical application, that no
individual Tank was to be relied upon to serve more than one body
of Infantry, nor to carry out more than one phase of the battle.
Elementary as this may sound, it involved this striking advantage
that, in the event of any one Tank becoming disabled, its loss
would impair no portion of the battle plan other than that fraction
of it to which that Tank had been allotted.</p>
<p>Thus, the whole of the Infantry operating in Phases B and C of
the battle had each their own adequate equipment of Tanks, which
would be certain to be available to them, even if the whole of the
Tanks employed during Phase A had been knocked out. At the same
time clear orders were issued, and due arrangements were made, that
all Tanks which survived Phase A, and whose crews were not by then
too exhausted, were to rally (during the 100 minutes' pause on the
green line) in order to co-operate in the succeeding phases of the
fight.</p>
<p>There was still another Unit, coming under the jurisdiction of
the Tank Corps, which proved of wonderful utility to me, and which
deserved quite special mention. This was the 17th Armoured Car
Battalion, organized into two companies of eight cars each. Each
car carried one forward and one rear Hotchkiss gun. It was heavily
armoured, and the crew operating the guns, as also the car driver,
were protected from all except direct hits by Artillery. The cars
had a speed of 20 miles per hour, either, forwards or backwards.
The Battalion was under the command of Lieut.-Colonel E.J. Carter,
an officer of the British Cavalry. I allotted 12 cars to the use of
the 5th Australian Division, under Major-General Hobbs, who would
be likely to find specially useful employment for them, in scouring
the network of roads beyond his final objective; and retained four
cars in Corps reserve for a special reconnaissance enterprise.</p>
<p>Full of promise of usefulness as were the speed and armament of
these cars, they suffered from one serious disability. Their top
hamper was so heavy compared to their light chassis that they could
not be relied upon to travel without premature breakdown across
country, or indeed on anything but moderately good roads. Now, such
roads were certainly available, as was evident from aeroplane
photographs, in the enemy's back country, after a zone for a mile
or two immediately behind his front line was passed; but all the
subsidiary roads in that zone had been practically obliterated by
shell-craters, and even the great main road from Villers-Bretonneux
to Saint Quentin, which is a Roman Road and substantially
constructed throughout, was known to have been cut up and traversed
by numerous trenches both on our side and on the enemy's side of
"No Man's Land". There was also every expectation that the few
remaining trees which flanked this great road would be felled by
our bombardment, and some of them would surely fall across and
obstruct the roadway.</p>
<p>That road was, however, the only possible outlet into enemy
country for the armoured cars, and I resolved upon a special
programme, and the allotment of a special body of troops for its
execution. The object was to ensure that the cars could be taken
across the impracticable and obstructed stretch of roadway already
described, and launched at the enemy at its eastern extremity, at
the earliest possible moment of time. Then, before the numerous
enemy Corps and Divisional Headquarters and all their rear
organization had time to get clear intelligence of what was
happening at the front, or to recover from the first shock of
surprise, these Armoured Cars would fall upon them, and, travelling
hither and thither at great speed, would spread death, destruction
and confusion in all directions.</p>
<p>A whole Battalion of Pioneers, and detachments of other
technical troops, with an adequate amount of road-repairing
material, were got ready, under the direct orders of my Chief
Engineer, to carry out this special task. All trenches in that
portion of the road lying within our own zone of occupation were
bridged or filled in and all obstructions cleared away before the
day of the battle. But as to the more distant stretch of the road,
still in the hands of the enemy, elaborate preparations were made,
by a careful and detailed distribution of tasks to small gangs of
men, and by a fully worked-out time-table. The plan was that from
the moment of the opening of the battle, this road repair work was
to commence, and its advance was to synchronize with the advance of
the Artillery barrage and Infantry skirmishing line.</p>
<p>A pilot armoured car was to follow the working gangs in order to
test the sufficiency of the repair work, and arrangements were made
for sending back signals to the remainder of the cars, lying
waiting in readiness in the shelter of Villers-Bretonneux. It was
planned that the first two miles of road would, by these means, be
cleared and repaired to a sufficient width, within four hours after
the opening of the battle.</p>
<p>I am tempted to anticipate the narrative of the battle by saying
that the whole plan worked out with complete success to the last
detail. The cars got through punctually to time, and the story of
their subsequent adventures, as told later, reads like a romance.
As indicating the importance which I attached to this little
enterprise, which in magnitude was quite a small "side-show", but
which in its results had the most far-reaching consequence, I
reproduce below the full text (omitting merely formal portions) of
one of the several orders issued by me on this subject:</p>
<p align="right">Australian Corps,<br>
7th August, 1918.</p>
<p class="indent1">1. The detachment of the 17th Armoured Car
Battalion held in Corps Reserve (2 sections each of 2 cars), will
be employed on the special duty of long distance reconnaissance on
"Z" day.</p>
<p class="indent1">2. These sections will be sent forward under the
orders of the C.O., 17th Armoured Car Battalion, passing the green
line as soon as practicable after Zero plus four hours, and
proceeding eastward, following the lifts of our Heavy Artillery
bombardment, so as to pass the blue line at or after Zero plus five
hours.</p>
<p class="indent1">3. The area to be reconnoitred lies in the bend
of the Somme, north of the Villers-Bretonneux&mdash;Chaulnes
Railway; but the old Somme battlefield lying N.E. of Chaulnes need
not be entered.</p>
<p class="indent1">4. Information is required as to presence,
distribution and movement of enemy supporting and reserve troops,
and his defensive organizations within this area.</p>
<p class="indent1">5. While the primary function of this detachment
is to reconnoitre and not to fight, except defensively, advantage
should be taken of every opportunity to damage the enemy's
telephonic and telegraphic communications.</p>
<p class="indent1">6. The following information as to enemy
organizations is thought to be reliable:</p>

<hr class="2">
<p>The Heavy Artillery of the Corps was divided, for this battle as
normally, into two distinct groups, of which the one, or
Bombardment Group, was to devote its energies to destructive
attack, throughout the course of the battle, upon known enemy
centres of resistance, suspected Headquarters, and telephone or
telegraph exchanges, villages believed to be housing support and
reserve troops, railway junctions and the like. The selection of
all such targets depended upon a judicious choice of many tempting
objectives disclosed by the very comprehensive records of the
highly efficient Intelligence Officers belonging to my Heavy
Artillery Headquarters. After that selection was made, all that
remained was to draw up a time-table for the action of all
bombardment guns which would ensure that they would lift off any
given target just before our own Infantry would be likely to reach
it, and then to apply their fire to a more distant locality.</p>
<p>The second group of Heavy Guns was known as the Counter-battery
Group, and was at all times under the direction of a special staff,
especially skilled in all the scientific means at our disposal for
determining the position and distribution of the enemy's Artillery,
and in the methods and artifices for silencing or totally
destroying it. Just as it was the special r&ocirc;le of the Tanks
to deal with the enemy machine guns, so it was the special
r&ocirc;le of our Counter-battery Artillery to deal with the
enemy's field and heavy guns and howitzers. These&mdash;the guns
and the machine guns&mdash;were the only things that troubled us;
because, for the German soldier individually, our Australian
infantryman is and always has been more than a match.</p>
<p>Very special care was, therefore, devoted to the whole of the
arrangements, first for carefully ascertaining beforehand the
actual or probable position of every enemy gun that could be
brought to bear on our Infantry, and then for allocating as many
heavy guns as could be spared, each with a task appropriate to its
range and hit ting-power, to the destruction or suppression of the
selected target. For it served the immediate purpose of eliminating
the causes of molestation to our advancing Infantry equally well,
whether the enemy gun was merely silenced by a sustained fire of
shrapnel or high explosives which drove off the gun detachment, or
by a flood of gas which compelled them to put on their gas masks,
or whether it was actually destroyed by a direct hit and rendered
permanently useless.</p>
<p>The days before the battle were of supreme interest in this
particular aspect. Each day I visited the Counter-battery Staff
Officer, in his modest shanty, hidden away in the interior of a
leafy wood, where in constant touch, by telephone, with all
balloons, observers and sound-ranging stations, and surrounded by
an imposing array of maps, studded with pins of many shapes and
colours, he made his daily report to me of the enemy gun positions
definitely identified or located, or found to have been vacated.
And here again there was an opportunity for the display of a modest
little stratagem. Having suspected or verified the fact that the
enemy had altered the location of any given battery, leaving the
empty gun pits as a tempting bait to us, fruitlessly to expend our
energies and ammunition upon them&mdash;it would have been the
worst of folly to prove to him that he had failed to fool us, by
engaging his battery in its new position.</p>
<p>On the contrary, we deliberately allowed ourselves to be fooled;
and for several days before the great battle we intentionally
committed the stupid error of methodically engaging all his empty
gun positions. No doubt the German gunners laughed consumedly as
they watched, from a safe distance, our wasted efforts; but they
did not, doubtless, laugh quite so heartily when at dawn on the
great day, the whole weight of our attack from over a hundred of my
heaviest Counter-battery guns fells upon them in the new positions,
which they believed that we had failed to detect.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Service of the Corps was an extensive and
highly organized department, whose jurisdiction extended throughout
all the Divisions, Brigades and Battalions. Its routine work
comprised the collection and collation of the daily flow of
information from a large staff of observers in the forward zone,
from the interrogation of prisoners, from the examination of
documents and maps, and from neighbouring Corps and Armies. Before
and during battle, however, a greatly added burden fell upon the
shoulders of the Intelligence Staff.</p>
<p>Closely associated with this branch of the Staff work were two
activities of quite special interest. The Australian Corps
organized a Topographical Section, manned by expert draftsmen and
lithographers, who compiled and printed all the maps required
throughout the whole Corps, and it was their business to keep all
battle maps, barrage maps and topographical data recorded and
corrected up to date. This alone proved a heavy task when pace had
to be kept with a rapid advance. At such times the maps prepared on
one day became obsolete two or three days later.</p>

<br>
<p>The issue of such maps was not confined to Commanders and
Staffs. For all important operations, large numbers of handy
sectional maps were struck off, so that they could be placed in the
hands even of the subordinate officers and non-commissioned
officers. These maps not only enabled the most junior leaders to
study their objectives and tasks in detail before every battle, but
also became a convenient vehicle for sending back reports as to the
positions reached or occupied by front-line troops or detached
parties. On occasions as many as five thousand of such maps would
be struck off for the use of the troops, in a single operation.</p>
<p>There was also a branch of the Intelligence Staff attached to
the No. 3 Australian Air Squadron. Its special business was to
print and distribute large numbers of photographs, both vertical
and oblique, taken from the air over the territory to be
captured&mdash;showing trenches, wire, roads, hedges and many other
features of paramount interest to the troops. Thousands of such
photographs were distributed before every battle.</p>
<p>The important considerations, in regard both to maps and
photographs, were that on the one hand, they were of priceless
value to all who understood how to read and use them, and on the
other hand, the event proved that their issue was in no sense
labour in vain, for the keen interest taken, even by the private
soldiers, in these facilities contributed powerfully to the success
and precision with which all battle orders were carried out, and
this more than repaid us for the additional trouble involved. It
was inspiriting to me to see, on the eve of every great battle, as
I made my round of the troops, numerous small groups of men
gathered around their sergeant or corporal, eagerly discussing
these maps and the photographs and the things they disclosed, the
lie of the land, the wire, the trenches, the probable machine-gun
posts, the dug-outs and the suspected enemy strong points.</p>
<p>My account of the details prepared for the battle of August 8th
is not nearly complete; but the demands of space forbid any more
informative reference to numerous other essential ingredients of
the plan than a mere recital of some of them. Thus, for example, it
was necessary to decide the action of all Machine Guns, both those
used collectively under Corps control, and those left to be handled
by the Divisions; the employment of Smoke Tactics, by the use of
smoke screens created both by mortars from the ground and by
phosphorus bombs dropped from the air; the use to be made of all
the technical troops (Engineers and Pioneers) in bridging, road and
railway repairs and field fortifications; the arrangements for the
medical evacuation of the wounded, and for the collection and
safe-keeping of the anticipated haul of prisoners, the
synchronization of watches throughout the whole command, so that
action should occur punctually at a common clock time; and last,
but not least, the establishment of the machinery of liaison
internally between all the numerous formations of the Australian
Corps, and also externally with my flank Corps, the Canadians,
under Currie, on my right, and the British Third Corps, under
Butler, on my left.</p>
<p>Such, in outline, were my battle plans and my preparations for
what I hoped would prove an operation of decisive influence upon
the future of the campaign. The immediate results, which could be
estimated on the spot and at the time, and the admissions of
Ludendorff, which came to light only many months afterwards,
combine to show that I was not mistaken.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<h4>THE CHASE BEGINS</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> preliminary movements of Divisions were duly
carried out without special difficulty. The Fifth Australian
Division was relieved on August 1st by a Division of the Third
Corps, in that part of the Corps front which lay north of the
Somme, and passed into Corps Reserve, in a rear area, there to
undergo training with Tanks, and to prepare itself for the work
which it had to do.</p>
<p>The Fourth Australian Division, from Corps Reserve, took over
the French front, as far south as the Amiens-Roye road on August
2nd, and on the next night took over from the Second Australian
Division all that part of its front which lay south of the railway,
thus disposing itself upon what was ultimately to become the battle
front of the Canadian Corps.</p>
<p>On the same night, the Second and Third Divisions, who had thus
been left in sole occupation of the sector which was to be the
Australian Corps battle front, carried out a readjustment of their
own mutual boundary, which would place each of these two Divisions
upon its own proper battle front.</p>
<p>On the night of August 4th, the Second and Third Divisions
rearranged their defensive dispositions so that each of them
deployed only a single Brigade for the passive defence of its
front, and withdrew to its rear area its remaining two Brigades,
who were thus afforded three clear days to complete their internal
preparations.</p>
<p>The Canadian Corps commenced to arrive, and on August 4th two
Canadian Brigades relieved two Brigades of the Fourth Division,
thereby releasing them so that they also might commence to prepare
for the battle. It was originally intended that the last Brigade of
the Fourth Division should also be relieved by Canadians on August
6th, when an untoward incident happened, which caused considerable
alarm and speculation; and it led to a modification of this part of
the plan.</p>
<p>The 13th Australian Brigade (of the Fourth Division) was on
August 4th spread out upon a front of over six thousand yards. It
had no option but to leave the greater part of the front-line
trenches unoccupied, and to defend its area with a series of small,
but isolated, posts. On that night, one of these posts, in the
vicinity of the road to Roye,* was raided by the enemy, and the
whole of its occupants, comprising a sergeant and four or five men,
were surrounded and taken prisoner.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Map J.]</p>
<p>It was an unusual display of enterprise on the part of the
enemy, at this point of time and in this locality. Whether it had
been inspired by sneering criticisms from behind his line of the
nature which have been quoted, or whether signs of unusual movement
or a changed attitude on the part of our trench garrison had
instigated a suspicion that something was happening which required
investigation, could only be surmised. But the fact remained that
five Australians had been taken, at a place several miles south of
the southernmost point hitherto occupied by "the English".</p>
<p>The side-stepping of the Australian Corps southwards had thereby
become known to the enemy, and it was necessary to estimate the
deductions which he would be likely to draw from that discovery.
Much depended upon the behaviour of these prisoners. Would they
talk? and, if so, what did they know? That Australian captives
would not volunteer information likely to imperil the lives of
their comrades, might be taken for granted, but German Intelligence
Officers had means at their disposal to draw from prisoners,
unwittingly, anything they might know.</p>
<p>We could only hope, under the circumstances, that these men
really did know nothing of our intention to attack; and that, if
they had become aware of the presence of Canadian troops in the
rear areas, they would believe the story which we had sedulously
spread, that the Canadians were merely coming to relieve the
Australian Corps, so that it might have a long rest after its
heroic labours.</p>
<p>Not many weeks afterwards it was my good fortune to capture a
German Headquarters, in which were found Intelligence Reports
containing a narrative of this very incident. The importance of the
capture of these men had been recognized, and they had been taken
far behind the lines for an exhaustive examination. But, despite
all efforts of the German Intelligence Staff, they had refused to
disclose anything whatever but their names and units&mdash;which
they were bound to do under the rules of war. The report went on to
praise their soldierly bearing and loyal reticence, and held up
these brave Australians as a model to be followed by their own men,
adding that such a demeanour could only earn the respect of an
enemy.</p>
<p>The alarm which this untoward happening created on our side of
the line led to a determination to redouble our precautions. The
Army Commander proposed, and I agreed, that the relief of the 13th
Brigade by Canadians, <i>prior</i> to the eve of the battle, was
out of the question, as being too risky. It was decided that the
13th Brigade must remain in the line until the very last.</p>
<p>This decision deprived General Maclagan of one of his three
Brigades, and as it would be asking too much of the Fourth Division
to carry out the r&ocirc;le which had been allotted to it in the
battle, with only two Brigades, I decided that the only thing to be
done was to transfer to the Fourth Division, temporarily, one of
the Brigades of the First Division, which was to arrive from the
north in the course of the next three days.</p>
<p>Urgent telegrams were therefore despatched to accelerate the
arrival of one of the Brigades of the First Division. In due course
the First Australian Brigade (Mackay) arrived by four special
trains on the night of August 6th, in sufficient time to enable it
to take its place in General Maclagan's order of battle, in
substitution for the 13th Brigade. The 13th Brigade was destined to
have some further stirring adventures before it again joined its
own Division.</p>
<p>The day preceding the great battle arrived all too soon. The
prospect of an advance had sent a thrill through all ranks and
expectation became tense. The use of the telephone had been ordered
to be restricted, especially in the forward areas; for it was known
that the enemy was in possession of listening apparatus, similar to
our own, by which conversations on the telephone could be tapped,
and unguarded references to the impending operations could be
overheard.</p>
<p>Final inspections had, therefore, to be made, and final
injunctions administered, by Commanders and Staffs traversing long
distances over the extensive Corps area by motor car and horse, and
even on foot. A strange and ominous quiet pervaded the scene; it
was only when the explosion of a stray enemy shell would cause
hundreds of heads to peer out from trenches, gun-pits and
underground shelters, that one became aware that the whole country
was really packed thick with a teeming population carefully hidden
away.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon of that last day came another note of
alarm. To the Fourth and Fifth Australian Divisions had been
allotted eighteen Store and Carrying Tanks. These had been brought
the night before, into a small plantation lying about half a mile
to the north of Villers-Bretonneux, loaded to their utmost capacity
with battle stores of all descriptions: reserves of food and water,
rifle ammunition, and a large reserve of Stokes Mortar bombs; also
considerable supplies of petrol, to satisfy the ravenous appetites
of the Tanks themselves.</p>
<p>This locality-suddenly became the object of the closest
attention by the enemy's Artillery. He began to deluge it with such
a volume of fire that in less than half an hour a great
conflagration had been started, which did not subside until fifteen
of the Tanks and all their valuable cargo had been reduced to
irretrievable ruin.</p>
<p>Had some unusually keen enemy observer perceived the presence of
Tanks in our area, and would that knowledge have disclosed to him
our jealously guarded secret? Fortunately, my Artillery Commander,
Brigadier-General Coxen, making his last rounds of the Battery
positions, was an eye-witness of the whole occurrence, and was able
to reassure me. A chance shell&mdash;the last of a dozen fired
entirely at random into our area&mdash;fell into the very centre of
this group of Tanks, and set fire to some of the petrol. The
resulting cloud of smoke became a signal to the enemy that
something was burning which our men would probably attempt to
salve; and in consonance with an entirely correct Artillery
procedure, he at once concentrated a heavy fire upon the spot.</p>
<p>That incident is typical of the perturbations through which all
responsible Commanders have to pass on such occasions. The
occurrence was explained as accidental, and implied no premature
discovery by the enemy. Nothing remained but to repair the damage,
and make special arrangements to replenish the Stores which these
Divisions had lost.</p>
<p>On the forenoon of the day before the battle, the following
message was promulgated to all the troops:</p>
<p align="right">Corps
Headquarters,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

August 7th, 1918.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><small>TO THE SOLDIERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARMY CORPS.</small></p>
<p class="indent1">For the first time in the history of this Corps,
all five Australian Divisions will to-morrow engage in the largest
and most important battle operation ever undertaken by the
Corps.</p>
<p class="indent1">They will be supported by an exceptionally
powerful Artillery, and by Tanks and Aeroplanes on a scale never
previously attempted. The full resources of our sister Dominion,
the Canadian Corps, will also operate on our right, while two
British Divisions will guard our left flank.</p>
<p class="indent1">The many successful offensives which the
Brigades and Battalions of this Corps have so brilliantly executed
during the past four months have been but the prelude to, and the
preparation for, this greatest and culminating effort.</p>
<p class="indent1">Because of the completeness of our plans and
dispositions, of the magnitude of the operations, of the number of
troops employed, and of the depth to which we intend to overrun the
enemy's positions, this battle will be one of the most memorable of
the whole war; and there can be no doubt that, by capturing our
objectives, we shall inflict blows upon the enemy which will make
him stagger, and will bring the end appreciably nearer.</p>
<p class="indent1">I entertain no sort of doubt that every
Australian soldier will worthily rise to so great an occasion, and
that every man, imbued with the spirit of victory, will, in spite
of every difficulty that may confront him, be animated by no other
resolve than grim determination to see through to a clean finish,
whatever his task may be.</p>
<p class="indent1">The work to be done to-morrow will perhaps make
heavy demands upon the endurance and staying powers of many of you;
but I am confident that, in spite of excitement, fatigue, and
physical strain, every man will carry on to the utmost of his
powers until his goal is won; for the sake of
<small>AUSTRALIA</small>, the Empire and our cause.</p>
<p class="indent1">I earnestly wish every soldier of the Corps the
best of good fortune, and a glorious and decisive victory, the
story of which will re-echo throughout the world, and will live for
ever in the history of our home land.</p>
<p align="right"><small>JOHN
MONASH</small>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Lieut.-General.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Cmdg. Australian Corps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Not many days afterwards a copy of this order fell into the
hands of the enemy, and the use he tried to make of it, to his own
grave discomfiture, as the event proved, is an interesting story
which will be told in due course.</p>
<p>Zero hour was fixed for twenty minutes past four, on the morning
of August 8th. It needs a pen more facile than I can command to
describe, and an imagination more vivid to realize the stupendous
import of the last ten minutes. In black darkness, a hundred
thousand infantry, deployed over twelve miles of front, are
standing grimly, silently, expectantly, in readiness to advance, or
are already crawling stealthily forward to get within eighty yards
of the line on which the barrage will fall; all feel to make sure
that their bayonets are firmly locked, or to set their steel
helmets firmly on their heads; Company and Platoon Commanders,
their whistles ready to hand, are nervously glancing at their
luminous watches, waiting for minute after minute to go
by&mdash;and giving a last look over their commands&mdash;ensuring
that their runners are by their sides, their observers alert, and
that the officers detailed to control direction have their
compasses set and ready. Carrying parties shoulder their burdens,
and adjust the straps; pioneers grasp their picks and shovels;
engineers take up their stores of explosives and primers and fuses;
machine and Lewis gunners whisper for the last time to the carriers
of their magazines and belt boxes to be sure and follow up. The
Stokes Mortar carrier slings his heavy load, and his loading
numbers fumble to see that their haversacks of cartridges are
handy. Overhead drone the aeroplanes, and from the rear, in
swelling chorus, the buzzing and clamour of the Tanks grows every
moment louder and louder. Scores of telegraph operators sit by
their instruments with their message forms and registers ready to
hand, bracing themselves for the rush of signal traffic which will
set in a few moments later; dozens of Staff Officers spread their
maps in readiness, to record with coloured pencils the stream of
expected information. In hundreds of pits, the guns are already run
up, loaded and laid on their opening lines of fire; the sergeant is
checking the range for the last time; the layer stands silently
with the lanyard in his hand. The section officer, watch on wrist,
counts the last seconds: "A minute to go"&mdash;"Thirty
seconds"&mdash;"Ten seconds"&mdash;"Fire".</p>
<p>And, suddenly, with a mighty roar, more than a thousand guns
begin the symphony. A great illumination lights up the Eastern
horizon; and instantly the whole complex organization, extending
far back to areas almost beyond earshot of the guns, begins to move
forward; every man, every unit, every vehicle and every Tank on
their appointed tasks and to their designated goals; sweeping
onward relentlessly and irresistibly. Viewed from a high vantage
point and in the glimmer of the breaking day, a great Artillery
barrage surely surpasses in dynamic splendour any other
manifestation of collective human effort.</p>
<p>The Artillery barrage dominates the battle, and the landscape.
The field is speedily covered with a cloak of dust, and smoke and
spume, making impossible any detailed observation, at the time, of
the course of the battle as a whole. The story can only be
indifferently pieced together, long after, by an attempted
compilation of the reports of a hundred different participants,
whose narratives are usually much impaired by personal bias, by the
nervous excitement of the moment, and by an all too limited range
of vision. That is why no comprehensive account yet exists of some
of the major battles of the war, and why those partial narratives
hitherto produced are so often in conflict.</p>
<p>In so great a battle as this, only the broad facts and tangible
results can be placed on record without danger of controversy. The
whole immense operation proceeded according to plan in every
detail, with a single exception, to which I must specially refer
later on. The first phase, controlled as it was by the barrage
time-table, necessarily ended punctually, and with the whole of the
green line objective in our hands. This success gave us possession
of nearly all the enemy's guns, so that his artillery retaliation
speedily died down.</p>
<p>The captures in this phase were considerable, and few of the
garrisons of the enemy's forward offensive zone escaped destruction
or capture. The Second and Third Divisions had a comparative "walk
over", and they had come to a halt, with their tasks completed,
before 7 a.m.</p>
<p>The "open warfare" phase commenced at twenty minutes past eight,
and both the red and the blue lines were captured in succession
half-an-hour ahead of scheduled time. This capture covered the
whole length of my front except the extreme left, where a half
expected difficulty arose, but one which exercised no influence
upon the day's success.</p>
<p>The Canadians, on my right, had a similar story to tell; they
had driven far into the enemy's defences, exactly as planned. In
spite of the difficulties of observation, the recurrence of a
ground mist of the same nature as we had experienced at Hamel, and
the long distances over which messages and reports had to
travel&mdash;the stream of information which reached me, by
telegraph, telephone, pigeon and aeroplane was so full and ample
that I was not left for a moment out of touch with the situation.
The "inwards" messages are, naturally, far too voluminous for
reproduction; but a brief selection from the many "outwards"
messages telegraphed during that day to the Fourth Army
Headquarters, and which, on a point of responsibility, I made it an
invariable rule to draft myself, will give some indication of the
course of events as they became known:</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 7 a.m.:</i> "Everything going well at
6.45 a.m. Heavy ground mist facilitating our advance, but delaying
information. Infantry and Tanks got away punctually. Our attack was
a complete surprise. Gailly Village and Accroche Wood captured.
Enemy artillery has ceased along my whole front. Flanks Corps
apparently doing well."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 8.30 a.m.:</i> "Although not
definitely confirmed, no doubt that our first objective green line
captured along whole Corps front including Gailly, Warfusee,
Lamotte and whole Cerisy Valley. Many guns and prisoners taken.
Infantry and Artillery for second phase moving up to green
line."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 10.55 a.m.:</i> "Fifteenth Battalion
has captured Cerisy with 300 prisoners. Advance to red line going
well."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 11.10 a.m.:</i> "Have taken Morcourt
and Bayon-villers and many additional prisoners and guns. We are
nearing our second objective and have reached it in places. My
Cavalry Brigade has passed across our red line. We are now
advancing to our final objective blue line."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 12.15 p.m.:</i> "Hobbs has captured
Harbonni&egrave;res and reached blue line final objective on his
whole front."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 1.15 p.m.:</i> "Australian flag
hoisted over Harbonni&egrave;res at midday to-day. Should be glad
if Chief would cable this to our Governor-General on behalf of
Australian Corps."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 2.5 p.m.:</i> "Total Australian
casualties through dressing stations up to 12 noon under 600.
Prisoners actually counted exceed 4,000. Many more coming in."</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 4.40 p.m.:</i> "Captured enemy Corps
H.Q. near Framerville shortly after noon to-day." (This was the
51st German Corps).</p>
<p class="indent1"><i>Sent at 8 p.m.:</i> "Corps captures will
greatly exceed 6,000 prisoners, 100 guns, including heavy and
railway guns, thousands of machine guns, a railway train, and
hundreds of vehicles and teams of regimental transport. Total
casualties for whole Corps will not exceed 1,200."</p>
<p>The vital information, which it is imperative for the Corps
Commander to have accurately and rapidly delivered throughout the
course of a battle, is that relating to the actual position, at any
given moment of time, of our front line troops; showing the
locations which they have reached, and whether they are stationary,
advancing or retiring. For it has to be remembered that the whole
Artillery resources of the Corps were pooled and kept under his own
hand; and it was imperative that any changes in the Artillery
action or employment must be quickly made, so as to extend the
utmost help to any Infantry which might get into difficulties.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, the failure of any body of Infantry to enter
and pass beyond a wood or a village, would be a sure indication
that such locality was still held in strength by the enemy, and it
would be appropriate to "switch" Artillery fire upon it, in order
to drive him out. But such a proceeding would be anything but
prudent if the information on which such action was to be based
were already an hour old.</p>
<p>Transmission of messages from the front line troops to the
nearest telephone terminal is usually slow and uncertain, and the
retransmission of such messages, in succession, by Battalions,
Brigades and Divisions only prolongs the delay. The normal process
is in consequence far too dilatory for the exigencies of actual
battle control.</p>
<p>A vastly superior method had therefore to be devised, and
recourse was had to the use of aeroplanes. The No. 3 Australian
Squadron soon acquired great proficiency in this work. They were
equipped with two-seater planes, carrying both pilot and observer,
and the work was called "Contact Patrol."</p>
<p>The "plane" flying quite low, usually at not more than 500 feet,
the observer would mark down by conventional signs on a map the
actual positions of our Infantry, of enemy Infantry or other facts
of prime importance, and he often had time to scribble a few
informative notes also. The "plane" then flew back at top speed to
Corps H.Q., and the map, with or without an added report, was
dropped in the middle of an adjacent field, wrapped in a weighted
streamer of many colours. It was then brought by cyclists into the
Staff Office.</p>
<p>Relays of Contact planes were on such service all day on every
battle day, and although it was a hazardous duty few planes were
lost. The total time which elapsed between the making of the
observation at the front line and the arrival of the information in
the hands of the Corps Staff was seldom more than ten minutes.</p>
<br>
<p>There can be no doubt that the whole operation was a complete
surprise both to the troops opposed to us and to the German High
Command. It became abundantly clear, in the following days, that no
proper arrangements existed for rapidly reinforcing this part of
the front in the event of an attack by us, but that these had to be
extemporized after the event. This discovery points to the
conclusion that the enemy had once again come to regard the British
Army as a negligible quantity, a mistake for which he paid an even
heavier price than when he made it in the early days of the
war.</p>
<p>As an indication that even the Divisions in the line whose duty
it primarily was to know, had no suspicions of an impending attack,
comes the story of a German medical officer who was captured in his
pyjamas in Warfusee village, and who confessed that being awakened
by our bombardment and thinking it was merely a raid, he left his
dugout to see what was afoot, and thought he must be still dreaming
when he saw our Pioneers a few hundred feet away, busily at work
repairing the main road.</p>
<p>There was only one blemish in the whole day's operations. Not
serious in relation to the whole, it nevertheless gravely hampered
the work of the left Brigade of the Fourth Division. In short, the
Third Corps Infantry failed to reach their ultimate objective line,
and the enemy remained in possession of the Chipilly spur and of
all the advantages which that possession conferred upon him.</p>
<p>The advance of my left flank, from the green to the red line,
along the margin of the plateau bordering the Somme, was left
exposed to his full view, while the river valley itself remained
under the domination of his rifle fire, at quite moderate ranges.
But worse than all, a battery of his Field Artillery emplaced just
above the village of Chipilly remained in action, and one after
another, six of the nine Tanks which had been allotted to the 4th
Brigade were put out of action by direct hits from these guns.</p>
<p>The possibility was one which had been considered and measures
to meet it were promptly taken. Maclagan, whose right Brigade in
due course reached the blue line according to programme, making in
its progress a splendid haul of prisoners and guns, took immediate
steps to "refuse" his left flank, <i>i.e</i>., to bend it back
towards Morcourt, and to establish, with a reserve battalion, a
flank defence along the river, facing north from Cerisy to
Morcourt.</p>
<p>Both these villages were, however, successfully captured, and
"mopped up", which meant that all the enemy and machine guns
lurking in them were accounted for. But the river valley was not
captured, and became, until the situation was ultimately cleared
up, a kind of No Man's Land between the enemy still holding the
Chipilly spur on the north, and the Fourth Division on the south of
the river.</p>
<p>The ultimate conquest of the Chipilly Bend forms no part of that
day's story. What were the reasons for the failure of the Third
Corps to complete its allotted task may have been the subject of
internal inquiry, but the result of any such was not made known.
The official report for the day was to the effect that the enemy on
this front had resisted strongly, that fighting had been fierce,
and that no progress could be made. But one is compelled to
recognize that such language was often an euphemistic method of
describing faulty Staff co-ordination, or faulty local leadership.
There would be no justification, however, for questioning the
bravery of the troops themselves.</p>
<p>It has already been foreshadowed that the experiences on that
day of the contingent of sixteen Armoured Motor-cars under
Lieutenant-Colonel Carter would form sensational reading, and the
story of August 8th would not be complete without at least a brief
reference to their exploits.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when Carter, with a Staff Officer, got
back to Corps H.Q. to render their report. They were scarcely
recognizable, covered as they were from head to feet, with grime
and grease. They had had a busy time. The substance of what they
had to tell was taken down at the time almost verbatim, and reads
as follows:</p>
<p class="indent1">"Got Armoured Cars through to
Warfusee-Abancourt. When we reached the other side of No Man's Land
we found that the road was good but a number of trees (large and
small) had been shot down and lay right across it in places.
Obstacles removed by chopping up the smaller trees and hauling off
the big ones by means of a Tank. Pioneers helped us to clear the
road all the way down. We did not come up to our advancing troops
until they were almost near the Red Line. When we got past our
leading Infantry we came upon quite a number of Huns and dealt with
them. Had then to wait a little on account of our barrage, but went
through a light barrage. When we got to Blue Line we detached three
sections to run down to Framerville. When they got there they found
all the Boche horse transport and many lorries drawn up in the main
road ready to move off. Head of column tried to bolt in one
direction and other vehicles in another. Complete confusion. Our
men killed the lot (using 3,000 rounds) and left them there; four
Staff Officers on horseback shot also. The cars then ran down to
the east side of Harbonni&egrave;res, on the south-east road to
Vauvillers, and met there a number of steam wagons; fired into
their boilers causing an impassable block. Had a lot of good
shooting around Vauvillers. Then came back to main road. Two
sections of cars went on to Foucaucourt and came in contact with a
Boche gun in a wood north-east of Foucaucourt. This gun blew the
wheels off one car and also hit three others. However, three of the
cars were got away. Two other cars went to Proyart and found a lot
of troops billeted there having lunch in the houses. Our cars shot
through the windows into the houses, killing quite a lot of the
enemy. Another section went towards Chuignolles and found it full
of German soldiers. Our cars shot them. Found rest billets and old
trenches also with troops in them. Engaged them. Had quite a battle
there. Extent of damage not known, but considerable. Cars then came
back to main road. We were then well in advance of Blue Line.
Everything was now perfectly quiet&mdash;no shell-fire of any
kind.</p>
<p class="indent1">"I went a quarter of a mile beyond La Flaque.
There was a big dump there, and Huns kept continually coming out
and surrendering, and we brought quite a lot of them back as
prisoners. It was then about 10.30 a.m. A party of Hun prisoners
was detailed to tow back my disabled car. I saw no sign of any
wired system anywhere. Old overgrown trenches but no organized
trench system. I proceeded to some rising ground near Framerville.
Did not go into Framerville, but could see that the roofs of the
houses were intact. Saw no trace of any organized system of defence
of any kind and no troops. My people saw no formed bodies of troops
of any kind during the day coming towards us, but very large
numbers of fugitives hastening in the opposite direction. Engaged
as many of them as could be reached from the roads. I saw, from the
hill, open country with a certain amount of vegetation on it."</p>
<p>The consternation and disorganization caused by the sudden
onslaught of these cars, at places fully ten miles behind the
enemy's front line of that morning, may be left to the imagination.
It was a feat of daring and resolute performance, which deserves to
be remembered.</p>

<br>
<p>Throughout the whole day, surrenders by the enemy, particularly
of troops in rear or reserve positions, were on a wholesale scale.
The total number of live prisoners actually counted up to nightfall
in the Divisional and Corps Prisoner-of-War Cages exceeded 8,000
and the Canadians had gathered in at least as many more.</p>
<p>The Australian Corps also captured 173 guns capable of being
hauled away, not counting those which had been blown to pieces.
These captures included two "railway" guns, one of 9-inch and the
other of 11.2-inch bore. The latter was an imposing affair. The gun
itself rested on two great bogie carriages, each on eight axles; it
was provided with a whole train of railway trucks fitted some to
carry its giant ammunition, others as workshops, and others as
living quarters for the gun detachment. The outfit was completed by
a locomotive to haul the gun forward to its daily task of shelling
Amiens, and hauling it back to its garage when its ugly work was
done.</p>
<p>The captures of machine guns and of trench mortars of all types
and sizes were on so extensive a scale that no attempt was ever
made to make even an approximate count of them. They were
ultimately collected into numerous dumps, and German prisoners were
employed for many weeks in cleaning and oiling them for transport
to Australia as trophies of war.</p>
<p>But the booty comprised a large and varied assortment of many
other kinds of warlike stores. The huge dumps of engineering
material at Rosi&egrave;res and La Flaque served all the needs of
the Corps for the remainder of the war. There were horses, wagons,
lorries and tractors by the hundred, including field search-lights,
mobile pharmacies, motor ambulances, travelling kitchens, mess
carts, limbers, and ammunition wagons and there were literally
hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition scattered
all over the captured territory in dumps both large and small.</p>
<p>For the next two days all roads leading from the battle area
back towards the Army Cage at Poulainville, where railway trains
were waiting to receive them, were congested with column after
column of German prisoners, roughly organized into
companies&mdash;tangible evidences to the civilians of the
district, as to our own troops, that a great victory had been
won.</p>
<p>The tactical value of the victory was immense, and has never yet
been fully appreciated by the public of the Empire, perhaps because
our censorship at the time strove to conceal the intention to
follow it up immediately with further attacks. But no better
testimony is needed than that of Ludendorff himself, who calls it
Germany's "black day", after which he himself gave up all hope of a
German victory.</p>
<p>Ludendorff in his "Memoirs", republished in the <i>Times</i> of
August 22nd, 1919, writes:</p>
<p class="indent1">"August 8th was the black day of the German Army
in the history of the war. This was the worst experience I had to
go through. . . . Early on August 8th, in a dense fog that had been
rendered still thicker by artificial means, the British, mainly
with Australian and Canadian Divisions, and French, attacked
between Albert and Moreuil with strong squadrons of Tanks, but for
the rest with no great superiority. They broke between the Somme
and the Luce deep into our front. The Divisions in line allowed
themselves to be completely overwhelmed. Divisional Staffs were
surprised in their Headquarters by enemy Tanks" [<i>sic</i>, our
armoured cars were meant]. . . . "The exhausted [<i>sic</i>]
Divisions that had been relieved a few days earlier and that were
lying in the region south-west of P&eacute;ronne were immediately
alarmed and set in motion by the Commander-in-Chief of the Second
Army. At the same time he brought forward towards the breach all
available troops. The Rupprecht Army Group dispatched reserves
thither by train. The 18th Army threw its own reserves directly
into the battle from the south-east. . . . On an order from me, the
9th Army too, although itself in danger, had to contribute. Days of
course elapsed before the troops from a further distance could
reach the spot. . . . It was a very gloomy situation. . . . Six or
seven Divisions that were quite fairly to be described as effective
had been completely battered. . . . The situation was uncommonly
serious. If they continued to attack with even comparative vigour,
we should no longer be able to maintain ourselves west of the
Somme. . . . The wastage of the Second Army had been very great.
Heavy toll had also been taken of the reserves which had been
thrown in. . . . Owing to the deficit created our losses had
reached such proportions that the Supreme Command was faced with
the necessity of having to disband a series of Divisions, in order
to furnish drafts. . . . The enemy had also captured documentary
material of inestimable value to him. . . . The General Staff
Officer whom I had dispatched to the battlefield on August 8th,
gave me such an account that I was deeply confounded. . . . August
8th made things clear for both Army Commands, both for the German
and for that of the enemy."</p>
<p>A hole had been driven on a width of nearly twelve miles, right
through the German defence, and had blotted out, at one blow, the
whole of the military resources which it had contained. The
obligation which was thereby cast upon the enemy to throw into the
gap troops and guns hastily collected from every part of his front,
imposed upon him also an increased vulnerability at every other
point which had to be so denuded.</p>
<p>It was no part of our programme to rest content upon our oars,
and allow the enemy time to collect himself at leisure. The
resources of the Australian Corps had suffered scarcely any
impairment as the result of that glorious day. Such small losses as
had been incurred were more than counter-balanced by the elation of
these volunteer troops at this further demonstration of their moral
and physical superiority over the professional soldiers of a
militarist enemy nation.</p>
<p>On that very day all necessary measures were taken to maintain
the battle without pause. But, in order not to interrupt the
continuity of the story of subsequent developments, it will be
convenient to mention, in this place, two events which cannot be
dissociated from the great battle, and which will be memorable to
those who participated in them.</p>
<p>The first was an accidental meeting together of a number of the
most distinguished figures in the war. On August 11th, the
Commander-in-Chief was to come to congratulate the Corps and to
thank the troops through their Commanders. I called the Divisional
Generals together at the Red Ch&acirc;teau at Villers-Bretonneux to
meet him that afternoon. In the meantime General Rawlinson invited
his Corps Commanders to meet him in the same village for a battle
conference, and chose the same hour and a spot in the open, under a
spreading beech, where his Generals sat informally around the maps
spread upon the grass. At this meeting were Rawlinson, Currie,
Kavanagh, Godley, myself, Montgomery and Budworth. The Field
Marshal, with Laurence, the Chief of his General Staff, on their
way to the Red Ch&acirc;teau, soon arrived. Shortly after Sir Henry
Wilson, happening to pass in his car, also joined the party; and
not many moments afterwards there arrived, again entirely without
previous arrangement, Clemenceau and his Finance Minister
Klotz.</p>
<p>Villers-Bretonneux, only three days before reeking with gas and
unapproachable, and now delivered from its bondage, was the
lodestone which had attracted the individual members of this
remarkable assemblage; and the more serious business in hand was
perforce postponed while Rawlinson, Currie and I had to listen to
the generous felicitations of all these great war leaders.</p>
<p>The second event was the visit of His Majesty the King, on
August 12th, to Bertangles, when he conferred on me the honour of
Knighthood, in the presence of selected detachments of five hundred
of the men who had fought in the battle, a hundred from each of my
Five Divisions. A representative collection of guns and other war
trophies had been hauled in from the battlefield to line the
avenues by which the King approached. His Majesty was particularly
interested in the German transport horses, expressing the hope that
they would soon learn the Australian language; a pleasantry which
he well remembered when I had the honour of an audience with him,
on the anniversary of that very day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4>EXPLOITATION</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> Fourth British Army had opened the great
Allied counter-offensive with a brilliant stroke. It remained to
see in what fashion the Allied High Command would proceed to
exploit the victory. Would the Fourth Army be called upon, with
added resources, at once to thrust due east, with the object of
drawing upon itself the German reserves, and dealing with them as
they arrived; or would blows now be delivered on other fronts with
a view to keeping those reserves dispersed?</p>
<p>The immediate decision, communicated to me by the Army Commander
on the afternoon of August 8th, was that, while the whole situation
was being considered, and troop movements were in progress to
enable the necessary concentrations to be made elsewhere, the
Fourth Army would continue its advance forthwith; but that, instead
of driving due east, the thrust was to be made in a south-easterly
direction.</p>
<p>The object was to aim at Roye, and either by the capture of that
important railway centre, or at least by the threat of its capture,
to precipitate a withdrawal by the enemy from the great salient
which he had in his April and May advances pressed into the French
front opposite Moreuil and Montdidier, a salient which could be
kept supplied by that railway alone.</p>
<p>The Australian Corps front on the evening of August 8th lay
roughly on a north and south line, just east of M&eacute;ricourt
and just west of Vauvillers. But the Canadian Corps front bent back
sharply from the latter point in a south-westerly direction. The
Canadians were, therefore, to advance between the railway and the
Amiens-Roye road to the general line Lihons-Le Quesnoy. The
r&ocirc;le of the Australian Corps was to make a defensive flank to
this advance, by pivotting its left on the Somme in the vicinity of
M&eacute;ricourt, but advancing its right along the railway, in the
direction of Lihons.</p>
<p>It was a decision which was unpalatable to me, for it condemned
me to leaving the whole of the great bend of the Somme, on which
lay Bray, P&eacute;ronne and Brie, in the undisturbed possession of
the enemy; and in view of the reports sent in from the front and
confirmed later by the Armoured Cars, it appeared to me that the
resumption of a vigorous advance due east next day would give us,
without fighting, possession, or at least command, of the whole of
this bend; while if we allowed the enemy to take breath and recover
from his shock, he would probably have time to rally the fugitives,
and turn again to face us.</p>
<p>This same great bend of the river had been the scene of two
years of sedentary warfare, in 1915 and 1916, when the French and
German artillery had converted it into a barren wilderness. It was,
in its eastern part, scored with trenches, and bristled with wire
entanglements in every direction; it was devoid of villages, woods,
or any kind of shelter&mdash;a forbidding expanse of
devastation.</p>
<p>But between our front lines of that day and the western edge of
this wilderness, there still lay a belt of some six or seven miles
of practically unharmed country over which the retreat of our Fifth
Army in March had carried them without much fighting. I should have
welcomed an order to push on the next morning, in open warfare
formation, to gain possession of the whole of this belt, and force
the enemy to make any attempt to reorganize his line on the
inhospitable ground which lay beyond.</p>
<p>The order stood, however; and instructions were issued for the
First Australian Division to be drawn into the fight, and to take
upon themselves the task of conforming to the advance of the
Canadians along the railway. The first phase of this advance was to
have been carried out at 11 a.m. on August 9th by the First
Division passing through the right Brigade of the Fifth
Division.</p>
<p>The 1st Brigade of the First Australian Division had, as already
related, arrived from the North in time to participate in the
fighting of the day before; but the remaining two Brigades arrived
so late, and had to perform so long a march from their detraining
station near Amiens to our now greatly advanced battle front, that
it soon became evident that they could not arrive at the line of
departure in time to synchronize with the Canadian advance.</p>
<p>In consequence, the Fifth Division was instructed to detail its
right line Brigade to begin this duty; and in due course the 15th
Brigade carried out the first part of the task and advanced our
line to include the capture of Vauvillers, an operation which was
successfully completed by midday.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the Second and Third Divisions had
been given a task for the previous day which was limited in time,
though not in difficulty, and that this task had been completed, as
it proved with very little stress, by 7 a.m. These Divisions had
thus had a whole day in which to rest and reorganize. The Second
Division was therefore placed under orders to participate in the
advance of August 9th.</p>
<p>In due course, the First Division arrived at our fighting front,
and that afternoon both the First and Second Divisions advanced in
battle order, the former passing through the right Brigade of the
Fifth Division, and the latter through its left Brigade. This
operation carried our front line in this part of the field to the
foot of the Lihons hill, and gave us complete possession of the
village of Framerville. It also incidentally released the Fifth
Division from further line duty.</p>
<p>The opposition met with during this day's operations varied
considerably along the battle front, which extended in this part of
the field over about 6,000 yards. The Lihons ridge was found to be
strongly held, and much fire both from field guns and machine guns
was encountered. It was evident that, overnight, the enemy had
succeeded in organizing sufficient troops for the local defence of
this important point.</p>
<p>Upon the front of the Second Division, however, there was little
opposition and the enemy gave up Framerville almost without a
struggle. Three Battalions of Tanks co-operated in the day's
fighting, but several of them were disabled by direct fire from
Lihons. The task assigned to the Corps for that day was, none the
less, carried out in its entirety, and by nightfall contact had
been made with the Second Canadian Division on the railway about a
mile east of Rosi&egrave;res.</p>
<p>The situation on the left flank of the Australian Corps was,
however, anything but satisfactory. The Chipilly spur was still in
the hands of the enemy, all the efforts over-night on the part of
the 58th Division (Third Corps) to dislodge them having failed.
General Butler, the Corps Commander, in pursuance of arrangements
come to some days before, was to proceed on sick leave, as he had
for some time been far from well; and General Godley (my former
chief of the 22nd Corps) was temporarily to take his place. I
therefore persuaded the Army Commander to avail himself of this
change to allow me to take in hand the situation at Chipilly, and
to give me, for this purpose, a limited jurisdiction over the north
bank of the Somme. This was merely getting in the thin edge of the
wedge; and not many hours later, I found myself where I had so
strongly desired to be from the first, namely, astride of the Somme
valley.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the 13th Australian Brigade, after a day's rest
from the anxious duty of acting as a screen for the Canadians on
the eve of the main battle, were told off to deal with the Chipilly
spur. Before, however, they could reach the locality, and in the
late afternoon of August 9th, the 131st American Regiment (of
Bell's Division), which was still under the orders of the Third
Corps, very gallantly advanced in broad daylight and took
possession practically of the whole spur.</p>
<p>In the meantime the 13th Brigade arrived, sending a Battalion
across the Somme at Cerisy, and, joining the Americans, helped to
clear up the whole situation. This made my left flank more secure,
and enabled Maclagan to withdraw the defensive flank which he had
deployed along the river from Cerisy to Morcourt. That night I took
over the 131st American Regiment from the Third Corps, attached it,
as a temporary measure, to the Fourth Division, and placed Maclagan
in charge of the newly captured front, which extended north of the
river as far as the Corbie&mdash;Bray road.</p>
<p>The day ended with Divisions in the line from south to north in
the following order, viz.:&mdash;First, Second and Fourth, the last
named having been augmented by an American Regiment, having had its
own 13th Brigade restored to it, and having in exchange yielded up
to the First Division the 1st Brigade of the latter.</p>
<p>The Fourth Division had had comparatively much the worst of it,
up to this stage, of any of my Divisions, and I felt that they were
due for a short rest. Accordingly, I issued orders that same night
for the Third Division, which, like the Second, had been resting
since the previous forenoon, to relieve the Fourth Division on that
part of the front which lay between the Somme and the main St.
Quentin road on the following day, but for the time being leaving
the newly captured ground north of the Somme still in Maclagan's
hands.</p>
<p>After an examination of the ground and a study of the situation,
the opportunity for a further immediate local operation, certain to
gain valuable tactical ground, and likely also to yield a good
number of prisoners, presented itself to me. A further attraction
was that it would permit of a useful advance of my left flank on
the south of the Somme. This project, being of some tactical
interest, demands a short explanatory reference to the terrain.</p>
<p>The river Somme, from Cerisy as far east as P&eacute;ronne,
flows in a tortuous valley which describes a succession of bends,
almost uniform in size and regular in disposition. These bends face
with their bases alternately north and south, and average a depth
of two miles, by a width across the base of about a mile and a
half. Each came to be known to us by the name of one of the
villages which reposed in its folds, such as Chipilly, Etinehem,
Bray, Cappy, Feuill&egrave;res, and Ommi&eacute;court; all these
have become names to be remembered in the subsequent conquest of
this part of the Somme valley.</p>
<p>The valley itself is in this region a mile broad; its sides are
steep and often precipitous, and the adjoining plateaus rise some
200 feet above its bed. Through this valley winds, in ordered
curves, the canal for barge traffic; it is flanked by vast
stretches of backwaters and heavily grassed morasses, in which the
river loses itself. The valley can be traversed only by the few
bridges and the lock gates of the canal, and the causeways leading
to them from either bank.</p>
<p>It would be difficult country for a fight on a general scale,
but ideal for guerilla warfare. The whole succession of villages
clinging to the sides of the valley were in the hands of the enemy,
and in use by him for the housing and shelter of his troops. To
attack and overcome them one by one, by fighting up the winding
valley, would have been a costly business. But it suggested itself
that they might all be won by a species of investment.</p>
<p>Taking any one of these U-shaped bends singly, by drawing a
cordon across its base, the whole of any enemy forces who might be
occupying the bend would be denied escape from it, except by
<em>crossing</em> the river into the adjacent bend. But if a
semi-cordon had been simultaneously drawn across the base of that
next bend also, even that loophole would be closed, and moreover
such troops as inhabited the second bend would find themselves
surrounded also.</p>
<p>Immediately before my left flank lay the M&eacute;ricourt bend
on the south of the river and the Etinehem bend to the north of it.
Both were held by the enemy, doubtless fugitives from the great
battle, who had sought food, water and underground shelter in the
numerous dugouts which honeycombed the sides of the valley. The
design was to capture the whole of these with little effort. It was
a good plan, and only an unforeseen accident prevented its full
realization.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 10th, I summoned a conference at
Maclagan's Headquarters in Corbie, which was attended by the
Commanders and certain Brigadiers of the Third and Fourth
Divisions. It was arranged that on the north of the river, the 13th
Brigade would that night get astride of the Etinehem spur on the
north, while simultaneously the 10th Brigade, by making a side
sweep skirting Proyart, would advance our line till its left rested
on the river a mile east of M&eacute;ricourt.</p>
<p>Columns were to move along defined routes, leaving the
objectives well to the flanks, and then to encircle the enemy
positions. Each column was to be accompanied by Tanks and was to
move in an easterly direction and then wheel in towards the Somme.
Although Tanks had never previously been used at night, as their
utility was uncertain, it was thought that the effect of the noise
they made would lead to the speedy collapse of the defence.</p>
<p>The plan succeeded to perfection on the north of the river, and
the Etinehem spur and village with all its defenders fell to us
almost without a blow. Four Tanks amused themselves by racing up
and down the main Corbie&mdash;Bray road at top speed, and the
clamour they made cleared the path for the marching infantry.</p>
<p>On the south, however, just after nightfall, a sudden onslaught
by a flight of enemy bombing planes, threw the head of the 10th
Brigade column into confusion, and its Commander was killed. Two of
the Tanks were also disabled by direct hits from Artillery. This
delayed the progress of the operation, and the next day broke with
the task uncompleted. The 9th and 11th Brigades were, however, at
once sent up to reinforce, and during the following day all three
Brigades completed the operation by possessing themselves of the
villages of M&eacute;ricourt and Proyart and the woods adjoining
the river.</p>
<p>This series of local operations yielded some 300 prisoners, and
entirely cleared up the confused and unsatisfactory situation which
had existed on my left flank, as the aftermath of the Chipilly spur
failure of the first day. It also brought my line up more square to
the Somme, and so somewhat shortened my already expanding front.
But my left flank was at last quite secure.</p>
<p>I must now turn to the extreme right flank, which was, on this
same day, also the scene of very severe fighting. I have related
the progress of the First Division to the foot of the Lihons ridge
the night before. On August 10th and 11th the advance was continued
by the First and Second Divisions in sympathy with the advance of
the Canadian Corps on the south of the railway. There were only a
few Tanks left available to assist in this advance; and the
resistance of the enemy in the neighbourhood of Lihons had
stiffened considerably.</p>
<p>The devastated area had already been reached by us in this part
of the field, and the terrain was a labyrinth of old trenches, and
a sea of shell-holes; the remains of old wire entanglements spread
in every direction, and the whole area had been covered by a rank
growth of thistles and brambles. It furnished numerous harbours for
machine-guns, and it was country over which it was difficult to
preserve the semblance of an organized battle formation during an
advance.</p>
<p>The enemy fought hard and determinedly to retain Lihons, and in
some parts of the line the battle swayed to and fro. But before the
morning was well advanced, we had taken possession of the whole of
the Lihons Knoll, of Auger Wood, and of the villages of Lihons and
Rainecourt, while the Canadians had passed through Chilly just
south of the railway. All that afternoon the enemy made repeated
counter-attacks, particularly directed against Lihons and
Rainecourt; but they were all successfully driven off by rifle and
machine-gun fire without the loss of any ground.</p>
<p>It was a great feat to the credit of the First Australian
Division, and ranks among its best performances during the war.
Some 20 field-guns and hundreds of machine-guns were captured. Such
a battle, with such results, would, in 1917, have been placarded as
a victory of the first magnitude. Now, with the new standards set
up by the great battle of August 8th, it was reckoned merely as a
local skirmish.</p>
<br>
<p>General Currie, operating on my right, had had a similar
experience of slow, although definite, progress, against hourly
stiffening opposition, and the fighting by the methods of open
warfare was growing daily more costly. The enemy had recovered from
his first surprise, our resources in Tanks had been greatly
diminished, and much of our heavy Artillery had not yet had time to
get into its forward positions. In other words, the possibility of
further cheap exploitation of the success of August 8th had come to
an end.</p>
<p>It was decided, therefore, to recommend to the Army Commander
that a temporary halt should be called on the line thus reached,
and that rested troops should be brought up to relieve the line
Divisions. He concurred and decided that we should prepare for the
delivery on August 15th of another combined "set-piece" blow, which
would have the probable effect of again putting the enemy on the
run, so that the moving battle could be resumed.</p>
<p>This plan was never actually carried into effect, for reasons
which did not at once appear. But it transpired later that General
Currie had made very strong private representations to the Fourth
Army against the plan. He questioned the wisdom of expending the
resources of the Canadian Corps upon an attempt to repeat, over
such broken country, covered as it was with entanglements and other
obstacles, the great success of August 8th. He urged that the
Canadian Corps should be transferred back to the Arras
district&mdash;which they knew so well. It was country lending
itself admirably to operations requiring careful organization,
which none understood better than Currie and his admirable
Staff.</p>
<p>It was an issue in which I was not greatly concerned, for my
share in the proposed operation of August 15th was to be quite
subsidiary. It was to consist merely in once again advancing my
right flank, in sympathy with the Canadian advance, as far as to
include Chaulnes Hill and the very important railway junction at
that town. In ignorance of the fact that the matter was under
discussion, I prepared complete plans for the co-operation of the
Australian Corps, and detailed the Fourth and Fifth Australian
Divisions to carry them out. Fortunately, before any actual
executive action had been initiated, orders came that the project
was to be abandoned.</p>
<p>It soon became known that still larger questions were being
discussed. The British front, which in July reached south as far
only as Villers-Bretonneux, had now been extended to the latitude
of Roye. The Field Marshal was urging reduction, so as to liberate
Divisions for offensive operations elsewhere, and Marshal Foch
agreed that, as by the elimination of the Soissons salient the
French front had been shortened, this could be done. In due course
confidential announcements were made that, as soon as it could be
arranged, the Canadians would be withdrawn from the line, and their
places taken by French troops. This would once again make my Corps
the south flank Corps of the British Army, and I would junction
with the French on the Lihons Hill.</p>
<p>The halt thus called gave me breathing time to consider a
thorough re-organization of my whole Corps front. This had, by
August 12th, again grown to a total length of over 16,000 yards.
This increase had been the result, firstly, of my having, as
narrated, taken over ground to the north of the Somme, secondly, by
reason of the fact that during the advances of the last four days
my right had hugged the railway, while my left had continued to
rest on the Somme, two lines which were rapidly diverging from each
other, and thirdly, because my front line now lay sharply oblique
to my general line of advance.</p>
<p>Even with a fifth Division, which I now had at my disposal, a
front of 16,000 yards was far too attenuated for Corps operations
on the grand scale, and even for more localized operations, by one
or two Divisions at a time, there was little opportunity to provide
the troops with adequate intervals of rest. I therefore strongly
urged upon General Rawlinson either a shortening of my front, or a
further increase in my resources.</p>
<p>He chose the latter alternative, and on August 12th placed under
my orders, provisionally, the 17th British Division (Major-General
P.R. Robertson), coupled with the condition that while it might be
employed as a line Division, it was not to be used for offensive
operations. The reason, confidentially given, was that it was
shortly to be employed in a large scale offensive in course of
preparation by the Third British Army.</p>
<p>It was, for me, a most opportune measure of relief from a
difficult situation; for the Third Australian Division was now also
badly in need of a rest. Prior to the great advance, it had been
longest of any of the Divisions in the line, and had subsequently
had a hard time in fighting its way forward from M&eacute;ricourt
to Proyart. It was therefore relieved in the line on August 13th by
the 17th Division and went into Corps Reserve.</p>
<p>On the same day I put into effect a project of organization
which the necessities of the case forced upon me. North of the
river stood the 13th Australian Brigade, and the 131st American
Regiment, both still under the command of General Maclagan, the
remainder of whose Division was resting, and this Division might be
required at short notice for operations at a totally different part
of the front. (I had, in fact, earmarked it for the proposed attack
on August 15th to which I have referred.)</p>
<p>To overcome this anomalous position, I decided to constitute,
for a brief period, an independent force, composed of the two units
north of the river which I have named, to appoint to the command of
it Brigadier-General Wisdom (of the 7th Brigade), and to supply him
with a nucleus Staff, some Artillery, and supply and signal
services. It became, in fact, to all intents and purposes, an
additional Division with a Headquarters directly responsible to
me.</p>
<p>This force received the name of "Liaison Force" and continued in
existence for about eight days. Its functions were to keep tactical
touch and liaison with the Third Corps, to protect my left flank by
guarding the Etinehem spur from recapture, and to act as a kind of
loose link between the two Corps, advancing its northern or its
southern flanks, or both, in sympathy with any forward movement to
be made by either Corps. While, during its existence as a separate
force, no operations of first magnitude took place, yet the Liaison
Force served me well in the very useful function of a custodian of
my tactical ownership of the Somme valley, an ownership which I
succeeded in retaining to the immense advantage of the operations
of the Corps less than three weeks later.</p>
<p>By August 13th, therefore, my responsibilities included the
control of seven separate Divisions as well as all the Corps
Troops, and Army Troops attached. The next week was occupied in
local operations by the front line Divisions to straighten our
front, and to dispose of a number of strong points, small woods,
and village ruins which, so long as they were in enemy hands, were
a source of annoyance to us. The attitude of the enemy was alert
but not aggressive, and an important point was that he showed every
desire to stand his ground, and to contest our further advance.
There was as yet no indication of any comprehensive withdrawal out
of the great river bend. Each day brought its useful toll of
prisoners, all of whom, however, corroborated the view that the
enemy meant to hold on, and that the troops opposing us were more
than a mere rearguard intended to delay our advance.</p>
<p>The period from August 13th to 20th was also occupied in
carrying out a number of inter-divisional reliefs&mdash;events of
merely technical interest to the student of military history, but
imposing an immense amount of detailed work upon the Staff of the
Corps and upon the Commanders and Staffs of the Divisions
concerned. It was my own special responsibility, and one which I
could not delegate, to decide the date of the relief of each
Division and by which other Division it should be relieved. Such
decisions involved a close inquiry into, and a just and humane
appreciation of the condition of the troops, almost from hour to
hour every day, a duty in the discharge of which I was able to rely
upon the loyal help of the Divisional Commanders and
Brigadiers.</p>
<p>The time that had elapsed since last they had rested, the
marching they had since done, the fighting they had undertaken and
its nature, the mental and physical stress which they had
undergone, and the probable nature and date of their future
employment were all factors which had to be weighed carefully, and
set against the advantages or disadvantages of cutting short the
period of rest of the troops who were available to relieve them. It
was a function which had to be exercised, at all times, with the
greatest circumspection, and the strictest justice; for troops are
very ready to acquire the impression that they are being called
upon to do more than their fair share.</p>

[<i>click map to view larger image</i>]</small></p>
<br>
<p>An actual inter-divisional relief usually occupied two nights
and the intervening day. Incoming units, both fighting and
technical, had to be shown all over the sector, to be taught the
dispositions and the exact situation in front of us; maps, orders
and photographs had to be explained and handed over; stores and
dumps had to be inventoried and receipts passed; while on the other
hand the outgoing troops expected to find their billets, offices,
stables, wagon lines, bathing-places and entertainment rooms in the
rear area all allocated and ready for their occupation.</p>
<p>Each such mutual relief meant the movement of upwards of 20,000
men, and separate roads had to be allotted for their use.
Frequently in so large a Corps as this, two such inter-divisional
reliefs would synchronize or overlap, and the danger of congestion
and the Staff work necessary to avoid it would be thereby more than
doubled. And all this work would have to go on smoothly even if the
Corps front were in the throes of an actual battle at the time.</p>
<p>Although much of the routine of such reliefs, which had become
almost a ritual during the preceding years of trench warfare, was
now scrapped, it is a matter of pride to the Australian Corps and
its Divisions, that all such relief operations, even amid all the
stress of these busy fighting months of August and September, were,
until the end, carried out with precision, freedom from irritating
hitches, and a minimum of stress on the troops.</p>
<p>The decisions which had to be given regarding the times and
alternations of these Divisional reliefs became from now on really
of basic importance, and affected the main framework of the whole
of my future plans. It was no longer merely a question of
earmarking certain Divisions for a specified single operation; but
of planning, many days ahead, the rotation in which the Divisions
were to be employed in a continuous series of operations. I
regarded it as a fundamental principle to employ whenever possible
absolutely fresh and rested troops for an operation of any
magnitude or importance. To carry such a principle into effect
involved the necessity of making the best surmise that was possible
as to the course of events a week or even two weeks ahead.</p>
<p>As I shall endeavour to make clear in the course of the
following pages, the really outstanding and exceptional features of
the work of the Corps in its last sixty days were the sustained
vigour of its fighting, and the unbroken continuity of its
collective effort. Those results would clearly depend more on the
manner in which the resources in troops were manipulated than upon
any other factor. Each Division had to be kept employed until the
last ounce of effort, consistent with speedy recovery, had been
yielded, and each Division had to rest a sufficient time to enable
it fully to recover its spirit and tone, and yet had to be ready by
the time it was wanted.</p>
<p>The fulfilment of such conditions involved, as a little
reflection will show, a great deal more than a mere mechanical
rotation of employment; for the problem was, always to have
available an adequate supply of sufficiently rested troops for a
prospective demand which, although varying always in accordance
with the changing situation, had nevertheless to be predicted or
conjectured.</p>
<p>August 21st found our front line much about the same as that of
August 13th, although generally more advanced and straightened out.
The Corps frontage was still over 16,000 yards, and upon the
completion of the series of reliefs to which I have alluded the
dispositions of the Corps were as follows: The Fourth Australian
Division from Lihons to just south of Herleville, the 32nd British
Division opposite Herleville, the Fifth Australian Division in
front of Proyart, and the Third Australian Division on the north of
the river. The First and Second Divisions were in Corps Reserve,
the former having by then had a good rest from its Lihons fighting.
The Liaison Force had been broken up; and the 32nd British Division
(Major-General T.S. Lambert) had joined my command in substitution
for the 17th Division, which had been withdrawn to join the Thin
Army.</p>
<p>Such was the situation of the Australian Corps, when on August
21st the short period of comparative inactivity came to a close,
and it was destined soon to go forward to further decisive events.
On the previous day the French opened a great attack in the south,
which yielded 10,000 prisoners on the first day, and on the day in
question the Third British Army delivered north of Albert the
attack which had been expected for some days. Thus the enemy would
have his hands full in endeavouring to parry those fresh blows; and
the time seemed appropriate for another stroke on the front of the
Fourth Army.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h4>CHUIGNES</h4>
<p>A<small>LLUSION</small> has been made to the great bend which
occurs in the course of the River Somme. It is indeed a
geographical circumstance which must be borne in mind, if the
phraseology current at this epoch in the war is to be clearly
comprehended.</p>
<p>The river flows in an almost due northerly direction from the
neighbourhood of Roye as far as P&eacute;ronne, and then bends
quite sharply, at that locality, in a western direction, past Bray,
Corbie and Amiens, towards the sea, beyond Abbeville. In the story
of the fighting of the period from March to August we have been
concerned only with that portion of the river valley which ran
parallel to our line of advance; but interest will henceforth focus
itself largely upon that other reach of the Somme which runs on a
north and south line, upstream, from the town of
P&eacute;ronne.</p>
<p>This latter stretch of the river lies squarely athwart the
direction in which the Corps had been advancing, and the obstacle
to that advance which the river would presently constitute was
continued in a northerly direction from P&eacute;ronne by an
unfinished work of a great canalization scheme to be called the
"Canal du Nord". This canal was already wide and deep, and formed a
tactical obstacle of some significance, for the excavations
incidental to this project had been almost completed before the
war.</p>
<p>The "line of the Somme", as it was understood in the tactical
discussions of the period now to be dealt with, meant, in short,
the line formed by that part of the river which lay upstream
(<i>i.e</i>., to the south of P&eacute;ronne), and the continuation
northwards of that line by the Canal du Nord. Both features being
military obstacles, they and the highlands to the east of them
together afforded an eminently suitable continuous line on which
the enemy might, if he were permitted to do so, establish himself
in a defensive attitude in order to bar our eastward progress.</p>
<p>The autumn was upon us; not more than another eight or nine
weeks of campaigning weather could be relied upon. A quite definite
possibility existed that the enemy might be able to put forth so
powerful an effort to contest our further advance, inch by inch,
that he would gain sufficient time to prepare the line of the Somme
for a stout defence, and hold us up until the arrival of winter
compelled a suspension of large operations.</p>
<p>There were at that time, indeed, some who contended that as we
had apparently succeeded in putting an end to the German offensive
we should rest content with the year's work; that our soundest
strategy would be to permit the enemy to take up such a line of
defence; and then quietly to wait over the winter until 1919 for
the full development of the American effort, now only in its
inception.</p>
<p>So far, the enemy had given no indication of any readiness to
undertake a precipitate withdrawal from the great bend west of the
Somme. On the contrary, his resistance had stiffened to such an
extent that little further progress was to be hoped for from the
methods of open warfare which I had employed since August 8th.</p>
<p>If, however, another powerful blow could be delivered, to be
followed by energetic exploitation, it was quite possible that the
enemy might be hustled across the Somme, that this might be
achieved at such a rate that I could gain a firm footing on the
east bank, and that thereby the value to him of the line of the
Somme, as a winter defence, might be destroyed.</p>
<p>This was the very project on which I now embarked. The First
Division was in Corps Reserve, had rested and was fresh. The 32nd
Division had only just come into the line. By handing over a
substantial sector to the French, my frontage south of the Somme
was about to be shortened to 7,000 yards, a very suitable front for
a deliberate attack by two Divisions.</p>
<p>I held a conference at Fouilloy, near Corbie, in the afternoon
of August 21st to announce the plan, and to settle all details with
the Commanders and services concerned. The Infantry assault was to
be entrusted to Glasgow and Lambert, attacking side by side; but
the former had allotted to him much the larger share of the battle
front, at the northern end, the corollary r&ocirc;le of the 32nd
Division being to seize Herleville and carry our line just to the
east of it.</p>
<p>The date of the attack was fixed for August 23rd, and the Second
and Fifth Divisions were warned to be in readiness to come into the
line a day or two after the battle, in order to commence
immediately the process of keeping the enemy on the run, and
hustling him clean out of the river bend and across the line of the
Somme.</p>
<p>The conference of that day was of special interest, in that I
had to deal with two Divisions which had not participated in any of
those Corps Conferences, previously held, which had initiated a
fully organized Corps operation. The Commanders and Staffs were
strangers to each other and, some of them, to me and my Staff.
Nearly all of them were yet unfamiliar with the special methods of
the Corps. The conference was therefore a lengthy one, for many
problems of tactical mechanism, which had been settled in
connection with the preceding battles of Hamel and August 8th, had
to be reopened and elucidated.</p>
<p>These regular battle conferences were in the Australian Corps an
innovation from the time the command of it devolved upon me. They
proved a powerful instrument for the moulding of a uniformity of
tactical thought and method throughout the command. They brought
together men who met face to face but seldom, and they permitted of
an exhaustive and educative interchange of views. They led to a
development of "team-work" of a very high order of efficiency.</p>
<p>The work of preparing for, and the actual conduct of, these
conferences was always a very arduous business; but they more than
repaid me for the effort they entailed. They served two paramount
purposes. They enabled me to apply the requisite driving force to
all subordinates collectively, instead of individually, and thereby
created a responsive spirit which was competitive. In addition,
each Commander or Service had the advantage not only of receiving
instructions regarding his own action, but also of hearing in full
detail the instructions conveyed to his colleagues. He knew, not
merely what his colleagues had to do, but also knew that they had
been told what to do; and he had an opportunity of considering the
effect of their action on his own.</p>
<p>The senior representative of the Heavy Artillery, Tank and Air
Services invariably attended, and listened to all the points
discussed with the Divisions, and the Divisional Commanders heard
all matters arranged with these services. In this way, each arm
acquired in the most direct manner a steadily expanding knowledge
of the technology of all the other arms.</p>
<p>My reason for emphasizing these matters in the present context
is that, on this particular occasion, an attempt was to be made to
carry out a major Corps operation at little more than thirty-six
hours' notice; and the Division which was to have assigned to it
the principal r&ocirc;le was still in Corps Reserve and a day's
march from the battle front.</p>
<p>That, in spite of these handicaps, the battle proved brilliantly
successful is a testimony to the valuable part which these Corps
conferences played in securing rapid and efficiently co-ordinated
action; a result which would, I am confident, have been
unattainable under the stated conditions by the mere issue of
formal written orders.</p>
<p>Although only two out of the seven Divisions of the Corps were
to participate in this operation, it was my intention to employ,
for the full assistance of the Infantry, the whole resources of the
Corps in Artillery, Tanks and Aircraft. That was a principle which
I always regarded as fundamental, and one from which I never
permitted any exception to be made, although the pressure upon me
to rest a substantial portion of these ancillary services was
always very great.</p>
<p>The general plan for the battle ran briefly as follows. The 32nd
Division would attack with one Infantry Brigade, under a barrage,
on a frontage of 1,000 yards; the capture of the village of
Herleville, which was still strongly held, being its principal
objective.</p>
<p>The 1st Australian Division would attack on a frontage of 4,500
yards, with two Brigades in line, and one Brigade in reserve. The
attack would be carried out in three phases.</p>
<p>The first phase was a normal assault, under an Artillery
barrage, and with the assistance of Tanks, to a predetermined line,
which would carry us beyond the Chuignes Valley; the second phase
was in the nature of exploitation by the two line Brigades, but was
expressly limited to a maximum distance of 1,000 yards beyond the
main first objective.</p>
<p>The third phase was to be contingent upon the complete success
of the preceding phases, and would consist of an advance by the
Reserve Brigade for a further exploitation of success, by the
seizure of the whole of the Cappy bend of the river, including the
towering hill close to the Somme Canal known as Froissy Beacon.</p>
<p>All arrangements for the forthcoming battle having thus been
completed, the First Division duly relieved the Fifth Division on
the night of August 21st, and hastened forward its preparations for
the attack, which had been fixed for 4.45 a.m. on August 23rd.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the first attack which any British Army other
than the Fourth had made since August 8th was at last launched on
August 21st along the whole front of the Third British Army,
northwards from Albert.</p>
<p>It has come to be an article of faith that the whole of the
successive stages of the great closing offensive of the war had
been the subject of most careful timing, and of minute organization
on the part of the Allied High Command, and of our own G.H.Q. Much
eulogistic writing has been devoted to an attempted analysis of the
comprehensive and far-reaching plans which resulted in the delivery
of blow upon blow, in a prescribed order of time and for the
achievement of definite strategical or tactical ends.</p>

<br>
<p>All who played any part in these great events well know that it
was nothing of the kind; that nothing in the nature of a detailed
time-table to control so vast a field of effort was possible. All
Commanders, and the most exalted of them in a higher degree even
than those wielding lesser forces, became opportunists, and bent
their energies, not to the realization of a great general plan for
a succession of timed attacks, but upon the problem of hitting
whenever and wherever an opportunity offered, and the means were
ready to hand.</p>
<p>In these matters it was the force of circumstances which
controlled the sequence of events, and nothing else. An elaborate
time-table controlled by definite dates and sequences for the
successive engagement of a series of Armies would have been quite
impossible of realization. Even a Corps Commander had difficulty in
forecasting within a day or two when he would be ready to launch an
attack on any given part of the front. For an Army Commander it was
a matter of a week or even two.</p>
<p>All attempted time-tables were controlled by our Artillery
requirements; both the assembling of the necessary guns&mdash;often
drawn from distant fronts&mdash;and the accumulating of the
requisite "head" of ammunition to see a battle through, were
processes whose duration could only be very roughly forecasted.</p>
<p>The dumping, in the gun pits and in ammunition stores, of the
necessary 500 or 600 rounds per gun meant days of labour in
collection and distribution on the part of the railways and motor
lorries. The breakdown of a few motor lorries at a critical time,
or the dropping of a single bomb upon an important railway
junction, were disturbing factors quite sufficient to have arrested
the flow of ammunition, and to have postponed, indefinitely, any
programme based upon its prompt delivery.</p>
<p>It will be obvious, therefore, that no reliance could be placed,
days or weeks beforehand, upon a given attack taking place on a
given day; therefore no plans could be made which depended upon
such attacks taking place in a predetermined sequence.</p>
<p>Shortly put, therefore, the decisions of the High Command were
confined to questions such as where an attack should be made, in
what direction, and by what forces. The date was always a matter of
uncertainty, and the only control that could be exercised was by
postponement, and never by acceleration.</p>
<p>For the greater part of the offensive period it was therefore
necessarily left to the Commanders of the Armies to conform to a
general policy of attack, the time and method being left to their
own decision or recommendation. And they, in turn, relied upon
their Corps Commanders to seize the initiative in the pursuit of
such a policy. Naturally, the Army at all times made every effort
to secure co-ordinated action by its several Corps; but it rarely
happened that more than one Corps at a time carried through the
main effort&mdash;the other Corps performing subsidiary
r&ocirc;les. The great battle of September 29th to October 1st,
which completed the final rupture of the Hindenburg line, was,
however, a signal exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The attack by the Third British Army on August 21st is a case
which illustrates the delays inseparable from battle preparations.
The project of such an attack had already been mooted on August
11th, when General Byng (Third Army) paid me a visit to discuss my
battle plan of August 8th, and I gathered on that occasion that he
hoped to begin within four or five days. The event showed that the
operation actually took ten days to materialize. No criticism is
suggested. The conditions of transport of troops and munitions
doubtless made its earlier realization quite impossible.</p>
<p>The attack coming when it did, however, considerably eased the
situation of the Fourth Army, upon whose front Ludendorff had flung
all his available reserves, drawn from all parts of the German
front, in his endeavours to bring the Australians and Canadians to
a halt.</p>
<p>He was now suddenly confronted with the prospect of another
"break through" in a different part of his line, and the German
people had been taught by their press correspondents to believe
that a "break through" was the one thing most to be resisted by the
German Supreme Command, and the one thing impossible of achievement
by us.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt, therefore, that the success of the Third
Army on August 21st, although not comparable in its results with
the battle of August 8th, did materially assist the prospects of my
own success in the operations upon which I was then embarking.</p>
<p>The immediate effect of it was already felt the very next day.
For the Third Corps, which was still the left flank Corps of the
Fourth Army, and which had made very little progress since August
8th, was enabled to advance its line a little past Albert and
Meaulte.</p>
<p>The Third Australian Division, which, it will be remembered, had
taken over the front and the r&ocirc;le of the now disbanded
Liaison Force, participated, by arrangement, in this attack and,
swinging up its left, brought my front line, north of the river,
square to the Somme Valley, and just to the forward slopes of the
high plateau overlooking Bray and La Neuville. The Third Pioneer
Battalion at once got to work on restoring the broken crossings
over the Somme, to the south of Bray, and put out a series of
advanced posts upon the left bank of the river, which gave us
practical control of the great island on which stands La
Neuville.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the left flank of the 9th Brigade, which had
carried out the Third Divisional attack, there was serious trouble.
The enemy counter-attacked in the late afternoon. The 9th Brigade
stood firm; but the 47th Division (of the Third Corps) yielded
ground, leaving the flank of the 9th Brigade in the air. A chalk
pit, which we had seized, formed a welcome redoubt which enabled
the 33rd Battalion to hang on for sufficiently long to permit of
the 34th Battalion coming up to form a defensive flank, facing
north.</p>
<p>In this way the gallant 9th Brigade (Goddard) was able to retain
the whole of its gains of that day; but the risk of an immediate
further advance was too great while the situation to the north
remained obscure and unsatisfactory. The capture of the village of
Bray, which was still strongly held by the enemy, had, therefore,
to be postponed, although it had been part of my plan to capture it
that same day as a measure of precaution, seeing that I calculated
upon being able the next day to advance my line south of the Somme
to a point well to the east of Bray.</p>
<p>The great attack by the First Division supported by the 32nd
Division, which has come to be known as the battle of Chuignes, was
launched at dawn on August 23rd, and was an unqualified
success.</p>
<p>The main valley of the Somme in this region is flanked by a
number of tributary valleys, which run generally in a north and
south direction, extending back from the river four or five miles.
They are broad, with heavily-wooded sides, and harbour a number of
villages, such as Proyart, Chuignolles, Herleville and Chuignes,
which cluster on their slopes.</p>
<p>One such valley, larger and longer than any of those which, in
our previous advances, we had yet crossed, lay before our front
line of that morning, and square across our path. It ran from
Herleville, northwards, past Chuignes, to join the Somme in the
Bray bend. It was the most easterly of all the tributary valleys to
which I have referred, and it was also the last piece of habitable
country before the devastated area of 1916 was reached, just a mile
to the east of it.</p>
<p>The valley afforded excellent cover for the enemy's guns, and
the expectation was that some of them would be overrun by our
attack. It was also ideal country for machine-gun defence, for the
numerous woods, hedges and copses afforded excellent cover, and had
in all probability been amply fortified with barbed wire. It was a
formidable proposition to attack such a position on such a frontage
with only two Brigades.</p>
<p>The 2nd Brigade (Heane) attacked on the right, the 1st Brigade
(Mackay) on the left, and the first phase was completed to
time-table, with the green objective line, located on the east side
of the long valley, in our possession. The only temporary hitch in
the advance along the whole front was at Robert Wood, where the
enemy held out, and had to be completely enveloped from both flanks
before surrendering.</p>
<p>Then came the second phase, and no difficulty was experienced in
advancing our line 1,000 yards east of the green line, nor in
establishing there a firm line of outposts for the night.</p>
<p>The third phase presented a great deal more difficulty than I
had anticipated. It was to have been undertaken by the 3rd Brigade
(Bennett) pushing without delay through the 1st Brigade, and
advancing in open warfare formation north-easterly towards Cappy,
for the seizure of Hill 90, overlooking that village and on the
south-west of it, and terminating at its northern extremity in the
high bluff of Froissy Beacon.</p>
<p>There was, however, some unexplained delay in the initiation of
this advance, and it was not until about 2 o'clock that the 3rd
Brigade moved forward to the assault of the long slope of the
Chuignes Valley, which still lay before them in this part of the
field. The enemy, under the impression that our attack had spent
itself, had occupied the plateau in great strength, and at first
little progress could be made.</p>
<p>Mobile Artillery was, however, promptly pushed up, and this
proved of great assistance to the infantry. Garenne Wood, on the
top of the plateau, into which large numbers of the enemy had
withdrawn, proved a difficult obstacle, and incapable of capture by
frontal attack. It, too, was conquered by enveloping tactics, and
with its fall the resistance of the enemy rapidly subsided, and the
3rd Brigade had the satisfaction of hunting the fugitives clean off
the plateau into the Cappy Valley.</p>
<p>The whole of this phase of the battle was an especially fine
piece of work on the part of the Regimental Officers. It was open
warfare of the most complete character, and the victory was won by
excellent battle control on the part of the Battalion Commanders,
by splendid co-operation between the four Battalions of the
Brigade, and by intelligent and gallant leadership on the part of
the Company and Platoon Commanders.</p>
<p>Beset as I had been by many anxieties during the early afternoon
as to how the Third Brigade would fare in the difficult task which
had been given it, rendered more difficult by the delay of which I
have spoken, I had the satisfaction that night of contemplating a
victory far greater than I had calculated upon.</p>
<p>For the 32nd Division had successfully captured Herleville, and
the First Division had seized the whole country for a depth of
1&frac12; miles up to a line extending from Herleville to the
western edge of Cappy. The whole Chuignes Valley was ours. By its
capture the enemy had been despoiled of all habitable areas, and
had been relegated to a waste of broken and ruined country between
us and the line of the Somme.</p>
<p>We took that day 21 guns and over 3,100 prisoners from ten
different regiments. The slaughter of the enemy in the tangled
valleys was considerable, for our Infantry are always vigorous
bayonet fighters. They received much assistance from the Tanks in
disposing of the numerous machine gun detachments which held their
ground to the last.</p>
<p>It was a smashing blow, and far exceeded in its results any
previous record in my experience, having regard to the number of
troops engaged. Its immediate result, the same night, was the
capture of Bray by the Third Division, north of the river, thus
completing the work of that Division which the failure of the 47th
Division on their left the day before had compelled them to leave
unfinished. The 40th Battalion took 200 prisoners, with trifling
loss to themselves.</p>
<p>A more remote result, which made itself apparent in the next few
days, was that it compelled the enemy to abandon all hope of
retaining a hold of any country west of the line of the Somme; it
impelled him at last to an evacuation of the great bend of the
river, a process which he began in a very few days.</p>
<p>Such was the battle of Chuignes. Much of the success of this
brilliant engagement was due to the personality of the Divisional
Commander, Major-General Glasgow. He had commenced his career in
the war as a Major of Light Horse, and had participated in the
earliest stages of the fighting on the Gallipoli Peninsula.</p>
<p>Speedily gaining promotion during that campaign, his outstanding
merits as a leader gained him an appointment to the command of the
13th Brigade, when the latter was formed in Egypt in the spring of
1916. For two years he led that Brigade through all its arduous
experiences on the Somme, at Messines and in the third battle of
Ypres.</p>
<p>This fine record was but the prelude to the history-making
performances of the 13th Brigade in 1918 at Dernancourt and
Villers-Bretonneux, and Glasgow seemed easily the most promising,
among all the Brigadiers of that time, as a prospective Divisional
Commander: a judgment which fully justified itself. Of strong
though not heavy build and of energetic demeanour, Glasgow
succeeded not so much by exceptional mental gifts, or by tactical
skill of any very high order, as by his personal driving force and
determination, which impressed themselves upon all his
subordinates. He always got where he wanted to get&mdash;was
consistently loyal to the Australian ideal, and intensely proud of
the Australian soldier.</p>
<p>The number of prisoners captured on this day, and the total
numbers of the enemy encountered in the course of an advance which
was relatively small, pointed to a disposition of troops which was
unusual on the part of the enemy.</p>
<p>According to the principles so strongly emphasized by
Ludendorff, in instructions which he had issued, and copies of
which duly fell into my hands, there was to be, in his scheme of
defensive tactics, a "fore-field" relatively lightly held by
outposts and machine guns. The main line of resistance was to be
well in rear, and there the main concentration of troops was to be
effected.</p>
<p>Why had this dictum been so widely disregarded on this occasion?
It was a question worthy of close inquiry, and two German Battalion
Commanders who were captured by us on that day supplied the
answer.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the message which I issued to
the Corps on the eve of the great opening battle; and to the fact
that a copy of this message had fallen into the hands of the enemy,
probably by the capture of an officer in the close fighting which
took place at Lihons on August 9th and 10th.</p>
<p>In due course the substance of this message was published in the
German wireless news, and in the German press of the time, but
cleverly mistranslated to convey a colouring desirable for the
German public.</p>
<p>It so happened that not long before the opening of our offensive
I had, at the request of the authorities, sent to Australia a
recruiting cable, which appealed to the Australian public for a
maintenance of supplies of fighting men.** That the full text of
this cable also became speedily known to the enemy is a testimony
to the far-flung alertness of their Intelligence Service. It, also,
was published in their press.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The cablegram in question was dated July 13th,
and was in the following terms:<br>
<br>
"Since the opening of the German offensive in March every Division
of the Australian Army in France has been engaged and always with
decisive success. The men of Australia, wherever and whenever they
have entered this mighty conflict, have invariably brought the
enemy to a standstill, and have made him pay dearly for each futile
attempt to pass them on the roads to Amiens and to the Channel
Ports. Their reputation as skilful, disciplined and gallant
soldiers has never stood higher throughout the Empire than it does
to-day. Those who are privileged to lead in battle such splendid
men are animated with a pride and admiration which is tempered only
by concern at their waning numbers. Already some battalions which
have made historic traditions have ceased to exist as fighting
units, and others must follow unless the Australian nation stands
by us and sees to it that our ranks are kept filled. We refuse to
believe that the men and women of Australia will suffer their
famous Divisions to decay, or that the young manhood still
remaining in our home-land will not wish to share in the renown of
their brothers in France. Nothing matters now but to see this job
through to the end, and we appeal to every man to come, and come
quickly, to help in our work, and to share in our glorious
endeavour.</p>
<p class="foot" align="right"><small>"MONASH</small>,
Lieutenant-General."]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basing their editorial comments on this material, the
<i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> of August 17th, 1918, a copy of which I
captured, and another journal whose name was not ascertainable,
because in the copy captured the title had been torn off, both
indulged in arguments, which were long, and intended to be
convincing, to prove to the German people that I had promised my
troops a "break-through"; that I had failed, and that, admittedly,
the "proud" Australian Corps had been shattered, had come to the
end of its resources and was no longer to be taken into calculation
as an instrument of attack by the "English".</p>
<p>It was perfectly legitimate, if clumsy, propaganda. But it was a
curious example of a propaganda which recoiled upon the heads of
its propounders. The Battalion Commanders, who, like all German
officers whom we captured, were always voluble in excuses for their
defeat, pleaded that they had been deceived by the utterances of
their own journals into believing that the Australian offensive
effort had come to an end, once and for all, and that no further
attack by this Corps was possible.</p>

[<i>click map to view larger image</i>]</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was this belief which, they said, had prompted their
respective Divisions (for each of them represented a separate one)
to disregard Ludendorff's prescription; their Divisional Generals
had felt justified in availing themselves of the very excellent
living quarters which existed in the Chuignes Valley, near the
German front line of August 22nd, to quarter all their support and
reserve Battalions.</p>
<p>It was there that we found them&mdash;increasing the population
of the front zone far beyond that which we had been accustomed to
find. Was there ever a more diverting example of a propaganda which
recoiled upon those who uttered it? Intended to deceive the German
public, it ended in deceiving the German front line troops, to
their own lamentable undoing.</p>
<p>Among the captures of the battle of Chuignes, which, as usual,
comprised a large and varied assortment of warlike stores,
including another great dump of engineering materials near Froissy
Beacon, and two complete railway trains, was the monster naval gun
of 15-inch bore, which had been so systematically bombarding the
city of Amiens, and had wrought such havoc among its buildings and
monuments.</p>
<p>It was first reached by the 3rd Australian Battalion (1st
Brigade) during a bayonet charge which cleared Arcy Wood, in the
shelter of which the giant gun had been erected. An imposing amount
of labour had been expended upon its installation, and the most
cursory examination of the effort involved was sufficient to make
it evident that the enemy entertained no expectation of ever being
hurled back from the region which it dominated.</p>
<p>The gun with its carriage, platform and concrete foundations
weighed over 500 tons. It was a naval gun, obviously of the type in
use on the German Dreadnoughts, and never intended by its original
designers for use on land. It had a range of over twenty-four
miles, fired a projectile weighing nearly a ton, and the barrel was
seventy feet long.</p>
<p>It had been installed with the elaborate completeness of German
methods. A double railway track, several miles long, had been built
to the site, for the transport of the gun and its parts. It was
electrically trained and elevated. Its ammunition was handled and
loaded by mechanical means. The adjacent hillside had been
tunnelled to receive the operating machinery, and the supplies of
shells, cartridges and fuses.</p>
<p>The gun and its mounting, when captured, were found to have been
completely disabled. A heavy charge of explosive had burst the
chamber of the gun, and had torn off the projecting muzzle end,
which lay with its nose helplessly buried in the mud. The giant
carriage had been burst asunder, and over acres all around was
strewn the debris of the explosion.</p>
<p>For some time, some of my gunner experts favoured the theory
that the gun had burst accidentally, but the view which ultimately
prevailed was that the demolition had been intentional. Many months
afterwards, the full story of the gun and its performances was
elicited from a prisoner who had belonged to the No. 4 (German)
Heavy Artillery Regiment, and it was circumstantial enough to be
credible.</p>
<p>The story is worthy of repetition, not only because no authentic
account of this wonderful trophy has yet been published, but also
because the history of this gun curiously illuminates the enemy's
plans, intentions and expectations between the dates of his
onslaught in March and his recoil in August.</p>
<p>The substance of the story is as follows: The gun came from
Krupp's. Work on the position was started early in April,
1918&mdash;only a few days after the site had fallen into the
enemy's hands. It was completed and ready for action on the morning
of June 2nd. Its maximum firing capacity was twenty-eight rounds
per day. It fired continuously until June 28th. By this time the
original gun was worn out, having fired over 350 rounds at Amiens.
A new piece was ordered from Krupp's. It arrived on August 7th, and
was ready to fire by 7 p.m. It fired its first round on August 8th
at 2 a.m. and kept on firing till August 9th, firing thirty-five
rounds in all. At 7 a.m. on August 9th, all hands were ordered to
remove everything that was portable and of value. Demolition
charges were laid and fired about 9 a.m. on August 9th. The crew
returned to Krupp's.</p>
<p>It is to be inferred from this narrative that the enemy's defeat
at Hamel on July 4th did not deter him from his enterprise of
replacing the original worn gun, but that after August 8th, he
quite definitely accepted the certainty that he would be allowed no
time to remove the gun intact, and so he destroyed it in order that
we might not be able to use it against him.</p>
<p>This is the largest single trophy of war won by any Commander
during the war, and it was a matter of great regret to me that the
cost of its transportation to Australia was prohibitive. The gun,
as it stands, was, therefore, fenced in, and it has been formally
presented to the City of Amiens as a souvenir of the Australian
Army Corps.</p>
<p>So long as any Australian soldiers remained in France, this spot
was a Mecca to which thousands of pilgrims wandered; and soon there
was, over the whole of the immense structure, not one square inch
upon which the "diggers" had not inscribed their names and
sentiments. There, in the shade of Arcy Wood, the great ruin rests,
a memorial alike of the sufferings of Amiens and of the great
Australian victory of Chuignes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<h4>PURSUIT</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> design which I had formed after the battle of
August 8th of driving the enemy completely out of the bend of the
Somme&mdash;but which I was obliged to abandon for the time being
because of the decision of the Fourth Army to thrust in a
south-easterly direction&mdash;was now about to be realized. The
effect of the battle of Chuignes, following so closely upon the
advance of the Third Army two days before, made it probable that
the enemy would decide upon a definite withdrawal to the line of
the Somme.</p>
<p>It now became my object to ensure, if he should attempt to do
so, firstly, that his withdrawal should be more precipitate than
would be agreeable to him, and, secondly, that when he reached that
line he should be accorded no breathing time to establish upon it a
firm defence from which he could hold us at bay for the remainder
of the fine weather.</p>
<p>The French Army took over from me on the night of the 23rd
August the whole of that portion of my front which still extended
south of Lihons. General Nollet, Commander of the 36th French Corps
(34th and 35th French Divisions), became my southern neighbour,
displacing my Fourth Division, and also a Canadian Division, for
whose sector I had become responsible since the departure of
General Currie, a few days before.</p>
<p>During these redispositions, probably induced to do so by
evidences patent to him that large troop movements were in
progress, the enemy carried out a very heavy gas bombardment and
maintained it for some hours over the whole of the front which was
being taken over by the French.</p>
<p>The wind blowing from the south, the gas, which was unusually
dense, drifted over the whole areas both of the Fourth Australian
and the 32nd British Divisions, and caused a large number of gas
casualties, which weakened the available garrisons of these
sectors.</p>
<p>The Second and Fifth Divisions were brought up on the night of
August 26th to relieve the First Division, which had worthily
earned a rest, and by these redispositions my whole frontage,
which, in spite of the reduction effected, still exceeded nine
miles, was organized to be held by four Divisions, counting from
south to north as follows: 32nd Division, Fifth Division, Second
Division and Third Division, the latter lying north of the River
Somme.</p>
<p>The First and Fourth Divisions were each sent back, the former
to a pleasant reach of the Somme near Chipilly, and the latter to
the neighbourhood of Amiens, there to have a long rest and to
recuperate after their strenuous labours. These two Divisions were,
I had resolved, to be kept in reserve for any <i>tour de force</i>,
the need for which might arise later. This disposition was based on
intuition rather than on reasoning; but the event proved that it
was a fortunate decision; for, at a juncture, three weeks later,
when a great opportunity presented itself, these two Divisions,
then fully rested, proved of priceless value.</p>
<p>The Third Division held my front north of the Somme, and their
presence there ensured my unchallenged tactical control of that
important river valley. Numerous crossings had been systematically
destroyed by the enemy, as he was being driven back from bend to
bend, and as systematically repaired by my indefatigable engineer
and pioneer services, as fast as the ground passed under our
control.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of bridges and culverts is as tedious a business
as their demolition is expeditious. A charge of gun-cotton, placed
in the right spot, a primer, a short length of fuse, or an electric
lead to a press button are all that are needed, and a single sapper
standing by with a match, to be lighted at the last moment, can do
all that is necessary to provide three days' work for a whole
Company of Engineers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the control of the river valley was of inestimable
advantage, for it enabled me to carry out a policy of continuous
and rapid repair. Consequently, during the whole of our subsequent
advance, every means of traversing the valley from south to north,
which had been tampered with, was soon restored, as fast as my
infantry had made good their advance beyond the ruined
crossing.</p>
<p>This facility was to have an important bearing upon my freedom
of action, not many days later, when the Corps came head on to the
north and south stretch of the Somme, and found every bridge gone.
That circumstance alone would have proved an irretrievable
misfortune, if I had not had already available numerous restored
crossings upon the east and west reach of the river. For by that
means, my ability to pass troops and guns rapidly from one bank of
the Somme to the other remained unimpaired.</p>
<p>Before leaving the line, the First Division had captured Cappy
and advanced its line on the right to the western outskirts of
Foucaucourt, while the Third Division had possessed itself of
Suzanne. This was the situation when, on the night of August 26th,
the Second and Fifth Divisions came into the line. Conferences with
the four line Divisions were held both on the 25th and 26th August,
in order to ensure co-ordinate action for the process of hustling
the enemy across the Somme.</p>
<p>I was, at this stage, sorely perplexed by the uncertain attitude
of the Fourth Army. I was all for pushing on energetically, and
received General Rawlinson's approval to do so on August 24th; but
on the very next day he enunciated a diametrically opposite policy,
which greatly embarrassed me.</p>
<p>The gist of the Army attitude on the 25th may be thus expressed.
The presence of a new German Division, the 41st, of whom we had
taken many prisoners in Cappy, pointed to an intention on the part
of the enemy to reinforce. This negatived any intention to
undertake a withdrawal. This conclusion justified a revision of the
Fourth Army policy. The Army had done its fair share; it had drawn
in upon its front all the loose German reserves. Its resources in
Tanks had been depleted, and it would take a month to replace them.
Other Armies would now take up the burden, and the Fourth Army
would now mark time, and await events elsewhere. There was no
object in hastening the enemy's evacuation of the bad ground in the
bend of the Somme, or in our taking possession of it. There was a
possibility of the French taking over more frontage from us, and
the Australian Corps front might in consequence be reduced to a
three-Division front, with three Divisions in Corps Reserve.</p>
<p>The course of events, in the next seven days, convinced me that
the results which were then achieved were totally unexpected by the
Fourth Army, and very vitally influenced the whole subsequent
course of the campaign. In point of fact, Lord Rawlinson quite
frankly conceded to me as much in express terms a week later. The
appreciation made at the time was doubtless an intentionally
conservative one, but it did not take into account the reserve of
striking power which remained in the Australian Corps, even after
the past eighteen days of continuous fighting, and even without the
assistance of the Tanks.</p>
<p>There was only one saving clause in the Army attitude, and this
fortunately gave all the loophole necessary for the continued
activity which I desired to pursue. It was this: "Touch must be
kept with the enemy." This was of course a mere formality of
tactics, and was intended as no more than such. But it was
sufficient to justify an aggressive policy on my part.</p>
<p>As the result of my redispositions, completed by the night of
August 27th, and of my conferences with the line Divisions, each
Division stood on that morning on a single Brigade front, with its
two remaining Brigades arranged in depth behind it. My orders were
that in the event of the enemy giving way, the line Brigade was to
push on energetically, and was to be kept in the line until it had
reached the limits of its endurance. The other two Brigades were to
follow up more leisurely, but to be prepared, each in turn, to
relieve the line Brigade.</p>
<p>I had calculated that, by this method, each Brigade should be
able to function for at least two days on the frontage allotted;
and that, therefore, the present line Divisions could continue for
at least six days; and if the stress upon the troops had not been
severe, they could carry out a second rotation of Brigades for a
second tour of six days. The calculation was, in general terms,
fully realized; and all of the four line Divisions of that day did
actually carry on for twelve days, and two of them for an
additional six days.</p>
<p>The Artillery resources of the Corps were throughout the whole
of this period fully maintained at the standard of the early days
of August. I still had at my disposal eighteen Brigades of Field
Artillery; and so was able to allot four Brigades of Artillery to
each line Division, while keeping two in Corps Reserve.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of August 27th, a policy of vigorous
patrolling all along our front was initiated. At several points,
enemy posts which were known to have been strongly held the night
before were found to be now unoccupied. Although reports varied
along my front, they so fully confirmed my anticipations, that
without waiting to make any reference to the Army, I ordered an
immediate general advance along my whole front.</p>
<p>There followed a merry and exciting three days of pursuit; for
the enemy was really on the run, and by nightfall on August 29th,
not a German who was not a prisoner remained west of the Somme
between P&eacute;ronne and Brie.</p>
<p>In previous years, during the enemy's retreat from Bapaume to
the Hindenburg Line, we had had experience of his methods of
withdrawal. Then they were deliberate, and his rearguards so
methodically and resolutely held up the British advance, that the
enemy had been able not only to remove from the evacuated area
every particle of his warlike stores, which were of any value, but
also to carry out a systematic devastation of the whole area, even
to the felling of all the fruit trees, and the tearing up of all
the railways for miles.</p>
<p>The present withdrawal was of a very different character. To
begin with, it had been forced upon him by the battle of Chuignes,
and he had to undertake it precipitately and without adequate
preparation. Secondly, he had an impassable river behind him, which
could be crossed only at three points, Brie, Eterpigny, and
P&eacute;ronne. Thirdly, he had in front of him a Corps flushed
with its recent victories, while he had been suffering a succession
of defeats and heavy losses.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he put up a good fight, and employed
well-considered tactics. The German Machine Gun Corps was much the
best of all his services. The manner in which the machine gunners
stood their ground, serving their guns to the very last, and
defying even the Juggernaut menace of the Tanks, won the unstinted
admiration of our men. During these three days of retreat the enemy
used his machine guns to the best advantage, and they constituted
the only obstacle to our rapid advance.</p>
<p>These tactics were not unexpected by me, and I had an answer
ready. Defying the whole traditions of Artillery tactics in open
warfare, I insisted upon two somewhat startling innovations. The
first was to break up battery control, by detaching even sections
(two guns), to come under the direct orders of Infantry Commanders
for the purpose of engaging with direct fire any machine-gun nest
which was holding them up.</p>
<p>The second was to insist that all batteries should carry 20 per
cent, of smoke shell. This elicited a storm of protest from the
gunners. Every shell carried which was not a high explosive or
shrapnel shell meant a shell less of destructive power, and,
therefore, a shell wasted. That had been the Gunnery School
doctrine. But I imagine that the test made at this epoch of the
liberal use of smoke shell against machine guns will lead to a
revision of that doctrine.</p>
<p>Smoke shell proved of inestimable value in blinding the German
machine gunners. A few rounds judiciously placed screened the
approach of our Infantry, and many a machine-gun post was thereby
rushed by us from the flanks or even from the rear. General Hobbs
(Fifth Division) and General Rosenthal (Second Division), both of
whom had formerly been gunners, proved the strongest advocates for
these smoke tactics.</p>
<p>By such means an energetic and successful pursuit was launched
and maintained. By the night of August 27th, our line already lay
to the east of the villages of Vermandovillers, Foucaucourt (on the
main road) and Fontaine. We also mastered the whole of the Cappy
bend, including the crossings of the Somme at Eclusier. The Fifth
Division had a particularly hard fight at Foueaucourt, which did
not fall to us until we had subjected it to a considerable
bombardment. Tivoli Wood was the chief obstacle encountered that
day by the Second Division. The advance of the 32nd Division also
progressed smoothly.</p>
<p>During August 28th our advance was continued methodically, and
by that night the Corps front had reached the line
Genermont-Berry-en-Santerre-Estr&eacute;es-Frise.</p>
<p>On August 29th the line of the Somme was reached, and all three
Divisions south of the Somme stood upon the high ground sloping
down to the Somme, with the river in sight from opposite
Cl&eacute;ry, past P&eacute;ronne and as far south as St.
Christ.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Third Division north of the Somme had
marched forward, in sympathetic step with the southern advance,
successively seizing Suzanne, Vaux, Curlu, Hem and Cl&eacute;ry.
The Third Corps on my left had followed up the general advance,
though always lagging a little in rear, thus keeping my left flank
secure; and beyond the Third Corps, the Third Army was approaching
the line of the Canal du Nord, which lay, as explained, in
prolongation of the south-north course of the Somme.</p>
<p>The war correspondents of this time were given to representing
the progress of the Australian Corps during these three days as a
leisurely advance, regulated in its pace by the speed of the
retiring enemy. But it was nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it was his withdrawal which was regulated by
the speed of our advance. There was not a foot of ground which was
not contested by all the effort which the enemy was able to put
forth. It is quite true that his withdrawal was intentional; but it
is not true that it was conducted at the deliberate rate which was
necessary to enable him to withdraw in good order.</p>
<p>He was compelled to fight all the time and to withdraw in
disorder. He was forced to abandon guns and huge quantities of
stores. The amount of derelict artillery ammunition found scattered
over the whole of this considerable area alone reached hundreds of
thousands of rounds, distributed in hundreds of dumps and depots,
as well as scores of tons of empty artillery cartridge-cases, the
brass of which had become of priceless value to the enemy.</p>
<p>Regimental and even Divisional Headquarters were abandoned as
they stood, with all their furniture and mess equipment left
intact. Signal wire and telephone equipment remained installed in
all directions, hospitals and dressing-stations were left to their
fate. The advance yielded to us over 600 prisoners, some half-dozen
field-guns, and large numbers of smaller weapons.</p>
<p>The last two days of the advance led us across a maze of
trenches and the debris of the 1916 campaign. The weather was
unfavourable, there was much rain and an entire absence of any kind
of shelter. As a result the line Brigades had to put forth all
their powers of endurance and reached the Somme in a very tired
condition.</p>
<p>In the meantime my air squadron had an exceptionally busy time.
Contact patrols were maintained throughout every hour of daylight.
Difficult as it was to identify the positions reached by our
leading troops during an organized battle, where their approximate
positions and ultimate objective lines were known beforehand, it
was doubly so when no guide whatever existed as to the probable
extent of each day's advance, or as to the amount of resistance
likely to be encountered at different parts of the front.</p>
<p>Yet it was just under these circumstances that rapid and
reliable information as to the progress of the various elements of
our front line troops was more important than ever, and no means
for obtaining such information was so expeditious as the Contact
Aeroplane.</p>
<p>To assist the air observer in identifying our troops, the latter
were provided with flares, of colours which were varied from time
to time in order to minimize the risk of imitation by the enemy.
The method of their employment, whether singly or in pairs, or
three at a time, was also frequently varied.</p>
<p>These flares on being lit gave out a dense cloud of coloured
smoke, easily distinguishable from a moderate height. The contact
plane, which would carry coloured streamers so that the infantry
could identify it as flying on that particular duty, would, when
ready to observe, blow its horn and thereupon the foremost infantry
would light their flares.</p>
<p>It was a method of inter-communication between air and ground,
which, after a little practice, came to be well understood and
intelligently carried out. By its means a Divisional or Brigade
Commander was kept accurately informed, with great promptitude, of
the progress of each of his front line units, in relation to the
various woods, ruined mills, and other obstacles which lay spread
across their path.</p>
<p>But the Air Force had another interesting duty, which was to
watch the roads leading back from the enemy's front line to his
rear areas. During tranquil times little movement could ever be
seen on the enemy's roads in the hours of daylight, for the very
good reason that he took care to carry out all his transportation
to and from his front zone under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>Now, however, his needs pressed sorely upon him; and our air
reports, from this time onwards, became almost monotonous in their
iteration of the fact that large columns of transport were to be
seen moving back in an easterly direction. These were his retiring
batteries or his convoys of wagons carrying such stores as he was
able to salve.</p>
<p>Occasionally, too, came reports of convoys, which looked like
motor lorries or buses, moving hurriedly westward towards the
German front. These were generally diagnosed by us as
reinforcements which were being continually hurried forward to
replace his human wastage, which was considerable both by direct
losses from death, wounds and capture and by reason of the fatigue
of such a strenuous and nerve-racking retreat.</p>
<p>All this movement in the enemy's rearward areas was a legitimate
object of interest to my Artillery. But, unfortunately, most of it
lay well beyond the range of my lighter Ordnance. The mobile Field
Artillery was effective at no greater range than about four miles.
The longer range 60-pounders found it a formidable task to traverse
such broken country, while the still heavier tractor-drawn 6-inch
guns found it quite impossible.</p>
<p>The latter, and all the Heavy and Super-Heavy guns and howitzers
were tied down to the roads, and it proved a tremendous business to
advance them in sufficient time and numbers to make their influence
felt upon the present situation. I have nothing but praise for the
admirable manner in which Brigadier-General Fraser and his Heavy
Artillery Headquarters carried out the forward moves of the whole
of his extensive Artillery equipment and organization from August
8th onwards to August 23rd. But the rapid advance of the battle
line during the last week of August left the great bulk of Heavy
Artillery far behind.</p>
<p>This was not entirely or even appreciably a question of the rate
of movement of the great lumbering steam or motor-drawn heavy guns.
They could quite easily march their eight or ten miles a day if
they could have a clear road upon which to do it. But it was this
question of roads that dominated the whole situation during this
period, and subsequently until the end of the campaign of the
Corps.</p>
<p>The construction and upkeep of roads throughout the Corps area
had been, even in the days of stationary warfare, a difficult
problem. At a time like the present, when the battle was moving
forward from day to day, it became one of the first magnitude.</p>
<p>The rate of our advance was controlled almost as much by the
speed with which main and secondary roads could be made practicable
for traffic as by the degree of resistance offered by the enemy.
Obstacles had to be removed, the debris of war cleared to one side,
shell holes solidly filled in, craters of mine explosions bridged
or circumvented, culverts repaired and drains freed of
obstructions.</p>
<p>The road surfaces, speedily deteriorating under the strain and
wear of heavy motor lorry traffic, had to be kept constantly under
repair. The transportation of the necessary road stone for this
purpose alone, imposed a heavy burden upon the roads and impeded
other urgent traffic. The amount of road construction and
reconstruction actually in hand within the Corps area, at any one
time, far exceeded that normally required in peace time for any
great city district.</p>
<p>The traffic on the roads was always of the most dense and varied
character. For the proper maintenance and supply of a large Army
Corps at least three good main roads, leading back to our sources
of supply, would have been no more than adequate; but I seldom had
at my disposal more than one such main road, which had often to be
shared with an adjoining Corps.</p>
<p>There was ever an endless stream of traffic, labouring slowly
along in both directions. On such a road as that leading east from
Amiens towards the battle front, the congestion was always extreme.
Ammunition lorries, regimental horsed transport, motor dispatch
riders, marching infantry, long strings of horses and mules going
to and from water, traction engines, convoy after convoy of motor
buses, supply wagons, mess carts, signal motor tenders, complete
batteries of Artillery, motor tractors, tanks, Staff motor cars and
gangs of coolie labourers surged steadily forward, in an amazing
jumble, with never a moment's pause.</p>
<p>Such were some of the difficulties with which I was beset in the
rear of my battle line. They were negligible compared with those
which now loomed in front of it.</p>
<p>The reach of the Somme which runs northerly from Ham past Brie
to P&eacute;ronne and there turns westerly, differs entirely in its
topographical features from that picturesque Somme Valley along
both of whose banks the Corps had been fighting its way forward.
The steep banks have disappeared, and for a mile or so on either
side the ground slopes gently towards the river bed.</p>
<p>The river itself is not less than 1,000 yards wide, being, in
fact, a broad marsh, studded with islets which are overgrown with
rushes, while the stream of the river threads its way in numerous
channels between them. The marsh itself is no more than waist-deep,
but the flowing water is too deep to be waded.</p>
<p>Along the western side of this marsh runs the canalized river,
or, as it is here known, the Somme Canal, flowing between
masonry-lined banks. The construction of a crossing of such a marsh
was, even in peace time, a troublesome business. It meant, to begin
with, a causeway solidly founded upon a firm masonry bed sunk deep
into the mud of the valley bed. The canal itself and each rivulet
required its separate bridge, in spans varying from thirty to sixty
feet.</p>
<p>What, therefore, came to be known as the Brie Bridge, situated
on the line of the main road from Amiens to St. Quentin, really
consisted of no less than eight separate bridges disposed at
irregular intervals along the line of the causeway, between the
western and eastern banks of the valley. The demolition of even the
smallest of these eight bridges would render the whole causeway
unusable, and would prohibit all traffic.</p>
<p>There exists an almost exactly similar arrangement of bridges at
St. Christ, about two miles to the south of Brie, but no other
traffic crossing to the north of Brie until P&eacute;ronne is
reached. There, both the main road and the railway, which cross
side by side, are provided with large span lattice girder bridges,
over the main canal, while the marsh has been reclaimed where the
town has encroached upon it. The river overflow is led through the
town in several smaller canals or drains, all of them liberally
bridged where crossed by roads and streets.</p>
<p>The P&eacute;ronne bridges are, therefore, no less
indispensable, and no less easily rendered useless than those at
Brie. Should such crossings be denied to me, it would be just
possible to pass infantry across the valley, by night, by wading
and swimming, or by the use of rafts, always provided that no
opposition were to be met with. But to pass tanks or heavy guns, or
even vehicles of the lightest description across the marsh, would
have been quite impossible.</p>
<p>The Somme threatened, therefore, to be a most formidable
obstacle to my further advance. It was incumbent upon me to assume
that at the very least one of each series of bridges would be
demolished by the enemy in his retreat. It would have been criminal
folly on his part were it to have been otherwise; and I had had
previous evidence of the efficiency of his engineer services.</p>
<p>Reconnaissances pushed out on the night of August 29th speedily
verified the assumption that some at least of the bridges had been
wrecked. It was ultimately ascertained that every single bridge in
every one of the crossings named had been methodically and
systematically blown to pieces.</p>
<p>There was only one tactical method by which such an obstacle
could be forced by a frontal operation. By bringing up sufficient
Artillery to dominate the enemy's defences on the east bank of the
river valley, it might have been possible to pass across sufficient
infantry to establish a wide bridge-head, behind which the ruined
crossings could be restored, probably under enemy Artillery
fire.</p>
<p>But it would have been a costly enterprise, and fraught with
every prospect of failure, should the enemy be prepared to put up
any sort of a fight to prevent it.</p>
<p>The value to me of the possession of the whole of the Somme
Valley from Cl&eacute;ry westwards, and the rapid repair of the
bridges therein which I had been able to effect, will now become
apparent. For it permitted the crystallizing into action of a
project for dealing with the present situation, which had been
vaguely forming in my mind ever since the day when I took over the
Chipilly spur.</p>
<p>This was the plan of turning the line of the Somme from the
north, instead of forcing it by direct assault from the west.</p>
<p>It may be argued that such a plan would have been equally
practicable, even if the left flank of the Australian Corps had
hitherto remained and now still lay south of the Somme, instead of
well to the north of it. In that case other Corps on the north
would have carried out that identical plan, which ultimately did
achieve this important and decisive result.</p>
<p>I very much doubt it.</p>
<p>I had also had some experience of the futility of relying too
much upon the sympathetic action of flank Corps, who usually had
their hands full enough with their own problems, and had little
time to devote to the needs of their neighbours. It would,
moreover, have been disagreeable and inexpedient in the extreme to
seek a right of way through the territory over which another Corps
held jurisdiction. Corps Commanders were inclined to be jealous of
any encroachment upon their frontiers, or upon the tactical
problems in front of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, I wanted, more than anything else, that this should be
an exclusively Australian achievement.</p>
<p>The situation being as it was, I possessed freedom of action,
elbow room, and control not only of all the territory which I
should require to use, but also of all the Somme crossings west of
Cl&eacute;ry.</p>

<br>
<p>The strategic object in view was to make the line of the Somme
useless to the enemy as a defensive line, and thereby render
probable his immediate further enforced retreat to the Hindenburg
line.</p>
<p>The tactical process by which this was to be achieved was to be
an attack upon and the seizure of the key position of the whole
line, the dominating hill of Mont St. Quentin.</p>
<p>But the paramount consideration was that the attack must be
delivered <i>without delay</i> and that the enemy should not be
allowed a single hour longer than necessary to establish himself
upon that hill.</p>
<p>Often since those days, wondering at the success which came to
the Australian Corps at Mont St. Quentin, I have tried justly to
estimate the causes which won us that success. And I have always
come back to the same conclusion, that it was due firstly and
chiefly to the wonderful gallantry of the men who participated,
secondly to the rapidity with which our plans were put into action,
and thirdly to the sheer daring of the attempt.</p>
<p>Mont St. Quentin lies a mile north of P&eacute;ronne. It stands
as a sentinel guarding the northern and western approaches to the
town, a bastion of solid defence against any advance from the west
designed to encircle it. The paintings and drawings of many artists
who have visited the historic spot will familiarize the world with
its gentle contours.</p>
<p>Viewed from the west, from the vantage point of the high ground
near Biaches in the very angle of the bend of the river, Mont St.
Quentin constitutes no striking feature in the landscape. But
standing upon the hill itself one speedily realizes how fully its
possession dominates the whole of the approaches to it. So placed
that both stretches of the river can from it be commanded by fire,
and giving full and uninterrupted observation over all the country
to the west and north and south of it, the hill is ringed around
with line upon line of wire entanglements, and its forward slopes
are glacis-like and bare of almost any cover.</p>
<p>Estimated by the eye of an expert in tactics, it would surely be
reckoned as completely impregnable to the assault, unaided by
Tanks, of any infantry that should attempt it.</p>
<p>It was the seizure, by a sudden attack, of this tactical key
that was the kernel of the plan which now had to be evolved. The
capture of the town of P&eacute;ronne was consequential upon it,
though little less formidable a task. The effect of both captures
would be completely to turn the whole line of the Somme to the
south, and the line of the Canal du Nord; to open a wide gate
through which the remainder of the Fourth and Third Armies could
pour, so as to roll up the enemy's line in both directions.</p>
<p>In view of the historical importance of the occasion, and the
controversies which have already risen regarding the genesis of the
conception of these plans, I make no apology for reproducing,
<em>in extenso</em>, a literal copy of the notes used at the
conference which I held in the late afternoon of August 29th at the
Headquarters of the Fifth Division, then situated in a group of
bare sheds&mdash;but recently vacated by the enemy&mdash;on the
main east and west road, just south of Proyart. The conference was
attended by Lambert (32nd Division), Hobbs (Fifth Division),
Rosenthal (Second Division), and Gellibrand (Third Division).
Neither "Tanks" nor "Heavy Artillery" attended as they could not,
in any event, co-operate in the execution of the plan.</p>

<p>The above brief notes require but little elucidation. It is to
be remembered that at the time they were prepared, no definite
information had yet been received as to the condition of any of the
Somme crossings, because at that hour the river bank had not yet
been reached, and fighting on the west bank of the Somme was still
going on.</p>
<p>It has also to be remembered that these notes were only for my
own guidance in verbally expounding the plan, and were not actually
issued as written orders. Naturally many details, left unexpressed
by the notes, were filled in during the conference. Moreover I
anticipated that the whole operation would be one of a nature in
which I would have to intervene as the battle proceeded, in
accordance with the varying situation from time to time, and this
actually proved to be necessary.</p>
<p>It will be noted that on August 29th I had already reached the
definite decision not to attempt to force the passage of the Somme
south of P&eacute;ronne; the 32nd Division was, however, instructed
to make every demonstration of a desire to attempt it, the object
being to divert the attention of the enemy from the real point of
attack.</p>
<p>This was to be launched from the direction of Cl&eacute;ry. In
preparation for it, the Second Division sent its reserve Brigade,
the 5th (Martin), to cross the river at Feuill&egrave;res, on
August 30th, to pass through the area and front of the Third
Division, and secure a bridge head on the Cl&eacute;ry side of the
river, opposite to the Ommi&eacute;court bend. The object was to
exploit the possibility of using the Ommi&eacute;court crossing,
and if it were found to be intact to use it for the purpose of
crossing with the remaining two Brigades that same night.</p>
<p>This move was successfully accomplished, although the 5th
Brigade found portion of the village of Cl&eacute;ry still
occupied, and that the trench systems to the east of it were still
held in strength. After much skilful fighting, the Brigade reached
its allotted destination, with slight casualties, capturing seven
machine guns and 120 prisoners.</p>
<p>The bridge at Ommi&eacute;court was found to be damaged, but
repairable so as to be usable by infantry on foot, and this work
was at once put in hand. The same night the re-arrangement of the
fronts of all four Divisions in the line was carried out, and all
was in readiness for the daring attempt to break the line of the
Somme.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of August 30th, General Rawlinson came to
see me, and I unfolded to him the details of the operations
contemplated and the arrangements made for the next day. I have
already referred to the pleasant and attractive personality of this
distinguished soldier. His qualities of broad outlook, searching
insight, great sagacity, and strong determination, tempered by a
wise restraint, never failed to impress me deeply. He always
listened sympathetically, and responded convincingly. On this
occasion he was pleased to be pleasantly satirical. "And so you
think you're going to take Mont St. Quentin with three battalions!
What presumption! However, I don't think I ought to stop you! So,
go ahead, and try!&mdash;and I wish you luck!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<h4>MONT ST. QUENTIN AND P&Eacute;RONNE</h4>
<p>F<small>ROM</small> early dawn on Saturday, August 31st, until
the evening of September 3rd, three Divisions of the Australian
Corps engaged in a heroic combat which will ever be memorable in
Australian history.</p>
<p>At its conclusion we emerged complete masters of the situation.
Mont St. Quentin, the Bouchavesnes spur, the large town of
P&eacute;ronne, and the high ground overlooking it from the east
and north-east, were in our possession. A wide breach had been
driven into the line of defence which the enemy had endeavoured to
establish on the series of heights lying to the east of the Somme
and of the Canal du Nord.</p>
<p>From the edges of this breach, the flanks of that portion of his
line which were still intact were being threatened with
envelopment. For him there was nothing for it, but finally to
abandon the line of the Somme, and to resume his retreat
helter-skelter to the hoped-for secure protection of the great
Hindenburg Line.</p>
<p>The extraordinary character of this Australian feat of arms can
best be appreciated by a realization of the supreme efforts which
the enemy put forward to prevent it.</p>
<p>The shower of blows which he had received on the front of his
Second Army from August 8th onwards, had wrought upon it a grievous
disorganization. The battered remnants of his line Divisions had
been reinforced from day to day by fresh units, scraped up from
other parts of his front, and thrown into the fight as fast as they
could be made available.</p>
<p>Sometimes they were complete Divisions from Reserve, often
single reserve Regiments of Divisions already deeply involved, and
sometimes even single Battalions torn from other
Regiments&mdash;Pioneer Battalions, units of the Labour Corps, Army
Troops, Minenwerfer Companies had all been thrown in,
indiscriminately.</p>
<p>This brought about a heterogeneous jumble of units, and of
German nationalities, for Prussians, Bavarians, Saxons and
W&uuml;rtembergers were captured side by side. The tactical control
of such mixed forces, during a hasty and enforced retreat, and
their daily maintenance, must have presented sore perplexities to
the Headquarters of the German Second Army in those fateful
days.</p>
<p>To meet the crisis with which Ludendorff was now confronted, he
determined to throw in one of the finest of the reserve Divisions
still left at his disposal. The Second Prussian Guards Division was
sent forward to occupy the key position of Mont St. Quentin, and to
hold it at all costs.</p>
<p>This famous Division comprised among its units, the Kaiserin
Augusta and the Kaiser Alexander Regiments, almost as famous in
history and rich in tradition as are our own Grenadiers and
Coldstreams. There is no doubt that this celebrated Division fought
desperately to obey its instructions.</p>
<p>For the defence of P&eacute;ronne, the enemy command went even
further, and called for volunteers, forming with them a strong
garrison of picked men drawn from many different line Regiments, to
man the ramparts which surround the town. Dozens of machine guns
were posted in vantage points from which the approaches could be
swept.</p>
<p>All over the river flats lying in the angle of the Somme between
Cl&eacute;ry, Mont St. Quentin and P&eacute;ronne ran line upon
line of barbed wire entanglements, a legacy from the 1916 fighting,
and much of this was still intact, although breaches had been made
in many places both by the French in 1917 and by the Germans
themselves, to facilitate movement over the ground, during their
respective re-occupations of this territory.</p>
<p>The terrain, which was in greater part open, and exposed in
every direction to full view from the heights, sloped gently
upwards towards the commanding knoll. Cover was scarce, and the few
ruins of brickfields and sugar refineries which dotted the
landscape had also been garrisoned by the enemy as centres of
resistance, designed to break up and dislocate any general
attack.</p>
<p>Our infantry was deprived of the assistance of any Tanks, for
the heavy casualties which had been suffered by this Arm made it
imperative to allow the Tank Corps time for repairs, renewals and
the training of fresh crews. Nor was any appreciable quantity of
Heavy Artillery yet available, since the congested and dilapidated
condition of the roads prevented the advance of all but a few of
the lighter varieties of heavy guns.</p>
<p>The fighting of these four days was, therefore, essentially a
pure infantry combat, assisted only by such mobile Artillery of
lesser calibres as was available.</p>
<p>Such was the formidable nature of the task, and of the
disabilities under which the Second, Third and Fifth Divisions
approached it. That they overcame all obstacles, gained all their
objectives, and captured nearly 2,000 prisoners, mainly from crack
Prussian regiments, constitutes an achievement memorable in
military annals and standing to the everlasting glory of the troops
who took part in it.*</p>

<p>It is difficult to write a connected and consecutive account of
the details of the fighting which took place. The most that is
possible in the brief space available is to indicate on general
lines the successive stages of the battle. Indeed, a minute account
of the action of each of the 35 Battalions engaged would only prove
wearisome and confusing. The best method of presenting a general
picture of the course of the engagement is to follow the fortunes
of each Brigade in turn.</p>
<p>First in order of time, and of most importance in relation to
its immediate results, was the action of the Second Division. It
was the 5th Brigade (Martin) which Major-General Rosenthal had
detailed to open the attack. The remaining two Brigades of the
Divisions (6th and 7th) received orders to rest the troops as much
as possible, but to be in readiness to move at the shortest
notice.</p>
<p>A Machine Gun Company (16 guns) was placed at the disposal of
Brigadier-General Martin, while the Artillery at the disposal of
the Division, comprising five Brigades of Field Artillery and one
Brigade of Heavy Artillery, remained under the personal control of
the Divisional Commander.</p>
<p>The attack opened with three Battalions of the 5th Brigade in
the first line, and one Battalion in support. The total strength of
the assaulting Infantry of this whole Brigade was on this day not
more than 70 Officers and 1,250 other ranks. The centre Battalion
was directed straight at the highest knoll of Mont St. Quentin,
while the right Battalion prolonged the line to the right. The left
Battalion had assigned to it as an immediate objective the ruins of
the village of Feuillaucourt, from which it was hoped that a flank
attack upon the Mount could be developed.</p>
<p>The advance began at 5 a.m. It was a dull morning and still
quite dark. The two right Battalions advanced with as much noise as
possible, a ruse which secured the surrender of numbers of the
enemy lying out in advanced outpost positions. A nest of seven
Machine Guns was rushed and captured without any loss to us.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, our Artillery opened on selected targets,
the ranges being lengthened from moment to moment in sympathy with
the advance of the Infantry. Although during the advance a great
deal of machine gun fire was encountered, all went well. The centre
and left Battalions gained a footing respectively in Feuillaucourt
and on the main hill, but the progress of the right Battalion was
arrested by heavy machine gun fire from St. Denis. This was the
site of a ruined sugar refinery, and lay on the main road between
P&eacute;ronne and Mont St. Quentin. It was a strong point that
presented a great deal of difficulty and held out to the last.</p>
<p>The centre Battalion had by 7 a.m. passed through the ruins of
Mont St. Quentin village and had crossed the main road from
P&eacute;ronne to Bouchavesnes. It now had to receive the full
brunt of a determined counter attack, at a moment when it was still
disorganized and breathless from its difficult assault. The
Battalion was therefore withdrawn across the road and firmly
established itself in an old trench system to the west of it.</p>
<p>In this position it beat off five successive counter attacks,
inflicting most severe losses upon the enemy. The Brigade
maintained its position until nightfall. Its losses for the day
were 380.</p>
<p>In the meantime the 6th Brigade (Robertson) of the Second
Division had been ordered to cross the Somme and move up behind the
5th Brigade, in readiness to carry on the attack, and obtain
possession of the remainder of the main spur of Mont St. Quentin.
As this Brigade only entered into the fight at a later hour, I must
revert to the events of the forenoon of August 31st.</p>
<p>It was about 8 a.m. that I was able to report to General
Rawlinson, by telephone, that we had obtained a footing on Mont St.
Quentin itself. He was at first totally incredulous, but soon
generously congratulatory, proclaiming that the event was
calculated to have a most important influence upon the immediate
future course of the war. He expressed the hope that we should be
able to hold on to all that we had gained.</p>
<p>To this task I now had to bend myself, and I found it necessary
to put a severe strain upon the endurance and capacity of the
troops. Great as had always been my concern in the pitched battles
of the days recently passed to reduce to very definite limits the
demands made upon the physical powers of the Infantry soldier, a
juncture had arrived and a situation had been created, which
demanded the utmost rapidity in decision and action, and a
relentless insistence upon prompt response by the troops.</p>
<p>The 5th Brigade had been thrust out nearly two miles beyond our
general line. Its flanks were in the air. It was undoubtedly
fatigued. Everything must be done and done promptly to render it
adequate support, to take advantage of its success, and to ensure
that its effort had not been in vain.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the Fifth and Second Divisions had
both been instructed to endeavour to secure a crossing over the
river. Whichever Division first succeeded was to accord right of
way to its neighbour. No success had yet attended the efforts of
the Fifth Division, the main P&eacute;ronne bridges being still
inaccessible from the south. The bridge sites were under the
enemy's fire, which precluded the possibility of repair; and the
approaches to them were also swept by Machine Gun fire.</p>
<p>The Second Division, on the other hand, had during the past 48
hours succeeded in making the Feuill&egrave;res bridge traffickable
for guns and vehicles, and those at Buscourt and Ommi&eacute;court
for foot traffic. It transpired later that the enemy, rightly
suspecting that I would attempt to use this latter crossing, kept
it under heavy Artillery fire all day.</p>
<p>As soon as I had formed a judgment on the situation, about 8.30
a.m. (August 31st), I issued instructions to General Hobbs
immediately to put in motion his reserve Brigade, the 14th
(Stewart). He was to direct it towards the Ommi&eacute;court
crossing, and later in the day to pass it across the river and
through the ground won that morning by the 5th Brigade, with a view
to developing at the earliest possible moment an attack in a
south-easterly direction upon the town of P&eacute;ronne itself.
The ultimate objective was still to be the high ground south and
east of P&eacute;ronne. His 8th Brigade was also to be held ready
to move at the shortest notice.</p>
<p>It was a serious performance to demand, and it was fraught with
many risks. There was no time to assemble responsible Commanders
concerned, separated as they were by long distances over bad and
congested roads. In the absence of properly co-ordinated action,
there was every chance of confusion, and cross-purposes, and even
of collision of authority arising from the troops of one Division
passing over ground under the tactical control of another
Division.</p>
<p>But the only alternative was to do nothing and attempt nothing.
That would have been the worst of bad generalship, and it was an
occasion when risks must be taken.</p>
<p>The course of subsequent events fully demonstrated that the only
true solution was the one chosen, for the whole of the defences of
P&eacute;ronne were thereby taken with a rush, while they were
still being organized by the enemy. The delay of only a day or two
would have meant that the capture of P&eacute;ronne would have been
many times more costly than it actually proved to be.</p>
<p>The 14th Brigade had before it a march of some seven miles to
bring it into a position in which it could deploy for an attack on
P&eacute;ronne. Working according to text book such a march could
have been accomplished in something under three hours. It took the
Brigade over ten hours. For the line of march lay across the very
worst of the shell-torn, tangled country enclosed in the great bend
of the Somme, and progress was most difficult and exhausting.
Frequent halts were necessary to rest the men, and restore order to
the struggling columns.</p>
<p>Discovering the impossibility of crossing the river at
Ommi&eacute;court, the Brigade made a wide detour to cross by the
newly established bridge at Buscourt. It arrived there just at the
same time as the 7th Brigade (Wisdom), which Rosenthal had also
directed to the same point for the same purpose. This occurrence
illustrates the nature of the risks of a hastily developed tactical
plan. However, the good sense of the Commanders on the spot
obviated any serious confusion and the 7th Brigade gave the 14th
Brigade the right of way.</p>
<p>The 14th Brigade completed its march during the hours of falling
darkness and, passing through Cl&eacute;ry, came up on the right of
the 6th Brigade, in readiness for the combined attack by the two
Divisions at dawn on September 1st.</p>
<p>The night that followed was a stressful one for all Commanders.
Divisional Generals had to co-ordinate all action between their
Brigadiers, and their Artillery. The Brigadiers in turn had
afterwards to assemble their Battalion Commanders, and decide on
detailed plans of action for each separate unit. Distances were
long, the country was strange, roads were few and unfamiliar; so
that it is not surprising that the last conferences did not break
up until well into the small hours of September 1st. There was no
sleep that night for any senior officer in the battle area.</p>
<p>September 1st was a day full of great happenings and bloody hand
to hand fighting. The assault by the 6th Brigade passing over the
line won the day before by the 5th Brigade carried it well over the
crest of Mont St. Quentin, and confirmed for good and all our hold
on that imperious fortress. Few prisoners were taken, for it was
bayonet work over every inch of the advance, and the field was
strewn all over with enemy dead. The impetus of the 6th Brigade
assault carried our line 600 yards to the east of the summit of the
knoll.</p>
<p>It is difficult to allocate, in due proportion, the credit for
the capture of this important stronghold between the two gallant
Brigades concerned. It is true that the 6th Brigade did on
September 1st achieve the summit of the Mount; but it is equally
true that it only completed what the 5th Brigade had so wonderfully
begun the day before. No one will grudge to either of the two
Brigades their share of the honour that is due to both.</p>
<p>The action of the Second Division on that day was completed by
the bringing up of the 7th Brigade into a position of support
behind the 6th Brigade, thereby relieving the 5th Brigade from
further line duty.</p>
<p>Although the action of the individual Brigades of all the three
battle Divisions must necessarily be narrated separately and with
some attempt at a proper chronological sequence, yet it would be a
mistake to suppose that their actions were independent of each
other. On the contrary, they all operated as part of a
comprehensive battle plan, which necessarily took full account of
the interdependence of the course of events in different parts of
the field.</p>
<p>Thus the advance on this day of the 6th Brigade materially
assisted the attack on P&eacute;ronne by the 14th Brigade, while
the progress of the latter removed much trouble from the southern
flank of the 6th Brigade.</p>
<p>The men of the 14th Brigade that day had their mettle up to a
degree which was astonishing. On the occasion of the great attack
of August 8th, and ever since, it had been the cruel fate of this
Brigade to be the reserve unit of its Division on every occasion
when there was any serious fighting in hand. The Brigade felt its
position very keenly. As one Company Commander, who distinguished
himself in that day's fighting, afterwards picturesquely put it:
"You see! We'd been trying to buy a fight off the other fellows for
a matter of three weeks. On that day we got what we'd been looking
for, and we made the most of it." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Hughes, the Commonwealth Prime Minister,
visited the battlefield of Mont St. Quentin, with a distinguished
company, on September 14th. The officer in question, standing near
the summit of the hill, was about to relate his experiences, and
this was his preamble.]</p>
<p>The 14th Brigade advanced to the assault at 6 a.m. concurrently
with the eastern thrust of the 6th Brigade. One Battalion, with two
others in support, was directed against St. Denis, while the fourth
made a direct attack on P&eacute;ronne. Many belts of wire had to
be struggled through. There was much machine gun fire, from front
and flanks, and it looked as if further progress would be
impossible. Nevertheless, this gallant Brigade, by persistent
effort, made itself master of the western half of
P&eacute;ronne.</p>
<p>The attack on St. Denis at first made very slow progress, the
enemy holding out resolutely in the ruins of that hamlet, and in
the adjacent brickfields. During the day, the 15th Brigade made
spirited attempts to effect the crossing of the river, and to
co-operate from the south.</p>
<p>The records of the events of these three days are confused and
discontinuous. Many of the men who could have filled in the gaps of
the story were unfortunately killed or evacuated as casualties. But
from the mass of reports, the salient facts emerge clearly.</p>
<p>The 15th Brigade succeeded, on September 2nd, in putting a
Battalion across the river, and this assisted the 14th Brigade to
"mop up" the remainder of the town of P&eacute;ronne. Eater the
rest of the 15th Brigade and two Battalions of the 8th Brigade
(Tivey) were also drawn into the fighting. St. Denis and the
brickfields fell to us during this period.</p>
<p>Although the situation, from the point of view of the advance
eastwards, remained almost stationary, it was a time of fierce
local fighting. Many deeds of valour and sacrifice adorn the
story.</p>
<p>It was late on September 3rd that the effects of this
long-sustained struggle became apparent. The whole of
P&eacute;ronne and most of the high ground in its vicinity were, by
then, definitely in our hands, and although the little suburb of
Flamicourt held out determinedly for another day, the further
resistance of the enemy began to fade away.</p>
<p>Doubtless the loss of Mont St. Quentin was a controlling factor
in the decision which was forced upon him to undertake a retreat,
for with that eminence in our possession, he could not have
maintained himself for many days in the town, nor would its
retention have been of any tactical value to him.</p>
<p>As an immediate result, the high ground of the Flamicourt spur
just south of P&eacute;ronne fell into our hands on September 3rd,
and the enemy outposts spread along the banks of the marsh in front
of the 32nd Division sought safety from complete envelopment by a
hasty withdrawal; a number of their isolated posts were, however,
left unwarned of this retreat, so that these were, later on,
captured by us from the rear.</p>
<p>I must now briefly turn to the doings of the Third Australian
Division during these four epic days. Its three Brigades (9th, 10th
and 11th) daily performed prodigies of valour. The Division carried
our line, inexorably, up the Bouchavesnes spur in a north-easterly
direction. The seizure of this very important ground not only
powerfully aided but also strongly confirmed our seizure of Mont
St. Quentin.</p>
<p>The Division, having been given its general r&ocirc;le, was
necessarily left to a large extent to decide for itself its
detailed action from day to day, seeing that it still had to
perform the function, inevitable for a flank Division, of a link
with my neighbouring Corps. Fortunately the arrival of a new, fresh
Division (the 74th) from the Eastern theatre of war, which came
into the Third Corps and was promptly thrown in, enabled that Corps
to keep up fairly well with the general advance.</p>
<p>The British Third Army, too, was now beginning to make its
pressure felt, and was approaching the line of the Canal du Nord
over a wide front. The Third Division was therefore free to conform
its forward movement to that of the rest of the Australian Corps;
its energetic action gave me elbow room for the man&oelig;uvring of
so many Brigades in the region of Cl&eacute;ry, and its capture of
so much valuable ground east of the Canal du Nord served greatly to
widen the breach.</p>
<p>By the night of September 3rd, the main tactical purposes on
which the Corps had been launched on August 29th had been achieved
in their entirety. Their execution furnishes the finest example in
the war of spirited and successful Infantry action conducted by
three whole Divisions operating simultaneously side by side.</p>
<p>Lord Rawlinson has more than once referred to the operation as
the finest single feat of the war. Inevitably the dramatic and
unlooked for success of the Second Division in the rapid storming
of the Mount enthrals the imagination and overshadows all the other
noteworthy incidents of these pregnant days. But none will begrudge
the rain of congratulations which fell upon the head of
Major-General Rosenthal. A massive man, whose build belies his
extraordinary physical energy, he always was an egregious optimist,
incapable of recognizing the possibility of failure. That is why he
invariably succeeded in all that he undertook, and often embarked
upon the apparently impossible. An architect before the war, he
served for the first two years as an Artillery officer, both as a
Brigade Commander and as a General of Divisional Artillery. He
gained his Infantry experience as Commander of the 9th Brigade, and
so was well qualified by versatile service to assume the command of
the Second Division. His leadership of the latter contributed in no
small measure to the fame which it has won.</p>

very short notice, imposed upon him, personally, difficulties of no
mean order. I am prepared to admit quite frankly that the demands
which I had to make upon him, his Staff and his Division were
severe.</p>
<p>Following upon four days of arduous pursuit, his troops were
called upon to undertake a long and difficult march over a most
broken country, to be followed by three days of intensive fighting
of the most severe character.</p>
<p>General Hobbs was, first and foremost, a lover of the Australian
soldiers, and their devoted servitor. He belonged to that type of
citizen-soldier who, before the war, had spent long years in
preparing himself for a day when his country would surely require
his military services. Like several of the most successful of
Australia's generals, he had specialized in Artillery, and was, in
fact, selected as the senior Artillery Commander of Australia's
first contingent. That fact alone was the stamp of his ability.
While he would be the last to lay claim to special brilliance, or
outstanding military genius, he nevertheless succeeded fully as the
Commander of a Division, by his sound common sense, and his sane
attitude towards every problem that confronted him. He possessed
also the virtue of a large-hearted sympathy for all subordinate to
him; and that gave him a loyal following, which carried him
successfully through several great crises in the affairs of the
Fifth Division.</p>
<p>This period was one of those crises. When, late on the afternoon
of August 31st, he urged upon me with much earnestness the stress
upon his troops, and repeated the anxious representations of his
Brigadiers&mdash;I was compelled to harden my heart and to insist
that it was imperative to recognize a great opportunity and to
seize it unflinchingly. His response was loyal and whole-hearted.
His Division followed the lead which he thus gave them, and he led
them to imperishable fame.</p>
<p>Considerable re-dispositions followed upon the transfer of my
battle front to the country east of the Somme. These, and the
reasons which governed their nature, chief among which was the
resumption of the enemy's rearward movement, I shall deal with in
due course.</p>
<p>Battle problems on the grand scale were, for the moment,
relegated to the background, and there now arose a multitude of
other problems, almost equally burdensome, relating to the supply
and maintenance of the Corps.</p>
<p>Every Corps must be based upon a thoroughly reliable and
efficient line of supply, and for this a railway in first-class
operating condition is a prime essential. Every kind of requisite
must be carried by rail to some advanced distribution point called
a "railhead". Thence supplies are distributed by motor lorry to the
areas still further forward.</p>
<p>The appropriate distance of the railhead behind the battle front
is conditioned by the available supply of motor lorries, and their
range of action. If the distance be too great the stress upon the
mechanical transport becomes so severe that it rapidly
deteriorates, and an undue proportion of lorries daily falls out of
service. As the facilities for repair in the mobile workshops are
strictly limited, an excessive rate of wastage among these vehicles
soon dislocates the whole supply arrangements.</p>
<p>The experience hitherto gained had demonstrated that a railhead
could not conveniently be allowed to fall behind our advance more
than ten or twelve miles. This limit had already been reached when
the Corps front arrived on the west bank of the Somme, and the
strain upon the lorry service was already great.</p>
<p>For a further deep advance of the whole Corps in pursuit of the
enemy towards the Hindenburg Line, still distant another fifteen
miles, it became imperative, therefore, that the railway service to
P&eacute;ronne and beyond should be speedily re-opened, or some
equally efficient alternative provided. The great lattice girder
railway bridge at P&eacute;ronne had been irretrievably demolished.
Engineers estimated that it would take two months to restore it,
and at least a month to provide even a temporary deviation and
crossing. Nevertheless, the work was put in hand without delay.</p>
<p>An alternative possibility was to construct a new line of
railway to connect the existing military line at Bray to the
P&eacute;ronne railway station, a length of new construction
amounting to some six miles. It was estimated that such a link
could be built in a fortnight, and this work also was commenced
forthwith.</p>
<p>There was a third possibility. This was speedily to repair that
portion of the railway which lay west of the Somme, and to
establish a railhead near P&eacute;ronne, but on the opposite bank
of the river. This proposal involved only a few days' work, for
extensive sidings already existed on the west bank, and had been
left more or less undamaged by the enemy. But it also involved the
complete restoration of all road traffic bridges, both at
P&eacute;ronne and at Brie, for the service of the intense traffic
which would ensue across the Somme from such a point of
departure.</p>
<p>The rebuilding of the crossings was, in any case, a matter of
urgent necessity. By this time all my heaviest guns had already
been brought up to the vicinity of the west bank of the Somme, and
had there perforce to wait; for a long detour, on the
densely-crowded roads, to cross the Somme, say as far back as
Corbie, where bridges were strong and grades were easy, was out of
the question.</p>
<p>The problem, therefore, involved a stable and comprehensive
reconstruction; half measures would not meet the case. But half
measures were an inevitable necessity of the situation, to begin
with, because troops had to be fed, and their supplies could be
carried in no lighter way, in adequate quantities, than in the
normal horse-transport wagons.</p>
<p>The order of procedure had, therefore, to be, firstly, hastily
to reconstruct some sort of bridging, based generally upon the
wreckage of the original bridge, and strong enough to carry loads
up to those of horsed wagons; next to stay, strut and strengthen
these temporary bridges to fit them for the passage of the lighter
guns, and finally to reconstruct them in their entirety for the
heaviest loads.</p>
<p>At a point such as the southern entrance to P&eacute;ronne,
where the approaches could not be conveniently deviated, the
difficulties of such successive reconstructions, while the flow of
traffic had to be maintained, can hardly be fully realized.</p>
<p>For many days, in the early part of September, Brie, Eterpigny
and P&eacute;ronne were scenes of feverish activity. Every
available technical unit that could be spared from other urgent
duty was concentrated upon this vital work. Most of the Engineer
Field Companies, three of the five Pioneer Battalions, both
Tunnelling Companies, and all the Army Troops Companies, laboured
in relays, night and day.</p>
<p>Hundreds of tons of steel girders, of all lengths and sections,
were hurried up, by special lorry service. Pile-driving gear was
hastily improvised. The wreckage of the original bridges was
overhauled for sound, useful timbers. The torn and twisted
steelwork was dragged out of the way by horse or steam power, and
tumbled in a confused mass into the river bed. Hammer, saw and axe
were wielded with a zest and vigour rarely seen in peace-time
construction. The whole work was supervised by my Chief Engineer,
Brigadier-General Foott, and was later, when the advance of the
Corps was resumed, completed by the Army authorities. The speed and
punctuality with which the first temporary viaducts were completed
and ready for use were exemplary, and reflect every credit upon
Foott and his helpers. Within forty-eight hours bridges usable for
ordinary supplies and for field guns became available, and
thereafter were rapidly strengthened by successive stages.</p>
<p>The whole work of restoration, in which the Australian technical
services played so prominent a part, won the highest praise from
the Field Marshal, who expressed his appreciation in a special
message of thanks to these services.</p>
<p>The congestion of traffic at the P&eacute;ronne bottleneck was,
however, serious. Blocks occurred, reminiscent of those which are
familiar in the heart of London when the dense traffic is
temporarily held up by a passing procession. Marching troops always
had the right of way; and a Division on the move up to or back from
the line meant a severe super-load upon the already overtaxed road
capacity.</p>
<p>Sometimes a block of traffic would occur for an hour at a time,
and a motley collection of vehicles, stretching back for miles,
would pile up on the roads. The capabilities of a very able road
and traffic control service, numbering hundreds of officers and
men, acting under the direction of my Provost Marshal, were often
severely tested. More than once my own motor car was unavoidably
held up at this bottleneck for half an hour at a time, on
occasions, too, when the situation required my urgent presence at
some important meeting.</p>
<p>All these minor embarrassments arising from the passage by the
Australian Corps of a great military obstacle such as the Somme
were, however, soon dissipated. The Somme had loomed large, for
many days, in the minds of all of us&mdash;first as a problem of
tactics, and next as a problem of engineering. Before the end of
the first week of September the Somme had ceased to hold our
further interest. It had become a thing that was behind us, both in
thought and in actuality.</p>
<p>The enemy was once more on the move, and it became our business
to press relentlessly on his heels.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h4>A LULL</h4>
<p>D<small>URING</small> the closing days of August events had
commenced to move rapidly; for the offensive activities initiated
by the Fourth Army, three weeks earlier, began to spread in both
directions along the Allied front.</p>
<p>The Third British Army had entered the fray on August 21st; the
First British Army was ready with its offensive on August 26th, on
which date the Canadian Corps, restored to its old familiar
battleground, delivered a great attack opposite Arras.</p>
<p>The French, who, on my right flank, had along their front
followed up the enemy retirement begun after the battle of
Chuignes, reached Roye on August 27th, and Noyon on August 28th.
Their line, however, still bore back south-westerly from the
vicinity of the river near Brie and St. Christ.</p>
<p>By August 29th the line of the First Army had reached and passed
Bapaume, and that of the Third Army cut through Combles. The Third
Corps, on my immediate left, had made good its advance as far as
Maurepas.</p>
<p>Thus, the thrust of the Australian Corps beyond the Canal du
Nord, on August 31st to September, 3rd, formed the spearhead which
pierced the Somme line, and the Corps was still leading the advance
both of the French and the British.</p>
<p>From the morning of September 4th the evidences of the enemy's
resolution to withdraw to the Hindenburg Line became hourly more
unmistakable. His Artillery fire died down considerably,
particularly that from his long range and high velocity guns. These
were probably already on the move to the rear, in order to clear
the roads for his lighter traffic.</p>

August 23rd, 1918</small></p>
<br>
<p>The high ground near Biaches (west of P&eacute;ronne) provided a
vantage point from which an extensive view of the whole country
could be obtained. There lay before us, beyond the Somme, a belt
about eight miles deep, which had scarcely suffered at all from the
ravages of the previous years of war.</p>
<p>It was gently undulating country, liberally watered, and heavily
wooded, especially in the minor valleys, in which snuggled numerous
villages still almost intact and habitable, although, of course,
entirely deserted by the civilian population.</p>
<p>Beyond this agreeable region there began again an area of
devastation, which grew in awful thoroughness as the great
Hindenburg Line was approached some six miles further on. For,
through the autumn and winter of 1917, and up to the moment of the
German offensive in March, 1918, it was there that the British
Fifth Army had faced the enemy in intensive trench fighting.</p>
<p>In all directions over this still habitable belt there were now
signs of unusual life and activity. Columns of smoke began to rise
in the direction of all the villages. Sounds of great explosions
rent the air. These were sure indications that the enemy was
burning the stores which he could not hope to salve, and was
destroying his ammunition dumps lest they should fall into our
hands.</p>
<p>A vigorous pursuit was now the policy most to be desired. But my
troops in the line were very tired from the exertions of a great
struggle, and many of the units, by reason of their battle losses,
required time to reorganize and refit. It was also essential that
no rapid advance should be attempted until the arrangements for
supply, depending upon the completion of the Somme crossings, had
been assured.</p>
<p>The general line of advance of the Corps had, during August,
been in a due easterly direction. The operations about
P&eacute;ronne had necessitated a drive north-easterly, and the
advance of my Third Division up the Bouchavesnes spur had carried
them square across the line of advance of the Third Corps.</p>
<p>The first step was to restore our original Corps boundaries, and
to resume the original line of advance. By arrangement with General
Godley, his 74th Division took over the ground captured by my Third
Division, which was thereby released and enabled to concentrate,
for a couple of days' rest, in the Cl&eacute;ry region. The Second
Division employed its 7th Brigade on September 2nd and 3rd to
advance our line beyond Haut Allaines, another two miles east of
Mont St. Quentin, routing from the trenches of that spur the strong
rear-guards which the enemy had posted for the purpose of delaying
us.</p>
<p>On the night of September 4th the 74th Division took over the
Haut Allaines spur also, thereby releasing my Second Division, and
the latter was withdrawn to the Cappy area for a thorough and
well-deserved rest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 32nd Imperial Division, availing itself of the
temporary crossings which had hastily been effected over the Somme,
brought its front up, on the eastern bank of the river, level with
the line which had by September 4th been reached by the Fifth
Australian Division.</p>
<p>On September 5th, therefore, I had, east of the Somme, two
Divisions in the line, the 32nd on the right or south, the Fifth
Australian on the left or north, each operating on a frontage of
two Brigades, with one Brigade in reserve. This was, however, quite
a temporary arrangement, devised merely to allow time for the Third
Division to re-organize and resume its place in the front line of
the general advance.</p>
<p>The general withdrawal of the enemy, over a very wide front, now
began to effect a very substantial reduction of the length of
frontage which he had to defend. The enemy communiqu&eacute;s and
wireless propaganda of that time busied themselves with the
explanation that the withdrawals in progress were being
deliberately carried out for the very purpose of releasing forces
from the line to form a great strategic reserve.</p>
<p>These protestations did not deceive us, nor did we on our part
fail also to take full advantage of the steady shortenings of the
Allied front. Marshal Foch decided once again to readjust the
international boundary, and my own front was thereby considerably
shortened. The French took over from the 32nd Division all ground
south of the main Amiens-St. Quentin road; and that road henceforth
became my southern boundary.</p>
<p>This, coupled with the re-adjustment of the northern boundary
with the Third Corps, as already narrated, reduced the total
frontage for which I remained responsible to about ten thousand
yards, an extent which was never again exceeded. It was still,
however, in my judgment, too long a frontage for an effective
pursuit by only two Divisions, and arrangements were initiated on
the same day to bring back the Third Division into line.</p>
<p>During September 5th I advanced my front to the line Athies-Le
Mesnil-Doingt-Bussy. Severe fighting took place near Doingt.
Opposition came mainly from machine guns; but isolated field-guns
also gave us trouble. We captured that day about a hundred and
fifty prisoners.</p>
<p>Next day my Third Division came into the line on the north. I
divided my frontage equally between the three Divisions, placing
each on a single Brigade front. This was, in fact, a repetition of
the order of battle which had carried us so successfully and
rapidly up to the Somme.</p>
<p>Each front line Brigade took up the r&ocirc;le of Advanced Guard
to its Division. The 11th Brigade led the Third Division; the 8th
Brigade led the Fifth Division, while the 97th Brigade covered the
32nd Imperial Division.</p>
<p>For the first time in the war I found an opportunity of
employing my Corps Cavalry (13th Australian Light Horse) on other
than their habitual duty of carrying despatches, or providing
mounted escorts to convoys of prisoners of war. Here at last was a
chance for bold mounted tactics, as the country was mainly open and
free of wire and trenches.</p>
<p>To each Division I therefore allotted a squadron of Light Horse
for vanguard duty, together with detachments of the Australian
Cyclist Battalion. These troops more than justified their
employment by bold, forward reconnaissance, and energetic pressure
upon the enemy rearguards.</p>
<p>So promising, indeed, was the prospect of the useful employment
of cavalry, that I prevailed upon the Army Commander to endeavour
to secure for my use a whole Cavalry Brigade. Brigadier-General
Neil Haig (cousin of the Field Marshal) was actually sent for and
placed under my orders. I duly arranged a plan of action with him,
but before the 1st Cavalry Brigade, stationed many miles away, had
completed its long march into my area, the situation had already
changed, and the employment of Cavalry on the Fourth Army front had
to be postponed until a much later date.</p>
<p>A juncture had arrived when it became imperative for me to
consider the possibility of affording some relief to the three line
Divisions; all of them had been fighting without respite since
August 27th. The troops were so tired from want of sleep and
physical strain that many of them could be seen by the roadside,
fast asleep. These three Divisions had almost reached the limits of
their endurance.</p>
<p>It was essential, however, that they should be called upon to
yield up the last particle of effort of which they were capable.
Every mile by which they could approach nearer to the Hindenburg
defences meant a saving of effort on the part of the fresh waiting
Divisions, whom I had earmarked for the first stage of our
contemplated assault upon that formidable system; a system which I
knew to be too deep to be overwhelmed in a single operation.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that I was compelled to disregard the
evident signs of overstrain which were brought to my notice by the
Divisional Generals and their Brigadiers, and which were patent to
my own observation of the condition of the troops. I arranged,
however, two measures of immediate relief, the first being to set a
definite limit of time for the further demands to be made upon the
line Divisions. This was fixed for September 10th. The second was
to issue orders that the rate of our further advance was to be
controlled by consideration for the well-being of our own troops,
and not by the rate of the enemy's retreat. If, in consequence, any
gap should eventuate, touch with the enemy was to be kept by the
mounted troops and cyclists.</p>
<p>The preliminary steps for effecting the reliefs thus promised
for September 10th were begun on September 5th. The Corps was, as
stated, on a three Division front. I had only two fit Divisions in
Corps Reserve (<i>i.e</i>., the First and Fourth), the Second
Division being not yet rested. My representations to the Army
Commander on this matter bore immediate fruit; for he placed under
my orders the Sixth (Imperial) Division one of the first seven
Divisions of the original Expeditionary Force). Before, however, I
could take advantage of this windfall, the constitution of the
Fourth Army underwent a vital alteration, of which more will be
told later.</p>
<p>The First and Fourth Divisions had been resting since August
26th. They had had time to reorganize their units, to reclothe and
refit their troops, to receive and absorb reinforcements, and to
fill vacancies among leaders. Staffs had been able to deal with a
mass of arrears. The men had enjoyed a pleasant holiday in the now
peaceful Somme Valley, far in rear, a holiday devoted to games and
aquatic sports. Horse and man, alike, were refreshed, and had been
inspired by the continued successes of the remainder of the
Corps.</p>
<p>They were however, by now, far in rear; and it was out of the
question to tax their restored energies by calling upon them to
march back to the battle zone. The Fourth Army, as always, extended
its sympathetic help; two motor bus convoys, each capable of
dealing with a Brigade group a day, were speedily materialized from
the resources of G.H.Q.</p>
<p>The completion of the moves of these two Divisions from the back
area to within easy marching distance of the battle front therefore
occupied three days. The use of mechanical transport for the
execution of troop movements has now entirely passed the
experimental stage, and in future wars, calculations of time and
space will be vitally affected, whenever an ample supply of lorries
or buses and suitable roads are available for the rapid
concentration or dispersal of large bodies of troops.</p>
<p>The Australian soldier is individually philosophic and stoical,
but in the mass he is sensitive to a degree; and he is intelligent
enough to realize how he is used or misused. It was the subject of
complaint among the troops during the earlier years of the war,
that while they were indulgently carried by lorries into the battle
at a time when they were fresh and fit, they were invariably left
to march long distances, out of the battle, when they were on the
verge of exhaustion. I therefore tried, whenever possible, to
provide tired troops with the means of transport to their rest
areas, a facility which was always highly appreciated by them.</p>
<p>By the time the First and Fourth Divisions had thus been
assembled in the forward areas, ready to relieve the Third and
Fifth Divisions, these latter, together with the 32nd Division, had
advanced our front approximately to the line
Vermand-Vendelles-Hesbecourt, carrying it to within three miles of
the front line of the Hindenburg defence system.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt, however, that the rate of our advance,
retarded as it had been for the reasons already explained, had
proceeded much more rapidly than suited the enemy.</p>
<p>A steady stream of prisoners kept pouring in, captured in twos
and threes, all along my front, by my energetic patrols. Numerous
machine guns were taken; and in the vicinity of Roisel, fully three
hundred transport vehicles and much engineering material were
captured, which the enemy had been compelled to abandon in
haste.</p>
<p>At this juncture the British High Command arrived at the
important decision to enlarge the Fourth Army, by adding another
Corps; doubtless contemplating the possibility of operations on a
large scale against the Hindenburg defences in the near future.</p>
<p>A new Corps Headquarters, the Ninth, was to be reconstituted
under Lieut.-General Braithwaite, and he was to become my neighbour
on my southern flank, interposed between me and the French.
Braithwaite had been Chief of Staff to Sir Ian Hamilton during the
Dardanelles Expedition, and I had seen much of him there. I was to
have the advantage, therefore, of having old Gallipoli comrades on
either flank, Braithwaite on the south, and Godley on the
north.</p>
<p>The immediate result of this decision, which came into effect
early on September 12th, was that the 32nd Division, which had been
under my orders for nearly four weeks, passed over to the Ninth
Corps. Lambert, his Staff and his Division had served me well and
efficiently, and I was sorry to lose them out of my Corps.</p>
<p>With the impending further shortening of my front, I had no
justification for pressing to be permitted to retain this Division.
On the contrary, my representations to General Rawlinson had always
been in favour of shortening my frontage to the effective battle
standard of August 8th, so that the Corps might at any time be in a
position to embark on a major operation, with its whole resources
in Artillery and Infantry concentrated, as on that occasion, upon a
relatively narrow objective. My greatly extended front, and the
direct control of the affairs of six separate Divisions, had been a
heavy burden, involving great and manifold responsibilities.</p>
<p>According to my promises to the remaining two line Divisions,
the Fifth and Third, these were duly relieved on September 10th by
the First and Fourth Divisions, the former on the north, the latter
on the south. Each Division had a frontage of about four thousand
yards, but this was to diminish rapidly, if the advance of the
Corps continued, by reason of the fact that my southern boundary
now became the Omignon River, whose course ran obliquely from the
north-east.</p>
<p>While all these changes in dispositions were being effected,
there was breathing time to give attention to a heavy mass of
arrears of work; for there could be no question of undertaking an
attack on the Hindenburg defences without most careful and
exhaustive preparation.</p>
<p>For this the time was not yet ripe. It would still take some
days to bring forward the remainder of my heaviest Artillery, to
advance the railheads, to replenish the ammunition depots and
supply dumps, and to re-establish telegraph and telephone
communications.</p>
<p>Another good reason for a more leisurely policy on the front of
the Fourth Army lay in the events on other portions of the Allied
fronts. By September 4th the German withdrawal had become general
on all fronts.</p>
<p>It had become clear that the enemy's retirement to his former
position of March, 1918, was not to be confined to those fronts on
which he had been receiving such punishment. All evidence pointed
to the fact that his present strategy was to take up as speedily as
possible a strong defensive attitude, behind the great system of
field works, which had already served him so well during 1917, at a
time when a considerable proportion of his military resources was
still involved on the Russian and Roumanian fronts.</p>
<p>His retirement before the First and Third British Armies was
proceeding methodically, and on September 5th the French were
crossing the Vesle, between Rheims and Soissons. All was going
well; and those in the confidence of our High Command knew that, on
any day now, news might be expected of the first great attack to be
made by the American Army, to be directed against the St. Mihiel
Salient on the Alsace front.</p>
<p>This latter attack actually opened on September 11th, and it was
clearly sound military policy to wait for a few days, in order
correctly to diagnose the effect of these operations upon the
enemy's distribution of forces.</p>
<p>Information as to the locations and movements of all the enemy
Divisions was in these days voluminous, accurate and speedy.
Prisoners and documents were daily falling into the hands of the
Allies over the whole length of the Western Front. His Divisions in
the front line were identified daily by actual contact. As to those
resting or refitting or in reserve, accurate deductions could be
made from the mass of information at our disposal.</p>
<p>It was at this time that it began to be made clear to us that
the enemy's mobile reserves had been almost completely absorbed
into the front line. One Division after another, particularly among
those which had been engaged against the Australian Corps in
August, was being disbanded. Among these were the 109th, 225th,
233rd, 54th Reserve, and 14th Bavarian Divisions.</p>
<p>The strength of the enemy's remaining Divisions was also rapidly
diminishing. From prisoners we learned that many Battalions now had
only three Companies instead of four, many Regiments only two
Battalions instead of three, and even the Company strengths were at
a low ebb.</p>
<p>We could well afford to approach the immediate future with
greater deliberation.</p>
<p>Since August 8th, the Corps front had already advanced
twenty-five miles, and it was not long before I had to abandon the
luxurious ch&acirc;teau of the Marquis de Clermont-Tonnere, at
Bertangles, whose spacious halls and spreading parks had formed so
pleasant a habitation for the whole of my Corps Headquarters.</p>
<p>The scale of comfort possible for all senior Commanders and
Staffs rapidly declined as the advance developed. Generals of
Corps, Divisions and Brigades had to be content with living and
office quarters in a steadily descending gradation of convenience.
From ch&acirc;teau to humbler dwelling house, and thence into bare
wooden huts, and later still into mere holes hollowed out in the
sides of quarries or railway cuttings, were the stages of progress
in this downward scale.</p>
<p>My Headquarters moved from Bertangles to a group of village
houses at Glisy on August 13th; thence on August 31st to
M&eacute;ricourt, where the best had to be made of a derelict, much
battered and almost roofless ch&acirc;teau, which the Germans had
rifled of every stick of furniture, and even of all doors and
windows, in order to equip a large collection of dug-outs in a
neighbouring hill-side.</p>
<p>Again on September 8th I moved into the very centre of the
devastated area lying in the Somme bend, on to a small rise near
Assevillers, where a number of tiny wooden huts served us as
bedrooms by night and offices by day. Only one hut, more
pretentiously brick-walled and evidently built for the use of some
German officer of high rank, was available to fulfil the duties of
hospitality.</p>
<p>In spite of such discomforts, the daily life at Corps
Headquarters flowed on uninterruptedly in its several quite
distinct activities. On the one hand, there was the grim business
of fighting, the detailed conduct of the battle of to-day, the
troop and artillery movements for that of to-morrow, the planning
of the one to be undertaken still later; rounds of conferences and
consultations; visits to Divisions and Brigades, and to Artillery;
reconnaissances to the forward zone; and an intent and ceaseless
study of maps and Intelligence summaries.</p>
<p>Hourly contact with Headquarters of Fourth Army and of flank
Corps had to be maintained. Then, following the day's strenuous
activities out of doors, there was at nights a never-diminishing
mass of administrative work, disciplinary questions, honours,
awards, appointments, promotions, and a formidable correspondence
which must not be allowed to fall into arrear.</p>
<p>Again, in the back areas there were the unemployed Divisions of
the Corps, who must be regularly visited, both at training and at
play. There were medals and ribbons to be distributed to the
gallant winners; addresses to be delivered; and the work of
reorganizing and refitting the resting units to be supervised.
Still further in rear, demonstrations of new experiments in tactics
or in weapons, or in mechanical warfare, had frequently to be
attended, for study and criticism.</p>
<p>And lastly there was the social life of the Corps; for its
performances were beginning to attract attention beyond the
limited, if select, circles of the Fourth Army. A steady stream of
visitors began to set in. It was a necessary burden that suitable
arrangements for their reception and entertainment had to be
maintained.</p>
<p>The duties of hospitality had been simple at a time when Corps
Headquarters was still housed in palatial ch&acirc;teaux, situated
in country hitherto untouched by the war, and within easy reach of
all supplies. It was a very different matter to offer even
reasonable comfort to a visitor at a time when Government rations
constituted the backbone of our fare, when there were only bare
floors to sleep upon for those who were not fortunate enough to
possess a camp bed or valise, and when even an extra blanket or
pillow or towel was at a premium.</p>
<p>Yet we were always most glad to see visitors, and those of them
who were soldiers had, of course, a full understanding of our
limitations. It was not always so with others who, in the earlier
years of the war, when all Corps had a fixed location and had
achieved a high standard of domestic comfort, had been accustomed
to an adequate reception.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, our guests were indulgent, and understood that
the stress of current events placed a very strict limit upon the
amount of time that the members of my Staff or I could devote to
them.</p>

<small>F&mdash;Advances of Australian Corps, September 2nd to 17th,
1918<br>
[<i>click map to view larger image</i>]</small></p>
<br>
<p>Among many other distinguished men whom I had the honour to
receive were members of the War Cabinet, such as Lord Milner, then
Secretary of State for War, and Mr. Winston Churchill, the Minister
of Munitions; public men, such as Sir Horace Plunkett and Robert
Blatchford; eminent authors, such as Sir Conan Doyle, Sir Gilbert
Parker and Ian Hay; famous artists, such as Louis Raemakers, Street
on and Longstaff; celebrated journalists, like Viscount Burnham,
Thomas Marlowe and Cope Cornford; together with many
representatives of the Royal Navy, and of the armies of our Allies,
and Attaches from all the Allied Embassies.</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshal Haig, was a frequent
caller, and never departed without leaving a stimulating impression
of his placid, hopeful and undaunted personality, nor without a
generous recognition of the work which the Corps was doing.</p>
<p>General Birdwood, also, the former Corps Commander, who now
commanded the Fifth Army, paid several visits to the Corps,
travelling long distances in order to speak a few encouraging words
to the Commanders and troops with whom he had formerly been so long
and so closely associated. He, too, was always a most welcome
visitor. Although since the previous May he had ceased to control
the fighting activities of the Corps, this did not lessen the
intense pride which he took in its daily successes.</p>
<p>Many of our civilian visitors thirsted for the noise and tumult
of battle, and were most keen to get under fire, even if only of
long-range artillery fire. This was a constant source of anxiety to
me, for it was an unwritten law that the responsibility of their
safe sojourn in the Corps area rested with me. More often than not
they had to be dissuaded from visiting the forward zone, and
induced to spend their available time in inspecting some of our
show spots in the rearward areas, such as the Calibration ranges,
or the Corps central telegraph station, or the Tank park, or even
the Prisoner of War Cages, and the numerous depots of captured guns
and war trophies.</p>
<p>The Corps prisoners' cage was always, throughout the period of
our active fighting, a scene both of great interest and much
activity. Although all prisoners of war had to be evacuated to the
rear usually within about twenty-four hours of their admission, and
every day a batch marched out under escort, yet the Corps cage
between July and October was never empty.</p>
<p>When early in July the stream of prisoners began to flow in, and
thereafter grew steadily stronger, my Intelligence Service, headed
by Major S.A. Hunn, rose thoroughly to the occasion. Among our
troops sufficient numbers of all ranks proficient in the German
language were speedily found. After a little training they learned
to deal expeditiously with the lengthy searchings and
interrogations which followed the arrival of all new-comers.</p>
<p>Documents of every description found upon prisoners excepting
their pay-books, were seized and examined. The German soldier is an
inveterate sender and recipient of picture postcards. It was
surprising how much information of an invaluable character could be
gleaned from a postcard. A date, a place name, the number of a Unit
or Regiment, the name of a Commander, reference to a train journey
or a fight, are often sufficient, when read by an expert in
relation to the context, to furnish definite information of the
whereabouts of a Division, or of the fact that it has been or is
about to be disbanded, or of its intended movement to some other
part of the front, or of the losses which it has suffered.</p>
<p>All these scraps of information, when compared with similar
items gathered on other fronts, soon enabled the whole story of all
movement that was going on behind the enemy's lines to be deduced
from day to day with wonderful completeness.</p>
<p>So, also, maps, sketches, copies of orders, or of battle
instructions, and the contents of note-books and of personal
diaries always repaid the closest scrutiny. Such study produced
results which, even if not of immediate value to me, were
nevertheless passed on to the Army, and by them broadly
promulgated, in daily summaries, for the benefit of all our other
Corps.</p>
<p>The oral interrogation of the prisoners, particularly of
officers, often produced results of first-class importance.
Information as to dispositions, intentions, new tactical methods or
new weapons frequently emerged from these inquiries. It was rare
that prisoners refused to talk, and rarer still for them to attempt
to mislead with false information. If they did attempt it, the
interrogating officer was usually sufficiently well-informed upon
the subject of inquiry to be able to detect the inconsistency.</p>
<p>As the prisoners were invariably examined separately, it was
never difficult to discriminate between the true, upon which the
majority of them were in agreement, and the false, upon which the
minority never agreed.</p>
<p>Should the prisoner prove uncommunicative or deceitful, then if
he were of sufficient education to make it worth while, the
Intelligence Officer had yet another method, besides direct
questioning, at his disposal.</p>
<p>For a certain number of our own men, who could speak German
fluently, and who had been carefully tutored in their r&ocirc;le,
were provided with enemy uniforms, and allowed to grow a
three-days' beard, so as to impersonate prisoners of war. These
men, so equipped, were called "pigeons". A pigeon would be
ostentatiously brought under escort into the prisoners' cage, and
would sojourn for a day or more in a compartment of it among the
specially selected genuine prisoners. He would indicate by a secret
sign the time when he should himself be led to the Intelligence
Office for interrogation. It was seldom that he came away
empty-handed.</p>
<p>The demeanour of our captives, on reaching the cages, varied
widely, according to the stress which they had undergone. Some wore
an air of abject misery, and were thoroughly cowed and subservient.
Others were defiant, sulky and even arrogant.</p>
<p>Our treatment of them was firm, but humane. Physically, they had
nothing to complain of; they were fed and quartered on the same
standard as our own men. But they were given to understand from the
very outset that we would stand no nonsense, and that they must do
exactly what they were told. Few of them ever gave us any real
trouble.</p>
<p>The subsequent employment of prisoners of war did not come under
my jurisdiction, and it was seldom that any prisoner working
parties were available to me. My Corps area rarely extended
sufficiently far back from the front line to carry it beyond the
zone in which, by agreement between the belligerents, the
employment of prisoners of war was forbidden.</p>
<p>Australian soldiers are nothing if not sportsmen, and no case
ever came under my notice of brutality or inhumanity to prisoners.
Upon the contrary, when once a man's surrender had been accepted,
and he had been fully disarmed, he was treated with marked
kindness. The front line troops were always ready to share their
water and rations with their prisoners, and cigarettes were
distributed with a liberal hand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the souvenir-hunting instinct of the
Australian led him to help himself freely to such mementos as our
orders had not forbidden him to touch. Prisoners rarely got as far
as the Corps cage with a full outfit of regimental buttons,
cockades, shoulder-straps, or other accoutrements. Personal
trinkets, pay-books, money and other individual belongings were,
however, invariably respected; unless, as often happened, the
prisoners themselves were anxious to trade them away to their
captors, or escorts, for tobacco, chocolates, or other
luxuries.</p>
<p>Before I leave the subject of prisoners I should mention my
impression of the German officers, particularly of those who were
more senior in rank. Whenever a Regimental or Battalion Commander
was captured, and time permitted, he was brought before me for a
further interrogation. It was an experience which was almost
universal that such officers were willing to give me little
information which might injure their cause; on the other hand, they
exhibited an altogether exaggerated air of wounded pride at their
capture, and at the defeat of the troops whom they had
commanded.</p>
<p>It was that feeling of professional pique which dominated their
whole demeanour. They were always volubly full of excuses, the
weather, the fog, the poor <i>moral</i> of their own men, the
unexpectedness of our attack, the Tanks, errors in their
maps&mdash;anything at all but a frank admission of their own
military inferiority.</p>
<p>There were two amusing exceptions to this experience. The day
after the fighting for P&eacute;ronne, when a large batch of the
prisoners then taken was being got ready to march out of the Corps
cage, officers in one enclosure, other ranks in another, the senior
German officer, a Regimental Commander, formally requested
permission to address some eighty other officers present in the
cage. This request was granted.</p>
<p>He told them that they had fought a good fight, that their
capture was not to their discredit, and that he would report
favourably upon them to his superiors at the first opportunity. He
then went on to say that on his own and on their behalf he desired
to tender to the Australians an expression of his admiration for
their prowess, and to make a frank acknowledgment to, them that he
fully recognized that on this occasion his garrison had been
outclassed, out-man&oelig;uvred, and out-fought. The whole assembly
expressed their acquiescence in these observations by collectively
bowing gravely to the small group of my Intelligence Officers who
were amused spectators of the scene.</p>
<p>On another occasion&mdash;it was just after the battle of
September 18th&mdash;I was asking a German Battalion Commander
whether he could explain why it was that his men had that day
surrendered in such large numbers without much show of resistance.
"Well, you see", said he, with a twinkle in his eye, "they are
dreadfully afraid of the Australians. So they are of the Tanks. But
when they saw both of them coming at them <i>together</i>, they
thought it was high time to throw up their hands."</p>
<p>But this story is slightly anticipatory. The short
breathing-space which had been afforded by our more leisurely
advance towards the Hindenburg system was over. By September 12th I
was once again immersed in all the perplexities of shaping means to
ends. I had to decide, in collaboration with the Army Staff and the
Corps on my flanks, first, the extent of the resources which would
be required, and second, the successive stages which would offer
promise of success in overthrowing the last great defensive system
of all those which the enemy had created upon the tortured soil of
France.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<h4>HARGICOURT</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> great Hindenburg system, by which name it has
come to be known to English readers, or the "Siegfried Line", as it
is called by the Germans, was brought into existence during the
winter of 1916 and early spring of 1917 in order to fulfil a very
definite strategic purpose. This was to put into effect, on a
stupendous scale, a very elementary principle of minor tactics,
namely, that field works are constructed for the purpose of
reducing the number of men required to defend a given front or
locality.</p>
<p>In themselves, field fortifications have, of course, no
offensive value whatever, but their use permits a reduced number of
men to defend one place, in order that a greater number of men may
be available to attack another place.</p>
<p>The German High Command proceeded to make use of this principle
on a scale previously unknown in history. The whole of the Western
front, in Belgium and France, was to be held defensively throughout
1917. The military resources required to defend that front were to
be reduced to a minimum, by the provision of a line of defences
protected by powerful field works, believed to be impregnable. This
would liberate the greatest possible resources for the Eastern
front, where an end could be made of the Russians and Roumanians
there. As soon as these were disposed of, those troops, guns and
aeroplanes could again be transferred to the West, in order
similarly to dispose of the remainder of our Alliance.</p>
<p>This great strategic plan was carried out in its entirety until
the middle of 1918. It was the great Hindenburg line which had been
the kernel of the whole conception, and, until the days which we
are now approaching, it had remained, practically over its whole
length, an impregnable barrier against the assaults of the French
and British.</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that the very basis which justified the
expenditure of such enormous labour on the creation of these
defences was the saving in man-power. It is an accepted principle
of tactics that in any given battle the advantage always rests
heavily on the side of the defence. Where numbers, resources and
<i>moral</i> are equal, no attack can hope to succeed.</p>
<p>If, in the teachings before the war, it was correct to say that
a Commander should hesitate to attack unless he had a preponderance
of men and guns of at least two to one, such a dictum assuredly did
not take into account field defences of the permanent and elaborate
character of the Hindenburg Line. I should hardly venture to fix a
ratio of relative strength appropriate in such circumstances.</p>
<p>But this much is clear. The Germans had once already relied
successfully upon the impregnability of this great work. They had
every justification for believing that it would once again serve
them to keep us at bay for just a few weeks longer. Winter was very
near, and the Entente peoples might not have been able to hold
together to face another year of war.</p>
<p>We, on our part also, had as much justification for the resolve
that every sacrifice must be made to overthrow these defences
before the end of 1918, and for believing that it would require a
great, concerted and intense effort to succeed in this.</p>
<p>It is quite necessary, for a due appreciation of the magnitude
of the effort which was actually made, and of the wonderful success
with which it was rewarded, that the nature of the defences of the
Hindenburg Line should be clearly understood. This can best be
done, I think, by making an endeavour to realize the sense of
security which the possession of such a line of defence must have
afforded to the enemy. We are here interested only in that portion
of the line which extends from St. Quentin northwards towards
Cambrai.</p>
<p>Between these two cities the country is higher than that
adjoining it on the north and the south. It forms, therefore, a
watershed, dividing the basin of, the Somme from that of the
Scheldt. Early in the nineteenth century, Napoleon realized the
ambitious project of connecting these two river systems by a great
Canal scheme, cutting right through this high country from south to
north.</p>
<p>The canal is called, in its southern reaches, Canal de St.
Quentin. Before Cambrai is reached it merges into the Canal de
l'Escaut. Throughout the whole of that portion which concerns us,
it runs in a deep cutting, reaching, for great stretches, a depth
of 50 to 60 feet. In certain places where the ground rises still
higher, the canal passes through in great tunnels. The
southernmost, or Le Tronquoy Tunnel, near St. Quentin, is but
short; the northern boasts of the imposing length of 6,000 yards,
and extends from Bellicourt,* at its southern portal, to Le Catelet
at its northern one. From that point northwards the canal flows in
"open cut" which gradually becomes shallower as Cambrai is
approached.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Map H.]</p>
<p>The canal excavation&mdash;except where the tunnels
occur&mdash;itself affords an excellent military obstacle, the
passage of which could be stoutly contested by resolute troops well
dug in on its eastern banks, for the descent and ascent of the
slopes could be obstructed by wire entanglements, and swept with
fire. The water alone, which is too deep to be waded, would
seriously impede infantry, while the passage of tanks, guns and
vehicles would be impossible once the few high level bridges over
the canal had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Such an obstacle would not, however, of itself fulfil the
requirements of modern war, with its searching and destructive
Artillery fire. It was to be regarded more as the foundation upon
which a complete system of defences could be built, and as a last
line of resistance <i>&agrave; outrance</i>.</p>
<p>The canal had been, naturally, located by its engineers, in the
lowest ground available, so that its course closely follows the
lines of the minor valleys and depressions of the ground. On both
sides, therefore, the canal is flanked by somewhat higher ground,
from which its immediate banks can be overlooked. On the western
side particularly, there is a regular line of such higher plateaux
on which the villages of Villeret, Hargicourt and Ronssoy once
stood.</p>
<p>It was clearly desirable both to deprive a besieger of such
vantage ground, and also to provide the canal defences with a stout
outpost defence. For these reasons, the Germans had constructed an
elaborate system of trenches on a line generally parallel to and on
the average a full mile west of the canal. These trenches had been
perfected with dug-outs, concrete machine gun and mortar
emplacements, and underground shelters. They were protected by belt
after belt of barbed wire entanglements, in a fashion which no one
understood better, or achieved more thoroughly, than the
Germans.</p>
<p>But much more remained. Deep communication trenches led back to
the canal banks, in the sides of which tier upon tier of
comfortable living quarters for the troops had been tunnelled out.
Here support and reserve troops could live in safety and defy our
heaviest bombardments. They could be secretly hurried to the front
trenches whenever danger threatened.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, a perfect tangle of underground shelters and
passages. Roomy dug-outs were provided with tunnelled ways which
led to cunningly hidden machine-gun posts, and the best of care was
taken to provide numerous exits, so that the occupants should not
be imprisoned by the blocking of one or other of them by our
bombardment. But it was the barbed wire which formed the groundwork
of the defence. It was everywhere, and ran in all directions,
cleverly disposed so as to herd the attackers into the very jaws of
the machine guns.</p>
<p>The stretch of 6,000 yards of the canal which had been tunnelled
was, however, both a hindrance and a benefit to the perfection of
the scheme. On the one hand, the advantage of the open cut, as a
last obstacle, was lost. Its place had to be taken by a second
complete system of trench and wire defences, roughly following the
line of the tunnel, but of course far above the latter. On the
other hand, the tunnel itself afforded secure living accommodation
for a substantial garrison.</p>
<p>The Germans had collected large numbers of canal barges, and had
towed them into the interior of the tunnel, mooring them end to
end. They served as living quarters and as depots for stores and
munitions. It was no great business to provide electric lighting
for the tunnel. Indeed, the leads for this purpose had been in
existence before the war. Here, again, underground shafts and ways
were cut to enable the troops rapidly to man the trenches and
machine guns, and as rapidly to seek a safe asylum from the
heaviest shell fire.</p>
<p>The whole scheme produced, in fact, a veritable
fortress&mdash;not one, in the popular acceptation of the term,
consisting of massive walls and battlements, which, as was proved
in the early days of the war at Li&eacute;ge and Namur, can
speedily be blown to pieces by modern heavy artillery&mdash;but one
defying destruction by any powers of gunnery, and presenting the
most formidable difficulties to the bravest of Infantry.</p>
<p>Even this was not all. On the east side of the St. Quentin Canal
and parallel to it were built still two further trench lines, both
fully protected by wire entanglements, and capable of determined
defence. The first of these is the Le Catelet line, about one mile
distant from the canal. It skirts and embraces the villages of
Nauroy and Le Catelet, while two miles still further east is the
Beaurevoir line, the last or most easterly of all the prepared
defences which the Germans had in France.</p>
<p>Neither of these latter trench systems was nearly so formidably
prepared as the main systems previously described, but together
with them they go to make up the whole Hindenburg defensive system.
In this region that system runs generally due north and south, with
many minor convolutions in its line. It is altogether some
4&frac12; miles across from west to east.</p>
<p>As its overthrow could not be attempted in a single operation,
it is necessary for clearness of description to give definite names
to each of the successive lines of trenches which go to form the
whole defence system. Taking them in the order in which we attacked
them, from west to east, they will be referred to as:</p>

<small>20.&mdash;Battle of August 8th, 1918&mdash;German prisoners
being brought out of the battle under the fire of their own
Artillery</small></p>
<br>
<p>During the winter of 1917-1918 the British Fifth Army and the
Germans had faced each other in this region for many months. On our
side, also, a system of field defences had been developed. They
fell far short, indeed, of the completeness and ingenuity of the
German works, because the latter had been constructed at leisure,
long before, while ours had been built under the very fire of the
German guns.</p>
<p>For months the opposing Artilleries had pounded the country to
pieces, effaced every sign of civilization, and churned up the
ground in all directions over a belt some three miles wide. Heaps
of broken bricks marked the sites of once prosperous villages.
Broken telegraph poles, charred tree trunks, twisted rails, a chaos
of mangled machinery, were the only remains of what had once been
gardens, orchards, railways and factories. The whole territory
presented the aspect of a rolling, tumbled desert from which life
itself had been banished.</p>
<p>This was the region whose western verge the vanguard of the
Australian advance approached on September 11th, on a frontage of
about 8,000 yards, the northern extremity directed on Bellicourt,
the southern on Bellenglise. That is to say, if our further advance
had but continued unimpeded in the same due easterly direction, it
would have brought us square upon the open excavation of the canal,
and just clear and to the south of the Bellicourt-Le Catelet
tunnel. Some significance attached to this circumstance, as will
later appear.</p>
<p>Now, some little time before, an event of peculiar interest had
occurred. This was the capture, on another front, of a very
ordinary-looking transport vehicle loaded high with miscellaneous
baggage. Little escaped the inquisitive eyes of the British
Intelligence Service, which speedily discovered that among this
baggage there safely reposed a large collection of maps and
documents. On examination these proved to be nothing less than the
complete Defence Scheme of the whole "Siegfried" system, in that
very sector which now lay before the Australian Corps.</p>
<p>These papers were carefully overhauled and arranged. There were
dozens of accurately drawn detailed maps, and minute descriptions
of every tactical feature of the defences. The position of every
gun emplacement was given; every searchlight, machine-gun pit,
observation post, telephone exchange, command station and mortar
emplacement was clearly marked; the topographical and tactical
features of the ground were discussed in minute detail, and plans
for the action of every individual unit of the garrisons were fully
displayed.</p>
<p>Naturally, an army of translators and copying clerks was set to
work upon this precious find, and my Intelligence Service was kept
busy for many days in making for me digests of those items likely
to prove of special interest. It had, of course, to be remembered
that the Defence Scheme had been brought into operation for the
campaign of 1917, and it remained to be seen to what extent it
might by now have become obsolete.</p>
<p>It was hardly to be expected that the enemy would adhere to it
in its entirety, especially if he were aware, as I was bound to
assume that he was, that all this information had fallen into our
hands. But the Scheme contained a full exposition of many important
topographical facts which it was in any case beyond his power to
alter, and which it was of priceless value for me to know.</p>
<p>Although I had to devote hour upon hour to a concentrated study
of these papers, it proved to be in greater part labour in vain so
far as the Australian Corps was concerned, because it ultimately
came about that although I did carry out the attack upon the
Hindenburg outpost line in my present sector, the attack upon the
Hindenburg main line, which I was, later, called upon to make, took
place in the next adjoining sector to the north, <i>i.e</i>., the
Bellicourt tunnel sector, to which these captured documents only
incidentally referred. Nevertheless, the Ninth Corps, under
Braithwaite, ultimately got the full benefit of these
discoveries.</p>
<p>The production of these documents on September 10th formed the
starting point of the discussions which were now initiated in the
Fourth Army upon the question of the series of operations necessary
to overthrow the Hindenburg defences. General Rawlinson, on
September 13th, asked his three Corps Commanders (Butler, now
restored to health and back at duty, Braithwaite and myself) to
meet him at my newly-installed hutted camp at Assevillers. There,
quite informally, over a cup of afternoon tea, the great series of
operations took birth which so directly helped to finish the
war.</p>
<p>It was decided that the operation must necessarily be divided
into two main phases&mdash;separated in point of time by an
interval of several days for further preparation. All of us
recognized the impossibility of overrunning, in a single day, so
deep and formidable a system of defences, in such tortured country,
and in weather which was already becoming unsettled.</p>
<p>The first phase was to be an attempt to capture the Hindenburg
outpost line, along the whole Army front. The French and the Third
British Armies were to be asked to make a synchronized attack on
the same objective. The three Corps of the Fourth Army were to
attack upon the frontages and in the sectors on which they then
stood. The date was left undecided, but all were to be ready at
three days' notice.</p>
<p>One important consideration was the meagre supply of Tanks
available. The operations of August had been costly, not to say
extravagant, in Tanks, and General Elles' repair workshops, manned
largely by very competent Chinese coolie mechanics, had been
working night and day ever since to repair the minor damages, and
new Tanks were steadily arriving from England to replace those
damaged beyond repair. But no large contingent of Tanks was to be
expected until towards the end of the month. The upshot was that I
was to be content with only eight Tanks for use in the contemplated
operation.</p>
<p>Late the same afternoon I communicated to Generals Maclagan and
Glasgow an outline of the probable r&ocirc;le of their respective
Divisions in the very near future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the front-line troops had not been idle. My
orders were that the First and Fourth Divisions were to carry the
line forward as far as possible towards the Hindenburg outpost
line, without committing the Corps to an organized attack. They
were to operate by vigorous patrol action against enemy points of
resistance, for the enemy had evidently no intention of quietly
giving up the ground which lay between us and the Hindenburg
outpost line. On the contrary, he had posted strong rearguards on
every point of tactical value, and did his best to keep us as long
as possible at arm's length, and beyond striking distance of his
first great line of defence.</p>
<p>These orders were entirely to the taste of the two Divisions now
in the line. The First Division had served its apprenticeship to
that very kind of fighting in the Merris area in the previous
spring, and the Fourth Division did not mean to be a second best.
Each Division stood on a one-Brigade front, being ordered to keep
its other two Brigades well out of harm's way and resting, for any
great effort that might be required.</p>
<p>The next few days witnessed some daring exploits on the part of
the 13th Brigade of the Fourth Division and the 2nd Brigade of the
First Division in the capture of tactical points, and in the bloody
repulse of all attempts by the enemy to recapture them. In this way
our line was carried up to and a little beyond what had been the
old British reserve line of trenches of March, 1918, which lay
within 5,000 yards of the final objective of the first phase of the
contemplated operations.</p>
<p>On September 16th I called together the whole of the Commanders
who were to participate in the next great battle, Maclagan (Fourth
Division), Glasgow (First Division), Courage (Tanks), Chamier (Air
Force), Fraser (Heavy Artillery), and the four Generals of my own
Staff. The conference took place in a Y.M.C.A. marquee erected near
Maclagan's Headquarters, and I was able to announce that the date
had been fixed for September 18th.</p>
<p>The contemplated battle presented only a few novel features. The
methods of the Corps were becoming stereotyped, and by this time we
all began to understand each other so well that most of what I had
to say could almost be taken for granted. Each Commander was ready
to anticipate the action that would be required of him, almost as
soon as I had unfolded the general plan.</p>
<p>The shortage of Tanks was a source of much anxiety to me. I felt
that it would mean a heavier risk to the Infantry, and the
contemplation of losses among our splendid men, which might be
lessened by the more liberal use of mechanical aids, always sorely
troubled me. I endeavoured to meet the situation by adopting two
unusual expedients.</p>
<p>The first was to <i>double</i> the machine-gun resources of the
two battle Divisions. This was effected by bringing up the complete
machine-gun battalions of the Third and Fifth Divisions, and adding
them to those of the line Divisions. This gave me a total of 256
Vickers Machine Guns on a frontage now reduced to 7,000 yards. It
enabled me to deliver so dense a machine-gun barrage, advancing 300
yards ahead of the infantry, that to quote the words of a German
Battalion Commander who was captured on September 18th: "The
small-arms fire was absolutely too terrible for words. There was
nothing to be done but to crouch down in our trenches and wait for
you to come and take us."</p>
<p>The other expedient was amusing, although no less effective.
This was to make up for the shortage of real Tanks by fabricating a
number of dummy ones. As soon as the word went round Engineers and
Pioneers vied with each other in rapid "Tank" manufacture. Dumps
and stores were clandestinely robbed of hessian, paint, wire nails,
and battens, and some weird monstrosities were produced. The best
and most plausible of them were selected, and actually used on the
day of the battle. Four men dragged out each dummy, before dawn,
into a position from which it was bound to be seen by the enemy and
there abandoned it. There is little doubt that this trick
contributed its share to the day's astonishing success.</p>
<p>Once again, also, I put into practice the principle of an
Artillery barrage plan reduced to the utmost simplicity. This, as
already described, consisted in having the line, on which were to
fall the shells from the whole of the barrage guns employed,
perfectly straight across the whole front, so as to avoid all
complexities in fire direction.</p>
<p>The first line on which the barrage fell was called the
Artillery "Start Line", and from such a line the barrage advanced,
by regular leaps or "lifts" of 100 yards at a time, in perfectly
parallel lines, until the final objective was reached. Now,
experience had shown that such a start line for the Artillery
should be at least 200 yards in advance of the line on which the
Infantry were to form up ready for the assault. A liberal margin of
space had to be allowed, in order to minimize the risks to our own
Infantry.</p>
<p>The Artillery "Start Line" was defined on our fighting maps. The
guns were laid upon it by methods which depended upon accurate
surveys, on the ground, of the exact position of every gun. When
that had been determined, the map and compass helped to decide the
range and alignment upon which the gun should open fire.</p>
<p>On the map, also, was drawn another line 200 yards short of, or
on our side of the Artillery "Start Line", and this was called the
Infantry "Start Line". It then became necessary to determine, upon
the actual ground, the position of this Infantry Start Line, and to
mark it in such a way that the Infantry would be enabled to take up
their correct positions. This would ensure that the Infantry would
know that the fall of our opening barrage would be 200 yards in
advance of the line so marked.</p>
<p>This delicate work of marking out of the Infantry Start Line on
the ground was invariably entrusted to the Engineers attached to
the Brigades co-operating in the attack. The marking was done by
laying out and pegging down broad tapes of white linen, which could
be recognized in the dim light of early dawn. The whole work, had,
of course, to be done unobserved by the enemy, and it was always a
dangerous task.</p>
<p>Only the fact that we were in possession of reliable large scale
maps, recording every feature of the ground, made it possible for
the Engineers, resourceful as they were, to do this delicate work
with reasonable accuracy. The battered condition of the country was
always a difficulty; for it was never easy to recognize, on the
ground, reference points, such as a road intersection, or the
corner of a field, or a crucifix or similar land mark, which might
aid the surveyors in getting their bearings.</p>

<br>
<p>The Infantry Start Line had, naturally, to be located so that
the ground upon which the tapes were to be pegged down was ground
which was already within our possession, or accessible to us
without coming dangerously near the enemy. It was a necessary
consequence that portions of our always irregular front line of
posts or trenches would lie beyond or on the enemy's side of the
tape line.</p>
<p>It was always a rule of our practice, therefore, that any
Infantry posted in advance of the taped line should be withdrawn,
behind the tapes, an hour before the time of Zero. It was also
customary to order that all assaulting troops should be spread, in
their appropriate dispositions, along the tape line, also one hour
before Zero.</p>
<p>The result of these arrangements was that for the last hour
before the actual opening of the battle, all Infantry intended to
take part in the assault was deployed along the tapes in a
perfectly straight line, all along the battle front, while no
troops previously in occupation of posts or trenches in advance of
the tapes were left out in front, exposed to the risk of either
being hit by our own Artillery, or mistaken, in the half light of
dawn, for enemies by our own Infantry.</p>
<p>Complex and difficult as these arrangements may appear from this
description, they worked out in actual practice with the utmost
smoothness. The resulting simplification of the Artillery plans, in
this as in similar previous battles, more than justified their
adoption.</p>
<p>A liberal use was also made of direction boards, which marked
the routes by which each separate body of assaulting Infantry
should, during the last night, march from its place of assembly to
the taped line or "jumping off" line, and also to mark the position
which it was to take up upon that line. Each board had painted upon
it the name of the unit to which it referred. Such preparatory
measures, troublesome as they were, greatly reduced the risk of any
confusion or mistake, and lessened the fatigue of the assaulting
troops.</p>
<p>The moon would set, on the morning of the battle, at 3.37 a.m.,
and the sun would rise at 6.27 a.m. Zero hour, for the opening of
the attack, was therefore fixed for twenty minutes past five.</p>
<p>Operations began inauspiciously. A soaking rain set in some two
hours before, and made movement over the broken, clayey surface
anything but pleasant. Although the troops were soon drenched to
the skin, this did not in any way damp their spirits. It probably
added much to the misery of the enemy, who could hardly fail to
realize that, on any morning, a fresh attack might break upon
him.</p>
<p>Modern war is in many ways unlike the wars of previous days, but
in nothing so much as in the employment of what I have more than
once referred to as "set-piece" operations. The term is one which
should convey its own meaning. It is the direct result of the great
extension, which this war has introduced, of mechanical warfare. It
is a "set-piece" because the stage is elaborately set, parts are
written for all the performers, and carefully rehearsed by many of
them. The whole performance is controlled by a time-table, and, so
long as all goes according to plan, there is no likelihood of
unexpected happenings, or of interesting developments.</p>
<p>The Artillery barrage advances from line to line, in regular
leaps, at regulated intervals of time, determined beforehand, and
incapable of alteration once the battle has begun. Should the rate
prove too slow and the Infantry could have advanced more quickly,
it cannot be helped, and no great harm is done. On the other hand,
if there be any risk of the barrage rate being too fast, one or two
halts of ten or fifteen minutes are often introduced into the
time-table to allow the infantry line, or any part of it which may
be hung up for any reason, to catch up.</p>
<p>Following the barrage, comes line upon line of infantry in
skirmishing order, together with the line of Tanks when such are
used. The foremost lines advance to capture and hold the ground,
the lines in rear to "mop up" and deal with the enemy either
showing fight or hiding underground, the rearmost lines collect
prisoners or our own wounded, or carry supplies, tools and
ammunition.</p>
<p>In a well-planned battle of this nature, fully organized,
powerfully covered by Artillery and Machine Gun barrages, given a
resolute Infantry and that the enemy's guns are kept successfully
silenced by our own counter-battery Artillery, nothing happens,
nothing can happen, except the regular progress of the advance
according to the plan arranged. The whole battle sweeps
relentlessly and methodically across the ground until it reaches
the line laid down as the final objective.</p>
<p>Such a set-piece battle lasts usually, from first to last, for
80 to 100 minutes; seldom for more. When the Artillery programme is
ended the battle is either completely won, or to all intents and
purposes completely lost. If the barrage for any reason gets away
from our Infantry, and they are relegated to hand to hand fighting
in order to complete their advance, the battle immediately assumes
a totally different character, and is no longer a set-piece
affair.</p>
<p>It will be obvious, therefore, that the more nearly such a
battle proceeds according to plan, the more free it is from any
incidents awakening any human interest. Only the externals and only
the large aspects of such battles can be successfully recorded. It
is for this reason that no stirring accounts exist of the more
intimate details of such great set-pieces as Messines, Vimy, Hamel
and many others. They will never be written, for there is no
material upon which to base them. The story of what did take place
on the day of battle would be a mere paraphrase of the battle
orders prescribing all that was to take place.</p>
<p>On the other hand battles such as the second phase of August
8th, the battle for Mont St. Quentin, and the later battles of Bony
and Beaurevoir were not set-piece operations. Therefore the
developments from hour to hour, and even from moment to moment, are
full of intense human interest, and replete with tales of
individual courage and initiative. Some day, when all the material
has been gathered, an abler pen than mine will write their
story.</p>
<p>If the reader will bear in mind all these considerations, with
special reference to the battle of Hargicourt on September 18th he
will realize that, in describing the dispositions, the objectives,
the time-table and the preparations for the battle, I have told
practically all that there is to tell of the course it took, except
only as regards the results actually achieved, in ground won and
prisoners taken.</p>
<p>It has been difficult, nevertheless, to refrain from dwelling in
detail upon the performances and experiences in battle of the
individual fighting men. Any attempt to do so would, however, prove
hopelessly inadequate. The numbers engaged were always so large,
their activities so varied, the conditions of each battle so
different in detail, that to do adequate justice and avoid unfair
discrimination would make impossible demands upon the space
available to me.</p>
<p>Popular interest naturally centres upon the Infantry, not only
because they are the most numerous, but also because they are
invariably in the forefront of the battle and often in immediate
contact with the enemy. Without the slightest disparagement to the
important r&ocirc;le of the Infantryman and to the valour which its
performance demands, it must never be forgotten that the work of
the Artillery, Engineers, Pioneers, Machine Gunners, Trench
Mortars, Air Service and Tanks is in every way equally important
and essential to the success of any battle operation. Yet it is
equally true that no battle can be won without the Infantry.</p>
<p>In a deliberately prepared battle it is not too much to say that
the r&ocirc;le of the Infantry is not, as a rule, the paramount
one, provided that all goes well and that there is no breakdown in
any part of the battle plan. That does not, however, imply that the
Infantry task makes no high demand upon courage and resolution. On
the contrary, these are the essentials upon which the success of
the Infantry r&ocirc;le and therefore of the whole battle
depends.</p>
<p>The primary duty of the Infantry, in an assault covered by an
Artillery barrage, is to follow up the barrage closely. The barrage
is nothing more nor less than a steady shower of shells, bursting
over the very heads of the leading lines of Infantry, and striking
the ground some 80 to 120 yards in front of them. This shower is
usually so dense that three to four shells per minute fall on every
twenty yards of frontage. It is so intense a fire that no enemy,
however courageous, could remain exposed to it. It falls on one
line for three or four minutes, while the Infantry lie down flat.
Suddenly, the barrage "lifts" or advances 100 yards. At a signal
from the platoon or company commander the whole line rises and
rushes at top speed to catch up to the barrage, again to throw
itself flat upon the ground.</p>
<p>So long as no enemy are encountered, these successive rushes may
go on without check for hundreds of yards. If during the course of
any rush, trenches or strong points are met with and they contain
enemy who do not immediately surrender, prompt use must be made of
rifle and bayonet. But it is the primary business of the leading
line of Infantry to push on and not to delay by engaging in close
combat. The second and third lines of Infantry are there to "mop
up", that is, to dispose, by destruction or capture, of any enemy
overrun or ignored by the leading line. Where Tanks co-operate that
is also their special business, and when it has been attended to
they go forward at top speed to rejoin the leading line.</p>
<p>In such a methodical way the advance continues until the final
objective is reached. This event can be recognized by the Infantry
in any of three ways, firstly by reference to the clock time; for
the arrival of the barrage at any line on the map or ground occurs
in pursuance of a definite time-table; secondly by the
topographical features, and thirdly by the expedient of maintaining
the barrage stationary at the final objective for fifteen to thirty
minutes. In some battles, I also adopted the device of firing from
every gun in the barrage, three rounds of smoke shell in rapid
succession, as a signal to the Commanders of the leading line of
Infantry to call the final halt, to select a good line for
trenches, and to dig-in rapidly, a process technically called
"consolidation".</p>
<p>It would be too much to hope that in an attack covering a front
of four or five miles, every part of the line should be able to
advance without any check whatever up to the final halting place.
But the expectation always is that by far the greater part of the
whole line will be able to do so. If, here and there along the
front, platoons or even whole companies were to be held up or
delayed by special difficulties or obstacles such as thickets, or
copses strongly manned by the enemy, or by belts of wire, or
village ruins, such breaks in the general line of advance would
matter but little to the success of the operations as a whole. The
gaps discovered in the leading line of Infantry, when it had come
to a halt at the final objective, would be speedily filled by
supporting troops from both flanks of the gap, and thereby the
enemy holding out further back, would be completely enveloped. His
surrender would follow as soon as he realized his position, and
that he had been cut off from any contact with his friends in his
rear.</p>
<p>Such is the normal course of the Infantry action in a pitched
battle. It makes great demands upon the iron resolution of the
Infantryman to push on vigorously against all obstacles, and to put
forth his utmost physical powers to keep up with the barrage,
especially when the ground is wet and sticky, or when uncut wire
has to be crawled through. All this he must do, utterly regardless
of the enemy fire which may be directed against him, whether from
Artillery or machine guns. His best hope of immunity is always to
make his rush rapidly and determinedly, and to get to ground
immediately that he reaches the halting place, close up to the
barrage, when signalled by his officer.</p>
<p>Very different from such a stereotyped procedure is the action
of the Infantry in any operation or any part of an operation which
partakes of the character of open warfare. The main tactical
purpose is still, as before, to advance to the seizure of an
appointed objective, but there is no barrage, no time-table, no
fixity of route, no prescribed formation or procedure. Everything
must be left to the judgment, initiative and enterprise of the
leader on the spot.</p>
<p>The tactical unit of Infantry is the platoon. The action of a
whole battalion is compounded merely of the separate actions of its
sixteen platoons, each performing the separate r&ocirc;le, in a
general plan, that may be laid down by the Battalion Commanders,
some to advance and fight, some to act in support, some to lie in
reserve, some to engage in a flank attack, others to fetch and
carry food, water and munitions.</p>
<p>The platoon is commanded by a Lieutenant and comprises four
sections, each under a Sergeant or Corporal. There are two sections
of riflemen, a Lewis gun section and a section of rifle grenadiers.
Each section may consist of from five to eight men. Let it be
supposed that it is the business of the platoon to capture a small
farmhouse which the enemy has fortified and in which he is holding
out. Always supposing that the enemy garrison is not of a strength
requiring more than one platoon for its capture the normal action
of the attacking platoon would be somewhat as follows. The Lewis
gun section would, from a concealed position, on one flank, keep
the place under steady fire. The rifle grenadiers from the same or
another flank would fire smoke grenades to make a smoke screen. One
section of riflemen would endeavour to sneak up depressions and
ditches or along hedges, so as to get well behind the farm and
threaten it by fire from the rear. The other section of riflemen
would choose some direct line of attack, over ground which offered
concealment to them until they were close enough to take the
objective with a rush.</p>
<p>Such in very bare outline is merely an imaginary example, but it
is sufficient to show the amount of skill, resource and energy
required on the part not only of the leader, but also of every man
in the platoon. The secret of success of the Australian open
fighting lay in the extraordinary vigour, judgment and team-work
which characterized the many hundreds of little platoon battles
which were fought on just such lines as I have tried to suggest in
this example.</p>
<p>It will be readily seen that no comprehensive description is
possible which would present an adequate picture of the widely
varying activities of the Australian Infantryman in this campaign.
There is only one source from which reliable narratives of
individual fighting can be gathered, and that source is so
voluminous that space forbids any but a meagre attempt to supply
extracts from it. I refer to the recommendations made by Commanders
for honours and rewards for individual acts of gallantry. A very
small selection of these has been made and is presented in an
appendix to this book.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Appendix B.]</p>
<p>But to return to my narrative of September 18th. On that day
each Division attacked on a frontage of two Brigades. No serious
opposition was encountered except at La Verguier, which was not far
from our start line. Nevertheless, the whole of the "red" line,
which was the objective of the "set-piece" phase of the day's
battle, was in our possession, throughout the whole length of the
Corps front, well before 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>This gave us complete possession of the old British front line
of March, 1918; but the Hindenburg outpost line yet lay before us,
still distant another 1,500 to 2,000 yards. This latter line was to
be the ultimate or exploitation objective of the day's operations,
and I could hardly have dared to hope that a trench system of such
considerable strength, which had defied the Fifth Army for so long,
would fall into our hands so easily as it did.</p>
<p>Glasgow's Division pushed on without pause, and before nightfall
had overwhelmed the garrison of the Hindenburg outpost line along
its front. Maclagan's Division also fought its way forward to
within 500 yards of that line. But the troops were by then very
exhausted; all movement was in full view of the enemy; and the
ground was very difficult. After a consultation with Maclagan I
decided to rest the troops, and to make an attempt to reach the
final objective (blue line) that same night.</p>
<p>Advantage was taken of this pause to advance the Artillery, so
that the enemy's defences could be thoroughly bombarded before the
final assault. At 11 o'clock the same night, the Fourth Division
again attacked, and after severe fighting also captured the whole
of the objective trench system.</p>
<p>It was a great victory. The Hindenburg outpost line had been
vanquished. From it we could now look down upon the St. Quentin
Canal, and sweep with fire the whole of the sloping ground which
lay between us and the Canal, denying the use of that ground to the
enemy, and making it impossible for him to withdraw the guns and
stores which littered the area.</p>
<p>The overwhelming nature of the success can best be realized by
the following almost incredible analysis of the material results of
the day's fighting. The First Division attacked with a total
strength of 2,854 Infantry. They suffered only 490 casualties
(killed and wounded). They captured 1,700 prisoners, apart from the
large numbers who were killed, and the wounded enemy who made good
their escape.</p>
<p>The Fourth Division had a total assaulting strength of 3,048 of
all ranks, of whom 532 became casualties. Their captures of live
prisoners amounted to 2,543.</p>
<p>In addition, the Corps gathered in upwards of 80 guns, which had
been overrun, and had to be abandoned by the enemy.</p>
<p>There is no record in this war of any previous success on such a
scale, won with so little loss.</p>
<p>The Corps on either flank of me had successes of varying
quality. The Ninth Corps on the south had reached the red line, but
the exploitation phase of the operation was not pressed until a
later day. The Third Corps, on my left, however, made indifferent
progress. Their line still bent back sharply from my left flank,
and none of the enemy's outpost system had been gained. This
portion of the Army front was that which lay square opposite the
Bellicourt tunnel, and the fact that in this part of the field the
Fourth Army had not yet mastered the Hindenburg outpost system was
to be fraught with very serious difficulties for me, not many days
later.</p>
<p>The general plan propounded by General Rawlinson on September
13th had been realized in part, although not in its entirety. The
successes gained on September 18th were nevertheless sufficiently
important and decisive to justify immediate preparations for
working out the plan for a great, combined and final effort to
sweep the enemy out of the remainder of the last lines of defence
which he had established in France.</p>
<p>The First and Fourth Australian Divisions had, however, as it
turned out, fought their last fight in the war. Their long and
brilliant fighting career, which had been opened three and a half
years before, the one on the cliffs of Gallipoli, and the other in
the desert of Egypt, thus ended in a blaze of glory. Although a
number of the officers and non-commissioned officers of both these
Divisions were called upon, very shortly after, to render one more
valuable service to the Australian Corps, the Divisions themselves
were destined, because of the termination of hostilities, not again
to make their appearance on any battle front. Their labours ended,
the troops were taken by motor bus and railway to a coastal
district lying to the south-west of Amiens, there to rest and
recuperate in the contemplation of a noble past devoted to the
service of the Empire.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<h4>AMERICA JOINS IN</h4>
<p>I <small>HAD</small> foreseen that the battle to be fought on
September 18th was the last in which the First and Fourth Divisions
could be called upon to participate during the remainder of the
1918 campaigning season. The wastage of their Battalions had gone
on faster than the inflow of fresh drafts, or the return of
convalescent sick and wounded. These two Divisions contained the
original sixteen Battalions who had immortalized themselves, in
1915, in the landing on Gallipoli. I was strongly averse from
disbanding any one of them to furnish drafts for the remainder. My
hope then was that, if these Divisions could be allowed to rest
over the winter, they could be sufficiently replenished by the
spring of 1919 to be able to maintain all sixteen Battalions at a
satisfactory fighting strength.</p>
<p>Of the remaining three Divisions, the Third and Fifth required
at least another week's rest; and I had promised the Second
Division that after their heroic efforts at Mont St. Quentin, they
would not be again called upon until towards the end of September.
I would thus be left with insufficient resources to maintain an
immediate continuance of the pressure upon the enemy.</p>
<p>On explaining the situation to General Rawlinson, he suggested
the interesting possibility of being able to obtain, very shortly,
the services of the Second American Corps of two Divisions, and
asked me whether I would be prepared to accept the responsibility
of taking this large force under my command for the continuance of
the operations.</p>
<p>I had no reason to hesitate. My experience of the quality of the
American troops, both at the battle of Hamel and on the Chipilly
spur, had been eminently satisfactory. It was true that this new
American Corps had no previous battle service, but measures were
possible to supply them with any technical guidance which they
might lack.</p>
<p>I therefore accepted the suggestion, and Rawlinson then asked me
to submit a proposal for a joint operation to take place towards
the end of the month by these two American and the remaining three
Australian Divisions, with the object of completing the task, so
well begun, of breaking through the Hindenburg defences. I was to
propose my objectives, to show how I intended to employ each of the
five Divisions, and also to set out my requirements in Artillery,
Tanks and other services.</p>
<p>It was anything but an easy task, and it had to be undertaken at
a time when the preparations for the battle of Hargicourt were
uppermost in my mind. Much time also had to be devoted to numerous
distinguished visitors.</p>
<p>The outcome was a letter to the Fourth Army which foreshadowed,
almost in its entirety, the battle plan which subsequently was
actually employed. The substance of this letter is here reproduced.
The text has been modified only by the omission of the reference
letters to a large coloured map which accompanied it:</p>
<br>
<p align="right">Corps
Headquarters,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

18th September, 1918.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Fourth Army</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">1. I beg to submit the outlines of a plan for a
series of operations for the capture of the Hindenburg Line in the
Sector Bellicourt-Vendhuille, based upon the expectation that two
American Divisions will be available immediately to supplement this
Corps.</p>
<p class="indent1">2. The resources of the Corps in Infantry, which
will be available, are exclusive of the First and Fourth Australian
Divisions, although the Artillery, Technical Troops and Machine Gun
Battalions of those Divisions will continue to be available.</p>
<p class="indent1">3. The plan is based upon the assumption that
the objective Blue Line of the operations of September 18th is in
our possession all along the Army Front, or can be seized in the
very near future.</p>
<p class="indent1">4. The accompanying Map shows the coloured lines
referred to in the following description, as also the reference
letters in blue.</p>
<p class="indent1">5. This plan is in outline only, and the various
objective lines and boundaries suggested are merely tentative, to
form the basis for a general plan.</p>
<p class="indent1">6. The Blue Line is the line of eventual
exploitation for the operations of September 18th.</p>
<p class="indent1">7. The present Corps front on the Blue Line
extends a distance of 6,000 yards. It is suggested, either that the
Corps front should be extended to a total frontage of 10,000 yards,
or that it should be side-slipped northwards to a frontage of 6,000
yards. The latter would obviously be preferable, so far as the
Corps is concerned, as enabling all its resources to be
concentrated upon a smaller frontage.</p>
<p class="indent1">8. The major outlines of the plan are as
follows:</p>
<p class="indent2">(a) An attack by two American Divisions for the
capture of the Green Line.</p>
<p class="indent2">(b) A subsequent attack by two Australian
Divisions for the capture of the Red Line.</p>
<p class="indent2">(c) Exploitation by the Cavalry from the Red
Line, in an Easterly and north-easterly direction.</p>
<p class="indent2">(d) A turning movement by the Ninth Corps,
through Bellicourt and Nauroy to turn the Canal defences, operating
from north to south&mdash;or alternatively.</p>
<p class="indent2">(e) A turning movement by the Third Corps,
operating through Le Catelet northwards.</p>
<p class="indent1">9. The details of the above plan will run on the
following lines:</p>
<p class="indent2">(a) The new Corps front to be taken over at the
earliest possible moment by two American Divisions, each Division
deploying for this purpose only one Regiment of one Brigade. This
will place in Line six Battalions on the Corps front, giving each
Battalion about 1,000 yards. These troops will hold the line
defensively, and will, with the assistance of technical troops,
prepare the battle front.</p>
<p class="indent2">(b) The battle troops of the two American
Divisions will thus comprise three Regiments or nine Battalions for
each Division. The allocation of objectives to these troops will be
as follows:</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) One Brigade (two Regiments) of the right
Division to advance 4,500 yards on a frontage of 3,000 yards. This
Brigade (six Battalions) would attack with four Battalions in Line
(750 yards frontage each) and two Battalions in support for
"mopping up" duties. Its principal objective, apart from the main
trench systems, is Bellicourt.</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) Similarly, one Brigade (two Regiments) of
the left Division, with similar dispositions. Its principal
objective, apart from the main trench systems, is Catelet.</p>
<p class="indent3">(iii) The odd Regiment of the right Division to
be responsible for forming the south defensive flank.</p>
<p class="indent3">(iv) The odd Regiment of the left Division to be
responsible for forming the north defensive flank.</p>
<p class="indent2">(c) It will be noted that the Green Line has
been drawn so as to include all ground giving good observation
northward, eastward and southwards, and to deny observation to the
enemy. It is probable that the Field Artillery barrage will not be
able to penetrate to the extreme limits of this proposed objective
along the whole battle front without moving forward some of the
batteries, particularly in the Northern Divisional Sector. This
will probably necessitate a halt of an hour or an hour and a half,
to enable Artillery to be advanced.</p>
<p class="indent2">(d) Assuming that the battle opens about 6 a.m.,
the Green Line should be reached by 10 a.m. or earlier. By
mobilizing ample resources in technical troops, both American and
Australian, and ample tools and engineering material, it should be
easily possible to construct not less than four roads, sufficiently
developed for horse transport, from the Blue Line to the Green
Line, by 2 p.m. These roads would be located so as to make use of
existing roads, and trench crossings would be made by filling in
with earth and not by bridging. It is estimated, therefore, that
Mobile Artillery could move forward not later than 2 p.m. on Zero
day.</p>
<p class="indent2">(e) The Australian Infantry of two Divisions
would move at such an hour as would enable them to reach and be
deployed upon the Green Line by 2 p.m., shortly after which hour
they would be joined by the necessary Mobile Artillery. This phase
of the operation would also involve the capture of the Beaurevoir
Line. It is assumed that Tanks would be available to deal with the
crossing of the wire entanglements covering this line.</p>
<p class="indent2">(f) The completion of the defensive flanks would
be allocated to American troops.</p>
<p class="indent2">(g) As soon as the Australian Infantry had
passed the Green Line, the four American Regiments who had
participated in the capture of the Green Line, would be
concentrated, refitted and rested for operations eastwards.</p>
<p class="indent1">10. The following considerations should be kept
in view, in connection with this plan.</p>
<p class="indent2">(a) There should be sufficient Field Artillery,
not merely to provide an effective barrage for the time-table
advance to the Green Line and its flanks, but also, in addition,
sufficient Mobile Field Artillery, not employed in the barrage, to
enable the Australian Infantry to be provided with at least six
Artillery Brigades for the exploitation phase of the operation.</p>
<p class="indent2">(b) There should be at least 60 Tanks available
for the first phase, in order absolutely to guarantee the breaching
of the main Hindenburg trench systems. There should, in addition,
be available not less than 30 Tanks to assist the Australian
Infantry through the Beaurevoir Line.</p>
<p class="indent1">11. There should be a systematic destructive
bombardment of the whole of the Hindenburg trench system on the
battle front, lasting at least four days, in order not merely to
destroy the defensive organization, but also to demoralize and
starve the trench garrisons. This destructive bombardment should
extend a considerable distance to the north and south of the battle
front.</p>
<p class="indent1">12. The rapid construction of usable roads, both
for horse transport and mechanical transport, across the Canal
tunnel, would have to be a special feature of the organization, so
that the whole of our battle organization could be rapidly carried
forward to maintain the battle eastward of the Red Line. This would
involve the mobilization of a large amount of mechanical transport,
ready loaded with road-stone, so that road-making can commence
after Zero hour without any delay. For these works, there would be
available the greater part of the Australian and American technical
troops of seven Divisions, as well as Army Troops Companies.</p>

Commanding Australian Corps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some comment is necessary upon this proposal. The composition of
the American Divisions, following the French and not the British
precedent, differed materially from my own Divisions. The American
Division consisted of two Brigades, each of two Regiments, each of
three Battalions. Its total strength was nearly double that of an
English Division.</p>
<p>It will be noted that my proposal involved a concentrated
attack, not upon the canal, but upon that sector of 6,000 yards
which lay over the Bellicourt-Catelet tunnel. This zone at that
time lay clear of and to the north of my Corps area, and that is
what involved the necessity of "side-slipping" the Corps front to
the north.</p>

<br>
<p>Moreover, I put forward no suggestion that the Canal sector,
then in front of me, should be the subject of a frontal attack at
all. My proposal was that it should be taken by envelopment,
through the breach to be made over the tunnel. At the time I
regarded it as unlikely that the deep canal itself could be stormed
except at great cost. I was not prepared to commit any Australian
troops under my command to such an enterprise, and therefore
naturally hesitated to propose that any other Corps should attempt
it. For this reason I submitted an alternative plan of
envelopment.</p>
<p>This was, however, a matter for the Army Commander to decide. My
business was merely to show that the proposed action of my own
Corps permitted of the co-operation of the other Corps of the Army
in a specified way.</p>
<p>General Rawlinson's decisions were given on September 19th, at a
conference which he assembled at my Headquarters. My plan for the
action of the Australian and American Corps was to be adopted in
its entirety, with the sole exception that the capture of the
Beaurevoir line, on the first day of battle, was not to be included
in the plan. It was to be left to await the results of the prior
stages. In this modification I could readily concur.</p>
<p>As regards the action of the flank Corps, General Rawlinson held
the view that a direct assault on the canal itself ought to be
attempted, and that this should be entrusted to the Ninth Corps. He
was doubtless influenced, in this view, by the knowledge, disclosed
to us for the first time on that day, that he intended to propose
that the attack on the Hindenburg Line would, if undertaken, extend
over the front of at least three Armies, the French on the south,
and the Fourth and Third British Armies. Such a simultaneous
attack, over a very wide front, would naturally increase the
prospects of success for every Corps participating.</p>
<p>As to the Third Corps, it was to take part only in the
preliminaries of the battle, and not in the battle itself. Another
Corps, the Thirteenth (Lieut.-General Sir T.L.N. Morland) was to
join the Fourth Army. If the Australian Corps succeeded in
effecting the breach of the Hindenburg Line as I had proposed to
do, it was to be the Thirteenth Corps, and not the Third Corps,
which, pouring through the breach, was to envelop the flank of the
Hindenburg Line towards the north.</p>
<p>The main consideration that affected me was the approval of my
plan for the action of the two American and three Australian
Divisions. I was able to begin immediately the development in
detail of that plan, a task which proved at once the most arduous,
the most responsible, and the most difficult of any that I have had
to undertake throughout the whole of the war.</p>
<p>The first step was to get the American Divisions into the line
opposite their prospective battle fronts, and the next was to hand
over what had hitherto been the Australian Corps front to the Ninth
Corps.</p>
<p>The Ninth Corps battle front was to extend from Bellenglise to
Bellicourt, mine from opposite Bellicourt to opposite Le
Catelet.</p>
<p>The necessary troop movements and inter-divisional reliefs
required nearly a week for their completion. By the evening of
September 23rd, the last of the two Australian Divisions had been
relieved by the Americans and the Ninth Corps, and on that night
these stood on their respective battle frontages. I took over
command of this new front, thus manned by Americans, in the
forenoon of September 25th.</p>
<p>It is a somewhat noteworthy circumstance, but one which
attracted no attention at the time, that between September 25th and
September 29th, there was a period of five days during which
<i>no</i> Australian troops were in the front line in any part of
the French theatre of war. This was a situation which had never
arisen since the first contingent of Australians arrived from Egypt
in April, 1916. For nearly two and a half years, there had never
previously been a moment when some Australians had not been
confronting the enemy, somewhere or other in the long battle front
in France.</p>
<p>I have said that I had been called upon to undertake the
responsibility of directing in a great battle two Divisions (the
27th and 30th) of United States troops, numbering altogether some
50,000 men. These had been organized into a Corps, called the
Second American Corps, and commanded by Major-General G. W. Read.
It was certainly anomalous that a whole organized Corps should pass
under the orders of a Corps Headquarters of another nationality,
but in authorizing such an arrangement, General Rawlinson relied
upon the good sense and mutual forbearance of the Corps Commanders
concerned.</p>
<p>I am bound to say that the arrangement caused me no anxiety or
difficulty. General Read and his Staff most readily adapted
themselves to the situation. He established his Headquarters quite
close to my own, and gave me perfect freedom of action in dealing
direct with his two Divisional Commanders, so far as I found it
necessary to do so. Read was a man of sound common sense and clear
judgment, a reserved but agreeable and courteous personality. His
only desire was the success of his Divisions, and he very
generously took upon himself the r&ocirc;le of an interested
spectator, so that I might not be hampered in issuing orders or
instructions to his troops. At the same time, I am sure that in his
quiet, forceful way he did much to ensure on the part of his
Divisional Commanders and Brigadiers a sympathetic attitude towards
me and the demands I had to make upon them.</p>
<p>The Australian Corps had specialized in comprehensive and
careful preparations for battle. Its methods had been reduced to a
quite definite code of practice, with which every Staff Officer and
Battalion Adjutant had, by experience, become intimately familiar.
All this procedure was a closed book to the American troops, and
they were severely handicapped accordingly.</p>
<p>I therefore proposed to General Read, and he gratefully
accepted, the creation of an "Australian Mission" to his Corps,
whose r&ocirc;le would be to act as a body of expert advisers on
all questions of tactical technique, and of supply and maintenance.
This idea once accepted was worked out on a fully elaborated
scale.</p>
<p>To the head of this Mission I appointed Major-General Maclagan,
not only to command the personnel of the Mission itself, but also
to live with and act as adviser to General Read's own Staff. The
Mission comprised a total of 217 men, chosen from the First and
Fourth Australian Divisions, and consisted of specially selected
and very experienced officers and N.C.O.'s. The American Corps
Headquarters was provided with a Major-General, assisted by one
General Staff, one Administrative, one Signal, one Intelligence,
and one Machine Gun Staff Officer. Each American Division had
assigned to it an Australian Brigadier-General, assisted by several
Staff Officers; each American Brigade had an Australian Battalion
Commander and Signal Officer; and so on down the chain. Each
American Battalion, even, had four highly expert Warrant or
Non-commissioned officers to advise on every detail of supply,
equipment and tactical employment of the troops.</p>
<p>By such an arrangement it became possible to talk to the whole
American Corps in our own technical language. This saved me and my
Staff a vast amount of time and energy, because the members of this
Mission acted as interpreters of the technical terms and usages
customary in the orders and maps of the Australian Corps, which
were necessarily quite unfamiliar to the American troops.</p>
<p>Maclagan was a man eminently fitted for this task. In appearance
and in temperament he is every inch a soldier. Of all my Divisional
Commanders he was the only one who, immediately before the war, was
a professional soldier of the Imperial Army. Although not
Australian born, he was whole-heartedly Australian, for he had
spent some years as Director of Military Training at the Royal
Military College at Duntroon. On the outbreak of war he received
the command of the 3rd Australian Brigade, and with it carried out
the most difficult preliminary phase of the landing on the
Gallipoli peninsula. He commanded the Fourth Australian Division
from the autumn of 1917 until the conclusion of hostilities. His
characteristic attitude of mind, so strongly in contrast to that of
Rosenthal, was pessimistic. But that was not because he looked for
difficulties, but because he preferred squarely to recognize and
face all the difficulties there were. Yet he never failed in
performance, and invariably contrived to do what he had urged could
not be done. One could not afford to take him at his own modest
estimate of himself. Both he and his Division always bettered any
promise they gave.</p>
<p>I entertain no kind of doubt that it was only because of the
creation of this Australian Mission to the Americans, and of
Maclagan's tact, industry and judgment in controlling it, that the
combined action of the two Corps in the great battle of the closing
days of September proved as successful as it did. Under no other
conditions would it have been possible to bring about any
reasonable degree of co-operation between two forces whose war
experiences, outlook, attitude towards their problems, training and
temperament were so fundamentally different.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to indulge in either a panegyric or a
condemnation of these American Divisions. Neither would be deserved
or appropriate. They showed a fine spirit, a keen desire to learn,
magnificent individual bravery, and splendid comradeship. But they
were lacking in war experience, in training, and in knowledge of
technique. They had not yet learned the virtues of unquestioning
obedience, of punctuality, of quick initiative, of anticipating the
next action. They were, many of them, unfamiliar with the weapons
and instruments of fighting, with the numerous kinds of explosive
materials, or with the routine of preparing and promulgating clear
orders. They seriously underrated the necessity for a
well-organized system of supply, particularly of food and water, to
the battle troops. They hardly, as yet, appreciated the tactical
expedients available for reducing losses in battle.</p>
<p>Yet all these shortcomings were the results only of
inexperience, and it is perhaps unfair to contrast them with the
Australian troops who had seen front-line service in France for two
and a half years continuously, and whose leaders, high and low, had
served a long and graduated apprenticeship in every branch of their
duties.</p>
<p>The Australian Mission assisted greatly to minimize these
difficulties. Although its members were vested with no executive
powers, their advice and help were eagerly sought, and zealously
adopted. In many ways, large and small, their assistance must have
proved invaluable. How to interpret orders from above and how to
issue them to those below, how to draw stores and how to distribute
them, how to organize the signal service and how to ensure a flow
of information&mdash;these ranked among the greater matters. In
quite small things also, help was needed, such as the way to
detonate mortar bombs, to equip the infantryman for battle, to
organize and use the messenger (<i>i.e</i>., runner) service, and
to keep battle stations clear of people who had no urgent business
there.</p>
<p>It is not, of course, intended to convey that all these defects
were present in every regiment. Some, however, were met with, by
the officers of the Australian Mission, in all of them.</p>
<p>It greatly added to the burden cast upon the American Divisions
that they were called upon to fight almost as soon as they had
taken up duty in the line. The necessity for this was really a
legacy from the Third Corps, whom they had relieved, and it is
essential for an understanding of the course of events during these
days to narrate them in proper chronological order.</p>
<p>I have explained that as the result of the battle of Hargicourt,
the Australian Corps had succeeded in mastering the whole of the
Hindenburg outpost line opposite its front, as far as a point a
little north of and opposite to Bellicourt. The advance of the
Third Corps, however, had failed to reach the same line, and had
stopped short of it by an average distance of nearly a thousand
yards. On my pointing out that the front I had taken over did not
comply with the stipulations which I had made in my battle plan,*
the Army Commander decided that prior to the main attack, the
northern of the two American Divisions should make good this
shortage, by an attack aiming at the capture of the remainder of
the Hindenburg outpost line opposite the tunnel sector.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See paragraph 3 of same.]</p>
<p>I must now anticipate an explanation of the main outlines of the
plan which I had prepared for the great battle, by a brief
reference to the situation and disposition of troops on September
25th. The two American Divisions were respectively the 30th,
commanded by Major-General Lewis, on the right or south, and the
27th, commanded by Major-General O'Ryan, on the left or north, each
lying on a frontage of three thousand yards. These two Divisions
comprised, in all, eight regiments, each of three battalions. I had
instructed each of them to place one regiment in the line, and to
keep the remaining three, <i>i.e</i>., six in all, in reserve, for
the main operation.</p>
<p>My first Corps conference dealing with the forthcoming
operations was held at my Headquarters at Assevillers, on September
23rd. The American Generals Read, Lewis and O'Ryan, with their
respective Staffs, attended, as also did the Australian Generals
Maclagan, Brand and Mackay, who were members of the Australian
Mission to the American Corps. None of the Australian Commanders
destined to take part in the operations attended on this day, for
two reasons, firstly, because I intended to confine myself entirely
to that portion of the operation which concerned the American
troops only, and secondly, because the date of the battle had not
then been decided, and I wished to run no risk of confusing
executive action by any premature announcements to the Australians,
which subsequent events might modify.</p>
<p>The American r&ocirc;le, had, however, sufficiently crystallized
to enable me to explain it to the assembled Generals in great
detail. As will subsequently appear, it was a plan which had,
intentionally, been reduced to the simplest possible elements. It
was to be a straightforward trench to trench attack, from a
perfectly straight "jumping off" line to a perfectly straight
objective line, under a dense Artillery and Machine-Gun barrage,
and with the assistance of a large contingent of Tanks.</p>
<p>The advance was to be at a deliberate pace, and if due regard
were had to a few elementary precautions, should prove a simple
task for the American Infantry. It was, indeed, on quite
stereotyped lines, such as had so often carried the Australian
Infantry to victory in set-piece battles such as Messines,
Broodseinde, Hamel and the first phase of August 8th.</p>
<p>It was, however, borne in upon me, very soon after this
Conference opened, that I was now confronted with quite a different
proposition from that to which I had been accustomed in the
conferences attended by my own Divisional Generals. The exposition
of the plan itself was brief and simple, but it elicited such a
rain of questions, that in the end I found myself compelled to
embark upon a very detailed exposition of the fundamental
principles of my battle practice.</p>
<p>With blackboard and chalk, maps and diagrams, I had to speak for
more than three hours in an endeavour to explain methods and
reasons, mistakes and remedies, dangers and precautions, procedures
and expedients. The proceedings left me with no doubt that the
American Generals became fully informed as to the tasks and duties
allotted to them, and fully understood them.</p>
<p>In the light of after events, I am not so sure that they
succeeded in passing on the information to their
subordinates&mdash;not by reason of any shortcomings on their own
part, for they impressed me as able, strong men&mdash;but because
their Divisions had not yet learned the methods and machinery of
effectively and rapidly conveying instructions to large bodies of
troops.</p>
<p>In one particular, subordinate though vital, there certainly was
a serious failure to reach the troops. The enemy had, during 1916,
met our assault tactics with an answer which proved disastrously
effective against us until we had learned how to meet it. He
provided his trench systems with many and roomy shell-proof
dug-outs. Whenever our barrage fell upon his trenches, his
garrisons promptly took cover in these dug-outs. When our
assaulting infantry reached the enemy trenches they found but few
of the enemy there, and they rushed headlong forward to the next
objective trenches. From out of their dug-outs streamed the enemy,
faced about, attacked our assaulting lines in rear and withered
them with fire. Many an attack by the British on the Somme failed
for just such reasons.</p>
<p>In 1917 we evolved, and applied for the first time at the battle
of Messines, an effective answer to such tactics. Close on the
heels of our first line of assaulting troops came a second line,
whose r&ocirc;le was to occupy the captured trench immediately, and
to "mop it up". This meant the killing or disarming of all enemy
found in hiding, the picketing of the entrances and exits of all
dug-outs, and laying siege to them until their occupants
surrendered, a course to which they were encouraged by a liberal
use of phosphorus bombs or Mills's grenades.</p>
<p>This process of "mopping up" became an integral part of our
attack procedure. Australian infantry soon learned its importance,
and practised the method with a thoroughness and efficiency to
which I remember no exception. Even a junior sergeant commanding a
dozen men could be relied on to take all measures necessary to
ensure that no enemy was ever left in hiding and unguarded behind
his little party as they advanced.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming attack upon the Hindenburg defences, the
process of "mopping up" became of supreme importance, because of
the very fact, of which we had become well aware, that the whole
defensive system had been provided, on quite an exceptional scale,
with underground shelters, galleries, passages and dug-outs. I made
the most of this knowledge in my talks to the Americans, emphasized
the dangers as strongly as I was able, insisted that the "mopping
up" organization of their infantry must be absolutely perfected,
and ordered that of the total Infantry participating in the
assault, not less than one-half should have the special r&ocirc;le
of safeguarding all underground exits and entrances.</p>
<p>The great fear was, of course, that these new troops, eager to
show their mettle, would be carried away in the excitement of the
moment, and would rush headlong forward, regardless of the dangers
that lurked behind them. It is, after all, no small demand to make
upon the discipline of an Infantry soldier, to expect him patiently
and obediently to stand guard over some dug-out entrance, allowing
the battle to sweep on, and his comrades to go forward to the
excitement and glory of achieving the final objectives.</p>
<p>So indeed it happened. The American Infantry had either not been
sufficiently tutored in this important matter, or the need of it
had not penetrated their understanding. In the attacks carried out
by these troops, while under my command, the "mopping up" was
always badly done, even in the few cases where it was attempted.
The result was failure to achieve a clean success, and a great
addition to their own casualty list. This criticism will be fully
borne out by the narrative of the great battle itself.</p>
<p>A second and much larger conference was held at my Headquarters
on September 26th, for the really complete and final co-ordination
of the whole of the procedure for the forthcoming battle. It was
attended not only by the American Divisional Generals and
Brigadiers, but also by the Commanders of the Second, Third and
Fifth Australian Divisions, their Staffs, the Tanks, Air Force and
Cavalry.</p>
<p>It was much the largest and was also destined to be the last of
any assemblage of Commanders that it had been my privilege to call
together in the course of this memorable campaign.</p>
<p>No one present will soon forget the tense interest and confident
expectancy which characterized that meeting. America, a great
English-speaking democracy on one shore of the Pacific, was to
co-operate with Australia, its younger sister democracy on the
opposite shore, in what was the greatest and what might be the most
decisive battle of the great European War. Few present doubted
that, if we were successful, the war could not last much
longer&mdash;because the loss of the Hindenburg system would
inevitably mean for the enemy his final enforced withdrawal from
France.</p>
<p>While the conference was in full swing, the Field Marshal
himself paid me a call. He had come to wish me success in the task
before me. He was interested to find so many Divisional Commanders
assembled, and was persuaded to address a few words to the
gathering.</p>
<p>The conduct of the proceedings of this conference was a heavy
strain. The main battle was to take place on September 29th, or
within seventy-two hours, and part of my front line still stood a
thousand yards west of the Hindenburg outpost lines. General
Rawlinson had decided that this defect was to be made good prior to
the main operation, and the attempt to do so had been timed to take
place on September 27th, the day after the conference.</p>
<p>I had, therefore, to complete my organization upon the basis of
a set of precedent conditions which had not yet been entirely
realized. It was a new and a difficult situation. The whole of the
powerful Artillery at my disposal for the battle, amounting now to
over a thousand guns, was naturally clamouring for final decisions,
so that final barrage maps could be submitted for my approval,
printed by my very diligent and competent body of lithographic
draughtsmen, and circulated to all the batteries and Infantry.</p>
<p>To await the result of the operation of the next day would have
allowed insufficient time to complete the necessary maps and to
distribute them before nightfall on September 28th. There was no
option but to assume that General O'Ryan (27th American Division)
would succeed in capturing the northern section of the outpost line
still in enemy hands, and upon that assumption to fix the Artillery
"start line" as falling to the east of that objective. For the
first time I had to gamble on a chance. It was contrary to the
policy which had governed all my previous battle plans, in which
nothing had been left to chance.</p>
<p>At 5.30 a.m. next morning the 27th American Division carried out
the attack, under a barrage, and assisted by Tanks. The principal
objective points in the trench system under attack were Quennemont
Farm and Gillemont Farm. Every trace of these once prosperous
homesteads and plantations had, of course, long since disappeared.
The names alone remained as memories of the fighting there of
1917.</p>
<p>What happened on that day will never be accurately known. For
once, the information from the air did not harmonize with the
claims made on behalf of the assaulting troops, perhaps because the
troops, being untrained in the use of flares, or having been left
unsupplied with them, failed to assist the aeroplanes in
identifying their correct positions. However that may be, it became
sufficiently clear, as the day proceeded, that no proper success
for the operation could be claimed.</p>
<p>There remained no doubt that some enemy were still left in
occupation of trenches on our side of the objective for that day,
and such American troops as may have gained their objective could
not therefore be reached. It appeared afterwards that small parties
of Americans had reached the vicinity of their objectives and had
very gallantly maintained themselves there, although surrounded on
all sides, until relieved by the Australians on September 29th.</p>
<p>The non-success of this operation of September 27th appeared
undoubtedly to be due to a failure to carry out "mopping up" duties
satisfactorily. It considerably embarrassed the preparations for
the main attack on the 29th. The knowledge that a number of
American wounded were still lying out in front, and the suspicion
that some of the American troops had succeeded in reaching
Gillemont Farm, precluded any alteration of the Artillery plans for
September 29th, even if there had still been time to do so without
creating untold confusion. To have brought the Artillery start
line, proposed for September 29th, back to the start line of
September 27th would have brought our own barrage down upon these
forward troops of ours.</p>
<p>I hastened to the Army Commander to put the position before him,
stating that I felt grave concern for the success of the main
operation, in view of the fact that my Artillery barrage would have
to come down fully a thousand yards in front of what was still the
front of the 27th Division. I suggested a postponement for a day to
give this Division, which had ample resources in troops, another
opportunity of retrieving the position. He explained, however, that
it was now too late to alter the programme, because three whole
Armies were committed to the date first appointed. He said that he
was, under the circumstances, quite prepared for a partial failure
at this point, and requested me to do my best to pursue the
original plan, in spite of this difficult situation.</p>
<p>He agreed, however, to my further request, that additional
Tanks, out of Army reserves, should be placed at my disposal, so
that I might allot them to the 27th Division, to assist them in
passing over the thousand yards which would bring them up level
with the Artillery barrage. I hoped that this would enable the
Division to catch up with the southern half of the battle line.</p>
<p>It was an unsatisfactory expedient, and gave no promise of
certain success. It proved futile, and gravely affected the actual
course, although not the ultimate success, of the battle still to
come. It was the only occasion in the campaign on which I was
compelled to accept preliminary arrangements which were not such as
would absolutely guarantee success.</p>
<p>The genesis of the difficulty thus created had, however, been
the failure of the Third Corps to complete their programme of
September 18th. It had been confirmed by the subsequent failure of
the 27th American Division to make up the deficiency on September
27th. I still think, as I then urged, that I should have been
allowed to accept the situation as I found it on taking over this
front on September 25th, and that the 27th Division should not have
been called upon, at the eleventh hour, to endeavour to establish
that new situation which had been originally assumed as the basis
for the battle plan of September 29th. My original proposal of
September 18th, in my letter of that date, paragraph 3 (see above),
had, of course, been made before I could foresee that the Third
Corps would fail to capture the start line contemplated in my first
plan.</p>
<p>Of course, all is well that ends well. But, for an anxious and
turbulent period of twenty-four hours on September 29th and 30th,
the issue of the battle hung in grave doubt. The operation,
although successful, did <em>not</em> proceed "according to plan"
in its entirety, and it was due to the wonderful gallantry and
skilful leading of the Third Australian Division that a very ugly
situation was retrieved, a result to which the Fifth Australian
Division also contributed in no small degree.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<h4>BELLICOURT AND BONY</h4>
<p>A <small>FULL</small> account of the battle plan for the forcing
of the main Hindenburg Line, on the front of the Australian Corps,
would alone fill a volume. Nothing but brief references to the main
outlines of the plan can be attempted here.</p>
<p>The forces now at my disposal, for immediate use, were greater
than I had ever before committed to a single operation. They
comprised, in all, five Divisions, of which two were American and
three Australian, besides the whole of the Corps troops. The total
personnel employed on that occasion, under my orders in one
capacity or another, almost reached 200,000 men.</p>
<p>Besides 58 Battalions of Infantry, there were over 20,000
technical troops, including Engineers, Pioneers and Signallers,
upwards of 1,000 guns of all calibres, more than 500 Machine Guns,
over 200 Tanks, a Brigade of Cavalry, a Battalion of Armoured Cars,
and numerous Air Squadrons. The subsidiary services made an
imposing array, comprising observation balloons, supply trains,
ammunition columns, auxiliary horse transport, ambulances, motor
convoys and mechanical transport, together with railway,
veterinary, sanitary and labour units.</p>
<p>It was no small task correctly to apportion to each fighting
unit and to each service its appropriate place in the general
scheme, so that these great resources should be employed to the
best advantage, without overtaxing the capacity of any one of them.
I had also to secure the greatest measure of co-operation between
them all, and the punctual performance by each of the work
prescribed.</p>
<p>In contrast with the great battle of August 8th, there was on
this occasion no possibility of securing any advantage from
surprise. The enemy command was bound to know quite as well as we
did that we intended to deliver an attack on a gigantic scale, and
there is no doubt that they put forth their utmost efforts, and
marshalled their fullest resources in men and guns, to meet it.</p>
<p>There was, therefore, no object to be served by any measures of
concealment, and our task could not be made any the harder through
heralding the approach of the actual attack by adequate Artillery
preparation.</p>
<p>The programme, therefore, began on the night of September 26th.
There was an intense Artillery action, extending over some sixty
hours, with every gun that could be brought to bear. This does not,
of course, imply that every individual gun or battery remained in
action during the whole of this period; ammunition supplies were
not inexhaustible, and gun detachments required periods of rest.
But the programme of times and targets was so arranged, and the
tasks were so distributed over the available batteries, that
throughout this period there was no respite for the enemy in any
part of the field.</p>
<p>For some days prior to the opening of this bombardment, railway
trains and motor lorries had been working at the highest possible
pressure, to enable gunners to accumulate at their gun pits and in
all their dumps a sufficient supply of Artillery ammunition for
this purpose. In the short period which had elapsed since the
forcing of the Somme, in the early days of September, the railway
diversion from Bray to P&eacute;ronne had been completed. The
railway from P&eacute;ronne to Roisel, although seriously damaged
by the enemy in many places, had been restored, and Roisel had
become the railhead for the delivery of ammunition. It was a
noteworthy performance, for all the Corps services concerned, to
carry out the whole supply of this battle in so smooth and
expeditious a manner.</p>
<p>The first phase of this bombardment was of a novel character.
For over two years the enemy had been using a shell containing an
irritant and poisonous gas known to us as "mustard" gas. It was so
called only because of the smell. For a long time we had been
promised that the British Artillery service would shortly be
supplied with a gas shell, of similar character, but even more
potent. It was, moreover, anticipated that the German gas mask
would prove no adequate protection against this kind of gas.</p>
<p>At last the new shell was forthcoming, and the first shipment
from England, amounting to some fifty thousand rounds, was placed
at the disposal of the Australian Corps. My Artillery action,
therefore, opened with a concentrated gas bombardment for twelve
hours, attacking probable living quarters, occupied defences, and
all known or suspected approaches to them. Apart from being the
first occasion, I believe that it was also the only occasion during
the war when our "mustard" gas shell was used. No suitable
opportunity for further use occurred before the close of
hostilities.</p>
<p>The gas bombardment was followed by forty-eight hours'
destructive bombardment with high explosive shell. This was
directed partly against the enemy's Artillery, as far as the short
time available had permitted us to locate his batteries.</p>
<p>Another part of the bombardment was devoted to the approaches
from the enemy's rear to his forward defences. The object was to
render his roads and tracks unusable, and thereby to prevent the
delivery of rations, or, at any rate, of hot food to his garrisons,
or of ammunition to his guns. By these means we expected, by
partially starving him out, to impair the enemy's <i>moral</i>.</p>
<p>The main weight of the bombardment was, however, devoted to the
destruction of the enemy's defences, of which his barbed-wire
entanglements-were for us the most formidable feature. Much of this
wire was disposed in concealed positions, either in depressions of
the ground, or in sunken moats, artificially prepared. It was,
therefore, difficult to locate, and still more difficult for my
gunners to direct their fire upon it. Nevertheless, there was a
considerable quantity of wire which was plainly visible, and every
band of entanglements through which breaches could be blown was so
much to the good, in clearing the path for the Infantry
assault.</p>

<br>
<p>In earlier years it had been the custom to attack barbed wire
with our lighter guns, using shrapnel shell. This shell is,
however, essentially a "man-killing" projectile, and has no great
destructive power against field works. On the other hand, our
heavier guns were scarcely more useful for wire cutting, because
the great craters which were made by the explosion of their shells
destroyed the wire only very locally, and, by upheaving the ground,
increased rather than reduced the difficulties of the Infantry.</p>
<p>This was due to the employment of fuses, which permitted the
projectile, after striking, to bury itself in the ground for a
small fraction of time before igniting the explosive charge which
it contained. Hence the great shell craters. It was a very proper
fuse to use for destroying trenches, dug-outs, gunpits and
emplacements, but of little use for cutting wire.</p>
<p>In due course the British service evolved an "instantaneous"
fuse, which became known to the gunners as the "106 Fuse". This had
the merit of being perfectly safe to handle, up to the moment of
firing the gun, but by means of a most ingenious mechanism it
became highly sensitive while the projectile was in flight between
the gun and the target. The result was that the very slightest
obstacle met with, even a strand of wire, was sufficient to set off
the fuse and explode the shell. Even if the shell met no obstacle
before striking the earth, the explosion would take place above
instead of below the surface of the ground, and would exert so
great a horizontal force in all directions that great bands of wire
entanglements would be bodily uprooted, over considerable areas,
and literally blown to one side in a jumbled mass.</p>
<p>Our heavy guns, therefore, using 106 Fuses, became ideal wire
cutters, and it was in this way that much of the Artillery action
during the forty-eight hours prior to the battle was applied.</p>
<p>The Infantry and Field Artillery plan, which I prepared, was
very similar in its general character to the battle plan of August
8th. It differed only in subordinate details due to local
topographical variations from the former conditions.</p>
<p>Of the five Divisions available, one&mdash;the Second
Australian&mdash;was to remain in Corps reserve, but handy. For
that purpose it was brought up from its rest near Cappy, by motor
bus, to the vicinity of P&eacute;ronne, the move being completed by
nightfall on September 27th.</p>
<p>The battle Divisions and their prior dispositions were as
follows:</p>
<br>
<p><i>Line Divisions</i>:</p>
<p class="indent1">On the right, the 30th American Division, to
attack with the 60th Brigade, and to employ the 59th Brigade to
form a southern defensive flank in the event of the failure of the
Ninth Corps to cross the Canal.</p>
<p class="indent1">On the left, the 27th American Division, to
attack with the 54th Brigade, and to employ the 53rd Brigade to
form a northern defensive flank, until such time as the Thirteenth
Corps was ready to pass through in a north-easterly direction.</p>
<p>"<i>Exploitation" Divisions</i>:</p>
<p class="indent1">On the right, the 5th Australian Division, with
the 8th and 15th Brigades in the first line and the 14th Brigade
following in support.</p>
<p class="indent1">On the left, the Third Australian Division, with
the 10th and 11th Brigades in the first line and the 9th Brigade
following in support.</p>
<br>
<p>The total frontage was equally divided between the two pairs of
Divisions, being about 3,500 yards to each. The battle was to be
divided into two phases, the first to be executed by the Americans,
under a timed barrage, the second, under open warfare conditions,
by the Australians. It was intended that the Americans should
penetrate to the "green line", an average distance of 3,500 yards,
which took in the villages of Bellicourt, Nauroy, Bony and
Gouy.</p>
<p>The Australians were to exploit eastward, but were limited to a
further advance of 4,000 yards, overrunning Joncourt,
Estr&eacute;es and Beaurevoir. Should they reach that objective on
the first day, they would have passed the last-known wired line,
and the country beyond would be suitable for Cavalry. Accordingly,
I allotted to the 5th Cavalry Brigade, which had been placed under
my orders, the r&ocirc;le of passing through the Australian
Divisions, and carrying the exploitation still further east, in the
direction of Montbrehain and Brancourt.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the whole of the objectives named were in our
possession only on the forenoon of October 5th, instead of, as
planned, by September 30th. The actual battle developed on totally
different lines from those which I had planned, for reasons which I
shall relate in due course. Little object would therefore be served
in an explanation of the considerable mass of detailed arrangements
which the original plan involved; these would also, by reason of
their technical character, be more suitable for a text-book on
tactics.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that elaborate arrangements were
made&mdash;and also partly utilized&mdash;for the rapid
construction of four main roads from west to east, through the full
width of the Hindenburg system. This work was to follow on the
heels of the advance. The r&ocirc;les assigned to the Tanks, the
Barrage Artillery, the Mobile Artillery, the Heavy Artillery and
the Armoured Cars were similar in character, although differing in
detail from those carried out by them on August 8th.</p>
<p>On no previous occasion had the labour of preparation and the
stress upon all Commanders and Staffs been so heavy, but all
responded nobly. There were none who did not count the hours till
zero hour, which was fixed for 5.50 a.m. on September 29th.</p>
<p>In appraising the long sustained fighting on the front of the
Fourth Army which began on that day, and lasted a full week, regard
must be had to contemporary events. The American First Army attack
on St. Mihiel on September 11th had wrought fresh dislocation to
the enemy's resources, and had created another sore spot on his
long front. On September 26th the Americans and French again
successfully attacked between Verdun and Rheims. On September 27th,
the First and Third British Armies opened a great attack on a front
of thirteen miles before Cambrai and the magnificent Canadian Corps
captured Bourlon Wood and advanced to within a mile of Cambrai
city. On September 28th, the Second British Army and the Belgians
attacked between Ypres and the sea. All British Armies, except the
Fifth, had, therefore, by that time developed active battle fronts.
On September 29th the first French Army would co-operate with us,
and on that day the battle front was to cover a total length of
twenty-five miles.</p>
<p>The simultaneous engagement of so large a portion of the enemy's
line in Belgium and France during the preceding three days had
piled difficulty upon difficulty for him, and it was therefore not
unreasonable to entertain two expectations&mdash;firstly, that our
task would be rendered easier by the wide dispersion of the enemy's
defensive energies, and, secondly, that he could hardly hope to
survive a definite breach in his great defensive line at so
critical a place as the Bellicourt tunnel. If that went he would be
secure nowhere, and his next possibility of making a stand would be
on the line of the Meuse, even if not the line of the Rhine.</p>
<p>The day broke with a familiar mist, and the attack was launched
punctually at the appointed time. Quite early in the day news came
in that the Ninth Corps on my right hand had achieved an
astonishing success, that Bellenglise had been captured, and that
the deep canal had been successfully crossed in several places. It
was the 46th Imperial Division to which this great success was
chiefly due, a success achieved by most careful preparation and
gallant execution. Lifebelts, rafts, boats, mats, portable bridges,
and every device which ingenuity could suggest had been prepared
beforehand for the actual crossing of the water in the canal. There
can be no doubt that this success, conceived at first as a
demonstration to distract attention from the Australian Corps
front, materially assisted me in the situation in which I was
placed later on the same day.</p>
<p>The first reports from my own front were in every way
satisfactory, and it looked as if everything were going strictly to
schedule. That morning the stream of messages pouring into my
Headquarters office, from special observers, from the air, from the
line divisions, from the Artillery, and from my liaison officers
with neighbouring Corps, exceeded in volume and import anything I
had met with in my previous war experience. I have the typewritten
precis of the "inwards" signal traffic before me as I write. Those
received and laid before me on that day cover thirty closely
typewritten foolscap pages.</p>
<p>The burden of the earlier messages all pointed to the same
conclusion: "30th Division crossed the Canal on time"; "1,000
prisoners, all going well"; "Bony captured"; "Tanks fighting round
Bellicourt at 9 a.m."; "Bellicourt taken."</p>
<p>Those, omitting formal parts, were the burden of all the
telegrams up to 10 a.m. They continued in such a favourable strain
during the whole of the time that the two American Divisions had
command of the battle front.</p>
<p>The time for their arrival at the first
objective&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., the "green" line&mdash;had been
computed to be at 9 a.m. The Australian Divisions were to cross the
green line at 11 a.m., and at the same hour to take over the
command on the front of the battle. Two telegrams then came in
which caused me serious anxiety. It may be of interest to set them
out in detail:</p>
<p>Received at 11. 10 a.m. from 30th American Division:</p>
<p class="indent1">"Fighting in Bellicourt, owing to Germans having
come down along the Canal from the north. Fifth Australian Division
hung up."</p>
<p>Received at 11. 12 a.m, from Third Australian Division:</p>
<p class="indent1">"We are dug in on west side of tunnel. Americans
are held up in front of us."</p>
<p>These were only the first symptoms of a miscarriage of the
plans. Evidences rapidly multiplied that all was not going well.
But, concurrently, there came a stream of messages from the air
that our troops and some of our Tanks were east of both Bellicourt
and Le Catelet.</p>
<p>The situation was therefore confused and uncertain, and it had
to be diagnosed without delay. I hastened forward with all possible
speed to get into personal touch with the situation and the
Divisional Commanders. I soon formed the conclusion that probably
both American Divisions had successfully followed our barrage, and
that numbers of their troops had really reached the green line, but
that, once again, the "mopping up" procedure had been neglected.
The enemy had reappeared in strength from underground <i>behind</i>
the Americans, and was holding up the advance of the two Australian
Divisions to the second phase of the operation.</p>
<p>Subsequent developments and further inquiries entirely bore out
these conclusions. On the front of the 27th American Division there
had been difficulty from the start. A number of Tanks allotted to
that Division had been put out of action, some by direct hits from
Artillery, others by land mines. It was currently believed that
these were not enemy mines, but some which had been laid months
before by our own Fifth Army as a measure of protection against the
possible use of Tanks by the enemy.</p>
<p>This had given the 27th Division a bad start. Only two out of
its six assaulting Battalions had managed to catch up with and
follow the barrage. The remainder could not get forward as far even
as the Artillery start line. Those Americans who did follow the
barrage apparently forgot all about "mopping up". They reached Le
Catelet and Gouy and entered those villages, only to find
themselves surrounded on all sides by the enemy. A German officer
prisoner informed us next day that 1,200 of these Americans had
been taken prisoner.</p>
<p>The 30th American Division did not fare so badly. They got a
good start with the barrage, but the broken condition of the
ground, the intricate trench system and the confusion of wire and
dug-outs brought about a loss of cohesion and of control. By the
time Bellicourt was reached, the attacking troops had fallen some
distance behind the barrage, and most of the weight had gone out of
the attack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in this part of the field also, the enemy had
reappeared from underground, and was still in strength on the west
side of Bellicourt, now in the hands of the Americans, when the
advanced guard of the Fifth Australian Division came upon them.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected situation for the Fifth Division. But
without a moment's hesitation the leading troops took its measure.
They deployed from the Artillery formation ** in which they had
been previously advancing into lines of skirmishers. After hard
fighting in the face of most vigorous resistance, they cleared away
all opposition which lay between them and Bellicourt, and, sweeping
forward through that village, carefully "mopping up" as they went,
carried with them considerable numbers of the Americans whom they
found there.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Artillery Formation" is an advance in numerous
small infantry columns irregularly spaced both in frontage and
depth. "Line of Skirmishers" is an advance in successive lines of
men, the intervals between the men being from two to five paces,
and between the lines from 50 to 100 paces.]</p>
<p>While this was happening, the Third Australian Division,
deprived of the assistance either of Artillery or of Tanks, and in
broad daylight, found themselves confronted with the difficult
problem of carrying out the whole of the task which had been set
for the 27th Division, because the reappearance of the enemy upon
the ground successfully passed over by some of the Americans
earlier in the day nullified all the value of that success.</p>
<p>It was about 2 p.m. before I had succeeded in gathering
sufficient reliable information about the situation to enable me to
arrive at a decision how to deal with it. By that hour the Fifth
Division had advanced through Nauroy, and had passed across the Le
Catelet line in that vicinity. The Third Division had managed to
get obliquely astride of the line of the tunnel, its right being
well across the main Hindenburg wire, while its left was still in
the vicinity of the American start line of that morning. They had,
however, succeeded in finally capturing Quennemont Farm. The whole
of their advance into such a position had been hotly contested.</p>
<p>My troops were therefore, to all intents and purposes, astride
of the Hindenburg main line, one Division wholly on the east and
the other Division mainly on the west of it. The southern end of
the tunnel was in my possession, the northern end was not.</p>
<p>My decision was forthwith to abandon the original plan which had
taken so many days and so much labour to prepare, to take immediate
measures for securing our gains for the day, and to organize a
continuation of the battle next day on totally different lines.
These were to conquer the remainder of the main Hindenburg trench
system, in which the ruin of the village of Bony was the key
position, by attacking it from the south towards the north, instead
of from the west towards the east.</p>
<p>The first step in this plan was to ensure effective tactical
contact between the right flank of the Third Division and the left
flank of the Fifth Division. I framed an order that both Divisions
should take immediate steps to such an end. Telephone communication
with both Gellibrand and Hobbs being momentarily interrupted, I was
about to forward written orders by dispatch rider to each of them
to the effect mentioned.</p>
<p>Before the messenger had time to leave, however, messages came
in from both Divisional Commanders, each reporting that he had just
secured tactical touch with the other in exactly the way which I
wanted. I consider this a remarkable example of unity of thought.
Each, without being able to consult the other or myself, had taken
the very course which each correctly anticipated that I should
decide to have taken. The German General Staff used to boast in
their writings that no other Army approached theirs in this
capacity for initiative by subordinates on lines in thorough unison
with each other and with the policies of the higher command.</p>
<p>That the situation on my front, now held exclusively by
Australians, would have been secure that night against a determined
counter-attack I did not doubt, even though the fourteen Australian
Battalions now holding a line of some 9,000 yards would scarcely
average 400 rifles apiece. However, nothing more than small local
counter-attacks was attempted, and the hold which I had gained upon
the main defences was not slackened. I feel sure, nevertheless,
that the success of the Ninth Corps on my right in swarming across
the canal from Bellenglise to Bellicourt had much to do with my
immunity from interference; the enemy probably found himself with
quite enough to do there in trying to re-establish his line further
in rear, and this forbade him to materialize sufficient troops for
any general counter-attack.</p>
<p>While I have felt obliged to state the facts in regard to the
partial failure of the two American Divisions to carry out their
part of my battle plan, I desire, nevertheless, to do full justice
to these troops. I have no hesitation in saying that they fought
most bravely, and advanced to the assault most fearlessly; that the
leaders, from the Divisional Generals downwards, did the utmost
within their powers to ensure success. Nor must the very bad
conditions under which the 27th Division had to start be forgotten.
Our American Allies are, all things considered, entitled to high
credit for a fine effort.</p>
<p>But it is, nevertheless, true that in this battle they
demonstrated their inexperience in war, and their ignorance of some
of the elementary methods of fighting employed on the French front.
For these shortcomings they paid a heavy price. Their sacrifices,
nevertheless, contributed quite definitely to the partial success
of the day's operations, and although the comprehensive plan, which
was to have carried my front beyond Beaurevoir on the very first
day, had to be abandoned, the day's fighting ended with the two
Australian Divisions in quite a satisfactory position for a
continuance of the operations on the next day.</p>
<p>To this there was, however, one important qualification. Air
observers continued to report the presence of American troops
between the Hindenburg Line and Le Catelet, and also in the latter
village. Late that night an Australian Artillery liaison officer
managed to make his way back into our lines with the story that he
had actually advanced with a battalion of Americans into Le
Catelet, and that they were still there, although practically
surrounded.</p>
<p>The 27th Division made many attempts to get into communication
with them, but without avail. Beyond the report previously alluded
to that they had subsequently been made prisoner, I have no
information of their ultimate fate; but when patrols of the Third
Division entered the village forty-eight hours later, there was no
longer any sign of them. A number of small parties of Americans
were, however, encountered and relieved as the further advance of
the Third Division progressed during the next two days.</p>
<p>The situation was profoundly embarrassing. With the mass of
Artillery at my disposal, it would have been a simple matter to
cover the further advance of the Third Division so amply as to make
it easy to master the northern half of the tunnel defences,
especially if attacked end on. But so long as American troops or
wounded were presumed to be lying out in front, I dared not use
Artillery at all, except on a very restricted scale. I felt
justified, however, in bombarding isolated localities which patrols
had definitely ascertained to be still in enemy hands; but nothing
in the shape of adequate artillery support to the Infantry could be
attempted.</p>
<p>During the night of September 29th orders were issued to the
Second American Corps to withdraw all advanced troops that could be
reached, and to concentrate their regiments for rest and
reorganization, so as to be ready as soon as possible for
re-employment. Very considerable numbers of American soldiers had
become mixed up with the Australian Battalions, and, in their
eagerness, had gone forward with them, regardless of the particular
r&ocirc;les or objectives which had been originally assigned to
them. It was found to be a matter of some difficulty to induce
these men to withdraw from the fighting and to rejoin their own
units, so keen were they to continue their advance.</p>
<p>I also ordered the Second Australian Division to be brought up
by bus from the P&eacute;ronne area, and to take up a position of
readiness just west of the Hindenburg Line. I foresaw that with the
nature of the fighting before the Third and Fifth Divisions, it
would not be very long before they would have to be relieved, and
there was still the Beaurevoir line of trenches to be overcome
before the Hindenburg system could be claimed as taken in its
entirety. This move was duly carried out, and the Second Division
became available by the evening of October 1st in close support of
the battle front.</p>
<p>The orders to the two line Divisions for September 30th were to
attack generally in a north-easterly direction. The immediate
objectives of the Third Division were Bony village, the "Knob" and
the northern entrance to the tunnel. The flanks of the two
Divisions were to meet on the Railway Spur, and the right of the
Fifth Division was to swing forward in the direction of Joncourt,
in sympathy with any advance made by the Ninth Corps to the south
of them.</p>
<p>There was, as explained, no possibility of attempting anything
like a methodical advance covered by a co-ordinated Artillery
barrage. Progress would depend upon the tenacity and skilful
leading of the front-line troops, and reliance must be had more
upon the bayonet and the bomb than upon external aids. It was, in a
peculiar degree, a private soldier's battle.</p>
<p>The night of September 29th brought steady rain, and everybody
was drenched to the skin. September 30th was a day of intense
effort, slow and methodical hand-to-hand fighting, in a perfect
tangle of trenches, with every yard of the advance vigorously
contested; but by nightfall the line of the Third Division had
advanced fully 1,000 yards. Its left had pivoted on the "Knoll", to
the west of the Hindenburg Line. Gillemont Farm was by then
securely in their hands; they had reached the southern outskirts of
Bony village. Their right was well across the line of the canal,
and joined the left flank of the Fifth Division on the Railway
Spur. The Fifth Division had cleared the Le Catelet trench line of
the enemy, and its right was by now well to the east of Nauroy.</p>
<p>Another day's fighting was still before both Divisions, but the
effect of the successful efforts of September 30th was speedily
felt on October 1st. Overnight the enemy must have made up his mind
that it was hopeless to try to retain any further hold upon the
tunnel line, and his further resistance melted rapidly away. On
October 1st events moved quickly; by 10 a.m. the Fifth Division
reported the capture of Joncourt. By midday the whole of the
village of Bony was in our hands, and at the same hour the air
observers reported our patrols rapidly approaching the "Knob" and
Le Catelet village.</p>
<p>By nightfall of October 1st the whole operation had been
successfully completed. The northern entrance to the tunnel, the
"Knob" and the whole of the Railway Spur were in our hands; our
line ran just west of Le Catelet and east of Estr&eacute;es and
Joncourt; all isolated parties of Americans and all American
wounded had been gathered in, and the whole situation had been
satisfactorily cleared up from an Artillery point of view.</p>
<p>Later the same night our patrols entered Le Catelet, which lay
in a hollow below us, and found the village deserted except for a
number of enemy wounded. The enemy, during that day, relinquished
his last hold upon the famous tunnel defences, and withdrew
precipitately eastwards to the Beaurevoir hill and northwards
towards Aubencheul. Our total captures during the three days'
operations amounted to 3,057 prisoners and 35 guns.</p>
<p>It had been a stiff fight, and the endurance of the Infantry had
been highly tested. The skill displayed by the Third Division in
the course of the close trench fighting of September 30th was
particularly noteworthy. The stress upon Major-General Gellibrand
and his Staff and Infantry Brigadiers had been severe. The several
Brigades and Battalions had unavoidably become seriously mixed up.
Control became very difficult, but was never completely lost.</p>
<p>This was illustrated by the following incident of the day's
fighting. I had ascertained that the whole of the Infantry of the
Division had been committed, and there were no reserves in the
hands of the Divisional Commander. One Battalion of the 9th Brigade
was fighting under the orders of the 11th Brigade, another under
that of the 10th Brigade. I took exception to this, and directed
that a Divisional reserve should be immediately reconstituted. In
spite of the difficulties of communication, Gellibrand contrived to
carry this intricate order into effect during the very climax of
the fight.</p>
<p>Gellibrand was a man of interesting personality, more a
philosopher and student than a man of action. His great personal
bravery and his high sense of duty compensated in a great measure
for some tendency to uncertainty in executive action. He had been a
professional soldier, but before the war had retired into civil
life. When the call came, he received a junior Staff appointment
with the First Division, but his outstanding merits soon gained him
promotion. As a Brigadier, he had, during 1916 and 1917,
successfully led several of the Australian Brigades. His command of
the Third Division during the last five months of active fighting
was characterized by complete success in battle. His temperament
and methods sometimes involved him in embarrassments on the
administrative side of his work; but he succeeded in retaining to
the last the whole-hearted confidence of his troops.</p>
<p>I feel certain from my close observation of the course of events
on September 30th and October 1st, that much of the success of the
battle was due to Gellibrand's personal tenacity, and the assiduous
manner in which he kept himself in personal touch from hour to hour
with the forward situation and progress of his troops.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the conclusion of the fighting I issued the
following message:</p>
<p class="indent1">"Please convey to all Commanders, Staffs and
troops of the Third and Fifth Australian Divisions my sincere
appreciation of and thanks for their fine work of the past three
days. Confronted at the outset of the operations with a critical
situation of great difficulty, and hampered by inability to make
full use of our Artillery resources, these Divisions succeeded in
completely overwhelming a stubborn defence in the most strongly
fortified sector of the Western Front. This was due to the
determination and resource of the leaders and the grit, endurance
and fighting spirit of the troops. Nothing more praiseworthy has
been done by Australian troops in this war."</p>
<p>The operations entrusted to the Corps had, by the night of
October 1st, been substantially completed. Although the Beaurevoir
defence line still lay to the east of us, the main canal defences,
as far as the Le Catelet line, had been pierced, and a way had been
opened for the Thirteenth Corps to pass across the line of the
tunnel to be launched upon its task of turning the enemy out of the
northern continuation of the Hindenburg Line by envelopment from
the south.</p>
<p>It was impossible to call upon the Third and Fifth Divisions for
any further effort. Their work had been most exhausting.
Furthermore, the steady drain upon their resources, after sixty
days of almost continuous battle activity, had so reduced their
fighting strength, that a very drastic re-organization had become
necessary. This could only be effected by a complete withdrawal
from the fighting zone.</p>
<p>Accordingly, arrangements were put in hand for the immediate
relief of these two Divisions. The Fifth Australian was relieved by
the Second Australian Division, and the Third Australian Division
by a Division of the Thirteenth Corps. Both the relieved Divisions,
in the course of the next few days, followed the First and Fourth
Australian Divisions into the grateful rest area which had been
provided to the west and south-west of Amiens, and before they were
again called upon for further front-line service hostilities had
ended.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<h4>MONTBREHAIN AND AFTER</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> successive withdrawals of the First, Fourth,
Third and Fifth Australian Divisions from the battle zone during
the period from September 22nd to October 2nd had been arranged
with the Fourth Army Commander about the middle of September. The
Corps had been continuously employed on front-line duty since
April, and had already accomplished a considerable advance, for
every inch of which it had been obliged to fight.</p>
<p>This consideration alone had earned for the Corps a period of
rest. But other important questions arose which affected the
situation.</p>
<p>I have mentioned that early in 1918 all Brigades of the Imperial
Service had, owing to failing man-power, been reduced from four to
three Battalions each. In this reduction the Australian Brigades
participated only to a small extent during the fighting period.
Every one of the Australian battalions had created great
traditions; regimental <em>esprit</em> and pride of unit were very
strong. The private soldier valued his Battalion colour patch
almost more than any other decoration.</p>
<p>My predecessor in the Corps Command had, during May, 1918,
directed the disbandment of one Battalion each of the 9th, 12th and
13th Brigades. This was due to the wastage resulting from the heavy
fighting by these Brigades on the Villers-Bretonneux front. The
residues of the disbanded battalions were used as drafts to
replenish the remaining three Battalions of each Brigade. It was
doubtless a measure directed by necessity, as the flow of
reinforcements was steadily diminishing.</p>
<p>Much lamentation was, however, caused among the officers and men
who thus lost their battalion identity, both among those remaining
in the field and those convalescing from wounds and sickness, who
were thereby deprived of the hope of rejoining their former
units.</p>
<p>Through all these events I became fully alive to the
difficulties which would present themselves when the evil day
should arrive on which the fate of still other battalions would
have to be decided. It was a day whose advent I was anxious to
stave off until the last possible moment.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer and autumn it became incumbent upon me to
keep a close watch upon the fighting strengths of all the 57
Australian Infantry Battalions in the field. I had to consider the
numbers actually present with the unit, the numbers likely to join
from time to time from convalescent camps and hospitals, and the
flow of new recruits from the Australian Depots in England. Almost
daily forecasts had to be made as to the probable strengths
available on a given date in all the Battalions likely to be
employed in a given operation.</p>
<p>The full official strength of a Battalion of Infantry was 1,000
at the outbreak of the war, but a reduction to 900 had been
authorized in July, 1918. No battalion in the Army was ever for
long able to maintain itself at a strength of 900. Indeed,
experience went to show that so long as the strength did not fall
below 600, a unit could quite well carry out, in battle, a normal
battalion task, provided that frequent periods of short rest could
be assured.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of September, 1918, the successful course of
the fighting, and the moderate rate of net wastage&mdash;by which I
mean the excess of battle losses over replenishments from the
rear&mdash;had convinced me that there was every reason to hope
that the strengths of the 57 battalions could be maintained at a
useful standard until the end of the campaigning season of that
year. If the war were to go on into 1919, and provided that the
Australian Corps could be kept out of the line over the three
winter months, thereby avoiding the daily wastage of trench duty, I
felt able to guarantee that by the spring of 1919 the whole of
these battalions would again have become replenished to a
sufficient extent for a spring campaign.</p>

[<i>click map to view larger image</i>]</small></p>
<br>
<p>It may have been an optimistic view; it may have savoured of a
desire to postpone the evil day. But I felt assured that the
disbandment of a number of additional battalions would seriously
impair the fighting spirit of the whole Australian Corps. I was
prepared to take the chance of being able to carry on until the end
of 1918 with the whole 57 battalions retained intact.</p>
<p>But I was not permitted to do so. At various times during the
period June to August, 1918, an unimaginative department at G H.Q.
kept harassing me with inquiries as to when it was proposed to
conform to the new Imperial organization in which all Brigades were
to be reduced to three Battalions each. These inquiries were at
first ignored, but early in September the Adjutant-General became
insistent for a reply.</p>
<p>I set out the whole position as I saw it, and strongly urged a
postponement of the question until the Corps should have completed
the vitally important series of fighting operations on which it was
then engaged. Looking back upon the course of events of that time,
it is hardly credible now that, having regard to the reasons given,
these representations should have been ignored. I procrastinated.
Suddenly I received instructions from the War Office that some
6,000 men of the Corps, who had served continuously since 1914,
were to be given six months' furlough to Australia, and that they
were to be held in readiness to entrain en route for Australia at
forty-eight hours' notice.</p>
<p>These orders were received only two days before the battle of
Hargicourt. The First and Fourth Divisions, destined to fight in
that battle, were those most affected by such a withdrawal of men,
because these Divisions contained the battalions and batteries
which had been longest in the field. I could not, obviously, take
up any attitude which would postpone the well-earned furlough of
these veterans; nor had I the smallest inclination to do so. My
case against the main proposal for an immediate extinction of
additional battalions, was, however, weakened thereby.</p>
<p>The responsible authorities overruled my objections, and on
September 19th I received peremptory instructions to disband eight
additional battalions forthwith. With many misgivings, I had no
option but to comply. I called my Divisional Commanders together,
and with them decided which battalions should suffer
extinction.</p>
<p>It was a difficult choice, and created a situation of great
difficulty. The whole of the personnel affected raised a very
subordinate but none the less determined protest. One battalion
after another very respectfully but very firmly took the stand that
they did not wish to disband, and would prefer not to fight as
dismembered and scattered portions of other battalions.</p>
<p>This attitude, perhaps, bordered upon insubordination, but it
was conceived for a very worthy purpose. It was a pathetic effort,
and elicited much sympathy from the senior Commanders and
myself.</p>
<p>On the eve of the great operations for the overthrow of the
Hindenburg Line I found myself, therefore, in a sea of troubles,
and threatened with the possibility of internal disaffection. To
outsiders who could have no understanding of the situation this
might imperil the fair fame and prestige of the Australian Army
Corps.</p>
<p>Up to this stage the Fourth Army Commander had been in no way
concerned in the matter. The pressure upon me had come from the War
Office and the Adjutant-General's Department. Lord Rawlinson's
interests, however, now became vitally involved. I submitted the
whole position to him. I pointed out how inopportune the time was
for risking trouble of this nature. The order for disbandment,
having been given, must of course stand, and obedience must be
insisted upon; but a postponement of further action for fourteen
days was desirable, if the opportunity of a decisive blow against
the enemy was not to be imperilled by an impairment of the fighting
spirit and goodwill of the Australian Corps.</p>
<p>Rawlinson accepted my views in their entirety, and used his
authority and influence with the Commander-in-Chief. A postponement
of action was authorized, and all the Battalions which had been
threatened with extinction, with one exception, were permitted to
remain intact during the remainder of the fighting period. The
exception was made in the case of the 59th and 60th Battalions (of
the 15th Brigade), whose men most loyally made no demur at the
immediate amalgamation of the two battalions for the purposes of
the forthcoming operations.</p>

<br>
<p>By the end of September, therefore, three separate factors were
operating to make a short withdrawal of the Corps from the battle
zone desirable.</p>
<p>These were, the long unbroken period of line service, the orders
for the reorganization of the Brigades on a three-Battalion basis,
and the granting of Australian furlough to the veterans.</p>
<p>These were the reasons which brought about the decision that the
whole of the Australian Corps should be sent for a period of rest
in a coastal area as soon as the battle operations on which it had
embarked had been brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>Those operations were, on October 1st, almost completed. Only
the Beaurevoir line still remained to be mastered, and the Second
Australian Division, which had been resting since its successes at
Mont St. Quentin, was available to undertake that task. For the
next three days the Australian Corps became, therefore, reduced to
only one Division (the Second Australian) in the line, with the
27th and 30th American Divisions in support.</p>
<p>The Second Division occupied the night of October 1st and the
greater part of October 2nd in the process of taking over line duty
from the Fifth Division, and in preparing for an attack timed for
the next morning upon the Beaurevoir defences. I handed over the
northern part of what had been the Australian Corps front, on the
day previous, to the 50th Division (of the Thirteenth Corps), which
had by now effected the passage of the tunnel line, and had
deployed upon my left, facing north and north-east.</p>
<p>After these adjustments were made, the Corps front, on the night
of October 2nd, extended from Mont St. Martin through the eastern
outskirts of Estr&eacute;es and Joncourt, where I joined with the
32nd Division (now belonging to the Ninth Corps). It was a frontage
of nearly 6,000 yards, an extraordinary length for the battle front
of a single Division. Our line lay parallel to and about 1,000
yards to the west of the Beaurevoir line, and the attack for next
day was designed to be delivered in a north-easterly direction. If
the Beaurevoir line itself were captured, the attack was to be
pushed on beyond, in the endeavour to sweep the enemy off the
prominent hill on which was situated the village of Beaurevoir.
Concurrently the Thirteenth Corps would attack Prospect Hill, lying
to the north-east of Gouy village.</p>
<p>The Beaurevoir line was a fully-developed defensive system, with
front, support and communication trenches, thoroughly traversed,
well wired in, and still in good condition. In 1917 it would have
been considered impossible to capture such a line of defence by
such a force on such a frontage.</p>
<p>The Second Division deployed two of its Brigades, the 5th on the
right and the 7th on the left, with the 6th Brigade in reserve. The
5th Tank Brigade, now greatly reduced in numbers, and some Whippet
Tanks co-operated in the attack. The assault was launched at 6.5
a.m. under a Field Artillery barrage. Considerable opposition was
met with. The trenches were found strongly held, particularly with
machine guns, and the uncut wire seriously impeded the
Infantry.</p>
<p>The frontal attack of the 5th Brigade, nevertheless, achieved
almost immediate success, although in some parts of the line there
were centres of resistance which had to be enveloped before they
yielded. The performance of the Tanks on this day was
disappointing. Most of the heavier Tanks were disabled by Artillery
fire, while the Whippets found the Beaurevoir trench lines too wide
to straddle. Nevertheless, the spirited action of the Artillery
made up for the loss of the assistance of the Tanks, and by 11 a.m.
the whole of the Beaurevoir line in front of the 5th Brigade had
been captured.</p>
<p>Further to the north, the 7th Brigade found the trenches almost
end on to the direction of their advance, and the battle here
speedily took on the form of pure trench fighting with bomb and
bayonet, a type of fighting in which the Australian excels. Steady
progress northwards was made.</p>
<p>The whole of the Beaurevoir line over the full extent of the
Corps front was taken before midday, and although already very
tired, the assaulting Brigades pushed on beyond, to the ascent of
the Beaurevoir spur. On a knoll at its south-western extremity
stood the stone base of the now wrecked Beaurevoir Mill, a
prominent landmark visible for miles.</p>
<p>The spur and the vicinity of the Mill were found to be strongly
held, probably by fugitives driven out that morning from the
Beaurevoir trenches. The weight of our attack spent itself on the
slopes of the spur. The 6th Brigade was therefore launched at
Beaurevoir Mill and village. Although some portion of our attack
passed the Mill and reached the village, our available Infantry
strength was not sufficient to mop it up satisfactorily, and the
Brigadier decided to establish for the night a secure line about
1,000 yards south-west of the village.</p>
<p>The total captures by the Second Division on this day exceeded a
thousand prisoners and many machine guns&mdash;an astonishing
performance for three weak brigades, fighting under open and
exposed conditions.</p>
<p>The attack on Beaurevoir hill had been undertaken chiefly to
keep the enemy engaged and on the move, while an additional
Division of the Thirteenth Corps could be brought across the line
of the tunnel and deployed into the battle line. The direction of
the attack had been to the north-east. It now became necessary to
readjust the general easterly line of advance by redistributing the
Army front between the three Corps now in line. The greater part of
October 4th was occupied in carrying out these arrangements, and
the Second Division availed itself of the period to improve its
line and the positions of parts of it by local attacks and the
capture of tactical points along its front. On this day the
Division gathered in a further 800 prisoners and five guns.</p>
<p>By nightfall on October 4th the Corps front, now reduced to
4,000 yards, ran generally north and south, well east of Wiancourt
and just east of Ramicourt. The task of the Second Division and of
the Australian Corps was completed, and in pursuance of
arrangements previously made, the initial steps were taken on that
day to hand over the Australian Corps front to the 27th and 30th
American Divisions, which had, in the days intervening since
September 29th, been reorganized and rested. They were to be given
a place in the front battle line under the direct orders of their
own Corps Headquarters (General Read).</p>
<p>To cover the interval of time necessary to enable the first of
the American Divisions (30th) to move up into line, General
Rawlinson desired me to retain control of the battle front for one
day longer, and avail myself of the time to make an endeavour to
advance our line still further to the east.</p>
<p>I selected as a suitable objective the village of Montbrehain,
which stood on a plateau that dominated any further advance.</p>
<p>The Second Division was instructed to carry out this attack
early on October 5th, and I allotted to them one company of Tanks,
which was all that could be materialized in fighting trim at such
short notice.</p>
<p>Rosenthal launched his attack at five minutes past six in the
morning of October 5th. It was the 6th Brigade which led it. The
village was full of machine guns, but the gallant Brigade dashed in
with the bayonet, and methodically worked its way through the
village to its eastern outskirts. A counter-attack developed about
noon, and for a time about 400 yards of ground had to be yielded,
but our foremost line was speedily restored with the assistance of
a battalion of the 5th Brigade.</p>
<p>By nightfall our line ran completely around the eastern
outskirts of the village of Montbrehain, the whole of which was in
our possession. We took from it over 600 prisoners belonging to
nine different German regiments.</p>
<p>What was even more interesting was that we came for the first
time in the war upon French civilians, who had been under the
domination of the enemy since the autumn of 1914. These unfortunate
folk were found hidden away in cellars and underground shelters,
and their joy at their deliverance from foreign bondage was
pathetic. It was evident that the enemy had not had time to carry
out the evacuation of the civilians, as had been his practice
throughout the whole area over which the Australian Corps had
hitherto advanced.</p>
<p>By the night of October 5th the Corps had, by the victory of
Montbrehain, advanced its line to a point six miles to the east of
the Bellicourt Tunnel, and had thereby confirmed the irretrievable
collapse of the whole of the Hindenburg defences.</p>
<p>This achievement is, above everything else, an illustration,
which should become classic, of the maxim that in war the
<i>moral</i> is to the material as three to one. The enemy had all
the advantages of position, of carefully prepared field works, of
highly-organized defences, of detailed acquaintance with our lines
of approach from the west, and of all the other tactical benefits
of the defence.</p>
<p>Yet we had the advantage of moral factors. For the past nine
weeks the enemy had suffered defeat after defeat. He had at one
time been surprised and overwhelmed. He had at another time been
driven from strong positions under conditions when surprise played
no part. He had been defeated in gunnery, in the air, and in close
Infantry fighting. The <i>moral</i> of his troops had steadily
declined. They no longer hoped for victory, but anticipated defeat.
They knew that they were a beaten army.</p>
<p>The victory won in the series of battles from September 29th to
October 5th was a victory of <i>moral</i>, the resolute
determination of our troops to overcome all obstacles prevailing
against the failing spirits of the defenders. It was a signal
illustration that no defences, however powerful, can resist an
energetically pressed assault, unless the defenders meet the attack
with equal resolution. Verdun and the cliffs of Gallipoli are
examples of resolute defence. Port Arthur and the Hindenburg line
are equally striking instances of the collapse of formidable field
works through failure of the <i>moral</i> of the defenders.</p>
<p>Montbrehain was the last Australian battle in the Great War, and
the fighting career of the Australian Army Corps had, as events
turned out, come to an end. On that same day my Second Division was
relieved by the 30th American Division, and I handed over command
of the battle front to General Read. I had borne continuous
responsibility, as a Corps Commander, for a section of the battle
front in France varying from four to eleven miles for 128
consecutive days without a break.</p>
<p>On that same day, too, Prince Max of Baden accepted the
programme of the President of the United States of America, and
requested him to take in hand the restoration of peace. On behalf
of the German Government he also asked for an immediate Armistice
on Land, Water and in the Air.</p>
<p>The long-drawn-out negotiations which followed need only a brief
reference. It was first necessary for the Entente Powers to agree
upon a common line of action; then followed negotiations between
the plenipotentiaries of the belligerents, and hostilities did not
actually cease until after the conditions of the Armistice had been
signed in the early morning of November 11th.</p>
<p>During this period of five weeks, however, fighting went on. It
was of an altogether different character from that in which the
Australian Corps had been engaged. The enemy had no line of defence
left in France. He was compelled to a retreat which became general
along his whole front, and gathered momentum day by day. He gave up
Lens, Armenti&egrave;res and the Aubers Ridge without a struggle,
thus enabling the Second and Fifth Armies to advance to the
occupation of Lille and the adjacent industrial centres.</p>
<p>A great army recoiling rapidly upon itself is beset with even
greater difficulties than an army sweeping rapidly forward. If its
retreat is not to be converted into a rout, time must be allowed
for the methodical withdrawal, in proper sequence, of the whole
complex organization in rear of the battle front. Headquarters and
hospitals, workshops and aerodromes, depots and supplies must be
dismantled, packed and re-established further in rear; guns,
transport and reserve troops must be withdrawn stage by stage, and,
last of all, the fighting line must fall back in sympathy with the
rate of withdrawal of all in rear.</p>
<p>Every hour's delay is an hour gained. Roads become congested,
bridges overtaxed, cohesion and discipline are imperilled. An
enforced withdrawal on so large a scale is one of the most
difficult operations of war.</p>
<p>The enemy's tactics during this period were, therefore, purely
those of delay, achieved by the methodical destruction of bridges,
tearing up of railways, and the blowing of great craters at every
important road intersection. These methods impeded the advance of
our armies quite as much as his rearguards, who invariably yielded
to the smallest demonstration of force.</p>
<p>Battles on the grand scale were now a thing of the past, and
from the completion of the capture of the Hindenburg defences up to
the signing of the Armistice there was no event in France of
outstanding military importance.</p>
<p>The pursuit of the enemy towards the eastern frontiers of France
and Belgium was, however, exhausting to the British and American
troops on the front which the Australian Corps had vacated. It was
only a question of time for the Corps to be again called upon, this
time to take its share of pursuit. The Armistice negotiations were
dragging out, and it was uncertain that they would be
satisfactorily concluded. The Australian Corps had had a month for
a pleasant rest along the banks of the Somme, between Amiens and
Abbeville. It had had time to carry out the extensive
reorganizations required by the War Office. On November 5th orders
came for the Corps once again to move up to the front.</p>
<p>The First and Fourth Divisions led the return to the battle
zone. The remaining three Divisions were to follow. My Corps
Headquarters, on November 10th, commenced its move to Le Cateau, to
occupy the very ch&acirc;teau which had been inhabited by General
von der Marwitz, the Commander of the Second German Army, against
whom the Australian Corps had for so long been operating. I was
actually on the way there on November 11th when the order arrived
for the cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>The Australian Army Corps was therefore not again employed,
either in the final stages of pursuing the enemy out of France, or
as part of the Army of Occupation on German territory.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Australia forwarded to me, the day after
my arrival at Le Cateau, the following message:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">The Government and the people of Australia
extend their heartiest congratulations on the triumphant conclusion
of your great efforts. I am specially requested to convey to you
their heartfelt thanks and deep admiration for your brilliant and
great leadership, and for the way in which you and the brave men
associated with you have borne the sufferings and trials of the
past four years, and in common with the troops of all the Allied
Nations brought the civilized peoples of the world through
adversity to victorious peace. On behalf of the Government and the
people of the Commonwealth, I assure you, and every Australian
soldier in the field, that the Commonwealth is full of pride and
admiration of their endurance and sacrifice. The Australian
soldiers are entitled to, and shall receive, not only the thanks of
a grateful people, but that treatment which their great services
deserve.</p>
<p align="right"><small>W.M. HUGHES.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Not long after the conclusion of hostilities I was called upon
by my Government to undertake the organization and direction of a
special department to carry out the repatriation of the whole of
the Australian Imperial Force, in Europe, Egypt, Salonika and
Mesopotamia. This compelled me to sever, with much regret, my close
and intimate association with the personnel of the Army Corps.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to England to establish the new department, I
issued the following Farewell Order:</p>
<br>
<p class="indent1">Upon relinquishing the command of the Australian
Army Corps, in order to take up the important and difficult work of
the Repatriation and Demobilization of the Australian Imperial
Force, which has been entrusted to me by the Commonwealth
Government, I desire to offer to all ranks of the Corps a heartfelt
expression of my gratitude to all for the splendid and loyal
support which they have rendered to me during the past six
months.</p>
<p class="indent1">It has been the period during which the Corps
has attained its highest development, as a fighting organism, of
cohesion and efficiency. This has been brought about alike by the
valour of the troops of all arms and services, and by the splendid
devotion of Commanders, Staffs, and Regimental Officers, and has
resulted in the series of brilliant victories which have
contributed in so high a measure to the overthrow and utter
collapse of our principal enemy.</p>
<p class="indent1">For the remainder of the period during which the
Corps will continue to act as a military body, held in readiness
for any emergency that may arise during the peace negotiations, I
am confident that every man will strive to do all in his power to
uphold the great renown which the Corps has so worthily won.</p>
<p class="indent1">But, having completed our task in the main
object which brought us from our distant homeland, and having
thereby safeguarded the future of our Nation by the conquest of our
most formidable enemy, we are now faced with another and an equally
important task, namely, to prepare ourselves to resume our duties
of citizenship and to assist individually and collectively in the
reconstruction of the Australian Nation. Our numbers and our
prestige place this opportunity in our hands, and impose upon us
this great responsibility.</p>
<p class="indent1">I feel sure that every man in the Corps will in
this also worthily respond to the call of duty, and will co-operate
loyally and self-sacrificingly in the realization of all plans and
projects which will be developed to so worthy an end.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<h4>RESULTS</h4>
<p>T<small>HE</small> time has arrived when it is proper to take
stock of gains and losses, and to endeavour to appraise, at its
true value, the work done by the Australian Army Corps during its
long-sustained effort of the last six months of its fighting
career.</p>
<p>It has become customary to regard the actual captures of
prisoners and guns as a true index of the degree of success which
has attended any series of battle operations. Every soldier knows,
however, that such a standard of judgment, applied alone, would
render but scant justice. The actual captures in any engagement
depend more upon the state of <i>moral</i> of the enemy and the
temperament of the attacking troops than upon the military quality
of the battle effort considered as a whole. While large captures
necessarily imply great victories, it does not by any means follow
that small captures imply the reverse.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, judged by such a purely arbitrary standard, the
performances of the Australian Army Corps during the period under
review are worthy of being set out in particular detail.</p>
<p>From March 27th, when Australian troops were for the first time
interposed to arrest the German advance, until October 5th, when
they were finally withdrawn from the line, the total captures made
by them were:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>No accurate record was ever kept of the capture of machine guns,
trench mortars, searchlights, vehicles and travelling kitchens or
pharmacies, nor of the quantity of Artillery ammunition, which
alone must have amounted to millions of rounds.</p>
<p>During the advance, from August 8th to October 5th, the
Australian Corps recaptured and released no less than 116 towns and
villages. Every one of these was defended more or less stoutly.
This count of them does not include a very large number of minor
hamlets, which were unnamed on the maps, nor farms, brick-fields,
factories, sugar refineries, and similar isolated groups of
buildings, every one of which had been fortified and converted by
the enemy into a stronghold of resistance.</p>
<p>Although the amount of territory reoccupied, taken by itself, is
ordinarily no criterion of value, the whole circumstances of the
relentless advance of the Australian Corps make it a convenient
standard of comparison. The total area of all the ground fought
over, from the occupation of which the enemy was ejected, amounted
in the period under consideration to 394 square miles.</p>
<p>A much more definite and crucial basis for evaluating the
military successes of the Corps is the number of enemy Divisions
actually engaged and defeated in the course of the operations. Very
accurate records of these have been kept, and every one of them was
identified by a substantial contribution to the list of prisoners
taken. An analysis of this investigation produced the following
results:</p>
<p>The total number of separate enemy divisions engaged was
thirty-nine. Of these, twenty were engaged once only, twelve were
engaged twice, six three times, and one four times. Each time
"engaged" represents a separate and distinct period of line duty
for the enemy Division referred to.</p>
<p>Up to the time of the Armistice we had definitely ascertained
that at least six of these thirty-nine enemy Divisions had been
entirely disbanded as the result of the battering which they had
received. Their numberings have already been given. It is more than
probable that several other Divisions shared the same fate, by
reason of the number of prisoners actually taken, and the other
casualties known to have been inflicted. Up to the time when the
signing of the Armistice precluded further inquiries, absolutely
conclusive evidence of their disappearance had not been
obtained.</p>
<p>In such an analysis it is possible to go even further, and to
compare the tangible results achieved with the relative strength of
the forces engaged. The Australian Army Corps of five Divisions
represented 9&frac12; per cent. of the whole of the remaining 53
Divisions of the British Army engaged on the Western Front. Its
captures in prisoners, by the same comparison, and within the
period reviewed&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., March 27th to October
5th&mdash;was 23 per cent., in guns 23&frac12; per cent., and in
territory reoccupied was 21&frac12; per cent. of the whole of the
rest of the British Army.</p>
<p>The ratio, therefore, of the results to the strengths, as
between the five Australian Divisions and the whole of the rest of
the British Army, was as follows:</p>

<td>2.47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It is not, however, by the mere numerical results disclosed by
such a comparison that the work of the Australian Army Corps should
be judged. If a broad survey be made of the whole of the 1918
campaign, I think that the decisive part which the Corps took in it
will emerge even more convincingly.</p>
<p>Such a survey will show that the whole sequence of events may be
divided into five very definite and clearly-marked stages. The
first was the arrest and bringing to naught of the great German
spring offensive; the second was the conversion of the enemy's
offensive strategy into a distinct and unqualified defensive. Next
followed the great, initial and irredeemable defeat of August 8th,
which, according to the enemy's own admissions, was the beginning
of the end. Then came the denial to the enemy of the respite which
he sought on the line of the Somme, which might well have helped
him to recover himself for another year of war; and, finally, there
was the overthrow of his great defensive system, on which he relied
as a last bulwark to safeguard his hold upon French soil, a hold
which would have enabled him to bargain for terms.</p>
<p>It must never be forgotten that whatever claims may be made to
the contrary, Germany's surrender was precipitated by reason of her
military defeat in the field. Her submarine campaign, disappointing
to her expectations as it had been, was still a potent weapon. Her
fleet was yet intact. Our blockade was grievous, but she did in
fact survive it, even though it continued in force for a full eight
months after her surrender. The defection of Bulgaria and the
collapse of Turkey might conceivably be a source of increased
military strength, even if one of greater political weakness. Had
she been able to hold us at bay in France and Belgium for but
another month or six weeks, she could have been assured of a
respite of three months of winter in which to organize a levy <i>en
masse</i>. Who can say that the stress of another winter and the
prospect of another year of war might not have destroyed the
Entente combination against her?</p>
<p>On these grounds I believe that the real and immediate reason
for the precipitate surrender of Germany on October 5th, 1918, was
the defeat of her Army in the field. It followed so closely upon
the breaching of the Hindenburg defences on September 29th to
October 4th, that it cannot be dissociated from that event as a
final determining cause.</p>
<p>Whether this view be correct or not, I think that the claim may
fairly be made for the Australian Army Corps, that in each of the
stages of the operations which led to this military overthrow, the
Corps played an important, and in some of them a predominating,
part. No better testimony for such a conclusion can be adduced than
the admissions of Ludendorff himself.</p>
<p>Narrowing our survey of the closing events of the campaign to a
consideration of the fighting activities of the Australian Corps, I
would like to emphasize the remarkable character of that effort.
Deprived of the advantage of a regular inflow of trained recruits,
and relying practically entirely for any replenishments upon the
return of its own sick and wounded, the Corps was able to maintain
an uninterrupted fighting activity over a period of six months. For
the last sixty days of this period the Corps maintained an
unchecked advance of thirty-seven miles against the powerful and
determined opposition of a still formidable enemy, who employed all
the mechanical and scientific resources at his disposal.</p>
<p>Such a result alone, considered in the abstract and quite apart
from any comparison with the performances of other forces, is a
testimony, on the one hand, to the pre-eminent fighting qualities
of the Australian soldier considered individually, and, on the
other hand, to the collective capacity and efficiency of the
military effort made by the Corps. I doubt whether there is any
parallel for such a performance in the whole range of military
history.</p>
<p>As regards the troops themselves, the outstanding feature of the
campaign was their steadily rising <i>moral</i>. Always high, it
was, in spite of fatigue and stress, never higher than in the
closing days. A stage had been reached when they regarded their
adversary no longer with cautious respect but with undisguised
contempt.</p>
<p>On the part of the troops it was a remarkable feat of physical
and mental endurance to face again and yet again the stress of
battle. To the infantry a certain measure of periodical rest was
accorded, but the Artillery and technical services had scarcely any
respite at all. Almost every day of the whole period they worked
and fought, night and day, under the fire of the enemy's batteries,
and under his drenching, suffocating gas attacks, for our battery
positions were the favourite targets for his gas bombardments.</p>
<p>On the part of the staffs it was a period of ceaseless toil,
both mental and physical. The perfection of the staff work, its
precision, its completeness, its rapidity, its whole-souled
devotion to the service of the troops, were the necessary
conditions for the victories which were won.</p>
<p>Another outstanding feature was the uniformity of standard
achieved by all the five Divisions, as well as the wonderful
comradeship which they displayed towards each other. Omitting
altogether the performances of any one of them in the previous
years of the war, it is noteworthy that all so fully seized the
opportunities that presented themselves, that each could boast of
outstanding achievements during this period&mdash;the First
Division for its capture of Lihons and the battles of Chuignes and
Hargicourt, the Second Division for Mont St. Quentin and
Montbrehain, the Third for Bray, Bouchavesnes and Bony, the Fourth
for Hamel and Hargicourt, and the Fifth for P&eacute;ronne and
Bellicourt.</p>

<p>I must also pass in brief review the losses which the Corps
suffered during its advance. From August 8th to October 5th the
total battle casualties were as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>Averaging these losses over all five Divisions for the whole
period, they amount to a wastage from all causes of seventy men per
Division per day, which must be regarded as extraordinarily
moderate, having regard to the strenuous nature of the fighting,
the great results achieved, and the much higher rate of losses
incurred by Australian troops during the previous years of the war.
Even during periods of sedentary trench warfare the losses averaged
forty per Division per day.</p>
<p>The total losses of the Army Corps during this period were,
indeed, only a small fraction of Australia's contribution to the
casualty roll for the whole period of the war. It was the least
costly period, for Australia, of all the fighting that her soldiers
underwent. Had it been otherwise, the effort could not have been
maintained for so long, nor could the spirit of the troops have
been sustained. It was the low cost of victory after victory which
spurred them on to still greater efforts.</p>
<p>Of the causes which contributed to so gratifying a result, much
credit must be given to the great development in 1918 of mechanical
aids, in the form of Tanks, and to a considerable augmentation of
aeroplanes, Artillery and Lewis guns. Of all these the Corps proved
eager to avail itself to the full.</p>
<p>But the main cause is, after all, the recognition of a principle
of text-book simplicity, which is that a vigorous offensive is in
the long run cheaper than a timorous defensive. No war can be
decided by defensive tactics. The fundamental doctrine of the
German conception of war was the pursuit of the unrelenting
offensive; it was only when the Entente Armies, on their part, were
able and willing themselves to put such a doctrine into practice
that our formidable enemies were overcome.</p>
<p>It may be that hereafter I may be charged with responsibility
for so relentlessly and for so long committing the troops of the
Corps to a sustained aggressive policy. Such criticisms have
already been whispered in some quarters. But I am sure that they
will not be shared by any of the men whom it was my privilege to
command. They knew that an offensive policy was the cheapest
policy, and the proof that they accepted it as the right one was
their ever-rising <i>moral</i> as the campaign developed.</p>
<p>"Feed your troops on victory", is a maxim which does not appear
in any text-book, but it is nevertheless true. The aim and end of
all the efforts and of all the heavy sacrifices of the Australian
nation was victory in the field. Nothing that could be done could
lead more swiftly and more directly to its fulfilment than an
energetic offensive policy. The troops themselves recognized this.
They learned to believe, because of success heaped upon success,
that they were invincible. They were right, and I believe that I
was right in shaping a course which would give them the opportunity
of proving it.</p>
<p>There are some aspects of the Australian campaign to which,
before closing this memoir, I should like to make brief reference.
Success depended first and foremost upon the military proficiency
of the Australian private soldier and his glorious spirit of
heroism. I do not propose to attempt here an exhaustive analysis of
the causes which led to the making of him. The democratic
institutions under which he was reared, the advanced system of
education by which he was trained&mdash;teaching him to think for
himself and to apply what he had been taught to practical
ends&mdash;the instinct of sport and adventure which is his
national heritage, his pride in his young country, and the
opportunity which came to him of creating a great national
tradition, were all factors which made him what he was.</p>
<p>Physically the Australian Army was composed of the flower of the
youth of the continent. A volunteer army&mdash;the only purely
volunteer army that fought in the Great War&mdash;it was composed
of men carefully selected according to a high physical standard,
from which, happily, no departure was made, even although
recruiting began to fall off in the last year of the war, and there
were some who had proposed a more lenient recruiting examination.
The cost to Australia of delivering each fighting man, fully
trained, to the battle front was too great to permit of any doubt
whether the physical quality of the raw material would survive the
wear and tear of war.</p>
<p>Mentally, the Australian soldier was well endowed. In him there
was a curious blend of a capacity for independent judgment with a
readiness to submit to self-effacement in a common cause. He had a
personal dignity all his own. He had the political sense highly
developed, and was always a keen critic of the way in which his
battalion or battery was "run", and of the policies which guided
his destinies from day to day.</p>
<p>His intellectual gifts and his "handiness" made him an apt
pupil. It was always a delight to see the avidity with which he
mastered the technique of the weapons which were placed in his
hands. Machine guns, Lewis guns, Mills' bombs, Stokes' mortars,
rifle grenades, flares, fuses, detonators, Very lights, signal
rockets, German machine guns, German stick bombs, never for long
remained a mystery to him.</p>
<p>At all schools and classes he proved a diligent scholar, and
astonished his instructors by the speed with which he absorbed and
bettered his instruction. Conservatism in military methods was no
part of his creed. He was always mentally alert to adopt new ideas
and often to invent them.</p>
<p>His adaptability spared him much hardship. He knew how to make
himself comfortable. To light a fire and cook his food was a
natural instinct. A sheet of corrugated iron, a batten or two, and
a few strands of wire were enough to enable him to fabricate a home
in which he could live at ease.</p>
<p>Psychologically, he was easy to lead but difficult to drive. His
imagination was readily fired. War was to him a game, and he played
for his side with enthusiasm. His bravery was founded upon his
sense of duty to his unit, comradeship to his fellows, emulation to
uphold his traditions, and a combative spirit to avenge his
hardships and sufferings upon the enemy.</p>
<p>Taking him all in all, the Australian soldier was, when once
understood, not difficult to handle. But he required a sympathetic
handling, which appealed to his intelligence and satisfied his
instinct for a "square deal".</p>
<p>Very much and very stupid comment has been made upon the
discipline of the Australian soldier. That was because the very
conception and purpose of discipline have been misunderstood. It
is, after all, only a means to an end, and that end is the power to
secure co-ordinated action among a large number of individuals for
the achievement of a definite purpose. It does not mean lip
service, nor obsequious homage to superiors, nor servile observance
of forms and customs, nor a suppression of individuality.</p>
<p>Such may have been the outward manifestations of discipline in
times gone by. If they achieved the end in view, it must have been
because the individual soldier had acquired in those days no
capacity to act intelligently and because he could be considered
only in the mass. But modern war makes high demands upon the
intelligence of the private soldier and upon his individual
initiative. Any method of training which tends to suppress that
individuality will tend to reduce his efficiency and value. The
proverbial "iron discipline" of the Prussian military ideal
ultimately broke down completely under the test of a great war.</p>
<p>In the Australian Forces no strong insistence was ever made upon
the mere outward forms of discipline. The soldier was taught that
personal cleanliness was necessary to ensure his health and
well-being, that a soldierly bearing meant a moral and physical
uplift which would help him to rise superior to his squalid
environment, that punctuality meant economy of effort, that
unquestioning obedience was the only road to successful collective
action. He acquired these military qualities because his
intelligence taught him that the reasons given him were true
ones.</p>
<p>In short, the Australian Army is a proof that individualism is
the best and not the worst foundation upon which to build up
collective discipline. The Australian is accustomed to team-work.
He learns it in the sporting field, in his industrial
organizations, and in his political activities. The team-work which
he developed in the war was of the highest order of efficiency.
Each man understood his part and understood also that the part
which others had to play depended upon the proper performance of
his own.</p>
<p>The gunner knew that the success of the infantry depended upon
his own punctilious performance of his task, its accuracy, its
punctuality, its conscientious thoroughness. The runner knew what
depended upon the rapid delivery at the right destination of the
message which he carried. The mule driver knew that the load of
ammunition entrusted to him must be delivered, at any sacrifice, to
its destined battery; the infantryman knew that he must be at his
tape line at the appointed moment, and that he must not overrun his
allotted objective.</p>
<p>The truest test of battle discipline was the confidence which
every leader in the field always felt that he could rely upon every
man to perform the duty which had been prescribed for him, as long
as breath lasted, and that he would perform it faithfully even when
there was no possibility of any supervision.</p>
<p>Thus the sense of duty was always very high, and so also was the
instinct of comradeship. A soldier, a platoon, a whole battalion
would sooner sacrifice themselves than "let down" a comrade or
another unit. There was no finer example of individual
self-sacrifice, for the benefit of comrades, than the
Stretcher-bearer service, which suffered exceedingly in its noble
work of succouring the wounded, and exposed itself unflinchingly to
every danger.</p>
<p>The relations between the officers and men of the Australian
Army were also of a nature which is deserving of notice. From
almost the earliest days of the war violence was done to a deep
rooted tradition of the British Army, which discouraged any
promotion from the ranks, and stringently forbade, in cases where
it was given, promotion in the same unit. It was rare to recognize
the distinguished service of a ranker; it was impossible for him to
secure a commission in his own regiment.</p>
<p>The Australian Imperial Force changed all that. Those privates,
corporals and sergeants who displayed, under battle conditions, a
notable capacity for leadership were earmarked for preferment. If
their standard of education was good, they received commissions as
soon as there were vacancies to fill; if not, they were sent to
Oxford or Cambridge to be given an opportunity of improving both
their general and their special military knowledge.</p>
<p>As a general rule, they came back as commissioned officers to
the very unit in which they had enlisted or served. They afforded
to all its men a tangible and visible proof of the recognition of
merit and capacity, and their example was always a powerful
stimulus to all their former comrades.</p>
<p>There was thus no officer caste, no social distinction in the
whole force. In not a few instances, men of humble origin and
belonging to the artisan class rose, during the war, from privates
to the command of Battalions. The efficiency of the force suffered
in no way in consequence. On the contrary, the whole Australian
Army became automatically graded into leaders and followers
according to the individual merits of every man, and there grew a
wonderful understanding between them.</p>
<p>The duties and responsibilities of the officers were always put
upon a high plane. They had, during all military service with
troops, to dress like the men, to live among them in the trenches,
to share their hardships and privations, and to be responsible for
their welfare. No officer dared to look after his own comfort until
every man or horse or mule had been fed and quartered, as well as
the circumstances of the moment permitted. The battle prowess of
the Australian regimental officer and the magnificent example he
set have become household words.</p>

<br>
<p>Then there must be a word of recognition of the work of the
devoted and able Staffs. It was upon them, after all, that the
principal burden of the campaign rested. Upon them, their skill and
industry, depended the adequacy of all supplies and their proper
distribution, the precision of all arrangements for battle, the
accuracy of all maps, orders and instructions, the clearness of
messages and reports, the completeness of the information on which
the Commander must base his decisions, and the correct calculations
of time and space for the movement of troops, guns and transport.
Their watchword was "efficiency".</p>
<p>"The Staff Officer is the servant of the troops." This was the
ritual pronounced at the initiation of every Staff Officer. It was
a doctrine which contributed powerfully to the success of the staff
work as a whole. It meant that the Staff Officer's duties extended
far beyond the mere transmission of orders. It became his business
to see that they were understood, and rightly acted upon, and to
assist in removing every kind of difficulty in their due execution.
The importance of accurate and reliable staff work can be
understood when it is realized that no mistake can happen without
ultimately imposing an added stress upon the most subordinate and
most helpless of all the components of an Army&mdash;the private
soldier. An error in a clock time, the miscarriage of a message,
the neglect to issue an instruction, a misreading of an order, an
omission from a list of names, a mistake in a computation, an
incomplete inventory, are bound in the long run to involve an added
burden somewhere upon some private soldier.</p>
<p>The Staff of the Australian Army Corps, its Divisions and
Brigades, consisted during the last six months almost entirely of
Australians, many of them belonging to the permanent military
forces of the Commonwealth, but more still men who, before the war,
followed civilian occupations. Among both categories the quality of
the staff work steadily grew in efficiency, speed and accuracy, and
during the last period of active fighting it reached a very high
standard indeed.</p>
<p>Had it been otherwise, I could not have carried out either the
rapid preparations for several of the greater battles, or the
frequent and complex interchanges of Divisions which alone rendered
it possible for me to keep up a continuous pressure on the enemy,
or the readjustments throughout the whole of the very large area
always under my jurisdiction which became necessary as the advance
proceeded.</p>
<p>No reference to the staff work of the Australian Corps during
the period of my command would be complete without a tribute to the
work and personality of Brigadier-General T.A. Blamey, my Chief of
Staff. He possessed a mind cultured far above the average, widely
informed, alert and prehensile. He had an infinite capacity for
taking pains. A Staff College graduate, but not on that account a
pedant, he was thoroughly versed in the technique of staff work,
and in the minuti&aelig; of all procedure.</p>
<p>He served me with an exemplary loyalty, for which I owe him a
debt of gratitude which cannot be repaid. Our temperaments adapted
themselves to each other in a manner which was ideal. He had an
extraordinary faculty of self-effacement, posing always and
conscientiously as the instrument to give effect to my policies and
decisions. Really helpful whenever his advice was invited, he never
obtruded his own opinions, although I knew that he did not always
agree with me.</p>
<p>Some day the orders which he drafted for the long series of
history-making military operations upon which we collaborated will
become a model for Staff Colleges and Schools for military
instruction. They were accurate, lucid in language, perfect in
detail, and always an exact interpretation of my intention. It was
seldom that I thought that my orders or instructions could have
been better expressed, and no Commander could have been more
exacting than I was in the matter of the use of clear language to
express thought.</p>
<p>Blamey was a man of inexhaustible industry, and accepted every
task with placid readiness. Nothing was ever too much trouble. He
worked late and early, and set a high standard for the remainder of
the large Corps Staff of which he was the head. The personal
support which he accorded to me was of a nature of which I could
always feel the real substance. I was able to lean on him in times
of trouble, stress and difficulty, to a degree which was an
inexpressible comfort to me.</p>
<p>To the Commanders of the Five Divisions I have already made
detailed allusion. They were all renowned leaders. To all the
Brigadiers of Infantry and Artillery and to the Heads of the
Administrative Services who laboured under them, the limitations of
space forbid my making any individual reference. But they were all
of them men to whose splendid services Australia owes a deep debt
of gratitude. In their hands the honour of Australia's fighting men
and the prestige of her arms were in safe keeping.</p>
<p>None but men of character and self-devotion could have carried
the burden which they had to bear during the last six months of the
war. In spite of stress and difficulty, unremitting toil and wasted
effort, weary days and sleepless nights, fresh task piling upon the
task but just begun, labouring even harder during periods of
so-called rest than when their troops were actually in the line,
this gallant band of leaders remained steadfast of purpose, never
faltered, never lost their faith in final victory, never failed to
impress their optimism and their unflinching fighting spirit upon
the men whom they commanded.</p>
<br>
<p>It may be appropriate to end this memoir on a personal note. I
have permitted myself a tone of eulogy for the triumphant
achievements of the Australian Army Corps in 1918, which I have
endeavoured faithfully to portray. Let it not be assumed on that
account that the humble part which it fell to my lot to perform
afforded me any satisfaction or prompted any enthusiasm for war.
Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>From the far-off days of 1914, when the call first came, until
the last shot was fired, every day was filled with loathing,
horror, and distress. I deplored all the time the loss of precious
life and the waste of human effort. Nothing could have been more
repugnant to me than the realization of the dreadful inefficiency
and the misspent energy of war. Yet it had to be, and the thought
always uppermost was the earnest prayer that Australia might for
ever be spared such a horror on her own soil.</p>
<p>There is, in my belief, only one way to realize such a prayer.
The nation that wishes to defend its land and its honour must spare
no effort, refuse no sacrifice to make itself so formidable that no
enemy will dare to assail it. A League of Nations may be an
instrument for the preservation of peace, but an efficient Army is
a far more potent one.</p>
<p>The essential components of such an Army are a qualified Staff,
an adequate equipment and a trained soldiery. I state them in what
I believe to be their order of importance, and my belief is based
upon the lessons which this war has taught me. In that way alone
can Australia secure the sanctity of her territory and the
preservation of her independent liberties.</p>
<p>Such a creed is not militarism, but is of the very essence of
national self-preservation. For long years before the war it was
the creed of a small handful of men in Australia, who braved the
indifference and even the ridicule of public opinion in order to
try to qualify themselves for the test when it should come. Four
dreadful years of war have served to convince me of the truth of
that creed, and to confirm me in the belief that the men of the
coming generation, if they love their country, must take up the
burden which these men have had to bear.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B</h3>
<br>
<p>I<small>N</small> order to illustrate the nature of the
individual fighting carried out by the Australian Corps, during the
period covered by this book, the following very small selection has
been made from the official records of deeds of gallantry by
individual soldiers. In every one of these twenty-nine cases, the
<small>VICTORIA CROSS</small> has been awarded by His Majesty the
King:</p>
<p>No. 4061, <small>SERGEANT STANLEY ROBERT MACDOUGALL</small>,<br>
47th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"At <small>DERNANCOURT</small>, on morning of 28th
March, 1918, the enemy attacked our line, and his first wave
succeeded in gaining an entry. Sergt. MacDougall, who was at a post
in a flank company, realized the situation, and at once charged the
enemy's second wave single-handed with rifle and bayonet, killing 7
and capturing Machine Gun which they had. This he turned on to
them, firing from the hip, causing many casualties, and routing
that wave. He then turned his attention to those who had entered,
until his ammunition had run out, all the time firing at close
quarters, when he seized a bayonet and charged again, killing three
men and a German officer, who was just about to kill one of our
officers. He then used a Lewis Gun on the enemy, killing many and
enabling us to capture 33 prisoners. His prompt action saved the
line and enabled us to stop the enemy advance."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT PERCY VALENTINE STORKEY</small>,<br>
19th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"Lieut. Storkey was in charge of a platoon which took
part in the attack at <small>BOIS DE HANGARD</small> on morning of
7th April, 1918. On emerging from the wood, the enemy trench line
was encountered, and Lieut. Storkey found himself with 6 men. While
continuing his move forward, a large enemy party&mdash;about 80 to
100 strong&mdash;armed with several machine guns, was noticed to be
holding up the advance of the troops on the right. Lieut. Storkey
immediately decided to attack this party from the flank and rear,
and while moving forward to the attack, was joined by Lieut.
Lipscomb and four men. Under the leadership of Lieut. Storkey, this
small party of 2 officers and 10 other ranks charged the enemy
position with fixed bayonets, driving the enemy out, killing and
wounding about 30 and capturing the remainder, viz.: 3 officers and
50 men, also one machine gun."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT CLIFFORD WILLIAM KING SADLIER</small>,<br>
51st Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For conspicuous gallantry on the night of 24-25th
April, 1918, during a counter-attack by his Battalion on strong
enemy positions south of <small>VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small>, east of
Amiens. Lieut. Sadlier's platoon, which was on the left of the
Battalion, had to advance through a wood, where they encountered a
strong enemy machine-gun post, which caused casualties and
prevented the platoon from advancing. Although himself wounded,
this officer at once collected his bombing section, and led them
against the machine guns, succeeding in killing the crews and
capturing two of the guns. By this time Lieut. Sadlier's party were
all casualties, and he alone attacked a third enemy machine gun
with his revolver, killing the crew of four and taking the gun. In
doing so, he was again wounded, and unable to go on."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 1914, <small>SERGEANT WILLIAM RUTHVEN</small>,<br>
22nd Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For most conspicuous bravery and daring in action
during the attack at <small>VILLE-SUR-ANCRE</small>, near Albert,
on 19th May, 1918. During the advance Sergeant Ruthven's Company
suffered numerous casualties, and his Company Commander was
severely wounded. He then assumed command of his portion of the
assault, took charge of the Company Headquarters, and rallied the
sections in his vicinity. As the leading wave approached its
objective, it was subjected to heavy fire from an enemy Machine Gun
at 30 to 40 yards' range, directly in front. This N.C.O., without
hesitation, at once sprang out, threw a bomb which landed beside
the post, and immediately rushed the position, bayoneting one of
the crew and capturing the gun. He then encountered some of the
enemy coming out of a shelter. He wounded two, captured six others
in the same position, and handed them over to an escort from the
leading wave, which had now reached the objective. Sergeant Ruthven
then reorganized our men in his vicinity, and established a post in
the second objective. Enemy movement was then seen in a sunken road
about 150 yards distant. Without hesitation, and armed only with a
revolver, he went over the open alone and rushed the position,
shooting two Germans who refused to come out of their dug-out. He
then single-handed mopped up this post, and captured the whole of
the garrison, amounting in all to 32, and kept them until
assistance arrived to escort them back to our lines. During the
remainder of the day this gallant N.C.O. set a splendid example of
leadership, moving up and down his position under fire, supervising
consolidation and encouraging his men."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 1327, <small>CORPORAL PHILLIP DAVEY</small>, M.M.,<br>
10th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"In a daylight operation against the enemy position
near <small>MERRIS</small> on June 28th, 1918, Corporal Davey's
platoon advanced 200 yards and captured part, of enemy line. While
the platoon was consolidating, the enemy pushed a machine gun
forward under cover of a hedge, and opened fire from close range,
inflicting heavy casualties and hampering work. Alone Corporal
Davey moved forward in the face of a fierce point-blank fire, and
attacked the gun with hand grenades, putting half the crew out of
action. Having used all available grenades, he returned to the
original jumping-off trench, secured a further supply and again
attacked the gun, the crew of which had in the meantime been
reinforced. He killed the crew, 8 in all, and captured the gun.
This gallant N.C.O. then mounted the gun in the new post and used
it in repelling a determined counter-attack, during which he was
severely wounded in both legs, back and stomach."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 3399, <small>PRIVATE (LANCE-CORPORAL) THOMAS LESLIE<br>
AXFORD</small>, M.M.,<br>
16th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For conspicuous gallantry and initiative during the
operations against <small>VAIRE</small> and <small>HAMEL
WOODS</small>, east of Corbie, on the morning of the 4th July,
1918. When the barrage lifted and the Infantry advance commenced,
the platoon of which he is a member was able to reach the first
enemy defences through gaps which had been cut in the wires. The
adjoining platoon got delayed in uncut barbed wire. This delay
enabled the enemy machine guns to get into action, and enabled them
to inflict a number of casualties among the men struggling through
the wires, including the Company Commander, who was killed.
L.-Corporal Axford, with great initiative and magnificent courage,
at once dashed to the flank, threw his bombs amongst the
machine-gun crews; followed up his bombs by jumping into the
trench, and charging with his bayonet. Unaided he killed ten of the
enemy and took 6 prisoners; he threw the machine guns over the
parapet, and called out to the delayed platoon to come on. He then
rejoined his own platoon, and fought with it during the remainder
of the operations. Prior to the incidents above-mentioned, he had
assisted in the laying out of the tapes for the jumping-off
position, which was within 100 yards of the enemy. When the tapes
were laid, he remained out as a special patrol to ensure that the
enemy did not discover any unusual movement on our
side."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 1936, <small>PRIVATE HENRY DALZIEL</small>,<br>
15th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For his magnificent bravery and devotion to duty
during operations near <small>HAMEL WOOD</small>, east of Corbie,
on 4th July, 1918. He was No. 2 of a Lewis Gun Section, and at the
commencement of our advance his Company met with determined
resistance from Pear Trench strong point, which was strongly
garrisoned and manned by numerous machine guns. This strong point,
undamaged by our artillery fire, was protected by strong wire
entanglements. A heavy concentration of machine-gun fire caused
heavy casualties and held up our advance. His Lewis Gun came into
action and silenced enemy guns in one direction, when another enemy
gun opened up from another direction. Private Dalziel dashed at it,
and with his revolver killed or captured the entire crew and gun,
and allowed our advance to continue. He was severely wounded in the
hand, but carried on and took part in the capture of the final
objective. He twice went over open ground under heavy enemy
artillery and machine-gun fire to where our aeroplanes had dropped
some boxes of ammunition, and carried back a box on each occasion
to his gun, and though suffering from considerable loss of blood,
he filled magazines and served his gun until severely wounded
through the head."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 1689<small>A, CORPORAL WALTER ERNEST BROWN</small>,
D.C.M.,<br>
20th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For gallant service on the morning of 6th July, 1918,
north-east of <small>VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small>, east of Amiens.
This N.C.O. was one of an advanced party from his Battalion making
arrangements with the Battalion then in the line for relief by his
own Battalion. As such he was under no obligation to participate in
any offensive operations before his Battalion took over the line.
During the night of 5th-6th July the Company to which he was
attached carried out a minor operation resulting in the capture of
a small system of enemy trench. Early on the morning of 6th July an
enemy strong post, about 70 yards distant, caused the occupants of
the newly-captured trench great inconvenience by persistent
sniping. It was decided to rush this post. Hearing of this,
Corporal Brown, on his own initiative, crept out along the shallow
trench towards the enemy post, and then made a dash across No Man's
Land towards this post. An enemy machine gun opened fire from
another trench, and he had to take cover by lying down. He later
made another dash forward, and succeeded in reaching his objective.
With a Mills grenade in his hand, he stood at the door of a dug-out
and called on the occupants to surrender. One of the enemy rushed
out, a scuffle ensued, and Corporal Brown knocked him down with his
fist. Loud cries of 'Kamerad' were then heard, and from the dug-out
an officer and eleven other ranks appeared. Driving them before
him, Corporal Brown brought back the complete party as prisoners to
our line."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT ALBERT CHALMERS BORELLA</small>, M.M.,<br>
26th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For exceptional gallantry in the attack near
<small>VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small>, on the 17th-18th July, 1918.
Whilst leading his platoon with the first wave, Lieut. Borella
noticed an enemy machine gun firing through our barrage&mdash;he
ran out ahead of his men into the barrage, shot two German machine
gunners with his revolver, and captured the gun. He then led his
party, now reduced to ten men and two Lewis Guns, further on,
against <small>JAFFA TRENCH</small>, which was very strongly held,
but using his revolver, and later a rifle, with great effect,
Lieut. Borella shot down the enemy right and left, and set such a
splendid example, that the garrison were quickly shot and captured.
Two large dug-outs were bombed here and thirty prisoners taken.
After reorganization the enemy counter-attacked twice in strong
force, on the second occasion outnumbering Lieut. Borella's platoon
by ten to one; but he showed such coolness and determination, that
the men put up an heroic resistance, and twice repulsed the enemy
with very heavy loss. It is estimated that from 100 to 150 Germans
were killed in this vicinity. When Lieut. Borella refused his left
flank about 40 yards during the first counter-attack he sent his
men back one at a time, and was himself the last to leave, under
heavy fire."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT ALFRED EDWARD GABY</small>,<br>
28th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"During the attack east of
<small>VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small>, near Amiens, on the morning of
8th August, 1918, this officer led his Company with great dash,
being well in front. On reaching the wire in front of the
enemy-trench, strong opposition was encountered. The enemy were
holding a strong point in force about 40 yards beyond the wire, and
commanded the gap with four machine guns and rifles. The advance
was at once checked. Lieut. Gaby found another gap in the wire, and
entirely by himself approached the strong point, while machine guns
and rifles were still being fired from it. Running along the
parapet, still alone, and at point-blank range, he emptied his
revolver into the garrison, drove the crews from their guns, and
compelled the surrender of 50 of the enemy, with four machine guns.
He then quickly reorganized his men and led them on to his final
objective, which he captured and consolidated. On the morning of
the 11th August, 1918, during an attack east of
<small>FRAMERVILLE</small>, Lieut. Gaby again led his Company with
great dash on to the objective. The enemy brought heavy rifle and
machine-gun fire to bear upon the line, but in the face of this
heavy fire Lieut. Gaby walked along his line of posts, encouraging
his men to quickly consolidate the line. While engaged on this duty
he was killed by an enemy sniper."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 2742, <small>PRIVATE ROBERT MATTHEW BEATHAM</small>,<br>
8th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during
the attack north of <small>ROSI&Egrave;RES</small> on 9th August,
1918. Private Beatham showed such heroism and courage, that he
inspired all officers and men in his vicinity in a wonderful
manner, When the advance was held up by heavy machine-gun fire,
Private Beatham dashed forward and, assisted by one man, bombed and
fought the crews of four enemy machine guns, killing ten of them
and capturing ten others. The bravery of the action greatly
facilitated the advance of the whole Battalion and prevented
casualties. In fighting the crew of the first gun he was shot
through the right leg, but continued in the advance. When the final
objective was reached and fierce fighting was taking place, he
again dashed forward and bombed the machine gun that was holding
our men off, getting riddled with bullets and killed in doing
so."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 506, <small>SERGEANT PERCY CLYDE STATTON</small>, M.M.,<br>
40th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For most conspicuous gallantry and initiative in
action near <small>PROYART</small> on 12th August, 1918. The
platoon commanded by Sergeant Statton reached its objective, but
the remainder of the Battalion was held up by heavy machine-gun
fire. He skilfully engaged two machine-gun posts with Lewis Gun
fire, enabling the remainder of his Battalion to advance. The
advance of the Battalion on his left had been brought to a
standstill by the heavy enemy machine-gun fire, and the first of
our assaulting detachments to reach the machine-gun posts were put
out of action in taking the first gun. Armed only with a revolver,
in broad daylight, Sergeant Statton at once rushed four enemy
machine-gun posts in succession, disposing of two of them, killing
five of the enemy. The remaining two posts retired and were wiped
out by Lewis Gun fire. This N.C.O.'s act had a very inspiring
effect on the troops who had been held up, and they cheered him as
he returned. By his daring exploit he enabled the attacking troops
to gain their objective. Later in the evening, under heavy
machine-gun fire, he went out again and brought in two
badly-wounded men."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT LAWRENCE DOMINIC MCCARTHY</small>,<br>
16th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"This officer is especially brought to notice for his
wonderful gallantry, initiative and leadership on the morning of
the 23rd August, 1918, when an attack was being made near
<small>MADAME WOOD</small>, west of Vernandivukkers. The objectives
of this Battalion were attained without serious opposition. The
Battalion on the left flank were less fortunate, Here several
well-posted machine-gun posts were holding up the attack, and heavy
fire was being brought to bear on our left flank. When Lieut.
McCarthy realized the situation, he at once engaged the nearest
machine-gun post; but still the attacking troops failed to get
forward. This officer then determined to attack the nearest post.
Leaving his men to continue the fire fight, he, with two others,
dashed across the open and dropped into a disused trench which had
been blocked. One of his two men was killed whilst doing this. He
was now right under the block over which the enemy machine gun was
firing. The presence of head cover prevented the use of bombs. He
therefore tunnelled a hole through the bottom of the block, through
which he inserted his head and one arm. He at once shot dead the
two men firing the gun. He then crawled through the hole he had
made, and by himself charged down the trench. He threw his limited
number of Mills bombs among the German garrison and inflicted more
casualties. He then came in contact with two German officers, who
fired on him with their revolvers. One of these he shot dead with
his revolver, the other he seriously wounded. He then charged down
the trench, using his revolver and throwing enemy stick bombs, and
capturing three more enemy machine guns. At this stage, some 700
yards from his starting point, he was joined by the N.C.O., whom he
had outdistanced when he crawled through the hole in the trench
block mentioned above. Together they continued to bomb up the
trench, until touch was established with the Lancashire Fusiliers,
and in the meanwhile yet another machine gun had been captured. A
total of 5 machine guns and 50 prisoners (37 unwounded and 13
wounded) was captured, while Lieut. McCarthy during his most
amazing and daring feat had, single-handed, killed 20 of the enemy.
Having cleared up a dangerous situation, he proceeded to establish
a garrison in the line. Whilst doing this he saw a number of the
enemy getting away from neighbouring trenches. He at once seized a
Lewis Gun and inflicted further casualties on the
enemy."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT WILLIAM DONOVAN JOYNT</small>,<br>
8th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during
the attack on <small>HERLEVILLE WOOD</small>, near Chuignes, on
23rd August, 1918. Early in the advance Lieut. Joynt's Company
Commander was killed; he immediately took charge of the Company and
led them with courage and skill. A great deal of the success of the
operation in this portion of the sector was directly due to his
magnificent work. When the advance was commenced the Battalion was
moving into support to another Battalion. On approaching Herleville
Wood, the troops of the leading Battalion lost all their officers
and became disorganized. Under very heavy fire, and having no
leaders, they appeared certain to be annihilated. Lieut. Joynt
grasped the situation, and rushed forward in the teeth of very
heavy machine-gun and artillery fire over the open. He got the
remaining men under control, and worked them into a piece of dead
ground, until he could reform them. He man&oelig;uvred his own men
forward, and linked them up with the men of the other Battalion. He
then made a personal reconnaissance, and found that the fire from
the wood was holding the whole advance up, the troops on his flanks
suffering very heavy casualties. Dashing out in front of his men,
he called them on, and by sheer force of example inspired them into
a magnificent frontal bayonet attack on the wood. The audacity of
the move over the open staggered the enemy, and Lieut. Joynt
succeeded in penetrating the wood and working through it. By his
leadership and courage a very critical situation was saved, and on
this officer rests to the greatest extent the success of the
Brigade's attack. When the Battalion on our left was held up on
Plateau Wood, and was suffering severe casualties, Lieut. Joynt,
with a small party of volunteers, worked right forward against
heavy opposition, and by means of hand-to-hand fighting forced his
way round the rear of the wood, penetrating it from that side, and
demoralizing the enemy to such an extent that a very stubborn and
victorious defensive was changed into an abject surrender. He was
always in the hardest pressed parts of the line, and seemed to bear
a charmed life. He was constantly ready to run any personal risk
and to assist flank units. He continually showed magnificent
leadership, and his example to his men had a wonderful effect on
them, causing them to follow him cheerfully in his most daring
exploits. He continued to do magnificent work until he was badly
wounded by shell fire in the legs."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 23, <small>PRIVATE (LANCE-CORPORAL) BERNARD SYDNEY
GORDON</small>,<br>
41st Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"During the operations of the 26-27th August, 1918,
east of <small>BRAY</small>, this N.C.O. showed most conspicuous
gallantry and devotion to duty in the face of the enemy. He led his
section through heavy enemy shelling to its objective, which he
consolidated. Then single-handed he attacked an enemy machine gun
which was enfilading the Company on his right, killed the man on
the gun, and captured the post, which contained one officer (a
Captain) and 10 men. After handing these over at Company
Headquarters, he returned alone to the old system of trenches, in
which were many machine guns; entered a trench and proceeded to mop
it up, returning with 15 prisoners in one squad and 14 in another,
together with two machine guns. Again he returned to the system,
this time with a Trench Mortar gun and crew, and proceeded to mop
up a further portion of the trench, bringing in 22 prisoners,
including one officer and 3 machine guns. This last capture enabled
the British troops on our left to advance, which they had not been
able to do owing to machine-gun fire from these posts. His total
captures were thus 2 officers and 61 other ranks, together with 6
machine guns, and with the exception of the Trench Mortar
assistance, it was absolutely an individual effort and done
entirely on his own initiative."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>No. 726, <small>PRIVATE GEORGE CARTWRIGHT</small>,<br>
33rd Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"For most conspicuous valour and devotion to duty. On
the morning of the 31st August, 1918, during the attack on
<small>ROAD WOOD</small>, south-west of Bouchavesnes, near
P&eacute;ronne, Private Cartwright displayed exceptional gallantry
and supreme disregard for personal danger in the face of a most
withering machine-gun fire. Two Companies were held up by a machine
gun firing from the south-western edge of the wood. Without
hesitation, this man stood up, and walking towards the gun, fired
his rifle from his shoulder. He shot the No. 1 Gunner; another
German manned the gun, and he killed him; a third attempted to fire
the gun and him he also killed. Private Cartwright then threw a
bomb at the post, and on its exploding, he rushed forward, captured
the gun and nine Germans. Our line then immediately rushed forward,
loudly cheering him. This magnificent deed had a most inspiring
effect on the whole line; all strove to emulate his gallantry.
Throughout the operation Private Cartwright displayed wonderful
dash, grim determination and courage of the highest
order."</blockquote>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUTENANT EDGAR THOMAS TOWNER</small>, M.C.,<br>
2nd Australian Machine Gun Battalion.</p>
<blockquote>"On 1st September, 1918, in the attack on <small>MONT
ST. QUENTIN</small>, near P&eacute;ronne, this officer was in
charge of 4 Vickers guns operating on a front of 1,500 yards.
During the early stages of the advance an enemy machine gun was
causing casualties to our advancing Infantry. Locating the gun,
Lieut. Towner dashed ahead alone, and succeeded in killing the crew
with his revolver, capturing the gun, and then, by turning it
against the enemy, inflicted heavy casualties on them. Advancing
then past a copse from which the enemy were firing, he brought his
guns into action, placing his fire behind the enemy and cutting
them off. On their attempting to retire before the advancing
Infantry, and finding they were prevented by this machine gun fire,
the party of 25 Germans surrendered. He then reconnoitred alone
over open ground exposed to heavy machine-gun and snipers' fire,
and by the energy, foresight and the promptitude with which he
brought fire to bear on further enemy groups, enabled the Infantry
to reach a sunken road. On moving his guns up to the sunken road,
he found himself short of ammunition, so went back across the open
under heavy fire and obtained a German gun, and brought it and
boxes of ammunition into the sunken road. Here he mounted and fired
the gun in full view of the enemy, causing the enemy to retire
further, and enabling Infantry on the flank, who were previously
held up, to advance. Enemy machine gunners having direct
observation, flicked the earth round and under this gun, and played
a tattoo along the top of the bank. Though one bullet went into his
helmet and inflicted a gaping scalp wound, he continued firing.
Subsequently he refused to go out to have his wound attended to, as
the situation was critical and his place was with his men. Later in
the day the Infantry were obliged to retire slightly, and one gun
was left behind. Lieut. Towner, seeing this, dashed back over the
open, carried the gun back in spite of terrific fire, and brought
it into action again. He continued to engage the enemy wherever
they appeared, and put an enemy machine gun out of action. During
the following night he insisted on doing his tour of duty along
with the other officers, and his coolness and cheerfulness set an
example which had a great effect on the men. To steady and calm the
men of a small detached outpost, he crawled out among the enemy
posts to investigate. He remained out about an hour, though enemy
machine guns fired continuously on the sector, and the Germans were
moving about him. He moved one gun up in support of the Infantry
post, and patrolled the communication saps which ran off this post
into the German line during the remainder of the night. Next
morning, after his guns assisted in dispersing a large party of the
enemy, he was led away utterly exhausted, 30 hours after being
wounded."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At <small>MONT ST. QUENTIN</small>, north of
P&eacute;ronne, on the 1st September, 1918, this N.C.O. displayed
courage and tactical skill of the very highest order during the
attack on this village. Very strong opposition was met with early
in the attack, and every foot of ground was stubbornly contested by
the enemy located in very strong positions. This N.C.O.'s example
during the fighting was of the greatest value. He moved about,
regardless of the heavy enemy machine-gun fire, directing his men,
encouraging them to still greater effort, and finally led them on
to the objective. On reaching the objective, he saw that the left
attacking party had not met with success, and that the attack was
held up by an enemy strong post, heavily manned with 12 machine
guns. Under the heaviest sniping and machine gun fire Sergeant
Lowerson rallied seven men around him into a storming party, and
deployed them to attack the post from both flanks, one party of
three being killed immediately. He himself then rushed the strong
point, and, with effective bombing, inflicted heavy casualties on
the enemy, and captured the post containing 12 machine guns and 30
prisoners. Though severely wounded in the right thigh, he refused
to leave the front line until the prisoners had been dispatched to
the rear, and the organization and consolidation of the post by our
men had been completed. When he saw that the position was
thoroughly secure, he returned to the rear, but refused to leave
the Battalion until forced to evacuate two days later by the
seriousness of his wound. This act was the culminating point of a
series of most gallant performances by this N.C.O. during the
fighting extending over a week."</blockquote>

53rd Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"During the attack on <small>P&Eacute;RONNE</small>, on
the morning of 1st September, 1918, Private Currey displayed most
conspicuous gallantry and daring. During the early stage of the
advance the Battalion was suffering heavy casualties from a 77 mm.
Field Gun, that was firing over sights at very close range. Private
Currey, without hesitation, rushed forward, and despite a withering
machine-gun fire that was directed on him from either flank,
succeeded in capturing the gun single-handed after killing the
entire crew. Later, when continuing the advance, an enemy strong
point, containing 30 men and two machine guns, was noticed, which
was holding up the advance of the left flank. Private Currey crept
around the flank, and engaged the post with a Lewis Gun, causing
many casualties. Finally, he rushed the post single-handed, killing
four, wounding two, and taking one prisoner, the survivors running
away. It was entirely owing to his gallant conduct that the
situation was relieved, and the advance enabled to continue. After
the final stage of the attack, it was imperative that one of the
Companies that had become isolated should be withdrawn. This man at
once volunteered to carry the message, although the ground to be
crossed was very heavily shelled and continuously swept by
machine-gun fire. He crossed the shell and bullet-swept area three
times in the effort to locate the Company, and on one occasion his
box respirator was shot through by machine-gun bullets, and he was
gassed. Nevertheless, he remained on duty, and after finding the
isolated Company, delivered the message, and returned with very
valuable information from the Company Commander. Owing to the gas
poisoning from which he was suffering Currey had shortly afterwards
to be evacuated."</blockquote>

Fifteen minutes before zero two bombing patrols were sent to clear
up several enemy strong points close to our line, but they met with
very stubborn resistance and no success, and the Battalion was
unable to move on to its Jumping Off Trench. Mactier, single-handed
and in daylight, then jumped out of the trench from the leading
Company, rushed past the block, closed with and killed the
machine-gun garrison of 8 men with his revolver and bombs, and
threw the enemy machine gun over the parapet. He rushed forward
another 20 yards and jumped into another strong point held by a
garrison of 6 men, who immediately surrendered. Continuing to the
next block through the trench, an enemy gun, which had been
enfilading our flank advancing troops, was swung on to him; but he
jumped out of the trench into the open, and disposed of this third
post and gun crew by bombing them from the rear. Before he could
get into this trench, he was killed by enemy machine gun at close
range. In the three posts which Mactier rushed, 15 of the enemy
were found killed and 30 taken prisoners."</blockquote>

Company and part of the Company on the flank were held up by an
enemy machine-gun nest. With one man he rushed the post, shooting 4
of the occupants and taking 22 prisoners. Later on, reaching a
moat, another machine-gun nest commanded the only available
foot-bridge. Whilst this was being engaged from a flank, this
N.C.O. endeavoured to cross the bridge and rush the post, but was
killed in the attempt. Throughout the advance he had displayed
great initiative, resource and courage, being a great inspiration
to his men. In order to avert casualties amongst his comrades and
to permit of their advance, he voluntarily essayed a task which
practically meant certain death. He set a fine example of
self-sacrificing devotion to duty and bravery."</blockquote>

Then, crossing the objective with a small party, he reconnoitred
the approaches to the town, covering the infiltration of the
remainder of the Company. During the mopping up he
continuously&mdash;in advance of the main party&mdash;located enemy
posts of resistance, and then personally led parties to the
assault. In this way he captured many small parties of prisoners
and machine guns. On the morning of 2nd September, during a heavy
barrage on the newly consolidated position, a man of his platoon
was severely wounded. Seeing that only immediate medical attention
could save him, Corporal Hall volunteered and carried the man out
of the barrage, handed him to a stretcher-bearer, and immediately
returned to his post. This Company was heavily engaged throughout
the day, only one Officer remaining unwounded."</blockquote>

held up by the enemy, who occupied a trench in great numbers. After
an hour's continuous fighting Lance-Corporal Weathers went forward
alone in face of heavy enemy fire and located a large body of them.
He immediately attacked the enemy with bombs and killed the senior
officer; then made his way back to our lines and, securing a
further supply of bombs and taking three men with him, he went
forward and again attacked under very heavy fire. On reaching the
enemy position, he jumped up on the parapet of the trench and threw
bombs among the Bosche. He then signalled for his comrades to come

<blockquote>"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during
the operations near <small>LE VERGUIER</small>, north-west of St.
Quentin, on the 18th September, 1918. Woods formed one of a party
of three to patrol the right flank. He encountered a very
formidable enemy strong point, consisting of about 25 men with four
heavy and two light machine guns. This strong point commanded the
greater portion of our position, and it was of the utmost
importance to us, insomuch as it gave us a commanding view of the
whole canal system. The strong point was situated at the junction
of four enemy fire trenches, apparently sited with a view to
protecting the approaches to the village of Bellenglise. Private
Woods, appreciating the great importance of this position, and
realizing the necessity for its immediate capture, fearlessly
attacked with his rifle and bayonet, capturing one of the enemy and
wounding the second with his bayonet, forcing the remainder to
retire. After the capture of the strong point, it was found that
one of the party was wounded. Private Woods, although himself
slightly gassed, stubbornly defended the post. The enemy
ascertaining that only two men opposed them, immediately attempted
to recapture the strong point. The counter-attack by the enemy was
carried out with at least 30 men attacking up the three trenches
and across the open ground. This meant that Private Woods was
attacked from both flanks and the front. He fearlessly jumped on
the parapet, and opened fire on the attacking enemy, inflicting
several casualties. During this operation he was exposed to very
heavy machine-gun, rifle fire and bombing, but with dogged
determination he kept up his fire, thus holding up the enemy until
help arrived, enabling the enemy counter-attack to be repulsed with
heavy losses. The capture of this strong post was the means of
securing our flank, which had previously been in the air, and also
enabled us to get in touch with the troops on our
flank."</blockquote>

<p>No. 6594, <small>SERGEANT GERALD SEXTON</small>,<br>
13th Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"In the attack near <small>LE VERGUIER</small>,
north-west of St. Quentin, on the 18th September, 1918, Sergeant
Sexton displayed the most conspicuous bravery and performed deeds
which, apart from their gallant nature, were in a great measure
responsible for the Battalion's success. On the southern edge of
the village of Le Verguier the enemy fought hard, and serious
opposition had to be crushed. During the whole period of the
advance, Sergeant Sexton was to the fore dealing with enemy machine
guns by firing from the hip as he advanced, rushing enemy posts,
and performing feats of bravery and endurance, which are better
appreciated when one realizes that all the time he fired his Lewis
Gun from the hip without faltering or for a moment taking cover.
Immediately the attack commenced, Sergeant Sexton's Lewis Gun
Section was confronted by an enemy machine gun. He called out to
his section to follow, rushed the machine gun and killed the crew.
He then called out to the rest of the Company to follow, but they
had not gone far when they encountered some bombers and riflemen
about 70 yards in front of the Company. Sexton rushed the trench,
firing his gun from the hip, and killed or took prisoner all the
members of the post. Continuing, he entered a copse, and killed or
took prisoner another party of the enemy. The advance continued
over the ridge at Le Verguier to where Sexton was met by Lieut.
Price, who pointed out a party of the enemy manning a bank, and a
field gun in action which was causing casualties and holding up a
Company. There was also a trench mortar in action. Sergeant Sexton
did not wait, but firing a few short bursts as he advanced, and
calling out to his section to follow, rushed down the bank and
killed the gunners on the field gun. Dashing out on to a flat under
fire from two hostile machine guns directed on him, he killed 12
more of the enemy. Paying no heed to the machine-gun fire, he
returned to the bank, and after firing down some dug-outs, induced
about 30 of the enemy to surrender. Owing to his action the Company
on the left of the Battalion was able to continue the advance where
they had been definitely held up, and were suffering from the
effects of the field gun. When the advance was continued from the
first to the second objective, the Company was again held up by two
machine guns on the right and one on the left. In conjunction with
a Platoon, Sexton engaged the machine gun on the left, firing all
the while from the upright position, a fearless figure which,
according to eye-witnesses, inspired everyone. To have taken cover
would have been more prudent, but Sexton realized that prompt
action was essential, and did not wait to assume the prone
position. Silencing this gun, he turned his attention to the two
machine guns on the right and silenced them. He then moved forward
into a trench, killing quite a number of the enemy and, advancing
along a sap, took a few prisoners. Further on he was responsible
for a few more small posts, and, on the final objective, being
given a responsible post on the left of his Company, he engaged a
machine gun which was firing across the Company front, and thus
enabled his Company to dig in. This completed, he went forward down
a sunken road and captured several more prisoners."</blockquote>

<p><small>MAJOR BLAIR ANDERSON WARK</small>, D.S.O.,<br>
32nd Battalion, A.I.F.</p>
<blockquote>"During the period 29th September-1st October, 1918, in
the operations against the <small>HINDENBURG LINE</small> at
<small>BELLICOURT</small>, and the advance through <small>NAUROY,
ETRICOURT, MAGNY LA FOSSE</small> and <small>JONCOURT</small>,
Major Wark, in command of the 32nd Battalion, displayed most
conspicuous gallantry and set a fine example of personal bravery,
energy, coolness, and control under extremely difficult conditions.
On 29th September, under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire at
very close range from all sides and in a dense fog, Major Wark,
finding that the situation was critical, moved quickly forward
alone and obtained sufficient information regarding the situation
in front to be able to lead his command forward. At this time
American troops were at a standstill and disorganized, and Major
Wark quickly organized more than 200 of them, and attached them to
his leading Companies and pressed forward. By his prompt action in
the early stages of the battle he narrowly averted what would have
resulted in great confusion on the part of the attack-troops. Still
moving fearlessly at the head of his leading Companies, and at most
times far out in advance, attended only by a runner, he cheered his
men on, and they swept through the Hindenburg defences towards
Nauroy. Pushing quickly through Nauroy, and mopping up the southern
portion of the village, the process yielding 50 prisoners, the
Battalion swung towards Etricourt. Still leading his assaulting
Companies, he observed a battery of 77 mm. guns firing point-blank
into his rear Companies and causing heavy casualties. Calling on a
few of his men to him he rushed the battery, capturing the 4 guns
and 10 of the crew; the remainder of the crew fled or were killed.
Moving rapidly forward with only two N.C.O.'s, he surprised and
captured 50 Germans near Magny la Fosse. Quickly seizing this
opportunity, he pushed one Company forward through the village and
made good the position. Having captured his objectives for the day,
and personally reconnoitring to see that his flanks were safe, he
found his command in a very difficult and dangerous position, his
left flank being exposed to the extent of 3,000 yards on account of
the 31st Battalion not being able to advance. He, after a strenuous
day's fighting, set about the selection and reorganization of a new
position, and effected a junction with British troops on the right
and 31st Battalion on the left, and made his line secure. At 6 a.m.
on 30th September, he again led his command forward to allow of the
troops on the right being able to advance. The men were tired and
had suffered heavily, but he personally led them, and his presence
amongst them inspired them to further efforts. On October 1st,
1918, his Battalion was ordered to advance at very short notice. He
gave his orders for the attack, and personally led his troops
forward. A nest of machine guns was encountered, causing casualties
to his men. Without hesitation and regardless of personal risk, he
dashed forward practically into the muzzles of the guns and under
an exceptionally heavy fire and silenced them, killing or capturing
the entire crews. Joncourt and Mill Ridge were then quickly
captured and his line consolidated. His men were practically
exhausted after the three days' heavy fighting, but he moved
amongst them from post to post, across country swept by heavy and
continuous shell and machine-gun fire at point-blank range, urged
them on and the line was made secure. Throughout he displayed the
greatest courage and devotion to duty, coupled with great tact and
skill, and his work, together with the reports based on his own
personal observations, which he forwarded, were invaluable to the
Brigade. It is beyond doubt that the success achieved by the
Brigade during the heavy fighting on 29th and 30th September and
1st October was due to this officer's gallantry, determination,
skill and great courage."</blockquote>

for saving a very dangerous situation under particularly gallant
circumstances during an attack against the Hindenburg defences on
30th September, 1918. In the initial assault on the enemy's
positions this soldier went forward with great dash and
determination, and was one of the first men of his Company to reach
the trench which was their objective. Seeing him rush in with his
bayonet with such exceptional skill and daring, his comrades were
inspired and followed his example. Although the enemy shell and
machine-gun fire was extremely heavy, the enemy trench garrison was
soon overcome. In the assault the attacking troops were weakened by
casualties, and, as they were too few to cover the whole front of
attack, a considerable gap was left between Private Ryan's
Battalion's left and the unit on the flank. The enemy
counter-attacked soon after the objective was reached, and a few
succeeded in infiltrating through the gap, and taking up a position
of cover in rear of our men, where they commenced bombing
operations. The section of trench occupied by Private Ryan and his
comrades was now under fire from front and rear, and for a time it
seemed that the enemy was certain to force his way through. The
situation was critical and necessitated prompt action by someone in
authority. Private Ryan found that there were no officers or
N.C.O.'s near; they had become casualties in the assault.
Appreciating the situation at once, he organized the few men
nearest him, and led them out to attack the enemy with bomb and
bayonet. Some of his party fell victims to the enemy's bombs, and
he finally dashed into the enemy position of cover with only 3 men.
The enemy were three times their number, but by skilful bayonet
work they succeeded in killing the first three Germans on the
enemy's flank. Moving along the embankment. Private Ryan alone
rushed the remainder of the enemy with bombs. It was while thus
engaged he fell wounded, but his dashing bombing assault drove the
enemy clear of our positions. Those who were not killed or wounded
by his bombs fell victims to our Lewis Gunners as they retired
across No Man's Land. A particularly dangerous situation had been
saved by this gallant soldier, whose display of determined bravery
and initiative was witnessed by the men of the two attacking
Battalions, who, inspired and urged by it, fought skilfully and
bravely for two days."</blockquote>

Commander in an attack on the <small>BEAUREVOIR-FONSOMME</small>
Line near Estr&eacute;es, north of St. Quentin. His Company
Commander was severely wounded soon after the jump off, and Lieut.
Maxwell at once took charge of the Company. When the enemy wire was
reached, they were met by a hail of machine-gun fire, and suffered
considerable casualties, including all other officers of the
Company. The wire at this point was six belts thick, each belt
being 20 to 25 feet wide. Lieut. Maxwell pushed forward
single-handed through the wire, and attacked the most dangerous
machine gun. He personally killed three of the crew, and the
remaining four men in the post surrendered to him with a machine
gun. His Company followed him through the wire and captured the
trenches forming their objective. Later, it was noticed that the
Company on his left was held up in the wire by a very strong force
on the left flank of the Battalion. He at once organized a party
and moved to the left to endeavour to attack the enemy from the
rear. Heavy machine-gun fire met them. Lieut. Maxwell again dashed
forward single-handed at the foremost machine gun, and with his
revolver shot five of its crew, so silencing the gun. Owing to the
work of this party, the left Company was then able to work a small
force through the wire, and eventually to occupy the objective and
mop up the trenches. In the fighting prior to the mopping up, an
English-speaking prisoner, who was captured, stated that the
remainder of the enemy were willing to surrender. Lieut. Maxwell
and two men, with this prisoner, walked to a post containing more
than twenty Germans. The latter at once seized and disarmed our
men. Lieut. Maxwell waited his chance, and then with an automatic
pistol which he had concealed in his box respirator, shot two of
the enemy and with the two men escaped. They were pursued by rifle
fire, and one was wounded. However, Lieut. Maxwell organized a
small party at once, attacked and captured the post."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the attack on <small>MONTBREHAIN</small>, east
of P&eacute;ronne, on 5th October, 1918, this officer was in charge
of a platoon. About 100 yards from the Jumping Off Trench severe
enemy machine-gun fire was encountered from a strong post which had
escaped our Artillery fire, and the advance was thus held up.
Lieut. Ingram dashed out, and, under cover of the fire of a Lewis
Gun, rushed the post at the head of his men. This post contained 9
machine guns and 42 Germans, who fought until our men were within 3
yards of them. They were killed to a man&mdash;Lieut. Ingram
accounting for no less than 18 of them. A number of enemy posts
were then observed to be firing on our men from about 150 yards
further forward, and the Company moved forward to attack them, but
severe casualties were sustained. The Company Commander had been
badly wounded, and the Company Sergeant-Major and several others,
who attempted to lead the advance, were killed. Our barrage had
passed on, and no Tanks were near. Lieut. Ingram quickly seized the
situation, rallied his men in the face of murderous fire, and, with
magnificent courage and resolution, led them forward. He himself
rushed the first post, shot 6 of the enemy, and captured a machine
gun, thus overcoming a very serious resistance. By this time the
Company had been reduced from 90 to about 30 other ranks; but this
officer, seeing enemy fire coming from a quarry, to his left front,
again led his men forward and rushed the quarry. He jumped into the
quarry amongst enemy wire, and his men followed and proceeded to
mop up a large number of the enemy who were in bivouacs there. He
then observed an enemy machine gun firing from the ventilator of a
cellar, through a gap in the wall of a house about 20 yards away.
Without hesitation and entirely alone he scrambled up the edge of
the quarry, ran round the rear of the house, and entering from the
far side, shot the enemy gunner through the ventilator of the
cellar. He fired several more shots into the cellar, then, seeing
some enemy jumping out of the window of the house, he burst open a
door, rushed to the head of the stairs leading into the cellar, and
forced 62 of the enemy to surrender. He now found he was out of
touch with the Company on his left flank, so went out alone and
made a personal reconnaissance under heavy fire, and succeeded in
gaining touch with the left Company, which had lost all its
officers. Having returned to his Company, he personally placed a
post on his left flank to ensure its safety, and then reconnoitred
and established two posts on his right flank. All this was done in
the face of continuous machine-gun and shell fire."</blockquote>

<h3>APPENDIX C</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>CORPS ORDERS FOR THE BATTLE OF AUGUST 8TH,
1918</small></p>
<p>The following were the complete orders issued by the Australian
Army Corps for the Battle of August 8th, 1918. They form only a
small part of the whole of the orders which were required for the
operation. There were, in addition, detailed orders by the Corps
Artillery Headquarters, the Heavy Artillery, the Chief Engineer,
and each of the five Divisions and fifteen Brigades, and also by
the Administrative Services of the Corps.</p>
<p>On the question of the form of the orders, the most expedient
course was found to be the one here adopted&mdash;namely, that of
issuing a numbered series of Battle Instructions, each dealing
comprehensively with a separate subject matter:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>BATTLE INSTRUCTIONS NO</small>. 1</p>
<p>1. The Australian Corps will attack the enemy from the
<small>VILLERS-BRETONNEUX-CHAULNES</small> Railway exclusive to the
River <small>SOMME</small>, inclusive, at a date and hour to be
notified.</p>
<p>The Canadian Corps will co-operate on the right, south of the
railway (inclusive), and the Third Corps on the left, north of the
<small>SOMME</small>.</p>
<p>2. <i>General Method of Attack</i>.&mdash;The Australian Corps
will attack on a two-division front. The attack will be carried out
in three phases. Divisional boundaries and objectives are shown on
the attached map.</p>
<p class="indent1">(i) <i>First Phase</i>.&mdash;The 2nd and 3rd
Australian Divisions will form up on a taped line prior to zero,
and will attack with Tanks under a creeping artillery barrage.
Their objective is shown by a <small>GREEN</small> line on the
attached map. On arrival at their objective they will
consolidate.</p>
<p class="indent1">(ii) <i>Second Phase</i>.&mdash;The 5th and 4th
Australian Divisions, organized in brigade groups, will advance in
open warfare formations, from the first objective passing through
2nd and 3rd Australian Divisions respectively. Their objective is
shown in <small>RED</small> on the map.</p>
<p class="indent1">(iii) <i>Third Phase</i>.&mdash;The 5th and 4th
Australian Divisions will exploit their success and seize the old
British line of Defences marked <small>BLUE</small> on the map, and
establish themselves defensively on this line.</p>
<p class="indent1">(iv) The 1st Australian Division will be in
Corps Reserve.</p>
<p class="indent1">(v) A detailed programme of the action will be
issued.</p>
<p>3. <i>Assembly</i>.&mdash;In order to free as many troops from
line duty as possible, 2nd and 3rd Australian Divisions will
arrange to hold the front with one infantry brigade on each
Divisional sector. This will be completed before daybreak on 5th
August.</p>
<p>To prevent any troops arriving at their objectives in an
exhausted condition through a long march, troops detailed to the
farthest objectives must be quartered nearest the starting line
prior to <small>ZERO</small>.</p>
<p>The brigades of 2nd and 3rd Australian Divisions not holding the
line will be quartered in rear of all brigades of 5th and 4th
Australian Divisions respectively prior to <small>ZERO</small>
night. This will be completed before daybreak on 5th August.</p>
<p>The allotment of areas for quartering during this stage will be
made by mutual arrangement between Divisional Commanders concerned.
The allotment of routes and times of movement in accordance with
the Corps programme will be arranged similarly.</p>
<p>On <small>ZERO</small> night the brigades of 2nd and 3rd
Australian Divisions not in the line will make their approach march
to their tape lines through the area occupied by 5th and 4th
Australian Divisions respectively.</p>
<p>4. <i>Artillery</i>.</p>
<p class="negindent4">(i) The Artillery available consists of:<br>

<small>SECRECY</small></p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) It is of first importance that secrecy should be
observed and the operation carried out as a surprise.</p>
<p>Commanders will take all possible steps to prevent the scope or
date of the operation becoming known except to those taking part.
Any officer, N.C.O., or man discussing the operation in public, or
communicating details regarding it to any person, either soldier or
civilian, not immediately concerned, will be severely dealt
with.</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) All movement of troops and transport will take
place by night, whether in the forward or back areas of the
Australian Corps, on and after 1st August, except where absolutely
necessary to move by day.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) O.C., No. 3 Squadron, A.F.C., will arrange for
aeroplanes to fly over the Australian Corps Army area during days
when flying is possible, and to report to Corps H.Q. any abnormal
movement of troops or transport within our lines.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Work on back lines will be continued as at present,
so that there may be no apparent change in our attitude.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Commanders will ensure that the numbers of officers
reconnoitring the enemy's positions is limited to those for whom
such reconnaissance is essential.</p>
<p>Nothing attracts attention to an offensive more than a large
number of officers with maps looking over the parapet and visiting
Observation Posts.</p>
<p>Commanding Officers of units holding the front line should
report at once to higher authority any disregard of these
orders.</p>

<br>
ASSEMBLY OF TANKS</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Preliminary Movement</i>.</p>
<p>Tanks will be assembled in concealed positions in the forward
area under the orders of the 5th Tank Brigade prior to night
Y/Z.</p>
<p>2. <i>Advance to Start Line</i>.</p>
<p>On night Y/Z the Tanks allotted to troops attacking the first
objective will commence to move forward at 9.30 p.m. to the Tank
Start Line. They will move with full engines to a line not nearer
to the Tank Start Line than 3,000 yards. From there they will
continue the movement forward to the Tank Start Line, moving at a
slow rate and as quietly as possible. The Tank Start Line will be
approximately 1,000 yards in rear of the Infantry taped line.</p>
<p>Tanks will leave the Tank Start Line at such times as will allow
them to catch up to the Infantry as the barrage lifts at zero plus
three minutes.</p>
<p>3. <i>Concealment of Engine Noise</i>.</p>
<p>To conceal the noise of the engines during the advance of the
Tanks, the 5th Brigade R.A.F. will arrange to have planes flying
continuously over the Corps area from 9.30 p.m. until midnight on
Y/Z night, and from zero minus one hour onward to zero.</p>
<p>4. <i>Tanks allotted to Second Objective</i>.</p>
<p>The Tanks allotted to the second objective will form up
independently under the orders of the 5th Tank Brigade in
consultation with G.O.'s C., 4th and 5th Australian Divisions.
These Tanks will be formed up when the aeroplanes are in the air
during the hours laid down in para. 3.</p>
<p>5. <i>Liaison Company</i>.</p>
<p>The company of the 8th Tank Battalion detailed to act in
support, and to ensure liaison in the battle line at the junction
of Divisions, will detail a half-company to each wave of Tanks,
vide paras. 2 and 4 above.</p>
<p>Divisions will detail special liaison parties of Infantry to
work in co-operation with this company.</p>
<p>6. <i>Re-assembly</i>.</p>
<p>As soon as the blue line has been reached, G.O.C. 5th Australian
Division will arrange to release the 2nd Tank Battalion, less the
attached company. This battalion will then be withdrawn. The
remainder of the Tanks, less one company allotted to remain in
support of each of the 4th and 5th Australian Divisions, will be
withdrawn when ordered by Divisional Commanders, vide Battle
Instructions No. 5, para. 4.</p>
<p>7. <i>Smoke Grenades</i>.</p>
<p>Divisions will ensure that a proportion of smoke rifle grenades
accompanies each Infantry detachment detailed to the blue line and
which accompanies each of the Mark V. (Star) Tanks.</p>

<p align="center"><small>BATTLE INSTRUCTIONS NO</small>. 6<br>
<br>
<small>ARTILLERY</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Preparation</i>.</p>
<p>Active counter-battery work and harassing fire will be
maintained.</p>
<p>Such registration as is necessary will be carried out under
cover of this fire. A detailed programme for this will be arranged
in each divisional sector.</p>
<p>The necessity for concealing the increase in the number of guns
on the front must be borne in mind, and on no account should a
large number of guns be employed at any one time. Counter
preparation and S.O.S. plans during the period of preparation for
the attack will be drawn up accordingly.</p>
<p>Normal fire should, so far as possible, be carried out from
positions other than those in which batteries will be emplaced
during the battle.</p>
<p>2. <i>Heavy Artillery</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>a</i>) In view of the nature of the enemy's
defences, the fire of the majority of the heavy howitzers, employed
for purposes other than counter-battery work, will be used during
the barrage to engage special strong points or localities.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>b</i>) Throughout the advance beyond the
green line enemy centres of resistance will be kept under fire
until such time as the progress of the Infantry renders this
inadvisable. A map will be issued to show the times at which heavy
artillery fire will cease on zones and special localities.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>c</i>) At least two-thirds of the available
Heavy Artillery will be employed for counter-battery purposes.</p>
<p class="indent1">Heavy concentrations of fire will be directed on
the different groups of enemy artillery.</p>
<p>3. G.O.C., R.A., will prepare plans for dealing with a heavy
development of hostile fire on zero night. He will also prepare a
plan to deal with any attempt at a deliberate gas bombardment of
the <small>VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small> area on zero night.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>BATTLE INSTRUCTIONS NO</small>. 7<br>
<br>
<small>PROGRAMME OF ACTION</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Capture of First Objective</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Forming-up troops detailed to the capture of the
first objective will be deployed on the Forming-up Line one hour
before zero hour.</p>
<p>(b) <i>Artillery Programme</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">(i) The field artillery 18-pdr. barrage will
open at zero 200 yards in advance of the forming-up line. At zero
plus three minutes the barrage will commence to advance; lifts will
be 100 yards at 2-minute intervals. There will be two lifts at this
rate.</p>
<p class="indent1">The rate will then decrease to lifts of 100
yards every 3 minutes. There will be eight lifts at this rate.</p>
<p class="indent1">From the eleventh lift inclusive until the green
line is reached lifts will be of 100 yards each at 4-minute
intervals.</p>
<p class="indent1">(ii) The 4.5" Howitzer barrage will move 200
yards in advance of the 18-pdr. barrage.</p>
<p class="indent1">(iii) A protective barrage will be maintained in
front of the green line until zero plus four hours. During this
period approximately fifty per cent. (50%) of the guns remaining in
the barrage will be employed in a protective line barrage; the
remainder will be employed to search and sweep deeply into the
enemy's position. At zero plus four hours all barrage fire will
cease.</p>
<p class="indent1">Barrage Maps will be issued later.</p>
<p>2. <i>Capture of Second and Third Objectives</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Assembly</i>.&mdash;5th and 4th Australian
Divisions will select and mark positions for the assembly of their
troops.</p>
<p>These areas will be selected in liaison with Tank Commanders and
with the 2nd and 3rd Australian Divisions respectively, to prevent
movement to them clashing with the approach march of these
divisions and that of the Tanks.</p>
<p>This requires careful co-ordination between each pair of
Divisions and Tank Commanders.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Command</i>.&mdash;At zero plus four hours,
responsibility for the battle front will pass to G.O.C., 5th
Australian Division, in the right sector, and to G.O.C., 4th
Australian Division, in the left sector.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Advance</i>.&mdash;5th and 4th Australian
Divisions will time their advance so that the leading troops cross
the first objective (green line) at zero plus four hours.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) From zero plus four hours the advance will be
continued under the conditions of open warfare.</p>

<small>ROADS</small></p>
<p>1. A map is forwarded herewith showing the organization of the
road system in the captured territory.</p>
<p>2. The Chief Engineer will issue the necessary instructions for
the preparation of these roads for traffic.</p>
<p>3. All light traffic which is capable of moving across country
will do so and will avoid main roads.</p>
<p>4. Mule tracks will be a divisional responsibility.</p>
<p>5. Artillery advancing with the 5th and 4th Australian Divisions
will carry forward a proportion of bridges. Arrangements should be
made as soon as possible for the development of tracks, making use
of the routes taken by the artillery over these bridges.</p>
<p>6. The <small>AMIENS-LONGUEAU-VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</small> main
road, as far east as the cross roads in N.26.c., will be reserved
for the exclusive use of the Cavalry Corps from 9.30 p.m. on Y/Z
night until 8 a.m. on Z day. After 8 a.m. on Z day it will be
available for the Australian and Cavalry Corps.</p>
<p>Assistant Provost Marshal, Australian Corps, will arrange for
the control of the traffic on this road throughout.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer, Australian Corps, will prepare short avoiding
roads at the cross roads at N.26.c. to cross the north-east or
south-west corner to avoid congestion at this spot.</p>

<p><i>Remark</i>.&mdash;In the case of (a) a smoke rocket (No. 27
grenade) will also be fired in the direction of the obstruction to
indicate its position.</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) Special care must be taken by the Artillery on the
right flank of the Corps that all officers and N.C.O.'s are
acquainted with these signals, so that no mistake may arise as
regards the difference in the S.O.S. Signals of the Australian and
Canadian Corps.</p>

<p>Allotment of Message-carrying Rockets is 80 per Division.</p>
<p>3. <i>Smoke</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>a</i>) Artillery smoke will be as
follows:</p>
<p class="negindent1">(i) 3 rounds per gun will be fired during the
first three minutes of the artillery barrage.</p>
<p class="negindent1">(ii) 3 rounds per gun will be fired in quick
succession on the arrival of the field artillery barrage at the
artillery halt line covering the first objective.</p>
<p class="negindent1">(iii) In the event of wet weather a small
proportion of smoke will be used in the barrage to replace the
smoke and dust caused by the burst of the shells in dry weather.
This will not be sufficient to confuse the effect with that of the
smoke shells prescribed in paragraph 3 (a) (i) and (ii).</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Screening beyond the First Objective</i>.</p>
<p>15th Wing, Royal Air Force, will arrange to screen the advance
of the Tanks and Infantry from special localities in advance of
their first objective by dropping phosphorus bombs.</p>
<p>Divisions and G.O.C., 5th Tank Brigade, will inform Australian
Corps Headquarters as early as possible of the localities which
they desire screened.</p>
<p>A map will be issued showing times at which it is anticipated
that the Infantry will make good certain zones. Phosphorus bombs
will not be dropped within these zones at any time after it is
anticipated that the Infantry will have occupied them.</p>

<small>INTELLIGENCE AND DISPOSAL OF PRISONERS OF WAR</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Battalion Intelligence Police</i>.</p>
<p>One German speaker and two searchers will be allotted to each
battalion for use as follows:</p>
<p class="indent1">(a) <i>German Speaker</i>.</p>
<p class="indent2">(i) To secure immediate identifications quickly,
so that identifications will reach Corps Headquarters as speedily
as possible of enemy units on the battle front.</p>
<p class="indent2">(ii) To secure immediate information required by
the Battalion Commander as regards enemy dispositions, assembly
positions, orders for counter-attack, etc.</p>
<p class="indent2">(iii) To be in charge of the two searchers and
separate important documents, orders, maps, etc., translate and
convey information of moment to the immediate Commander.</p>
<p class="indent1">(b) <i>Two Searchers</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">The two searchers under the German speaker
systematically search the battlefield, enemy positions, suspected

them packed in sandbags, and sent through the usual channels to the
Corps Cage as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="indent1">This personnel should carry torches and, besides
rifles or revolvers, bombs are recommended as being useful for
dealing with any of the enemy who may be found in dug-outs.</p>
<br>
<p>2. <i>Divisional Intelligence Officers</i>.</p>
<p>Divisional Intelligence Officers will go forward to an Advanced
Divisional Collecting Cage, with a view to obtaining, as soon as
possible, information of immediate tactical importance.</p>
<p>The Cage will be connected by telephone to Divisional H.Q., and
important information obtained should be transmitted as quickly as
possible to Divisional and Brigade H.Q.</p>
<p>The main points on which immediate information is required from
prisoners are: The Order of Battle, Units seen, Distribution of the
Enemy's Forces, Method of holding the Line, Assembly Positions,
Counter-attack Orders and Intentions.</p>
<p>This information will be wired to their respective Divisional
Headquarters and repeated to Corps Headquarters and Corps Cage by
Divisional Intelligence Officers.</p>
<p>Divisional Intelligence Officers will not detain prisoners
longer than is necessary to obtain this tactical information of
immediate importance.</p>
<p>In case a large number of prisoners are captured, they will
detain only one or two from each regiment, and will not delay the
passage of the remainder to the Corps Cage.</p>
<p>Any further information required from prisoners by Divisions or
lower formations can always be obtained by telephone from the Corps
Cage.</p>
<br>
<p>3. <i>Searching of Prisoners</i>,</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>a</i>) <i>Officers and N.C.O.'s</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">Officers and N.C.O.'s will be searched as soon
as possible after capture by a responsible officer or N.C.O., and
all documents taken from them sent back with them (in sacks,
labelled by regiments, if a number are captured) to the Divisional
Intelligence Officer, at such place as this officer has
prearranged.</p>
<p class="indent1">It is left to the discretion of Divisional
Intelligence Officers as to what documents, maps, etc., taken from
prisoners they hold back for the information of Brigade and
Divisional Commanders. When this is done, Corps "I" will be
informed by wire, priority if necessary, of the nature of the
documents, etc., held back, and of any points of immediate tactical
importance they may contain.</p>
<p class="indent1">As soon as possible after information has been
extracted from them, the documents will be forwarded on to the
Corps Cage. Arrangements can be made by Corps, if notified that
documents are ready to be sent on, to fetch them by motor-cyclist
or cycle.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>b</i>) <i>Other Ranks</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">Prisoners other than officers and N.C.O.'s will
be searched on their arrival at the Corps Cage. Their papers, etc.,
will be taken from them and put into sacks labelled according to
regiments.</p>
<p class="indent1">(c) All ranks should understand that a
prisoner's pay-book, identity disc, and personal belongings should
not be taken from him. Escorts and guards will be warned to take
special precautions to prevent prisoners from destroying
papers.</p>
<p>4. <i>Separation of Officers, N.C.O.'s and Men</i>.</p>
<p>Care will be taken that officers, N.C.O.'s and privates are all
separated from one another at once, and are not allowed to
communicate with one another. Prisoners who have been interrogated
should not be allowed to mix with those who have not yet been
interrogated.</p>
<p>5. <i>Notification of Locality of Capture</i>.</p>
<p>It is essential that, when prisoners are sent back, information
be sent with them which will show where they were captured.
Information as to the battalion which made the capture is a useful
indication.</p>
<p>6. <i>Authorized Persons only to converse with
Prisoners</i>.</p>
<p>It is most important that no officer or N.C.O., except those
duly authorized, be allowed to interrogate or converse with
prisoners.</p>
<p>7. <i>Prisoners of War Cage</i>.</p>
<p>The Advanced Corps Cage will be situated at
<small>VECQUEMONT</small>, N.11.b.8.7. and the Rear Corps Cage at
N.2.c.3.7.</p>
<p>Intelligence Officers and personnel will be stationed here, and
will carry out a more detailed interrogation and sort out captured
documents.</p>
<p>The Advanced Corps Cage will be connected by telephone to Corps
H.Q.</p>
<p>8. <i>Prisoners</i>.</p>
<p>The following procedure will be adopted for the disposal of
prisoners:</p>
<p>After capture they will be escorted to the Advanced Divisional
Collecting Cage, for examination by the Divisional Intelligence
Officer, who, after he has finished with them, will send them back
to the Advanced Corps Cage.</p>
<p>The sending back of prisoners should be carried out as quickly
as possible, and several escorts should be arranged for them to be
passed back without any unusual delay. Instructions should be
issued to ensure that too many men are not employed on escort
duty.</p>
<p>In the forward area directing notices should be placed to show
the route to be taken to the Advanced Divisional Collecting
Cage.</p>
<p>Traffic control personnel should be conversant with the method
of disposing of prisoners.</p>
<p>9. <i>Identifications</i>.</p>
<p>The importance of passing on all identifications as speedily as
possible to Corps "I" cannot be too strongly impressed on all
concerned. It is essential that special efforts be made to wire at
once, as soon as identifications are made and the locality in which
obtained.</p>
<p>10. <i>Maps and Photographs</i>.</p>
<p>The following maps are being issued:</p>
<p class="indent1">(i) A large issue of 1/20,000 No. 62. D.
South-East regular series for distribution to all officers.</p>
<p class="indent1">(ii) 1/20,000 Map Message Form, for distribution
down to N.C.O.'s.</p>

<br>
<small>CO-OPERATION OF INFANTRY AND AIRCRAFT</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Contact Aeroplanes</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <i>Indication of position by flares</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>a</i>) Red ground flares will be used to
indicate the infantry positions to contact aeroplanes. They will be
lit by infantry in the most advanced line only.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>b</i>) A contact aeroplane will fly along
the line of the first objective at zero plus 2 hours 30 minutes.
Flares will be called for by the aeroplane sounding a succession of
"A's" on the Klaxon horn and by firing a white Very Light. If the
aeroplane fails to mark the line accurately, it will repeat its
call ten minutes later.</p>
<p class="indent1">Should the infantry not have reached the line of
the objective at the time laid down above, the contact aeroplane
will return at half-hour intervals until flares are shown.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>c</i>) A contact aeroplane will fly along
the line of the second objective at zero plus 6 hours 30 minutes.
It will call for flares, and the same procedure will be followed on
this objective as on the first objective until the flares are
seen.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>d</i>) A contact aeroplane will fly over
third objective at zero plus 7 hours, when the procedure laid down
for the first objective will be observed until the flares are
shown.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>e</i>) Divisions will organize
message-dropping stations in the vicinity of their
Headquarters.</p>
<p>(ii) <i>Other means of identifying the position of the
Infantry</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>a</i>) <em>Rifles</em>.&mdash;Three or four
rifles laid parallel across the top of the trench.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>b</i>) <em>Metal Discs</em>.&mdash;Metal
discs will be used as reflectors by flashing in the sun. This
method has been successful even on days which have not been
particularly bright.</p>
<p class="indent1">The disc is most easily carried sewn to the
Small Box Respirator, and can be used in this way without
inconvenience.</p>
<p>2. <i>Counter-attack Planes</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>a</i>) From zero hour counter-attack planes
will be constantly in the air, with the object of observing hostile
concentrations or abnormal movement.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>b</i>) In the event of an enemy
concentration indicating a counter-attack, the counter-attack
aeroplane will signal this information to the Artillery by
wireless. In the case of a counter-attack actually developing a
white parachute flare will be fired by the aeroplane in the
direction of the troops moving for the impending counter-attack,
for the information of the Infantry.</p>
<p>3. <i>Ammunition-carrying Aeroplanes</i>.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>a</i>) Aeroplanes will be detailed to
transport ammunition from zero plus 2 hours 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>b</i>) Vickers guns will display a white "V"
at the point where ammunition is to be dropped. The arms of the "V"
to be 6 feet in length and 1 foot in width. The apex of the "V" to
point towards the enemy.</p>
<p class="indent1">(<i>c</i>) Ammunition aeroplanes will have the
under-side of the lower planes painted black for a distance of
2&frac12; feet from the tips.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>BATTLE INSTRUCTIONS NO</small>. 12<br>
<br>
<small>CONSOLIDATION</small></p>
<p>1. <i>Divisions allotted to First Objective</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Consolidation</i>.&mdash;As soon as the first
objective has been captured troops will dig in.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Troops holding present front line</i>.&mdash;The
brigades of 2nd and 3rd Australian Divisions holding the line on
the night prior to zero will remain in their battle positions until
all troops detailed to the attack have passed through. They will
then be organized and prepared to move to meet any emergency.</p>
<p>2nd Australian Division will be prepared to detach its brigade
to act in support of 5th Australian Division, and 3rd Australian
Division to detach its brigade in support of 4th Australian
Division.</p>
<p>(c) <i>Reorganization of Troops on First Objective</i>.&mdash;As
soon as the whole of the troops detailed to the capture of second
(red line) and third (blue line) objectives have passed through the
line of the first objective, 2nd and 3rd Australian Divisions will
organize the defence of their sectors on the first objective in
depth in each brigade sub-sector. Units will be reorganized, and
those not detailed to the defence of the line will be withdrawn
into support and held in readiness for eventualities. At least one
battalion in each brigade sub-sector should be withdrawn in this
way.</p>
<p>2. <i>Second Objective</i>.</p>
<p><i>Consolidation</i>.&mdash;As soon as the second objective (the
red line) has been captured, the position will be thoroughly
consolidated. Arrangements will be made to ensure a supply of
engineering material for this.</p>
<p>3. <i>Main Line of Resistance</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) When the third objective (the blue line) is attained,
it will be organized and consolidated as the main line of
resistance.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) If the enemy is able to develop an immediate
counter-attack, or if he has a definite plan, and the troops
available in close reserve for the defence of the blue line, it may
not be possible to reach the third objective. In this case the
second objective (red line) will become the main line of
resistance, and will be consolidated and organized in depth
accordingly.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Definite plans will be prepared to deal with either
case. The Corps must be prepared, as early as possible, to fight a
stiff defensive battle on the main line of resistance.</p>
