     name="chap1"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">The Great West, prior to the century's turn, abounded in
  legend. Stories were told of fabled gunmen whose bullets always magically
  found their mark, of mighty stallions whose tireless gallop rivaled the speed
  of the wind, of glorious women whose beauty stunned mind and heart. But
  nowhere in the vast spread of the mountain-desert country was there a greater
  legend told than the story of Red Pierre and the phantom gunfighter,
  McGurk.</p>

  <p>These two men of the wilderness, so unalike, of widely-differing
  backgrounds, had in common a single trait: each was unbeatable. Fate brought
  them clashing together, thunder to thunder, lightning to lightning. They were
  destined to meet at the crossroads of a long, long trail&mdash;a trail which
  began in the northern wastes of Canada and led, finally, to a deadly
  confrontation in the mountains of the Far West.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed that Father Anthony gathered all the warmth of the
  short northern summer and kept it for winter use, for his good nature was an
  actual physical force. From his ruddy face beamed such a kindliness that
  people reached out toward him as they might extend their hands toward a
  comfortable fire.</p>

  <p>All the labors of his work as an inspector of Jesuit institutions across
  the length and breadth of Canada could not lessen the good father's
  enthusiasm; his smile was as indefatigable as his critical eyes. The one
  looked sharply into every corner of a room and every nook and hidden cranny
  of thoughts and deeds; the other veiled the criticism and soothed the wounds
  of vanity.</p>

  <p>On this day, however, the sharp eyes grew a little less keen and somewhat
  wider, while that smile was fixed rather by habit than inclination. In fact,
  his expression might be called a frozen kindliness as he looked across the
  table to Father Victor.</p>

  <p>It required a most indomitable geniality, indeed, to outface the rigid
  piety of Jean Paul Victor. His missionary work had carried him far north,
  where the cold burns men thin. The zeal which drove him north and north and
  north over untracked regions, drove him until his body failed, drove him even
  now, though his body was crippled.</p>

  <p>A mighty yearning, and a still mightier self-contempt whipped him on, and
  the school over which he was master groaned and suffered under his régime.
  Father Anthony said gently: "Are there none among all your lads, dear Father
  Victor, whom you find something more than imperfect machines?"</p>

  <p>The man of the north drew from a pocket of his robe a letter. His lean
  fingers touched it almost with a caress.</p>

  <p>"One. Pierre Ryder. He shall carry on my mission in the north. I, who am
  silent, have done much; but Pierre will do more. I had to fight my first
  battle to conquer my own stubborn soul, and the battle left me weak for the
  great work in the snows, but Pierre will not fight that battle, for I have
  trained him.</p>

  <p>"This letter is for him. Shall we not carry it to him? For two days I have
  not seen Pierre."</p>

  <p>Father Anthony winced.</p>

  <p>He said: "Do you deny yourself even the pleasure of the lad's company?
  Alas, Father Victor, you forge your own spurs and goad yourself with your own
  hands. What harm is there in being often with the lad?"</p>

  <p>The sneer returned to the lips of Jean Paul Victor.</p>

  <p>"The purpose would be lost&mdash;lost to my eyes and lost to his
  &mdash;the purpose for which I have lived and for which he shall live. When I
  first saw him he was a child, a baby, but he came to me and took one finger
  of my hand in his small fist and looked up to me. Ah, Gabrielle, the smile of
  an infant goes to the heart swifter than the thrust of a knife! I looked down
  upon him and I knew that I was chosen to teach the child. There was a voice
  that spoke in me. You will smile, but even now I think I can hear it."</p>

  <p>"I swear to you that I believe," said Father Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Another man would have given Pierre a Bible and a Latin grammar and a
  cell. I gave him the testament and the grammar; I gave him also the wild
  north country to say his prayers in and patter his Latin. I taught his mind,
  but I did not forget his body.</p>

  <p>"He is to go out among wild men. He must have strength of the spirit. He
  must also have a strength of the body that they will understand and respect.
  He can ride a horse standing; he can run a hundred miles in a day behind a
  dog- team. He can wrestle and fight with his hands, for skilled men have
  taught him. I have made him a thunderbolt to hurl among the ignorant and the
  unenlightened; and this is the hand which shall wield it. Ha!</p>

  <p>"It is now hardly a six month since he saved a trapper from a bobcat and
  killed the animal with a knife. It must have been my prayers which saved him
  from the teeth and the claws."</p>

  <p>Good Father Anthony rose.</p>

  <p>"You have described a young David. I am eager to see him. Let us go."</p>

  <p>Father Victor nodded, and the two went out together. The chill of the open
  was hardly more than the bitter cold inside the building, but there was a
  wind that drove the cold through the blood and bones of a man.</p>

  <p>They staggered along against it until they came to a small house, long and
  low. On the sheltered side they paused to take breath, and Father Victor
  explained: "This is his hour in the gymnasium. To make the body strong
  required thought and care. Mere riding and running and swinging of the ax
  will not develop every muscle. Here Pierre works every day. His teachers of
  boxing and wrestling have abandoned him."</p>

  <p>There was almost a smile on the lean face.</p>

  <p>"The last man left with a swollen jaw and limping on one leg."</p>

  <p>Here he opened the door, and they slipped inside. The air was warmed by a
  big stove, and the room&mdash;for the afternoon was dark&mdash;lighted by two
  swinging lanterns suspended from the low roof. By that illumination Father
  Anthony saw two men stripped naked, save for a loincloth, and circling each
  other slowly in the center of a ring which was fenced in with ropes and
  floored with a padded mat.</p>

  <p>Of the two wrestlers, one was a veritable giant, swarthy of skin, hairy-
  chested. His great hands were extended to grasp or to parry&mdash;his head
  lowered with a ferocious scowl&mdash;and across his forehead swayed a tuft of
  black, shaggy hair. He might have stood for one of those northern barbarians
  whom the Romans loved to pit against their native champions in the arena. He
  was the greater because of the opponent he faced, and it was upon this
  opponent that the eyes of Father Anthony centered.</p>

  <p>Like Father Victor, he was caught first by the bright hair. It was a dark
  red, and where the light struck it strongly there were places like fire. Down
  from this hair the light slipped like running water over a lithe body,
  slender at the hips, strong-chested, round and smooth of limb, with long
  muscles leaping and trembling at every move.</p>

  <p>He, like the big fighter, circled cautiously about, but the impression he
  gave was as different from the other as day is from night. His head was
  carried high; in place of a scowl, he smiled with a sort of eagerness, a
  light which was partly exultation and partly mischief sparkled in his eyes.
  Once or twice the giant caught at the other, but David slipped from under the
  grip of Goliath easily. It seemed as if his skin were oiled. The big man
  snarled with anger, and lunged more eagerly at Pierre.</p>

  <p>The two, abandoning their feints, suddenly rushed together, and the
  swarthy arms of the monster slipped around the white body of Pierre. For a
  moment they whirled, twisting and struggling.</p>

  <p>"Now!" murmured Father Victor; and as if in answer to a command, Pierre
  slipped down, whipped his hands to a new grip, and the two crashed to the
  mat, with Pierre above.</p>

  <p>"Open your eyes, Father Anthony. The lad is safe. How Goliath grunts!" The
  boy had not cared to follow his advantage, but rose and danced away, laughing
  softly. The Canuck floundered up and rushed like a furious bull. His downfall
  was only the swifter. The impact of the two bodies sounded like hands clapped
  together, and then Goliath rose into the air, struggling mightily, and
  pitched with a thud to the mat.</p>

  <p>He writhed there, for the wind was knocked from his body by the fall. At
  length he struggled to a sitting posture and glared up at the conqueror. The
  boy reached out a hand to his fallen foe.</p>

  <p>"You would have thrown me that way the first time," he said, "but you let
  me change grips on you. In another week you will be too much for me, <i>bon
  ami</i>."</p>

  <p>The other accepted the hand after an instant of hesitation and was dragged
  to his feet. He stood looking down into the boy's face with a singular grin.
  But there was no triumph in the eye of Pierre&mdash;only a good-natured
  interest.</p>

  <p>"In another week," answered the giant, "there would not be a sound bone in
  my body."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

  <p class="first">"You have seen him," murmured the tall priest. "Now let us
  go back and wait for him. I will leave word."</p>

  <p>He touched one of the two or three men who were watching the athletes, and
  whispered his message in the other's ear. Then he went back with Father
  Anthony. "You have seen him," he repeated, when they sat once more in the
  cheerless room. "Now pronounce on him."</p>

  <p>The other answered: "I have seen a wonderful body&mdash;but the mind,
  Father Victor?"</p>

  <p>"It is as simple as that of a child&mdash;his thoughts run as clear as
  spring water."</p>

  <p>"But suppose a strange thought came in the mind of your Pierre. It would
  be like the pebbles in swift-running spring water. He would carry it on,
  rushing. It would tear away the old boundaries of his mind&mdash;it might
  wipe out the banks you have set down for him&mdash;it might tear away the
  choicest teachings."</p>

  <p>Father Victor sat straight and stiff with stern, set lips. He said dryly:
  "Father Anthony has been much in the world."</p>

  <p>"I speak from the best intention, good father. Look you, now, I have seen
  that same red hair and those same lighted blue eyes before, and wherever I
  have seen them has been war and trouble and unrest. I have seen that same
  smile which stirs the heart of a woman and makes a man reach for his
  revolver. This boy whose mind is so clear&mdash;arm him with a single wrong
  thought, with a single doubt of the eternal goodness of God's plans, and he
  will be a thunderbolt indeed, dear Father, but one which even your strong
  hand could not control."</p>

  <p>"I have heard you," said the priest; "but you will see. He is coming
  now."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door; then it opened and showed a modest novice
  in a simple gown of black serge girt at the waist with the flat encircling
  band. His head was downward; it was not till the blue eyes flashed
  inquisitively up that Father Anthony recognized Pierre.</p>

  <p>The hard voice of Jean Paul Victor pronounced: "This is that Father
  Anthony of whom I have spoken."</p>

  <p>The novice slipped to his knees and folded his hands, while the plump
  fingers of Father Anthony poised over that dark red hair, pressed smooth on
  top where the skullcap rested. The blessing which he spoke was Latin, and
  Father Victor looked somewhat anxiously toward his protege till the latter
  answered in a diction so pure that Cicero himself would have smiled to hear
  it.</p>

  <p>"Stand up!" cried Father Anthony. "By heavens, Jean Paul, it is the purest
  Latin I have heard this twelvemonth."</p>

  <p>And the lad answered: "It must be pure Latin; Father Victor has taught
  me."</p>

  <p>Gabrielle Anthony stared, and to save him from too obvious confusion the
  other priest interrupted: "I have a letter for you, my son."</p>

  <p>And he passed the envelope to Pierre. The latter examined it with
  interest. "This comes from the south. It is marked from the United
  States."</p>

  <p>"So far!" exclaimed the tall priest. "Give me the letter, lad."</p>

  <p>But here he caught the whimsical eyes of Father Anthony, and he allowed
  his outstretched hand to fall. Yet he scowled as he said: "No; keep it and
  read it, Pierre."</p>

  <p>"I have no great wish to keep it," answered Pierre, studying anxiously the
  dark brow of the priest.</p>

  <p>"It is yours. Open it and read."</p>

  <p>The lad obeyed instantly. He shook out the folded paper and moved a little
  nearer the light. Then he read aloud, as if it had never entered his mind
  that what was addressed to him might be meant for his eyes alone.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Morgantown,<br>
  <br>
  "R.F.D. No. 4.<br>
  <br>
  "SON PIERRE:<br>
  <br>
  "Here I lie with a chunk of lead from the gun of Bob McGurk resting
  somewheres in the insides of me, and there ain't no way of doubting that I'm
  about to go out. Now, I ain't complaining none. I've had my fling. I've eat
  my meat to order, well done and rare&mdash;mostly rare. Maybe some folks will
  be saying that I've got what I've been asking for, and I know that Bob McGurk
  got me fair and square, shooting from the hip. That don't help me none, lying
  here with a through ticket to some place that's farther south than Texas.<br>
  <br>
  "Hell ain't none too bad for me, I know. I ain't whining none. I just lie
  here and watch the world getting dimmer until I begin to be seeing things out
  of my past. That shows the devil ain't losing no time with me. But the thing
  that comes back oftenest and hits me the hardest is the sight of your mother,
  lying with you in the hollow of her arm and looking up at me and whispering,
  'Dad,' just before she went out."</p>

  <p>The hand of the boy fell, and his eyes sought the face of Father Victor.
  The latter was standing.</p>

  <p>"You told me I had no father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>An imperious arm stretched toward him.</p>

  <p>"Give me the letter."</p>

  <p>He moved to obey, and then checked himself.</p>

  <p>"This is my father's writing, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"No, no! It's a lie, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>But Pierre stood with the letter held behind his back, and the first doubt
  in his life stood up darkly in his eyes. Father Victor sank slowly back into
  his chair, his gaunt frame trembling.</p>

  <p>"Read on," he commanded.</p>

  <p>And Pierre, white of face, read on:</p>

  <p class="letter">"So I got a idea that I had to write to you, Pierre. There
  ain't nothing I can make up to you, but knowing the truth may help some. Poor
  kid, you ain't got no father in the eyes of the law, and neither did you have
  no mother, and there ain't no name that belongs to you by rights.<br>
  <br>
  "I was a man in them days, and your mother was a woman that brought your
  heart into your throat and set it singing. She and me, we were too busy being
  just plain happy to care much about what was right or wrong; so you just sort
  of happened along, Pierre. Me being so close to hell, I remember her eyes
  that was bluer than heaven looking up to me, and her hair, that was copper
  with gold lights in it.<br>
  <br>
  "I buried Irene on the side of the mountain under a big, rough rock, and I
  didn't carve nothing on the rock. Then I took you, Pierre, and I knew I
  wasn't no sort of a man to raise up the son of Irene; so I brought you to
  Father Victor on a winter night and left you in his arms. That was after I'd
  done my best to raise you and you was just about old enough to chatter a bit.
  There wasn't nothing else to do. My wife, she went pretty near crazy when I
  brought you home. And she'd of killed you, Pierre, if I hadn't took you
  away.<br>
  <br>
  "You see, I was married before I met Irene. So there ain't no alibi for me.
  But me being so close to hell now, I look back to that time, and somehow I
  see no wrong in it still.<br>
  <br>
  "And if I done wrong then, I've got my share of hell-fire for it. Here I lie,
  with my boys, Bill and Bert, sitting around in the corner of the room waiting
  for me to go out. They ain't men, Pierre. They're wolves in the skins of men.
  They're the right sons of their mother. When I go out they'll grab the coin
  I've saved up, and leave me to lie here and rot, maybe.<br>
  <br>
  "Lad, it's a fearful thing to die without having no one around that cares,
  and to know that even after I've gone out I'm going to lie here and have my
  dead eyes looking up at the ceiling. So I'm writing to you, Pierre, part to
  tell you what you ought to know; part because I got a sort of crazy idea that
  maybe you could get down here to me before I go out.<br>
  <br>
  "You don't owe me nothing but hard words, Pierre; but if you don't try to
  come to me, the ghost of your mother will follow you all your life, lad, and
  you'll be seeing her blue eyes and the red-gold of her hair in the dark of
  the night as I see it now. Me, I'm a hard man, but it breaks my heart, that
  ghost of Irene. So here I'll lie, waiting for you, Pierre, and lingering out
  the days with whisky, and fighting the wolf eyes of them there sons of mine.
  If I weaken &mdash;If they find they can look me square in the
  eye&mdash;they'll finish me quick and make off with the coin. Pierre, come
  quick.<br>
  <br>
  "MARTIN RYDER."</p>

  <p>The hand of Pierre dropped slowly to his side, and the letter fluttered
  with a crisp rustling to the floor.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

  <p class="first">Then came a voice that startled the two priests, for it
  seemed that a fourth man had entered the room, so changed was it from the
  musical voice of Pierre.</p>

  <p>"Father Victor, the roan is a strong horse. May I take him?"</p>

  <p>"Pierre!" and the priest reached out his bony hands.</p>

  <p>But the boy did not seem to notice or to understand.</p>

  <p>"It is a long journey, and I will need a strong horse. It must be eight
  hundred miles to that town."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, what claim has he upon you? What debt have you to repay?"</p>

  <p>And Pierre le Rouge answered: "He loved my mother."</p>

  <p>"You are going?"</p>

  <p>The boy asked in astonishment: "Would you not have me go, Father?"</p>

  <p>And Jean Paul Victor could not meet the sorrowful blue eyes.</p>

  <p>He bowed his head and answered: "My child, I would have you go. But
  promise with your hand in mine that you will come back to me when your father
  is buried."</p>

  <p>The lean fingers caught the extended hand of Pierre and froze about
  it.</p>

  <p>"But first I have a second duty in the southland."</p>

  <p>"A second?"</p>

  <p>"You taught me to shoot and to use a knife. Once you said: 'An eye for an
  eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' Father Victor, my father was killed by another
  man."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, dear lad, swear to me here on this cross that you will not raise
  your hands against the murderer. 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.'"</p>

  <p>"He must have an instrument for his wrath. He shall work through me in
  this."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, you blaspheme."</p>

  <p>"'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'"</p>

  <p>"It was a demon in me that quoted that in your hearing, and not
  myself."</p>

  <p>"The horse, Father Victor&mdash;may I have the roan?"</p>

  <p>"Pierre, I command you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The light in the blue eyes was as cold and steady as that in the starved
  eyes of Jean Paul Victor.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he said calmly. "For the sake of the love that I bear for you, do
  not command me."</p>

  <p>The stern priest dropped his head. He said at last: "I have nothing saving
  one great and terrible treasure which I see was predestined to you. It is the
  cross of Father Meilan. You have worn it before. You shall wear it hereafter
  as your own."</p>

  <p>He took from his own neck a silver cross suspended by a slender silver
  chain, and the boy, with startled eyes, dropped to his knees and received the
  gift.</p>

  <p>"It has brought good to all who possessed it, but for every good thing
  that it works for you it will work evil on some other. Great is its blessing
  and great is its burden. I, alas, know; but you also have heard of its
  history. Do you accept it, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"Dear Father, with all my heart."</p>

  <p>The colorless hands touched the dark-red hair.</p>

  <p>"God pardon the sins you shall commit."</p>

  <p>Pierre crushed the hand of Jean Paul Victor against his lips and rushed
  from the room, while the tall priest, staring down at the fingers which had
  been kissed, pronounced: "I have forged a thunderbolt, Father Gabrielle. It
  is too great for my hand. Listen!" And they heard clearly the sharp clang of
  a horse's hoofs on the hard-packed snow, loud at first, but fading rapidly
  away. The wind, increasing suddenly, shook the house furiously about
  them.</p>

  <p>It was a north wind, and traveled south before the rider of the strong
  roan. Over a thousand miles of plain and hills it passed, and down into the
  cattle country of the mountain-desert which the Rockies hem on one side and
  the tall Sierras on the other.</p>

  <p>It was a trail to try even the endurance of Pierre and the strong roan,
  but the boy clung to it doggedly. On a trail that led down from the edges of
  the northern mountain the roan crashed to the ground in a plunging fall,
  hitting heavily on his knees. He was dead before the boy had freed his feet
  from the stirrups.</p>

  <p>Pierre threw the saddle over his shoulder and walked eight miles to the
  nearest ranch house, where he spent practically the last cent of his money on
  another horse, and drove on south once more.</p>

  <p>There was little hope in him as day after day slipped past. Only the ghost
  of a chance remained that Martin Ryder could fight away death for another
  fortnight; yet Pierre had seen many a man from the mountain-desert stave off
  the end through weeks and weeks of the bitterest suffering. His father must
  be a man of the same hard durable metal, and upon that Pierre staked all his
  hopes.</p>

  <p>And always he carried the picture of the dying man alone with his two
  wolf-eyed sons who waited for his eyes to weaken. Whenever he thought of that
  he touched his horse with the spurs and rode fiercely for a time. They were
  his flesh and blood, the man, and even the two wolf-eyed sons.</p>

  <p>So he came at last to a gap in the hills and looked down on Morgantown in
  the hollow, twoscore unpainted houses sprawling along a single street. The
  snow was everywhere white and pure, and the town was like a stain on the
  landscape with wisps of smoke rising and trailing across the hilltops.</p>

  <p>Down to the edge of the town he rode, left his cow-pony standing with
  hanging head outside a saloon, strode through the swinging doors, and asked
  of the bartender the way to the house of Martin Ryder.</p>

  <p>The bartender stopped in his labor of rubbing down the surface of his bar
  and stared at the black-serge robe of the stranger, with curiosity rather
  than criticism, for women, madmen, and clergymen have the right-of-way in the
  mountain-desert.</p>

  <p>He said: "Well, I'll be damned!&mdash;askin' your pardon. So old Mart
  Ryder has come down to this, eh? Partner, you're sure going to have a rough
  ride getting Mart to heaven. Better send a posse along with him, because some
  first-class angels are going to get considerable riled when they sight him
  coming. Ha, ha, ha! Sure I'll show you the way. Take the northwest road out
  of town and go five miles till you see a broken-backed shack lyin' over to
  the right. That's Mart Ryder's place."</p>

  <p>Out to the broken-backed shack rode Pierre le Rouge, Pierre the Red, as
  everyone in the north country knew him. His second horse, staunch cow-pony
  that it was, stumbled on with sagging knees and hanging head, but Pierre rode
  upright, at ease, for his mind was untired.</p>

  <p>Broken-backed indeed was the house before which he dismounted. The roof
  sagged from end to end, and the stove pipe chimney leaned at a drunken angle.
  Nature itself was withered beside that house; before the door stood a great
  cottonwood, gashed and scarred by lightning, with the limbs almost entirely
  stripped away from one side. Under this broken monster Pierre stepped and
  through the door. Two growls like the snarls of watch-dogs greeted him, and
  two tall, unshaven men barred his way. Behind them, from the bed in the
  corner, a feeble voice called: "Who's there?"</p>

  <p>"In the name of God," said the boy gravely, for he saw a hollow-eyed
  specter staring toward him from the bed in the corner, "let me pass! I am his
  son!"</p>

  <p>It was not that which made them give back, but a shrill, faint cry of
  triumph from the sick man toward which they turned. Pierre slipped past them
  and stood above Martin Ryder. He was wasted beyond belief&mdash;only the
  monster hand showed what he had been.</p>

  <p>"Son?" he queried with yearning and uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"Pierre, your son."</p>

  <p>And he slipped to his knees beside the bed. The heavy hand fell upon his
  hair and stroked it.</p>

  <p>"There ain't no ways of doubting it. It's red silk, like the hair of
  Irene. Seein' you, boy, it ain't so hard to die. Look up! So! Pierre, my son!
  Are you scared of me, boy?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid."</p>

  <p>"Not with them eyes you ain't. Now that you're here, pay the coyotes and
  let 'em go off to gnaw the bones."</p>

  <p>He dragged out a small canvas bag from beneath the blankets and gestured
  toward the two lurkers in the corner.</p>

  <p>"Take it, and be damned to you!"</p>

  <p>A dirty, yellow hand seized the bag; there was a chortle of exultation,
  and the two scurried out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Three weeks they've watched an' waited for me to go out, Pierre. Three
  weeks they've waited an' sneaked up to my bed an' sneaked away agin, seein'
  my eyes open."</p>

  <p>Looking into their fierce fever brightness, Pierre understood why they had
  quailed. For the man, though wrecked beyond hope of living, was terrible
  still. The thick, gray stubble on his face could not hide altogether the hard
  lines of mouth and jaw, and on the wasted arm the hand was grotesquely huge.
  It was horror that widened the eyes of Pierre as he looked at Martin Ryder;
  it was a grim happiness that made his lips almost smile.</p>

  <p>"You've taken holy orders, lad?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But the black dress?"</p>

  <p>"I'm only a novice. I've sworn no vows."</p>

  <p>"And you don't hate me&mdash;you hold no grudge against me for the sake of
  your mother?"</p>

  <p>Pierre took the heavy hand.</p>

  <p>"Are you not my father? And my mother was happy with you. For her sake I
  love you."</p>

  <p>"The good Father Victor. He sent you to me."</p>

  <p>"I came of my own will. He would not have let me go."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he would have kept my flesh and blood away from me?"</p>

  <p>"Do not reproach him. He would have kept me from a sin."</p>

  <p>"Sin? By God, boy, no matter what I've done, is it sin for my son to come
  to me? What sin?"</p>

  <p>"The sin of murder!"</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"I have come to find McGurk."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

  <p class="first">Like some old father-bear watching his cub flash teeth
  against a stalking lynx, half proud and half fearful of such courage, so the
  dying cattleman looked at his son. Excitement set a high and dangerous color
  in his cheek. "Pierre&mdash;brave boy! Look at me. I ain't no imitation man,
  even now, but I ain't a ghost of what I was. There wasn't no man I wouldn't
  of met fair and square with bare hands or with a gun. Maybe my hands was big,
  but they were fast on the draw. I've lived all my life with iron on the hip,
  and my six-gun has seven notches.</p>

  <p>"But McGurk downed me fair and square. There wasn't no murder. I was out
  for his hide, and he knew it. I done the provokin', an' he jest done the
  finishin', that was all. It hurts me a lot to say it, but he's a better man
  than I was. A kid like you, why, he'd jest eat you, Pierre."</p>

  <p>Pierre le Rouge smiled again. He felt a stern pride to be the son of this
  man.</p>

  <p>"So that's settled," went on Martin Ryder, "an' a damned good thing it is.
  Son, you didn't come none too soon. I'm goin' out fast. There ain't enough
  light left in me so's I can see my own way. Here's all I ask: When I die
  touch my eyelids soft an' draw 'em shut&mdash;I've seen the look in a dead
  man's eyes. Close 'em, and I know I'll go to sleep an' have good dreams. And
  down in the middle of Morgantown is the buryin'-ground. I've ridden past it a
  thousand times an' watched a corner plot, where the grass grows quicker than
  it does anywheres else in the cemetery. Pierre, I'd die plumb easy if I knew
  I was goin' to sleep the rest of time in that place."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done."</p>

  <p>"But that corner plot, it would cost a pile, son. And I've no money. I
  gave what I had to them wolf-eyed boys, Bill an' Bert. Money was what they
  wanted, an' after I had Irene's son with me, money was the cheapest way of
  gettin' rid of 'em."</p>

  <p>"I'll buy the plot."</p>

  <p>"Have you got that much money, lad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," lied Pierre calmly.</p>

  <p>The bright eyes grew dimmer and then fluttered close. Pierre started to
  his feet, thinking that the end had come. But the voice began again, fainter,
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"No light left inside of me, but dyin' this way is easy. There ain't no
  wind will blow on me after I'm dead, but I'll be blanketed safe from head to
  foot in cool, sweet-smellin' sod&mdash;the kind that has tangles of the roots
  of grass. There ain't no snow will reach to me where I lie. There ain't no
  sun will burn down to me. Dyin' like that is jest&mdash;goin' to sleep."</p>

  <p>After that he said nothing for a time, and the late afternoon darkened
  slowly through the room.</p>

  <p>As for Pierre, he did not move, and his mind went back. He did not see the
  bearded wreck who lay dying before him, but a picture of Irene, with the sun
  lighting her copper hair with places of burning gold, and a handsome young
  giant beside her. They rode together on some upland trail at sunset time,
  sharply framed against the bright sky.</p>

  <p>There was a whisper below him: "Irene!"</p>

  <p>And Pierre looked down to blankly staring eyes. He groaned, and dropped to
  his knees.</p>

  <p>"I have come for you," said the whisper, "because the time has come,
  Irene. We have to ride out together. We have a long ways to go. Are you
  ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! It's a wonderful night. The stars are asking us out. Quick!
  Into your saddle. Now the spurs. So! We are alone and free, with the winds
  around us, and all that we have been forgotten behind us."</p>

  <p>The eyes opened wide and stared up; without a stir in the great, gaunt
  body, he was dead. Pierre reverently drew the eyes shut. There were no tears
  in his eyes, but a feeling of hollowness about his heart. He straightened and
  looked about him and found that the room was quite dark.</p>

  <p>So in the dimness Pierre fumbled, by force of habit, at his throat, and
  found the cross which he wore by a silver chain about his throat. He held it
  in a great grip and closed his eyes and prayed. When he opened his eyes again
  it was almost deep night in the room, and Pierre had passed from youth to
  manhood. Through the gloom nothing stood out distinctly save the white face
  of the dead man, and from that Pierre looked quickly away.</p>

  <p>One by one he numbered his obligations to Martin Ryder, and first and last
  he remembered the lie which had soothed his father. The money for that corner
  plot where the grass grew first in the spring of the year&mdash;where was he
  to find it? He fumbled in his pocket and found only a single coin.</p>

  <p>He leaned back against the wall and strove to concentrate on the problem,
  but his thoughts wandered in spite of himself. Looking backward, he
  remembered all things much more clearly than when he had actually seen them.
  For instance, he recalled now that as he walked through the door the two
  figures which had started up to block his way had left behind them some
  playing-cards at the corner table. One of these cards had slipped from the
  edge of the board and flickered slowly to the floor.</p>

  <p>With that memory the thoughts of Pierre le Rouge stopped. The picture of
  the falling card remained; all else went out in his mind like the snuffing of
  the candle. Then, as if he heard a voice directing him through the utter
  blackness of the room, he knew what he must do.</p>

  <p>All his wealth was the single half-dollar piece in his pocket, and there
  was only one way in which that coin could be increased to the sum he would
  need to buy that corner plot, where the soul of old Martin Ryder could sleep
  long and deep.</p>

  <p>From his brothers he would get no help. The least memory of those sallow,
  hungry faces convinced him of that.</p>

  <p>There remained the gaming table. In the north country he had watched men
  sit in a silent circle, smoking, drinking, with the flare of an oil-lamp
  against deep, seamed faces, and only the slip and whisper of card against
  card.</p>

  <p>Cold conscience tapped the shoulder of Pierre, remembering the lessons of
  Father Victor, but a moment later his head went up and his eyes were shining
  through the dark. After all, the end justified the means.</p>

  <p>A moment later he was laughing softly as a boy in the midst of a prank,
  and busily throwing off the robe of serge. Fumbling through the night he
  located the shirt and trousers he had seen hanging from a nail on the wall.
  Into these he slipped, and then went out under the open sky.</p>

  <p>The rest had revived the strength of the tough little cow-pony, and he
  drove on at a gallop toward the twinkling lights of Morgantown. There was a
  new consciousness about Pierre as if he had changed his whole nature with his
  clothes. The sober sense of duty which had kept him in awe all his life like
  a lifted finger, was almost gone, and in its place was a joyous freedom.</p>

  <p>For the first time he faintly realized what an existence other than that
  of a priest might be. Now for a brief moment he could forget the part of the
  subdued novice and become merely a man with nothing about him to distinguish
  him from other men, nothing to make heads turn at his approach and raise
  whispers as he passed.</p>

  <p>It was a game, but he rejoiced in it as a girl does in her first
  masquerade. Tomorrow he must be grave and sober-footed and an example to
  other men; tonight he could frolic as he pleased.</p>

  <p>So Pierre le Rouge tossed back his head and laughed up to the frosty
  stars. The loose sleeves and the skirts of the robe no longer entangled his
  limbs. He threw up his arms and shouted. A hillside caught the sound and
  echoed it back to him with a wonderful clearness, and up and down the long
  ravine beat the clatter of the flying hoofs. The whole world shouted and
  laughed and rode with him on Morgantown.</p>

  <p>If the people in the houses that he passed had known they would have
  started up from their chairs and taken rifle and horse and chased after him
  on the trail. But how could they tell from the passing of those ringing hoofs
  that Pierre, the novice, was dead, and Red Pierre was born?</p>

  <p>So they drowsed on about their comfortable fires, and Pierre drew rein
  with a jerk before the largest of Morgantown's saloons. He had to set his
  teeth before he could summon the resolution to throw open the door. It was
  done; he stepped inside, and stood blinking in the sudden rush of light
  against his face.</p>

  <p>It was all bewildering at first; the radiance, the blue tangle of smoke,
  the storm of voices. For Muldoon's was packed from door to door. Coins rang
  in a steady chorus along the bar, and the crowd waited three and four
  deep.</p>

  <p>Someone was singing a rollicking song of the range at one end of the bar,
  and a chorus of four bellowed a profane parody at the other end.</p>

  <p>The ears of Pierre le Rouge tingled hotly, and partly to escape the uproar
  he worked his way to the quieter room at the back of the saloon.</p>

  <p>It was almost as crowded as the bar, but here no one spoke except for an
  occasional growl. Sudden speaking, and a loud voice, indeed, was hardly safe.
  Someone cursed at his ill-luck as Pierre entered, and a dozen hands reached
  for six-guns. In such a place one had to be prepared.</p>

  <p>Pierre remembered with quick dismay that he was not armed. All his life
  the straight black gown had been weapon enough to make all men give way
  before him. Now he carried no borrowed strength upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Automatically he slipped his fingers under the breast of his shirt until
  their tips touched the cold metal of the cross. That gave him stronger
  courage. The joy of the adventure made his blood warm again as he drew out
  his one coin and looked for a place to start his venture.</p>

  <p>So he approached the nearest table. On the surface of it were marked six
  squares with chalk, and each with its appropriate number. The man who ran the
  game stood behind the table and shook three dice. The numbers which turned up
  paid the gambler. The numbers which failed to show paid the owner of the
  game.</p>

  <p>His luck had been too strong that night, and now only two men faced him,
  and both of them lost persistently. They were "bucking" the dice with savage
  stubbornness.</p>

  <p>Pierre edged closer, shut his eyes, and deposited his coin. When he looked
  again he saw that he had wagered on the five.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

  <p class="first">The dice clattered across the table and were swept up by the
  hand of the man behind the table before Pierre could note them. Sick at
  heart, he began to turn away, as he saw that hand reach out and gather in the
  coins of the other two bettors. It went out a third time and laid another
  fifty-cent piece upon his. The heart of Pierre bounded up to his throat.</p>

  <p>Again the dice rolled, and this time he saw distinctly two fives turn up.
  Two dollars in silver were dropped upon his, and still he let the money lie.
  Again, again, and again the dice rolled. And now there were pieces of gold
  among the silver that covered the square of the five. The other two looked
  askance at him, and the owner of the game growled: "Gimme room for the coins,
  stranger, will you?"</p>

  <p>Pierre picked up his winnings. In his left hand he held them, and the
  coins brimmed his cupped palm. With the free hand he placed his new wagers.
  But he lost now.</p>

  <p>"I cannot win forever," thought Pierre, and redoubled his bets in an
  effort to regain the lost ground.</p>

  <p>Still his little fortune dwindled, till the sweat came out on his forehead
  and the blood that had flushed his face ran back and left him pale with
  dread. And at last there remained only one gold piece. He hesitated, holding
  it poised for the wager, while the owner of the game rattled the dice loudly
  and looked up at the coin with hungry eyes.</p>

  <p>Once more Pierre closed his eyes and laid his wager, while his empty left
  hand slipped again inside his shirt and touched the metal of the cross, and
  once more when he opened his eyes the hand of the gambler was going out to
  lay a second coin over his.</p>

  <p>"It is the cross!" thought Pierre. "It is the cross which brings me
  luck."</p>

  <p>The dice rattled out. He won. Again, and still he won. The gambler wiped
  his forehead and looked up anxiously. For these were wagers in gold, and the
  doubling stakes were running high. About Pierre a crowd had grown&mdash;a
  dozen cattlemen who watched the growing heap of gold with silent fascination.
  Then they began to make wagers of their own, and there were faint whispers of
  wrath and astonishment as the dice clicked out and each time the winnings of
  Pierre doubled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the dealer stopped and held up his left hand as a warning. With
  his right, very slowly, inch by inch lest anyone should suspect him of a
  gunplay, he drew out a heavy forty-five and laid it on the table with the
  belt of cartridges. "Three years she's been on my hip through thick and thin,
  stranger. Three years she's shot close an' true. There ain't a butt in the
  world that hugs your hand tighter. There ain't a cylinder that spins easier.
  Shoot? Lad, even a kid like you could be a killer with that six-gun. What
  will you lay ag'in' it?"</p>

  <p>And his red-stained eyes glanced covetously at the yellow heap of Pierre's
  money.</p>

  <p>"How much?" said Pierre eagerly. "Is there enough on the table to buy the
  gun?"</p>

  <p>"Buy?" said the other fiercely. "There ain't enough coin west of the
  Rockies to buy that gun. D'you think I'm yaller enough to sell my six? No,
  but I'll risk it in a fair bet. There ain't no disgrace in that; eh,
  pals?"</p>

  <p>There was a chorus of low grunts of assent.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Pierre. "That pile against the gun."</p>

  <p>"All of it?"</p>

  <p>"All."</p>

  <p>"Look here, kid, if you're tryin' to play a charity game with me
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Charity?"</p>

  <p>The frank surprise of that look disarmed the other. He swept up the dice-
  box, and shook it furiously, while his lips stirred. It was as if he murmured
  an incantation for success. The dice rolled out, winking in the light, spun
  over, and the owner of the gun stood with both hands braced against the edge
  of the table, and stared hopelessly down.</p>

  <p>A moment before his pockets had sagged with a precious weight, and there
  had been a significant drag of the belt over his right hip. Now both burdens
  were gone.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm dry. Who'll stake me to a drink?"</p>

  <p>Pierre scooped up a dozen pieces of the gold.</p>

  <p>"Here."</p>

  <p>The other drew back. "You're very welcome to it. Here's more, if you'll
  have it."</p>

  <p>"The coin I've lost to you? Take back a gamblin' debt?"</p>

  <p>"Easy there," said one of the men. "Don't you see the kid's green? Here's
  a five-spot."</p>

  <p>The loser accepted the coin as carelessly as if he were conferring a favor
  by taking it, cast another scowl in the direction of Pierre, and went out
  toward the bar. Pierre, very hot in the face, pocketed his winnings and
  belted on the gun. It hung low on his thigh, just in easy gripping distance
  of his hand, and he fingered the butt with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The kid's feelin' most a man," remarked a sarcastic voice. "Say, kid, why
  don't you try your luck with Mac Hurley? He's almost through with poor old
  Cochrane."</p>

  <p>Following the direction of the pointing finger, Pierre saw one of those
  mute tragedies of the gambling hall. Cochrane, an old cattleman whose
  carefully trimmed, pointed white beard and slender, tapering fingers set him
  apart from the others in the room, was rather far gone with liquor. He was
  still stiffly erect in his chair, and would be till the very moment
  consciousness left him, but his eyes were misty, and when he spoke his lips
  moved slowly, as though numbed by cold.</p>

  <p>Beside him stood a tall, black bottle with a little whisky glass to flank
  it. He made his bets with apparent carelessness, but with a real and
  deepening gloom. Once or twice he glanced up sharply as though reckoning his
  losses, though it seemed to Pierre le Rouge almost like an appeal.</p>

  <p>And what appeal could affect Mac Hurley? There was no color in the man,
  either body or soul. No emotion could show in those pale, small eyes or
  change the color of the flabby cheeks. If his hands had been cut off, he
  might have seemed some sodden victim of a drug habit, but the hands saved
  him.</p>

  <p>They seemed to belong to another body&mdash;beautiful, swift, and strong,
  and grafted by some foul mischance onto this rotten hulk. Very white they
  were, and long, with a nervous uneasiness in every motion, continually
  hovering around the cards with little touches which were almost caresses.</p>

  <p>"It ain't a game," said the man who had first pointed out the group to
  Pierre, "it's just a slaughter. Cochrane's too far gone to see straight. Look
  at that deal now! A kid could see that he's crooking the cards!"</p>

  <p>It was blackjack, and Hurley, as usual, was dealing. He dealt with one
  hand, flipping the cards out with a snap of the wrist, the fingers working
  rapidly over the pack. Now and then he glanced over to the crowd, as if to
  enjoy their admiration of his skill. He was showing it now, not so much by
  the deftness of his cheating as by the openness with which he exposed his
  tricks.</p>

  <p>As the stranger remarked to Pierre, a child could have discovered that the
  cards were being dealt at will from the top and the bottom of the pack, but
  the gambler was enjoying himself by keeping his game just open enough to be
  apparent to every other man in the room&mdash;just covert enough to deceive
  the drink-misted brain of Cochrane. And the pale, swinish eyes twinkled as
  they stared across the dull sorrow of the old man. There was an ominous sound
  from Pierre: "Do you let a thing like that happen in this country?" he asked
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>The other turned to him with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"<i>Let</i> it happen? Who'll stop him? Say, partner, you ain't meanin' to
  say that you don't know who Hurley is?"</p>

  <p>"I don't need telling. I can see."</p>

  <p>"What you can't see means a lot more than what you can. I've been in the
  same room when Hurley worked his gun once. It wasn't any killin', but it was
  the prettiest bit of cheatin' I ever seen. But even if Hurley wasn't enough,
  what about Carl Diaz?"</p>

  <p>He glared his triumph at Pierre, but the latter was too puzzled to quail,
  and too stirred by the pale, gloomy face of Cochrane to turn toward the
  other.</p>

  <p>"What of Diaz?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, boy. You're a kid, all right, but you ain't that young. D'you
  mean to say that you ain't heard of Carlos Diaz?"</p>

  <p>It came back to Pierre then, for even into the snowbound seclusion of the
  north country the shadow of the name of Diaz had gone. He could not remember
  just what they were, but he seemed to recollect grim tales through which that
  name figured.</p>

  <p>The other went on: "But if you ain't ever seen him before, look him over
  now. They's some says he's faster on the draw than Bob McGurk, but, of
  course, that's stretchin' him out a size too much. What's the matter, kid;
  you've met McGurk?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I'm going to."</p>

  <p>"Might even be carried to him, eh&mdash;feet first?"</p>

  <p>Pierre turned and laid a hand on the shoulder of the other.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like that," he said gently. "I don't like it."</p>

  <p>The other reached up to snatch the hand from his shoulder, but he stayed
  his arm.</p>

  <p>He said after an uncomfortable moment of that silent staring: "Well,
  partner, there ain't a hell of a lot to get sore over, is there? You don't
  figure you're a mate for McGurk, do you?"</p>

  <p>He seemed oddly relieved when the eyes of Pierre moved away from him and
  returned to the figure of Carlos Diaz. The Mexican was a perfect model for a
  painting of a melodramatic villain. He had waxed and twirled the end of his
  black mustache so that it thrust out a little spur on either side of his long
  face. His habitual expression was a scowl; his habitual position was with a
  cigarette in the fingers of his left hand, and his right hand resting on his
  hip. He sat in a chair directly behind that of Hurley, and Pierre's new-found
  acquaintance explained: "He's the bodyguard for Hurley. Maybe there's some
  who could down Hurley in a straight gunfight; maybe there's one or two like
  McGurk that could down Diaz&mdash;damn his yellow hide&mdash;but there ain't
  no one can buck the two of 'em. It ain't in reason. So they play the game
  together. Hurley works the cards and Diaz covers up the retreat. Can't beat
  that, can you?"</p>

  <p>Pierre le Rouge slipped his left hand once more inside his shirt until the
  fingers touched the cross.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, that game has to stop."</p>

  <p>"Who'll&mdash;say, kid, are you stringin' me, or are you drunk? Look me in
  the eye!"</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

  <p class="first">Pierre turned and looked calmly upon the other.</p>

  <p>And the man whispered in a sort of awe: "Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

  <p>"Stand aside!"</p>

  <p>The other fell back a pace, and Pierre went straight to the table and said
  to Cochrane: "Sir, I have come to take you home."</p>

  <p>The old man looked up and rubbed his eyes as though waking from a
  sleep.</p>

  <p>"Stand back from the table!" warned Hurley.</p>

  <p>"By the Lord, have they been missing me?" queried old Cochrane. "You are
  waited for," answered Pierre le Rouge, "and I've been sent to take you
  home."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It ain't the case. The kid's lying."</p>

  <p>"Lying?" repeated Cochrane, as if he had never heard the word before, and
  he peered with clearing eyes toward Pierre. "No, I think this boy has never
  lied."</p>

  <p>Silence had spread through the place like a vapor. Even the slight sounds
  in the gaming-room were done now, and one pair after another of eyes swung
  toward the table of Cochrane and Hurley. The wave of the silence reached to
  the barroom. No one could have carried the tidings so soon, but the air was
  surcharged with the consciousness of an impending crisis.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen men started to make their way on tiptoe toward the back room.
  One stood with his whisky glass suspended in midair, and tilted back his head
  to listen. In the gaming-room Hurley pushed back his chair and leaned to the
  left, giving him a free sweep for his right hand. The Mexican smiled with a
  slow and deep content.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," answered Pierre, "but I am waiting still, sir."</p>

  <p>The left hand of Hurley played impatiently on the table.</p>

  <p>He said: "Of course, if you have enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;enough?" flared the old aristocrat.</p>

  <p>Pierre le Rouge turned fairly upon Hurley.</p>

  <p>"In the name of God," he said calmly, "make an end of your game. You're
  playing for money, but I think this man is playing for his eternal soul."</p>

  <p>The solemn, bookish phraseology came smoothly from his tongue. He knew no
  other. It drew a murmur of amusement from the room and a snarl from
  Hurley.</p>

  <p>"Put on skirts, kid, and join the Salvation Army, but don't get yourself
  messed all up in here. This is my party, and I'm damned particular who I
  invite! Now, run along!" The head of Pierre tilted back, and he burst into
  laughter which troubled even Hurley.</p>

  <p>The gambler blurted: "What's happening to you, kid?"</p>

  <p>"I've been making a lot of good resolutions, Mr. Hurley, about keeping out
  of trouble; but here I am in it up to the neck."</p>

  <p>"No trouble as long as you keep your hand out of another man's game,
  kid."</p>

  <p>"That's it. I can't see you rob Mr. Cochrane like this. You aren't
  gambling&mdash;you're digging gold. The game stops now."</p>

  <p>It was a moment before the crowd realized what was about to happen; they
  saw it reflected first in the face of Hurley, which suddenly went taut and
  pale, and then, even as they looked with a smile of curiosity and derision
  toward Pierre le Rouge, they saw and understood.</p>

  <p>For the moment Pierre said, "The game stops now," the calm which had been
  with him was gone. It was like the scent of blood to the starved wolf. The
  last word was scarcely off his tongue when he was crouched with a devil of
  green fury in his eyes&mdash;the light struck his hair into a wave of
  flame&mdash; his face altered by a dozen ugly years.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean?" whispered Hurley, as if he feared to break the silence with
  his full voice.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the room."</p>

  <p>And the impulse of Hurley, plainly enough, was to obey the order, and go
  anywhere to escape from that relentless stare. His glance wavered and flashed
  around the circle and then back to Red Pierre, for the expectancy of the
  crowd forced him back.</p>

  <p>When the leader of the pack springs and fails to kill, the rest of the
  pack tear him to pieces. Remembering this, Mac Hurley forced his glance back
  to Pierre. Moreover, there was a soft voice from behind, and he remembered
  Diaz.</p>

  <p>All this had taken place in the length of time that it takes a heavy body
  to totter on the brink of a precipice or a cat to regain its feet after a
  fall. After the voice of Diaz there was a sway through the room, a pulse of
  silence, and then three hands shot for their hips&mdash;Pierre, Diaz, and
  Hurley.</p>

  <p>No stop-watch could have caught the differing lengths of time which each
  required for the draw. The muzzle of Hurley's revolver was not clear of the
  holster&mdash;the gun of Diaz was nearly at the level when Pierre's weapon
  exploded at his hip. The bullet cut through the wrist of Hurley. Never again
  would that slender, supple hand fly over the cards, doing things other than
  they seemed. He made no effort to escape from the next bullet, but stood
  looking down at his broken wrist; horror for the moment gave him a dignity
  oddly out of place with his usual appearance. He alone in all the room was
  moveless.</p>

  <p>The crowd, undecided for an instant, broke for the doors at the first
  shot; Pierre le Rouge pitched to the floor as Diaz leaped forward, the
  revolver in either hand spitting lead and fire.</p>

  <p>It was no bullet that downed Pierre but his own cunning. He broke his fall
  with an outstretched left hand, while the bullets of Diaz pumped into the
  void space which his body had filled a moment before.</p>

  <p>Lying there at ease, he leveled the revolver, grinning with the mirthless
  lust of battle, and fired over the top of the table. The guns dropped from
  the hands of huge Diaz. He caught at his throat and staggered back the full
  length of the room, crashing against the wall. When he pitched forward on his
  face he was dead before he struck the floor.</p>

  <p>Pierre, now Red Pierre, indeed, rose and ran to the fallen man, and,
  looking at the bulk of the giant, he wondered with a cold heart. He knew
  before he slipped his hand over the breast of Diaz that this was death. Then
  he rose again and watched the still fingers which seemed to be gripping at
  the boards. These he saw, and nothing else, and all he heard was the rattling
  of the wind of winter, wrenching at some loose shingle on the roof, and he
  knew that he was alone in the world, for he had put out a life.</p>

  <p>He found a strange weight pulling down his right hand, and started when he
  saw the revolver. He replaced it in the holster automatically, and in so
  doing touched the barrel and found it warm.</p>

  <p>Then fear came to Pierre, the first real fear of his life. He jerked his
  head high and looked about him. The room was utterly empty. He tiptoed to the
  door and found even the long bar deserted, littered with tall bottles and
  overturned glasses. The cold in his heart increased. A moment before he had
  been hand in hand with all the mirth in that place.</p>

  <p>Now the men whose laughter he had repeated with smiles, the men against
  whose sleeves his elbow had touched, were further away from him than they had
  been when all the snow-covered miles from Morgantown to the school of Father
  Victor had laid between them. They were men who might lose themselves in any
  crowd, but he was set apart with a brand, even as Hurley and Diaz had been
  set apart that eventful evening.</p>

  <p>He had killed a man. That fact blotted out the world. He drew his gun
  again and stole down the length of the bar. Once he stopped and poised the
  weapon before he realized that the white, fierce face that squinted at him
  was his own reflection in a mirror.</p>

  <p>Outside the door the free wind caught at his face, and he blessed it in
  his heart, as if it had been the touch of the hand of a friend. Beyond the
  long, dark, silent street the moor rose and passed up through the safe, dark
  spaces of the sky.</p>

  <p>He must move quickly now. The pursuit was not yet organized, but it would
  begin in a space of minutes. From the group of half a dozen horses which
  stood before the saloon he selected the best&mdash;a tall, raw-boned nag with
  an ugly head. Into the saddle he swung, wondering faintly that the theft of a
  horse mattered so little to him. His was the greatest sin. All other things
  mattered nothing.</p>

  <p>Down the long street he galloped. The sharp echoes flew out at him from
  every unlighted house, but not a human being was in sight. So he swung out
  onto the long road which wound up through the hills, and beside him rode a
  grim brotherhood, the invisible fellowship of Cain.</p>

  <p>The moon rose higher, brighter, and a grotesque black shadow galloped over
  the snow beside him. He turned his head sharply to the other side and watched
  the sweep of white hills which reached back in range after range until they
  blended with the shadows of night.</p>

  <p>The road faded to a bridle path, and this in turn he lost among the
  windings of the valley. He was lost from even the traces of men, and yet the
  fear of men pursued him. Fear, and yet with it there was a thrill of
  happiness, for every swinging stride of the tall, wild roan carried him
  deeper into freedom, the unutterable fierce freedom of the hunted.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

  <p class="first">All life was tame compared with this sudden awakening of
  Pierre. He had killed a man. For fear of it he raced the tall roan furiously
  through the night.</p>

  <p>He had killed a man. For the joy of it he shouted a song that went ringing
  across the blank, white hills. What place was there in Red Pierre for solemn
  qualms of conscience? Had he not met the first and last test triumphantly?
  The oldest instinct in creation was satisfied in him. Now he stood ready to
  say to all the world: Behold, a man!</p>

  <p>Let it be remembered that his early years had been passed in a dull, dun
  silence, and time had slipped by him with softly padding, uneventful hours.
  Now, with the rope of restraint snapped, he rode at the world with hands,
  palm upward, asking for life, and that life which lies under the hills of the
  mountain-desert heard his question and sent a cold, sharp echo back to answer
  his lusty singing.</p>

  <p>The first answer, as he plunged on, not knowing where, and not caring, was
  when the roan reeled suddenly and flung forward to the ground. Even that
  violent stop did not unseat Red Pierre. He jerked up on the reins with a
  curse and drove in the spurs. Valiantly the horse reared his shoulders up,
  but when he strove to rise the right foreleg dangled helplessly. He had
  stepped in some hole and the bone was broken cleanly across.</p>

  <p>The rider slipped from the saddle and stood facing the roan, which pricked
  its ears forward and struggled once more to regain its feet. The effort was
  hopeless, and Pierre took the broken leg and felt the rough edges of the
  splintered bone through the skin. The animal, as if it sensed that the man
  was trying to do it some good, nosed his shoulder and whinnied softly.</p>

  <p>Pierre stepped back and drew his revolver. The bullet would do quickly
  what the cold would accomplish after lingering hours of torture, yet, facing
  those pricking ears and the trust of the eyes, he was blinded by a mist and
  could not aim. He had to place the muzzle of the gun against the roan's
  temple and pull the trigger. When he turned his back he was the only living
  thing within the white arms of the hills.</p>

  <p>Yet, when the next hill was behind him, he had already forgotten the
  second life which he put out that night, for regret is the one sorrow which
  never dodges the footsteps of the hunted. Like all his brotherhood of Cain,
  Pierre le Rouge pressed forward across the mountain-desert with his face
  turned toward the brave tomorrow. In the evening of his life, if he should
  live to that time, he would walk and talk with God.</p>

  <p>Now he had no mind save for the bright day coming.</p>

  <p>He had been riding with the wind and had scarcely noticed its violence in
  his headlong course. Now he felt it whipping sharply at his back and
  increasing with each step. Overhead the sky was clear. It seemed to give
  vision for the wind and cold to seek him out, and the moon made his following
  shadow long and black across the snow.</p>

  <p>The wind quickened rapidly to a gale that cut off the surface of the snow
  and whipped volleys of the small particles level with the surface. It cut the
  neck of Red Pierre, and the gusts struck his shoulders with staggering force
  like separate blows, twisting him a little from side to side.</p>

  <p>Coming from the direction of Morgantown, it seemed as if the vengeance for
  Diaz was following the slayer. Once he turned and laughed in the teeth of the
  wind, and shook his fist back at Morgantown and all the avenging powers of
  the law.</p>

  <p>Yet he was glad to turn away from the face of the storm and stride on
  down-wind. Even traveling with the gale grew more and more impossible. The
  snowdrifts which the wind picked up and hurried across the hills pressed
  against Pierre's back like a great, invisible hand, bowing him as if beneath
  a burden. In the hollows the labor was not so great, but when he approached a
  summit the gale screamed in his ear and struck him savagely.</p>

  <p>For all his optimism, for all his young, undrained strength, a doubt began
  to grow in the mind of Pierre le Rouge. At length, remembering how that
  weight of gold came in his pockets, he slipped his left hand into the bosom
  of his shirt and touched the icy metal of the cross. Almost at once he heard,
  or thought he heard, a faint, sweet sound of singing.</p>

  <p>The heart of Red Pierre stopped. For he knew the visions which came to men
  perishing with cold; but he grew calmer again in a moment. This touch of cold
  was nothing compared with whole months of hard exposure which he had endured
  in the northland. It had not the edge. If it were not for the wind it was
  scarcely a threat to life. Moreover, the singing sounded no more. It had been
  hardly more than a phrase of music, and it must have been a deceptive murmur
  of the wind.</p>

  <p>After all, a gale brought wilder deceptions than that. Some men had
  actually heard voices declaiming words in such a wind. He himself had heard
  them tell their stories. So he leaned forward again and gave his stanch heart
  to the task. Yet once more he stopped, for this time the singing came
  clearly, sweetly to him.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt of it now. Of course it was wildly impossible, absurd;
  but beyond all question he heard the voice of a girl come whistling down the
  wind. He could almost catch the words. For a little moment he lingered still.
  Then he turned and fought his way into the strong arms of the storm.</p>

  <p>Every now and then he paused and crouched to the snow. Usually there was
  only the shriek of the wind in his ears, but a few times the singing came to
  him and urged him on. If he had allowed the idea of failure to enter his
  mind, he must have given up the struggle, but failure was a stranger to his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>He lowered his head against the storm. Sometimes it caught under him and
  nearly lifted him from his feet. But he clung against the slope of the hill,
  sometimes gripping hard with his hands. So he worked his way to the right,
  the sound of the singing coming more and more frequently and louder and
  louder. When he was almost upon the source of the music it ceased
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>He waited a moment, but no sound came. He struggled forward a few more
  yards and pitched down exhausted, panting. Still he heard the singing no
  longer. With a falling heart he rose and resigned himself to wander on his
  original course with the wind, but as he started he placed his hand once more
  against the cross, and it was then that he saw her.</p>

  <p>For he had simply gone past her, and the yelling of the storm had cut off
  the sound of her voice. Now he saw her lying, a spot of bright color on the
  snow. He read the story at a glance. As she passed this steep-sided hill the
  loosely piled snow had slid down and carried with it the dead trunk of a
  fallen tree.</p>

  <p>Pierre came from behind and stood over her unnoticed. He saw that the
  oncoming tree, by a strange chance, had knocked down the girl and pinned her
  legs to the ground. His strength and the strength of a dozen men would not be
  sufficient to release her. This he saw at the first glance, and saw the
  bright gold of her hair against the snow. Then he dropped on his knees beside
  her.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

  <p class="first">The girl tossed up her arms in a silent greeting, and Pierre
  caught the small cold hands and saw that she was only a child of twelve or
  fourteen trapped by the wild storm sweeping over them. He crouched lower
  still, and when he did so the strength of the wind against his face decreased
  wonderfully, for the sharp angle of the hill's declivity protected them.
  Seeing him kneel there, she cried out with a little wail: "Help me&mdash;the
  tree&mdash;help me!" And, bursting into a passion of sobbing, she tugged her
  hands from his and covered her face.</p>

  <p>Pierre placed his shoulder under the trunk and lifted till the muscles of
  his back snapped and cracked. He could not budge the weight; he could not
  even send a tremor through the mass of wood. He dropped back beside her with
  a groan. He felt her eyes upon him; she had ceased her sobs, and looked
  steadily into his face.</p>

  <p>It would have been easy for him to meet that look on the morning of this
  day, but after that night's work in Morgantown he had to brace his nerve to
  withstand it.</p>

  <p>She said: "You can't budge the tree?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in a minute; I will try again."</p>

  <p>"You'll only hurt yourself for nothing. I saw how you strained at it."</p>

  <p>The greatest miracle he had ever seen was her calm. Her eyes were wide and
  sorrowful indeed, but she was almost smiling up to him.</p>

  <p>After a while he was able to say, in a faint voice: "Are you very
  cold?"</p>

  <p>She answered: "I'm not afraid. But if you stay longer with me, you may
  freeze. The snow and even the tree help to keep me almost warm; but you will
  freeze. Go for help; hurry, and if you can, send it back to me."</p>

  <p>He thought of the long miles back to Morgantown; no human being could walk
  that distance against this wind; not even a strong horse could make its way
  through the storm. If he went on with the wind, how long would it be before
  he reached a house? Before him, over range after range of hills, he saw no
  single sign of a building. If he reached some such place it would be the same
  story as the trip to Morgantown; men simply could not beat a way against that
  wind.</p>

  <p>Then a cold hand touched him, and he looked up to find her eyes grave and
  wide once more, and her lips half smiling, as if she strove to deceive
  him.</p>

  <p>"There's no chance of bringing help?"</p>

  <p>He merely stared hungrily at her, and the loveliest thing he had ever seen
  was the play of golden hair beside her cheek. Her smile went out. She
  withdrew her hand, but she repeated: "I'm not afraid. I'll simply grow numb
  and then fall asleep. But you go on and save yourself."</p>

  <p>Seeing him shake his head, she caught his hands again.</p>

  <p>"I'll be unhappy. You'll make me so unhappy if you stay. Please go."</p>

  <p>He raised the small hand and pressed it to his lips.</p>

  <p>She said: "You are crying!"</p>

  <p>"No, no!"</p>

  <p>"There! I see the tears shining on my hand. What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Pierre? I like that name. Pierre, to make me happy, will you go? Your
  face is all white and touched with a shadow of blue. It is the cold. Oh,
  won't you go?" Then she pleaded, finding him obdurate: "If you won't go for
  me, then go for your father."</p>

  <p>He raised his head with a sudden laughter, and, raising it, the wind beat
  into his face fiercely and the particles of snow whipped his skin.</p>

  <p>"Dear Pierre, then for your mother?"</p>

  <p>He bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"Not for all the people who love you and wait for you now by some warm
  fire&mdash;some cozy fire, all yellow and bright?"</p>

  <p>He took her hands and with them covered his eyes. "Listen: I have no
  father; I have no mother."</p>

  <p>"Pierre! Oh, Pierre, I'm sorry!"</p>

  <p>"And for the rest of 'em, I've killed a man. The whole world hates me; the
  whole world's hunting me."</p>

  <p>The small hands tugged away. He dared not raise his bowed head for fear of
  her eyes. And then the hands came back to him and touched his face.</p>

  <p>She was saying tremulously: "Then he deserved to be killed. There must be
  men like that&mdash;almost. And I&mdash;like you still, Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"I almost think I like you more&mdash;because you could kill a man
  &mdash;and then stay here for me."</p>

  <p>"If you were a grown-up girl, do you know what I'd say?"</p>

  <p>"Please tell me."</p>

  <p>"That I could love you."</p>

  <p>"Pierre&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"My name is Mary Brown."</p>

  <p>He repeated several times: "Mary."</p>

  <p>"And if I were a grown-up girl, do you know what I would answer?"</p>

  <p>"I don't dare guess it."</p>

  <p>"That I could love you, Pierre, if you were a grown-up man."</p>

  <p>"But I am."</p>

  <p>"Not a really one."</p>

  <p>And they both broke into laughter&mdash;laughter that died out before a
  sound of rushing and of thunder, as a mass slid swiftly past them, snow and
  mud and sand and rubble. The wind fell away from them, and when Pierre looked
  up he saw that a great mass of tumbled rock and soil loomed above them.</p>

  <p>The landslide had not touched them, by some miracle, but in a moment more
  it might shake loose again, and all that mass of ton upon ton of stone and
  loam would overwhelm them. The whole mass quaked and trembled, and the very
  hillside shuddered beneath them.</p>

  <p>She looked up and saw the coming ruin; but her cry was for him, not
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Run, Pierre&mdash;you can save yourself."</p>

  <p>With that terror threatening him from above, he rose and started to run
  down the hill. A moan of woe followed him, and he stopped and turned back,
  and fought his way through the wind until he was beside her once more.</p>

  <p>She was weeping.</p>

  <p>"Pierre&mdash;I couldn't help calling out for you; but now I'm strong
  again, and I won't have you stay. The whole mountain is shaking and falling
  toward us. Go now, Pierre, and I'll never make a sound to bring you
  back."</p>

  <p>He said: "Hush! I've something here which will keep us both safe.
  Look!"</p>

  <p>He tore from the chain the little metal cross, and held it high overhead,
  glimmering in the pallid light. She forgot her fear in wonder.</p>

  <p>"I gambled with only one coin to lose, and I came out tonight with
  hundreds and hundreds of dollars because I had the cross. It is a charm
  against all danger and against all bad fortune. It has never failed me."</p>

  <p>Over them the piled mass slid closer. The forehead of Pierre gleamed with
  sweat, but a strong purpose made him talk on. At least he could take all the
  foreboding of death from the child, and when the end came it would be swift
  and wipe them both out at one stroke. She clung to him, eager to believe.</p>

  <p>"I've closed my eyes so that I can believe."</p>

  <p>"It has never failed me. It saved me when I fought two men. One of them I
  crippled and the other died. You see, the power of the cross is as great as
  that. Do you doubt it now, Mary?"</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in it so much&mdash;really&mdash;Pierre?"</p>

  <p>Each time there was a little lowering of her voice, a little pause and
  caress in the tone as she uttered his name, and nothing in all his life had
  stirred Red Pierre so deeply with happiness and sorrow.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe, Pierre?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw the shuddering mass of the landslide creeping upon
  them inch by inch. In another moment it would loose itself with a rush and
  cover them.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said.</p>

  <p>"If you should live, and I should die&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would throw the cross away."</p>

  <p>"No, you would keep it; and every time you touched it you would think of
  me, Pierre, would you not?"</p>

  <p>"When you reach out to me like that, you take my heart between your
  hands."</p>

  <p>"And I feel grown up and sad and happy both together. After we've been
  together on such a night, how can we ever be apart again?"</p>

  <p>The mass of the landslide toppled right above them. She did not seem to
  see.</p>

  <p>"I'm so happy, Pierre. I was never so happy."</p>

  <p>And he said, with his eyes on the approaching ruin: "It was your singing
  that brought me to you. Will you sing again?"</p>

  <p>"I sang because I knew that when I sang the sound would carry farther
  through the wind than if I called for help. What shall I sing for you now,
  Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"What you sang when I came to you."</p>

  <p>And the light, sweet voice rose easily through the sweep of the wind. She
  smiled as she sang, and the smile and music were all for Pierre, he knew.
  Through the last stanza of the song the rumble of the approaching death grew
  louder, and as she ended he threw himself beside her and gathered her into
  protecting arms.</p>

  <p>She cried: "Pierre! What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I must keep you warm; the snow will eat away your strength."</p>

  <p>"No; it's more than that. Tell me, Pierre! You don't trust the power of
  the cross?"</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; I'm not afraid, Pierre."</p>

  <p>"If one life would be enough, I'd give mine a thousand times. Mary, we are
  to die."</p>

  <p>An arm slipped around his neck&mdash;a cold hand pressed against his
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The thunder broke above them with a mighty roaring.</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> have no fear."</p>

  <p>"Mary, if I had died alone I would have dropped down to hell under my
  sins; but, with your arm around me, you'll take me with you. Hold me
  close."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart, Pierre. See&mdash;I'm not afraid. It is like going to
  sleep. What wonderful dreams we'll have!"</p>

  <p>And then the black mass of the landslide swept upon them.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

  <p class="first">Down all the length of the mountain-desert and across its
  width of rocks and mountains and valleys and stern plateaus there is a
  saying: "You can tell a man by the horse he rides." For most other important
  things are apt to go by opposites, which is the usual way in which a man
  selects his wife. With dogs, for instance&mdash;a quiet man is apt to want an
  active dog, and a tractable fellow may keep the most vicious of
  wolf-dogs.</p>

  <p>But when it comes to a horse, a man's heart speaks for itself, and if he
  has sufficient knowledge he will choose a sympathetic mount. A woman loves a
  neat-stepping saddle-horse; a philosopher likes a nodding, stumble-footed nag
  which will jog all day long and care not a whit whether it goes up dale or
  down.</p>

  <p>To know the six wild riders who galloped over the white reaches of the
  mountain-desert this night, certainly their horses should be studied first
  and the men secondly, for the one explained the other.</p>

  <p>They came in a racing triangle. Even the storm at its height could not
  daunt such furious riders. At the point of the triangle thundered a mighty
  black stallion, his muzzle and his broad chest flecked with white foam, for
  he stretched his head out and champed at the bit with ears laid flat back, as
  though even that furious pace gave him no opportunity to use fully his
  strength.</p>

  <p>He was an ugly headed monster with a savagely hooked Roman nose and small,
  keen eyes, always red at the corners. A medieval baron in full panoply of
  plate armor would have chosen such a charger among ten thousand steeds, yet
  the black stallion needed all his strength to uphold the unarmored giant who
  bestrode him, a savage figure.</p>

  <p>When the broad brim of his hat flapped up against the wind the moonshine
  caught at shaggy brows, a cruelly arched nose, thin, straight lips, and a
  forward-thrusting jaw. It seemed as if nature had hewn him roughly and
  designed him for a primitive age where he could fight his way with hands and
  teeth.</p>

  <p>This was Jim Boone. To his right and a little behind him galloped a
  riderless horse, a beautiful young animal continually tossing its head and
  looking as if for guidance at the big stallion.</p>

  <p>To the left strode a handsome bay with pricking ears. A mound interfered
  with his course, and he cleared it in magnificent style that would have
  brought a cheer from the lips of any English lover of the chase.</p>

  <p>Straight in the saddle sat Dick Wilbur, and he raised his face a little to
  the wind, smiling faintly as if he rejoiced in its fine strength, as handsome
  as the horse he rode, as cleanly cut, as finely bred. The moon shone a little
  brighter on him than on any other of the six riders.</p>

  <p>Bud Mansie behind, for instance, kept his head slightly to one side and
  cursed beneath his breath at the storm and set his teeth at the wind. His
  horse, delicately formed, with long, slender legs, could not have endured
  that charge against the storm save that it constantly edged behind the
  leaders and let them break the wind. It carried less weight than any other
  mount of the six, and its strength was cunningly nursed by the rider so that
  it kept its place, and at the finish it would be as strong as any and
  swifter, perhaps, for a sudden, short effort, just as Bud Mansie might be
  numbed through all his nervous, slender body, but never too numb for swift
  and deadly action.</p>

  <p>On the opposite wing of the flying wedge galloped a dust-colored gray,
  ragged of mane and tail, and vindictive of eye, like its down-headed rider,
  who shifted his glance rapidly from side to side and watched the ground
  closely before his horse as if he were perpetually prepared for danger.</p>

  <p>He distrusted the very ground over which his mount strode. For all this he
  seemed the least formidable of all the riders. To see him pass none could
  have suspected that this was Black Morgan Gandil.</p>

  <p>Last of the crew came two men almost as large as Jim Boone himself, on
  strong steady-striding horses. They came last in this crew, but among a
  thousand other long-riders they would have ridden first, either red-faced,
  good- humored, loud-voiced Garry Patterson, or Phil Branch, stout-handed,
  blunt of jaw, who handled men as he had once hammered red iron at the
  forge.</p>

  <p>Each of them should have ridden alone in order to be properly appreciated.
  To see them together was like watching a flock of eagles every one of which
  should have been a solitary lord of the air. But after scanning that lordly
  train which followed, the more terrible seemed the rider of the great black
  horse.</p>

  <p>Yet the king was sad, and the reason for his sadness was the riderless
  horse which galloped so freely beside him. His son had ridden that horse when
  they set out, and all the way down to the railroad Handsome Hal Boone had
  kept his mount prancing and curveting and had ridden around and around tall
  Dick Wilbur, playing pranks, and had teased his father's black until the big
  stallion lashed out wildly with furious heels.</p>

  <p>It was the memory of this that kept the grave shadow of a smile on the
  father's lips for all the sternness of his eyes. He never turned his head,
  for, looking straight forward, he could conjure up the laughing vision; but
  when he glanced to the empty saddle he heard once more the last unlucky shot
  fired from the train as they raced off with their booty, and saw Hal reel in
  his saddle and pitch forward; and how he had tried to check his horse and
  turn back; and how Dick Wilbur, and Patterson, and big Phil Branch had forced
  him to go on and leave that form lying motionless on the snow.</p>

  <p>At that he groaned, and spurred the black, and so the cavalcade rushed
  faster and faster through the night.</p>

  <p>They came over a sharp ridge and veered to the side just in time, for all
  the further slope was a mass of treacherous sand and rubble and raw rocks and
  mud, where a landslide had stripped the hill to the stone.</p>

  <p>As they veered about the ruin and thundered on down to the foot of the
  hill, Jim Boone threw up his hand for a signal and brought his stallion to a
  halt on back-braced, sliding legs.</p>

  <p>For a metallic glitter had caught his eye, and then he saw, half covered
  by the pebbles and dirt, the figure of a man. He must have been struck by the
  landslide and not overwhelmed by it, but rather carried before it like a
  stick in a rush of water. At the outermost edge of the wave he lay with the
  rocks and dirt washed over him. Boone swung from the saddle and lifted Pierre
  le Rouge.</p>

  <p>The gleam of metal was the cross which his fingers still gripped. Boone
  examined it with a somewhat superstitious caution, took it from the nerveless
  fingers, and slipped it into a pocket of Pierre's shirt. A small cut on the
  boy's forehead showed where the stone struck which knocked him senseless, but
  the cut still bled&mdash;a small trickle&mdash;Pierre lived. He even stirred
  and groaned and opened his eyes, large and deeply blue.</p>

  <p>It was only an instant before they closed, but Boone had seen. He turned
  with the figure lifted easily in his arms as if Pierre had been a child
  fallen asleep by the hearth and now about to be carried off to bed.</p>

  <p>And the outlaw said: "I've lost my boy tonight. This here one was given me
  by the will of&mdash;God."</p>

  <p>Black Morgan Gandil reined his horse close by, leaned to peer down, and
  the shadow of his hat fell across the face of Pierre.</p>

  <p>"There's no good comes of savin' shipwrecked men. Leave him where you
  found him, Jim. That's my advice. Sidestep a redheaded man. That's what I
  say."</p>

  <p>The quick-stepping horse of Bud Mansie came near, and the rider wiped his
  stiff lips, and spoke from the side of his mouth, a prison habit of the line
  that moves in the lockstep: "Take it from me, Jim, there ain't any place in
  our crew for a man you've picked up without knowing him beforehand. Let him
  lay, I say." But big Dick Wilbur was already leading up the horse of Hal
  Boone, and into the saddle Jim Boone swung the inert body of Pierre. The
  argument was settled, for every man of them knew that nothing could turn
  Boone back from a thing once begun. Yet there were muttered comments that
  drew Black Morgan Gandil and Bud Mansie together.</p>

  <p>And Gandil, from the South Seas, growled with averted eyes: "This is the
  most fool stunt the chief has ever pulled."</p>

  <p>"Right, pal," answered Mansie. "You take a snake in out of the cold, and
  it bites you when it comes to in the warmth; but the chief has started, and
  there ain't nothing that'll make him stop, except maybe God or McGurk."</p>

  <p>And Black Gandil answered with his evil, sudden grin: "Maybe McGurk, but
  not God."</p>

  <p>They started on again with Garry Patterson and Dick Wilbur riding close on
  either side of Pierre, supporting his limp body. It delayed the whole gang,
  for they could not go on faster than a jog-trot. The wind, however, was
  falling off in violence. Its shrill whistling ceased, at length, and they
  went on, accompanied only by the harsh crunching of the snow
  underfoot.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

  <p class="first">Consciousness returned to Pierre slowly. Many a time his
  eyes opened, and he saw nothing, but when he did see and hear it was by vague
  glimpses.</p>

  <p>He heard the crunch of the snow underfoot; he heard the panting and
  snorting of the horses; he felt the swing and jolt of the saddle beneath him;
  he saw the grim faces of the long-riders, and he said: "The law has taken
  me."</p>

  <p>Thereafter he let his will lapse, and surrendered to the sleepy numbness
  which assailed his brain in waves. He was riding without support by this
  time, but it was an automatic effort. There was no more real life in him than
  in a dummy figure. It was not the effect of the blow. It was rather the long
  exposure and the overexertion of mind and body during the evening and night.
  He had simply collapsed beneath the strain.</p>

  <p>But an old army man has said: "Give me a soldier of eighteen or twenty. In
  a single day he may not march quite so far as a more mature man or carry
  quite so much weight. He will go to sleep each night dead to the world. But
  in the morning he awakens a new man. He is like a slate from which all the
  writing has been erased. He is ready for a new day and a new world. Thirty
  days of campaigning leaves him as strong and fresh as ever.</p>

  <p>"Thirty days of campaigning leaves the old soldier a wreck. Why? Because
  as a man grows older he loses the ability to sleep soundly. He carries the
  nervous strain of one day over to the next. Life is a serious problem to a
  man over thirty. To a man under thirty it is simply a game. For my part, give
  me men who can play at war."</p>

  <p>So it was with Pierre le Rouge. He woke with a faint heaviness of head,
  and stretched himself. There were many sore places, but nothing more. He
  looked up, and the slant winter sun cut across his face and made a patch of
  bright yellow on the wall beside him.</p>

  <p>Next he heard a faint humming, and, turning his head, saw a boy of
  fourteen or perhaps a little more, busily cleaning a rifle in a way that
  betokened the most expert knowledge of the weapon. Pierre himself knew rifles
  as a preacher knows his Bible, and as he lay half awake and half asleep he
  smiled with enjoyment to see the deft fingers move here and there, wiping
  away the oil. A green hand will spend half a day cleaning a gun, and then do
  the work imperfectly; an expert does the job efficiently in ten minutes. This
  was an expert.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly this was a true son of the mountain-desert. He wore his old
  slouch hat even in the house, and his skin was that olive brown which comes
  from many years of exposure to the wind and sun. At the same time there was a
  peculiar fineness about the boy. His feet were astonishingly small and the
  hands thin and slender for all their supple strength. And his neck was not
  bony, as it is in most youths at this gawky age, but smoothly rounded.</p>

  <p>Men grow big of bone and sparse of flesh in the mountain-desert. It was
  the more surprising to Pierre to see this young fellow with the marvelously
  delicate-cut features. By some freak of nature here was a place where the
  breed ran to high blood.</p>

  <p>The cleaning completed, the boy tossed the butt of the gun to his shoulder
  and squinted down the barrel. Then he loaded the magazine, weighted the gun
  deftly at the balance, and dropped the rifle across his knees.</p>

  <p>"Morning," said Pierre le Rouge cheerily, and swung off the bunk to the
  floor. "How old's the gun?"</p>

  <p>The boy, without the slightest show of excitement, snapped the butt to his
  shoulder and drew a bead on Pierre's breast.</p>

  <p>"Sit down before you get all heated up," said a musical voice. "There's
  nobody waiting for you on horseback."</p>

  <p>And Pierre sat down, partly because Western men never argue a point when
  that little black hole is staring them in the face, partly because he
  remembered with a rush that the last time he had fully possessed his
  consciousness he had been lying in the snow with the cross gripped hard and
  the toppling mass of the landslide above him. All that had happened between
  was blotted from his memory. He fumbled at his throat. The cross was not
  there. He touched his pockets. "Ease your hands away from your hip," said the
  cold voice of the boy, who had dropped his gun to the ready with a
  significant finger curled around the trigger, "or I'll drill you clean."</p>

  <p>Pierre obediently raised his hands to the level of his shoulders. The boy
  sneered.</p>

  <p>"This isn't a hold-up," he explained. "Put 'em down again, but watch
  yourself."</p>

  <p>The sneer varied to a contemptuous smile.</p>

  <p>"I guess you're tame, all right."</p>

  <p>"Point that gun another way, will you, son?"</p>

  <p>The boy flushed.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me son."</p>

  <p>"Is this a lockup&mdash;a jail?"</p>

  <p>"This?"</p>

  <p>"What is it, then? The last I remember I was lying in the snow with
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish to God you'd been let there," said the boy bitterly.</p>

  <p>But Pierre, overwhelmed with the endeavor to recollect, rushed on with his
  questions and paid no heed to the tone.</p>

  <p>"I had a cross in my hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The scorn of the boy grew to mighty proportions.</p>

  <p>"It's there in the breast-pocket of your shirt."</p>

  <p>Pierre drew out the little cross, and the touch of it against his palm
  restored whatever of his strength was lacking. Very carefully he attached it
  to the chain about his throat. Then he looked up to the contempt of the boy,
  and as he did so another memory burst on him and brought him to his feet. The
  gun went to the boy's shoulders at the same time.</p>

  <p>"When I was found&mdash;was anyone else with me?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Must have been buried in the landslide. Half a hill caved in, and the
  dirt rolled you down to the bottom. Plain luck, that's all, that kept you
  from going out."</p>

  <p>"Luck?" said Pierre and he laid his hand against his breast where he could
  feel the outline of the cross. "Yes, I suppose it was luck. And she
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sat down slowly and buried his face in his hands. A new tone came in
  the voice of the boy as he asked: "Was a woman with you?" But Pierre heard
  only the tone and not the words. His face was gray when he looked up again,
  and his voice hard.</p>

  <p>"Tell me as briefly as you can how I come here, and who picked me up."</p>

  <p>"My father and his men. They passed you lying on the snow. They brought
  you home."</p>

  <p>"Who is your father?"</p>

  <p>The boy stiffened and his color rose.</p>

  <p>"My father is Jim Boone."</p>

  <p>Instinctively, while he stared, the right hand of Pierre le Rouge crept
  toward his hip.</p>

  <p>"Keep your hand steady," said the boy. "I got a nervous trigger-finger.
  Yeh, dad is pretty well known."</p>

  <p>"You're his son?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Jack Boone."</p>

  <p>"But I've heard&mdash;tell me, why am I under guard?"</p>

  <p>Jack was instantly aflame with the old anger.</p>

  <p>"Not because I want you here."</p>

  <p>"Who does?"</p>

  <p>"Dad."</p>

  <p>"Put away your pop-gun and talk sense. I won't try to get away until Jim
  Boone comes. I only fight men."</p>

  <p>Even the anger and grief of the boy could not keep him from smiling.</p>

  <p>"Just the same I'll keep the shooting-iron handy. Sit still. A gun don't
  keep me from talking sense, does it? You're here to take Hal's place. Hal!"
  The little wail told a thousand things, and Pierre, shocked out of the
  thought of his own troubles, waited.</p>

  <p>"My brother, Hal; he's dead; he died last night, and on the way back dad
  found you and brought you to take Hal's place. <i>Hal's</i> place!"</p>

  <p>The accent showed how impossible it was that Hal's place could be taken by
  any mortal man.</p>

  <p>"I got orders to keep you here, but if I was to do what I'd like to do,
  I'd give you the best horse on the place and tell you to clear out. That's
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Then do it."</p>

  <p>"And face dad afterward?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him I overpowered you. That would be easy; you a slip of a boy, and
  me a man."</p>

  <p>"Stranger, it goes to show you may have heard of Jim Boone, but you don't
  anyways know him. When he orders a thing done he wants it done, and he don't
  care how, and he don't ask questions why. He just raises hell."</p>

  <p>"He really expects to keep me here?"</p>

  <p>"Expects? He will."</p>

  <p>"Going to tie me up?" asked Pierre ironically.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," answered Jack, overlooking the irony. "Maybe he'll just put you
  on my shoulders to guard."</p>

  <p>He moved the gun significantly.</p>

  <p>"And I can do it."</p>

  <p>"Of course. But he would have to let me go sometime."</p>

  <p>"Not till you'd promised to stick by him. I told him that myself, but he
  said that you're young and that he'd teach you to like this life whether you
  wanted to or not. Me speaking personally, I agree with Black Gandil: This is
  the worst fool thing that dad has ever done. What do we want with you&mdash;
  in Hal's place!"</p>

  <p>"But I've got a thing to do right away&mdash;today; it can't wait."</p>

  <p>"Give dad your word to come back and he'll let you go. He says you're the
  kind that will keep your word. You see, he found you with a cross in your
  hand."</p>

  <p>And Jack's lips curled again.</p>

  <p>It was all absurd, too impossible to be real. The only real things were
  the body of yellow-haired Mary Brown, under the tumbled rocks and dirt of the
  landslide, and the body of Martin Ryder waiting to be placed in that corner
  plot where the grass grew quicker than all other grass in the spring of the
  year.</p>

  <p>However, having fallen among madmen, he must use cunning to get away
  before the outlaw and his men came back from wherever they had gone.
  Otherwise there would be more bloodshed, more play of guns and hum of
  lead.</p>

  <p>"Tell me of Hal," he said, and dropped his elbows on his knees as if he
  accepted his fate.</p>

  <p>"Don't know you well enough to talk of Hal."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>The boy made a little gesture of apology.</p>

  <p>"I guess that was a mean thing to say. Sure I'll tell you about Hal
  &mdash;if I can."</p>

  <p>"Tell me anything you can," said Pierre gently, "because I've got to try
  to be like him, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"You could try till rattlers got tame, but it'd take ten like you to make
  one like Hal. He was dad's own son&mdash;he was my brother."</p>

  <p>The sob came openly now, and the tears were a mist in the boy's eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Pierre? I suppose I got to learn it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so." And he edged farther forward so that he was sitting only
  on the edge of the bunk.</p>

  <p>"Please do." And he gathered his feet under him, ready for a spring
  forward and a grip at the boy's threatening rifle.</p>

  <p>Jack had canted his head a little to one side. "Did you ever see a horse
  that was gentle and yet had never been ridden, or his spirit broke, Pierre
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Pierre made his leap swift as some bobcat of the northern woods; his
  hand whipped out as lightning fast as the striking paw of the lynx, and the
  gun was jerked from the hands of Jack. Not before the boy clutched at it with
  a cry of horror, but the force of the pull sent him lurching to the floor and
  broke his grip.</p>

  <p>He was up in an instant, however, and a knife of ugly length glittered in
  his hand as he sprang at Pierre.</p>

  <p>Pierre tossed aside the rifle and met the attack barehanded. He caught the
  knife-bearing hand at the wrist and under his grip the hand loosened its hold
  and the steel tinkled on the floor. His other arm caught the body of Jack in
  a mighty vise.</p>

  <p>There was a brief and futile struggle, and a hissing of breath in the
  silence till the hat tumbled from the head of Jack and down over the
  shoulders streamed a torrent of silken black hair.</p>

  <p>Pierre stepped back. This was the meaning, then, of the strangely small
  feet and hands and the low music of the voice. It was the body of a girl that
  he had held.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

  <p class="first">It was not fear nor shame that made the eyes of Jacqueline
  so wide as she stared past Pierre toward the door. He glanced across his
  shoulder, and blocking the entrance to the room, literally filling the
  doorway, was the bulk of Jim Boone.</p>

  <p>"Seems as if I was sort of steppin' in on a little family party," he said.
  "I'm sure glad you two got acquainted so quick. Jack, how did you and
  &mdash;What the hell's your name, lad?"</p>

  <p>"He tricked me, dad, or he would never have got the gun away from me.
  This&mdash;this Pierre&mdash;this beast&mdash;he got me to talk of Hal. Then
  he stole&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The point," said Jim Boone coldly, "is that he <i>got</i> the gun. Run
  along, Jack. You ain't so growed up as I was thinkin'. Or hold on&mdash;maybe
  you're <i>more</i> grown up. Which is it? Are you turnin' into a woman,
  Jack?"</p>

  <p>She whirled on Pierre in a white fury.</p>

  <p>"You see? You see what you've done? He'll never trust me again&mdash;
  never! Pierre, I hate you. I'll always hate you. And if Hal were here
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>A storm of sobs and tears cut her short, and she disappeared through the
  door. Boone and Pierre stood regarding each other critically.</p>

  <p>Pierre spoke first: "You're not as big as I expected."</p>

  <p>"I'm plenty big; but you're older than I thought."</p>

  <p>"Too old for what you want of me. The girl told me what that was."</p>

  <p>"Not too old to be made what I want."</p>

  <p>And his hands passed through a significant gesture of molding the empty
  air. The boy met his eye dauntlessly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "that I've a pretty small chance of getting
  away."</p>

  <p>"Just about none, Pierre. Come here."</p>

  <p>Pierre stepped closer and looked down the hall into another room. There,
  about a table, sat the five grimmest riders of the mountain-desert that he
  had ever seen. They were such men as one could judge at a glance, and Pierre
  made that instinctive motion for his six-gun. "The girl," Jim Boone was
  saying, "kept you pretty busy tryin' to make a break, and if she could do
  anything maybe you'd have a pile of trouble with one of them guardin' you.
  But if I'd had a good look at you, lad, I'd never have let Jack take the job
  of guardin' you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," answered Pierre dryly.</p>

  <p>"You got reason; I can see that. Here's the point, Pierre. I know young
  men because I can remember pretty close what I was at your age. I wasn't any
  ladies' lap dog, at that, but time and older men molded me the way I'm going
  to mold you. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Pierre was nerved for many things, but the last word made him stir. It
  roused in him a red-tinged desire to get through the forest of black beard at
  the throat of Boone and dim the glitter of those keen eyes. It brought him
  also another thought.</p>

  <p>Two great tasks lay before him: the burial of his father and the avenging
  of him on McGurk. As to the one, he knew it would be childish madness for him
  to attempt to bury his father in Morgantown with only his single hand to hold
  back the powers of the law or the friends of the notorious Diaz and crippled
  Hurley.</p>

  <p>And for the other, it was even more vain to imagine that through his own
  unaided power he could strike down a figure of such almost legendary terror
  as McGurk. The bondage of the gang might be a terrible thing through the
  future, but the present need blinded him to what might come.</p>

  <p>He said: "Suppose I stop raising questions or making a fight, but give you
  my hand and call myself a member&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of the family? Exactly. If you did that I'd know it was because you were
  wantin' something, Pierre, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Two things."</p>

  <p>"Lad, I like this way of talk. One&mdash;two&mdash;you hit quick like a
  two-gun man. Well, I'm used to paying high for what I get. What's up?" "The
  first&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait. Can I help you out by myself, or do you need the gang?"</p>

  <p>"The gang."</p>

  <p>"Then come, and I'll put it up to them. You first."</p>

  <p>It was equally courtesy and caution, and Pierre smiled faintly as he went
  first through the door. He stood in a moment under the eyes of five silent
  men.</p>

  <p>The booming voice of Jim Boone pronounced: "This is Pierre. He'll be one
  of us if he can get the gang to do two things. I ask you, will you hear him
  for me, and then pass on whether or not you try his game?"</p>

  <p>They nodded. There were no greetings to acknowledge the introduction. They
  waited, eyeing the youth with distrust.</p>

  <p>Pierre eyed them in turn, and then he spoke directly to big Dick
  Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"Here's the first: I want to bury a man in Morgantown and I need help to
  do it."</p>

  <p>Black Gandil snarled: "You heard me, boys; blood to start with. Who's the
  man you want us to put out?"</p>

  <p>"He's dead&mdash;my father."</p>

  <p>They came up straight in their chairs like trained actors rising to a
  stage crisis. The snarl straightened on the lips of Black Morgan Gandil.</p>

  <p>"He's lying in his house a few miles out of Morgantown. As he died he told
  me that he wanted to be buried in a corner plot in the Morgantown graveyard.
  He'd seen the place and counted it for his a good many years because he said
  the grass grew quicker there than any other place, after the snow went."</p>

  <p>"A damned good reason," said Garry Patterson. As the idea stuck more
  deeply into his imagination he smashed his fist down on the table so that the
  crockery on it danced. "A damned good reason, say I!"</p>

  <p>"Who's your father?" asked Dick Wilbur, who eyed Pierre more critically
  but with less enmity than the rest.</p>

  <p>"Martin Ryder."</p>

  <p>"A ringer!" cried Bud Mansie, and he leaned forward alertly. "You remember
  what I said, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up. Pierre, talk soft and talk quick. We all know Mart Ryder had
  only two sons and you're not either of them."</p>

  <p>The Northerner grew stiff and as his face grew pale the red mark where the
  stone had struck his forehead stood out like a danger signal.</p>

  <p>He said slowly: "I'm his son, but not by the mother of those two."</p>

  <p>"Was he married twice?"</p>

  <p>Pierre was paler still, and there was an uneasy twitching of his right
  hand which every man understood.</p>

  <p>He barely whispered. "No; damn you!"</p>

  <p>But Black Gandil loved evil.</p>

  <p>He said, with a marvelously unpleasant smile: "Then she was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The voice of Dick Wilbur cut in like the snapping of a whip: "Shut up,
  Gandil, you devil!"</p>

  <p>There were times when not even Boone would cross Wilbur, and this was one
  of them.</p>

  <p>Pierre went on: "The reason I can't go to Morgan town is that I'm not very
  well liked by some of the men there."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"When my father died there was no money to pay for his burial. I had only
  a half-dollar piece. I went to the town and gambled and won a great deal. But
  before I came out I got mixed up with a man called Hurley, a professional
  gambler."</p>

  <p>"And Diaz?" queried a chorus.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Hurley was hurt in the wrist and Diaz died. I think I'm wanted in
  Morgantown."</p>

  <p>Out of a little silence came the voice of Black Gandil: "Dick, I'm
  thankin' you now for cuttin' me so short a minute ago."</p>

  <p>Phil Branch had not spoken, as usual, but now he repeated, with rapt, far-
  off eyes: "'Hurley was hurt in the wrist and Diaz died?' Hurley and Diaz! I
  played with Hurley, a couple of times."</p>

  <p>"Speakin' personal," said Garry Patterson, his red verging toward purple
  in excitement, "which I'm ready to go with you down to Morgantown and bury
  your father."</p>

  <p>"And do it shipshape," added Black Gandil.</p>

  <p>"With all the trimmings," said Bud Mansie, "with all Morgantown joinin'
  the mournin' voluntarily under cover of our six-guns."</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Boone. "What's the second request?"</p>

  <p>"That can wait."</p>

  <p>"It's a bigger job than this one?"</p>

  <p>"Lots bigger."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime?"</p>

  <p>"I'm your man."</p>

  <p>They shook hands. Even Black Gandil rose to take his share in the
  ceremony&mdash;all save Bud Mansie, who had glanced out the window a moment
  before and then silently left the room. A bottle of whisky was produced and
  glasses filled all round. Jim Boone brought in the seventh chair and placed
  it at the table. They raised their glasses.</p>

  <p>"To the empty chair," said Boone.</p>

  <p>They drank, and for the first time in his life, the liquid fire went down
  the throat of Pierre. He set down his glass, coughing, and the others laughed
  good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"Started down the wrong way?" asked Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"It's beastly stuff; first I ever drank."</p>

  <p>A roar of laughter answered him.</p>

  <p>"Still I got an idea," broke in Jim Boone, "that he's worthy of takin' the
  seventh chair. Draw it up lad."</p>

  <p>Vaguely it reminded Pierre of a scene in some old play with himself in the
  role of the hero signing away his soul to the devil, but an interruption kept
  him from taking the chair. There was a racket at the door&mdash;a half-
  sobbing, half-scolding voice, and the laughter of a man; then Bud Mansie
  appeared carrying Jack in spite of her struggles. He placed her on the floor
  and held her hands to protect himself from her fury.</p>

  <p>"I glimpsed her through the window," he explained. "She was lining out for
  the stable and then a minute later I saw her swing a saddle onto&mdash; what
  horse d'you think?"</p>

  <p>"Out with it."</p>

  <p>"Jim's big Thunder. Yep, she stuck the saddle on big black Thunder and had
  a rifle in the holster. I saw there was hell brewing somewhere, so I went out
  and nabbed her."</p>

  <p>"Jack!" called Jim Boone. "What were you started for?"</p>

  <p>Bud Mansie released her arms and she stood with them stiffening at her
  sides and her fists clenched.</p>

  <p>"Hal&mdash;he died, and there was nothing but talk about him&mdash;
  nothing done. You got a live man in Hal's place."</p>

  <p>She pointed an accusing finger at Pierre.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he takes his place for you, but he's not my brother&mdash;I hate
  him. I went out to get another man to make up for Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"A dead man. I shoot straight enough for that."</p>

  <p>A very solemn silence spread through the room; for every man was watching
  in the eyes of the father and daughter the same shining black devil of
  wrath.</p>

  <p>"Jack, get into your room and don't move out of it till I tell you to.
  D'you hear?"</p>

  <p>She turned on her heel like a soldier and marched from the room.</p>

  <p>"Jack."</p>

  <p>She stopped in the door but would not turn back. "Jack, don't you love
  your old dad anymore?" She whirled and ran to him with outstretched arms and
  clung to him, sobbing. "Oh, dad," she groaned. "You've broken my
  heart."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

  <p class="first">The annals of the mountain-desert have never been written
  and can never be written. They are merely a vast mass of fact and tradition
  and imagining which floats from tongue to tongue from the Rockies to the
  Sierra Nevadas. A man may be a fact all his life and die only a local
  celebrity. Then again, he may strike sparks from that imagination which runs
  riot by camp-fires and at the bars of the crossroads saloons.</p>

  <p>In that case he becomes immortal. It is not that lies are told about him
  or impossible feats ascribed to him, but every detail about him is seized
  upon and passed on with a most scrupulous and loving care.</p>

  <p>In due time he will become a tradition. That is, he will be known
  familiarly at widely separated parts of the range, places which he has never
  visited. It has happened to a few of the famous characters of the mountain-
  desert that they became traditions before their deaths. It happened to
  McGurk, of course. It also happened to Red Pierre.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, the tradition of Red Pierre did not begin with his ride from
  the school of Father Victor to Morgantown, distant many days of difficult and
  dangerous travel. Neither did tradition seize on the gunfight that crippled
  Hurley and "put out" wizard Diaz. These things were unquestionably known to
  many, but they did not strike the popular imagination. What set men first on
  fire was the way Pierre le Rouge buried his father "at the point of the gun"
  in Morgantown.</p>

  <p>That day Boone's men galloped out of the higher mountains down the trail
  toward Morgantown. They stole a wagon out of a ranch stable on the way and
  tied two lariats to the tongue. So they towed it, bounding and rattling, over
  the rough trail to the house where Martin Ryder lay dead.</p>

  <p>His body was placed in state in the body of the wagon, pillowed with
  everything in the line of cloth which the house could furnish. Thus equipped
  they went on at a more moderate pace toward Morgantown.</p>

  <p>What followed it is useless to repeat here. Tradition rehearsed every
  detail of that day's work, and the purpose of this narrative is only to give
  the details of some of the events which tradition does not know, at least in
  their entirety.</p>

  <p>They started at one end of Morgantown's street. Pierre guarded the wagon
  in the center of the street and kept the people under cover of his rifle. The
  rest of Boone's men cleaned out the houses as they went and sent the
  occupants piling out to swell the crowd.</p>

  <p>And so they rolled the crowd out of town and to the cemetery, where
  "volunteers" dug the grave of Martin Ryder wide and deep, and Pierre paid for
  the corner plot three times over in gold.</p>

  <p>Then a coffin&mdash;improvised hastily for the occasion out of a
  packing-box&mdash;was lowered reverently, also by "volunteer" mourners, and
  before the first sod fell on the dead. Pierre raised over his head the
  crucifix of Father Victor that brought good luck, and intoned a service in
  the purest Ciceronian Latin, surely, that ever regaled the ears of
  Morgantown's elect.</p>

  <p>The moment he raised that cross the bull throat of Jim Boone bellowed a
  command, the poised guns of the gang enforced it, and all the crowd dropped
  to their knees, leaving the six outlaws scattered about the edges of the mob
  like sheep dogs around a folding flock, while in the center stood Pierre with
  white, upturned face and the raised cross.</p>

  <p>So Martin Ryder was buried with "trimmings," and the gang rode back,
  laughing and shouting, through the town and up into the safety of the
  mountains. Election day was fast approaching and therefore the rival
  candidates for sheriff hastily organized posses and made the usual futile
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>In fact, before the pursuit was well under way, Boone and his men sat at
  their supper table in the cabin. The seventh chair was filled; all were
  present except Jack, who sulked in her room. Pierre went to her door and
  knocked. He carried under his arm a package which he had secured in the
  General Merchandise Store of Morgantown.</p>

  <p>"We're all waiting for you at the table," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Just keep on waiting," said the husky voice of Jacqueline.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you a present."</p>

  <p>"I hate your presents!"</p>

  <p>"It's a thing you've wanted for a long time, Jacqueline."</p>

  <p>Only a stubborn silence.</p>

  <p>"I'm putting your door a little ajar."</p>

  <p>"If you dare to come in I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I'm leaving the package right here at the entrance. I'm so sorry,
  Jacqueline, that you hate me."</p>

  <p>And then he walked off down the hall&mdash;cunning Pierre&mdash; before
  she could send her answer like an arrow after him. At the table he arranged
  an eighth plate and drew up a chair before it. "If that's for Jack," remarked
  Dick Wilbur, "you're wasting your time. I know her and I know her type.
  She'll never come out to the table tonight&mdash;nor tomorrow, either. I
  know!"</p>

  <p>In fact, he knew a good deal too much about girls and women also, did
  Wilbur, and that was why he rode the long trails of the mountain-desert with
  Boone and his men. Far south and east in the Bahamas a great mansion stood
  vacant because he was gone, and the dust lay thick on the carpets and
  powdered the curtains and tapestries with a common gray.</p>

  <p>He had built it and furnished it for a woman he loved, and afterward for
  her sake he had killed a man and fled from a posse and escaped in the
  steerage of a west-bound ship. Still the law followed him, and he kept on
  west and west until he reached the mountain-desert, which thinks nothing of
  swallowing men and their reputations.</p>

  <p>There he was safe, but someday he would see some woman smile, catch the
  glimmer of some eye, and throw safety away to ride after her.</p>

  <p>It was a weakness, but what made a tragic figure of handsome Dick Wilbur
  was that he knew his weakness and sat still and let fate walk up and overtake
  him.</p>

  <p>Yet Pierre le Rouge answered this man of sorrowful wisdom: "In my part of
  the country men say: 'If you would speak of women let money talk for
  you.'"</p>

  <p>And he placed a gold piece on the table.</p>

  <p>"She will come out to the supper table."</p>

  <p>"She will not," smiled Wilbur, and covered the coin. "Will you take
  odds?"</p>

  <p>"No charity. Who else will bet?"</p>

  <p>"I," said Jim Boone instantly. "You figure her for an ordinary sulky
  kid."</p>

  <p>Pierre smiled upon him.</p>

  <p>"There's a cut in my shirt where her knife passed through; and that's the
  reason that I'll bet on her now." The whole table covered his coin, with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"We've kept one part of your bargain, Pierre. We've seen your father
  buried in the corner plot. Now, what's the second part?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know you well enough to ask you that," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>They plied him with suggestions.</p>

  <p>"To rob the Berwin Bank?"</p>

  <p>"Stick up a train?"</p>

  <p>"No. That's nothing."</p>

  <p>"Round up the sheriffs from here to the end of the mountains?"</p>

  <p>"Too easy."</p>

  <p>"Roll all those together," said Pierre, "and you'll begin to get an idea
  of what I'll ask."</p>

  <p>Then a low voice called from the black throat of the hall: "Pierre!"</p>

  <p>The others were silent, but Pierre winked at them, and made great flourish
  with knife and fork against his plate as if to cover the sound of
  Jacqueline's voice.</p>

  <p>"Pierre!" she called again. "I've come to thank you."</p>

  <p>He jumped up and turned toward the hall.</p>

  <p>"Do you like it?"</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder!"</p>

  <p>"Then we're friends?"</p>

  <p>"If you want to be."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing I want more. Then you'll come out and have supper with
  us, Jack?"</p>

  <p>There was a little pause, and then Jim Boone struck his fist on the table
  and cursed, for she stepped from the darkness into the flaring light of the
  room.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

  <p class="first">She wore a cartridge-belt slung jauntily across her hips and
  from it hung a holster of stiff new leather with the top flap open to show
  the butt of a man- sized forty-five caliber six-shooter&mdash;her first gun.
  Not a man of the gang but had loaned her his guns time and again, but they
  had never dreamed of giving her a weapon of her own.</p>

  <p>So they stared at her agape, where she stood with her head back, one hand
  resting on her hip, one hovering about the butt of the gun, as if she
  challenged them to question her right to be called "man."</p>

  <p>It was as if she abandoned all claims to femininity with that single step;
  the gun at her side made her seem inches taller and years older. She was no
  longer a child, but a long-rider who could shoot with the best.</p>

  <p>One glance she cast about the room to drink in the amazement of the gang,
  and then her father broke in rather hoarsely: "Sit down, girl. Sit down and
  be one of us. One of us you are by your own choice from this day on. You're
  neither man nor woman, but a long-rider with every man's hand against you.
  You've done with any hope of a home or of friends. You're one of us. Poor
  Jack &mdash;my girl!"</p>

  <p>"Poor?" she returned. "Not while I can make a quick draw and shoot
  straight."</p>

  <p>And then she swept the circle of eyes, daring them to take her boast
  lightly, but they knew her too well, and were all solemnly silent. At this
  she relented somewhat, and went directly to Pierre, flushing from throat to
  hair. She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Will you shake and call it square?"</p>

  <p>"I sure will," nodded Pierre.</p>

  <p>"And we're pals&mdash;you and me, like the rest of 'em?"</p>

  <p>"We are."</p>

  <p>She took the place beside him.</p>

  <p>As the whisky went round after round the two seemed shut away from the
  others; they were younger, less marked by life; they listened while the
  others talked, and now and then exchanged glances of interest or
  aversion.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said after a time, "I've heard this story before."</p>

  <p>It was Phil Branch, square-built and square of jaw, who was talking.</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing I can handle better than a gun, and that's a
  sledgehammer. A gun is all right in its way, but for work in a crowd, well,
  give me a hammer and I'll show you a way out."</p>

  <p>Bud Mansie grinned: "Leave me my pair of sixes and you can have all the
  hammers between here and Central Park in a crowd. There's nothing makes a
  crowd remember its heels like a pair of barking sixes."</p>

  <p>"Ah, ah!" growled Branch. "But when they've heard bone crunch under the
  hammer there's nothing will hold them."</p>

  <p>"I'd have to see that."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you will, Bud, maybe you will. It was the hammer that started me
  for the trail west. I had a big Scotchman in the factory who couldn't learn
  how to weld. I'd taught him day after day and cursed him and damn near prayed
  for him. But he somehow wouldn't learn&mdash;the swine&mdash;ah, ah!"</p>

  <p>He grew vindictively black at the memory.</p>

  <p>"Every night he wiped out what I'd taught him during the day and the
  eraser he used was booze. So one fine day I dropped the hammer after watchin'
  him make a botch on a big bar, and cussed him up one leg and down the other.
  The Scotchman had a hangover from the night before and he made a pass at me.
  It was too much for me just then, for the day was hot and the forge fire had
  been spitting cinders in my face all morning. So I took him by the
  throat."</p>

  <p>He reached out and closed his taut fingers slowly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean nothin' by it, but after a man has been moldin' iron, flesh
  is pretty weak stuff. When I let go of Scotchy he dropped on the floor, and
  while I stood starin' down at him somebody seen what had happened and spread
  the word.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't none too popular, bein' not much on talk, so the boys got
  together and pretty soon they come pilin' through the door at me, packin'
  everything from hatchets to crowbars.</p>

  <p>"Lads, I was sorry about Scotchy, but after I glimpsed that gang comin' I
  wasn't sorry for nothing. I felt like singin', though there wasn't no song
  that could say just what I meant. But I grabbed up the big fourteen-pound
  hammer and met 'em halfway.</p>

  <p>"The first swing of the hammer it met something hard, but not as hard as
  iron. The thing crunched with a sound like an egg under a man's heel. And
  when that crowd heard it they looked sick. God, how sick they looked! They
  didn't wait for no second swing, but they beat it hard and fast through the
  door with me after 'em. They scattered, but I kept right on and didn't never
  really stop till I reached the mountain-desert and you, Jim."</p>

  <p>"Which is a good yarn," said Bud Mansie, "but I can tell you one that'll
  cap it. It was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short, staring up at the door. Outside, the wind had kept up a
  perpetual roaring, and no one noticed the noise of the opening door. Bud
  Mansie, facing that door, however, turned a queer yellow and sat with his
  lips parted on the last word. He was not pretty to see. The others turned
  their heads, and there followed the strangest panic which Pierre had ever
  seen.</p>

  <p>Jim Boone jerked his hand back to his hip, but stayed the motion, half
  completed, and swung his hands stiffly above his head. Garry Patterson sat
  with his eyes blinked shut, pale, waiting for death to come. Dick Wilbur
  rose, tall and stiff, and stood with his hands gripped at his sides, and
  Black Morgan Gandil clutched at the table before him and his eyes wandered
  swiftly about the room, seeking a place for escape.</p>

  <p>There was only one sound, and that was a whispering moan of terror from
  Jacqueline. Only Pierre made no move, yet he felt as he had when the black
  mass of the landslide loomed above him.</p>

  <p>What he saw in the door was a man of medium size and almost slender build.
  In spite of the patch of gray hair at either temple he was only somewhere
  between twenty-five and thirty. But to see him was to forget all details
  except the strangest face which Pierre had ever seen or would ever look upon
  in all his career.</p>

  <p>It was pale, with a pallor strange to the ranges; even the lips seemed
  bloodless, and they curved with a suggestion of a smile that was a nervous
  habit rather than any sign of mirth. The nerves of the left eye were also
  affected, and the lid dropped and fluttered almost shut, so that he had to
  carry his head far back in order to see plainly. There was such pride and
  scorn in the man that his name came up to the lips of Pierre: "McGurk."</p>

  <p>A surprisingly gentle voice said: "Jim, I'm sorry to drop in on you this
  way, but I've had some unpleasant news."</p>

  <p>His words dispelled part of the charm. The hands of big Boone lowered; the
  others assumed more natural positions, but each, it seemed to Pierre, took
  particular and almost ostentatious care that their right hands should be
  always far from the holsters of their guns.</p>

  <p>The stranger went on: "Martin Ryder is finished, as I suppose you know. He
  left a spawn of two mongrels behind him. I haven't bothered with them, but
  I'm a little more interested in another son that has cropped up. He's sitting
  over there in your family party and his name is Pierre. In his own country
  they call him Pierre le Rouge, which means Red Pierre, in our talk.</p>

  <p>"You know I've never crossed you in anything before, Jim. Have I?"</p>

  <p>Boone moistened his white lips and answered: "Never," huskily, as if it
  were a great muscular effort for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"This time I have to break the custom. Boone, this fellow Pierre has to
  leave the country. Will you see that he goes?"</p>

  <p>The lips of Boone moved and made no sound.</p>

  <p>He said at length: "McGurk, I'd rather cross the devil than cross you.
  There's no shame in admitting that. But I've lost my boy, Hal."</p>

  <p>"Too bad, Jim. I knew Hal; at a distance, of course."</p>

  <p>"And Pierre is filling Hal's place in the family."</p>

  <p>"Is that your answer?"</p>

  <p>"McGurk, are you going to pin me down in this?"</p>

  <p>And here Jack whirled and cried: "Dad, you won't let Pierre go!"</p>

  <p>"You see?" pleaded Boone.</p>

  <p>It was uncanny and horrible to see the giant so unnerved before this
  stranger, but that part of it did not come to Pierre until later. Now he felt
  a peculiar emptiness of stomach and a certain jumping chill that traveled up
  and down his spine. Moreover, he could not move his eyes from the face of
  McGurk, and he knew at length that this was fear&mdash;the first real fear
  that he had ever known.</p>

  <p>Shame made him hot, but fear made him cold again. He knew that if he rose
  his knees would buckle under him; that if he drew out his revolver it would
  slip from his palsied fingers. For the fear of death is a mighty fear, but it
  is nothing compared with the fear of man.</p>

  <p>"I've asked you a question," said McGurk. "What's your answer?"</p>

  <p>There was a quiver in the black forest of Boone's beard, and if Pierre was
  cold before, he was sick at heart to see the big man cringe before
  McGurk.</p>

  <p>He stammered: "Give me time."</p>

  <p>"Good," said McGurk. "I'm afraid I know what your answer would be now, but
  if you take a couple of days you will think things over and come to a
  reasonable conclusion. I will be at Gaffney's place about fifteen miles from
  here. You know it? Send your answer there. In the meantime"&mdash;he stepped
  forward to the table and poured a small drink of whisky into a glass and
  raised it high&mdash;"here's to the long health and happiness of us all.
  Drink!"</p>

  <p>There was a hasty pouring of liquor.</p>

  <p>"And you also!"</p>

  <p>Pierre jumped as if he had been struck, and obeyed the order hastily.</p>

  <p>"So," said the master, pleasant again, and Pierre wiped his forehead
  furtively and stared up with fascinated eyes. "An unwilling pledge is better
  than none at all. To you, gentlemen, much happiness; to you, Pierre le Rouge,
  bon voyage."</p>

  <p>They drank; the master placed his glass on the table again, smiled upon
  them, and was gone through the door. He turned his back in leaving. There was
  no fitter way in which he could have expressed his contempt.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

  <p class="first">The mirth died and in its place came a long silence. Jim
  Boone stared upon Pierre with miserable eyes, and then rose and left the
  room. The others one by one followed his example. Dick Wilbur in passing
  dropped his hand on Pierre's shoulder. Jacqueline was silent.</p>

  <p>As he sat there minute after minute and then hour after hour of the long
  night Pierre saw the meaning of it. If they sent word that they would not
  give up Pierre it was war, and war with McGurk had only one ending. If they
  sent word that Pierre was surrendered the shame would never leave Boone and
  his men.</p>

  <p>Whatever they did there was ruin for them in the end. All this Pierre
  conned slowly in his mind, until he was cold. Then he looked up and saw that
  the lamp had burned out and that the wood in the fireplace was consumed to a
  few red embers.</p>

  <p>He replenished the fire, and when the yellow flames began to mount he made
  his resolution and walked slowly up and down the floor with it. For he knew
  that he must go to meet McGurk.</p>

  <p>The very thought of the man sent the old chill through his blood, yet he
  must go and face him and end the thing.</p>

  <p>It came over him with a pang that he was very young; that life was barely
  a taste in his mouth, whether bitter or sweet he could not tell. He picked a
  flaming stick from the fire and went before a little round mirror on the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Back at him stared the face of a boy. He had seen so much of the grim six
  in the last day that the contrast startled him. They were men, hardened to
  life and filled with knowledge of it. They were books written full. But he?
  He was a blank page with a scribbled word here and there. Nevertheless, he
  was chosen and he must go.</p>

  <p>Having reached that decision he closed his mind on what would happen.
  There was a vague fear that when he faced McGurk he would be frozen with
  fear; that his spirit would be broken and he would become a thing too
  despicable for a man to kill.</p>

  <p>One thing was certain: if he was to act a man's part and die a man's death
  he must not stand long before McGurk. It seemed to him then that he would die
  happy if he had the strength to fire one shot before the end.</p>

  <p>Then he tiptoed from the house and went over the snow to the barn and
  saddled the horse of Hal Boone. It was already morning, and as he led the
  horse to the door of the barn a shadow, a faint shadow in that early light,
  fell across the snow before him.</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw Jacqueline. She stepped close, and the horse nosed
  her shoulder affectionately.</p>

  <p>She said: "Isn't there anything that will keep you from going?"</p>

  <p>"It's just a little ride before breakfast. I'll be back in an hour."</p>

  <p>It was foolish to try to blind her, as he saw by her wan, unchildish
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Is there no other way, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know of any, do you?"</p>

  <p>"You have to leave us, and never come back?"</p>

  <p>"Is he as sure as that, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Sure? Who?"</p>

  <p>She had not known, after all; she thought that he was merely riding away
  from the region where McGurk was king. Now she caught his wrists and shook
  them. "Pierre, you are not going to face McGurk? Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"If you were a man, you would understand."</p>

  <p>"I know; because of your father. I do understand, but oh, Pierre, listen!
  I can shoot as straight as almost any man. We will ride down together. We
  will go through the doors together&mdash;me first to take his fire, and you
  behind to shoot him down."</p>

  <p>"I guess no man can be as brave as a woman, Jack. No; I have to see McGurk
  alone. He faced my father alone and shot him down. I'll face McGurk alone and
  live long enough to put my mark on him."</p>

  <p>"But you don't know him. He can't be hurt. Do you think my father and
  &mdash;and Dick Wilbur would fear any man who could be hurt? No, but McGurk
  has been in a hundred fights and never been touched. There's a charm over
  him, don't you see?"</p>

  <p>"I'll break the charm, that's all."</p>

  <p>He was up in the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll call dad&mdash;I'll call them all&mdash;if you die they shall
  all follow you. I swear they shall. Pierre!"</p>

  <p>He merely leaned forward and touched the horse with his spurs, but after
  he had raced the first hundred yards he glanced back. She was running hard
  for the house, and calling as she went. Pierre cursed and spurred the horse
  again.</p>

  <p>Yet even if Jim Boone and his men started out after him they could never
  overtake him. Before they were in their saddles and up with him, he'd be a
  full three miles out in the hills. Not even black Thunder could make up as
  much ground as that.</p>

  <p>So all the fifteen miles to Gaffney's place he urged his horse. The
  excitement of the race kept the thought of McGurk back in his mind. Only once
  he lost time when he had to pull up beside a buckboard and inquire the way.
  After that he flew on again. Yet as he clattered up to the door of Gaffney's
  crossroads saloon and swung to the ground he looked back and saw a cluster of
  horsemen swing around the shoulder of a hill and come tearing after him.
  Surely his time was short.</p>

  <p>He thrust open the door of the place and called for a drink. The bartender
  spun the glass down the bar to him.</p>

  <p>"Where's McGurk?"</p>

  <p>The other stopped in the very act of taking out the bottle from the shelf,
  and his curious glance went over the face of Pierre le Rouge. He decided,
  apparently, that it was foolish to hold suspicions against so young a
  man.</p>

  <p>"In that room," and he jerked his hand toward a door. "What do you want
  with him?"</p>

  <p>"Got a message for him."</p>

  <p>"Tell it to me, and I'll pass it along."</p>

  <p>Pierre met the eye of the other and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Not <i>this</i> message."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the other, and then shouted: "McGurk!"</p>

  <p>Far away came the rush of hoofs over a hard trail. Only a minute more and
  they would be here; only a minute more and the room would be full of fighting
  men ready to die with him and for him. Yet Pierre was glad; glad that he
  could meet the danger alone; ten minutes from now, if he lived, he could
  answer certainly one way or the other the greatest of all questions: "Am I a
  man?"</p>

  <p>Out of the inner room the pleasant voice which he dreaded answered:
  "What's up?"</p>

  <p>The barkeeper glanced Pierre le Rouge over again and then answered: "A
  friend with a message."</p>

  <p>The door opened and framed McGurk. He did not start, seeing Pierre.</p>

  <p>He said: "None of the rest of them had the guts even to bring me the
  message, eh?"</p>

  <p>Pierre shrugged his shoulders. It was a mighty effort, but he was able to
  look his man fairly in the eyes. "All right, lad. How long is it going to
  take you to clear out of the country?"</p>

  <p>"That's not the message," answered a voice which Pierre did not recognize
  as his own.</p>

  <p>"Out with it, then."</p>

  <p>"It's in the leather on my hip."</p>

  <p>And he went for his gun. Even as he started his hand he knew that he was
  too slow for McGurk, yet the finest splitsecond watch in the world could not
  have caught the differing time they needed to get their guns out of the
  holsters.</p>

  <p>Just a breath before Pierre fired there was a stunning blow on his right
  shoulder and another on his hip. He lurched to the floor, his revolver
  clattering against the wood as he fell, but falling, he scooped up the gun
  with his left and twisted.</p>

  <p>That movement made the third shot of McGurk fly wide and Pierre fired from
  the floor and saw a spasm of pain contract the face of the outlaw.</p>

  <p>Instantly the door behind him flew open and Boone's men stormed into the
  room. Once more McGurk fired, but his wound made his aim wide and the bullet
  merely tore up a splinter beside Pierre's head. A fusillade from Boone and
  his men answered, but the outlaw had leaped back through the door.</p>

  <p>"He's hurt," thundered Boone. "By God, the charm of McGurk is broken.
  Dick, Bud, Gandil, take the outside of the place. I'll force the door."</p>

  <p>Wilbur and the other two raced through the door and raised a shout at
  once, and then there was a rattle of shots. Big Patterson leaned over
  Pierre.</p>

  <p>He said in an awe-stricken voice: "Lad, it's a great work that you've done
  for all of us, if you've drawn the blood from McGurk."</p>

  <p>"His left shoulder," said Pierre, and smiled in spite of his pain. "And
  you, lad?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to live; I've got to finish the job. Who's that beside you?
  There's a mist over my eyes."</p>

  <p>"It's Jack. She outrode us all."</p>

  <p>Then the mist closed over the eyes of Pierre and his senses went out in
  the dark.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

  <p class="first">Those who are curious about the period which followed during
  which the title "Le Rouge" was forgotten and he became known only as "Red"
  Pierre through all the mountain-desert, can hear the tales of his doing from
  the analysts of the ranges. This story has to do only with his struggle with
  McGurk.</p>

  <p>The gap of six years which occurs here is due to the fact that during that
  period McGurk vanished from the mountain-desert. He died away from the eyes
  of men and in their minds he became that tradition which lives still so
  vividly, the tradition of the pale face, the sneering, bloodless lips, and
  the hand which never failed.</p>

  <p>During this lapse of time there were many who claimed that he had ridden
  off into some lonely haunt and died of the wound which he received from
  Pierre's bullet. A great majority, however, would never accept such a story,
  and even when the six years had rolled by they still shook their heads. They
  awaited his return just as certain stanch old Britons await the second coming
  of Arthur from the island of Avalon. In the meantime the terror of his name
  passed on to him who had broken the "charm" of McGurk.</p>

  <p>Not all that grim significance passed on to Red Pierre, indeed, because he
  never impressed the public imagination as did the terrible ruthlessness of
  McGurk. At that he did enough to keep tongues wagging.</p>

  <p>Cattlemen loved to tell those familiar exploits of the "two sheriffs," or
  that "thousand-mile pursuit of Canby," with its half-tragic, half-humorous
  conclusion, or the "Sacking of Two Rivers," or the "three-cornered battle"
  against Rodriguez and Blond.</p>

  <p>But men could not forget that in all his work there rode behind Red Pierre
  six dauntless warriors of the mountain-desert, while McGurk had been always a
  single hand against the world, a veritable lone wolf.</p>

  <p>Whatever kept him away through those six years, the memory of the wound he
  received at Gaffney's place never left McGurk, and now he was coming back
  with a single great purpose in his mind, and in his heart a consuming hatred
  for Pierre and all the other of Boone's men.</p>

  <p>Certainly if he had sensed the second coming of McGurk, Pierre would not
  have ridden so jauntily through the hills this day, or whistled so
  carelessly, or swept the hills with such a complacent, lordly eye. A man of
  mark cannot bear himself too modestly, and Pierre, from boots to high-peaked,
  broad-brimmed sombrero, was the last word in elegance for a rider of the
  mountain-desert.</p>

  <p>Even his mount seemed to sense the pride of his master. It was a cream-
  colored mustang, not one of the lump-headed, bony-hipped species common to
  the ranges, but one of those rare reversions to the Spanish thoroughbreds
  from which the Western cow-pony is descended. The mare was not over-large,
  but the broad hips and generous expanse of chest were hints, and only hints,
  of her strength and endurance. There was the speed of the blooded racer in
  her and the tirelessness of the mustang.</p>

  <p>Now, down the rocky, half-broken trail she picked her way as daintily as
  any debutante tiptoeing down a great stairway to the ballroom. Life had been
  easy for Mary since that thousand-mile struggle to overtake Canby, and now
  her sides were sleek from good feeding and some casual twenty miles a day,
  which was no more to her than a canter through the park is to the city
  horse.</p>

  <p>The eye which had been so red-stained and fierce during the long ride
  after Canby was now bright and gentle. At every turn she pricked her small
  sharp ears as if she expected home and friends on the other side of the
  curve. And now and again she tossed her head and glanced back at the master
  for a moment and then whinnied across some echoing ravine.</p>

  <p>It was Mary's way of showing happiness, and her master's acknowledgment
  was to run his gloved left hand up through her mane and with his ungloved
  right, that tanned and agile hand, pat her shoulder lightly.</p>

  <p>Passing to the end of the down-grade, they reached a slight upward
  incline, and the mare, as if she had come to familiar ground, broke into a
  gallop, a matchless, swinging stride. Swerving to right and to left among the
  great boulders, like a football player running a broken field, she increased
  the gallop to a racing pace.</p>

  <p>That twisting course would have shaken an ordinary horseman to the toes,
  but Pierre, swaying easily in the saddle, dropped the reins into the crook of
  his left arm and rolled a cigarette in spite of the motion and the wind. It
  was a little feat, but it would have drawn applause from a circus crowd.</p>

  <p>He spoke to the mare while he lighted a match and she dropped to an easy
  canter, the pace which she could maintain from dawn to dark, eating up the
  gray miles of the mountain and the desert, and it was then that Red Pierre
  heard a gay voice singing in the distance.</p>

  <p>His attitude changed at once. He caught a shorter grip on the reins and
  swung forward a little in the saddle, while his right hand touched the butt
  of the revolver in its holster and made sure that it was loose; for to those
  who hunt and are hunted every human voice in the mountain-desert is an
  ominous token.</p>

  <p>The mare, sensing the change of her master through that weird telegraphy
  which passed down the taut bridle reins, held her head high and flattened her
  short ears against her neck.</p>

  <p>The song and the singer drew closer, and the vigilance of Pierre ceased as
  he heard a mellow baritone ring out.</p>

  <p class="poem">"They call me poor, yet I am rich<br>
  In the touch of her golden hair,<br>
  My heart is filled like a miser's hands<br>
  With the red-gold of her hair.<br>
  The sky I ride beneath all day<br>
  Is the blue of her dear eyes;<br>
  The only heaven I desire<br>
  Is the blue of her dear eyes."</p>

  <p>And here Dick Wilbur rode about the shoulder of a hill, broke off his song
  at the sight of Pierre le Rouge, and shouted a welcome. They came together
  and continued their journey side by side. The half-dozen years had hardly
  altered the blond, handsome face of Wilbur, and now, with the gladness of his
  singing still flushing his face, he seemed hardly more than a boy&mdash;
  younger, in fact, than Red Pierre, into whose eyes there came now and then a
  grave sternness.</p>

  <p>"After hearing that song," said Pierre smiling, "I feel as if I'd listened
  to a portrait."</p>

  <p>"Right!" said Wilbur, with unabated enthusiasm. "It's the bare and
  unadorned truth, Prince Pierre. My fine Galahad, if you came within eye-shot
  of her there'd be a small-sized hell raised."</p>

  <p>"No. I'm immune there, you know."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. The beauty of a really lovely woman is like a fine perfume. It
  strikes right to a man's heart; there's no possibility of resistance. I know.
  You, Pierre, act like a man already in love or a boy who has never known a
  woman. Which is it, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>The other made a familiar gesture with those who knew him, a touching of
  his left hand against his throat where the cross lay.</p>

  <p>He said: "I suppose it seems like that to you."</p>

  <p>"Like what? Dodging me, eh? Well, I never press the point, but I'd give
  the worth of your horse, Pierre, to see you and Mary together."</p>

  <p>Red Pierre started, and then frowned.</p>

  <p>"Irritates you a little, eh? Well, a woman is like a spur to most
  men."</p>

  <p>He added, with a momentary gloom: "God knows, I bear the marks of
  'em."</p>

  <p>He raised his head, as if he looked up in response to his thought.</p>

  <p>"But there's a difference with this girl. I've named the quality of her
  before&mdash;it disarms a man."</p>

  <p>Pierre looked to his friend with some alarm, for there was a saying among
  the followers of Boone that a woman would be the downfall of big Dick Wilbur
  again, as a woman had been his downfall before. The difference would be that
  this fall must be his last.</p>

  <p>And Wilbur went on: "She's Eastern, Pierre, and out here visiting the
  daughter of old Barnes who owns about a thousand miles of range, you know.
  How long will she be here? That's the question I'm trying to answer for her.
  I met her riding over the hills&mdash;she was galloping along a ridge, and
  she rode her way right into my heart. Well, I'm a fool, of course, but about
  this girl I can't be wrong. Tonight I'm taking her to a masquerade."</p>

  <p>He pulled his horse to a full stop.</p>

  <p>"Pierre, you have to come with me."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

  <p class="first">Pierre stared at his companion with almost open-mouthed
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I? A dance?"</p>

  <p>And then his head tilted back and he laughed.</p>

  <p>"My good times, Dick, come out of the hills and the skyline, and the
  gallop of Mary. But as for women, they bore me, Dick."</p>

  <p>"Even Jack?"</p>

  <p>"She's more man than woman."</p>

  <p>It was the turn of Wilbur to laugh, and he responded uproariously until
  Pierre frowned and flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"When I see you out here on your horse with your rifle in the boot and
  your six-gun swinging low in the scabbard, and riding the fastest bit of
  horseflesh on the ranges," explained Wilbur, "I get to thinking that you're
  pretty much king of the mountains; but in certain respects, Pierre, you're a
  child."</p>

  <p>Pierre stirred uneasily in his saddle. A man must be well over thirty
  before he can withstand ridicule.</p>

  <p>He said dryly: "I've an idea that I know Jack's about as well as the next
  man." "Let it drop," said Wilbur, sober again, for he shared with all of
  Boone's crew a deep-rooted unwillingness to press Red Pierre beyond a certain
  point. "The one subject I won't quarrel about is Jack, God bless her."</p>

  <p>"She's the best pal," said Pierre soberly, "and the nearest to a man I've
  ever met."</p>

  <p>"Nearest to a man?" queried Wilbur, and smiled, but so furtively that even
  the sharp eye of Red Pierre did not perceive the mockery. He went on: "But
  the dance, what of that? It's a masquerade. There'd be no fear of being
  recognized."</p>

  <p>Pierre was silent a moment more. Then he said: "This girl&mdash;what did
  you call her?"</p>

  <p>"Mary."</p>

  <p>"And about her hair&mdash;I think you said it was black?"</p>

  <p>"Golden, Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Mary, and golden hair," mused Red Pierre. "I think I'll go to that
  dance."</p>

  <p>"With Jack? She dances wonderfully, you know."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;with Jack."</p>

  <p>So they reached a tumbled ranch house squeezed between two hills so that
  it was sheltered from the storms of the winter but held all the heat of the
  summer.</p>

  <p>Once it had been a goodly building, the home of some cattle king. But bad
  times had come. A bullet in a saloon brawl put an end to the cattle king, and
  now his home was a wreck of its former glory. The northern wing shelved down
  to the ground as if the building were kneeling to the power of the wind, and
  the southern portion of the house, though still erect, seemed tottering and
  rotten throughout and holding together until at a final blow the whole
  structure would crumple at once.</p>

  <p>To the stables, hardly less ruinous than the big house, Pierre and Wilbur
  took their horses, and a series of whinnies greeted them from the stalls. To
  look down that line of magnificent heads raised above the partitions of the
  stalls was like glancing into the stud of some crowned head who made hunting
  and racing his chief end in life, for these were animals worthy of the sport
  of kings.</p>

  <p>They were chosen each from among literal hundreds, and they were cared for
  far more tenderly than the masters cared for themselves. There was a reason
  in it, for upon their speed and endurance depended the life of the outlaw.
  Moreover, the policy of Jim Boone was one of actual "long riding."</p>

  <p>Here he had come to a pause for a few days to recuperate his horses and
  his men. Tomorrow, perhaps, he would be on the spur again and sweeping off to
  a distant point in the mountain-desert to strike and be gone again before the
  rangers knew well that he had been there. Very rarely did one settler have
  another neighbor at a distance of less than two hundred miles. It meant
  arduous and continual riding, and a horse with any defect was worse than
  useless because the speed of the gang had to be the speed of the slowest
  horse in the lot.</p>

  <p>It was some time before the two long riders had completed the grooming of
  their horses and had gone down the hill and into the house. In the largest
  habitable room they found a fire fed with rotten timbers from the wrecked
  portion of the building, and scattered through the room a sullen and dejected
  group: Mansie, Branch, Jim Boone, and Black Morgan Gandil.</p>

  <p>At a glance it was easy to detect their malady; it was the horrible ennui
  which comes to men who are always surrounded by one set of faces. If a man is
  happily married he may bear with his wife and his children constantly through
  long stretches of time, but the glamour of life lies in the varying
  personalities which a man glimpses in passing, but never knows.</p>

  <p>This was a rare crew. Every man of them was marked for courage and stamina
  and wild daring. Yet even so in their passive moments they hated each other
  with a hate that passed the understanding of common men.</p>

  <p>Through seven years they had held together, through fair weather and foul,
  and now each knew from the other's expression the words that were about to be
  spoken, and each knew that the other was reading him, and loathing what he
  read.</p>

  <p>So they were apt to relapse into long silences unless Jack was with them,
  for being a woman her variety was infinite, or Pierre le Rouge, whom all
  except Black Gandil loved and petted, and feared.</p>

  <p>They were a battered crowd. Wind and hard weather and a thousand suns had
  marked them, and the hand of man had branded them. Here and there was a touch
  of gray in their hair, and about the mouth of each were lines which in such
  silent moments as this one gave an expression of yearning.</p>

  <p>"What's up? What's wrong?" asked Wilbur from the door, but since no answer
  was deigned he said no more.</p>

  <p>But Pierre, like a charmed man who dares to walk among lions, strolled
  easily through the room, and looked into the face of big Boone, who smiled
  faintly up to him, and Black Gandil, who scowled doubly dark, and Bud Mansie,
  who shifted uneasily in his chair and then nodded, and finally to Branch. He
  dropped a hand on the massive shoulder of the blacksmith.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Branch let himself droop back into his chair. His big, dull, colorless
  eyes stared up to his friend.</p>

  <p>"I dunno, lad. I'm just weary with the sort of tired that you can't help
  by sleepin'. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Pierre nodded, slowly, because he sympathized. "And the trouble?"</p>

  <p>Branch stared about as if searching for a reason. "Jack's upstairs
  sulking; Patterson hasn't come home yet."</p>

  <p>And Black Gandil, who heard all things, said without looking up: "A man
  that saves a shipwrecked fellow, he gets bad luck for thanks."</p>

  <p>Pierre turned a considerable eye on him, and Gandil scowled back.</p>

  <p>"You've been croaking for six years, Morgan, about the bad luck that would
  come to Jim from saving me out of the snow. It's never happened, has it?"</p>

  <p>Gandil, snarling from one side of his mouth, answered: "Where's
  Patterson?"</p>

  <p>"Am I responsible if the blockhead has got drunk someplace?"</p>

  <p>"Patterson doesn't get drunk&mdash;not that way. And he knows that we were
  to start again today."</p>

  <p>"There ain't no doubt of that," commented Branch.</p>

  <p>"It's the straight dope. Patterson keeps his dates," said Bud Mansie.</p>

  <p>The booming bass of Jim Boone broke in: "Shut up, the whole gang of you.
  We've had luck for the six years Pierre has been with us. Who calls him a
  Jonah?"</p>

  <p>And Black Gandil answered: "I do. I've sailed the seas. I know bad luck
  when I see it."</p>

  <p>"You've been seeing it for six years."</p>

  <p>"The worst storms come on a voyage that starts with fair weather.
  Patterson? He's gone; he ain't just delayed; he's gone."</p>

  <p>It was not the first of these gloomy prophecies which Gandil had made, but
  each time a heavy gloom broke over Red Pierre. For when he summed up the good
  fortune which the cross of Father Victor had brought him, he found that he
  had gained a father, and lost him at their first meeting; and he had won
  money on that night of the gambling, but it had cost the life of another man
  almost at once. The horse which carried him away from the vengeance in
  Morgantown had died on the way and he had been saved from the landslide, but
  the girl had perished.</p>

  <p>He had driven McGurk from the ranges, and where would the penalty fall on
  those who were near and dear to him? In a superstitious horror he had asked
  himself the question a thousand times, and finally he could hardly bear to
  look into the ominous, brooding eyes of Black Gandil. It was as if the man
  had a certain and evil knowledge of the future.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

  <p class="first">The knowledge of the torment he was inflicting made the eye
  of Black Gandil bright with triumph.</p>

  <p>He continued, and now every man in the room was sitting up, alert, with
  gloomy eyes fixed upon Pierre: "Patterson is the first, but he ain't the
  last. He's just the start. Who's next?" He looked slowly around.</p>

  <p>"Is it you, Bud, or you, Phil, or you, Jim, or maybe me?"</p>

  <p>And Pierre said: "What makes you think you know that trouble's coming,
  Morgan?"</p>

  <p>"Because my blood runs cold in me when I look at you."</p>

  <p>Red Pierre grew rigid and straightened in a way they knew.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Gandil, I've borne with you and your croaking too long, d'ye
  hear? Too long, and I'll hear no more of it, understand?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? You'll hear from me every time I sight you in the offing. You
  c'n lay to that!"</p>

  <p>The others were tense, ready to spring for cover, but Boone reared up his
  great figure.</p>

  <p>"Don't answer him, Pierre. You, Gandil, shut your face or I'll break ye in
  two."</p>

  <p>The fierce eyes of Pierre le Rouge never wavered from his victim, but he
  answered: "Keep out of this. This is <i>my</i> party. I'll tell you why
  you'll stop gibbering, Gandil."</p>

  <p>He made a pace forward and every man shrank a little away from him.</p>

  <p>"Because the cold in your blood is part hate and more fear, Black
  Gandil."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Gandil glared back for an instant. With all his soul he
  yearned for the courage to pull his gun, but his arm was numb; he could not
  move it, and his eyes wavered and fell.</p>

  <p>The shaggy gray head of Jim Boone fell likewise, and he was murmuring to
  his savage old heart: "The good days are over. They'll never rest till one of
  'em is dead, and then the rest will take sides and we'll have gun-plays at
  night. Seven years, and then to break up!"</p>

  <p>Dick Wilbur, as usual, was the pacifier. He strode across the room, and
  the sharp sound of his heels on the creaking floor broke the tension. He said
  softly to Pierre: "You've raised hell enough. Now let's go and get Jack down
  here to undo what you've just finished. Besides, you've got to ask her for
  that dance, eh?"</p>

  <p>The glance of Pierre still lingered on Gandil as he turned and followed
  Wilbur up the complaining stairs to the one habitable room in the second
  story of the house. It was set aside for the use of Jacqueline.</p>

  <p>At the door Wilbur said: "Shrug your shoulders back; you look as if you
  were going to jump at something. And wipe the wolf look off your face. After
  all, Jack's a girl, not a gunfighter."</p>

  <p>Then he knocked and opened the door.</p>

  <p>She lay face down on her bunk, her head turned from them toward the wall.
  Slender and supple and strong, it was still only the size of her boots and
  her hands that would make one look at her twice and then guess that this was
  a woman, for she was dressed, from trousers even to the bright bandanna
  knotted around her throat, like any prosperous range rider.</p>

  <p>Now, to be sure, the thick coils of black hair told her sex, but when the
  broad-brimmed sombrero was pulled well down on her head, when the cartridge-
  belt and the six-gun were slung about her waist, and most of all when she
  spurred her mount recklessly across the hills no one could have suspected
  that this was not some graceful boy born and bred in the mountain-desert,
  willful as a young mountain lion, and as dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Sleepy?" called Wilbur.</p>

  <p>She waited a moment and then queried with exaggerated impudence:
  "Well?"</p>

  <p>Ennui unspeakable was in that drawling monotone.</p>

  <p>"Brace up; I've got news for you. And I've brought Pierre along to tell
  you about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>And she sat bolt upright with shining eyes. Instantly she remembered to
  yawn again, but her glance smiled on them above her hand.</p>

  <p>She apologized. "Awfully sleepy, Dick."</p>

  <p>But he was not deceived. He said: "There's a dance down near the Barnes
  place, and Pierre wants you to go with him."</p>

  <p>"Pierre! A dance?"</p>

  <p>He explained: "Dick's lost his head over a girl with yellow hair, and he
  wants me to go down and see her. He thought you might want to go along." Her
  face changed like the moon when a cloud blows across it. She answered with
  another slow, insolent yawn: "Thanks! I'm staying home tonight."</p>

  <p>Wilbur glared his rage covertly at Pierre, but the latter was blandly
  unconscious that he had made any <i>faux pas</i>.</p>

  <p>He said carelessly: "Too bad. It might be interesting. Jack?"</p>

  <p>At his voice she looked up&mdash;a sharp and graceful toss of her
  head.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"The girl with the yellow hair."</p>

  <p>"Then go ahead and see her. I won't keep you. You don't mind if I go on
  sleeping? Sit down and be at home."</p>

  <p>With this she calmly turned her back again and seemed thoroughly disposed
  to carry out her word.</p>

  <p>Red Pierre flushed a little, watching her, and he spoke his anger
  outright: "You're acting like a sulky kid, Jack, not like a man."</p>

  <p>It was a habit of his to forget that she was a woman. Without turning her
  head she answered: "Do you want to know why?"</p>

  <p>"You're like a cat showing your claws. Go on! Tell me what the reason
  is."</p>

  <p>"Because I get tired of you."</p>

  <p>In all his life he had never been so scorned. He did not see the covert
  grin of Wilbur in the background. He blurted: "Tired?"</p>

  <p>"Awfully. You don't mind me being frank, do you, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>He could only stammer: "Sometimes I wish to God you <i>were</i> a man,
  Jack!"</p>

  <p>"You don't often remember that I'm a woman."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that I'm rude or rough with you, Jacqueline?" Still the
  silence, but Wilbur was grinning broader than ever. "Answer me!"</p>

  <p>She started up and faced him, her face convulsed with rage.</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to say? Yes, you are rude&mdash;I hate you and your
  lot. Go away from me; I don't want you; I hate you all."</p>

  <p>And she would have said more, but furious sobs swelled her throat and she
  could not speak, but dropped, face down, on the bunk and gripped the blankets
  in each hardset hand. Over her Pierre leaned, utterly bewildered, found
  nothing that he could say, and then turned and strode, frowning, from the
  room. Wilbur hastened after him and caught him just as the door was
  closing.</p>

  <p>"Come back," he pleaded. "This is the best game I've ever seen. Come back,
  Pierre! You've made a wonderful start."</p>

  <p>Pierre le Rouge shook off the detaining hand and glared up at Wilbur.</p>

  <p>"Don't try irony, Dick. I feel like murder. Think of it! All this time
  she's been hating me; and now it's making her weep; think of it&mdash;Jack
  &mdash;weeping!"</p>

  <p>"Why, you're a child, Pierre. She's in love with you."</p>

  <p>"With me?"</p>

  <p>"With Red Pierre."</p>

  <p>"You can't make a joke out of Jack with me. You ought to know that."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, I'd as soon make a joke out of a wildcat."</p>

  <p>"Grinning still? Wilbur, I'm taking more from you than I would from any
  man on the ranges."</p>

  <p>"I know you are, and that's why I'm stringing this out because I'm going
  to have a laugh&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;the rest of my life&mdash;ha, ha, ha,
  ha!&mdash;whenever I think of this!"</p>

  <p>The burst of merriment left him speechless, and Pierre, glowering, his
  right hand twitching dangerously close to that holster at his hip. He
  sobered, and said: "Go in and talk to her and prove that I'm right."</p>

  <p>"Ask Jack if she loves me? Why, I'd as soon ask any man the same
  question."</p>

  <p>The big long-rider was instantly curious.</p>

  <p>"Has she never appealed to you as a woman, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"How could she? I've watched her ride; I've watched her use her gun; I've
  slept rolled in the same blankets with her, back to back; I've walked and
  talked and traveled with her as if she were my kid brother."</p>

  <p>Wilbur nodded, as if the miracle were being slowly unfolded before his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"And you've never noticed anything different about her? Never watched a
  little lift and grace in her walk that no man could ever have; never seen her
  color change just because you, Pierre, came near or went far away from
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Because of me?" asked the bewildered Pierre.</p>

  <p>"You fool, you! Why, lad, I've been kept amused by you two for a whole
  evening, watching her play for your attention, saving her best smiles for
  you, keeping her best attitudes for you, and letting all the richness of her
  voice go out for&mdash;a block&mdash;a stone. Gad, the thing still doesn't
  seem possible! Pierre, one instant of that girl would give romance to a man's
  whole life."</p>

  <p>"This girl? This Jack of ours?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't seen it! Why, if I hadn't seen years ago that she had tied her
  hands and turned her heart over to you, I'd have been begging her for a
  smile, a shadow of a hope."</p>

  <p>"If I didn't know you, Dick, I'd say that you were partly drunk and partly
  a fool."</p>

  <p>"Here's a hundred&mdash;a cold hundred that I'm right. I'll make it a
  thousand, if you dare."</p>

  <p>"Dare what?"</p>

  <p>"Ask her to marry you." "Marry&mdash;me?"</p>

  <p>"Damn it all&mdash;well, then&mdash;whatever you like. But I say that if
  you go back into that room and sit still and merely look at her, she'll be in
  your arms within five minutes."</p>

  <p>"I hate to take charity, but a bet is a bet. That hundred is in my pocket
  already. It's a go!"</p>

  <p>They shook hands.</p>

  <p>"But what will be your proof, Dick, whether I win or lose?"</p>

  <p>"Your face, blockhead, when you come out of the room."</p>

  <p>Upon this Pierre pondered a moment, and then turned toward the door. He
  set his hand on the knob, faltered, and finally set his teeth and entered the
  room.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

  <p class="first">She lay as he had left her, except that her face was now
  pillowed in her arms, and the long sobs kept her body quivering. Curiosity
  swept over Pierre, looking down at her, but chiefly a puzzled grief such as a
  man feels when a friend is in trouble. He came closer and laid a hand on her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Jack!"</p>

  <p>She turned far enough to strike his hand away and instantly resumed her
  former position, though the sobs were softer. This childish anger irritated
  him. He was about to storm out of the room when the thought of the hundred
  dollars stopped him. The bet had been made, and it seemed unsportsmanlike to
  leave without some effort.</p>

  <p>The effort which he finally made was that suggested by Wilbur. He folded
  his arms and stood silent, waiting, and ready to judge the time as nearly as
  he could until the five minutes should have elapsed. He was so busy computing
  the minutes that it was with a start that he noticed some time later that the
  weeping had ceased. She lay quiet. Her hand was dabbing furtively at her face
  for a purpose which Pierre could not surmise.</p>

  <p>At last a broken voice murmured: "Pierre!"</p>

  <p>He would not speak, but something in the voice made his anger go. After a
  little it came, and louder this time: "Pierre?"</p>

  <p>He did not stir.</p>

  <p>She whirled and sat on the edge of the bunk, crying: "Pierre!" with a note
  of fright.</p>

  <p>Still he persisted in that silence, his arms folded, the keen blue eyes
  considering her as if from a great distance.</p>

  <p>She explained: "I was afraid&mdash;Pierre! Why don't you speak? Tell me,
  are you angry?"</p>

  <p>And she sprang up and made a pace toward him. She had never seemed so
  little manlike, so wholly womanly. And the hand which stretched toward him,
  palm up, was a symbol of everything new and strange that he found in her.</p>

  <p>He had seen it balled to a small, angry fist, brown and dangerous; he had
  seen it gripping the butt of a revolver, ready for the draw; he had seen it
  tugging at the reins and holding a racing horse in check with an ease which a
  man would envy; but never before had he seen it turned palm up, to his
  knowledge; and now, because he could not speak to her, according to his plan,
  he studied her thoroughly for the first time.</p>

  <p>Slender and marvelously made was that hand. The whole woman was in it,
  made for beauty, not for use. It was all he could do to keep from
  exclaiming.</p>

  <p>She made a quick step toward him, eager, uncertain: "Pierre, I thought you
  had left me&mdash;that you were gone, and angry."</p>

  <p>Something caught on fire in Pierre, but still he would say nothing. He was
  beginning to feel a cruel pleasure in his victory, but it was not without a
  deep sense of danger.</p>

  <p>She had laid aside her six-gun, but she had not abandoned it. She had laid
  aside her anger, but she could resume it again as swiftly as she could take
  up her revolver.</p>

  <p>She cried with a little burst of rage: "Pierre, you are making a game of
  me!"</p>

  <p>But seeing that he did not change she altered swiftly and caught his hand
  in both of hers. She spoke the name which she always used when she was
  greatly moved.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Pierre le Rouge, what have I done?"</p>

  <p>His silence tempted her on like the smile of the sphinx.</p>

  <p>And suddenly she was inside his arms, though how she separated them he
  could not tell, and crying: "Pierre, I am unhappy. Help me, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>It was true, then, and Wilbur had won his bet. But how could it have
  happened? He took the arms that encircled his neck and brought them slowly
  down, and watched her curiously. Something was expected of him, but what it
  was he could not tell, for women were as strange to him as the wild sea is
  strange to the Arab.</p>

  <p>He hunted his mind, and then: "One of the boys has angered you, Jack?"</p>

  <p>And she said, because she could think of no way to cover the confusion
  which came to her after the outbreak: "Yes."</p>

  <p>He dropped her arms and strode a pace or two up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"Gandil?"</p>

  <p>"N-no!" "You're lying. It was Gandil."</p>

  <p>And he made straight for the door.</p>

  <p>She ran after him and flung herself between him and the door. Clearly, as
  if it were a painted picture, she saw him facing Gandil&mdash;saw their hands
  leap for the guns&mdash;saw Gandil pitch face forward on the floor. "Pierre
  &mdash;for God's sake!"</p>

  <p>Her terror convinced him partially, and the furor went back from his eyes
  as a light goes back in a long, dark hall.</p>

  <p>"On your honor, Jack, it's not Gandil?"</p>

  <p>"On my honor."</p>

  <p>"But someone has broken you up. And he's here&mdash;he's one of us, this
  man who's bothered you."</p>

  <p>She could not help but answer: "Yes."</p>

  <p>He scowled down at the floor.</p>

  <p>"You would never be able to guess who it is. Give it up. After all
  &mdash;I can live through it&mdash;I guess."</p>

  <p>He took her face between his hands and frowned down into her eyes. "Tell
  me his name, Jack, and the dog&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She said: "Let me go. Take your hands away, Pierre."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her, deeply worried, and she stood up for a moment with a hand
  pressed over her eyes, swaying. He had never seen her like this; he was like
  a pilot striving to steer his ship through an unfathomable fog. Following
  what had become an instinct with him, he raised his left hand and touched the
  cross beneath his throat. And inspiration came to him.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

  <p class="first">"Whether you want to or not, Jack, we'll go to this dance
  tonight."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's hand fell away from her eyes. She seemed suddenly glad
  again.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to take me, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>He explained: "Of course. Besides, we have to keep an eye on Wilbur. This
  girl with the yellow hair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She had altered swiftly again. There was no understanding her or following
  her moods this day. He decided to disregard them, as he had often done
  before.</p>

  <p>"Black Gandil swears that I'm bringing bad luck to the boys at last.
  Patterson has disappeared; Wilbur has lost his head about a girl. We've got
  to save Dick."</p>

  <p>He knew that she was fond of Wilbur, but she showed no enthusiasm now.</p>

  <p>"Let him go his own way. He's big enough to take care of himself."</p>

  <p>"But it's common talk, Jack, that the end of Wilbur will come through a
  woman. It was that that sent him on the long trail, you know. And this girl
  with the yellow hair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why do you harp on her?"</p>

  <p>"Harp on her?"</p>

  <p>"Every other word&mdash;nothing but yellow hair. I'm sick of it. I know
  the kind&mdash;faded corn color&mdash;dyed, probably. Pierre, you are all
  blind, and you most of all."</p>

  <p>This being obviously childish, Pierre brushed the consideration of it from
  his mind. "And for clothes, Jack?"</p>

  <p>They were both dumb. It had been years since she had worn the clothes of a
  woman. She had danced with the men of her father's gang many a time while
  someone whistled or played on a mouth-organ, and there was the time they rode
  into Beulah Ferry and held up the dance hall, and Jim Boone and Mansie lined
  up the crowd with their hands held high above their heads while the sweating
  musicians played fast and furious and Jack and Pierre danced down the center
  of the hall.</p>

  <p>She had danced many a time, but never in the clothes of a woman; so they
  stared, mutely puzzled.</p>

  <p>A though came first to Jacqueline. She stepped close and murmured her
  suggestion in the ear of Pierre. Whatever it was, it made his jaw set hard
  and brought grave lines into his face.</p>

  <p>She stepped back, asking: "Well?"</p>

  <p>"We'll do it. What a little demon you are, Jack!"</p>

  <p>"Then we'll have to start now. There's barely time."</p>

  <p>They ran from the room together, and as they passed through the room below
  Wilbur called after them: "The dance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Wait and go with me."</p>

  <p>"We ride in a roundabout way."</p>

  <p>They were through the door as Pierre called back, and a moment later the
  hoofs of their horses scattered the gravel down the hillside. Jacqueline rode
  a black stallion sired by her father's mighty Thunder, who had grown old but
  still could do the work of three ordinary horses in carrying the great bulk
  of his master. The son of Thunder was little like his sire, but a
  slender-limbed racer, graceful, nervous, eager. A clumsy rider would have
  ruined the horse in a single day's hard work among the trails of the
  mountain-desert, but Jacqueline, fairly reading the mind of the black, nursed
  his strength when it was needed and let him run free and swift when the
  ground before him was level.</p>

  <p>Now she picked her course dexterously down the hillside with the cream-
  colored mare of Pierre following half a length behind.</p>

  <p>After the first down-pitch of ground was covered they passed into
  difficult terrain, and for half an hour went at a jog trot, winging in and
  out among the rocks, climbing steadily up and up through the hills.</p>

  <p>Here the ground opened up again, and they roved on at a free gallop, the
  black always half a length in front. Along the ridge of a crest, an almost
  level stretch of a mile or more, Jack eased the grip on the reins, and the
  black responded with a sudden lengthening of stride and lowered his head with
  ears pressed back flat while he fairly flew over the ground.</p>

  <p>Nothing could match that speed. The strong mare fell to the rear, fighting
  gamely, but beaten by that effort of the stallion.</p>

  <p>Jack swerved in the saddle and looked back, laughing her triumph. Pierre
  smiled grimly in response and leaned forward, shifting his weight more over
  the withers of Mary. He spoke to her, and one of her pricking ears fell back
  as if to listen to his voice. He spoke again and the other ear fell back, her
  neck straightened, she gave her whole heart to her work.</p>

  <p>First she held the stallion even, then she began to gain. That was the
  meaning of those round, strong hips, and the breadth of the chest. She needed
  a half-mile of running to warm her to her work, and now the black came back
  to her with every leap.</p>

  <p>The thunder of the approaching hoofs warned the girl. One more glance she
  cast in apprehension over her shoulder, and then brought her spurs into play
  again and again. Still the rush of hoofs behind her grew louder and louder,
  and now there was a panting at her side and the head of cream-colored Mary
  drew up and past.</p>

  <p>She gave up the battle with a little shout of anger and slowed up her
  mount with a sharp pull on the reins. It needed only a word from Pierre and
  his mare drew down to a hand-gallop, twisting her head a little toward the
  black as if she called for some recognition of her superiority.</p>

  <p>"It's always this way," cried Jack, and jerked at the reins with a
  childish impotence of anger. "I beat you for the first quarter of a mile and
  then this fool of a horse&mdash;I'm going to give him away."</p>

  <p>"The black," said Pierre, assuming an air of quiet and superior knowing
  which always aggravated her most, "is a good second-rate cayuse when someone
  who knows horses is in the saddle. I'd give you fifty for him on the strength
  of his looks and keep him for a decoration."</p>

  <p>She could only glare her speechless rage for a moment. Then she changed
  swiftly and threw out her hands in a little gesture of surrender.</p>

  <p>"After all, what difference does it make? Your Mary can beat him in a long
  run or a short one, but it's your horse, Pierre, and that takes the sting
  away. If it were anyone else's I'd&mdash;well, I'd shoot either the horse or
  the rider. But my partner's horse is my horse, you know."</p>

  <p>He swerved his mare sharply to the left and took her hand with a strong
  grip.</p>

  <p>"Jack, of all the men I've ever known, I'd rather ride with you, I'd
  rather fight for you."</p>

  <p>"Of all the <i>men</i> you ever knew," she said, "I suppose that I
  am."</p>

  <p>He did not hear the low voice, for he was looking out over the canyon. A
  few moments later they swung out onto the very crest of the range.</p>

  <p>On all sides the hills dropped away through the gloom of the evening,
  brown nearby, but falling off through a faint blue haze and growing
  blue-black with the distance. A sharp wind, chill with the coming of night,
  cut at them. Not a hundred feet overhead shot a low-winging hawk back from
  his day's hunting and rising only high enough to clear the range and then
  plunge down toward his nest.</p>

  <p>Like the hawks they peered down from their point of vantage into the
  profound gloom of the valley below. They shaded their eyes and studied it
  with a singular interest for long moments, patient, as the hawk.</p>

  <p>So these two marauders stared until she raised a hand slowly and then
  pointed down. He followed the direction she indicated, and there, through the
  haze of the evening, he made out a glimmer of lights.</p>

  <p>He said sharply: "I know the place, but we'll have a devil of a ride to
  get there."</p>

  <p>And like the swooping hawk they started down the slope. It was precipitous
  in many places, but Pierre kept almost at a gallop, making the mare take the
  slopes often crouched back on her haunches with forefeet braced forward, and
  sliding many yards at a time.</p>

  <p>In between the boulders he darted, twisting here and there, and always
  erect and jaunty in the saddle, swaying easily with every movement of the
  mare. Not far behind him came the girl. Fine rider that she was, she could
  not hope to compete with such matchless horsemanship where man and horse were
  only one piece of strong brawn and muscle, one daring spirit. Many a time the
  chances seemed too desperate to her, but she followed blindly where he led,
  setting her teeth at each succeeding venture, and coming out safe every time,
  until they swung out at last through a screen of brush and onto the level
  floor of the valley.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

  <p class="first">In the heart of that valley two roads crossed. Many a year
  before a man with some imagination and illimitable faith was moved by the
  crossing of those roads to build a general merchandise store.</p>

  <p>Time justified his faith, in a small way, and now McGuire's store was
  famed for leagues and leagues about, for he dared to take chances with all
  manner of novelties, and the curious, when their pocketbooks were full, went
  to McGuire's to find inspiration.</p>

  <p>Business was dull this night, however; there was not a single patron at
  the bar, and the store itself was empty, so he went to put out the big
  gasoline lamp which hung from the ceiling in the center of the room, and was
  on the ladder, reaching high above his head, when a singular chill caught him
  in the center of his plump back and radiated from that spot in all
  directions, freezing his blood. He swallowed the lump in his throat and with
  his arms still stretched toward the lamp he turned his head and glanced
  behind.</p>

  <p>Two men stood watching him from a position just inside the door. How they
  had come there he could never guess, for the floor creaked at the lightest
  step. Nevertheless, these phantoms had appeared silently, and now they must
  be dealt with. He turned on the ladder to face them, and still he kept the
  arms automatically above his head while he descended to the floor. However,
  on a closer examination, these two did not seem particularly formidable. They
  were both quite young, one with dark-red hair and a somewhat overbright eye;
  the other was hardly more than a boy, very slender, delicately made, the sort
  of handsome young scoundrel whom women cannot resist.</p>

  <p>Having made these observations, McGuire ventured to lower his arms by
  jerks; nothing happened; he was safe. So he vented his feelings by scowling
  on the strangers.</p>

  <p>"Well," he snapped, "what's up? Too late for business. I'm closin'
  up."</p>

  <p>The two quite disregarded him. Their eyes were wandering calmly about the
  place, and now they rested on the pride of McGuire's store. The figure of a
  man in evening clothes, complete from shoes to gloves and silk hat, stood
  beside a girl of wax loveliness. She wore a low-cut gown of dark green, and
  over her shoulders was draped a scarf of dull gold. Above, a sign said: "You
  only get married once; why don't you do it up right?"</p>

  <p>"That," said the taller stranger, "ought to do very nicely for us,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>And the younger replied in a curiously light, pleasant voice: "Just what
  we want. But how'll I get away with all that fluffy stuff, eh?"</p>

  <p>The elder explained: "We're going to a bit of a dance and we'll take those
  evening clothes."</p>

  <p>The heart of McGuire beat faster and his little eyes took in the strangers
  again from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"They ain't for sale," he said. "They's just samples. But right over here
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This isn't a question of selling," said the red-headed man. "We've come
  to accept a little donation, McGuire."</p>

  <p>The storekeeper grew purple and white in patches. Still there was no show
  of violence, no display of guns; he moved his hand toward his own weapon, and
  still the strangers merely smiled quietly on him. He decided that he had
  misunderstood, and went on: "Over here I got a line of goods that you'll
  like. Just step up and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The younger man, frowning now, replied: "We don't want to see any more of
  your junk. The clothes on the models suit us all right. Slip 'em off,
  McGuire."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" began McGuire and then stopped.</p>

  <p>His first suspicion returned with redoubled force; above all, that head of
  dark red hair made him thoughtful. He finished hoarsely: "What the hell's
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Why," smiled the taller man, "you've never done much in the interests of
  charity, and now's a good time for you to start. Hurry up, McGuire; we're
  late already!"</p>

  <p>There was a snarl from the storekeeper, and he went for his gun, but
  something in the peculiarly steady eyes of the two made him stop with his
  fingers frozen hard around the butt.</p>

  <p>He whispered: "You're Red Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"The clothes," repeated Pierre sternly, "on the jump, McGuire."</p>

  <p>And with a jump McGuire obeyed. His hands trembled so that he could hardly
  remove the scarf from the shoulders of the model, but afterward fear made his
  fingers supple, as he did up the clothes in two bundles.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline took one of them and Pierre the other under his left arm; with
  his right hand he drew out some yellow coins.</p>

  <p>"I didn't buy these clothes because I didn't have the time to dicker with
  you, McGuire. I've heard you talk prices before, you know. But here's what
  the clothes are worth to us."</p>

  <p>And into the quaking hands of McGuire he poured a chinking stream of gold
  pieces.</p>

  <p>Relief, amazement, and a very wholesome fear struggled in the face of
  McGuire as he saw himself threefold overpaid. At that little yellow heap he
  remained staring, unheeding the sound of the retreating outlaws.</p>

  <p>"It ain't possible," he said at last, "thieves have begun to pay."</p>

  <p>His eyes sought the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"So that's Red Pierre?" said McGuire.</p>

  <p>As for Pierre and Jacqueline, they were instantly safe in the black heart
  of the mountains. Many a mile of hard riding lay before them, however, and
  there was no road, not even a trail that they could follow. They had never
  even seen the Crittenden schoolhouse; they knew its location only by vague
  descriptions.</p>

  <p>But they had ridden a thousand times in places far more bewildering and
  less known to them. Like all true denizens of the mountain-desert, they had a
  sense of direction as uncanny as that of an Eskimo. Now they struck off
  confidently through the dark and trailed up and down through the mountains
  until they reached a hollow in the center of which shone a group of dim
  lights. It was the schoolhouse near the Barnes place, the scene of the
  dance.</p>

  <p>So they turned back behind the hills and in the covert of a group of
  cottonwoods they kindled two more little fires, shading them on three sides
  with rocks and leaving them open for the sake of light on the fourth.</p>

  <p>They worked busily for a time, without a word spoken by either of them.
  The only sound was the rustling of Jacqueline's stolen silks and the purling
  of a small stream of water near them, some meager spring.</p>

  <p>But presently: "P-P-Pierre, I'm f-freezing."</p>

  <p>He himself was numbed by the chill air and paused in the task of thrusting
  a leg into the trousers, which persisted in tangling and twisting under his
  foot.</p>

  <p>"So'm I. It's c-c-cold as the d-d-d-devil."</p>

  <p>"And these&mdash;th-things&mdash;aren't any thicker than spider webs."
  "Wait. I'll build you a great big fire."</p>

  <p>And he scooped up a number of dead twigs.</p>

  <p>There was an interlude of more silk rustling, then: "P-P-Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I had a m-m-m-mirror."</p>

  <p>"Jack, are you vain?"</p>

  <p>A cry of delight answered him. He threw caution to the winds and advanced
  on her. He found her kneeling above a pool of water fed by the soft sliding
  little stream from the spring. With one hand she held a burning branch by way
  of a torch, and with the other she patted her hair into shape and finally
  thrust the comb into the glittering, heavy coils.</p>

  <p>She started, as if she felt his presence.</p>

  <p>"P-P-Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>She stood with the torch high overhead, and he saw a beauty so glorious
  that he closed his eyes involuntarily and still he saw the vision in the
  dull- green gown, with the scarf of old gold about her dazzling white
  shoulders. And there were two lights, the barbaric red of the jewels in her
  hair, and the black shimmer of her eyes. He drew back a step more. It was a
  picture to be looked at from a distance.</p>

  <p>She ran to him with a cry of dismay: "Pierre, what's wrong with me?"</p>

  <p>His arms went round her of their own accord. It was the only place they
  could go. And all this beauty was held in the circle of his will.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that, but you're so wonderful, Jack, so glorious, that I hardly
  know you. You're like a different person."</p>

  <p>He felt the warm body trembling, and the thought that it was not entirely
  from the cold set his heart beating like a trip-hammer. What he felt was so
  strange to him that he stepped back in a vague alarm, and then laughed. She
  stood with an expectant smile.</p>

  <p>"Jack, how am I to risk you in the arms of all the strangers in that
  dance?</p>

  <p>"It's late. Listen!"</p>

  <p>She cupped a hand at her ear and leaned to listen. Up from the hollow
  below them came a faint strain of music, a very light sound that was drowned
  a moment later by the solemn rushing of the wind through the great trees
  above them.</p>

  <p>They looked up of one accord.</p>

  <p>"Pierre, what was that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing; the wind in the branches, that's all."</p>

  <p>"It was a hushing sound. It was like&mdash;it was like a warning,
  almost."</p>

  <p>But he was already turning away, and she followed him hastily.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline could never ride a horse in that gown, or even
  sit sidewise in the saddle without hopelessly crumpling it, so they walked to
  the schoolhouse. It was a slow progress, for she had to step lightly and
  carefully for fear of the slippers. He took her bare arm and helped her; he
  would never have thought of it under ordinary conditions, but since she had
  put on this gown she was greatly changed to him, no longer the wild, free
  rider of the mountain-desert, but a defenseless, strangely weak being. Her
  strength was now something other than the skill to ride hard and shoot
  straight and quick.</p>

  <p>So they came to the schoolhouse and reached the long line of buggies,
  buckboards, and, most of all, saddled horses. They crowded the horse-shed
  where the school children stabled their mounts in the winter weather. They
  were tethered to the posts of the fence; they were grouped about the
  trees.</p>

  <p>It was a prodigious gathering, and a great affair for the mountain-
  desert. They knew this even before they had set foot within the building.</p>

  <p>They stopped here and adjusted their masks carefully. They were made from
  a strip of black lining which Jack had torn from one of the coats in the
  trunk which lay far back in the hills.</p>

  <p>Those masks had to be tied firmly and well, for some jester might try to
  pull away that of Pierre, and if his face were seen, it would be death&mdash;
  a slaughter without defense, for he had not been able to conceal his big Colt
  in these tight-fitting clothes. Even as it was, there was peril from the
  moment that the lights within should shine on that head of dark-red hair.</p>

  <p>As for Jack, there was little fear that she would be recognized. She was
  strange even to Pierre every time he looked down at her, for she had ceased
  to be Jack and had become very definitely "Jacqueline." But the masks were
  on; the scarf adjusted about the throat and bare, shivering shoulders of
  Jack, and they stood arm in arm before the door out of which streamed the
  voices and the music.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>But she was trembling so, either from fear, or excitement, or both, that
  he had to take a firm hold on her arm and almost carry her up the steps,
  shove the door open, and force her in. A hundred eyes were instantly upon
  them, practiced, suspicious eyes, accustomed to search into all things and
  take nothing for granted; eyes of men who, when a rap came at the door,
  looked to see whether or not the shadow of the stranger fell full in the
  center of the crack beneath the door. If it fell to one side the man might be
  an enemy, and therefore they would stand at one side of the room, their hands
  upon the butt of a six-gun, and shout: "Come in." Such was the battery of
  glances from the men, and the color of Pierre altered, paled.</p>

  <p>He knew some of those faces, for those who hunt and are hunted never
  forget the least gestures of their enemies. There was a mighty temptation to
  turn back even then, but he set his teeth and forced himself to stand
  calmly.</p>

  <p>The chuckle which replied to this maneuver freed him for the moment.
  Suspicion was lulled. Moreover, the red-jeweled hair of Jacqueline and her
  lighted eyes called all attention almost immediately upon her. She shifted
  the golden scarf&mdash;the white arms and breast flashed in the light&mdash;a
  gasp responded. There would be talk tomorrow; there were whispers even
  now.</p>

  <p>It was not the main hall that they stood in, for this school, having been
  built by an aspiring community, contained two rooms; this smaller room, used
  by the little ones of the school, was now converted into a hat-and-cloak
  room.</p>

  <p>Pierre hung up his hat, removed his gloves slowly, nerving himself to
  endure the sharp glances, and opened the door for Jacqueline.</p>

  <p>If she had held back tremulously before, something she had seen in the
  eyes of those in the first room, something in the whisper and murmur which
  rose the moment she started to leave, gave her courage. She stepped into the
  dance- hall like a queen going forth to address devoted subjects. The second
  ordeal was easier than the first. There were many times more people in that
  crowded room, but each was intent upon his own pleasure. A wave of warmth and
  light swept upon them, and a blare of music, and a stir and hum of voices,
  and here and there the sweet sound of a happy girl's laughter. They raised
  their heads, these two wild rangers of the mountain-desert, and breathed deep
  of the fantastic scene.</p>

  <p>There was no attempt at beauty in the costumes of the masqueraders. Here
  and there some girl achieved a novel and pleasing effect; but on the whole
  they strove for cheaper and more stirring things in the line of the
  grotesque.</p>

  <p>Here passed a youth wearing a beard made from the stiff, red bristles of
  the tail of a sorrel horse. Another wore a bear's head cunningly stuffed, the
  grinning teeth flashing over his head and the skin draped over his shoulders.
  A third disfigured himself by painting after the fashion of an Indian on the
  warpath, with crimson streaks down his forehead and red and black across his
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>But not more than a third of all the assembly made any effort to
  masquerade, beyond the use of the simple black mask across the upper part of
  the face. The rest of the men and women contented themselves with wearing the
  very finest clothes they could afford to buy, and there was through the air a
  scent of the general merchandise store which not even a liberal use of cheap
  perfume and all the drifts of pale-blue cigarette smoke could quite
  overcome.</p>

  <p>As for the music, it was furnished by two very old men, relics of the days
  when there were contests in fiddling; a stout fellow of middle age, with
  cheeks swelled almost to bursting as he thundered out terrific blasts on a
  slide trombone; a youth who rattled two sticks on an overturned dish-pan in
  lieu of a drum, and a cornetist of real skill.</p>

  <p>There were hard faces in the crowd, most of them, of men who had set their
  teeth against hard weather and hard men, and fought their way through, not to
  happiness, but to existence, so that fighting had become their pleasure.</p>

  <p>Now they relaxed their eternal vigilance, their eternal suspicion. Another
  phase of their nature weakened. Some of them were smiling and laughing for
  the first time in months, perhaps, of labor and loneliness on the range. With
  the gates of good-nature opened, a veritable flood of gaiety burst out. It
  glittered in their eyes, it rose to their lips in a wild laughter. They
  seemed to be dancing more furiously fast in order to forget the life which
  they had left, and to which they must return.</p>

  <p>These were the conquerors of the bitter nature of the mountain-desert.
  There was beauty here, the beauty of strength in the men and a brown
  loveliness in the girls; just as in the music, the blatancy of the rattling
  dish-pan and the blaring trombone were more than balanced by the real skill
  of the violinists, who kept a high, sweet, singing tone through all the
  clamor.</p>

  <p>And Pierre le Rouge and Jacqueline? They stood aghast for a moment when
  that crash of noise broke around them; but they came from a life where there
  was nothing of beauty except the lonely strength of the mountains and the
  appalling silences of the stars that roll above the desert. Almost at once
  they caught the overtone of human joyousness, and they turned with smiles to
  each other, and it was "Pierre?" "Jack?" Then a nod, and she was in his arms,
  and they glided into the dance.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>

  <p class="first">When a crowd gathers in the street, there rises a babel of
  voices, a confused and pointless clamor, no matter what the purpose of the
  gathering, until some man who can think as well as shout begins to speak.
  Then the crowd murmurs a moment, and after a few seconds composes itself to
  listen.</p>

  <p>So it was with the noise in the hall when Pierre and Jacqueline began to
  dance. First there were smiles of derision and envy around them, but after a
  moment a little hush came where they moved.</p>

  <p>They could not help but dance well, for they had youth and grace and
  strength, and the glances of applause and envy were like wine to quicken
  their blood, while above all they caught the overtone of the singing violins,
  and danced by that alone. The music ended with a long flourish just as they
  whirled to a stop in a corner of the room. At once an eddy of men started
  toward them.</p>

  <p>"Who shall it be?" smiled Pierre. "With whom do you want to dance? It's
  your triumph, Jack."</p>

  <p>She was alight and alive with the victory, and her eyes roved over the
  crowd.</p>

  <p>"The big man with the tawny hair."</p>

  <p>"But he's making right past us."</p>

  <p>"No; he'll turn and come back."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>For answer she glanced up and laughed, and he realized with a singular
  sense of loneliness that she knew many things which were beyond his ken.
  Someone touched his arm, and a voice, many voices, beset him.</p>

  <p>"How's the chances for a dance with the girl, partner?"</p>

  <p>"This dance is already booked," Pierre answered, and kept his eyes on the
  tall man with the scarred face and the resolute jaw. He wondered why
  Jacqueline had chosen such a partner.</p>

  <p>At least she had prophesied correctly, for the big man turned toward them
  just as he seemed about to head for another part of the hall. The crowd gave
  way before him, not that he shouldered them aside, but they seemed to feel
  the coming of his shadow before him, and separated as they would have done
  before the shadow of a falling tree.</p>

  <p>In another moment Pierre found himself looking up to the giant. No mask
  could cover that long, twisting mark of white down his cheek, nor hide the
  square set of the jaw, nor dim the steady eyes.</p>

  <p>And there came to Pierre an exceedingly great uneasiness in his right
  hand, and a twitching of the fingers low down on his thigh where the familiar
  holster should have hung. His left hand rose, following the old instinct, and
  touched beneath his throat where the cold cross lay.</p>

  <p>He was saying easily: "This is your dance, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Right, Bud," answered the big man in a mellow voice as great as his size.
  "Sorry I can't swap partners with you, but I hunt alone."</p>

  <p>An overwhelming desire to get a distance between himself and this huge
  unknown came to Pierre.</p>

  <p>He said: "There goes the music. You're off."</p>

  <p>And the other, moving toward Jack, leaned down a little and murmured at
  the ear of the outlaw: "Thanks, Pierre."</p>

  <p>Then he was gone, and Jacqueline was laughing over his shoulder back to
  Pierre.</p>

  <p>Through his daze and through the rising clamor of the music, a voice said
  beside him: "You look sort of sick, dude. Who's your friend?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know him?" asked Pierre.</p>

  <p>"No more than I do you; but I've ridden the range for ten years around
  here, and I know that he's new to these parts. If I'd ever glimpsed him
  before, I'd remember him. He'd be a bad man in a mix, eh?"</p>

  <p>And Pierre answered with devout earnestness: "He would."</p>

  <p>"But where'd you buy those duds, pal? Hey, look! Here's what I've been
  waiting for&mdash;the Barneses and the girl that's visitin' 'em from the
  East."</p>

  <p>"What girl?"</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>The Barnes group was passing through the door, and last came the
  unmistakable form of Dick Wilbur, masked, but not masked enough to hide his
  familiar smile or cover the well-known sound of his laughter as it drifted to
  Pierre across the hall, and on his arm was a girl in an evening dress of
  blue, with a small, black mask across her eyes, and deep-golden hair.</p>

  <p>Pausing before she swung into the dance with Wilbur, she made a gesture
  with the white arm, and looked up laughing to big, handsome Dick. Pierre
  trembled with a red rage when he saw the hands of Wilbur about her.</p>

  <p>Dick, in passing, marked Pierre's stare above the heads of the crowd, and
  frowned with trouble. The hungry eyes of Pierre followed them as they circled
  the hall again; and this time Wilbur, perhaps fearing that something had gone
  wrong with Pierre, steered close to the edge of the dancing crowd and looked
  inquisitively across.</p>

  <p>He leaned and spoke to the girl, and she turned her head, smiling, to
  Pierre. Then the smile went out, and even despite the mask, he saw her eyes
  widen. She stopped and slipped from the arm of Wilbur, and came step by step
  slowly toward him like one walking in her sleep. There, by the edge of the
  dancers, with the noise of the music and the shuffling feet to cover them,
  they met. The hands she held to him were cold and trembling.</p>

  <p>"Is it you?"</p>

  <p>"It is I."</p>

  <p>That was all; and then the shadow of Wilbur loomed above them.</p>

  <p>"What's this? Do you know each other? It isn't possible! Pierre, are you
  playing a game with me?"</p>

  <p>But under the glance of Pierre he fell back a step, and reached for the
  gun which was not there. They were alone once more.</p>

  <p>"Mary&mdash;Mary Brown!"</p>

  <p>"Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"But you are dead!"</p>

  <p>"No, no! But you&mdash;Pierre, where can we go?"</p>

  <p>"Outside."</p>

  <p>"Let us go quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Do you need a wrap?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But it is cold outside, and your shoulders are bare."</p>

  <p>"Then take that cloak. But quickly, Pierre, before we're followed."</p>

  <p>He drew it about her; he led her through the door; it clicked shut; they
  were alone with the sweet, frosty air before them. She tore away the
  mask.</p>

  <p>"And yours, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"Not here."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because there are people. Hurry. Now here, with just the trees around us
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>And he tore off his mask.</p>

  <p>The white, cold moon shone over them, slipping down between the dark tops
  of the trees, and the wind stirred slowly through the branches with a faint,
  hushing sound, as if once more a warning were coming to Pierre this night. He
  looked up, his left hand at the cross.</p>

  <p>"Look down. You are afraid of something, Pierre. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"With your arms around my neck, there's nothing in the world I fear. I
  never dreamed I could love anything more than the little girl who lay in the
  snow, and died there that night."</p>

  <p>"And I never dreamed I could smile at any man except the boy who lay by me
  that night. And he died."</p>

  <p>"What miracle saved you?"</p>

  <p>She said: "It was wonderful, and yet very simple. You remember how the
  tree crushed me down into the snow? Well, when the landslide moved, it
  carried the tree before it; the weight of the trunk was lifted from me.
  Perhaps it was a rock that struck me over the head then, for I lost
  consciousness. The slide didn't bury me, but the rush carried me before it
  like a stick before a wave, you see.</p>

  <p>"When I woke I was almost completely covered with a blanket of debris, but
  I could move my arms, and managed to prop myself up in a sitting posture. It
  was there that my father and his searching party found me; he had been
  combing that district all night. They carried me back, terribly bruised, but
  without even a bone broken. It was a miracle that I escaped, and the miracle
  must have been worked by your cross; do you remember?"</p>

  <p>He shuddered. "The cross&mdash;for every good fortune it has brought me,
  it has brought bad luck to others. I'll throw it away, now&mdash;and then
  &mdash;no, it makes no difference. We are done for."</p>

  <p>"Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see, Mary, or are you still blind as I was ever since I saw you
  tonight? It's all in that name&mdash;Pierre."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in it, Pierre, that I don't love."</p>

  <p>His head was bowed as if with the weight of the words which he foresaw.
  "You have heard of the wild men of the mountains, and the long-riders?"</p>

  <p>He knew that she nodded, though she could not speak.</p>

  <p>"I am Red Pierre."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Yet he had the courage to raise his head and watch her shrink with horror.
  It was only an instant. Then she was beside him again, and one arm around
  him, while she turned her head and glanced fearfully back at the lighted
  schoolhouse. The faint music mocked them.</p>

  <p>"And you dared to come to the dance? We must go. Look, there are horses!
  We'll ride off into the mountains, and they'll never find us&mdash;we'll
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush! One day's riding would kill you&mdash;riding as I ride."</p>

  <p>"I'm strong&mdash;very strong, and the love of you, Pierre, will give me
  more strength. But quickly, for if they knew you, every man in that place
  would come armed and ready to kill. I know, for I've heard them talk. Tell
  me, are one-half of all the terrible things they say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They are true, I guess."</p>

  <p>"I won't think of them. Whatever you've done, it was not you, but some
  devil that forced you on. Pierre, I love you more than ever. Will you go East
  with me, and home? We will lose ourselves in New York. The millions of the
  crowd will hide us."</p>

  <p>"Mary, there are some men from whom even the night can't hide me. If they
  were blind their hate would give them eyes to find me."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, you are not turning away from me&mdash;Pierre&mdash;There's some
  ghost of a chance for us. Will you take that chance and come with me?"</p>

  <p>He thought of many things, but what he answered was: "I will." "Then let's
  go at once. The railroad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not that way. No one in that house suspects me now. We'll go back and put
  on our masks again, and&mdash;hush. What's there?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"There is&mdash;a man's step."</p>

  <p>And she, seeing the look on his face, covered her eyes in horror. When she
  looked up a great form was looming through the dark, and then the voice of
  Wilbur came, hard and cold.</p>

  <p>"I've looked everywhere for you. Miss Brown, they are anxious about you in
  the schoolhouse. Will you go back?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Pierre commanded: "Go back."</p>

  <p>So she turned, and he ordered again: "I think our friend has something to
  say to me. You can find your way easily. Tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I shall be waiting."</p>

  <p>With what a voice she said it! And then she was gone.</p>

  <p>He turned quietly to big Dick Wilbur, on whose contorted face the
  moonlight fell.</p>

  <p>"Say it, Dick, and have it out in cursing me, if that'll help."</p>

  <p>The big man stood with his hands gripped behind, fighting for self-
  control.</p>

  <p>"Pierre, I've cared for you more than I've cared for any other man. I've
  thought of you like a kid brother. Now tell me that you haven't done this
  thing, and I'll believe you rather than my senses. Tell me you haven't stolen
  the girl I love away from me; tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I love her, Dick."</p>

  <p>"Damn you! And she?"</p>

  <p>"She'll forget me; God knows I hope she'll forget me." "I brought two guns
  with me. Here they are."</p>

  <p>He held out the weapons.</p>

  <p>"Take your choice."</p>

  <p>"Does it have to be this way?"</p>

  <p>"If you'd rather have me shoot you down in cold blood?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose this is as good a way as any."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Give me a gun."</p>

  <p>"Here. This is ten paces. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Pierre. God forgive you for what you've done. She liked me, I know. If it
  weren't for you, I would have won her and a chance for real life again
  &mdash;but now&mdash;damn you!"</p>

  <p>"I'll count to ten, slowly and evenly. When I reach ten we fire?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'll trust you not to beat the count, Dick."</p>

  <p>"And I you. Start."</p>

  <p>He counted quietly, evenly: "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
  eight, nine&mdash;ten!"</p>

  <p>The gun jerked up in the hand of Wilbur, but he stayed the movement with
  his finger pressing still upon the trigger. The hand of Pierre had not
  moved.</p>

  <p>He cried: "By God, Pierre, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He strode across the intervening space, dropped his
  gun and caught the other by the shoulders. Out of Pierre's nerveless fingers
  the revolver slipped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"In the name of God, Pierre, what has happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"Dick, why didn't you fire?"</p>

  <p>"Fire? Murder you?"</p>

  <p>"You shoot straight&mdash;I know&mdash;it would have been over
  quickly."</p>

  <p>"What is it, boy? You look dead&mdash;there's no color in your face, no
  light in your eyes, even your voice is dead. I know it isn't fear. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong. It's fear."</p>

  <p>"Fear and Red Pierre. The two don't mate."</p>

  <p>"Fear of living, Dick."</p>

  <p>"So that's it? God help you. Pierre, forgive me. I should have known that
  you had met her before, but I was mad, and didn't know what I was doing,
  couldn't think."</p>

  <p>"It's over and forgotten. I have to go back and get Jack. Will you ride
  home with us?"</p>

  <p>"Jack? She's not in the hall. She left shortly after you went, and she
  means some deviltry. There's a jealous fiend in that girl. I watched her eyes
  when they followed you and Mary from the hall."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll ride back alone."</p>

  <p>"Not I. Carry the word to Jim that I'm through with the game. I'm going to
  wash some of the grime off my conscience and try to make myself fit to speak
  to this girl again."</p>

  <p>"It's the cross," said Pierre.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. The bad luck has come to poor old Jim at last, because he saved
  me out of the snow. Patterson has gone, and now you, and perhaps Jack&mdash;
  well, this is good-bye, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Their hands met.</p>

  <p>"You forgive me, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"With all my heart, old fellow."</p>

  <p>"I'll try to wish you luck. Stay close to her. Perhaps you'll win
  her."</p>

  <p>"I'll do what one man can."</p>

  <p>"But if you succeed, ride out of the mountain-desert with her&mdash; never
  let me hear of it."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand. Will you tell me what's between you, Pierre? You've
  some sort of claim on her. What is it?" "I've said good-bye. Only one thing
  more. Never mention my name to her."</p>

  <p>So he turned and walked out into the moonlight and Wilbur stared after him
  until he disappeared beyond the shoulder of a hill.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>CHAPTER 23</h2>

  <p class="first">It was early morning before Pierre reached the refuge of
  Boone's gang, but there was still a light through the window of the large
  room, and he entered to find Boone, Mansie, and Gandil grouped about the
  fire, all ominously silent, all ominously wakeful. They looked up to him and
  big Jim nodded his gray head. Otherwise there was no greeting.</p>

  <p>From a shadowy corner Jacqueline rose and went toward the door. He crossed
  quickly and barred the way.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way."</p>

  <p>"Not till you tell me what's wrong."</p>

  <p>A veritable devil of fury came blazing in her eyes, and her hand twitched
  nervously back to her hip where the dark holster hung. She said in a voice
  that shook with anger: "Don't try your bluff on me. I ain't no shorthorn,
  Pierre le Rouge."</p>

  <p>He stepped aside, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow I'll argue the point with you, Jack." She turned at the door and
  snapped back: "You? You ain't fast enough on the draw to argue with me!"</p>

  <p>And she was gone. He turned to face the mocking smile of Black Gandil and
  a rapid volley of questions.</p>

  <p>"Where's Patterson?"</p>

  <p>"No more idea than you have."</p>

  <p>"And Branch?"</p>

  <p>"What's become of Branch? Hasn't he returned?"</p>

  <p>"No. And Dick Wilbur?"</p>

  <p>"Boys, he's done with this life and I'm glad of it. He's starting on a new
  track."</p>

  <p>"After a woman?" sneered Bud Mansie.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Bud," broke in Boone, and then slowly to Pierre:</p>

  <p>"Patterson is gone for two days now. You ought to know what that means.
  Branch ought to have returned from looking for him, and Branch is still out.
  Wilbur is gone. Out of seven we're only four left. Who's next?"</p>

  <p>He stared gloomily from face to face, and Gandil snarled: "A fellow who
  saves a shipwrecked man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, keep still, Gandil."</p>

  <p>"Don't damn me, Pierre le Rouge, but damn the luck you've brought to Jim
  Boone."</p>

  <p>"Jim, do you chalk all this up against me?"</p>

  <p>"I, lad? No, no! But it's queer. Patterson's done for; there's no doubt of
  that. Good-natured Garry Patterson. God, boy, how we'll miss him! And Branch
  seems to have gone the same way. If neither of them show up before morning we
  can cross 'em off the list. Now Wilbur has gone and Jack has ridden home
  looking like a small-sized thunderstorm, and now you come with a white face
  and a blank eye. What hell is trailin' us, Pierre, what hell is in store for
  us. You've seen something, and we want to know what it is."</p>

  <p>"A ghost, Jim, that's all."</p>

  <p>Bud Mansie said softly: "There's only one ghost that could make you look
  like this. Was it McGurk, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>Boone commanded: "No more of that, Bud. Boys, we're going to turn in, and
  tomorrow we'll climb the hills looking for the two we've lost. But there's
  something or someone after us. Lads, I'm thinking our good days are over. The
  seven of us have been too many for a small posse and too fast for a big one,
  but the seven are down to four. The good days are over."</p>

  <p>And the three answered in a solemn chorus: "The good days are over."</p>

  <p>All eyes fixed on Pierre, and his glance was settled on the floor.</p>

  <p>The morning brought them no better cheer, for Jack, whose singing
  generally wakened them, was not to be coaxed into speech, and when Pierre
  entered the room she rose and left the breakfast table. The sad eyes of Jim
  Boone followed her and then turned to Pierre. No explanation was forthcoming,
  and he asked for none. The old fatalist had accepted the worst, and now he
  waited for doom to descend.</p>

  <p>They took their horses after breakfast and rode out to search the hills,
  for it was quite possible that an accident had crippled at least one of the
  two lost men, either Patterson or Branch. Not a gully within miles was left
  unsearched, but toward evening they rode back, one by one, with no
  tidings.</p>

  <p>One by one they rode up, and whistled to announce their coming, and then
  rode on to the stable to unsaddle their horses. About the supper table all
  gathered with the exception of Bud Mansie. So they waited the meal and each
  from time to time stole a glance at the fifth plate where Bud should sit.</p>

  <p>It was Jack who finally stirred herself from her dumb gloom to take up
  that fifth and carry it out of the room. It was as if she had announced the
  death of Mansie.</p>

  <p>After that, they ate what they could and then went back around the fire.
  The evening waned, but it brought no sign of any of the missing three. The
  wood burned low in the fire. The first to break the long silence was Jim
  Boone, with "Who brings in the wood?"</p>

  <p>And Black Gandil answered: "We'll match, eh?"</p>

  <p>In an outburst of energy the day before he disappeared Garry Patterson had
  chopped up some wood and left a pile of it at the corner of the house. It was
  a very little thing to bring in an armful of that wood, but long-riders do
  not love work, and now they started the matching seriously. The odd man was
  out, and Pierre went out on the first toss of the coins.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Gandil. "Bad luck to everyone but himself."</p>

  <p>At the next throw Jacqueline was the lucky one, and her father afterward.
  Gandil rose and stretched himself leisurely, yet as he sauntered toward the
  door his backward glance at Pierre was black indeed. He glanced curiously
  toward Jack&mdash;who looked away sharply&mdash;and then turned his eyes to
  her father.</p>

  <p>The latter was considering him with a gloomy, foreboding stare and
  considering over and over again, as Pierre le Rouge well knew, the prophecy
  of Black Morgan Gandil.</p>

  <p>He fell in turn into a solemn brooding, and many a picture out of the past
  came up beside him and stood near till he could almost feel its presence. He
  was roused by the creaking of the floor beneath the ponderous step of Jim
  Boone, who flung the door open and shouted: "Oh, Morgan."</p>

  <p>In the silence he turned and stared back at Pierre.</p>

  <p>"What's up with Gandil?"</p>

  <p>"God knows, not I."</p>

  <p>Pierre rose and ran from the room and around the side of the building.
  There by the woodpile lay the prostrate body. It was a mere limp weight when
  he turned and raised it in his arms. So he walked back into the house
  carrying all that was left of Black Morgan Gandil, and placed his burden on a
  bunk at the side of the room.</p>

  <p>There had been no outcry from either Jim Boone or his daughter, but they
  came quickly to him, and Jacqueline pressed her ear over the heart of the
  hurt man.</p>

  <p>She said: "He's still alive, but nearly gone. Where's the wound?"</p>

  <p>They found it when they drew off his coat&mdash;a small cut high on the
  right breast, and another lower and more to the left. Either of them would
  have been fatal, and about each the flesh was discolored where the hilt of
  the knife or the fist of the striker had driven home the blade.</p>

  <p>They stood back and made no hopeless effort to save him. It was uncanny
  that Black Morgan Gandil, after all of his battles, should die without a
  struggle in this way. And it had been no cowardly attack from the rear. Both
  wounds were in the front. A hope came to them when his color increased at one
  time, but it was for only a moment; it went out again as if someone were
  erasing paint from his cheeks.</p>

  <p>But just as they were about to turn away his body stirred with a slight
  convulsion, the eyes opened wide, and he strove to speak. A red froth came on
  his lips. He made another desperate effort, and twisting himself onto one
  elbow pointed a rigid arm at Pierre. He gasped: "McGurk&mdash;God!" and
  dropped. He was dead before his head touched the blanket.</p>

  <p>It was Jacqueline who closed the staring eyes, for the two men were frozen
  where they stood. They had heard the story of Patterson and Branch and Mansie
  in one word from the lips of the dying man.</p>

  <p>McGurk was back. McGurk was prowling about the last of the gang of Boone,
  and the lone wolf had pulled down four of the band one by one on successive
  days. Only two remained, and these two looked at one another with a common
  thought.</p>

  <p>"The lights!" cried Jacqueline, turning from the body of Gandil. "He can
  shoot us down through the windows at his leisure."</p>

  <p>"But he won't," said her father. "I've lived too long with the name of
  McGurk in my ears not to know the man. He'll never kill by stealth, but
  openly and man to man. I know him, damn him. He'll wait till he meets us
  alone, and then we'll finish as poor Gandil, there, or Patterson and Branch
  and Bud Mansie, all of them fallen somewhere in the mountains with the
  buzzards left to bury 'em. That's how we'll finish with McGurk on our trail.
  And you&mdash; Gandil was right&mdash;it's you that's brought him on us. A
  shipwrecked man &mdash;by God, Gandil was right!"</p>

  <p>His right hand froze on the butt of his gun and his face convulsed with
  impotent rage, for he knew, as both the others knew, that long before that
  gun was clear of the holster the bullet from Pierre's gun would be on its
  way. But Pierre threw his arms wide, and standing so, his shadow made a black
  cross on the wall behind him. He even smiled to tempt the big man
  further.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25"></a>CHAPTER 24</h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline ran between and caught the hand of her father,
  crying:</p>

  <p>"Are you going to finish the work of McGurk before he has a chance to
  start it? He hunted the rest down one by one. Dad, if you put out Pierre what
  is left? Can you face that devil alone?"</p>

  <p>And the old man groaned: "But it's his luck that's ruined me. It's his
  damned luck which has broken up the finest fellowship that ever mocked at law
  on the ranges. Oh, Jack, the heart in me's broken. I wish to God that I lay
  where Gandil lies. What's the use of fighting any longer? No man can stand up
  against McGurk!"</p>

  <p>And the cold which had come in the blood of Pierre agreed with him. He was
  a slayer of men, but McGurk was a devil incarnate. His father had died at the
  hand of this lone rider; it was fitting, it was fate that he himself should
  die in the same way. The girl looked from face to face, and sensed their
  despondency. It seemed that their fear gave her the greater courage. Her face
  flushed as she stood glaring her scorn.</p>

  <p>"The yellow streak took a long time in showin', but it's in you, all
  right, Pierre le Rouge."</p>

  <p>"You've hated me ever since the dance, Jack. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I knew you were yellow&mdash;like this!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders like one who gives up the fight against a woman,
  and seeing it, she changed suddenly and made a gesture with both hands toward
  him, a sudden gesture filled with grace and a queer tenderness.</p>

  <p>She said: "Pierre, have you forgotten that when you were only a boy you
  stood up to McGurk and drew blood from him? Are you afraid of him now?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take my chance with any man&mdash;but McGurk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He has no cross to bring him luck."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and he has no friends for that luck to ruin. Look at Gandil, Jack,
  and then speak to me of the cross."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, that first time you met you almost beat him to the draw. Oh, if I
  were a man, I'd&mdash;Pierre, it was to get McGurk that you rode out to the
  range. You've been here six years, and McGurk is still alive, and now you're
  ready to run from his shadow."</p>

  <p>"Run?" he said hotly. "I swear to God that as I stand here I've no fear of
  death and no hope for the life ahead."</p>

  <p>She sneered: "You're white while you say it. Your will may be brave, but
  your blood's a coward, Pierre. It deserts you."</p>

  <p>"Jack, you devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye, you can threaten me safely. But if McGurk were here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let him come."</p>

  <p>"Then give me one promise."</p>

  <p>"A thousand of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Let me hunt him with you."</p>

  <p>He stared at her with wonder.</p>

  <p>"Jack, what a heart you have! If you were a man we could rule the
  mountains, you and I."</p>

  <p>"Even as I am, what prevents us, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>And looking at her he forgot the sorrow which had been his ever since he
  looked up to the face framed with red-gold hair and the dark tree behind and
  the cold stars steady above it. It would come to him again, but now it was
  gone, and he murmured, smiling: "I wonder?"</p>

  <p>They made their plans that night, sitting all three together. It was
  better to go out and hunt the hunter than to wait there and be tracked down.
  Jack, for she insisted on it, would ride out with Pierre the next morning and
  hunt through the hills for the hiding-place of McGurk.</p>

  <p>Some covert he must have, so as to be near his victims. Nothing else could
  explain the ease with which he kept on their track. They would take the
  trail, and Jim Boone, no longer agile enough to be effective on the trail,
  would guard the house and the body of Gandil in it.</p>

  <p>There was little danger that even McGurk would try to rush a hostile
  house, but they took no chances. The guns of Jim Boone were given a thorough
  overhauling, and he wore as usual at his belt the heavy-handled hunting
  knife, a deadly weapon in a hand-to-hand fight. Thus equipped, they left him
  and took the trail.</p>

  <p>They had not ridden a hundred yards when a whistle followed them, the
  familiar whistle of the gang. They reined short and saw big Dick Wilbur
  riding his bay after them, but at some distance he halted and shouted:
  "Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"He's come back to us!" cried Jack.</p>

  <p>"No. It's only some message."</p>

  <p>"Do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Stay here. This is for me alone."</p>

  <p>And he rode back to Wilbur, who swung his horse close alongside. However
  hard he had followed in the pursuit of happiness, his face was drawn with
  lines of age and his eyes circled with shadows.</p>

  <p>He said: "I've kept close on her trail, Pierre, and the nearest she has
  come to kindness has been to send me back with a message to you."</p>

  <p>He laughed without mirth, and the sound stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"This is the message in her own words: 'I love him, Dick, and there's
  nothing in the world for me without him. Bring him back to me. I don't care
  how; but bring him back.' So tell Jack to ride the trail alone today and go
  back with me. I give her up, not freely, but because I know there's no hope
  for me."</p>

  <p>But Pierre answered: "Wherever I've gone there's been luck for me and hell
  for everyone around me. I lived with a priest, Dick, and left him when I was
  nearly old enough to begin repaying his care. I came South and found a father
  and lost him the same day. I gambled for money with which to bury him, and a
  man died that night and another was hurt. I escaped from the town by riding a
  horse to death. I was nearly killed in a landslide, and now the men who saved
  me from that are done for.</p>

  <p>"It's all one story, the same over and over. Can I carry a fortune like
  that back to her? Dick, it would haunt me by day and by night. She would be
  the next. I know it as I know that I'm sitting in the saddle here. That's my
  answer. Carry it back to her."</p>

  <p>"I won't lie and tell you I'm sorry, because I'm a fool and still have a
  ghost of a hope, but this will be hard news to tell her, and I'd rather give
  five years of life than face the look that will come in her eyes."</p>

  <p>"I know it, Dick."</p>

  <p>"But this is final?"</p>

  <p>"It is."</p>

  <p>"Then good-bye again, and&mdash;God bless you, Pierre."</p>

  <p>"And you, old fellow."</p>

  <p>They swerved their horses in opposite directions and galloped apart.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," said Pierre to Jack, when he came up with her and drew
  his horse down to a trot. But he knew that she had read his mind.</p>

  <p>But all day through the mazes of canyon and hill and rolling ground they
  searched patiently. There was no cranny in the rocks too small for them to
  reconnoiter with caution. There was no group of trees they did not
  examine.</p>

  <p>Yet it was not strange that they failed. In the space of every square mile
  there were a hundred hiding-places which might have served McGurk. It would
  have taken a month to comb the country. They had only a day, and left the
  result to chance, but chance failed them. When the shadows commenced to swing
  across the gullies they turned back and rode with downward heads, silent.</p>

  <p>One hill lay between them and the old ranch house which had been the
  headquarters for their gang so many days, when they saw a faint drift of
  smoke across the sky&mdash;not a thin column of smoke such as rises from a
  chimney, but a broad stream of pale mist, as if a dozen chimneys were
  spouting wood smoke at once.</p>

  <p>They exchanged glances and spurred their horses up the last slope. As
  always in a short spurt, the long-legged black of Jacqueline out-distanced
  the cream-colored mare, and it was she who first topped the rise of land. The
  girl whirled in her saddle with raised arm, screamed back at Pierre, and rode
  on at a still more furious pace.</p>

  <p>What he saw when he reached a corresponding position was the ranch house
  wreathed in smoke, and through all the lower windows was the red dance of
  flames. Before him fled Jacqueline with all the speed of the black. He
  loosened the reins, spoke to the mare, and she responded with a mighty rush.
  Even that tearing pace could not quite take him up to the girl, but he flung
  himself from the saddle and was at her side when she ran across the smoking
  veranda and wrenched at the front door.</p>

  <p>The whole frame gave back at her, and as Pierre snatched her to one side
  the doorway fell crashing on the porch, while a mighty volume of smoke burst
  out at them like a puff from the pit.</p>

  <p>They stood sputtering, coughing, and choking, and when they could look
  again they saw a solid wall of red flame, thick, impenetrable, shuddering
  with the breath of the wind.</p>

  <p>While they stared a stronger breath of that wind tore the wall of flames
  apart, driving it back in a raging tide to either side. The fire had circled
  the walls of the entire room, but it had scarcely encroached on the center,
  and there, seated at the table, was Boone.</p>

  <p>He had scarcely changed from the position in which they last saw him, save
  that he was fallen somewhat deeper in the chair, his head resting against the
  top of the back. He greeted them, through that infernal furnace, with
  laughter, and wide, steady eyes. At least it seemed laughter, for the mouth
  was agape and the lips grinned back, but there was no sound from the lips and
  no light in the fixed eyes. Laughter indeed it was, but it was the laughter
  of death, as if the soul of the man, in dying, recognized its natural wild
  element and had burst into convulsive mirth. So he sat there, untouched as
  yet by the wide river of fire, chuckling at his destiny. The wall of fire
  closed across the doorway again and the work of red ruin went on with a
  crashing of timbers from the upper part of the building.</p>

  <p>As that living wall shut solidly, Jacqueline leaped forward, shouting,
  like a man, words of hope and rescue; Pierre caught her barely in time&mdash;
  a precarious grasp on the wrist from which she nearly wrenched herself free
  and gained the entrance to the fire. But the jerk threw her off balance for
  the least fraction of an instant, and the next moment she was safe in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>Safe? He might as well have held a wildcat, or captured with his bare
  hands a wild eagle, strong of talon and beak. She tore and raged in a wild
  fury.</p>

  <p>"Pierre, coward, devil!"</p>

  <p>"Steady, Jack!"</p>

  <p>"Are you going to let him die?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? He's already dead."</p>

  <p>"You lie. You only fear the fire!"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, McGurk has been here before us."</p>

  <p>Her arm was freed by a twisting effort and she beat him furiously across
  the face. One blow cut his lip and a steady trickle of hot blood left a taste
  of salt in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"You young fiend!" he cried, and grasped both her wrists with a crushing
  force.</p>

  <p>She leaned and gnashed at his hands, but he whirled her about and held her
  from behind, impotent, raging still.</p>

  <p>"A hundred McGurks could never have killed him!"</p>

  <p>There was a sharp explosion from the midst of the fire.</p>

  <p>"See! He's fighting against his death!"</p>

  <p>"No! No! It's only the falling of a timber!"</p>

  <p>Yet with a panic at his heart he knew that it was the sharp crack of a
  firearm. "Liar again! Pierre, for God's sake, do something for him. Father!
  He's fighting for his life!"</p>

  <p>Another and another explosion from the midst of the fire. He understood
  then.</p>

  <p>"The flames have reached his guns. That's all, Jack. Don't you see? We'd
  be throwing ourselves away to run into those flames."</p>

  <p>Realization came to her at last. A heavy weight slumped down suddenly over
  his arms. He held her easily, lightly. Her head had tilted back, and the red
  flare of the fire beat across her face and throat. The roar of the flames
  shut out all other thought of the world and cast a wide inferno of light
  around them.</p>

  <p>Higher and higher rose the fires, and the wind cut off great fragments and
  hurried them off into the night, blowing them, it seemed, straight up against
  the piled thunder of the clouds. Then the roof sagged, swayed, and fell
  crashing, while a vast cloud of sparks and livid fires shot up a hundred feet
  into the air. It was as if the soul of old Boone had departed in that final
  flare.</p>

  <p>It started the girl into sudden life, surprising Pierre, so that she
  managed to wrench herself free and ran from him. He sprang after her with a
  shout, fearing that in her hysteria she might fling herself into the fire,
  but that was not her purpose. Straight to the black horse she ran, swung into
  the saddle with the ease of a man, and rode furiously off through the falling
  of the night.</p>

  <p>He watched her with a curious closing of loneliness like a hand about his
  heart. He had failed, and because of that failure even Jacqueline was leaving
  him. It was strange, for since the loss of the girl of the yellow hair and
  those deep blue eyes, he had never dreamed that another thing in life could
  pain him.</p>

  <p>So at length he mounted the mare again and rode slowly down the hill and
  out toward the distant ranges, trotting mile after mile with downward head,
  not caring even if McGurk should cross him, for surely this was the final end
  of the world to Pierre le Rouge.</p>

  <p>About midnight he halted at last, for the uneasy sway of the mare showed
  that she was nearly dead on her feet with weariness. He found a convenient
  place for a camp, built his fire, and wrapped his blanket about him without
  thinking of food.</p>

  <p>He never knew how long he sat there, for his thoughts circled the world
  and back again and found all a prospect of desert before him and behind,
  until a sound, a vague sound out of the night, startled him into alertness.
  He slipped from beside the fire and into the shadow of a steep rock, watching
  with eyes that almost pierced the dark on all sides.</p>

  <p>And there he saw her creeping up on the outskirts of the firelight, prone
  on her hands and knees, dragging herself up like a young wildcat hunting
  prey; it was the glimmer of her eyes that he caught first through the gloom.
  A cold thought came to him that she had returned with her gun ready.</p>

  <p>Inch by inch she came closer, and now he was aware of her restless glances
  probing on all sides of the camp-fire. Silence&mdash;only the crackling of a
  pitchy stick. And then he heard a muffled sound, soft, soft as the beating of
  a heart in the night, and regularly pulsing. It hurt him infinitely, and he
  called gently: "Jack, why are you weeping?"</p>

  <p>She started up with her fingers twisted at the butt of her gun.</p>

  <p>"It's a lie," called a tremulous voice. "Why should I weep?"</p>

  <p>And then she ran to him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pierre, I thought you were gone!"</p>

  <p>That silence which came between them was thick with understanding greater
  than speech. He said at last: "I've made my plan. I am going straight for the
  higher mountains and try to shake McGurk off my trail. There's one chance in
  ten I may succeed, and if I do then I'll wait for my chance and come down on
  him, for sooner or later we have to fight this out to the end."</p>

  <p>"I know a place he could never find," said Jacqueline. "The old cabin in
  the gulley between the Twin Bears. We'll start for it tonight."</p>

  <p>"Not we," he answered. "Jack, here's the end of our riding together."</p>

  <p>She frowned with puzzled wonder.</p>

  <p>He explained: "One man is stronger than a dozen. That's the strength of
  McGurk&mdash;that he rides alone. He's finished your father's men. There's
  only Wilbur left, and Wilbur will go next&mdash;then me!"</p>

  <p>She stretched her hands to him. She seemed to be pleading for her very
  life.</p>

  <p>"But if he finds us and has to fight us both&mdash;I shoot as straight as
  a man, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"Straighter than most. And you're a better pal than any I've ever ridden
  with. But I must go alone. It's only a lone wolf that will ever bring down
  McGurk. Think how he's rounded us up like a herd of cattle and brought us
  down one by one."</p>

  <p>"By getting each man alone and killing him from behind."</p>

  <p>"From the front, Jack. No, he's fought square with each one. The wounds of
  Black Gandil were all in front, and when McGurk and I meet it's going to be
  face to face."</p>

  <p>Her tone changed, softened: "But what of me, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"You have to leave this life. Go down to the city, Jack. Live like a
  woman; marry some lucky fellow; be happy."</p>

  <p>"Can you leave me so easily?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's hard, devilish hard to part with a pal like you, Jack; but all
  the rest of my life I've got hard things to face, partner."</p>

  <p>"Partner!" she repeated with an indescribable emphasis. "Pierre, I can't
  leave you."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid to go: Let me stay!"</p>

  <p>He said gloomily: "No good will come of it."</p>

  <p>"I'll never trouble you&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>"No, the bad luck comes on the people who are with me, but never on me.
  It's struck them all down, one by one; your turn is next, Jack. If I could
  leave the cross behind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He covered his face and groaned: "But I don't dare; I don't dare! I have
  to face McGurk. Jack, I hate myself for it, but I can't help it. I'm afraid
  of McGurk, afraid of that damned white face, that lowered, fluttering eyelid,
  that sneering mouth. Without the cross to bring me luck, how could I meet
  him? But while I keep the cross there's ruin and hell without end for
  everyone with me."</p>

  <p>She was white and shaking. She said: "I'm not afraid. I've one friend
  left; there's nothing else to care for."</p>

  <p>"So it's to be this way, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"This way, and no other."</p>

  <p>"Partner, I'm glad. My God, Jack, what a man you would have made!"</p>

  <p>Their hands met and clung together, and her head had drooped, perhaps in
  acquiescence.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>CHAPTER 25</h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Wilbur, telling Mary how Pierre had cut himself adrift,
  did not even pretend to sorrow, and she listened to him with her eyes fixed
  steadily on his own. As a matter of fact, she had shown neither hope nor
  excitement from the moment he came back to her and started to tell his
  message. But if she showed neither hope nor excitement for herself, surely
  she gave Dick still fewer grounds for any optimistic foresights.</p>

  <p>So he finished gloomily: "And as far as I can make out, Pierre is right.
  There's some rotten bad luck that follows him. It may not be the cross&mdash;
  I don't suppose you believe in superstition like that, Miss Brown?"</p>

  <p>She said: "It saved my life."</p>

  <p>"The cross?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then Pierre&mdash;you mean&mdash;you met before the dance&mdash; you
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was stammering so that he couldn't finish his thoughts, and she broke
  in: "If he will not come to me, then I must go to him."</p>

  <p>"Follow Pierre le Rouge?" queried Wilbur. "You're an optimist. But that's
  because you've never seen him ride. I consider it a good day's work to start
  out with him and keep within sight till night, but as for following and over-
  taking him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He laughed heartily at the thought.</p>

  <p>And she smiled a little sadly, answering: "But I have the most boundless
  patience in the world. He may gallop all the way, but I will walk, and keep
  on walking, and reach him in the end."</p>

  <p>Her hands moved out as though testing their power, gripping at the
  air.</p>

  <p>"Where will you go to hunt for him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But every evening, when I look out at the sunset hills,
  with the purple along the valleys, I think that he must be out there
  somewhere, going toward the highest ranges. If I were up in that country I
  know that I could find him." "Never in a thousand years."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's on the trail&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the trail?"</p>

  <p>"Of McGurk."</p>

  <p>She started.</p>

  <p>"What is this man McGurk? I hear of him on all sides. If one of the men
  rides a bucking horse successfully, someone is sure to say: 'Who taught you
  what you know, Bud&mdash;McGurk?' And then the rest laugh. The other day a
  man was pointed out to me as an expert shot. 'Not as fast as McGurk,' it was
  said, 'but he shoots just as straight.' Finally I asked someone about McGurk.
  The only answer I received was: 'I hope you never find out what he is.' Tell
  me, what is McGurk?"</p>

  <p>Wilbur considered the question gravely.</p>

  <p>He said at last: "McGurk is&mdash;hell!"</p>

  <p>He expanded his statement: "Think of a man who can ride anything that
  walks on four feet, who never misses with either a rifle or a revolver, who
  doesn't know the meaning of fear, and then imagine that man living by himself
  and fighting the rest of the world like a lone wolf. That's McGurk. He's
  never had a companion; he's never trusted any man. Perhaps that's why they
  say about him the same thing that they say about me."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"You will smile when you hear. They say that McGurk will lose out in the
  end on account of some woman."</p>

  <p>"And they say that of you?"</p>

  <p>"They say right of me. I know it myself. Look at me now. What right have I
  here? If I'm found I'm the meat of the first man who sights me, but here I
  stay, and wait and watch for your smiles&mdash;like a love-sick boy. By God,
  you must despise me, Mary!"</p>

  <p>"I don't try to understand you Westerners," she answered, "and that's why
  I have never questioned you before. Tell me, why is it that you come so
  stealthily to see me and run away as soon as anyone else appears?"</p>

  <p>He said with wonder: "Haven't you guessed?"</p>

  <p>"I don't dare guess."</p>

  <p>"But you have, and your guess was right. There's a price on my head. By
  right, I should be out there on the ranges with Pierre le Rouge and McGurk.
  There's the only safe place; but I saw you and I came down out of the wilds
  and can't go back. I'll stay, I suppose, till I run my head into a
  halter."</p>

  <p>She was too much moved to speak for a moment, and then: "You come to me in
  spite of that? Dick, whatever you have done, I know that it's only chance
  which made you go wrong, just as it made Pierre. I wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The dimness of her eyes encouraged him with a hope. He moved closer to
  her.</p>

  <p>He repeated: "You wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you could be satisfied with a mere friendship. I could give you
  that, Dick, with all my heart."</p>

  <p>He stepped back and smiled somewhat grimly on her.</p>

  <p>She went on: "And this McGurk&mdash;what do you mean when you say that
  Pierre is on his trail?"</p>

  <p>"Hunting him with a gun."</p>

  <p>She grew paler, but her voice remained steady.</p>

  <p>"But in all those miles of mountains they may never meet?"</p>

  <p>"They can't stay apart any more than iron can stay away from a magnet.
  Listen: half a dozen years ago McGurk had the reputation of bearing a charmed
  life. He had been in a hundred fights and he was never touched with either a
  knife or a bullet. Then he crossed Pierre le Rouge when Pierre was only a
  youngster just come onto the range. He put two bullets through Pierre, but
  the boy shot him from the floor and wounded him for the first time. The charm
  of McGurk was broken.</p>

  <p>"For half a dozen years McGurk was gone; there was never a whisper about
  him. Then he came back and went on the trail of Pierre. He has killed the
  friends of Pierre one by one; Pierre himself is the next in order&mdash;
  Pierre or myself. And when those two meet there will be the greatest fight
  that was ever staged in the mountain-desert."</p>

  <p>She stood straight, staring past Wilbur with hungry eyes.</p>

  <p>"I knew he needed me. I have to save him, Dick. You see that? I have to
  bring him down from the mountains and keep him safe from McGurk. McGurk!
  Somehow the sound means what 'devil' used to mean to me."</p>

  <p>"You've never traveled alone, and yet you'd go up there and brave
  everything that comes for the sake of Pierre? What has he done to deserve it,
  Mary?".</p>

  <p>"What have I done, Dick, to deserve the care you have for me?"</p>

  <p>He stared gloomily on her.</p>

  <p>"When do you start?"</p>

  <p>"Tonight."</p>

  <p>"Your friends won't let you go."</p>

  <p>"I'll steal away and leave a note behind me."</p>

  <p>"And you'll go alone?"</p>

  <p>She caught at a hope.</p>

  <p>"Unless you'll go with me, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"I? Take you&mdash;to Pierre?"</p>

  <p>She did not speak to urge him, but in the silence her beauty pleaded for
  her.</p>

  <p>He said: "Mary, how lovely you are. If I go I will have you for a few
  days&mdash;for a week at most, all to myself."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. From the window behind her the sunset light flared in
  her hair, flooding it with red-gold.</p>

  <p>"All the time that we are gone, you will never say things like this,
  Dick?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose not. I should be near you, but terribly far away from your
  thoughts all the while. Still, you will be near. You will be very beautiful,
  Mary, riding up the trail through the pines, with all the scents of the
  evergreens blowing about you, and I&mdash;well, I must go back to a second
  childhood and play a game of suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A game of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of supposing that you are really mine, Mary, and riding out into the
  wilderness for my sake."</p>

  <p>She stepped a little closer, peering into his face.</p>

  <p>"No matter what you suppose, I'm sure you'll leave that part of it merely
  a game, Dick!"</p>

  <p>He laughed suddenly, though the sound broke off as short and sharp as it
  began.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I played a game all my life with the fair ladies? And have I
  anything to show for it except laughter? I'll go with you, Mary, if you'll
  let me."</p>

  <p>"Dick, you've a heart of gold! What shall I take?"</p>

  <p>"I'll make the pack up, and I'll be back here an hour after dark and
  whistle. Like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And he gave the call of Boone's gang.</p>

  <p>"I understand. I'll be ready. Hurry, Dick, for we've very little
  time."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, then: "All the time we're on the trail you must be far from
  me, and at the end of it will be Pierre le Rouge&mdash;and happiness for you.
  Before we start, Mary, I'd like to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It seemed that she read his mind, for she slipped suddenly inside his
  arms, kissed him, and was gone from the room. He stood a moment with a hand
  raised to his face.</p>

  <p>"After all," he muttered, "that's enough to die for, and&mdash;" He threw
  up his long arms in a gesture of resignation.</p>

  <p>"The will of God be done!" said Wilbur, and laughed again.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>CHAPTER 26</h2>

  <p class="first">She was ready, crouched close to the window of her room,
  when the signal came, but first she was not sure, because the sound was as
  faint as a memory. Moreover, it might have been a freakish whistling in the
  wind, which rose stronger and stronger. It had piled the thunder-clouds
  higher and higher, and now and again a heavy drop of rain tapped at her
  window like a thrown pebble.</p>

  <p>So she waited, and at last heard the whistle a second time, unmistakably
  clear. In a moment she was hurrying down to the stable, climbed into the
  saddle, and rode at a cautious trot out among the sand-hills.</p>

  <p>For a time she saw no one, and commenced to fear that the whole thing had
  been a gruesomely real, practical jest. So she stopped her horse and imitated
  the signal whistle as well as she could. It was repeated immediately behind
  her &mdash;almost in her ear, and she turned to make out the dark form of a
  tall horseman.</p>

  <p>"A bad night for the start," called Wilbur. "Do you want to wait till
  tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>She could not answer for a moment, the wind whipping against her face,
  while a big drop stung her lips.</p>

  <p>She said at length: "Would a night like this stop Pierre&mdash;or
  McGurk?"</p>

  <p>For answer she heard his laughter.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll start. I must never stop for weather."</p>

  <p>He rode up beside her.</p>

  <p>"This is the start of the finish."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" "Nothing. But somewhere on this ride, I've an idea a
  question will be answered for me."</p>

  <p>"What question?"</p>

  <p>Instead of replying he said: "You've got a slicker on?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then follow me. We'll gallop into the wind a while and get the horses
  warmed up. Afterward we'll take the valley of the Old Crow and follow it up
  to the crest of the range."</p>

  <p>His horse lunged out ahead of hers, and she followed, leaning far forward
  against a wind that kept her almost breathless. For several minutes they
  cantered steadily, and before the end of the gallop she was sitting straight
  up, her heart beating fast, a faint smile on her lips, and the blood running
  hot in her veins. For the battle was begun, she knew, by that first sharp
  gallop, and here at the start she felt confident of her strength. When she
  met Pierre she could force him to turn back with her.</p>

  <p>Wilbur checked his horse to a trot; they climbed a hill, and just as the
  rain broke on them with a rattling gust they swung into the valley of the Old
  Crow. Above them in the sky the thunder rode; the rain whipped against the
  rocks like the rattle of a thousand flying hoofs; and now and again the
  lightning flashed across the sky.</p>

  <p>Through that vast accompaniment they moved on in the night straight toward
  the heart of the mountains which sprang into sight with every flash of the
  lightning and seemed toppling almost above them, yet they were weary miles
  away, as she knew.</p>

  <p>By those same flashes she caught glimpses of the face of Wilbur. She
  hardly knew him. She had seen him always big, gentle, handsome, good-natured;
  now he was grown harder, with a stern set of the jaw, and a certain square
  outline of face. It had seemed impossible. Now she began to guess how the law
  could have placed a price upon his head. For he belonged out here with the
  night and the crash of the storm, with strong, lawless things about him. An
  awe grew in her, and she was filled half with dread and half with curiosity
  at the thought of facing him, as she must many a time, across the camp-fire.
  In a way, he was the ladder by which she climbed to an understanding of
  Pierre le Rouge, Red Pierre. For that Pierre, she knew, was to big Wilbur
  what Dick himself was to the great mass of law-abiding men. Accident had cut
  Wilbur adrift, but it was more than accident which started Pierre on the road
  to outlawry; it was the sheer love of dangerous chance, the glory in fighting
  other men. This was Pierre.</p>

  <p>What was the man for whom Pierre hunted? What was McGurk? Not even the
  description of Wilbur had proved very enlightening. Her thought of him was
  vague, nebulous, and taking many forms. Sometimes he was tall and dark and
  stern. Again he was short and heavy and somewhat deformed of body. But always
  he was everywhere in the night about her.</p>

  <p>All this she pondered as they began the ride up the valley, but as the
  long journey continued, and the hours and the miles rolled past them, a
  racking weariness possessed her and numbed her mind. She began to wish
  desperately for morning, but even morning might not bring an end to the ride.
  That would be at the will of the outlaw beside her. Finally, only one picture
  remained to her. It stabbed across the darkness of her mind&mdash;the red
  hair and the keen eyes of Pierre.</p>

  <p>The storm decreased as they went up the valley. Finally the wind fell off
  to a pleasant breeze, and the clouds of the rain broke in the center of the
  heavens and toppled west in great tumbling masses. In half an hour's time the
  sky was clear, and a cold moon looked down on the blue-black evergreens,
  shining faintly with the wet, and on the dead black of the mountains.</p>

  <p>For the first time in all that ride her companion spoke: "In an hour the
  gray will begin in the east. Suppose we camp here, eat, get a bit of sleep,
  and then start again?"</p>

  <p>As if she had waited for permission, fighting against her weariness, she
  now let down the bars of her will, and a tingling stupor swept over her body
  and broke in hot, numbing waves on her brain.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you say. I'm afraid I couldn't ride much further tonight."</p>

  <p>"Look up at me."</p>

  <p>She raised her head.</p>

  <p>"No; you're all in. But you've made a game ride. I never dreamed there was
  so much iron in you. We'll make our fire just inside the trees and carry
  water up from the river, eh?"</p>

  <p>A scanty growth of the evergreens walked over the hills and skirted along
  the valley, leaving a broad, sandy waste in the center where the river at
  times swelled with melted snow or sudden rains and rushed over the lower
  valley in a broad, muddy flood.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the forest he picketed the horses in a little open space
  carpeted with wet, dead grass. It took him some time to find dry wood. So he
  wrapped her in blankets and left her sitting on a saddle. As the chill left
  her body she began to grow delightfully drowsy, and vaguely she heard the
  crack of his hatchet. He had found a rotten stump and was tearing off the wet
  outer bark to get at the dry wood within.</p>

  <p>After that it was only a moment before a fire sputtered feebly and smoked
  at her feet. She watched it, only half conscious, in her utter weariness, and
  seeing dimly the hollow-eyed face of the man who stopped above the blaze. Now
  it grew quickly, and increased to a sharp-pointed pyramid of red flame. The
  bright sparks showered up, crackling and snapping, and when she followed
  their flight she saw the darkly nodding tops of the evergreens above her.
  With the fire well under way, he took the coffeepot to get water from the
  river, and left her to fry the bacon. The fumes of the frying meat wakened
  her at once, and brushed even the thought of her exhaustion from her mind.
  She was hungry &mdash;ravenously hungry.</p>

  <p>So she tended the bacon slices with care until they grew brown and crisped
  and curled at the edges. After that she removed the pan from the fire, and it
  was not until then that she began to wonder why Wilbur was so long in
  returning with the water. The bacon grew cold; she heated it again and was
  mightily tempted to taste one piece of it, but restrained herself to wait for
  Dick.</p>

  <p>Still he did not come. She stood up and called, her high voice rising
  sharp and small through the trees. It seemed that some sound answered, so she
  smiled and sat down. Ten minutes passed and he was still gone. A cold alarm
  swept over her at that. She dropped the pan and ran out from the trees.</p>

  <p>Everywhere was the bright moonlight&mdash;over the wet rocks, and sand,
  and glimmering on the slow tide of the river, but nowhere could she see
  Wilbur, or a form that looked like a man. Then the moonlight glinted on
  something at the edge of the river. She ran to it and found the coffee-can
  half in the water and partially filled with sand.</p>

  <p>A wild temptation to scream came over her, but the tight muscles of her
  throat let out no sound. But if Wilbur were not here, where had he gone? He
  could not have vanished into thin air. The ripple of the water washing on the
  sand replied. Yes, that current might have rolled his body away.</p>

  <p>To shut out the grim sight of the river she turned. Stretched across the
  ground at her feet she saw clearly the impression of a body in the moist
  sand.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28"></a>CHAPTER 27</h2>

  <p class="first">The heels had left two deeply defined gouges in the ground;
  there was a sharp hollow where the head had lain, and a broad depression for
  the shoulders. It was the impression of the body of a man&mdash;a large man
  like Wilbur. Any hope, any doubt she might have had, slipped from her mind,
  and despair rolled into it with an even, sullen current, like the motion of
  the river.</p>

  <p>It is strange what we do with our big moments of fear and sorrow and even
  of joy. Now Mary stooped and carefully washed out the coffee-pot, and filled
  it again with water higher up the bank; and turned back toward the edge of
  the trees.</p>

  <p>It was all subconscious, this completing of the task which Wilbur had
  begun, and subconscious still was her careful rebuilding of the fire till it
  flamed high, as though she were setting a signal to recall the wanderer. But
  the flame, throwing warmth and red light across her eyes, recalled her
  sharply to reality, and she looked up and saw the dull dawn brightening
  beyond the dark evergreens.</p>

  <p>Guilt, too, swept over her, for she remembered what big, handsome Dick
  Wilbur had said: He would meet his end through a woman. Now it had come to
  him, and through her.</p>

  <p>She cringed at the thought, for what was she that a man should die in her
  service? She raised her hands with a moan to the nodding tops of the trees,
  to the vast, black sky above them, and the full knowledge of Wilbur's
  strength came to her, for had he not ridden calmly, defiantly, into the heart
  of this wilderness, confident in his power to care both for himself and for
  her? But she! What could she do wandering by herself? The image of Pierre le
  Rouge grew dim indeed and sad and distant.</p>

  <p>She looked about her at the pack, which had been distributed expertly, and
  disposed on the ground by Wilbur. She could not even lash it in place behind
  the saddle. So she drew the blanket once more around her shoulders and sat
  down to think.</p>

  <p>She might return to the house&mdash;doubtless she could find her way back.
  And leave Pierre in the heart of the mountains, surely lost to her forever.
  She made a determination, sullen, like a child, to ride on and on into the
  wilderness, and let fate take care of her. The pack she could bundle together
  as best she might; she would live as she might; and for a guide there would
  be the hunger for Pierre.</p>

  <p>So she ended her thoughts with a hope; her head nodded lower, and she
  slept the deep sleep of the exhausted mind and body. She woke hours later
  with a start, instantly alert, quivering with fear and life and energy, for
  she felt like one who has gone to sleep with voices in his ear.</p>

  <p>While she slept someone had been near her; she could have sworn it before
  her startled eyes glanced around.</p>

  <p>And though she kept whispering, with white lips, "No, no; it is
  impossible!" yet there was evidence which proved it. The fire should have
  burned out, but instead it flamed more brightly than ever, and there was a
  little heap of fuel laid conveniently close. Moreover, both horses were
  saddled, and the pack lashed on the saddle of her own mount.</p>

  <p>Whatever man or demon had done this work evidently intended that she
  should ride Wilbur's beautiful bay. Yes, for when she went closer, drawn by
  her wonder, she found that the stirrups had been much shortened.</p>

  <p>Nothing was forgotten by this invisible caretaker; he had even left out
  the cooking-tins, and she found a little batter of flapjack flour mixed.</p>

  <p>The riddle was too great for solving. Perhaps Wilbur had disappeared
  merely to play a practical jest on her; but that supposition was too childish
  to be retained an instant. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps Pierre himself had
  discovered her, but having vowed never to see her again, he cared for her
  like the invisible hands in the old Greek fable.</p>

  <p>This, again, an instinctive knowledge made her dismiss. If he were so
  close, loving her, he could not stay away; she read in her own heart, and
  knew. Then it must be something else; evil, because it feared to be seen; not
  wholly evil, because it surrounded her with care.</p>

  <p>At least this new emotion obscured somewhat the terror and the sorrow of
  Wilbur's disappearance. She cooked her breakfast as if obeying the order of
  the unseen, climbed into the saddle of Wilbur's horse, and started off up the
  valley, leading her own mount.</p>

  <p>Every moment or so she turned in the saddle suddenly in the hope of
  getting a glimpse of the follower, but even when she surveyed the entire
  stretch of country from the crest of a low hill, she saw nothing&mdash;not
  the least sign of life.</p>

  <p>She rode slowly, this day, for she was stiff and sore from the violent
  journey of the night before, but though she went slowly, she kept steadily at
  the trail. It was a broad and pleasant one, being the beaten sand of the
  river- bottom; and the horse she rode was the finest that ever pranced
  beneath her.</p>

  <p>His trot was as smooth and springy as the gallop of most horses, and when
  she let him run over a few level stretches, it was as if she had suddenly
  been taken up from the earth on wings. There was something about the animal,
  too, which reminded her of its vanished owner; for it had strength and pride
  and gentleness at once. Unquestionably it took kindly to its new rider; for
  once when she dismounted the big horse walked up behind and nuzzled her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>The mountains were much plainer before the end of the day. They rose sheer
  up in wave upon frozen wave like water piled ragged by some terrific gale,
  with the tops of the waters torn and tossed and then frozen forever in that
  position, like a fantastic and gargantuan mask of dreaming terror. It
  overawed the heart of Mary Brown to look up to them, but there was growing in
  her a new impulse of friendly understanding with all this scalped, bald
  region of rocks, as if in entering the valley she had passed through the gate
  which closes out the gentler world, and now she was admitted as a denizen of
  the mountain-desert, that scarred and ugly asylum for crime and fear and
  grandeur.</p>

  <p>Feeling this new emotion, the old horizons of her mind gave way and
  widened; her gentle nature, which had known nothing but smiles, admitted the
  meaning of a frown. Did she not ride under the very shadow of that frown with
  her two horses? Was she not armed? She touched the holster at her hip, and
  smiled. To be sure, she could never hit a mark with that ponderous weapon,
  but at least the pistol gave the feeling of a dangerous lone rider, familiar
  with the wilds.</p>

  <p>It was about dark, and she was on the verge of looking about for a
  suitable camping-place, when the bay halted sharply, tossed up his head, and
  whinnied. From the far distance she thought she heard the beginning of a
  whinny in reply. She could not be sure, but the possibility made her pulse
  quicken. In this region, she knew, no stranger could be a friend.</p>

  <p>So she started the bay at a gallop and put a couple of swift miles between
  her and the point at which she had heard the sound; no living creature, she
  was sure, could have followed the pace the bay held during that distance. So,
  secure in her loneliness, she trotted the horse around a bend of the rocks
  and came on the sudden light of a campfire.</p>

  <p>It was too late to wheel and gallop away; so she remained with her hand
  fumbling at the butt of the revolver, and her eyes fixed on the flicker of
  the fire. Not a voice accosted her. As far as she could peer among the lithe
  trunks of the saplings, not a sign of a living thing was near.</p>

  <p>Yet whoever built that fire must be near, for it was obviously newly laid.
  Perhaps some fleeing outlaw had pitched his camp here and had been startled
  by her coming. In that case he lurked somewhere in the woods at that moment,
  his keen eyes fixed on her, and his gun gripped hard in his hand.
  Perhaps&mdash;and the thought thrilled her&mdash;this little camp had been
  prepared by the same power, human or unearthly, which had watched over her
  early that morning.</p>

  <p>All reason and sane caution warned her to ride on and leave that camp
  unmolested, but an overwhelming, tingling curiosity besieged her. The thin
  column of smoke rose past the dark trees like a ghost, and reaching the
  unsheltered space above the trees, was smitten by a light wind and jerked
  away at a sharp angle.</p>

  <p>She looked closer and saw a bed made of a great heap of the tips of limbs
  of spruce, a bed softer than down and more fragrant than any manufactured
  perfume, however costly.</p>

  <p>Possibly it was the sight of this bed which tempted her down from the
  saddle, at last. With the reins over her arm, she stood close to the fire and
  warmed her hands, peering all the while on every side, like some wild and
  beautiful creature tempted by the bait of the trap, but shrinking from the
  scent of man.</p>

  <p>As she stood there a broad, yellow moon edged its way above the hills and
  rolled up through the black trees and then floated through the sky. Beneath
  such a moon no harm could come to her. It was while she stared at it, letting
  her tensed alertness relax little by little, that she saw, or thought she
  saw, a hint of moving white pass over the top of the rise of ground and
  disappear among the trees.</p>

  <p>She could not be sure, but her first impulse was to gather the reins with
  a jerk and place her foot in the stirrup; but then she looked back and saw
  the fire, burning low now and asking like a human voice to be replenished
  from the heap of small, broken fuel nearby; and she saw also the softly piled
  bed of evergreens.</p>

  <p>She removed her foot from the stirrup. What mattered that imaginary figure
  of moving white? She felt a strong power of protection lying all about her,
  breathing out to her with the keen scent of the pines, fanning her face with
  the chill of the night breeze. She was alone, but she was secure in the
  wilderness.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29"></a>CHAPTER 28</h2>

  <p class="first">For many a minute she waited by that camp-fire, but there
  was never a sign of the builder of it, though she centered all her will in
  making her eyes and ears sharper to pierce through the darkness and to gather
  from the thousand obscure whispers of the forest any sounds of human origin.
  So she grew bold at length to take off the pack and the saddles; the camp was
  hers, built for her coming by the invisible power which surrounded her, which
  read her mind, it seemed, and chose beforehand the certain route which she
  must follow.</p>

  <p>She resigned herself to that force without question, and the worry of her
  search disappeared. It seemed certain that this omnipotence, whatever it
  might be, was reading her wishes and acting with all its power to fulfill
  them, so that in the end it was merely a question of time before she should
  accomplish her mission&mdash;before she should meet Pierre le Rouge face to
  face.</p>

  <p>That night her sleep was deep, indeed, and she only wakened when the slant
  light of the sun struck across her eyes. It was a bright day, crisp and
  chill, and through the clear air the mountains seemed leaning directly above
  her, and chief of all two peaks, almost exactly similar, black monsters which
  ruled the range. Toward the gorge between them the valley of the Old Crow
  aimed its course, and straight up that diminishing canyon she rode all
  day.</p>

  <p>The broad, sandy bottom changed and contracted until the channel was
  scarcely wide enough for the meager stream of water, and beside it she picked
  her way along a narrow path with banks on either side, which became with
  every mile more like cliffs, walling her in and dooming her to a single
  destination.</p>

  <p>It was evening before she came to the headwaters of the Old Crow, and rode
  out into the gorge between the two mountains. The trail failed her here.
  There was no semblance of a ravine to follow, except the mighty gorge between
  the two peaks, and she ventured into the dark throat of this pass, riding
  through a gate with the guarding towers tall and black on either side.</p>

  <p>The moment she was well started in it and the steep shadow of the evening
  fell across her almost like night from the west, her heart grew cold as the
  air. A sense of coming danger filled her. Yet she kept on, holding a tight
  rein, throwing many a fearful glance at the vast rocks which might have
  concealed an entire army in every mile of their extent.</p>

  <p>When she found the cabin she mistook it at first for merely another rock
  of singular shape. It was at this shape that she stared, and checked her
  horse, and not till then did she note the faint flicker of a light no
  brighter than the phosphorescent glow of the eyes of a hunted beast.</p>

  <p>Her impulse was to drive her spurs home and pass that place at a racing
  gallop, but she checked the impulse sharply and began to reason. In the first
  place, it was doubtless only the cabin of some prospector, such as she had
  often heard of. In the second place, night was almost upon her, and she saw
  no desirable camping-place, or at least any with the necessary water at
  hand.</p>

  <p>What harm could come to her? Among Western men, she well knew a woman is
  safer than all the law and the police of the settled East can make her, so
  she nerved her courage and advanced toward the faint, changing light.</p>

  <p>The cabin was hidden very cunningly. Crouched among the mighty boulders
  which earthquakes and storms of some wilder, earlier epoch had torn away from
  the side of the crags above, the house was like another stone, leaning its
  back to the mountain for support.</p>

  <p>When she drew very close she knew that the light which glimmered at the
  window must come from an open fire, and the thought of a fire warmed her. She
  hallooed, and receiving no answer, fastened the horses and entered the house.
  The door swung to behind her, as if of its own volition it wished to make her
  a prisoner.</p>

  <p>The place consisted of one room, and not a spacious one at that, but
  arranged as a shelter, not a home. The cooking, apparently, was done over the
  open hearth, for there was no sign of any stove, and, moreover, on the wall
  near the fireplace hung several soot-blackened pans and the inevitable
  coffeepot. There were two bunks built on opposite sides of the room, and in
  the middle a table was made of a long section split from the heart of a log
  by wedges, apparently, and still rude and undressed, except for the
  preliminary smoothing off which had been done with a broad-ax.</p>

  <p>The great plank was supported at either end by a roughly constructed
  sawbuck. It was very low, and for this reason two fairly square boulders of
  comfortable proportions were sufficiently high to serve as chairs.</p>

  <p>For the rest, the furniture was almost too meager to suggest human
  habitation, but from nails on the wall there hung a few shirts and a pair of
  s, as well as a much-battered quirt. But a bucket of water in a corner
  suggested cleanliness, and a small, round, highly polished steel plate,
  hanging on the wall in lieu of a mirror, further fortified her decision that
  the owner of this place must be a man somewhat particular as to his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>Here she interrupted her observations to build up the fire, which was
  flickering down and apparently on the verge of going out. She worked busily
  for a few minutes, and a roaring blaze rewarded her; she took off her slicker
  to enjoy the warmth, and in doing so, turned, and saw the owner of the place
  standing with folded arms just inside the door.</p>

  <p>"Making yourself to home?" asked the host, in a low, strangely pleasant
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?" asked Mary Brown. "I couldn't find a place that would do
  for camping."</p>

  <p>And she summoned her most winning smile. It was wasted, she knew at once,
  for the stranger hardened perceptibly, and his lip curled slightly in scorn
  or anger. In all her life Mary had never met a man so obdurate, and,
  moreover, she felt that he could not be wooed into a good humor.</p>

  <p>"If you'd gone farther up the gorge," said the other, "you'd of found the
  best sort of a camping place&mdash;water and everything."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go," said Mary, shrinking at the thought of the strange, cold
  outdoors compared with this cheery fire. But she put on the slicker and
  started for the door.</p>

  <p>At the last moment the host was touched with compunction. He called: "Wait
  a minute. There ain't no call to hurry. If you can get along here just stick
  around."</p>

  <p>For a moment Mary hesitated, knowing that only the unwritten law of
  Western hospitality compelled that speech; it was the crackle and flare of
  the bright fire which overcame her pride.</p>

  <p>She laid off the slicker again, saying, with another smile: "For just a
  few minutes, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said the other gracelessly, and tossed his own slicker onto a
  bunk.</p>

  <p>Covertly, but very earnestly, Mary was studying him. He was hardly more
  than a boy&mdash;handsome, slender.</p>

  <p>Now that handsome face was under a cloud of gloom, a frown on the forehead
  and a sneer on the lips, but it was something more than the expression which
  repelled Mary. For she felt that no matter how she wooed him, she could never
  win the sympathy of this darkly handsome, cruel youth; he was aloof from her,
  and the distance between them could never be crossed. She knew at once that
  the mysterious bridges which link men with women broke down in this case, and
  she was strongly tempted to leave the cabin to the sole possession of her
  surly host.</p>

  <p>It was the warmth of the fire which once more decided against her reason,
  so she laid hands on one of the blocks of stone to roll it nearer to the
  hearth. She could not budge it. Then she caught the sneering laughter of the
  man, and strove again in a fury. It was no use; for the stone merely rocked a
  little and settled back in its place with a bump.</p>

  <p>"Here," said the boy, "I'll move it for you." It was a hard lift for him,
  but he set his teeth, raised the stone in his slender hands, and set it down
  again at a comfortable distance from the fire.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," smiled Mary, but the boy stood panting against the wall, and
  for answer merely bestowed on her a rather malicious glance of triumph, as
  though he gloried in his superior strength and despised her weakness.</p>

  <p>Some conversation was absolutely necessary, for the silence began to weigh
  on her. She said: "My name is Mary Brown."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said the boy, quite without interest. "You can call me Jack."</p>

  <p>He sat down on the other stone, his dark face swept by the shadows of the
  flames, and rolled a cigarette, not deftly, but like one who is learning the
  mastery of the art. It surprised Mary, watching his fumbling fingers. She
  decided that Jack must be even younger than he looked.</p>

  <p>She noticed also that the boy cast, from time to time, a sharp, rather
  worried glance of expectation toward the door, as if he feared it would open
  and disclose some important arrival. Furthermore, those old worn shirts
  hanging on the wall were much too large for the throat and shoulders of
  Jack.</p>

  <p>Apparently, he lived there with some companion, and a companion of such a
  nature that he did not wish him to be seen by visitors. This explained the
  lad's coldness in receiving a guest; it also stimulated Mary to linger about
  a few more minutes.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30"></a>CHAPTER 29</h2>

  <p class="first">Not that she stayed there without a growing fear, but she
  still felt about her, like the protection of some invisible cloak, the
  presence of the strange guide who had followed her up the valley of the Old
  Crow.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the boy were reading her mind.</p>

  <p>"See you got two horses. Come up alone?"</p>

  <p>"Most of the way," said Mary, and tingled with a rather feline pleasure to
  see that her curtness merely sharpened the interest of Jack.</p>

  <p>The boy puffed on his cigarette, not with long, slow breaths of inhalation
  like a practiced smoker, but with a puckered face as though he feared that
  the fumes might drift into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why," thought Mary, "he's only a child!"</p>

  <p>Her heart warmed a little as she adopted this view of her surly host.
  Being warmed, and having much to say, words came of themselves. Surely it
  would do no harm to tell the story to this queer urchin, who might be able to
  throw some light on the nature of the invisible protector.</p>

  <p>"I started with a man for guide." She fixed a searching gaze on the boy.
  "His name was Dick Wilbur."</p>

  <p>She could not tell whether it was a tremble of the boy's hand or a short
  motion to knock off the cigarette ash.</p>

  <p>"Did you say 'was' Dick Wilbur?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Did you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Heard of him, I think. Kind of a hard one, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"No, no! A fine, brave, gentle fellow&mdash;poor Dick!" She stopped, her
  eyes filling with tears at many a memory.</p>

  <p>"Hm!" coughed the boy. "I thought he was one of old Boone's gang? If he's
  dead, that made the last of 'em&mdash;except Red Pierre."</p>

  <p>It was like the sound of a trumpet call at her ear. Mary sat up with a
  start.</p>

  <p>"What do you know of Red Pierre?"</p>

  <p>The boy flushed a little, and could not quite meet her eye.</p>

  <p>"Nothin'."</p>

  <p>"At least you know that he's still alive?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Anyone does. When he dies the whole range will know about it
  &mdash;damn quick. I know <i>that</i> much about Red Pierre; but who
  doesn't?"</p>

  <p>"I, for one."</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, there was more of accusation than of surprise in the
  word.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," repeated Mary. "I've only been in this part of the country
  for a short time. I really know almost nothing about the&mdash;legends."</p>

  <p>"Legends?" said the boy, and laughed. "Legend? Say, lady, if Red Pierre is
  just a legend the Civil War ain't no more'n a fable. Legend? You go anywhere
  on the range an' get 'em talking about that legend, and they'll make you
  think it's an honest-to-goodness fact, and no mistake."</p>

  <p>Mary queried earnestly: "Tell me about Red Pierre. It's almost as hard to
  learn anything of him as it is to find out anything about McGurk."</p>

  <p>"What you doing?" asked the boy, keen with suspicion. "Making a study of
  them two for a book?"</p>

  <p>He wiped a damp forehead.</p>

  <p>"Take it from me, lady, it ain't healthy to join up them two even in
  talk!" "Is there any harm in words?"</p>

  <p>The boy was so upset for some unknown reason that he rose and paced up and
  down the room.</p>

  <p>"Lots of harm in fool words."</p>

  <p>He sat down again, and seemed a little anxious to explain his unusual
  conduct.</p>

  <p>"Ma'am, suppose you had a well plumb full of nitroglycerin in your back
  yard; suppose there was a forest fire comin' your way from all sides; would
  you like to have people talk about nitroglycerin and that forest fire
  meeting? Even the talk would give you chills. That's the way it is with
  Pierre and McGurk. When they meet there's going to be a fight that'll stop
  the hearts of the people that have to look on."</p>

  <p>Mary smiled to cover her excitement.</p>

  <p>"But are they coming your way?"</p>

  <p>The question seemed to infuriate young Jack, who cried: "Ain't that a fool
  way of talkin'? Lady, they're coming everyone's way. You never know where
  they'll start from or where they'll land. If there's a thunder-cloud all over
  the sky, do you know where the lightning's going to strike?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Mary, but she was still eager with curiosity, "but I
  should think that a youngster like you wouldn't have anything to fear from
  even those desperadoes."</p>

  <p>"Youngster, eh?" snarled the boy, whose wrath seemed implacable. "I can
  make my draw and start my gun as fast as any man&mdash;except them two,
  maybe"&mdash;he lowered his voice somewhat even to name them&mdash;"Pierre
  &mdash;McGurk!"</p>

  <p>"It seems hopeless to find out anything about McGurk," said Mary, "but at
  least you can tell me safely about Red Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Interested in him, eh?" said the boy dryly.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's a rather romantic figure, don't you think?" "Romantic? Lady,
  about a month ago I was talking with a lady that was a widow because of Red
  Pierre. She didn't think him none too romantic."</p>

  <p>"Red Pierre had killed the woman's husband?" repeated Mary, with pale
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Yep. He was one of the gang that took a chance with Pierre and got bumped
  off. Had three bullets in him and dropped without getting his gun out of the
  leather. Pierre sure does a nice, artistic job. He serves you a murder with
  all the trimmings. If I wanted to die nice and polite without making a mess,
  I don't know who I'd rather go to than Red Pierre."</p>

  <p>"A murderer!" whispered Mary, with bowed head.</p>

  <p>The boy opened his lips to speak, but changed his mind and sat regarding
  the girl with a somewhat sinister smile.</p>

  <p>"But might it not be," said Mary, "that he killed one man in self-defense
  and then his destiny drove him, and bad luck forced him into one bad position
  after another? There have been histories as strange as that, you know."</p>

  <p>Jack laughed again, but most of the music was gone from the sound, and it
  was simply a low, ominous purr.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said. "You can take a bear-cub and keep him tame till he gets
  the taste of blood, but after that you got to keep him muzzled, you know.
  Pierre needs a muzzle, but there ain't enough gunfighters on the range to put
  one on him."</p>

  <p>Something like pride crept into the boy's voice while he spoke, and he
  ended with a ringing tone. Then, feeling the curious, judicial eyes of Mary
  upon him, he abruptly changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"You say Dick Wilbur is dead?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I think he is."</p>

  <p>"But he started out with you. You ought to know."</p>

  <p>"It was like this: We had camped on the edge of the trees coming up the
  Old Crow Valley, and Dick went off with the can to get water at the river. He
  was gone a long time, and when I went out to look for him I found the can at
  the margin of the river half filled with sand, and beside it there was the
  impression of the body of a big man. That was all I found, and Dick never
  came back."</p>

  <p>They were both silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Could he have fallen into the river?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. He was probably helped in. Did you look for the footprints?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't think of that."</p>

  <p>Jack was speechless with scorn.</p>

  <p>"Sat down and cried, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I was dazed; I couldn't think. But he couldn't have been killed by some
  other man. There was no shot fired; I should have heard it."</p>

  <p>Jack moistened his lips.</p>

  <p>"Lady, a knife don't make much sound either going or coming out&mdash; not
  much more sound than a whisper, but that whisper means a lot. I got an idea
  that Dick heard it. Then the river covered him up."</p>

  <p>He stopped short and stared at Mary with squinted eyes.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean to tell me that you had the nerve to come all the way up the
  Old Crow by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Every inch of the way."</p>

  <p>Jack leaned forward, sneering, savage.</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose you put the hitch that's on that pack outside?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Jack was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"Then you admit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That first night when I went to sleep I felt as if there were something
  near me. When I woke up there was a bright fire burning in front of me and
  the pack had been lashed and placed on one of the horses. At first I thought
  that it was Dick, who had come back. But Dick didn't appear all day. The next
  night &mdash;" "Wait!" said Jack. "This is gettin' sort of creepy. If you was
  the drinking kind I'd say you'd been hitting up the red-eye."</p>

  <p>"The next evening," continued Mary steadily, "I came about dark on a camp-
  fire with a bed of twigs near it. I stayed by the fire, but no one appeared.
  Once I thought I heard a horse whinny far away, and once I thought that I saw
  a streak of white disappear over the top of a hill."</p>

  <p>The boy sprang up, shuddering with panic.</p>

  <p>"You saw what?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I thought for a minute that it was a bit of something white, but
  it was gone all at once."</p>

  <p>"White&mdash;vanished at once&mdash;went into the dark as fast as a horse
  can gallop?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that. Do you think it was someone?"</p>

  <p>For answer the boy whipped out his revolver, examined it, and spun the
  cylinder with shaking hands. Then he said through set teeth: "So you come up
  here trailin' him after you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"McGurk!"</p>

  <p>The name came like a rifle shot and Mary rose in turn and shrank back
  toward the wall, for there was murder in the lighted black eyes which stared
  after her and crumbling fear in her own heart at the thought of McGurk
  hovering near&mdash;of the peril that impended for Pierre. Of the nights in
  the valley of the Crow she refused to let herself think. Cold beads of
  perspiration stood out on her forehead.</p>

  <p>"You fool&mdash;you fool! Damn your pretty pink-and-white face&mdash;
  you've done for us all! Get out!"</p>

  <p>Mary moved readily enough toward the door, her teeth chattering with
  terror in the face of this fury.</p>

  <p>Jack continued wildly: "Done for us all; got us all as good as under the
  sod. I wish you was in&mdash;Get out quick, or I'll forget&mdash;you're a
  woman!" He broke into hysterical laughter, which stopped short and finished
  in a heartbroken whisper: "Pierre!"</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31"></a>CHAPTER 30</h2>

  <p class="first">At that Mary, who stood with her hand on the latch, whirled
  and stood wide-eyed, her astonishment greater than her fear, for that whisper
  told her a thousand things.</p>

  <p>Through her mind all the time that she stayed in the cabin there had
  passed a curious surmise that this very place might be the covert of Pierre
  le Rouge. There was a fatality about it, for the invisible Power which had
  led her up the valley of the Old Crow surely would not make mistakes.</p>

  <p>In her search for Pierre, Providence brought her to this place, and
  Providence could not be wrong. This, a vague emotion stirring in her
  somewhere between reason and the heart, grew to an almost certain knowledge
  as she heard the whisper, the faint, heartbroken whisper: "Pierre!"</p>

  <p>And when she turned to the boy again, noting the shirts and the s hanging
  at the wall, she knew they belonged to Pierre as surely as if she had seen
  him hang them there.</p>

  <p>The fingers of Jack were twisted around the butt of his revolver, white
  with the intensity of the pressure.</p>

  <p>Now he cried: "Get out! You've done your work; get out!"</p>

  <p>But Mary stepped straight toward the murderous, pale face. "I'll stay,"
  she said, "and wait for Pierre."</p>

  <p>The boy blanched.</p>

  <p>"Stay?" he echoed.</p>

  <p>The heart of Mary went out to this trusted companion who feared for his
  friend.</p>

  <p>She said gently: "Listen; I've come all this way looking for Pierre, but
  not to harm him or to betray him, I'm his friend. Can't you trust me
  Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Trust you? No more than I'll trust what came with you!"</p>

  <p>And the fierce black eyes lingered on Mary and then fled past her toward
  the door, as if the boy debated hotly and silently whether or not it would be
  better to put an end to this intruder, but stayed his hand, fearing that
  Power which had followed her up the valley of the Old Crow.</p>

  <p>It was that same invisible guardian who made Mary strong now; it was like
  the hand of a friend on her shoulder, like the voice of a friend whispering
  reassuring words at her ear. She faced those blazing, black eyes steadily. It
  would be better to be frank, wholly frank.</p>

  <p>"This is the house of Pierre. I know it as surely as if I saw him sitting
  here now. You can't deceive me. And I'll stay. I'll even tell you why. Once
  he said that he loved me, Jack, but he left me because of a strange
  superstition; and so I've followed to tell him that I want to be near no
  matter what fate hangs over him."</p>

  <p>And the boy, whiter still, and whiter, looked at her with clearing,
  narrowing eyes.</p>

  <p>"So you're one of them," said the boy softly; "you're one of the fools who
  listen to Red Pierre. Well, I know you; I've known you from the minute I seen
  you crouched there at the fire. You're the one Pierre met at the dance at the
  Crittenden schoolhouse. Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mary, marveling greatly.</p>

  <p>"And he told you he loved you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." It was a fainter voice now, and the color was going up her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>The lad fixed her with his cold scorn and then turned on his heel and
  slipped into an easy position on the bunk.</p>

  <p>"Then wait for him to come. He'll be here before morning."</p>

  <p>But Mary followed across the room and touched the shoulder of Jack. It was
  as if she touched a wild wolf, for the lad whirled and struck her hand away
  in an outburst of silent fury.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I stay? He hasn't&mdash;he hasn't changed&mdash; Jack?"</p>

  <p>The insolent black eyes looked up and scanned her slowly from head to
  foot. Then he laughed in the same deliberate manner.</p>

  <p>"No, I guess he thinks as much of you now as he ever did."</p>

  <p>"You are lying to me," said the girl faintly, but the terror in her eyes
  said another thing.</p>

  <p>"He thinks as much of you as he ever did. He thinks as much of you as he
  does of the rest of the soft-handed, pretty-faced fools who listen to him and
  believe him. I suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off to laugh heartily again, with a jarring, forced note which
  escaped Mary.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that he made love to you one minute and the next told you that
  bad luck&mdash;something about the cross&mdash;kept him away from you?"</p>

  <p>Each slow word was like a blow of a fist. Mary closed her eyes to shut out
  the scorn of that handsome, boyish face; closed her eyes to summon out from
  the dark of her mind the picture of Pierre le Rouge as he had told her of his
  love; and then she heard the voice of Pierre renouncing her.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes again. She cried: "It is all a lie! If he is not true,
  there's no truth in the world."</p>

  <p>"If you come down to that," said the boy coldly, "there ain't much wasted
  this side of the Rockies. It's about as scarce as rain."</p>

  <p>He continued in an almost kindly tone: "What would you do with a wild man
  like Red Pierre? Run along; git out of here; grab your horse, and beat it
  back to civilization; there ain't no place for you up here in the
  wilderness."</p>

  <p>"What would I do with him?" cried the girl. "Love him!"</p>

  <p>It seemed as though her words, like whips, lashed the boy back to his
  murderous anger. He lay with blazing eyes, watching her for a moment, too
  moved to speak. At last he propped himself on one elbow, shook a small,
  white- knuckled fist under the nose of Mary, and cried: "Then what would he
  do with you?"</p>

  <p>He went on: "Would he wear you around his neck like a watch charm?"</p>

  <p>"I'd bring him back with me&mdash;back into the East, and he would be lost
  among the crowds and never suspected of his past."</p>

  <p>"<i>You'd</i> bring Pierre anywhere? Say, lady, that's like hearing the
  sheep talk about leading the wolf around by the nose. If all the men in the
  ranges can't catch him, or make him budge an inch out of the way he's picked,
  do you think you could stir him?"</p>

  <p>Jeering laughter shook him; it seemed that he would never be done with his
  laughter, yet there was a hint of the hysterically mirthless in it. It came
  to a jarring stop.</p>

  <p>He said: "D'you think he's just bein' driven around by chance? Lady, d'you
  think he even <i>wants</i> to get out of this life of his? No, he loves it!
  He loves the danger. D'you think a man that's used to breathing in a
  whirlwind can get used to living in calm air? It can't be done!"</p>

  <p>And the girl answered steadily: "For every man there is one woman, and for
  that woman the man will do strange things."</p>

  <p>"You poor, white-faced, whimpering fool," snarled the boy, gripping at his
  gun again, "d'you dream that you're the one that's picked out for Pierre? No,
  there's another!"</p>

  <p>"Another? A woman who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who loves Pierre&mdash;a woman that's fit for him. She can ride like a
  man; she can shoot almost as straight and as fast as Pierre; she can handle a
  knife; and she's been through hell for Pierre, and she'll go through it
  again. She can ride the trail all day with him and finish it less fagged than
  he is. She can chop down a tree as well as he can, and build a fire better.
  She can hold up a train with him or rob a bank and slip through a town in the
  middle of the night and laugh with him about it afterward around a campfire.
  I ask you, is that the sort of a woman that's meant for Pierre?"</p>

  <p>And Mary answered, with bowed head: "She is."</p>

  <p>She cried instantly afterward, cutting short the look of wild triumph on
  the face of the boy: "But there's no such woman; there's no one who could do
  these things! I know it!"</p>

  <p>The boy sprang to his feet, flushing as red as the girl was white.</p>

  <p>"You fool, if you're blind and got to have your eyes open to see, look at
  the woman!"</p>

  <p>And she tore the wide-brimmed sombrero from her head. Down past the
  shoulders flooded a mass of blue-black hair. The firelight flickered and
  danced across the silken shimmer of it. It swept wildly past the waist, a
  glorious, night-dark tide in which the heart of a strong man could be tangled
  and lost. With quivering lips Jacqueline cried: "Look at me! Am I worthy of
  him?"</p>

  <p>Short step by step Mary went back, staring with fascinated eyes as one who
  sees some devilish, midnight revelry, and shrinks away from it lest the sight
  should blast her. She covered her eyes with her hands but instantly strong
  grips fell on her wrists and her hands were jerked down from her face. She
  looked up into the eyes of a beautiful tigress.</p>

  <p>"Answer me&mdash;your yellow hair against mine&mdash;your child fingers
  against my grip&mdash;are you equal with me?"</p>

  <p>But the strength of Jacqueline faded and grew small; her arms fell to her
  side; she stepped back, with a rising pallor taking the place of the red. For
  Mary, brushing her hands, one gloved and one bare, before her eyes, returned
  the stare of the mountain girl with equal scorn. A mighty loathing filled up
  her veins in place of strength.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "was&mdash;was this man living with you when he came
  to me and&mdash;and made speeches&mdash;about love?"</p>

  <p>"Bah! He was living with me. I tell you, he came back and laughed with me
  about it, and told me about your baby-blue eyes when they filled with tears;
  laughed and laughed and laughed, I tell you, as I could laugh now."</p>

  <p>The other twisted her hands together, moaning: "And I have followed him,
  even to the place where he keeps his&mdash;woman? Ah, how I hate myself: how
  I despise myself. I'm unclean&mdash;unclean in my own eyes!"</p>

  <p>"Wait!" called Jacqueline. "You are leaving too soon. The night is
  cold."</p>

  <p>"I am going. There is no need to gibe at me."</p>

  <p>"But wait&mdash;he will want to see you! I will tell him that you have
  been here&mdash;that you came clear up the valley of the Old Crow to see him
  and beg him on your knees to love you&mdash;he'll be angry to have missed the
  scene!"</p>

  <p>But the door closed on Mary as she fled with her hands pressed against her
  ears.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32"></a>CHAPTER 31</h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline ran to the door and threw it open.</p>

  <p>"Ride down the valley!" she cried. "That's right. He's coming up, and
  he'll meet you on the way. He'll be glad&mdash;to see you!"</p>

  <p>She saw the rider swing sharply about, and the clatter of the galloping
  hoofs died out up the valley; then she closed the door, dropped the latch,
  and, running to the middle of the room, threw up her arms and cried out, a
  wild, shrill yell of triumph like the call of the old Indian brave when he
  rises with the scalp of his murdered enemy dripping in his hand.</p>

  <p>The extended arms she caught back to her breast, and stood there with head
  tilted back, crushing her delight closer to her heart.</p>

  <p>And she whispered: "Pierre! Mine, mine! Pierre!"</p>

  <p>Next she went to the steel mirror on the wall and looked long at the
  flushed, triumphant image. At length she started, like one awakening from a
  happy dream, and hurriedly coiled the thick, soft tresses about her head.
  Never before had she lingered so over a toilet, patting each lock into place,
  twisting her head from side to side like a peacock admiring its image.</p>

  <p>Now she looked about hungrily for a touch of color and uttered a little
  moan of vexation when she saw nothing, till her eyes, piercing through the
  gloom of a dim corner, saw a spray of autumn leaves, long left there and
  still stained with beauty. She fastened them at the breast of her shirt, and
  so arrayed began to cook. Never was there a merrier cook, not even some jolly
  French chef with a heart made warm with good red wine, for she sang as she
  worked, and whenever she had to cross the room it was with a dancing step.
  Spring was in her blood, warm spring that sets men smiling for no cause
  except that they are living, and rejoicing with the whole awakening
  world.</p>

  <p>So it was with Jacqueline. Ever and anon as she leaned over the pans and
  stirred the fire she raised her head and remained a moment motionless,
  waiting for a sound, yearning to hear, and each time she had to look down
  again with a sigh.</p>

  <p>As it was, he took her by surprise, for he entered with the soft foot of
  the hunted and remained an instant searching the room with a careful glance.
  Not that he suspected, not that he had not relaxed his guard and his
  vigilance the moment he caught sight of the flicker of light through the mass
  of great boulders, but the lifelong habit of watchfulness remained with
  him.</p>

  <p>Even when he spoke face to face with a man, he never seemed to be giving
  more than half his attention, for might not someone else approach if he lost
  himself in order to listen to any one voice? He had covered half the length
  of the room with that soundless step before she heard, and rose with a glad
  cry: "Pierre!"</p>

  <p>Meeting that calm blue eye, she checked herself mightily.</p>

  <p>"A hard ride?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much."</p>

  <p>He took the rock nearest the fire and then raised a glance of inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I got cold," she said, "and rolled it over."</p>

  <p>He considered her and then the rock, not with suspicion, but as if he held
  the matter in abeyance for further consideration; a hunted man and a hunter
  must keep an eye for little things, must carry an armed hand and an armed
  heart even among friends. As for Jacqueline, her color had risen, and she
  leaned hurriedly over a pan in which meat was frying.</p>

  <p>"Any results?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Some."</p>

  <p>She waited, knowing that the story would come at length.</p>

  <p>He added after a moment: "Strange how careless some people get to be."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she queried.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Another pause, during which he casually drummed his fingers on his knee.
  She saw that he must receive more encouragement before he would tell, and she
  gave it, smiling to herself. Women are old in certain ways of understanding
  in which men remain children forever.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we're still broke, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"Broke? Well, not entirely. I got some results."</p>

  <p>"Good."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, it was a pretty fair haul. Watch that meat, Jack; I
  think it's burning."</p>

  <p>It was hardly beginning to cook, but she turned it obediently and hid
  another slow smile. Rising, she passed behind his chair, and pretended to
  busy herself with something near the wall. This was the environment and
  attitude which would make him talk most freely, she knew.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of careless men," said Pierre, "I could tell you a yarn,
  Jack."</p>

  <p>She stood close behind him and made about his unconscious head a gesture
  of caress, the overflow of an infinite tenderness.</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to hear it, Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was like this: I knew a fellow who started on the range with a
  small stock of cattle. He wasn't a very good worker, and he didn't understand
  cattle any too well, so he didn't prosper for quite a while. Then his affairs
  took a sudden turn for the better; his herd began to increase. Nobody
  understood the reason, though a good many suspected, but one man fell onto
  the reason: our friend was simply running in a few doggies on the side, and
  he'd arranged a very ingenious way of changing the brands."</p>

  <p>"Pierre&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"What does 'ingenious' mean?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I should say it means 'skillful, clever,' and it carries with it the
  connotation of 'novel.'"</p>

  <p>"It carries the con-conno&mdash;what's that word, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to get some books for you, Jack, and we'll do a bit of reading
  on the side, shall we?"</p>

  <p>"I'd love that!"</p>

  <p>He turned and looked up to her sharply.</p>

  <p>He said: "Sometimes, Jack, you talk just like a girl."</p>

  <p>"Do I? That's queer, isn't it? But go on with the story."</p>

  <p>"He changed the brands very skillfully, and no one got the dope on him
  except this one man I mentioned; and that man kept his face shut. He
  waited.</p>

  <p>"So it went on for a good many years. The herd of our friend grew very
  rapidly. He sold just enough cattle to keep himself and his wife alive; he
  was bent on making one big haul, you see. So when his doggies got to the
  right age and condition for the market, he'd trade them off, one fat doggie
  for two or three skinny yearlings. But finally he had a really big herd
  together, and shipped it off to the market on a year when the price was
  sky-high."</p>

  <p>"Like this year?"</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt me, Jack!"</p>

  <p>From the shadow behind him she smiled again.</p>

  <p>"They went at a corking price, and our friend cleared up a good many
  thousand&mdash;I won't say just how much. He sank part of it in a ruby brooch
  for his wife, and shoved the rest into a satchel.</p>

  <p>"You see how careful he'd been all those years while he was piling up his
  fortune? Well, he began to get careless the moment he cashed in, which was
  rather odd. He depended on his fighting power to keep that money safe, but he
  forgot that while he'd been making a business of rustling doggies and
  watching cattle markets, other men had been making a business of shooting
  fast and straight.</p>

  <p>"Among others there was the silent man who'd watched and waited for so
  long. But this silent man hove alongside while our rich friend was bound home
  in a buckboard.</p>

  <p>"'Good evening!' he called.</p>

  <p>"The rich turned and heard; it all seemed all right, but he'd done a good
  deal of shady business in his day, and that made him suspicious of the silent
  man now. So he reached for his gun and got it out just in time to be shot
  cleanly through the hand.</p>

  <p>"The silent man tied up that hand and sympathized with the rich ; then he
  took that satchel and divided the paper money into two bundles. One was twice
  the size of the other, and the silent man took the smaller one. There was
  only twelve thousand dollars in it. Also, he took the ruby brooch for a
  friend &mdash;and as a sort of keepsake, you know. And he delivered a short
  lecture to the rich man on the subject of carelessness and rode away. The
  rich man picked up his gun with his left hand and opened fire, but he'd never
  learned to shoot very well with that hand, so the silent man came through
  safe."</p>

  <p>"That's a bully story," said Jack. "Who was the silent man?"</p>

  <p>"I think you've seen him a few times, at that."</p>

  <p>She concealed another smile, and said in the most businesslike manner:
  "Chow-time, Pierre," and set out the pans on the table. "By the way," he said
  easily, "I've got a little present for you, Jack."</p>

  <p>And he took out a gold pin flaming with three great rubies.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33"></a>CHAPTER 32</h2>

  <p class="first">She merely stared, like a child which may either burst into
  tears or laughter, no one can prophesy which.</p>

  <p>He explained, rather worried: "You see, you <i>are</i> a girl, Jack, and I
  remembered that you were pleased about those clothes that you wore to the
  dance in the Crittenden schoolhouse, and so when I saw that pin I&mdash;well
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pierre!" said a stifled voice. "Oh, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"Jack, you aren't angry, are you? See, when you put it at the throat it
  doesn't look half bad!"</p>

  <p>And to try it, he pinned it on her shirt. She caught both his hands,
  kissed them again and again, and then buried her face against them as she
  sobbed. If the heavens had opened and a cloudburst crashed on the roof of the
  house, he would have been less astounded.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he cried. "Damn it all&mdash;Jack&mdash;you see&mdash; I
  meant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she tore herself away and flung herself face down on the bunk, sobbing
  more bitterly than ever. He followed, awestricken&mdash;terrified.</p>

  <p>He touched her shoulder, but she shrank away and seemed more distressed
  than ever. It was not the crying of a weak woman: these were heartrending
  sounds, like the sobbing of a man who has never before known tears.</p>

  <p>"Jack&mdash;perhaps I've done something wrong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stammered again: "I didn't dream I was hurting you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then light broke upon him.</p>

  <p>He said: "It's because you don't want to be treated like a silly girl; eh,
  Jack?"</p>

  <p>But to complete his astonishment she moaned: "N-n-no! It's b-b-because
  you&mdash;you n-n-never <i>do</i> t-treat me like a g-g-girl,
  P-P-Pierre!"</p>

  <p>He groaned heartily: "Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

  <p>And because he was thoughtful he strode away, staring at the floor. It was
  then that he saw it, small and crumpled on the floor. He picked it up
  &mdash;a glove of the softest leather. He carried it back to Jacqueline.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>"Wh-wh-what?"</p>

  <p>"This glove I found on the floor?"</p>

  <p>The sobs decreased at once&mdash;broke out more violently&mdash;and then
  she sprang up from the bunk.</p>

  <p>"Pierre, I've acted a regular chump. Are you out with me?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, old-timer. But about this glove?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's one of mine."</p>

  <p>She took it and slipped it into the bosom of her shirt&mdash;the calm blue
  eye of Pierre noted.</p>

  <p>He said: "We'll eat and forget the rest of this, if you want, Jack."</p>

  <p>"And you ain't mad at me, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit."</p>

  <p>There was just a trace of coldness in his tone, and she knew perfectly why
  it was there, but she chose to ascribe it to another cause.</p>

  <p>She explained: "You see, a woman is just about nine tenths fool, Pierre,
  and has to bust out like that once in a while."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Pierre, and his eyes wandered past her as though he found food
  for thought on the wall.</p>

  <p>She ventured cautiously, after seeing that he was eating with appetite:
  "How does the pin look?"</p>

  <p>"Why, fine."</p>

  <p>And the silence began again.</p>

  <p>She dared not question him in that mood, so she ventured again: "The old
  boy shooting left-handed&mdash;didn't he even fan the wind near you?"</p>

  <p>"That was another bit of carelessness," said Pierre, but his smile held
  little of life. "He might have known that if he <i>had</i> shot close&mdash;
  by accident&mdash;I might have turned around and shot him dead&mdash;on
  purpose. But when a man stops thinking for a minute, he's apt to go on for a
  long time making a fool of himself."</p>

  <p>"Right," she said, brightening as she felt the crisis pass away, "and that
  reminds me of a story about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By the way, Jack, I'll wager there's a more interesting story than that
  you could tell me."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"About how that glove happened to be on the floor."</p>

  <p>"Why, partner, it's just a glove of my own."</p>

  <p>"Didn't know you wore gloves with a leather as soft as that."</p>

  <p>"No? Well, that story I was speaking about runs something like this
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>And she told him a gay narrative, throwing all her spirit into it, for she
  was an admirable mimic. He met her spirit more than half-way, laughing gaily;
  and so they reached the end of the story and the end of the meal at the same
  time. She cleared away the pans with a few motions and tossed them clattering
  into a corner. Neat housekeeping was not numbered among the many virtues of
  Jacqueline. "Now," said Pierre, leaning back against the wall, "we'll hear
  about that glove."</p>

  <p>"Damn the glove!" broke from her.</p>

  <p>"Steady, pal!"</p>

  <p>"Pierre, are you going to nag me about a little thing like that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Jack, you're red and white in patches. I'm interested."</p>

  <p>He sat up.</p>

  <p>"I'm more than interested. The story, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I have to tell you. I did a fool thing today. Took a
  little gallop down the trail, and on my way back I met a girl sitting in her
  saddle with her face in her hands, crying her heart out. Poor kid! She'd come
  up in a hunting party and got separated from the rest.</p>

  <p>"So I got sympathetic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About the first time on record that you've been sympathetic with another
  girl, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Pierre! And I brought her in here&mdash;right into your cabin,
  without thinking what I was doing, and gave her a cup of coffee. Of course it
  was a pretty greenhorn trick, but I guess no harm will come of it. The girl
  thinks it's a prospector's cabin&mdash;which it was once. She went on her
  way, happy, because I told her of the right trail to get back with her gang.
  That's all there is to it. Are you mad at me for letting anyone come into
  this place?"</p>

  <p>"Mad?" He smiled. "No, I think that's one of the best lies you ever told
  me, Jack."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met, hers very wide, and his keen and steady. Then she gripped
  at the butt of her gun, an habitual trick when she was very angry, and cried:
  "Do I have to sit here and let you call me&mdash;that? Pierre, pull a few
  more tricks like that and I'll call for a new deal. Get me?"</p>

  <p>She rose, whirled, and threw herself sullenly on her bunk. "Come back,"
  said Pierre. "You're more scared than angry. Why are you afraid, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"It's a lie&mdash;I'm not afraid!"</p>

  <p>"Let me see that glove again."</p>

  <p>"You've seen it once&mdash;that's enough."</p>

  <p>He whistled carelessly, rolling a cigarette. After he lighted it he said:
  "Ready to talk yet, partner?"</p>

  <p>She maintained an obstinate silence, but that sharp eye saw that she was
  trembling. He set his teeth and then drew several long puffs on his
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to count to ten, pal, and when I finish you're going to tell me
  everything straight. In the meantime don't stay there thinking up a new lie.
  I know you too well, and if you try the same thing on me again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" she snarled, all the tiger coming back in her voice.</p>

  <p>"You'll talk, all right. Here goes the count: One&mdash;two&mdash;
  three&mdash;four&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he counted, leaving a long drag of two or three seconds between
  numbers, there was not a change in the figure of the girl. She still lay with
  her back turned on him, and the only expressive part that showed was her
  hand. First it lay limp against her hip, but as the monotonous count
  proceeded it gathered to a fist.</p>

  <p>"Five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It seemed that he had been counting for hours, his will against her will,
  the man in him against the woman in her, and during the pauses between the
  sound of his voice the very air grew charged with waiting. To the girl the
  wait for every count was like the wait of the doomed traitor when he stands
  facing the firing-squad, watching the glimmer of light go down the aimed
  rifles.</p>

  <p>For she knew the face of the man who sat there counting; she knew how the
  firelight flared in the dark red of his hair and made it seem like another
  fire beneath which the blue of the eyes was strangely cold. Her hand had
  gathered to a hard-balled fist.</p>

  <p>"Eight&mdash;nine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She sprang up, screaming: "No, no, Pierre!" And threw out her arms to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Ten."</p>

  <p>She whispered: "It was the girl with yellow hair&mdash;Mary
  Brown."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34"></a>CHAPTER 33</h2>

  <p class="first">It was as if she had said: "Good morning!" in the calmest of
  voices. There was no answer in him, neither word nor expression, and out of
  ten sharp- eyed men, nine would have passed him by without noting the
  difference; but the girl knew him as the monk knows his prayers or the Arab
  his horse, and a solemn, deep despair came over her. She felt like the
  drowning, when the water closes over their heads for the last time.</p>

  <p>He puffed twice again at the cigarette and then flicked the butt into the
  fire. When he spoke it was only to say: "Did she stay long?"</p>

  <p>But his eyes avoided her. She moved a little so as to read his face, but
  when he turned again and answered her stare she winced. "Not very long,
  Pierre."</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said. "I see! It was because she didn't dream that this was the
  place I lived in."</p>

  <p>It was the sort of heartless, torturing questioning which was once the
  crudest weapon of the inquisition. With all her heart she fought to raise her
  voice above the whisper whose very sound accused her, but could not. She was
  condemned to that voice as the man bound in nightmare is condemned to walk
  slowly, slowly, though the terrible danger is racing toward him, and the
  safety which he must reach lies only a dozen steps, a dozen mortal steps
  away.</p>

  <p>She said in that voice: "No; of course she didn't dream it."</p>

  <p>"And you, Jack, had her interests at heart&mdash;her best interests, poor
  girl, and didn't tell her?"</p>

  <p>Her hands went out to him in mute appeal.</p>

  <p>"Please, Pierre&mdash;don't!"</p>

  <p>"Is something troubling you, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"You are breaking my heart."</p>

  <p>"Why, by no means! Let's sit here calmly and chat about the girl with the
  yellow hair. To begin with&mdash;she's rather pleasant to look at, don't you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose she is."</p>

  <p>"Hm! Rather poor taste not to be sure of it. Well, let it go. You've
  always had rather queer taste in women, Jack; but, of course, being a long-
  rider, you haven't seen much of them. At least her name is delightful&mdash;
  Mary Brown! You've no idea how often I've repeated it aloud to myself&mdash;
  Mary Brown!"</p>

  <p>"I hate her!"</p>

  <p>"You two didn't have a very agreeable time of it? By the way, she must
  have left in rather a hurry to forget her glove, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she ran&mdash;like a coward."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" "Like a trembling coward. How can you care for a white-faced little
  fool like that? Is she your match? Is she your mate?"</p>

  <p>He considered a moment, as though to make sure that he did not
  exaggerate.</p>

  <p>"I love her, Jack, as men love water when they've ridden all day over hot
  sand without a drop on their lips&mdash;you know when the tongue gets thick
  and the mouth fills with cotton&mdash;and then you see clear, bright water,
  and taste it?</p>

  <p>"She is like that to me. She feeds every sense; and when I look in her
  eyes, Jack, I feel like the starved man on the desert, as I was saying,
  drinking that priceless water. You knew something of the way I feel, Jack.
  Isn't it a little odd that you didn't keep her here?"</p>

  <p>She had stood literally shuddering during this speech, and now she burst
  out, far beyond all control: "Because she loathes you; because she hates
  herself for ever having loved you; because she despises herself for having
  ridden up here after you. Does that fill your cup of water, Pierre, eh?"</p>

  <p>His forehead was shining with sweat, but he set his teeth, and, after a
  moment, he was able to say in the same hard, calm voice: "I suppose there was
  no real reason for her change. She can be persuaded back to me in a moment.
  In that case just tell me where she has gone and I'll ride after her."</p>

  <p>He made as if to rise, but she cried in a panic, and yet with a wild
  exultation: "No, she's done with you forever, and the more you make love to
  her now the more she'll hate you. Because she knows that when you kissed her
  before &mdash;when you kissed her&mdash;you were living with a woman."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;living with a woman?"</p>

  <p>Her voice had risen out of the whisper for the outbreak. Now it sank back
  into it.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;with me!" "With you? I see. Naturally it must have gone hard
  with her&mdash;Mary! And she wouldn't see reason even when you explained that
  you and I are like brothers?"</p>

  <p>He leaned a little toward her and just a shade of emotion came in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"When you carefully explained, Jack, with all the eloquence you could
  command, that you and I have ridden and fought and camped together like
  brothers for six years? And how I gave you your first gun? And how I've
  stayed between you and danger a thousand times? And how I've never treated
  you otherwise than as a man? And how I've given you the love of a
  blood-brother to take the place of the brother who died? And how I've kept
  you in a clean and pure respect such as a man can only give once in his
  life&mdash;and then only to his dearest friend? She wouldn't
  listen&mdash;even when you talked to her like this?"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake&mdash;Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you talked well enough to pave the way for me. You talked so
  eloquently that with a little more persuasion from me she will know and
  understand. Come, I must be gone after her. Which way did she ride&mdash;up
  or down the valley?"</p>

  <p>"You could talk to her forever and she'd never listen. Pierre, I told her
  that I was&mdash;your woman&mdash;that you'd told me of your scenes with
  her&mdash;and that we'd laughed at them together."</p>

  <p>She covered her eyes and crouched, waiting for the wrath that would fall
  on her, but he only smiled bitterly on the bowed head, saying: "Why have I
  waited so long to hear you say what I knew already? I suppose because I
  wouldn't believe until I heard the whole abominable truth from your own lips.
  Jack, why did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Won't you see? Because I've loved you always, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>"Love&mdash;you&mdash;your tiger-heart? No, but you were like a cruel,
  selfish child. You were jealous because you didn't want the toy taken away. I
  knew it. I knew that even if I rode after her it would be hopeless. Oh, God,
  how terribly you've hurt me, partner!"</p>

  <p>It wrung a little moan from her. He said after a moment: "It's only the
  ghost of a chance, but I'll have to take it. Tell me which way she rode? No?
  Then I'll try to find her."</p>

  <p>She leaped between him and the door, flinging her shoulders against it
  with a crash and standing with outspread arms to bar the way.</p>

  <p>"You must not go!"</p>

  <p>He turned his head somewhat.</p>

  <p>"Don't stand in front of me, Jack. You know I'll do what I say, and just
  now it's a bit hard for me to face you."</p>

  <p>"Pierre, I feel as if there were a hand squeezing my heart small, and
  small, and small. Pierre, I'd die for you!"</p>

  <p>"I know you would. I know you would, partner. It was only a mistake, and
  you acted the way any cold-hearted boy would act if&mdash;if someone were to
  try to steal his horse, for instance. But just now it's hard for me to look
  at you and be calm."</p>

  <p>"Don't try to be! Swear at me&mdash;curse&mdash;rave&mdash;beat me; I'd be
  glad of the blows, Pierre. I'd hold out my arms to 'em. But don't go out that
  door!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;if you found her&mdash;she's not alone."</p>

  <p>"Say that slowly. I don't understand. She's not alone?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try to tell you from the first. She started out for you with Dick
  Wilbur for a guide."</p>

  <p>"Good old Dick, God bless him! I'll fill all his pockets with gold for
  that; and he loves her, you know."</p>

  <p>"You'll never see Dick Wilbur again. On the first night they camped she
  missed him when he went for water. She went down after a while and saw the
  mark of his body on the sand. He never appeared again."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"Listen. The next morning she woke up and found that someone had taken
  care of the fire while she slept, and her pack was lashed on one of the
  saddles. She rode on that day and came at night to a camp-fire with a bed of
  boughs near it and no one in sight. She took that camp for herself and no one
  showed up.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? Someone was following her up the valley and taking care of
  the poor baby on the way. Someone who was afraid to let himself be seen.
  Perhaps it was the man who killed Dick Wilbur without a sound there beside
  the river; perhaps as Dick died he told the man who killed him about the
  lonely girl and this other man was white enough to help Mary.</p>

  <p>"But all Mary ever saw of him was that second night when she thought she
  saw a streak of white, traveling like a galloping horse, that disappeared
  over a hill and into the trees&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A streak of white&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! The white horse&mdash;McGurk!"</p>

  <p>"McGurk!" repeated Pierre stupidly; then: "And you knew she would be going
  out to him when she left this house?"</p>

  <p>"I knew&mdash;Pierre&mdash;don't look at me like that&mdash;I knew that it
  would be murder to let you cross with McGurk. You're the last of seven
  &mdash;he's a devil&mdash;no man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you let her go out into the night&mdash;to him."</p>

  <p>She clung to a last thread of hope: "If you met him and killed him with
  the luck of the cross it would bring equal bad luck on someone you
  love&mdash; on the girl, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>He was merely repeating stupidly: "You let her go out&mdash;to him
  &mdash;in the night! She's in his arms now&mdash;you devil&mdash;you tiger
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>She threw herself down and clung about his knees with hysterical
  strength.</p>

  <p>He tore the little cross from his neck and flung it into her upturned
  face.</p>

  <p>"Don't make me put my hands on you, Jack. Let me go!" There was no need to
  tear her grasp away. She crumpled and slipped sidewise to the floor. He
  leaned over and shook her violently by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Which way did she ride? Which way did they ride?"</p>

  <p>She whispered: "Down the valley, Pierre; down the valley; I swear they
  rode that way."</p>

  <p>And as she lay in a half swoon she heard the faint clatter of galloping
  hoofs over the rocks and a wild voice yelling, fainter and fainter with
  distance: "McGurk!"</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35"></a>CHAPTER 34</h2>

  <p class="first">It came back to her like a threat; it beat at her ears and
  roused her, that continually diminishing cry: "McGurk!" It went down the
  valley, and Mary Brown, and McGurk with her, perhaps, had gone up the gorge,
  but it would be a matter of a short time before Pierre le Rouge discovered
  that there was no camp- fire to be sighted in the lower valley and whirled to
  storm back up the canyon with that battle-cry: "McGurk!" still on his
  lips.</p>

  <p>And if the two met she knew the result. Seven strong men had ridden
  together, fought together, and one by one they had fallen, disappeared like
  the white smoke of the camp-fire, jerked off into thin air by the wind, until
  only one remained.</p>

  <p>How clearly she could see them all! Bud Mansie, meager, lean, with a
  shifting eye; Garry Patterson, of the red, good-natured face; Phil Branch,
  stolid and short and muscled like a giant; Handsome Dick Wilbur on his racing
  bay; Black Gandil, with his villainies from the South Seas like an invisible
  mantle of awe about him; and her father, the stalwart, gray Boone.</p>

  <p>All these had gone, and there remained only Pierre le Rouge to follow in
  the steps of the six who had gone before.</p>

  <p>She crawled to the door, feeble in mind and shuddering of body like a
  runner who has spent his last energy in a long race, and drew it open. The
  wind blew up the valley from the Old Crow, but no sound came back to her, no
  calling from Pierre; and over her rose the black pyramid of the western peak
  of the Twin Bears like a monstrous nose pointing stiffly toward the
  stars.</p>

  <p>She closed the door, dragged herself back to her feet, and stood with her
  shoulders leaning against the wall. Her weakness was not weariness&mdash;it
  was as if something had been taken from her. She wondered at herself somewhat
  vaguely. Surely she had never been like this before, with the singular
  coldness about her heart and the feeling of loss, of infinite loss.</p>

  <p>What had she lost? She began to search her mind for an answer. Then she
  smiled uncertainly, a wan, small smile. It was very clear; what she had lost
  was all interest in life and all hope for the brave tomorrow. Nothing
  remained of all those lovely dreams which she had built up by day and night
  about the figure of Pierre le Rouge. He was gone, and the bright-colored
  bubble she had blown vanished at once.</p>

  <p>She felt a slight pain at her forehead and then remembered the cross which
  Pierre had thrown into her face. Casting that away he had thrown his faintest
  chance of victory with it; it would be a slaughter, not a battle, and
  red-handed McGurk would leave one more foe behind him.</p>

  <p>But looking down she found the cross and picked up the shining bit of
  metal; it seemed as if she held the greater part of Pierre le Rouge in her
  hands. She raised the cross to her lips.</p>

  <p>When she fastened the cross about her throat it was with no exultation,
  but like one who places over his heart a last memorial of the dead; a
  consecration, like the red sign or the white which the crusaders wore on the
  covers of their shields.</p>

  <p>Then she took from her breast the spray of autumn leaves. He had not
  noticed them, yet perhaps they had helped to make him happy when he came into
  the cabin that night, so she placed the spray on the table. Next she unpinned
  the great rubies from her throat and let her eye linger over them for a
  moment. They were chosen stones, a lure and a challenge at once.</p>

  <p>The first thought of what she must do came to Jacqueline then, but not in
  an overwhelming tide&mdash;it was rather a small voice that whispered in her
  heart.</p>

  <p>Last, she took from her bosom the glove of the yellow-haired girl.
  Compared with her stanch riding gloves, how small was this! Yet, when she
  tried it, it slipped easily on her hand. This she laid in that little pile,
  for these were the things which Pierre would wish to find if by some miracle
  he came back from the battle. The spray, perhaps, he would not understand;
  and yet he might. She pressed both hands to her breast and drew a long
  breath, for her heart was breaking. Through her misted eyes she could barely
  see the shimmer of the cross.</p>

  <p>She dropped to her knees, and twisted her hands together in agony. It was
  prayer. There were no words to it, but it was prayer, a wild appeal for
  aid.</p>

  <p>That aid came in the form of a calm that swept on her like the flood of a
  clear moonlight over a storm-beaten landscape. The whisper which had come to
  her before was now a solemn-speaking voice, and she knew what she must do.
  She could not keep the two men apart, but she might reach McGurk before and
  strike him down by stealth, by craft, any way to kill that man as terrible as
  a devil, as invulnerable as a ghost.</p>

  <p>This she might do in the heart of the night, and afterward she might have
  the courage left to tell the girl the truth and then creep off somewhere and
  let this steady pain burn its way out of her heart.</p>

  <p>Once she had reached a decision, it was characteristic that she moved
  swiftly. Also, there was cause for haste, for by this time Pierre must have
  discovered that there was no one in the lower reaches of the gorge and would
  be galloping back with all the speed of the cream-colored mare which even
  McGurk's white horse could not match.</p>

  <p>She ran from the cabin and into the little lean-to behind it where the
  horses were tethered. There she swung her saddle with expert hands, whipped
  up the cinch, and pulled it with the strength of a man, mounted, and was off
  up the gorge.</p>

  <p>For the first few minutes she let the long-limbed black race on at full
  speed, a breathless course, because the beat of the wind in her face raised
  her courage, gave her a certain impulse which was almost happiness, just as
  the martyrs rejoiced and held out their hands to the fire that was to consume
  them; but after the first burst of headlong galloping, she drew down the
  speed to a hand-canter, and this in turn to a fast trot, for she dared not
  risk the far- echoed sound of the clattering hoofs over the rock.</p>

  <p>And as she rode she saw at last the winking eye of red which she longed
  for and dreaded. She pulled her black to an instant halt and swung from the
  saddle, tossing the reins over the head of the horse to keep him standing
  there.</p>

  <p>Yet, after she had made half a dozen hurried paces something forced her to
  turn and look again at the handsome head of the horse. He stood quite
  motionless, with his ears pricking after her, and now as she stopped he
  whinnied softly, hardly louder than the whisper of a man. So she ran back
  again and threw the reins over the horn of the saddle; he should be free to
  wander where he chose through the free mountains, but as for her, she knew
  very certainly now that she would never mount that saddle again, or control
  that triumphant steed with the touch of her hands on the reins. She put her
  arms around his neck and drew his head down close.</p>

  <p>There was a dignity in that parting, for it was the burning of her bridges
  behind her. She drew back, the horse followed her a pace, but she raised a
  silent hand in the night and halted him; a moment later she was lost among
  the boulders.</p>

  <p>It was rather slow work to stalk that camp-fire, for the big boulders cut
  off the sight of the red eye time and again, and she had to make little,
  cautious detours before she found it again, but she kept steadily at her
  work. Once she stopped, her blood running cold, for she thought that she
  heard a faint voice blown up the canyon on the wind: "McGurk!"</p>

  <p>For half a minute she stood frozen, listening, but the sound was not
  repeated, and she went on again with greater haste. So she came at last in
  view of a hollow in the side of the gorge. Here there were a few trees,
  growing in the cove, and here, she knew, there was a small spring of clear
  water. Many a time she had made a cup of her hands and drunk here.</p>

  <p>Now she made out the fire clearly, the trees throwing out great spokes of
  shadow on all sides, spokes of shadows that wavered and shook with the flare
  of the small fire beyond them. She dropped to her hands and knees and,
  parting the dense underbrush, began the last stealthy approach.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36"></a>CHAPTER 35</h2>

  <p class="first">Up the same course which Jacqueline followed, Mary Brown had
  fled earlier that night with the triumphant laughter of Jack still ringing in
  her ears and following her like a remorseless, pointed hand of shame.</p>

  <p>There is no power like shame to disarm the spirit. A dog will fight if a
  man laughs at him; a coward will challenge the devil himself if he is whipped
  on by scorn; and this proud girl shrank and moaned on the saddle. She had not
  progressed far enough to hate Pierre. That would come later, but now all her
  heart had room for was a consuming loathing of herself.</p>

  <p>Some of that torture went into the spurs with which she punished the side
  of the bay, and the tall horse responded with a high-tossed head and a burst
  of whirlwind speed. The result was finally a stumble over a loose rock that
  almost flung Mary over the pommel of the saddle and forced her to draw
  rein.</p>

  <p>Having slowed the pace she became aware that she was very tired from the
  trip of the day, and utterly exhausted by the wild scene with Jacqueline, so
  that she began to look about for a place where she could stop for even an
  hour or so and rest her aching body.</p>

  <p>Thought of McGurk sent her hand trembling to her holster. Still she knew
  she must have little to fear from him. He had been kind to her. Why had this
  scourge of the mountain-desert spared her? Was it to track down Pierre?</p>

  <p>It was at this time that she heard the purl and whisper of running water,
  a sound dear to the hearts of all travelers. She veered to the left and found
  the little grove of trees with a thick shrubbery growing between, fed by the
  water of that diminutive brook. She dismounted and tethered the horses.</p>

  <p>By this time she had seen enough of camping out to know how to make
  herself fairly comfortable, and she set about it methodically, eagerly. It
  was something to occupy her mind and keep out a little of that burning sense
  of shame. One picture it could not obliterate, and that was the scene of
  Jacqueline and Pierre le Rouge laughing together over the love affair with
  the silly girl of the yellow hair.</p>

  <p>That was the meaning, then, of those silences that had come between them?
  He had been thinking, remembering, careful lest he should forget a single
  scruple of the whole ludicrous affair. She shuddered, remembering how she had
  fairly flung herself into his arms.</p>

  <p>On that she brooded, after starting the little fire. It was not that she
  was cold, but the fire, at least, in the heart of the black night, was a
  friend incapable of human treachery. She had not been there long when the
  tall bay, Wilbur's horse, stiffened, raised his head, arched his tail, and
  then whinnied.</p>

  <p>She started to her feet, stirred by a thousand fears, and heard, far away,
  an answering neigh. At once all thought of shame and of Pierre le Rouge
  vanished from her mind, for she remembered the man who had followed her up
  the valley of the Old Crow. Perhaps he was coming now out of the night;
  perhaps she would even see him.</p>

  <p>And the excitement grew in her pulse by pulse, as the excitement grows in
  a man waiting for a friend at a station; he sees first the faint smoke like a
  cloud on the skyline, and then a black speck beneath the smoke, and next the
  engine draws up on him with a humming of the rails which grows at length to a
  thunder.</p>

  <p>The heart of Mary Brown beat faster, though she could not see, but only
  felt the coming of the stranger.</p>

  <p>The only sign she saw was in the horses, which showed an increasing
  uneasiness. Her own mare now shared the restlessness of the tall bay, and the
  two were footing it nervously here and there, tugging at the tethers, and
  tossing up their heads, with many a start, as if they feared and sought to
  flee from some approaching catastrophe&mdash;some vast and preternatural
  change &mdash;some forest fire which came galloping faster than even their
  fleet limbs could carry them.</p>

  <p>Yet all beyond the pale of her camp-fire's light was silence, utter and
  complete silence. It seemed as if a muscular energy went into the intensity
  of her listening, but not a sound reached her except a faint whispering of
  the wind in the dark trees above her.</p>

  <p>But at last she knew that the thing was upon her. The horses ceased their
  prancing and stared in a fixed direction through the thicket of shrubbery;
  the very wind grew hushed above her; she could feel the new presence as one
  feels the silence when a door closes and shuts away the sound of the street
  below.</p>

  <p>It came on her with a shock, thrilling, terrible, yet not altogether
  unpleasant. She rose, her hands clenched at her sides and her eyes abnormally
  wide as they stared in the same direction as the eyes of the two horses held.
  Yet for all her preparation she nearly fainted when a voice sounded directly
  behind her, a pleasantly modulated voice: "Look this way. I am here, in front
  of the fire."</p>

  <p>She turned about and the two horses, quivering, whirled toward that
  sound.</p>

  <p>She stepped back, back until the embers of the fire lay between her and
  that side of the little clearing. In spite of herself the exclamation escaped
  her&mdash;"McGurk!"</p>

  <p>The voice spoke again: "Do not be afraid. You are safe, absolutely."</p>

  <p>"What are you?" "Your friend."</p>

  <p>"Is it you who followed me up the valley?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Come into the light. I must see you." A faint laughter reached her from
  the dark.</p>

  <p>"I cannot let you do that. If that had been possible I should have come to
  you before."</p>

  <p>"But I feel&mdash;I feel almost as if you are a ghost and no man of flesh
  and blood."</p>

  <p>"It is better for you to feel that way about it," said the voice solemnly,
  "than to know me."</p>

  <p>"At least, tell me why you have followed me, why you have cared for
  me."</p>

  <p>"You will hate me if I tell you, and fear me."</p>

  <p>"No, whatever you are, trust me. Tell me at least what came to Dick
  Wilbur?"</p>

  <p>"That's easy enough. I met him at the river, a little by surprise, and
  caught him before he could even shout. Then I took his guns and let him
  go."</p>

  <p>"But he didn't come back to me?"</p>

  <p>"No. He knew that I would be there. I might have finished him without
  giving him a chance to speak, girl, but I'd seen him with you and I was
  curious. So I found out where you were going and why, and let Wilbur go. I
  came back and looked at you and found you asleep."</p>

  <p>She grew cold at the thought of him leaning over her.</p>

  <p>"I watched you a long time, and I suppose I'll remember you always as I
  saw you then. You were very beautiful with the shadow of your lashes against
  your cheek&mdash;almost as beautiful as you are now as you stand over there,
  fearing and loathing me. I dared not let you see me, but I decided to take
  care of you&mdash;for a while."</p>

  <p>"And now?"</p>

  <p>"I have come to say farewell to you."</p>

  <p>"Let me see you once before you go."</p>

  <p>"No! You see, I fear you even more than you fear me." "Then I'll follow
  you."</p>

  <p>"It would be useless&mdash;utterly useless. There are ways of becoming
  invisible in the mountains. But before I go, tell me one thing: Have you left
  the cabin to search for Pierre le Rouge in another place?"</p>

  <p>"No. I do not search for him."</p>

  <p>There was an instant of pause. Then the voice said sharply: "Did Wilbur
  lie to me?"</p>

  <p>"No. I started up the valley to find him."</p>

  <p>"But you've given him up?"</p>

  <p>"I hate him&mdash;I hate him as much as I loathe myself for ever
  condescending to follow him."</p>

  <p>She heard a quick breath drawn in the dark, and then a murmur: "I am free,
  then, to hunt him down!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Listen: I had given him up for your sake; I gave him up when I stood
  beside you that first night and watched you trembling with the cold in your
  sleep. It was a weak thing for me to do, but since I saw you, Mary, I am not
  as strong as I once was."</p>

  <p>"Now you go back on his trail? It is death for Pierre?"</p>

  <p>"You say you hate him?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but as deeply as that?" she questioned herself.</p>

  <p>"It may not be death for Pierre. I have ridden the ranges many years and
  met them all in time, but never one like him. Listen: six years ago I met him
  first and then he wounded me&mdash;the first time any man has touched me. And
  afterward I was afraid, Mary, for the first time in my life, for the charm
  was broken. For six years I could not return, but now I am at his heels. Six
  are gone; he will be the last to go."</p>

  <p>"What are you?" she cried. "Some bloodhound reincarnated?"</p>

  <p>He said: "That is the mildest name I have ever been called."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap37"
     name="chap37"></a>CHAPTER 36</h2>

  <p class="first">"Give up the trail of Pierre."</p>

  <p>And there, brought face to face with the mortal question, even her fear
  burned low in her, and once more she remembered the youth who would not leave
  her in the snow, but held her in his arms with the strange cross above
  them.</p>

  <p>She said simply: "I still love him."</p>

  <p>A faint glimmer came to her through the dark and she could see deeper into
  the shrubbery, for now the moon stood up on the top of the great peak above
  them and flung a faint light into the hollow. That glimmer she saw, but no
  face of a man.</p>

  <p>And then the silence held; every second of it was more than a hundred
  spoken words.</p>

  <p>Then the calm voice said: "I cannot give him up."</p>

  <p>"For the sake of God!"</p>

  <p>"God and I have been strangers for a good many years."</p>

  <p>"For my sake."</p>

  <p>"But you see, I have been lying to myself. I told myself that I was coming
  merely to see you once&mdash;for the last time. But after I saw you I had to
  speak, and now that I have spoken it is hard to leave you, and now that I am
  with you I cannot give you up to Pierre le Rouge."</p>

  <p>She cried: "What will you have of me?"</p>

  <p>He answered with a ring of melancholy: "Friendship? No, I can't take those
  white hands&mdash;mine are so red. All I can do is to lurk about you like a
  shadow&mdash;a shadow with a sting that strikes down all other men who come
  near you."</p>

  <p>She said: "For all men have told me about you, I know you could not do
  that."</p>

  <p>"Mary, I tell you there are things about me, and possibilities, about
  which I don't dare to question myself."</p>

  <p>"You have guarded me like a brother. Be one to me still; I have never
  needed one so deeply!"</p>

  <p>"A brother? Mary, if your eyes were less blue or your hair less golden I
  might be; but you are too beautiful to be only that to me."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she stopped in the midst of her speech, because a white head loomed
  beside the dim form. It was the head of a horse, with pricking ears, which
  now nosed the shoulder of its master, and she saw the firelight glimmering in
  the great eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your horse," she said in a trembling voice, "loves you and trusts
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is the only thing which has not feared me. When it was a colt it came
  out of the herd and nosed my hand. It is the only thing which has not fought
  me, as all men have done&mdash;as you are doing now, Mary."</p>

  <p>The wind that blew up the gorge came in gusts, not any steady current, but
  fitful rushes of air, and on one of these brief blasts it seemed to Mary that
  she caught the sound of a voice blown to whistling murmur. It was a vague
  thing of which she could not be sure, as faint as a thought. Yet the head of
  the white horse disappeared, and the glimmer of the man's face went out.</p>

  <p>She called: "Whatever you are, wait! Let me speak!"</p>

  <p>But no answer came, and she knew that the form was gone forever.</p>

  <p>She cried again: "Who's there?"</p>

  <p>"It is I," said a voice at her elbow, and she turned to look into the dark
  eyes of Jacqueline. "So he's gone?" asked Jack bitterly.</p>

  <p>She fingered the butt of her gun.</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;well, my chance at him is gone."</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bah, if you knew you'd die of fear. Listen to what I have to say. All the
  things I told you in the cabin were lies."</p>

  <p>"Lies?" said Mary evenly. "No, they proved themselves."</p>

  <p>"Be still till I've finished, because if you talk you may make me forget
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>The gesture which finished the sentence was so eloquent of hate that Mary
  shrank away and put the embers of the fire between them.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, it was all a lie, and Pierre le Rouge has never loved
  anything but you, you milk-faced&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped again, fighting against her passion. The pride of Mary held
  her stiff and straight, though her voice shook.</p>

  <p>"Has he sent you after me with mockery?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's given up the hope of you."</p>

  <p>"The hope?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? Are you going to make me crawl to explain? It always
  seemed to me that God meant Pierre for me. It always seemed to me that a girl
  like me was what he needed. But Pierre had never seen it. Maybe, if my hair
  was yellow an' my eyes blue, he might have felt different; but the way it is,
  he's always treated me like a kid brother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And lived with you?" said the other sternly.</p>

  <p>"Like two men! D'you understand how a woman could be the bunky of a man
  an' yet be no more to him than&mdash;than a man would be. You don't? Neither
  do I, but that's what I've been to Pierre le Rouge. What's that?"</p>

  <p>She lifted her head and stood poised as if for flight. Once more the vague
  sound blew up to them upon the wind. Mary ran to her and grasped both of her
  hands in her own. "If it's true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Jack snatched her hands away and looked on the other with a mighty
  hatred and a mightier contempt.</p>

  <p>"True? Why, it damn near finished Pierre with me to think he'd take up
  with&mdash;a thing like you. But it's true. If somebody else had told me I'd
  of laughed at 'em. But it's true. Tell me: what'll you do with him?"</p>

  <p>"Take him back&mdash;if I can reach him&mdash;take him back to the
  East."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;maybe he'd be happy there. But when the spring comes to the
  city, Mary, wait till the wind blows in the night and the rain comes tappin'
  on the roof. Then hold him if you can. D'ye hear? Hold him if you can!"</p>

  <p>"If he cares it will not be hard. Tell me again, if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up. What's that again?"</p>

  <p>The sound was closer now and unmistakably something other than the moan of
  the wind.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline turned in great excitement to Mary:</p>

  <p>"Did McGurk hear that sound down the gorge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I think so. And then he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Pierre, and he's calling for&mdash;d'you hear?"</p>

  <p>Clear and loud, though from a great distance, the wind carried up the
  sound and the echo preserved it: "McGurk!"</p>

  <p>"McGurk!" repeated Mary.</p>

  <p>"Yes! And you brought him up here with you, and brought his death to
  Pierre. What'll you do to save him now? Pierre!"</p>

  <p>She turned and fled out among the trees, and after her ran Mary, calling,
  like the other: "Pierre!"</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap38"
     name="chap38"></a>CHAPTER 37</h2>

  <p class="first">After that call first reached him, clear to his ears though
  vague as a murmur at the ear of Mary, McGurk swung to the saddle of his white
  horse, and galloped down the gorge like a veritable angel of death.</p>

  <p>The end was very near, he felt, yet the chances were at least ten to one
  that he would miss Pierre in the throat of the gorge, for among the great
  boulders, tall as houses, which littered it, a thousand men might have passed
  and repassed and never seen each other. Only the calling of Pierre could
  guide him surely.</p>

  <p>The calling had ceased for some moments, and he began to fear that he had
  overrun his mark and missed Pierre in the heart of the pass, when, as he
  rounded a mighty boulder, the shout ran ringing in his very ears: "McGurk!"
  and a horseman swung into view.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he called in answer, and stood with his right hand lifted,
  bringing his horse to a sharp halt, like some ancient cavalier stopping in
  the middle of the battle to exchange greetings with a friendly foe.</p>

  <p>The other rider whirled alongside, his sombrero's brim flaring back from
  his forehead, so that McGurk caught the glare of the eyes beneath the
  shadow.</p>

  <p>"So for the third time, my friend&mdash;" said McGurk.</p>

  <p>"Which is the fatal one," answered Pierre. "How will you die, McGurk? On
  foot or on horseback?"</p>

  <p>"On the ground, Pierre, for my horse might stir and make my work messy. I
  love a neat job, you know." "Good."</p>

  <p>They swung from the saddles and stood facing each other.</p>

  <p>"Begin!" commanded McGurk. "I've no time to waste."</p>

  <p>"I've very little time to look at the living McGurk. Let me look my fill
  before the end."</p>

  <p>"Then look, and be done. I've a lady coming to meet me."</p>

  <p>The other grew marvelously calm.</p>

  <p>"She is with you, McGurk?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Pierre, I've been with her ever since she started up the Old
  Crow."</p>

  <p>"It will be easier to forget her. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"So soon? Come, man, there's much for us to say. Many old times to chat
  over."</p>

  <p>"I only wonder," said Pierre, "how one death can pay back what you've
  done. Think of it! I've actually run away from you and hidden myself among
  the hills. I've feared you, McGurk!"</p>

  <p>He said it with a deep astonishment, as a grown man will speak of the way
  he feared darkness when he was a child. McGurk moistened his white lips. The
  white horse pawed the rocks as though impatient to be gone.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Pierre, "your horse grows restive. Suppose we stand here
  &mdash;it's a convenient distance apart&mdash;and wait with our arms folded
  for the next time the white horse paws the rocks, because when I kill you,
  McGurk, I want you to die knowing that another man was faster on the draw and
  straighter with his bullets than you are. D'you see?"</p>

  <p>He could not have spoken with a more formal politeness if he had been
  asking the other to pass first through the door of a dining-room. The wonder
  of McGurk grew and the sweat on his forehead seemed to be spreading a chill
  through his entire body. He said: "I see. You trust all to the cross, eh,
  Pierre? The little cross under your neck?"</p>

  <p>"It's gone," said Pierre le Rouge. "Why should I use it against a night
  rider, McGurk? Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>And McGurk, not trusting his voice for some strange reason, nodded. The
  two folded their arms.</p>

  <p>But the white horse which had been pawing the stones only a moment before
  was now unusually quiet. The very postures of the men seemed to turn him to
  stone, a beautiful, marble statue with the moonlight glistening on the
  muscles of his perfect shoulders.</p>

  <p>At length he stirred. At once a quiver jerked through the tense bodies of
  the waiting men, but the white horse had merely stiffened and raised his head
  high. Now, with arched neck and flaunting tail he neighed loudly, as if he
  asked a question. How could he know, dumb brute, that what he asked only
  death could answer?</p>

  <p>And as they waited an itching came at the palm of McGurk's hand. It was
  not much, just a tingle of the blood. To ease it, he closed his fingers and
  found that his hand was moist with cold perspiration.</p>

  <p>He began to wonder if his fingers would be slippery on the butt of the
  gun. Then he tried covertly to dry them against his shirt. But he ceased this
  again, knowing that he must be of hair-trigger alertness to watch for the
  stamp of the white horse.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him, also, that he was standing on a loose stone which
  might wobble when he pulled his gun, and he cursed himself silently for his
  hasty folly. Pierre, doubtless, had noticed that stone, and therefore he had
  made the suggestion that they stand where they were. Otherwise, how could
  there be that singular calm in the steady eyes which looked across at
  him?</p>

  <p>Also, how explain the hunger of that stare? Was not he McGurk, and was not
  this man whom he had already once shot down? God, what a fool he had been not
  to linger an instant longer in that saloon in the old days and place the
  final shot in the prostrate body! In all his life he had made only one such
  mistake, and now that folly was pursuing him. And now&mdash;</p>

  <p>The foot of the white horse lifted&mdash;struck the rock. The sound of its
  fall was lost in the explosion of two guns, and a ring of metal on metal. The
  revolver snapped from the hand of McGurk, whirled in a flashing circle, and
  clanged on the rocks at his feet. The bullet of Pierre had struck the barrel
  and knocked it cleanly from his hand.</p>

  <p>It was luck, only luck, that placed that shot, and his own bullet, which
  had started first, had traveled wild, for there stood Pierre le Rouge,
  smiling faintly, alert, calm. For the first time in his life McGurk had
  missed. He set his teeth and waited for death.</p>

  <p>But that steady voice of Pierre said: "To shoot you would be a pleasure,
  but there wouldn't be any lasting satisfaction in it. So there lies your gun
  at your feet. Well, here lies mine."</p>

  <p>He dropped his own weapon to a position corresponding with that of
  McGurk's.</p>

  <p>"We were both very wild that time. We must do better now. We'll stoop for
  our guns, McGurk. The signal? No, we won't wait for the horse to stamp. The
  signal will be when you stoop for your gun. You shall have every advantage,
  you see? Start for that gun, McGurk, when you're ready for the end."</p>

  <p>The hand of McGurk stretched out and his arm stiffened but it seemed as
  though all the muscles of his back had grown stiff. He could not bend. It was
  strange. It was both ludicrous and incomprehensible. Perhaps he had grown
  stiff with cold in that position.</p>

  <p>But he heard the voice of Pierre explaining gently: "You can't move, my
  friend. I understand. It's fear that stiffened your back. It's fear that
  sends the chill up and down your blood. It's fear that makes you think back
  to your murders, one by one. McGurk, you're done for. You're through. You're
  ready for the discard. I'm not going to kill you. I've thought of a finer
  hell than death, and that is to live as you shall live. I've beaten you,
  McGurk, beaten you fairly on the draw, and I've broken your heart by doing
  it. The next time you face a man you'll begin to think&mdash;you'll begin to
  remember how one other man beat you at the draw. And that wonder, McGurk,
  will make your hand freeze to your side, as you've made the hands of other
  men before me freeze. D'you understand?"</p>

  <p>The lips of McGurk parted. The whisper of his dry panting reached Pierre,
  and the devil in him smiled.</p>

  <p>"In six weeks, McGurk, you'll be finished. Now get out!"</p>

  <p>And pace by pace McGurk drew back, with his face still toward Pierre.</p>

  <p>The latter cried: "Wait. Are you going to leave your gun?"</p>

  <p>Only the steady retreat continued.</p>

  <p>"And go unarmed through the mountains? What will men say when they see
  McGurk with an empty holster?"</p>

  <p>But the outlaw had passed out of view beyond the corner of one of the
  monster boulders. After him went the white horse, slowly, picking his steps,
  as if he were treading on dangerous and unknown ground and would not trust
  his leader. Pierre was left to the loneliness of the gorge.</p>

  <p>The moonlight only served to make more visible its rocky nakedness, and
  like that nakedness was the life of Pierre under his hopeless inward eye.
  Over him loomed from either side the gleaming pinnacles of the Twin Bears,
  and he remembered many a time when he had looked up toward them from the
  crests of lesser mountains&mdash;looked up toward them as a man looks to a
  great and unattainable ideal. Here he was come to the crest of all the
  ranges; here he was come to the height and limit of his life, and what had he
  attained? Only a cruel, cold isolation. It had been a steep ascent; the
  declivity of the farther side led him down to a steep and certain ruin and
  the dark night below. But he stiffened suddenly and threw his head high as if
  he faced his fate; and behind him the cream-colored mare raised her head with
  a toss and whinnied softly.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that he had heard something calling, for the sound was
  lost against the sweep of wind coming up the gorge. Something calling there
  in the night of the mountains as he himself had called when he rode so wildly
  in the quest for McGurk. How long ago had that been?</p>

  <p>But it came once more, clear beyond all doubt. He recognized the voice in
  spite of the panting which shook it; a wild wail like that of a heartbroken
  child, coming closer to him like someone running: "Pierre! Oh, Pierre!"</p>

  <p>And all at once he knew that the moon was broad and bright and fair, and
  the heavens clear and shining with gold points of light. Once more the cry.
  He raised his arms and waited.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap39"
     name="chap39"></a>CHAPTER 38</h2>

  <p class="first">So Mary, running through the wilderness of boulders, was
  guided straight and found Pierre, and before the morning came, they were
  journeying east side by side, east and down to the cities and a new life; but
  Jacqueline, a thousand times quicker of foot and surer of eye and ear, missed
  her goal, went past it, and still on and on, running finally at a steady
  trot.</p>

  <p>Until at last she knew that she had far overstepped her mark and sank down
  against one of the rocks to rest and think out what next she must do. There
  seemed nothing left. Even the sound of a gun fired she might not hear, for
  that sharp call would not travel far against the wind.</p>

  <p>It was while she sat there, burying Pierre in her thoughts, a white shape
  came glimmering down to her through the moonlight. She was on her feet at
  once, alert and gun in hand. It could only be one horse, only one rider,
  McGurk coming down from his last killing with the sneer on his pale lips.
  Well, he would complete his work this night and kill her fighting face to
  face.</p>

  <p>A man's death; that was all she craved. She rose; she stepped boldly out
  into the center of the trail between the rocks.</p>

  <p>There she saw the greatest wonder she had ever looked on. It was McGurk
  walking with bare, bowed head, and after him, like a dog after the master,
  followed the white horse. She shoved the revolver back into the holster. This
  should be a fair fight.</p>

  <p>"McGurk!"</p>

  <p>Very slowly the head went up and back, and there he stood, not ten paces
  from her, with the white moon full on his face. The sneer was still there;
  the eyelid fluttered in scornful derision. And the heart of Jacqueline came
  thundering in her throat.</p>

  <p>But she cried in a strong voice: "McGurk, d'you know me?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"You murderer, you night rider! Look again: it's the last of the
  Boones!"</p>

  <p>The sneer, it seemed to her, grew bitterer, but still the man did not
  speak. Then the thought of Pierre, lying dead somewhere among the rocks,
  burned across her mind. Her hand leaped for the revolver, and whipped it out
  in a blinding flash to cover him, but with her finger curling on the trigger
  she checked herself in the nick of time. McGurk had made no move to protect
  himself.</p>

  <p>A strange feeling came to her that perhaps the man would not war against
  women; the case of Mary was almost proof enough of that. But as she stepped
  forward, wondering, she looked at the holster at his side and saw that it was
  empty. Then she understood.</p>

  <p>Understood in a daze that Pierre had met the man and conquered him and
  sent him out through the mountains disarmed. The white horse raised his head
  and whinnied, and the sound gave a thought to her. She could not kill this
  man, unarmed as he was; she could do a more shameful thing.</p>

  <p>"The bluff you ran was a strong one, McGurk," she said bitterly, "and you
  had these parts pretty well at a standstill; but Pierre was a bit too much
  for you, eh?"</p>

  <p>The white face had not altered, and still it did not change, but the sneer
  was turned steadily on her.</p>

  <p>She cried: "Go on! Go on down the gorge!"</p>

  <p>Like an automaton the man stepped forward, and after him paced the white
  horse. She stepped between, caught the reins, and swung up to the saddle, and
  sat there, controlling between her stirrups the best-known mount in all the
  mountain-desert. A thrill of wild exultation came to her. She cried: "Look
  back, McGurk! Your gun is gone, your horse is gone; you're weaker than a
  woman in the mountains!"</p>

  <p>Yet he went on without turning, not with the hurried step of a coward, but
  still as one stunned. Then, sitting quietly in the saddle, she forgot McGurk
  and remembered Pierre. He was happy by this time with the girl of the yellow
  hair; there was nothing remaining to her from him except the ominous cross
  which touched cold against her breast. That he had abandoned as he had
  abandoned her.</p>

  <p>What, then, was left for her? The horse of an outlaw for her to ride; the
  heart of an outlaw in her breast.</p>

  <p>She touched the white horse with the spurs and went at a reckless gallop,
  weaving back and forth among the boulders down the forge. For she was riding
  away from the past.</p>

  <p>The dawn came as she trotted out into a widening valley of the Old Crow.
  To maintain even that pace she had to use the spurs continually, for the
  white horse was deadly weary, and his head fell more and more. She decided to
  make a brief halt, at last, and in order to make a fire that would take the
  chill of the cold morning from her, she swung up to the edge of the woods.
  There, before she could dismount, she saw a man turn the shoulder of the
  slope. She drew the horse back deeper among the trees and waited.</p>

  <p>He came with a halting step, reeling now and again, a big man, hatless,
  coatless, apparently at the last verge of exhaustion. Now his foot apparently
  struck a small rock, and he pitched to his face. It required a long struggle
  before he could regain his feet; and now he continued his journey at the same
  gait, only more uncertainly than ever, close and closer. There was something
  familiar now about the fellow's size, and something in the turn of his head.
  Suddenly she rode out, crying: "Wilbur!"</p>

  <p>He swerved, saw the white horse, threw up his hands high above his head,
  and went backward, reeling, with a hoarse scream which Jacqueline would never
  forget. She galloped to him and swung to the ground.</p>

  <p>"It's me&mdash;Jack. D'you hear?"</p>

  <p>He would not lower those arms, and his eyes stared wildly at her. On his
  forehead the blood had caked over a cut; his shirt was torn to rags, and the
  hair matted over his eyes. She caught his hands and pulled them down.</p>

  <p>"It's not McGurk! Don't you hear me? It's Jack!"</p>

  <p>He reached out, like a blind man who has to see by the sense of touch, and
  stroked her face.</p>

  <p>"Jack!" he whispered at last. "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>"What's happened?"</p>

  <p>"McGurk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A violent palsy shook him, and he could not go on.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I understand. He took your guns and left you to wander in
  this hell! Damn him! I wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped.</p>

  <p>"How long since you've eaten?"</p>

  <p>"Years!"</p>

  <p>"We'll eat&mdash;McGurk's food!"</p>

  <p>But she had to assist him up the slope to the trees, and there she left
  him propped against a trunk, his arms fallen weakly at his sides, while she
  built the fire and cooked the food. Afterward she could hardly eat, watching
  him devour what she placed before him; and it thrilled all the woman in her
  to a strange warmth to take care of the long-rider. Then, except for the
  disfigured face and the bloodshot eyes, he was himself.</p>

  <p>"Up there? What happened?"</p>

  <p>He pointed up the valley.</p>

  <p>"The girl and Pierre. They're together."</p>

  <p>"She found him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He bowed his head and sighed.</p>

  <p>"And the horse, Jack?" He said it with awe.</p>

  <p>"I took the horse from McGurk."</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>She nodded. After all, it was not a lie. "You killed McGurk?"</p>

  <p>She said coolly: "I let him go the way he let you, Dick. He's on foot in
  the mountains without a horse or a gun."</p>

  <p>"It isn't possible!"</p>

  <p>"There's the horse for proof."</p>

  <p>He looked at her as if she were something more than human.</p>

  <p>"Our Jack&mdash;did this?"</p>

  <p>"We've got to start on. Can you walk, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand miles now."</p>

  <p>Yet he staggered when he tried to rise, and she made him climb up to the
  saddle. The white horse walked on, and she kept her place close at the
  stirrup of the rider. He would have stopped and dismounted for her a hundred
  times, but she made him keep his place.</p>

  <p>"What's ahead of us, Jack? We're the last of the gang?"</p>

  <p>"The last of Boone's gang. We are."</p>

  <p>"The old life over again?"</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; what else?"</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Not with you for a pal. Seven was too many; with two we can rule the
  range."</p>

  <p>"Partners, Dick?"</p>

  <p>How could he tell that her voice was gone so gentle because she was seeing
  in her mind's eye another face than his? He leaned toward her.</p>

  <p>"Why not something more than partners, after a while, Jack?"</p>

  <p>She smiled strangely up to him.</p>

  <p>"Because of this, Dick."</p>

  <p>And fumbling at her throat, she showed him the glittering metal of the
  cross.</p>

  <p>"The cross goes on, but what of you, Jack?" A long silence fell between
  them. Words died in the making.</p>

  <p>The great weight pressing down on that slender throat was like the iron
  hand of a giant, but slowly, one by one, the sounds marshalled
  themselves:</p>

  <p>"God knows" It was the passing of Judgment. "God knows&mdash;not I."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap40"
     name="chap40">EPILOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But what of the legendary gunfighter, McGurk? How could the
  spirit of any man survive that terrible defeat at the hands of Red
  Pierre?</p>

  <p>After that night, when he had walked from the dark heart of the mountain
  without horse or gun, head bowed, eyes glazed, it seemed that the life of Bob
  McGurk had burned down to black ash.</p>

  <p>Indeed, no one heard of him for five long years. Then, phoenix-like, he
  was reborn in fire, emerging in the raw border country of Texas. His rebirth
  was spectacular. No longer the lone phantom fighter of past days, he led a
  gang of coldhearted thieves and killers that became the scourge of the Rio
  Grande.</p>

  <p>But McGurk never returned to the mountain-desert country of his shame and
  defeat. And only he knew that the face of Red Pierre never left him; it
  blazed in his mind by day and haunted his nights.</p>

  <p>Then, as suddenly as he had reappeared, after proving his skill and
  courage afresh in a score of wild, bullet-filled encounters, the great
  gunfighter vanished from the world of civilized men. His gang dispersed and
  the border country saw no more of him.</p>

  <p>McGurk was finally gone.</p>

  <p>Only the legend remained.</p>
