  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

  <p class="first">Of the four men, Hal Sinclair was the vital spirit. In the
  actual labor of mining, the mighty arms and tireless back Of Quade had been a
  treasure. For knowledge of camping, hunting, cooking, and all the lore of the
  trail, Lowrie stood as a valuable resource; and Sandersen was the dreamy,
  resolute spirit, who had hoped for gold in those mountains until he came to
  believe his hope. He had gathered these three stalwarts to help him to his
  purpose, and if he lived he would lead yet others to failure.</p>

  <p>Hope never died in this tall, gaunt man, with a pale-blue eye the color of
  the horizon dusted with the first morning mist. He was the very spirit of
  lost causes, full of apprehensions, foreboding, superstitions. A hunch might
  make him journey five hundred miles; a snort of his horse could make him give
  up the trail and turn back.</p>

  <p>But Hal Sinclair was the antidote for Sandersen. He was still a boy at
  thirty&mdash;big, handsome, thoughtless, with a heart as clean as new snow.
  His throat was so parched by that day's ride that he dared not open his lips
  to sing, as he usually did. He compromised by humming songs new and old, and
  when his companions cursed his noise, he contented himself with talking
  softly to his horse, amply rewarded when the pony occasionally lifted a tired
  ear to the familiar voice.</p>

  <p>Failure and fear were the blight on the spirit of the rest. They had found
  no gold worth looking at twice, and, lingering too long in the search, they
  had rashly turned back on a shortcut across the desert. Two days before, the
  blow had fallen. They found Sawyer's water hole nearly dry, just a little
  pool in the center, with caked, dead mud all around it. They drained that
  water dry and struck on. Since then the water famine had gained a hold on
  them; another water hole had not a drop in it. Now they could only aim at the
  cool, blue mockery of the mountains before them, praying that the ponies
  would last to the foothills.</p>

  <p>Still Hal Sinclair could sing softly to his horse and to himself; and,
  though his companions cursed his singing, they blessed him for it in their
  hearts. Otherwise the white, listening silence of the desert would have
  crushed them; otherwise the lure of the mountains would have maddened them
  and made them push on until the horses would have died within five miles of
  the labor; otherwise the pain in their slowly swelling throats would have
  taken their reason. For thirst in the desert carries the pangs of several
  deaths&mdash; death from fire, suffocation, and insanity.</p>

  <p>No wonder the three scowled at Hal Sinclair when he drew his revolver.</p>

  <p>"My horse is gun-shy," he said, "but I'll bet the rest of you I can drill
  a horn off that skull before you do."</p>

  <p>Of course it was a foolish challenge. Lowrie was the gun expert of the
  party. Indeed he had reached that dangerous point of efficiency with firearms
  where a man is apt to reach for his gun to decide an argument. Now Lowrie
  followed the direction of Sinclair's gesture. It was the skull of a steer,
  with enormous branching horns. The rest of the skeleton was sinking into the
  sands.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk fool talk," said Lowrie. "Save your wind and your ammunition.
  You may need 'em for yourself, son!"</p>

  <p>That grim suggestion made Sandersen and Quade shudder. But a grin spread
  on the broad, ugly face of Lowrie, and Sinclair merely shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I'll try you for a dollar."</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Five dollars?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"You're afraid to try, Lowrie!"</p>

  <p>It was a smiling challenge, but Lowrie flushed. He had a childish pride in
  his skill with weapons.</p>

  <p>"All right, kid. Get ready!"</p>

  <p>He brought a Colt smoothly into his hand and balanced it dexterously,
  swinging it back and forth between his eyes and the target to make ready for
  a snap shot.</p>

  <p>"Ready!" cried Hal Sinclair excitedly.</p>

  <p>Lowrie's gun spoke first, and it was the only one that was fired, for
  Sinclair's horse was gun-shy indeed. At the explosion he pitched straight
  into the air with a squeal of mustang fright and came down bucking. The
  others forgot to look for the results of Lowrie's shot. They reined their
  horses away from the pitching broncho disgustedly. Sinclair was a fool to use
  up the last of his mustang's strength in this manner. But Hal Sinclair had
  forgotten the journey ahead. He was rioting in the new excitement cheering
  the broncho to new exertions. And it was in the midst of that flurry of
  action that the great blow fell. The horse stuck his right forefoot into a
  hole.</p>

  <p>To the eyes of the others it seemed to happen slowly. The mustang was
  halted in the midst of a leap, tugged at a leg that seemed glued to the
  ground, and then buckled suddenly and collapsed on one side. They heard that
  awful, muffled sound of splintering bone and then the scream of the tortured
  horse.</p>

  <p>But they gave no heed to that. Hal Sinclair in the fall had been pinned
  beneath his mount. The huge strength of Quade sufficed to budge the writhing
  mustang. Lowrie and Sandersen drew Sinclair's pinioned right leg clear and
  stretched him on the sand.</p>

  <p>It was Lowrie who shot the horse.</p>

  <p>"You've done a brown turn," said Sandersen fiercely to the prostrate
  figure of Sinclair. "Four men and three hosses. A fine partner you are,
  Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Hal. "Do something for that foot of mine."</p>

  <p>Lowrie cut the boot away dexterously and turned out the foot. It was
  painfully twisted to one side and lay limp on the sand.</p>

  <p>"Do something!" said Sinclair, groaning.</p>

  <p>The three looked at him, at the dead horse, at the white-hot desert, at
  the distant, blue mountains.</p>

  <p>"What the devil can we do? You've spoiled all our chances, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Ride on then and forget me! But tie up that foot before you go. I can't
  stand it!"</p>

  <p>Silently, with ugly looks, they obeyed. Secretly every one of the three
  was saying to himself that this folly of Sinclair's had ruined all their
  chances of getting free from the sands alive. They looked across at the skull
  of the steer. It was still there, very close. It seemed to have grown larger,
  with a horrible significance. And each instinctively put a man's skull beside
  it, bleached and white, with shadow eyes. Quade did the actual bandaging of
  Sinclair's foot, drawing tight above the ankle, so that some of the
  circulation was shut off; but it eased the pain, and now Sinclair sat up.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said, "mighty sorry, boys!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He saw by their lowered eyes that they were hating
  him. He felt it in the savage grip of their hands, as they lifted him and put
  him into Quade's saddle. Quade was the largest, and it was mutely accepted
  that he should be the first to walk, while Sinclair rode. It was accepted by
  all except Quade, that is to say. That big man strode beside his horse,
  lifting his eyes now and then to glare remorselessly at Sinclair.</p>

  <p>It was bitter work walking through that sand. The heel crunched into it,
  throwing a strain heavily on the back of the thigh, and then the ball of the
  foot slipped back in the midst of a stride. Also the labor raised the
  temperature of the body incredibly. With no wind stirring it was
  suffocating.</p>

  <p>And the day was barely beginning!</p>

  <p>Barely two hours before the sun had been merely a red ball on the edge of
  the desert. Now it was low in the sky, but bitterly hot. And their mournful
  glances presaged the horror that was coming in the middle of the day.</p>

  <p>Deadly silence fell on that group. They took their turns by the watch,
  half an hour at a time, walking and then changing horses, and, as each man
  took his turn on foot, he cast one long glance of hatred at Sinclair.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to know them for the first time. They were chance
  acquaintances. The whole trip had been undertaken by him on the spur of the
  moment; and, as far as lay in his cheery, thoughtless nature, he had come to
  regret it. The work of the trail had taught him that he was mismated in this
  company, and the first stern test was stripping the masks from them. He saw
  three ugly natures, three small, cruel souls.</p>

  <p>It came Sandersen's turn to walk.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I could take a turn walking," suggested Sinclair.</p>

  <p>It was the first time in his life that he had had to shift any burden onto
  the shoulders of another except his brother, and that was different. Ah, how
  different! He sent up one brief prayer for Riley Sinclair. There was a man
  who would have walked all day that his brother might ride, and at the end of
  the day that man of iron would be as fresh as those who had ridden. Moreover,
  there would have been no questions, no spite, but a free giving. Mutely he
  swore that he would hereafter judge all men by the stern and honorable spirit
  of Riley.</p>

  <p>And then that sad offer: "Maybe I could take a turn walking, Sandersen. I
  could hold on to a stirrup and hop along some way!"</p>

  <p>Lowrie and Quade sneered, and Sandersen retorted fiercely: "Shut up! You
  know it ain't possible, but I ought to call your bluff."</p>

  <p>He had no answer, for it was not possible. The twisted foot was a steady
  torture.</p>

  <p>In another half hour he asked for water, as they paused for Sandersen to
  mount, and Lowrie to take his turn on foot. Sandersen snatched the canteen
  which Quade reluctantly passed to the injured man.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" said Sandersen. "We got to split up on this. You sit there
  and ride and take it easy. Me and the rest has to go through hell. You take
  some of the hell yourself. You ride, but we'll have the water, and they ain't
  much of it left at that!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair glanced helplessly at the others. Their faces were set in stern
  agreement.</p>

  <p>Slowly the sun crawled up to the center of the sky and stuck there for
  endless hours, it seemed, pouring down a fiercer heat. And the foothills
  still wavered in blue outlines that meant distance&mdash;terrible
  distance.</p>

  <p>Out of the east came a cloud of dust. The restless eye of Sandersen saw it
  first, and a harsh shout of joy came from the others. Quade was walking. He
  lifted his arms to the cloud of dust as if it were a vision of mercy. To Hal
  Sinclair it seemed that cold water was already running over his tongue and
  over the hot torment of his foot. But, after that first cry of hoarse joy, a
  silence was on the others, and gradually he saw a shadow gather.</p>

  <p>"It ain't wagons," said Lowrie bitterly at length. "And it ain't riders;
  it comes too fast for that. And it ain't the wind; it comes too slow. But it
  ain't men. You can lay to that!"</p>

  <p>Still they hoped against hope until the growing cloud parted and lifted
  enough for them to see a band of wild horses sweeping along at a steady lope.
  They sighted the men and veered swiftly to the left. A moment later there was
  only a thin trail of flying dust before the four. Three pairs of eyes turned
  on Sinclair and silently cursed him as if this were his fault.</p>

  <p>"Those horses are aiming at water," he said. "Can't we follow 'em?"</p>

  <p>"They're aiming for a hole fifty miles away. No, we can't follow 'em!"</p>

  <p>They started on again, and now, after that cruel moment of hope, it was
  redoubled labor. Quade was cursing thickly with every other step. When it
  came his turn to ride he drew Lowrie to one side, and they conversed long
  together, with side glances at Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Vaguely he guessed the trend of their conversation, and vaguely he
  suspected their treacherous meanness. Yet he dared not speak, even had his
  pride permitted.</p>

  <p>It was the same story over again when Lowrie walked. Quade rode aside with
  Sandersen, and again, with the wolfish side glances, they eyed the injured
  man, while they talked. At the next halt they faced him. Sandersen was the
  spokesman.</p>

  <p>"We've about made up our minds, Hal," he said deliberately, "that you got
  to be dropped behind for a time. We're going on to find water. When we find
  it we'll come back and get you. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair moistened his lips, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>Then Sandersen's voice grew screechy with sudden passion. "Say, do you
  want three men to die for one? Besides, what good could we do?"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean it," declared Sinclair. "Sandersen, you don't mean it! Not
  alone out here! You boys can't leave me out here stranded. Might as well
  shoot me!"</p>

  <p>All were silent. Sandersen looked to Lowrie, and the latter stared at the
  sand. It was Quade who acted.</p>

  <p>Stepping to the side of Sinclair he lifted him easily in his powerful arms
  and lowered him to the sands. "Now, keep your nerve," he advised. "We're
  coming back."</p>

  <p>He stumbled a little over the words. "It's all of us or none of us," he
  said. "Come on, boys. <i>My</i> conscience is clear!"</p>

  <p>They turned their horses hastily to the hills, and, when the voice of
  Sinclair rang after them, not one dared turn his head.</p>

  <p>"Partners, for the sake of all the work we've done together&mdash;don't do
  this!"</p>

  <p>In a shuddering unison they spurred their horses and raised the weary
  brutes into a gallop; the voice faded into a wail behind them. And still they
  did not look back.</p>

  <p>For that matter they dared not look at one another, but pressed on, their
  eyes riveted to the hills. Once Lowrie turned his head to mark the position
  of the sun. Once Sandersen, in the grip of some passion of remorse or of fear
  of death, bowed his head with a strange moan. But, aside from that, there was
  no sound or sign between them until, hardly an hour and a half after leaving
  Sinclair, they found water.</p>

  <p>At first they thought it was a mirage. They turned away from it by mutual
  assent. But the horses had scented drink, and they became unmanageable. Five
  minutes later the animals were up to their knees in the muddy water, and the
  men were floundering breast deep, drinking, drinking, drinking.</p>

  <p>After that they sat about the brink staring at one another in a stunned
  fashion. There seemed no joy in that delivery, for some reason.</p>

  <p>"I guess Sinclair will be a pretty happy gent when he sees us coming
  back," said Sandersen, smiling faintly.</p>

  <p>There was no response from the others for a moment. Then they began to
  justify themselves hotly.</p>

  <p>"It was your idea, Quade."</p>

  <p>"Why, curse your soul, weren't you glad to take the idea? Are you going to
  blame it on to me?"</p>

  <p>"What's the blame?" asked Lowrie. "Ain't we going to bring him water?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose he ever tells we left him? We'd have to leave these parts
  pronto!"</p>

  <p>"He'll never tell. We'll swear him."</p>

  <p>"If he does talk, I'll stop him pretty sudden," said Lowrie, tapping his
  holster significantly.</p>

  <p>"Will you? What if he puts that brother of his on your trail?"</p>

  <p>Lowrie swallowed hard. "Well&mdash;" he began, but said no more.</p>

  <p>They mounted in a new silence and took the back trail slowly. Not until
  the evening began to fall did they hurry, for fear the darkness would make
  them lose the position of their comrade. When they were quite near the place,
  the semidarkness had come, and Quade began to shout in his tremendous voice.
  Then they would listen, and sometimes they heard an echo, or a voice like an
  echo, always at a great distance.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's started crawling and gone the wrong way. He should have sat
  still," said Lowrie, "because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord," broke in Sandersen, "I knew it! I been seeing it all the way!"
  He pointed to a figure of a man lying on his back in the sand, with his arms
  thrown out crosswise. They dismounted and found Hal Sinclair dead and cold.
  Perhaps the insanity of thirst had taken him; perhaps he had figured it out
  methodically that it was better to end things before the madness came. There
  was a certain stern repose about his face that favored this supposition. He
  seemed much older. But, whatever the reason, Hal Sinclair had shot himself
  cleanly through the head.</p>

  <p>"You see that face?" asked Lowrie with curious quiet. "Take a good look.
  You'll see it ag'in."</p>

  <p>A superstitious horror seized on Sandersen. "What d'you mean, Lowrie? What
  d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean this! The way he looks now he's a ringer for Riley Sinclair. And,
  you mark me, we're all going to see Riley Sinclair, face to face, before we
  die!"</p>

  <p>"He'll never know," said Quade, the stolid. "Who knows except us? And will
  one of us ever talk?" He laughed at the idea.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," whispered Sandersen. "I dunno, gents. But we done an awful
  thing, and we're going to pay&mdash;we're going to pay!"</p>

  <p class="first">Their trails divided after that. Sandersen and Quade started
  back for Sour Creek. At the parting of the ways Lowrie's last word was for
  Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"You started this party, Sandersen. If they's any hell coming out of it,
  it'll fall chiefly on you. Remember, because I got one of your own
  hunches!"</p>

  <p>After that Lowrie headed straight across the mountains, traveling as much
  by instinct as by landmarks. He was one of those men who are born to the
  trail. He stopped in at Four Pines, and there he told the story on which he
  and Sandersen and Quade had agreed. Four Pines would spread that tale by
  telegraph, and Riley Sinclair would be advised beforehand. Lowrie had no
  desire to tell the gunfighter in person of the passing of Hal Sinclair.
  Certainly he would not be the first man to tell the story.</p>

  <p>He reached Colma late in the afternoon, and a group instantly formed
  around him on the veranda of the old hotel. Four Pines had indeed spread the
  story, and the crowd wanted verification. He replied as smoothly as he could.
  Hal Sinclair had broken his leg in a fall from his horse, and they had bound
  it up as well as they could. They had tied him on his horse, but he could not
  endure the pain of travel. They stopped, nearly dying from thirst.
  Mortification set in. Hal Sinclair died in forty-eight hours after the
  halt.</p>

  <p>Four Pines had accepted the tale. There had been more deadly stories than
  this connected with the desert. But Pop Hansen, the proprietor, drew Lowrie
  to one side.</p>

  <p>"Keep out of Riley's way for a while. He's all het up. He was fond of Hal,
  you know, and he takes this bad. Got an ugly way of asking questions, and
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The truth is the truth," protested Lowrie. "Besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I know. But jest make yourself scarce for a couple of
  days."</p>

  <p>"I'll keep on going, Pop. Thanks!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind, ain't no hurry. Riley's out of town and won't be back for a
  day or so. But, speaking personal, I'd rather step into a nest of rattlers
  than talk to Riley, the way he's feeling now."</p>

  <p>Lowrie climbed slowly up the stairs to his room, thinking very hard. He
  knew the repute of Riley Sinclair, and he knew the man to be even worse than
  reputation, one of those stern souls who exact an eye for an eye&mdash;and
  even a little more.</p>

  <p>Once in his room he threw himself on his bed. After all there was no need
  for a panic. No one would ever learn the truth. To make surety doubly sure he
  would start early in the dawn and strike out for far trails. The thought had
  hardly come to him when he dismissed it. A flight would call down suspicion
  on him, and Riley Sinclair would be the first to suspect. In that case
  distance would not save him, not from that hard and tireless rider.</p>

  <p>To help compose his thoughts he went to the washstand and bathed his hot
  face. He was drying himself when there was a tap on the door.</p>

  <p>"Can I come in?" asked a shrill voice.</p>

  <p>He answered in the affirmative, and a youngster stepped into the room.</p>

  <p>"You're Lowrie?"</p>

  <p>"Yep."</p>

  <p>"They's a gent downstairs wants you to come down and see him."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. We just moved in from Conway. I can point him out to you on the
  street."</p>

  <p>Lowrie followed the boy to the window, and there, surrounded by half a
  dozen serious-faced men, stood Riley Sinclair, tall, easy, formidable. The
  sight of Sinclair filled Lowrie with dismay. Pushing a silver coin into the
  hand of the boy, he said: "Tell him&mdash;tell him&mdash;I'm coming right
  down."</p>

  <p>As soon as the boy disappeared, Lowrie ran to the window which opened on
  the side of the house. When he looked down his hope fled. At one time there
  had been a lean-to shed running along that side of the building. By the roof
  of it he could have got to the ground unseen. Now he remembered that it had
  been torn down the year before; there was a straight and perilous drop
  beneath the window. As for the stairs, they led almost to the front door of
  the building. Sinclair would be sure to see him if he went down there.</p>

  <p>Of the purpose of the big man he had no doubt. His black guilt was so
  apparent to his own mind that it seemed impossible that the keen eyes of
  Sinclair had not looked into the story of Hal's broken leg and seen a lie.
  Besides, the invitation through a messenger seemed a hollow lure. Sinclair
  wished to fight him and kill him before witnesses who would attest that
  Lowrie had been the first to go for his gun.</p>

  <p>Fight? Lowrie looked down at his hand and found that the very wrist was
  quivering. Even at his best he felt that he would have no chance. Once he had
  seen Sinclair in action in Lew Murphy's old saloon, had seen Red Jordan get
  the drop, and had watched Sinclair shoot his man deliberately through the
  shoulder. Red Jordan was a cripple for life.</p>

  <p>Suppose he walked boldly down, told his story, and trusted to the skill of
  his lie? No, he knew his color would pale if he faced Sinclair. Suppose he
  refused to fight? Better to die than be shamed in the mountain country.</p>

  <p>He hurried to the window for another look into the street, and he found
  that Sinclair had disappeared. Lowrie's knees buckled under his weight. He
  went over to the bed, with short steps like a drunken man, and lowered
  himself down on it.</p>

  <p>Sinclair had gone into the hotel, and doubtless that meant that he had
  grown impatient. The fever to kill was burning in the big man. Then Lowrie
  heard a steady step come regularly up the stairs. They creaked under a heavy
  weight.</p>

  <p>Lowrie drew his gun. It caught twice; finally he jerked it out in a
  frenzy. He would shoot when the door opened, without waiting, and then trust
  to luck to fight his way through the men below.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the muzzle of the revolver wabbled crazily from side to
  side, up and down. He clutched the barrel with the other hand. And still the
  weapon shook.</p>

  <p>Curling up his knee before his breast he ground down with both hands. That
  gave him more steadiness; but would not this contorted position destroy all
  chance of shooting accurately? His own prophecy, made over the dead body of
  Hal Sinclair, that all three of them would see that face again, came back to
  him with a sense of fatality. Some forward-looking instinct, he assured
  himself, had given him that knowledge.</p>

  <p>The step upon the stairs came up steadily. But the mind of Lowrie, between
  the steps, leaped hither and yon, a thousand miles and back. What if his
  nerve failed him at the last moment? What if he buckled and showed yellow and
  the shame of it followed him? Better a hundred times to die by his own
  hand.</p>

  <p>Excitement, foreboding, the weariness of the long trail&mdash;all were
  working upon Lowrie.</p>

  <p>Nearer drew the step. It seemed an hour since he had first heard it begin
  to climb the stairs. It sounded heavily on the floor outside his door. There
  was a heavy tapping on the door itself. For an instant the clutch of Lowrie
  froze around his gun; then he twitched the muzzle back against his own breast
  and fired.</p>

  <p>There was no pain&mdash;only a sense of numbness and a vague feeling of
  torn muscles, as if they were extraneous matter. He dropped the revolver on
  the bed and pressed both hands against his wound. Then the door opened, and
  there appeared, not Riley Sinclair, but Pop Hansen.</p>

  <p>"What in thunder&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Get Riley Sinclair. There's been an accident," said Lowrie faintly and
  huskily. "Get Riley Sinclair; quick. I got something to say to him."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

  <p class="first">Riley Sinclair rode over the mountain. An hour of stern
  climbing lay behind him, but it was not sympathy for his tired horse that
  made him draw rein. Sympathy was not readily on tap in Riley's nature.
  "Hossflesh" to Riley was purely and simply a means to an end. Neither had he
  paused to enjoy that mystery of change which comes over mountains between
  late afternoon and early evening. His keen eyes answered all his purposes,
  and that they had never learned to see blue in shadows meant nothing to Riley
  Sinclair.</p>

  <p>If he looked kindly upon the foothills, which stepped down from the peaks
  to the valley lands, it was because they meant an easy descent. Riley took
  thorough stock of his surroundings, for it was a new country. Yonder, where
  the slant sun glanced and blinked on windows, must be Sour Creek; and there
  was the road to town jagging across the hills. Riley sighed.</p>

  <p>In his heart he despised that valley. There were black patches of plowed
  land. A scattering of houses began in the foothills and thickened toward Sour
  Creek. How could men remain there, where there was so little elbow room? He
  scowled down into the shadow of the valley. Small country, small men.</p>

  <p>Pictures failed to hold Riley, but, as he sat the saddle, hand on thigh,
  and looked scornfully toward Sour Creek, he was himself a picture to make
  one's head lift. As a rule the horse comes in for as much attention as the
  rider, but when Riley Sinclair came near, people saw the man and nothing
  else. Not because he was good-looking, but because one became suddenly aware
  of some hundred and eighty pounds of lithe, tough muscle and a domineering
  face.</p>

  <p>Somewhere behind his eyes there was a faint glint of humor. That was the
  only soft touch about him. He was in that hard age between thirty and thirty-
  five when people are still young, but have lost the illusions of youth. And,
  indeed, that was exactly the word which people in haste used to describe
  Riley Sinclair&mdash;"hard."</p>

  <p>Having once resigned himself to the descent into that cramped country
  beneath he at once banished all regret. First he picked out his objective, a
  house some distance away, near the road, and then he brought his mustang up
  on the bit with a touch of the spurs. Then, having established the taut rein
  which he preferred, he sent the cow pony down the slope. It was plain that
  the mustang hated its rider; it was equally plain that Sinclair was in
  perfect touch with his horse, what with the stern wrist pulling against the
  bit, and the spurs keeping the pony up on it. In spite of his bulk he was not
  heavy in the saddle, for he kept in tune with the gait of the horse, with
  that sway of the body which lightens burdens. A capable rider, he was so
  judicious that he seemed reckless.</p>

  <p>Leaving the mountainside, he struck at a trot across a tableland. Some
  mysterious instinct enabled him to guide the pony without glancing once at
  the ground; for Sinclair, with his head high, was now carefully examining the
  house before him. Twice a cluster of trees obscured it, and each time, as it
  came again more closely in view, the eye of Riley Sinclair brightened with
  certainty. At length, nodding slightly to express his conviction, he sent the
  pony into the shelter of a little grove overlooking the house. From this
  shelter, still giving half his attention to his objective, he ran swiftly
  over his weapons. The pair of long pistols came smoothly into his hands, to
  be weighed nicely, and have their cylinders spun. Then the rifle came out of
  its case, and its magazine was looked to thoroughly before it was
  returned.</p>

  <p>This done, the rider seemed in no peculiar haste to go on. He merely
  pushed the horse into a position from which he commanded all the environs of
  the house; then he sat still as a hawk hovering in a windless sky.</p>

  <p>Presently the door of the little shack opened, and two men came out and
  walked down the path toward the road, talking earnestly. One was as tall as
  Riley Sinclair, but heavier; the other was a little, slight man. He went to a
  sleepy pony at the end of the path and slowly gathered the reins. Plainly he
  was troubled, and apparently it was the big man who had troubled him. For now
  he turned and cast out his hand toward the other, speaking rapidly, in the
  manner of one making a last appeal. Only the murmur of that voice drifted up
  to Riley Sinclair, but the loud laughter of the big man drove clearly to him.
  The smaller of the two mounted and rode away with dejected head, while the
  other remained with arms folded, looking after him.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be chuckling at the little man, and indeed there was cause,
  for Riley had never seen a rider so completely out of place in a saddle. When
  the pony presently broke into a soft lope it caused the elbows of the little
  man to flop like wings. Like a great clumsy bird he winged his way out of
  view beyond the edge of the hilltop.</p>

  <p>The big man continued to stand with his arms folded, looking in the
  direction in which the other had disappeared; he was still shaking with
  mirth. When he eventually turned, Riley Sinclair was riding down on him at a
  sharp gallop. Strangers do not pass ungreeted in the mountain desert. There
  was a wave of the arm to Riley, and he responded by bringing his horse to a
  trot, then reining in close to the big man. At close hand he seemed even
  larger than from a distance, a burly figure with ludicrously inadequate
  support from the narrow-heeled riding boots. He looked sharply at Riley
  Sinclair, but his first speech was for the hard-ridden pony.</p>

  <p>"You been putting your hoss through a grind, I see, stranger."</p>

  <p>The mustang had slumped into a position of rest, his sides heaving.</p>

  <p>"Most generally," said Riley Sinclair, "when I climb into a saddle it
  ain't for pleasure&mdash;it's to get somewhere."</p>

  <p>His voice was surprisingly pleasant. He spoke very deliberately, so that
  one felt occasionally that he was pausing to find the right words. And, in
  addition to the quality of that deep voice, he had an impersonal way of
  looking his interlocutor squarely in the eye, a habit that pleased the men of
  the mountain desert. On this occasion his companion responded at once with a
  grin. He was a younger man than Riley Sinclair, but he gave an impression of
  as much hardness as Riley himself.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'll be sliding out of the saddle for a minute?" he asked. "Got
  some pretty fair hooch in the house."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, partner, but I'm due over to Sour Creek by night. I guess that's
  Sour Creek over the hill?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. New to these parts?"</p>

  <p>"Sort of new."</p>

  <p>Riley's noncommittal attitude was by no means displeasing to the larger
  man. His rather brutally handsome face continued to light, as if he were
  recognizing in Riley Sinclair a man of his own caliber.</p>

  <p>"You're from yonder?"</p>

  <p>"Across the mountains."</p>

  <p>"You travel light."</p>

  <p>His eyes were running over Riley's meager equipment. Sinclair had been
  known to strike across the desert loaded with nothing more than a rifle,
  ammunition, and water. Other things were nonessentials to him, and it was
  hardly likely that he would put much extra weight on a horse. The only
  concession to animal comfort, in fact, was the slicker rolled snugly behind
  the saddle. He was one of those rare Westerners to whom coffee on the trail
  is not the staff of life. As long as he had a gun he could get meat, and as
  long as he could get meat, he cared little about other niceties of diet. On a
  long trip his "extras" were usually confined to a couple of bags of
  strength-giving grain for his horse.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'd know the gent I'm down here looking for?" asked Riley.
  "Happen to know Ollie Quade&mdash;Oliver Quade?"</p>

  <p>"Sort of know him, yep."</p>

  <p>Riley went on explaining blandly "You see, I'm carrying him a sort of a
  death message."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the big man, and he watched Riley, his eyes grown suddenly
  alert, his glance shifting from hand to face with catlike uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"Yep," resumed Sinclair in a rambling vein. "I come from a gent that used
  to be a pal of his. Name is Sam Lowrie."</p>

  <p>"Sam Lowrie!" exclaimed the other. "You a friend of Sam's?"</p>

  <p>"I was the only gent with him when he died," said Sinclair simply.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" said the other heavily. "Sam dead!"</p>

  <p>"You must of been pretty thick with him," declared Riley.</p>

  <p>"Man, I'm Quade. Lowrie was my bunkie!"</p>

  <p>He came close to Sinclair, raising an eager face. "How'd Lowrie go
  out?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty peaceful&mdash;boots off&mdash;everything comfortable."</p>

  <p>"He give you a message for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yep, about a gent called Sinclair&mdash;Hal Sinclair, I think it was."
  Immediately he turned his eyes away, as if he were striving to recollect
  accurately. Covertly he sent a side glance at Quade and found him scowling
  suspiciously. When he turned his head again, his eye was as clear as the eye
  of a child. "Yep," he said, "that was the name&mdash;Hal Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"What about Hal Sinclair?" asked Quade gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Seems like Sinclair was on Lowrie's conscience," said Riley in the same
  unperturbed voice.</p>

  <p>"You don't say so!"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what he told me. Maybe he was just raving, for he had a
  sort of fever before he went out. He said that you and him and Hal Sinclair
  and Bill Sandersen all went out prospecting. You got stuck clean out in the
  desert, Lowrie said, and you hit for water. Then Sinclair's hoss busted his
  leg in a hole. The fall smashed up Sinclair's foot. The four of you went on,
  Sinclair riding one hoss, and the rest of you taking turns with the third
  one. Without water the hosses got weak, and you gents got pretty badly
  scared, Lowrie said. Finally you and Sandersen figured that Sinclair had got
  to get off, but Sinclair couldn't walk. So the three of you made up your
  minds to leave him and make a dash for water. You got to water, all right,
  and in three hours you went back for Sinclair. But he'd given up hope and
  shot himself, sooner'n die of thirst, Lowrie said."</p>

  <p>The horrible story came slowly from the lips of Riley Sinclair. There was
  not the slightest emotion in his face until Quade rubbed his knuckles across
  his wet forehead. Then there was the faintest jutting out of Riley's jaw.</p>

  <p>"Lowrie was sure raving," said Quade.</p>

  <p>Sinclair looked carelessly down at the gray face of Quade. "I guess maybe
  he was, but what he asked me to say was: 'Hell is sure coming to what you
  boys done.'"</p>

  <p>"He thought about that might late," replied Quade. "Waited till he could
  shift the blame on me and Sandersen, eh? To hell with Lowrie!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's there, all right," said Sinclair, shrugging. "But I've got rid
  of the yarn, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to spread that story around in Sour Creek?" asked Quade
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Me? Why, that story was told me confidential by a gent that was about to
  go out!"</p>

  <p>Riley's frank manner disarmed Quade in a measure.</p>

  <p>"Kind of queer, me running on to you like this, ain't it?" he went on.
  "Well, you're fixed up sort of comfortable up here. Nice little shack,
  partner. And I suppose you got a wife and kids and everything? Pretty lucky,
  I'd call you!"</p>

  <p>Quade was glad of an opportunity to change the subject. "No wife yet!" he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Living up here all alone?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Why?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing! Thought maybe you'd find it sort of lonesome."</p>

  <p>Back to the dismissed subject Quade returned, with the persistence of a
  guilty conscience. "Say," he said, "while we're talking about it, you don't
  happen to believe what Lowrie said?"</p>

  <p>"Lowrie was pretty sick; maybe he was raving. So you're all along up here?
  Nobody near?"</p>

  <p>His restless, impatient eye ran over the surroundings. There was not a
  soul in sight. The mountains were growing stark and black against the flush
  of the western sky. His glance fell back upon Quade.</p>

  <p>"But how did Lowrie happen to die?"</p>

  <p>"He got shot."</p>

  <p>"Did a gang drop him?"</p>

  <p>"Nope, just one gent."</p>

  <p>"You don't say! But Lowrie was a pretty slick hand with a gun&mdash; next
  to Bill Sandersen, the best I ever seen, almost! Somebody got the drop on
  him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Nope, he killed himself!"</p>

  <p>Quade gasped. "Suicide?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you how it was. He seen a gent coming. In fact he looked out of
  the window of his hotel and seen Riley Sinclair, and he figured that Riley
  had come to get him for what happened to his brother, Hal. Lowrie got sort of
  excited, lost his nerve, and when the hotel keeper come upstairs, Lowrie
  thought it was Sinclair, and he didn't wait. He shot himself."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a pile," said Quade thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, I'm Riley Sinclair." Still he smiled, but Quade was as one
  who had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"I had to make sure that you was alone. I had to make sure that you was
  guilty. And you are, Quade. Don't do that!"</p>

  <p>The hand of Quade slipped around the butt of his gun and clung there.</p>

  <p>"You ain't fit for a gun fight right now," went on Riley Sinclair slowly.
  "You're all shaking, Quade, and you couldn't hit the side of the mountain,
  let alone me. Wait a minute. Take your time. Get all settled down and wait
  till your hand stops shaking."</p>

  <p>Quade moistened his white lips and waited.</p>

  <p>"You give Hal plenty of time," resumed Riley Sinclair. "Since Lowrie told
  me that yarn I been wondering how Hal felt when you and the other two left
  him alone. You know, a gent can do some pretty stiff thinking before he makes
  up his mind to blow his head off."</p>

  <p>His tone was quite conversational.</p>

  <p>"Queer thing how I come to blunder into all this information, partner. I
  come into a room where Lowrie was. The minute he heard my name he figured I
  was after him on account of Hal. Up he comes with his gun like a flash.
  Afterward he told me all about it, and I give him a pretty fine funeral. I'll
  do the same by you, Quade. How you feeling now?"</p>

  <p>"Curse you!" exclaimed Quade.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'm cursed, right enough, but, Quade, I'd let 'em burn me, inch by
  inch in a fire, before I'd quit a partner, a bunkie in the desert! You hear?
  It's a queer thing that a gent could have much pleasure out of plugging
  another gent full of lead. I've had that pleasure once; and I'm going to have
  it again. I'm going to kill you, Quade, but I wish there was a slower way!
  Pull your gun!"</p>

  <p>That last came out with a snap, and the revolver of Quade flicked out of
  its holster with a convulsive jerk of the big man's wrist. Yet the spit of
  fire came from Riley Sinclair's weapon, slipping smoothly into his hand.
  Quade did not fall. He stood with a bewildered expression, as a man trying to
  remember something hidden far in the past; and Sinclair fingered the butt of
  his gun lightly and waited. It was rather a crumbling than a fall. The big
  body literally slumped down into a heap.</p>

  <p>Sinclair reached down without dismounting and pulled the body over on its
  back.</p>

  <p>"Because," he explained to what had been a strong man the moment before,
  "when the devil comes to you, I want the old boy to see your face, Quade! Git
  on, old boss!"</p>

  <p>As he rode down the trail toward Sour Creek he carefully and deftly
  cleaned his revolver and reloaded the empty chamber.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

  <p class="first">Perhaps, in the final analysis, Riley Sinclair would not be
  condemned for the death of Lowrie or the killing of Quade, but for singing on
  the trail to Sour Creek. And sing he did, his voice ringing from hill to
  hill, and the echoes barking back to him, now and again.</p>

  <p>He was not silent until he came to Sour Creek. At the head of the long,
  winding, single street he drew the mustang to a tired walk. It was a very
  peaceful moment in the little town Yonder a dog barked and a coyote howled a
  thin answer far away, but, aside from these, all other sounds were the happy
  noises of families at the end of a day. From every house they floated out to
  him, the clamor of children, the deep laughter of a man, the loud rattle of
  pans in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"This ain't so bad," Riley Sinclair said aloud and roused the mustang
  cruelly to a gallop, the hoofs of his mount splashing through inches of
  pungent dust.</p>

  <p>The heaviness of the gallop told him that his horse was plainly spent and
  would not be capable of a long run before the morning. Riley Sinclair
  accepted the inevitable with a sigh. All his strong instincts cried out to
  find Sandersen and, having found him, to shoot him and flee. Yet he had a
  sense of fatality connected with Sandersen. Lowrie's own conscience had
  betrayed him, and his craven fear had been his executioner. Quade had been
  shot in a fair fight with not a soul near by. But, at the third time,
  Sinclair felt reasonably sure that his luck would fail him. The third time
  the world would be very apt to brand him with murder.</p>

  <p>It was a bad affair, and he wanted to get it done. This stay in Sour Creek
  was entirely against his will. Accordingly he put the mustang in the stable
  behind the hotel, looked to his feed, and then went slowly back to get a
  room. He registered and went in silence up to his room. If there had been the
  need, he could have kept on riding for a twenty-hour stretch, but the moment
  he found his journey interrupted, he flung himself on the bed, his arms
  thrown out crosswise, crucified with weariness.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the proprietor returned to his desk to find a long, gaunt
  man leaning above the register, one brown finger tracing a name.</p>

  <p>"Looking for somebody, Sandersen?" he asked. "Know this gent
  Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"Face looked kind of familiar to me," said the other, who had jerked his
  head up from the study of the register. "Somehow I don't tie that name up
  with the face."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," said the proprietor. "Maybe he ain't Riley Sinclair of Colma;
  maybe he's somebody else."</p>

  <p>"Traveling strange, you mean?" asked Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"I dunno, Bill, but he looks like a hard one. He's got one of them nervous
  right hands."</p>

  <p>"Gunfighter?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I'm not saying anything about what he is or what he ain't. But,
  if a gent was to come in here and tell me a pretty strong yarn about Riley
  Sinclair, or whatever his name might be, I wouldn't incline to doubt of it,
  would you, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I would, and maybe I wouldn't," answered Bill Sandersen
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>He went out onto the veranda and squinted thoughtfully into the darkness.
  Bill Sandersen was worried&mdash;very worried. The moment he saw Sinclair
  enter the hotel, there had been a ghostly familiarity about the man. And he
  understood the reason for it as soon as he saw the name on the register.
  Sinclair! The name carried him back to the picture of the man who lay on his
  back, with the soft sands already half burying his body, and the round,
  purple blur in the center of his forehead. In a way it was as if Hal Sinclair
  had come back to Me in a new and more terrible form, come back as an
  avenger.</p>

  <p>Bill Sandersen was not an evil man, and his sin against Hal Sinclair had
  its qualifying circumstances. At least he had been only one of three, all of
  whom had concurred in the thing. He devoutly wished that the thing were to be
  done over again. He swore to himself that in such a case he would stick with
  his companion, no matter who deserted. But what had brought this Riley
  Sinclair all the way from Colma to Sour Creek, if it were not an errand of
  vengeance?</p>

  <p>A sense of guilt troubled the mind of Bill Sandersen, but the obvious
  thing was to find out the reason for Sinclair's presence in Sour Creek.
  Sandersen crossed the street to the newly installed telegraph office. He had
  one intimate friend in the far-off town of Colma, and to that friend he now
  addressed a telegram.</p>

  <p>Rush back all news you have about man calling self Riley Sinclair of
  Colma&mdash;over six feet tall, weight hundred and eighty, complexion dark,
  hard look.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There was enough meat in that telegram to make the operator rise his head
  and glance with sharpened eyes at the patron. Bill Sandersen returned that
  glance with so much interest that the operator lowered his head again and
  made a mental oath that he would let the Westerners run the West.</p>

  <p>With that telegram working for him in far-off Colma, Bill Sandersen
  started out to gather what information he could in Sour Creek. He drifted
  from the blacksmith shop to the kitchen of Mrs. Mary Caluson, but both these
  brimming reservoirs of news had this day run dry. Mrs. Caluson vaguely
  remembered a Riley Sinclair, a man who fought for the sheer love of fighting.
  A grim fellow!</p>

  <p>Pete Handley, the blacksmith, had even less to say. He also, he averred,
  had heard of a Riley Sinclair, a man of action, but he could not remember in
  what sense. Vaguely he seemed to recall that there had been something about
  guns connected with the name of Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Meager information on which to build, but, having seen this man, Bill
  Sandersen said the less and thought the more. In a couple of hours he went
  back through the night to the telegraph office and found that his Colma
  friend had been unbelievably prompt. The telegram had been sent "collect,"
  and Bill Sandersen groaned as he paid the bill. But when he opened the
  telegram he did not begrudge the money.</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair is harder than he looks, but absolutely honest and will pay
  fairer than anybody. Avoid all trouble. Trust his word, but not his temper.
  Gunfighter, but not a bully. By the way, your pal Lowrie shot himself last
  week.</p>

  <p>The long fingers of Bill Sandersen slowly gathered the telegram into a
  ball and crushed it against the palm of his hand. That ball he presently
  unraveled to reread the telegram; he studied it word by word.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely honest!"</p>

  <p>It made Sandersen wish to go straight to the gunfighter, put his cards on
  the table, confess what he had done to Sinclair's brother, and then express
  his sorrow. Then he remembered the cruel, lean face of Sinclair and the
  impatient eyes. He would probably be shot before he had half finished his
  story of the gruesome trip through the desert. Already Lowrie was dead. Even
  a child could have put two and two together and seen that Sinclair had come
  to Sour Creek on a mission of vengeance. Sandersen was himself a fighter,
  and, being a fighter, he knew that in Riley Sinclair he would meet the better
  man.</p>

  <p>But two good men were better than one, even if the one were an expert.
  Sandersen went straight to the barn behind his shack, saddled his horse, and
  spurred out along the north road to Quade's house. Once warned, they would be
  doubly armed, and, standing back to back, they could safely defy the marauder
  from the north.</p>

  <p>There was no light in Quade's house, but there was just a chance that the
  owner had gone to bed early. Bill Sandersen dismounted to find out, and
  dismounting, he stumbled across a soft, inert mass in the path. A moment
  later he was on his knees, and the flame of the sulphur match sputtered a
  blue light into the dead face of Quade, staring upward to the stars. Bill
  Sandersen remained there until the match singed his finger tips.</p>

  <p>All doubt was gone now. Lowrie and Quade were both gone; and he,
  Sandersen, alone remained, the third and last of the guilty. His first strong
  impulse, after his agitation had diminished to such a point that he was able
  to think clearly again, was to flee headlong into the night and keep on,
  changing horses at every town he reached until he was over the mountains and
  buried in the shifting masses of life in some great city.</p>

  <p>And then he recalled Riley Sinclair, lean and long as a hound. Such a man
  would be terrible on the trail&mdash;tireless, certainly. Besides there was
  the horror of flight, almost more awful than the immediate fear of death.
  Once he turned his back to flee from Riley Sinclair, the gunfighter would
  become a nightmare that would haunt him the rest of his life. No matter where
  he fled, every footstep behind him would be the footfall of Riley Sinclair,
  and behind every closed door would stand the same ominous figure. On the
  other hand if he went back and faced Sinclair he might reduce the nightmare
  to a mere creature of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>Sandersen resolved to take the second step.</p>

  <p>In one way his hands were tied. He could not accuse Sinclair of this
  killing without in the first place exposing the tale of how Riley's brother
  was abandoned in the desert by three strong men who had been his bunkies. And
  that story, Sandersen knew, would condemn him to worse than death in the
  mountain desert. He would be loathed and scorned from one end of the cattle
  country to the other.</p>

  <p>All of these things went through his head, as he jogged his mustang back
  down the hill. He turned in at Mason's place. All at once he recalled that he
  was not acting normally. He had just come from seeing the dead body of his
  best friend. And yet so mortal was his concern for his own safety that he
  felt not the slightest touch of grief or horror for dead Quade.</p>

  <p>He had literally to grip his hands and rouse himself to a pitch of
  semihysteria. Then he spurred his horse down the path, flung himself with a
  shout out of the saddle, cast open the door of the house without a
  preliminary knock, and rushed into the room.</p>

  <p>"Murder!" shouted Bill Sandersen. "Quade is killed!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

  <p class="first">Who killed Quade? That was the question asked with the quiet
  deadliness by six men in Sour Creek. It had been Buck Mason's idea to keep
  the whole affair still. It was very possible that the slayer was still in the
  environs of Sour Creek, and in that case much noise would simply serve to
  frighten him away. It was also Buck's idea that they should gather a few
  known men to weigh the situation.</p>

  <p>Every one of the six men who answered the summons was an adept with fist
  or guns, as the need might be; every one of them had proved that he had a
  level head; every one of them was a respected citizen. Sandersen was one;
  stocky Buck Mason, carrying two hundred pounds close to the ground, massive
  of hand and jaw, was a second. After that their choice had fallen on "Judge"
  Lodge. The judge wore spectacles and a judicial air. He had a keen eye for
  cows and was rather a sharper in horse trades. He gave his costume a
  semiofficial air by wearing a necktie instead of a bandanna, even at a
  roundup. The glasses, the necktie, and his little solemn pauses before he
  delivered an opinion, had given his nickname.</p>

  <p>Then came Denver Jim, a very little man, with nervous hands and remarkable
  steady eyes. He had punched cows over those ranges for ten years, and his
  experience had made him a wildcat in a fight. Oscar Larsen was a huge Swede,
  with a perpetual and foolish grin. Sour Creek had laughed at Oscar for five
  years, considered him dubiously for five years more, and then suddenly
  admitted him as a man among men. He was stronger than Buck Mason, quicker
  than Denver Jim, and shrewder than the judge. Last of all came Montana. He
  had a long, sad face, prodigious ability to stow away redeye, and a nature as
  simple and kind and honest as a child's. These were the six men who gathered
  about and stared at the center of the floor. Something, they agreed, had to
  be done.</p>

  <p>"First it was old man Collins. That was two years back," said Judge Lodge.
  "You boys remember how Collins went. Then there was the drifter that was
  plugged eight months ago. And now it's Ollie Quade. Gents, three murders in
  two years is too much. Sour Creek'll get a name. The bad ones will begin to
  drop in on us and use us for headquarters. We got to make an example. We
  never got the ones that shot Collins or the drifter. Since Quade has been
  plugged we got to hang somebody. Ain't that straight?"</p>

  <p>"We got to hang somebody," said Denver Jim. "The point is&mdash;who?"</p>

  <p>His keen eyes went slowly, hungrily, from face to face, as if he would not
  have greatly objected to picking one of his companions in that very room.</p>

  <p>"Is they any strangers in town?" asked Larsen with his peculiar, foolish
  grin.</p>

  <p>Sandersen stirred in his chair; his heart leaped.</p>

  <p>"There's a gent named Riley Sinclair nobody ain't never seen before."</p>

  <p>"When did he come in?"</p>

  <p>"Along about dark."</p>

  <p>"That's the right time for us. You found Quade a long time dead,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>Sandersen swallowed. In his joy he could have embraced Larsen.</p>

  <p>"What'll we do?"</p>

  <p>"Go talk to Sinclair," said Larsen and rose. "I got a rope."</p>

  <p>"He's a dangerous-lookin' gent," declared Sandersen.</p>

  <p>Larsen replied mildly: "Mostly they's a pile more interesting when they's
  dangerous. Come on, boys!"</p>

  <p>It had been well after midnight when Mason and Sandersen got back to Sour
  Creek. The gathering of the posse had required much time. Now, as they filed
  out to the hotel, to the east the mountains were beginning to roll up out of
  the night, and one cloud, far away and high in the sky, was turning pink.
  They found the hotel wakening even at this early hour. At least, the Chinese
  cook was rattling in the kitchen as he built the fire. When the six reached
  the door of Sinclair's room, stepping lightly, they heard the occupant
  singing softly to himself.</p>

  <p>"Early riser," whispered Denver Jim.</p>

  <p>"Too early to be honest," replied Judge Lodge.</p>

  <p>Larsen raised one of his great hands and imposed an absolute silence.
  Then, stepping with astonishing softness, considering his bulk, he approached
  the door of Sinclair's room. Into his left hand slid his .45 and instantly
  five guns glinted in the hands of the others. With equal caution they ranged
  themselves behind the big Swede. The latter glanced over his shoulder, made
  sure that everything was in readiness, and then kicked the door violently
  open.</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair was sitting on the side of his bed, tugging on a pair of
  riding boots and singing a hushed song. He interrupted himself long enough to
  look up into the muzzle of Larsen's gun. Then deliberately he finished
  drawing on the boot, singing while he did so; and, still deliberately, rose
  and stamped his feet home in the leather. Next he dropped his hands on his
  hips and considered the posse gravely.</p>

  <p>"Always heard tell how Sour Creek was a fine town but I didn't know they
  turned out reception committees before sunup. How are you, boys? Want my
  roll?"</p>

  <p>Larsen, as one who scorned to take a flying start on any man, dropped his
  weapon back in its holster. Sinclair's own gun and cartridge belt hang on the
  wall at the foot of the bed.</p>

  <p>"That sounds too cool to be straight," said the judge soberly. "Sinclair,
  I figure you know why we want you?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno, gents," said Sinclair, who grew more and more cheerful in the
  face of these six pairs of grim eyes. "But I'm sure obliged to the gent that
  give me the sendoff. What d'you want?" Drawing into the background Larsen
  said: "Open up on him, judge. Start the questions."</p>

  <p>But Sandersen was of no mind to let the slow-moving mind of the judge
  handle this affair which was so vital to him. If Riley Sinclair did not hang,
  Sandersen himself was instantly placed in peril of his life. He stepped in
  front of Sinclair and thrust out his long arm.</p>

  <p>"You killed Quade!"</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair rubbed his chin thoughtfully, looking past his accuser.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"You don't think so? Don't you know?"</p>

  <p>"They was two Mexicans jumped me once. One of 'em was called Pedro. Maybe
  the other was Quade. That who you're talking about?'</p>

  <p>"You can't talk yourself out of it, Sinclair," said Denver Jim. "We mean
  business, real business, you'll find out!"</p>

  <p>"This here is a necktie party, maybe?" asked Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"It is, partner," said big Larsen, with his continual smile.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair, you come over the mountains," went on Sandersen. "You come to
  find Quade. You ride down off'n the hills, and you come up to Quade's house.
  You call him out to talk to you. You're sitting on your horse. All at once
  you snatch out a gun and shoot Quade down. We know! That bullet ranged down.
  It was shot from above him, plain murder! He didn't have a chance!"</p>

  <p>Throwing out his facts as he saw them, one by one, there was a ring of
  conviction in his voice. The six accusing faces grew hard and set. Then, to
  their astonishment, they saw that Sinclair was smiling!</p>

  <p>"He don't noways take us serious, gents," declared the judge. "Let's take
  him out and see if a rope means anything to him. Sinclair, d'you figure this
  is a game with us?"</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair chuckled. "Gents," he said easily, "you come here all het
  up. You want a pile of action, but you ain't going to get it off'n me&mdash;
  not a bit! I'll tell you why. You gents are straight, and you know straight
  talk when you hear it. This dead man&mdash;what's his name, Quade?&mdash; was
  killed by a gent that had a reason for killing him. Wanted to get Quade's
  money, or they was an old grudge. But what could my reason be for wanting to
  bump off Quade? Can any of you figure that out? There's my things. Look
  through 'em and see if I got Quade's money. Maybe you think it's a grudge?
  Gents, I give you my word that I never been into this country before this
  trip. How could there be any grudge between me and Quade? Is that sense? Then
  talk sense back to me!"</p>

  <p>His mirth had disappeared halfway through his speech, and in the latter
  part of it his voice rang sternly. Moreover he looked them in the eye, one by
  one. All of this was noted by Sandersen. He saw suddenly and clearly that he
  had lost. They would not hang this man by hearsay evidence, or by chance
  presumption.</p>

  <p>Sinclair would go free. And if Sinclair went free, there would be short
  shrift for Bill Sandersen. For a moment he felt his destiny wavering back and
  forth on a needle point. Then he flung himself into a new course
  diametrically opposed to the other.</p>

  <p>"Boys, it was me that started this, and I want to be the first to admit
  it's a cold trail. Men has been hung with less agin' them than we got agin'
  Sinclair. We know when Quade must have been killed. We know it tallies pretty
  close with the time when Sinclair came down that same trail, because that was
  the way he rode into Sour Creek. But no matter how facts look, nobody
  <i>seen</i> that shooting. And I say this gent Sinclair ain't any murderer.
  Look him over, boys. He's clean, and I register a vote for him. What d'you
  say? No matter what the rest of you figure, I'm going to shake hands with
  him. I like his style!"</p>

  <p>He had turned his back on Riley while he spoke, but now he whirled and
  thrust out his hand. The fingers of Sinclair closed slowly over the proffered
  hand.</p>

  <p>"When it comes to the names, partner, seems like you got an edge over
  me."</p>

  <p>"Have I? I'm Sandersen. Glad to know you, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Sandersen!" repeated the stranger slowly. "Sandersen!"</p>

  <p>Letting his fingers fall away nervelessly from the hand of the other, he
  sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>Sandersen with a side-glance followed every changing shade of expression
  in that hard face. How could Sinclair attack a man who had just defended him
  from a terrible charge? It could not be. For the moment, at least, Sandersen
  felt he was safe. In the future, many things might happen. At the very least,
  he had gained a priceless postponement of the catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"Them that do me a good turn is writ down in red," Sinclair was saying;
  "and them that step on my toes is writ down the same way. Sandersen, I got an
  idea that for one reason or another I ain't going to forget you in a
  hurry."</p>

  <p>There was a grim double meaning in that speech which Sandersen alone could
  understand. The others of the self-appointed posse had apparently made up
  their minds that Sandersen was right, and that this was a cold trail.</p>

  <p>"It's like Sinclair says," admitted the judge. "We got to find a gent that
  had a reason for wishing to have Quade die. Where's the man?"</p>

  <p>"Hunt for the reason first and find the man afterward," said big Larsen,
  still smiling.</p>

  <p>"All right! Did anybody owe Quade money, anybody Quade was pressing for
  it?"</p>

  <p>It was the judge who advanced the argument in this solemn and dry form.
  Denver Jim declared that to his personal knowledge Quade had neither borrowed
  nor loaned.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, had Quade ever made many enemies? We know Quade was a
  fighter. Recollect any gents that might hold grudges?"</p>

  <p>"Young Penny hated the ground he walked on. Quade beat Penny to a pulp
  down by the Perkin water hole."</p>

  <p>"Penny wouldn't do a murder."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it was a fair fight," broke in Larsen.</p>

  <p>"Fair nothin'," said Buck Mason. "Don't we all know that Quade was fast
  with a gun? He barely had it out in his hand when the other gent drilled him.
  And he was shot from above. No, sir, the way it happened was something like
  this. The murderin' skunk sat on his hoss saying goodby to Quade, and, while
  they was shaking hands or something like that, he goes for his gun and plugs
  Quade. Maybe it was a gent that knew he didn't have a chance agin' Quade.
  Maybe &mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off short in his deductions and smote his hands together with a
  tremendous oath. "Boys, I got it! It's Cold Feet that done the job. It's
  Gaspar that done it!"</p>

  <p>They stared at Buck vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Mason, Cold Feet ain't got the nerve to shoot a rabbit."</p>

  <p>"Not in a fight. This was a murder!"</p>

  <p>"What's the schoolteacher's reason!"</p>

  <p>"Don't he love Sally Bent? Didn't Quade love her?" He raised his voice.
  "I'm a big fool for forgetting! Didn't I see him ride over the hill to
  Quade's place and come back in the evening? Didn't I see it? Why else would
  he have called on Quade?"</p>

  <p>There was a round chorus of oaths and exclamations. "The poisonous little
  skunk! It's him! We'll string him up!"</p>

  <p>With a rush they started for the door.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" called Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Bill Sandersen watched him with a keen eye. He had studied the face of the
  big man from up north all during the scene, and he found the stern features
  unreadable. For one instant now he guessed that Sinclair was about to
  confess.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind seven in one party," said Riley Sinclair, "I think I'll
  go along to see justice done. You see, I got a sort of secondhand interest in
  this necktie party."</p>

  <p>Mason clapped him on the shoulder. "You're just the sort of a gent we
  need," he declared.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

  <p class="first">Down in the kitchen they demanded a loaf of bread and some
  coffee from the Chinese cook, and then the seven dealers of justice took
  horse and turned into the silence of the long mountain trail.</p>

  <p>The sunrise had picked those mountains out of the night, directly above
  Sour Creek. Riley Sinclair regarded them with a longing eye. That was his
  country. A man could see up there, and he could see the truth. Down here in
  the valley everything was askew. Men lived blindly and did blind things, like
  this "justice" which the six riders were bringing on an innocent man.</p>

  <p>Not by any means had Riley decided what he would do. If he confessed the
  truth he would not only have a man-sized job trying to escape from the posse,
  but he would have to flee before he had a chance to deal finally with
  Sandersen. Chiefly he wanted time. He wanted a chance to study Sandersen. The
  fellow had spoken for him like a man, but Sinclair was suspicious.</p>

  <p>In his quandary he turned to sad-faced Montana and asked: "Who's this gent
  you call Cold Feet?"</p>

  <p>"He's a tenderfoot," declared Montana, "and he's queer. He's yaller, they
  say, and that's why they call him Cold Feet. Besides, he teaches the school.
  Where's they a real man that would do a schoolma'am's work? Living or dying,
  he ain't much good. You can lay to that!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair was comforted by this speech. Perhaps the schoolteacher was, as
  Montana stated, not much good, dead or alive. Sinclair had known many men
  whose lives were not worth an ounce of powder. In this case he would let Cold
  Feet be hanged. It was a conclusion sufficiently grim, but Riley Sinclair was
  admittedly a grim man. He had lived for himself, he had worked for himself.
  On his younger brother, Hal, he had wasted all the better and tenderer side
  of his nature. For Hal's education and advantage he had sweated and saved for
  a long time. With the death of Hal, the better side of Riley Sinclair
  died.</p>

  <p>The horses sweated up a rise of ground.</p>

  <p>"For a schoolteacher he lives sort of far out of town, I figure," said
  Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"That's on account of Sally Bent," answered Denver Jim. "Sally and her
  brother got a shack out this way, and Cold Feet boards with 'em."</p>

  <p>"Sally Bent! That's an old-maidish-sounding name."</p>

  <p>Denver Jim grinned broadly. "Tolerable," he said, "just tolerable old-
  maidish sounding."</p>

  <p>When they reached the top of the knoll, the horses paused, as if by common
  assent. Now they stood with their heads bowed, sullen, tired already, steam
  going up from them into the cool of the morning.</p>

  <p>"There it is!"</p>

  <p>It was as comfortably placed a house as Riley Sinclair had ever seen. The
  mountain came down out of the sky in ragged, uneven steps. Here it dipped
  away into a lap of quite level ground. A stream of spring water flashed
  across that little tableland, dark in the shadow of the big trees, silver in
  the sunlight. At the back of the natural clearing was the cabin, built
  solidly of logs. Wood, water, and commanding position for defense! Riley
  Sinclair ran his eye appreciatively over these advantages.</p>

  <p>"My guns, I'd forgot Sally!" exclaimed the massive Buck Mason.</p>

  <p>"Is that her?" asked Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>A woman had come out of the shadow of a tree and stood over the edge of
  the stream, a bucket in her hand. At that distance it was quite impossible to
  make out her features, although Riley Sinclair found himself squinting and
  peering to make them out. She had on something white over her head and neck,
  and her dress was the faded blue of old gingham. Then the wind struck her
  dress, and it seemed to lift the girl in its current.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgot Sally Bent!"</p>

  <p>"What difference does she make?" asked Riley.</p>

  <p>"You don't know her, stranger."</p>

  <p>"And she won't know us. Got anything for masks?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure a Roman-nosed fool!" declared Mason. "Of course we got to wear
  masks."</p>

  <p>The girl's pail flashed, as she raised it up from the stream and dissolved
  into the shadow of a big tree.</p>

  <p>"She don't seem noways interested in this here party," remarked Riley.</p>

  <p>"That's her way," said Denver Jim, arranging his bandanna to mask the
  lower part of his face from the bridge of his nose down. "She'll show plenty
  of interest when it comes to a pinch."</p>

  <p>Riley adjusted his own mask, and he did it thoroughly. Out of his vest he
  ripped a section of black lining, and, having cut eyeholes, he fastened the
  upper edge of the cloth under the brim of his hat and tied the loose ends
  behind his head. Red, white, blue, black, and polka dot was that quaint array
  of masks.</p>

  <p>Having completed his arrangements, Larsen started on at a lope, and the
  rest of the party followed in a lurching, loose-formed wedge. At the edge of
  the little tableland, Larsen drew down his mount to a walk and turned in the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>"Quick work, no talk, and a getaway," he said as he swung down to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>In the crisis of action the big Swede seemed to be accorded the place of
  leader by natural right. The others imitated his example silently. Before
  they reached the door Larsen turned again.</p>

  <p>"Watch Jerry Bent," he said softly. "You watch him, Denver, and you,
  Sandersen. Me and Buck will take care of Cold Feet. He may fight like a rat.
  That's the way with a coward when he gets cornered." Then he strode toward
  the door.</p>

  <p>"How thick is Sally Bent with this schoolteaching gent?" asked Riley
  Sinclair of Mason.</p>

  <p>"I dunno. Nobody knows. Sally keeps her thinking to herself."</p>

  <p>Larsen kicked open the door and at the same moment drew his six-shooter.
  That example was also imitated by the rest, with the exception of Riley
  Sinclair. He hung in the background, watching.</p>

  <p>"Gaspar!" called Larsen.</p>

  <p>There was a voice of answer, a man's thin voice, then the sharp cry of a
  girl from the interior of the house. Sinclair heard a flurry of skirts.</p>

  <p>"Hysterics now," he said into his mask.</p>

  <p>She sprang into the doorway, her hands holding the jamb on either side. In
  her haste the big white handkerchief around her throat had been twisted awry.
  Sinclair looked over the heads of Mason and Denver Jim into the suntanned
  face that had now paled into a delicate olive color. Her very lips were pale,
  and her great black eyes were flashing at them. She seemed more a picture of
  rage than hysterical fear.</p>

  <p>"Why for?" she asked. "What are you-all here for in masks, boys? What you
  mean calling for Gaspar? What's he done?"</p>

  <p>In a moment of waiting Larsen cleared his throat solemnly. "It'd be best
  we tell Gaspar direct what we're here for."</p>

  <p>This seemed to tell her everything. "Oh," she gasped, "you're not really
  <i>after</i> him?"</p>

  <p>"Lady, we sure be."</p>

  <p>"But Jig&mdash;he wouldn't hurt a mouse&mdash;he couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"Sally, he's done a murder!"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!"</p>

  <p>"Sally, will you stand out of the door?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't&mdash;it ain't a lynching party, boys? Oh, you fools, you'll
  hang for it, every one of you!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair confided to Buck Mason beside him: "Larsen is letting her talk
  down to him. She'll spoil this here party."</p>

  <p>"We're the voice of justice," said Judge Lodge pompously. "We ain't got
  any other names. They wouldn't be nothing to hang."</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose I know you?" asked the girl, stiffening to her full
  height. "D'you think those fool masks mean anything? I can tell you by your
  little eyes, Denver Jim!"</p>

  <p>Denver cringed suddenly behind the man before him.</p>

  <p>"I know you by that roan hoss of yours, Oscar Larsen. Judge Lodge, they
  ain't nobody but you that talks about 'justice' and 'voices.' Buck Mason, I
  could tell you by your build, a mile off. Montana, you'd ought to have masked
  your neck and your Adam's apple sooner'n your face. And you're Bill
  Sandersen. They ain't any other man in these parts that stands on one heel
  and points his off toe like a horse with a sore leg. I know you all, and, if
  you touch a hair on Jig's head, I'll have you into court for murder! You
  hear&mdash;murder! I'll have you hung, every man jack!"</p>

  <p>She had lowered her voice for the last part of this speech. Now she made a
  sweeping gesture, closing her hand as if she had clutched their destinies in
  the palm of her hand and could throw it into their faces.</p>

  <p>"You-all climb right back on your hosses and feed 'em the spur."</p>

  <p>They stood amazed, shifting from foot to foot, exchanging miserable
  glances. She began to laugh; mysterious lights danced and twinkled in her
  eyes. The laughter chimed away into words grown suddenly gentle, suddenly
  friendly. Such a voice Riley Sinclair had never heard. It walked into a man's
  heart, breaking the lock.</p>

  <p>"Why, Buck Mason, you of all men to be mixed up in a deal like this. And
  you, Oscar Larsen, after you and me had talked like partners so many a time!
  Denver Jim, we'll have a good laugh about this necktie party later on. Why,
  boys, you-all know that Jig ain't guilty of no harm!"</p>

  <p>"Sally," said the wretched Denver Jim, "things seemed to be sort of
  pointing to a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a growl from the rear of the party, and Riley Sinclair strode to
  the front and faced the girl. "They's a gent charged with murder inside," he
  said. "Stand off, girl. You're in the way!"</p>

  <p>Before she answered him, her teeth glinted. If she had been a man, she
  would have struck him in the face. He saw that, and it pleased him.</p>

  <p>"Stranger," she said deliberately, making sure that every one in the party
  should hear her words, "what you need is a stay around Sour Creek long enough
  for the boys to teach you how to talk to a lady."</p>

  <p>"Honey," replied Riley Sinclair with provoking calm, "you sure put up a
  tidy bluff. Maybe you'd tell a judge that you knowed all these gents behind
  their masks, but they wouldn't be no way you could <i>prove</i> it!"</p>

  <p>A stir behind him was ample assurance that this simple point had escaped
  the cowpunchers. All the soul of the girl stood up in her eyes and hated
  Riley Sinclair, and again he was pleased. It was not that he wished to bring
  the schoolteacher to trouble, but it had angered him to see one girl balk
  seven grown men.</p>

  <p>"Stand aside," said Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Not an inch!"</p>

  <p>"Lady, I'll move you."</p>

  <p>"Stranger, if you touch me, you'll be taught better. The gents in Sour
  Creek don't stand for suchlike ways!"</p>

  <p>Before the appeal to the chivalry of Sour Creek was out of her lips,
  smoothly and swiftly the hands of Sinclair settled around her elbows. She was
  lifted lightly into the air and deposited to one side of the doorway.</p>

  <p>Her cry rang in the ears of Riley Sinclair. Then her hand flashed up, and
  the mask was torn from his face.</p>

  <p>"I'll remember! Oh, if I have to wait twenty years, I'll remember!"</p>

  <p>"Look me over careful, lady. Today's most likely the last time you'll see
  me," declared Riley, gazing straight into her eyes.</p>

  <p>A hand touched his arm. "Stranger, no rough play!"</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair whirled with whiplash suddenness and, chopping the edge of
  his hand downward, struck away the arm of Larsen, paralyzing the nerves with
  the same blow.</p>

  <p>"Hands off!" said Sinclair.</p>

  <p>The girl's clear voice rang again in his ear: "Thank you, Oscar Larsen. I
  sure know my friends&mdash;and the gentlemen!"</p>

  <p>She was pouring oil on the fire. She would have a feud blazing in a
  moment. With all his heart Riley Sinclair admired her dexterity. He drew the
  posse back to the work in hand by stepping into the doorway and calling:
  "Hey, Gaspar!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

  <p class="first">"He's right, Larsen, and you're wrong," Buck Mason said.</p>

  <p>"She had us buffaloed, and he pulled us clear. Steady, boys. They ain't no
  harm done to Sally!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Buck, is that the sort of a friend of mine you are?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Sally."</p>

  <p>Sinclair gave this argument only a small part of his attention. He found
  himself looking over a large room which was, he thought, one of the most
  comfortable he had ever seen&mdash;outside of pictures. At the farther end a
  great fireplace filled the width of the room. The inside of the log walls had
  been carefully and smoothly finished by some master axman. There were plenty
  of chairs, homemade and very comfortable with cushions. A little organ stood
  against the wall to one side. No wonder the schoolteacher had chosen this for
  his boarding place!</p>

  <p>Riley made his voice larger. "Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>Then a door opened slowly, while Sinclair dropped his hand on the butt of
  his gun and waited. The door moved again. A head appeared and observed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Pronto!" declared Riley Sinclair, and a little man slipped into full
  view.</p>

  <p>He was a full span shorter, Riley felt, than a man had any right to be.
  Moreover, he was too delicately made. He had a head of bright blond hair,
  thick and rather on end. The face was thin and handsome, and the eyes
  impressed Riley as being at once both bright and weary. He was wearing a
  dressing gown, the first Riley had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"Get your hands out of those pockets!" He emphasized the command with a
  jerk of his gun hand, and the arms of the schoolteacher flew up over his
  head. Lean, fragile hands, Riley saw them to be. Altogether it was the most
  disgustingly inefficient piece of manhood that he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"Slide out here, Gaspar. They's some gents here that wants to look you
  over."</p>

  <p>The voice that answered him was pitched so low as to be almost
  unintelligible. "What do they want?"</p>

  <p>"Step lively, friend! They want to see a gent that lets a woman do his
  fighting for him."</p>

  <p>He had dropped his gun contemptuously back into its holster. Now he waved
  the schoolteacher to the door with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>Gaspar sidled past as if a loaded gun were about to explode in his
  direction. He reached the door, his arms still held stiffly above his head,
  but, at the sight of the masked faces, one arm dropped to his side, and the
  other fell across his face. He slumped against the side of the door with a
  moan.</p>

  <p>It was Judge Lodge who broke the silence. "Guilty, boys. Ain't one look at
  the skunk enough to prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Make it all fair and legal, gents," broke in Larsen.</p>

  <p>Buck Mason strode straight up to the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Was you over to Quade's house yesterday evening?"</p>

  <p>The other shrank away from the extended, pointing arm.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he stammered. "I&mdash;I&mdash;what does all this mean?"</p>

  <p>Mason whirled on his companions, still pointing to the schoolmaster. "Take
  a slant at him, boys. Can't you read it in his face?"</p>

  <p>There was a deep and humming murmur of approval. Then, without a word,
  Mason took one of Gaspar's arms and Montana took the other. Sally Bent ran
  forward at them with a cry, but the long arm of Riley Sinclair barred her
  way.</p>

  <p>"Man's work," he said coldly. "You go inside and cover your head."</p>

  <p>She turned to them with extended hands.</p>

  <p>"Buck, Montana, Larsen&mdash;boys, you-all ain't going to let it happen?
  He <i>couldn't</i> have done it!"</p>

  <p>They lowered their heads and returned no answer. At that she whirled with
  a sob and ran back into the house. The procession moved on, Buck and Montana
  in the lead, with the prisoner between them. The others followed, Judge Lodge
  uncoiling a horribly significant rope. Last of all came Bill Sandersen, never
  taking his eyes from the face of Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>The latter was thoughtful, very thoughtful. He seemed to feel the eyes of
  Sandersen upon him, for presently he turned to the other. "What good's a
  coward to the world, Sandersen?"</p>

  <p>"None that I could see."</p>

  <p>"Well, look at that. Ever see anything more yaller?"</p>

  <p>Gaspar walked between his two guards. Rather he was dragged between them,
  his feet trailing weakly and aimlessly behind him, his whole body sinking
  with flabby terror. The stern lip of Riley Sinclair curled.</p>

  <p>"He's going to let it go through," said Sandersen to himself. "After all
  nobody can blame him. He couldn't put his own neck in the noose."</p>

  <p>Over the lowest limb of a great cottonwood Judge Lodge accurately flung
  the rope, so that the noose dangled a significant distance from the ground.
  There was a businesslike stir among the others. Denver, Larsen, the judge,
  and Sandersen held the free end of the rope. Buck Mason tied the hands of the
  prisoner behind him. Montana spoke calmly through his mask.</p>

  <p>"Jig, you sure done a rotten bad thing. You hadn't ought to of killed him,
  Jig. These here killings has got to stop. We ain't hanging you for spite, but
  to make an example."</p>

  <p>Then with a dexterous hand he fitted the noose around the neck of the
  schoolteacher. As the rough rope grated against Gaspar's throat, he shrieked
  and jerked against the rope end that bound his hands. Then, as if he realized
  that struggling would not help him, and that only speech could give him a
  chance for life, he checked the cry of horror and looked around him. His
  glances fell on the grim masks, and it was only natural that he should
  address himself to the only uncovered face he saw.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said to Riley in a rapid, trembling voice, "you look to me like
  an honest man. Give me&mdash;give me time to speak."</p>

  <p>"Make it pronto," said Riley Sinclair coldly.</p>

  <p>The four waited, with their hands settled high up on the rope, ready for
  the tug which would swing Gaspar halfway to his Maker.</p>

  <p>"We're kind of pushed for time, ourselves," said Riley. "So hurry it on,
  Gaspar."</p>

  <p>Bill Sandersen was a cold man, but such unbelievable heartlessness chilled
  him. Into his mind rushed a temptation suddenly to denounce the real slayer
  before them all. He checked that temptation. In the first place it would be
  impossible to convince five men who had already made up their minds, who had
  already acquitted Sinclair of the guilt. In the second place, if he succeeded
  in convincing them, there would be an instant gunplay, and the first man to
  come under Sinclair's fire, he knew well enough, would be himself. He drew a
  long breath and waited.</p>

  <p>"Good friends, gentlemen," Gaspar was saying, "I don't even know what you
  accuse me of. Kill a man? Why should I wish to kill a man? You know I'm not a
  fighter. Gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jig," cut in Buck Mason, "you was as good as seen to murder. You're going
  to hang. If you got anything to say make a confession."</p>

  <p>Gaspar attempted to throw himself on his knees, but his weight struck
  against the rope. He staggered back to his feet, struggling for breath.</p>

  <p>"For mercy's sake&mdash;" began Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Cut it short, boys!" cried Buck Mason. "Up with him!"</p>

  <p>The four men at the rope reached a little higher and settled their grips.
  In another moment Gaspar would dangle in the air. Now Riley Sinclair made his
  decision. The agonized eyes of the condemned man, wide with animal terror,
  were fixed on his face. Sinclair raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>The arms, growing tense for the jerk, relaxed.</p>

  <p>"How long is this going to be dragged out?" asked the judge in disgust.
  "The worst lynching I ever see, that's what I call it! They ain't no justice
  in it&mdash;it's just plain torture." "Partner," declared Riley Sinclair,
  "I'm sure glad to see that you got a good appetite for a killing. But it's
  just come home to me that in spite of everything, this here gent might be
  innocent. And if he is, heaven help our souls. We're done for!"</p>

  <p>"Bless you for that!" exclaimed Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" said Sinclair. "No matter what you done, you deserve hangin'
  for being yaller. But concerning this here matter, gents, it looks to me like
  it'd be a pretty good idea to have a fair and square trial for Gaspar."</p>

  <p>"Trial?" asked Buck Mason. "Don't we all know what trials end up with? Law
  ain't no good, except to give lawyers a living."</p>

  <p>"Never was a truer thing said," declared Sinclair. "All I mean is, that
  you and me and the rest of us run a trial for ourselves. Let's get in the
  evidence and hear the witness and make out the case. If we decide they ain't
  enough agin' Gaspar to hang him, then let him go. If we decide to stretch him
  up, we'll feel a pile better about it and nearer to the truth."</p>

  <p>He went on steadily in spite of the groans of disapproval on every side.
  "Why, this is all laid out nacheral for a courtroom. That there stump is for
  the judge, and the black rock yonder is where the prisoner sits. That there
  nacheral bench of grass is where the jury sits. Gents, could anything be
  handier for a trial than this layout?"</p>

  <p>To the theory of the thing they had been entirely unresponsive, but to the
  chance to play a game, and a new game, they responded instantly.</p>

  <p>"Besides," said Judge Lodge, "I'll act as the judge. I know something
  about the law."</p>

  <p>"No, you won't," declared Riley. "I thought up this little party, and I'm
  going to run it." Then he stepped to the stump and sat down on it.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

  <p class="first">Denver Jim was already heartily in the spirit of the
  thing.</p>

  <p>"Sit down on that black rock, Jig," he said, taking Gaspar to the
  designated stone as he spoke, and removing the noose from the latter's neck.
  "Black is a sign you're going to swing in the end. Jest a triflin'
  postponement, that's all."</p>

  <p>Riley placated the judge with his first appointment. "Judge Lodge," he
  said, "you know a pile about these here things. I appoint you clerk. It's
  your duty to take out that little notebook you got in your vest pocket and
  write down a note for the important things that's said. Savvy?"</p>

  <p>"Right," replied Lodge, entirely won over, and he settled himself on the
  grass, with the notebook on his knee and a stub of a pencil poised over
  it.</p>

  <p>"Larsen, you're sergeant-at-arms."</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean that, Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"That's what they call them that keeps order; I disremember where I heard
  it. Larsen, if anybody starts raising a rumpus, it's up to you to shut 'em
  up."</p>

  <p>"I'll sure do it," declared Larsen. "You can sure leave that to me,
  judge." He hoisted his gun belt around so that the gun butt hung more forward
  and readier to his hand.</p>

  <p>"Denver, you're the jailer. You see the prisoner don't get away. Keep an
  eye on him, you see?"</p>

  <p>"Easy, judge," replied Denver. "I can do it with one hand."</p>

  <p>"Montana, you keep the door."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean&mdash;door, judge?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't you got no imagination whatever?" demanded Sinclair. "You keep the
  door. When I holler for a witness you go and get 'em. And Sandersen, you're
  the hangman. Take charge of that rope!"</p>

  <p>"That ain't such an agreeable job, your honor."</p>

  <p>"Neither is mine. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>Sandersen, glowering, gathered up the rope and draped it over his arm.</p>

  <p>"Buck Mason, you're the jury. Sit down over there on your bench, will you?
  This here court being kind of shorthanded, you got to do twelve men's work.
  If it's too much for you, the rest of us will help out."</p>

  <p>"Your honor," declared Buck, much impressed, "I'll sure do my best."</p>

  <p>"The jury's job," explained Sandersen, "is to listen to everything and not
  say nothing, but think all the time. You'll do your talking in one little
  bunch when you say guilty or not guilty. Now we're ready to start. Gaspar,
  stand up!"</p>

  <p>Denver Jim officiously dragged the schoolteacher to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Name?" asked the bewildered Gaspar. "Why, everybody knows my name!"</p>

  <p>"Don't make any difference," announced Sinclair. "This is going to be a
  strictly regular hanging with no frills left marabout's your name?"</p>

  <p>"John Irving Gaspar."</p>

  <p>"Called Jig for short, and sometimes Cold Feet," put in the clerk.</p>

  <p>Sinclair cleared his throat. "John Irving Gaspar, alias Jig, alias Cold
  Feet, d'you know what we got agin' you? Know what you're charged with?"</p>

  <p>"With&mdash;with an absurd thing, sir."</p>

  <p>"Murder!" said Sinclair solemnly. "Murder, Jig! What d'you say, guilty or
  not guilty! Most generally, you'd say not guilty."</p>

  <p>"Not guilty&mdash;absolutely not guilty. As a matter of fact, Mr.
  Sinclair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Denver, shut him up and make him sit down."</p>

  <p>One hard, brown hand was clapped over Jig's mouth. The other thrust him
  back on the black rock.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen of the jury," said his honor, "you've heard the prisoner say he
  didn't do it. Now we'll get down to the truth of it. What's the witnesses for
  the prosecution got to say?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause of consideration.</p>

  <p>"Speak up pronto," said Sinclair. "Anybody know anything agin' the
  prisoner?"</p>

  <p>Larsen stepped forward. "Your honor, it's pretty generally known
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't give a doggone for what's generally known. What d'you know?"</p>

  <p>The Swede's smile did not alter in the slightest, but his voice became
  blunter, more acrid. From that moment he made up his mind firmly that he
  wanted to see John Irving Gaspar, otherwise Jig, hanged from the cottonwood
  tree above them.</p>

  <p>"I was over to Shorty Lander's store the other day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His honor raised his hand in weary protest, as he smiled apologetically at
  the court. "Darned if I didn't plumb forget one thing," he said. "We got to
  swear in these witnesses before they can chatter. Is there anybody got a
  Bible around 'em? Nope? Montana, I wished you'd lope over to that house and
  see what they got in the line of Bibles."</p>

  <p>Montana strode away in the direction of the house, and quiet fell over the
  unique courtroom. Larsen, so pleasant of face and so unbending of heart, was
  the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"Looks to me, gents, like we're wasting a lot of time on a rat!"</p>

  <p>The blond head of Cold Feet turned, and his large, dark eyes rested
  without expression upon the face of the Swede. He seemed almost literally to
  fold his hands and await the result of his trial. The illusion was so
  complete that even Riley Sinclair began to feel that the prisoner might be
  guilty &mdash;of an act which he himself had done! The opportunity was indeed
  too perfect to be dismissed without consideration. It was in his power
  definitely to put the blame on another man; then he could remain in this
  community as long as he wished, to work his will upon Sandersen.</p>

  <p>Sandersen himself was a great problem. If Bill had spoken up in good faith
  to save Sinclair from the posse that morning, the Riley felt that he was
  disarmed. But a profound suspicion remained with him that Sandersen guessed
  his mission, and was purposely trying to brush away the wrath of the avenger.
  It would take time to discover the truth, but to secure that time it was
  necessary to settle the blame for the killing. Cold Feet was a futile,
  weak-handed little coward. In the stern scheme of Sinclair's life, the death
  of such a man was almost less than nothing.</p>

  <p>"Wasting a lot of time on a rat!"</p>

  <p>The voice of Larsen fell agreeably upon the ear of his honor. Behind that
  voice came a faraway murmur, the scream of a hawk. He bent his head back and
  looked up through the limbs of the cottonwood into the pale blue-white haze
  of the morning sky.</p>

  <p>A speck drifted across it, the hawk sailing in search of prey. Under the
  noble arch of heaven floated that fierce, malignant creature!</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair lowered his head with a sigh. Was not he himself playing
  the part of the hawk? He looked straight into the eyes of the prisoner, and
  Jig met the gaze without flinching. He merely smiled in an apologetic manner,
  and he made a little gesture with his right hand, as if to admit that he was
  helpless, and that he cast himself upon the good will of Riley Sinclair.
  Riley jerked his head to one side and scowled. He hated that appeal. He
  wanted this hanging to be the work of seven men, not of one.</p>

  <p>Montana returned, bringing with him a yellow-covered, red-backed book.
  "They wasn't a sign of a Bible in the house," he stated, "but I found this
  here history of the United States, with the Declaration of Independence
  pasted into the back of it. I figured that ought to do about as well as a
  Bible."</p>

  <p>"You got a good head, Montana," said his honor. "Open up to that there
  Declaration. Here, Larsen, put your hand on this and swear you're telling the
  truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. They ain't going to be any
  bum testimony taken in this court. We ain't going to railroad this lynching
  through."</p>

  <p>He caught a glistening light of gratitude in the eyes of the
  schoolteacher. Riley's own breast swelled with a sense of virtue. He had
  never before taken the life of a helpless man; and now that it was necessary,
  he would do it almost legally.</p>

  <p>Larsen willingly took the oath. "I'm going to tell the truth, the whole
  truth, and nothing but the truth, damn me if I don't! I was over to Shorty
  Lander's store the other day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What day?"</p>

  <p>"Hmm! Last Tuesday, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Larsen, but gimme nothin' but the facts."</p>

  <p>"I seen Jig come into the store. 'I want to look at a revolver,'" he
  said.</p>

  <p>"'The deuce you do! What might you want to do with a revolver, Jig?' says
  Shorty. 'You mean you want a toy gun?'</p>

  <p>"I remember them words particular clear, because I didn't see how even a
  spineless gent like Jig could stand for such a pile of insult. But he just
  sort of smiled with his lips and got steady with his eyes, like he was sort
  of grieved.</p>

  <p>"'I want a gun that'll kill a man,' he says to Shorty.</p>

  <p>"Shorty and me both laughed, but, when Shorty brung out a forty-five,
  doggone me if Jig didn't buy the gun.</p>

  <p>"'Look here,' says he, 'is this the way it works?'</p>

  <p>"And he raises it up in his skinny hand. I had to laugh.</p>

  <p>"'Hold it in both hands,' says I.</p>

  <p>"'Oh,' says he, and darned if he didn't take it in both hands.</p>

  <p>"'It seems much easier to handle in this way,' says he.</p>

  <p>"But that's what I seen. I seen him buy a gun to kill a man. Them was his
  words, and I figure they're a mouthful."</p>

  <p>Larsen retired.</p>

  <p>"Damagin' evidence, they ain't no question," said Mr. Clerk severely. "But
  I can lay over it, your honor."</p>

  <p>"Blaze away, judge."</p>

  <p>Larsen took the oath. "I'm going to show you they was bad feelings between
  the prisoner and the dead man, your honor. I was over to the dance at the
  Woodville schoolhouse a couple of weeks ago. Jig was there, not dancing or
  nothing, but sitting in a corner, with all the girls, mostly, hanging around
  him. They kept hanging around looking real foolish at him, and Jig looks back
  at 'em as if they wasn't there. Well, it riles the boys around these parts.
  Quade comes up to him and takes him aside.</p>

  <p>"'Look here,' he says, 'why don't you dance with one girl instead of
  hogging them all?'</p>

  <p>"'I don't dance,' says Jig.</p>

  <p>"'Why do you stay if you won't dance?' asks Quade.</p>

  <p>"'It is my privilege,' says Jig, smiling in that ornery way of his, like
  his thoughts was too big for an ordinary gent to understand 'em.</p>

  <p>"'You stay an' dance an' welcome,' says Quade, 'but if you won't dance,
  get out of here and go home where you belong. You're spoiling the party for
  us, keeping all the girls over here.'</p>

  <p>"'Is that a threat?' says Jig, smiling in that way of his.</p>

  <p>"'It sure is. And most particular I want you to keep away from Sally Bent.
  You hear?'</p>

  <p>"'You take advantage of your size,' says Jig.</p>

  <p>"'Guns even up sizes,' says Quade.</p>

  <p>"'Thank you,' says Jig. 'I'll remember.'</p>

  <p>"Right after that he went home because he was afraid that Quade would give
  him a dressing. But they was bad feelings between him and Quade. They was a
  devil in them eyes of Jig's when he looked at big Quade. I seen it, and I
  knowed they'd be trouble!" Lodge then retired.</p>

  <p>"Gents," said his honor, "it looks kind of black for the prisoner. We know
  that Gaspar had a grudge agin' Quade, and that he bought a gun big enough to
  kill a man. It sure looks black for you, Gaspar."</p>

  <p>The prisoner looked steadily at Sinclair. There was something unsettling
  in that gaze.</p>

  <p>"All we got to make sure of," said the judge, "is that that quarrel
  between Gaspar and Quade was strong enough to make Gaspar want to kill him,
  and &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your honor," broke in Gaspar, "don't you see that I could never kill a
  man?" The prisoner stretched out his hands in a gesture of appeal to
  Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Riley gritted his teeth. Suddenly a chill had passed through him at the
  thought of the hanging noose biting into that frail, soft throat. "You shut
  up till you're asked to talk," he said, frowning savagely. "I think we got a
  witness here that'll prove that you <i>did</i> have sufficient cause to make
  you want to get rid of Quade. And, if we have that proof, heaven help you.
  Montana, go get Sally Bent!"</p>

  <p>Gaspar started up with a ring in his voice. "No, no!"</p>

  <p>In response to a gesture from Sinclair, Denver Jim jerked the prisoner
  back onto the black rock. With blazing blue eyes, Gaspar glared at the judge,
  his delicate lips trembling with unspoken words.</p>

  <p>Sinclair knew, with another strange falling of the heart, that the
  prisoner was perfectly aware that his judge had not the slightest suspicion
  of his guilt. An entente was established between them, an entente which
  distressed Sinclair, and which he strove to destroy. But, despite himself, he
  could not get rid of the knowledge that the great blue eyes were fixed
  steadily upon him, as if begging him to see that justice was done.
  Consequently, the judge made himself as impersonal as possible.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

  <p class="first">Sally Bent came willingly, even eagerly. It was the
  eagerness of an angry woman who wanted to talk.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"A name you'll come to wish you'd never heard," said the girl, "if any
  harm comes to John Gaspar. Poor Jig, they won't <i>dare</i> to touch a hair
  of your head!"</p>

  <p>With a gentle voice she had turned to Gaspar to speak these last words. A
  faint smile came on the lips of Gaspar, and his gaze was far away, as if he
  were in the midst of an unimportant dream, with Sally Bent the last
  significant part of it all. The girl flushed and turned back to Riley.</p>

  <p>"I asked you your name," said his honor gravely.</p>

  <p>"What right have you to ask me my name, or any other question?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lodge," said his honor, "will you loosen up and tell this lady where
  we come in?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said the judge, clearing his throat. "Sally, here's the point.
  They ain't been much justice around here. We're simply giving the law a
  helping hand. And we start in today on the skunk that shot Quade. Quade may
  have had faults, but he was a man. And look at what done the killing! Sally,
  I ask you to look! That bum excuse for a man! That Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>Following the command, Sally looked at Gaspar, the smile of pity and
  sympathy trembling on her lips again. But Gaspar took no notice.</p>

  <p>"How dare you talk like that?" asked Sally. "Gaspar is worth all seven of
  you put together!"</p>

  <p>"Order!" said Riley Sinclair. "Order in this here court. Mr. Sergeant-at-
  arms, keep the witness in order."</p>

  <p>Larsen strode near authoritatively. "You got to stop that fresh talk,
  Sally. Sinclair won't stand for it."</p>

  <p>"Oscar Larsen," she cried, whirling on him, "I always thought you were a
  man. Now I see that you're only big enough to bully a woman. I&mdash;I never
  want to speak to you again!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" thundered Riley Sinclair, smiting his hard brown hands
  together. "Take that witness away and we'll hang Gaspar without her
  testimony. We don't really need it&mdash;anyways."</p>

  <p>There was a shrill cry from Sally. "Let me talk!" she pleaded. "Let me
  stay! I won't make no more trouble, Mr. Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"All right," he decided without enthusiasm. "Now, what's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Sally Bent." She smiled a little as she spoke. That name usually brought
  an answering smile, particularly from the men of Sour Creek. But Sinclair's
  saturnine face showed no softening.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Clerk, swear the witness."</p>

  <p>Judge Lodge rose and held forth the book and prescribed the oath.</p>

  <p>During that interval, Riley Sinclair raised his head to escape from the
  steady, reproachful gaze of John Gaspar. Down in the valley bottom, Sour
  Creek flashed muddy-yellow and far away. Just beyond, the sun gleamed on the
  chalk- faced cliff. Still higher, the mountains changed between dawn and full
  day. There was the country for Riley Sinclair. What he did down here in the
  valleys did not matter. Purification waited for him among the summit snows.
  He turned back to hear the last of Sally Bent's voice, whipping his eyes past
  Gaspar to avoid meeting again that clinging stare.</p>

  <p>"Sally Bent," he said, "do you know the prisoner?"</p>

  <p>"You know I know him. John Gaspar boards with us."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then you know him!"</p>

  <p>"That's a silly question. What I want to say is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait till you're asked, Sally Bent."</p>

  <p>She stamped her foot. Quietly Sinclair compared the girl and the accused
  man.</p>

  <p>"Here's the point," he said slowly. "You knew Quade, and you knew John
  Gaspar."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You know Quade's dead?"</p>

  <p>"I've just heard it."</p>

  <p>"You didn't like him much?"</p>

  <p>"I used to like him."</p>

  <p>"Until Gaspar blew in?"</p>

  <p>"You've got no right to ask those questions."</p>

  <p>"I sure have. All right, I gather you were pretty sweet on Quade till
  Gaspar come along."</p>

  <p>"I never said so!"</p>

  <p>"Girl," pronounced Riley solemnly, "ain't it a fact that you went around
  to a lot of parties and suchlike things with Quade?"</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"It's the straight thing you're giving her," broke in Larsen. "After
  Gaspar come, she didn't have no time for none of us!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said his honor significantly, scowling on Sally Bent. "After you cut
  out Quade, he got ugly, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He sure did!" said Sally. "He said things that no gentleman would of said
  to a lady."</p>

  <p>"Such as what?"</p>

  <p>"Such as that I was a flirt. And he said, I swear to it, that he'd get
  Gaspar!" She stopped, panting with excitement. "He wanted to murder John
  Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair lifted his heavy brows. "That's a pretty serious thing to
  say, Sally Bent."</p>

  <p>"But, it's the truth! And I've even heard him threaten Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>"But you tried to make them friends? You tried to smooth Quade down?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't waste my time on a bully! I just told John to get a gun and be
  ready to defend himself."</p>

  <p>"And he done it?"</p>

  <p>"He done it. But he never fired the gun."</p>

  <p>"What was the last time Quade seen you?"</p>

  <p>"The day before yesterday. He come up here and told me that he knew me and
  John Gaspar was going to get married, and that he wouldn't stand still and
  see the thing go through."</p>

  <p>"But what he said was right, wasn't it? Gaspar had asked you to marry
  him?"</p>

  <p>She dropped her head. "No."</p>

  <p>"What? You mean to say that Gaspar hadn't told you he loved you?"</p>

  <p>"Never! But now that John's in this trouble, I don't care if the whole
  world knows it! I love John Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>What a voice! What a lighted face, as she turned to the prisoner. But,
  instead of a flush of happiness, John Gaspar rose and shrank away from the
  outstretched hands of the girl. And he was pale&mdash;pale with sorrow, and
  even with pity, it seemed to Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said the soft voice of Gaspar. "Not that, Sally. Not that!"</p>

  <p>Decidedly it would not do to let this scene progress. "Take away the
  witness, Montana."</p>

  <p>Montana drew her arm into his, and she went away as one stunned, staring
  at John Gaspar as if she could not yet understand the extent of the calamity
  which had befallen her. She had been worse than scorned. She had been
  rejected with pity!</p>

  <p>As she disappeared into the door of her house, Sinclair looked at the
  bowed head of John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Denver!" he called suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, your honor."</p>

  <p>"The prisoner's hands are tied. Wipe the sweat off'n his face, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!"</p>

  <p>With a large and brilliant bandanna Montana obeyed. Then he paused in the
  midst of his operation.</p>

  <p>"Your honor."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't sweat. It's tears!"</p>

  <p>"Tears!" Riley Sinclair started up, then slumped back on his stump with a
  groan. "Tears!" he echoed, with a voice that was a groan. "John Gaspar, what
  kind of a man are you?"</p>

  <p>He turned back to the court with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jury," he said, "look at this prisoner we got. Look him over
  considerable. I say, did you ever see a man like that? A man that ain't able
  to love a girl like Sally Bent when she just about throws herself at his
  head? Is he worth keeping alive? Look at him, and then listen to me. I see
  the whole of it, Mr. Jury."</p>

  <p>Buck Mason leaned forward with interest, glowering upon John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"This skunk of a John Gaspar gets Sally all tied up with his sappy talk.
  Gets her all excited because he's something brand new and different. Quade
  gets sore, nacherallike. Then he comes to Gaspar and says: 'Cut out this soft
  talk to Sally, or I'll bust your head.' Gaspar don't love Sally, but he's
  afraid of Quade. He goes and gets a gun. He goes to Quade's house and tries
  to be friends. Quade kicks him out. Gaspar climbs back on his hoss and, while
  he's sitting there, pulls out a gun and shoots poor Quade dead. Don't that
  sound nacheral? He wouldn't marry Sally, but he didn't want another man to
  have her. And he wouldn't give up his soft berth in the house of Sally's
  brother. He knew Quade would never suspect him of having the nerve to fight.
  So he takes Quade unready and plugs him, while Quade ain't looking. Is that
  clear?"</p>

  <p>"It sure sounds straight to me," said Buck Mason.</p>

  <p>"All right! Stand up."</p>

  <p>Mason rose.</p>

  <p>"Take off your hat."</p>

  <p>The sombrero was withdrawn with a flourish.</p>

  <p>"God's up yonder higher'n that hawk, but seeing you clear, Buck. Tell us
  straight. Is Gaspar guilty or not?"</p>

  <p>"Guilty as hell, your honor!"</p>

  <p>A sigh from the prisoner. The last of life seemed to go from him, and
  Sinclair braced himself to meet a hysterical appeal. But there was only that
  slight drooping of the shoulders and declining of the head.</p>

  <p>It was an appalling thing for Sinclair to watch. He was used to power in
  men and beasts. He understood it. A cunning devil of a fighting outlaw horse
  was his choice for a ride. "The meaner they are, the longer they last," he
  used to say. He respected men of evil as long as they were men of action. He
  was perfectly at home and contented among men, where one's purse and life
  were at constant hazard, where a turned back might mean destruction.</p>

  <p>To him this meek surrender of hope was incomprehensibly despicable. If he
  had hesitated before, his hard soul was firm now in the decision that John
  Gaspar must die, and so leave Sinclair's own road free. With all suspicion of
  a connection between him and Quade's death gone, Riley could play a free hand
  against Sandersen. He turned a face of iron upon the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Sandersen and Denver Jim, bring the prisoner before me."</p>

  <p>They obeyed. But when they reached down their hands to Gaspar's shoulders
  to drag him to his feet, he avoided them with a shudder and of his own free
  will rose and walked between them.</p>

  <p>"John Irving Gaspar," said Sinclair sternly, "alias Jig, alias Cold Feet
  &mdash;which is a fitting and proper name for you&mdash;have you got anything
  to say that won't take too long before I pronounce sentence on you?"</p>

  <p>He had to set his teeth. The sad eyes of John Gaspar had risen from the
  ground and fixed steadily, darkly upon the eyes of his judge. There was
  infinite understanding, infinite patience in that look, the patience of the
  weak man, schooled in enduring buffets. For the moment Sinclair almost felt
  that the man was pitying him!</p>

  <p>"I have only a little to say," said John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Speak up then. Who d'you want to give the messages to?"</p>

  <p>"To no living man," said John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"All right then, Gaspar. Blaze away with the talk, but make it short."</p>

  <p>John Gaspar raised his head until he was looking through the stalwart
  branches of the cottonwood tree, into the haze of light above.</p>

  <p>"Our Father in Heaven," said John Gaspar, "forgive them as I forgive
  them!"</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair, quivering under those words, looked around him upon the
  stunned faces of the rest of the court; then back to the calm of Gaspar.
  Strength seemed to have flooded the coward. At the moment when he lost all
  hope, he became glorious. His voice was soft, never rising, and the great,
  dark eyes were steadfast. A sudden consciousness came to Riley Sinclair that
  God must indeed be above them, higher than the flight of the hawk, robed in
  the maze of that lofty cloud, seeing all, hearing all. And every word that
  Gaspar spoke was damning him, dragging him to hell.</p>

  <p>But Riley Sinclair was not a religious man. Luck was his divinity. He left
  God and heaven and hell inside the pages of the Bible, undisturbed. The music
  of the schoolteacher's voice reminded him of the purling of some tiny
  waterfall in the midst of a mountain wilderness.</p>

  <p>"I have no will to fight for life. For that sin, forgive me, and for
  whatever else I have done wrong. Let no knowledge of the crime they are
  committing come to these men. Fierce men, fighters, toilers, full of hate,
  full of despair, full of rage, how can they be other than blind? Forgive
  them, as I forgive them without malice. And most of all, Lord God, forgive
  this most unjust judge."</p>

  <p>"Louder!" whispered Sinclair, his hand cupped behind his ear.</p>

  <p>"Amen," said John Gaspar, as his head bowed again. The fascinated posse
  seemed frozen, each man in his place, each in his attitude.</p>

  <p>"John Gaspar," said his honor, "here's your sentence: You're to be hanged
  by the neck till you're dead."</p>

  <p>John Gaspar closed his eyes and opened them again. Otherwise he made no
  move of protest.</p>

  <p>"But not," continued Sinclair, "from this cottonwood tree."</p>

  <p>A faint sigh, indubitably of relief, came from the posse.</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair arose. "Gents," he said, "I been thinking this over. They
  ain't any doubt that the prisoner is guilty, and they ain't any doubt that
  John Gaspar is no good, anyway you look at him. But a gent that can put the
  words together like he can, ought to get a chance to talk in front of a
  regular jury. I figure we'd better send for the sheriff to come over from
  Woodville and take the prisoner back there. One of you gents can slide over
  there today, and the sheriff'll be here tomorrow, mostlike."</p>

  <p>"But who'll take charge of Gaspar?"</p>

  <p>"Who? Why me, of course! Unless somebody else would like the job more?
  I'll keep him right here in the Bent cabin."</p>

  <p>"Sinclair," protested Buck Mason, "you're a pretty capable sort. They
  ain't no doubt of that. But what if Jerry Bent comes home, which he's sure to
  do before night? There'd be a mess, because Jerry'd fight for Gaspar, I
  know!"</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Riley Sinclair dryly, "if it come to that, then I guess
  I'd have to fight back."</p>

  <p>It was foolish to question the power in that grave, sardonic face. The
  other men gave way, nodding one by one. Secretly each man, now that the
  excitement was gone, was glad that they had not proceeded to the last
  extremity. In five minutes they were drifting away, and all this time
  Sinclair watched the face of John Gaspar, as the sorrow changed to wonder,
  and the wonder to the vague beginnings of happiness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he felt that he had the clue to the mystery of Cold Feet. As a
  matter of fact John Gaspar had never grown up. He was still a weak, dreamy
  boy.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

  <p class="first">The posse had hardly thrown its masks to the wind and
  galloped down the road when Sally Bent came running from the house.</p>

  <p>"I knew they couldn't," she cried to John Gaspar. "I knew they wouldn't
  dare. The cowards! I'll remember every one of them!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" murmured Gaspar. His faint smile was for Riley Sinclair. "One of
  them is still here, you see!"</p>

  <p>With wrath flushing her face, the girl looked at Riley.</p>

  <p>"How do you dare to stay here and face me&mdash;after the things you
  said!"</p>

  <p>"Lady," replied Sinclair, "you mean after the things I made you say."</p>

  <p>"Just wait till Jerry comes," exclaimed Sally.</p>

  <p>At this Sinclair grew more sober.</p>

  <p>"Honey," he said dryly, "when your brother drops in, you just calm him
  down, will you? Because if him and Gaspar together was to start in raising
  trouble&mdash;well, they'd be more action than you ever seen in that cabin
  before. And, after it was all over, they'd have a dead Gaspar to cart over to
  Woodville. You can lay to that!"</p>

  <p>It took Sally somewhat aback, this confident ferociousness.</p>

  <p>"Them that brag ain't always the ones that do things," she declared. "But
  why are you staying here?"</p>

  <p>"To keep Gaspar till the sheriff comes for him."</p>

  <p>Sally grew white.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see that there's nothing to be afraid of?" asked John Gaspar.
  "See how close I came to death, and yet I was saved. Why, God doesn't let
  innocent men be killed, Sally."</p>

  <p>For a moment the girl stared at the schoolteacher with tears in her eyes;
  then she flashed at Riley a glance of utter scorn, as if inviting him to see
  what an angel upon the earth he was persecuting. But Sinclair remained
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>He informed them of the conditions of his stay. He must be allowed to keep
  John Gaspar in sight at all times. Only suspicious moves he would resent with
  violence. Sally Bent heard all of this with openly expressed hatred and
  contempt. John Gaspar showed no emotion whatever.</p>

  <p>"By heaven," declared Sinclair, when the girl had gone about some
  housework, "I'd actually think you believed that God was on your side. You
  talk about Him so familiar&mdash;like you and Him was partners."</p>

  <p>John Gaspar smiled one of his rare smiles. He had a way of looking for a
  long moment at another before he spoke. All that he was about to say was
  first registered in his face. It was easy to understand how Sally Bent had
  been entrapped by the classic regularity of those features and the strange
  manner of the schoolteacher. She lived in a country where masculine men were
  a drug on the market. John Gaspar was the pleasant exception.</p>

  <p>"You see," explained Gaspar, "I had to cheer Sally by saying something
  like that. Women like to have such things said. She'll be absolutely
  confident now, because she thinks I'm not disturbed. Very odd, but very
  true."</p>

  <p>"And it seems to me," said Sinclair, frowning, "that you're not much
  disturbed, Gaspar. How does that come?"</p>

  <p>"What can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'd be man enough to try to break away."</p>

  <p>"From you? Tush! I know it is impossible. I'd as soon try to hide myself
  in an open field from that hawk. No, no! I'll give you my parole, my word of
  honor that I'll make no escape."</p>

  <p>But Sinclair struck in with: "I don't want your parole. Hang it, man, just
  do your best, and I'll do mine. You try to give me the slip, and I'll try to
  keep you from it. That's square all around."</p>

  <p>Gaspar observed him with what seemed to be a characteristic air of
  judicious reserve, very much as if he suspected a trap. A great many words
  came up into the throat of Riley Sinclair, but he refrained from speech.</p>

  <p>In a way he was beginning to detest John Gaspar as he had never detested
  any human being before or since. To him no sin was so great as the sin of
  weakness in a man, and certainly Gaspar was superlatively weak. He had
  something in place of courage, but just what that thing was, Sinclair could
  not tell.</p>

  <p>Curiosity drew him toward the fellow; and these weaknesses repulsed him.
  No wonder that he stared at him now in a quandary. One certainty was growing
  upon him. He wished Gaspar to escape. It would bring him shame in Sour Creek,
  but for the opinion of these men he had not the slightest respect. Let them
  think as they pleased.</p>

  <p>It came home to Riley that this was a man whose like he had never known
  before, and whom he must not, therefore, judge as if he knew him. He softened
  his voice. "Gaspar," he said, "keep your head up. Make up your mind that
  you'll fight to the last gasp. Why, it makes me plumb sick to see a grown man
  give up like you do!"</p>

  <p>His scorn rang in his voice, and Gaspar looked at him in wonder.</p>

  <p>"You'd ought to be packing yourself full of courage," went on Sinclair.
  "Here's your pal, Jerry Bent, coming back. Two agin' one, you'll be. Ain't
  that a chance, I ask you?"</p>

  <p>But Gaspar shook his head. He seemed even a little amused.</p>

  <p>"Not against a man like you, Sinclair. You love fighting, you see. You're
  made for fighting. You make me think of that hawk. All beak and talons, made
  to tear, remorseless, crafty."</p>

  <p>"That's overrating me a pile," muttered Riley, greatly pleased by this
  tribute, as he felt it to be. "If you tried, maybe you could do a lot
  yourself. You're full of nerves, and a gent that's full of nerves makes a
  first-class fighting man, once he finds out what he can do. With them fingers
  of yours you could learn to handle a gun like a flash. Start in and learn to
  be a man, Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair stretched a friendly hand toward the shoulder of the smaller man.
  The hand passed through thin air. Gaspar had slipped away. He stood at a
  greater distance. On his face there was a strong expression of
  displeasure.</p>

  <p>Sinclair scowled darkly. "Now what d'you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that I don't envy you," said Gaspar steadily. "I'd rather have the
  other thing."</p>

  <p>"What other thing, Jig?"</p>

  <p>Gaspar overlooked the contemptuous nickname, doubly contemptuous on the
  lips of a stranger.</p>

  <p>"You go into the world and take what you want. I'm stronger than
  that."</p>

  <p>"How are you stronger?" asked Riley.</p>

  <p>"Because I sit in my room, and I can make the world come to me."</p>

  <p>"Jig, I was never smart at riddles. Go ahead and clear yourself up with a
  few more words."</p>

  <p>The other hesitated&mdash;not for words, but as if he wondered if it might
  be worth while for him to explain. Never in Riley Sinclair's life had he been
  taken so lightly.</p>

  <p>"Will you follow me into the house?" asked Gaspar at length.</p>

  <p>"I'll follow you, right enough," said Sinclair. "That's my job. Lead
  on."</p>

  <p>He was brought through the living room of the cabin and into a smaller
  room to the side.</p>

  <p>Comfort seemed to fill this smaller room. Bookcases ranged along one wall
  were packed with books. The couch before the window was heaped with cushions.
  There was an easy chair with an adjustable back, so that one could either sit
  or lie in it. There was a lamp with a big greenish-yellow shade.</p>

  <p>"This is what I mean," murmured Jig.</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair's bold eye roved swiftly, contemptuously. "Well, you got
  this place fixed up pretty stuffy," he answered. "Outside of that, hang me if
  I see what you mean."</p>

  <p>Cold Feet slipped into a chair and, interlacing those fingers whose
  delicacy baffled and disturbed Sinclair, stared over them at his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"I really shouldn't expect you to understand, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Friend!" Sinclair exploded. "You're a queer bird, Jig. What do you mean
  by 'friend'?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked this amazing youth, and the quiet of his face brightened
  into a smile. "I'd be swinging from the end of a rope if it weren't for you,
  you know."</p>

  <p>Sinclair shrugged away this rejoinder. He trod heavily to the bookshelves,
  took up two or three random volumes, and tossed them heedlessly back into
  place.</p>

  <p>"Well, kid, you're going to be yanked out of this little imitation world
  of yours pretty pronto."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but perhaps not!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Something may happen."</p>

  <p>"What can happen?"</p>

  <p>"Just something like you, my friend."</p>

  <p>The insistence on that word irritated Riley Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me that," he replied in his most brutal manner. "Jig, d'you
  know what a friend means?" he asked. "How d'you figure that word out?"</p>

  <p>Jig considered. "A friend is somebody you know and like and are glad to
  have around."</p>

  <p>Contempt spread on the face of Sinclair. "That's just about what I knew
  you'd say."</p>

  <p>"Am I wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Son, they ain't anything right about you, as far as I can make out.
  Wrong? You're as wrong as a yearling in a blizzard. Wrong? I should tell a
  man you're wrong! Lemme tell you what a friend is. He's the bunkie that
  guards your back in a fight; he's the man that can ask for your hoss or your
  gun or your life, no matter how bad you want 'em; he's the gent that trusts
  you when the world calls you a liar; he's the one that don't grin when you're
  in trouble, who gives a cheer when you're going good. With a friend you let
  down the bars and turn your mind loose like wild hosses. I take out my soul
  like a gun and show it to my friend in the palm of my hand. It's sure full of
  holes and stains, this life of mine, but my friend checks off the good agin'
  the bad, and when you're through he says: 'Partner, now I like you better
  because I know you better.'</p>

  <p>"Son, I don't know what God means very well, and I ain't any bunkie of the
  law, but I'm tolerable well acquainted with what the word 'friend' means.
  When you use it, you want to look sharp."</p>

  <p>"I really believe," Jig said, "that you would be a friend like that. I
  think I understand."</p>

  <p>"You don't, though. To a friend you give yourself away, and you get
  yourself back bigger and stronger."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," said Jig softly, "that friendship could mean all that.
  How many friends have you had?"</p>

  <p>The big cowpuncher paused. Then he said gently at length, "One
  friend."</p>

  <p>"In all your life?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! I was lucky and had one friend."</p>

  <p>Cold Feet leaned forward, eagerness in his eyes. "Tell me about him!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know you well enough, son."</p>

  <p>That jarring speech thrust Jig back into his chair, as if with a physical
  hand. There, as though in covert, he continued to study Sinclair. Presently
  he began to nod.</p>

  <p>"I knew it from the first, in spite of appearances."</p>

  <p>"Knew what?"</p>

  <p>"Knew that we'd get along."</p>

  <p>"And are we getting along, Jig?"</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>"Glad of that," muttered the cowpuncher dryly.</p>

  <p>"Ah," cried John Gaspar, "you're not as hard as you seem. One of these
  days I'll prove it. Besides, you won't forget me."</p>

  <p>"What makes you so sure of that?"</p>

  <p>Jig rose from his chair and stood leaning against it, his hands dropped
  lightly into the pockets of his dressing gown. He looked extraordinarily
  boyish at that moment, and he seemed to have the fearlessness of a child
  which knows that the world has no real account against it. Riley Sinclair set
  his teeth to keep back a flood of pity that rose in him.</p>

  <p>"You wait and see," said Jig. He raised a finger at Sinclair. "I'll keep
  coming back into your mind a long time after you leave me; and you'll keep
  coming back into my mind. Oh, I know it!"</p>

  <p>"How in thunder do you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Just because&mdash;well, how did I understand at the trial
  that you knew I was innocent, and that you would let no harm come to me?"</p>

  <p>"Did you know that?" asked Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, Jig broke into his soft, pleasant laughter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"

  <p class="first">"Laugh and be hanged," declared Sinclair. "I'm going
  outside. And don't try no funny breaks while I'm gone," he said. "I'll be
  watching and waiting when you ain't expecting." With that he was gone.</p>

  <p>At the door of the house a gust of hot wind struck him, for the day was
  verging on noon, and there seemed more heat than light in the sun. Even to
  that hot gust Sinclair jerked his bandanna knot aside and opened his throat
  gratefully. He felt as if he had been under a hard nervous strain for some
  time past. Cold Feet, the craven, the weak of hand and the frail of spirit,
  had tested him in a new way. He had been confronting a novel and
  unaccountable thing. He felt very oddly as if someone had been prodding into
  corners of his nature yet unknown even to himself. He tingled from the rapier
  touches of that last laughter.</p>

  <p>Now his eyes roamed with relief across the valley. Heat waves blurred the
  hollow and pushed Sour Creek away until it seemed a river of mist&mdash;
  yellow mist. He raised his attention out of that sweltering hollow to the
  cool, blue, mighty mountains&mdash;his country!</p>

  <p>Presently he had forgotten all this. He settled his hat on the back of his
  head and began to kick a stone before him, following it aimlessly.</p>

  <p>Someone was humming close to him, and he turned sharply to see Sally Bent
  go by, carrying a bucket. She smiled generously, and though he knew that she
  doubtless hated him in her heart and smiled for a purpose, he had to reply
  with a perfunctory grin. He stalked after her to the little leaping creek and
  dipped out a full bucket.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Sally, wantonly meeting his eye.</p>

  <p>As well try to soften a sphinx. Sinclair carried the dripping bucket on
  the side nearest the girl and thereby gained valuable distance. "I'm mighty
  glad it's you and not one of the rest," confided Sally, still smiling firmly
  up to him.</p>

  <p>He avoided that appeal with a grunt.</p>

  <p>"Like Sandersen, say," went on the girl.</p>

  <p>"Why not him?"</p>

  <p>"He's a bad hombre," said the girl. "Hate to have Jig in his hands. With
  you it's different."</p>

  <p>Sinclair waited until he had put down the bucket in the kitchen. Then he
  faced Sally thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because you're reasonable."</p>

  <p>"Did Jig tell you that?"</p>

  <p>"And a pile more. Jig says you're a pretty fine sort. That's his
  words."</p>

  <p>The cowpuncher caressed the butt of his gun with his fingertips, his
  habitual gesture when in doubt.</p>

  <p>"Lady," he said at length, "suppose I cut this short? You think I ain't
  going to keep Cold Feet here till the sheriff comes for him?"</p>

  <p>"You see what it would mean?" she asked eagerly. "It wouldn't be a fair
  trial. You couldn't get a fair jury for Jig around Sour Creek and Woodville.
  They hate him&mdash;all the young men do. D'you know why? Simply because he's
  different! Simply because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because all the girls are pretty fond of him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You can put it that way if you want," she answered steadily enough,
  though she flushed under his stare. Then: "you'll keep that in mind, and
  you're man enough to do what you think is right, ain't you, Mr.
  Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>He shifted away from the hand which was moving toward him.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," he answered. "I'm man enough to be afraid of a girl
  like you, Sally Bent."</p>

  <p>Then he saw her head fall in despair, as he turned away. When he reached
  the shimmering heat of the outdoors again, he was feeling like a murderer.
  His reason told him that Cold Feet was "yaller," not worth saving. His reason
  told him that he could save Jig only by a confession that would drive him,
  Sinclair, away from Sour Creek and his destined victim, Sandersen. Or he
  could save Jig by violating the law, and that also would drive him from Sour
  Creek and Sandersen.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he halted in the midst of his pacing to and fro. Why was he
  turning these alternatives back and forth in his mind? Because, he understood
  all at once, he had subconsciously determined that Cold Feet must not
  die!</p>

  <p>The face of his brother rose up and looked into his eyes. That was the
  friend of whom he would not speak to Jig, brother and friend at once. And as
  surely as ever ghost called to living man, that face demanded the death of
  Sandersen. He blinked the vision away.</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> going nutty," muttered Sinclair. "Whether Sandersen lives or
  dies, Jig ain't going to dance at a rope's end!"</p>

  <p>Presently Sally called him in to lunch, and Riley ate halfheartedly. All
  during the meal neither Sally nor John Gaspar had more than a word for him,
  while they talked steadily together. They seemed to understand each other so
  well that he felt a hidden insult in it.</p>

  <p>Once or twice he made a heavy attempt to enter the conversation, always
  addressing his remarks to Sally Bent. He was received graciously, but his
  remarks always fell dead, and a moment later Cold Feet had picked up the
  frayed ends of his own talk and won the entire attention of Sally. Riley was
  beginning to understand why the youth of that district detested Cold
  Feet.</p>

  <p>"Always takes some soft-handed dude to make a winning with a fool girl,"
  he comforted himself.</p>

  <p>He expected the arrival of Jerry Bent before nightfall, and with that
  arrival, perhaps, there would be a new sort of attack on him. Sally and Cold
  Feet were trying persuasion, but they might encourage Jerry Bent to attempt
  physical force. With all his heart Riley Sinclair hoped so. He had a peculiar
  desire to do something significant for the eyes of both Sally and Jig.</p>

  <p>But nightfall came, and then supper, and still no Jerry appeared.
  Afterward, Sinclair made ready to sleep in Jig's room. Cold Feet offered him
  the couch.</p>

  <p>"Beds and me don't hitch" declared Riley, throwing two or three of the
  rugs together. "I ain't particular partial to a floor, neither, but these
  here rugs will give it a sort of a ground softness."</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged on the low pile of rugs, while he pulled off his boots
  and smoked his good-night cigarette. Jig coiled up in a big chair, while he
  studied his jailer.</p>

  <p>"But how can you go to bed so early?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Early? It ain't early. Sun's down, ain't it? Why do they bring on night,
  except for folks to go to sleep?"</p>

  <p>"For my part the best part of the day generally begins when the sun goes
  down."</p>

  <p>With patient contempt Riley considered John Gaspar. "You look kind of that
  way," he decided aloud. "Pale and not much good with your shoulders. Now,
  what d'you most generally do with your time in the evening?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;talk."</p>

  <p>"Talk? Huh! A fine way of wasting time for a growed-up man."</p>

  <p>"And I read, you know."</p>

  <p>"I can see by the looks of them shelves that you do. How many of them
  books might you have read, Jig?"</p>

  <p>"All of them."</p>

  <p>"I ask you, man to man, ain't they mostly somebody's idea of what life
  is?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose that's a short way of putting it."</p>

  <p>"And I ask you ag'in, what's better to take a secondhand hunch out of what
  somebody else thinks life might be, or to go out and do some living on your
  own hook?"</p>

  <p>Cold Feet had been smiling faintly up to this point, as though he had many
  things in reserve which might be said at need. Now his smile disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right."</p>

  <p>"And maybe I ain't." Sinclair brushed the entire argument away into a thin
  mist of smoke. "Now, look here, Cold Feet, I'm about to go to sleep, and when
  I sleep, I sure sleep sound, taking it by and large. They's times when I
  don't more'n close one eye all night, and they's times when you'd have to
  pull my eyes open, one by one, to wake me up. Understand? I'm going to sleep
  the second way tonight. About eight hours of the soundest sleep you ever
  heard tell of."</p>

  <p>Jig considered him gravely.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he answered, "that I won't sleep nearly as well."</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair smiled. "Wouldn't be no ways nacheral for you to do much
  sleeping," he agreed. "Take a gent that's in danger of having his neck
  stretched, like you, and most generally he don't do much sleeping. He lies
  around awake, cussing his luck, I s'pose. Take you, now, Cold Feet, and I
  s'pose you'll be figuring on how far a hoss could carry you in the eight
  hours that I'll be sleeping. Eh?"</p>

  <p>There was a suggestive lift of the eyebrows, as he spoke, but before Jig
  had a chance to study his face, he had turned and wrapped himself in one of
  the rugs. He lay perfectly still, stretched on one side, with his back turned
  to Jig. He stirred neither hand nor foot.</p>

  <p>Outside, a door slammed heavily; Cold Feet heard the heavy voice of Jerry
  Bent and the beat of his heels across the floor. In spite of those noises
  Riley Sinclair was presently sound asleep, as he had promised. Gaspar knew it
  by the rise and fall of the arm which lay along Sinclair's side, also by the
  sound of his breathing.</p>

  <p>Cold Feet went to the window and looked out on the mountains, black and
  huge, with a faint shimmer of snow on the farthest summits. At the very
  thought of trying to escape into that wilderness and wandering alone among
  the peaks, he shuddered. He came back and studied the sleeper. Something
  about the nonchalance with which Sinclair had gone to sleep under the very
  eye of his prisoner affected John Gaspar strangely. Doubtless it was sheer
  contempt for the man he was guarding. And, indeed, something assured Jig
  that, no matter how well he employed the next eight hours in putting a great
  distance between himself and Sour Creek, the tireless riding of Sinclair
  would more than make up the distance.</p>

  <p>Gaspar went to the door, then turned sharply and glanced over his shoulder
  at the sleeper; but the eyes of Sinclair were still closed, and his regular
  breathing continued. Jig turned the knob cautiously and slipped out into the
  living room.</p>

  <p>Jerry and Sally beckoned instantly to him from the far side of the room.
  The beauty of the family had descended upon Sally alone. Jerry was a swart-
  skinned, squat, bow-legged, efficient cowpuncher. He now ambled awkwardly to
  meet John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Are you all set?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>"To start on the trail!" exclaimed Jerry. "What else? Ain't Sinclair
  asleep?"</p>

  <p>"How d'you know?"</p>

  <p>"I listened at the door and heard his breathing a long time ago. Thought
  you'd never come out."</p>

  <p>Sally Bent was already on the other side of Gaspar, drawing him toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"You can have my hoss, Jig," she offered. "Meg is sure as sin in the
  mountains. You won't have nothing to fear on the worst trail they is."</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," asserted Jerry.</p>

  <p>They half led and half dragged Cold Feet to the door.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you the best way. You see them two peaks yonder, like a pair of
  mule's ears? You start&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Jig. "It seems very difficult, even to think of
  riding alone through those mountains."</p>

  <p>Sally was white with fear. "You ain't going to throw away this chance,
  Jig? It'll mean hanging sure, if you don't run now. Ask Jerry what they're
  saying in Sour Creek tonight?"</p>

  <p>Jerry volunteered the information. "They're all wondering why you wasn't
  strung up today, when they got so much evidence agin' you. Also they're
  thinking that the boys played plumb foolish in turning you over to this
  stranger, Sinclair, to guard. But they're waiting for Sheriff Kern to come
  over from Woodville an' nab you in the morning. They's some that says that
  they won't wait, if it looks like the law is going to take too long to hang
  you. They'll get up a necktie party and break the jail and do their own
  hanging. I heard all them things and more, Jig."</p>

  <p>John Gaspar looked uncertainly from one to the other of his friends.</p>

  <p>"You've <i>got</i> to go!" cried Sally.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go," admitted Cold Feet in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I've got Meg saddled for you already. She's plumb gentle."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute. I've forgotten something."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean you're going back into that room where Sinclair is?"</p>

  <p>"I won't waken him. He's sleeping like the dead."</p>

  <p>Jig turned away from them and hurried back to his room. Having opened and
  closed the door softly, he went to a chest of drawers near the window and
  fumbled in the half-light of the low-burning lamp. He slipped a small leather
  case into the breast pocket of his coat, and then stole back toward the door,
  as softly as before. With his hand on the knob, he paused and looked back.
  For all he knew, Sinclair might be really awake now, watching his quarry from
  beneath those heavy lashes, waiting until his prisoner should have made a
  definite attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>And then the big man would rise to his feet as soon as the door was
  closed. The picture became startlingly real to John Gaspar. Sinclair would
  slip out that window, no doubt, and circle around toward the horse shed.
  There he would wait until his prisoner came out on Meg, and then without
  warning would come a shot, and there would be an end of Sinclair's trouble
  with his prisoner. Gaspar could easily attribute such cunning cruelty to
  Sinclair. And yet there was something untested, unprobed, different about the
  rangy fellow.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, it kept Gaspar staring down into the lean face of
  Sinclair for a long moment. Then he went resolutely back into the living room
  and faced Sally Bent; Jerry was already waiting outdoors.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going," said Gaspar slowly. "I'll stay."</p>

  <p>Sally cried out. "Oh, Jig, have you lost your nerve ag'in? Ain't you got
  <i>no</i> courage?"</p>

  <p>The schoolteacher sighed. "I'm afraid not, Sally. I guess my only courage
  comes in waiting and seeing how things turn out."</p>

  <p>He turned and went gloomily back to his room.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

  <p class="first">With the first brightness of dawn, Sinclair wakened even
  more suddenly that he had fallen asleep. There was no slow adjusting of
  himself to the requirements of the day. One prodigious stretching of the long
  arms, one great yawn, and he was as wide awake as he would be at noon. He
  jerked on his boots and rose, and not until he stood up, did he see John
  Gaspar asleep in the big chair, his head inclining to one side, the book
  half-fallen from his hand, and the lamp sputtering its last beside him. But
  instead of viewing the weary face with pity, Sinclair burst into sudden and
  amazed profanity.</p>

  <p>The first jarring note brought Gaspar up and awake with a start, and he
  stared in astonishment at the uninterrupted flood which rippled from the lips
  of the cowpuncher. It concluded: "Still here! Of all the shorthorned fatheads
  that I ever seen, the worst is this Gaspar&mdash;this Jig&mdash;this Cold
  Feet. Say, man, ain't you got no spirit at all?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Gaspar. "Still here? Of course I'm still here!
  Did you expect me to escape?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair flung himself into a chair, speechless with rage and disgust.</p>

  <p>"Did you think I was joking when I told you I was going to sleep eight
  hours without waking up?"</p>

  <p>"It might very well have been a trap, you know."</p>

  <p>Sinclair groaned. "Son, they ain't any man in the world that'll tell you
  that Riley Sinclair sets his traps for birds that ain't got their stiff
  feathers growed yet. Trap for you? What in thunder should I want you for,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>He strode to the window, still groaning.</p>

  <p>"There's where you'd ought to be, over yonder behind them mule ears.
  They'd never catch you in a thousand years with that start. Eight hours
  start! As good as have eight years, kid&mdash;just as good. And you've
  throwed that chance away!"</p>

  <p>He turned and stared mournfully at the schoolteacher.</p>

  <p>"It ain't no use," he said sadly. "I see it all now. You was cut out to
  end in a rope collar."</p>

  <p>Not another word could be pried from his set lips during breakfast, a
  gloomy meal to which Sally Bent came with red eyes, and Jerry Bent sullenly,
  with black looks at Sinclair. Jig was the cheeriest one of the party. That
  cheer at last brought another explosion from Sinclair. They stood in front of
  the house, watching a horseman wind his way up the road through the
  hills.</p>

  <p>"It's Sheriff Kern," said Jerry Bent. "I can tell by the way he rides,
  sort of slanting. It's Kern, right enough."</p>

  <p>Sally Bent choked, but Jig continued to hum softly.</p>

  <p>"Singin'?" asked Riley Sinclair suddenly. "Ain't you no more worried than
  that?"</p>

  <p>The voice of the schoolteacher in reply was as smooth as running water. "I
  think you'll bring me out of the trouble safely enough, Mr. Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sinclair'll see you damned before he lifts a hand for you!" Riley
  retorted savagely.</p>

  <p>He strode to his horse and expended his wrath by viciously jerking at the
  cinches, until the mustang groaned. Sheriff Kern came suddenly into clear
  view around the last turn and rode quickly up to them, a very short man,
  muscular, sweaty. He always gave the impression that he had been working
  ceaselessly for a week, and certainly he found time to shave only once in ten
  days. Dense bristle clouded the lower features of his face. He was a taciturn
  man. His greetings took the form of a single grunt. He took possession of
  John Gaspar with a single glance that sent the latter nervously toward his
  saddle horse.</p>

  <p>"I see you got this party all ready for me," said the sheriff more amiably
  to Riley Sinclair, who was watching in disgust the clumsy method of Jig's
  mounting. "You're Sinclair, I guess?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Sinclair, sheriff."</p>

  <p>They shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Nice bit of work you done for me, Sinclair, keeping the boys from
  stringing up Jig, yonder. These here lynchings don't set none too well on the
  reputation of a sheriff. I guess we're ready to start. S'long Sally&mdash;
  Jerry. Are you riding our way, Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd happen along. Ain't never seen Woodville yet."</p>

  <p>"Glad to have you. But they ain't much to see unless you look twice at the
  same thing."</p>

  <p>They started down the trail three abreast.</p>

  <p>"Ride on ahead," commanded Sinclair to Jig. "We don't want you riding in
  the same line with men. Git on ahead!"</p>

  <p>John Gaspar obeyed that brutal order with bowed head. He rode listlessly,
  with loose rein, letting the pony pick its own way. Once Sinclair looked back
  to Sally Bent, weeping in the arms of her brother. Again his face grew
  black.</p>

  <p>"And yet," confided the sheriff softly, "I ain't never heard no trouble
  about this Gaspar before."</p>

  <p>"He's poison," declared Sinclair bitterly, and he raised his voice that it
  would unmistakably carry to the shrinking figure before them. "He's such a
  yaller-hearted skunk, sheriff, that it makes me ashamed of bein' a man!"</p>

  <p>"They's only one thing I misdoubt," said the sheriff. "How'd that sort of
  a gent ever get the nerve to murder a man like Quade? Quade wasn't no
  tenderfoot, and he could shoot a bit, besides."</p>

  <p>"Speaking personal, sheriff, I don't think he done it, now I've had a
  chance to go over the evidence."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he didn't, but most like he'll hang for it. The boys is dead set
  agin' him. First, he's a dude; second, he's a coward. Sour Creek and
  Woodville wasn't never cut out for that sort. They ain't wanted around."</p>

  <p>That speech made Riley Sinclair profoundly thoughtful. He had known well
  enough before this that there were small chances of Jig escaping from the
  damning judgment of twelve of these cowpunchers. The statement of the sheriff
  made the belief a fact. The death sentence of Jig was pronounced the moment
  the doors of the jail at Woodville clanged upon him.</p>

  <p>They struck the trail to Sour Creek and almost immediately swung off on a
  branch which led south and west, in the opposite direction from the creek. It
  was a day of high-driving clouds, thin and fleecy, so that they merely
  filtered the sunlight and turned it into a haze without decreasing the heat
  perceptibly, and that heat grew until it became difficult to look down at the
  blazing sand.</p>

  <p>Now the trail climbed among broken hills until they reached a summit. From
  that point on, now and again the road elbowed into view of a wide plain, and
  in the center of the plain there was a diminutive dump of buildings.</p>

  <p>"Woodville," said the sheriff. "Hey, you, Jig, hustle that hoss
  along!"</p>

  <p>Obediently the drooping Gaspar spurred his horse. The animal broke into a
  gallop that set Gaspar jolting in the seat, with wildly flopping elbows.</p>

  <p>"Look at that," said Sinclair. "Would you ever think that men could be
  born as awkward as that? Would you ever think that men would be born that
  didn't have no use in the world?"</p>

  <p>"He ain't altogether useless," decided the sheriff. "Seems as how he's
  done noble in the school. Takes on with the little boys and girls most
  amazing, and he knows how to keep even the eighth graders interested. But
  what can you expect of a gent that ain't got no more pride than to be a
  schoolteacher, eh?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair shook his head.</p>

  <p>The trail drifted downward now less brokenly, and Woodville came into
  view. It was a wretched town in a wretched landscape, far different from the
  wild hills and the rich plowed grounds around Sour Creek. All that came to
  life in the brief spring, the long summer had long since burned away to drab
  yellows and browns. A horrible place to die in, Sinclair thought.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of hosses, that's a wise-looking hoss you got, sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Rode him for five years," said the sheriff. "Raised him and busted him
  and trained him all by myself. Ain't nobody but me ever rode him. He can go
  so soft-footed he wouldn't bust eggs, sir, and he can turn loose and run like
  the wind. They ain't no better hoss than this that's come under my eye,
  Sinclair. Are you much on the points of a hoss?"</p>

  <p>"I use hosses&mdash;I don't love 'em," said Sinclair gloomily. "But I can
  read the points tolerable."</p>

  <p>The sheriff eyed Sinclair coldly. "So you don't love hosses, eh?" he said,
  returning distantly to the subject. It was easy to see where his own heart
  lay by the way his roan picked up its head whenever its master spoke.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff," explained Sinclair, "I'm a single-shot gent. I don't aim to
  have no scatter fire in what I like. They's only one man that I ever called
  friend, they's only one place that I ever called home&mdash;the mountains,
  yonder&mdash;and they's only one hoss that I ever took to much. I raised
  Molly up by hand, you might say. She was ugly as sin, but they wasn't nothing
  she couldn't do&mdash;nothing!" He paused. "Sheriff, I used to talk to that
  hoss!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff was greatly moved. "What became of her?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>"I took after a gent once. He couldn't hit me, but he put a slug through
  Molly."</p>

  <p>"What became of the gent?" asked the sheriff still more softly.</p>

  <p>"He died just a little later. Just how I ain't prepared to state."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said the sheriff. He actually smiled in the pleasure of newfound
  kinship. "You and me would get on proper, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Most like."</p>

  <p>"This hoss of mine, now, has sense enough to take me home without me
  touching a rein. Knows direction like a wolf."</p>

  <p>"Could you guide her with your knees?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"And she's plumb safe with you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"I know a gent once that said he'd trust himself tied hand and foot on his
  hoss."</p>

  <p>"That goes for me and my hoss, too, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, just shove up them hands, sheriff!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff blinked, as the sun flashed on the revolver in the steady hand
  of Sinclair. There was a significant little jerking up of the revolver. Each
  time the muzzle stirred, the hands of the sheriff jumped higher and higher
  until his arms were stiffly stretched. Gaspar had halted his horse and looked
  back in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I hate to do it," declared Sinclair. "Right off I sort of took to you,
  sheriff. But this has got to be done."</p>

  <p>"Sinclair, have you done much thinking before you figured this all
  out?"</p>

  <p>"Enough! If I knowed you one shade better, sheriff, I'd take your word
  that you'd ride on into Woodville, good and slow, and not start no pursuit.
  But I don't know you that well. I got to tie you on the back of that steady
  old hoss of yours and turn you loose. We need that much start."</p>

  <p>He dismounted, still keeping careful aim, took the rope coiled beside the
  sheriff's own saddle horn and began a swift and sure process of tying. He
  worked deftly, without undue fear or haste, and Gaspar came back to look on
  with scared eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool, Sinclair," murmured the sheriff. "You'll never get shut of
  me. I'll foller you till I drop dead. I'll never forget you. Change your mind
  now, and we'll say nothing has happened. But if you keep on, you're done for
  as sure as my name is Kern. Take you by yourself, and you'd be a handful to
  catch. But two is easier than one, and, when one of them two is a deadweight
  like Gaspar, they ain't nothing to it."</p>

  <p>He finished his appeal completely trussed.</p>

  <p>"I ain't tied you on the hoss," said Sinclair. "Take note of that. Also
  I'm leaving you your guns, sheriff."</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll have a chance to see 'em come out of the holster later on,
  Sinclair."</p>

  <p>The cowpuncher took no notice of this bitterness. Gaspar, who looked on,
  was astonished by a certain deferential politeness on the part of the big
  cowpuncher.</p>

  <p>"Speaking personal, I hope I don't never have no trouble with you,
  sheriff. I like you, understand?"</p>

  <p>"Have your little joke, Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>"I mean it. I know I'm usin' you like a skunk. But I got a special need,
  and I can't take no chances. Sheriff, I tell you out of my heart that I'm
  sorry! Will you believe me?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff smiled. "The same as you'll believe me when we change parts,
  Sinclair."</p>

  <p>The big man sighed. "I s'pose it's got to be that way," he said. "But if
  you come for me, Kern, come all primed for action. It'll be a hard
  trail."</p>

  <p>"That's my specialty."</p>

  <p>"Well, sheriff, s'long&mdash;and good luck!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff nodded. "Thanks!"</p>

  <p>Pressing his horse with his knees, Kern started down the trail at a slow
  canter. Sinclair followed the retiring figure, nodding with admiration at the
  skill with which the sheriff kept his mount under control, merely by power of
  voice. Presently the latter turned a corner of the trail and was out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I knew&mdash;I knew!" exclaimed John Gaspar. "Only, why did you
  let him go on into town?" The cold glance of Sinclair rested on his
  companion. "What would you have done?"</p>

  <p>"Tied him up and left him here."</p>

  <p>"I think you would&mdash;to die in the sun!" He swung up into his saddle.
  "Now, Gaspar, we've started on what's like to prove the last trail for both
  of us, understand? By night we'll both be outlawed. They'll have a price on
  us, and long before night, Kern will be after us. For the first time in your
  soft-hearted life you've got to work, and you've got to fight."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, Mr. Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>"Bah! Save your talk. Talk's dirt cheap."</p>

  <p>"I only ask one thing. Why have you done it?"</p>

  <p>"Because, you fool, I killed Quade!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

  <p class="first">From the first there was no thought in the sheriff's mind of
  riding straight into Woodville, trussed and helpless as he was. Woodville
  respected him, and the whole district was proud of its sheriff. He knew that
  five minutes of laughter can blast the finest reputation that was ever built
  by a lifetime of hard labor. He knew the very faces of the men who would
  never let the story die, of how the sheriff came into town, not only without
  his prisoner, but tied hand and foot, helpless in the saddle.</p>

  <p>Without his prisoner!</p>

  <p>Never before in his twenty years as sheriff had a criminal escaped from
  his hands. Many a time they had tried, and on those occasions he had brought
  back a dead body for the hand of the law.</p>

  <p>This time he had ample excuse. Any man in the world might admit that he
  was helpless when such a fellow as Riley Sinclair took him by surprise. He
  knew Sinclair well by reputation, and he respected all that he had heard.</p>

  <p>No matter for that. The fact remained that his unbroken string of
  successes was interrupted. Perhaps Woodville would explain his failure away.
  No doubt some of the men knew of Sinclair and would not wonder. They would
  stand up doughtily for the prowess of their sheriff. Yet the fact held that
  he had failed. It was a moral defeat more than anything else.</p>

  <p>His mind was made up to remain in the mountains until he starved, or until
  he had removed those shameful ropes&mdash;his own rope! At that thought he
  writhed again. But here an arroyo opening in the ragged wall of a cliff
  caught his eye. He turned his horse into it and continued on his way until he
  saw a projecting rock with a ragged edge, left where a great fragment had
  recently fallen away.</p>

  <p>Here he found it strangely awkward and even perilous to dismount without
  his hands to balance his weight, as he shifted out of the stirrups. In spite
  of his care, he stumbled over a loose rock as he struck the ground and rolled
  flat on his back. He got up, grinding his teeth. His hands were tied behind
  him. He turned his back on the broken rock and sawed the ropes against it. To
  his dismay he felt the rock edge crumble away. It was some chalky, friable
  stuff, and it gave at the first friction.</p>

  <p>Beads of moisture started out on the sheriff's forehead. Hastily he
  started on down the arroyo and found another rock, with an edge not nearly so
  favorable in appearance, but this time it was granite. He leaned his back
  against it and rubbed with a short shoulder motion until his arms ached, but
  it was a happy labor. He felt the rock edge taking hold of the ropes, fraying
  the strands to weakness, and then eating into them. It was very slow
  work!</p>

  <p>The sun drifted up to noon, and still he was leaning against that rock,
  working patiently, with his head near to bursting, and perspiration, which he
  could not wipe away, running down to blind him. Finally, when his brain was
  beginning to reel with the heat, and his shoulders ached to numbness, the
  last strand parted. The sheriff dropped down to the ground to rest.</p>

  <p>Presently he drew out his jackknife and methodically cut the remaining
  bonds. It came to him suddenly, as he stood up, that someone might have seen
  this singular performance and carried the tale away for future laughter. The
  thought drove the sheriff mad. He swung savagely into the saddle and drove
  his horse at a dead run among the perilous going of that gorge. When he
  reached the plain he paused, hesitant between a bulldog desire to follow the
  trail single- handed into the mountains and run down the pair, and a
  knowledge that he who retreats has an added power that would make such a
  pursuit rash beyond words.</p>

  <p>A phrase which he had coined for the gossips of Woodville, came back into
  his mind. He was no longer as young as he once was, and even at his prime he
  shrewdly doubted his ability to cope with Riley Sinclair. With the weight of
  Gaspar thrown in, the thing became an impossibility. Gaspar might be a
  weakling, but a man who was capable of murder was always dangerous.</p>

  <p>To have been thwarted once was shame enough, but he dared not risk two
  failures with one man. He must have help in plenty from Woodville, and, fate
  willing, he would one day have the pleasure of looking down into the dead
  face of Sinclair; one day have the unspeakable joy of seeing the slender form
  of Gaspar dangling from the end of a rope.</p>

  <p>His mind was filled with the wicked pleasure of these pictures until he
  came suddenly upon Woodville. He drew his horse back to a dogtrot to enter
  the town.</p>

  <p>It was a short street that led through Woodville, but, short though it
  was, the news that something was wrong with the sheriff reached the heart of
  the town before he did. Men were already pouring out on the veranda of the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>"Where is he, sheriff?" was the greeting.</p>

  <p>Never before had that question been asked. He switched to one side in his
  saddle and made the speech that startled the mind of Woodville for many a
  day.</p>

  <p>"Boys, I've been double-crossed. Have any of you heard tell of Riley
  Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>He waited apparently calm. Inwardly he was breathless with excitement, for
  according to the size of Riley's reputation as a formidable man would be the
  size of his disgrace. There was a brief pause. Old Shaw filled the gap, and
  he filled it to the complete satisfaction of the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Young Hopkins was figured for the hardest man up in Montana way," he
  said. "That was till Riley Sinclair beat him. What about Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"It was him that double-crossed me," said the sheriff, vastly relieved.
  "He come like a friend, stuck me up on the trail when I wasn't lookin' for no
  trouble, and he got away with Gaspar."</p>

  <p>A chorus, astonished, eager. "What did he do it for?"</p>

  <p>"No man'll ever know," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because Sinclair'll be dead before he has a chance to look a jury in the
  face."</p>

  <p>There were more questions. The little crowd had got its breath again, and
  the words came in volleys. The sheriff cut sharply through the noise.</p>

  <p>"Where's Bill Wood?"</p>

  <p>"He's in town now."</p>

  <p>"Charley, will you find Billy for me and ask him to slide over to my
  office? Thanks! Where's Arizona and Red Chalmers?"</p>

  <p>"They went back to the ranch."</p>

  <p>"Be a terrible big favor if you'd go out and try to find 'em for me, boys.
  Where's Joe Stockton?"</p>

  <p>"Up to the Lewis place."</p>

  <p>Old Shaw struck in: "You ain't makin' no mistake in picking the best you
  can get. You'll need 'em for this Riley Sinclair. I've heard tell about him.
  A pile!"</p>

  <p>The very best that Woodville and its vicinity could offer, was indeed what
  the sheriff was selecting. Another man would have looked for numbers, but the
  sheriff knew well enough that numbers meant little speed, and speed was one
  of the main essentials for the task that lay before him. He knew each of the
  men he had named, and he had known them for years, with the exception of
  Arizona. But the latter, coming up from the southland, had swiftly proved his
  ability in many a brawl.</p>

  <p>Bill Wood was a peerless trailer; Red Chalmers would, the sheriff felt, be
  one day a worthy aspirant for the office which he now held, and Red was the
  only man the sheriff felt who could succeed to that perilous office. As for
  Joe Stockton, he was distinctly bad medicine, but in a case like this, it
  might very well be that poison would be the antidote for poison. Of all the
  men the sheriff knew, Joe was the neatest hand with a gun. The trouble with
  Joe was that he appreciated his own ability and was fond of exhibiting his
  prowess.</p>

  <p>Having sent out for his assistants on the chase, the sheriff retired to
  his office and set his affairs in order. There was not a great deal of paper
  work connected with his position; in twenty minutes he had cleared his desk,
  and, by the time he had finished this task, the first of his posse had
  sauntered into the doorway and stood leaning idly there, rolling a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Have a chair, Bill, will you?" said the sheriff. He tilted back in his
  own and tossed his heels to the top of his desk. "Getting sort of warm today,
  ain't it?"</p>

  <p>Bill Wood had never seen the sheriff so cheerful. He sat down gingerly,
  knowing well that some task of great danger lay before them.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

  <p class="first">All that Gaspar dreaded in Riley Sinclair had come true. The
  schoolteacher drew his horse as far away as the trail allowed and rode on in
  silence. Finally there was a stumble, and it seemed as if the words were
  jarred out from his lips, hitherto closely compressed: "<i>You</i> killed
  Quade!"</p>

  <p>A scowl was his answer.</p>

  <p>But he persisted in the inquiry with a sort of trembling curiosity, though
  he could see the angry emotions rise in Sinclair. The emotion of a murderer,
  perhaps?</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"With a gun, fool. How d'you think?"</p>

  <p>Even that did not halt John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Was it a fair fight?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe not. It won't bring him back to life!"</p>

  <p>Riley laughed with savage satisfaction. Gaspar watched him as a bird might
  watch a snake. He had heard tales of men who could find satisfaction in a
  murder, but he had never believed that a human being could actually gloat
  over his own savagery. He stared at Riley as if he were looking at a wild
  beast that must be placated.</p>

  <p>Thereafter the talk was short. Now and again Sinclair gave some curt
  direction, but they put mile after mile behind them without a single phrase
  interchanged. Gaspar began to slump in the saddle. It brought a fierce rebuke
  from Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Straighten up. Put some of your weight in them stirrups. D'you think any
  hoss can buck up when it's carrying a pile of lead? Come alive!"</p>

  <p>"It's the heat. It takes my strength," protested Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"Curse you and your strength! I wouldn't trade all of you for one ear of
  the hoss you're riding. Do what I tell you!"</p>

  <p>Without protest, without a flush of shame at this brutal abuse, John
  Gaspar attempted to obey. Then, as they topped a rise and reached a crest of
  a range of hills, Gaspar cried out in surprise. Sour Creek lay in the hollow
  beneath them.</p>

  <p>"But you're running straight into the face of danger!"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me what I'm doing. I know maybe, all by myself!"</p>

  <p>He checked his horse and sat his saddle, eying Gaspar with such disgust,
  such concentrated scorn and contempt, that the schoolteacher winced.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you in sight of the town so's you can go home."</p>

  <p>"And be hanged?"</p>

  <p>"You won't be hanged. I'll send a confession along with you. I've busted
  the law once. They're after me. They might as well have some more reasons for
  hitting my trail."</p>

  <p>"But is it fair to you?" asked Gaspar, intertwining his nervous
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Sinclair heard the words and eyed the gesture with unutterable disgust. At
  last he could speak.</p>

  <p>"Fair?" he asked in scorn. "Since when have you been interested in playing
  fair? Takes a man with some nerve to play fair. You've spoiled my game,
  Gaspar. You've blocked me every way from the start, Cold Feet. I killed
  Quade, and they's another in Sour Creek that needs killing. That's something
  you can do. Go down and tell the sheriff when he happens along and show him
  my confession. Go down and tell him that I ain't running away&mdash;that I'm
  staying close, and that I'm going to nab my second man right under his nose.
  That'll give him something to think about."</p>

  <p>He favored the schoolteacher with another black look and then swung out of
  the saddle, throwing his reins. He sat down with his back to a stunted tree.
  Gaspar dismounted likewise and hovered near, after the fashion of a man who
  is greatly worried. He watched while Sinclair deliberately took out an old
  stained envelope and the stub of a pencil and started to write. His brows
  knitted in pain with the effort. Suddenly Gaspar cried: "Don't do it, Mr.
  Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>A slight lifting of Sinclair's heavy brows showed that he had heard, but
  he did not raise his head.</p>

  <p>"Don't do what?"</p>

  <p>"Don't try to kill that second man. Don't do it!"</p>

  <p>Gaspar was rewarded with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>The schoolteacher was desperately eager. His glance roved from the set
  face of the cowpuncher and through the scragged branches of the tree.</p>

  <p>"You'll be damned for it&mdash;in your own mind. At heart you're a good
  man; I swear you are. And now you throw yourself away. Won't you try to open
  your mind and see this another way?"</p>

  <p>"Not an inch. Kid, I gave my word for this to a dead man. I told you about
  a friend of mine?"</p>

  <p>"I'll never forget."</p>

  <p>"I gave my word to him, though he never heard it. If I have to wait fifty
  years I'll live long enough to kill the gent that's in Sour Creek now. The
  other day I had him under my gun. Think of it! I let him go!"</p>

  <p>"And you'll let him go again. Sinclair, murder isn't in your nature.
  You're better than you think."</p>

  <p>"Close up," growled the cowpuncher. "It ain't no Saturday night party for
  me to write. Keep still till I finish."</p>

  <p>He resumed his labor of writing, drawing out each letter carefully. He had
  reached his signature when a low call from John Gaspar alarmed him. He looked
  up to find the little man pointing and staring up the trail. A horseman had
  just dropped over the crest and was winding leisurely down toward the plain
  below.</p>

  <p>"We can get behind that knoll, perhaps, before he sees us," suggested Jig
  in a whisper. His suggestion met with no favor.</p>

  <p>"You hear me talk, son," said Sinclair dryly. "That gent ain't carrying no
  guns, which means that he ain't on our trail, we being figured particularly
  desperate." He pointed this remark with a cold survey of the "desperate"
  Jig.</p>

  <p>"But the best way to make danger follow you, Jig, is to run away from it.
  We stay put!"</p>

  <p>He emphasized the remark by stretching luxuriously. Gaspar, however, did
  not seem to hear the last words. Something about the strange horseman had
  apparently riveted his interest. His last gesture was arrested halfway, and
  his color changed perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"You stay, then, Mr. Sinclair," he said hurriedly. "I'm going to slip down
  the hill and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You stay where you are!" cut in Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"But I have a reason."</p>

  <p>"Your reasons ain't no good. You stay put. You hear?"</p>

  <p>It seemed that a torrent of explanation was about to pour from the lips of
  Jig, but he restrained himself, white of face, and sank down in the shade of
  the tree. There he stretched himself out hastily, with his hands cupped
  behind his head and his hat tilted so far down over his face that his entire
  head was hidden.</p>

  <p>Sinclair followed these proceedings with a lackluster eye.</p>

  <p>"When you <i>do</i> move, Jig," he said, "you ain't so slow about it.
  That's pretty good faking, take it all in all. But why don't you want this
  strange gent to see your face?"</p>

  <p>A slight shudder was the only reply; then Jig lay deadly still. In the
  meantime, before Sinclair could pursue his questions, the horseman was almost
  upon them. The cowpuncher regarded him with distinct approval. He was a man
  of the country, and he showed it. As his pony slouched down the slope,
  picking its way dexterously among the rocks, the rider met each jolt on the
  way with an easy swing of his shoulders, riding "straight up," just enough of
  his weight falling into his stirrups to break the jar on the back of the
  mustang.</p>

  <p>The stranger drew up on the trail and swung the head of his horse in
  toward the tree, raising his hand in cavalier greeting. He was a sunbrowned
  fellow, as tall as Sinclair and more heavily built; as for his age, he seemed
  in that joyous prime of physical life, twenty-five. Sinclair nodded
  amiably.</p>

  <p>"Might that be Sour Creek yonder?" asked the brown man.</p>

  <p>"It might be. I reckon it is. Get down and rest your hoss."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Maybe I will."</p>

  <p>He dropped to the ground and eased and stiffened his knees to get out the
  cramp of long riding. Off the horse he seemed even bigger and more capable
  than before, and now that he had come sufficiently close, so that the shadow
  from his sombrero's brim did not partially mask the upper part of his face,
  it seemed to Sinclair that about the eyes he was not nearly so prepossessing
  as around the clean-cut fighter's mouth and chin. The eyes were just a trifle
  too small, a trifle too close together. Yet on the whole he was a handsome
  fellow, as he pushed back his hat and wiped his forehead dry with a gay silk
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Sinclair noted, furthermore, that the other had a proper cowpuncher's
  pride in his dress. His bench-made boots molded his long and slender feet to
  a nicety and fitted like gloves around the high instep. The polished spurs,
  with their spoon-handle curve, gleamed and flashed, as he stepped with a
  faint jingling. The braid about his sombrero was a thing of price. These
  details Sinclair noted. The rest did not matter.</p>

  <p>"The kid's asleep?" asked the stranger, casting a careless glance at the
  slim form of Jig.</p>

  <p>"I reckon so."</p>

  <p>"He done it almighty sudden. Thought I seen him up and walking around when
  I come over the hill."</p>

  <p>"You got good eyes," said Sinclair, but he was instantly put on the
  defensive. He was heartily tired of Cold Feet Gaspar, his peculiarities, his
  whims, his weaknesses. But Cold Feet was his riding companion, and this was a
  stranger. He was thrown suddenly in the position of a defender of the
  helpless. "That's the way with these kids," he confided carelessly to the
  stranger. "They get out and ride fast for a couple of hours. Full of
  ambition, they are. But just when a growed man gets warmed up to his work;
  they're through. The kid's tired out."</p>

  <p>"Come far?" asked the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Tolerable long ways."</p>

  <p>Sinclair disliked questions, and for each interrogation his opinion of the
  newcomer descended lower and lower. His own father had raised him on a stern
  pattern. "What you mean by questions, Riley? What you can't figure out with
  your own eyes and ears and good common hoss sense, most likely the other gent
  don't want you to know." Thereafter he had schooled himself in this
  particular point. He could suppress all curiosity and go six months without
  knowing more than the nickname of a boon companion.</p>

  <p>"You come from Sour Creek, maybe?" went on the other.</p>

  <p>"Sort of," replied Sinclair dryly.</p>

  <p>His companion proceeded to dispense information on his own part so as to
  break the ice.</p>

  <p>"I'm Jude Cartwright."</p>

  <p>He paused significantly, but Sinclair's face was a blank.</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you, Mr. Cartwright. Mostly they call me Long Riley."</p>

  <p>"How are you, Riley?"</p>

  <p>They shook hands heartily. Cartwright took a place on the ground, cross-
  legged and not far from Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"I guess you don't know me?" he asked pointedly.</p>

  <p>"I guess not."</p>

  <p>"I'm of the Jesse Cartwright family."</p>

  <p>Sinclair smiled blankly.</p>

  <p>"Lucky Cartwright was my dad's name."</p>

  <p>"That so?"</p>

  <p>"I guess you ain't ever been up Montana way," said the stranger in disgust
  which he hardly veiled.</p>

  <p>"Not much," said Sinclair blandly.</p>

  <p>"I wished that I was back up there. This is a hole of a country down
  here."</p>

  <p>"Hossflesh and time will take you back, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"I reckon they will, when my job's done."</p>

  <p>He turned a disparaging eye upon Sour Creek and its vicinity.</p>

  <p>"Now, who would want to live in a town like that, can you tell me?"</p>

  <p>It occurred very strongly to Riley Sinclair that Cartwright had not yet
  fully ascertained whether or not his companion came from that very town. And,
  although the day before, he had decided that Sour Creek was most undesirable
  and all that pertained to it, this unasked confirmation of his own opinion
  grated on his nerves.</p>

  <p>"Well, they seems to be a few that gets along tolerable well in that town,
  partner."</p>

  <p>"They's ten fools for one wise man," declared Cartwright
  sententiously.</p>

  <p>Sinclair veiled his eyes with a downward glance. He dared not let the
  other see the cold gleam which he knew was coming into them. "I guess them's
  true words."</p>

  <p>"Tolerable true," admitted Cartwright. "But I've rode a long ways, and
  this ain't much to find at the end of the trail."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it'll pan out pretty well after all."</p>

  <p>"If Sour Creek holds the person I'm after, I'll call it a good-paying
  game."</p>

  <p>"I hope you find your friend," remarked Riley, with his deceptive softness
  of tone.</p>

  <p>"Friend? Hell! And that's where this friend will wish me when I heave in
  sight. You can lay to that, and long odds!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair waited, but the other changed his tack at once.</p>

  <p>"If you ain't from Sour Creek, I guess you can't tell me what I want to
  know."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not."</p>

  <p>The brown man looked about him for diversion. Presently his eyes rested on
  Cold Feet, who had not stirred during all this interval.</p>

  <p>"Son?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Kid brother?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>Cartwright frowned. "Not much of nothing, I figure," he said with marked
  insolence.</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," replied Sinclair, and again he glanced down.</p>

  <p>"He's slept long enough, I reckon," declared the brown man. "Let's have a
  look at him. Hey, kid!"</p>

  <p>Cold Feet quivered, but seemed lost in a profound sleep. Cartwright
  reached for a small stone and juggled it in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>"This'll surprise him," he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Better not," murmured Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Might land on his face and hurt him."</p>

  <p>"It won't hurt him bad. Besides, kids ought to learn not to sleep in the
  daytime. Ain't a good idea any way you look at it. Puts fog in the head."</p>

  <p>He poised the stone.</p>

  <p>"You might hit his eye, you see," said Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me!"</p>

  <p>But, as his arm twisted back for the throw, the hand of Sinclair flashed
  out and lean fingers crushed the wrist of Cartwright. Yet Sinclair's voice
  was still soft.</p>

  <p>"Better not," he said.</p>

  <p>They sat confronting each other for a moment. The stone dropped from the
  numbed fingers of Cartwright, and Sinclair released his wrist. Their
  characters were more easily read in the crisis. Cartwright's face flushed,
  and a purple vein ran down his forehead between the eyes. Sinclair turned
  pale. He seemed, indeed, almost afraid, and apparently Cartwright took his
  cue from the pallor.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said sneeringly. "You got your guns on. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair slipped off the cartridge belt.</p>

  <p>"Do I look better to you now?"</p>

  <p>"A pile better," said Cartwright.</p>

  <p>They rose, still confronting each other. It was strange how swiftly they
  had plunged into strife.</p>

  <p>"I guess you'll be rolling along, Cartwright."</p>

  <p>"Nope. I guess I like it tolerable well under this here tree."</p>

  <p>"Except that I come here first, partner."</p>

  <p>"And maybe you'll be the first to leave."</p>

  <p>"I'd have to be persuaded a pile."</p>

  <p>"How's this to start you along?"</p>

  <p>He flicked the back of his hand across the lips of Sinclair, and then
  sprang back as far as his long legs would carry him. So doing, the first leap
  of Sinclair missed him, and when the cowpuncher turned he was met with a
  stunning blow on the side of the head.</p>

  <p>At once the blind anger faded from the eyes of Riley. By the weight of
  that first blow he knew that he had encountered a worthy foeman, and by the
  position of Cartwright he could tell that he had met a confident one. The big
  fellow was perfectly poised, with his weight well back on his right foot, his
  left foot feeling his way over the rough ground as he advanced, always
  collected for a heavy blow, or for a leap in any direction. He carried his
  guard high, with apparent contempt for an attack on his body, after the
  manner of a practiced boxer.</p>

  <p>As for Riley Sinclair, boxing was Greek to him. His battles had been those
  of bullets and sharp steel, or sudden, brutal fracas, where the rule was to
  strike with the first weapon that came to hand. This single encounter, hand
  to hand, was more or less of a novelty to him, but instead of abashing or
  cowing him, it merely brought to the surface all his coldness of mind, all of
  his cunning.</p>

  <p>He circled Cartwright, his long arms dangling low, his step soft and quick
  as the stride of a great cat, and always there was thought in his face. One
  gained an impression that if ever he closed with his enemy the battle would
  end.</p>

  <p>Apparently even Cartwright gained that impression. His own brute
  confidence of skill and power was suddenly tinged with doubt. Instead of
  waiting he led suddenly with his left, a blow that tilted the head of
  Sinclair back, and then sprang in with a crushing right. It was poor tactics,
  for half of a boxer's nice skill is lost in a plunging attack. The second
  blow shot humming past Sinclair as the latter dodged; and, before the brown
  man could recover his poise, the cowpuncher had dived in under the guarding
  arms.</p>

  <p>A shrill cry rose from Cold Feet, a cry so sharp and shrill that it sent a
  chill down the back of Sinclair. For a moment he whirled with the weight of
  his struggling, cursing enemy, and then his right hand shot up over the
  shoulder of Cartwright and clutched his chin. With that leverage one
  convulsive jerk threw Cartwright heavily back; he rolled on his side, with
  Sinclair following like a wildcat.</p>

  <p>But Cartwright as he fell had closed his fingers on a jagged little stone.
  Sinclair saw the blow coming, swerved from it, and straightway went mad. The
  brown man became a helpless bulk; the knee of Sinclair was planted on his
  shoulders, the talon fingers of Sinclair were buried in his throat.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;he saw it only dimly through his red anger and hardly felt it
  at all&mdash;Jig's hands were tearing at his wrists. He looked up in dull
  surprise into the face of John Gaspar.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake," Jig was pleading, "stop!"</p>

  <p>But what checked Sinclair was not the schoolteacher. Cartwright had been
  fighting with the fury of one who sees death only inches away. Suddenly he
  grew limp.</p>

  <p>"You!" he cried. "You!"</p>

  <p>To the astonishment of Sinclair the gaze of the beaten man rested directly
  upon the face of Jig.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Gaspar admitted faintly, "it is I!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair released his grip and stood back, while Cartwright, stumbling to
  his feet, stood wavering, breathing harshly and fingering his injured
  throat.</p>

  <p>"I knew I'd find you," he said, "but I never dreamed I'd find you like
  this!"</p>

  <p>"I know what you think," said Cold Feet, utterly colorless, "but you think
  wrong, Jude. You think entirely wrong!"</p>

  <p>"You lie like a devil!"</p>

  <p>"On my honor."</p>

  <p>"Honor? You ain't got none! Honor!"</p>

  <p>He flung himself into his saddle. "Now that I've located you, the next
  time I come it'll be with a gun."</p>

  <p>He turned a convulsed face toward Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"And that goes for you."</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Riley Sinclair, "that's the best thing I've heard you say.
  Until then, so long!"</p>

  <p>The other wrenched his horse about and went down the trail at a reckless
  gallop, plunging out of view around the first shoulder of a hill.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

  <p class="first">Sinclair watched him out of sight. He turned to find that
  Jig had slumped against the tree and stood with his arm thrown across his
  face. It reminded him, with a curious pang of mingled pity and disgust, of
  the way Gaspar had faced the masked men of Sour Creek's posse the day before.
  There was the same unmanly abnegation of the courage to meet danger and look
  it in the eye. Here, again, the schoolteacher was wincing from the very
  memory of a crisis.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" exclaimed Sinclair. His contempt rang in his voice. "They
  ain't any danger now. Turn around here and buck up. Keep your chin high and
  look a man in the face, will you?"</p>

  <p>Slowly the arm descended. He found himself looking into a white and
  tortured face. His respect for the schoolteacher rose somewhat. The very fact
  that the little man could endure such pain in silence, no matter what that
  pain might be, was something to his credit.</p>

  <p>"Now come out with it, Gaspar. You double-crossed this Cartwright,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," whispered Jig.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me? Not that I make a business of prying into the affairs
  of other gents, but I figure I might be able to help you straighten things
  out with this Cartwright."</p>

  <p>He made a wry face and then rubbed the side of his head where a lump was
  slowly growing.</p>

  <p>"Of all the gents that I ever seen," said Sinclair softly, "I ain't never
  seen none that made me want to tangle with 'em so powerful bad. And of all
  the poisoned fatheads, all the mean, sneakin' advantage-takin' skunks that
  ever I run up again', this gent Cartwright is the worst. If his hide was
  worth a million an inch, I would have it. If he was to pay me a hundred
  thousand a day, I wouldn't be his pal for a minute." He paused. "Them, taking
  'em by and large, is my sentiments about this here Cartwright. So open up and
  tell me what you done to him."</p>

  <p>To his very real surprise the schoolteacher shook his head. "I can't do
  it."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Sinclair, cut to the quick. "Can't you trust me with it,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," murmured Gaspar, "of all the men in the world, you're the one I'd
  tell it to most easily. But I can't&mdash;I can't."</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you tell me or not. Whatever you done, it must have
  been plumb bad if you can't even tell it to a gent that likes Cartwright like
  he likes poison."</p>

  <p>"It was bad," said Jig slowly. "It was very bad&mdash;it was a sin. Until
  I die I can never repay him for what I have done."</p>

  <p>Sinclair recovered some of his good nature at this outburst of self-
  accusation.</p>

  <p>"I'll be hanged if I believe it," he declared bluntly. "Not a word of it!
  When you come right down to the point you'll find out that you ain't been
  half so bad as you think. The way I figure you is this, Jig. You ain't so
  bad, except that you ain't got no nerve. Was it a matter of losing your nerve
  that made Cartwright mad at you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was altogether that."</p>

  <p>Sinclair sighed. "Too bad! I don't blame you for not wanting to talk about
  it. They's a flaw in everything, Jig, and this is yours. If I was to be
  around you much, d'you know what I'd do?"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"I'd try to plumb forget about this flaw of yours: That's a fact. But as
  far as Cartwright goes, to blazes with him! And that's where he's apt to wind
  up pronto if he's as good as his word and comes after me with a gun. In the
  meantime you grab your hoss, kid, and slide back into Sour Creek and show the
  boys this here confession I've written. You can add one thing. I didn't put
  it in because I knowed they wouldn't believe me. I killed Quade fair and
  square. I give him the first move for his gun, and then I beat him to the
  draw and killed him on an even break. That's the straight of it. I know they
  won't believe it. Matter of fact I'm saying it for you, Jig, more'n I am for
  them!"</p>

  <p>It was an amazing thing to see the sudden light that flooded the face of
  the schoolteacher.</p>

  <p>"And I do believe you, Sinclair," he said. "With all my heart I believe
  you and know you couldn't have taken an unfair advantage!"</p>

  <p>"H'm," muttered Riley. "It ain't bad to hear you say that. And now trot
  along, son."</p>

  <p>Cold Feet made no move to obey.</p>

  <p>"Not that I wouldn't like to have you along, but where I got to go, you'd
  be a weight around my neck. Besides, your game is to show the folks down
  yonder that you ain't a murderer, and that paper I've give you will prove it.
  We'll drift together along the trail part way, and down yonder I turn up for
  the tall timber."</p>

  <p>To all this Jig returned no answer, but in a peculiarly lifeless manner
  went to his horse and climbed in his awkward way into the saddle. They went
  down the trail slowly.</p>

  <p>"Because," explained the cowpuncher, "if I save my hoss's wind I may be
  saving my own life."</p>

  <p>Where the trail bent like an elbow and shot sheer down for the plain and
  Sour Creek, Riley Sinclair pointed his horse's nose up to the taller
  mountains, but Jig sat his horse in melancholy silence and looked mournfully
  up at his companion.</p>

  <p>"So long," said Sinclair cheerily. "And when you get down yonder, it'll
  happen most likely that pretty soon you'll hear a lot of hard things about
  Riley Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"If I do&mdash;if I hear a syllable against you," cried the schoolteacher
  with a flare of color, "I'll&mdash;I'll drive the words back into their
  teeth!"</p>

  <p>He shook with his emotion; Riley Sinclair shook with controlled
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"Would you do all of that, partner? Well, I believe you'd try. What I mean
  to say is this: No matter what they say, you can lay to it that Sinclair has
  tried to play square and clean according to his own lights, which ain't
  always the best in the world. So long!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He found himself looking down into the quivering face
  of the schoolteacher.</p>

  <p>"Why, kid, you look all busted up!"</p>

  <p>"Riley," gasped Jig very faintly, "I can't go!"</p>

  <p>"And why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can't meet Jude."</p>

  <p>"Cartwright, eh? But you got to, sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"I'll die first."</p>

  <p>"Would your nerve hold you up through that?"</p>

  <p>"So easily," said Jig. There was such a simple gravity and despair in his
  expression that Sinclair believed it. He grunted and stared hard.</p>

  <p>"This Cartwright gent is worse'n death to you?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand, thousand times!"</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"I kind of wish," said Sinclair thoughtfully, "that I'd kept my grip a
  mite longer."</p>

  <p>"No, no!"</p>

  <p>"You don't wish him dead?"</p>

  <p>Jig shuddered.</p>

  <p>"You plumb beat me, partner. And now you want to come along with me?"
  Sinclair grinned. "An outlaw's life ain't what it's cracked up to be, son.
  You'd last about a day doing what I have to do."</p>

  <p>"You'll find," said the schoolteacher eagerly, "that I can stand it
  amazingly well. I'll&mdash;I'll be far, far stronger than you expect!"</p>

  <p>"Somehow I kind of believe it. But it's for your own fool sake, son, that
  I don't want you along."</p>

  <p>"Let me try," pleaded Jig eagerly.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head and seemed to change his mind in the very midst
  of the gesture.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked himself. "You'll get enough of it inside of a day. And
  then you'll find out that they's some things about as bad as death&mdash; or
  Cartwright. Come on, kid!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a weary ride that brought them to the end of that day
  and to a camping place. It seemed to Jig that the world was made up of
  nothing but the ups and downs of that mountain trail. Now, as the sun went
  down, they came out on a flat shoulder of the mountain. Far below them lay
  Sour Creek, long lost in the shadow of premature night which filled the
  valley.</p>

  <p>"Here we are, fixed up as comfortable as can be," said Sinclair cheerily.
  "There's water, and there's wood aplenty. What could a gent ask for more? And
  here's my country!"</p>

  <p>For a moment his expression softened as he looked over the black peaks
  stepping away to the north. Now he pointed out a grove of trees, and on the
  other side of the little plateau was heard the murmur of a feeble spring.</p>

  <p>Riley swung down easily from the saddle, but when Jig dismounted his knees
  buckled with weariness, and he slipped down on a rock. He was unheeded for a
  moment by the cowpuncher, who was removing from his saddle the quarters of a
  deer which he had shot at the foot of the mountain. When this task was ended,
  a stern voice brought Jig to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What's all this? How come? Going to let that hoss stand there all night
  with his saddle on? Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>"All right," replied the schoolteacher, but his voice quaked with
  weariness, and the cinch knot, drawn taut by the powerful hand of Jerry Bent,
  refused to loosen. He struggled with it until his fingers ached, and his
  panicky breath came in gasps of nervous excitement.</p>

  <p>Presently he was aware of the tall, dark form of Sinclair behind him, his
  saddle slung across his arm.</p>

  <p>"By guns," muttered Sinclair, "it ain't possible! Not enough muscle to
  untie a knot? It's a good thing that your father can't see the sort of a son
  that he turned out. Lemme at that!"</p>

  <p>Under his strong fingers the knot gave by magic.</p>

  <p>"Now yank that saddle off and put it yonder with mine."</p>

  <p>Jig pulled back the saddle, but when the full weight jerked down on him he
  staggered, and he began to drag the heavy load.</p>

  <p>"Hey," cut in the voice of the tyrant, "want to spoil that saddle, kid?
  Lift it, can't you?"</p>

  <p>Gaspar obeyed with a start and, having placed it in the required position,
  turned and waited guiltily.</p>

  <p>"Time you was learning something about camping out," declared the
  cowpuncher, "and I'll teach you. Take this ax and gimme some wood,
  pronto!"</p>

  <p>He handed over a short ax, heavy-headed and small of haft.</p>

  <p>"That bush yonder! That's dead, or dead enough for us."</p>

  <p>Plainly Jig was in awe of that ax. He carried it well out from his side,
  as if he feared the least touch against his leg might mean a cut. Of all
  this, Riley Sinclair was aware with a gradually darkening expression. He had
  been partly won to Jig that day, but his better opinion of the schoolteacher
  was being fast undermined.</p>

  <p>With a gloomy eye he watched John Gaspar drop on his knees at the base of
  the designated shrub and raise the ax slowly&mdash;in both hands! Not only
  that, but the head remained poised, hung over the schoolteacher's shoulder.
  When the blow fell, instead of striking solidly on the trunk of the bush, it
  crashed futilely through a branch. Riley Sinclair drew closer to watch. It
  was excusable, perhaps, for a man to be unable to ride or to shoot or to face
  other men. But it was inconceivable that any living creature should be so
  clumsy with a common ax.</p>

  <p>To his consummate disgust the work of Jig became worse and worse. No two
  blows fell on the same spot. The trunk of the little tree became bruised, but
  even when the edge of the ax did not strike on a branch, at most it merely
  sliced into the outer surface of the wood and left the heart untouched. It
  was a process of gnawing, not of chopping. To crown the terrible exhibition,
  Jig now rested from his labors and examined the palms of his hands, which had
  become a bright red.</p>

  <p>"Gimme the ax," said Sinclair shortly. He dared not trust himself to more
  speech and, snatching it from the hands of Cold Feet, buried the blade into
  the very heart of the trunk. Another blow, driven home with equal power and
  precision on the opposite side, made the tree shudder to its top, and the
  third blow sent it swishing to the earth.</p>

  <p>This brought a short cry of admiration and wonder from the schoolteacher,
  for which Sinclair rewarded him with one glance of contempt. With sweeping
  strokes he cleared away the half-dead branches. Presently the trunk was
  naked. On it Riley now concentrated his attack, making the short ax whistle
  over his shoulders. The trunk of the shrub was divided into handy portions as
  if by magic.</p>

  <p>Still John Gaspar stood by, gaping, apparently finding nothing to do. And
  this with a camp barely started!</p>

  <p>It was easier to do oneself, however, than to give directions to such
  stupidity. Sinclair swept up an armful of wood and strode off to the spot he
  had selected for the campfire, near the place where the spring water ran into
  a small pool. A couple of big rocks thrown in place furnished a windbreak.
  Between them he heaped dead twigs, and in a moment the flame was leaping.</p>

  <p>As soon as the fire was lighted they became aware that the night was well
  nigh upon them. Hitherto the day had seemed some distance from its final end,
  for there was still color in the sky, and the tops of the western mountains
  were still bright. But with the presence of fire brightness, the rest of the
  world became dim. The western peaks were ghostly; the sky faded to the ashes
  of its former splendor; and Jig found himself looking down upon thick night
  in the lower valleys. He saw the eyes of the horses glistening, as they
  raised their heads to watch. The gaunt form of Sinclair seemed enormous.
  Stooping about the fire, enormous shadows drifted above and behind him.
  Sometimes the light flushed over his lean face and glinted in his eyes. Again
  his head was lost in shadow, and perhaps only the active, reaching hands were
  illuminated brightly.</p>

  <p>He prepared the deer meat with incomprehensible swiftness, at the same
  time arranging the fire so that it rapidly burned down to a firm, strong,
  level bed of coals, and by the time the bed of coals were ready, the meat was
  prepared in thick steaks to broil over it.</p>

  <p>In a little time the rich brown of the cooking venison streaked across to
  Jig. He had kept at a distance up to this time, realizing that he was in
  disgrace. Now he drifted near. He was rewarded by an amiable grin from Riley
  Sinclair, whose ugly humor seemed to have vanished at the odor of the
  broiling meat.</p>

  <p>"Watch this meat cook, kid, will you? There's something you can do that
  don't take no muscle and don't take no knowledge. All you got to do is to
  keep listening with your <i>nose</i>, and if you smell it burning, yank her
  off. Understand? And don't let the fire blaze. She's apt to flare up at the
  corners, you see? And these here twigs is apt to burn through&mdash;these
  ones that keep the meat off'n the coals. Watch them, too. And that's all you
  got to do. Can you manage all them things at once?"</p>

  <p>Jig nodded gravely, as though he failed to see the contempt.</p>

  <p>"I seen a fine patch of grass down the hill a bit. I'm going to take the
  hosses down there and hobble 'em out." Whistling, Sinclair strode off down
  the hill, leading the horses after him.</p>

  <p>The schoolteacher watched him go, and when the forms had vanished, and
  only the echo of the whistling blew back, he looked up. The last life was
  gone from the sunset. The last time he glanced up, there had been only a few
  dim stars; now they had come down in multitudes, great yellow planets and
  whole rifts of steel-blue stars.</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket the old envelope which Sinclair had given him,
  examined the scribbled confession, chuckling at the crude labor with which
  the writing had been drawn out, and then deliberately stuffed the paper into
  a corner of the fire. It flamed up, singeing the cooking meat, but John
  Gaspar paid no heed. He was staring off down the hill to make sure that
  Sinclair should not return in time to see that little act of destruction. An
  act of self- destruction, too, it well might turn out to be.</p>

  <p>As for Sinclair, having found his pastureland, where the grass grew thick
  and tall, he was in no hurry to return to his clumsy companion. He listened
  for a time to the sound of the horses, ripping away the grass close to the
  ground, and to the grating as they chewed. Then he turned his attention to
  the mountains. His spirit was easier in this place. He breathed more easily.
  There was a sense of freedom at once and companionship. He lingered so long,
  indeed, that he suddenly became aware that time had slipped away from him,
  and that the venison must be long since done. At that he hurried back up the
  slope.</p>

  <p>He was hungry, ravenously hungry, but the first thing that greeted him was
  the scent of burning meat. It stopped him short, and his hands gripped
  involuntarily. In that first burst of passion he wanted literally to wring
  the neck of the schoolteacher. He strode closer. It was as he thought. The
  twigs had burned away from beneath the steak and allowed it to drop into the
  cinders, and beside the dying fire, barely illuminated by it, sat Jig, sound
  asleep, with his head resting on his knees.</p>

  <p>For a moment Sinclair had to fight with himself for control. All his
  murderous evil temper had flared up into his brain and set his teeth
  gritting. At length he could trust himself enough to reach down and set his
  heavy grip on the shoulder of the sleeper.</p>

  <p>Even in sleep Jig must have been pursued by a burdened consciousness of
  guilt. Now he jerked up his head and stammered up to the shadowy face of
  Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;all at once it happened. You see the fire
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the telltale odor of the charring meat struck his nostrils, and his
  speech died away. He was panting with fear of consequences. Now a new turn
  came to the fear of Cold Feet. It seemed that Riley Sinclair's hand had
  frozen at the touch of the soft flesh of Jig's shoulder. He remained for a
  long moment without stirring. When his hand moved it was to take Jig under
  the chin with marvelous firmness and gentleness at once and lift the face of
  the schoolteacher. He seemed to find much to read there, much to study and
  know. Whatever it was, it set Jig trembling until suddenly he shrank away,
  cowering against the rock behind.</p>

  <p>"You don't think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the voice of Sinclair broke in with a note in it that Jig had never
  heard before.</p>

  <p>"Guns and glory&mdash;a woman!"</p>

  <p>It came over him with a rush, that revelation which explained so many
  things&mdash;everything in fact; all that strange cowardice, and all that
  stranger grace; that unmanly shrinking, that more than manly contempt for
  death. Now the firelight was too feeble to show more than one thing&mdash;the
  haunted eyes of the girl, as she cowered away from him.</p>

  <p>He saw her hand drop from her breast to her holster and close around the
  butt of her revolver.</p>

  <p>Sinclair grew cold and sick. After all, what reason had she to trust him?
  He drew back and began to walk up and down with long, slow strides. The girl
  followed him and saw his gaunt figure brush across the stars; she saw the
  wind furl and unfurl the wide brim of his hat, and she heard the faint stir
  and clink of his spurs at every step.</p>

  <p>There was a tumult in the brain of the cowpuncher. The stars and the sky
  and the mountains and wind went out. They were nothing in the electric
  presence of this new Jig. His mind flashed back to one picture&mdash;Cold
  Feet with her hands tied behind her back, praying under the cottonwood.</p>

  <p>Shame turned the cowpuncher hot and then cold. He allowed his mind to
  drift back over his thousand insults, his brutal language, his cursing, his
  mockery, his open contempt. There was a tingle in his ears, and a chill
  running up and down his spine.</p>

  <p>After all that brutality, what mysterious sense had told her to trust to
  him rather than to Sour Creek and its men?</p>

  <p>Other mysteries flocked into his mind. Why had she come to the very verge
  of death, with the rope around her neck rather than reveal her identity,
  knowing, as she must know, that in the mountain desert men feel some touch of
  holiness in every woman?</p>

  <p>He remembered Cartwright, tall, handsome, and narrow of eye, and the fear
  of the girl. Suddenly he wished with all his soul that he had fought with
  guns that day, and not with fists.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

  <p class="first">At length the continued silence of the girl made him turn.
  Perhaps she had slipped away. His heart was chilled at the thought; turning,
  he sighed with relief to find her still there.</p>

  <p>Without a word he went back and rekindled the fire, placed new venison
  steaks over it, and broiled them with silent care. Not a sound from Jig, not
  a sound from the cowpuncher, while the meat hissed, blackened, and at length
  was done to a turn. He laid portions of it on broad, white, clean chips which
  he had already prepared, and served her. Still in silence she ate. Shame held
  Sinclair. He dared not look at her, and he was glad when the fire lost some
  of its brightness.</p>

  <p>Now and then he looked with wonder across the mountains. All his life they
  had been faces to him, and the wind had been a voice. Now all this was
  nothing but dead stuff. There was no purpose in the march of the mountains
  except that they led to the place where Jig sat.</p>

  <p>He twisted together a cup of bark and brought her water from the spring.
  She thanked him with words that he did not hear, he was so intent in watching
  her face, as the firelight played on it. Now that he held the clue,
  everything was as plain as day. New light played on the past.</p>

  <p>Turning away, he put new fuel on the fire, and when he looked to her
  again, she had unbelted the revolver and was putting it away, as if she
  realized that this would not help her if she were in danger.</p>

  <p>When at length she spoke it was the same voice, and yet how new! The
  quality in it made Sinclair sit a little straighter.</p>

  <p>"You have a right to know everything that I can tell you. Do you wish to
  hear?"</p>

  <p>For another moment he smoked in solemn silence. He found that he was
  wishing for the story not so much because of its strangeness, but because he
  wanted that voice to run on indefinitely. Yet he weighed the question pro and
  con.</p>

  <p>"Here's the point, Jig," he said at last. "I got a good deal to make up to
  you. In the first place I pretty near let you get strung up for a killing I
  done myself. Then I been treating you pretty hard, take it all in all. You
  got a story, and I don't deny that I'd like to hear it; but it don't seem a
  story that you're fond of telling, and I ain't got no right to ask for it.
  All I ask to know is one thing: When you stood there under that cotton wood
  tree, with a rope around your neck, did you know that all you had to do was
  to tell us that you was a woman to get off free?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"And you'd sooner have hung than tell us?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Sinclair sighed. "Maybe I've said this before, but I got to say it ag'in:
  Jig, you plumb beat me!" He brushed his hand across his forehead. "S'pose
  it'd been done! S'pose I had let 'em go ahead and string you up! They'd have
  been a terrible bad time ahead for them seven men. We'd all have been grabbed
  and lynched. A woman!"</p>

  <p>He put the word off by itself. Then he was surprised to hear her laughing
  softly. Now that he knew, it was all woman, that voice.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't really courage, Riley. After you'd said half a dozen words I
  knew you were square, and that you knew I was innocent. So I didn't worry
  very much&mdash;except just after you'd sentenced me to hang!"</p>

  <p>"Don't go back to that! I sure been a plumb fool. But why would you have
  gone ahead and let that hanging happen?"</p>

  <p>"Because I had rather die than be known, except to you."</p>

  <p>"You leave me out."</p>

  <p>"I'd trust you to the end of everything, Riley."</p>

  <p>"I b'lieve you would, Jig&mdash;I honest believe you would! Heaven knows
  why."</p>

  <p>"Because."</p>

  <p>"That ain't a reason."</p>

  <p>"A very good woman's reason. For one thing you've let me come along when
  you know that I'm a weight, and you're in danger. But you don't know what it
  means if I go back. You can't know. I know it's wrong and cowardly for me to
  stay and imperil you, but I <i>am</i> a coward, and I'm afraid to go
  back!"</p>

  <p>"Hush up," murmured Sinclair. "Hush up, girl. Is they anybody asking you
  to go back? But you don't really figure on hanging out here with me in the
  mountains, me having most of the gents in these parts out looking for my
  scalp?"</p>

  <p>"If you think I won't be such an encumbrance that I'll greatly endanger
  you, Riley."</p>

  <p>"H'm," muttered Sinclair. "I'll take that chance, but they's another
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't exactly nacheral and reasonable for a girl to go around in the
  mountains with a man."</p>

  <p>She fired up at that, sitting straight, with the fire flaring suddenly in
  her face through the change of position.</p>

  <p>"I've told you that I trust you, Riley. What do I care about the opinion
  of the world? Haven't they hounded me? Oh, I despise them!"</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the cowpuncher again.</p>

  <p>He was, indeed, so abashed by this outbreak that he merely stole a glance
  at her face and then studied the fire again.</p>

  <p>"Does this gent Cartwright tie up with your story?"</p>

  <p>All the fire left her. "Yes," she whispered.</p>

  <p>He felt that she was searching his face, as if suddenly in doubt of
  him.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me tell you&mdash;everything?"</p>

  <p>"Shoot ahead."</p>

  <p>"Some parts will be hard to believe."</p>

  <p>"Lady, they won't be nothing as hard to believe as what I've seen you do
  with my own eyes."</p>

  <p>Then she began to tell her story, and she found a vast comfort in seeing
  the ugly, stern face of Sinclair lighted by the burning end of his cigarette.
  He never looked at her, but always fixed his stare on the sea of blackness
  which was the lower valley.</p>

  <p>"All the trouble began with a theory. My father felt that the thing for a
  girl was to be educated in the East and marry in the West. He was full of
  maxims, you see. 'They turn out knowledge in cities; they turn out men in
  mountains,' was one of his maxims. He thought and argued and lived along
  those lines. So as soon as I was half grown&mdash;oh, I was a wild
  tomboy!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" cut in Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"I could really do the things then that you'd like to have a woman do,"
  she said. "I could ride anything, swim like a fish in snow water, climb, run,
  and do anything a boy could do. I suppose that's the sort of a woman you
  admire?"</p>

  <p>"Me!" exclaimed Riley with violence. "It ain't so, Jig. I been revising my
  ideas on women lately. Besides, I never give 'em much thought before."</p>

  <p>He said all this without glancing at her, so that she was able to indulge
  in a smile before she went on.</p>

  <p>"Just at that point, when I was about to become a true daughter of the
  West, Dad snapped me off to school in the East, and then for years and years
  there was no West at all for me except a little trip here and there in
  vacation time. The rest of it was just study and play, all in the East. I
  still liked the West&mdash;in theory, you know."</p>

  <p>"H'm," muttered Riley.</p>

  <p>"And then, I think it was a year ago, I had a letter from Dad with
  important news in it. He had just come back from a hunting trip with a young
  fellow who he thought represented everything fine in the West. He was big,
  good- looking, steady, had a large estate. Dad set his mind on having me
  marry him, and he told me so in the letter. Of course I was upset at the idea
  of marrying a man I did not know, but Dad always had a very controlling way
  with him. I had lost any habit of thinking for myself in important
  matters.</p>

  <p>"Besides, there was a consolation. Dad sent the picture of his man along
  with his letter. The picture was in profile, and it showed me a fine-looking
  fellow, with a glorious carriage, a high head, and oceans of strength and
  manliness.</p>

  <p>"I really fell in love with that picture. To begin with, I thought that it
  was destiny for me, and that I had to love that man whether I wished to or
  not. I admitted that picture into my inmost life, dreamed about it, kept it
  near me in my room.</p>

  <p>"And just about that time came news that my father was seriously ill, and
  then that he had died, and that his last wish was for me to come West at once
  and marry my chosen husband.</p>

  <p>"Of course I came at once. I was too sick and sad for Dad to think much
  about my own future, and when I stepped off the train I met the first shock.
  My husband to be was waiting for me. He was enough like the picture for me to
  recognize him, and that was all. He was tall and strong enough and manly
  enough. But in full face I thought he was narrow between the eyes. And
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was Cartwright!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. How did you guess that?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said Sinclair softly, "but when that gent rode off today,
  something told me that I was going to tangle with him later on. Go on!"</p>

  <p>"He was very kind to me. After the first moment of disappointment&mdash;
  you see, I had been dreaming about him for a good many weeks&mdash;I grew to
  like him and accept him again. He did all that he could to make the trip home
  agreeable. He didn't press himself on me. He did nothing to make me feel that
  he understood Dad's wishes about our marriage and expected me to live up to
  them.</p>

  <p>"After the funeral it was the same way. He came to see me only now and
  then. He was courteous and attentive, and he seemed to be fond of me."</p>

  <p>"A fox," snarled Sinclair, growing more and more excited, as this
  narrative continued. "That's the way with one of them kind. They play a game.
  Never out in the open. Waiting till they win, and then acting the devil. Go
  on!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right. His visits became more and more frequent. Finally
  he asked me to marry him. That brought the truth of my position home to me,
  and I found all at once that, though I had rather liked him as a friend, I
  had to quake at the idea of him as a husband."</p>

  <p>Sinclair snapped his cigarette into the coals of the fire and set his jaw.
  She liked him in his anger.</p>

  <p>"But what could I do? All of the last part of Dad's life had been pointed
  toward this one thing. I felt that he would come out of his grave and haunt
  me. I asked for one more day to think it over. He told me to take a month or
  a year, as I pleased, and that made me ashamed. I told him on the spot that I
  would marry him, but that I didn't love him."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what he answered&mdash;curse him!" exclaimed Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Through the years that was comin', he'd teach you to love him."</p>

  <p>"That was exactly what he said in those very words! How did you guess
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you I got a sort of a second sight for the ways of a snake, or
  an ornery hoss, or a sneak of a man. Go on!"</p>

  <p>"I think you have. At any rate, after I had told him I'd marry him, he
  pressed me to set the date as early as possible, and I agreed. There was only
  a ten-day interval.</p>

  <p>"Those ten days were filled. I kept myself busy so that I wouldn't have a
  chance to think about the future, though of course I didn't really know how I
  dreaded it. I talked to the only girl who was near enough to me to be called
  a friend.</p>

  <p>"'Find a man you can respect. That's the main thing,' she always said.
  'You'll learn to love him later on.'</p>

  <p>"It was a great comfort to me. I kept thinking back to that advice all the
  time."</p>

  <p>"They's nothing worse than a talky woman," declared Sinclair hotly. "Go
  on!"</p>

  <p>"Then, all at once, the day came. I'll never forget how I wakened that
  morning and looked out at the sun. I had a queer feeling that even the
  sunshine would never seem the same after that day. It was like going to a
  death."</p>

  <p>"So you went to this gent and told him just how you felt, and he let your
  promise slide?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Sinclair groaned.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't go to him. I didn't dare. I don't imagine that I ever thought
  of such a thing. Then there were crowds of people around all day, giving me
  good wishes. And all the time I felt like death.</p>

  <p>"Somehow I got to the church. Everything was hazy to me, and my heart was
  thundering all the time. In the church there was a blur of faces. All at once
  the blur cleared. I saw Jude Cartwright, and I knew I couldn't marry
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Brave girl!" cried Sinclair, his relief coming out in almost a shout.
  "You stopped there at the last minute?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, if I had! No, I didn't stop. I went on to the altar and met him
  there, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You weren't married to him?"</p>

  <p>"I was!"</p>

  <p>"Go on," Sinclair said huskily.</p>

  <p>"The end of it came somehow. I found a flood of people calling to me and
  pressing around me, and all the time I was thinking of nothing but the new
  ring on my finger and the weight&mdash;the horrible weight of it!</p>

  <p>"We went back to my father's house. I managed to get away from all the
  merrymaking and go to my room. The minute the door closed behind me and shut
  away their voices and singing into the distance, I felt that I had saved one
  last minute of freedom. I went to the window and looked out at the mountains.
  The stars were coming out.</p>

  <p>"All at once my knees gave way, and I began to weep on the window sill. I
  heard voices coming, and I knew that I mustn't let them see me with the tears
  running down my face. But the tears wouldn't stop coming.</p>

  <p>"I ran to the door and locked it. Then someone tried to open the door, and
  I heard the voice of my Aunt Jane calling. I gathered all my nerve and made
  my voice steady. I told her that I couldn't let anyone in, that I was
  preparing a surprise for them.</p>

  <p>"'Are you happy, dear?' asked Aunt Jane.</p>

  <p>"I made myself laugh. 'So happy!' I called back to her.</p>

  <p>"Then they went away. But as soon as they were gone I knew that I could
  never go out and meet them. Partly because I had no surprise for them, partly
  because I didn't want them to see the tear stains and my red eyes. Somehow
  little silly things were as big and as important as the main thing&mdash;that
  I could never be the real wife of Jude Cartwright. Can you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Jig, once when I had a deer under my trigger I let him go because he had
  a funny-shaped horn. Sure, it's the little things that run a gent's life. Go
  on!"</p>

  <p>"I knew that I had to escape. But how could I escape in a place where
  everybody knew me? First I thought of changing my clothes. Then another thing
  &mdash;man's clothes! The moment that idea came, I was sure it was the thing.
  I opened the door very softly. There was no one upstairs just then. I ran
  into my cousin's room&mdash;he's a youngster of fifteen&mdash;and snatched
  the first boots and clothes that I could find and rushed back to my own
  room.</p>

  <p>"I jumped into them, hardly knowing what I was doing. For they were
  beginning to call to me from downstairs. I opened the door and called back to
  them, and I heard Jude Cartwright answer in a big voice.</p>

  <p>"I turned around and saw myself in the mirror in boy's clothes, with my
  face as white as a sheet, my eyes staring, my hair pouring down over my
  shoulders. I ran to the bureau and found a scissors. Then I hesitated a
  moment. You don't dream how hard it was to do. My hair was long, you see,
  below my waist. And I had always been proud of it.</p>

  <p>"But I closed my eyes and gritted my teeth and cut it off with great
  slashes, close to my head. Then I stood with all that mass of hair shining in
  my hand and a queer, light feeling in my head.</p>

  <p>"But I felt that I was free. I clamped on my cousin's hat&mdash;how queer
  it felt with all that hair cut off! I bundled the hair into my pocket,
  because they mustn't dream what I had done. Then someone beat on the
  door.</p>

  <p>"'Coming!' I called to them.</p>

  <p>"I ran to the window. The house was built on a slope, and it was not a
  very long drop to the ground, I suppose. But to me it seemed neck-breaking,
  that distance. It was dark, and I climbed out and hung by my hands, but I
  couldn't find courage to let go. Then I tried to climb back, but there wasn't
  any strength in my arms.</p>

  <p>"I cried out for help, but the singing downstairs must have muffled the
  sound. My fingers grew numb&mdash;they slipped on the sill&mdash;and then I
  fell.</p>

  <p>"The fall stunned me, I guess, for a moment. When I opened my eyes, I saw
  the stars and knew that I was free. I started up then and struck straight
  across country. At first I didn't care where I went, so long as it was away,
  but when I got over the first hill I made up a plan. That was to go for the
  railroad and take a train. I did it.</p>

  <p>"There was a long walk ahead of me before I reached the station, and with
  my cousin's big boots wobbling on my feet I was very tired when I reached it.
  There were some freight cars on the siding, and there was hay on the floor of
  one of them. I crawled into the open door and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>"After a while I woke up with a great jarring and jolting and noise. I
  found the car pitch dark. The door was closed, and pretty soon, by the roar
  of the wheels under me and the swing of the floor of the car, I knew that an
  engine had picked up the empty cars.</p>

  <p>"It was a terrible time for me. I had heard stories of tramps locked into
  cars and starving there before the door was opened. Before the morning shone
  through the cracks of the boards, I went through all the pain of a death from
  thirst. But before noon the train stopped, and the car was dropped at a
  siding. I climbed out when they opened the door.</p>

  <p>"The man who saw me only laughed. I suppose he could have arrested me.</p>

  <p>"'All right, kid, but you're hitting the road early in life, eh!'</p>

  <p>"Those were the first words that were spoken to me as a man.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know where I should go, but the train had taken me south, and
  that made me remember a town where my father had lived for a long time&mdash;
  Sour Creek. I started to get to this place.</p>

  <p>"The hardest thing I had to do was the very first thing, and that was to
  take my ragged head of hair into a barber shop and get it trimmed. I was sure
  that the barber would know I was a girl, but he didn't suspect.</p>

  <p>"'Been a long time in the wilds, youngster, eh?' was all he said.</p>

  <p>"And then I knew that I was safe, because people here in the West are not
  suspicious. They let a stranger go with one look. By the time I reached Sour
  Creek I was nearly over being ashamed of my clothes. And then I found this
  place and work as a schoolteacher. I think you know the rest." She leaned
  close to Sinclair. "Was I wrong to leave him?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair rubbed his chin. "You'd ought to have told him straight off," he
  said firmly. "But seeing you went through with the wedding&mdash;well, take
  it all in all, your leaving of him was about the rightest thing I ever heard
  of."</p>

  <p>Quiet fell between them.</p>

  <p>"But what am I going to do? And where is it all going to end?" a small
  voice inquired of Sinclair at last.</p>

  <p>"Roll up in them blankets and go to sleep," he advised her curtly. "I'm
  figuring steady on this here thing, Jig."</p>

  <p>Jig followed that advice. Sinclair had left the fire and was walking up
  and down from one end of the little plateau to the other, with a strong, long
  step. As for the girl, she felt that an incalculable burden had been shifted
  from her shoulders by the telling of this tale. That burden, she knew, must
  have fallen on another person, and it was not unpleasant to know that Riley
  Sinclair was the man.</p>

  <p>Gradually the sense of strangeness faded. As she grew drowsy, it seemed
  the most natural thing in the world for her to be up here at the top of the
  world with a man she had; known two days. And, before she slept, the last
  thing of which she was conscious was the head of Sinclair in the broad
  sombrero, brushing to and fro across the stars.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

  <p class="first">With a bang the screen door of Sheriff Kern's office had
  creaked open and shut four times at intervals, and each man, entering in turn
  with a "Howdy" to the sheriff, had stamped the dust out of the wrinkles of
  his riding boots, hitched up his trousers carefully, and slumped into a
  chair. Not until the last of his handpicked posse had taken his place did the
  sheriff begin his speech.</p>

  <p>"Gents," he said, "how long have I been a sheriff?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen to twenty years," said Bill Wood. "And it's been twenty years of
  bad times for the safecrackers and gunmen of these parts."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said the sheriff hastily. "And how many that I've once put my
  hands on have got loose?"</p>

  <p>Again Bill Wood answered, being the senior member.</p>

  <p>"None. Your score is exactly one hundred percent, sheriff."</p>

  <p>Kern sighed. "Gents," he said, "the average is plumb spoiled."</p>

  <p>It caused a general lifting of heads and then a respectful silence. To
  have offered sympathy would have been insulting; to ask questions was beneath
  their dignity, but four pairs of eyes burned with curiosity. The least
  curious was Arizona. He was a fat, oily man from the southland, whose past
  was unknown in the vicinity of Woodville, and Arizona happened to be by no
  means desirous of rescuing that past from oblivion. He held the southlander's
  contempt for the men and ways of the north. His presence in the office was
  explained by the fact that he had long before discovered it to be an
  excellent thing to stand in with the sheriff. After this statement from Kern,
  therefore, he first glanced at his three companions, and, observing their
  agitation, he became somewhat stirred himself and puckered his fat brows
  above his eyes, as he glanced back at Kern.</p>

  <p>"You've heard of the killing of Quade?" asked the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said Red Chalmers.</p>

  <p>"And that they got the killer?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"It was a gent you'd never have suspected&mdash;that skinny little
  schoolteacher, Gaspar."</p>

  <p>"I never liked the looks of him," said Red Chalmers gloomily. "I always
  got to have a second thought about a gent that's too smooth with the ladies.
  And that was this here Jig. So he done the shooting?"</p>

  <p>"It was a fight over Sally Bent," explained the sheriff. "Sandersen and
  some of the rest in Sour Creek fixed up a posse and went out and grabbed
  Gaspar. They gave him a lynch trial and was about to string him up when a
  stranger named Sinclair, a man who had joined up with the posse, steps out
  and holds for keeping Gaspar and turning him over to me, to be hung all
  proper and legal. I heard about all this and went out to the Bent house,
  first thing this morning, to get Gaspar, who was left there in charge of this
  Sinclair. Any of you ever heard about him?"</p>

  <p>A general bowing of heads followed, as the men began to consider, all save
  Arizona, who never thought when he could avoid it, and positively never used
  his memory. He habitually allowed the dead past to bury its dead.</p>

  <p>"It appears to me like I've heard of a Sinclair up to Colma," murmured
  Bill Wood. "That was four or five years back, and I b'lieve he was called a
  sure man in a fight."</p>

  <p>"That's him," muttered the sheriff. He was greatly relieved to know that
  his antagonist had already achieved so comfortable a reputation. "A big,
  lean, hungry-eyed gent, with a restless pair of hands. He come along with me
  while I was bringing Gaspar, but I didn't think nothing about it, most
  nacheral. I leave it to you, boys!"</p>

  <p>Settling themselves they leaned forward in their chairs.</p>

  <p>"We was talking about hosses and suchlike, which Sinclair talked uncommon
  slick. He seemed a knowing gent, and I opened up to him, but in the middle of
  things he paws out his Colt, as smooth as you ever see, and he shoves it
  under my nose."</p>

  <p>Sheriff Kern paused. He was wearing gloves in spite of the fact that he
  was in his office. These gloves seem to have a peculiarly businesslike
  meaning for the others, and now they watched, fascinated, while the sheriff
  tugged his fingers deeper into the gloves, as if he were getting ready for
  action. He cleared his throat and managed to snap out the rest of the
  shameful statement.</p>

  <p>"He stuck me up, boys, and he told Jig to beat it up the trail. Then he
  backed off, keeping me covered all the time, until he was around the hill.
  The minute he was out of sight I follered him, but when it come into view,
  him and Gaspar was high-tailing through the hills. I didn't have no rifle,
  and it was plumb foolish to chase two killers with nothing but a Colt. Which
  I leave it to you gents!"</p>

  <p>"Would have been crazy, sheriff," asserted Red Chalmers.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," sighed Arizona, patting his fat stomach reminiscently. "I
  dunno. I guess you was right, Kern."</p>

  <p>The others glared at him, and the sheriff became purple.</p>

  <p>"So I come back and figured that I'd best get together the handiest little
  bunch of fighting men I could lay hands on. That's why I sent for you
  four."</p>

  <p>Clumsily they made their acknowledgements.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Kern, "it don't take no senator to see that something has
  got to be done. Sour Creek is after Gaspar, and now it'll be after Sinclair,
  too. But they got clear of me, and I'm the sheriff of Woodville. It's up to
  Woodville to get 'em back. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Again they nodded, and the sheriff, growing warmer as he talked, snatched
  off a glove and mopped his forehead. As his arm fell, he noted that Arizona
  had seen something which fascinated him. His eyes followed every gesture of
  the sheriff's hand.</p>

  <p>"Is that the whole story?" asked Arizona.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing," declared Kern stoutly, and he glared at the man from
  the southland.</p>

  <p>"Because if it's anything worse," said Arizona innocently, "we'd ought to
  know it. The honor of Woodville is at stake."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's bad enough this way," grumbled Joe Stockton, and the sheriff,
  hastily restoring his glove, grunted assent.</p>

  <p>"Now, boys, let's hear some plans."</p>

  <p>"First thing," said Red Chalmers, rising, "is for each of us to pick out
  the best hoss in his string, and then we'll all ride over to the place where
  they left and pick up the trail."</p>

  <p>"Not a bad idea," approved Kern.</p>

  <p>There was a general rising.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Arizona, who alone had not budged in his chair.</p>

  <p>Without obeying, they turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Was that the Morris trail, Kern?" asked Arizona.</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Well, you ain't got a chance of picking up the trail of two hosses out of
  two hundred."</p>

  <p>In silence they received the truth of this assertion. Then Joe Stockton
  spoke. He was not exactly a troublemaker, but he took advantage of every
  disturbance that came his way and improved it to the last scruple.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair comes from Colma, according to Bill, and Colma is north. Ride
  north, Kern, and the north trail will keep us tolerable close to Sinclair. We
  can tend to Gaspar later on&mdash;unless he's a pile more dangerous'n he
  looks."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sinclair is the main one," said the sheriff. "He's more'n a hundred
  Gaspars. Boys, the north trail looks good to me. We can pick up Gaspar later
  on, as Joe Stockton says. Straight for Colma, that's where we'll strike."</p>

  <p>"Hold on," cut in Arizona.</p>

  <p>Patently they regarded him with disfavor. There was something blandly
  superior in Arizona's demeanor. He had a way of putting forth his opinions as
  though it were not the slightest effort for him to penetrate truths which
  were securely veiled from the eyes of ordinary men.</p>

  <p>Now he looked calmly, almost contemptuously upon the sheriff and the rest
  of the posse.</p>

  <p>"Gents, has any of you ever seen this Jig you talk about ride a hoss?"</p>

  <p>"Me, of course," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Anything about him strike you when he was in a saddle?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Got a funny arm motion."</p>

  <p>"Like he was fanning his ribs with his elbows to keep cool?" went on
  Arizona, grinning.</p>

  <p>The sheriff chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Would you pick him for a good hand on a long trail?"</p>

  <p>"Never in a million years," said the sheriff. "Is he?"</p>

  <p>Kern seemed to admit his inferiority by asking this question. He bit his
  lip and was about to go on and answer himself when Arizona cut in with:
  "Never in a million years, sheriff. He couldn't do twenty miles in a day
  without being laid up."</p>

  <p>"What's the point of all this, Arizona?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you pronto. Let's go back to Sinclair. The other day he was one
  of a bunch that pretty near got Gaspar hung, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yep."</p>

  <p>"But at the last minute he saved Jig?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I just been telling you that."</p>

  <p>Their inability to follow Arizona's train of thought irritated the others.
  He literally held them in the palm of his hand as he developed his
  argument.</p>

  <p>"Why did he save Jig?" he went on. "Because when Gaspar was about to
  swing, they was something about him that struck Sinclair. What was it? I
  dunno, except that Jig is tolerable young looking and pretty helpless, even
  though you say he killed Quade."</p>

  <p>"Say he killed him?" burst put the sheriff. "It was plumb proved on
  him."</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to see that proof," said the man from the southland. "The
  point is that Sinclair took pity on him and kept him from the noose. Then he
  stays that night guarding him and gets more and more interested. This Jig has
  got a pile of education. I've heard him talk. Today you come over the hills.
  Sinclair sees Woodville, figures that's the place where Jig'll be hung, and
  he loses his nerve. He sticks you up and gets Jig free. All right! D'you
  think he'll stop at that? Don't he know that Jig's plumb helpless on the
  trail? And knowing that, d'you think he'll split with Jig and leave the
  schoolteacher to be picked up the first thing? No, sir, he'll stick with Jig
  and see him through."</p>

  <p>"Well, all the better," snapped the sheriff. "That's going to make our
  trail shorter&mdash;if what you say turns out true."</p>

  <p>"It's true, well enough. Sinclair right now is camping somewhere in the
  hills near Sour Creek, waiting for things to quiet down before he hits the
  out- trail with this Gaspar."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't be fool enough for that," grumbled the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Fool? Has any one of you professional man hunters figured yet on hunting
  for 'em near Sour Creek? Ain't you-all been talking long trails&mdash;Colma,
  and what not?"</p>

  <p>They were crushed.</p>

  <p>"All you say is true, if Sinclair saddles himself with the tenderfoot.
  Might as well tie so much lead around his neck."</p>

  <p>"He'll do it, though," said Arizona carelessly. "I know him."</p>

  <p>It caused a new focusing of attention upon him, and this time Arizona
  seemed to regret that he stood in the limelight.</p>

  <p>"You know him?" asked Joe Stockton softly.</p>

  <p>The bright black eyes of the fat man glittered and flickered from face to
  face. He seemed to be gauging them and deciding how much he could say&mdash;
  or how little.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I drifted up to this country one season and rode there. I heard a
  pile about this Sinclair and seen him a couple of times."</p>

  <p>"How good a man d'you figure him to be with a gun?" asked the sheriff
  without apparent interest.</p>

  <p>"Good enough," sighed Arizona. "Good enough, partner!"</p>

  <p>Presently the sheriff showed that he was a man capable of taking good
  advice, even though he could not stamp it as his own original device.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, "I figure that what Arizona has said is tolerable sound.
  Arizona, what d'you advise next?"</p>

  <p>"That we go to Sour Creek pronto&mdash;and sit down and wait!"</p>

  <p>A chorus of exclamations arose.</p>

  <p>Arizona grew impatient with such stupidity. "Sinclair come to Sour Creek
  to do something. I dunno what he wants, but what he wants he ain't got yet,
  and he's the sort that'll stay till he does his work."</p>

  <p>"I've got in touch with the authorities higher up, boys," declared Kern.
  "Sinclair and Gaspar is both outlawed, with a price on their heads. Won't
  that change Sinclair's mind and make him move on?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know Sinclair," persisted Arizona. "You don't know him at all,
  sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Grab your hosses, boys. I'm following Arizona's lead."</p>

  <p>Pouring out of the door in silence, the omniscience of Arizona lay heavily
  upon their minds. Inside, the sheriff lingered with the wise man from the
  southland.</p>

  <p>"If I was to get in touch with Colma, Fatty, what d'you think they'd be
  able to tell me about your record up there?"</p>

  <p>The olive skin of Arizona became a bleached drab.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," he said rather thickly, and all the while his little black eyes
  were glittering and shifting. "Nothing much, Kern."</p>

  <p>His glance steadied. "By the way, when you had your glove off a while ago
  I seen something on your wrist that looked like a rope gall, Kern. If I was
  to tell the boys that, what d'you figure they'd think about their
  sheriff?"</p>

  <p>It was Kern's turn to change color. For a moment he hesitated, and then he
  dropped a hand lightly on Arizona's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Arizona," he muttered in the ear of the fat man, "what you
  been before you hit Woodville I dunno, and I don't care. I figure we come to
  a place where we'd both best keep our mouths shut. Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Shake," said Arizona, and they went out the door, almost arm in arm.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

  <p class="first">For Jude Cartwright the world was gone mad, as he spurred
  down the hills away from Sinclair and the girl. It was really only the second
  time in his life that he had been thwarted in an important matter. To be sure
  he had been raised roughly among rough men, but among the roughest of them,
  the repute of his family and the awe of his father's wide authority had
  served him as a shield in more ways than Jude himself could realize. He had
  grown very much accustomed to having his way.</p>

  <p>All things were made smooth for him; and when he reached the age when he
  began to think of marriage, and was tentatively courting half a dozen girls
  of the district, unhoped-for great fortune had fairly dropped into his
  path.</p>

  <p>The close acquaintance with old Mervin in that hunting trip had been
  entirely accidental, and he had been astounded by the marriage contract which
  Mervin shortly after proposed between the two families. Ordinarily even Jude
  Cartwright, with all his self-esteem, would never have aspired to a star so
  remote as Mervin's daughter. The miracle, however, happened. He saw himself
  in the way to be the richest man on the range, the possessor of the most
  lovely wife.</p>

  <p>That dream was first pricked by the inexplicable disappearance of the girl
  on their marriage day. He had laid that disappearance to foul play. That she
  could have left him through any personal aversion never entered his
  complacent young head.</p>

  <p>He went out on the quest after the neighboring district had been combed
  for his wife, and he had spent the intervening months in a ceaseless search,
  which grew more and more disheartening. It was only by chance that he
  remembered that Mervin had lived for some time in Sour Creek, and only with
  the faintest hope of finding a clue that he decided to visit that place. In
  his heart he was convinced that the girl was dead, but if she were really
  hiding it was quite possible that she might have remembered the town where
  her father had made his first success with cattle.</p>

  <p>Now the coincidence that had brought him face to face with her, stunned
  him. He was still only gradually recovering from it. It was totally
  incredible that she should have fled at all. And it was entirely beyond the
  range of credence that modest Elizabeth Mervin should have donned the clothes
  of a man and should be wandering through the hills with a male companion.</p>

  <p>But when his wonder died away, he felt little or no pity for his wife. The
  pang that he felt was the torture of offended pride. Indeed, the fact that he
  had lost his wife meant less to him than that his wife had seen him
  physically beaten by another man. He writhed in his saddle at the memory.</p>

  <p>Instantly his mind flashed back to the details of the scene. He rehearsed
  it with himself in a different role, beating the cowpuncher to a helpless
  pulp of bruised muscle, snatching away his wife. But even if he had been able
  to do that, what would the outcome be? He could not let the world know the
  truth &mdash;that his wife had fled from him in horror on their marriage day,
  that she had wondered about in the clothes of a man, that she was the
  companion of another man. And if he brought her back, certainly all these
  facts would come to light. The close-cropped hair alone would be damning
  evidence.</p>

  <p>He framed a wild tale of abduction by villains, of an injury, a sickness,
  a fever that forced a doctor to cut her hair short. He had no sooner framed
  the story than he threw it away as useless. With all his soul he began to
  wish for the only possible solution which would save the remnants of his
  ruined self- respect and keep him from the peril of discovery. The girl must
  indubitably die!</p>

  <p>By the time he came to this conclusion, he had struck out of the hills,
  and, as his horse hit the level going and picked up speed, the heart of Jude
  Cartwright became lighter. He would get weapons and the finest horse money
  could buy in Sour Creek, trail the pair, take them by surprise, and kill them
  both. Then back to the homeland and a new life!</p>

  <p>Already he saw himself in it, his name surrounded with a glamour of
  pathetic romance, as the sad widower with a mystery darkening his past and
  future. It was an agreeable gloom into which he fell. Self-pity warmed him
  and loosened his fierceness. He sighed with regret for his own
  misfortunes.</p>

  <p>In this frame of mind he reached Sour Creek and its hotel. While he wrote
  his name in the yellowed register he over-heard loud conversation in the
  farther end of the room. Two men had been outlawed that day&mdash;John
  Gaspar, the schoolteacher who killed Quade, and Riley Sinclair, a stranger
  from the North.</p>

  <p>Paying no further attention to the talk, he passed on into the general
  merchandise store which filled most of the lower story of the hotel. There he
  found the hardware department, and prominent among the hardware were the gun
  racks. He went over the Colts and with an expert hand took up the guns, while
  the gray-headed storekeeper advanced an eulogium upon each weapon. His
  attention was distracted by the entrance of a tall, painfully thin man who
  seemed in great haste.</p>

  <p>"What's all this about Cold Feet, Whitey?" he asked. "Cold Feet and
  Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno, Sandersen, except that word come in from Woodville that Sinclair
  stuck up the sheriff on his way in with Jig, and Sinclair got clean away.
  What could have been in his head to grab Jig?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said Sandersen, apparently much perturbed. "They outlawed 'em
  both, Whitey?"</p>

  <p>There was an eagerness in this question so poorly concealed that
  Cartwright jerked up his head and regarded Sandersen with interest.</p>

  <p>"Both," replied Whitey. "You seem sort of pleased, Sandersen?"</p>

  <p>"I knowed that Sinclair would come to a bad end," said Sandersen more
  soberly.</p>

  <p>"Why, I thought they said you cottoned to him when the boys was figuring
  he might have had something to do with Quade?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Well, yes, for a minute. But out at the necktie party, Whitey, I kept
  watching him. Thinks a lot more'n he says, and gents like that is always
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>"Always," replied Whitey.</p>

  <p>"But it's the last time Sinclair'll show his face in Sour Creek&mdash;
  alive," said Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"If he does show his face alive, it'll be a dead face pronto. You can lay
  to that."</p>

  <p>Sandersen seemed to turn this fact over and over in his mind, with immense
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"And yet," pursued the storekeeper, "think of a full-grown man breaking
  the law to save such a skinny little shrimp of a gent as Jig? Eh? More like a
  pretty girl than a boy, Jig is."</p>

  <p>Cartwright exclaimed, and both of the others turned toward him.</p>

  <p>"Here's the gun for me," he said huskily, "and that gun belt&mdash;
  filled&mdash;and this holster. They'll all do."</p>

  <p>"And a handy outfit," said Whitey. "That gun'll be a friend in need!"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think they'll be a need?" asked Cartwright, with such
  unnecessary violence that the others both stared. He went on more smoothly:
  "What was you saying about a girl-faced gent?"</p>

  <p>"The schoolteacher&mdash;he plugged a feller named Quade. Sinclair got him
  clean away from Sheriff Kern."</p>

  <p>"And what sort of a looking gent is Sinclair? Long, brown, and pretty
  husky-looking, with a mean eye?"</p>

  <p>"You've named him! Where'd you meet up with him?"</p>

  <p>"Over in the hills yonder, just where the north trail comes over the rise.
  They was sitting down under a tree resting their hosses when I come along. I
  got into an argument with this Sinclair&mdash;Long Riley, he called
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Riley's his first name."</p>

  <p>"We passed some words. Pretty soon I give him the lie! He made a reach for
  his gun. I told him I wasn't armed and dared him to try his fists. He takes
  off his belt, and we went at it. A strong man, but he don't know nothing
  about hand fighting. I had him about ready to give up and begging me to quit
  when this Jig, this girl-faced man you talk about&mdash;he pulls a gun and
  slugs me in the back of the head with it."</p>

  <p>Removing his sombrero he showed on the back of his head the great welt
  which had been made when he struck the ground with the weight of Sinclair on
  top of him. It was examined with intense interest by the other two.</p>

  <p>"Dirty work!" said Sandersen sympathetically.</p>

  <p>The storekeeper said nothing at all, but began to fold up a bolt of cloth
  which lay half unrolled on the counter.</p>

  <p>"It knocked me cold," continued Cartwright, "and when I come to, they
  wasn't no sign nor trace of 'em."</p>

  <p>Buckling on the belt, he shoved the revolver viciously home in the
  holster.</p>

  <p>"I'll land that pair before the posse gets to 'em, and when I land 'em I
  won't do no arguing with fists!"</p>

  <p>"Say, I call that nerve," put in the storekeeper, with patent admiration
  in his eyes, while he smoothed a fold of the cloth. "Running agin' one gent
  like Sinclair is bad enough&mdash;let alone tackling two at once. But you'd
  ought to take out a big insurance on your life, friend, before you take that
  trail. It's liable to be all out-trail and no coming back."</p>

  <p>A great deal of enthusiasm faded from Cartwright's face.</p>

  <p>"How come?" he asked briefly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. But they say this Sinclair is quite a gunfighter, my
  friend. Up in his home town they scare the babies by talking about
  Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"H'm," murmured Cartwright. "He can't win always, and maybe I'll be the
  lucky man."</p>

  <p>But he went out of the store with his head thoughtfully inclined.</p>

  <p>"Think of meeting up with them two all alone and not knowing what they
  was!" sighed Sandersen. "He's lucky to be alive, I'll tell a man."</p>

  <p>Whitey grinned.</p>

  <p>"Plenty of nerve in a gent like that," went on Sandersen, his pale blue
  eyes becoming dreamy. "Get your gat out, will you, Bill?"</p>

  <p>Bill Sandersen obliged.</p>

  <p>"Look at the butt. D'you see any point on it?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Did you look at that welt on the stranger's head?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Did you see a little cut in the middle of the welt?"</p>

  <p>"Come to think of it, I sure did."</p>

  <p>"Well, Sandersen, how d'you make out that a gun butt would make a cut like
  that?"</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at, Whitey?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just discounting the stranger," said Whitey. "I dunno what other
  talents he's got, but he's sure a fine nacheral liar."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

  <p class="first">It was some time before Riley Sinclair interrupted his
  pacing and, turning, strode over to the dim outlines of the sleeping girl.
  She did not speak, and, leaning close above her, he heard her regular
  breathing.</p>

  <p>Waiting until he was satisfied that she slept, he began to move rapidly.
  First, with long, soft steps he went to his saddle, which was perched on a
  ridge of rock. This he raised with infinite care, gathering up the stirrups
  and the cinches so that nothing might drag or strike. With this bundle
  secured, he once more went close to the figure of the sleeper and this time
  dropped on one knee beside her. He could see nothing distinctly by the
  starlight, but her forehead gleamed with one faint highlight, and there was
  the pale glimmer of one hand above the blankets.</p>

  <p>For the moment he almost abandoned the plan on which he had resolved,
  which was no less than to attempt to ride into Sour Creek and return to the
  girl before she wakened in the dawn. But suppose that he failed, and that she
  wakened to find herself alone in the mountain wilderness? He shuddered at the
  idea, yet he saw no other issue for her than to attempt the execution of his
  plan.</p>

  <p>He rose hastily and walked off, letting his weight fall on his toes
  altogether, so that the spurs might not jingle.</p>

  <p>Even that brief rest had so far refreshed his mustang that he was greeted
  with flattened ears and flying heels. These efforts Sinclair met with a smile
  and terrible whispered curses, whose familiar sound seemed to soothe the
  horse. He saddled at once, still using care to avoid noise, and swung steeply
  down the side of the mountain. On the descending trail, he could cut by one
  half the miles they had traversed winding up the slope.</p>

  <p>Recklessly he rode, giving the wise pony its head most of the time, and
  only seeing that it did not exceed a certain speed, for when a horse passes a
  certain rate of going it becomes as reckless as a drunken man. Once or twice
  they floundered onto sheer gravel slides which the broncho took by flinging
  back on its haunches and going down with stiffly braced forelegs. But on the
  whole the mustang took care of itself admirably.</p>

  <p>In an amazingly short time they struck the more placid footing of the
  valley, and Sinclair, looking up, could not believe that he had been so short
  a time ago at the top of the flat-crested mountain.</p>

  <p>He gave little time to wondering, however, but cut across the valley floor
  at a steady lope. From the top of the mountain the lights of Sour Creek were
  a close-gathered patch, from the level they appeared as a scattering line.
  Sinclair held straight toward them, keeping away to the left so as to come
  onto the well-beaten trail which he knew ran in that direction. He found it
  and let the mustang drop back to a steady dogtrot; for, if the journey to
  Sour Creek was now a short distance, there would be a hard ride back to the
  flat-topped mountain if he wished to accomplish his business and return
  before the full dawn. He must be there by that time, for who could tell what
  the girl might do when she found herself alone. Therefore he saved the cattle
  pony as much as possible.</p>

  <p>He was fairly close to Sour Creek, the lights fanning out broader and
  broader as he approached. Suddenly two figures loomed up before him in the
  night. He came near and made out a barelegged boy, riding without a saddle
  and driving a cow before him. He was a very angry herdsman, this boy. He kept
  up a continual monologue directed at the cow and his horse, and so he did not
  hear the approach of Riley Sinclair until the outlaw was close upon him. Then
  he hitched himself around, with his hand on the hip of his old horse, swaying
  violently with the jerk of the gait. He was glad of the company, it
  seemed.</p>

  <p>"Evening, mister. You ain't Hi Corson, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Nope, I ain't Hi. Kind of late driving that cow, ain't you?"</p>

  <p>The boy swore with shrill fluency.</p>

  <p>"We bought old Spot over at the Apwell place, and the darned old fool
  keeps breaking down fences and running back every time she gets a chance.
  Ain't nothing so foolish as a cow."</p>

  <p>"Why don't your dad sell her for beef?"</p>

  <p>"Beef?" The boy laughed. "Say, mister, I'd as soon try to chew leather.
  They ain't nothing but bones and skin and meanness to old Spot. But she's a
  good milker. When she comes in fresh she gives pretty nigh onto four gallons
  a milking."</p>

  <p>"Is that so!"</p>

  <p>"Sure is! Hard to milk, though. Kick the hat right off'n your head if you
  don't watch her. Never see such a fool cow as old Spot! Hey!"</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of this diversion in the attention of her guardian, Spot
  had ambled off to the side of the road. The boy darted his horse after her
  and sent her trotting down the trail, with clicking hoofs and long, sweeping
  steps that scuffed up a stifling dust.</p>

  <p>"Ain't very good to heat a milker up by running 'em, son," reproved
  Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"I know it ain't. But it wouldn't make me sorry if old Spot just
  nacherally dropped down dead&mdash;she gives me that much trouble. Look at
  her now, doggone her!"</p>

  <p>Spot had turned broadside to them and waited for the boy to catch up
  before she would take another forward step.</p>

  <p>"You just coming in to Sour Creek?"</p>

  <p>"Yep, I'm strange to this town."</p>

  <p>"Well, you sure couldn't have picked a more fussed-up time."</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you hear about the killing of Quade, I reckon?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>"You ain't? Where you been these days?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yonder in the hills."</p>

  <p>"Chipping rocks, eh? Well, Quade was a gent that lived out the norm trail,
  and he had a fuss with the schoolteacher over Sally Bent, and the
  schoolteacher up and murders Quade, and they raise a posse and go out to hang
  Gaspar, the teacher, and they're kept from it by a stranger called Sinclair;
  when the sheriff comes to get Gaspar and hang him legal and all, that
  Sinclair sticks up the sheriff and takes Gaspar away, and now they're both
  outlawed, I hear tell, and they's a price on their heads."</p>

  <p>The lad brought it out in one huge sentence, sputtering over the words in
  his haste.</p>

  <p>"How much of a price?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. It keeps growing. Everybody around Woodville and Sour Creek is
  chipping in to raise that price. They sure want to get Gaspar and Sinclair
  bad. Gaspar ain't much. He's a kind of sissy, but Sinclair is a
  killer&mdash;and then some."</p>

  <p>Sinclair raised his head to the black, solemn mountains. Then he looked
  back to his companion.</p>

  <p>"Why, has he killed anybody lately?"</p>

  <p>"He left one for dead right today!"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean it! He sure must be bad."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's bad, right enough. They was a gent named Cartwright come into
  town today with his head all banged up. He'd met up with Gaspar and Sinclair
  in the hills, not knowing nothing about them. Got into an argument with
  Sinclair, and, not being armed, he had it out with fists. He was beating up
  Sinclair pretty bad&mdash;him being a good deal of a man&mdash;when Gaspar
  sneaks up and whangs him on the back of the head with the butt of his Colt.
  They rode off and left him for dead. But pretty soon he wakes up. He comes on
  into Sour Creek, rarin' and tearin' and huntin' for revenge. Sure will be a
  bad mess if he meets up with Sinclair ag'in!"</p>

  <p>"Reckon it had ought to be," replied Sinclair. "Like to see this gent that
  waded into two outlaws with his bare fists."</p>

  <p>"He's a man, right enough. Got a room up in the hotel. Must have a pile of
  money, because he took the big room onto the north end of the hotel, the room
  that's as big as a house. Nothin' else suited him at all. Dad told me."</p>

  <p>"I ain't got nothing particular on hand," murmured Sinclair. "Maybe I can
  get in on this manhunt&mdash;if they ain't started already."</p>

  <p>The boy laughed. "Everybody in town has been trying to get in on that
  manhunt, but it ain't any use. Sheriff Kern has got a handpicked posse&mdash;
  every one a fightin' fool, Dad says. Wish you luck, though. They ain't
  starting till the morning. Well, here's where I branch off. S'long! Hey,
  Spot, you old fool, git along, will you?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair watched the youngster fade into the gloom behind the ambling cow,
  then he struck on toward Sour Creek; but, before he reached the main street,
  he wound off to the left and let his horse drift slowly beyond the outlying
  houses.</p>

  <p>His problem had become greatly complicated by the information from the
  boy. He had a double purpose, which was to see Cartwright in the first place,
  and then Sandersen, for these were the separate stumbling blocks for Jig and
  for himself. For Cartwright he saw a solution, through which he could avoid a
  killing, but Sandersen must die.</p>

  <p>He skirted behind the most northerly outlying shed of the hotel,
  dismounted there, and threw the reins. Then he slipped back into the shadow
  of the main building. Directly above him he saw three dark windows bunched
  together. This must be Cartwright's room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed patent to Bill Sandersen, earlier that afternoon,
  that fate had stacked the cards against Riley Sinclair. Bill Sandersen
  indeed, believed in fate. He felt that great hidden forces had always
  controlled his life, moving him hither and yon according to their
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>To the dreamy mind of the mystic, men are accidents, and all they perform
  are the dictates of the power and the brain of the other world.</p>

  <p>Sandersen could tell at what definite moments hunches had seized him. He
  had looked at the side of the mountain and suddenly felt, without any reason
  or volition on his part, that he was impelled to search that mountainside for
  gold- bearing ore. He had never fallen into the habit of using his reason. He
  was a wonderful gambler, playing with singular abandon, and usually winning.
  It mattered not what he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>If the urge came to him, and the surety that he was going to bet, he would
  wager everything in his wallet, all that he could borrow, on a pair of treys.
  And when such a fit was on him, the overwhelming confidence that shone in his
  face usually overpowered the other men sitting in at the game. More than once
  a full house had been laid down to his wretched pair. There were other
  occasions when he had lost the very boots he wore, but the times of winning
  naturally overbalanced the losses in the mind of Bill. It was not he who won,
  and it was not he who lost. It was fate which ruled him. And that fate, he
  felt at present, had sided against Riley Sinclair.</p>

  <p>A sort of pity for the big cowpuncher moved him. He knew that he and Quade
  and Lowrie deserved death in its most terrible form for their betrayal of Hal
  Sinclair in the desert; and nothing but fate, he was sure, could save him
  from the avenger. Fate, however, had definitely intervened. What save blind
  fate could have stepped into the mind of Sinclair and made him keep Cold Feet
  from the rope, when that hanging would have removed forever all suspicion
  that Sinclair himself had killed Quade?</p>

  <p>Another man would have attributed both of those actions to common decency
  in Sinclair, but Sandersen always hunted out more profound reasons. In order
  to let the fact of his own salvation from Sinclair's gun sink more definitely
  into his brain, he trotted his horse into the hills that afternoon. When he
  came back he heard that the posse was in town.</p>

  <p>To another it might have seemed odd that the posse was there instead of on
  the trail of the outlaws. But Sandersen never thought of so practical a
  question. To him it was as clear as day. The posse had been brought to Sour
  Creek by fate in order that he, Sandersen, might enlist in its ranks and help
  in the great work of running down Sinclair, for, after all, it was work
  primarily to his own interest. There was something ironically absurd about
  it. He, Sandersen, having committed the mortal crime of abandoning Hal
  Sinclair in the desert, was now given the support of legal society to destroy
  the just avenger of that original crime. It was hardly any wonder that
  Sandersen saw in all this the hand of fate.</p>

  <p>He went straight to the hotel and up to the room which the sheriff had
  engaged. Cartwright was coming out with a black face, as Sandersen entered.
  The former turned at the door and faced Kern and the four assistants of the
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what you'll do, you wise gents," he growled. "You'll miss
  him altogether. You hear?"</p>

  <p>And then he stamped down the hall.</p>

  <p>Sandersen carefully removed his hat as he went in. He was quite aware that
  Cartwright must have been just refused a place on the posse, and he did not
  wish to appear too confident. He paid his compliments to the bunch, except
  Arizona, to whom he was introduced. The sheriff forestalled his request.</p>

  <p>"You've come for a job in the posse, Bill?"</p>

  <p>Hastily Sandersen cut in before the other should pronounce a final
  judgment.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you for turning down Cartwright," he said. "A gent like
  that who don't know the country ain't much use on the trail, eh?"</p>

  <p>"The point is, Bill, that I got all the men I need. I don't want a whole
  gang."</p>

  <p>"But I got a special reason, sheriff. Besides a tolerable fast hoss that
  might come in handy for a chase, I sling a tolerable fast gun, sheriff. But
  beyond that all, I got a grudge."</p>

  <p>"A grudge?" asked the sheriff, pricking his ears.</p>

  <p>"So did Cartwright have a grudge," cut in Arizona dryly.</p>

  <p>Perhaps after all, Sandersen felt, fate might not be with him in this
  quest for Sinclair. He said earnestly: "You see, boys, it was me that raised
  the posse that run down Cold Feet in the first place. It was me that backed
  up Sinclair all the way through the trail, and I feel like some of the blame
  for what happened is coming to me. I want to square things up and get a
  chance at Sinclair. I want it mighty bad. You know me, Kern. Gimme a chance,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that sounds like reason," admitted the sheriff. "Eh, boys?"</p>

  <p>The posse nodded its general head, with the usual exception of Arizona,
  who seemed to take a particular pleasure in diverging from the judgments of
  the others.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, gents," he said. "Don't it strike you that they's
  something the same with Cartwright and Sandersen? Both of 'em in particular
  anxious to cut in on this party; both of 'em has grudges. Cartwright said he
  didn't want no share of the money if you caught Gaspar and Sinclair. Is that
  right for you, too, Sandersen?"</p>

  <p>"It sure is. I want the fun, not the coin," said Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"Boys," resumed Arizona, "it rounds up to this: Sinclair came down here to
  Sour Creek for a purpose."</p>

  <p>Sandersen began to listen intently. He even dreaded this fat man from the
  southland.</p>

  <p>"I dunno what this purpose was," went on Arizona, "but mostly when a gent
  like Sinclair makes a trip they's a man at the far end of it&mdash;because
  this ain't his range. Now, if it's a man, why shouldn't it be one of these
  two, Cartwright or Sandersen, who both pack a grudge against Sinclair?
  Sinclair is resting somewhere up yonder in them hills. I'm sure of that. He's
  waiting there to get a chance to finish his business in Sour Creek, and that
  business is Cartwright or Sandersen, I dunno which. Now, I'm agin' taking in
  Sandersen. When we're private I'll tell you my reason why."</p>

  <p>There was something of an insult in this speech and the tall man took
  instant offense.</p>

  <p>"Partner," he drawled, "it looks to me like them reasons could be spoke
  personal to me. Suppose you step outside and we talk shop?"</p>

  <p>Arizona smiled. It took a man of some courage and standing to refuse such
  an invitation without losing caste. But for some reason Arizona was the last
  man in the world whom one could accuse of being a coward.</p>

  <p>"Sandersen," he said coldly, "I don't mean to step on your toes. You may
  be as good a man as the next. The reasons that I got agin' you ain't personal
  whatever, which they're things I got a right to think, me being an officer of
  the law for the time being. If you hold a grudge agin' me for what I've said,
  you and me can talk it over after this here job's done. Is that square?"</p>

  <p>"I s'pose it's got to be," replied Sandersen. "Gents, does the word of
  your fat friend go here?"</p>

  <p>Left to themselves, the posse probably would have refused Arizona's advice
  on general principles, but Arizona did not leave them to themselves.</p>

  <p>"Sure, my word goes," he hastened to put in. "The sheriff and all of us
  work like a closed hand&mdash;all together!"</p>

  <p>There was a subtle flattery about this that pleased the sheriff and the
  others.</p>

  <p>"Reckoning it all in all," said sheriff, "I think we better figure you
  out, Sandersen. Besides they ain't anything to keep you and Cartwright and
  the rest from rigging up a little posse of your own. Sinclair is up yonder in
  the hill waiting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped. Sandersen was shaken as if by a violent ague, and his
  face lost all color, becoming a sickly white.</p>

  <p>"And we're going to find him by ourselves. S'long Sandersen, and thanks
  for dropping in. No hard feelings, mind!"</p>

  <p>To this friendly dismissal Sandersen returned no answer. He turned away
  with a wide, staring eye, and went through the doorway like a man walking in
  a dream. Arizona was instantly on his feet.</p>

  <p>"You see, boys?" he asked exultantly. "I was right. When you said Sinclair
  was waiting up there in the hills, Sandersen was scared. I was right. He's
  one of them that Sinclair is after, and that's why he wanted to throw in with
  us!"</p>

  <p>"And why the devil shouldn't he?" asked the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"For a good reason, sheriff, reason that'll save us a pile of riding.
  We'll sit tight here in Sour Creek for a while and catch Sinclair right here.
  D'you know how? By watching Cartwright and Sandersen. As sure as they's a sky
  over us, Sinclair is going to make a try at one of 'em. They both hate him.
  Well, you can lay to it that he hates 'em back. And a man that Sinclair hates
  he's going to get sooner or later&mdash;chiefly sooner. Sheriff, keep an eye
  on them two tonight, and you'll have Sinclair playing right into your
  hands!"</p>

  <p>"Looks to me," muttered Red Chalmers, "like you had a grudge agin'
  Cartwright and Sandersen, using them for live bait and us for a trap."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Arizona, sitting down and rubbing his fat hands, much
  pleased with himself. "Why not, I'd like to know?"</p>

  <p>In the meantime Bill Sandersen had gone down to the street, still with the
  staring eyes of a sleep walker. It was evening, and from the open street he
  looked out and up to the mountains, growing blue and purple against the sky.
  He had heard Hal Sinclair talk about Riley and Riley's love for the higher
  mountains. They were "his country." And a great surety dropped upon him that
  the fat man of the posse had been right. Somewhere in those mountains
  Sinclair was lurking, ready for a descent upon Sour Creek.</p>

  <p>Now Sandersen grew cold. All that was superstitious in his nature took him
  by the throat. The fate, which he had felt to be fighting with him, he now
  was equally sure was aligned against him. Otherwise, why had the posse
  refused to accept him as a member? For only one reason: He was doomed to die
  by the hand of Riley Sinclair, and then, no doubt, Riley Sinclair would fall
  in turn by the bullets of the posse.</p>

  <p>The shadows were pouring out of the gorges of the western mountains, and
  night began to invade the hollow of Sour Creek. Every downward step of those
  shadows was to the feverish imagination of Sandersen a forecast of the coming
  of Sinclair&mdash;Sinclair coming in spite of the posse, in spite of the
  price upon his head.</p>

  <p>In the few moments during which Sandersen remained in the street watching,
  the tumult grew in his mind. He was afraid. He was mortally in terror of
  something more than physical death, and, like the cornered rat, he felt a
  sudden urge to go out and meet the danger halfway. A dozen pictures came to
  him of Sinclair slipping into the town under cover of the night, of the
  stealthy approach, of the gunplay that would follow. Why not take the
  desperate chance of going out to find the assailant and take him by surprise
  instead?</p>

  <p>The mountains&mdash;that was the country of Sinclair. Instinctively his
  eye fell and clung on the greatest height he could see, a flat-topped
  mountain due west of Sour Creek. Sandersen swung into his saddle and drove
  out of Sour Creek toward the goal and into the deepening gloom of the
  evening.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>

  <p class="first">In the darkness beneath the north windows of the hotel,
  Sinclair consulted his watch, holding it close until he could make out the
  dim position of the hands against the white dial. It was too early for
  Cartwright to be in bed, unless he were a very long sleeper. So Sinclair
  waited.</p>

  <p>A continual danger lay beside him. The kitchen door constantly banged open
  and shut, as the Chinese cook trotted out and back, carrying scraps to the
  waste barrel, or bringing his new-washing tins to hang on a rack in the open
  air, a resource on which he was forced to fall back on account of his cramped
  quarters.</p>

  <p>But the cook never left the bright shaft of light which fell through the
  doorway behind and above him, and consequently he could not see into the
  thick darkness where Sinclair crouched only a few yards away; and the
  cowpuncher remained moveless. From time to time he looked up, and still the
  windows were black.</p>

  <p>After what seemed an eternity, there was a flicker, as when the wick of a
  lamp is lighted, and then a steady glow as the chimney was put on again. That
  glow brightened, decreased, became an unchanging light. The wick had been
  trimmed, and Cartwright was in for the evening.</p>

  <p>However, the cook had not ceased his pilgrimages. At the very moment when
  Sinclair had straightened to attempt the climb up the side of the house, the
  cook came out and crouched on the upper step, humming a jangling tune and
  sucking audibly a long-stemmed pipe. The queer-smelling smoke drifted across
  to Sinclair; for a moment he was on the verge of attempting a quick leap and
  a tying and gagging of the Oriental, but he desisted.</p>

  <p>Instead, Sinclair flattened himself against the wall and waited.
  Providence came to his assistance at that crisis. Someone called from the
  interior of the house. There was an odd-sounding exclamation from the cook,
  and then the latter jumped up and scurried inside, slamming the screen door
  behind him with a great racket.</p>

  <p>Sinclair raised his head and surveyed the side of the wall for the last
  time. The sill of the window of the first floor was no higher than his
  shoulders. The eaves above that window projected well out, and they would
  afford an excellent hold by which he could swing himself up. But having swung
  up, the great problem was to obtain sufficient purchase for his knee to keep
  from sliding off before he had a chance to steady himself. Once on the ledge
  of those eaves, he could stand up and look through any one of the three
  windows into the room which, according to the boy, Cartwright occupied.</p>

  <p>He lifted himself onto the sill of the first window, bumping his nose
  sharply against the pane of the glass.</p>

  <p>Then began the more difficult task. He straightened and fixed his fingers
  firmly on the ledge above him, waiting until his palm and the fingertips had
  sweated into a steady grip. Then he stepped as far as possible to one side
  and sprang up with a great heave of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>But the effort was too great. He not only flung himself far enough up, but
  too far, and his descending knee, striving for a hold, slipped off as if from
  an oiled surface. He came down with a jar, the full length of his arms, a
  fall that flung him down on his back on the ground.</p>

  <p>With a stifled curse he leaped up again. It seemed that the noise of that
  fall must have resounded for a great distance, but, as he stood there
  listening, no one drew near. Someone came out of the front door of the hotel,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>The cowpuncher tried again. He managed the first stage of the ascent, as
  before, very easily, but, making the second effort he exceeded too much in
  caution and fell short. However, the fall did not include a toppling all the
  way to the ground. His feet landed softly on the sill, and, at the same time,
  voices turned the corner of the building beside him. Sinclair flattened
  himself against the pane of the lower window and held his breath. Two men
  were beneath him. Their heads were level with his feet. He could have kicked
  the hats off their heads, without the slightest trouble.</p>

  <p>It was a mystery that they did not see him, he thought, until he recalled
  that all men, at night, naturally face outward from a wall. It is an
  instinct. They stood close together, talking rather low. The one was fairly
  tall, and the other squat. The shorter man lighted a cigarette. The match
  light glinted on an oily, olive skin, and so much of the profile as he could
  see was faintly familiar. He sent his memory lurching back into far places
  and old times, but he had no nerve for reminiscence. He recalled himself to
  the danger of the moment and listened to them talking.</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" the taller man was saying.</p>

  <p>"So far, nothing," grunted the other.</p>

  <p>"And how long do you feel we'd ought to keep it up?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I'll tell you when I get tired."</p>

  <p>"Speaking personal, Fatty, I'm kind of tired of it right now. I want to
  hit the hay."</p>

  <p>"Buck up, buck up, partner. We'll get him yet!"</p>

  <p>Now it flashed into the mind of Sinclair that it must be a pair of crooked
  gamblers working on some fat purse in the hotel, come out here to arrange
  plans because they failed to extract the bank roll as quickly as they
  desired. Otherwise, there could be no meaning to this talk of "getting"
  someone.</p>

  <p>"But between you and me," grumbled the big man, "it looked from the first
  like a bum game, Fatty."</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble with you, Red. You ain't got any patience. How does a
  cat catch a mouse? By sitting down and waiting&mdash;maybe three hours. And
  the hungrier she gets, the longer she'll wait and the stiller she'll sit. A
  man could take a good lesson out'n that."</p>

  <p>"You always got a pile of fancy words," protested the big man.</p>

  <p>Sinclair saw Fatty put his hand on the shoulder of his companion. Plainly
  he was the dominant force of the two, in spite of his lack of height.</p>

  <p>"Red, as sure as you're born, they's something going to happen this here
  night. My scars is itching, Red, and that means something."</p>

  <p>Again the mind of Sinclair flashed back to something familiar. A man who
  prophesied by the itching of his scars. But once more the danger of the
  moment made his mind a blank to all else.</p>

  <p>"What scars?" asked Red.</p>

  <p>"Scratches I got when I was a kid," flashed the fat man. "That's all."
  "Oh," chuckled Red, plainly unconvinced. "Well, we'll play the game a little
  longer."</p>

  <p>"That's the talk, partner. I tell you we got this trap baited, and it's
  <i>got</i> to catch!"</p>

  <p>Presently they drifted around the corner of the building and out of sight.
  For a moment Sinclair wondered what that trap could be which the fat man had
  baited so carefully. His mind reverted to his original picture of a card
  game. Cheap tricksters, sharpers with the cards, he decided, and with that
  decision he banished them both from his mind.</p>

  <p>There was no other sign of life around him. All of Sour Creek lived in the
  main street, or went to bed at this hour of the early night. The back of the
  hotel was safe from observance, except for the horse shed, and the back of
  the shed was turned to him. He felt safe, and now he turned, settled his
  fingers into a new grip on the eaves, and made his third attempt. It
  succeeded to a nicety, his right knee catching solidly on the ledge.</p>

  <p>He got a fingertip hold on the boards and stood up. Straightening himself
  slowly, he looked into the room through a corner of the window pane.</p>

  <p>Cartwright sat with his back to the window, a lamp beside him on the
  table, writing. He had thrown off his heavy outer shirt, and he wore only a
  cotton undershirt. His heavy shoulders and big-muscled arms showed to great
  advantage, with the light and sharp shadows defining each ridge. Now and then
  he lifted his head to think. Then he bent to his writing again.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Sinclair to fling the window up boldly, and when Cartwright
  turned, cover him with a gun. But the chances, including his position on the
  ledge, were very much against him. Cartwright would probably snatch at his
  own gun which lay before him in its holster on the table, and whirling he
  would try a snap shot.</p>

  <p>The only other alternative was to raise the window&mdash;and that with
  Cartwright four paces away!</p>

  <p>First Sinclair took stock of the interior of the room. It was larger than
  most parlors he had seen. There was a big double bed on each side of it.
  Plainly it was intended to accommodate a whole party, and Sinclair smiled at
  the vanity of the man who had insisted on taking "the best you have." No
  wonder Sour Creek knew the room he had rented.</p>

  <p>In the corner was a great fireplace capable of taking a six-foot log, at
  least. He admired the massive andirons, palpably of home manufacture in Sour
  Creek's blacksmith shop. It proved the age of the building. No one would
  waste money on such a fireplace in these days. A little stove would do twice
  the work of that great, hungry chimney. There were two great chests of
  drawers, also, each looking as if it were built up from the floor and made
  immovable, such was its weight. The beds, also, were of an ancient and solid
  school of furniture making.</p>

  <p>To be sure, everything was sadly run down. On the floor the thin old
  carpet was worn completely through at the sides of the beds. Both mirrors
  above the chest of drawers were sadly cracked, and the table at which
  Cartwright sat, leaned to the right under the weight of the arm he rested on
  it.</p>

  <p>Having thus taken in the details of the battle ground, Sinclair made ready
  for the attack. He made sure of his footing on the ledge, gave a last glance
  over his shoulder to see that no one was in sight, and then began to work at
  the window, moving it fractions of an inch at a time.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23"></a>CHAPTER 23</h2>

  <p class="first">When the window was half raised&mdash;the work of a full ten
  minutes &mdash;Sinclair drew his revolver and rested the barrel on the sill.
  He continued to lift the sash, but now he used his left hand alone, and
  thereby the noises became louder and more frequent. Cartwright occasionally
  raised his head, but probably he was becoming accustomed to the sounds.</p>

  <p>Now the window was raised to its full height, and Sinclair prepared for
  the command which would jerk Cartwright's hands above his head and make him
  turn slowly to look into the mouth of the gun. Weight which he could have
  handled easily with a lurch, became tenfold heavier with the slowness of the
  lift; eventually both shoulders were in the room, and he was kneeling on the
  sill.</p>

  <p>Cartwright raised his hands slowly, luxuriously, and stretched. It was a
  movement so opportune that Sinclair almost laughed aloud. He twisted his legs
  over the sill and dropped lightly on the floor.</p>

  <p>"No noise!" he called softly.</p>

  <p>The arms of Cartwright became frozen in their position above his head. He
  turned slowly, with little jerky movements, as though he had to fight to make
  himself look. And then he saw Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Keep 'em up!" commanded the cowpuncher, "and get out of that chair, real
  soft and slow. That's it!"</p>

  <p>Without a word Cartwright obeyed. There was no need of speech, indeed, for
  a score of expressions flashed into his face.</p>

  <p>"Go over and lock the door."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, keeping his arms above his head, all the way across the room,
  while Sinclair jerked the new Colt out of its holster and tossed it on the
  farthest bed. In the meantime Cartwright lingered at the door for a moment
  with his hand on the key. No doubt he fought, for the split part of a second,
  with a wild temptation to jerk that door open and leap into the safety of the
  hall. Sinclair read that thought in the tremor of the big man's body. But
  presently discretion prevailed. Cartwright turned the key and faced about. He
  was a deadly gray, and his lips were working.</p>

  <p>"Now," he began.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I start talking," urged Sinclair. "Come over here and sit down.
  You're too close to the door to suit me, just now. This is a pile
  better."</p>

  <p>Cartwright obeyed quietly. Sitting down, he locked his hands nervously
  about one knee and looked up with his eyes to Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"I come in for a quiet talk," said Sinclair, dropping his gun into the
  holster.</p>

  <p>That movement drew a sudden brightening of the eyes of Cartwright, who now
  straightened in his chair, as if he had regained hope.</p>

  <p>"Don't make no mistake," said Sinclair, following the meaning of that
  change accurately. "I'm pretty handy with this old gun, partner. And on you,
  just now, they ain't any reason why I should take my time or any chances,
  when it comes to shooting."</p>

  <p>Unconsciously Cartwright moistened his white lips, and his eyes grew big
  again.</p>

  <p>"Except that the minute you shoot, you're a dead one, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Me? Oh, no. When a gun's heard they'll run to the room where the shot's
  been fired. And when they get the lock open, I'll be gone the way I come
  from." Sinclair smiled genially on his enemy. "Don't start raising any crop
  of delusions, friend. I mean business&mdash;a lot."</p>

  <p>"Then talk business. I'll listen."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thanks! I come here about your wife."</p>

  <p>He watched Cartwright wince. In his heart he pitied the man. All the story
  of Cartwright's spoiled boyhood and viciously selfish youth were written in
  his face for the reading of such a man as Sinclair. The rancher's son had
  begun well enough. Lack of discipline had undone him; but whether his faults
  were fixed or changeable, Sinclair could not tell. It was largely to learn
  this that he took the chances for the interview.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Cartwright.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, d'you know why she left you?"</p>

  <p>An anguish came across Cartwright's face. It taught Sinclair at least one
  thing&mdash;that the man loved her.</p>

  <p>"You're the reason&mdash;maybe."</p>

  <p>"Me? I never seen her till two days ago. That's a tolerable ugly thing to
  say, Cartwright!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I got tolerable ugly reasons for saying it," answered the
  other.</p>

  <p>The cowpuncher sighed. "I follow the way you drift. But you're wrong,
  partner. Fact is, I didn't know Cold Feet was a girl till this evening."</p>

  <p>Cartwright sneered, and Sinclair stiffened in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Son," he said gravely, "the worst enemies I got will all tell you that
  Riley Sinclair don't handle his own word careless. And I give you my solemn
  word of honor that I didn't know she was a girl till this evening, and that,
  right away after I found it out, I come down here to straighten things out
  with you if I could. Will you believe it?"</p>

  <p>It was a strange study to watch the working in the face of Cartwright
  &mdash;of hope, passion, doubt, hatred. He leaned closer to Sinclair, his big
  hands clutched together.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair, I wish I could believe it!"</p>

  <p>"Look me in the eye, man! I can stand it."</p>

  <p>"By the Lord, it's true! But, Sinclair, have you come down to find out if
  I'd take her back?"</p>

  <p>"Would you?"</p>

  <p>The other grew instantly crafty. "She's done me a pile of wrong,
  Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"She has," said the cowpuncher. He went on gently: "She must of cut into
  your pride a lot."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if it was known," said Cartwright, turning pale at the thought,
  "she'd make me a laughing stock! Me, old Cartwright's son!"</p>

  <p>"Yep, that'd be bad." He wondered at the frank egoism of the youth.</p>

  <p>"I leave it to you," said Cartwright, settling back in his chair.
  "Something had ought to be done to punish her. Besides, she's a weight on
  your hands, and I can see you'd be anxious to get rid of her quick."</p>

  <p>"How d'you aim to punish her?" asked Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Kind of a hard thing to do, wouldn't it be?"</p>

  <p>Cartwright's eyes grew small. "Ways could be found." He swallowed hard.
  "I'd find a heap of ways to make her wish she'd died sooner'n shame me!"</p>

  <p>"I s'pose you could," said Sinclair slowly. He lowered his glance for a
  moment to keep his scorn from standing up in his eyes. "But I've heard of
  men, Cartwright, that'd love a woman so hard that they'd forgive
  anything."</p>

  <p>"The world's full of fools," said the rich rancher. He stabbed a stern
  forefinger into the palm of his other hand. "She's got to do a lot of
  explaining before I'll look at her. She's got to make me an accounting of
  every day she's spent since I last seen her at&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At the wedding?" asked Sinclair cruelly.</p>

  <p>Cartwright writhed in the chair till it groaned beneath his uneasy weight.
  "She told you that?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," went on Sinclair, assuming a new tone of frank inquiry.
  "Let's see if we can't find out why she left you?"</p>

  <p>"They ain't any reason&mdash;just plain fool woman, that's all."</p>

  <p>"But maybe she didn't love you, Cartwright. Did you ever think of
  that?"</p>

  <p>The big man stared. "Not love me? Who <i>would</i> she love, then? Was
  they anybody in them parts that could bring her as much as I could? Was they
  anybody that had as good a house as mine, or as much land, or as much cattle?
  Didn't I take her over the ground and show her what it amounted to? Didn't I
  offer her her pick of my own string of riding horses?"</p>

  <p>"Did you do as much as that?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I did. She wouldn't have lacked for nothing."</p>

  <p>"You sure must have loved her a lot," insinuated Sinclair. "Must have been
  plumb foolish about her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dunno about that. Love is one thing that ain't bothered me none. I
  got important interests, Sinclair. I'm a business man. And this here marriage
  was a business proposition. Her dad was a business man, and he fixed it all
  up for us. It was to tie the two biggest bunches of land together that could
  be found in them parts. Anyway"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"I got the land!"</p>

  <p>"And why not let the girl go, then?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Cartwright eagerly. "Who wants her? You?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe, if you'd let her go."</p>

  <p>"Not in a thousand years! She's mine. They ain't no face but hers that I
  can see opposite to me at the table&mdash;not one! Besides, she's mine, and
  I'm going to keep her&mdash;after I've taught her a lesson or two!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair wiped his forehead hastily. Eagerness to jump at the throat of
  the man consumed him. He forced a smile on his thin lips and persistently
  looked down.</p>

  <p>"But think how easy it'd be, Cartwright. Think how easy you could get a
  divorce on the grounds of desertion."</p>

  <p>"And drag all this shame into the courts?"</p>

  <p>"They's ways of hushing these here things up. It'd be easy. She wouldn't
  put up no defense, mostlike. You'd win your case. And if anybody asked
  questions, they'd simply say she was crazy, and that you was lucky to get rid
  of her. They wouldn't blame you none. And it wouldn't be no disgrace to be
  deserted by a crazy woman, would it?"</p>

  <p>Cartwright drew back into a shell of opposition. "You talk pretty hot for
  this."</p>

  <p>"Because I'm telling you the way out for both of you."</p>

  <p>"I can't see it. She's coming back to me. Nobody else is going to get her.
  I've set my mind on it!"</p>

  <p>"Partner, don't you see that neither of you could ever be happy?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'd be happy enough. I'd forgive her&mdash;after a while."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what about her?"</p>

  <p>"About her? Why, curse her, what right has she got to be considered?"</p>

  <p>"Cartwright, she doesn't love you."</p>

  <p>The bulldog came into the face of Cartwright and contorted it. "Don't she
  belong to me by law? Ain't she sworn to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't" said Sinclair, as if the words strangled him. "Don't say that,
  Cartwright, if you please!"</p>

  <p>"Why not? You put up a good slick talk, Sinclair. But you don't win. I
  ain't going to give her up by no divorce. I'm going to keep her. I don't love
  her enough to want her back, I hate her enough. They's only one way that I'd
  stop caring about&mdash;stop fearing that she'd shame me. And that's by
  having her six feet underground. But you, Sinclair, you need coin. You're
  footloose. Suppose you was to take her and bring her to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" cried Sinclair again. "Don't say it, Cartwright. Think it over
  again. Have mercy on her, man. She could make some home happy. Are you going
  to destroy that chance?"</p>

  <p>"Say, what kind of talk is this?" asked the big man.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Sinclair, "look to your own rotten soul!"</p>

  <p>The strength of Cartwright was cut away at the root. The color was struck
  out of his face as by a mortal blow. "What d'you mean?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"You don't deserve a man's chance, but I'm going to give it to you. Go get
  your gun, Cartwright!"</p>

  <p>Cartwright slunk back in his chair. "Do you mean murder, Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"I mean a fair fight."</p>

  <p>"You're a gunman. You been raised and trained for gunfighting. I wouldn't
  have no chance!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair controlled his scorn. "Then I'll fight left-handed. I'm a right-
  handed man, Cartwright, and I'll take you with my gun in my left hand. That
  evens us up, I guess."</p>

  <p>"No, it don't!"</p>

  <p>But with the cry on his lips, the glance of Cartwright flickered past
  Sinclair. He grew thoughtful, less flabby. He seemed to be calculating his
  chances as his glance rested on the window.</p>

  <p>"All right," he whispered, a fearful eye on Sinclair, as if he feared the
  latter would change his mind. "Gimme a fair break."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it."</p>

  <p>Sinclair shifted his gun to his left hand and turned to look at the window
  which Cartwright had been watching with such intense interest. He had not
  half turned, however, when a gun barked at his very ear, it seemed, a tongue
  of flame spat in from the window, there was a crash of glass, and the lamp
  was snuffed. Some accurate shot had cut the burning wick out of the lamp with
  his bullet, so nicely placed that, though the lamp reeled, it did not
  fall.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>CHAPTER 24</h2>

  <p class="first">With the spurt of flame, Sinclair leaped back until his
  shoulders grazed the wall. He crouched beside the massive chest of drawers.
  It might partially shelter him from fire from the window.</p>

  <p>There fell one of those deadly breathing spaces of silence&mdash; silence,
  except for the chattering of the lamp, as it steadied on the table and
  finally was still. There was a light crunching noise from the opposite side
  of the room. Cartwright had moved and put his foot on a fragment of the
  shattered chimney.</p>

  <p>Sinclair studied the window. It was a rectangle of dim light, but nothing
  showed in that frame. He who had fired the shot must have crouched at once,
  or else have drawn to one side. He waited with his gun poised. Steps were
  sounding far away in the building, steps which approached rapidly. Voices
  were calling. Somewhere on the farther side of the room Cartwright must have
  found the best shelter he could, and Sinclair shrewdly guessed that it would
  be on the far side of the chest of drawers which faced him.</p>

  <p>In the meantime he studied the blank rectangle of the window. Sooner or
  later the man who stood on the ledge would risk a look into the dark
  interior; otherwise, he would not be human. And, sure enough, presently the
  faintest shadow of an outline encroached on the solid rectangle of faint
  light. Sinclair aimed just to the right and fired. At once there was a splash
  of red flame and a thundering report from the other side of the room.
  Cartwright had fired at the flash of Sinclair's gun, and the bullet smashed
  into the chest beside Sinclair. As for Sinclair's own bullet, it brought only
  a stifled curse from the window.</p>

  <p>"No good, Riley," sang out the voice. "This wall's too thick for a
  Colt."</p>

  <p>Sinclair had flung himself softly forward on his stomach, his gun in
  readiness and leveled in the direction of Cartwright. There was the prime
  necessity. Now heavy footfalls rushed down the hall, and a storm of voices
  broke in upon him.</p>

  <p>At the same time Cartwright's gun spat fire again. The bullet buzzed
  angrily above Sinclair's head. His own brought a yell of pain, sharp as the
  yelp of a coyote.</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet, Cartwright," ordered the man at the window. "You'll get
  yourself killed if you keep risking it. Sheriff!"</p>

  <p>His voice rose and rang.</p>

  <p>"Blow the lock off'n that door. We got him!"</p>

  <p>There was an instant reply in the explosion of a gun, the crash of broken
  metal, the door swung slowly in, admitting a dim twilight into the room. The
  light showed Sinclair one thing&mdash;the dull outlines of Cartwright. He
  whipped up his gun and then hesitated. It would be murder. He had killed
  before, but never save in fair fight, standing in a clear light before his
  enemy. He knew that he could not kill this rat he detested. He thought of the
  wrecked life of the girl and set his teeth. Still he could not fire.</p>

  <p>"Cartwright," he said softly, "I got you covered. Your right hand's on the
  floor with your gun. Don't raise that hand!"</p>

  <p>In the shadow against the wall Cartwright moved, but he obeyed. The
  revolver still glimmered on the floor.</p>

  <p>A new and desperate thought came to Sinclair&mdash;to rush straight for
  the window, shoot down the man on the ledge, and risk the leap to the ground.
  "Scatter back!" called the man on the ledge.</p>

  <p>That settled the last chance of Sinclair. There were guards on the ground,
  scattered about the house. He could never get out that way.</p>

  <p>"Keep out of the light by the door," commanded the man at the window. "And
  start shooting for the chest of drawers on the left-hand side of the room
  &mdash;and aim low down. It may take time, but we'll get him!"</p>

  <p>Obviously the truth of that statement was too clear for Sinclair to deny
  it. He reviewed his situation with the swift calm of an old gambler. He had
  tried his desperate coup and had failed. There was nothing to do but accept
  the failure, or else make a still more desperate effort to rectify his
  position, risking everything on a final play.</p>

  <p>He must get out of the room. The window was hopelessly blocked. There
  remained the open door, but the hall beyond the door was crowded with
  men.</p>

  <p>Perhaps their very numbers would work against them. Even now they could be
  heard cautiously maneuvering. They would shoot through the door in his
  general direction, unaimed shots, with the hope of a chance hit, and
  eventually they would strike him down. Suppose he were to steal close to the
  door, leap over the bed, and plunge out among them, his Colt spitting lead
  and fire.</p>

  <p>That unexpected attack would cleave a passage for him. The more he thought
  of it, the more clearly he saw that the chances of escape to the street were
  at least one in three. And yet he hesitated. If he made that break two or
  three innocent men would go down before his bullets, as he sprang out,
  shooting to kill. He shrank from the thought. He was amazed at himself. Never
  before had he been so tender of expedients. He had always fought to
  win&mdash;cleanly, but to win. Why was he suddenly remembering that to these
  men he was an outlaw, fit meat for the first bullet they could send home? Had
  he been one of them, he would have taken up a position in that very hall just
  as they were doing.</p>

  <p>Slowly, reluctantly, fighting himself as he did it, he shoved his revolver
  back into his holster and determined to take the chance of that surprise
  attack, with his empty hands against their guns. If they did not drop him the
  instant he leaped out, he would be among them, too close for gunplay unless
  they took the chance of killing their own men.</p>

  <p>Keeping his gaze fixed on Cartwright across the room&mdash;for the moment
  he showed his intention, Cartwright would shoot&mdash;he maneuvered softly
  toward the bed. Cartwright turned his head, but made no move to lift his gun.
  There was a reason. The light from the door fell nearer to the rancher than
  it did to Sinclair. To Cartwright he must be no more than a shapeless
  blur.</p>

  <p>A gun exploded from the doorway, with only a glint of steel, as the muzzle
  was shoved around the jamb. The bullet crashed harmlessly into the wall
  behind him. Another try. The sharp, stifling odor of burned powder began to
  fill the room, stinging the nostrils of Sinclair. Cartwright was coughing in
  a stifled fashion on the far side of the room, as if he feared a loud noise
  would draw a bullet his way.</p>

  <p>All at once there was no sound in the hotel, and, as the wave of silence
  spread, Sinclair was aware that the whole little town was listening, waiting,
  watching. Not a whisper in the hall, not a stir from Cartwright across the
  room. The quiet made the drama seem unreal.</p>

  <p>Then that voice outside the window, which seemed to be Sinclair's Nemesis,
  cried: "Steady, boys. Something's going to happen. He's getting ready. Buck
  up, boys!"</p>

  <p>In a moment of madness Sinclair decided to rush that window and dispose of
  the cool-minded speaker at all costs before he died. There, at least, was the
  one man he wished to kill. He followed that impulse long enough to throw
  himself sidling along the floor, so as not to betray his real strategic
  position to those at the door, and he splashed two bullets into the wall,
  trimming the side of the window.</p>

  <p>Only clear, deep-throated laughter came in response.</p>

  <p>"I told you, boys. I read his mind, and he's mad at me, eh?"</p>

  <p>But Riley Sinclair hardly heard the mocking answer. He had glided back
  behind the bed, the instant the shots were fired. As he moved, two guns
  appeared for a flickering instant around the edge of the doorway, one on each
  side. Their muzzles kicked up rapidly, one, two, three, four, five, six, and
  each, as he fired, spread the shots carefully from side to side. Sinclair
  heard the bullets bite and splinter the woodwork close to the floor. The
  chest of drawers staggered with the impact.</p>

  <p>He raised his own gun, watched one of the jumping muzzles for an instant,
  and then tried a snap shot. The report of his revolver was bitten off short
  by the clang of metal; there was a shouted curse from the hallway. He had
  blown the gun cleanly out of the sharpshooter's hand.</p>

  <p>Before the amazed rumble from the hall died away, Sinclair had acted. He
  shoved his weapon back in its holster, and cleared the bed with a flying
  leap. From the corner of his eye, he saw Cartwright snatch up his gun and
  take a chance shot that whistled close to his head, and then Sinclair plunged
  into the hall.</p>

  <p>One glimmering chance of success remained. On the side of the door toward
  which he drove there were only three men in the hall; behind him were more,
  far more, but their weapons were neutralized. They could not fire without
  risking a miss that would be certain to lodge a bullet in the body of one of
  the men before Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Those men were kneeling, for they had been reaching out and firing low
  around the door to rake the floor of the room. At the appearance of Sinclair
  they started up. He saw a gun jerk high for a snap shot, and, swerving as he
  leaped, he drove out with all his weight behind his fist. The knuckles bit
  through flesh to the bone. There was a jarring impact, and now only two men
  were before him. One of them dropped his gun&mdash;it was he who had just
  emptied his weapon into the room&mdash;and flung himself at Sinclair, with
  outspread arms. The cowpuncher snapped up his knee, and the blow crumpled the
  other back and to the side. He sprang on toward the last man who barred his
  way. And all this in the split part of a second.</p>

  <p>Chance took a hand against him. In the very act of striking, his foot
  lodged on the first senseless body, and he catapulted forward on his hands.
  He struck the legs of the third man as he fell.</p>

  <p>Down they went together, and Sinclair lurched up from under the weight
  only to be overtaken by many reaching hands from behind. That instant of
  delay had lost the battle for him; and, as he strove to whirl and fight
  himself clear, an arm curled around his neck, shutting off his breath. A
  great weight jarred between his shoulders. And he pitched down to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>He stopped fighting. He felt his gun slipped from the holster. Deft,
  strong hands jerked his arms behind him and tied the wrists firmly together.
  Then he was drawn to his feet.</p>

  <p>All this without a word spoken, only the pant and struggle of hard-drawn
  breaths. Not until he stood on his feet again, with a bleeding-faced fellow
  rising with dazed eyes, and another clambering up unsteadily, with both hands
  pressed against his head, did the captors give voice. And their voice was a
  yell of triumph that was taken up in two directions outside the hotel.</p>

  <p>They became suddenly excited, riotously happy. In the overflowing of their
  joy they were good-natured. Some one caught up Sinclair's hat and jammed it
  on his head. Another slapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"A fine, game fight!" said the latter. It was the man with the smeared
  face. He was grinning through his wounds. "Hardest punch I ever got. But I
  don't blame you, partner!"</p>

  <p>Presently he saw Sheriff Kern. The latter was perfectly cool, perfectly
  grave. It was his arm that had coiled around the neck of Sinclair and
  throttled him into submission.</p>

  <p>"You didn't come out to kill, Sinclair. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't used to slaughterhouse work," said Sinclair with equal calm,
  although he was panting. "Besides, it wasn't worth it. Murder never is."</p>

  <p>"Kind of late to come to that idea, son. Now just trot along with me, will
  you?" He paused. "Where's Arizona?"</p>

  <p>Cartwright lurched out of the room with his naked gun in his hand. Red
  dripped from the shallow wound where Sinclair's bullet had nicked him. He
  plunged at the captive, yelling.</p>

  <p>"Stop that fool!" snapped the sheriff.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen men put themselves between the outlaw and the avenger.
  Cartwright straggled vainly.</p>

  <p>"Between you and me," said Sinclair coldly to the sheriff, "I think that
  skunk would plug me while I got my hands tied."</p>

  <p>The sheriff flashed a knowing glance up at his tall prisoner's face.</p>

  <p>"I dunno, Sinclair. Kind of looks that way."</p>

  <p>Although Cartwright had been persuaded to restore his gun to its cover, he
  passed through the crowd until he confronted Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Now, the tables is turned, eh? I'll take the high hand from now on,
  Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>"It's no good," said Sinclair dryly. "The gent that shot out the light had
  a chance to see something before he done the shooting. And what he seen must
  have showed that you're yaller, Cartwright&mdash;yaller as a yaller dog!"</p>

  <p>Cartwright flung his fist with a curse into the face of the cowpuncher.
  The weight of the blow jarred him back against the wall, but he met the glare
  of Cartwright with a steady eye, a thin trickle of crimson running down his
  cut lips. The sheriff rushed in between and mastered Cartwright's arms.</p>

  <p>"One more little trick like that, stranger, and I'll turn you over to the
  boys. They got ways of teaching gents manners. How was you raised,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly sobered, Cartwright drew back from dark glances on every
  side.</p>

  <p>"Fellows," he said, in a shaken voice, "I forgot his hands was tied. But
  I'm kind of wrought up. He tried to murder me!"</p>

  <p>"It's all right, partner," drawled Red Chalmers, and he laid a strong hand
  on the shoulder of Cartwright. "It's all right. We all allow for one break.
  But don't do something like that twice&mdash;not in these parts!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair walked beside the sheriff, while the crowd poured past him and
  down the hall. When they reached the head of the stairs they found the
  lighted room below filled with excited, upturned faces; at the sight of the
  sheriff and his prisoner they roared their applause. The faces were blotted
  and blurred by a veil of rapidly, widely waving sombreros.</p>

  <p>The sheriff paused halfway down the stairs and held up his hand. Sinclair
  halted beside him looking disdainfully over the crowd. Instantly noise and
  movement ceased. It was a spectacular picture, the stubby little sheriff and
  the tall, lean, wolflike man he had captured. It seemed a vivid illustration
  of the power of the law over the lawbreaker. Sinclair glanced down in wonder
  at Kern. It was in character for the sheriff to make a speech. A moment later
  the sheriff's own words had explained his reason for the impromptu
  address.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, "I figure some of you has got an almighty big wish to see
  Sinclair on the end of a rope, eh?"</p>

  <p>A deep growl answered him.</p>

  <p>"Speaking personal," went on the sheriff smoothly, "I don't see how he's
  done a thing worth hanging. He took a prisoner away from me, and he's
  resisted arrest. That's all. Sinclair has got a name as a killer. Maybe he
  is. But I know he ain't done no killing around these parts that's come to
  light yet. I'll tell you another thing. A minute ago he could have sent three
  men to death and maybe come off with a free skin. But he chose to take his
  chance without shooting to kill. He tried to fight his way out with his hands
  sooner'n blow the heads off of gents that never done him no harm except to
  get in his way. Well, boys, that's something you don't often see. And I tell
  you this right now: If they's any lynch talk around this here town, you can
  lay to it that you'll have to shoot your way to Sinclair through me. And I'll
  be a dead one before you reach to him."</p>

  <p>He paused. Someone hissed from the back of the crowd, but the majority
  murmured in appreciation.</p>

  <p>"One more thing," went on the sheriff. "Some of you may think it was great
  guns to take Sinclair. It <i>was</i> a pretty good job, but they ain't no
  credit coming to me. I'm up here saying that all the praise goes to a fat
  friend of mine by name Arizona. If you got any free drinks, let 'em drift the
  way of Arizona. Hey, Arizona, step out and make a bow, will you?"</p>

  <p>But no Arizona appeared. The crowd cheered him, and then cheered the
  generous sheriff. Kern had won more by his frankness than he could possibly
  have won in half a dozen spectacular exploits with a gun.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25"></a>CHAPTER 25</h2>

  <p class="first">The crowd swirled out of the hotel before the sheriff and
  his prisoner, and then swirled back again. No use following the sheriff if
  they hoped for details. They knew his silence of old. Instead they picked off
  the members who had taken part in some phase of the fight, and drew them
  aside. As Sinclair went on down the street, the populace of Sour Creek was
  left pooled behind him. Various orators were giving accounts of how the whole
  thing had happened.</p>

  <p>Sinclair had neither eye nor ear for them. But he looked back and up to
  the western sky, with a flat-topped mountain clearly outlined against it.
  There was his country, and in his country he had left Jig alone and helpless.
  A feeling of utter desolation and failure came over him. He had started with
  a double-goal&mdash;Sandersen or Cartwright, or both. He had failed
  lamentably of reaching either one. He looked back to the sheriff, squat,
  insignificant, gray-headed. What a man to have blocked him!</p>

  <p>"But who's this Arizona?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I dunno. Seems to have known you somewhere. Maybe a friend of yours,
  Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the cowpuncher. "Maybe! Tell me: Was it him that was outside
  the window and trimmed the light on me?"</p>

  <p>"You got him right, Sinclair. That was the gent. Nice play he made,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Very pretty, sheriff. I thought I knowed his voice."</p>

  <p>"He seems to have made himself pretty infrequent. Didn't know Arizona was
  so darned modest."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's got other reasons," said Sinclair. "What's his full name?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't that curious! I ain't heard of anybody else that knows it. He's a
  cool head, this Arizona. Seemed to read your mind and know jest how you'd
  jump, Sinclair. I would have been off combing the trails, but he seemed to
  know that you'd come into town."</p>

  <p>"I'll sure keep him in mind if I ever meet up with him," murmured
  Sinclair. "Is this where I bunk?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff had paused before a squat, dumpy building and was working
  noisily at the lock with a big key. Now that his back was necessarily toward
  his prisoner, two of the posse stepped up close beside Sinclair. They had
  none of the sheriff's nonchalance. One of them was the man whose head had
  made the acquaintance of Sinclair's knee, and both were ready for instant
  action of any description.</p>

  <p>"I'm Rhinehart," said one softly. "Keep me in mind, Sinclair. I'm him that
  you smashed with your knee. Dirty work! I'll see you when you get out of the
  lockup&mdash;if that ever happens!"</p>

  <p>The voice of Sinclair was not so soft. "I'll meet you in jail or out," he
  answered, "on foot or on horseback, with fists or knife or gun. And you can
  lay to this, Rhinehart: I'll remember you a pile better'n you'll remember
  me!"</p>

  <p>All the repressed savagery of his nature came quivering into his voice as
  he spoke, and the other shrank instinctively a pace. In the meantime the
  sheriff had succeeded in turning the rusted lock, which squeaked back. The
  door grumbled on its heavy hinges. Sinclair stepped into the musty, close
  atmosphere within.</p>

  <p>"Don't look like you had much use for this here outfit," he said to the
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>The latter lighted a lantern.</p>

  <p>"Nope," he said. "It sure beats all how the luck runs, Sinclair. We'd had
  a pretty bad time with crooks around these parts, and them that was nabbed in
  Sour Creek got away; about two out of three, before they was brought to me at
  Woodville. So the boys got together and ponied up for this little jail, and
  it's as neat a pile of mud and steel as ever you see. Look at them bars. Kind
  of rusty, they look, but inside they're toolproof. Oh, it's an up-to-date
  outfit, this jail. It's been a comfort to me, and it's a credit to Sour
  Creek. But the trouble is that since it was built they ain't been more'n one
  or two to put in it. Maybe you can make out here for the night. Have you over
  to Woodville in a couple of days, Sinclair."</p>

  <p>He brought his prisoner into a cagelike cell, heavily guarded with bars on
  all sides. The adobe walls had been trusted in no direction. The steel lining
  was the strength of the Sour Creek jail. The sheriff himself set about
  shaking out the blankets. When this was done, he bade his two companions draw
  their guns and stand guard at the steel door to the cell.</p>

  <p>"Not that I don't trust you a good deal, Sinclair," he said, "but I know
  that a gent sometimes takes big chances."</p>

  <p>So saying, he cut the bonds of his prisoner, but instead of making a
  plunge at the door, Sinclair merely stretched his long arms luxuriously above
  his head. The sheriff slipped out of the door and closed it after him. A
  heavy and prolonged clangor followed, as steel jarred home against steel.</p>

  <p>"Don't go sheriff," said Sinclair. "I need a chat with you."</p>

  <p>"I'm in no hurry. And here's the gent we was talking about. Here's
  Arizona!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff had waved his two companions out of the jail, as soon as the
  prisoner was securely lodged, and no sooner was this done, and they had
  departed through the doorway, than the heavy figure of Arizona himself
  appeared. He came slowly into the circle of the lantern light, an oddly
  changed man.</p>

  <p>His swaggering gait, with heels that pounded heavily, was gone. He slunk
  forward, soft-footed. His head, usually so buoyantly erect, was now sunk
  lower and forward. His high color had faded to a drab olive. In fact, from a
  free- swinging, jovial, somewhat overbearing demeanor, Arizona had changed to
  a mien of malicious and rather frightened cunning. In this wise he advanced,
  heedless of the curious and astonished sheriff, until his face was literally
  pressed against the bars. He peered steadily at Sinclair.</p>

  <p>On the face of the latter there had been at first blank surprise, then a
  gradually dawning recognition. Finally he walked slowly to the bars. As
  Sinclair approached, the fat cowpuncher drew back, with lingering catlike
  steps, as if he grudged every inch of his retreat and yet dared not remain to
  meet Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"By the Eternal," said Sinclair, "it's Dago!"</p>

  <p>Arizona halted, quivering with emotions which the sheriff could not
  identify, save for a blind, intense malice. The tall man turned to the
  sheriff, smiling: "Dago Lansing, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Never heard that name," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," replied Sinclair, "but that's the man I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" cried Arizona huskily, and his fat, swift hand fluttered
  nervously around the butt of the revolver. "Sheriff, they ain't nothing but
  lies stocked up in him. Don't believe nothing he says!"</p>

  <p>"Huh!" chuckled Sinclair. "Why, Kern, he's a man about eight years ago
  that I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Pausing, he looked into the convulsed face of Arizona, who was apparently
  tortured with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"I won't go on, Dago," said Sinclair mildly. "But&mdash;so you've carried
  this grudge all these days, eh?"</p>

  <p>Arizona tossed up his head. For a moment he was the Arizona the sheriff
  had known, but his laughter was too strident, and it was easy to see that he
  was at a point of hysterically high tension.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd have carried it eighty years as easy as eight," declared
  Arizona. "I been waiting all this time, and now I got you, Sinclair. You'll
  rot behind the bars the best part of the life that's left to you. And when
  you come out&mdash;I'll meet you ag'in!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair smiled in a singular fashion. "Sorry to disappoint you, Dago. But
  I'm not coming out. I'm going to stay put. I'm through." The other blinked.
  "How come?"</p>

  <p>"It's something you couldn't figure," said Sinclair calmly, and he eyed
  the fat man as if from a great distance.</p>

  <p>Sinclair was remembering the day, eight years ago, in a lumber camp to the
  north when a shivering, meager, shifty-eyed youngster had come among them
  asking for work. They had taken pity on him, those big lumberjacks, put him
  up, given him money, kept him at the bunk house.</p>

  <p>Then articles began to disappear, watches, money. It was Sinclair who had
  caught the friendless stripling in the act of sleight of hand in the middle
  of the night when the laborers, tired out, slept as if stunned. And when the
  others would have let the cringing, weeping youth go with a lecture and the
  return of his illicit spoils, it was the stern Sinclair who had insisted on
  driving home the lesson. He forced them to strip Dago to the waist. Two
  stalwarts held his hands, and Sinclair laid on the whip. And Dago, the moment
  the lash fell, ceased his wailing and begging, and stood quivering, with his
  head bent, his teeth set and gritting, until the punishment was ended.</p>

  <p>It was Sinclair, also, when the thing was ended, and the others would have
  thrust the boy out penniless, who split the contents of his wallet with Dago.
  He remembered the words he had spoken to the stripling that day eight years
  before.</p>

  <p>"You ain't had much luck out here in the West, kid, but stay around. Go
  south. Learn to ride a hoss. They's nothing that puts heart and honesty in a
  man like a good hoss. Don't go back to your city. You'll turn into a snake
  there. Stay out here and practice being a man, will you? Get the feel of a
  Colt. Fight your way. Keep your mouth shut and work with your hands. And
  don't brag about what you know or what you've done. That's the way to get on.
  You got the markings in you, son. You got grit. I seen it when you was under
  the whip, and I wish I had the doing of that over again. I made a mistake
  with you, kid. But do what I've told you to do, and one of these days you'll
  meet up with me and beat me to the draw and take everything you got as a
  grudge out on me. But you can't do it unless you turn into a man."</p>

  <p>Dago had listened in the most profound silence, accepted the money without
  thanks, and disappeared, never to be heard from again. In the sleek- faced
  man before him, Sinclair could hardly recognize that slender fellow of the
  lumber camp. Only the bright and agile eyes were the same; that, and a
  certain telltale nervousness of hand. The color was coming back into his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I guess I've done it," Arizona was saying. "I guess we're squared up,
  Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Yep, and a balance on your side."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, maybe not. But I've followed your advice, Long Riley. I've never
  forgot a word of it. It was printed into me!"</p>

  <p>He made a significant, short gesture, as if he were snapping a whip, and a
  snarl of undying malice curled his lips.</p>

  <p>"As long as you live, Sinclair," he added. "As long as you live, I'll
  remember."</p>

  <p>Even the sheriff shuddered at that glimpse into the black soul of a man;
  Sinclair alone was unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I reckon you've barked enough, Arizona," he suggested. "S'pose you trot
  along. I got to have words with my friend, the sheriff."</p>

  <p>Arizona waved his fat hand. He was recovering his ordinary poise, and with
  a smiling good night to the sheriff, he turned away through the door.</p>

  <p>"Nice, friendly sort, eh?" remarked Sinclair the moment he was alone with
  Kern.</p>

  <p>"I still got the chills," said the sheriff. "Sure has got a wicked pair of
  eyes, that Arizona."</p>

  <p>Kern cast an apprehensive glance at the closed door, yet, in spite of the
  fact that it was closed, he lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"What in thunder have you done to him, Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"About eight years ago&mdash;" began Sinclair and then stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Let it go," he went on. "No matter what Arizona is today, he's sure
  improved on the gent I used to know. What's done is done. Besides, I made a
  mistake that time. I went too far with him, and a mistake is like borrowed
  money, sheriff. It lays up interest and keeps compounding. When you have to
  pay back what you done a long time ago, you find it's a terrible pile. That's
  all I got to say about Arizona."</p>

  <p>Sheriff Kern nodded. "That's straight talk, Sinclair," he said softly.
  "But what was it you wanted to see me about?"</p>

  <p>"Cold Feet," said Sinclair.</p>

  <p>At once the sheriff brightened. "That's right," he said hurriedly. "You
  got the right idea now, partner. Glad to see you're using hoss sense. And if
  you gimme an idea of the trail that'll lead to Cold Feet, I can see to it
  that you get out of this mess pretty pronto. After all, you ain't done no
  real harm except for nicking Cartwright in the arm, and I figure that he
  needs a little punishment. It'll cool his temper down."</p>

  <p>"You think I ought to tell you where Cold Feet is?" asked Sinclair without
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Him and me sat around the same campfire, sheriff, and ate off'n the same
  deer."</p>

  <p>At this the sheriff winced. "I know," he murmured. "It's hard&mdash;
  mighty hard!" He continued more smoothly: "But listen to me, partner. There's
  twenty-five-hundred dollars on the head of Cold Feet. Why not come in? Why
  not split on it? Plenty for both of us; and, speaking personal, I could use
  half that money, and maybe you could use the other half just as well!"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said Sinclair, "I'll give you the layout for
  finding Cold Feet. Ride west out of Sour Creek and head for a flat-topped
  mountain. On the shoulder just under the head of the peak you'll find Cold
  Feet. Go get him!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff caught his breath, then whirled on his heel. The sharp voice
  of Sinclair called him back.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. I ain't through. When you catch Cold Feet you go after him
  without guns."</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>"Because you might hurt him, and he can't fight, sheriff. Even if he was
  to pull a gun, he couldn't hit nothing with it. He couldn't hit the ground
  he's standing on with a gun."</p>

  <p>Sheriff Kern scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"And when you get him," went on Sinclair, "tell him to go back and take up
  his life where he left off, because they's no harm coming to him."</p>

  <p>"Great guns, man! No harm coming to him with a murder to his count and a
  price on his head?"</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say. Break it to him real gentle."</p>

  <p>"And who pays for the killing of Quade?"</p>

  <p>Sinclair smiled. He was finding it far easier to do it than he had ever
  imagined. The moment he made the resolve, his way was smoothed for him.</p>

  <p>"I pay for Quade," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Because I killed him, sheriff. Now go tell Cold Feet that his score is
  clean!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>CHAPTER 26</h2>

  <p class="first">Toward the flat-topped mountain, with the feeling of his
  fate upon him, Bill Sandersen pushed his mustang through the late evening,
  while the darkness fell. He had long since stopped thinking, reasoning. There
  was only the strong, blind feeling that he must meet Sinclair face to face
  and decide his destiny in one brief struggle.</p>

  <p>So he kept on until his shadow fell faintly on his path before him, long,
  shapeless, grotesque. He turned and saw the moon coming up above the eastern
  mountains, a wan, sickly moon hardly out of her first quarter, and even in
  the pure mountain air her light was dim.</p>

  <p>But it gave thought and pause to Sandersen. First there was the
  outcropping of a singular superstition which he had heard long before and
  never remembered until this moment: that a moon seen over the left shoulder
  meant the worst of bad luck. It boded very ill for the end of this
  adventure.</p>

  <p>Suppose he were able only partially to surprise the big cowpuncher from
  the north, and that there was a call for fighting. What chance would he have
  in the dim and bewildering light of that moon against the surety of Sinclair
  who shot, he knew, as other men point the finger&mdash;instinctively hitting
  the target? It would be a mere butchery, not a battle.</p>

  <p>Sending his mustang into a copse of young trees, he dismounted. His mind
  was made up not to attempt the blow until the first light of dawn. He would
  try to reach the top of the flat-crested mountain well before sunup, when
  there would be a real light instead of this ghostly and partial illumination
  from the moon.</p>

  <p>Among the trees he sat down and took up the dreadful watches of the night.
  Sleep never came near him. He was turning the back pages of his memory,
  reviewing his past with the singular clearness of a man about to die. For
  Sandersen had this mortal certainty resting upon his mind that he must try to
  strike down Sinclair, and that he would fail. And failure meant only one
  alternative&mdash;death. He was perfectly confident that this was the truth.
  He knew with prophetic surety that he would never again see the kind light of
  the sun, that in a half-light, in the cold of the dawn, a bullet would end
  his life.</p>

  <p>What he saw in the past was not comforting. A long train of vivid memories
  came up in his mind. He had accomplished nothing. In the total course of his
  life he had not made a man his friend, or won the love of a woman. In all his
  attempts to succeed in life there had been nothing but disastrous failures,
  and wherever he moved he involved others in his fall. Certainly the
  prospecting trip with the three other men had been worse than all the rest,
  but it had been typical. It had been he who first suggested the trip, and he
  had rounded the party together and sustained it with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>It had been he who led it into the mountains and across the desert. And on
  the terrible return trip he knew, with an abiding sense of guilt, that he
  alone could have checked the murderous and cowardly impulse of Quade. He
  alone could have overruled Quade and Lowrie; or, failing to overrule them he
  should at least have stayed with the cripple and helped him on, with the
  chance of death for them both.</p>

  <p>When he thought of that noble opportunity lost, he writhed. It would have
  gained the deathless affection of Hal Sinclair and saved that young, strong
  life. It would have won him more. It would have made Riley Sinclair his ally
  so long as he lived. And how easy to have done it, he thought, looking
  back.</p>

  <p>Instead, he had given way; and already the result had been the death of
  three men. The tale was not yet told, he was sure. Another death was due. A
  curse lay on that entire party, and it would not be ended until he,
  Sandersen, the soul of the enterprise, fell.</p>

  <p>The moon grew old in the west. Then he took the saddle again and rode,
  brooding, up the trail, his horse stumbling over the stones as the animal
  grew wearier in the climb.</p>

  <p>And then, keeping his gaze fastened above him, he saw the outline of the
  crests grow more and more distinct. He looked behind. In the east the light
  was growing. The whole horizon was rimmed with a pale glow.</p>

  <p>Now his spirits rose. Even this gray dawn was far better than the
  treacherous moonlight. A daylight calm came over him. He was stronger, surer
  of himself. Impatiently he drew out his Colt and looked to its action. The
  familiar weight added to his self-belief. It became possible for him to
  fight, and being possible to fight, it was also possible to conquer.</p>

  <p>Presently he reached a bald upland. The fresh wind of the morning struck
  his face, and he breathed deep of it. Why could he not return to Sour Creek
  as a hero, and why could he not collect the price on the head of Riley
  Sinclair?</p>

  <p>The thought made him alert, savage. A moment later, his head pushing up to
  the level of the shoulder of the mountain, he saw his quarry. In the dimness
  of that early dawn he made out the form of a sleeper huddled in blankets, but
  it was enough. That must be Riley Sinclair. It could not be another, and all
  his premonitions were correct.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he became aware that he could not fail. It was impossible! As
  gloomy as he had been before, his spirits now leaped to the heights. He swung
  down from the saddle, softly, slowly, and went up the hill without once
  drawing his eyes from that motionless form in the blankets.</p>

  <p>Once something stirred to the right and far below him. He flashed a glance
  in that direction and saw that it was a hobbled horse, though not the horse
  of Sinclair; but that mattered nothing. The second horse might be among the
  trees.</p>

  <p>Easing his step and tightening the grip on his revolver, he drew closer.
  Should he shoot without warning? No, he would lean over the sleeper, call his
  name, and let him waken and see his death before it came to him. Otherwise
  the triumph would be robbed of half of its sweetness.</p>

  <p>Now he had come sufficiently near to make out distinctly that there was
  only one sleeper. Had Sinclair and Cold Feet separated? If so, this must be
  Sinclair. The latter might have the boldness to linger so close to danger,
  but certainly never Cold Feet, even if he had once worked his courage to the
  point of killing a man. He stepped closer, leaned, and then by the half-light
  made out the pale, delicate features of the schoolteacher.</p>

  <p>For the moment Sandersen was stunned with disappointment, and yet his
  spirits rose again almost at once. If Sinclair had fled, all the better. He
  would not return, at least for a long time, and in the meantime, he,
  Sandersen, would collect the money on the head of Cold Feet!</p>

  <p>With the Colt close to the breast of Jig, he said: "Wake up, Cold
  Feet!"</p>

  <p>The girl opened her eyes, struggled to sit up, and was thrust back by the
  muzzle of the gun, held with rocklike firmness in the hand of Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"Riley&mdash;what&mdash;" she muttered sleepily and then she made out the
  face of Sandersen distinctly.</p>

  <p>Instantly she was wide awake, whiter than ever, staring. Better to take
  the desperado alive than dead&mdash;far better. Cold Feet would make a show
  in Sour Creek for the glorification of Sandersen, as he rode down through the
  main street, and the men would come out to see the prize which even Sheriff
  Kern and his posse had not yet been able to take.</p>

  <p>"Roll over on your face."</p>

  <p>Cold Feet obeyed without a murmur. There was a coiled rope by the cinders
  of the fire. Sandersen cut off a convenient length and bound the slender
  wrists behind the back of the schoolteacher. Then he jerked his quarry to a
  sitting posture.</p>

  <p>"Where's Sinclair gone?"</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, Cold Feet's face brightened wonderfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then you haven't found him? You haven't found him? Thank
  goodness!"</p>

  <p>Sandersen studied the schoolteacher closely. It was impossible to mistake
  the frankness of the latter's face.</p>

  <p>"By guns," he said at last, "I see it all now. The skunk sneaked off in
  the middle of the night and left you alone here to face the music?"</p>

  <p>Jig flushed, as she exclaimed: "That's not true. He's never run away in
  his life."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," muttered Sandersen apprehensively. "Maybe he'll come back
  ag'in. Maybe he's just rode off after something and will be back."</p>

  <p>At once the old fear swept over him. His apprehensive glance flickered
  over the rocks and trees around him&mdash;a thousand secure hiding places. He
  faced the schoolteacher again.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Jig: You're charged with a murder, you see? I can take you
  dead or alive; and the shot that bumped you off might bring Sinclair running
  to find out what'd happened, and he'd go the same way. But will you promise
  to keep your mouth shut and give no warning when Sinclair heaves in sight?
  Take your pick. It don't make no difference to me, one way or the other; but
  I can't have the two of you on my hands."</p>

  <p>To his surprise Jig did not answer at once.</p>

  <p>"Ain't I made myself clear? Speak out!"</p>

  <p>"I won't promise," said Cold Feet, raising the colorless face.</p>

  <p>"Then, by thunder, I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the sudden contorting of his face she saw her death, but as she closed
  her eyes and waited for the report and the tear of the bullet, she heard him
  muttering: "No, they's a better way."</p>

  <p>A moment later her mouth was wrenched open, and a huge wadded bandanna was
  stuffed into it. Sandersen pushed her back to the ground and tossed the
  blanket over her again.</p>

  <p>"You ain't much of a man, Jig, but as a bait for my trap you'll do
  tolerable well. You're right: Sinclair's coming back, and when he comes, I'll
  be waiting for him out of sight behind the rock. But listen to this, Jig. If
  you wrastle around and try to get that gag out of your mouth, I ain't going
  to take no chances. Whether Sinclair's in sight or not, I'm going to drill
  you clean. Now lie still and keep thinking on what I told you. I mean it
  all!"</p>

  <p>With a final scowl he left her and hurried to the rock. It made an ideal
  shelter for his purposes. On three sides, the rock made a thick and effectual
  parapet. A thousand bullets might splash harmlessly against that stone; and
  through crevices he commanded the whole sweep of the mountainside beneath
  them. The courage which had been growing in Sandersen, now reached a climax.
  Below him lay the helpless body of one prize&mdash;from a distance apparently
  a sound and quiet sleeper, though Sandersen could see the terrified glint of
  Jig's eyes.</p>

  <p>But he forgot that a moment later, when he saw the form of a horseman
  break out of covert from the trees farther down the mountain and immediately
  disappear again. Sinclair? He studied the barrel of the revolver, but the
  horseman appeared no more in the brightening and misty dawn. It was only
  after a long pause that there issued from the trees, not Riley Sinclair, but
  the squat, thick form of Arizona!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>CHAPTER 27</h2>

  <p class="first">Behind the sheriff's apprehensive glance there had been
  reason. True the door had closed upon Arizona, and the door was thick. But
  the moment Arizona had passed through the door, he clapped his ear to the
  keyhole and listened, holding his breath, for he was certain that the moment
  his back was turned the shameful story of his exploits in the lumber camp
  eight years before would come out for the edification of Kern. If so, it
  meant ruin for him. Arizona was closed to him; all this district would be
  closed by the story of his early light-fingeredness. He felt as if he were
  being driven to the wall. Consequently he listened with set teeth to the
  early questions of the sheriff; then he breathed easier, still incredulous,
  when he heard Sinclair refuse to tell the tale.</p>

  <p>Still he lingered, dreading that the truth might out, and so heard the
  talk turn to a new channel&mdash;Cold Feet. Cold Feet meant many things to
  Sour Creek; to Arizona, the schoolteacher meant only one thing&mdash;twenty-
  five-hundred dollars. And Arizona was broke.</p>

  <p>To his hungry ear came the tidings: "I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give
  you the layout for finding Cold Feet. Ride west out of Sour Creek and head
  for a flat-topped mountain. On the shoulder just under the head you'll find
  Cold Feet. Go get him!"</p>

  <p>To Arizona it seemed as if this last injunction were personal advice. He
  waited to hear no more; if he had paused for a moment he might have learned
  that the hope of twenty-five hundred was an illusion and a snare. He saw the
  bright vision of a small fortune placed in his hands as the result of a
  single gunplay. He had seen the schoolteacher. He knew by instinct that there
  was no fighting quality in Jig. And the moment he heard the location it was
  as good as cash in his pocket, he was sure.</p>

  <p>There was only one difficulty. He must beat out the sheriff. To that end
  he hurried to the stable behind the hotel, broke all records for speed in
  getting the saddle on his roan mare, and then jogged her quietly out of town
  so as to rouse no suspicions. But hardly was he past the outskirts, hardly
  crediting his good luck that the sheriff himself was not yet on the way, than
  he touched the flanks with his spurs and sent the mare flying west.</p>

  <p>In the west the moon was dropping behind the upper ranges, as he rode
  through the foothills; when he began to climb the side of the mountain, the
  dawn began to grow. So much the better for Arizona. But, knowing that he had
  only Cold Feet to deal with, he did not adopt all the caution of Sandersen on
  the same trail. Instead he cut boldly straight for the shoulder of the
  mountain, knowing what he would find there on his arrival. In the nearest
  grove he left his horse and then walked swiftly up to the level. There the
  first thing that caught his eyes was the form wrapped in the blanket. But the
  next thing he saw was the pale glimmer of the dawn on the barrel of a
  revolver. He reached for his own gun, only to see, over the rock above him,
  the grinning face of Sandersen arise.</p>

  <p>"Too late, Arizona," called the tall man. "Too late for one job, partner,
  but just in time for the next!"</p>

  <p>Arizona cursed softly, steadily, through snarling lips.</p>

  <p>"What job?"</p>

  <p>"Sinclair! He's gone, but he'll be back any minute. And it'll need us both
  to down him, Arizona. We'll split on Sinclair's reward."</p>

  <p>Disgust and wrath consumed Arizona. Without other answer he strode to the
  prostrate form, slashed the rope and tore the handkerchief from between the
  teeth of Cold Feet. The schoolteacher sat up, gasping for breath, purple of
  face.</p>

  <p>"Leave him be!" cried Sandersen, his voice shrill with anger. "Leave him
  be! He's the bait, Arizona, and we're the trap that'll catch Sinclair."</p>

  <p>But Arizona cursed again bitterly. "Leave that bait lie till the sun burns
  it up. You'll never catch Sinclair with it."</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>From around the rock Sandersen appeared and walked down to the fat
  man.</p>

  <p>"Because Sinclair's already caught."</p>

  <p>If he had expected the tall man to groan with disappointment, there was a
  surprise in store for him. Sandersen exclaimed shrilly for joy.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair took! Took dead, then!"</p>

  <p>"Dead? Why?"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean he was taken alive?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I sure do! And I done the figuring that led up to him being
  caught."</p>

  <p>The slender form of Jig rose before them, trembling.</p>

  <p>"It isn't true! It isn't true! There aren't enough of you in Sour Creek to
  take Riley Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>"Ain't it true?" asked Arizona. "All right, son, you'll meet him pronto in
  the Sour Creek jail, unless the boys finish their party of the other day and
  string you up before you get inside the jail."</p>

  <p>This brought a peculiar, low-pitched moan from Cold Feet.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up," said Sandersen. "You ain't swinging yet awhile."</p>

  <p>"But he's hurt! If he's alive, he's terribly wounded?"</p>

  <p>Arizona beat down the appealing hand with a brutal gesture.</p>

  <p>"No, he ain't particular hurt. Just his neck squashed a bit where the
  sheriff throttled him. He didn't fight enough to get hurt, curse him!"</p>

  <p>Frowning, Sandersen shook his head. "He's a fighting man, Arizona, if they
  ever was one."</p>

  <p>It seemed that everything infuriated the fat man.</p>

  <p>"What d'you know about it, Lanky?" he demanded of Sandersen. "Didn't I run
  the affair? Wasn't it me that planted the whole trap? Wasn't it me that
  knowed he'd come into town for you or Cartwright?"</p>

  <p>"Cartwright!" gasped Jig.</p>

  <p>"Sure! We nailed him in Cartwright's room, just the way I said we would.
  And they laughed at me, the fools!"</p>

  <p>He might have gathered singular inferences from the lowered head of Jig
  and the soft murmur: "I might have known&mdash;I might have known he'd try
  for me."</p>

  <p>"And I might have had the pleasure of drilling him clean," said Arizona,
  harking back to it with savage pleasure, "but I shot out the light. I wanted
  him to die slow, and before the end I wanted to pry his eyes open and make
  him see my face and know that it was me that done for him! That was what I
  wanted. But he turned yaller and wouldn't fight."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't kill," said Jig coldly. "But for courage&mdash;I laugh at
  you, Arizona!"</p>

  <p>"Easy," scowled the cowpuncher. "Easy, Jig. You ain't behind the bars yet.
  You're in reach of my fist, and I'd think nothing of busting you in the face.
  Shut up till I talk to you."</p>

  <p>The misty eyes of Sandersen brightened a little and grew hard. There was a
  great deal of fighting spirit in the man, and his easy victory of that
  morning had roused him to a battling pitch.</p>

  <p>"Looks to me like you ain't running this here party, Arizona," he said
  dryly. "If there are any directions to give Cold Feet, I'll give 'em. It was
  me that took him!"</p>

  <p>No direct answer could Arizona find to this true statement, and, as always
  when a man is at a loss for words, his temper rose, and his fists clenched.
  For the first time he looked at Sandersen with an eye of savage calculation.
  He had come to hope of a tidy little fortune. He had found it snatched out of
  his hand, and, as he measured Sandersen, his heart rose. Twenty- five-hundred
  dollars would fairly well equip him in life. The anger faded out of his eyes,
  and in its place came the cold gleam of the man who thinks and calculates.
  All at once he began to smile, a mirthless smile that was of the lips
  only.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right, Sandersen, but I'm thinking you'd have to prove that
  you took Cold Feet.'</p>

  <p>"Prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! The boys wouldn't be apt to believe that sleepy Sandersen woke up
  and took Cold Feet alive."</p>

  <p>Instantly the gorge of Sandersen rose, and he began to see red.</p>

  <p>"Are you out to find trouble, Fatty?"</p>

  <p>The adjective found no comfortable lodging place in the mind of
  Arizona.</p>

  <p>"Me? Sure I ain't. I'm just stating facts the way I know 'em."</p>

  <p>"Well, the facts you know ain't worth a damn."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>It was growing clearer and clearer to the fat man that between him and
  twenty-five-hundred dollars there stood only the unamiable figure of the
  long, lean cowpuncher. He steadied his eye till a fixed glitter came in it.
  He hated lean men by instinct and distrusted them.</p>

  <p>"Sure they ain't. How you going to get around the fact that I did take
  Cold Feet?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Sandersen, you see that they's twenty-five-hundred dollars hanging
  on the head of this Cold Feet?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly! And I see ten ways of spending just that amount."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Arizona.</p>

  <p>"You do?"</p>

  <p>"Partner, you've heard me talk!"</p>

  <p>"Arizona, you're talking mighty queer. What d'ye mean?"</p>

  <p>"Now, suppose it was me that brought in Cold Feet, who'd get the
  money?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you that brought him in?"</p>

  <p>"Yep, me. And suppose I brought him in with two murders charged to him
  instead of one."</p>

  <p>"I don't foller you. What's the second murder, Fatty?"</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Sandersen blinked and gave back a little. Plainly he was beginning to fear
  that the reason of Arizona was unbalanced.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you how it'll be charged to Cold Feet," said the fat man.</p>

  <p>Taking the cartridge belt of Jig he shook the revolver out of the holster
  and pumped a shot into the ground. The sharp crack of the explosion roused no
  echo for a perceptible space. Then it struck back at them from a solid wall
  of rock, almost as loud as it had been in fact. Off among the hills the echo
  was repeated to a faint whisper. Arizona dropped the revolver carelessly on
  the ground.</p>

  <p>"Fatty, you've gone nutty," said Sandersen.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you a yarn," said Arizona.</p>

  <p>Sandersen looked past him to the east. The light was growing rapidly about
  the mountains. In another moment or so that sunrise which he had been looking
  forward to with such solemn dread, would occur. He was safe, of course, and
  still that sense of impending danger would not leave him. He noted Jig,
  erect, very pale, watching them with intense and frightened interest.</p>

  <p>"Here's the story," went on the fat man. "I come out of Sour Creek hunting
  for Cold Feet. I came straight to this here mountain. Halfway up the side I
  hear a shot. I hurry along and soft-foot on to this shoulder. I see Cold Feet
  standing, over the dead body of Sandersen. Then I stick up Cold Feet and take
  him back to Sour Creek and get the reward. Won't that be two murders on his
  head?"</p>

  <p>The thin Swede rubbed his chin. "For a grown man, Fatty, you're doing a
  lot of supposing."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to turn it into fact," said Arizona.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"With a chunk of lead! Pull your gun, you lanky fool!"</p>

  <p>It seemed to Jig, watching with terrible interest, that Sandersen stared
  not at Arizona, as he went for his gun, but beyond the stubby cowpuncher
  &mdash;far behind and into the east, where the dawn was growing brighter,
  losing its color, as sunrises do, just before the rising of the sun. His long
  arm jerked back, the revolver whipped into his hand, and he stiffened his
  forearm for the shot.</p>

  <p>All that Jig saw, with eyes sharpened, so that each movement seemed to be
  taking whole seconds, was a sneering Arizona, waiting till the last second.
  When he moved, however, it was with an almost leisurely flip of the wrist.
  The heavy Colt was conjured into his hand. With graceful ease the big weapon
  slipped out and exploded before Sandersen's forefinger had curled around the
  trigger.</p>

  <p>Out of the hand of the Swede slipped the gun and clanged unheeded on the
  ground at his feet. She saw a patch of red spring up on his breast, while he
  lurched forward with long, stiff strides, threw up his hands to the east, and
  pitched on his face. She turned from the dead thing at her feet.</p>

  <p>The white rim of the sun had just slid over the top of a mountain.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap28"

  <p class="first">She dropped to her knees, and with a sudden, hysterical
  strength she was able to turn him on his back. He was dead. The first glimpse
  of his face told her that. She looked up into the eyes of the murderer.</p>

  <p>Arizona was methodically cleaning his gun. His color had not changed.
  There was a singular placidity about all his movements.</p>

  <p>"I just hurried up what was coming to him," said Arizona coolly, as he
  finished reloading his Colt. "Sinclair was after him, and that meant he was
  done for."</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, she found that she was neither very much afraid of the fat
  man, nor did she loathe him for his crime. He seemed outside of the
  jurisdiction of the laws which govern most men.</p>

  <p>"You said Sinclair is in jail."</p>

  <p>"Sure, and he is. But they don't make jails strong enough in these parts
  to hold Sinclair. He'd have come out and landed Sandersen, just as he's going
  to come out and land Cartwright. What has he got agin' Cartwright, d'you
  know?"</p>

  <p>Oh, it was incredible that he could talk so calmly with the dead man
  before him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she murmured and drew back.</p>

  <p>"Well, take it all in all," pursued Arizona, "this deal of mine is pretty
  rotten, but you'd swing just the same for one murder as for two. They won't
  hang you no deader, eh? And when they come to look at it, this is pretty
  neat. Sandersen wasn't no good. Everybody knowed that. But he had one thing I
  wanted &mdash;which was you and the twenty-five hundred that goes with the
  gent that brings you into Sour Creek. So, at the price of one bullet, I get
  the coin. Pretty neat, I say ag'in."</p>

  <p>Dropping the revolver back into the holster he patted it with a caressing
  hand.</p>

  <p>"There's your gun," went on Arizona, chuckling. "It's got a bullet fired
  out of it. There's Sandersen's gun with no bullet fired, showing that, while
  he was stalking you, you shot and drilled him. Here's my gun with no sign of
  a shot fired. Which proves that I just slid in here and stuck you up from
  behind, while you were looking over the gent you'd just killed."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his hands together, and bracing himself firmly on his stubby
  legs, looked almost benevolently on Jig.</p>

  <p>Not only did she lose her horror of him, but she gained an impersonal,
  detached interest in the workings of his mind. She looked on him not as a man
  but as a monster in the guise of a man.</p>

  <p>"Two deaths," she said quietly, "for your money. You work cheaply,
  Arizona."</p>

  <p>Jig's criticism seemed to pique him.</p>

  <p>"How come?"</p>

  <p>"Sandersen's death by your bullet, and mine when I die in the law. Both to
  your account, Arizona, because you know I'm innocent."</p>

  <p>"I know it, but a hunch ain't proof in the eyes of the law. Besides, I
  don't work so cheap. Sandersen was no good. He ain't worth thinking about.
  And as for you, Jig, though I don't like to throw it in your face, as a
  schoolteacher you may be all right, but as a man you ain't worth a damn.
  Nope. I won't give neither of you a thought&mdash;except for Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Ah?"</p>

  <p>"Him and you have been bunkies, if he ever should find out what I done,
  he'd go on my trail. Maybe he will anyway. And he's a bad one to have on a
  gent's trail."</p>

  <p>"You fear him?" she asked curiously, for it had seemed impossible that
  this cold-blooded gunman feared any living thing.</p>

  <p>He rolled a cigarette meditatively before he answered.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said, "I fear him. I ain't a fool. It was him that started me,
  and him that gave me the first main lessons. But I ain't got the nacheral
  talent with a gun that Sinclair has got."</p>

  <p>Nodding his head in confirmation, his expression softened, as with the
  admiration of one artist for a greater kindred spirit.</p>

  <p>"The proof is that they's a long list of gunfights in Sinclair's past, but
  not more deaths than you can count on the fingers of one hand. And them that
  he killed was plumb no good. The rest he winged and let 'em go. That's his
  way, and it takes an artist with a gun to work like that. Yep, he's a great
  man, curse him! Only one weak thing I ever hear of him doing. He buckled to
  the sheriff and told him where to find you!"</p>

  <p>Scratching a match on his trousers, the cowpuncher was amazed to hear Jig
  cry: "You lie!"</p>

  <p>He gaped at her until the match singed his fingers. "That's a tolerable
  loud word for a kid to use!"</p>

  <p>Apparently he meditated punishment, but then he shrugged his shoulders and
  lighted his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Wild horses couldn't have dragged it out of him!" Jig was repeating.</p>

  <p>"Say," said the fat man, grinning, "how d'you know <i>I</i> knew where you
  was?"</p>

  <p>Like a blow in the face it silenced her. She looked miserably down to the
  ground. Was it possible that Sinclair had betrayed her? Not for the murder of
  Quade. He would be more apt to confess that himself, and indeed she dreaded
  the confession. But if he let her be dragged back, if her identity became
  known, she faced what was more horrible to her than hanging, and that was
  life with Cartwright.</p>

  <p>"Which reminds me," said Arizona, "that the old sheriff may not wait for
  morning before he starts after you. Just slope down the hill and saddle your
  hoss, will you?"</p>

  <p>Automatically she obeyed, wild thoughts running through her mind. To go
  back to Sour Creek meant a return to Cartwright, and then nothing could save
  her from him. Halfway to her saddle her foot struck metal, her own gun, which
  Arizona had dropped after firing the bullet. Was there not a possibility of
  escape? She heard Arizona humming idly behind her. Plainly he was entirely
  off guard.</p>

  <p>Bending with the speed of a bird in picking up a seed, she scooped up the
  gun, whirling with the heavy weapon extended, her forefinger curling on the
  trigger. But, as she turned, the humming of Arizona changed to a low snarl.
  She saw him coming like a bolt. The gun exploded of its own volition, it
  seemed to her, but Arizona had swerved in his course, and the shot went
  wild.</p>

  <p>The next instant he struck her. The gun was wrenched from her hand, and a
  powerful arm caught her and whirled her up, only to hurl her to the ground;
  Arizona's snarling, panting face bent over her. In the very midst of that
  fury she felt Arizona stiffen and freeze; the snarling stopped; his nerveless
  arm fell away, and she was allowed to stagger to her feet. She found him
  staring at her with a peculiar horror.</p>

  <p>"Murdering guns!" whispered Arizona.</p>

  <p>Now she understood that he knew. She saw him changed, humbled, disarmed
  before her. But even then she did not understand the profound meaning of that
  moment in the life of Arizona.</p>

  <p>But to have understood, she would have had to know how that life began in
  a city slum. She would have had to see the career of the sneak thief which
  culminated in the episode of the lumber camp eight years before. She would
  have had to understand how the lesson from the hand of big Sinclair had begun
  the change which transformed the sneak into the dangerous man of action. And
  now the second change had come. For Arizona had made the unique discovery
  that he could be ashamed!</p>

  <p>He would have laughed had another told him. Virtue was a name and no more
  to the fat man. But in spite of himself those eight years under free skies
  had altered him. He had been growing when he thought he was standing still.
  When the eye plunges forty miles from mountain to mountain, through
  crystal-clear air, the mind is enlarged. He had lived exclusively among
  hard-handed men, rejoicing in a strength greater than their own. He suddenly
  found that the feeble hand from which he had so easily torn the weapon a
  moment before, had in an instant acquired strength to make or break him.</p>

  <p>All that Jig could discern of this was that her life was no longer in
  danger, and that her enemy had been disarmed. But she was not prepared for
  what followed.</p>

  <p>Dragging off his hat, as if he acted reluctantly, his eyes sank until they
  rested on the ground at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Lady," he said, "I didn't know. I didn't even dream what you was."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29"></a>CHAPTER 29</h2>

  <p class="first">Gradually she found her breath and greater self-
  possession.</p>

  <p>"You mean I'm free?" she asked him. "You won't make me go into Sour
  Creek?"</p>

  <p>His face twisted as if in pain. "Make you?" he asked violently. "I'd blow
  the head off the first one that tried to make you take a step."</p>

  <p>Suddenly it seemed to her that all this was ordered and arranged, that
  some mysterious Providence had sent this man here to save her from Sandersen
  and all the horror that the future promised, just as Sinclair had saved her
  once before from a danger which he himself had half created.</p>

  <p>"I got this to say," went on Arizona, struggling for the words. "Looks to
  me like you might have need of a friend to help you along, wherever you're
  going." He shook his thick shoulders. "Sure gives me a jolt to think of what
  you must have gone through, wandering around here all by yourself! I sure
  don't see how you done it!"</p>

  <p>And all this time the man whom Arizona had killed, was lying face up to
  the morning, hardly a pace behind him! But she dared not try to analyze this
  man. She could only feel vaguely that an ally had been given her, an ally of
  strength. He, too, must have sensed what was in her mind.</p>

  <p>"You'll be wanting this, I reckon."</p>

  <p>Returning the Colt to her, he slowly dragged his glance from the ground
  and let it cross her face for a fleeting instant. She slipped the gun back
  into its holster.</p>

  <p>"And now suppose we go down the hill and get your hoss?"</p>

  <p>Evidently he was painfully eager to get the dead man out of sight. Yet he
  paused while he picked up her saddle.</p>

  <p>"They'll be along pretty pronto&mdash;the sheriff and his men. They'll
  take care of&mdash;him."</p>

  <p>Leading the way down to her hobbled horse he saddled it swiftly, while she
  stood aside and watched. When he was done he turned to her.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we better be starting. It wouldn't come in very handy for Kern to
  find us here, eh?"</p>

  <p>Obediently she came. With one hand he held the stirrup, while the other
  steadied her weight by the elbow, as she raised her foot. In spite of herself
  she shivered at his touch. A moment later, from the saddle, she was looking
  down into a darkly crimsoned face. Plainly he had understood that impulse of
  aversion, but he said nothing.</p>

  <p>There was a low neigh from the other side of the hill in answer to his
  soft whistle, and then out of the trees came a beautifully formed roan mare,
  with high head and pricking ears. With mincing steps she went straight to her
  master, and Jig saw the face of the other brighten. But he was gloomy again
  by the time he had swung into the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "where away?"</p>

  <p>"You're coming with me?" she asked, with a new touch of alarm. She
  regretted her tone the moment she had spoken. She saw Arizona wince.</p>

  <p>"Lady," he said, "suppose I come clean to you? I been in my time about
  everything that's bad. I ain't done a killing except squarely. Sinclair
  taught me that. And you got to allow that what I done to Sandersen was after
  I give him all the advantage in the draw. I took even chances, and I give him
  better than an even break. Ain't that correct?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, fascinated by the struggle in his face between pride and shame
  and anger.</p>

  <p>"Worse'n that," he went on, forcing out the bitter truth. "I been
  everything down to a sharp with the cards, which is tolerable low. But I got
  this to say: I'm playing clean with you. I'll prove it before I'm done. If
  you want me to break loose and leave you alone, say the word, and I'm gone.
  If you want me to stay and help where I can help, say the word, and I stay
  and take orders. Come out with it!"</p>

  <p>Gathering his reins, he sat very straight and looked her fairly and
  squarely in the eye, for the first time since he had discovered the truth
  about Cold Feet. In spite of herself Jig found that she was drawn to trust
  the fat man. She let a smile grow, let her glance become as level and as
  straight as his own. She reined her horse beside his and stretched out her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I know you mean what you say," said Jig. "And I don't care what you have
  been in the past. I <i>do</i> need a friend&mdash;desperately. Riley Sinclair
  says that a friend is the most sacred thing in the world. I don't ask that
  much, but of all the men I know you are the only one who can help me as I
  need to be helped. Will you shake hands for a new start between us?"</p>

  <p>"Lady," said the cowpuncher huskily, "this sure means a lot to me. And
  the&mdash;other things&mdash;you'll forget?"</p>

  <p>"I never knew you," said the girl, smiling at him again, "until this
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's a go!" cried Arizona. "Now try me out!"</p>

  <p>Jig saw his self-respect come back to him, saw his eye grow bright and
  clear. Arizona was like a man with a new "good resolution." He wanted to test
  his strength and astonish someone with his change.</p>

  <p>"There is one great thing in which I need help," she said.</p>

  <p>"Good! And what's that?"</p>

  <p>"Riley Sinclair is in jail."</p>

  <p>"H'm," muttered Arizona. "He ain't in on a serious charge. Let him stay a
  while." Stiffening in the saddle he stared at her. "Does Sinclair know?"</p>

  <p>"What?" asked the girl, but she flushed in spite of herself.</p>

  <p>"That you ain't a man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>For a moment he considered her crimson face gloomily. "You and Sinclair
  was sort of pals, I guess," he said at length.</p>

  <p>Faintly she replied in the affirmative, and her secret was written as
  clearly as sunlight on her face. Yet she kept her eyes raised bravely.</p>

  <p>As for Arizona, the newborn hope died in him, and then flickered back to
  an evil life. If Sinclair was in his way, why give up? Why not remove this
  obstacle as he had removed others in his time. The hurrying voice of the girl
  broke in on his somber thoughts.</p>

  <p>"He went to Sour Creek to help me as soon as he found out that I was not a
  man. He put himself in terrible danger there on my account."</p>

  <p>"Did Cartwright have something to do with you and him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>But Arizona made no effort to read her riddle.</p>

  <p>She went on: "Now that he has been taken, I know what has happened. To
  keep me out of danger he told&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you're a woman?"</p>

  <p>"No, he wouldn't do that, because he knows that is the last thing in the
  world that I want revealed. But he's told them that he killed Quade, and now
  he's in danger of his life."</p>

  <p>"Let's ride on," said Arizona. "I got to think a pile."</p>

  <p>She did not speak, while the horses wound down the steep side of the
  mountain. Mile after mile rose behind them. The sun increased in power,
  flashing on the leaves of the trees and beginning to burn the face with its
  slanting heat. Now and then she ventured a side-glance at Arizona, and always
  she found him in a brown study. Vaguely she knew that he was fighting the old
  battle of good and evil in the silence of the morning. Finally he stopped his
  horse and turned to her again.</p>

  <p>They were in the foothills by this time, and they had drawn out from the
  trees to a little level space on the top of a rise. The morning mist was
  thinning rapidly in the heart of the hollow beneath them. Far off, they heard
  the lowing of cows being driven into the pasture land after the morning
  milking, and they could make out tiny figures in the fields.</p>

  <p>"Lady," Arizona was saying to her, "they's one gent in the world that I've
  got an eight-year-old grudge agin'. I've swore to get him sooner or later,
  and that gent is Riley Sinclair. Make it something else, and I'll work for
  you till the skin's off my hands. But Sinclair&mdash;" He stopped, studying
  her intently. "Will you tell me one thing? How much does Sinclair mean to
  you."</p>

  <p>"A great deal," said the girl gently. "But if you hate him, I can't ask
  you."</p>

  <p>"He's a hard man," said Arizona, "and he's got a mean name, lady. You know
  that. But when you say that he means a lot to you, maybe it's because he's
  taken a big chance for you in Sour Creek and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "It's more than that&mdash;much more."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I understand," said Arizona.</p>

  <p>Burying the last of his hopes, Arizona looked straight into the sun.</p>

  <p>"Eight years ago he was a better man than I am," said he at length. "And
  he's a better man still. Lady, I'm going to get Riley Sinclair free!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30"></a>CHAPTER 30</h2>

  <p class="first">As Arizona had predicted, Sheriff Kern was greatly tempted
  not to start on the hard ride for the mountains before morning, and finally
  he followed his impulse. With the first break of the dawn he was up, and a
  few minutes later he had taken the trail alone. There was no need of numbers,
  for that matter, to tell a single man that he no longer need dread the law.
  But it was only common decency to inform him of the charge, and Kern was a
  decent sort.</p>

  <p>He was thoughtful on the trail. A great many things had happened to upset
  the sheriff. The capture of Sinclair, take it all in all, was an important
  event. To be sure, the chief glory was attributable to the cunning of
  Arizona; nevertheless, the community was sure to pay homage to the skill of
  the sheriff who had led the party and managed the capture.</p>

  <p>But now the sheriff found himself regretting the capture and all its
  attendant glory. Not even a personal grudge against the man who had taken his
  first prisoner from him, could give an edge to the sheriff's satisfaction,
  for, during the late hours of the preceding night he had heard from Sinclair
  the true story of the killing of Quade; not a murder, but a fair fight. And
  he had heard more&mdash;the whole unhappy tale which began with the death of
  Hal Sinclair in the desert, a story which now included, so far as the sheriff
  knew, three deaths, with a promise of another in the future.</p>

  <p>It was little wonder that he was disturbed. His philosophy was of the kind
  that is built up in a country of horses, hard riding, hard work, hard
  fighting. According to the precepts of that philosophy, Sinclair would have
  shirked a vital moral duty had he failed to avenge the pitiful death of his
  brother.</p>

  <p>The sheriff put himself into the boots of the man who was now his prisoner
  and facing a sentence of death. In that man's place he knew that he would
  have taken the same course. It was a matter of necessary principle; and the
  sheriff also knew that no jury in the country could allow Sinclair to go
  free. It might not be the death sentence, but it would certainly be a prison
  term as bad as death.</p>

  <p>These thoughts consumed the time for the sheriff until his horse had
  labored up the height, and he came to the little plateau where so much had
  happened outside of his ken. And there he saw Bill Sandersen, with the all-
  seeing sun on his dead eyes.</p>

  <p>For a moment the sheriff could not believe what he saw. Sandersen was, in
  the phrase of the land, "Sinclair's meat." It suddenly seemed to him that
  Sinclair must have broken from jail and done this killing during the night.
  But a moment's reflection assured him that this could not be. The mind of the
  sheriff whirled. Not Sinclair, certainly. The man had been dead for some
  hours. In the sky, far above and to the north, there were certain black
  specks, moving in great circles that drifted gradually south. The buzzards
  were already coming to the dead. He watched them for a moment, with the
  sinking of the heart which always comes to the man of the mountain desert
  when he sees those grim birds.</p>

  <p>It was not Sinclair. But who, then?</p>

  <p>He examined the body and the wound. It was a center shot, nicely placed.
  Certainly not the sort of shot that Cold Feet, according to the description
  which Sinclair had given of the latter's marksmanship, would be apt to make.
  But there was no other conclusion to come to. Cold Feet had certainly been
  here according to Sinclair's confession, and it was certainly reasonable to
  suppose that Cold Feet had committed this crime. The sheriff placed the hat
  of Sinclair over his face and swung back into his saddle; he must hurry back
  to Sour Creek and send up a burial party, for no one would have an interest
  in interring the body in the town.</p>

  <p>But once in the saddle he paused again. The thought of the schoolteacher
  having killed so formidable a fighter as Sandersen stuck in his mind as a
  thing too contrary to probability. Moreover the sheriff had grown extremely
  cautious. He had made one great failure very recently&mdash;the escape of
  this same Cold Feet. He would have failed again had it not been for Arizona.
  He shuddered at the thought of how his reputation would have been ruined had
  he gone on the trail and allowed Sinclair to double back to Sour Creek and
  take the town by surprise.</p>

  <p>Dismounting, he threw his reins and went back to review the scene of the
  killing. There were plenty of tracks around the place. The gravel obscured a
  great part of the marks, and still other prints were blurred by the dead
  grass. But there were pockets of rich, loamy soil, moist enough and firm
  enough to take an impression as clearly as paper takes ink. The sheriff
  removed the right shoe from the foot of Sandersen and made a series of fresh
  prints.</p>

  <p>They were quite distinctive. The heel was turned out to such an extent
  that the track was always a narrow indentation, where the heel fell on the
  soft soil. He identified the same tracks in many places, and, dismissing the
  other tracks, the sheriff proceeded to make up a trail history for
  Sandersen.</p>

  <p>Here he came up the hill, on foot. Here he paused beside the embers of the
  fire and remained standing for a long time, for the marks were worked in
  deeply. After a time the trail went&mdash;he followed it with difficulty over
  the hard-packed gravel&mdash;up the side of the hill to a semicircular
  arrangement of rocks, and there, distinct in the soil, was the impression of
  the body, where the cowpuncher had lain down. The sheriff lay down in turn,
  and at once he was sure why Sandersen had chosen this spot. He was defended
  perfectly on three sides from bullets, and in the meantime, through crevices
  in the rock, he maintained a clear outlook over the whole side of the
  hill.</p>

  <p>Obviously Sandersen had lain down to keep watch. For what? For Cold Feet,
  of course, on whose head a price rested. Or, at least, so Sinclair must have
  believed at the time. The news had not yet been published abroad that Cold
  Feet had been exculpated by the confession of Sinclair to the killing of
  Quade.</p>

  <p>So much was clear. But presently Sandersen had risen and gone down the
  hill again, leaving from the other side of the rock. Had he covered Cold Feet
  when the latter returned to his camp, having been absent when Sandersen first
  arrived? No, the tracks down the hill were leisurely, not the long strides
  which a man would make to get close to one whom he had covered with a
  revolver from a distance.</p>

  <p>Reaching the shoulder of the mountain, Kern puzzled anew. He began a fresh
  study of the tracks. Those of Cold Feet were instantly known by the tiny size
  of the marks of the soles. The sheriff remembered that he had often wondered
  at the smallness of the schoolteacher's feet. Cold Feet was there, and
  Sandersen was dead. Again it seemed certain that Cold Feet had been guilty of
  the crime, but the sheriff kept on systematically hunting for new evidence.
  He found no third set of tracks for some time, but when he did find them,
  they were very clear&mdash;a short, broad foot, the imprint of a heavy man. A
  fat man, then, no doubt. From the length of the footprint it was very
  doubtful if the man were tall, and certainly by the clearness of the
  indentation, the man was heavy. The sheriff could tell by making a track
  beside that of the quarry.</p>

  <p>A second possibility, therefore, had entered, and the sheriff felt a
  reasonable conviction that this must be the guilty man.</p>

  <p>Now he combed the whole area for some means of identifying the third man
  who had been on the mountainside. But nothing had been dropped except a
  brilliant bandanna, wadded compactly together, which the sheriff recognized
  as belonging to Sandersen. There was only one definite means of recognizing
  the third man. Very faint in the center of the impression made by his sole,
  were two crossed arrows, the sign of the bootmaker.</p>

  <p>The sheriff shook his head. Could he examine the soles of the boots of
  every man in the vicinity of Sour Creek, even if he limited his inquiry to
  those who were short and stocky? And might there not be many a man who wore
  the same type of boots?</p>

  <p>He flung himself gloomily into his saddle again, and this time he headed
  straight down the trail for Sour Creek.</p>

  <p>At the hotel he was surrounded by an excited knot of people who wished to
  know how he had extracted the amazing confession from Riley Sinclair. The
  sheriff tore himself away from a dozen hands who wished to buttonhole him in
  close conversation.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you gents this," he said. "Quade was killed because he needed
  killing, and Sinclair confessed because he's straight."</p>

  <p>With that, casting an ugly glance at the lot of them, he went back into
  the kitchen and demanded a cup of coffee. The Chinese cook obeyed the order
  in a hurry, highly flattered and not a little nervous at the presence of the
  great man in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>While Kern was there, Arizona entered. The sheriff greeted him cheerfully,
  with his coffee cup balanced in one hand.</p>

  <p>"Arizona," he said, "or Dago, or whatever you like to be called
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cut the Dago part, will you?" demanded Arizona. "I ain't no ways wishing
  to be reminded of that name. Nobody calls me that."</p>

  <p>Kern grinned covertly.</p>

  <p>"I s'pose," said Arizona slowly, "that you and Sinclair had a long yarn
  about when he knew me some time back?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Between you and me," he said frankly, "it sounded to me like Sinclair
  knew something you mightn't want to have noised around. Is that
  straight?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," answered the other. "When I was a kid I was a fool kid.
  That's all it amounts to."</p>

  <p>Sheriff Kern grunted. "All right, Arizona, I ain't asking. But you can lay
  to it that Sinclair won't talk. He's as straight as ever I seen!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Arizona, "but he's slippery. And I got this to say: Lemme
  have the watch over Sinclair while he's in Sour Creek, or are you taking him
  back to Woodville today?"</p>

  <p>"I'm held over," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>He paused. Twice the little olive-skinned man from the south had
  demonstrated his superiority in working out criminal puzzles. The sheriff was
  prone to unravel the new mystery by himself, if he might.</p>

  <p>"By what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, by something I'll tell you about later on," said the sheriff. "It
  don't amount to much, but I want to look into it."</p>

  <p>Purposely he had delayed sending the party to bury Sandersen. It would be
  simply warning the murderer if that man were in Sour Creek.</p>

  <p>"About you and Sinclair," went on the sheriff, "there ain't much good
  feeling between you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I won't shoot him in the back if I guard him," declared Arizona. "But if
  you want one of the other boys to take the jog, go ahead. Put Red on it."</p>

  <p>"He's too young. Sinclair's get him off guard by talking."</p>

  <p>"Then try Wood."</p>

  <p>"Wood ain't at his best off the trail. Come to think about it, I'd rather
  trust Sinclair to you&mdash;that is, if you make up your mind to treat him
  square."</p>

  <p>"Sheriff, I'll give him a squarer deal than you think."</p>

  <p>Kern nodded.</p>

  <p>"More coffee, Li!" he called.</p>

  <p>Li obeyed with such haste that he overbrimmed the cup, and some of the
  liquid washed out of the saucer onto the floor.</p>

  <p>"Coming back to shop talk," went on the sheriff, as Li mopped up the
  spilled coffee, mumbling excuses, "I ain't had a real chance to tell you what
  a fine job you done for us last night, Arizona."</p>

  <p>Arizona, with due modesty, waved the praise away and stepped to the
  container of matches hanging beside the stove. He came back lighting a
  cigarette and contentedly puffed out a great cloud.</p>

  <p>"Forget all that, sheriff, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Not if I live to be a hundred," answered the sheriff with frank
  admiration.</p>

  <p>So saying, his eye dropped to the floor and remained there, riveted. The
  foot of Arizona had rested on the spot where the coffee had fallen. The print
  was clearly marked with dust, except that in the center, where the sole had
  lain, there was a sharply defined pair of crossed arrows!</p>

  <p>A short, fat, heavy man.</p>

  <p>The sheriff raised his glance and examined the bulky shoulders of the man.
  Then he hastily swallowed the rest of his coffee.</p>

  <p>Yet there might be a dozen other short, stocky men in town, whose boots
  had the same impression. He looked thoughtfully out the kitchen window,
  striving to remember some clue. But, as far as he could make out, the only
  time Arizona and Sandersen had crossed had been when the latter applied for a
  place on the posse. Surely a small thing to make a man commit a murder!</p>

  <p>"If you gimme the job of guarding Sinclair," said Arizona, "I'd sure
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," cut in the sheriff. "I'll be back right away. I think
  that was MacKenzie who went into the stable. Don't leave till I come back,
  Arizona."</p>

  <p>Hurriedly he went out. There was no MacKenzie in the stable, and the
  sheriff did not look for one. He went straight to Arizona's horse. The roan
  was perfectly dry, but examining the hide, the sheriff saw that the horse had
  been recently groomed, and a thorough grooming would soon dry the hair and
  remove all traces of a long ride.</p>

  <p>Stepping back to the peg from which the saddle hung, he raised the stirrup
  leather. On the inside, where the leather had chafed the side of the horse,
  there was a dirty gray coating, the accumulation of the dust and sweat of
  many a ride. But it was soft with recent sweat, and along the edges of the
  leather there was a barely dried line of foam that rubbed away readily under
  the touch of his fingertip.</p>

  <p>Next he examined the bridle. There, also, were similar evidences of recent
  riding. The sheriff returned calmly to the kitchen of the hotel.</p>

  <p>"And your mind's made up?" asked Arizona.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the sheriff. "You go in with Sinclair."</p>

  <p>"Go <i>in</i> with him?" asked Arizona, baffled.</p>

  <p>"For murder," said the sheriff. "Stick up your hands, Arizona!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31"></a>CHAPTER 31</h2>

  <p class="first">Even though he was taken utterly by surprise, habit made
  Arizona go for his own gun, as the sheriff whipped out his weapon. But under
  those conditions he was beaten badly to the draw. Before his weapon was half
  out of the holster, the sheriff had the drop.</p>

  <p>Arizona paused, but, for a moment, his eyes fought Kern, figuring chances.
  It was only the hesitation of an instant. The battle was lost before it had
  begun, and Arizona was clever enough to know it. Swiftly he turned on a new
  tack. He shoved his revolver back into the holster and smiled benevolently on
  the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"What's the new game, Kern?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't new," said the sheriff joylessly. "It's about the oldest game in
  the world. Arizona, you sure killed Sandersen."</p>

  <p>"Sandersen?" Arizona laughed. "Why, man, I ain't hardly seen him more than
  once. How come that I would kill him?"</p>

  <p>"Get your hands up, Arizona."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure." He obeyed with apparent willingness. "But don't let anybody
  see you making this fool play, sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not so foolish. I'll tell you why you killed him. You're broke,
  Arizona. Ten days ago Mississippi Slim cleaned you out at dice. Well, when
  Sinclair told me where Cold Feet was, you listened through the door, but you
  didn't stay to find out that Jig wasn't wanted no more. You beat it up to the
  mountain, and there you found Sandersen was ahead of your time. You drilled
  Sandersen, hoping to throw the blame on Cold Feet. Then you come down, but on
  the way Cold Feet gives you the slip and gets away. And that's why you're
  here."</p>

  <p>Arizona blinked. So much of this tale was true that it shook even his iron
  nerve. He managed to smile.</p>

  <p>"That's a wild yarn, sheriff. D'you think it'll go down with a jury?"</p>

  <p>"It'll go down with any jury around these parts. What's more, Arizona, I
  ain't going to rest on what I think. I'm going to find out. And, if I send
  down to the south inquiring about you, I got an idea that I'll find out
  enough to hang ten like you, eh?"</p>

  <p>Once more Arizona received a vital blow, and he winced under the impact.
  Moreover, he was bewildered. His own superior intelligence had inclined him
  to despise the sheriff, whom he put down as a fellow of more bulldog power
  than mental agility. All in a moment it was being borne in upon him that he
  had underrated his man. He could not answer. His smooth tongue was
  chained.</p>

  <p>"Not that I got any personal grudge agin' you," went on the sheriff, "but
  it's gents like you that I'm after, Arizona, and not one like Sinclair. You
  ain't clean, Arizona. You're slick, and they ain't elbowroom enough in the
  West for slick gents. Besides, you got a bad way with your gun. I can tell
  you this, speaking private and confidential, I'm going to hang you, Arizona,
  if there's any way possible!"</p>

  <p>He said all this quietly, but the revolver remained poised with rocklike
  firmness. He drew out a pair of manacles.</p>

  <p>"Stand up, Arizona."</p>

  <p>Listlessly the fat man got up. He had been changing singularly during the
  last speech of the sheriff. Now he dropped a hand on the edge of the table,
  as if to support himself. The sheriff saw that hand grip the wood until the
  knuckles went white. Arizona moistened his colorless lips.</p>

  <p>"Not the irons, sheriff," he said softly. "Not them!"</p>

  <p>If it had been any other man, Kern would have imagined that he was losing
  his nerve; but he knew Arizona, had seen him in action, and he was certain
  that his courage was above question. Consequently he was amazed. As certainly
  as he had ever seen them exposed, these were the horrible symptoms of
  cowardice that make a brave man shudder to see.</p>

  <p>"Can't trust you," he said wonderingly. "Wouldn't trust you a minute,
  Arizona, without the irons on you. You're a bad actor, son, and I've seen you
  acting up. Don't forget that."</p>

  <p>"Sheriff, I give you my word that I'll go quiet as a lamb."</p>

  <p>A moment elapsed before Kern could answer, for the voice of Arizona had
  trembled as he spoke. The sheriff could not believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sorry, Arizona," he said more gently, because he was striving
  to banish this disgusting suspicion from his own mind. "I can't take no
  chances. Just turn around, will you. And keep them hands up!"</p>

  <p>He barked the last words, for the arms of Arizona had crooked suddenly.
  They stiffened at the sharp command of the sheriff. Slowly, trembling, as if
  they possessed a volition of their own hardly controlled by the fat man,
  those hands fought their way back to their former position, and then Arizona
  gradually turned his back on the sheriff. A convulsive shudder ran through
  him as Kern removed his gun and then seized one of the raised hands, drew it
  down, and fastened one part of the iron on it. The other hand followed, and,
  as the sheriff snapped the lock, he saw a singular transformation in the
  figure of his captive. The shoulders of Arizona slouched forward, his head
  sank. From the erect, powerful figure of the moment before, he became, in
  comparison, a flabby pile of flesh, animated by no will.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked the sheriff. "You ain't lost your nerve, have
  you, Fatty?"</p>

  <p>Arizona did not answer. Kern stepped to one side and glanced at the face
  of his captive. It was strangely altered. The mouth had become trembling,
  loose, uncertain. The head had fallen, and the bright, keen eyes were dull.
  The man looked up with darting side-glances.</p>

  <p>The sheriff stood back and wiped a sudden perspiration from his forehead.
  Under his very eyes the spirit of this gunfighter was disintegrating. The
  sheriff felt a cold shame pour through him. He wanted to hide this man from
  the eyes of the others. It was not right that he should be seen. His weakness
  was written too patently.</p>

  <p>Kern was no psychologist, but he knew that some men out of their peculiar
  element are like fish out of water. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Walk out that back door, will you?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>"We ain't going down the street?" demanded Arizona.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, sheriff."</p>

  <p>Again Kern shuddered, swallowed, and then commanded: "Start along,
  Arizona."</p>

  <p>Slinking through the door, the fat man hesitated on the little porch and
  cast a quick glance up and down.</p>

  <p>"No one near!" he said. "Hurry up, sheriff."</p>

  <p>Quickly they skirted down behind the houses&mdash;not unseen, however. A
  small boy playing behind his father's house raised his head to watch the
  hurrying pair, and when he saw the glitter of the irons, they heard him gasp.
  He was old enough to know the meaning of that. Irons on Arizona, who had been
  a town hero the night before! They saw the youngster dart around the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Blast him!" groaned Arizona. "He'll spread it everywhere. Hurry!"</p>

  <p>He was right. The sheriff hurried with a will, but, as they crossed the
  street for the door of the jail, voices blew down to them. Looking toward the
  hotel, they saw men pouring out into the street, pointing, shouting to one
  another. Then they swept down on the pair.</p>

  <p>But the sheriff and his prisoner gained the door of the jail first, and
  Kern locked it behind him. His deputy on guard rose with a start, and at the
  same time there was a hurried knocking on the door and a clamor of voices
  without. Arizona shrank away from that sound, scowling over his shoulder, but
  the sheriff nodded good-humoredly.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy, Arizona. I ain't going to make a show of you!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, that's like you, sheriff," said a hurried, half-whining voice.
  "You're square. I'll sure show you one of these days now I appreciate the way
  you treat me!"</p>

  <p>Kern was staggered. It seemed to him that a new personality had taken
  possession of the body of the fat man. He led the way past his gaping deputy.
  The jail was not constructed for a crowd. It was merely a temporary abiding
  place before prisoners were taken to the larger institution at Woodville.
  Consequently there was only one big cell. The sheriff unlocked the door,
  slipped the manacles from the wrists of Arizona, and jabbed the muzzle of a
  revolver into his back!</p>

  <p>The last act was decidedly necessary, for the moment his wrists were
  released from the grip of the steel, Arizona twitched halfway round toward
  the sheriff. The scrape of the gunmuzzle against his ribs, however, convinced
  him. Over his shoulder he cast one murderous glance at the sheriff and then
  slouched forward into the cell.</p>

  <p>"Company for you, Riley," said the sheriff, as the tall cowpuncher
  rose.</p>

  <p>The other's back was turned, and thereby the sheriff was enabled to pass a
  significant gesture and look to Sinclair. With that he left them. In the
  outer room he found his deputy much alarmed.</p>

  <p>"You ain't turned them two in together?" he asked. "Why, Sinclair'll kill
  that gent in about a minute. Ain't it Arizona that nailed him?"</p>

  <p>"Sinclair will play square," Kern insisted, "and Arizona won't fight!"</p>

  <p>Leaving the other to digest these mysterious tidings, the sheriff went out
  to disperse the crowd.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Sinclair had received the newcomer in perfect silence, his
  head raised high, his thin mouth set in an Ugly line&mdash;very much as an
  eagle might receive an owl which floundered by mistake onto the same crag,
  far above his element. The eagle hesitated between scorn of the visitor and a
  faint desire to pounce on him and rend him to pieces. That glittering eye,
  however, was soon dull with wonder, when he watched the actions of
  Arizona.</p>

  <p>The fat man paused in the center of the cell, regarded Sinclair with a
  single flash of the eyes, and then glanced uneasily from side to side. That
  done, he slipped away to a corner and slouched down on a stool, his head bent
  down on his breast.</p>

  <p>Apparently he had fallen into a profound reverie, but Sinclair found that
  the eyes of Arizona continually whipped up and across to him. Once the
  newcomer shifted his position a little, and Sinclair saw him test the weight
  of the stool beneath him with his hand. Even in the cell Arizona had found a
  weapon.</p>

  <p>Gradually Sinclair understood the meaning of that glance and the gesture
  of the sheriff, as the latter left; he read other things in the gray pallor
  of Arizona, and in the fallen head. The man was unnerved. Sinclair's reaction
  was very much what that of the sheriff had been&mdash;a sinking of the heart
  and a momentary doubt of himself. But he was something more of a philosopher
  than Kern. He had seen more of life and men and put two and two together.</p>

  <p>One thing stared him plainly in the face. The Arizona who skulked in the
  corner had relapsed eight years. He was the same sneak thief whom Sinclair
  had first met in the lumber camp, and he knew instinctively that this was the
  first time since that unpleasant episode that Arizona had been cornered. The
  loathing left Sinclair, and in its place came pity. He had no fondness of
  Arizona, but he had seen him in the role of a strong man, which made the
  contrast more awful. It reminded Sinclair of the wild horse which loses its
  spirit when it is broken. Such was Arizona. Free to come and go, he had been
  a danger. Shut up helplessly in a cell, he was as feeble as a child, and his
  only strength was a sort of cunning malice. Sinclair turned quietly to the
  fat man.</p>

  <p>"Arizona," he said, "you look sort of underfed today. Bring your stool a
  bit nearer and let's talk. I been hungry for a chat with someone."</p>

  <p>In reply Arizona rolled back his head and for a moment glared thoughtfully
  at Sinclair. He made no answer. Presently his glance fell, like that of a
  dog. Sinclair shivered. He tried brutality.</p>

  <p>"Looks to me, Arizona, as though you'd lost your nerve."</p>

  <p>The other moistened his lips, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"But the point is," said the tall cowpuncher, "that you've given up before
  you're beaten."</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair's words brought a flash from Arizona, a sudden lifting of
  the head, as if he had not before thought of hoping. Then he began to slump
  back into his former position, without a reply. Sinclair followed his opening
  advantage at once.</p>

  <p>"What you in for?"</p>

  <p>"Murder!"</p>

  <p>"Great guns! Of whom?"</p>

  <p>"Sandersen."</p>

  <p>It brought Sinclair stiffly to his feet. Sandersen! His trail was ended;
  Hal was avenged at last!</p>

  <p>"And you done it? Fatty, you took that job out of my hands. I'm thanking
  you. Besides, it ain't nothing to be downhearted about. Sandersen was a
  skunk. Can they prove it on you?"</p>

  <p>The need to talk overwhelmed Arizona. It burst out of him, not to
  Sinclair, but rather at him. His shifting eyes made sure that no one was
  near.</p>

  <p>"Kern is going to send south for the dope. I'm done for. They can hang me
  three times on what they'll learn, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," snapped Sinclair. "Don't talk foolish. The south is a tolerable
  big place to send to. They don't know where you come from. Take 'em a month
  to find out, and by that time, you won't be at hand."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Because you and me are going to bust out of this paper jail they
  got!"</p>

  <p>He had not the slightest hope of escape. But he tried the experiment of
  that suggestion merely to see what the fat man's reaction would be. The
  result was more than he could have dreamed. Arizona whirled on him with eyes
  ablaze.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean, Sinclair?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I say. D'you think they can keep two like us in here? No, not
  if you come to your old self."</p>

  <p>The need to confide again fell on Arizona. He dragged his stool nearer.
  His voice was a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair, something's busted in me. When them irons grabbed my arms they
  took everything out of me. I got no chance. They got me cornered."</p>

  <p>"And you'll fight like a wildcat to the end of things. Sure you will! Buck
  up, man! You think you've turned yaller. You ain't. You're just out of place.
  Take a gent that's used to a forty-foot rope and a pony, give him sixty feet
  on a sixteen-hand hoss, and ain't he out of place? Sure! He looks like a
  clumsy fool. And the other way around it works the same way. A trout may be a
  flash of light in water, but on dry land he ain't worth a damn. Same way with
  you, Fatty. While you got a free foot you're all right, but when they put you
  behind a wall and say they're going to keep you there, you darned near bust
  down. Why? Because it looks to you like you ain't got a chance to fight back.
  So you quit altogether. But you'll come back to yourself, Arizona. You
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>Arizona raised his hand. He was sitting erect now, drinking in the words
  of Sinclair, as if they were air to a stifling man. His face worked.</p>

  <p>"Why are you doing this for me, Sinclair&mdash;after I landed you
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Because I made a man out of you once," answered the tall man evenly, "and
  I ain't going to see you backslide. Why, Arizona, you're one of the
  fastest-thinkin', quickest-handed gents that ever buckled on a gun, and here
  you are lying down like a kid that ain't never faced trouble before. Come
  alive, man. You and me are going to bust this ol' jail to smithereens, and
  when we get outside I'll blow your head off if I can!"</p>

  <p>Riley's words had carried Arizona with him. Suddenly an olive-skinned hand
  shot out and clutched his own bony, strong fingers. The hand was fat and
  cold, but it gripped that of Riley Sinclair with a desperate energy.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair, you mean it? You'll play in with me?"</p>

  <p>"I will&mdash;sure!"</p>

  <p>He had to drag the words out, but after he had spoken he was glad. New
  life shone in the face of Arizona.</p>

  <p>"A man with you for a partner ain't done, Sinclair&mdash;not if he had a
  rope around his neck. Listen! D'you know why I come in town?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"To get you out."</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Arizona," lied Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Not for your sake&mdash;but hers."</p>

  <p>Sinclair's face suddenly went white.</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"The girl!" whispered Arizona. "I cached her away outside of town to wait
  for&mdash;us! Sinclair, she loves you."</p>

  <p>Riley Sinclair sat as one stunned and dragged the hat from his head.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32"></a>CHAPTER 32</h2>

  <p class="first">Through the branches of the copse in which she was hidden,
  the girl saw the sun descend in the west, a streak of slowly dropping fire.
  And now she became excited.</p>

  <p>"As soon as it's dark," Arizona had promised, "I'll make my start. Have
  your hoss ready. Be in the saddle, and the minute you see us come down that
  trail out of Sour Creek, be ready to feed your hoss the spur and join us,
  because when we come, we'll come fast. Don't make no mistake. If you ride too
  slow we'll have to ride slow, too, and slow ridin' means gunplay on both
  sides, and gunplay means dead men, because the evenin' is a pile worse nor
  the dark for fooling a man's aim. You'll see me and Sinclair scoot along that
  there road, with the gang yellin' behind us!"</p>

  <p>Having made this farewell speech, he waved his hand and, with a smile of
  confidence, jogged away from her. It was the beginning of a dull day of
  waiting for her, yet a day in which she dared not altogether relax her
  vigilance, because at any time the break might come, and Arizona might appear
  flying down the trail with the familiar tall form of Sinclair beside him.
  Wearily she waited until sundown.</p>

  <p>With the coming of dusk she wakened suddenly and became tinglingly alert.
  The night spread rapidly down out of the mountains. The color faded, and the
  sudden chill of the high altitude settled about her. Her hands and her feet
  were cold with the fear of excitement.</p>

  <p>Into the gathering gloom she strained her eyes; toward Sour Creek she
  strained her ears, starting at every faint sound of a man's shout or the
  barking of a dog, as if this might be the beginning of the uproar that would
  announce the escape.</p>

  <p>Something swung on to the road out of the end of the main street. She was
  instantly in the saddle, but, by the time she reached the edge of the copse,
  she found it to be only a wagon filled with singing men going back to some
  nearby ranch. Then quiet dropped over the valley, and she became aware that
  it was the utter dark.</p>

  <p>Arizona had failed! That knowledge grew more surely upon her with every
  moment. His intention must have been guessed, for she could not imagine that
  slippery and cold-minded fellow being thwarted, if he were left free to work
  as he pleased toward an object he desired. She could not stay in the grove
  all night. Besides, this was the critical time for Riley Sinclair. Tomorrow
  he would be taken to the security of the Woodville jail, and the end would be
  close. If anything were done for him, it must be before morning.</p>

  <p>With this thought in mind she rode boldly out of the trees and took the
  road into town, where the lights of the early evening had turned from white
  to yellow, as the night deepened. Sour Creek was hardly a mile away when a
  rattling in the dark announced the approach of a buckboard. She drew rein at
  the side of the trail. Suddenly the wagon loomed out at her, with two down-
  headed horses jogging along and the loose reins swinging above their
  backs.</p>

  <p>"Halloo!" called Jig.</p>

  <p>The brakes ground against the wheels, squeaking in protest. The horses
  came to a halt so willing and sudden that the collars shoved halfway up their
  necks, and the tongue of the wagon lurched beyond their noses.</p>

  <p>"Whoa! Evening, there! You gimme a kind of a start, stranger."</p>

  <p>Parodying the dialect as well as she was able, Jig said: "Sorry, stranger.
  Might that be Sour Creek?"</p>

  <p>"It sure might be," said the driver, leaning through the dark to make out
  Jig. "New in these parts?"</p>

  <p>"Yep, I'm over from Whiteacre way, and I'm aiming for Woodville."</p>

  <p>"Whiteacre? Doggone me if it ain't good to meet a Whiteacre boy. I was
  raised there, son! Joe Lunids is my name."</p>

  <p>"I'm Texas Lou," said the girl.</p>

  <p>There was a subdued chuckle from the darkness.</p>

  <p>"You sound kind of young for a name like that, kid. Leastwise, your voice
  is tolerable young."</p>

  <p>"I'm old enough," said Jig aggressively.</p>

  <p>"Sure, sure," placated the other. "Sure you are."</p>

  <p>"Besides," she went on, "I wanted a name that I could grow up to."</p>

  <p>It brought a hearty burst of laughter from the wagon.</p>

  <p>"That's a good one, Texas. Have a drink?"</p>

  <p>She set her teeth over the refusal that had come to her lips and, reining
  near, reached out for the flask. The driver passed over the bottle and at the
  same time lighted a match for the apparent purpose of starting his cigarette.
  But Jig nodded her head in time to obscure her face with the flopping brim of
  her sombrero. The other coughed his disappointment. She raised the bottle
  after uncorking it, firmly securing the neck with her thumb. After a moment
  she lowered it and sighed with satisfaction, as she had heard men do.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Jig, handing back the flask. "Hot stuff, partner."</p>

  <p>"You got a tough throat," observed the rancher. "First I ever see that
  didn't choke on a swig of that. But you youngsters has the advantage of a
  sound lining for your innards."</p>

  <p>He helped himself from the flask, coughed heavily, and then pounded home
  the cork.</p>

  <p>"How's things up Whiteacre way?"</p>

  <p>"Fair to middlin'," said Jig. "They ain't hollering for rain so much as
  they was."</p>

  <p>"I reckon not," agreed the rancher.</p>

  <p>"And how's things down Sour Creek way?" asked Jig.</p>

  <p>"Trouble busting every minute," said the other. "Murder, gun scrapes,
  brawls in the hotel&mdash;to beat anything I ever see. The town is sure going
  plumb to the dogs at this rate!"</p>

  <p>"You don't say! Well, I heard something about a gent named Quade being
  plugged."</p>

  <p>"Him? He was just the beginning&mdash;just the start! Since then we had a
  man took away from old Kern, which don't happen once in a coon's age. Then we
  had a fine fresh murder right this morning, and the present minute they's two
  in jail on murder charges, and both are sure to swing!"</p>

  <p>Jig gasped. "Two!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yep. They was a skinny schoolteacher named&mdash;I forget what. Most
  general he was called Cold Feet, which fitted. They thought he killed Quade
  account of a girl. But a gent named Sinclair up and confessed, and he is
  waiting for the rope. And then a sheriff all by himself grabbed Arizona for
  the murder of Sandersen. Oh, times is picking up considerable in Sour Creek.
  Reminds me of twenty years back before Kern come on the job and cleaned up
  the gunfighters!"</p>

  <p>"Two murders!" repeated the girl faintly. "And has Arizona confessed,
  too?"</p>

  <p>"Not him! But the sheriff has enough to give him a hard run. I got to be
  drifting on, son. Take my advice and head straight for Woodville. You lack
  five years of being old enough for Sour Creek these days!" He called his
  farewell, threw off the brake and cursed the span of horses into their former
  trot.</p>

  <p>As for Jig, she waited until the scent of alkali dust died away, and the
  rattle of the buckboard was faint in the distance. Then she turned her horse
  back toward Sour Creek and urged it to a steady gallop, bouncing in the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>There seemed a fatality about her. On her account Sinclair had thrown his
  life in peril, and now Arizona was caught and held in the same danger. Enough
  of sacrifices for her; her mind was firm to repay some of these services at
  any cost, and she had thought of a way.</p>

  <p>With that gloomy purpose before her, her ordinary timidity disappeared. It
  was strange to ride into Sour Creek, and she passed in review among the rough
  men of the town, constantly fearful that they might pierce her disguise. She
  had trained herself to a long stride and a swaggering demeanor, and by
  constant practice she had been able to lower the pitch of her voice and
  roughen its quality. Yet, in spite of the constant practice, she never had
  been able to gain absolute self-confidence. Tonight, however, there was no
  fear in her.</p>

  <p>She went straight to the hotel, threw the reins, and walked boldly through
  the door into a cluster of men. They yelled at the sight of her.</p>

  <p>"Jig, by guns! He's come in! Say, kid, the sheriff's been looking for
  you."</p>

  <p>They swerved around her, grinning good-naturedly. When a person has been
  almost lynched for a crime another has committed, he gains a certain
  standing, no matter what may be the public opinion of his courage. The
  schoolteacher had become a personage. But Jig met their smiles with a level
  eye.</p>

  <p>"If the sheriff's looking for me," she said, "tell him I have a room in
  the hotel. He can find me here."</p>

  <p>Pop shook hands before he shoved the register toward her. "My kids will
  sure be glad to see you safe back," he said. "And I'm glad, too, Jig."</p>

  <p>Nodding, she turned to sign her name in the bold, free hand which she had
  cultivated. She could feel the crowd staring behind her, and she could hear
  their murmurs. But she was not nervous. It seemed that all apprehension had
  left her.</p>

  <p>"Where's Cartwright?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sitting in a game of poker."</p>

  <p>"Hello, buddy!" she called to a redheaded youngster. "Go in and tell
  Cartwright that I'm waiting for him in my room, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't no use," said Pop, staring at this new and more masculine Jig.
  "Cartwright is all heated up about the game. And he's lost enough to get
  anybody excited. He won't come. Better go in there if you want to see
  him."</p>

  <p>"I'll try my luck this way," said Jig coldly. "Run along, buddy."</p>

  <p>Buddy obeyed, and Jig went up the stairs to her room.</p>

  <p>"What come over him?" asked the crowd, the moment Cold Feet was out of
  sight. "Looks like he's growed up in a day!"</p>

  <p>"He's gone through enough to make a man of him," answered Pop. "Never can
  tell how a kid will turn out."</p>

  <p>But in her room Jig had sunk into a chair, dropped her elbows on the
  table, and buried her face in her hands, trying to steady her thoughts. She
  heard the heavy pounding of feet on the stairs, a strong tread in the hall
  that made the flooring of the old building quiver, and then the door was
  flung open, slammed shut, and the key turned in the lock. Cartwright set his
  shoulders against the door, as though he feared she would try to rush past
  him. He stared at her, with a queer admixture of fear, rage, and
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"So I've got you at last, eh? I've got you, after all this?"</p>

  <p>Curiously she stared at him. She had dreaded the interview, but now that
  he was before her she was surprised to find that she felt no fear. She
  examined him as if from a distance.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "you have me. Will you sit down?"</p>

  <p>"I need room to talk," he said, swaggering to the table. He struck his
  fist on it. "Now, to start with, what in thunder did you mean by running
  away?"</p>

  <p>"We're leaving the past to bury the past," she said. "That's the first
  concession you have to make."</p>

  <p>He laughed, his laughter ending with a choked sound. "And why should
  <i>I</i> make concessions?"</p>

  <p>Jig watched the veins of fury swell in his forehead, watched calmly, and
  then threw her sombrero on the bed and smoothed back her hair, still watching
  without a change of expression. It seemed as if her calm acted to sober him,
  and the passing of her hand across the bright, silken hair all at once
  softened him. He sank into the opposite chair, leaning far across the table
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"Honey, take you all in all, you're prettier right here in this man's
  outfit that I ever see you&mdash;a pile prettier!"</p>

  <p>For a moment she closed her eyes. The sacrifice which she intended was
  becoming harder, desperately hard to make.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take you back and forgive you," said Cartwright, apparently
  blind to what was going on in her mind. "I ain't one to carry malice. You
  keep to the line from now on, and we'll get along fine. But you step crooked
  just once more, and I'll learn you a pile of things you never even dreamed
  could happen!"</p>

  <p>To her it seemed that he stood in a shaft of consuming light that exposed
  every shadowy nook and cranny of his nature, and the narrow-minded meanness
  that she saw, startled her.</p>

  <p>"What you do afterward with me is your own affair," she said. "It's about
  the present that I've come to bargain."</p>

  <p>"Bargain?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly! Do what I ask, and I go back and act as your wife. If you
  refuse, I walk out of your life forever."</p>

  <p>He could not speak for a moment. Then he exploded.</p>

  <p>"It's funny. I could almost laugh hearing you chatter crazy like this.
  Don't you think I got a right to make my own wife come home with me, now that
  I've found her? Wouldn't the law stand behind me?"</p>

  <p>"You can force me to come," she admitted quietly, "but if you do, I'll let
  the whole truth be known that I ran away from you. Can your pride stand that,
  Jude?"</p>

  <p>He writhed. "And how'll you get around that, even if I don't make you, and
  you come back of your own free will?"</p>

  <p>"Somehow I'll manage. I'll find a story of how I was carried away by half
  a dozen men who had come to loot the upper rooms of the house, while the
  wedding party was downstairs. I'll find a story that will wash."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you will," said Cartwright, breathing heavily. "I sure think
  you will. You was always a clever little devil, I know! But a bargain! I'd
  ought to&mdash;" He checked himself. "But I'm through with the black talk.
  When I get you back on the ranch I'll show you that you can be happy up
  there. And when you get over your fool notions, you'll be a wife to be proud
  of. Now, honey, tell me what you want?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to save the lives of two men. They're both in jail&mdash;on my
  account. And they're both charged with murder. You know whom I mean."</p>

  <p>Cartwright rose out of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair!" he groaned. "Curse him! Sinclair, ag'in, eh? What's they
  between you two?"</p>

  <p>Her answer smothered his fury again. It was pain that was giving her
  strength.</p>

  <p>"Jude, if you really want me to go back with you, don't ask that question.
  He has treated me as an honorable man always treats a woman&mdash; he tried
  to serve me."</p>

  <p>"Serve you? By coming here trying to kill me?"</p>

  <p>"He may have thought I wished to be free. He didn't tell me what he was
  going to do."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie." He stopped, watching her white face. "I don't mean that,
  you know. But you ain't actually asking me to get Sinclair out of jail?
  Besides, I couldn't do it!"</p>

  <p>"You could easily. Moreover, it's to your interest. It will take a strong
  jail to hold him, and if he breaks away, you know that he's a dangerous man.
  He hates you, Jude, and he might try to find you. If he did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She waved her hand, and Cartwright followed the gesture with great,
  fascinated eyes, as if he saw himself dissolving into thin air.</p>

  <p>"I know; he's a desperado, right enough, this Sinclair. Ain't I seen him
  work?" He shuddered at the memory.</p>

  <p>"But get him out of the jail, Jude, and that will be ended. He'll be your
  friend."</p>

  <p>"Could I trust him?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think Riley Sinclair is a man to be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno." He lowered his eyes. "Maybe he is."</p>

  <p>"As for Arizona," she went on, "the same thing holds for him."</p>

  <p>"Yes; if I could get one out, I could get two. But how can I do it? This
  Sheriff Kern is a fighting idiot, and loves a gunplay. I ain't no man-killer,
  honey."</p>

  <p>"But you're rich, Jude."</p>

  <p>"Tolerable. They may be one or two has more than me, around these
  parts."</p>

  <p>"And money buys men!"</p>

  <p>"Don't it, though?" said Jude, expanding. "Why, when they found that I was
  a spender they started in hounding me. One gent wanted me to help him on a
  mortgage&mdash;only fifty bucks to meet a payment. And they's half a dozen
  would mortgage their souls if I'd stake 'em to enough downstairs to get them
  into a crap game, or something."</p>

  <p>"Then let them have the money they need. Why, it wouldn't be more than a
  hundred dollars altogether."</p>

  <p>"A hundred is a hundred. Why should I throw it away on them bums?"</p>

  <p>"Because after you've done it, you'll have a dozen men who'll follow you.
  You'll have a mob."</p>

  <p>"Sure! But what of that? Expect me to lead an attack on a jail, eh? Throw
  my life away? By guns, I think you'd like that!"</p>

  <p>"You don't have to lead. Just give them the money they need and then
  spread the word around that Riley Sinclair is really an honorable man who
  killed Quade in a fair fight. I know what they thought of Quade. He was a
  bully. No one liked him. Tell them it's a shame that a man like Sinclair
  should die because he killed a big, hulking cur such as Quade. They'll
  listen&mdash; particularly if they have your money. I know these men, Jude.
  If they think an injustice is being done, they'll risk their necks to right
  it! And if you work on them in the right way, you can have twenty men who'll
  risk everything to get Riley out. But there won't be a risk. If twenty men
  rush the jail, the guards will simply throw down their guns and give up."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wonder!" muttered Cartwright.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of it, Jude. Do you think a deputy will let himself be killed
  simply to keep a prisoner safely? They won't do it!"</p>

  <p>"You don't know this Kern!"</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> know him, and I know that he's human. I've seen him beaten
  once already."</p>

  <p>"By Sinclair! You keep coming back to him!"</p>

  <p>"Jude, if you do this thing for me," she said steadily, "I'll go back with
  you. I don't love you, but if I go back I'll keep you from a great deal of
  shameful talk. I'm sorry, truly, that I left. I couldn't help it. It was an
  impulse that&mdash;took me by the throat. And if I go back I'll honestly try
  to make you a good wife."</p>

  <p>She faltered a little before that last word, and her voice fell. But Jude
  Cartwright was wholly fascinated by the color in her face, and the softness
  of her voice he mistook for a sudden rise of tenderness.</p>

  <p>"They's only one thing I got to ask&mdash;you and Sinclair&mdash;have you
  ever&mdash;I mean&mdash;have you ever told him you're pretty fond of
  him&mdash;that you love him?" He blurted it out, stammering.</p>

  <p>Certainly she knew that her answer was a lie, though it was true in the
  letter.</p>

  <p>"I have never told him so," she said firmly. "But I owe him a great debt
  &mdash;he must not die because he's a gentleman, Jude."</p>

  <p>All the time she was speaking, he watched her with ferret sharpness,
  thinking busily. Before she ended he had reached his decision.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to raise that mob."</p>

  <p>"Jude!"</p>

  <p>What a ring in her voice! If he had been in doubt he would have known
  then. No matter what she said, she loved Riley Sinclair. He smiled sourly
  down on her.</p>

  <p>"Keep your thanks. You'll hear news of Sinclair before morning." And he
  stalked out of the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33"></a>CHAPTER 33</h2>

  <p class="first">Cartwright went downstairs in the highest good humor. He had
  been convinced of two things in the interview with his wife: The first was
  that she could be induced to return to him; the second was that she loved
  Riley Sinclair. He did not hate her for such fickleness. He merely despised
  her for her lack of brains. No thinking woman could hesitate a moment between
  the ranches and the lumber tracts of Cartwright and the empty purse of Riley
  Sinclair.</p>

  <p>As for hatred, that he concentrated on the head of Sinclair himself. He
  had already excellent reasons for hating the rangy cowpuncher. Those reasons
  were now intensified and given weight by what he had recently learned. He
  determined to raise a mob, but not to accomplish his wife's desires. What she
  had said about the weakness of jails, the strength of Sinclair, and the
  probability that once out he would take the trail of the rancher, appealed
  vigorously to his imagination. He did not dream that such a man as Sinclair
  would hesitate at a killing. And, loving the girl, the first thing Sinclair
  would do would be to remove the obstacle through the simple expedient of a
  well- placed bullet.</p>

  <p>But the girl had not only convinced him in this direction, she had taught
  him where his strength lay, and she had pointed a novel use for that
  strength. He went to work instantly when he entered the big back room of the
  hotel which was used for cards and surreptitious drinking. A little,
  patient-faced man in a corner, who had been sucking a pipe all evening and
  watching the crap game hungrily, was the first object of his charity. Ten
  dollars slipped into the pocket of the little cowpuncher brought him out of
  his chair, with a grin of gratitude and bewilderment. A moment later he was
  on his knees calling to the dice in a cackling voice.</p>

  <p>Crossing the room, Cartwright picked out two more obviously stalled
  gamblers and gave them a new start. Returning to the table, he found that the
  game was lagging. In the first place he had from the start supplied most of
  the sinews of war to that game. Also, two disgruntled members had gone broke
  in his absence, through trying to plunge for the spoils of the evening. They
  sat back, with black faces, and watched him come.</p>

  <p>"We're getting down to a small game," said the gray-headed man who was
  dealing.</p>

  <p>But Cartwright had other ideas. "A friend's a friend," he said jovially.
  "And a gent that's been playing beside me all evening I figure for a friend.
  Sit in, boys. I'll stake you to a couple of rounds, eh?"</p>

  <p>Gladly they came, astonished and exchanging glances.</p>

  <p>Cartwright had made a sour loser all the game. This sudden generosity took
  them off balance. It let in a merciful light upon the cruel criticism which
  they had been leveling at him in private. The pale man, with the blond
  eyelashes and the faded blue eyes, who had been dexterously stacking the
  cards all through the game, decided at that moment that he would not only
  stop cheating, but he would even lose some of his ill-gotten gains back into
  the game; only a sudden rush of unbelievable luck kept him from executing his
  generous and silent promise.</p>

  <p>This pale-faced man was named Whitey, from the excessive blondness of his
  hair and his pallor. He was not popular in Sour Creek, but he was much
  respected. A proof of his ingenuity was that he had cheated at cards in that
  community for five years, and still he had never been caught at his work. He
  was not a bold-talking man. In fact he never started arguments or trouble of
  any kind; but he was a most dexterous and thoroughgoing fighter when he was
  cornered. In fact he was what is widely known as a "finisher." And it was
  Whitey whom Cartwright had chosen as the leader of the mob which he intended
  raising. He waited until the first shuffle was in progress after the hand,
  then he began his theme.</p>

  <p>"Understand the sheriff is pretty strong for this Sinclair that murdered
  Quade," he said carelessly.</p>

  <p>"'Murder' is a tolerable strong word," came back the unfriendly answer.
  "Maybe it was a fair fight."</p>

  <p>Cartwright laughed. "Maybe it was," he said.</p>

  <p>Whitey interrupted himself in the act of shoving the pack across to be
  cut. He raised his pale eyes to the face of the rancher. "What makes you
  laugh, Cartwright?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Jude hastily. "Nothing at all. If you gents don't know
  Sinclair, it ain't up to me to give you light. Let him go."</p>

  <p>Nothing more was said during that hand which Whitey won. Jude, apparently
  bluffing shamelessly, bucked him up to fifty dollars, and then he allowed
  himself to be called with a pair of tens against a full house. Not only did
  he lose, but he started a laugh against himself, and he joined in cheerfully.
  He was aware of Whitey frowning curiously at him and smiling faintly, which
  was the nearest that Whitey ever came to laughter. And, indeed, the laugh
  cost Cartwright more than money, but it was a price&mdash;the price he was
  paying for the adherence of Whitey.</p>

  <p>"What about this Sinclair?" asked the man with the great, red, blotchy
  freckles across his face and the back of his neck, so that the skin between
  looked red and raw. "You come from up north, which is his direction, too.
  Know anything about him? He looks like pretty much of a man to me, and the
  sheriff says he's a square shooter from the word go."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he is," said Cartwright. "But I don't want to go around digging the
  ground away from nobody's reputation."</p>

  <p>"Whatever he's got, he won't last long," said Whitey definitely. "He'll
  swing sure."</p>

  <p>It was Cartwright's opening. He took advantage of it dexterously, without
  too much haste. He even yawned to show his lack of interest.</p>

  <p>"Well, I got a hundred that says he don't hang," he observed quietly and
  looked full at Whitey across the table. It was a challenge which the gambling
  spirit of the latter could not afford to overlook.</p>

  <p>"Money talks," began Whitey, then he checked himself. "Do you
  <i>know</i>anything, Cartwright?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I don't," said Jude in the manner of one who has abundant knowledge
  in reserve. "But they say that the sheriff and Sinclair have become regular
  bunkies. Don't do nothing hardly but sit and chin with each other over in the
  jail. Ever know Kern to do that before?"</p>

  <p>They shook their heads.</p>

  <p>"Which is a sign that Sinclair may be all right," said the sober
  Whitey.</p>

  <p>"Which is a sign that he might have something on the sheriff," said Jude
  Cartwright. "I don't say that he <i>has</i>, mind you, but it looks kind of
  queer. He yanked a prisoner away from the sheriff one day, and the next day
  he's took for murder. Did the sheriff have much to do with his taking? No, he
  didn't. By all accounts it was Arizona that done the taking, planning and
  everything. And after Sinclair is took, what does the sheriff do? He gets on
  the trail of Arizona and has him checked in for murder of another gent. Maybe
  Arizona is guilty, maybe he ain't. But it kind of looks as if they was
  something between Sinclair and Kern, don't it?"</p>

  <p>At this bold exposition of possibilities they paused.</p>

  <p>"Kern is figured tolerable straight," declared Whitey.</p>

  <p>"Sure he is. That's because he don't talk none and does his work. Besides,
  he's a killer. That's his job. So is Sinclair a killer. Maybe he did fight
  Quade square, but Quade ain't the only one. Why, boys, this Sinclair has got
  a record as long as my arm."</p>

  <p>In silence they sat around the table, each man thinking hard. The
  professional gunman gets scant sympathy from ordinary cowpunchers.</p>

  <p>"Now I dropped in at the jail," said the man of the great freckles, "and
  come to think about it, I heard Sinclair singing, and I seen him polishing
  his spurs."</p>

  <p>"Sure, he's getting ready for a ride," put in Cartwright.</p>

  <p>There was a growl from the others. They were slowly turning their interest
  from the game to Cartwright.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean a ride?"</p>

  <p>"Got another hundred," said Cartwright calmly, "that when the morning
  comes it won't find Sinclair in the jail."</p>

  <p>At once they were absolutely silenced, for money talks in an eloquent
  voice. Deliberately Cartwright counted out the two stacks of shimmering
  twenty- dollar gold pieces, five to a stack.</p>

  <p>"One hundred that he don't hang; another hundred that he ain't in the jail
  when the morning comes. Any takers, boys? It had ought to be easy money
  &mdash;if everything's square."</p>

  <p>Whitey made a move, but finally merely raised his hand and rubbed his
  chin. He was watching that gold on the table with catlike interest. A man
  <i>must</i> know something to be so sure.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know," murmured the man of the freckles disconnectedly.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cartwright, "they ain't much of a mystery about it. For one
  thing, if the sheriff was plumb set on keeping them two, why didn't he take
  'em over to Woodville today, where they's a jail they couldn't bust out of,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>Again they were silenced, and in an argument, when a man falls silent, it
  simply means that he is thinking hard on the other side.</p>

  <p>"But as far as I'm concerned," went on Cartwright, yawning again, "it
  don't make no difference one way or another. Sour Creek ain't my town, and I
  don't care if it gets the ha-ha for having its jail busted open. Of course,
  after the birds have flown, the sheriff will ride hard after 'em&mdash;on the
  wrong trail!"</p>

  <p>Whitey raised his slender, agile, efficient hand.</p>

  <p>"Gents," he said, "something has got to be done. This man Cartwright is
  giving us the truth! He's got his hunch, and hunches is mostly always
  right."</p>

  <p>"Speak out, Whitey," said the man with the freckles encouragingly. "I like
  your style of thinking."</p>

  <p>Nodding his acknowledgments, Whitey said:</p>

  <p>"The main thing seems to be that Sinclair and Arizona is old hands at
  killing. And they had ought to be hung. Well, if the sheriff ain't got the
  rope, maybe we could help him out, eh?"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34"></a>CHAPTER 34</h2>

  <p class="first">The moment her husband was gone, Jig dropped back in her
  chair and buried her face in her arms, weeping. But there is a sort of sad
  happiness in making sacrifices for those we love, and presently Jig was
  laughing through her tears and trembling as she wiped the tears away. After a
  time she was able to make herself ready for another appearance in the street
  of Sour Creek. She practiced back and forth in her room that exaggerated
  swagger, jerked her sombrero rakishly over one eye, cocked up her cartridge
  belt at one side, and swung down the stairs.</p>

  <p>She went straight to the jail and met the sheriff at the door, where he
  sat, smoking a stub of a pipe. He gaped widely at the sight of her, smoke
  streaming up past his eyes. Then he rose and shook hands violently.</p>

  <p>"All I got to say, Jig," he remarked, "is that the others was the ones
  that made the big mistake. When I went and arrested you, I was just following
  in line. But I'm sorry, and I'm mighty glad that you been found to be
  O.K."</p>

  <p>Wanly she smiled and thanked him fox his good wishes.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see Sinclair," she said.</p>

  <p>Kern's amiability increased.</p>

  <p>"The best thing I know about you, Jig, is that you ain't turning Sinclair
  down, now that he's in trouble. Go right back in the jail. Him and Arizona is
  chinning. Wait a minute. I guess I got to keep an eye on you to see you don't
  pass nothing through the bars. Keep clean back from them bars, Jig, and then
  you can talk all you want. I'll stay here where I can watch you but can't
  hear. Is that square?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing squarer in the world," said Jig and went in.</p>

  <p>She left the sheriff grinning vacantly into the dark. There was a peculiar
  something in Jig's smile that softened men.</p>

  <p>But when she stepped into the sphere of the lantern light that spread
  faintly through the cell, she was astonished to see Arizona and Sinclair
  kneeling opposite each other, shooting dice with abandon and snapping of the
  fingers. They rose, laughing at the sight of her, and came to the bars.</p>

  <p>"But you aren't worried?" asked Jig. "You aren't upset by all this?"</p>

  <p>It was Arizona who answered, a strangely changed Arizona since his
  entrance into the jail.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said gaily, "why should we be worryin'? Ain't we got a
  good sound roof over our heads, with a set of blankets to sleep in?"</p>

  <p>He smiled at tall Sinclair, then changed his voice.</p>

  <p>"Things fell through," he said softly, glancing at the far-off shadowy
  figure of the sheriff. "Sorry, but we'll work this out yet."</p>

  <p>"I know," she answered. She lowered her voice to caution. "I'm only going
  to stay a moment to keep away suspicions. Listen! Something is going to
  happen tonight that will set you both free. Don't ask me what it is. But,
  among those cottonwoods behind the blacksmith shop, I'm going to have two
  good horses saddled and ready for you. One will be your roan, Arizona. And
  I'll have a good horse for you, Riley. And when you're free start for those
  horses."</p>

  <p>Sinclair laid hold on the bars with his big hands and pressed his face
  close to the iron, staring at her.</p>

  <p>"You ain't coming along with us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to stay here?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps! I don't know&mdash;I haven't made up my mind."</p>

  <p>"Has Cartwright&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke away from those entangling questions. "I must go."</p>

  <p>"But you'll be at the place with the horses?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then so long till the time comes. And&mdash;you're a brick, Jig!"</p>

  <p>Once outside the jail, she set to work at once. As for getting the roan,
  it was the simplest thing in the world. There was no one in the stable behind
  the hotel, and no one to ask questions. She calmly saddled the roan, mounted
  him, and rode by a wider detour to the cottonwoods behind the blacksmith
  shop.</p>

  <p>Her own horse was to be for Sinclair. But before she took him, she went
  into the hotel, and the first man she found on the veranda was Cartwright. He
  came to her at once, shifting away from the others.</p>

  <p>"How are things?"</p>

  <p>"Good," said Cartwright. "Ain't you heard 'em talking?"</p>

  <p>Here and there about the hotel, men stood in knots of three and four,
  talking in low voices.</p>

  <p>"Are they talking about <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Sure they are," said Cartwright, relieved. "You ain't heard nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>"Then the thing for you to do is to keep under cover. You don't want to
  get mixed up in this thing, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose not."</p>

  <p>"Keep out of sight, honey. The crowd will start pretty soon and tear
  things loose." He could not resist one savage thrust. "A rope, or a pair of
  ropes, will do the work."</p>

  <p>"Ropes?"</p>

  <p>"One to tie Kern, and one to tie his deputy," he explained smoothly.
  "Where you going now?"</p>

  <p>"Getting their retreat ready," she whispered excitedly. "I've already
  warned them where to go to get the horses."</p>

  <p>She waved to him and stepped back into the night, convinced that all was
  well. As for Cartwright, he hesitated, staring after her. After all, if his
  plan developed, it would be wise for him to allow the others to do the work
  of mischief. He had no wish to be actively mixed up with a lynching party.
  Sometimes there were after results. And if he had done no more than talk,
  there would be small hold upon him by the law.</p>

  <p>Moreover, things were going smoothly under the guidance of Whitey. The
  pale-faced man had thrown himself body and soul into the movement. It was a
  rare thing to see Whitey excited. Other men were readily impressed. After a
  time, when anger had reached a certain point where men melt into hot action,
  these fixed figures of men would sweep into fluid action. And then the fates
  of Arizona and Sinclair would be determined.</p>

  <p>It pleased Cartwright more than any action of his life to feel that he had
  stirred up this movement. It pleased him still more to know that he could now
  step back and watch the work of ruin go on. It was like disturbing the one
  small stone which starts the avalanche, which eventually smashes the far-off
  forest.</p>

  <p>So much was done, then. And now why not make sure that the very last means
  of retreat for the pair was blocked? The girl went to get the horses. And if,
  by the one chance in twenty, the two should actually break out of the jail,
  it would remain to Cartwright to kill the horses or the men. He did not care
  which.</p>

  <p>He slipped behind the hotel and presently saw the girl come out of the
  stable with her horse. He followed, skulking softly behind her until he
  reached the appointed place among the cottonwoods. The trees grew tall and
  thick of trunk, and about their bases was a growth of dense shrubbery. It was
  a simple thing to conceal two saddled horses in a hollow which sank into the
  edge of the shrubbery.</p>

  <p>Cartwright's first desire was to couch himself in shooting distance. Then
  he remembered that shooting with a revolver by moonlight was uncertain work.
  He slipped away to the hotel and got a rifle ready enough. Men were milling
  through the lower rooms of the hotel. The point of discussion had long since
  been passed. The ringleaders had made up their minds. They went about with
  faces so black that those who were asked to join, hardly had the courage to
  question. There was broad-voiced rumor growing swiftly. Something was wrong
  &mdash;something was very wrong. It was like that mysterious whisper which
  goes through the forest before the heavy storm strikes. Something was
  terribly wrong and must be righted.</p>

  <p>How the ringleaders had reasoned, nobody paused to ask. It was sufficient
  that a score of men were saying: "The sheriff figures on letting Sinclair and
  Arizona go."</p>

  <p>A typical scene between two men. They meet casually, one man whistling,
  the other thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"What's the bad luck?" asks the whistler.</p>

  <p>"No time for whistling," says the other.</p>

  <p>"Say, what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I ask you just this," said the gloomy man, with a mystery of much
  knowledge in his face: "Are gents around here going to be murdered, and the
  murderers go free?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Sinclair and Arizona&mdash;that's what's up! They're going to bust
  loose."</p>

  <p>"I dunno about Arizona, but Sinclair, they say, is a square shooter."</p>

  <p>"Who told you that? Sinclair himself? He's got a rep as long as my arm.
  He's a bad one, son!"</p>

  <p>"You don't say!"</p>

  <p>"I do say. And something has got to be done, or Sour Creek won't be a
  decent man's town no more."</p>

  <p>"Let me in." Off they went arm in arm.</p>

  <p>Cartwright saw half a dozen little interviews of this nature, as he
  entered the hotel. Men were excited, they hardly knew why. There is no need
  for reason in a mob. One has only to cry, "Kill!" and the mob will start of
  its own volition to find something that may be slain. Also, a mob has no
  conscience and no remorse. It is the nearest thing to a devil that exists,
  and it is also the nearest thing to the divine mercy and courage. It is
  braver than the bravest man; it is more timorous than the most fearful; it is
  fiercer than a lion, gentler than a lamb. All these things by turns, and each
  one to the exclusion of all the others.</p>

  <p>Now the thunderclouds were piling on the horizon, and Cartwright could
  feel the electricity in the air. He went to Pop.</p>

  <p>"I got to have a rifle."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"You know," said Cartwright significantly.</p>

  <p>The hotelkeeper nodded. He brought out an old Winchester, still mobile of
  action and deadly. With that weapon under his arm, Cartwright started back,
  but then he remembered that there were excellent chances of missing even with
  a rifle, when he was shooting through the shadows and by the treacherous
  moonlight. It would be better, far better, to have his horse with him. Then,
  if he actually succeeded in wounding one or both of them, he could run his
  victim down, or, perhaps, keep up a steady fire of rifle shots from the rear,
  that would bring half the town pouring out to join in the chase.</p>

  <p>So he swung back to the stables, saddled his horse, trotted it around in a
  comfortably wide detour, and, coming within sound distance of the cottonwoods
  behind the blacksmith shop, he dismounted and led his horse into a dense
  growth of shrubbery. That close approach would have been impossible without
  alarming the girl, had it not been for a stiff wind blowing across into his
  face, completely muffling the noise of his coming. In the bushes he ensconced
  himself safely. Only a few yards away he kept his eye on the opening among
  the cottonwoods, behind which the girl and the two horses moved from time to
  time, growing more and more visible, as the moon climbed above the horizon
  mist.</p>

  <p>He tightened his grip on the rifle and amused himself with drawing beads
  on stumps and bright bits of foliage, from time to time. He must be ready for
  any sort of action if the two should ever appear.</p>

  <p>While he waited, sounds reached his ear from the town, sounds eloquent of
  purpose. He listened to them as to beautiful music. It was a low, distinct,
  and continuous humming sound. Voices of men went into it, low as the growl of
  an angered dog, and there was a background of slamming doors, and footsteps
  on verandas. Sour Creek was mustering for the assault.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35"></a>CHAPTER 35</h2>

  <p class="first">Now that sound had entered the jail, and it had a peculiar
  effect. It was like that distant murmuring of the storm which walks over the
  treetops far away. It made the sheriff and his two prisoners lift their heads
  and look at one another in silence, for the sheriff was most unprofessionally
  tilted back in a chair, with his feet braced against the bars of the cell,
  while he chatted with his bad men about men, women, and events. The sheriff
  had a distinct curiosity to learn how Arizona had recovered so suddenly from
  his "blue funk."</p>

  <p>Unquestionably the fat man had recovered. His voice was as steady now as
  any man's, and the old, insolent glitter was in his eyes. He squared his
  shoulders and blew his smoke straight at the face of the sheriff, as he
  talked. What caused it, the sheriff could not tell, this rehabilitation of a
  fighting man, but he connected the influence of Sinclair with the change.</p>

  <p>By this time Sinclair himself was the more restless of the two. While
  Arizona sat at ease on the bunk, the tall man ranged up and down the cell,
  with long, noiseless steps, turning quickly back and forth beside the bars.
  He had spent his nervous energy cheering up Arizona, until the latter was
  filled with a reckless, careless courage. What would happen Arizona could not
  guess, but Sinclair had assured him that something <i>would</i> happen, and
  he trusted implicitly to the word of his tall companion. Sooner or later he
  would learn that they were hopeless, and Sinclair dreaded the breakdown which
  he knew would follow that discovery.</p>

  <p>In his heart Sinclair knew that there would be no hope, no chance. The
  girl, he felt, had been swept off her feet with some absurd dream of freeing
  them. For his own part he had implicit faith in the strength of the toolproof
  steel of the bars on the one hand, and the gun of the sheriff on the other.
  As long as they held, they would keep their prisoners. The key to freedom was
  the key to the sheriff's heart, and Sinclair was too much of a man to
  whine.</p>

  <p>He had come to the end of his trail, and that was evident in the
  restlessness of his walking to and fro. The love of the one thing on earth
  that he cared for was his, according to Arizona, and there was nothing to
  make the fat man lie. It seemed to Riley Sinclair that, at the very moment he
  had set his hands upon priceless gold, the treasure was crumbling to dead
  sand. He had lost her by the very thing that won her.</p>

  <p>In the midst of his pacing he stopped and lifted his head, just as the
  sheriff and Arizona did the same thing. The far-off murmur hummed and moaned
  toward them, gathering strength. Then the sheriff pushed back his chair and
  went to the front of the jail. They heard him give directions to his deputy
  to find out what the murmuring meant. When Kern returned he was patently
  worried.</p>

  <p>"Gents," he said, "I've heard that same sort of a sound twice before, and
  it means business." None of the three spoke again until the door of the jail
  was burst open, and the deputy came on them, running.</p>

  <p>"Kern," he gasped, as he reached the sheriff, "they're coming."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Every man in Sour Creek. They tried to get me with 'em. I told 'em I'd
  stay and then slipped off. They want both of these. They want 'em bad.
  They're going to fight to get 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Do they want to grab Arizona and Sinclair?" asked the sheriff, with
  surprising lack of emotion. "Don't think they're guilty?"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong. They think they're sure guilty, and they're going to lynch
  'em."</p>

  <p>He whispered this, but his panting made the words louder than he thought.
  Sinclair heard; and by the shudder of Arizona, he knew that his companion had
  heard as well.</p>

  <p>Now came the low-pitched voice of the sheriff: "Are you with me, Pat?"</p>

  <p>The deputy receded. "Why, man, you ain't going to fight the whole
  town?"</p>

  <p>"I'd fight the whole town," said the sheriff smoothly, "but I don't need
  you with me. You're through, partner. Close the door soft when you go
  out!"</p>

  <p>Pat made no argument, offered no sentimental protest of devotion. He was
  glad of any excuse, and he retreated at once. After him went the sheriff, and
  Sinclair heard the heavy door of the jail locked. Kern came back, carrying a
  bundle. Outside, the murmuring had increased at a single leap to a roar. The
  rush for the jail was beginning.</p>

  <p>Arizona shrank back against the wall, his little eyes glaring desperately
  at Sinclair, his last hope in the emergency. But Sinclair looked to the
  sheriff. The bundle in the arms of the latter unrolled and showed two
  cartridge belts, with guns appended. Next, still in silence, the sheriff
  unlocked the door to the cell.</p>

  <p>"Sinclair!"</p>

  <p>The tall cowpuncher leaped beside him. Arizona skirted away to one side
  stealthily.</p>

  <p>"None of that!" commanded Kern. "No crooked work, Arizona. I'm giving you
  a fighting chance for your lives."</p>

  <p>Here he tossed a gun and belt to Sinclair. The latter without a word
  buckled it on.</p>

  <p>"Now, quick work, boys," said the sheriff. "It's going to be the second
  time in my life that prisoners have got away and tied me up. Understand? They
  ain't going to be no massacre if I can help it. Gents like Sinclair don't
  come in pairs, and he's going to have a fighting chance. Boys, tie me up fast
  and throw me in the corner. I'll tell 'em that you slugged me through the
  bars and got the keys away. You hear?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he threw Arizona a gun and belt, and the latter imitated
  Sinclair in buckling it on. But the fat man then made for the door of the
  cell. Outside the rush reached the entrance to the jail and split on it. The
  voices leaped into a tumult.</p>

  <p>"By thunder," demanded Arizona, "are you going to wait for
  <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>"You want Kern to get into trouble?" asked Sinclair. "Grab this end and
  tie his ankles, while I fix his hands."</p>

  <p>Frantically they worked together.</p>

  <p>"Are you comfortable, sheriff?"</p>

  <p>He lay securely trussed in a corner of the passageway.</p>

  <p>"Dead easy, boys. Now what's your plan?"</p>

  <p>"Is there a back way out?"</p>

  <p>"No way in or out but the front door. You got to wait till they smash it.
  There they start now! Then dive out, as they rush. They won't be expecting
  nothing like that. But gag me first."</p>

  <p>Hastily Sinclair obeyed. The door of the jail was shaking and groaning
  under the attack from without, and the shouts were a steady roar. Then he
  hurried to the front of the little building. Arizona was already there, gun
  in hand, watching the door bulge under the impact. Evidently they had caught
  up a heavy timber, and a dozen men were pounding it against the massive door.
  Sinclair caught the gun arm of his companion.</p>

  <p>"Fatty," he said hastily, "gunplay will spoil everything. We got to take
  'em by surprise. Fast running will save us, maybe. Fast shooting ain't any
  good when it's one man agin' fifty, and these boys mean business."</p>

  <p>Arizona reluctantly let his gun drop back in its holster. He nodded to
  Sinclair. The latter gave his directions swiftly, speaking loudly to make his
  voice carry over the roar of the crowd.</p>

  <p>"When the door goes down, which it'll do pretty pronto, I'll dive out from
  this side, and you run from the other side, straight into the crowd. I'll
  turn to the right, and you turn to the left. The minute you're around the
  corner of the building shoot back over your shoulder, or straight into the
  air. It'll make 'em think that you've stopped and are going to fight 'em off
  from the corner. They'll take it slow, you can bet. Then beat it straight on
  for the cottonwoods behind the blacksmith shop."</p>

  <p>"They'll drop us the minute we show."</p>

  <p>"Sure, we got the long chance, and nothing more. Is that good enough for
  you?"</p>

  <p>He was rewarded in the dimness by a glint in the eyes of Arizona, and then
  the fat man gripped his hand.</p>

  <p>"You and me agin' the world."</p>

  <p>In the meantime the door was bulging in the center under blows of
  increasing weight. A second battering ram was now brought into play, and the
  rain of blows was unceasing. Still between shocks, the door sprang back, but
  there was a telltale rattle at every blow. Finally, as a yell sprang up from
  the crowd at the sight, the upper hinge snapped loudly, and the door sagged
  in. Both timbers were now apparently swung at the same moment. Under the
  joint impact the door was literally lifted from its last hinge and hurled
  inward. And with it lunged the two battering rams and the men who had wielded
  them. They tumbled headlong, carried away by the very weight of their
  successful blow.</p>

  <p>"Now!" called Sinclair, and he sprang with an Indian yell over the heads
  of the sprawling men in the doorway and into the thick of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen of the drawn guns whipped up at the sight, but no one could
  make sure in the half-light of the identity of the man who had dashed out.
  Their imaginations placed the two prisoners safely behind the bars inside.
  Before they could think twice, a second figure leaped through the doorway and
  passed them in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Then they awakened to the fact, but they awakened in confusion. A dozen
  shots blazed in either direction, but they were wild, snapshots of men taken
  off balance.</p>

  <p>Two leaps took Sinclair through the thick of the astonished men before
  him. He came to the scattering edges and saw a man dive at him. The
  cowpuncher beat the butt of his gun into the latter's face and sped on,
  whipping around the corner of the little jail, with bullets whistling after
  him.</p>

  <p>His own gun, as he leaped out of sight, he fired into the ground, and he
  heard a similar shot from the far side of the building. Those two shots, as
  he had predicted, checked the pursuers one vital second and kept them milling
  in front of the jail. Then they spilled out around the corners, each man
  running low, his gun ready.</p>

  <p>But Sinclair, deep in the darkness of the tree shadows behind the jail,
  was already out of sight. He caught a glimpse of Arizona sprinting ahead of
  him for dear life. They reached the cottonwoods together and were greeted by
  a low shout from the girl; she was running out from the shelter, dragging the
  horses after her.</p>

  <p>Arizona went into his saddle with a single leap. Sinclair paused to take
  the jump, with his hand on the pommel, and as he lifted himself up with a
  jump, a gun blazed in point-blank range from the nearest shrubbery.</p>

  <p>There was a yell from Arizona, not of pain, but of rage. They saw his gun
  glistening in his hand, and, swerving his horse to disturb the aim of the
  marksman, his weapon's first report blended with the second shot from the
  bushes, a tongue of darting flame. Straight at the flash of a target Arizona
  had fired, and there was an answering yell. Out of the dark of the shrubbery
  a great form leaped, with a grotesque shadow beneath it on the moon-whitened
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Cartwright!" cried Sinclair, as the big man collapsed and became a
  shapeless, inanimate black heap.</p>

  <p>Straight ahead Arizona was already spurring, and Sinclair waved once to
  the white face of Jig, then shot after his companion, while the trees and
  shrubbery to their left emitted a sudden swarm of men and barking guns.</p>

  <p>But to strike a rapidly moving object with a revolver is never easy, and
  to strike by the moonlight is difficult indeed. A dangerous flight of slugs
  bored the air around the fugitives for the first hundred yards of their
  flight, but after that the firing ceased, as the men of Sour Creek ran for
  their horses.</p>

  <p>Straight on into the night rode the pair.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>One year had made Arizona a little plumper, and one year had drawn Riley
  Sinclair more lean and somber, when they rode out on the shoulder of a flat-
  topped mountain and looked down into the hollow, where the late afternoon sun
  was already sending broad shadows out from every rise of ground. Sour Creek
  was a blur and a twinkle of glass in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Come to think of it," said Arizona, "it's just one year today. Riley, was
  it that that brung you back here, and me, unknowing?"</p>

  <p>The tall man made no answer, but shaded his eyes to peer down into the
  valley, and Arizona made no attempt to pursue the conversation. He was long
  since accustomed to the silences of his traveling mate. Seeing that Sinclair
  showed no disposition either to speak or move, he left the big cowpuncher to
  himself and started off through the trees in search of game. The sign of a
  deer caught his eye and hurried him on into a futile chase, from which he
  returned in the early dark of the evening. He was guided by the fire which
  Sinclair had kindled on the shoulder, but to his surprise, as he drew nearer,
  the fire dwindled, very much as if Riley had entirely forgotten to replenish
  it with dry wood.</p>

  <p>A year of wild life had sharpened the caution of Arizona. That neglect of
  his fire was by no means in keeping with the usual methods of Sinclair.
  Before he came to the last spur of the hill, Arizona dismounted and stole up
  on foot. He listened intently. There was not a sound of anyone moving about.
  There was only an occasional crackle of the dying fire. When he came to the
  edge of the shoulder, Arizona raised his head cautiously to peer over.</p>

  <p>He saw a faintly illumined picture of Riley Sinclair, sitting with his hat
  off, his face raised, and such a light in his face that there needed no play
  of the fire to tell its meaning. Beside him sat a girl, more distinct, for
  she was dressed in white, and the fire gleamed and curled and modeled her
  hair and cast a highlight on her chin, her throat, and her hand in the brown
  hand of Sinclair.</p>

  <p>Arizona winced down out of sight and stole back under the trees.</p>

  <p>"Doggone me," he said to his horse, "they both remembered the day."</p>
