  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; A DIVE INTO BLACKNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">All the earth was black, but there was still light in the
  heavens when Larry Givain came over the hills and into the valley. He paused
  on the upper slope between a great Spanish dagger plant and a scrub cedar.
  Below him the darkness was broken, not by forms, but by black hints of shapes
  like arms thrust up at the sky. More Spanish daggers, then, marched down in
  their grisly ranks to the bottom of the hollow.</p>

  <p>Larry Givain dismounted from the saddle, loosened the throat latch of his
  mare, and took off his glove to rub her wet muzzle. "Dear old Sally," he said
  to her, and stopped patting her nose to slick her ears between his
  fingertips. Even her ears were wet almost to the points, for Sally had
  labored mightily that day, and, when Larry looked back in mind to the
  wilderness of desert and rocks and mountains which the dainty-footed mare had
  covered, it seemed that they must have been given wings.</p>

  <p>In this hollow beyond the rise he had hoped to find the light of a house.
  Once before he had traveled in that general direction, and he could be almost
  certain that he had passed a house in this very place, although that was
  years before, and the whole remembrance was as dim as the light in which he
  was riding. But he needed water very badly. It did not so much matter that
  his own throat was lined with fire. It had been in that condition many a time
  before, when he was compelled by certain exigencies to plunge out of one town
  and away toward another of vague location, somewhere beyond a gigantic screen
  of desert. For, like most men who make their living by their luck at cards,
  Larry Givain was apt to run into streaks of violent unpopularity after he had
  been in a town a few days.</p>

  <p>In the old days he had been able to arrange a career across the mountains
  so that he flitted safely on like a bee, sipping the honey at one flower
  patch and then darting away to the next before the hornets were aroused. But
  having been five years on the road, he now found that he had to retrace his
  steps across known country. Of course, he never went back to the same town he
  had been in before, but even to be in the near vicinity of a town that had
  known him in the past was dangerous. If one man saw him, talk was started.
  And shortly after talk was started, it became an essential for Larry to use
  the legs of a fast horse.</p>

  <p>The fast horse was Sally, and she was a very rocket for speed, yet she had
  been with him so long that she was becoming almost more of an encumbrance
  than a blessing, for where his face was not remembered, her beautiful brown
  body and the white-stockinged near forefoot and the blaze of white in the
  center of her forehead were sure to be recalled. Of course, he would not give
  her up. She had saved his hide a hundred times. She knew his voice; she knew
  his whisper. She would have given all of her great heart for him as freely as
  though her blood were water.</p>

  <p>Larry Givain thought of these things, while he rubbed her sleek ears and
  blessed her. But she must have water. Not only for her own sake but to keep
  away from sundry hot riders whom he had last seen in the middle of the
  afternoon, coursing furiously along his trail. They were very angry fellows,
  and they had promised him, among other things, a coat of tar and feathers.
  However, that was a girl which had been offered to him before, and the
  acceptance of which he had dexterously avoided.</p>

  <p>He mounted Sally again and rode her gently down the hill, knowing well
  that a down slope is far harder on a tired horse than an upward one. And so
  it was, just as he reached the bottom of the hollow, that the place loomed
  black and big before him&mdash;literally slapped him in the face. It was the
  house of his dim memory, put here in the hollow, surely enough, but simply
  without a light in it.</p>

  <p>That might mean, perhaps, desertion, and no water available in a broken
  well. He hurried anxiously to the rear, and there he saw the long trough with
  a great yellow star floating in the black water.</p>

  <p>Sally, like a good horse, drove her head in up to the eye, but after she
  had taken a deep swallow or two, Larry Givain drew her away, for she was far
  too hot to drink much. And she answered his touch, in spite of her passion of
  thirst, as readily as though he was taking her from a free pasture. Little
  things sometimes touch us most, and this kindly willingness of Sally's made
  the whole heart of Larry Givain rise.</p>

  <p>He led her away from the trough, loosened the cinches a trifle
  more&mdash;for he made a point of a loose cinch at all times&mdash;and looked
  back to the skyline. The stars were out, but not in the east where the last
  pallor of the old day was living, and this light defined mistily the heads of
  the eastern hills. No black shadows of horsemen broke that line, and they
  would not break it for a good half hour to come, at the least. Sally had been
  running her best, and, when Sally did her best, the cream of other horseflesh
  shriveled and shrank from comparison.</p>

  <p>That half hour would be far better employed in rest than in further
  riding. If, at the end of that time, the impromptu posse stormed over the
  hills and swept down toward the house, they had as well try to tag the tail
  of a comet as attempt to catch a rested and well-breathed Sally.</p>

  <p>So he tried the door of the house. It was unlatched. It occurred to him
  that the owner of the house might be there, but simply asleep after a hard
  day's work. So he called, but his voice died, and the echoes rang from wall
  to wall with a convincing hollowness. So he threw the reins of Sally and
  stepped in to explore.</p>

  <p>What the light of three matches showed him were three rooms. The first was
  the kitchen, where he found the well primed, a sure sign that the owner of
  the house was not more than twenty-four hours away. He worked it for five
  minutes, controlling his wild thirst until the stream of water ran cool as a
  mountain spring, for he knew that half a cup of really cool water will do
  more for a famished man than a whole quart, apparently, of lukewarm throat
  wash. His second match showed him a living room. His third match gave to his
  eyes the bedroom.</p>

  <p>It was a well-ordered, well-equipped house, a hundred times neater and
  better furnished than the average squatter's shack, and a squatter this man
  must surely be. Givain went to the living room, opened the window, and let a
  stream of fresh night air cleanse away the humid heat that had been
  accumulating in the house all day. It washed away the larger half of the
  nameless odors of the dwelling, also, and let in the keen scent of the
  desert, sharp as a wolf's ear, to the nostrils of Givain. He whistled for
  Sally. It was the only thing in the world that could make her stir after the
  reins had been thrown, so she trotted up to him, holding her head far to the
  side so that she would not tread on the reins. Then she stood at the window,
  and, when Givain lighted the lamp, her great eyes mirrored the light and made
  her look almost terrible in wildness.</p>

  <p>There she remained, sniffing cautiously at the door, then raising her
  little square nose to the ceiling, then drawing back without moving her feet
  and looking about her into the night. For, with infinite care, he had taught
  her to stand as quietly and to move as quietly as a great loafer wolf. Her
  master in the meantime was busying himself with the first book upon which his
  hand had fallen. He was so glad to see it that he hardly cared to wonder how
  it happened to be in a mere squatter's shack. He opened it, and was instantly
  deep in the pages.</p>

  <p>The time passed. Outside, the last light faded, the coyote that had been
  crying down the draw turned downwind, and his voice began to quiver and pulse
  along the horizon of sounds, as a sail on the open seas seems to wing in and
  out of view. Still, the time rolled on. Sally was ready for her second drink
  long since, and she moved more and more restlessly, until finally she stepped
  about and stared continually into the night to make out the first movement of
  an enemy. For poor Sally had been hunted with her master so often that she
  distrusted a long halt with all of her heart.</p>

  <p>At length there came a warning that struck even the attention of the
  gambler. It was no more, say, than the noise that wind makes on a quiet day,
  when a door is opened silently and slowly, but to Larry Givain the sound
  seemed as intelligible as the whisper of a voice at his ear. For he had heard
  the unmistakable sound of cloth rubbing against cloth, and the noise came
  from the kitchen, where he had not seen a fragment of cloth hanging against
  the wall.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the window. He could dive through it like an eel into water
  and be instantly safe on the back of Sally, where she stood, glimmering in
  the starlight, but Givain had fled long enough. He had a sort of femininely
  uncertain nature that made him unaware of exactly what course he would
  pursue. He never could plan a strict course of action for himself; the
  stricter it was, the more apt he would be to break it. On this occasion,
  reason told him to flee speedily, but the imp of the perverse made him
  stay.</p>

  <p>Givain laid down his book and rose from his chair. He reached the wall
  nearest to the opening of the kitchen door in three long and gliding steps.
  Then he waited. It did not seem to weary him to wait out the seconds, or to
  hold his difficult position, for he was crouched low, as if he would strike
  at an enemy with teeth and hands like a beast of prey rather than with the
  heavy- handled Colt that dragged down in his holster. For, strangely, he had
  not drawn the gun. Indeed, it was a maxim of his never to draw a gun until
  there was absolute necessity to shoot, and never to find a necessity until he
  felt that his own life must be given up otherwise. In that crouched position
  one felt that the body beneath his clothes must be like the body of an
  Indian, lithe and lean and wiry, and his thin, handsome face was sunburned to
  an Indian brown, and his big, dark eyes had the Indian wild light in
  them.</p>

  <p>The door swayed open a crack, and Givain melted against the wall. It
  opened a bit more, and he dug his toes against the floor. He always wore
  soles on his riding boots of a papery thinness. Sometimes they made for
  discomfort in a long ride, chafing against the stirrups, but those flexible
  soles gave his feet a purchase and made his footfall as silent as the
  dropping of a moccasin.</p>

  <p>The door opened yet more; something was now visible beyond it. There was a
  half guessed at eye of metal gleaming behind the dusky wall. Of course, the
  gun was the thing to use, a quick snap shot, aimed rather low perhaps, in
  case he did not wish to risk inflicting a mortal wound upon an innocent man.
  But instead of the gun, suppose that he dove into the blackness beyond,
  grappled the enemy&mdash;it would be death, perhaps, but it would be an
  exquisite thrill of pleasure.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; TAKING JIM'S PLACE</h2>

  <p class="first">He was through the door like a thrown stone, and with almost
  as noiseless a rush. There was not even time for a gasp from the other,
  before the shoulder of Givain went home and the figure went down in the dark.
  Givain reached, with a wolf's instinct, for the throat, and found it.</p>

  <p>But he loosed his grip the instant his fingertips sank into the flesh, for
  there was never a man who had so soft a skin. Then he lifted the inert burden
  in his arms and ran back into the light of the lamp. He cried out with
  horror, for it was a girl, with her head hanging back as though her neck were
  broken, and her hair streaming down to the floor&mdash;long black hair that
  dropped like a coiling pool upon the floor.</p>

  <p>Just as his heart was frozen with the thought that she might be dead,
  indeed, she stirred. Givain laid her carefully in the chair and stepped back
  to the wall, still weak, still sick at heart. So she opened her eyes and
  looked out at him.</p>

  <p>It was as though the lamp was turned upon her face for the first time to
  bring it out of the darkness, that opening of her eyes. Before he had simply
  seen that she was a woman, that she was young, that she was good to see. Now
  he found a pale, young face in which the only beautiful feature was the eyes.
  For the rest, her nose was too short, and her mouth was too wide. She was
  astonishingly pretty, but no one could ever have called her beautiful.</p>

  <p>She did not scream, although he had set his nerves to endure it. She did
  not even fall on her knees and beg him not to murder her, although he had
  prepared his eyes for that. All that she did was to stare at him for a moment
  and then suddenly to smile. The smile began at the eyes first, and then
  touched the corners of her lips. If it did not make her lovely, at least it
  made her fascinating. That smile sent a trickle of warmth down to the
  innermost heart of the gambler.</p>

  <p>"I guess we were both surprised," she said. "But it was a foolish thing to
  faint. I didn't mean to, really."</p>

  <p>It was the turn of Givain to stare, and then, of course, he laughed.
  Perhaps the tail of his eye took note of the hair, tumbling to one side and
  slipping off her shoulder. She twisted that hair into shape and skewed it
  into place with a hairpin.</p>

  <p>"I thought that a great panther had jumped at me," she said, shivering.
  "When you came through the door, you came so fast that I had no time to even
  think. I wonder what a man would have done."</p>

  <p>"The same thing," said Givain rather grimly. He added hastily: "That
  sounds a bit boastful, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she said politely, and then added more slowly, considering:
  "Not a bit."</p>

  <p>If he could move with such tigerish speed, even a man, even a strong man,
  might be as helpless before him as before a thunderbolt in the fabled hand of
  the Titan.</p>

  <p>"But tell me why you have come here?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I've a good mind to ask you the same thing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I have a right to come."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have a right to be here, then."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said. "That was what I had hoped."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"That you belonged here."</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>"Because, of course, then you can give me the news about Jim."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"Where has he gone&mdash;why isn't he here&mdash;didn't he expect me?"</p>

  <p>"That's a lot for me to answer," said Larry Givain. "I don't know that Jim
  would be any too glad for me to talk right out."</p>

  <p>"But, of course, he has told you all about me, if you live right here with
  him."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said Givain, "Jim can be mighty close-mouthed about some
  things."</p>

  <p>"No, no! Why, he rattles away about anything and everything. I'd rather
  trust a secret to a baby than to Jim."</p>

  <p>Givain took refuge in the making of a cigarette and in a glance through
  the window at the mare and at the stars above the eastern hills. How many
  minutes would he be left to keep up this chatter with the girl?</p>

  <p>"That's the way a girl will do," he said. "She judges a man by what he
  does in the little things. Not what he does in the big things."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that we know different Jims," she said with a sudden anxiety.
  She looked around and shook her head. "And yet, what are you doing here, if
  you are not a friend of Jim's? You certainly are not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A thief?" suggested Givain, grinning.</p>

  <p>"Thieves don't sit down and read books before they've robbed a place," she
  said with assurance.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," she said, "that you're laughing at me all of this
  time."</p>

  <p>"On my word, I'm not."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you tell me about Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Jim wants to be talked about to everyone?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, studying him darkly. Then she took hold of a thin, gold
  watch chain that hung around her neck and that had been effectively masked by
  the collar of her blouse hitherto. She drew out a small locket. She snapped
  it open and held it up.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that will show you that I'm&mdash;a friend of Jim's?"</p>

  <p>He leaned to look more closely. There was not a shadow of a doubt. This
  was the man who had sat in with him at that last game in the town. This was
  the man who had risen and flung down the cards when a friend stooped and
  whispered something hurriedly in his ear. This was the man who had jumped up
  from his chair and refused to play another second with him.</p>

  <p>This was the man whom Givain, swinging out of his own chair, had clipped
  underneath the chin with a driving fist and dumped in a comer of the room
  with staring eyes. This was the man who had risen, shooting, with a gun in
  either hand, and with that gun smashed at least two windows while Givain was
  going through the door. This was the man who had shouted for a horse and men
  to follow the gambler. This was the man who had led the pursuit all the day,
  riding a tall, red roan horse. A dozen times Givain had caught him in the
  clear circle of his field glasses. He had studied that face so intimately
  that he could almost see the lump that must have grown out where his own hard
  knuckles had landed. And this was the girl's Jim.</p>

  <p>It was a long, strong face. There was a high, aquiline nose, a prominent
  and square-tipped chin, a bull throat. He was a very big fellow. No doubt he
  could have crushed Givain to bits in close encounter, if it had not been that
  the latter had struck that first, blinding blow. But, after all, that was
  Givain's speed. He struck with hand or knife or gun as the whiplash strikes
  after its length has once started through the air.</p>

  <p>"So you," said Givain, sitting back in the chair once more, "so you are
  the girl?"</p>

  <p>She blushed, and looked fondly down to the locket. "I suppose that I am,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"And you've come out here to drop in on Lucky Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. But do you know that I've been waiting here all day, and not a
  sign of him yet?"</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to make of it. I nearly died in the sun&mdash;it was so
  hot!"</p>

  <p>Tears of self-commiseration gathered in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you come into the house and wait?"</p>

  <p>"I did come in, but it was so deadly quiet that&mdash;that it really
  frightened me, and I had to run out again."</p>

  <p>Givain laughed, and she smiled back, cheerfully enough.</p>

  <p>"Men never know what's going on in the minds of girls."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," said Givain. "I've said that myself a good many
  times."</p>

  <p>At this she laughed in turn.</p>

  <p>"It's something important that's brought you here," said Givain.</p>

  <p>"Of course. One wouldn't plow this horrible stretch of sand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just to see Jim?"</p>

  <p>She flushed quickly. "Did Jim ever tell you my name?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He's described you over and over again," said Givain blandly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, did he do that?"</p>

  <p>"By the hour. He used to drive me out of the house with his talk."</p>

  <p>"Hmm," said the girl. "And yet he never told you my name?"</p>

  <p>"And didn't he ever mention mine when he wrote?" asked Givain.</p>

  <p>"Not a syllable."</p>

  <p>"You see, he's mighty secretive. My name is Larry Givain."</p>

  <p>He looked at her squarely in the eyes&mdash;that name was widely known,
  but let heaven be thanked that it was a new name to her.</p>

  <p>"I am Rose Mundy."</p>

  <p>They nodded their pleasure to one another.</p>

  <p>"But where is Jim?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Gone into the hills."</p>

  <p>"The hills!"</p>

  <p>"For a vacation. He had me here to take care of things."</p>

  <p>There was a groan of despair from her.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? You need him?" asked Larry Givain, with a foolish hope
  rising in him.</p>

  <p>"More than I can ever need him again."</p>

  <p>"He'll be back in a couple of days, then."</p>

  <p>"A couple of centuries."</p>

  <p>"Suppose," said Larry, "that I were to take his place?"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; BACK TO MONKVILLE</h2>

  <p class="first">At this she pricked up her ears and looked at him with her
  head canted a little to one side. She frowned with the intensity of her
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, "you <i>could</i> do it just as well as Jim or any
  other man who ever lived."</p>

  <p>"Lady," said Givain, "after that I'm ready for anything."</p>

  <p>And they laughed together.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you tell me what's wrong?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>The wind drove a rattle of sand against the side of the house, and, for
  the moment, to Givain it seemed like the approaching clatter of hoofs. But
  then his heart subsided as he recognized the truth.</p>

  <p>"I have a brother," the girl was saying.</p>

  <p>Givain nodded. "He's in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think he's in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Your brother might be, you know."</p>

  <p>"Hmm," said the girl. "I wish I knew how I might take that."</p>

  <p>She did not pursue the inquiry but continued: "At any rate, Bob always is
  in trouble. It runs in the blood, to tell you the truth. If there is a fight
  within a hundred miles of us, a Mundy is sure to be in the middle of it. And
  Bob is the worst of the lot. If someone would only thrash him soundly, it
  would be all right. It might bring him to his senses. But thrashings haven't
  come his way. He's fought a hundred times and always won."</p>

  <p>"With guns?" said Givain.</p>

  <p>"Not with guns. Two or three times he's been in scrapes with guns. But
  usually it's been with his fists. Or sometimes a man has drawn a knife, and
  Bob has followed the bad example."</p>

  <p>"Hmm," said Givain. "He seems to be a handy fellow."</p>

  <p>"Are you making fun of him?"</p>

  <p>"I'd be afraid to."</p>

  <p>"He has thousands of friends."</p>

  <p>"Why don't they help him out of his pinch, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you don't understand what the pinch is."</p>

  <p>"What is it, then?"</p>

  <p>"Al Richards!"</p>

  <p>At this Givain jumped up, walked halfway across the room, and then whirled
  and faced her sternly. All the mockery had faded from his face.</p>

  <p>"What has Richards to do with this story?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You know him, then?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Everyone knows Richards. You don't mean to say that Bob mixed
  up with Richards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There was a man came through town last spring. He met Bob, had words with
  him over something&mdash;it's horribly easy to have words with Bob about
  anything&mdash;and finally they fought.</p>

  <p>"When they were pried apart, Bob had a nasty knife cut in his cheek, but
  his own knife was between the other man's ribs. And when the man left the
  hospital, he disappeared. But after a time a letter came to Bob from Al
  Richards. He said that it was a friend of his that Bob had stabbed. And he
  said that Bob had used dirty work, and that he, Al Richards, was coming down
  to town from the mine where he was working, on the fourteenth of October. And
  the fourteenth of October is tomorrow."</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands together and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," murmured Givain. "Then why doesn't Bob leave town?"</p>

  <p>"There's all the trouble, you see. He won't leave town a single step. He
  says that he'd as soon die now as when he's sixty. There's no difference. Not
  to poor Bob. And he says that, if there were a regiment of Al Richardses, he
  wouldn't go away on account of them. So, there he stays, and tomorrow is his
  very last day."</p>

  <p>It was a final touch to the picture of Bob, and the</p>

  <p>gambler felt his heart going out to the younger man.</p>

  <p>"You can't persuade him?" he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"I've gone down on my knees and wept. It makes no difference. Bob says
  that a man's honor is worth more than anything else he may have or be. He
  won't be budged by anything that we say to him. Oh, I wish that you could
  hear him fly into a fury, when we so much as suggest that he run away. God
  bless him and pity him, poor boy."</p>

  <p>At this she clasped her hands, and the tears ran into her eyes, and Larry
  Givain worshipped her mutely.</p>

  <p>"You want someone to meet Al Richards before Al gets to your brother. Is
  that it?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>She started and flushed. "No, no! I'd feel that I'd helped Richards to
  another of his murders, if I did that. That isn't the idea. But if someone
  who's a good fighting man were to ride into town and let it be known that he
  intended to stay with Bob every minute, day and night, and prevent Richards
  from bullying him&mdash;then I'm sure that even Richards wouldn't dare to go
  ahead. He'd know that he couldn't beat two men."</p>

  <p>"He's beaten three and four at a time," suggested Larry Givain.</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. "Such men are trash," she said
  scornfully. "<i>I'm</i> a better man than such fellows. But when Al Richards
  has one look at you and at Bob, he'll know that the time has come to speak
  softly and watch his actions. No man living could beat you two."</p>

  <p>"D'you think it's manly to band together against one?"</p>

  <p>"Richards isn't a man. He's a monster. Everyone knows that. How many men
  has he made away with&mdash;some openly and some in secret? He's a tiger, not
  a man. Oh, he's a killer for the love of killing."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that's true."</p>

  <p>"When I tried to get one man to stand beside Bob, there wasn't a single
  one in town who'd do it. They said that the only thing for Bob to do was to
  turn around and run for it."</p>

  <p>"Will Bob stand for a partner?" asked Givain.</p>

  <p>"As long as he's not attacking Richards, why not? He's not aiming to
  offend Richards. He's simply asking leave to go about his own business in his
  own way. If Richards won't let him, Bob has a right to have help to keep the
  tiger off."</p>

  <p>There was unquestionably something in what she said.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Givain, "if I can be of any help, I've already said that I'd
  go."</p>

  <p>"God bless you! But that was before you knew that the man was Richards.
  You can draw back now, if you want. I'd understand."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would. But I'm not drawing back. I'll see this thing through.
  What's the name of the town? I'll be there."</p>

  <p>"Monkville."</p>

  <p>It was a straining blow to Givain. Monkville! He had rather that she had
  named any other town on the map than this one. For Monkville was no other
  than that situation in which he had played the celebrated game with marked
  cards and trimmed two rich ranchers for five thousand dollars. He could have
  laughed, when he remembered it, saving that this was not an occasion for
  laughter.</p>

  <p>That game had made the ranchers suspicious; they had asked him for another
  game and revenge the following night. He had complied, and run into a gang of
  half a dozen armed men waiting for him. They searched him, and found on him
  the crayons and acids with which he had so deftly done his markings the night
  before. They took his winnings from him. They threatened him with a thousand
  shameful punishments. And finally they locked him into a third-story room and
  continued their deliberations on how they should punish him and discourage
  crime in the rising generation.</p>

  <p>He had broken open the window, jumped into a big water trough, staggered
  half dead to Sally, and escaped, reeling and half fainting in the saddle as
  she galloped.</p>

  <p>That had been his exploit in the town of Monkville, and now she asked him
  to go back to it, promenade through the streets of it in company with a man
  who was already stared at and who drew all eyes. She was asking him to do
  these thing, and he could not refuse her. He had pledged to her his promise,
  and a promise to a girl was held foolishly sacred by Larry Givain. He was
  that sort.</p>

  <p>"Monkville," he repeated vaguely, hunting for his wits after the
  shock.</p>

  <p>She thought it was an absent-minded search for the location of the place,
  and she drew a hasty map on the floor and indicated the location of the town.
  By the time she was finished, he was master of himself again.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I'll ride there with you this very night," she
  said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "There's no purpose in that," he told her. "The thing
  for you to do is to go home and to go to bed. I'll handle the rest of this
  deal by myself."</p>

  <p>Givain got up from the chair into which he had sunk, and they went out
  together under the stars. The wind had fallen again. It was only a vagrant
  and wandering breath now, that trailed across the hills and dipped lazily,
  now and again, into the hollow where the house had been built.</p>

  <p>"When do you start?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In two minutes."</p>

  <p>"Have you a horse?"</p>

  <p>"I have the best horse that ever stepped. Here she comes."</p>

  <p>"Why, she's as gentle as a dog."</p>

  <p>"She came when she heard us talking," said Givain.</p>

  <p>"How in the world did you train her?"</p>

  <p>"By spending about four hours with her every day for five years," he said.
  "Put in eight thousand hours on almost any horse, and you get results, you
  know."</p>

  <p>At this the girl gasped. "I'm riding fast back to the house to give them
  the good news," she said, "and we'll all be in town to watch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good night," said Givain.</p>

  <p>"When I see you again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hardly heard. There was something about his bravery, and things she
  would tell him more of when they next met. But what Givain was saying to
  himself was that he would never see her again. For he intended to have Bob
  Mundy out of Monkville before noon of the next day, provided the posse played
  no interference to his little game. As a matter of fact, had he only known,
  the posse had already become discouraged, and some time since the riders had
  turned their mounts about in acknowledgment of the hopelessness of the
  chase.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; AT THE BLACKSMITH SHOP</h2>

  <p class="first">When the morning came, he felt that he could never have
  entered upon that foolish business, if he had had the daylight from the
  beginning. But daylight he had not had. There had been stars and the night
  air and the voice of the girl to seduce him from the ways of common sense.
  But the rooming sun burned all the nonsense out of him. He could see the
  facts of the case, as they were, and the insane plan that he had formed on
  the spur of the moment the night before seemed all very well enough. Now it
  appeared to Givain that the wiser thing would be simply to waylay Al Richards
  and attack him, gun in hand. But this, in turn, he discarded with a shudder.
  To attack Al Richards was like attacking and tempting the very god of death.
  He would go down at the first shot, and no good would be done for poor young
  Mundy.</p>

  <p>So he pushed ahead to the town, or rather to a hilltop from which he could
  sit in the saddle, hitched far to one side, and contemplate the view. He had
  not been near the place for two whole years, but he could remember everything
  with a wretched distinctness. He could easily pick out the broad and
  comfortable back of the hotel in which he had played that thrilling game.
  There was the twisting and winding main street down which he had fled at the
  full and matchless speed of Sally. He could even see the sun glitter on the
  face of the watering trough into which he had fallen from the windows on that
  other day.</p>

  <p>If he were not recognized, the beautiful mare was sure to be. And the
  instant they were known, there would be a riot. In any case, it meant a fast
  and far flight. He dismounted and looked over Sally. She was not gaunt. Her
  ribs showed just a trifle, but so do the ribs of a racer in the very pink of
  condition. For the rest, she looked well, as she nearly always looked. He
  could campaign her for a month uphill and down dale, and at the end of that
  time she would be almost as full of running as at the beginning. Perhaps
  practice had made her so, for her days under the gambler had been far from
  easy. And now, as he sleeked her neck and patted her flanks, she tossed her
  head and began to paw, as though she already sensed hard work ahead of
  her.</p>

  <p>Then Givain mounted and went down toward the town, very slowly. For it was
  necessary to locate young Bob Mundy before he entered the limits of the town
  itself. He must not have to loiter through the streets to be recognized, but
  go swiftly and directly to the other man and do the thing that was forming in
  his mind&mdash;and of all the wild things that Givain had ever done, this was
  the wildest.</p>

  <p>He met an old cowpuncher at the next bend of the trail, and they saluted
  one another with careless gestures and with keen eyes. He saw a wrinkle form
  in the middle of the other's brow, and knew that he was trying to hitch
  Givain to something that was in his past and almost forgotten. Givain knew
  that on such occasions the only thing to do is to brazen matters out. So he
  began to roll a cigarette as he made his inquiry. He was looking for young
  Bob Mundy.</p>

  <p>"You ain't the only one that's looking," said the cowpuncher. "The whole
  town is looking for him, and pretty soon he'll be putting on the show. I
  guess that Richards can't be very far off by now."</p>

  <p>"He must be close, if he means to keep his promise," said the gambler.</p>

  <p>"How far might you have rode in to see the party?"</p>

  <p>"From Morganton."</p>

  <p>"As far as that! Well, they been dropping in from all over for this here
  fight. I'd like mighty well to see it myself, but the old woman got took bad
  during the night and the message just came in for me to trot out home to see
  her. Besides, it won't do no man no good to see a boy like young Mundy cut up
  by a professional, as you might call him, like Richards."</p>

  <p>"Mundy is quite a fighter himself," said the gambler.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's so-so. He <i>can</i> fight&mdash;and he has fought a mighty lot
  of times. But between you and me, stranger, he likes the tune of a fight
  better than he knows the words of it. He's too good-natured to be a fine
  fighter. Takes the cool-headed, poison-minded critter like this here Richards
  to beat men often and beat 'em bad. I've seen our Bob perform. He don't do
  half bad. But in a real, stand-up fight he ain't got a chance with a man half
  as good as Richards."</p>

  <p>"You may be right. But I wish him luck."</p>

  <p>"Luck? The devil, man, so do we all of us. And he's a game kid to stand
  his ground and get killed."</p>

  <p>"Why don't folks interfere, then?"</p>

  <p>"He won't stand for interfering. He talks like a young fool. Says he's
  going to make himself famous today, and put Richards away in our churchyard.
  But everybody knows that down in his heart he figures out he ain't got a
  chance."</p>

  <p>"Well, where's he to be found?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know that? Right over next to the post office, he's running
  that big new blacksmith shop. Darned little smithing that our Bobbie does,
  though. He don't know one end of a hammer from another. But he keeps on
  running the business and talking to the girls that goes by and losing money,
  hand over fist, for his pa."</p>

  <p>The cowpuncher went on, shaking his head, and Givain started toward the
  village once more. Everything that he had heard was less and less to his
  taste. There was apt to be a crowd near young Bob even this early in the day,
  and it would be hard to face any crowd in that town without being instantly
  recognized. He could see that his course of action was greatly restricted.
  The more he heard of young Bob, the more plainly he saw that it would be
  plainly impossible to keep him quiet. Once the great Richards was in town,
  there was sure to be a meeting between them, no matter how well guarded Bob
  might be. One keen taunt and he would break away and go hunting for trouble
  which would be fatal for him.</p>

  <p>So Givain decided that, since he could not protect Mundy in the town, he
  must take Mundy away from the town, and the danger of Richards. The novelty
  of his scheme lay in the manner in which he proposed to execute the measure.
  It would be a kidnapping without a mate in history.</p>

  <p>From the edge of the hill he overlooked the place for the last time and
  laid his plans, one by one. He selected the post office from its fellow
  shacks on either side. He picked out the best tree to the rear of the post
  office under which he could leave the mare&mdash;for plainly he and the mare
  must not appear at the same instant. Then he went forward at a gallop.</p>

  <p>Givain threw a loose girdle around the town, drew up behind the post
  office, and dismounted. Then he shook his revolver loose in its holster and
  tugged his hat a little lower across his eyes. Its wide brim and a downward
  cant of his head would prevent people from recognizing him too hastily. With
  these preparations complete he went on to the side of the building and saw
  the smithy.</p>

  <p>His worst anticipation was realized at once. The crowd was there, and with
  a vengeance. It was not gathered densely around the smithy. Indeed, not half
  a dozen were near the place. But people were everywhere where a good view
  could be obtained. In the windows of the houses across the street many faces
  moved. A little farther up the street there was a crowd of horses around the
  verandah of the hotel. And he could see what this meant. If they could not
  prevent the fight, the men of the town were determined to revenge any wanton
  killing. That, again, would complicate his own work, but not, he hoped, very
  greatly. He sauntered to the front of the blacksmith shop. There was young
  Bob Mundy. There was no mistaking him. In his working clothes he was as
  distinctive, compared with the other workers, as was his sister compared with
  all the other women whom the gambler had known.</p>

  <p>"Are you Bob Mundy?" asked the newcomer from the doorway.</p>

  <p>At his voice, a worker in the rear of the shop looked up and then hurried
  forward, staring, and Givain knew by his expression that within ten minutes
  he would have remembered the central figure of the most sensational brawl
  that the town had ever known. Within ten minutes&mdash;or ten seconds, just
  according as the wind blew.</p>

  <p>"I'm not Bob Mundy," said the big, thick-shouldered man to whom Givain had
  addressed himself. "There's Bob, over yonder."</p>

  <p>Givain turned to Bob, who was now approaching him. "The devil," groaned
  Givain, "are you Bob Mundy?"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Bob. "Doesn't it please you?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not. I should say not! Why, son, I have money riding on
  you."</p>

  <p>Such insolence brought a gasp from the spectators.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Bob, controlling himself with apparent difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Givain, sauntering boldly nearer, and measuring him up and
  down with contemptuous eyes, "when I heard that a man named Mundy was going
  to fight Richards, I liked the name and took a ten-to-one chance that you'd
  win. And now I see that I'm a fool and a hundred dollars poorer than I might
  have been!"</p>

  <p>He was prepared for the explosion, even then. But Bob was showing rare new
  metal this morning. He had his mind fixed on graver trouble than this quarrel
  could possibly be, so it seemed.</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to hear that explained," said Mundy, and waited, tapping his
  chin with a nervous, slender forefinger.</p>

  <p>But all the while a spark of fire was in his eyes. And Givain was
  fascinated. This was the true fighting spirit. He recognized it as brother
  blood.</p>

  <p>"I'll explain," he said brutally. "I came here looking to find a man!"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Instead of a man, I find a kid who only needs to shave twice a month.
  Man? The devil, son, in my part of the country they wouldn't use you for a
  chore boy!"</p>

  <p>An oath spat out from the lips of Mundy, and his hand twitched back for
  his gun, but here the worker who had come from the rear of the shop cried
  out: "Hold on, Bob! I've something to say to this stranger!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; AL RICHARDS ARRIVES</h2>

  <p class="first">The recognition that had been working blindly toward the
  surface of the workman's mind had at last come into full being. There was
  scorn in his eye and anger in the set of his jaw as he now came to confront
  the gambler. And the latter saw that he must use a few priceless seconds or
  else be baffled entirely.</p>

  <p>"Not for a chore boy," he repeated contemptuously to Bob Mundy. "The
  devil, man, Al Richards will turn you over his knee and spank you. You're in
  no danger of being bullet fodder."</p>

  <p>Bob Mundy had endured enough and more than enough to class him with the
  most patient men on that morning. But now, his patience had run out like the
  sand from an hourglass. He uttered a faint moan, that showed the torment
  which he had suffered. Then, without a word, he reached for his gun.</p>

  <p>It had once been said of Larry Givain that in moments of danger he turned
  himself into a bullet. And so he seemed to the bystanders at that moment. So,
  most of all, he seemed to Bob Mundy.</p>

  <p>What he did was simple enough, but the manner in which he did it was
  consummate art. As the fingers of Mundy curled around the handle of his gun,
  Givain was taking one lightning step forward. With the iron-hard edge of his
  open hand he struck Bob on the outer side of the right arm, just where the
  long shoulder muscles slope away to nothing and the biceps are beginning.
  Here there is a deep indentation in a man's arm, with only a shallow
  surfacing of flesh over vital nerves. Against the bone, the blow of Givain
  struck those nerves. The right arm of Mundy was paralyzed instantly for half
  a second, and, before that half second was over, he had been spun around, the
  gun had been snatched from his unnerved fingers, and a foot planted in the
  small of his back had kicked him headlong, so that he ran a few long strides,
  stumbled over an iron fragment, and then pitched upon his face.</p>

  <p>Any scientific wrestler could have done things more marvelous, but the
  speed of Givain was reinforced by the magnificent carelessness of his
  demeanor. He turned now deliberately on his heel and sauntered toward the
  door of the shop.</p>

  <p>"In my part of the country," he told the dumbfounded men, "that's the way
  we treat the boys when they begin to talk too loud!"</p>

  <p>But here his poise was shattered by the voice of the workman crying:
  "Don't let him get away! It's Givain! It's the crooked gambler, Givain!"</p>

  <p>Like a spur pricking, it started Givain into full speed. It started the
  others into motion behind him. Not a man there but had heard of the
  spectacular poker game, and how the culprit had been apprehended by the
  town's best and bravest, and how he had, afterward, slipped through their
  fingers like fluid sand.</p>

  <p>All these things were at work in them. But, most of all, they ran because
  Larry Givain fled before them. And he fled like a rabbit that has felt the
  breath of the greyhound, panting behind it.</p>

  <p>He swerved away from the door of the shop. He saw before him three
  stalwarts, fumbling for guns with their right hands and stretching out their
  left hands to seize him. He chose the central figure, gave him a piston-
  shooting fist as he came near, then shot on through the gap that the fellow's
  fall made, stepping once on soft flesh and then dashing away over the sand
  again.</p>

  <p>Someone behind tried a snap shot. It chipped a comer off the post office
  wall as Givain darted around it. He made for Sally like a badly frightened
  rabbit, indeed, and, just as the head of the pursuit shot around the edge of
  the post office, he reached her.</p>

  <p>Good horse! She was trembling with eagerness the instant she saw him
  coming. For he had taught her a hundred times how to act, which was to turn
  away from her master as though she would abandon him in time of need, to turn
  away and begin to canter softly, with her head well held around so that the
  dragging reins would not entangle her feet. In this way she had gathered
  headway, and Givain, rushing beside her, mounted like a circus performer. He
  simply hurled himself through the air, gripped mane and pommel, and so
  dragged himself into place, and, before he was fairly on her, he was jammed
  back into the saddle by the pressure of her speed as she gathered incredible
  headway.</p>

  <p>In three strides she was away at full speed, like a racer leaving the
  post. And behind her the crowd of the pursuit was snatched into an
  ineffectual distance. One or two random shots were fired, but that was all.
  Men were not quite sure whether or not it was lawful to fire at a man who was
  wanted for cheating and for nothing of more serious moment. Some of the crowd
  stopped to stare at the gymnastic feats of the fugitive as he gained his
  horse, running at well-nigh full speed. Others turned and ran for their
  horses. But all paused to behold young Bob Mundy, his face contorted with
  unspeakable rage, the brim of his sombrero blown sheer up from his face, a
  revolver clasped in one hand and the reins of his speeding horse in the
  other, dash through their midst on his gray gelding, famous through all the
  country for its matchless speed.</p>

  <p>There was death in the face of Bob. When a man has been shamed to a
  certain point, he no longer blushes, but begins to lose color, and Bob was
  white as the sands over which he was sprinting his horse now.</p>

  <p>Instead of trying to join in a pursuit in which they knew that they would
  be outdistanced, men began to rush for points of vantage to behold the race.
  They climbed trees. They hurried to the tops of the nearest hills. They
  clambered upon rooftops, and from these high points they observed the pair
  sweep away toward the far-off desert horizon, swinging up and down over the
  rolling sand like a pair of stormy petrels over the waves.</p>

  <p>"But the gray don't gain!" they called to one another. "Bob Mundy's
  Captain is plumb beat!"</p>

  <p>And beaten, indeed, the Captain was. Strain and labor as he would, that
  streaking mare shot away before him and opened a widening gap. Slowly it grew
  at first, but after the mile had gone, she began to stream away like a piece
  of cloud blown on the wind, while the gelding labored sullenly, manifestly
  beaten, behind.</p>

  <p>They had hardly turned from the observation of this exciting race, as the
  mare faded into the horizon, when Rose Mundy arrived. What was it all about?
  They told her. She listened with astonishment, with anger, and then with a
  glint of understanding in her eyes, to be followed with more wonder of a
  deeper dye.</p>

  <p>"What a man," she breathed at last. "Why, he sifted through the whole
  crowd of you like a grown man through a lot of boys."</p>

  <p>"He took us by surprise," they told her sullenly. "Let him come back, and
  we'll be ready for him&mdash;we'll show him then!"</p>

  <p>But Rose understood so well that her heart was brimming over with
  thankfulness. This was the strange way her rescuer had chosen to do his
  work&mdash;to drag her brother away to follow an irresistibly tempting bait.
  Somehow, it matched with the flickering will-o'-the-wisp fire that she had
  seen in the eyes of Larry Givain the night before, in the house.</p>

  <p>"Besides," said someone in the crowd, "you can't expect us to match a
  crooked gambler. It takes a crook to beat a crook, you know, and I guess
  we're a shade too honest to deal with this Givain."</p>

  <p>"A crooked gambler?" echoed the girl. "Why, he's a cowpuncher who works
  with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She got no further than that. There was an uproar of laughter, for they
  were all rejoiced to have turned the tables on her.</p>

  <p>"Cowpuncher? Him? Ever see such hands on a cowpuncher?"</p>

  <p>She remembered, then, those remarkably slim and delicately made hands of
  Larry Givain. They would have done credit to a woman, except that there was
  little flesh upon them. And this explained, too, the aloof and restless
  manner of the man, and the strange way he had of looking at her that had
  reminded her so strongly of something in fear or about to become dangerous.
  It was simply the look of a man who lived outside the law.</p>

  <p>"Where's the kid?" called a heavy voice.</p>

  <p>The group in front of the blacksmith shop turned and saw, advancing toward
  them, the badman of badmen, the destroyer of destroyers, Al Richards himself.
  On the farther side of the street he had left his horse, hardly less famous
  than himself, not for brilliant speed such as the Sally of the gambler, but
  for dogged and incomparable powers of resistance that enabled him to plod on
  for hours at unbroken dog-trot, if his master so willed it. He was an ugly
  brute of a horse, with bony, projecting hips, and a sharp ridge of backbone
  and a pot- handle belly and big shambling feet and an ewe neck and a huge,
  misshapen head with an ugly Roman nose and little, brutal, wicked eyes,
  glittering under a great brush of forelock. He matched his master in
  ungainliness.</p>

  <p>Al Richards was dressed like a miner, which was his chosen profession. The
  reason he did not work as a cowpuncher, it was said, was because of his
  build. His short legs were further diminished in gripping power by the fact
  that they were oddly bowed out. They were made for strength, rather than for
  beauty, and their strength was required to support the unwieldy bulk of his
  body. Above the hips, in chest and arms and huge throat, he was like a
  gorilla. His face, however, was well-featured, almost handsome, except that
  there was a peculiarly animal flare to the nostrils and that the eyes had a
  brute boldness, a sort of flat look, into which no glance could penetrate in
  order to make out the workings of the mind beneath them.</p>

  <p>"Where's the kid?" he repeated, as he came forward. "Where's the
  blacksmith that's going to chew up poor old Al Richards?" He accompanied that
  speech with a loud laughter, and at the same time his eyes glanced swiftly
  over the faces of the crowd, drinking in their horror, their anger, their
  fear, as another man would have drunk in words and looks of the profoundest
  admiration. "He don't seem to have waited for me," he said, grinning. "Kind
  of looks to poor old Al Richards like the boy had some business that took him
  some place else." And he laughed again, gloating over his prowess and that
  dreadful name of his that struck men down long before he came on them.</p>

  <p>"He was waiting for you," said Rose Mundy suddenly, when she could endure
  the shame of her brother no longer. "He was waiting, but he was insulted by
  another man and has chased him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Insulted by another man? Ain't I enough of a fight for him in one day?
  Has he got to go around hunting up trouble in other places?" His voice had
  become like the voice of a bull.</p>

  <p>"He'll be back to face you&mdash;if there were ten men with you," said
  Rose Mundy, shivering with her horror of the man.</p>

  <p>"He'll be back? Well, I can't wait for him to come. I'm just that plumb
  anxious to find him that I got to go out and camp on his trail until maybe my
  old Joe hoss gets up to him. And then him and me can have a little talk all
  by ourselves and settle these things between us quiet and proper, like
  gentlemen should. That's my way, always&mdash;a little talk, quiet and
  proper, to set all things right."</p>

  <p>He chuckled, like a brooding growl of a beast of prey, and he ran his
  brute eyes slowly back and forth across the faces of the men as if hunting
  half in despair for some remonstrance, some opposition among them.</p>

  <p>Still they shrank from him as though there were leprosy in his very
  breath.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; GETTING THE DROP ON BOB</h2>

  <p class="first">For five miles the gambler had been the hunter and not the
  hunted. He had trailed softly and easily behind the weary gray gelding, while
  the master of the gray forced his staggering horse relentlessly on into the
  desert. It was as though the younger rider had determined, like a child,
  either to find his enemy or kill his horse, and, while he had not a chance of
  succeeding in capturing the gambler, he was in an excellent way of destroying
  the honest Captain.</p>

  <p>But at length, by the grace of blind fortune and not through any skill of
  his own, he found a patch of grass growing around a spring and a feeble
  trickle of water. Here was water, the prime necessity for himself. And here
  was water and fodder for his gallant gray. But as for food for himself, he
  had not brought a crumb of it.</p>

  <p>Larry Givain, sheltered comfortably behind some rocks on a neighboring
  hill crest, looked down on the scene with a grim smile and a shrug of the
  shoulders. For his own part, he had long since learned never to leave his
  saddlebags unstored with certain light and highly concentrated nourishment.
  Parched corn, some dried raisins, a little coffee, and salt were always at
  his command, at the very least, and with these be could defy hunger for many
  days.</p>

  <p>But he now saw that the blacksmith, although hot-headed, was not actually
  cruel or neglectful. When he finally saw that he could not press on any
  longer through the thickening evening and on the back of an exhausted horse,
  he dismounted by the spring, allowed the hot gelding only a small swallow of
  the water, and then unsaddled his mount. With a twig from a tough mesquite he
  whipped the sweat off the horse, rubbing him down with even more care that
  the gambler usually showed to Sally. But, perhaps, that was because Sally was
  tough as wrought iron and resisted weather and winds and temperatures with
  equal indifference.</p>

  <p>After he had assured himself of the comfort of the gelding and hobbled
  him, there was nothing left for him to do for himself. He rolled himself
  wretchedly in a slicker&mdash;cold comfort in that for a desert
  night&mdash;and stretched out, prepared to endure the worst. But a long night
  it promised to be for poor Bob Mundy.</p>

  <p>Sleep came slowly to him. He tossed and twisted here and there, and the
  patient gambler, watching from above through the dim twilight, knew that
  pangs of rage with minglings of shame and pangs of hatred were disturbing the
  younger man. But at last he lay still, and Larry Givain went down the slope
  to capture the enemy.</p>

  <p>He sat down on a stone beside the sleeper and touched him with his foot,
  and Bob Mundy, leaping to his feet, found himself confronted with the all-
  expressive mouth of a revolver held in a steady and yet very casual hand. And
  above that gun was the face of the man he had been hating with all his soul
  that afternoon. The hatred leaped back upon him and took him by the throat,
  so to speak. It set him trembling. It was all he could do to keep himself
  from leaping straight at his enemy.</p>

  <p>"Turn around," commanded Givain.</p>

  <p>The other obeyed.</p>

  <p>"By the heavens, you went to sleep without a gun on you!"</p>

  <p>The other turned back on him, in silence.</p>

  <p>"The devil," said Givain, "you aren't a man&mdash;you're a baby! Man?
  You're a selfish young jackass, that's all!"</p>

  <p>"You rat-faced skunk of a crooked gambler," said the blacksmith with
  coldly calculated and deliberate insult, "what you think of me makes no
  difference at all! If you've come here to murder me, pull the trigger. I
  won't beg off! Not if that's what you're waiting for!"</p>

  <p>"A fool," said Givain meditatively. "Not only a fool, but a selfish
  one!"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," said the boy hoarsely. "If you think you can sit there and
  insult me, you're mistaken. I'll run in on you and your gun, and either get
  you or else be gotten!"</p>

  <p>It was not a sham. Even the dim light of the evening could not hide from
  the gambler the berserk madness in the face of his companion.</p>

  <p>"You have nerve," said the gambler calmly, "I admit that."</p>

  <p>"I don't care a damn what you admit!"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. But you will after a while. Do you know why I came to you
  today?"</p>

  <p>"Because you're a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Easy on that. I'm mild-tempered, Mundy, up to a certain point, and after
  that&mdash;but to come to what I started to say, I came to you to get you out
  of that town and away from our mutual friend, Al Richards. I hadn't a chance
  to try to persuade you. I'm too well known in that village and able to raise
  a mob on my own account in a moment's notice, as you saw for yourself." And
  he chuckled at the memory.</p>

  <p>"People are queer in my town," admitted the blacksmith sarcastically.
  "They hate a crooked gambler worse than they hate a snake."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Givain smoothly. "But to come back to yourself. I had to
  get you out of town. There was really no other way than to make you hate me
  worse than you hated Richards. And that was what I did."</p>

  <p>"D'you think you can pull me off your trail?" sneeringly replied young Bob
  Mundy.</p>

  <p>"You blockhead!" cried Givain. "D'you imagine that I fear what you can do?
  Because you've manhandled a few old men and young idiots, do you think that
  you're a man? Al Richards would have eaten you up!"</p>

  <p>"At least he'd've found me waiting! Besides, every man has a chance with
  every other man, when it comes to guns! If you doubt that, let me get my gun,
  and we'll fight it out right here and now!"</p>

  <p>His voice trembled with eagerness, but Givain laughed.</p>

  <p>"Here's my matches," he said. "Rake a fire together. Don't go near your
  saddle and your guns, though, or I'll shoot without warning, Mundy."</p>

  <p>"I know your kind," said Bob, and went away to execute the order. He got
  fairly out of range of the revolver, considering the darkness of the night,
  now, but he could not bolt and run for it without leaving the gray gelding
  behind him, and the gray meant as much to Bob as his own life. So presently
  he came back with a huge load of dried shrubbery and heaped it up, touched a
  match to it, and the flame was instantly soaring and making the good Captain
  toss his head and snort with fear, while the two big eyes were turning into
  balls of reflected fire.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Givain, "I'm going to show you something. You see that black
  rock with the point sticking up?"</p>

  <p>"I see it."</p>

  <p>"Watch the point."</p>

  <p>He tossed up the muzzle of the gun and fired almost without taking aim, so
  it seemed. The point was clipped squarely off the rock. There was a gasp from
  Bob Mundy.</p>

  <p>"Anybody can hit a stationary target," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Throw that white stone into the air."</p>

  <p>Bob Mundy tossed it twenty feet high, and, as it hung in the zenith of its
  rise, the gambler fired, and the little stone was jerked away into
  nothingness. Presently a fine shower of sand puffed down upon them.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Bob Mundy, "you can shoot, right enough." And he said it
  reverently, as one who understands the importance of gun play well
  enough.</p>

  <p>"I can shoot," admitted the gambler, without overdue modesty and yet
  without excitement. "But I'm not a patch on Al Richards. Listen to me, Mundy.
  If I faced a hangman with a rope around my neck, I'd feel as much hope for
  life as if I faced Al Richards with a gun in my hand and a gun in his
  hand."</p>

  <p>And he put up his weapon. Bob Mundy gazed upon him in utter wonder.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said slowly, thinking aloud, as it were. "You really don't
  need to have that gun out to have me in your power. And&mdash;I guess you're
  right. I guess that I have been a fool." He groaned out the words.</p>

  <p>"You've been a fool to start with," said the gambler. "But the start isn't
  the finish."</p>

  <p>"Givain, what made you start to get me away from Al Richards?"</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter. The question is, what are we to do with Al Richards
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tend to him later on."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you'll go back and let yourself be killed?"</p>

  <p>Bob Mundy was silent.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a question of chance," said Givain. "I met Al Richards once
  before."</p>

  <p>"You did!"</p>

  <p>The gambler hesitated. Then: "I'm the only man who ever wounded him in a
  fair fight," he said soberly at last, "and I'm the only man that ever faced
  him in single fight and got away with his life. But&mdash;I'm not proud of
  it. Luck helped me out."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"His gun hung a little in the holster. My slug glanced off his skull. I
  thought he was dead, when I left him. But the dead man started walking again.
  The only thing that has saved my life is that he doesn't know my name, or how
  to ask after me. I met him by night.</p>

  <p>"There was another silence.</p>

  <p>"It seems," said Mundy, "that we're in the same boat, and neither of us
  can paddle."</p>

  <p>"And what we have to do," said the gambler, "is find a way to shore."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; A COCK-AND-BULL STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">They talked until the dawn began in the gray east. And by
  that time the younger man had agreed to do what the elder advised, and that
  was to put his shame in his pocket and stay away from home for a few
  days.</p>

  <p>"Because, inside of that time," Givain assured him, "Al will have
  forgotten all about you. He'll have another trouble in his mind and be off
  across the mountains in one direction or another. You can depend on that.
  I've known the brute and the brute's mind for a long time."</p>

  <p>He could hardly believe his ears when young Mundy agreed. He would not
  make a pretense about it, however, he said. He would go over to the mountains
  and write home that he would be gone for three days, simply because he wanted
  to dodge Richards. If, at the end of that time, Richards was still in the
  town, he would face him on his return. It was rather a shorter space than the
  gambler had hoped for, but he had to content himself with what he had gained
  without pushing the point.</p>

  <p>"But will you tell me," asked young Mundy, "what makes you do all of this
  on account of me?"</p>

  <p>"Because when I heard of your meeting that was to be with Richards, I
  decided that something had to be done about it. I knew how it would turn
  out. . . with another grave in the town cemetery and another notch in Al's
  gun butt. Did you ever see that gun butt?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Bob Mundy.</p>

  <p>"It looks like the mouth of an old dog, full of short teeth."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">
  So it was that they parted. Mundy would have had his new companion ride on
  the way with him. But Givain insisted that he had work ahead for himself. He
  watched Mundy disappear into the north. Then he swung sharply around and went
  south.</p>

  <p>It was in the sunset that he came on the town, and, just as he glimpsed
  it, he found the person in all the world whom he most desired to meet. And
  that was Rose Mundy, cantering slowly across a hill edge against the sky, and
  seeming to float into it with every upward sway of her horse. Sally might
  have had an excuse as a very weary horse, but one word from her master sent
  her away like a swallow. She dipped over the hills and cut across the path of
  Rose Mundy on the side of the third. Givain stopped her with a touch of his
  knee and swept off his hat cavalierly.</p>

  <p>Rose Mundy drew rein with a jerk and a gasp. "Oh, Larry Givain!" she cried
  to him. "Where is my brother?"</p>

  <p>"Riding north, comfortably out of danger," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's like those other stories you told me last night about yourself'
  and Jim."</p>

  <p>"Why are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Bob Mundy would never turn his back on a danger."</p>

  <p>"He could not be persuaded?"</p>

  <p>"Never, except with iron chains."</p>

  <p>I persuaded him&mdash;with only words," said Larry Givain, and smiled at
  her so frankly that the color came back a little into her face. She was even
  able to smile faintly back at him.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"I showed him it was foolish to face such a murderer as Richards."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't convince my brother of that."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I did."</p>

  <p>"How did you argue it?"</p>

  <p>Her head was high, now, and her eyes shining with indignation at the
  thought that her brother might have showed fear.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want your brother to meet Richards?" he said. "Only last
  night you seemed to want nothing less in the whole wide world."</p>

  <p>"Only last night," she said, "I was out of my head with terror, but today
  I know that there is one thing worse than everything else in the world for a
  man, and that is to lose his honor."</p>

  <p>"Do you think they will taunt him in the village for turning his back on
  Richards?"</p>

  <p>"He will taunt himself&mdash;it will be a torture to me. You
  <i>could</i>not persuade him?"</p>

  <p>"I did, however. I told him, for one thing, that I had run away from
  Richards myself."</p>

  <p>She was abruptly silenced, but she began to regard him darkly. "That's
  another thing I can't believe. You wouldn't fear a thing in the world."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" he said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, how could you have done the wild, crazy suicidal thing you did
  for my brother?"</p>

  <p>"That was only a game."</p>

  <p>"And is it only a game, coming back to this town where a score of men are
  hungry to get at you?"</p>

  <p>"One must take a chance, now and then."</p>

  <p>"There is something on your mind. Did you&mdash;did you come here simply
  to bring the tale that poor Bob is safe? Oh, if he were to come to harm, I
  should die."</p>

  <p>"Rather dishonor for him than that?"</p>

  <p>"Rather anything."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Givain smilingly, "that you are logical."</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she said. "I don't care for anything, except that Bob must
  not be hurt."</p>

  <p>"Not even for Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" she laughed at him. "Do you still believe that cock-and-bull story?
  Jim is nothing to me. I've never seen him in my life."</p>

  <p>Givain clasped the pommel of his saddle, and, thus steadied, he stared out
  at her from beneath his sombrero. And it seemed to him that a cooling wind
  touched upon his face and made his blood jump.</p>

  <p>"I knew that my best friend was engaged to a fighting man. I went to her
  to have her enlist him. She was sick, but she sent me out to him with that
  picture of him that she wore. That was why I carried it. Simply as a sort of
  passport from his lady to him to carry me into his confidence. But when I got
  there&mdash;I found that my sham was shown to another sham."</p>

  <p>And she laughed again, whole-heartedly, her eyes dancing. As for the
  gambler, his head was singing with a thousand new and sudden hopes.</p>

  <p>"But, oh," she said, "if you had not done that wild thing yesterday, poor
  Bob would be a dead man now, and that great brute would not be lurking yonder
  in the old house."</p>

  <p>"Richards?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! That horrible creature. My blood runs cold when I think of
  him." And she pointed to a rambling old house that ran up one side of a hill,
  the highest hill in the town.</p>

  <p>"They say it's haunted," she said. "But what do ghosts matter to that
  demon? He's living there, and says he'll stay there forever, unless Bob comes
  back. You see he started out to get Bob, but he lost the trail and returned
  to wait it out.</p>

  <p>"So Richards is waiting there?" Givain murmured. And he stared vaguely up
  to the house. It had once housed a large family, no doubt. Now this great
  wolf of a man had crouched there like a beast in a den, waiting for his prey
  to come within leaping distance. He stared harder, and it seemed to him that
  he could make out the outlines of the ugly mustang, ranging near the
  building.</p>

  <p>All his presuppositions were upset, then. There was nothing in what he had
  told young Bob Mundy and had half hoped might be true. Richards had come to
  stay, and now he was feeding on the notoriety of his position. It was manna
  and honey to him. Every day he would be stared at. Every day hundreds would
  talk about him. Every day the little children would flee from him, as he rode
  through the streets of the town. And there was a touch of consummate craft
  and artistry in thus barring the youngster from his home village.</p>

  <p>Of course, the moment that such tidings came to young Bob Mundy, he would
  come down like a storm to meet his death. But, in the meantime, there would
  be surely a full three days. Three days in which to move Al Richards from
  that house and send him headlong out of the town and never to return. It was
  like moving a mountain, that picture of effort to the gambler.</p>

  <p>He found that the girl was studying him seriously.</p>

  <p>"What wild scheme is in your head, now?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"Another game."</p>

  <p>"Not for Bob's sake. You've risked enough for him."</p>

  <p>"Not for his sake," he answered, and looked at her just as steadily.</p>

  <p>She flushed, but shook her head violently. "You mustn't be&mdash;foolish,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"I always play safe," said the gambler with a touch of bitterness. "I
  suppose you've heard that about my games?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard&mdash;that you're a strange fellow;" she admitted.
  "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I take people as I find them."</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven for that!" He spoke so fervently that she flushed still
  more.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," he said, "that Richards were to be persuaded to leave that
  house and never come back?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, if this were in a fairy tale, there would be half a kingdom for the
  hero, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she said, "half a kingdom, at least."</p>

  <p>"And what else?"</p>

  <p>"It is hardly safe to say," said Rose, and yet she was not too embarrassed
  for laughter.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the gambler, "of course, that is something that no one can
  ever do."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"The only person who could beat Richards would have to be a greater brute
  than he. He isn't a man. He hasn't a man's nerve or a man's weaknesses."</p>

  <p>"And yet," she pondered, "Achilles had one vulnerable heel. Somewhere
  there is a flaw in the armor. And that's the thing to aim at. Once the flaw
  is found, the spear will go through."</p>

  <p>"But who can stay near such a brute long enough to discover what
  weaknesses are in his mind? For, I suppose, that's what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"And yet," muttered Givain to himself more than to her, "there must be a
  way of studying it out. Except that the time is terribly short&mdash;short.
  And young Mundy will be coming back again."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man is the sheriff?."</p>

  <p>"The flaw in <i>his</i> armor is horses," she told him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A VISIT TO THE SHERIFF</h2>

  <p class="first">When he watched her go, a few minutes later, it hardly
  seemed possible that he could have let her escape so easily. But, after all,
  she had said all that he most wished to hear. Although she were half in jest,
  she was half in earnest also, when she hinted that, if Al Richards were
  routed out of the town, never to return, she would marry the hero who had
  conquered the giant.</p>

  <p>And most like a giant to a boy did Al Richards seem to the gambler as he
  cantered his horse along the side of the hill and looked up to the gloomy and
  staggering old house which crowned it. But it was not to survey the house or
  to encounter the giant that he rode in that direction. He wound around the
  hill and went on through the outskirts of the town until he came in sight of
  Sheriff Campton's house. He remembered having looked it up of old, on his
  first and most famous visit to the town. He found the place in the gathering
  dusk. A lamp was lighted in one window, and, when he looked through, he saw
  the sheriff sitting alone, a long and sprawling man, stretched out in a
  rocking chair that was tilted far back on the ends of the runners. His feet
  rested on another chair&mdash;long, ungainly feet. His body was hunched in
  the rocking chair so that he looked more like a poorly stuffed image than a
  real human being. The gambler could not help smiling as he regarded the man
  of the law.</p>

  <p>Then he went boldly to the front door, knocked, and waited. As he
  expected, the sheriff himself opened to him, and, shading his eyes to peer
  into the wall of dusk, he stared at his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Who might you be, stranger?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm Larry Givain," said the gambler.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" gasped out the sheriff. "What brings you down here?"</p>

  <p>"Two things," said the gambler. "The first is to have a talk with the
  sheriff, and the second thing is to borrow a feed of oats for my horse,
  Sally, while I talk with you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned!" exclaimed the sheriff." But he added, to the
  surprise of the other: "What makes you think that I keep oats and not
  barley?"</p>

  <p>"No real horseman feeds barley," said Givain calmly.</p>

  <p>The sheriff swore again, but there was a touch of gratification in his
  voice. "I'm giving comfort and aid to the enemies of the law," he said
  growlingly to Givain, "but I never yet turned a hungry man away from my door,
  and I'm damned if I'll turn a hungry hoss, either. Come along, Givain, and
  let's have a look at this Sally hoss. The town ain't talking of much else
  besides her, just now."</p>

  <p>He went out behind his guest. Under the trees Givain called, and Sally
  came softly to his side. The sheriff said not a word. Neither did he walk
  curiously around her. But having stared at her bright eyes for a time, he
  turned abruptly upon his heel and strode away through the dark, telling
  Givain to follow him.</p>

  <p>The sheriff led them into a small stable, so well kept that it was
  fragrant with sweet hay. He opened a door upon a box stall and pointed
  inside, and then he tossed in a bundle of straw so that Givain could bed down
  his favorite. He climbed into the loft and gave her hay with his own fork,
  and he brought out a measure of oats for her. Givain divided the portion in
  two.</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> isn't used to high fare," he said. "It might upset her
  stomach. A thistle and a bit of dead grass is all she expects."</p>

  <p>"Made like a Thoroughbred and tough as a mustang," commented the sheriff.
  "I've dreamed of hosses like that kind all my life, and I've tried to get 'em
  by crossing breeds and by careful raising. But it wasn't no good. A good hoss
  is like a great man. You never can tell when they'll spring up."</p>

  <p>They went back to the house and sat down with their cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"But," said the sheriff suddenly, "what the devil would folks think, if
  they looked in and saw me here with you? And what do <i>you</i> want with me
  now that your hoss is fed?"</p>

  <p>"I've come to make a bargain."</p>

  <p>"To make a bargain you've got to have something I want."</p>

  <p>"I have," said Givain.</p>

  <p>"Only your freedom," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"You're wrong. I can try to get rid of a man you'd much rather see go than
  myself. I mean Al Richards!"</p>

  <p>"What the devil," murmured the sheriff. "D'you mean that you'd have
  anything to do with Al Richards for love or money?"</p>

  <p>"For neither," said Givain not quite truthfully. "But he and I have an old
  grudge against one another."</p>

  <p>"I know," said the sheriff. "Richards has been talking about it. When he
  heard how you had been to town before him, he said it was not the first time
  you had crossed his path. He told how his gun had stuck in the holster, and
  how that let you beat him. He told how he's been chasing you ever since."</p>

  <p>"That," said Givain, with a strange lifting of his upper lip, "was mighty
  kind of him. Well, Sheriff, I don't like to be chased by any man except by a
  sheriff, with his badge on, and all that."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Campton, grinning.</p>

  <p>"What I want you to do is to make me free in this town three days from
  now."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"If I were to appear in the streets now, what would happen?"</p>

  <p>"More things than you could count, I guess."</p>

  <p>"I want you to let 'em know that three days from today, in the morning at
  eleven o'clock, I'm not to be molested, when I ride into town and head for
  the blacksmith shop of Bob Mundy. Tell them that I've heard how Richards is
  talking, and that I've beaten him once, and that I swear that I can beat him
  again. I'm to be allowed liberty to ride freely to that blacksmith shop and
  have it out with Richards. Will you spread that word around?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff merely gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"You get rid of one of us for good and forever," said Givain. "Maybe you
  get rid of both of us. What I'm asking you to do is to spread the news around
  the town."</p>

  <p>The sheriff rose, walked a gangling stride through the room, then turned,
  and laid his great hand upon the head of Givain.</p>

  <p>"What game have you planned?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff, I have to get Richards out of this town."</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"It does, though. I've got to know."</p>

  <p>"For a girl, then," said Givain, and neither flushed nor smiled.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the sheriff. "Ah! I might've knowed that Rose Mundy's smile
  would be behind this deviltry some place. I never could make out whether the
  smiling of Rose or the fighting of Bob would be doing the most harm in this
  world. But now I see what's what. He ain't armed with even a paper knife
  compared to her. She's sending you to get killed by Richards?"</p>

  <p>"I said nothing of that," said Givain angrily. "I haven't mentioned the
  lady's name!"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," said the sheriff. "If I was ten years younger, I'd be a fool
  about Rose, too. Well, well&mdash;the young men hunt the pretty faces, and
  not what's behind the faces&mdash;so go your own way to the devil and
  trouble, Givain."</p>

  <p>"What of the message?"</p>

  <p>"Message?" The sheriff ran his fingers through his sparse hair and,
  thereby, made it stand straight up on end. "You couldn't be headed off?" he
  said plaintively. "Because what would become of Sally once you was gone?"</p>

  <p>"I leave her to the best horseman I know&mdash;to Sheriff Campton!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff turned a fiery red. He clasped his great bony hands
  together.</p>

  <p>"Man, man," he murmured, "don't be talking any faster than you mean."</p>

  <p>"Every word is the straight truth and nothing but the truth."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the sheriff with a great sigh, "Sally aside, I think I got to
  spread that news around. It'll make a lot of talk. And if you're bound to be
  a fool, you can ride into town safe enough on a morning three days from
  this."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; RICHARDS AND THE INTERLOCUTOR</h2>

  <p class="first">It was news of such a quality which the sheriff had to
  spread that in half an hour the entire town had heard of it. He had merely to
  step from his house and pass on the tidings to one person. But the person the
  sheriff selected, after he had bid the gambler good bye, was chosen with
  wonderful care and forethought.</p>

  <p>He watched Givain out of sight, and then he walked up the street and
  rapped at the door of a house perhaps a hundred yards from his own. He rapped
  not at the front door, but to the rear, where the light of the kitchen lamp
  and the fragrance from the kitchen announced that supper was in
  preparation.</p>

  <p>A large woman, red-faced from many leanings over the hot stove, opened the
  door to him. Under one armpit was tucked the cloth with which she had been
  opening the oven. She was meditatively licking a finger of her hand that had
  been burned in the last adventure with the erratic oven door. At sight of the
  sheriff the frown of irritation was smoothed away. "If it ain't the sheriff!"
  she cried, half mining her head so that her voice would pass resonantly
  throughout the house and perhaps reach the envious ears of Mrs. Murphy in the
  adjoining shack. "If it ain't the sheriff, and just in time to have
  supper."</p>

  <p>"I ain't for supper, ma'am," said the sheriff, as he doffed his hat to her
  and, thereby, pulled a struggling gray hair forelock across his brown
  forehead. "I ain't for supper, but I just chanced over to ask if you happened
  to have a mite of salt to spare. Dog-gone me, if I ain't plumb run out!"</p>

  <p>"I got a whole barrelful," said Mrs. Snyder kindly. "Now ain't it like a
  man to order everything, except what's needed most of all for his cooking.
  I'll have you a snack of salt fixed in a jiffy, Sheriff." And she poured some
  into a cup and gave it to him.</p>

  <p>"But food is going to waste in this house this night, Sheriff," she
  assured him as she gave him the package. "I got more'n my man and my boys
  could ever in goodness eat up, and just room for another hearty eater at the
  far end of my table&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I got my own dinner, warming up on the stove," said the sheriff, lying
  with perfect smoothness. "I'll be getting on back before things burn all
  up."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Mrs. Snyder, following him a step through the door,
  "these are busy times with you, Sheriff, what with all the carrying on in
  this here town."</p>

  <p>"What carrying on?" asked the sheriff, with the bland eye of an innocent
  child.</p>

  <p>"What carrying on?" she cried. "Why, with young Bob Mundy run out of town,
  and maybe murdered by that horrible gambler, and then this man-murdering
  Richards come to set right down amongst us&mdash;don't you call that
  something worth talking about?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff raised his eyebrows noncommittally. "I dunno that I been
  paying much attention to that for the last hour," he said. "Other news just
  come in."</p>

  <p>"Other news?" gasped out Mrs. Snyder. And she panted with eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Yep. Just had word from Givain. He wants a safe conduct into the town
  three days from this, in the morning, at eleven o'clock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the name of goodness, Sheriff, what's a safe conduct?"</p>

  <p>"It means, he wants to know if he can come safe and sound into town and
  out again."</p>

  <p>"What in land's sake is the rascal thinking of? Of course, you ain't going
  to give it to him?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno that I ain't."</p>

  <p>"Sheriff!"</p>

  <p>"You see, the idea is that he wants to come in at that time to meet Al
  Richards in front of the blacksmith shop that Mundy runs. And, somehow, I
  ain't got the heart to keep them two from fighting it out together." And with
  this he strode away.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Snyder followed him almost to his door, forgetful of the burning
  roast in her oven, forgetful of everything, except that she wanted to know
  details and, above all, whether or not this news had as yet been generally
  spread abroad. She learned that it had not, and with that her cup of
  happiness was full.</p>

  <p>Two minutes later her family was gathered about her, five young sons with
  skins no sun could bum, with eyes brimmed over with deviltry, and her
  husband, who filled seven mouths three times a day and wondered every
  nightfall how he had managed it, And in three minutes more they had the whole
  story, with embroiderings of Mrs. Snyder's own invention. And, shortly
  afterward, seven Snyders were speeding on their way to seven different
  households to tell their story. Like the ripples from around the fallen
  pebble, the news washed through the town. The sheriff had chosen the right
  spot to let fall his talk.</p>

  <p>It came to the ears of big Al Richards, where he sat in front of his
  borrowed house upon the side of the hill. An old man was the only one brave
  enough to carry the message up to him. He arrived in front of the warrior
  just as the latter had finished packing his pipe with plug tobacco, and just
  after Givain had slid into cover under the floor of the rotted verandah. From
  his place he could look out through the lattice work and survey both the tale
  bearer and the destroyer of men.</p>

  <p>He who bore the message was both withered and bent. He went upon tottering
  legs and a crooked cane that shook in his hands, and a perpetual tremor of
  age kept his thin, white beard shivering as though in dread of the death that
  could not be many steps before him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mister Richards," he said, "I see you're enjoying a fine evening
  and a fine pipe by yourself?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Richards eyed the veteran. Then he brought forth a match and scratched
  it on his overalls. Next, he sheltered it between his huge palms while the
  red, reflected light glowed upon his brutal features. When the sulphur fumes
  of the tip of the match had burned away, he held the flaming stick over the
  loaded pipe and drew mightily upon it. The noise of his puffing was like the
  noise of a small engine, and the cords stood out on his great neck and made
  the collar of the loose flannel shirt rise and fall. Finally the pipe was
  ignited, although the wedge of tobacco in it was almost as solid as wood. And
  now he puffed forth a cloud of the brown smoke and glowered upon the
  ancient.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you want?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the other, shrinking back a pace, and then bracing himself
  as he realized that his great feebleness made him as inviolable of violence
  as any weak woman.</p>

  <p>"I don't want nothing," he added, catching his breath and steadying
  himself. "I was just coming up here to pass a word with you and the time of
  the day."</p>

  <p>"You lie," said the monster. "You lie like the devil. You ain't done much
  work as the climbing of this hill for ten years. And you won't climb this far
  again till you go to&mdash; heaven." And he laughed. He was so contented with
  his stern jest that he now wiped the mustaches away from the upper lip and
  looked forth with something approaching to good nature upon the
  octogenarian.</p>

  <p>"What might your name be?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Si Dean."</p>

  <p>"Well, Si, the truth is that you just come up here to have a look at me,
  ain't it?"</p>

  <p>"You're worth seeing, Mister Richards," said the old fellow politely.</p>

  <p>The giant reared up his full bulk. He was not so tall. But in breadth and
  in bulk he was monstrous, indeed, and, as he rose, his huge mustang in the
  neighboring field laid back his ears and snorted with hate.</p>

  <p>"You've seen me and yet you <i>ain't</i> seen me. If you was thirty years
  younger, I'd wring your neck for coming up here to look at me. But seeing as
  you ain't more'n an old goat ready to tumble into a grave, look long and
  hard. You ain't seen my likes before and you ain't going to again. Look at
  this here hand!"</p>

  <p>He thrust forth his left hand, the fingers gnarled with labor and with
  power. The little finger was as stubby and as blunt and as thick as the thumb
  of an average man.</p>

  <p>"Look at that hand! It's worth seeing. That's the hand that throttled Sim
  Harper. Look at this other hand. That's the hand that shot Buck Jerome and
  young Saunders, and Milt Jeffrey and a few more&mdash;a few more&mdash;And
  look here. Here's the gun that dropped 'em. Look at them notches. Them are
  each a dead man. And them other notches you see&mdash;them are&mdash;just
  decorations!" He laughed hugely. "Yep, them are just decorations!" He laughed
  again.</p>

  <p>Si Dean shrank away and held one shaking and claw-like hand before his
  face. Perhaps it was the nearness of those awful paws that made him tremble.
  Perhaps it was the brightness of the revolver. Perhaps it was the dreadful
  truth about this man sinking in upon his soul of souls.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the monster, "now that you've seen, git out and don't come
  back."</p>

  <p>"I got one bit of news for you," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"News," said the giant, resting an immense foot upon a large and jagged
  boulder, "news for <i>me?</i>"</p>

  <p>It was as though he considered it impossible for tidings affecting him to
  come forth from so negligible a source.</p>

  <p>"Yes," quavered Si Dean.</p>

  <p>"What in the devil about?"</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;about&mdash;I'm afraid it will anger you, Mister Richards,"
  Si Dean told him.</p>

  <p>"You old rag-chewer, will you say what you got to say?" Then he added,
  half meditatively: "Or I'll take you by a leg and see how far you would sail
  down the hill."</p>

  <p>Si Dean glanced hastily below him. Down the steep descent were
  ragged-edged stones, like the upturned mouth of a shark. He drew a quick
  breath.</p>

  <p>"It was about a&mdash;a gent that sent a message to the sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"That he was coming to town three days from today, in the morning, at
  eleven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"What of that?"</p>

  <p>"And that he wanted to meet you in front of Bob Mundy's shop."</p>

  <p>"He can find me. Who is he, and what does he want of me?"</p>

  <p>Si Dean shrank to a safer distance. He looked behind and below him again
  at the rocks. They were hard, indeed, and yet how could he resist telling the
  cream of all his story?</p>

  <p>"He's a gent that says that he's tired of hearing so much about the doings
  of Al Richards. He's a gent that says that he licked you once before plumb
  easy, and that he's going to do it again. He's a gent that says they ain't
  nothing to you but your size, and that, when he gets through, you'll be
  whittled down plumb small."</p>

  <p>A tremendous oath tore the throat of Richards. "What's his name?"</p>

  <p>"Givain!" cried the old veteran. And then he cowered halfway to the
  earth.</p>

  <p>There was no violence in Richards for a reply. Instead, as though he had
  forgotten that there was an interlocutor before him on the hillside, he
  lifted his head and then raised up his great hands to the night sky. Light
  from the fire that he had kindled inside the house upon the open hearth shone
  out through the door, however, and struck across his features, as rugged, as
  hard as the rock upon which his foot was based. And in his face there was
  joy, or something akin to joy. His eyes glittered with it. His hands
  trembled. His whole body shook with eagerness.</p>

  <p>"He's coming&mdash;to me&mdash;of his own self," whispered the giant.</p>

  <p>And Si Dean fled, stumbling, for safety.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he did not see what Givain saw. For the latter saw the big man
  lean suddenly, seize the rock upon which a foot had been resting, and tear it
  from its bed. Up it came, all dark beneath, with small, white roots of
  grasses clinging about it, and from the full height of Richards it was dashed
  down upon another boulder. It cracked to a score of splinters, and every
  splinter was a heavy stone that went rolling or flying down the dark
  hillside. Givain heard old Si Dean cry out in feeble terror as a missile went
  hurtling past him. Then another rock rolled farther below, and another
  cracked sharply into a rivulet of water in the bottom of the hollow. After
  that was silence, and the giant dropped his arms.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE HEEL OF ACHILLES</h2>

  <p class="first">There are prodigies that numb the body, the very faculties
  of the mind. And the gambler could not stir in his place of covert after the
  rock had fallen or after this vast mass of muscle and bone and venom had
  strode into the house.</p>

  <p>But then Givain came forth from hiding, slowly, dragging one limb after
  the other with a conscious effort. His mind was full of panics. At every
  whisper of the wind it seemed to him that it was the rushing of the air in
  the clothes of Richards as the latter sped upon him in the dark. And, once
  perceived, he could not fly. There was no strength in his heart to bear him
  up, and there was no strength in his limbs.</p>

  <p>And yet he could have smiled at the irony of this event. For he had
  climbed the hill in the vain, small hope that the girl had been right, that
  this giant had some vulnerable point, that, like Achilles, he had been only
  partially blessed with invincibility to the gods of war, and that he, Givain,
  might spy the weakness out. He had believed that speech of Rose Mundy's
  because he was almost forced to believe it. There was no other hope for
  him.</p>

  <p>But now that he had come and seen Richards, being unseen himself, he had
  discovered a thing that washed away the last of his strength. And he knew
  with a deadly and sickening certainty, not only that he would have no chance
  in battle against Richards, but that he could not even find the wretched
  courage in his soul to go to the place of meeting and die like a man.</p>

  <p>For there was no facing this demon after the scene that Givain had just
  witnessed. It seemed to his shattered imagination that he was being picked up
  in the hands of Al Richards and broken to shards upon the stones. He could
  see his body flattened in the street before the blacksmith shop of Bob
  Mundy.</p>

  <p>Yet his reason did not give up the battle easily. It assured him again and
  again that, big as he was, Richards could be killed as easily as any other
  man by a bullet. It told him that in every, fight there is a chance that a
  good shot and quick draw may kill, and that luck might help him. But, in
  spite of that, the horrible foreboding was fixed in his mind and would not go
  out of it&mdash;he had two days and three nights to live, and on the third
  morning he was to die at eleven o'clock in front of Bob Mundy's shop. And as
  he thought of that, the whole affair became dream-like to him. He could see
  his first meeting with the girl in Jim's house like events dimly
  pictured&mdash;pictures out of a story book, and no flesh and blood
  reality.</p>

  <p>Then he went slowly, very slowly, down the hill, aching with terror lest
  his foot should displace a stone and that small noise bring the monster
  flying down after him.</p>

  <p>That was the first night of Givain's vigil. The second night he came up
  again and saw Al Richards ride out early and saw him come home again late,
  drunk. And he seemed to Givain, as the latter stole to the window and looked
  in upon him, lighting the fire upon the hearth, like a great, fire-breathing
  dragon out of some fairy tale. As for the wood for the fire, he tore boards
  from the walls of the room and pitched them, crashing upon the hearth. They
  smashed upon the fire and cast out big showers of sparks. Ah, would that one
  of those sparks might start a conflagration which would instantly involve the
  house in flames and burn with it the evil spirit that now dwelt there.</p>

  <p>But he waited for no more. Instead, he turned sick at heart and went down
  the hill and to his sleep for the night. But he could not sleep. He sat up
  beside his small fire among the woods and hugged his knees and looked at his
  death in the darkness until Sally came and put her soft muzzle upon his
  shoulder and nibbled carefully at his ear.</p>

  <p>Yet once more crouched outside the house, he waited and watched the
  movements of Richards until, finally, the big man kicked off his boots, threw
  his blankets on the floor near the fire, and jerked open his shirt at the
  throat preparatory to sleeping. But, as he did so, he appeared to break a
  thread that was tied about his neck. Something bright and yellow was flicked
  from his bosom and rattled on the floor, and Richards uttered a cry of horror
  and of fear. He stood like a child, seeing a ghost, his eyes dilated and his
  hands extended with stiff fingers. Then he dropped upon his knees and began
  to search the floor, groaning with dread. He tore up the boards with his
  steel- like fingers for wedges, and looked down the cracks. At length he
  scooped up something with a strangled yell of relief and joy.</p>

  <p>When Richards sank down cross-legged upon his blankets, however, all that
  Givain saw with his startled eyes was a twenty-dollar gold piece, twisted out
  of shape and with a large hole driven through the center of it. Yet the giant
  cradled it in his palm as though it was a diamond of untold value.</p>

  <p>At length he set to work to tie a new and stouter string through it. And
  the knot of the string, as he tied it around his neck again, was drawn tight
  and tied again, half a dozen times. Certainly there was small fear that such
  a knot would unravel, and as for the string, it was of the stoutest twine.
  With this strange talisman fastened about his neck, he lay down upon the
  blankets. He wrapped himself in them and seemed sound asleep, yet, now and
  again, he started violently, and his big right hand flew up to clutch at the
  place beneath the flannel shirt where the twenty-dollar piece must lie. And
  each time there was a groan of relief and of content as his fingers touched
  the metal.</p>

  <p>Then Givain, turning from the window, hurried down the hill. He had no
  great hope, but even a small one was like a glimpse of heaven after the
  despair in which he had been plunged through all of these days. He went
  straight to that small, hidden camp of his, took from his little pack his
  razor, tested it upon a hair and found that its edge was as keen and as
  biting as hate. Then he closed it, pocketed it, and went back up the
  hill.</p>

  <p>By the time he arrived at the house on the hill, the fire had burned low
  upon the hearth. It was either dead or else the dying coals were filmed over
  with the gray of ashes through which a dull and uncertain glow was thrown
  across the room. Yet, now and then, when a draught pried at the embers, a
  flame was wakened for an instant, illumining every corner of the room
  brightly.</p>

  <p>Givain took note of these surroundings calmly, gravely. Then he unbuckled
  his revolver and dropped the cartridge belt upon the ground, for, if the
  giant wakened, Givain must not be tempted to kill a man by surprise and by
  treachery. Better by far to be himself killed by those great hands. After
  this he removed his boots, took off his hat, and gave the bright stars one
  look. Then he entered the room.</p>

  <p>There were seven paces from the door to the spot where the big man snored.
  There were only seven small paces, but at the fifth the fire gleamed, and at
  the seventh the tongue of flame started up, and Givain, looking down, thought
  that the glittering eyes of the other were fixed upon him. Was the giant
  playing 'possum?</p>

  <p>But when he leaned and peered, it seemed from the relaxed muscles and the
  steady breathing that Richards still slept. So Givain knelt beside him, and,
  so kneeling, he was within the circle of the left arm of the prostrate man.
  One sweep of that hand would gather him in, no matter how blindly made. Then
  a fumble of the big fingers, a crunch of bones, and his neck would be
  broken.</p>

  <p>Givain was whipped on by the dread of the meeting in front of Mundy's
  shop. With fingers nerved to steadiness, he fumbled beneath the collar and
  found the thread of twine. With set teeth, with a prayer and despair in his
  heart, he softly drew that thread forth. But how could he keep the rough
  twine from chafing, however softly, against the skin of the sleeper? There
  with a gasp and groan, and the right hand of the killer clapped against his
  breast.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; REMOVING A TALISMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">How Givain jerked his own hands away, swiftly, and without a
  jar, he did not know. But certain it was that Richards did not strike them.
  But his hand struck his breast, and apparently he felt the coin, and,
  reassured in the midst of his nightmare, he dropped his hand again, turned
  with a groan of relief upon his side, and was instantly asleep again.</p>

  <p>Givain went swiftly and calmly ahead with his work now. Having succeeded
  in passing this crisis, it seemed to him that he was guaranteed against
  further interruption. With a deftness incomparable he drew forth the coin. A
  touch of the razor's edge parted the twine, and now both twine and coin were
  his.</p>

  <p>But being his, such an ecstasy of relief and of weakness passed through
  him that he felt he could never find the strength to rise from his knees. His
  legs were shaking, and his teeth were chattering in his head. His whole body
  trembled. It was a long effort before he rose. And he began to move backward
  toward the door, keeping his eyes fixed upon the bulk upon the floor, more
  dimly outlined now by the dying firelight. Once a tongue of flame stood up,
  quivering inches high above the ashes. It showed the rugged face of the
  sleeper, but his eyes were closed, and Givain, being now in the doorway,
  whirled, leaped into the night, felt the firm ground beneath him, and rushed
  down the hill as though assisted by wings. No one could have caught him then,
  he felt. For, crushed against his palm, eating into his flesh, was the curved
  edge of the coin that, in some mysterious manner, represented the whole
  strength of Al Richards. He was as certain of it as though he had seen a
  spell breathed over that piece of money.</p>

  <p>At last he sat by the ashes of his own fire in the woods. He fanned it to
  life again. He cast handfuls of dead shrubbery upon it, until the fire rose
  recklessly high and Sally came sniffing and nosing toward him. Then he took
  the bit of gold in his hand. The date was clear&mdash;it had been coined in
  1892. And the hole that was drilled so clean through it might have been
  punched by a Thirty- Two caliber bullet&mdash;a rifle bullet, say. The impact
  that had forced it through the metal had twisted the coin at the same time
  out of shape.</p>

  <p>How could this trinket have anything to do with the powers of Al Richards?
  And yet he felt, as he stared down at the thing, that he had trimmed the hair
  of Samson and found, indeed, the heel of Achilles. He felt freed. If, at that
  instant, he had seen the vast and unwieldy bulk of Al Richards looming
  through the darkness, he would have gone to the attack on the great man with
  a feeling of perfect confidence, so much was he assured that the hands of the
  destroyer were unnerved.</p>

  <p>But what would happen when Richards wakened in the morning? What would the
  big man do? What would he say? He was urged by an invincible curiosity that
  made him rise from the fire he had just kindled. Now he saddled Sally, flung
  himself upon her, and jogged easily up the slope of the hill. He dismounted
  at a little distance from the house.</p>

  <p>To the same door to which he had gone in such a horror of fear before, he
  advanced again. He sat upon the sill and looked calmly into the shadows.
  There was Richards, still sleeping, still a shapeless mound of blackness
  rising from the floor.</p>

  <p>So Givain went out again, and he remembered that he had made this second
  perilous journey even without his revolver. At that remembrance he merely
  laughed, and, passing around the house, he picked up the belt and the gun
  where he had unbuckled and dropped them. As he picked them up, he wondered if
  such a scruple as had moved him, when he gave up his weapon, could ever have
  entered into the brutish brain of Richards.</p>

  <p>Yet that brain was not all brute. There was that which assured him that
  the love of this mere coin would be the undoing of the monster. Therefore,
  there was an instinct in him that said that Richards was capable of highly
  strung efforts of the imagination.</p>

  <p>And now, with his gun buckled upon his thigh, he sat down to watch the
  morning grow, and smoked a cigarette. He was hungry. He had not tasted food
  for twenty-four hours. But food was not what he needed. He was tasting, in
  all its sweetness, the surety of life restored&mdash;the sweetest of all
  life, his own. And how dear to him was the growing of that dawn behind the
  mountains, striking them out in quick and bold strokes, as though he watched
  some worker in black and white sketching in a picture of mountains at dawn,
  rescuing new details at every stroke.</p>

  <p>But now it was more than a rough and wildly imposing sketch. Behind the
  mountains was welling up flood upon flood and wave upon wave of tender
  color&mdash;of pink transfused with yellow, of rose so lovely that it opened
  his soul as though there was a fragrance emanating from it, and of tides and
  tides of exquisite, pure, white light. How beautiful it was, and how it
  rolled upon the heart of Givain for the first time, until it seemed to him
  that, after the three days of torture, he was being born again and into a
  world all new to him. There would be a thousand things to mark and to look
  for thereafter. He told himself that, having tasted the bitterness of death
  for three whole days, he would make a new path for himself through the world.
  What he had kicked aside as worthless before, he would stay to watch closely.
  And if he had gone through his days prizing, first, fox-like cunning, and
  secondly, fierce skill in battle, he would revise his ideas, open his eyes,
  and see if there was not something in life like the light that was rushing up
  over the eastern peaks&mdash;something good because it was beautiful, and
  beautiful because it was good.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Givain, indeed, that now for the first time he was getting at
  the heart of an understanding of the girl, Rose Mundy. He had thought that he
  knew her before, but how small had been his knowledge, He had seen and
  admired her prettiness, her clever mind, her subtle ways of eyes and hand and
  thought, but he had never been aware of something else that he was now
  beginning to sense as he. watched the birth of the morning, and that was a
  deep and perfect purity. So that her greatest strength was not her
  cleverness, but her very lack of knowledge. And she seemed to the ecstatic
  mind of the gambler, now, half child and half saint&mdash;half to be adored
  and half to be worshipped.</p>

  <p>Of at least one thing he was sure. If he were ever to touch her hand with
  this newly saved being of his, it must be as one who had put his criminal
  existence behind him. It must be as one who had vowed an honest labor to make
  an honest life. He rose. He stood upon tiptoe. He stretched out his arms to
  the east, all golden now, and rose, with one streaming cloud of fire blown
  westward. And he felt that the cold air he breathed went through and through
  him and purged him forever of the thing that he had been.</p>

  <p>And in the very midst of that ecstasy he heard the deep voice of Al
  Richards cry out, half groan, half scream&mdash;half fear and half the
  wildest rage.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE MAN-KILLER FLEES</h2>

  <p class="first">It brought him back with a shock and a start to the cruel
  facts of that last night. For a moment he was on the verge of running to peer
  through the window and watch. But then something held him back. The shouting
  of Al Richards was like the crying of a stricken beast. As he raged, it
  seemed to Givain that looking in upon him would be like looking in upon a man
  transformed into an animal. And he had no right to do that. After all, it was
  through a piece of wicked theft by night that he had disarmed the soul of the
  man killer of its old confidence.</p>

  <p>And there was something magnificent, also, in the passion of the
  destroyer. He was tearing up the planks of the floor, now. He was dashing
  them about. The house shook and moaned under his passion as though a storm
  wind were harrying it with a strong hand. And the thunder of the giant's
  voice rose and raged.</p>

  <p>It all stopped suddenly. The roaring and the smashing stopped. It was as
  though a pointed gun had halted that big man. And in Givain it was as though
  a sudden realization of weakness had come upon Richards.</p>

  <p>So the gambler turned the corner of the house. What he saw was Richards
  shambling across the field with his saddle and bridle dragging after him,
  making toward the huge mustang. He was half running, like a man in the most
  mortal fear. And Givain grew sick at heart as he watched. For, after all,
  although the strength of Richards had been terrible, it had been magnificent,
  also. And now the fellow was a mere skulker. He was transformed from a lion
  to a jackal.</p>

  <p>He was busy at the mustang now. His deep voice rolled back to Givain in
  mutterings, confused, subdued, hurried, as he cursed his horse one moment and
  implored it to stand quiet the next. For the mustang hated the sight of the
  saddle and the bridle and showed its hatred even with its hobbled feet.</p>

  <p>It was saddled, however. And finally its wicked teeth were pried apart and
  the bit forced between them. So, saddled and bridled, the giant now unhobbled
  his horse and slung the ropes behind the saddle. This done, he was in the act
  of mounting, when his eye lighted on the form of Sally, as she grazed calmly
  along the side of the hill. And that sight seemed to crush him.</p>

  <p>Richards glanced wildly around. And then, in the door of the house that he
  had just left, he saw none other than the young gambler, dapper, alert,
  slender, exactly as he had stood upon that other day when his gun had struck
  Richards down. And the power of mystery fell suddenly and heavily upon the
  big man.</p>

  <p>The mustang seemed to feel his weakness, for now it veered suddenly away.
  Richards lunged in pursuit with a muffled cry, but he received the heels of
  the mustang as the brute lashed out. One grazed his head and one grazed his
  body and hurled him flat, and, before he could rise again, the horse was
  gone. Al Richards cast one terrified glance behind him to make sure that the
  enemy was not pursuing him, and then he rushed down the hill after the
  horse.</p>

  <p>But Richards never again sat the saddle on that animal. All day he kept up
  the vain labor upon the mustang's trail. At night he gave it up. He slunk to
  the nearest town, took the first freight that left the place, and was swept
  north. Five hundred miles away, and two days later, he was arrested for
  vagrancy in a little Montana town, arrested by a new constable and a young
  one.</p>

  <p>In the jail they learned the truth from the cowering bulk. He was Al
  Richards, famous in story for a dozen years. He was Al Richards, or, rather a
  wreck who swore that the name belonged to him. And when the reporters came to
  question him, he refused to talk. But to his cell mate he told a strange
  story.</p>

  <p>It was of how, years and years before, he had entered his first fight, and
  of how the bullet of the other man had struck him and hurt him in the side.
  But he had not been pierced by the slug, and his own shot had killed his
  enemy. And when he examined the place where he had been hit, he found that
  the bullet from the other's rifle&mdash;for they were firing at a distance
  from one another&mdash;had pierced his wallet, cut through the leather, and
  then, in cutting through a golden twenty-dollar piece, had been turned to the
  side.</p>

  <p>So his life had been saved by that bit of soft metal, and it had seemed to
  Richards like a sign of power given to him. He felt, thereafter, that he was
  invincible. He attached all the belief in his own strength to that bit of
  gold, and, so long as it was strung around his neck, he was secure. But when
  it was gone, he was helpless. And, in fact, the instant that the piece of
  money had been taken from him, the belief that punishment for all his crimes
  was about to overtake him had crushed him as if under a great weight. In a
  moment he was unmanned. And now the man killer was serving a thirty-day term
  for vagrancy.</p>

  <p>After that, Al Richards was never heard from again.</p>

  <p>Whether he came to a sudden end, when one of his numberless enemies took
  heart at his downfall and pursued him to the ground, or whether Al Richards
  had slunk out of the cow country and was rushed far away by the speed of
  trains to begin a new life as a laborer, where his mighty strength of hands
  would stand him in better stead, remained a mystery even to those who most
  carefully strove to delve into the facts. But certain it was that he never
  again appeared in the West with his flat, brutal eye, his voice of thunder,
  mounted on his terrible horse, and with his ungloved right hand swinging near
  the handles of his gun.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">
  Perhaps Givain should have told the whole story of what had happened at
  the so-called haunted house to everyone in the village. But a little trace of
  vanity prevented him.</p>

  <p>He went down to the village and announced calmly enough that Al Richards
  would not come down to fight the big fight that day in front of Bob Mundy's
  blacksmith shop, and, when people grinned their disbelief and asked why he
  thought so, he said that he and the other had already fought out their little
  quarrel in the haunted house upon the hill. And Bob Mundy, who had returned
  to meet his fate at the hands of Al Richards, was there to hear the joyous
  news.</p>

  <p>Twenty men took horse and rode to the place. They did not find a dead
  body. Indeed, they found no trace of Richards at all. But they found that the
  interior of the building was half wrecked. And they came back to tell their
  amazed friends that they had seen a prodigy.</p>

  <p>As for Givain, he never again dealt a pack of cards. He never again wore a
  gun, for he had promised his wife, Rose, that he would not. Indeed, he did
  not need a gun now for protection, for a thousand men and women and children
  up and down the range believed firmly that Givain had in some mysterious
  fashion been able to meet the giant bulk of Richards, hand to hand, and
  subdue him. For did not the wrecked interior of the house show that a fight
  had been fought there?</p>

  <p>And Givain never had the moral courage to deny the tale.</p>
