  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; LEON, MISCHIEF-MAKER</h2>

  <p class="first">I was not born upon Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, nor upon
  Thursday, or Saturday, I presume, because the blessings of those days are
  mixed; but I came into this world upon a Sunday. I was the only child of a
  butcher in the town of Mendez, in Arizona. His name was Leon Porfilo, and I
  was given the same appellation. My mother was Irish, of County Clare. I got
  my red hair from her and my olive skin from my father. He was not a Mexican.
  There had not been a cross into a Latin race for generations.</p>

  <p>My father was a cunning businessman. He had begun life as a common
  cowpuncher, and he had saved enough out of his monthly wages to finally buy
  out a butcher's business in the town of Mendez. You have never heard of
  Mendez; for my part, I hope that I shall never lay eyes upon it again. It
  lies on a great flat of burned desert with a cool puff of mountains on the
  northern horizon, to which I turned my heart from my infancy.</p>

  <p>Whether in rare summer or bitter winter, heat or ice, sun or shade, give
  me mountains. I would not have any pleasantly rolling hills. I would have
  mountains that shoot the eye up to heaven one instant and drop it to hell the
  next. I would take my rides where the wild goats pasture, and roll down my
  blankets at night, where the sun will find me first in the whole world the
  next morning.</p>

  <p>But as for the desert, I cannot write the word without seeing the
  sun-scalded town of Mendez once more, and breathing the acrid clouds of
  alkali dust which were forever whirling through its streets. I cannot hear
  the word without an ache behind my eyes as I think of stretching a glance
  toward that million-mile horizon.</p>

  <p>It was a dull huddle of houses in which there lived a handful or two of
  men and women with sallow, withered faces&mdash;old at thirty and bowed at
  fifty. Even the dogs looked unhappy.</p>

  <p>I said that I was an only child, which implies that, although I was born
  on Sunday, I was cursed. An only child is either too good to be true, or a
  spoiled, pampered devil. I may admit that I was never too good to be
  true.</p>

  <p>My father had just sufficient means to make me wish that he had more. When
  I asked for a horse, he could give me a pony&mdash;and there you are! The
  more favors he showered on me, the more I hated him, because he did not give
  me what I craved. He, in the meantime, toiled like a slave.</p>

  <p>I rather despised him because he was such a slave.</p>

  <p>My mother was true Irish. She loved her religion, and she loved her son
  with an equally devout enthusiasm. She would have died for the one as readily
  as for the other. I soon learned her character as well as that of my father.
  I learned that I could coax anything from her and whine until I got what I
  wanted from him.</p>

  <p>They continued to consider me a blessing sent to them directly from
  heaven, until I grew big enough to convince the world that I was something
  else; and I convinced the world long before I convinced my parents.</p>

  <p>I was big-boned, square-jawed, and blunt-nosed; the very type to take
  punishment without feeling it and deal it out heavily in return. School meant
  to me nothing but a chance to battle, and the school yard was my tournament
  field. When the teachers complained about me, my lies at home more than
  offset their bad reports of me. I posed as a statue of injured virtue in my
  house.</p>

  <p>I went on in this way for a good many years, learning nothing but idle
  habits and loving nothing but my own way. I was fifteen when a turn came in
  my life.</p>

  <p>Young Wilkins, the son of a well-to-do rancher, came into town riding a
  fine young horse which his father had given him. Half an hour later I had
  picked a fight with him, thrashed him soundly, and taken the horse as a
  natural prize of victory. I did not intend to steal the brute, of course. But
  I intended to give it the ride of its life&mdash;and I did. I brought it back
  to Mendez a couple of hours later, staggering, foaming, and nearly dead. I
  found it a fine young colt; I left it a wrecked and heart-broken beast which
  was not worthy of its keep.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilkins looked at the battered face of his son when he came home and
  said nothing; he felt in common with most Westerners that if their children
  could not take care of themselves they must accept the penalty. But when he
  saw the condition of the colt, he had another thought.</p>

  <p>He rode to the home of the sheriff and spoke his mind; and the sheriff
  rode to the home of my father and found him, in the late evening, just
  returned from his rounds and wearily unharnessing his fagged team.</p>

  <p>The upshot of it was that I did not go to jail, but my father had to buy
  the colt at a handsome price. That outlay of money was a severe tax, and the
  sight of the useless new horse in the corral every day was a continual goad
  to both of my parents. They began to inquire among their neighbors, and the
  moment these good people found that the doors were opened at last, and that
  Leon Porfilo, the elder, was willing to hear the truth about his offspring,
  they unburdened themselves of a thousand truths about me. I was described as
  a lazy ne'er-do-well, a consummate idler, a stupid bully, a foolish student,
  and a professional mischief-maker in the town.</p>

  <p>"The hangman usually gets youngsters that start out like this!" said the
  most outspoken of all.</p>

  <p>My father came home to my mother and told her everything. There was a
  storm of tears and of protests; and then my mother sent for the priest. He
  listened to her patiently. He did not offer to advise her; he did not
  corroborate the reports of the loose-tongued neighbors; but he said, when she
  asked him what she could do with me:</p>

  <p>"Give young Leon to me for six months. I shall guarantee to teach him his
  lessons, reform his manners in part, and give him a certain measure of
  industry."</p>

  <p>My mother was enraptured.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Father McGuire, "I shall expect a return for these
  services."</p>

  <p>My mother told him that he could ask whatever he wanted, and that Leon
  Porfilo would be glad to pay.</p>

  <p>"I do not want a penny," said Father McGuire. "If I cannot make that young
  man pay for his lessons and his keep and the trouble I am forced to expend on
  him, my name is not McGuire! Only, I insist that I shall have absolute and
  unquestioned charge of him from the first day to the end of six months.
  During that time you are not to lay eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"At the end of that time, you may see him, and if you like his progress
  and what he will have to tell you about me and my methods of teaching, you
  may leave him in my hands for a longer time. If you do not like my way with
  him, you may have him back, and I shall wash my hands of the matter."</p>

  <p>This was a great thing to ask of my mother. I am certain that she could
  not have consented had it not been that she could not understand the priest's
  reasons for wishing to take me on such unusual terms. Because what he
  demanded was a mystery, it overcame any possible objections on the part of
  either of my parents. Finally, they asked me if I were willing to go to the
  priest's house and to live with him.</p>

  <p>I considered my picture of the priest's life, his comfortable little
  house, his neat garden filled with well-watered, well-tended flowers, his
  sheds, always freshly painted, his larder always well-filled with good
  cookery, and above all the thin, patient, weary face of little Father McGuire
  himself. A sense of my own bulk overwhelmed me. Any change would have been
  delightful to me.</p>

  <p>I consented at once, and the next day my clothes and books, my whole list
  of possessions down to my latest fishing rod, were bundled together, and I
  was sent away to the house of Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>I was let into the house by the old servant, a half blind woman who had
  worked for so many years in that house that she found her way about more by
  the sense of touch than anything else, I am sure. The sight of her was
  satisfactory to me. I decided that it would be a simple matter for me to
  hoodwink her at every turn. She told me that Father McGuire half expected me
  and that, since he was away making the rounds of his parish&mdash;for he was
  an indefatigable worker for his church&mdash;I was to make myself at home and
  spend the day becoming accustomed to the place and all that was in it.</p>

  <p>In the meantime she showed me my room.</p>

  <p>I was delighted with it. It was not half so large as my chamber at home.
  It was in the second story of the little building, and it had a tiny dormer
  window which looked to the north, but all was as neat as a pin, the floor was
  freshly painted, the bed was newly made and covered with a crisp white
  spread, and past the window ran the delicate tendrils of the only
  successfully raised climbing vine that had ever graced the town of
  Mendez.</p>

  <p>There was a small cupboard where I could put away my gear and my
  books&mdash;the books which I intended to keep as much strangers to me as
  they had ever been in the past. There was a closet where I hung out my
  clothes, and then I made a survey of the house and the grounds.</p>

  <p>The house itself lay on the edge of the town, near the church. Its grounds
  were as small, comparatively, as the house in which the good priest lived. In
  a land where acres could be had almost for the asking, the priest had
  contented himself with a tiny plot which included room for a flower garden
  around the house and a vegetable patch behind it, then a wood and cattle
  shed, and finally a pasture just large enough to maintain the one
  musty-looking old pony and the cow, which was a comfortable brindle.</p>

  <p>My first amusement was to whistle to a passing dog and set it on the cow,
  and I laughed until my sides ached at the manner in which she went hurtling
  around the lot, tossing her horns, helpless, with her great udder swinging
  from side to side.</p>

  <p>Then, when I was satisfied with this amusement, I strolled back to the
  house and, passing the open kitchen window, purloined a delicate blackberry
  tart which was cooling on the sill.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE FIRST LESSON</h2>

  <p class="first">All the rest of that day went as pleasantly as the
  commencement of it, and in the evening, almost at as late an hour as my
  father returned from his rounds, the priest came wearily home to the house.
  He greeted me with a smile and a firm handshake with such strength in it that
  I wondered at him. For he seemed to have a most athletic hand!</p>

  <p>We sat down to supper together, and while we ate he talked with me and
  asked me little questions about myself and what I intended to do with my
  life.</p>

  <p>"I believe," said the good priest, "that after a boy has reached a certain
  age, he should be allowed to do as he pleases with his life. In the meantime,
  I should like to find out what you now please to do with yourself."</p>

  <p>I told him, glad to talk of myself, that I intended to grow larger and
  stronger, and that I then intended to look about me and find a place where
  one did not have to work too much in the hot sun. Indoor work would suit
  me.</p>

  <p>"You wish to become a student, then?" suggested Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>I admitted that books were extremely distasteful to me, and that I did not
  desire to have any intimate knowledge of them, whatsoever.</p>

  <p>There was no more talk on these subjects. Father McGuire turned his
  attention to other things. He declared that he had heard a great deal about
  my fights with other boys, and he particularly mentioned a few recent
  instances. I admitted sullenly that I had fought occasionally, and that I
  hoped that I would soon get over that bad habit.</p>

  <p>"By no means," said Father McGuire, who seemed to have recovered from his
  languor of weariness. "By no means! Those men whom I most admire in this
  world are the saints who bless it with their gentleness. But they are very
  few." Here he sighed.</p>

  <p>"I have seen only two or three in all my life. But next to the saints, I
  love the warriors, of which there are always a fair number&mdash;I mean the
  true hearts of oak who will fight until the ship sinks! Perhaps you are to be
  one of those, Leon!"</p>

  <p>It was a thrilling possibility&mdash;when I heard him speak of it in this
  manner. I began to regard myself as a great man, and when that pleasant
  evening ended, I went to bed and to sleep without the slightest regret that I
  was not in the house of my parents. I decided that Father McGuire would never
  thwart a single one of my wishes.</p>

  <p>In the morning, a full three hours before my ordinary time of
  waking&mdash;which was eight&mdash;I heard a brisk rap at the door, and the
  cheerful voice of Father McGuire in the hall, telling me that it was time to
  get up.</p>

  <p>"Get up?" said I, sitting up in the bed and blinking at the dull gray of
  the sky outside my window, "why, it's the middle of night."</p>

  <p>He told me that he had some good news for me; and that brought me out of
  bed in a twinkling. In an instant I had leaped into my clothes, and I was
  standing before him in the hall.</p>

  <p>"You are to learn to milk," said Father McGuire, who had remained there
  waiting for me all of this time. "I intend to teach you this morning."</p>

  <p>I made a wry face, not too covertly, and went along with him to find the
  cow. For ten or fifteen minutes, I pretended to attempt to do as he told me.
  As a matter of fact, I had done a little milking before, and could perform
  fairly well at it. For the priest, however, I pretended that it was a
  hopeless task for me; I wished to discourage, in the beginning of our
  acquaintance&mdash;which was bound to last for at least six months&mdash;this
  foolish habit of rousing me before daybreak to do chores about the house.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the hand of Father McGuire was laid upon my shoulder. "Will you
  tell me the truth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I.</p>

  <p>"Are you doing your best?"</p>

  <p>I declared that I was, and made an apparently savage effort to get the
  milk from the udder of the cow. But there was not a trickle in answer. I told
  Father McGuire that it was no good; and that I could not master the knack of
  the thing. He smiled upon me in the gentlest manner.</p>

  <p>"There is no hurry," said he. "In these things, one must use the most
  infinite patience. It is very true that one often needs time, but time, after
  all, is often a cheap matter in this world of ours. It may require an hour,
  or two hours&mdash;but it is a long time, as I said&mdash;before breakfast.
  Sit there and do your best. I cannot ask any more."</p>

  <p>He folded his arms and leaned against the fence, watching me. I began to
  perspire with impatience and anger. My back was aching from that infernally
  cramped position, and in another moment, as by magic, all the difficulties
  disappeared, and the streams of milk began to descend with a rhythmic chiming
  into the pail&mdash;then with increasing force as I set aside all pretense,
  and hurried to finish the task.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire stood by and admired. He had never seen such an apt pupil,
  he declared.</p>

  <p>"Which teaches one," said he, "that a slow beginning often makes a good
  ending!"</p>

  <p>The cow was milked; I carried the pail sullenly to the house and dropped
  it on the floor, but Father McGuire was not yet done with me. I was shown how
  I must strain it into three pans; and how I must take down the pans of
  yesterday from the little creamery and skim them, and throw the cream into
  the cream jar, and then empty the skimmed milk into another pail.</p>

  <p>After that, I was led forth to the pasture again and told to catch the
  horse. The horse became exceedingly difficult to capture. It seemed
  impossible for me to manage the brute, and I told Father McGuire as much.</p>

  <p>His answer made me begin to hate him.</p>

  <p>"More gently, then," said he. "But always with patience, my dear Leon. The
  time will come when she will come straight up to your hand. She is a gentle
  creature, although a very stupid one. See what time accomplished in the
  matter of learning how to milk! It may do even more in this affair of the
  catching of the horse."</p>

  <p>I saw that I was fairly trapped, and that he intended to let me learn in
  my own way. So I caught the stupid beast at once and led her into the barn. I
  was told to curry and brush her, and Father McGuire showed me how to proceed.
  I snatched the brush and comb when he offered them to me, and began to work
  in a blind passion.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Wait! Wait!" said the gentle voice of the priest. "More haste and
  less speed! You must not curry against the grain&mdash;but so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I flung brush and comb upon the floor with a loud clatter. "I'm not a
  slave!" cried I. "I won't do any more."</p>

  <p>He raised his pale hand. "Not that word, my dear Leon," said he. "'Won't'
  is the one word of all others which I detest in a boy. The point is that I
  have told you to brush and curry the horse. For stupidity I trust that I have
  an infinite patience; but for willful obstinacy I desire a sword of fire. Do
  not provoke me, Leon. Do not let anger take the upper hand with me. Let anger
  be far from me, always, in my treatment of you!"</p>

  <p>He actually raised his eyes as he was saying this, as though it were a
  manner of prayer. At this, my rage broke through.</p>

  <p>"You little runt!" I yelled at him. "I'm gonna leave, and I'm gonna leave
  right now!"</p>

  <p>I started for the door.</p>

  <p>"Will you come back, Leon?" said the gentle voice.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you go to the devil first," said I.</p>

  <p>A light step followed me; a hand of iron gripped my arm and flung me
  around.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your work," said Father McGuire through his teeth. He pointed
  toward the long-suffering horse.</p>

  <p>I was enraged by that grip upon my arm from which my muscles still ached.
  Though I have never been the type of bully that picks upon younger boys, I
  now forgot myself. I struck heavily at the head of Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>My father or my mother would have fainted with horror to see such a blow
  leveled at the man of God, but there was no fainting in Father McGuire. His
  small arms darted out, my wrist landed against a sharp elbow so that I howled
  with the stabbing pain of it, and the next moment a bony little fist darted
  up and nestled against the very point of my jaw.</p>

  <p>There was an astonishing weight behind that hand. It lifted me from my
  feet, toppled me backward, and landed me against the wall of the barn with a
  crash.</p>

  <p>There I lay in a stupor, gazing at this man who had worked a miracle.</p>

  <p>I should have said that at fifteen, like many others who grow large, I had
  my full height of an inch above six feet, and I had a hundred and sixty
  pounds of weight to dress my inches. I had not done hard labor, at that time,
  and my strength had not been seasoned and hardened upon my shoulders, but
  still I was a stout youngster.</p>

  <p>But here was I, full of consciousness of my hundred and sixty pounds of
  victorious brawn, laid flat on my back by a blow delivered by the fist of a
  little withered priest who had not three quarters of my bulk.</p>

  <p>I say that I lay flat on my back and glared at him with a chill of dread
  working in my blood. He, in the meantime, was standing before me with a great
  emotion in his face. He was flushed, his teeth were set, his feet were braced
  well apart beneath his robe, and there was a strange glitter in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let me not lose myself, Lord," said Father McGuire. "Let me not sin in
  passion. Let me be tender, and turn my other cheek to the smiter! Fill me
  with humility, Our Father"</p>

  <p>Here I leaped to my feet with a roar and rushed at him, and Father
  McGuire, with a little indrawn breath of pleasure, as of one drinking deep of
  happiness, met me with what any instructor in boxing would have termed a
  beautiful straight left.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; ONE FORTNIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">The straight left, as all men know, is to boxing what rhythm
  is to poetry. It is the foundation upon which all the other beauties are
  based and erected; it is the chief substance which the true artist will use.
  Now, I had fought my way up through the ranks of valorous boys, each the
  making of a future tough-handed cow-puncher and bull-dogger. But in all that
  time I had never encountered, and I certainly had never mastered, the fine
  art of the straight left which starts with a forward drive of the body, and
  lands with a stiffened arm, the hand twisting over and landing with the
  fingers down, the line of wrist, shoulder, hip, and right heel being as
  nearly as possible in one line.</p>

  <p>I, leaping in with eagerly flailing arms, found that straight left darting
  through my guard. It landed on my chin, and I felt as though I had raced in
  the darkness against a brick wall. My feet skidded from beneath me, and I sat
  down with a sickening jar.</p>

  <p>Through rather glassy eyes I stared up to Father McGuire. He was in a
  strange condition. He was dancing back and forth with a little jerky, uneasy
  step that is never learned except on the floor of a gymnasium, with a
  skillful teacher guiding. His hands were raised to the correct position for
  renewing the encounter; his face was more flushed than ever, and a queer
  smile played around the corners of his mouth, while his eyes were literally
  filled with fire.</p>

  <p>My second fall did not convince me any more than my first. It merely
  bewildered and infuriated me. It was a juggling trick that had put me down by
  chance, and in my strong young body I felt the existence of an infinite
  treasure of might. I bounded to my feet again and prepared to smash the
  priest to bits, no matter if I should have to hang for it.</p>

  <p>So I closed with him, took a stinging blow that cut my cheek and knocked
  my head far back, and got my arms well around him. Now let sheer might tell
  its own story! Alas, it was like embracing a greased pig&mdash;to use an
  ancient and unsavory simile. The good priest slid or twisted from my embrace,
  and with a sudden grip, a sudden twist, he flung me over his hip and landed
  me on my head.</p>

  <p>Through a partial daze I heard him shouting:</p>

  <p>"Are you well named, boy? Are you a young lion? Are you a lion in heart?
  Then I am Daniel! I fear you not! But avoid me, if you wish to keep"</p>

  <p>I whirled to my feet, a complete bulldog, now, savage for blood. I ran in
  through a rain of blows which stunned and cut and bruised me, but once more I
  came to grips with him. Once more I felt that sudden twisting of his body,
  which seemed to turn to iron under my touch; and suddenly I was down again.
  This time, in falling, the back of my head collided with the floor with a
  loud crash, and I was dropped into a deep well of blackness.</p>

  <p>I recovered to find my face and breast and throat dripping with water,
  while out of the dim distance I heard a voice crooning:</p>

  <p>"So, lad, and are you better now?"</p>

  <p>The sense of where I was, what had happened, and how I had been beaten,
  rushed suddenly over me. I started up to my feet.</p>

  <p>"I'll break your head, your trickster!" I yelled through swollen lips.
  "I'll"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Leon,!" said the priest to me. "If you strike me now, Leon, you
  strike a lamb. Here am I!"</p>

  <p>He opened his arms and presented himself patiently for the blow.</p>

  <p>But I, struck dumb by this sudden change, and overwhelmed more than ever
  with the bitterest shame, broke into tears and hid my face in my hands. I
  found the arm of Father McGuire hooked beneath mine. He led me gently toward
  the house; I was too blinded by my tight-swollen eyes and my tears to see the
  way! I was too oppressed in spirit to resist him. The old woman met us at the
  back door.</p>

  <p>She gasped at the sight of me, and I heard the priest say in his gentle
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Our poor Leon, Mimsy. It is a shocking thing! We must take the very best
  care of him! Get a piece of raw beefsteak, Mimsy, and bring it at once to his
  room!"</p>

  <p>So he took me up and made me lie down on the bed, whose covers he smoothed
  for me with a quick hand. Then he stretched a blanket over me and sat down by
  the bed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Leon," he said, patting my hand in his, "do not be ashamed. It is a
  science, lad, and nothing else. It is the science that makes the little man
  the equal of the big man&mdash;science of hands, science of brains. Work and
  patience and application will move mountains&mdash;even the mountains of a
  great heart and a warlike spirit, such as yours, my dear boy. Let us be
  friends!</p>

  <p>"Let us be kind to one another! I did not know what was in you. But now I
  have seen it. There is a great lump of steel. It is not yet modeled; it is
  not a tool with a cutting edge or a striking face. It has neither been edged
  nor tempered; it has not been whetted; it has not been fitted to the hand.
  Give me your time and your trust and we shall do great things together. Give
  me your faith, Leon, and I shall make you a lion indeed!"</p>

  <p>I heard him vaguely. My heart was too great and too thoroughly broken with
  shame, to heed all the meaning of his words at that moment; for I hated him
  then all the more, because he had beaten me down and then remained to soothe
  me.</p>

  <p>Presently the good Mimsy hobbled up to the door, and the priest took from
  her what she brought. I was soon bandaged and padded; and the priest was
  sucking in his breath and making a clucking noise of commiseration and
  regret, as he saw how my bruises swelled and my cuts bled.</p>

  <p>After he had finished, he begged me to rest easily and try to forgive him.
  Then he left me.</p>

  <p>What I first thought of was waiting until the next midnight and then
  setting fire to the house in a dozen places to insure the destruction of the
  priest and Mimsy both&mdash;those witnesses to my humiliation. Then I
  determined to flee at once to my home. But I remembered how terribly my face
  was battered, and knew that I could not offer any suitable explanation. If it
  were known that the small hands of the little priest had brought me down and
  pommeled me, I felt that my reputation was lost forever. Last of all, I
  desired to die, and quit this vale of sorrows at once and forever.</p>

  <p>The result of it all was that I saw myself condemned to remain at the
  priest's house&mdash;and remain very closely there&mdash;until my marks of
  battle had disappeared. And that might take two weeks! I decided to endure
  patiently and await my chance.</p>

  <p>I saw little of Father McGuire on that day, but the next morning he roused
  me a little before five, as he had done before, and took me out to the
  chores. I submitted silently and went through with them one by one, he, all
  the while, giving directions in the most cheerful manner, as though there had
  never been anything but the best of good feeling between us.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, for which I had acquired a good appetite, I was ushered
  into the library in my turn, and my books were placed before me.</p>

  <p>It was not difficult work, at first; it required nothing but the
  expenditure of time and pains. I began again at the beginning, with
  first-grade work, which I scorned. I had to learn to write again. I had to
  learn to spell, again. I had to skim through simple arithmetic, in which my
  errors were caught up with a skillful eye. From half past eight until twelve
  o'clock I kept at this work.</p>

  <p>Then we had lunch together, after which I washed and wiped the dishes, and
  was allowed a nap until two o'clock. After two o'clock, I had two hours and a
  half additional study. After that, Father McGuire sometimes came home and
  instructed me in certain branches of knowledge which I preferred very much to
  books. In other words, he unburdened himself of all the secrets which he had
  learned in his own youth from excellent boxing instructors.</p>

  <p>He taught me the secrets of wrestling. For the first time I heard such
  terms as half-nelson, and hip lock. He fitted part of one of the sheds with
  athletic appliances and a padded floor where he and I struggled several days
  a week with the gloves or on the mat. There I battered the punching bag to
  gain speed; there I tussled with the sand bag to gain strength.</p>

  <p>So the fortnight ended and my wounds from the first battle were
  healed.</p>

  <p>I was equipped, by this time, with the beginning of a little furrow
  between my eyes&mdash;a mark of increased seriousness and an interest in
  life. I had stripped off five or six pounds of fat by my arduous labors. I
  had within me the pulse and the rioting spirit of a man in perfect physical
  condition.</p>

  <p>I was now prepared to leave the priest forever. That day, accordingly,
  instead of going into the library to study, after breakfast, I went up to my
  room and gathered my belongings together. But when I had them bundled up, I
  paused and sat down to think things over.</p>

  <p>The prospect of leaving Father McGuire was no longer so attractive. I
  spent an hour turning the thought back and forth through my mind, and I ended
  by going slowly down to the library. There I could not study. Noon came
  before I was aware, and the slender form of the priest appeared in the
  doorway. He came, as usual, to look at my morning's work, and when he saw
  that I had not touched pen to paper, I waited with a frown for an
  outburst.</p>

  <p>Instead, he laid a friendly hand upon my shoulder. When I looked up
  hastily to him, I found that he was smiling upon me.</p>

  <p>"I think that the time of storm and struggle is over, Leon," said he. "I
  think that you are prepared to like me almost half as well as I like you. Are
  you not?"</p>

  <p>I have heard a great deal said of the sensitiveness of girls; but my
  observation leads me to conclude that boys are far more highly strung. At any
  rate, on this occasion, I had to look down suddenly to the paper before me,
  which I found obscured by a thick mist. But Father McGuire walked softly from
  the room without another word to me.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; A CHANCE MEETING</h2>

  <p class="first">From that moment I began to worship the little man. I began
  to work with a feverish interest at the things which he put before me. At
  noon and at night he corrected my studies and read aloud to me, and
  encouraged me through the difficult knots which I had found in various
  problems. But what I have often wondered at, was that he never forced
  religion upon me.</p>

  <p>He sometimes selected pleasant tales out of the Bible and read these to me
  and clothed the figures in real flesh for my boy's mind. Sometimes he invited
  me to the church to listen to the organ music. But further than this he did
  not go, though I have no doubt that he intended to do much for me in this
  direction, before the end came to my happy life with him.</p>

  <p>Time, as the saying has it, took wings. I had been three months with him
  in a trice. A certain stock of his lessons I had picked up so successfully
  that one day, as we boxed, he was forced to cry out to me: "Not so hard,
  Leon. Well, confound you, take that!"</p>

  <p>The rapier-like left darted toward me. I blocked it perfectly and returned
  a sharp counter to his face with the thick gloves. Thick gloves, but Father
  McGuire was shaken to the toes. He dragged off the gloves and sat down to rub
  his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Goliath," said he, grinning at me with twinkling eyes, "you must remember
  that I am a very elderly David!"</p>

  <p>So I had my triumph. So I had my revenge for that heavy beating which he
  had given me. The revenge was so complete that my heart overflowed with it; I
  found myself apologizing gravely, and without smugness!</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Father McGuire. "I am not hurt. But neither do you know
  your strength. Oh, lad, lad, when you grow into your strength"</p>

  <p>He took one of my boyish arms and ran his own hard finger tips down the
  courses of the muscles.</p>

  <p>My six months ended, and I went home for the first time to my father and
  my mother; and, for the first time, I saw them as they were. I think it was
  the saddest and the happiest moment of my life. For I realized as I sat
  before them that there was a great gap between them and me, and I realized,
  also, that they were two mines of kindness and whole-heartedness.</p>

  <p>They were delighted with the transformation which Father McGuire had
  worked in me. They were delighted to see some of the loutishness gone. When
  we sat at the table together, they still were exclaiming and looking at me
  with fond eyes.</p>

  <p>But I was glad to go back to the priest's house on the next day.</p>

  <p>"So soon, my dear Leon?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Is it too soon?" said I.</p>

  <p>"No," said he, "for you may see them whenever you choose from this time
  on."</p>

  <p>In this fashion I became a regular member of the household of Father
  McGuire. From my fifteenth to my eighteenth year, that long time of study and
  work continued. Then the blow fell.</p>

  <p>It was not the deaths of my father and my mother. Those occurred in my
  sixteenth year. My father's team&mdash;which was a new pair of half-broken
  mustangs&mdash;ran away and overturned the wagon. He was crushed beneath it
  and was found dead the next day. And only two weeks later my mother died of a
  weak heart.</p>

  <p>These were two heavy blows to me, but still they did not bring on the
  crisis which had an element of tragedy in it.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire, as my guardian, sold the butcher's business, which my
  father had built up, for a good round price, and then sold the house and the
  horses and the few cattle. The resulting sum was a little over eight thousand
  dollars, and I felt myself rich, indeed.</p>

  <p>But, a month from the day of my father's death, these transactions being
  completed, I begged Father McGuire to accept the whole mass of wealth.</p>

  <p>"Use this money however you wish," said I to him. "I want to pay it to you
  to hire you as my teacher. Will you do that? Will you take it and let me come
  back to live with you as I have lived before?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me with such a smile of happiness as I think few men have
  ever seen. But he would not take a penny of the money. By him it was banked
  in my name where the savings could accumulate. In the meantime, I was
  welcomed back to him.</p>

  <p>"Because," said he, "I should have to keep a hired man, if it were not for
  you, Leon!"</p>

  <p>So I resumed my life with Father McGuire and Mimsy, who seemed to grow no
  older&mdash;she had reached that point in life where a year or two more or
  less made no difference. She was unchanging.</p>

  <p>But in the meantime, the crisis had been gathering slowly about me.</p>

  <p>It began after I had been with Father McGuire something over eight months.
  I was hurrying down the crooked, ugly little street of the town when I came
  on some youngsters of my own age playing an improvised form of football, in
  which the chief fun was seeing how hard the other fellow could be tackled and
  how many men could jump on him at the same instant as he went down.</p>

  <p>Sitting on a fine horse at the side of the street was a handsome, strong-
  shouldered boy a year or so older than myself. I had grown serious, too
  serious, perhaps, in my time with Father McGuire. So I took no share in the
  fun. I stood by, as the stranger did, and laughed at the tumbles and
  falls.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the shadow of horse and rider loomed across me. I looked up into
  his fine, sneering face.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of the rest of 'em?" he asked me.</p>

  <p>I merely smiled. I was too well known in Mendez to fear the imputation
  which lay behind this speech.</p>

  <p>"What about yourself?" I said to him.</p>

  <p>"Not in these clothes," said he. "They're a lot too good to be spoiled
  roughing it like that."</p>

  <p>He indicated with a sweep of the hand all his finery&mdash;which was
  enough to have filled the eye of a Mexican cow-puncher and delighted the
  heart of his ladylove.</p>

  <p>"Things that are too good to play in are a lot too good to wear at all!"
  said I, for in spite of all the teachings of Father McGuire, I was full of
  impatience and hotness under the skin.</p>

  <p>The tall fellow on the horse pressed himself a little closer to me, so
  that I had to give ground for his horse. I have said that he was
  handsome&mdash; yes, with a blond sort of beauty such as one finds very
  rarely, and eyes of as richly deep a blue as might have been wished for in a
  girl. So, sitting magnificently above me, he smiled on me. He was seventeen.
  I was sixteen. I was big for my age; he was still larger. As he came closer
  and felt the superiority of his size and his spirit, he smiled at me again,
  in his sneering way.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you this, young fellow," said this splendid rider, "no matter
  what sort of clothes I have on, I've never had any that were too good for a
  fight!"</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said I, glaring at him. "Come down, then, and give me a
  square crack at you, and I'll show you how to muss up good clothes so's
  they're not fit to wear again."</p>

  <p>He came like a flash of light from the sky. His feet had hardly struck the
  ground before he was at me, and I heard a wild yell of excitement from the
  boys playing in the street:</p>

  <p>"Hey! Everybody come look! It's Lee Porfilo and Harry Chase! This'll be
  the best ever!"</p>

  <p>He did not strike me fairly as he came leaping in; I had not been
  practicing every day with Father McGuire and at the bag and the sand sack for
  nothing. If one can block the back-flick of a darting punching bag, one has
  at least a fair chance to block the swing of a fist. I put aside a quick
  thrusting of punches, and then he closed with me.</p>

  <p>The weight of his attack sent a thrill of fear through me. I have never
  felt the contact of any one which was so overwhelming as that of Harry Chase;
  except for his brother after him. But they had one thing in common that was
  above mere considerations of paltry poundage and physical might. They had an
  immense confidence and a swelling of the spirit that made them fairly
  override other men as a horse might trample down a boy. So the lunge and
  pressure of Harry Chase baffled and awed me.</p>

  <p>I grew weak, and I staggered back before the shock of his charging weight,
  so that the chorus of my friends in the street, most of whom had felt the
  weight of my fists at one time or another, wailed: "Leon is beat! Lee is beat
  at last!"</p>

  <p>Harry Chase, with a swinging cuff of his left fist, clipped me on the chin
  and sent me reeling still farther away, to verify that first cry. You will
  not think that the boys of Mendez were very fond of me&mdash;seeing that I
  had always been the town bully and the town ruffian until I went to live with
  the priest; but I was their champion, and the home champion, no matter what
  his character may be, is usually favored to win. They watched with held
  breath or with groans, while Harry Chase drove me before him.</p>

  <p>I think that I should have gone down at once before this berserk rush, had
  it not been for the training of Father McGuire. Such training at last becomes
  an instinct and takes even the place of courage. By very force of habit I
  warded off most of the blows which were leveled at me. Then, as I saw that I
  was keeping my own against this lion-like rush, and as I listened to the
  groans of shame which my companions of the town raised, I shook off my
  coldness of heart, and prodded at Harry Chase with that straight left which
  was almost a religious article in the athletic creed of good Father
  McGuire.</p>

  <p>It landed. There is nothing so difficult to avoid as a jabbing, long-range
  left hand. It is always held out so far that it is very near the mark, in the
  first place. It is sent home without a preliminary drawing back of the hand
  to give warning.</p>

  <p>I spoiled the next rush of Harry Chase by spatting my stiff left against
  his mouth, and then, as he gave back and rushed again, he caught the
  identical punch in the same place twice more. The third time brought a little
  trickle of blood and a yell of triumph from the little crowd of spectators.
  In fact, that crowd had been increased by others and older people crowding to
  doors and windows. Others, still, came running. When boys are sixteen and
  seventeen, the fun of their fighting is enough to draw even a crowd of mature
  men.</p>

  <p>The sting of his lips, and the surprise of my counterattack, took the last
  of Harry's sense of caution. He was maddened, just as much as I was warmed by
  self-confidence. I saw his nostrils flare and his eyes widen to the glare of
  a bull. He came in with his hands down, and I braced myself and took my time.
  I did not even have to time and check him with my left. I let him come wildly
  in and then clipped him with a beautiful right. It went as straight as the
  left, but it had just three times as much power, because it traveled just
  three times as far and as fast.</p>

  <p>This punch nailed him high on the cheek. Had it been an inch lower and
  nailed him on the jaw bone, the fight would have ended right there, and I
  know that if it had ended there, the troubles of the rest of my life would
  probably have been avoided, also. But after all, I begin to think that there
  was fate behind it&mdash;not my own will.</p>

  <p>At any rate, that blow was enough to knock him flat on his back with a
  force that drove the dust spurting out like water under the impact of his big
  body. But if he were dazed, he was not badly hurt. He scrambled to his feet
  at once, while I stood back and dropped my hands on my hips. I knew, now,
  that the game was in my hands.</p>

  <p>This fellow was big and very powerful, with just as much or more natural
  strength than I had; but he lacked the training and he lacked the seasoning
  of hard work which I had been doing in Father McGuire's gymnasium.</p>

  <p>So I stood back as he came rather uncertainly to his feet, and I sang out
  to the boys: "If any of you fellows are friends of this gent, call him off,
  before I do him a harm!"</p>

  <p>There was no interference. He who attempted to take the fight off my hands
  would simply have been transferring it to his own responsibility. My speech
  affected Harry Chase as a sort of stinging challenge, or a mockery. He came
  at me with the snarl of a wild cat.</p>

  <p>"I'll about kill you for that!" said Harry uncharitably.</p>

  <p>I hit him easily away from me with the left again.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to do this," said I to the little crowd. "You see that he's
  got me cornered, and that he won't quit."</p>

  <p>But they were delighted. They only yelled: "Give him the devil, Leon!"</p>

  <p>He was only a stranger, you see, and much too big a stranger for any of
  the other boys to handle. Now I am ashamed to confess that I did not mean
  what I had said. I had not the slightest desire to stop fighting. It was a
  full eight months since these fellows had seen me at work with my hands, and
  during those eight months I had been accumulating scientific fighting
  knowledge hand over hand.</p>

  <p>It was the secret desire which swelled in my heart to use this big chap as
  a chopping block and carve out of him a perfect demonstration of my ability.
  I wanted to dazzle them, and I set about doing it. At any time I could have
  put a merciful end to the sufferings of gallant Harry Chase by snapping
  across a long right-hander to the jaw. But I wouldn't do it. I started out to
  use him for my object lesson.</p>

  <p>He made a perfect subject. He was thrashing away with his hands in a
  manner that would have taken the heart out of every other boy in town. In
  fact, my audience stood aghast at the coolness with which I circled this
  madman as he raged, and, dipping in and out, picked at him with blows that
  shook him like hammer strokes. They thought that it was very gallant upon my
  part; they thought that I was the bravest boy in Arizona, by all odds.</p>

  <p>Of course I was simply taking advantage of the things which Father McGuire
  had taught me. I knew that those tremendous round-arm swings, after the style
  of the very blows which I myself had formerly used, were quite of no avail
  against a straight hitter who kept his wits about his head and his feet
  active beneath him.</p>

  <p>I danced about Harry Chase, slithering in and out through his thrashing
  arms, putting by his savage blows with cool parries, stepping back to let
  thundering sweeps whir past my face the split part of an inch away, and
  ducking under honestly intentioned knockout blows so that they skimmed my
  very hair and ruffled it but did no further harm.</p>

  <p>"Look at Leon!" my friends yelled. "He ain't got a mark on him!"</p>

  <p>In contrast&mdash;there was poor Harry Chase! I did not drive at the body,
  for fear of slowing him down. Punishment about the face stings more and saps
  the strength less. I had cut and dazed him, but he was as strong as ever. I
  had kept my promise of spoiling his clothes.</p>

  <p>Still he swabbed off his face with a quick hand, squinted at me out of his
  half-shut left eye&mdash;the right was a tight-closed mass of
  purple&mdash;and charged again, only to be knocked, spinning, away.</p>

  <p>Then I heard the voice of the sheriff, cutting through the noisy
  exultation of the boys in the street. I heard the sheriff calling: "Stop that
  massacre!"</p>

  <p>In another moment he would be on us and end the fight while Harry was
  still on his feet, and that I could not allow. He was rushing again, his
  mouth open, his face hideous but determined, and I stepped in and caught him
  with a full shot with the right hand, which lodged just beside the point of
  the chin, with all my weight, and all my lunging power, and all the whip of
  my strong arm behind it.</p>

  <p>Harry was tossed to the side like a feather before a puff of wind, and he
  lunged face down into the dust, where he lay without a quiver.</p>

  <p>The next instant the sheriff reached him with a bound. He scooped one arm
  under him as he raised the boy, he pointed his other hand grimly at me: "You,
  Porfilo&mdash;you stay here. I'm gonna have a talk with you!"</p>

  <p>I remained. The glory of victory was still a sweet taste in my mouth.</p>

  <p>The face of poor Harry Chase had looked bad enough before his last fall.
  But now, as the sheriff lifted the inert mass, the dust-clotted crimson on
  Harry's skin, his closed eyes, his thick, bleeding lips, made him look like a
  frightful caricature of humanity rather than the very handsome fellow he
  really was.</p>

  <p>The sheriff, tough fellow though he was, was shocked.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Harry Chase," said some one.</p>

  <p>"Chase's kid!" cried the sheriff with an oath, and he turned a baleful eye
  upon me.</p>

  <p>I should explain that Mr. Chase had moved into the community only a scant
  week before, and had spent part of his huge fortune to buy a great tract of
  range land. There is a difference between beating to a pulp the town boys,
  and attacking the son of a millionaire, a pillar of the church and of law and
  order in general. The sheriff's eye boded ill for me, but he said not a word
  until he had swabbed off the face of the boy and forced a sip of brandy
  between his lips.</p>

  <p>Harry was completely knocked out. It was several minutes before he could
  stand on his feet, and another minute or two before his head was sufficiently
  cleared to thrust him on the back of his dancing horse, which seemed to
  understand the indignity and the shame through which his master had just
  passed.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me the rights of this, Harry Chase," said the sheriff. "How did
  it begin?"</p>

  <p>"The talking I'll do about this," said Harry through his thickly mumbling
  lips, "will be with my fists&mdash;another day."</p>

  <p>He gave me a look as dark as he could make it through his narrowed slits
  of eyes. Then he climbed into the saddle and was off as fast as he could
  ride.</p>

  <p>The sheriff turned to the rest of us. "You're not through yet, Porfilo,"
  said he. "Boys, what sort of a club has he been usin' on the face of poor
  young Chase? Tell me the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Only his fists!" they chirped.</p>

  <p>The sheriff gave me a gloomy look and, coming to me, he took my hands and
  examined my knuckles. They were badly skinned from the battering-ram service
  which had been exacted from them.</p>

  <p>"Was this a fair fight?" asked the sheriff, staring at me, but obviously
  asking of the others.</p>

  <p>"Why, Chase began it!" piped a chorus. "Leon, he begged Chase to keep off
  of him, and Chase wouldn't!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff paused. Then he said to me: "All right, kid. But this here
  sort of fightin' ain't boy stuff no more. You've growed too big. Watch
  yourself, Porfilo, or you'll be in trouble&mdash;bad&mdash;one of these
  days!"</p>

  <p>I suppose that I might call it my entrance into manhood, that speech of
  the sheriff's. Also, it was a prophecy.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; FATHER M'GUIRE QUESTIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">That battle crowned me with a very new sort of glory. The
  other youngsters of Mendez had seen me rush into fights and absorb perhaps
  more punishment than I gave out until I battered the other fellow down by
  simply bulldogging my way through to the end. But this was very different.
  Style once seen, cannot be mistaken, and the clean-cut hitting and blocking
  and footwork which they had watched in me was a thrilling thing to my
  compatriots of Mendez. That day was a continual triumph to me, until I came
  back to the house of Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>There was something in his mind; I could tell that by the way he looked at
  me, but it seemed at first to be entirely jovial.</p>

  <p>"I hear," said the good priest, "that you have had a fight with big Harry
  Chase."</p>

  <p>"Where did you hear that?" said I, as any vain boy would have asked.</p>

  <p>"The whole town is talking of very little else," said Father McGuire. "You
  gave him a fine thumping, Leon?"</p>

  <p>He smiled at me. It seemed to me that I could feel his pride in me, and I
  expanded and swelled under the warmth of it.</p>

  <p>"He had enough before the finish," said I, and I was eager to tell him
  more. I wanted to dig into the details of that battle. There was no one else
  on the whole cattle range, I felt, who could understand the fine points of
  the work which I had done; there was no one else with whom it was really
  worth while to talk.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire took out his pipe and stuffed it carefully.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, "you had a big job on your hands, I see!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Why? Because he was older. Isn't he nineteen or twenty years old?"</p>

  <p>"He's seventeen&mdash;or maybe eighteen," said I.</p>

  <p>"But then he's much larger. I suppose he's fifteen or twenty pounds
  heavier than you are?"</p>

  <p>"Not ten," said I.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire shook his head. "Nevertheless it was a risky business,"
  said he. "Here was a fellow older, heavier, and stronger than you are"</p>

  <p>"Who said that he is stronger than I?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, but he must be, Lee. He has such a reputation!"</p>

  <p>"I dunno what gave him the reputation," said I aggressively, for I hated
  the imputation that any boy of my own age or thereabout might be greater in
  sheer might of hand than I.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Father McGuire, "we know that he's the younger brother of the
  famous Andrew Chase"</p>

  <p>I was hugely impressed by this. As a matter of fact, I had not heard
  anything about the Chase family in particular since they had come into our
  section of the range. But of a certain Andrew Chase I had heard vague reports
  from time to time.</p>

  <p>"But Andrew Chase is a middle-aged man, isn't he?" said I.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire smiled. "Will you call twenty-one, middle-age?" said
  he.</p>

  <p>"Ah? Is he only that age? How have we happened to hear so much of him? Has
  he been a killer? Is he still?"</p>

  <p>I was swelling with enthusiasm. Father McGuire looked a little sadly, a
  little sternly, upon me.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you never have to know Andrew Chase any better than you know
  him now," said he. "As a matter of fact, he has not been a killer. Andrew is
  a hero, my boy."</p>

  <p>"What has he done?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know," smiled Father McGuire. "There are some people who impress
  the world in that way. They really don't have to do things. It is simply
  known that, when the time comes, they can do great things. I suppose that it
  is that way with Andrew Chase."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see how much of a hero he is!" said I, bristling at the
  thought. For were not my knuckles still sore from the thumping which I had
  given to his brother?</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will have a chance to find out what sort of a man he is,"
  said Father McGuire, looking fixedly at me. "But I hope not, my boy. I
  sincerely hope not!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I would be afraid of him?" said I, on fire.</p>

  <p>He waved a hand as though banishing a question which was not to the point.
  "However," said he, "I am glad that you were able to handle Harry."</p>

  <p>"I did that!" said I, with a great grin of satisfaction. "I wish that you
  had been there to watch!"</p>

  <p>"I wish that I had!" said he, with an apparent warmth of
  gratification.</p>

  <p>"He came off his horse and rushed at me like a mad bull!" said I.</p>

  <p>"Weren't you a little afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Just for a minute&mdash;I was. I'd never stood up to any one who came
  smashing in like that&mdash;as though I were nothing, you see. But even if I
  was rattled, you had put enough sense into my hands and my arms. They took
  care of me until I woke up and saw that I could manage this big plunging chap
  well enough."</p>

  <p>"You weren't long in getting your confidence!"</p>

  <p>"Not long. I tried him with a few straight lefts&mdash;your own brand.
  Well, father, they went through his guard as if he didn't have one! All I had
  to do after that was to stand away and keep bobbing his head with my left.
  You would have thought that his face was tied to my fist by a rubber string,
  they connected so often!"</p>

  <p>I laughed with the brutal joy of that recollection, and Father McGuire was
  seized with a violent fit of coughing which forced him to cover his face with
  one hand. When he spoke again, he was looking down at the floor, and not at
  me.</p>

  <p>"But didn't he try to close with you, Lee?"</p>

  <p>"He did. But&mdash;he wasn't even as strong as I am! Oh, yes, he was
  strong, and he was pretty hot to kill me, you might say. That made him enough
  to scare the strength out of most people. But I found after a grip or two
  that he didn't have much weight on me and that I was really a lot stronger
  than he. Besides, he didn't know the first thing about wrestling. He didn't
  know a single grip!"</p>

  <p>I laughed again, dropping my head far back and letting the chuckle shake
  me to my very toes.</p>

  <p>"When you saw that, he was pretty much at your mercy?" said Father
  McGuire.</p>

  <p>"I begged him not to come in after me," said I. "I knew that I could do
  anything I wanted with him."</p>

  <p>"When did you find that out?" asked Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>"Oh, before we'd swung our fists more than two or three times."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't stop?"</p>

  <p>"No. He kept coming in. So I gave him a lesson he won't forget! I tried
  everything you ever taught me, Father McGuire. I tried jabs in close, and
  straight punches, and half-arm rips and smashes, and overhand dropping
  punches that went smashing all the way down his face, and uppercuts short and
  full arm. I hooked and even swung; and then I hit straight. Oh, it was
  great!</p>

  <p>"I did everything but play for his body; I wanted to leave some strength
  in him to stand up till the finish&mdash;but when I heard the sheriff coming,
  I knew that I couldn't play with Chase any more. So I tried a full-arm smash
  at him. You know that driving right that you've taught me, with just a bit of
  hook at the end of it? I gave him that. You'd of thought that I'd hit him on
  the back of the head with a mallet, the way he dived into the dust! You'd of
  laughed, Father McGuire!"</p>

  <p>Father McGuire jumped suddenly out of his chair and began to walk up and
  down the room. It was a great thing to see his nervous, quick steps. I felt
  that he was fighting the battle through again from beginning to end and
  rejoicing in having such a fine pupil as I.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he said to me: "Go harness the horse to the buggy, Leon."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything wrong?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I'm too much moved to talk to you about it now," said Father McGuire.
  "But I want you to go and harness that horse at once. Then bring it around to
  the front of the house. Hurry, Leon!"</p>

  <p>I could see that he was very excited; and what he was excited about had to
  do with my description of the fight, I had no doubt. However, I knew that it
  would not be wise to speak to him about it now. I had formed the habit of
  obedience while I was under his rule.</p>

  <p>So I went out to the pasture and called the horse and harnessed it when
  the good-natured old beast came to my call. In a few minutes I had the buggy
  and the horse in front of the house. I found that Father McGuire was already
  waiting at the gate. He climbed into the rig and took the reins.</p>

  <p>"Run inside for your hat and your coat," said he.</p>

  <p>"Do I go with you?" said I.</p>

  <p>"You do," said he. "But now, hurry as fast as you can! This thing that we
  have to do must be done together."</p>

  <p>I did as he directed, and presently we whirled away down the street, and
  out of the dingy blackness of Mendez to the open plains, where the stars
  burned twice as low and twice as bright, with a thousand miles of stillness
  lying on either hand. We jogged on for five miles, and then Father McGuire
  turned the horse into the lane that led for the new Chase house!</p>

  <p>I could not believe it, at first. I turned in the seat and stared down at
  the erect, square-shouldered outline of the little priest. How familiar that
  silhouette was, with the head thrusting a little forward, eagerly!</p>

  <p>I began to grow afraid. I could never tell what was passing in that brain
  of his. I really knew him less at the end of eight months' living with him
  than I had known him at the beginning. What was his purpose now?</p>

  <p>He was sufficiently mysterious to me to make me realize that I must make
  no question of him; and I also realized that whatever he intended must be
  right. I could not imagine him doing a wrong thing. However, no boy is
  entirely interested in "right" for its own sake. The end is the thing that
  the boy has his attention fastened upon, and he does not particularly care
  about the means to that end.</p>

  <p>We stopped at the hitching rack before the house and I, getting down and
  taking the hitching rope from the back of the buggy, was lost in wonder at
  the dimensions of the big building.</p>

  <p>I had seen it before, when the Carey family lived here. I had even
  delivered meat at the door. But Mr. Chase had ordered the remodeling of the
  place on an extensive scale before he came to take up his residence in it. It
  was three stories, instead of two, and it soared above me like a mountain. It
  rambled away on either side in wings, either one of which was larger than the
  biggest house in little Mendez town. Here and there was a lighted window,
  dotting the great outline of the big place rather than illuminating it.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; LEON'S APOLOGY</h2>

  <p class="first">We went up to the front door, with Father McGuire walking
  briskly in the lead; I lagged to the rear, more unwilling with every step
  that we took. In answer to the bell, a servant opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Father McGuire wishes to see Mr. Chase on an important matter," said the
  little priest.</p>

  <p>We were ushered into a lofty hall. It ran to the uppermost roof of the
  house, and I lifted my eyes with awe up the shadowy walls of that spacious
  chamber. Then we were led into a little room at the side. I remained
  standing, and so did Father McGuire, with his eyes bent upon the floor.</p>

  <p>Then a brisk, heavy step sounded through the hall, and I saw a florid man
  with a vivacious eye and a well-trimmed, blond mustache standing before us.
  He went up to the priest and offered his hand.</p>

  <p>"You are Father McGuire?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I am," said my friend. "I have come to introduce you to young Leon
  Porfilo."</p>

  <p>He nodded to me.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Chase, Leon."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" said the rancher, and he looked at me with a sudden stiffening of
  his upper lip, which reminded me of his son's expression as he rushed into
  battle. "How do you do, Leon Porfilo," said he, without shaking hands.</p>

  <p>"What I have to say," said Father McGuire, "I wish to say before all your
  family, Mr. Chase. I want Mrs. Chase to hear it. I wish to have your elder
  son present. I particularly wish to have Harry Chase in the room."</p>

  <p>The rancher flushed a little and looked not at the priest but straight at
  me, until I wished myself a thousand miles from that spot. I idled restlessly
  from foot to foot on the thick rug.</p>

  <p>"Harry," said Mr. Chase, "as you probably know, is not presentable this
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said Father McGuire, "it is very important that he should
  be one of those to hear what we have to say!"</p>

  <p>I was disturbed by the plural. What did I have to say? I had not the
  slightest idea!</p>

  <p>"Do you consider it important?" said Mr. Chase, with a cold little
  sneering smile, which again was familiar to me from my meeting with his
  son.</p>

  <p>"I consider it important&mdash;very," said Father McGuire, and his intent
  eyes drew back the glance of Mr. Chase until the sneer disappeared from his
  face.</p>

  <p>"This is very odd," said the rich man.</p>

  <p>"It is very necessary," corrected Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>Mr. Chase suddenly snapped his fingers. "You interest me," said he. "You
  shall have it your own way."</p>

  <p>He took us down the hall and into a big living room where a little lady
  was tinkling the keys of a big piano.</p>

  <p>She was Mrs. Chase, very slender, with a girlish figure and a face still
  beautiful&mdash;as dark in complexion and eyes and hair, as her husband was
  fair. She shook hands most cordially with Father McGuire, but when she heard
  my name, she started and gave me a look of horror as though a snake had
  crawled across her path. Poor lady, if she could have looked a little more
  deeply into the future, she would have loathed me in very fact!</p>

  <p>Then I was presented, with the priest, to the elder son, Andrew. He was
  like his father in bulk. He was like his mother in the graceful finish of his
  face and his body, and in his black hair and his dark, bright eyes.</p>

  <p>He had a cool, calm way with him that sent a shiver through me.</p>

  <p>He said to Father McGuire: "I don't understand why your young friend
  should be here tonight."</p>

  <p>I suppose no one could have thought of a more insulting speech; I wanted
  to kill him&mdash;or to flee from the house! Then I heard Mr. Chase
  exclaiming: "Andrew! No more of that! We are to have Harry with us,
  also."</p>

  <p>"Harry?" said Andrew, giving me a flashing glance that went through me
  like a sword blade. "An infernal outrage! Do you want to humiliate the poor
  boy again?"</p>

  <p>However, Mr. Chase sent for Harry; and he talked easily enough through the
  following heavy pause until Harry appeared with his face criss-crossed with
  bandages. Only one eye was exposed, and that looked forth through a
  discolored slit. When he saw me, he stopped short, and then he whirled on his
  father in a rage.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want me here, sir?" said he.</p>

  <p>Mr. Chase waved to Father McGuire. "You see," said he, "that this makes
  quite a commotion in my house. I suppose that you have something to say to
  us, father?"</p>

  <p>"I have come," said Father McGuire, "in the first place to apologize for
  the outrageous thing which my young protigi has done to-day!"</p>

  <p>"Come, come," broke in Andrew Chase. "There's no need of apologies!
  Apologies don't make the thing any better. Harry has simply been thrashed.
  Words don't help matters!"</p>

  <p>"Young man," said the fiery priest, "you speak too quickly about important
  matters. You lack a quarter of a century of life; when you reach that age you
  will know better than to speak without forethought. I have come to tell you
  that there is no cause for Harry Chase to feel any shame."</p>

  <p>"That's a rare one," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"If you please, Andrew!" said his father with much dignity.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire wheeled on Andrew, saying: "Would you be ashamed of your
  brother if he had been beaten by a professional pugilist?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not."</p>

  <p>"What I wish to tell you in the first place is that Leon Porfilo has been
  practicing boxing under my instruction for the greater part of a year. A
  match between him and an untrained boy is as bad as a match between a man
  armed with a rapier and another armed with a paper knife.</p>

  <p>"The thing which he has done today, in taking advantage of his skill and
  his training to batter a boy who probably has never had a moment of
  scientific training&mdash;is simply a frightful outrage. I have come to tell
  you that I feel this thing. I am covered with shame because of it. I believe
  that Leon himself realizes that he has done a shameful thing!"</p>

  <p>It was quite a staggering position for me, as you may imagine. I felt the
  very floor shaking beneath my feet, but I felt, also, the burning eyes of
  Father McGuire upon me. What he had said was a revelation to me. The sudden
  frankness and the bitter truth of his words rushed in on me. I saw that the
  thing of which I had been so proud was, in reality, worthy of nothing but a
  great, black shame.</p>

  <p>I managed to make myself take a step or two out in front of Father
  McGuire. I was trembling and about as sick as any boy has ever been in this
  world, because a boy's pride is almost his whole soul, his whole
  existence!</p>

  <p>I said in a gasping voice: "I didn't see it that way when we were
  fighting, Harry. But I see it now. II acted like a dog, because I knew more
  than you did. I want to&mdash;beg your pardon."</p>

  <p>I wonder if I have felt such a consummate agony as I did at that moment,
  dragging that apology up from the most exquisitely sensitive roots of my
  soul.</p>

  <p>I think every one was a little astonished and shocked; there was too much
  shame and pride and suffering in my voice and my face to go as a light thing;
  and there was a bit of a hush until Andrew Chase said carelessly:</p>

  <p>"Well, Harry, there you are. I suppose that makes up for the good beating
  you got."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Harry. "I'll never stop until I've beaten him worse than he
  beat me! I'll never stop until he's"</p>

  <p>"Harry!" cried his mother. "What are you saying?"</p>

  <p>"I'll never stop," cried Harry, "until I've had him on his knees, begging
  for mercy&mdash;with other people to hear him beg!"</p>

  <p>There were exclamations from his father and his mother that half covered
  these words. But when he was ended, I heard Andrew Chase say with a contented
  smile:</p>

  <p>"That's a very good way to put it, Harry. I love you for that!"</p>

  <p>It is one thing to humiliate oneself in order to make an apology. It is
  another thing to tender the apology and have it refused. I felt a hot burst
  of emotion against Father McGuire for having brought me into this
  predicament; what the others had to say I hardly marked, but I heard Father
  McGuire saying:</p>

  <p>"This is an extremely unreasonable attitude, Mr. Chase. I trust that you
  realize it!"</p>

  <p>"In matters of common sense," the proud man answered, "I interfere with
  the affairs of my sons. In matters of honor, I trust them to find the right
  way. After all, your young friend admits that he has brought this trouble
  upon his own head!"</p>

  <p>Father McGuire was angered, and he showed it. He said: "My hope now is
  that no harm will come out of this matter. My meaning by that is: No greater
  harm than has been done already."</p>

  <p>"What may you mean by that?" asked Mr. Chase, frowning.</p>

  <p>"If you do not understand now," said Father McGuire, "I trust that the
  meaning of what I say will never be made clear to you later on."</p>

  <p>He bade them good night and took me with him from the house. I was never
  so glad to leave any place.</p>

  <p>On the way home, he gave me the reins.</p>

  <p>"She steps out for you better," he explained. "Besides, I'm too angry to
  trust myself to the handling of a horse."</p>

  <p>We had flown down the road at a fast clip for a mile or more and turned
  onto the main highway before he touched my arm.</p>

  <p>"I am proud of you, Leon," said he. "I could not tell you beforehand how
  you should act at the house of Mr. Chase. I wanted to see if you had enough
  pride and sense to see what was the right way. I think that you have done
  enough! More than any other young man of this community would have done. It
  was a handsome apology, all things considered. It was a handsome apology,
  after I put you so brutally in the wrong. I think you have done quite
  enough!"</p>

  <p>He repeated these things in this manner for several moments, and I could
  see that he was highly excited. During the rest of the ride, he broke out
  from time to time in the same fashion. He would ask me questions which were
  already answered in his own mind and which therefore required no comment from
  me.</p>

  <p>"If there is evil, now, let it be upon their own heads! We have done
  enough. We have gone more than halfway!"</p>

  <p>Or again he cried suddenly: "Did you notice that handsome rascal, Andrew
  Chase? Do you understand now why it is that a man does not have to do great
  things before he is considered a great man?"</p>

  <p>I could understand very readily. Little as Andrew had said, I knew him. I
  felt his steady nerve, his cruel pride, his dauntless courage. When one sees
  a great locomotive panting and trembling on the rails, one's sense of power
  is almost as great as though it is seen dragging a great train up a sharp
  grade.</p>

  <p>We reached home, and Father McGuire said no more to me on the subject for
  a full three weeks. Then he came home one night with a darkened forehead and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Young Harry Chase is taking boxing lessons. Have you heard of that?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that I had not.</p>

  <p>He went on to tell me that Andrew had cast about for some time looking for
  a proper instructor. He himself was a fine boxer, as he did all things well.
  But he wanted a still more expert man to give Harry his tuition. Finally one
  had been found. He was an ex-pugilist who had made something of a stir in the
  middleweight ranks until a broken jaw, which refused to knit properly, had
  made him retire from the ranks of the professional pugilists.</p>

  <p>"You understand, Leon, what this means," said Father McGuire, and there he
  dropped the subject.</p>

  <p>But I understood very well, of course. I had a too vivid picture of those
  two big men struggling together, while the pugilist stood by and corrected
  their errors&mdash;or, rather, the errors of Harry, for it was hard to
  imagine Andrew Chase doing anything wrong. If he hit, he would by nature
  strike, and strike hard. If he blocked, he could not fail to pick off the
  flying hand that shot toward him. How vastly Harry would stride forward in
  this manner, with a marvelous sparring partner and an excellent teacher every
  day!</p>

  <p>Moreover, the entire district heard of what was happening, and the entire
  district waited in suspense.</p>

  <p>It was considered the height of sporting correctness, among those
  Westerners. Since I had learned to box, it was thought very fit and proper
  that Harry Chase should perfect himself as much as possible and then
  challenge me to a fight fairly and in the open. Had the Chase family been
  other than upright and fair, it was pointed out that they could have used
  their enormous influence in many ways to make my life miserable.</p>

  <p>I suppose, for my part, that Mr. Chase looked upon this proceeding on the
  part of his son with as much approval as any one else. He could not see, any
  more than the others could see, the dreadful results which would eventually
  roll out of this small beginning. It seemed no more than play, boyish
  rivalry! But I, in fact, understood vaguely what was coming. Not fully or
  directly, or I should have fled from the country and taken a new name and
  gone to hide myself from the tragedy which was coming. But it was only a dim
  premonition.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire had brought home that thought to me by the dark suggestions
  which were in the speech he had made to the Chase family on the unforgettable
  night. He called the same forebodings into my mind one day when he said to
  me:</p>

  <p>"Are you still working in the gymnasium, Leon?"</p>

  <p>I told him that I was going through my paces every day for a full two
  hours. He looked at my drawn face and pink cheeks and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yet, Leon," said he, "I think that the wisest thing would be for you to
  leave this district and go some place else!"</p>

  <p>"Run away from Harry Chase!" cried I.</p>

  <p>"Not from Harry Chase&mdash;but from his brother and from yourself!" said
  Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>I could only gape at him. I could understand that Andrew, in time, might
  become a menace to me. But what danger lay in my own nature, I could not for
  the moment see. I was to learn in good time.</p>

  <p>But Father McGuire did not stop at good advice. When he saw that my pride
  was sure to keep me at my task and sure to keep me ready for Harry Chase
  whenever that strong young man was prepared to tackle me, the priest gave
  over all talk. He simply made it a point to go out to our little gymnasium
  with me every day and spar.</p>

  <p>Marksmanship in boxing becomes of vital importance, and Father McGuire
  encouraged my practice by devising a novel idea which, I think, was unique
  with him. He plastered a bit of tape just in front of the second big knuckle
  on either hand. Then he marked four targets on the big sand bag, one to
  correspond with either side of a man's chin, one for the pit of the stomach,
  one for the spot beneath the heart.</p>

  <p>None of those targets&mdash;which were merely bits of white
  tape&mdash;were larger than half an inch in diameter. Then the tapes on my
  hands were blackened and the sand bag was started swinging back and forth
  rapidly. When I attacked that shifting bag, I was supposed to strike at those
  targets and land on them and on no other spots.</p>

  <p>It would astonish you to hear how often I missed and how seldom I landed
  accurately. There is a temptation, as every boxer knows, to squint the eyes
  under the physical strain of striking a blow. I learned to keep my eyes open
  all the time and watch the work of my hands to the instant they landed. I had
  to learn, not only to hit to the vital target, but also to hit with all my
  force. For accuracy is useless without the full punching power behind it.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the weeks turned into months, and still there was no
  appearance of young Harry Chase in the streets of the little town of Mendez.
  I understood this, also. He was a headlong fellow, but his brother, Andrew,
  the controlling genius of the family, had seen the effects of my work upon
  Harry, and knew that there would have to be great work before Harry was able
  to face me upon even terms.</p>

  <p>The winter passed. The spring came. I was seventeen, and I had filled out
  to something of my full stature. I weighed, at that time, a little more than
  a hundred and seventy-five pounds; and though it was all hard, effective
  weight, my efforts to follow the gyrations of Father McGuire when he boxed
  with me had kept my footwork light and easy, and my boxing fast and sure.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, there was a good deal of talk in Mendez, and most of it
  was not complimentary to the courage of Harry Chase. He would never be ready
  for the fight, they said. But I had no doubts on that score. I had seen
  Andrew Chase, and I knew his power of will. So, on a fine, clear day in the
  first week of May, I was not surprised when young Sam Harrison came running
  to Father McGuire's house to tell me that Harry Chase was in the town and
  asking for me.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; A BIT OF STRATEGY</h2>

  <p class="first">I cannot help wondering, often, why they had not arranged to
  fight this battle in some secluded barn. I suppose it was because Andrew
  insisted on having the affair fought under conditions of ground and scene
  which would duplicate the first event. Men and women and boys of Mendez had
  seen his brother frightfully and shamefully beaten in the first place. He
  proposed that Harry should beat me with equal violence, in the same
  place&mdash;and with the same number of witnesses.</p>

  <p>The same number? The street was alive with people as I walked down its
  length. Work was stopped. Women crowded the upper windows, and there was a
  flying cloud of boys, big and small, come out to be on the site of the
  encounter.</p>

  <p>I saw the three of them, finally, as I turned the corner into the old
  Mexican plaza which was the center of the village. They were coming across
  the open plot, and I went slowly toward them, very white of face, I am
  afraid, and very stiff of body. In my stomach there was a feeling of waterish
  weakness.</p>

  <p>There was Andrew Chase, first of all, no taller than his younger brother,
  and scarcely as bulky, but lifted out from the others as a tiger is
  distinguishable among mere cattle. At his side was his younger brother,
  looking drawn and fit for action, and rosy-faced with self-confidence. On the
  farther side of Harry was a thick-shouldered man with a broad, twisted face.
  That was Dan Rowley, the prize fighter. I had no need to be told that. I
  felt, somehow, that although I had to fight one of the trio only, the weight
  of the brains of the entire three would overwhelm me.</p>

  <p>Andrew stepped out before the others. He came up to me and said simply
  enough: "I suppose you know why Harry is in town?"</p>

  <p>I had to gulp down a cold lump in my throat, before I could admit that I
  did surmise why he had come.</p>

  <p>Andrew lingered an instant, with contempt in his eyes as he noted my
  pallor. Then he turned on his heel and went back to his brother.</p>

  <p>He said, loud enough for every member of that densely gathering crowd to
  hear him: "I don't think you'll have enough work to warm you up, Harry. He's
  in a blue funk!"</p>

  <p>That, if you like, was a cruel speech. It brought upon me an instant
  focusing of many eyes. Then anxious voices began to mutter behind me:</p>

  <p>"Don't lay down to him, kid! He's bigger, but you'll beat him. He can't
  lick you, Lee!"</p>

  <p>He was, in fact, a vital matter of ten or fifteen pounds heavier; and he
  had that great additional advantage of an extra year. Every year at that
  young season of life helps to harden and toughen a boy's muscle.</p>

  <p>I gave my supporters a wan smile and replied by silently stripping off my
  coat and then my shirt. I tightened my belt and stood out, naked to the
  waist. It caused a little murmur of enthusiastic applause. In fact, I was
  well trained. My chest was already arching as manhood increased upon me; my
  arms were alive with long, sinewy muscles, and my neck was growing
  heavier.</p>

  <p>That murmur died away entirely when Harry Chase followed my example and
  showed across the breast and shoulders, beneath a stretched filament of
  transparent skin, thick, rubbery cushions of muscle, and deep currents of
  power playing up and down his arms like currents of shifting quicksilver, at
  every movement of his hands.</p>

  <p>I suppose that each of us looked three years older as we squared off. I
  was grave, thoughtful, and&mdash;frankly&mdash;very weak with fear. Harry
  Chase was fairly bursting with a confident sense of his power and of the
  great new art of self-defense into which he had been initiated so
  thoroughly.</p>

  <p>How thoroughly, I could tell by his manner of looking eagerly into my eyes
  as he put up his hands, and by the easy, graceful manner in which he came
  into his guard&mdash;nothing rigid in an inch of his big body.</p>

  <p>I knew it would be a fight and a real one, this time. But I did not think
  any too well of my chances. How much I should have given for the kindly,
  shrewd face of Father McGuire behind me!</p>

  <p>The crowd thought no better of me than I did of myself. I looked big and
  strong, but Harry seemed still larger and still more powerful. Besides, he
  overmatched me quite with his bubbling confidence and his handsome, smiling
  face.</p>

  <p>"I'll put down fifty bones on Harry Chase!" bellowed a cow-puncher.</p>

  <p>"I'll lay you three to one on Chase!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, pikers, take a breath! A hundred to twenty on Harry Chase."</p>

  <p>It was a veritable roar, and the more they talked the smaller was the
  chance of their finding a backer for me until a sharp voice cut across them:
  "I'll take every bet on Chase. I'll take you at your own odds. Here, you,
  where's that hundred to twenty? Here's my twenty. Here's some
  more&mdash;plenty more for anybody who wants to bet!"</p>

  <p>I turned and saw a gray-headed, thin-faced man with a very solemn face,
  and both hands filled with money. He saw me turn and he said: "I think you
  can lick that big sucker, kid. Do you think so?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said I, with a little warming of my blood.</p>

  <p>"If you don't know, it's a bad sign," said he in his crisp way. "But
  remember one thing&mdash;the first blood isn't the last blood!"</p>

  <p>He was quite right about one part of his speech, at least. First blood
  went to Harry Chase, and he drew it with his first blow&mdash;which was a
  long-sliding straight left that would have made Father McGuire shout with
  admiration. It darted over my tardy, feeble guard as we squared off, and it
  landed fairly on the end of my nose, with a tingling force that snapped my
  head back and brought the warm blood. My nose had turned numb, but I could
  taste my own blood on my lips.</p>

  <p>"Follow up!" cried Andrew Chase. "In at him, Harry! The body!"</p>

  <p>That was a very neat bit of strategy&mdash;to drive at my body while I was
  a bit off balance. But the sound of Andrew's voice roused me to desperation.
  The hands of big Harry were enough against me. The wits of Andrew Chase were
  a frightful handicap. Like a cornered rat, I opened my eyes and began to
  fight as if for my life.</p>

  <p>I caught two smashing blows by jerking out my elbows, and I saw the face
  of Harry wither with pain as his hands landed on the sharp bones.</p>

  <p>Then I went in with my first attack. But my fighting spirit still was not
  up, and his skill was immensely improved. I merely found myself hammering at
  forearms on which my punches landed; then a darting right caught me at the
  base of the jaw and knocked me staggering.</p>

  <p>There was no pause. Harry Chase would not wait for new and easy chances.
  He followed up every advantage with a lunge like a bull. Plainly that wise
  brother of his had not attempted to remake the nature of Harry, but had
  simply added skill to his natural disposition to attack, and still attack,
  savagely, relentlessly. Harry came swarming after me, and I tried my first
  trick, which was to lean forward and wrap my arms around my head.</p>

  <p>"He's quitting!" screamed a dozen disgusted voices. "He's got enough."</p>

  <p>Harry Chase, gasping with a savage joy, hammered at my well-protected
  head, unheeding the wise shouts of his brother to straighten me up with an
  uppercut. When both of Harry's hands were flung wide in the eager fury of his
  assault, I uncovered suddenly and took Andrew's advice myself by snapping my
  right fist up under the chin of Harry.</p>

  <p>Oh, wise Father McGuire! That sharp-shooting practice stood me in good
  stead now. It was not a tremendously powerful blow, but it landed so neatly
  on the button that Harry Chase reeled away. I slid in after him, brought his
  guard down with a long blow to the body, and then dropped him in his tracks
  with a neat right cross that hummed over to the point of the chin.</p>

  <p>I stood back in the midst of a wild turmoil; but all I saw was not the
  fallen fellow on the ground, but the face of Andrew Chase, cold with anger as
  he fixed his black eyes upon me.</p>

  <p>"Take your time, Harry," said Andrew, still with his eyes fixed grimly
  upon me. "This is a finish fight, and there's no referee to count you out.
  Take your time and get up when your head has cleared."</p>

  <p>The answer of Harry was a roar of fury, and he bounded to his feet to
  charge again.</p>

  <p>Not the blind charges of our first fight. He fought with a wicked skill,
  in spite of his passion. But still, anger is a cloudy emotion. It dimmed the
  eyes of Chase, and my own were wide open. I caught him with two long, raking
  punches as he came in and then, ducking his swings, I opened on his body.</p>

  <p>Brave and strong as he was, that fire weakened him and sent him back,
  gasping. My work was written upon his ribs in crimson splotches, and all
  around me was an uproar as the backers of Harry strove to hedge their
  bets.</p>

  <p>He charged again, and for the first time I met him with all my might. It
  was only a left-hander, but that hook spatted against his mouth and laid him
  flat on his back.</p>

  <p>I knew, with a feeling of a strange relief, rather than a great leap of
  the spirit, that this fight was in my hands, as the first one had been.</p>

  <p>Before he was up, I said to Andrew Chase: "He can't hurt me, and I can
  hurt him. Will you take him off?"</p>

  <p>"He'll tear you in two, in a moment," said Andrew, and he was white with a
  torment of shame and crushed pride. This was his own brother, his own flesh,
  that was going down before me. He could not forget it; in fact, he never
  did.</p>

  <p>But Harry did not tear me in two.</p>

  <p>As he came up: "Stand off and box!" commanded Andrew.</p>

  <p>Harry obeyed and stood off to box at long range. It was no use. That was
  not his natural style. If I could get my gloves past the skillful guard of
  Father McGuire, I could certainly flash my bare fists past the arms of Harry
  Chase. I did. His hair leaped on his head as my blows thudded home.</p>

  <p>I turned him halfway round with an overhand right that made his knees sag,
  and the dazed look in his eyes was reflected sharply by a look of anguish and
  almost terror in the eyes of Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Clinch!" shouted Andrew, and poor Harry swung about and lurched in to
  obey orders.</p>

  <p>The habit of obedience to that voice, built of a life of custom, reached
  even his punch-dazed brain. I let him come in, and then tied up his arms in a
  clinch&mdash;which is a neat little art in itself.</p>

  <p>I said over his shoulder: "You fellows see that Harry Chase isn't good
  enough to lick me. Will you stop this fight before I have to hurt him?"</p>

  <p>Andrew stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Have you had enough of this, Porfilo?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I? No, he's hardly touched me."</p>

  <p>"The yellow comes out on a greaser sooner or later," said Andrew,
  sneering. "I thought it might be coming out in you!"</p>

  <p>It was about as nasty a speech as anyone could have devised, and it was
  greeted with a heavy silence from the circle around me. I let Harry Chase
  tear himself away from me. There was a devil in me then. I caught poor Harry
  with two cutting blows to the face that brought a gush of crimson each
  time.</p>

  <p>"Has he had enough?" I shouted to Andrew Chase.</p>

  <p>"You cur!" breathed Andrew Chase. "You'll be ripe for me, one of these
  days!"</p>

  <p>Again his speech was greeted with silence. As for me, I was beginning to
  see red in my rage. I slashed Harry across the face again, and as he
  staggered, I plunged my right hand into the pit of his stomach. He doubled up
  and fell with a grunt. There he lay, kicking and squirming in the dust, quite
  winded. I stepped across his fallen body and said to Andrew Chase:</p>

  <p>"You called me a greaser, Chase. Do you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Are you ashamed of your race?" sneered he.</p>

  <p>"You're older and stronger than I am," said I, "but I won't stand for
  that."</p>

  <p>"What will you do about it, then, Porfilo?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I'll have your apology," said I, beginning to tremble.</p>

  <p>"My apology?" said he, and smiled.</p>

  <p>I struck out that smile by flicking my open hand across his face, and the
  next instant a thunderbolt struck me to the ground.</p>

  <p>It was the fist of Andrew Chase. I had heard of blinding speed before, but
  this was as inescapable as the lightning flash to which I have compared it.
  The blow landed fairly on my chin; I felt a concussion at the base of my
  head; and I dropped into deep darkness.</p>

  <p>When I recovered, there was still a spinning blackness before my eyes. In
  the swirl I detected many faces, and I struggled to my feet, when I staggered
  dizzily.</p>

  <p>"Where's Andrew Chase?" I asked.</p>

  <p>But Andrew Chase was gone. He had left and taken his brother with him long
  before I recovered from the trance into which his fist had knocked me.</p>

  <p>Now, as my head cleared, and as I realized what had happened, I found
  strained, stern faces around me and many eyes that looked upon me with a sort
  of intense hatred. But that hatred was not for me. It was for the thing which
  I had been forced to suffer. I saw the lean, gray-headed man come through the
  rest, and he took my hand.</p>

  <p>"It was a low thing," said he. "How old are you, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Seventeen," said I.</p>

  <p>He turned and spat in the dust. "He's seventeen!" said he to the
  others.</p>

  <p>They nodded their confirmation.</p>

  <p>"How old is Andrew Chase?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two," said several voices.</p>

  <p>"A grown man and a boy," said the little stranger. "Do you allow this
  thing to pass like this? Is that the Arizona way?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want help," said I. "I'll handle my own affairs. Andrew Chase is
  too much for me now, but I'm not at my full strength, yet."</p>

  <p>The little man turned his gray head to me again. "If I'm not mistaken,"
  said he, "there'll be a little nest of hell raised around this town as a
  memento of today. The rest of you can write down what I say. Keep it in mind.
  Keep it in red. Some day a bomb will break. Then I should not like to be in
  the boots of the Chase family!"</p>

  <p>That black day was not relieved by the homecoming of Father McGuire, who
  found me with my books spread out before me on the library table and my head
  buried in my hands. He sat down opposite me. I was too sick at heart to look
  up at him.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he, "I have heard everything."</p>

  <p>I did not answer.</p>

  <p>He went on: "I made a point of asking from several eye-witnesses. Each of
  them gave me a picture that was a little blacker that the one before.
  Personally, I cannot understand it! Andrew Chase is not the sort of a man who
  could do such a thing. It isn't possible. It isn't in his eyes or his speech.
  I can't imagine it in his heart."</p>

  <p>Still I did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Have you made up your mind about what you will do, Leon?" said he at the
  last.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait," said I bitterly. "It's all that I can do, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"Is it too much to ask you to forget?" said he.</p>

  <p>At this, I looked up indeed! I smiled at him. "It's too much!" said I. "A
  hundred people saw him do it, and they'll never forget. How can you ask me
  to?"</p>

  <p>Father McGuire rose and walked restlessly around the room, striking his
  hands together and then dragging them apart.</p>

  <p>"The thing grows," said he. "It grows every moment! I had a foreboding of
  it before, but now I feel the certainty of it. The pride of Andrew
  Chase&mdash;that's the keystone of the arch! It will never stop working until
  he has ruined everything! How many lives will be involved?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A PROPOSITION</h2>

  <p class="first">I have no doubt that, had it been any person other than
  Andrew Chase, the community would have taken action, and very stern action,
  against him. But he was the son of the richest and most respected man in the
  whole range; and he was also Andrew Chase! To see him, to conceive of him,
  was to conceive and see a person incapable of a small or knavish action. He
  might be capable of some crime, but it would have to be upon a grand scale.
  But Andrew Chase in the role of a bully? Surely not!</p>

  <p>I myself, thinking of the matter, could hardly see him again doing the
  very thing which the purple lump on my chin was evidence that he had done. He
  might be a thousand things&mdash;but surely never a bully!</p>

  <p>I do not believe that it was the pressure of any public opinion, which
  made him do what he next attempted. The thing came out of his own mind and
  his own heart, and I suppose that I have to admit that it was worthy of him.
  The hatred which I feel now for Andrew was built up in after years. He had
  changed from his youth before he accomplished the things which make me loathe
  him now!</p>

  <p>At any rate, that same evening, as we were finishing our coffee after
  supper, old Mimsy answered the doorbell and came scurrying back in a fright
  to tell us that Mr. Andrew Chase had just arrived to call upon us.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire gave me a look which was eloquent enough. But I told him
  that I would do nothing foolish, and that I hoped I would not say a foolish
  thing, either. Then we went in together to Andrew Chase. Mimsy had ushered
  him into the library. He stood up to greet us as we entered.</p>

  <p>First he shook the hand of Father McGuire. Then he turned to me and said:
  "I won't offer you my hand at present, Porfilo. Not until we have had a
  chance to talk and you have had a chance to consider my apology. Then we will
  shake hands, I hope."</p>

  <p>Father McGuire fairly groaned with relief.</p>

  <p>He said: "I knew that you would do something like this. It was unlike you
  to take advantage of him, Andrew Chase. I am grateful to Heaven for it."</p>

  <p>"It was the most detestable thing I have done in my life," said Andrew. "I
  am grateful to you because you knew I could not let things stand as they were
  without another word. Of course I have to do something. I am just now turning
  over in my mind some sort of an apology which may please Leon Porfilo. Do you
  know exactly what I did to him?"</p>

  <p>This was really exceedingly adroit. He turned to Father McGuire and
  discussed his own sins as though it were a detached wickedness with which he
  really had no vital connection. Even at that age I was able to understand and
  admire his policy.</p>

  <p>"I think that I have heard all the details of the affair," said Father
  McGuire, "but not from Leon."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Andrew, flashing a quick glance at me. "A man of spirit
  doesn't talk about such things, of course. Well, sir, to put the whole thing
  in a word, Leon Porfilo, who is a gentleman, was used by me as though he were
  a rat. That's putting it mildly. In the first place, I called him a
  greaser.</p>

  <p>"In the second place, I stood to what I said. In the third place, when he
  very promptly and properly resented what I had said, I took advantage of my
  superior age and strength to knock him senseless. I tell you, sir, that when
  I review those things, I cannot see myself in the role. There must have been
  a devil in me!"</p>

  <p>He had grown red and then pale, and there was a look of disgust in his
  handsome face.</p>

  <p>"I've done such a thing," said he, "as a man cannot forget. It will be a
  detestable stain in my mind so long as I live. There is only one extenuating
  remark which I can make. I don't claim it as an excuse, but to help to show
  you how I could have acted as I did act: I was maddened at the sight of my
  brother battered and helpless in the hands of a younger and smaller man than
  himself after all the work which we had put upon him to make him capable of a
  better fight! I was in a frenzy, and the thing got the best of me. It was
  worse than drunkenness; it was a thing that makes me writhe now as I think of
  it!"</p>

  <p>"You are very severe with yourself," said Father McGuire gravely. "But I
  admit that I feel you are not too severe."</p>

  <p>"Not a whit!" declared Andrew Chase.</p>

  <p>Here he turned sharply round upon me. "Porfilo," said he, "I have several
  direct apologies to make to you.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, I reflected upon an ancestry which is just as cleanly
  Anglo-Saxon as my own.</p>

  <p>"In the second place, I badgered you while you were in the midst of the
  fight with another man who should have given you hard work enough without my
  help.</p>

  <p>"In the third place, like a brutal bully, I took advantage of my own size
  and my strength to strike you down."</p>

  <p>He concluded this list of facts, which made my face burn, by saying
  simply: "If a man had done such things to me, I think I could never forget
  it. I tell you that frankly. But that is because my family has always been
  cursed with a species of false pride which is one of the worst vices in the
  world.</p>

  <p>"I would nourish a sulky resentment until I had a chance to fight it out.
  But I think there may be finer stuff than that in you, Porfilo. If you accept
  my apology in the first place, don't dream that anyone will ever accuse you
  of cowardice. Not at all! The manner in which you have disposed of my brother
  on two successive occasions"</p>

  <p>Here he was forced to pause, for he was breathing hard, and his breath
  came in gasps. The color changed in his face, and for a moment he was livid.
  He mastered himself as quickly as he could, but I had had a sufficient
  glimpse of emotions which were almost beyond my conception. Proud I might be;
  but I could never rival such pride as this, which became a veritable physical
  thing!</p>

  <p>"In a word," went on Andrew Chase, "I am offering you my hand. If you take
  it, I shall feel that you have helped to clean away a very soiled place in my
  honor. Will you be generous enough to forgive me for the things I have done,
  Porfilo?"</p>

  <p>He said it in an indescribable manner, so filled with grace and with
  directness, so filled with humility and with pride that my heart melted at
  once. Truly, this fellow was full of magic! I had been raging with resentment
  an instant before. Now I found myself surging with the very kindest emotions
  concerning Andrew Chase.</p>

  <p>"Why," I said, "I can understand. You wanted Harry to win. Then you got
  mad&mdash;and you did a lot of things that anybody might be apt to do. I
  won't keep any resentment. If you knocked me down, you did it fairly enough.
  Some day I might want to take another shot at you, though."</p>

  <p>"When you do," said he, very grave, "come to me day or night and we'll go
  off by ourselves or back to the same town plaza, and you can have your
  satisfaction. A large satisfaction it's apt to be, if you grow into your
  promise for manhood, Leon!"</p>

  <p>Was not this enough? Yes, sufficient to make me seize his hand and to
  wring it with all my might.</p>

  <p>"I've forgotten everything! I&mdash;I thank you for being so square and
  coming to me like this. Tomorrow I'm going to let people know that I have no
  grudge against you!"</p>

  <p>"Will you do that?" he asked a little eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>"Then we can talk about the next thing that's in my mind, and in my
  father's mind, also. It's really more difficult than the first proposition. I
  may need your help in it, Father McGuire!"</p>

  <p>"You've done one good thing to-night," said Father McGuire. His heart was
  in his voice. "It'll be odd if I don't help you to do another."</p>

  <p>"This has to do with poor Harry. I told you before that the Chase family
  is cursed with a devilish pride, and Harry, poor fellow, has as big a share
  as any of us. Well, Father McGuire, he has tried twice to match his fists
  against Leon's and twice he has been beaten fairly and squarely by a
  youngster smaller and younger than himself. Both times a whole town has been
  able to look on at the affair! That's rather irksome, you'll admit."</p>

  <p>"I admit it," said Father McGuire, as grave as ever.</p>

  <p>"Harry knows, now, that he hasn't the hand craft to stand up to Leon
  Porfilo. Very few men of any age could. But most men would accept that fact,
  no matter how they had to grit their teeth about it. My great fear is that
  Harry is apt to go a step farther. I am afraid, in a word, that he may take
  to some other weapon than his hands!"</p>

  <p>Neither Father McGuire nor I spoke a word in answer to this.</p>

  <p>Andrew Chase went on: "We can't control Harry. He's half insane with shame
  and rage. If we send him away, he'll slip back and come at you. Then Heaven
  knows what the consequences may be. He's a handy fellow with a gun; far
  handier than he is with his fists! But I don't think fear of him would ever
  budge you, Leon.</p>

  <p>"What we want to do&mdash;my father and I&mdash;is to ask you to slip out
  to a different section of the country. For instance, if you had in mind
  something such as starting in partnership with some older man&mdash;say the
  cattle business, or a long apprenticeship, or some such matter&mdash;why, if
  five or six thousand in spot cash would influence you&mdash;it would be a
  delight to supply you!"</p>

  <p>Father McGuire looked at me, and I at him. I was bewildered. Then the
  priest put his hand on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I have had only one son in my house, Mr. Chase," said he.</p>

  <p>"I believe I understand," said Andrew gently, "and therefore I know that
  you will not stand between him and a bright future. Besides, you would be
  helping my family out of a frightful danger."</p>

  <p>"I think that is true," said Father McGuire. He made a little pause before
  he turned to me. Their eyes bore heavily upon me.</p>

  <p>"My dear Leon," said that good man, "it goes much against my heart, but I
  feel that for your own sake and also for the sake of that headstrong young
  man, Harry Chase, you should accept what Mr. Chase has suggested. Take time,
  then, before you give me an answer!"</p>

  <p>I did take time. I turned that matter back and forth as deliberately as I
  could, but, strive as I would, I could not reconcile myself to the idea. It
  was one thing to accept the apology of Andrew Chase and continue to live on
  as I had been living before in the house of good Father McGuire. It was still
  another matter to advance against the public voice by leaving Mendez and
  skulking away so secretly that Harry Chase might never find me.</p>

  <p>No matter how many times a man proves himself a hero, if he has ever shown
  the white feather, even for a fraction of a second, it is neither forgotten
  nor forgiven. So it would be with my name and my fame.</p>

  <p>I looked up from all of these reflections straight into the eye of Andrew
  Chase.</p>

  <p>"I respect you too much," I told him, "to think that you'd advise me to do
  this, if you'd looked at it from my angle. I can't back out. I've got to stay
  here and see this through."</p>

  <p>Andrew Chase turned with a gesture of despair to Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>But I stopped all argument and killed it at the root by simply saying:
  "Twenty years from now, suppose somebody from Mendez met me and said to
  himself: 'There goes the fellow that was scared out of Mendez by young Harry
  Chase!' Well, that would be enough to make me wish that I'd died."</p>

  <p>Of course, being sensible men, they knew that they could not argue against
  pride and prejudice like this. They simply glanced at one another, Andrew
  with his question and Father McGuire with a shake of the head. Then Andrew
  changed his tone at once. He told me he was sorry that he could not move me
  to do what he and his father wanted me to, but at the same time that did not
  alter his respect and liking for me.</p>

  <p>He shook my hand again, asked me again to forgive him, and was assured by
  my simple self that I was glad to have met him, even at a price such as I had
  paid.</p>

  <p>When Andrew had left, Father McGuire said: "Did you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"I meant it!" said I. "Of course, some day I'm going to try to thrash him,
  because of the way he knocked me down. But"</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose that he knows that?" said Father McGuire. "Haven't you
  told him that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" I admitted.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that he'll stand by and let you have that chance?"</p>

  <p>"A man like Andrew Chase will," said I.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Father McGuire. "But, between you and me, I think
  this young man talks just a little too smoothly. He's only twenty-two, and
  though that may seem a very mature age to you, it makes me wonder! He
  controls himself too well. There is a great deal of the diplomat about young
  Mr. Chase, or else I am very mistaken."</p>

  <p>I gave no credit to Father McGuire's insinuations of double dealing on the
  part of Andrew. I was only seventeen!</p>

  <p>A new phase of my life began to develop now. By the warning of Andrew
  Chase himself, we knew that Harry was more or less of an expert with a
  revolver, and since he was such an expert, I expected him daily to ride down
  upon me and attempt to gain his satisfaction at my expense by putting a
  bullet through my head.</p>

  <p>For my part, I suppose that I had handled weapons more than most
  youngsters. I had done more than my share of hunting, and I was a good hand
  with a rifle. With a revolver I had done my share, too, of blazing away at
  snakes or rabbits that crossed my path, and wasted my ten or twenty bullets
  for every target I struck.</p>

  <p>But now I began to work feverishly in preparation for the struggle which
  must lie ahead&mdash;according to the warning from Andrew himself. I bought a
  brand-new Colt and a large stock of ammunition. Every day, I took a new
  horse, which I had bought&mdash;a strong-limbed mustang well able to support
  my weight&mdash; and galloped off to a secluded spot between two hills on the
  desert. There I hammered away at some difficult target in all manner of
  difficult positions on horseback and on foot.</p>

  <p>Every morning I went out for at least an hour; every afternoon I was away
  again. Sometimes I went out in the gray of the evening. For who could tell
  under what light conditions I might have to meet Harry Chase?</p>

  <p>Three months, four months, and there was no sign of Harry Chase. He had
  gone from the vicinity of Mendez. His family had sent him, it appeared at
  last, not to an Eastern school, but far across the water to England. Not for
  English culture, but for English safety.</p>

  <p>I felt that I was rescued from the most vital pressure of danger, but
  still, all through the winter and into the dawn of my eighteenth year the
  next spring, I was working hard and faithfully with my revolver, and with the
  gloves of Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>My lessons did not greatly suffer. When a young man is keyed up for one
  piece of work, he is apt to be able to do all of his work much more
  effectively. So it was with me. All the progress I had made in my first two
  years of study was not half of what I advanced through in my third year under
  Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>You will wonder what his attitude may have been toward my constant
  practice with guns. It was rather amusing, but very characteristic.</p>

  <p>"You used to fight all the time, before you learned how to box, Lee. Since
  you learned to box, you've fought only three times&mdash;twice with Harry
  Chase and once with Andrew."</p>

  <p>I turned a dark red, at this. The mention of my "fight" with Andrew always
  touched a tender spot in my nature.</p>

  <p>"When a man knows what a blow is and how it should be struck," went on
  Father McGuire, "he is not so apt to be a quarrelsome chap. You must not
  think that most of the battles on the frontier were the work of real gunmen,
  either. There are a few men who fight because they do love bloodshed. There
  are a few unfortunate souls who have that blood lust. But they are very
  few.</p>

  <p>"Most of the men who understand what they can accomplish with a gun in the
  hand, usually prefer to keep that gun in a holster&mdash;until their backs
  are against the wall. Do you understand me? But the great using up of
  ammunition, the smashing of windows and mirrors, the ripping up of floors and
  ceilings&mdash; and the occasional slaughter of one another&mdash;all of that
  was the work of the tenderfoot, my boy.</p>

  <p>"You wonder why the Westerner doesn't like the tenderfoot? Because he is
  the chap who makes the trouble! He doesn't know one end of a gun from
  another. But because he has bought a Colt, he thinks that he will have to use
  it.</p>

  <p>"As for you, Leon, I think that you will not be a fool. I think that this
  practice will give you better common sense than you ever had before. It will
  make you respect the possibilities of weapons&mdash;in the other fellow's
  hand as well as in your own!"</p>

  <p>This was the philosophy of Father McGuire. I think that the event would
  have justified the thought of that good man. But I ask you to remember that I
  was only eighteen; and I think I can show you that the temptation was very
  great indeed!</p>

  <p>At any rate, I take you with me to a certain evening when we sat sleepily
  over our books in the library of Father McGuire, and I heard a tap at the
  front door.</p>

  <p>I got up to answer it. I remember stumbling over the little rug in front
  of the library door, and how Father McGuire said testily:</p>

  <p>"Your feet, Leon! Your feet! Will you watch your way, my boy?"</p>

  <p>I closed the door behind me, went down the hall, and opened the front
  door. It let in a rush of warm spring wind, and there was Harry Chase
  standing before me!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. - STIGMA</h2>

  <p class="first">"Porfilo," said he, "I'm very late, but I'm here at
  last."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean," said I, nevertheless, understanding very
  well.</p>

  <p>"Think it over a moment," said Harry Chase. "You have disgraced me and
  beaten me twice. I've come back to fight you in another way."</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible. In spite of all that Andrew Chase had told me, still
  I could not believe the thing!</p>

  <p>I said: "Chase, I never struck you unfairly except that in the first fight
  I took advantage of what I had learned about boxing. But that's not really so
  very unfair. I apologized for that; I would apologize for it again, if that
  would make you feel any better!"</p>

  <p>He merely sneered at me. "Do you wear a gun?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens," I cried, "do you mean it?"</p>

  <p>"Not so loud," said he, glancing sharply over his shoulder. "Not so loud,
  Porfilo. The priest might hear. I don't want his noise and his chatter. Have
  you a gun, I asked you?"</p>

  <p>"Are you drunk?" I groaned.</p>

  <p>"Drunk?" said he, with that same sneering smile which he and his brother
  understood so well how to use. "I've slipped away from my school on a good
  excuse and come five thousand miles to see you. I'm supposed to be in
  Scotland shooting. Instead, I'm here in Arizona&mdash;but I intend to have my
  shooting, all the same. If you're not armed, I have a gun for you. Come
  outside!"</p>

  <p>"I'll have nothing to do with you!" said I, in a real panic, and I started
  to close the door.</p>

  <p>He put his foot against it and caught my arm at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me," said he. "If you won't fight, I'll make the entire
  range laugh at you for a coward. I'll publish it everywhere. I'll make the
  children point their fingers at you! Do you believe me?"</p>

  <p>I stepped through the door and stood with him in the night. I was half
  minded to try the weight of my fists on him now. It would have been an
  excellent thing if I had. But he had stirred up my pride, and pride in a
  young man is a tiger.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "I'm glad to see that you are reasonable. Have you a
  gun?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Here is a new Colt. It's loaded in all six chambers. Does it satisfy
  you?"</p>

  <p>I broke it open. I even extracted a shell to see that they were honest
  stuff. Then I looked up to Chase.</p>

  <p>He was smiling his contempt at my open suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I. "I'm ready."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said he.</p>

  <p>"How do you want to go about it?"</p>

  <p>"I've thought of a way. Come back with me so that we can't be seen from
  the street."</p>

  <p>He led the way to the rear of the house. He took his place at one side of
  the vegetable patch and I at the other side. I think there were about twenty
  paces between us, though the distance seemed greater, because we had only
  starlight.</p>

  <p>He said: "It is nearly nine o'clock, and when the first bell strikes, we
  fire."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I, and freshened my grip on the gun butt.</p>

  <p>I can hardly believe this, as I write it down. It seems entirely too blunt
  and matter of fact to have been the truth. But I am putting down exactly what
  Harry said and what I answered. If you wish to know what I felt, as I faced
  him in the dimness, I can only say that I had pushed fear behind me and kept
  a tight grip on my courage.</p>

  <p>I felt, every instant, that terror was about to leap on me and make a
  trembling woman of me; but still I kept around the corner from such a
  disaster.</p>

  <p>He went on, after a moment: "I am going to kill you, Porfilo, I think. If
  you have any messages to leave behind you, tell me what they are."</p>

  <p>I said: "If I die, there is only one message: Tell Father McGuire that it
  was a fair fight. Tell him that I'm sorry he didn't guess better. He'll
  understand what I mean."</p>

  <p>"That's fair enough," said Harry Chase.</p>

  <p>"I'll offer you the same thing," said I.</p>

  <p>He laughed softly. "There's no danger that I'll need a messenger. I'll do
  my own talking after this affair, Porfilo. When my character has been cleaned
  up by putting you away, I'll do my own talking. I think it's nearly nine
  o'clock, Porfilo. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"I'm ready," said I.</p>

  <p>At that instant I heard the old town clock beginning to buzz; a moment
  later the first note of the bell struck sharply against our ears, and Harry
  twitched up his gun and fired from the hip. The bullet was well intended. It
  shaved past my head and clipped away a bit of my red hair at the temple.</p>

  <p>My own shot was delayed until I had stretched out my arm, for I knew
  nothing of these snap shots from the hip. His second shot and my first one
  rang out at the same instant. His whisked under the pit of my arm, barely
  grazing my coat on the left side of my body. Mine dropped him in his
  tracks.</p>

  <p>I ran to him while the scream of old Mimsy came shrilling out from her
  open window. The poor woman had been sitting there in the dark of her room
  looking out on the night, and she had seen the whole thing, but what our
  standing opposite one another meant, she had not been able to guess. I
  suppose her dim eyes did not see the guns in our hands.</p>

  <p>I found Harry Chase swearing fluently.</p>

  <p>"I've spoiled everything," said he. "That infernal bullet of yours went
  right through my left thigh. There's nothing to it except a long stay in bed;
  and a lot of talk at home and in the town. You've won again, Porfilo. But how
  in Heaven's name I could have missed you&mdash;when I've smashed a target an
  inch square at the same distance&mdash;I can't tell! It looks like fate!"</p>

  <p>Harry Chase had told the exact truth about his wound. When Father McGuire
  came running out to us and we had carried Harry into the house, we found by
  cutting away the trousers that the bullet had pierced the thigh and clipped
  cleanly through it, leaving a small puncture in front and not an over-large
  one in the rear of the leg. It was bleeding freely.</p>

  <p>Harry Chase caught my arm and said to me in a tensed expression: "Did you
  shoot low on purpose, Leon?"</p>

  <p>"I shot to kill!" I admitted, "because I knew you were shooting to kill
  me!"</p>

  <p>"I was," said he. "You can be the witness, Father McGuire, that I started
  all this trouble! Leon is not to blame!"</p>

  <p>Father McGuire said nothing. He had sent Mimsy away for the doctor. In the
  meantime, he stopped the flow of blood.</p>

  <p>Andrew Chase came in response to our message to him. He came in a matter-
  of-fact way, shook hands with Father McGuire and with me, and made a remark
  on the weather. Then something to the effect that Harry would learn, sooner
  or later, that Porfilo was not meant by Providence to be his meat! It was a
  very cool speech, and Father McGuire was thoroughly angered. But he said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"After all," said Andrew calmly to me, "I see that you were wise in not
  clearing out of the town on account of Harry. It seems that he isn't able to
  accomplish a great deal&mdash;even with a gun!"</p>

  <p>I saw that beneath the surface, Andrew was fairly writhing with shame and
  with contempt for Harry; I saw, too, that he was hating me with all his
  heart. It was not so much that he wished Harry to win as that he wished him
  not to lose. A stigma was thrown upon the entire Chase family, it seemed. Or
  at least, that was his way of looking at it.</p>

  <p>They took Harry away in a stretcher and put him in a buckboard because he
  insisted on being moved. He said cheerfully to Father McGuire:</p>

  <p>"I know you'd take care of me, but your food would choke me, after I've
  tried to punch a bullet through Leon Porfilo like this!"</p>

  <p>In this very casual manner, the whole thing ended, for the moment. There
  were other moments to come. But what astonishes me as I look back on that
  evening, is the almost humdrum manner in which everything passed off. Even
  Father McGuire had nothing to say in the way of reproof or advice for the
  future.</p>

  <p>He merely said in his gentle way: "This is the third time with Harry
  Chase. I think he may have his lesson, now!"</p>

  <p>I thought so, too. By this time I was pretty thoroughly convinced that
  Harry Chase could never put me down, by hand, knife, or gun.</p>

  <p>Most naturally, from that moment, I kept my eye upon the house of Chase,
  because I expected, and Father McGuire expected, that the next move must come
  from them. They had played all the leading cards so far, and though I had
  managed to take all the tricks, it was reasonable to suppose that the next
  disturbance would have a member of the Chase family in it.</p>

  <p>I was wrong. The next trouble arose, apparently, from the entrance into
  Mendez of the most distinguished liar and rascal who ever rode a horse or
  wore a gun.</p>

  <p>I refer to none other than "Turk" Niginski.</p>

  <p>No one had so much as heard of Turk Niginski until the day of his arrival.
  He looked like a Turk, I must confess. He had a pair of bristling
  mustaches&mdash;not many hairs, but long stiff ones that curved down around
  the corners of his mouth like so many dark scimitars. He had rather slant
  eyes, very black, with yellow-stained whites. He had a sallow, greasy, shiny
  skin. His appearance was finished and set off, at once, by a line of
  ragged-edged, yellow teeth which showed when he grinned. He was always
  grinning.</p>

  <p>This undecorative devil appeared in Mendez and in my life on the same day.
  I was working in the vegetable garden, preparing a bed for new soil, but
  excavating it a foot and a half deep, to make room for fresh dirt and
  dressing.</p>

  <p>A voice sang out: "That's him!"</p>

  <p>I looked up into the face of the sheriff, who sat his horse beside the
  fence. With him was Turk Niginski.</p>

  <p>I said: "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff replied: "Something a good deal worse than anything I've ever
  had against you before, Lee!"</p>

  <p>That alarmed me. Because I knew that I was not liked by the sheriff. He
  had an inborn, natural suspicion of fighting men, and I had fought and fought
  and fought through my entire life, as far back as he could remember me. Only
  with my fists, to be sure, until very lately. But the sheriff had always
  expected me to really run amuck some day, and the affair with Harry Chase had
  simply convinced him that his forebodings about me were bound to be
  accomplished.</p>

  <p>He who fights must eventually do a murder! Such was the reasoning of the
  sheriff. But he was such a wonderfully fair man, such an able and careful
  sifter of evidence, that I never had a doubt of good treatment at his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I've heard," said the sheriff, looking me grimly in
  the eye. "I've heard that Niginski tried to bum a dollar from you an hour
  ago. I hear that you kicked him off the place, and when he tried to fight
  back, you shoved a gun in his face and told him to get off the place."</p>

  <p>I was so amazed that I suppose I turned color. Let no one believe the old
  gag that innocence has a voice of its own. The mere suspicion of guilt, the
  mere accusation, is enough to throw most men off their feed, as the saying
  goes. I was thoroughly thrown off by what the sheriff had to say, you may be
  sure! Consider that I had never so much as seen this Turk before that
  moment.</p>

  <p>The sheriff went on: "He says that you went on and told him that you
  didn't like the look of him. That the best thing for him to do was to keep
  right on moving until he was clear out of the town. Because if you seen him
  again, you was apt to salt him away with a morsel or two of lead. Well, kid,
  what about it?"</p>

  <p>"Sheriff," said I, "I dunno what to say!"</p>

  <p>There was innocence for you; but it made such an impression on the
  sheriff, this innocence of mine, that he scowled blackly upon me.</p>

  <p>"Now look me in the eye, kid, and get me right," said he. "I ain't takin'
  nothin' for granted. It may be that Niginski faked all of this, and that
  there ain't a word of truth in what he says, though it would be a
  considerable bit of brain work for a bird with a mug like his."</p>

  <p>Truly the face of Niginski seemed one to which a real thought could never
  come.</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what's happened!" I declared with much heat.</p>

  <p>"All right," drawled the sheriff. "It may be that you ain't puffed up
  because you knocked over the Chase kid a few weeks back. It may be that you
  ain't always been a trouble hunter ever since you was a little kid. It may be
  that you're all right, and Turk Niginski is all wrong. But I'll tell you
  pronto, and I'll tell you plain that it looks bad to me. In case you get any
  wrong ideas to start with, I want you to know that I'm runnin' this here
  town. When it comes to orderin' gents to move along, I'm gonna do all the
  talkin' that's talked!"</p>

  <p>I broke in: "Sheriff, you're not fair!"</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and shut me off. "All right, all right!" said he.
  "You're a saint, maybe. You never done nothin' wrong in all your life. But I
  tell you that I ain't gonna have this poor saphead scared of his life while
  he's in Mendez, and if anything happens to him while he's here, I'm gonna
  come right to you and ask you how come! That's all I got to say!"</p>

  <p>He rode away at the side of Turk Niginski, who was grinning in perfect
  content. I went on blindly with my work, wishing the mysterious liar,
  Niginski, in the lowest part of the nether regions, to say nothing of the
  unhappy future which I desired for the sheriff.</p>

  <p>But, after a time, I could think of nothing except what might be behind
  the lie of Niginski. I had never seen this man before. I could never have
  wronged him. What could be his ultimate intention? My brain came into such a
  tangle with the idea, that at last I decided to saddle my horse and take a
  ride in the hope that the wind of a good gallop would blow away the
  cobwebs.</p>

  <p>So I saddled and mounted and whirled out of Mendez on the road north in
  the direction of the great, cool, cloudy blue mountains which tumbled above
  the horizon there. My great wish at that moment was that I could break away
  from Mendez and all of the people in it, and keep straight on with a tireless
  horse until I was in the upper slopes of those piled summits.</p>

  <p>In the midst of these reflections, I looked over my shoulder at the sound
  of hoofs and saw none other than Turk Niginski rushing up behind me with the
  ragged mane of his horse wagging high in the wind of his gallop.</p>

  <p>I knew there was trouble coming now, in very fact. Turk Niginski had out a
  gun as he spurred along, and now he raised it and knocked my hat from my head
  with his first shot&mdash;a very capable performance for a man riding at high
  speed. He was much closer when I put in my bullet in answer. It passed
  directly through his head, and Niginski lunging from the saddle a limp hulk,
  struck the knees of my horse and then, rebounding, rolled limp in the dust of
  the road.</p>

  <p>I did not waste time. I knew that the man was dead, and I spurred back to
  town as hard as I could ride. I went straight to the sheriff, and he seemed
  to read my story in my excited face.</p>

  <p>"Has bad luck come the way of Niginski?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was riding down the road, harming no one, God be my witness&mdash;when
  I heard the sound of a horse"</p>

  <p>The sheriff finished for me, in a dry voice: "It was Niginski, riding you
  down with a drawn gun, I suppose. And you had to turn and drop him?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said I, rather weakly.</p>

  <p>"A fine story," said the sheriff, more crisp than ever.</p>

  <p>"I can show you my proof. Here is my hat," said I, having scooped it up as
  I started back for town.</p>

  <p>I showed him the bullet hole through it, from front to back.</p>

  <p>"Let me see your gun," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>I showed it to him. "Two empty chambers," said he. "Did you have to shoot
  at him twice?"</p>

  <p>I was covered with a very convincing pallor, I have no doubt, for I can
  remember the cold feel of my face. I could remember now, that after my target
  practice of the day before, having cleaned my gun thoroughly and reloaded, I
  had tried a flying shot at a darting jack rabbit that crossed my
  trail&mdash;and missed, of course. Nothing but luck can hit a jack rabbit
  when it is making its first burst of speed.</p>

  <p>"I fired that shot yesterday," said I.</p>

  <p>"At what?" snapped out the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"A rabbit," said I, more faintly than ever.</p>

  <p>The sheriff spat in his disgust. "You come with me," said he, and led me
  straight to a cell.</p>

  <p>There I stayed unheeded for three hours. My first visitor was Father
  McGuire, who came with a weary face. His voice trembled as he said: "What
  could have made you do it, Leon? How could that poor man have wronged you in
  any way?"</p>

  <p>That showed me more clearly than anything else could have done how black
  my situation was. I did not try to explain to Father McGuire. I knew that I
  would only be able to stumble and halt through my story. So I kept my
  silence. Thereby I damned myself in the eyes of my only friend.</p>

  <p>Everything turned out worse than I could have suspected. Niginski had been
  found by the road; but his gun, with the emptied chamber, had not been
  found.</p>

  <p>The gun was gone, and thereby the case against me was automatically made
  perfect. As for my motive in the crime, the townsmen were willing to consider
  that killing as the natural outcome of a life of violence. It was a natural
  following-up of the shooting of Harry Chase, no matter how much Harry might
  have been to blame. The general opinion of everyone was that I should be put
  away for a good long term.</p>

     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; JAILED</h2>

  <p class="first">Things would have gone better for me in many Western
  communities, I very well knew. But the reign of law and order which our good
  sheriff had established in Mendez was such an iron-clad thing that shooting
  affairs were a novelty. People had been horrified by my affair with Harry
  Chase; and though Harry was more blamed, still I was blamed, also.</p>

  <p>I would not have accepted his invitation to a gun fight, it was felt,
  unless I had been a lover of gun play. Also, as I have said before, my past
  record and all my fist work were against me.</p>

  <p>Father McGuire believed my tale even less than others might have believed
  it. He came to see me twice every day. On the second occasion he begged me
  for a long time to confess and meet my sentence like a man. But I would not
  make an answer except to say, doggedly, that I was not guilty of any crime.
  At this, he pressed his lips together and returned no reply. It was plain
  that his mind was entirely made up!</p>

  <p>I shall not linger on the details of the trial. It was swift and to the
  point. I stood up before a crowd of hostile eyes and told my simple
  narrative. It was too absurd to be given credence for an instant. I was
  considered not even a good liar. That a man I had never seen should have gone
  to the sheriff with an appeal for protection against me, and that he
  afterward should have attempted to murder me on the open highway, was too
  absurd.</p>

  <p>As for the decision of the jury, they did not have to remain out for five
  minutes. Five minutes more saw me standing before the judge, condemned to
  twenty-five years of imprisonment in the State penitentiary.</p>

  <p>I, a boy of eighteen&mdash;and twenty-five years!</p>

  <p>I would be forty-three when I came out! At my age, forty-three seemed
  almost the end of life.</p>

  <p>I shall not ask you to sit in my cell with me in the first wild hours of
  my anguish. I shall leap ahead to the evening of that day when the sheriff
  brought in to see me a gray-haired, lean-faced man with an eye wonderfully
  blue and bright.</p>

  <p>I remembered him instantly. It was he who had chosen to back me against
  Harry Chase on the day of our second fight.</p>

  <p>He said, cheerfully: "Youngster, you seem to have dropped into a bit of
  hard luck!"</p>

  <p>I could not help breaking out: "I'm done for now. I've got life in prison,
  or practically that. I'm not saying it because I hope anyone will believe me,
  but now I want to say for the last time I'll ever say it, and to a stranger
  like you: That I swear to Heaven Niginski carried a gun and fired the first
  bullet, and that everything I've said about him has been the truth and the
  whole truth!"</p>

  <p>"Why, the devil, lad," said the blue-eyed man, "I know that perfectly
  well!"</p>

  <p>"What?" cried the sheriff, who had been just a little impressed by the
  solemnity of what I had said.</p>

  <p>"I won't say what my reasons are," said the blue-eyed stranger. "You
  wouldn't believe them, sheriff, any more than you would believe this unlucky
  youngster. But I know that he told the truth."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see how you know!" exclaimed the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you one reason," said the other, with a snap of his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Let me have it, then."</p>

  <p>"Is this kid supposed, around your town, to be a fool?"</p>

  <p>"No. He's had a name for a good deal of sense&mdash;since he went to live
  with Father McGuire."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Would anyone but a fool have told the sort of a story he gave
  the judge and jury&mdash;unless it had been the truth? As a lie, can you
  imagine anything worse and weaker than the yarn he composed?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff was a bit struck, and bit his lip in thought.</p>

  <p>"All kids are complicated liars," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Darned if it don't sound pretty reasonable," said the sheriff. "But there
  was too much evidence!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know a good deal about evidence!" said the other airily.
  "Youngster," he added to me, "I've not stopped trying to do something for
  you. But I didn't know what shape you were in until the other day. I was busy
  at some work which I suppose your friend, the sheriff, would not have
  liked."</p>

  <p>Here he gave a calm, smiling side glance to the sheriff. But the sheriff
  said nothing at all.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know," said I, "what reason you had for wanting to help
  me."</p>

  <p>Don't put it in the past tense," said he. "I saw you knock big Harry Chase
  kicking. I saw you stand up to that multiplied fiend incarnate&mdash;Andrew
  Chase. I'll never forget it. The rest of the dubs and blockheads in this town
  wouldn't forget it, if they had the wits of a child!"</p>

  <p>I expected the sheriff to explode with rage; but there was something about
  the cool manner of this man which discouraged explosions very decidedly.</p>

  <p>He went on: "My name is 'Tex' Cummins. Will you remember that?"</p>

  <p>"I shall," said I.</p>

  <p>"Before I go"</p>

  <p>"Before you go," said I, "tell me what could have been in the brain of
  that Niginski to attack me the way he did! Was he crazy?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. He had taken good money for that job. The game was to
  incriminate you, of course, if Niginski was killed. But the real hope was
  that Niginski would dispose of you, instead of vice versa."</p>

  <p>"Niginski did not even carry a gun!" cried the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Tex Cummins. "Look up his record and see if he was the kind to
  go without a gun even to a dance!"</p>

  <p>"But no one would have done a rotten thing like that!" cried I, more
  bewildered than ever, as he offered this solution. "Who in the world would
  hire a man to kill me? Who have I done a real wrong to?"</p>

  <p>He merely smiled at me. "Youngsters are always like that," said he. "They
  either think that everybody in the world is a crook&mdash;outside of
  themselves&mdash;or else they think that the world has no villains in it.
  Look here, Leon Porfilo, can you tell me that you have no real enemies around
  this town?"</p>

  <p>"Only" I stopped short and blushed. It seemed madness to attempt to
  connect the proud and wealthy family of Chase with such a brutal affair.</p>

  <p>"Only what?" said Cummins. "I'm not the sheriff. I'm not the judge and the
  jury. But I'm the man who knows all about this. Let me hear you guess!"</p>

  <p>"Harry Chase!" exclaimed I.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" shouted the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said Cummins coldly, and he looked our sheriff deliberately up
  and down. "I think that the time may come when Mendez will sweat, because,
  like a crowd of blind fools, you people have turned this honest youngster,
  here, into a criminal. But he's right.</p>

  <p>"Harry Chase is well again and practicing with his guns. His whole family
  knew that. Do you think that they wanted him to go out and stand up to you
  once more? Do you think that Harry himself wanted to do that, if there was
  any way of avoiding it and keeping his honor intact?"</p>

  <p>It was the true explosion of a bomb. The sheriff simply gripped at the
  bars and gaped at Tex Cummins. I could not say a word.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Tex Cummins, "I'd like to shake hands with your prisoner,
  sheriff!"</p>

  <p>He did not wait for a permission which the astonished sheriff did not have
  the voice to give, but he reached his hands through the bars to me and I, as
  I closed my fingers heartily over his, blinked violently. I had felt a sharp
  edge cutting into the palm of my hand. I had received, also, a small
  vial.</p>

  <p>The rankest sort of an amateur detective could have told that I had
  received something from the hand of the stranger; but our good sheriff was at
  that moment the most green of all keepers of the law. He was still tasting
  the strange news which Tex Cummins had brought. I think that in the sheriff's
  mind, from that moment, there was an innate conviction that this blue-eyed,
  insolent man was right.</p>

  <p>At least, the sheriff lingered after Cummins had left, and he said to
  me:</p>

  <p>"I dunno, kid. All I wish is for the right man to get it in the neck. Dog-
  gone me if it's possible that the Chase bunch could be mixed up in dirty work
  like this."</p>

  <p>"I've never accused them," I pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Are you a fool, an innocent, or are you a smart crook?" roared the
  sheriff suddenly.</p>

  <p>I said nothing, of course, and he strode away filled with emotion, leaving
  me alone in that nest of cells. For there was no other prisoner in the
  place.</p>

  <p>I did not wait for night and darkness. In a trice I was examining that
  gift of Tex Cummins, and I found that I had in my hand the neatest of all
  small steel saws&mdash;a saw with an edge as brilliant, as keen, and as hard
  as though set with diamonds. The vial was full of the best oil.</p>

  <p>I tried that saw dubiously&mdash;it was so tiny&mdash;on one of the stout
  bars of my cage. Behold! The keen edge sank into the strong steel of the bars
  with an exquisite ease!</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, that was not tool-proof steel&mdash;that cell of
  mine&mdash;or I should not have had such an easy time of it. But as it was, I
  was able to make the saw glide deep into the heart of the bar in a few
  moments. When it grew hot in my fingers and deep in the steel rut it had
  made, I used the oil, and once more it glided into the metal.</p>

  <p>I had to make two cuttings, after which there would be room enough for me
  to press my body sidewise through the gap made by removing the one bar. I
  started the two cuttings, therefore, and cut each bar almost through. Then I
  sat down to wait.</p>

  <p>When supper was brought in to me&mdash;rice and syrup and tea with a big
  lump of stale bread&mdash;I chatted good-naturedly to the jailer to keep his
  attention from the bars. And I fell to work on my food.</p>

  <p>I finished and gave him back the tray. In another ten minutes the jail was
  closed, the great locks turned, and the lights were off. That jailer had
  other business on hand for the evening, and he was anxious to be away.</p>

  <p>I did not wait for the town to grow quiet with the night. I should have
  stifled, I am sure, if I had had to keep inactive another moment. Instead, I
  fell to work on my cutting, and in a few moments the bar was sawed through
  and placed with a joyous care upon the floor.</p>

  <p>That was a scant third of my labor done. I had to run down the hall to the
  big window which filled one end of it. I had to cut through two of the bars
  which covered its face. I worked with a furious energy, thrilled with
  terrible pangs of fear when the saw squeaked; with blisters growing on the
  tips of my fingers and with my wrists aching from the incessant play back and
  forth.</p>

  <p>But those two bars were divided, each in two places, and lifted gently to
  the floor. My way was clear.</p>

  <p>I cast one savage glance over my shoulder as I heard, I thought, a sound
  at the front of the jail.</p>

  <p>Then I was instantly through the aperture which I had made through the
  window. I slipped to the ground outside, and it seemed to me that the taste
  of the free air which I breathed was the most dainty food, the most exquisite
  perfume which I had ever enjoyed. Then, around the corner of the jail, walked
  a man with a light, long stride. He came straight on, toward me. I was half
  of a mind to throw myself on him, but there was something about his jovial
  air and the manner in which he whistled lightly as he walked that made me
  hope that he might pass me without observing me.</p>

  <p>He did pass!</p>

  <p>But after he had made a single stride more, he paused sharply, and I heard
  him say: "There is a bay gelding on the far side of the plaza, tied in the
  shadow of the trees. No one will say you are a horse thief if you take
  him."</p>

  <p>And he was gone! It was Tex Cummins again!</p>

  <p>I gaped after him until he turned the farther corner of the jail. But here
  was no time to wonder at him. I was turning my back upon my old life. I was
  preparing to start north for the cloudy blue of the mountains and the safety
  they might give me. I was preparing to leave Mendez forever, I hoped, and I
  would leave behind me only one stinging regret&mdash;that the faith in my
  guilt was so strong in the heart of Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>Yet, as the first chapter of my life ended, as I stood there an outlaw and
  an escaped convict, with the dread of the law to hang over me forever, I had
  much to be thankful for. No one could ever take from me those pleasant
  memories of the blessed years that I had spent with Father McGuire.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. "MIKE" O'ROURKE</h2>

  <p class="first">When I went across the plaza from the jail I was glad of two
  things in this world, and no more: Tex Cummins and the night&mdash;Tex
  because he had made my escape possible, and the night because it shut me away
  from the view of the townsmen. I found at once the horse which he had named,
  but it seemed to me that the undoing of the knot required an age. Two men,
  half seen through the darkness, paused on the sidewalk and muttered to one
  another. I was sure that it was about me, and I was in a fever to be off. Yet
  I had the good sense to get into the saddle in a leisurely manner and start
  off into the saddle in a mild-mannered gallop.</p>

  <p>I had to keep a stiff pull on the reins for that purpose, because the
  horse which my mysterious friend Cummins had provided was fairly rearing to
  go. But at least the two fellows on the sidewalk made no attempt to follow
  me. I considered that my first triumph.</p>

  <p>But, no matter how eager I was to be out of the town&mdash;for at any
  moment my escape might be noticed&mdash;I drew the rein for an instant in
  front of the house of good Father McGuire. When I thought of my three happy
  years with him, I was on the verge of calling him out to me.</p>

  <p>I recollected that it would not have been fair to him; it might have put
  him in the light of one who failed in his duty to the law by having
  cognizance of the escape of a prisoner, and yet it made my heart ache to
  leave the town without saying farewell to him. All that he had done for me
  ran like wildfire through my mind. I think, indeed, that the entire fifteen
  years of my life before I came to him could not have weighed against a single
  six months of my stay with the priest. I loved him more than I had loved my
  father; and he loved me as a son.</p>

  <p>I loosed the rein and let the gelding have more of its head. So we darted
  out of Mendez and onto the northern road. I had not the slightest doubt of
  what my destination should be. All my life I had looked toward the piled blue
  mountains on the northern horizon as toward a promised land. Now I knew that
  they should be my land indeed.</p>

  <p>So I choked the gait of the gelding to a long, rolling canter which ate up
  the miles with an effortless ease. Three times I stopped my good nag and
  loosened the cinches and walked a mile or so beside him to let him take his
  breath and cool off, for the night was hot. Then we struck briskly on
  again.</p>

  <p>When the dawn came, I knew how much Tex Cummins had done for me by
  selecting such a horse. There must have been some of the bone and heart of a
  thoroughbred in him, for in spite of the keen work of the night, his head was
  still high, and his ears were pricking now and again.</p>

  <p>It had been a mighty march, but now I had my reward, for we were already
  in the foothills, and the great dawn-blackened mountains went storming up
  through the gray of the sky above me. They had seemed gentle marvels of cool
  blue, in the distance&mdash;they were bleak monsters with ragged heads,
  viewed at close hand.</p>

  <p>I kept straight ahead, however, in spite of the fatigue of my horse, until
  the rolling lands tossed me into the heart of the more rugged country. I
  chose for my halting place the flat shoulder of a mountain fenced about by a
  scattering of young firs and pines. In the central clearing there was ample
  good pasturage for my horse. As for myself, I was hungry enough, but I was
  far more weary. In a snug roll of blankets which the kindness of Tex Cummins
  had provided behind my saddle, I rolled up and in the thickest spot of shade
  which I could find, I was soon soundly asleep.</p>

  <p>It was early morning! I suppose that the sun had not been above the
  eastern mountains more than an hour on its way when I first closed my eyes,
  and it was in just the opposite place when I opened them again. I had slept
  through a full twelve hours!</p>

  <p>What I first felt was a stab of hunger. It was something over thirty hours
  since I had eaten, and at eighteen, with six feet and some odd inches of
  strong body maturing, and after a huge ride and after all the weary, lean
  hours of fasting during my jail days of trial and imprisonment, I was in the
  mood of a python which has a winter's fast behind it.</p>

  <p>But I forgot food an instant later. Something stirred stealthily in the
  trees and brought flashing back upon my mind the realization that I was a
  fugitive from justice, condemned to a dreary long term of imprisonment by the
  due course of the law, and in as much vital danger as though I had really
  murdered that queer beast, Turk Niginski, and not downed him in the fairest
  of fair fights.</p>

  <p>The realization of what I was, combined with that sound among the trees,
  brought me whirling to my feet with a gun in my hand. In three bounds, there
  was the cry of a girl, half squeal and half scream, in front of me, while she
  went scurrying out into the open.</p>

  <p>I stopped at the edge of the trees and considered her, running with the
  sun sparkling in the red hair which the wind of her speed had blown out
  behind her. She was such a pretty sight that I almost forgot to be afraid of
  the danger which this glimpse she had had of me asleep might bring on my
  trail.</p>

  <p>I called: "Well, kid, what's behind you?"</p>

  <p>It stopped her as though I had tossed a rope over her head and borne back
  on it. She halted and turned around on me. I saw that I should not have
  called her "kid." She was a bit too old and too pretty for that. She seemed
  about fifteen or sixteen; but she was not tall for her age, and that was why
  I thought she was just a youngster when she ran away from me. Perhaps fifteen
  or sixteen may seem young enough to you, but you must remember that I was
  only eighteen myself.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by calling me a kid?" said she, still gasping a
  little.</p>

  <p>But the shock of that first fright was leaving her every moment.</p>

  <p>I sat down on a flat-topped stump. There was no one to see. There was only
  an old shack of a farmhouse down in the cup of the valley with a stick of
  white smoke stuck on top of it and broken squarely across by the wind after
  it rose a little way.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think," said I, "that a grown-up woman like you would be running
  away every time a man said good morning to you."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said she, and put her hands on her hips with a very fine air. "Do
  you say good morning to most folks with a gun in your hand?"</p>

  <p>"That was just for luck," said I, "to cheer things along a little."</p>

  <p>"You're a nervy kind," said she, and she chuckled a little. She even
  walked back up the slope and stood in front of me so close that I could watch
  the green of her eyes. For lack of something else to do, she took the thick
  length of silken red hair over her shoulder and began to braid it; watching
  me all the time the way one man watches another man&mdash;with suspicion, you
  know, and a sort of hostile interest.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you expected someone else," said she, and she gave me a crooked
  little smile that sank a dimple in one cheek.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I did," said I, grinning at her.</p>

  <p>"Maybe a gun would've been in order for him," said she.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it would," said I.</p>

  <p>But I didn't like this thread of conversation at all. She was trailing too
  close to the truth. While I thought it over I took another tuck in my belt.
  It was already drawn up fairly tight, and this reef bit pretty deep into my
  waistline. She nodded at me as though she understood.</p>

  <p>"Hungry, eh?" said she.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I. "Excuse me!"</p>

  <p>For just then I saw a pair of long ears flicked behind a stone. I glided
  out my Colt just in time to sink a bullet through the head of a big jack. It
  rolled ten feet down the hill before it lay still, with the echoes still
  barking back at us from the upper hills. I got the rabbit and brought it
  back. I cleaned it while she talked to me. It was breakfast, lunch, and
  dinner to me, and I worked fast.</p>

  <p>"You might bring up a bit of a fire for me," said I, "if you need
  something to do."</p>

  <p>"You are crusty," says she. But she chuckled again and built the fire in
  the center of the clearing. I had rabbit meat roasting in two snaps of your
  fingers. It was a sweet smell to me.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing so far away from home?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Riding herd," said she quick as a wink, and she waved to a score or two
  of cows browsing two miles away.</p>

  <p>I saw that she was not going to talk any more than she felt was
  healthy.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Margaret O'Rourke," said she.</p>

  <p>"What does that make for short?" said I.</p>

  <p>"A man with a good education," says she, "can pronounce the whole
  thing."</p>

  <p>"I was always too lazy to study," says I. "I hate making a speech. Suppose
  I call you 'Mike?'"</p>

  <p>She blinked at me for a minute.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm in disguise?" says she.</p>

  <p>She was a sassy young thing, but there was never anything more feminine in
  the world, from the turn of her ankles to the tilt of her nose.</p>

  <p>"You ran like a boy," said I. "I didn't know, Mike, but what you might be
  one."</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, "you're cool! I think I'll step along."</p>

  <p>But I knew by the way she gathered herself together and stood up, that she
  didn't intend to go.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, I had never before talked to a girl as I was talking
  to her. I think that I had even been a bit backward with them, particularly
  after my years with Father McGuire took me away from the company of them so
  much. But when a man has his mind full of the danger of the law, and squints
  twice at every bush on the hillside to see if there isn't a shadow of a man
  behind it; and when the flash of every leaf in the forest may be a glint of a
  gun with an eye squinted at you behind it&mdash;one forgets a good deal of
  self-consciousness even at eighteen.</p>

  <p>I merely grinned at Margaret O'Rourke again and said: "I'm sorry that you
  can't stay for the rabbit."</p>

  <p>It was nearer the eating point every second. Now she wrinkled her nose to
  smell the fragrance of it.</p>

  <p>"I might stay, after all," said she.</p>

  <p>I began to whistle a tune and stirred the fire, while she turned the sharp
  stick on which the meat was spitted.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you won't urge me," said she.</p>

  <p>"A girl named Mike," said I, "is pretty apt to do what she pleases. I've
  invited you once!"</p>

  <p>She kicked at a pebble and sent it spinning off. It darted under the nose
  of my gray gelding as he was reaching for a tuft of bunch grass, and he
  tossed up his head and danced back, snorting. Then she stared down at me for
  a minute, but I could see her fighting against a smile.</p>

  <p>"I've never met up with any one just like you," said she.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said I.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say that I meant it that way," murmured Mike. "What might your
  name be?"</p>

  <p>"Smithers," I told her. "Larry Smithers."</p>

  <p>"Where do you hang out?"</p>

  <p>The only town I knew of in the mountains was called Camden. I told her
  that I came from that direction.</p>

  <p>"Been long on the trail?" said she.</p>

  <p>"Just a spell," said I indefinitely, for I had not the slightest idea how
  many leagues Camden might be away.</p>

  <p>"Which trail did you come?" said she. "The short one or the long one?"</p>

  <p>"The short one," said I.</p>

  <p>"That's why your horse looks so spent, I suppose," said she.</p>

  <p>Of course that made me open my eyes at her.</p>

  <p>She explained: "Because if you hit north through these mountains without
  knowing the trails, it'll be rougher and leaner work than you ever did
  before, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Mike," said I, "didn't you hear me say that I'm drifting south?"</p>

  <p>"Drifting," said she, with a neat little emphasis, "is a pretty good word
  for it. You wouldn't call it really riding, I guess."</p>

  <p>She jerked a thumb over her shoulder toward the gelding. Of course, the
  good horse was a bit tucked up from his work of the night before, and he was
  pretty heavily marked with the salt of the sweat that had worked out on
  him.</p>

  <p>I was worried. Not so much by what she said as by her manner of saying it.
  Those green eyes had a twinkle in them as they watched me, and I knew that
  she was seeing my trouble and preparing to make the most of it.</p>

  <p>"That horse is soft," said I.</p>

  <p>"I could tell that," she answered, throwing the ball straight back to me
  so that my fingers stung. "I could tell that by the look of his
  shoulders&mdash;and his quarters, too."</p>

  <p>I couldn't help taking a look at the gray. He was in the very pink of the
  best condition, and there was not the least doubt of it. It stood out all
  over his body. On the quarters of the shoulders the long, ropy muscles slid
  into tangles and out again every time he took a step.</p>

  <p>But how could I expect a girl of fifteen or sixteen to know so much?</p>

  <p>"How old are you, Mike?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Sixteen, Joe," said she.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say my name was Joe."</p>

  <p>"I know it isn't Larry," said she.</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"By the black of your eyes," said she. "You never got that very far north
  of the Rio Grande."</p>

  <p>"My family have always been travelers," said I.</p>

  <p>"There's no clay between here and Camden," said she, and jerked her thumb
  at the gelding again.</p>

  <p>It was braided and tangled in his fetlocks. I saw that she knew a very
  great deal too much. Half an hour after she left me, she might have the
  sheriff on my trail.</p>

  <p>"I took a detour," said I.</p>

  <p>I hoped that might serve to put her off, but she was back at me in a flash
  with: "Were they following you as close as all that?" said she.</p>

  <p>I blinked at her again. Then I laughed and chucked all the cards on the
  table face up; not all at once, however. I was willing to let her know that I
  was in the wrong, but I didn't want her to guess in what way.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said I, "I got into a fracas with the son of the
  sheriff down yonder." Here I waved to the south. "I took a punch at him. He
  hit his head on the floor as he went down, and it opened up the claret. The
  sheriff swore I'd used a club and started hunting for me. So I thought I
  might as well slide out for the tall timber. Sheriffs have a nasty way of
  soaking a fellow when they feel like it."</p>

  <p>I said it very confidentially, and she nodded in a most friendly way.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," murmured Mike, "that you used the same sort of a punch that
  dropped the rabbit?"</p>

  <p>In boxing parlance&mdash;and that comes naturally to me after three years
  with Father McGuire&mdash;it was as though she countered with a nice right
  just as I led with a straight left. She caught me flat-footed and put me back
  on my heels, pretty groggy. I could only stare at her for a moment.</p>

  <p>She was too clever not to follow up her opening. She hit me again before I
  could put my hands up.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you hit him from the hip, just the way you did the rabbit?"
  said she.</p>

  <p>From the time I began to live in fear of my life from the gun of Harry
  Chase and started practicing every day with a Colt, I had worked at a quick
  draw, and I suppose that shot had seemed rather neat to Mike. At any rate, it
  was plain that I couldn't bamboozle her. I simply blurted out:</p>

  <p>"Do all the girls up here grow this fast above the eyes?"</p>

  <p>"I have two brothers," said Mike.</p>

  <p>She said it in a way that was as much as though she had explained that
  they had put her through a pretty stiff course of sprouts.</p>

  <p>"They've stayed up nights studying with you, I guess," said I.</p>

  <p>"They've been a pretty liberal education," admitted Mike. "Did you kill
  him, or just wing the sheriff's son?"</p>

  <p>She asked it as any other girl might have asked if I had killed or winged
  a wild goose.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't the sheriff's son," said I.</p>

  <p>"You've got me all tangled up," said she. "Which is the right story, after
  all?"</p>

  <p>"The one you haven't heard," said I. "Do you want it?"</p>

  <p>She knew by the straightness of my eye that I meant business this time,
  and she flushed with excitement. But then she set her teeth and shook her
  head, almost as though she were angry.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said she, "of course I want to know. But you don't have to
  tell me. I'm not a sneaking quitter. Whether you're in the right or the
  wrong, I don't know. But I like&mdash;the way you roast rabbit!"</p>

  <p>She gave me that twisted smile again with the dimple drilled right in the
  center of one cheek. I loved that smile this time, you can be sure.</p>

  <p>"Whether you talk or keep still," said she, "I won't go blabbing. The
  sheriff doesn't have me on his payroll."</p>

  <p>I reached her in one jump. I took hold of her two hands and looked her in
  the eye.</p>

  <p>"Green eyes," said I, "you're a square shooter! I'd back you for a good
  scout against the best man that ever stepped!"</p>

  <p>She was a little pleased, I think, but she only said: "You've dropped your
  rabbit in the dirt!"</p>

  <p>It took a bit of the gimp out of me. But I went back and found that the
  meat had only dropped in a clean bunch of grass. I picked it up and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"All right," said I, "I'm going to tell you the whole yarn."</p>

  <p>"Wait till you're outside of that rabbit," said she. "And then you can
  talk."</p>

  <p>A starved dog doesn't wait to be asked twice when it sees a bone. I was
  picking the small bones of that rabbit about a minute later, and I only had
  to let the belt out one notch. That rabbit simply evaporated inside me.</p>

  <p>"How is it?" said Mike, licking her lips. I had offered her a section of
  the meat two or three times, but she wouldn't take it.</p>

  <p>"It's a good beginning," said I.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mike. "It simply fills up the holes and gets the ground all
  leveled out for a real meal."</p>

  <p>"Darn!" said I. "Here I've wandered away without the makings."</p>

  <p>A moment later she got a sack of Bull Durham and brown papers from
  somewhere and chucked them to me.</p>

  <p>"D'you smoke?" said I, chucking about half that sack into a paper. I
  squinted at her. According to the sayings of Father McGuire, ladies don't
  smoke outside of big cities. Leastwise, they shouldn't.</p>

  <p>"No," said Mike. "But I have two brothers."</p>

  <p>I lay back and gave her a look from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"I like you," said I.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; A STOCKHOLDER</h2>

  <p class="first">It isn't hard to have to talk about oneself, when you're
  eighteen. As far as that goes, it's never so very difficult. But I took a
  slant at the sun, and by the hang of it in the sky, I knew that it was about
  time for Mike to trot back home. So I had to boil down my story into a
  nutshell.</p>

  <p>"My name is Leon Porfilo," said I. "My mother was Irish. My father came
  within a split second of being all white, too, but the last fraction of him
  was Mexican Indian. That's where I get my black eyes and my dark skin. Some
  people have called me a greaser!"</p>

  <p>I stopped here for a minute and looked at her.</p>

  <p>"I admire them for that," said Mike. "They were brave men."</p>

  <p>It was a neat way of making a compliment; it tickled me in just the right
  place, and I was a little red when I went on. I told her of my training with
  Father McGuire, and my three encounters with Harry Chase. And I told her what
  had led me to the mountains.</p>

  <p>She sat and thought it over for a moment with her square chin resting on
  her brown fist.</p>

  <p>"It was that rich man named Chase, I suppose," said she. "I suppose he
  bribed Niginski to get you into trouble so that Harry wouldn't break his neck
  falling off a cliff named Leon Porfilo."</p>

  <p>It staggered me again. It was a conclusion that I myself had not had wits
  enough to reach. It was Tex Cummins who had given me the first hint of that
  idea. Here was a little kid in her teens who popped right onto the truth at
  the first jump. At least, I had a pretty good idea that it was close to the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"You ought to be a weather prophet," I told her. "You could read the mind
  of a northeaster, if it has a mind."</p>

  <p>"I've got two brothers," said this queer girl. "So now you're all set to
  blow north?"</p>

  <p>"That's it. With the horse Tex Cummins gave me."</p>

  <p>"Who is this here Tex Cummins?" said she, pointing a finger at me.</p>

  <p>But by this time I was beginning to be afraid of her. She knew too much
  for me. She was so much smarter and quicker than I, that, beside her, I felt
  like a fat steer beside a cow pony.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"Is he an old friend?"</p>

  <p>"I've only seen him a couple of times."</p>

  <p>"Humph," said the girl, and began to prod at the gravel with a stick.</p>

  <p>"It's about time for you to be drifting home, Mike," said I.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Mike, "how did Cummins get to know you?"</p>

  <p>"He saw me fighting Harry Chase the second time, and he bet on me when the
  rest were backing Harry."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mike, "I don't like the sound of him."</p>

  <p>I gasped at her: "Why, he's taken me out of jail, fixed me with a horse
  and blankets, and"</p>

  <p>"And turned you loose without a cent in your pockets. You haven't a
  penny!"</p>

  <p>"Darn it!" said I. "How do you guess that?"</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, she twisted away from me, and a minute later she
  turned around and tossed me a little rolled-up greenback. I unfurled it and
  read "twenty dollars." It was the prettiest little poem I had ever read in my
  life, but of course I held it out to her.</p>

  <p>"I can't take charity," said I.</p>

  <p>"Jiminy," said Mike, laughing at me, "you are silly. Why shouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have two brothers," said she.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't answer everything in the world."</p>

  <p>"It nearly does," said she. "If you knew them, you'd understand."</p>

  <p>"You pack around a bit of spare change for them when they're in a tight
  corner?" said I.</p>

  <p>She paid no attention to me. Her eyes were shadowy with more thinking, and
  although I felt pretty small about it, I tucked that money into a trouser
  pocket and wished that God could show me how any angel could be finer than
  this girl.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering about this Chase family," said she. "How many are
  they?"</p>

  <p>"Three," said I.</p>

  <p>"You've licked one of them three times," said she. "What about the other
  two?"</p>

  <p>"Harry is about enough for me," said I. "I've licked him, but it's always
  been a tight squeeze. He's bigger than I am. His father is rich and seems a
  pretty straight shooter. Then he has an older brother called Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Andrew Chase!" cried Mike.</p>

  <p>I was not surprised that she had heard of him. Not very surprised. I knew
  that everyone in the desert stretches of the range was familiar with his
  reputation, and it would have been strange if the stories about him had not
  wandered a little way into the mountains.</p>

  <p>"That's the one," said I.</p>

  <p>"Poor Leon Porfilo" said she. "If Andrew Chase starts after you, I suppose
  that's the end? Now that the law is against you, I suppose he wouldn't mind a
  little hunting trip?"</p>

  <p>It didn't stir up my pride. I knew that I was a pretty good fighter, gun
  or knife or fist&mdash;but I knew that Andrew Chase was just a thousand times
  better. I simply shook my head.</p>

  <p>"If he comes after me," I admitted, "I suppose that I'm done!"</p>

  <p>"It's hard luck," said Mike. "Tell me one thing more."</p>

  <p>"Blaze away."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to go straight, Leon?" I had not thought particularly about
  that. To save my hide was my chief concern.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that I am," said I. "I want to."</p>

  <p>"I want you to," said she. "I want my part of you to go straight as a die!
  I've bought twenty dollars' worth of you, Leon!"</p>

  <p>It was an odd way of looking at the affair, but then, everything about
  Mike was odd.</p>

  <p>"All right," said I. "You have twenty dollars in me. I'll try to keep that
  much straight."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Leon," said Mike, and she came a little closer to me, "keep all of
  yourself straight! The mountains have enough crooks scattered around through
  them already. I see them now and then. They fry in the sun all summer; and
  they freeze all winter. They ride a hundred miles to get drunk on moonshine
  whisky; and then when they're full of it, they ride another hundred miles to
  murder an old friend. They start out just sort of naturally sliding downhill.
  They mean to be honest, at first, but once they're outside of the
  law&mdash;what can they do?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Mike," said I. "What can they do?"</p>

  <p>"Then if they can't do any better," said Mike, tucking her chin up into
  the air, "why don't they put a bullet through their own heads rather than to
  come to live like sneaking, stealing rats? Oh, I hate a man that would live
  that way! I hate a man. I'd hate you, Leon Porfilo&mdash;even if you do have
  such a funny way of telling lies!"</p>

  <p>She ended on a smile, but there was so much seriousness in her that I
  found myself blinking and winking at her. You have no idea how she had grown
  in the last few minutes. I began to feel as though she were actually my
  elder; she had gathered me up into the palm of her hand, you might say, and
  was giving me a lesson, shaking her finger at me.</p>

  <p>To tell you the truth, it threw the matter before me in a new way. Since
  society had driven me out, it seemed to me that the only thing to do was to
  live just as I could. I knew that society had been wrong in turning me
  outdoors. Then let society take the consequences! But Mike put a new face on
  matters. I told her frankly that I would hate to have her despise me, and
  that I would make a hard try to go straight.</p>

  <p>"If you're broke again, ride up that ravine across the valley," said Mike,
  "until you come to an old house over the creek. If you were to stand outside
  in the dark and whistle like this"</p>

  <p>She whistled twice, made a pause, and whistled again. "I'd know that you
  were there, and I'd come out with another twenty dollars&mdash;if I had that
  much!"</p>

  <p>How could I answer her? I could merely stare. Then she added with her
  strange little smile: "If I had forty dollars' worth of you, I might nearly
  control the stock. Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Mike," said I, in a rather wobbly voice, "why, Mike, if I can go
  straight, I'll"</p>

  <p>She changed her own voice at once and made it very crisp and sharp. "You'd
  better saddle your horse," said she. "It's about time for you to run
  along!"</p>

  <p>I knew she understood that I had been on the verge of growing sentimental.
  I bit my lip and did as she bade me, like a very dumb, down-headed, foolish
  boy.</p>

  <p>When I had rubbed the saddle marks off the gray and brushed him and rubbed
  him all over with a hard twist of dry grass, I cinched the saddle on him and
  dug my knee into his ribs to make the rascal let the wind out of his lungs.
  Then I came back to her, leading the gelding.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to blow north," said I. "But may I walk a way home with you,
  Mike?"</p>

  <p>"You may not," said she. "I don't like the silly look in your eye!"</p>

  <p>It angered me, and then I twitched my brains back into good working order
  and saw that she was quite right. I had been growing pretty foolishly soft
  about her, and she had a right to jerk me back to my better senses.</p>

  <p>I shook hands with her. "I hope that you'll never hear that your twenty
  dollars has gone wrong," said I.</p>

  <p>"I hope that I won't," said Mike, with her green eyes very serious.</p>

  <p>I climbed into the saddle. "So long, Mike."</p>

  <p>"So long, Leon. Wait a minute. How old are you?"</p>

  <p>A little spirit came back to me. "I've forgotten that," said I, and so I
  rode off on the northern trail.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; SEEKING SHELTER</h2>

  <p class="first">I felt very triumphant because I had, in a way, had the
  pleasure of the last smile at the expense of Mike. But it was rather a flat
  pleasure. By the time I had topped the next ridge of the mountains, though
  there was still a warm glow in the mountain sky, the valley was beginning to
  take thick pools of shadow, and the lights winked on in the windows of the
  ranch house far below me. At the same time a cutting wind began to comb
  across the mountains.</p>

  <p>Ah, that wind! There are sailors who will swear to you that a storm at sea
  is a wicked thing, but I have always felt that it is the reeling, staggering,
  unsure ship that makes a sea storm dreadful. In the mountains, it is another
  matter, and the wind itself is the devil turned loose. I had my first taste
  of a mountain storm that night.</p>

  <p>I had to lean far forward in the saddle against the sheer poundage of the
  gale that shot across the ridge, while my poor horse, desert bred, tried to
  stop every now and then and bunch its back and drop its head between its
  forelegs&mdash;and great shudders of cold went through the chilled gelding.
  However, I had to bear it, and my horse had to bear it, too.</p>

  <p>I have been in worse storms than that one during my life in the mountains.
  But considering that this was the first, and that I was on a desert horse,
  and in the dark of unknown trails, I think that the combination was terrible
  enough.</p>

  <p>Pressed up against the sky, I felt all that any poor man can feel who has
  climbed into a chair of power greater than he can use. I felt
  naked&mdash;naked of my cold body, and naked of my colder soul.</p>

  <p>When I saw a thin, yellow, winking light before me, I did not pause to
  reconnoiter. I headed straight for it! Had I known that behind that single
  ray of light there waited for me a whole group of the bitterest
  enemies&mdash;a whole posse with a sheriff at the head of it&mdash;had there
  been a fifty-thousand-dollar reward upon my head, dead or alive&mdash;I
  should nevertheless have done as I did&mdash;ride straight to the barn behind
  the house and put up my horse in the first vacant stall, and then, carrying
  my saddle and bridle, proceed to the door of the house itself.</p>

  <p>I battered at it. Before there was an answer from within, a great handful
  of wind, scooped from the black heart of the gorge behind me, struck me in
  the back and set the whole house staggering and chattering.</p>

  <p>Somewhere from within there was a sound of crashing pottery, and then the
  windy bang of a closing door. I cast one glance behind me at the rough edges
  of the ravine, towering high above me. The cloud masses which had shut across
  the face of the heavens earlier in the night were scattered now. Through the
  gaping rifts bright shafts of starlight struck down and showed dizzy glimpses
  of the black sky itself which swam behind the flocking thunder clouds.</p>

  <p>I waited for no more. Like a scared boy, with all my hundred and ninety
  pounds of athletic bone and muscle quivering, I wrenched the door open and
  jumped inside. It took the full strength of my arm to press the door shut
  behind me, and the blast which the momentary opening of the door loosed
  across the room raised a great flapping and a tearing of papers, and a
  violent rush of oaths.</p>

  <p>Now, with my shoulders leaning back against the door, I shrugged the chill
  out of the small of my back and blinked at the unfamiliar brightness of the
  light from a big, round-burner lamp on the central table.</p>

  <p>I did not see clearly. I only made out three men, but just what manner of
  men, I could not very well tell, for the wind had stung the tears into my
  eyes in a thick mist.</p>

  <p>I was very conscious, however, that after the storm of oaths, there was a
  black moment of silence. Then a heavy voice said without cordiality: "Make
  yourself at home. There's a chair yonder by the stove."</p>

  <p>I hung up my saddle and bridle, and went to the chair beside the stove.
  While the heat waves washed legs and head and throat and belly, and sent the
  cold shuddering out of me, a gruff voice asked:</p>

  <p>"Chow?"</p>

  <p>"Yep," said I, and stretched my arms closer around the stove.</p>

  <p>At my answer, one of the men had lurched with a groan of involuntary
  protest out of his chair and strode into a kitchen from which he came back
  with a tin plate, which he cast clattering down on the table. He spooned a
  great heap of brown beans into it, a chunk of white fat of pork, and tossed
  down a liberal square of bread. Then he poured a tin cup of coffee&mdash;the
  greater part of a pint.</p>

  <p>I did not wait for my invitation. It seemed as though the last relics of
  the rabbit had disappeared into my vitals a long age since. Wind and weather
  and the labor of the ride and the vital strain upon my courage and my
  attention through so many hours among the mountains, had made me a more
  famished man than ever. I marched across that plate with a huge iron spoon in
  less time than any heroic charge was ever sent home in history. The host,
  without a word, strode again into the kitchen and returned with an iron pot
  which, still without speech, he settled with a thump before me.</p>

  <p>It was half filled with beans and pork. I ate like a wolf, or an Indian,
  until I was through. Then, with a great sigh, with the bottom of the kettle
  almost stripped of its provisions, I loosed my belt to the last notch and
  settled back in my chair. As I did so, I raised my head to the level of a
  small mirror set against the wall.</p>

  <p>It showed me my own face, my broad mouth, my blunt nose, and that square,
  heavily timbered jaw which, as Father McGuire was wont to say, was designed
  by a special Providence for the careless receipt of all the buffets which
  life was likely to send my way. I saw that, and the gleaming black of my
  eyes, and the glossy black of my Indian hair, and the high cheek bones which
  are the sign of that outcross of blood which has marked me so deep, and the
  swarthy skin now flushed with rushing blood in the newly welcomed heat of the
  room.</p>

  <p>I saw all of these things, and then I saw, in the outer corner of the
  mirror, the dim picture of a man standing with his feet spread wide apart,
  leaning against the opposite wall of the room. I saw thick cowhide boots on
  his legs, and heavy corduroy trousers, stained on the thighs with a crust of
  dirt and grease&mdash;perhaps from an untidy habit of wiping his hands there.
  I saw a burly body and a woolen shirt opened at the hairy throat. I saw a
  bull neck and a seamed, stern face decorated with a lean fighting jaw and a
  pair of all-seeing eyes.</p>

  <p>He seemed to guess that I was watching and considering him. For now he
  said: "Well, Porfilo, have you had enough?"</p>

  <p>The name went through my heart like a jag of lightning through a summer
  sky. I leaned heavily forward in the chair and then, swinging around, I saw a
  last detail of his costume which I had not marked before&mdash;the well-
  polished steel shield of a sheriff pinned on the breast of his shirt!</p>

  <p>I flipped a hand back for my gun. But the sheriff did not make a move for
  his. Neither did either of the other two. They merely leaned forward in their
  chairs with their elbows on their knees and regarded me with a sort of sad
  concern and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>It was the telegraph, of course, which had given them a description. No
  doubt the wires had been working as they sent out the word of me from Mendez,
  and, with my height and bulk and complexion, it was not difficult to spot me
  from the most casual description. They could practically wire my photograph
  over the entire range.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said the sheriff, "but I hope that you come in here to give
  yourself up, Porfilo?"</p>

  <p>"You have me," said I. "Will you tell me your name?"</p>

  <p>"Richard Lawton," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Well, sheriff, here's my gun," said I, and I handed over the revolver
  which Tex Cummins had provided in the saddle holster of the outfit with which
  he had equipped me.</p>

  <p>The sheriff looked down to it like a man in a dream. He folded his hands
  behind his back.</p>

  <p>"Well, boys?" said he. "What am I gonna do?"</p>

  <p>"It may be a stall," said one.</p>

  <p>I pushed the revolver back into its leather.</p>

  <p>"It may be a stall," replied the sheriff in the same tone. "I dunno. I
  dunno what to guess. But he wasn't so tuckered out that he had to come in
  here!"</p>

  <p>"It's up to you," said one of his companions.</p>

  <p>"Damnation!" growled the sheriff.</p>

  <p>I could not imagine what they were talking about, except that it was me.
  Why the cold steel of handcuffs was not already securing my wrists, I could
  not dream.</p>

  <p>The sheriff began to pace the floor. He was a huge man. He was as
  massively built as Harry Chase himself. My hundred and ninety pounds felt
  fairly elfish in contrast with him.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped with his back turned to all of us. "He didn't know me,"
  said he. "I guess that's straight, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I guess that's straight," answered the pair in the same tone, staring
  earnestly at me.</p>

  <p>"He come in and hung up his saddle and his bridle. You seen that
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I seen it!" they replied.</p>

  <p>"Darn his boots!" groaned the sheriff. "Ain't this a devil of a hole for a
  man to be in?"</p>

  <p>"The law is the law, by my way of looking at it," said one of Lawton's
  friends.</p>

  <p>"Darn the law!" said the sheriff. "I'm thinkin' about something that's
  more important."</p>

  <p>"What can that be?"</p>

  <p>"My honor, you squarehead!"</p>

  <p>He was working himself into a greater and greater passion. For my part,
  the talk was so much beyond me that I began to be a bit worried. It was like
  sitting in the presence of three serious madmen.</p>

  <p>A clock began to strike rapidly and rang out eleven o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Bedtime," said the sheriff. "And what about him?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. The two scratched their chins and looked at me and
  then at one another.</p>

  <p>"Aw, the devil!" said Mr. Lawton. "I'm gonna do this the way I want to do
  it. The pair of you can talk all you want, and you can let everybody in the
  mountains hear about it!"</p>

  <p>"Not a word from me," said one. "Only I'm considerable glad that I ain't
  in your boots. I'm downright sorry for you, Lawton!"</p>

  <p>All this time, while he fought out some inward battle, the sheriff had
  kept his back to us and his face to the wall, and his big voice had been
  quivering and booming through the room. Now he turned sharply and beckoned to
  me. I followed him without a word through a door that opened into a little
  side room with a snug bunk built against the wall. There was a tick stuffed
  with straw on it, looking deliciously soft and comfortable.</p>

  <p>"You got your own blankets," said the sheriff. "You can turn in!"</p>

  <p>I waited, without saying a word. I waited for the irons which would surely
  be used to secure me for the night. The sheriff seemed to understand my
  perplexity, for, as he went out, he leaned a moment at the door.</p>

  <p>"I'll put you on parole, kid," said he.</p>

  <p>It made me jerk up my head like a horse that sights the home barn.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I mean it," said the somber man.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll take you on it! You can have my word of honor, Lawton!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," murmured the sheriff, and he gave me a queer, uncomfortable
  little smile. "I suppose I'll see you in the morning, then?"</p>

  <p>"You will."</p>

  <p>The sheriff tilted back his head and laughter flooded his thick
  throat.</p>

  <p>"All right, kid," said he. "I got to admit that you're a rare one!"</p>

  <p>I sat down on the edge of the bunk after I had spread out my blankets, and
  I tried to puzzle the thing out. What the whole disturbance was about, I
  could not understand at all, except that it was clear that there was a weight
  upon the mind of the sheriff just as there was a weight upon the minds of the
  others.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I should have remained awake to think the thing out, and then I
  might have seen through the mystery, but after my exposure, the warmth from
  the food and the meal I had eaten served to put me into a drowsy humor; my
  brain was working like the stiff cogs of an unoiled machine. I curled the
  blanket around me, and I was asleep in another moment.</p>

  <p>When I wakened at last, the storm was no longer rumbling, but the wind was
  whistling a keen song around the edges of the house. The sun was shining
  through the little window, and the noise of tins was in the big room, and a
  stir of voices. The sheriff and his friends were wakening.</p>

  <p>I tumbled out as quickly as I could, and when I stepped into the living
  room, the first man that saw me was one of Lawton's companions. He gave out a
  wild sort of yell, as though he had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Name of Heaven!" cried the man. "Hey, Lawton!"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Lawton, come here!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff came into the doorway with his sleeves rolled up and a strip
  of raw bacon on the end of his fork, just as it had been when he prepared to
  drop it into the frying pan. He threw up both his hands. The strip of bacon
  fluttered away and flopped in the middle of the floor.</p>

  <p>"It ain't him!" cried Lawton. "It's his ghost!"</p>

  <p>"I thought of that&mdash;but there's his saddle!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff strode up to me in a black passion. "You stayed over!" he
  snarled at me.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Why, darn your heart," said he, "how long d'you think I want you
  here?"</p>

  <p>It was an odd question.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't have to feed the boys in jail out of your own
  pocket," I suggested stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Jail? Jail, the devil," said the sheriff. "Who said anything about
  jail?"</p>

  <p>A weird little hope went through me; it was too fantastic to be put into
  words, I felt.</p>

  <p>"I understood" I began.</p>

  <p>"You understood nothin'!" he broke in. "Or else you wouldn't be here!"</p>

  <p>"Lawton," said I, "it may sound foolish, but as a matter of fact, this
  sounds very much to me as though you wanted to make an end of keeping me in
  any place. It almost sounds as though you figured on turning me loose!"</p>

  <p>"Does it look that way?" sneered Lawton. "Why, you got eyes, then, ain't
  you?"</p>

  <p>His sarcasm, however, did not affect me. "Very well," said I. "I have done
  talking. You may say what you please."</p>

  <p>He glowered again. His passion seemed to be rising every minute. "Look
  here, kid," said Lawton, "I don't aim to be hard on kids like you. But, worse
  that that&mdash;I can't be hard on you!"</p>

  <p>"Sheriff," said I, "I don't follow this. Will you say it in words of one
  syllable?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff raised his big voice to its top note&mdash;and he had a voice
  which would have swamped the bellow of a mad bull.</p>

  <p>"You young jackass!" yelled he. "Ain't this my house? Can I jail a fool
  kid that walks in and eats my chuck?"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; A RUNNING START</h2>

  <p class="first">When I told that story to Tex Cummins, a little later, he
  said: "How did you feel?"</p>

  <p>I simply blurted out: "I felt like the devil!"</p>

  <p>That was the truth. The sharpest emotion that I felt was simply a great
  shame, that I should have put a man of that caliber into such a position that
  he had to violate the law in order to maintain his sense of chivalry. It
  fairly knocked the ground out from under me. There was something so clean and
  direct and sort of childish about that attitude of mind, that it reminded me
  of Mike O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"My Lord," said I to the sheriff, "what sort of men do these mountains
  breed?"</p>

  <p>That took him back even more than what he said had taken me back. He stood
  there scratching his chin. Both of his friends had come in. I call them his
  friends. I might just as well have called them his trained man hunters, for
  that was what they were.</p>

  <p>"Look at this fool kid," said the sheriff. "He took me at my word. I give
  him a parole and he takes it, and he lives up to it! Now what in the devil am
  I gonna do about it?</p>

  <p>"Look here, kid," said he, "what do I make out of you? You murdered a gent
  called Turk Niginski. That's what you go to the pen for!"</p>

  <p>"If I live to be a hundred," said I, "they'll never have a murder against
  me. That man tried to send a bullet through me. He hit my hat instead of my
  head. That was my luck. His luck was to get my slug fair and square. But when
  they picked him up to take him to town, they couldn't locate his gun; and
  when they looked at my gun, there were two empty chambers. Y'understand? I'd
  taken a flier at a rabbit and missed it. That was what beat me. They said
  that I'd shot the hole in my own hat."</p>

  <p>"Well, boys?" said the sheriff to his companions.</p>

  <p>They merely shrugged their shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Speaking professional, I don't believe a word you've said," remarked the
  sheriff in his rough way. "You been found guilty, and them that are found
  guilty are guilty. What twelve men decide on is Bible for every sheriff in
  this here country. But speaking man to man, I got to say that I believe
  everything you've said and a lot more. I think you're innocent."</p>

  <p>I cannot tell you how it thrilled me to hear him say it. A vast faith in
  human nature was brought back in a wave of joy upon my heart.</p>

  <p>He went on: "I'm gonna turn you loose. I wish that it had been at night
  so's nobody could see you leave my house. But it's got to be by day. So,
  vamose."</p>

  <p>I was happier still. I went up to the sheriff and held out my hand.</p>

  <p>"Lawton," said I, "when I thank you, I mean to"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" said he. "I don't want to shake hands with you. I'm gonna give
  you a running start&mdash;for a whole hour. Then I'm going to start on your
  trail and my two bunkies with me. We're going to get you, too! We've got
  horses that are fast and fresh, and we know this country&mdash;which you
  don't, I suppose. We're going to get you, kid, and we're going to send you
  back to Mendez on the way to the State prison, with a little extra added onto
  your term for breaking prison. I'm a sheriff. I've swore to uphold the law.
  I'm going to do it. I'll run you down if it takes my last hoss and my last
  man!"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that he meant business. It scared me; but it made me
  respect him, too.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I answered him. "If you're coming after me, I've got to tell
  you one thing in exchange for the white way you've treated me. If I'm caught,
  I go up to the pen for enough years to wreck my life. I'm not going up!"</p>

  <p>"You're going to beat all the officers of the law?" said the sheriff with
  a sneer. "You're going to outsmart us?"</p>

  <p>I looked at him without any anger. I suppose that the little stretch of
  time since I left the house of Father McGuire to go to jail had aged me more
  than all my life before. I was beginning to understand&mdash;oh, not very
  much, but a few of the corners of the world.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I can," said I. "I don't think that I can outsmart
  you, and I don't think that I can beat you. But when you corner me, you won't
  take me alive."</p>

  <p>He was serious enough, at that, and scowled at me. "You'll fight it out,
  then?" said he.</p>

  <p>"They took me up on a crooked charge," said I. "I've got a right to be
  free and to fight to keep free!"</p>

  <p>"Have you?" said the sheriff. "Look here, my son, twelve pretty honest men
  looked over your case and figgered that you're guilty. Well, sir, because of
  that you ain't got a right to fight back. What the twelve say has to go for
  the law. Sometimes they make mistakes. From what I've seen, they make more
  mistakes turning guilty devils loose than they do sending up innocent men.
  But when they do make a mistake, we got to stick by it. It's hard on you, I
  admit. But it's better for the rest of us."</p>

  <p>"That's one way of looking at it," said I. "I don't see it your way. I've
  got a gun, and I intend to use it. If you corner me, I'll shoot five times to
  kill. I'll keep the sixth shot for myself."</p>

  <p>There was just a faint wrinkling of a smile at the corners of his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"When I was a kid, it was easy for me to talk hard, too," said he.</p>

  <p>It made me so proudly angry that I almost wished he would start the fight
  on the spot. But I went out from the house and sobered down when I found my
  horse. The gray had stood up to the first and second stages of the ride very
  well. But there was a good deal of fire missing from his eye, and I knew that
  if I pushed him too hard on this day, it would be the last real bit of work
  that I could get out of him.</p>

  <p>But in the meantime, I had exactly one hour to take advantage of my head
  start!</p>

  <p>I clapped a saddle on the gray, bridled him, and jogged out into the
  valley. The country was rough, but just about one per cent as terrible as it
  had looked to me in the storm of the night before. As I looked at the
  crevices, the tumbled stones as big as houses, the thickets and tangles of
  trees, the twisting ravines, and the big mountains, I decided that it would
  not be so hard to hide a whole regiment here, let alone one man.</p>

  <p>I timed myself by the watch. I rode straight for half an hour without
  trying to make any trail problems for the sheriff to solve. Then I intended
  to devote the rest of the hour to getting into a good hiding place.</p>

  <p>I reached a stretch of hard rocks, then, and turned the gray onto them.
  What marks he made with his shoes would be hard reading on fresh-faced
  granite, I thought. At least, it was a trail which I should not have cared to
  try to decipher.</p>

  <p>Still on those rocks, I turned into the mouth of a ravine and then worked
  my way to a natural covert among the rocks. There I tethered the gelding and
  sat down to wait. I waited a full hour. Then I found myself blinking my eyes
  and glaring in astonishment, for there came the sheriff riding, with his men
  behind him&mdash;three big men on three big horses, stepping lightly among
  the rocks, with the sheriff swung far down from his saddle to read the
  trail!</p>

  <p>They had solved my little trail problem almost as swiftly as I had made
  it. I cursed them in my heart for men with eagle eyes. I looked around me for
  a way to get out, but there was none. I was backed up against the wall of the
  cliff, and to escape I had to ride out full in their view.</p>

  <p>I threw myself on the back of the gelding and charged down at them
  desperately. They were in easy revolver distance&mdash;which means very
  point-blank range. They saw me the instant I shot into view, and three guns
  chimed like one. The poor gelding tossed its head and pitched to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>I had only time to touch my feet from the stirrups, and then I opened
  fire. They had not remained in the saddle. They had taken to their heels
  after their very first discharge brought me down, and now they were running
  for cover, firing toward me at random as they ran.</p>

  <p>It would be a very pleasant thing if I could tell you how I shuddered and
  shrank from the thing which lay before me. As a matter of fact, I didn't
  shudder or shrink at all. I simply said to myself: "There are three men
  trying to kill me, or capture me and give me what is worse than death. I'm
  going to nail them all or die trying!"</p>

  <p>I thought that while I was rushing my horse out of my rocky covert. My
  first bullet was on the wing before the body of the brave gray was more than
  settled on the ground. It caught one of the sheriff's friends in the leg and
  dropped him on his face. My second shot was better aimed. It struck the big
  man who was just dropping into cover behind a rock, so that he threw out his
  arms and rolled out into full view of me. There he lay writhing.</p>

  <p>I steadied my gun for a third shot.</p>

  <p>I thank the Lord that I couldn't shoot, however; even with the cracking of
  the sheriff's revolver to urge me on. He was shooting very straight, but I
  was in such a position that he could not see me clearly. I tied a white
  handkerchief on the end of a stick and held it up&mdash;a bullet chopped that
  handkerchief in two and left only a ragged tuft of cloth wagging at the end
  of the stick.</p>

  <p>Then I heard the sheriff yelling: "D'you give up? You yaller-bellied young
  swine!"</p>

  <p>That was enough to make any man fight, and I shouted back at him: "They
  haven't the sort of men in these mountains that can make me give up. But both
  your men are down in plain sight of me. Do you want them murdered?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence, during which I suppose the sheriff
  maneuvered behind his rock until he could catch a glimpse of his two
  companions. What he saw made him yell back:</p>

  <p>"You'll hang for this! But is there a truce?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said I, "If I go clean free."</p>

  <p>"Go free and be darned," said the sheriff, and then he was rash enough, or
  humane enough, to jump from behind his shelter and rush for his fallen
  friends.</p>

  <p>I should have gone to help him care for them if I had been a true hero of
  romance. But I was not a true hero. I was simply a badly scared
  eighteen-year-old. I took the saddle and bridle and pack from my dead horse.
  Then I carried them over to the sheriff. He was paying no attention to the
  fellow who had been wounded in the thigh. But he was kneeling beside the
  other man, ripping his shirt off.</p>

  <p>I did not offer to help. Neither did I feel any horror when I saw the
  blood. I looked into the drawn, pain-stricken face of that unlucky fellow and
  rolled a cigarette! It was callous, of course, but I had just come off with
  my own life by the grace of good fortune.</p>

  <p>However, there was something about the look of him that told me he would
  not die.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to help?" I asked Lawton.</p>

  <p>"You get the devil out of here," said the sheriff. "I've seen too much of
  you, already."</p>

  <p>"I'm shy a horse," said I.</p>

  <p>He jerked his head around and glared very angrily at me. "You've got the
  crust of a brass monkey," said Lawton. "Lemme hear what you want me to do
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"Give me a horse in exchange for the one that you killed."</p>

  <p>Lawton gave one more glance at the wounded man and then back at me.</p>

  <p>"That's sweet!" snarled he. "I fix up a crook so's he can get away?"</p>

  <p>"What else is there to do?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>He twitched his big body around so that he could turn his back on me.</p>

  <p>"I'll loan you any one of the three, if you'll ride back to town for a
  doctor," said he. "No," he added, as I started in, "don't take the
  black."</p>

  <p>The black was his own horse. I was to know more about the qualities of
  that black later on. But in the meantime, I concentrated on the other pair. I
  have already said that they were strong horses, quite up to carrying my
  weight even in the mountains. I selected a pale chestnut mare with a rather
  Roman nose and an ugly look in her eye, but with four sound-looking legs and
  room enough where the front cinch ran to promise plenty of bottom. I dragged
  off the saddle and bridle which were on her and put on my own instead.</p>

  <p>Then I mounted, and with her first step I knew that I had not changed my
  gray for a worse mount. The step of the mare was as light as drifting smoke.
  I have always thought that you can read a horse's enduring qualities and
  courage better by its walk than at any other gait. I like the rhythm of this
  nag's tread. I rode back to the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"He won't die," I said.</p>

  <p>But he did not return a word to me.</p>

  <p>So I turned the head of the mare out of the ravine, and when I got into
  the valley I tried her gallop. It carried me along like a song until I came
  to a little huddle of houses at a crossroads&mdash;a wretched, cold-looking
  little village. I dared to ride straight into it. First I went on my own
  account into the store.</p>

  <p>"Ain't that Jackson's hoss you got?" asked the fat old storekeeper.</p>

  <p>"He loaned him to me to come in for some chuck," said I.</p>

  <p>I bought some bacon and flour, some salt and sugar, some dried
  apples&mdash;and some ammunition for a Colt .45. Then I started out.</p>

  <p>"Kind of young to be workin' for Lawton, ain't you?" said the storekeeper,
  coming to the door to watch me mount.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I ain't so young," said I. "Besides, the sheriff will take a flier
  now and then."</p>

  <p>"Has there been no track of that young Porfilo that's said to of hit for
  the mountains up this way?" he broke off sharply, and, staring as though he
  saw my face for the first time: "Why" exclaimed the storekeeper, and then
  paused again.</p>

  <p>I knew that he had recognized me, but I also knew that he was not the sort
  of a man to pull a gun even at as young a criminal as myself. I merely waved
  to him and asked him where the doctor lived. He told me that the doctor's
  house was at the eastern end of the street, set back behind a row of firs. I
  found it as he described it. It looked like a funeral, to be sure!</p>

  <p>I put my mare at the fence, and she took it flying. Then I went winging up
  the path to the front door and fetched a kick at it that sent a crashing echo
  through the house. In a moment the door was whipped open and the doctor
  jumped out under the nose of my horse.</p>

  <p>"Who's dying?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The sheriff and Jackson are in trouble. Jackson has been shot through the
  body," I told him, and then I described where I had left the pair of them. He
  wanted me to wait and ride to the spot with him, but I told him that he
  couldn't miss it&mdash;which was true&mdash;and that I would hurry back ahead
  of him. I hurried the mare over the fence again, put her down the street at a
  canter, and was beginning to gather headway when I heard a yelling behind me,
  and then I saw two fellers coming up the street like madmen, with the hat
  blown off the head of one and the brain blown out of the head of them both, I
  suppose.</p>

  <p>It was red-eye, perhaps. Or perhaps they had simply heard the excited
  storekeeper speak of me and the calm manner in which I had dared to ride into
  their town. Such effrontery was an insult to every man in the village, of
  course. This pair decided that they would have to go after me. Perhaps
  neither of them would have had the courage, taken by himself. But a companion
  egged him on.</p>

  <p>They had their guns out already, and as they came around the corner,
  reeling far off and shooting a cloud of dust out to the side, they opened
  fire. They worked from the backs of running horses. Their bullets went
  wide&mdash;yes, very wide!</p>

  <p>I put my first bullet through the shoulder of the unlucky rascal who rode
  on the right. It must have been a frightfully painful wound. He twisted
  around in his saddle with a great scream of agony and pitched onto his face
  in the dust.</p>

  <p>That was enough for his friend, too. He had a good excuse to stop his
  charge at me&mdash;he had to go back and take care of his unlucky bunkie. So
  he twitched his cow pony around and went back to the fellow who was kicking
  and cursing in the thick dust.</p>

  <p>I went on up the valley.</p>

  <p>I remember feeling that I was lucky to have only wounded them. But I did
  not feel it had been any great deliverance. Sooner or later, I decided, they
  would corner me, and my promise to the sheriff would have to be lived up to.
  In the meantime, one might as well be hunted for the killing of twenty men as
  of one!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; IN HIDING</h2>

  <p class="first">By this time, I despaired of getting any headway toward a
  safe flight until I was better acquainted with that country. It was far too
  bewildering. I never could tell from what direction men might be riding
  toward me. I did not know which were blind trails and which were
  well-traveled ones. I did not know the difficulties of short cuts or the
  advantages of them. In fact, I knew nothing except that I was tossed down in
  a ragged ocean of mountains. In the meantime, I would have to get my bearings
  and establish some sort of a mental chart of my surroundings.</p>

  <p>There was sure to be a frightful stir. Such a man as Lawton, impatient and
  bold and strong and sure of himself, would go almost mad with the reflection
  that a youngster such as I had stopped him, shot down two of his men, and
  then bearded the villagers in his town a scant mile or two away!</p>

  <p>He would make enough trouble to occupy the attention of an army, to say
  nothing of the fuss that the men of the town might make, because I had had
  the impudence to go into their town in broad daylight.</p>

  <p>The fact was that I had had no intention of doing a dare-devil thing. Even
  after the sheriff had recognized me, I did not feel that every other man
  would be able to do so. I had felt quite secure during that adventure. But
  now I saw that I would be known instantly wherever I appeared.</p>

  <p>All of this was enough to make me decide to lie as low as possible for a
  time until, by quiet excursions here and there, I had mapped the country for
  myself. But where was I to hide?</p>

  <p>I had never forgotten how my father had hidden a book from me when he did
  not wish me to read it. He simply put it on a shelf in plain
  sight&mdash;except that the back was to the wall. I combed the house from top
  to bottom and hunted in every closet, through every old trunk in the attic,
  through every nook of the cellar. But it was six months before I found that
  volume&mdash;by purest accident.</p>

  <p>I decided that I should do the same thing with the sheriff. Wits I could
  not match against him. I felt that the coolest place for me would be on the
  very edge of the danger itself! So I went right back up the creek until I saw
  the peaked roof of his house to my left. Then I rode up a trail where the
  path came down to a ford, so that the prints of my horse would be lost in a
  tangle of other signs.</p>

  <p>In a hundred yards I dipped to the right into a thick wooded place. When I
  came to the first clearing I decided that this would have to be my home.
  There was forage here for my mare. I had my blankets and food. There was very
  little chance that they would comb the country so close to the house of the
  sheriff!</p>

  <p>The two dangers which I had to keep in mind were first, that the fire
  which was essential for cookery might be seen; second, that the mare might
  neigh if she heard another horse going down the trail. As for the mare, she
  was a sensitive, intelligent creature, and when she was startled by any sound
  in the woods, I could soothe her by speaking softly. She got so that she
  would come right up to me and nuzzle my hand like a dog.</p>

  <p>As for the fire, I did my cooking at night because by day the smoke was
  sure to be seen. At night, I built my fire among a nest of rocks which
  screened the light very effectually, and I worked with a small, low flame,
  always. It used to take me two hours to do my cookery every other day. For
  ten whole days I remained in this spot.</p>

  <p>In the afternoons I would venture up the face of the mountain which jumped
  at the sky right behind my covert. It looked over the rest of the lower
  mountains and the tangle of ravines and the little hollows and valleys which
  cut the face of the landscape. These I mapped in my mind as well as I could.
  Through the clear mountain air, I could look for limitless miles, and see far
  off the trails which twisted here and there.</p>

  <p>When I had studied until my mind was full, I would steal back to the
  clearing and draw a map as accurately as I could remember each detail, even
  down to the trails. The next day, I carried my map with me and corrected it.
  Each day I studied more, until I began to have a deep familiarity with the
  items of that wide spread of mountains.</p>

  <p>Only where peaks as lofty as my own went up from the general mass of
  roughness, there had to be blind spots in my knowledge. But I had a great
  mass of directions and localities and landmarks listed in due order.</p>

  <p>On the tenth afternoon, when I came back through the mist and color of the
  sunset time, I smelled cigarette smoke from my clearing, and I knew that my
  hiding place had been discovered.</p>

  <p>Of course I decided first to sneak away. But a second thought made me go
  on. I wanted to have a glance at the peculiar spy who, having found my
  rendezvous, had the folly to sit down and smoke at leisure in it! I wanted to
  see how many were in his party!</p>

  <p>I came along with the care of a hunting snake and not much more noise, I
  think. Finally, when I reached the edge of the clearing, I saw only one man.
  He had his back to a tree; the side of his face was turned toward me; his hat
  was in his lap, and I saw the most welcome sight I could have wished
  for&mdash;the gray hair and the alert features of my benefactor&mdash;Tex
  Cummins!</p>

  <p>"Tex!" said I, and stepped into the clearing.</p>

  <p>He jumped up and shook hands with me.</p>

  <p>"You're fixed up quite snug here," said he.</p>

  <p>It was wonderfully good to hear a human voice after ten days of silence.
  The first thing I wanted to know was: How had he found me?</p>

  <p>"Nothing mysterious about that," said Cummins. "When I heard that the
  sheriff had been working like a madman and had called out twenty of the best
  trail followers and sign readers in the mountains to help him, and when I
  found that he had worked for a whole week and hadn't come across a shadow or
  a trace of you, I decided that one of two things had happened.</p>

  <p>"Either you and your horse had dropped off a trail into one of the rivers,
  or else you were tucked away and lying close under cover. I couldn't figure
  on the first thing. I could figure on the second. The more I thought of you
  and remembered that you are a pretty crafty youngster and not simply a gun
  puller, I decided that you had probably put yourself away right under the
  nose of the sheriff himself.</p>

  <p>"I made his house the center, and I started cutting for signs from that
  spot. It has taken me two days. But here we are!"</p>

  <p>It made me like him better than ever. In my first meetings with this odd
  man, there had been an air of reserve about him, a touch of mystery,
  something cryptic and "smart" in his speech. But now he was as simple and
  familiar as the most unpretentious man in the world. I could not help smiling
  upon him. At that moment, I had a real affection for him.</p>

  <p>"This gives me a chance," said I, "to thank you for what you've done for
  me, Tex. I want to say"</p>

  <p>He waved my thanks into limbo. "Look here, kid," said he, "I got as much
  fun out of helping you as you got out of being helped. Maybe more! So the
  score is quit on that side of it."</p>

  <p>"Let the gratitude go, then," said I. "I owe you quite a bit of hard
  cash."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "I don't mind having a few bits of money owing to
  me. It makes me feel that I have an anchor to windward."</p>

  <p>He did not pause here, but went right on: "In the meantime, what are your
  schemes, youngster?"</p>

  <p>I remembered Mike O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"I have only one scheme," said I. "I want to go straight."</p>

  <p>Tex nodded at me. "I can tell you the one way to do it," said he.</p>

  <p>"Fire away!" cried I, feeling that the mystery was about to be solved for
  me by his wits.</p>

  <p>"Take your gun up and look it in the eye and pull the trigger," said my
  friend Tex Cummins. "Because the nearest place where you can go straight is
  heaven, my son!"</p>

  <p>It seemed very foolish for a youngster of my age to contradict a man as
  clever and as filled with experience as Tex Cummins. I simply said, after a
  moment when the shock had passed off a bit: "Well, I may look around and find
  a way."</p>

  <p>"Look around&mdash;sure," said Tex. "I wish you luck. I hope they don't
  fill you full of lead while you're looking. That's all. But tell me what you
  might have in your mind to do?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I don't know," said I, feeling that my brain was spinning under the
  contact of this direct argument. "There ought to be a way."</p>

  <p>"A man has to eat," said Tex, getting down to facts. "You admit that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"A man has to have company. You admit that?"</p>

  <p>I had a hasty impulse to say that I thought a man might get on very well
  in some sort of a way, living by himself. But I felt that a lonely honesty
  would be rather dull with nothing but an occasional mountain goat for an
  audience to one's integrity.</p>

  <p>"I admit that," said I at last.</p>

  <p>"Well, how'll you get it?" asked Tex. "How'll you get food and
  companionship without being nabbed by the other honest men who are living
  straight, too?"</p>

  <p>The very fact that he himself gave up the idea as an impractical one was
  about enough for me. Mike O'Rourke began to loom in my mind as a dear
  girl&mdash; but an excessively impractical one.</p>

  <p>"It has me beat," said I.</p>

  <p>"It has me beat, too," said Tex. "I tried to go straight. I tried it for
  years. I got jailed for something that I did in boyish ignorance, and I
  couldn't get my freedom although I broke away from jail because I was always
  recognized, as you will be.</p>

  <p>"But with you, it's a different case. I had broken jail accused of
  fighting. You have broken jail accused of murder! There's a difference. I
  didn't pull a gun during the whole course of my wanderings. You've shot down
  three men and reduced a sheriff to the edge of a nervous breakdown. You have
  a build and a face that can be snapshot in a few words:</p>

  <p>"'Eighteen years old, looks like a Mexican prize fighter, six feet two,
  weighs a hundred and ninety.'</p>

  <p>"That would hit you off. They have hit you off. They've plastered
  telegrams all over the mountains about you, and this little affair of Lawton
  and his trained man hunters has made everyone keen to get you; because the
  man that lands you now will make his reputation. They're going out in batches
  of three and four and trying their hands at amateur work. They've stacked up
  a twenty-five-hundred-dollar reward on your head!</p>

  <p>"Now, my boy, I'm not a fool, and you know it. When I was a kid, I was a
  sharp youngster. But with everything in my favor, I couldn't beat the
  game.</p>

  <p>"With everything against you, how can you expect to?"</p>

  <p>He was so direct and crisp that there was no avoiding the conclusions that
  he reached. I felt that he was right. I did have to live, and when my money
  gave out, I either had to work for money or steal money, so far as I could
  see. How could I work honestly for it?</p>

  <p>I told Tex that he was right, though it went against the grain to do it,
  and I was glad that Mike O'Rourke couldn't hear me say that. Tex nodded at
  me, and told me that I showed a bit of sense to agree with him.</p>

  <p>"What I came up here for," said he, "is to tell you that I think I can
  show you how to make money fast and easy. It's risky business, but you're the
  sort of a fellow who enjoys a risk."</p>

  <p>I told him that wasn't true. But he merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I've seen you fight with your fists," said he, "and I've heard how you
  fight with guns. How many kids at eighteen have killed their man and shot
  down four other men&mdash;each one a fighter?"</p>

  <p>He went on quietly. He was all the more persuasive because his voice was
  so quiet.</p>

  <p>"I saw it in you when I watched you fight Harry Chase. I saw that you were
  afraid of him, but I also saw that you were able to stand up and fight fast
  and hit hard in spite of your fear. In ten seconds, you were enjoying that
  fight. It was about the best fun you had ever had in your life. Isn't that
  true?"</p>

  <p>I had to nod at Tex Cummins.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Tex, "it would be very pleasant if I could tell you that
  the only reason I have tried to help you is because I liked you and wanted
  you to get out of trouble. That was partly the reason. The other truth is
  that I thought I might be able to use you, one of these days. Now I think
  that the time has come!"</p>

  <p>It was rather shocking, such frankness. But still I can't say that I
  didn't like him all the better for it, instead of hearing some sneaking,
  hypocritical excuses such as the way was well paved for.</p>

  <p>He said: "I'm what you might call an employment manager of crooks, Leon. I
  don't do the actual work myself. I leave that to my men who are scattered
  here and there through the mountains and the desert. My job is to plan big
  things. I find the bank that can be robbed and I find the watchman or the
  clerk that will take the bribe to start things going. I locate the express
  shipment of hard cash and find out what train it is coming on.</p>

  <p>"I get a whole lot of details that makes a whole lot of things possible,
  and then I make a split in the profits. The commission I take is a big split.
  I get half. But out of my half comes all the hush money that has been
  scattered along the line. You understand? Sometimes it costs a lot. I've
  actually pulled through a fifty-thousand-dollar job and found at the
  completion of it that I had lost a few hundred dollars after my twenty-five
  thousand was paid to me.</p>

  <p>"Still, it was profitable because it gave a couple of my men a handsome
  profit. Other times, I clear up thirty or forty per cent of my share as clear
  velvet. But I have to pay out big money all the time. I have to take trips
  through the mountains. I find some rancher on a small place who is barely
  making both ends meet. I size him up, and if he looks all right to me I say:
  'Suppose that a fellow should come along some day or night and say: "Partner,
  I need a fresh horse&mdash;or I need a meal&mdash;or I need a little
  cash&mdash;or I need some ammunition and a gun"&mdash;what would you do if he
  were to say: "Tex Cummins sent me?"'</p>

  <p>"As a rule, they simply stare at me. Then I reach into my wallet and take
  out something. It all depends upon what I think of the man and the strategic
  importance of his house. Sometimes I give him fifty dollars. Sometimes I give
  him twenty&mdash;and sometimes I give him a hundred. I have the mountains and
  the desert dotted with such houses, son."</p>

  <p>I could not help breaking in to ask him if he really wished to tell me so
  much about his private affairs. But he only smiled at me. He said that he
  hoped that this would be only the beginning of long business relations
  between us; and, in short, he told me that he was sure that I would make a
  successful life out of my career beyond the law.</p>

  <p>I give you his reasons exactly as he gave them to me. He told me that most
  criminals are of course unsuccessful, but that is because they are stupid and
  uneducated, as a rule, and because they often have vital moral
  weaknesses&mdash; they cannot resist liquor, drugs, and a thousand other
  vices.</p>

  <p>Above all, they have not the sense to associate themselves with other men
  who are trustworthy in their crimes, and the result is that the police are
  able to do most of their detective work by simply talking to the associates
  of suspected criminals. He went on from this to tell me that because I had
  been forced into a career of crime rather than made a deliberate choice of
  it, I had a thousand times greater chance of winning out.</p>

  <p>"When I offer this opening to you, I have gone into detail so that you
  will have nothing to reproach me with hereafter. If you don't like my
  proposition, or my share of the loot, or any other feature which you see in
  it, you may back out now. There will be no hard feelings on my part. Every
  man who works for me hears just what you are hearing, and those men rarely
  break with me, because they know that they have to depend on me in the first
  place for the locating of good 'plants,' and in the second place for the
  measures which make crime safe."</p>

  <p>I tried to tell him that it was not the safety or danger of crime to which
  I objected so much as crime itself; but he silenced me completely enough by
  telling me that I could take or leave his proposal exactly as I chose. He
  would not force me. After all, what was there for me to do? I felt that there
  was only one avenue open to me unless I wished to surrender myself to the
  police.</p>

  <p>So, in another five minutes, I was sitting in the dusk of the day
  listening to Tex Cummins as he outlined what my next steps were to be. He had
  selected the thing for me to do and the man with whom I was to do it. Before
  the dark was firmly settled over the mountains I was in the saddle. Into the
  empty saddle holster he thrust his own rifle. He gave me fifty dollars"in
  case anything went wrong"and he shook hands and wished me luck.</p>

  <p>I started away for my first deliberate violation of the law.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE SIGNAL</h2>

  <p class="first">My way held south, and at last was to pass down the valley
  near the house of O'Rourke. But the trip which had required five hours
  through rough going and in the teeth of a storm&mdash;five hours of
  agony&mdash;needed only two, now that I understood the lay of the land and
  had a mountain horse beneath me.</p>

  <p>I whistled the signal which we had agreed upon&mdash;two short blasts, a
  pause, and then a long trill. After that, I sat down cross-legged, with my
  back to a tree, and waited. For it was a warm night, with a south wind
  straggling up the ravine and touching me with a friendly hand. There is
  nothing so human as the touch of a soft wind in the dark of the night.</p>

  <p>Presently I saw a silhouette between me and the house. It was only for an
  instant, crossing the outline of one of the bright windows, but I thought
  that it was about the size of Mike. I repeated the signal softly. In another
  moment, she was standing before me.</p>

  <p>I said: "Sit down, Mike, and rest your feet; I'm tired, and I suppose
  you're tired, too."</p>

  <p>There was a flattened stump top just beside me, just a few inches above
  the top of the ground. Mike sat down on that.</p>

  <p>"I'm not tired out shooting up posses, though," said she.</p>

  <p>"You've heard about that?" I asked, with rather a thrill of
  gratification.</p>

  <p>But she only snorted, and remained silent for a time.</p>

  <p>"That's the way you're going straight?" said she.</p>

  <p>I tried to explain: "I rode till I was half dead with the cold that night,
  and I blundered into the first house where I saw a light"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know," said she impatiently. "The whole range knows all about it.
  Jackson did the talking. I suppose that Lawton wouldn't have said a word.
  Some of the thick heads want to fire Lawton, now, because he didn't capture a
  criminal&mdash;a murderer&mdash;when he had the man in his house!"</p>

  <p>She was so savage about it, that I was really afraid of her.</p>

  <p>"He's a fine fellow," I admitted. "I hope that he doesn't come to any
  trouble, because he treated me like a white man."</p>

  <p>She grunted again. I began to grow angry in turn.</p>

  <p>"I've come to pay back your twenty dollars," said I. I held out a bill
  toward her. She merely lighted a match and examined it. Then she blew the
  match out.</p>

  <p>"I don't take stolen money," said she.</p>

  <p>It was enough to make any one excited. I, being just eighteen years old,
  was boiling in an instant. I sat bolt upright and glared at her.</p>

  <p>"Who said that I stole it?" I cried to her.</p>

  <p>"Well, did you work for it?"</p>

  <p>"It was given to me," said I.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought of that," said Mike. "I hadn't thought that you might
  beg for what you needed!"</p>

  <p>"Confound it!" I shouted at her. "I didn't beg for it! It was given to
  me!"</p>

  <p>"For nothing?" said she.</p>

  <p>"An advance payment on&mdash;some&mdash;some work that I'm going to
  do."</p>

  <p>I could not help a slight faltering of my voice as I said this, and she
  leaped at my weakness instantly.</p>

  <p>"What sort of work?" snapped Mike.</p>

  <p>"Well, work is work. And it's none of your business," said I.</p>

  <p>"Crooked money is just as bad before you've worked for it as after you've
  worked for it," said Mike.</p>

  <p>I had one hearty wish, and I told her so. "I wish you were a man," said I
  through my teeth.</p>

  <p>"No you don't," said Mike with the most infernal assurance. "If I were a
  man, you'd be afraid of me."</p>

  <p>This impertinence made me see red. I could only gasp, and she immediately
  followed up her remark by asserting: "You're afraid of me even when I'm only
  a girl!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said I recovering a little, "I have brought back your twenty
  dollars to you, Miss O'Rourke. Now I'll be getting on."</p>

  <p>I held out the money, but she paid no attention to it. I folded it up and
  threw it into her lap. She brushed it away, and the breeze turned it slowly
  over and over on the ground like a dead leaf.</p>

  <p>"Take it or leave it," said I. "I've returned the money to you. It was
  good enough for me, and it's good enough for you. Good night!"</p>

  <p>I stepped to the mare, and I drew up the cinches with a wicked force that
  made the poor animal stagger and grunt. Then I jumped back at Mike and stood
  ominously over her.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the matter with you!" I cried. "Why do you treat me
  like a dog?"</p>

  <p>I expected a stinging return that would crumple me up. But instead, she
  replied in the gentlest voice you can imagine: "Leon Porfilo, you're so big,
  and so silly, and so funny, and so young&mdash;I could cry over you!"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens," said I, drawing myself up higher than before, "I hope that
  the time hasn't come when a little sawed-off sixteen-year-old kid can begin
  pitying me."</p>

  <p>I saw her start in the darkness. "Am I sawed-off?" gasped she.</p>

  <p>"The smallest I ever saw for your age," said I, rejoicing wickedly that I
  had found her weak spot.</p>

  <p>"That's not true," said she, in a voice that trembled with emotion.</p>

  <p>"Seventeen," said I, "and not even five feet tall!"</p>

  <p>"Leon Porfilo, you're telling a lie and you know it! I'm one inch more
  than five feet, and I'm only sixteen!"</p>

  <p>"Five feet tall with high heels"</p>

  <p>"I never wore high heels in my life!"</p>

  <p>"A sawed-off little runt," said I, "taking on airs! Talking big!"</p>

  <p>She jumped up in front of me. Then&mdash;I suppose because my bigness so
  near to her did make her seem small, she stepped back from me.</p>

  <p>"I'm growing every day," said Mike. "What's more, do you think that I ever
  want to grow up to be a great hulking lummox like you?"</p>

  <p>I felt that I had gained the upper hand, and so unexpectedly, so
  delightfully, by such small means, that I was able to laugh, loudly and
  long.</p>

  <p>All at once she flung away from me and started running toward the house as
  I had seen her run once before&mdash;as swiftly, as gracefully as any boy. It
  sent a tingle of excitement up my back and into my throat. Three bounds of my
  long legs put me up with her, and then I scooped her off the ground.</p>

  <p>She began to kick and struggle. It was perfectly useless. She struck at my
  face. I laughed louder than ever. I had formed such a huge respect for the
  youngster that it was astonishing to find her so small, so light.</p>

  <p>Then an odd choking sound turned into a burst of noisy weeping, like the
  crying of a child. It was such a wild paroxysm that she lay helpless against
  my breast, moaning when she could take half a breath:</p>

  <p>"If I could of&mdash;got to&mdash;the house&mdash;you'd
  never&mdash;never&mdash;have known! Let me go!"</p>

  <p>I carried her back under the trees. I felt immensely pleased with myself
  and not at all inclined to pity her because she was crying. I felt, in fact,
  absurdly as though I had snapped my fingers under the beard of a lion and
  frightened the great beast into a corner of his cage! I sat down on the stump
  and held Mike on my knee.</p>

  <p>It was really an astonishing thing to see the passion of her grief and
  anger. She cried with a stifled wailing&mdash;exactly like a child that is
  broken-hearted but afraid that it will be overheard. All the time she leaned
  against my shoulder and clung to me.</p>

  <p>At last the sobbing began to stop. Eventually it ended altogether. What
  did she say, as she slipped away from me?</p>

  <p>"I suppose I've made a perfect puddle on your shoulder, Leon?"</p>

  <p>She had, in fact. The tears had soaked through my coat.</p>

  <p>"How the devil was I to know that it would upset you like this?" I asked
  her rather mildly.</p>

  <p>But she could still see through me. "You're mightily pleased with yourself
  because you've made me cry, Leon Porfilo!"</p>

  <p>I declared that I was not, but it was perfectly useless to perjure myself
  about the matter. She merely sniffed and wiped away the last of her
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, in a voice of great relief, "it's a long time since I've
  made such a fool of myself as this. But it makes me feel a tremendous lot
  better. You've no idea!"</p>

  <p>She sighed, and then she added: "Ever bump your crazy bone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like that," said she. "When people mention my size, it's just
  like hitting your crazy bone. It makes me feel queer, and I cry like an
  idiot. But it's the last time you'll ever see a tear in my eye, Leon
  Porfilo&mdash;even if I'm not a great hippopotamus like you!"</p>

  <p>I declared that I was grieved to the heart because I had hurt her
  feelings.</p>

  <p>"You're not," said she. "You're tickled to death. You're disgusting the
  way you act, Leon Porfilo."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said I, "I didn't suppose that you had any
  feelings, by the way you talked."</p>

  <p>"How have I talked to you? I dare you to show me one thing!"</p>

  <p>"As if I were a ruffian."</p>

  <p>"Leon," said she, with a sigh, "I've been lying awake at
  night&mdash;swearing at myself because I cared enough about you to lie awake
  and worry. They've told us frightful things. They've told us that you must
  have been lost in trying to ford one of the rivers&mdash;because no green
  mountaineer could ever get away from a man like Lawton and his man hunters. I
  believed it, half. Now you come back to me with stolen money!"</p>

  <p>"Not stolen," said I.</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, "where did the man who gave it to you get it?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" I said feebly.</p>

  <p>I looked toward her miserably; and she looked toward me.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; STEVE LUCAS</h2>

  <p class="first">From Mike O'Rourke I traveled back to the main valley and
  rode on a good eight miles, until I had twisted out among the foothills
  beyond and saw in a hollow the scattered lights of a town. There was the end
  of my journey if I could find my man. However, the directions of my friend
  Tex Cummins seemed infallible.</p>

  <p>I located on the outskirts of the town, staggeringly supported between two
  trees, an old shack with a rusty length of stovepipe cocked over its roof. It
  was utterly dark, but I did as Cummins directed me to do. I went to the door
  and rapped in a particular manner which he had prescribed.</p>

  <p>I heard no approaching step, but presently a voice spoke close behind
  me:</p>

  <p>"Well, where did you drop from?"</p>

  <p>I turned and saw an armed man leaning against the trunk of a young
  aspen.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine thought that I could be put up here," said I.</p>

  <p>"What's his name?"</p>

  <p>"Tex Cummins," said I.</p>

  <p>At that, he came closer to me and scratched a match. He held it
  dexterously in the cup of his hands, so that the light flickered across my
  hands, leaving him in darkness blacker than before.</p>

  <p>"The devil," said he. "I didn't know that Tex knew anybody as young as
  this! What's your name?"</p>

  <p>I was not angered. There was too much fear in me&mdash;of the work that
  lay ahead&mdash;to allow much room for personal pride.</p>

  <p>"My name is Porfilo," said I. "What's yours?"</p>

  <p>"You're Porfilo, are you? Well, that sounds better. You're the one that
  passed up Lawton and his boys the other day, eh?"</p>

  <p>He shouldered past me and invited me to follow him into the house. There
  he lighted a lantern which he put on the floor and further screened with a
  heavy fold of newspaper. Not a great deal of light escaped, and what light
  there was filtered vaguely toward the ceiling. I had to guess at the face and
  the expression of my companion rather than see it clearly. He sat down on a
  broken box in the doorway, and most of the time his eyes were working
  restlessly down the slope toward the heart of the town; or sometimes he would
  rise abruptly and step to the back of the shack for a searching glance among
  the trees on that side of the shack. A caged tiger could not have been more
  alert.</p>

  <p>"You dropped a pair of Lawton's pets, I hear," said this man.</p>

  <p>"That was all that saved me," said I.</p>

  <p>"From what?" said he.</p>

  <p>"From Lawton. Lawton couldn't keep after me while I had two of his men
  helpless&mdash;able to bump them off at any time."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Lawton could have got you&mdash;when there was just the
  two of you left?" asked the stranger.</p>

  <p>"The chances would have been five to one against me," I admitted. "He's a
  much better shot, and he's a lot smarter."</p>

  <p>"By the heavens," said the other, "you're queer! Maybe it was just luck
  that you dropped the other pair? Maybe it was just luck that you put a slug
  through the shoulder of Dan Tucker?"</p>

  <p>Here he reached out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm Steve Lucas," said he. "Maybe Tex didn't tell you my name?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to know you. I'm glad that Tex has picked up a bird like you
  that'll be a help to all of us. The only trouble is, they've plastered
  descriptions of you everywhere, and it ain't so hard to recognize you by the
  description. You won't be able to show your face by day. You'll have to be
  living by night!"</p>

  <p>There was not a great deal of doubt of that.</p>

  <p>"However," I suggested, "I suppose most of the work is done at night?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all!" said he. "All the preparing, mostly, is done by the day.
  Speaking personal, I wouldn't follow no line of work that kept me up the
  night all the time. I ain't a sleeper. It's hard for me to get my rest even
  in the night. I can't bat an eye in the day after sunup!"</p>

  <p>It was not hard to believe him. He could not remain quiet for an instant,
  but was continually fidgeting from one side to the other and glancing first
  at me, then at the lantern, then swinging about to shoot a glance at the rear
  window, then whirling again to scan the slope which led down through the
  town. There was nothing peculiar about his appearance&mdash;only the
  occasional glint of a golden tooth as he talked.</p>

  <p>"I think that I can stand the night work," said I, "because I can sleep
  anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Can you? Can you?" sighed Steve Lucas. "Well, you're lucky. They've
  slapped a price on your head."</p>

  <p>He had changed the subject with a jarring suddenness, but I answered:</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five hundred."</p>

  <p>"Three thousand," said Mr. Lucas. "Three thousand even. Old man Castro
  brought in the coin this evening and put it in the bank to add to the reward.
  Three thousand dollars if they can nab you, Porfilo. Dead or alive! All that
  a gent has to do is to come up and sink a slug through the small of your
  back. That's the end.</p>

  <p>"He drags you to town and gets the reward. Three thousand ain't so
  bad&mdash;considering that all a gent would invest would be the price of a
  lead slug! Even Wall Street couldn't beat that game for profit!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" said I. "That makes me pretty comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Aw, the devil," said he. "They got worse than that stuck on me. Six
  thousand iron men&mdash;six thousand juicy berries is all the luck bird
  collects that sinks me! Six thousand spondulics to the sucker that plants a
  bit of poison in my soup!"</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They hung the Walton job on me. After I bumped off Rickets, they gave me
  a rise and put up a twenty-five-hundred-dollar reward for me. But then I went
  along for a long time with just that reward on me and nothing more. Folks had
  sort of forgot about me. Then 'Whitey' Nichols the cur, he talked when they
  caught him. He laid the whole of the killing of Walton onto me. They believed
  his yarn, and so that got them excited. Yes, sir, six thousand bones is all
  they value this baby at!"</p>

  <p>He seemed quite pleased with this dangerous honor. I told him that if he
  liked it, I wished they would transfer the three thousand from me to him,
  too.</p>

  <p>"Aw," said he, "cut out the kidding. You know as well as I do that you're
  tickled to death because you made a fool out of Sheriff Lawton. How many of
  us wouldn't take a chance of having our heads blowed off for the sake of a
  reward offered, if we could have the name of havin' made a fool out of
  Lawton?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't make a fool out of him," I insisted.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Have it your own way! Have it your own way! I
  don't give a tinker's darn what you think!"</p>

  <p>He remained silent for a time, smoking a cigarette in a jerky way and
  flashing uneasy side glances at me from time to time. I didn't like Mr.
  Lucas. There was nothing about him that I cared for.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he at last, in a better tone, "when they stacked the six
  thousand on my head, they made me!"</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"That was what brought me to the notice of Tex. Maybe that was what
  brought you to his eye."</p>

  <p>I shrank from that unsavory suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Since I went with Tex I've been making big money, for the first
  time."</p>

  <p>"I thought he got a pretty big cut," said I.</p>

  <p>"Sure. He gets his fifty. Which is pretty high. But then, he keeps you
  busy. And when you're broke, Tex will always float you through the shallows.
  He's white about that! What do you come in for on this job, kid?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You don't know!" cried Lucas.</p>

  <p>His ordinary voice was a sort of snarling whisper from the side of his
  mouth, and even when he exclaimed in this fashion there was more breath than
  sound. A sort of gasp.</p>

  <p>"I didn't talk terms with him," said I. "He'll treat me well enough."</p>

  <p>"All I know," said Lucas, "is that I get fifty. He can fix you up to suit
  himself, I suppose."</p>

  <p>I said nothing. I liked Mr. Lucas less and less with the passing of every
  moment.</p>

  <p>He fell into a dream.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we'll make quite a haul. They's been some big deposits lately, I
  guess. Otherwise Tex wouldn't be going after the bank right now."</p>

  <p>"A bank?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you even know that?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing. I'm to learn from you."</p>

  <p>He chuckled. "I'll show you plenty," said he. Then he added: "I guess that
  he wanted to break you in easy. This ain't much more than a one-man job. You
  know what I think?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"This here may be a twenty-thousand-dollar job, kid!"</p>

  <p>His voice trembled a little as he said it. He was as keen for money as a
  fox is for the blood of the goose.</p>

  <p>Presently he jumped up.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready, kid?"</p>

  <p>"I'm ready."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll start along. By the way the lights are going out, it looks as
  though most of those birds are roosting."</p>

  <p>The town was as quiet as we could have wished when we went down toward it.
  Like most small Western places, it was strung out long and narrow, grouped
  chiefly along the one main street. We rode around behind it and tethered our
  horses under the shadow of some cottonwoods near the bank of a creek.</p>

  <p>Lucas said: "This is straight behind the bank. When we've got the stuff,
  we can beat it straight back here and then ride across the creek. It's
  fordable here. I've looked over the whole place. I've spent a week fixing up
  everything. We can ford here&mdash;ride down between those two willows, and
  straight across. There's a deep place on each side, so be sure to ride
  straight. Then when we get across, there's clear sailing to the Custer house
  up yonder in the hills. Do you know Custer?"</p>

  <p>I said that I didn't. He told me that the only thing I would have to think
  about was to keep close to him.</p>

  <p>"That might be a good idea," said I, "but Tex Cummins told me that as soon
  as the job was done I had better take half of the stuff and leave you and
  ride straight back for him."</p>

  <p>He had started walking away from the horses. Now he stopped short and
  seemed about to speak, but he apparently changed his mind, and we went on
  together. Again a wave of dislike for Mr. Lucas swelled through me.</p>

  <p>We went through the back yard of a house, and a big dog came sneaking out
  and growled at us. Lucas threw it something which it gobbled at once, and
  then began to gag and moan.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" I whispered.</p>

  <p>"I had that dog in mind," chuckled Lucas. "It'll never growl at anybody
  else!"</p>

  <p>I knew that he had poisoned the poor beast.</p>

  <p>We crossed that yard and came out behind a low-built, thick-walled
  building of stone. I knew that it must be the bank. Lucas went up to the back
  entrance and took a key from his pocket which he fitted into the lock.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you get the key?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Cummins attends to little things like this," whispered Lucas.</p>

  <p>The lock turned with a well-oiled click, and the door opened. Inside,
  there was a whisper and stir of paper like a whisper and stir of human beings
  waiting for us in the black of the dark. But Lucas stepped boldly on and
  flashed an electric torch along the floor.</p>

  <p>So he guided me to the front of the building. He posted me at the big
  plate-glass window. The broad shade was drawn, but I could look out through
  a crevice and see the watchman pacing up and down.</p>

  <p>I sneaked back to Lucas and found that he had opened the door to the safe
  room and was kneeling in front of the safe. I touched his shoulder, and he
  turned with a frightened gasp.</p>

  <p>"There's a fellow walking up and down in front of the building," said I.
  "Make no noise or he'll be in at us!"</p>

  <p>"The devil, kid," said Lucas. "The watchman is fixed, if that's what you
  mean!"</p>

  <p>I went back to my place of lookout. Perhaps it was from the watchman,
  also, that the necessary keys had been secured. Altogether, this was reducing
  the dangers of robbery to the minimum, and I wondered how few hundreds had
  been needed to corrupt this man who paced up and down the walk in front.</p>

  <p>Once he stopped short just in front of me. Then he tapped on the window,
  and I tapped back. He made a reassuring gesture and went off to resume his
  beat.</p>

  <p>I cannot tell you what a wave of disgust and contempt for that man went
  through me. It was as though a watchdog should lick the hand of a stealthy
  murderer. My wave of disgust embraced Lucas, Tex Cummins, and myself.</p>

  <p>Robbery, on the face of it, had always seemed to me such a frightfully
  dangerous matter that I had always rather admired the talented and courageous
  criminals. But now that I could observe at first hand the treachery and the
  sneaking meanness which underlay this crime and, I had no doubt, most others
  of the same sort, it fairly turned my stomach.</p>

  <p>I had a savage desire to jump up and tell my companion, as he worked away
  on the safe, that I would have nothing more to do with this affair. But I
  controlled myself. I had committed myself too far to turn back at this point
  in the game.</p>

  <p>I heard the stealthy motions of Lucas&mdash;then there was the scratch of
  a match and a sudden fizzing sound. Lucas was suddenly at my side.</p>

  <p>"Flat on the floor, kid!" he said.</p>

  <p>I had barely time to obey when we heard a thick, stifled sound of thunder.
  No, it was rather like the exhalation of a gigantic breath that shook the
  building, rattled the glass, and seemed to make the very earth tremble.</p>

  <p>By the time I had risen to my feet, I could see Lucas by the light of his
  own torch yanking open the drawers of the interior of the safe&mdash;and
  outside, the street seemed to be sleeping as peaceful as before.</p>

  <p>No, yonder a light winked on in a window. Yonder, too, was the sound of a
  slammed door. Had some one come out to listen? Or were they coming to
  investigate?</p>

  <p>I slipped back to Lucas with this information. He did not hear me. He was
  throwing bundle after bundle of greenbacks into the yawning mouth of a
  sack.</p>

  <p>He talked in a chattering voice like a man with chills. "It's big! Oh,
  kid, it's big! We're made! We're fixed for life, I tell you!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly a hand began to beat on the front door of the bank. But Lucas was
  already prepared to leave, or nearly so. In another instant he had scooped up
  the last of the bundles and thrown it into his bulging sack. Then he sped
  back through the building as we had come.</p>

  <p>We darted through the rear door and flew across the open toward our horses
  at the same time that a chorus of voices began to rise. Then a crash told us
  that the door to the bank had been beaten in.</p>

  <p>We were already nearing the cottonwoods when half a dozen men, spilling
  around the back of the bank, sang out, "There they go!" and a gun
  cracked.</p>

  <p>"Send a couple of slugs that way and scatter the fools!" called Lucas.</p>

  <p>I whirled around obediently and fired three times into the air. I saw the
  pursuers scatter right and left. At the same time, I heard the crashing of a
  horse through shrubbery, and, turning my head, I saw two strange things. The
  first was that Mr. Lucas had rushed his horse out of sight through the
  undergrowth and trees toward the ford. The second was that my own chestnut
  mare was running loose with dangling reins!</p>

  <p>One does not need a translator to tell one what has happened in the mind
  of another man at such a time as this. I saw that the haul had been of such
  huge proportions that the slender honor of Lucas had buckled under the weight
  of it. I was to get nothing but the jail for my small share of this
  adventure. Truly it had been, as he had said, a one-man job.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the scoundrel had slashed the reins of my mare and chased
  her away with a wave of his hand. Yonder she galloped! Behind came the men of
  the town with a rush. Aye, there was the roar of the hoofs of half a dozen
  galloping horses turning out of the street of the village and swinging toward
  me across the fields.</p>

  <p>Nothing could have saved me, then, except the ten days which I had spent
  with that fine creature in the solitude of the clearing near the house of
  Lawton. For now, when she heard my voice, in spite of the uproar behind me,
  and in spite of the hornetlike singing of the bullets which a dozen guns were
  spitting at us, she wheeled around and literally swung back toward me with
  her beautiful long mane flying like smoke about her head.</p>

  <p>I went into that saddle like a leaping wild cat. I struck somehow, and I
  stuck somehow. I had her switched around and flying for the creek before I
  was in the saddle. As I gained the saddle and jammed my feet into the
  stirrups, I saw that I had rushed upon more trouble.</p>

  <p>Lucas had been right in one thing, at least. The creek was not fordable
  except at the spot between the two willows. It was not even approachable on
  either side of that spot. There the banks gave down easily on either side.
  But beyond that favored point, the banks were sheer walls. I had sent the
  mare forward, however, at such a sprinting gait that I could not check her
  now. Before me there was what seemed to me a frightful chasm of darkness. But
  I had no alternative. I drove the spurs in and raised her at that terrible
  chasm. She, like the great heart that she was, answered with a snort of
  effort and flung herself high and far.</p>

  <p>As we hung in the mid-leap, I was sure that we would crash down in the
  middle of the glinting water far beneath us, but she had a wonderful carry in
  her effort. We shot on, and her forefeet struck the solid level beyond. Only
  her back quarters crushed suddenly in behind me as the crumbling edge of the
  bank gave way beneath the shock of her weight.</p>

  <p>I threw myself out of the saddle and cast back my weight on the reins.</p>

  <p>It was enough. With that anchoring weight tugging at her head, scrambling
  like a cat, she came to her feet. I had the ends of the broken reins in my
  hand in an instant, and off we went.</p>

  <p>I did not flee straightway, because the pursuit was coming up on wings.
  Instead, I bore to the right, and effectually put a screen of shadowy trees
  between me and the rifles.</p>

  <p>But this maneuver had given me an immense gain in time. The horsemen
  rushed first at the point where I had attempted to leap
  across&mdash;convinced, no doubt, that they would find my horse and me
  struggling in the waters.</p>

  <p>When they found that they were wrong and that I had escaped by a miracle,
  they had to ride up to the ford, go down to the stream, walk their horses
  slowly among the stretch of rapid current and dangerous rocks, climb up the
  steep, slippery slope beyond, and all this before they could begin to ride at
  speed.</p>

  <p>By that time, when I turned my head as I galloped and looked back, I saw a
  barely perceptible line of shadows break away from the low wall of trees over
  the creek. I had a pretty thorough conviction that no horse in the world
  could catch up with the chestnut once she had such a flying start.</p>

  <p>I let her fly. Just as dim before me as the pursuit was behind, I saw the
  form of Lucas. The rascal was well mounted, but there was such a vast rage in
  me that I think I could have made my horse overtake a veritable eagle. Let no
  man tell me that the rider cannot transform his mount! The mare that night
  was inspired, and it was my transcending passion which lifted her to the
  heights.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; CORNERING THE RAT</h2>

  <p class="first">At last I ranged beside Lucas.</p>

  <p>"All right, kid," said he. "When I saw the mare rear back and break the
  reins, I thought you were done for. There wasn't no good in me staying to get
  caught, too. So I came along."</p>

  <p>I said nothing. I could not have spoken. Something in the ratlike
  furtiveness with which he jerked his head toward me made me see that he
  meditated something more than pleasant words.</p>

  <p>I ran my thumb over the ends of the reins and made sure, by the glossy
  smoothness of the leather, that a knife had done the work. No break can
  possibly take place, of course, without leaving ragged edges.</p>

  <p>I decided that it might not be a bad idea to give him a bit of
  warning.</p>

  <p>I said: "I'm keeping an eye on you, Lucas. If you make a queer move, I'll
  shoot you through the head."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lucas said not a word in reply. He merely busied himself with the work
  of getting his horse along as fast as possible. I reined the chestnut half a
  stride behind him&mdash;with my gun always ready&mdash;my nerves steady as
  iron, and my heart as cold as ice with fury.</p>

  <p>That sprint across the level seemed to take the heart out of the pursuit.
  They had lost the sight of me, and when Lucas swung his horse to the right
  and galloped away to the north behind the screening hills, there was not one
  chance in a thousand that they would be able to pick up the trail.</p>

  <p>Lucas seemed to realize it fully as well as I did. He did not maintain
  that killing pace for another mile, but checked his gelding to an easy jog
  trot.</p>

  <p>Through all the hours that remained of that night we never stopped our
  journeying. Sometimes the horses walked. Sometimes they trotted. Now and
  again we let them roll forward in a canter.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, I was thinking hard and fast. Back in my mind the hatred
  of Lucas was as fixed as ever. But I could suppress it enough to make other
  conclusions for myself.</p>

  <p>A bank was no impersonal thing which could afford to give up a huge sum of
  cash. My own small fortune was in a bank. Suppose that a pair of rascals like
  Lucas and myself were to gut the vault of that bank in Mendez? Then if the
  bank failed&mdash;as it unquestionably would&mdash;where would my fortune be?
  But that was not all. I was a single man. I could bear the loss. What of the
  sick and the poor whose small savings were pooled in banks? What of the small
  ranchers by the score who doubtless depended on their loans from that same
  bank to carry them through the lean winter season?</p>

  <p>We were drifting toward the region of Lawton's home, and it was the
  nearness to that place that put the first idea into my head.</p>

  <p>Now Lucas stopped, dismounted, and kindled a small fire.</p>

  <p>"Sit down with me, kid," said he.</p>

  <p>I slipped from the saddle. The good mare followed me and stood over me. On
  one side of the fire was Lucas. On the other was I, and between us the
  wind-harried flames leaped and were flattened, and tossed into struggling
  waves. Lucas dumped the contents of the sack upon the ground and counted the
  bills in each package one by one&mdash;each package secured by a wrapper of
  stiff brown paper.</p>

  <p>The first two packets were one-dollar bills, and he cursed heavily as he
  counted thema hundred dollars in each. Then came a wad of hundreds.
  Twenty-five hundred in that little batch! Some fifties were next&mdash;and
  then a hoarse cry from Lucas. He had struck a pack of thousand-dollar
  bills!</p>

  <p>I listened to his chanting, drunken voice in a daze while the sum mounted
  to twenty thousand, to thirty.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand dollars!" screamed Lucas. "And we ain't a third of the way
  through!"</p>

  <p>No, we were hardly a quarter of the way through the pile. For when that
  count ended, Mr. Steve Lucas had cried out: "A hundred and eighty-nine
  thousand dollars! Oh, kid, we're made! Do we take this to Tex? What right has
  he got to it? Didn't we turn the trick? Didn't we? We split this half and
  half&mdash;and then we beat it! Am I right?"</p>

  <p>He licked his thin lips, and then looked at me with a gaping grin.</p>

  <p>Then the hate in me turned into words. I stood up and said: "I've thought
  it all over and decided where we're going with that coin. We're going to go
  to the house of Lawton. You understand? We're going to go there, and when we
  get there, I'm going to leave you and the coin in his hands!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of Lucas widened as though he had seen a nightmare.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean that?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I mean it. You tried to double cross me a while back&mdash;outside the
  bank."</p>

  <p>"You're off your nut. What would Cummins do? He'd never stop till he
  snagged you!"</p>

  <p>"To the devil with Cummins and you and the rest of the slimy crooks!" I
  said to Lucas. "Get up and get on your horse. Or else grab your gun."</p>

  <p>I wanted him to take his gun. There was nothing in the world that I wanted
  so much, for I had an inborn surety that I would kill this rat of a man if it
  came to a fight. He seemed to know it, too. He looked at me through another
  white-faced moment. Then he stood up without a word and went to his
  gelding.</p>

  <p>He had his left hand raised to the pommel of his saddle and his left foot
  in the stirrup&mdash;certainly a seemingly helpless situation&mdash;when he
  made his play. He flung himself back against the neck and shoulder of his
  horse and, snatching out his revolver as he whirled, he fired point-blank at
  me.</p>

  <p>His own swinging weight beat him. The shock of his body against the
  gelding made the horse stagger a little, and that stagger threw the bullet
  wide. I had snapped out my own gun and fired a split part of a second after
  him, and Lucas dropped to the ground with a scream. There he lay writhing and
  twisting and sobbing and shrieking with agony.</p>

  <p>I could hardly uncurl his body to see what damage my bullet had done, and
  then I saw that he was frightfully wounded indeed! The slug had torn through
  both forearms. It had ripped through his right arm and then, flying up, it
  had smashed the wrist bones on his left hand against the steel pommel of his
  saddle.</p>

  <p>While he lay there damning me, inviting my soul to the most furious deeps
  of hell, I made as good a bandage as I could and took a hard twist around
  each arm halfway between elbow and wrist. That turned his arms numb and
  stopped the bleeding. Then I took him in my arms and slung him into his
  saddle.</p>

  <p>He sat there crying like a child with the unspeakable agony of those
  wounds. Then I took the reins of his horse, mounted my chestnut mare, and led
  him on.</p>

  <p>We were half a mile from the house of the sheriff when he began to beg,
  and the rest of that ride was the most grueling experience in my life. I had
  to listen to that poor devil tell me that I was taking him to his
  death&mdash;that they would be sure to hang him&mdash;that I had ruined him
  already with my bullet, and that that was punishment enough.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was, but there was a cruel devil in my heart that night. The
  shock of seeing my mare running loose with dangling reins while the townsmen
  rushed at me across the field had not left me. It had not left me to this
  moment. I cannot honestly say that I have the slightest regard for the manner
  in which I treated the yegg.</p>

  <p>Just before the house of Lawton he threw himself out of the saddle. He
  swore that he would lie there, but I merely paused to tie the horse to a
  tree. Then I threw him over my shoulder like a sack of wheat and walked on,
  carrying the bag of money in my other hand.</p>

  <p>When I came to the front door of Lawton's house, I found it unlocked. I
  suppose it never had come into the brain of that brave and famous fighter
  that any criminal would dare to invade his very premises! I walked through
  the big living room and past the dining table and kicked open the door to his
  room. That noise and the groaning of my prisoner, which began again at that
  moment, brought the form of Lawton leaping out of his bed.</p>

  <p>"It's Leon Porfilo," I called to him, "and I've brought you a
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>I added: "I've got my gun ready, Lawton, and I've got you covered. If
  you'll promise to listen to me talk and let me go safe out of your house,
  we'll do business."</p>

  <p>He answered me with a torrent of curses; then a bit of silence.</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to you, the devil take your hide!" said Lawton. "Wait till I
  light that lamp."</p>

  <p>He came out half dressed and lighted the lamp in the living room while I
  lowered my man into a chair. Lawton gave him one glance and then grinned like
  a bull terrier seeing trouble ahead.</p>

  <p>"My old friend Lucas!" chuckled the sheriff. "Welcome home, son!"</p>

  <p>Lucas, seeing the gallows before him, shrank into his chair and forgot the
  pain of his wounds.</p>

  <p>First of all we washed and dressed his arms. Then Lawton locked him in the
  next room at my request. There was no danger of him attempting to escape.
  Those shattered arms and hands could not have so much as turned the knob of a
  door.</p>

  <p>After that we sat down in the living room, and the sheriff regarded me
  with a calm wonder, if I can use such a word.</p>

  <p>"I've seen queer ones, kid," said he, "but I'm darned if I ever seen the
  equal of you. What d'you mean by bringing in that rat? You and him joined
  company and then had a fight?"</p>

  <p>"Are you glad to have him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He's better'n a Christmas cake to me," grinned the sheriff. "What's in
  that sack?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred and eighty-nine thousand dollars," said I.</p>

  <p>I could not help smiling as the sheriff slumped into a chair and gaped at
  me.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lawton at last, "lemme see the inside of it."</p>

  <p>I tossed the sack toward him. The bottom of it struck the floor and
  spilled about the feet of Lawton a tide of wealth. He fairly turned white at
  the thought of so much money.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"From the Crockett National Bank," said I.</p>

  <p>"I'm gonna go nutty in another minute," said the sheriff. "What does it
  mean, kid?"</p>

  <p>"It means that I started to go wrong," said I, "and that I don't like the
  inside lining of that sort of a life. We got this loot, and we started away.
  Now here it is back again. That's clear, I guess?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff pushed the money reverently back into the sack. "Kid," said
  he, "I got nothin' to say. Except&mdash;what are you?"</p>

  <p>"A gent that's trying to go straight," said I. "Here's my first payment.
  Will it go?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," sighed the sheriff. "I've worked for twenty years grabbing
  crooks and talking to 'em after they was grabbed. But I never met none of
  them like you! Tell me what you want me to do, and tell me in words of one
  syllable, because I can't understand nothing special hard right now."</p>

  <p>I did as he had asked. I told him that I had brought in Lucas because I
  had seen, during my ride, exactly what a bank robbery might mean to a
  thousand poor people.</p>

  <p>Besides, I did not like the dirty ways in which crooked money was made. I
  told him, also, of the way in which Lucas had tried to double cross me in my
  time of greatest peril, and how I had managed to overtake him.</p>

  <p>To all of this the sheriff listened with the greatest attention. The shock
  of surprise was diminishing, and he was able to follow all that I had to say
  with a shrewd attention.</p>

  <p>"The main point that I see right now," said Lawton, as I finished, "is
  that you are square, kid! Besides, I ain't forgot that after you dropped my
  two pals the other day, you risked your neck to ride into town and send out
  the doctor. It saved the life of Jackson. There ain't any doubt that another
  ten minutes without a doctor's help would have been the end of him. But, son,
  even if I know you're square, what can be done about it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said I wretchedly.</p>

  <p>"The point is," said he, "that no matter what you and I know, other folks
  don't see nothing except that you been condemned to prison for a murder, that
  you've broke jail, and that you've shot three men since&mdash;to say nothin'
  of this here rat, Lucas. We throw him in for velvet, you might say! What can
  be done for you?"</p>

  <p>"I've got to have money if I'm going to live," said I.</p>

  <p>"In a small way, I could give you a hand&mdash;when I ain't hunting you
  down!" He sighed and shook his head, very much perplexed.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea of a manner in which I can make plenty of money from time
  to time," said I.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "lemme hear you tell the way."</p>

  <p>He defied me with his eyes to solve such an impossible situation.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you simply enough. There is a great deal of money in these
  mountains that is not in the pockets of honest men."</p>

  <p>"You mean it's in the pockets of the crooks? Yes, I know that. I'd need a
  thousand deputies&mdash;and real men, every one of 'em&mdash;to keep these
  here mountains combed clean. A man can hide ten times in every quarter mile.
  Where did you hide, kid?"</p>

  <p>"A quarter of a mile from your house," said I.</p>

  <p>He threw up his hands with a groan of despair.</p>

  <p>"I might of knowed that," moaned Sheriff Lawton. "Well, go and tell me how
  you can make an honest living while you're an outlawed man with a face that's
  as well known as if it was the map of the United States?"</p>

  <p>"There's no good reason why I shouldn't hunt down a few of the crooks,
  from time to time," said I. "They have money. Here's my first job, which
  isn't so bad. There's six thousand dollars' reward for the capture of Lucas.
  That money comes to me."</p>

  <p>"How are you gonna be able to claim it without steppin' yourself into a
  jail?"</p>

  <p>"You'll claim it for me, and I'll claim it from you."</p>

  <p>"Cool," said the sheriff. "Always cool. Enough brass to fit up a stamp
  mill. I'm gonna claim that reward and then pay it over to you?"</p>

  <p>"You are," said I.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Lord," sighed the sheriff, "I suppose that I shall. How come I'm
  always your handy tool, Porfilo?"</p>

  <p>"Because we need one another," said I.</p>

  <p>"It's the first rim of the day stickin' over the hills yonder," said my
  friend Lawton. "If you're seen sneakin' around my house, I'm a ruined man and
  you're a lost man. Get out of here. Come back in a week. Tap at my window,
  and I'll pass your money out of the window to you. But after that, kid, I'm
  after you on your trail again. You understand?"</p>

  <p>I understood clearly enough, and I left the house at once. I gathered from
  the sheriff that during the next week he would allow me a truce. So I spent
  the next day and the next night resting in my old clearing near his
  house.</p>

  <p>After that, I dropped across the mountains on the chestnut and reached a
  little crossroads town at the junction of two big ravines. I got hold of a
  newspaper.</p>

  <p>According to the paper, there was no doubt about Lucas' guilt. Perhaps it
  was the effect of the wounds which he bore from that fatal snapshot which I
  took at him with my revolver. At any rate, a little grilling from the sheriff
  had brought out a full confession from the poor sinner. In that confession,
  he admitted a career of crime which sickened me to read, and which I cannot
  repeat without loathing.</p>

  <p>I was rather astonished to see that Sheriff Lawton had put down the facts
  in black and white. He began with a peroration which was typical of him,
  though I suppose that the reporter or editor had altered the grammar quite a
  little to the better.</p>

  <p>What he began with was a naked statement of how he had first met me, how
  he had turned me loose from his house on account of his feeling that the
  spirit of Western hospitality is a sacred thing, and how he had pursued and
  failed to capture me.</p>

  <p>He went on to tell how I had gone to town and sent the doctor back to the
  wounded men at sufficient risk to bring a fight on my shoulders before I was
  clear of the village. Then he told how I had come to him and brought the
  person of Steve Lucas, whose confession to many black and startling crimes
  was added in another part of the paper.</p>

  <p>After that he shocked me by repeating exactly what I had said to
  him&mdash; that I expected the six thousand dollars' reward; for which I was
  repaying to the right owners the fifth part of a million dollars which had
  been taken from the bank at Crockett. Furthermore, I expected the sheriff to
  claim that money and to receive it from him. Beyond all this, he intended to
  give me that money before he started on my trail again, and he ended with a
  frank appeal to any voter in the country to impeach his conduct and his
  intentions and to criticize him if it was felt that he deserved
  criticism.</p>

  <p>As for the criticism, I felt that perhaps the newspaper editorial summed
  up the possibilities fairly well. That editor was a born Westerner, and he
  declared in unhesitating language that the duty of hospitality impinged upon
  the officer of the law as much as upon any other human being. The sheriff,
  declared the editor, had done no more than right, and in promising me the six
  thousand dollars, he had made at least a fair exchange for a hundred and
  eighty-nine thousand.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; TWO ENEMIES</h2>

  <p class="first">I was at the sheriff's window at the appointed time, and in
  answer to my knock, the sheriff thrust out his head almost at once.</p>

  <p>He seemed in the highest of good humor.</p>

  <p>"Porfilo," said he, "this here thing has come off in fine shape. Folks
  feel so dog-gone good toward you that I'm afraid I'd be lynched if I got you
  by shooting. They seem to figger that you've been partly unlucky and partly
  young&mdash;but that you mean right. Maybe you got more friends out of this
  fracas than you'd ever imagine. I've heard from the bank at Crockett. That
  bank went bust, my son, as maybe you heard?"</p>

  <p>I told him that I had not heard.</p>

  <p>He began to laugh. I have never heard a man so pleased with himself as the
  sheriff was on this night.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I'll say that that bank was sort of mildly pleased with the
  world when it heard that you was returning all that money. I've had the
  president of the bank up here. All he could say was that he wanted to have a
  chance to meet you and shake hands with you. When I told him that I couldn't
  manage that, he said that he would send along a little messenger to talk to
  you in his place. Here's the messenger. Open it, kid, and read it aloud."</p>

  <p>He handed me the letter and held up a lantern at the same time. I opened
  that letter and took out five one-thousand-dollar bills. The letter
  read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Porfilo:</span></p>

  <p class="letter">We have received, in a complete accounting, all of the
  money to the last penny that was stolen from the Crockett Bank. I have called
  a meeting of the directors, and it is their opinion that something should be
  done to reward the extraordinary conduct which has returned such a vast sum
  of money to our vault. The more extraordinary, I may say, because we realize
  that this money is sent in by a man whose life is already endangered by a
  criminal judgment against him, so that it might be taken for granted that he
  would have ventured any crime in addition to that which is charged against
  him.</p>

  <p class="letter">We have felt that your action is inspired by a real feeling
  both for the bank and for the numbers of unlucky depositors who would have
  been bankrupted by this great loss.</p>

  <p class="letter">Accordingly, we have decided to send you a small token of
  our regard in the form of the contents which are enclosed with this letter.
  We beg you to accept them, and assure you that we wish our finances were at
  the present moment in such a state that we could make a larger reward.</p>

  <p class="letter">In conclusion, after conversation with Mr. Lawton, it is
  our opinion that you cannot really be guilty of all the charges which are
  brought against you, and we beg to express to you our sympathy in your
  unlucky condition and ask you to call upon us still further should a time of
  need come upon you.</p>

  <p class="letter">With many good wishes to you, we remain,</p>

  <p class="letter">Cordially yours, <span class="smcap">Samuel J.
  Crockett</span>,<br>
  for the Directors of the Crockett Bank.</p><br>

  <p>I read this dignified epistle several times through before all the meaning
  of it was digested by my befogged brain. Then I handed back the money to the
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Lawton," I said to him, "I helped to take that money out of their vault
  and I don't deserve a reward for giving it back to them. But with their
  permission I'd like to take one thousand of the money they've offered me.</p>

  <p>"I want to pay Jackson five hundred dollars for his horse, which I'm still
  riding. I want the other five hundred to go to pay his doctor bills and pay
  him, too, for all the time that he's laid up."</p>

  <p>Lawton took the money with a grunt. "This is all queer," said he. "I think
  I'm gonna wake up and find that I've been readin' a fairy story. Now, kid,
  will you lemme give you some good advice? While all the folks are bustin'
  themselves with good things to say about you, I suggest that you give
  yourself up. I'll lay a dollar to a doughnut that inside of a week the
  governor will come through with a pardon for you. He'd be a fool if he
  didn't. It would bring him in twenty thousand extra votes at the next
  election!"</p>

  <p>It was a tempting offer, of course. But when I reflected that the sheriff
  might be wrong, and what the alternative was for me in case he was in error,
  I could only shudder and shake my head.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it, Lawton," I told him.</p>

  <p>He sighed with a great relief. "Thank heavens for that," said he. "Then
  I'm gonna still get my chance at you in the open."</p>

  <p>"You're going to get your chance at me."</p>

  <p>"I'll nail you, son!" said he through his teeth. "You've made a fool of me
  once. You'll never make a fool of me again!"</p>

  <p>I went away from Lawton's house with a strange feeling about him and about
  the world in general. There was no doubt that I had been wrong in my first
  conclusion. The world was not filled with selfish villains. There was plenty
  of good feeling and kindness and mercy everywhere. But could I trust to the
  clemency of the cold mind of a judge or of a governor to stand between me and
  half a lifetime of prison? I decided that I could not. No doubt I was
  foolish, but I ask you to remember, again, that I was only eighteen.</p>

  <p>I went back to my Roman-nosed chestnut mare and rode her away to the south
  and the east down a trail with which I was familiar now. It carried me over a
  ridge and into a broad, pleasant valley, and down that valley until I turned
  into a narrow ravine, filled with shadows so thick that the light of the
  stars hardly could enter.</p>

  <p>There I gave my signal according to the old agreement, and presently, at
  that place, I saw the shadowy form run out from the house toward me.</p>

  <p>It was Mike, of course.</p>

  <p>"Leon Porfilo!" called she from the distance.</p>

  <p>I answered her with a cautious halloo. Then she was up with me and
  wringing my hand in both of hers.</p>

  <p>"You are going straight?" cried Mike.</p>

  <p>"I am," said I. "You bought twenty dollars' worth of stock in me, and that
  twenty dollars sort of outweighs the rest of me. I want to be crooked, Mike,
  but your share in me won't let me go wrong."</p>

  <p>How she laughed, with her head thrown back.</p>

  <p>"No one in the world guessed it," said she. "But what a lot of talk you've
  made! What a lot of things you've done&mdash;and all fine, Leon, since I saw
  you last!"</p>

  <p>"And made a great enemy," said I.</p>

  <p>"Bah," said she. "What enemy matters to a man like you?"</p>

  <p>"I had one already. Two are too much," said I.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" said she.</p>

  <p>"One is Andrew Chase," said I.</p>

  <p>"Of course I've heard about him," said Mike. "But what's he? He's only a
  man. Who's the other one?"</p>

  <p>"Tex Cummins," said I.</p>

  <p>At this, she shrank suddenly away from me, and she looked up at me with a
  gasp of horror.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Leon," moaned Mike. "Do you mean that he's against you?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said I. "Does that make such a difference to you?"</p>

  <p>For she was backing away from me. "Such a difference," said Mike, "that
  the best I can hope for you is that I'll never see you again!"</p>

  <p>She turned back toward the house of her father.</p>

  <p>I stood petrified and tried to make it out, but it defied analysis. I
  could only know two things. The first was that I could never follow the life
  of a law-breaker again. The second was that my first act of resolute honesty
  had alienated Mr. Texas Cummins, and with him I realized that I had lost the
  girl I loved.</p>

  <p>Yet, no matter what mysteriously strong influence he might have over her,
  I knew that the victory was mine and that it was far better, at all costs, to
  go straight.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; ANDREW STARTS OUT</h2>

  <p class="first">It was Father McGuire who started Andrew on his search for
  me. They met on the road, and it was Andrew Chase who stopped to speak to the
  priest.</p>

  <p>"You have not been particularly cordial to me since there was that unlucky
  affair of poor Leon Porfilo," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>I suppose that the priest jerked back his head, and his eyes fired, as
  they always did when any one who was dear to him was mentioned. I think that
  he loved me more than he loved any other thing in the world. Had he not
  poured out upon me years of teaching and patient labor?</p>

  <p>"I have avoided you lately," admitted Father McGuire with that warlike
  frankness of his.</p>

  <p>"But why?" said Andrew Chase.</p>

  <p>Not that he valued Father McGuire, but he was so used to admiration that
  it was rather a shock to him to be talked to in this manner.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Father McGuire, "I have thought over the matter from A to
  Z. At first I thought that Leon might be in the wrong. I knew that he was
  headstrong. I knew that he was found of violence. But in time I have come to
  see that it would have been impossible for him to murder Niginski in cold
  blood. He was falsely accused."</p>

  <p>"I trust that you are right," said Andrew Chase.</p>

  <p>"Niginski was set upon him by some other person. There could have been no
  other reason behind the fight."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that an odd conclusion?" said the big man.</p>

  <p>"Examine your own heart, young man," said Father McGuire.</p>

  <p>He would have passed on, but Chase, with a thrust of his spurs, planted
  the great black squarely in his path.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what you mean by that," said he.</p>

  <p>There was never a very thick crust over the fires that burned in the
  priest. Now he broke out:</p>

  <p>"It was you, Andrew Chase, or some other person in your family, who bribed
  the ruffian, Niginski, to attack the boy!"</p>

  <p>With that he went on up the street and left Chase behind him. I have all
  the details of this scene which meant so much to my life. I had them from
  Father McGuire himself when I saw him again on a sad day.</p>

  <p>Now I can dare to step into the mind of Andrew Chase to a certain extent
  and tell you what went on there. When he went back to his home, he turned
  this matter over and over in his mind. Whether he were guilty or not of the
  crime which Father McGuire charged to him, he knew that if the priest felt so
  strongly about the matter, other less kindly men and less judicious men must
  be thinking the thing, also.</p>

  <p>Such a condition of life was intolerable to him. He could not exist except
  in that atmosphere of unqualified admiration with which he had been
  surrounded from his infancy. Two things he chiefly prized. The one was
  praise; the other was fear. If he could not be praised, he would be feared.
  But the praise was that for which he chiefly hungered.</p>

  <p>He had never been without it. He had never attended a school where he was
  not the first scholar. He had never competed in a game where he was not the
  leading athlete, and I have no doubt that he told himself this suspicion was
  intolerable. He must remove it. How could that be done?</p>

  <p>Where I was concerned, the way was cleared before him. I was an outlawed
  man. There was a price on my head which had mounted to three thousand dollars
  a very few weeks after my escape from the Mendez jail; and in the two years
  which followed that price had been raised, gradually, until now he who
  captured me was assured of the very substantial sum of seven thousand
  dollars!</p>

  <p>The reward could not tempt him, but it pointed out to him that he could do
  a brilliant thing. He could remove this growing scandal which was spreading
  through the range about him.</p>

  <p>He could remove it by removing the man whom he was said to have wronged.
  When he had disposed of me, instead of taking the handsome reward which was
  offered for my apprehension, alive or dead, he could make a fine gesture and
  crown himself with new laurels by turning over the entire sum to some popular
  charity.</p>

  <p>I know from several events that followed later that this was lurking in
  his mind.</p>

  <p>But, perhaps more than all else, I am sure that the sheer adventure for
  its own sake was a great impelling factor in the mind of Andrew. He had lived
  a soft life too long. The thought of danger was an inviting thing to him, and
  he prepared at once to make his journey.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt that, no matter what his other motives, he would not have
  undertaken that ride to the north, through the mountains, if his goal had
  been any common man. But, by this time, rumor and gossip had piled up quite a
  heap of talk around me and made me a figure of some size in the eye of the
  Western world. The man who conquered me was sure to gain a great reputation.
  Andrew Chase decided that the time had come for him to put a bullet through
  my head and clap my little fame into his pocket.</p>

  <p>It was when I was making an excellent bargain, that I first heard the grim
  news that Andrew was on my trail.</p>

  <p>My horse was still Jackson's chestnut mare, which I had taken in the first
  place, and paid for in the second, so that no charge of horse theft could be
  lodged against me. On Jackson's mare, I started for the barren highlands
  above the timber line, and spent a day of laborious moiling and toiling
  before I got to the high places, in which I felt fairly safe. For it was not
  the first time I had gone among the cliffs and the heads of the great ravine
  for a refuge. I knew that high country better than anyone except an unshaven
  naturalist who tramped those dreary regions to study birds and flowers and
  insects.</p>

  <p>It was not the fear of the sheriff and the hunting posses which had driven
  me to the heights, but the efforts of no less a person than Tex Cummins
  himself to destroy me!</p>

  <p>I was well up in the rocks, when a disaster of the first magnitude
  overtook me&mdash;the chestnut mare went lame! I could do nothing but find a
  sheltered place in a great nest of rocks on the flat shoulder of a windy
  height and wait for her leg to become sound again.</p>

  <p>I waited for two days, and she was progressing toward recovery. But they
  were two such days as I hope never to pass through again. Every moment of
  them I expected the sound of horses, and then the sound of guns.</p>

  <p>When I heard a human voice from the ridge above me on the morning of the
  third day, I felt sure that I had been cornered at last.</p>

  <p>I looked up quickly from my shelter, and there I saw, on the edge of the
  cliff, five hundred feet above my head, a rider on a big mule outlined
  against the sky.</p>

  <p>No matter who it was, I felt that I was safe for the moment, at least. The
  cliff was almost sheer, and from that distance rifle fire could not harm me
  behind my broken wall of rocks. Then a yell of amazement and alarm tore its
  way out of my throat, for the mule pitched head-first over the edge of the
  height!</p>

  <p>I could not help blinking my eyes shut. But when I looked out again,
  toward the base of the cliff, expecting to see a confused, shapeless heap of
  beast and man, I found that the base of the rocks was still clean. Far up
  above me was mule and man, and still pitching down through thinnest
  air&mdash;yet not falling!</p>

  <p>No, as a great mountain sheep pitches from a ridge and bounces down a
  frightful wall of rock, striking its feet here and there on almost
  imperceptible ridges to check the impetus of its descent, so that weird mule
  dropped out of the sky above me and zig-zagged to the table-land immediately
  before me.</p>

  <p>I watched the face of the rider during the latter part of that wild
  descent. He was a Negro; but he was not showing the whites of his eyes. He
  had leaned himself far back in the saddle, of course, to keep from
  overbalancing his mount, but otherwise he showed no more concern than I would
  have shown in taking my chestnut for a gallop across prairie land!</p>

  <p>When they were safe below, however, trouble began. The mule&mdash;it was a
  big, mouse-colored animal close to sixteen hands in height&mdash;seemed to be
  in a sort of happy frenzy, and having swooped like a bird through the air. it
  seemed to disdain its rider. It began to dance and side jump with pricking
  ears, while the Negro clung to the saddle with both hands, yelling: "Hey,
  you, Roanoke, you fool mule! Hey, Roanoke! Ain't you got no sense? How'm I
  botherin' you now? Hey, Roanoke! Quit it-or-"</p>

  <p>Here Roanoke performed a maneuver something like the snapping of a whip.
  The Negro shot from the saddle, turned a somersault in the air, and landed
  unharmed&mdash;by good luck&mdash;on his hands and feet. As for the mule,
  since it had shaken off its rider, it started for the nearest outcropping of
  bunch grass, with which the little plateau was dotted, and began to feed.</p>

  <p>Its master stood up and licked his scratched hands. Then he burst into a
  torrent of cursing. Finally he took Roanoke by the reins and drew a gun.</p>

  <p>"Roanoke," said he, "I've knowed you, boy and man, for five years, and I
  ain't seen nor heard tell no good about you. If they was ever a dog-gone man-
  killin', wuthless mule, it's you. Roanoke, you is coming to your last
  day!"</p>

  <p>He raised the gun.</p>

  <p>I stopped him with a shout which startled him, so that he jumped away and
  whirled around on me with the gun leveled. When he saw my face he uttered a
  wild yell and dropped the gun to the rocks.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Porfilo!" cried he. "I ain't meanin' you no harm! For de Lawd's
  sake, don't shoot, sir!"</p>

  <p>All this time he had his two long arms stretched high above his head, and
  he was fairly dancing with terror.</p>

  <p>Roanoke was already back at his cropping of the bunch grass. As for me, I
  had not made so much as a motion toward my gun.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to harm you, friend," said I. "Have you ever heard of me
  doing an unprovoked murder?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't heard no harm about you, Mr. Porfilo," said the Negro, and he
  quaked more than ever.</p>

  <p>"Put your hands down and take up your gun," said I. "Will you tell me if
  Roanoke makes a habit of coming down cliffs like that one?"</p>

  <p>When he saw that I really meant him no harm, he recovered his spirits a
  little, but he refused to touch his gun, and merely kicked it to a greater
  distance, as if he feared that while it was near him I might misunderstand
  some chance gesture of his hands. I offered him the "makings," and he
  accepted them with a grin. His spirits began to rise at once.</p>

  <p>"This here is something that I didn't never expect," said he. "I never
  thought that old Pete Garvey would be sittin' on a cloud smokin' with Leon
  Porfilo. I never thought of that!"</p>

  <p>Below us there was a thin mist blown on the wind, so that there was some
  semblance of reason for this metaphor.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to kill your mule, Garvey?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Because," said he, "I never know whether I'm gonna be sittin' in the
  saddle or standin' on my head on a rock, the next minute, while I'm ridin'
  that fool Roanoke."</p>

  <p>I looked at the mule again. Even its head was smaller and better formed
  than I had ever seen in another of its kind, and it had the strong, sinewy
  neck of a stallion, with the body and legs of a thoroughbred. I pointed out
  those qualities to Pete, and he grinned again.</p>

  <p>"That mule is what you might call a mistake, Mr. Porfilo," said he. "I was
  workin' for Mr. Morris Carney, takin' care of some of his fine hosses, and
  one of the mares went roamin' too far afield, you might say. Well, sir, when
  the time come, Roanoke come out in the world, and he's got all the brains and
  the meanness of a blood hoss and a jackass rolled into one! He's mean because
  he knows too much, not because he's a fool!"</p>

  <p>I smiled at this idea, and then I asked him if the mule often made such a
  cliff as this one which he had just descended as an ordinary trail.</p>

  <p>"He seen a mountain goat dancin' in the air one day," said Peter Garvey,
  "and he didn't never rest till he tried the same thing. First time it
  happened, I was huntin' along the edge of a cliff, and this dog-gone son of
  an eagle, he jest dipped over the side. I give one look to the sky, because
  that was where I hoped I'd be goin' when that mule got through drivin' a hole
  in the rocks of the valley that was half a mile under us.</p>

  <p>"But he didn't drive no hole; he just went bouncin' and slidin' and
  glidin' down like he was half on wings and half on rubber. We come down, and
  when I looked back behind me from below, I says to myself that the good Lord,
  he sure done hitched a rope onto Roanoke and me. But about the next day he
  done the same thing. Dog-gone me if the nerve strain ain't plumb wore out
  this nigger!"</p>

  <p>"Does he ever make a misstep?" asked I.</p>

  <p>"Misstep? He's got some sort of glue in his feet, Mr. Porfilo," said Pete.
  "They ain't no way for him to slip. Now he could turn right around and run up
  that cliff with me on his back and think nothin' of it. It ain't what he does
  goin' up or down that I mind&mdash;it's what he does after he gets to the
  flat. He gets so riled up and proud of himself playin' buzzard and eagle that
  when he gets a chance, he does a dance like an Indian and lands me mostly on
  my head!"</p>

  <p>He rubbed that powerfully constructed dome with great sympathy, and I cut
  short his sorrow by interrupting him and offering him a perfectly
  manageable&mdash;but lame&mdash;mare for the mule as it stood.</p>

  <p>By the way of Pete Garvey in approaching that mare, I knew that he
  understood horseflesh. She was not a real beauty. Her head was spoiled with a
  Roman nose, and at that time she was thin enough to show every rib, which is
  apt to spoil the looks of a veritable Eclipse. But Pete Garvey was not
  bothered by superficials. First he examined the lame leg and then looked at
  me with an irrepressible grin which told me that he very well understood that
  it was only a minor ailment which could be cured by another day's rest. Then
  he went over the rest of the chestnut inch by inch. Before he finished, his
  grin clove his face squarely in two.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Porfilo," said he, "I been always a mighty good friend, unbeknownst
  to you, and I dunno but that I might take this here mare off your hands to
  please you&mdash;and give you my Roanoke mule for nothin'!"</p>

  <p>"Pete, you scoundrel!" said I, "that's a five-hundred-dollar mare, and you
  know it. Did you ever see a mule that was worth that much?"</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see a wall-climbin' mule?" said Pete.</p>

  <p>He was very much at his ease now. His life had been spared, and money had
  been put into his pocket. No wonder, then, that his chest enlarged, but his
  very next speech made me glad that I had brought him to a talkative mood, for
  he said:</p>

  <p>"You bein' up here ain't because Mr. Andrew Chase is callin' on you, Mr.
  Porfilo?"</p>

  <p>I presume that I changed color, for I felt the eyes of the Negro fixed
  curiously upon me.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you know about Chase," said I.</p>

  <p>He told me what he knew, which was brief enough. Andrew Chase had entered
  the mountains freely proclaiming upon all sides that he intended to hunt me
  down and meet me single-handed. I felt, with a gripping chill about the
  heart, that Andrew would accomplish his purpose. The mere thought of failure
  could not be connected with his name.</p>

  <p>I left Pete Garvey with thanks for his tidings, and I mounted the mule
  after I had transferred saddle and bridle to it. Pete assured me that that
  mule knew far more than any human being he had ever met, and before another
  hour was out I was inclined to agree with the Negro. Roanoke knew exactly
  what slope he could climb and what slope was too steep for him. He knew what
  cliff he could descend like a bouncing mountain goat, and he knew what one
  did not supply a sufficient number of footholds to check the downward
  rush.</p>

  <p>How my spirits soared! By the cut of Roanoke's body, I knew that he had
  speed over the flat enough to keep off the rush of any cow pony; but I knew,
  also, that no mule ever bred could face the rush of a thoroughbred sprinter
  such as some of the outlaws and the men of the law kept in the mountains.
  However, unless one intended to fly straight down one of the long valleys,
  there were not very many opportunities to use a horse over easy terrain, and
  when it came to mountain work, those who pursued me had better try to catch a
  mountain sheep!</p>

  <p>All the rest of that day I was gayly employed remapping, in my mind, all
  the trails that I knew in the region round about. Many and many a dizzy short
  cut was marked out for future use.</p>

  <p>Not until the dark came did the thought of Andrew Chase return gloomily
  upon me.</p>

  <p>For Andrew, in the meantime, had advanced into the heart of my country,
  and that very afternoon he had his first historic interview with Mike
  O'Rourke. It was not odd that he should have known that she was probably
  aware of my whereabouts; it was only rare that he should have had enough
  self-assurance to think that she would be apt to betray to him anything that
  she knew about me.</p>

  <p>For the whole reach of the mountains understood very well that Mike and I
  were friends. They had known it well for more than a year, when I betrayed my
  hand by making a foolish present to her.</p>

  <p>She had lost a pet horse&mdash;a beautiful little pinto with the eyes and
  the legs of a deer. It had broken a leg in a hole in the ground and had been
  destroyed. I, full of her sorrow, swore to myself that I would find something
  to take her trouble away, and I had in mind the very horse.</p>

  <p>Old "Cam" Tucker, who had a small ranch near Buffalo Bend, in the river
  bottom, knew horses better than most men know themselves, and the prize of
  his whole outfit was a dainty little cream-colored mare, not a shade over
  fifteen hands high, but made like a watch for compact strength and beauty.
  When I saw her silver mane and tail shining in the sun, I had thought of Mike
  on her back; when I heard that the pinto was dead, I struck straight back for
  Buffalo Bend and got at night to the place of Cam Tucker.</p>

  <p>I bought a beautiful little mare off him which I presented to Mike. I had
  not thought that he would talk, but he did, and the tale of my purchase
  spread like wildfire.</p>

  <p>So it was not remarkable that Andrew should have heard of the affair, but
  how could he have had the effrontery to go to her for information?</p>

  <p>There is another way of explaining it. He may have gone, not in the hope
  of getting immediate information, but simply to find out how true the report
  of her beauty might be. If he satisfied himself that she was worth a little
  trouble</p>

  <p>Ah, well, that thought came to me afterward, when the damage had been
  done!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; APPEALING TO MIKE</h2>

  <p class="first">How much I would have given to be near when handsome Andrew
  Chase stood over little Mike O'Rourke, bowing to her as if she were a great
  lady, while the black charger, Tennessee, tossed its head in the
  background!</p>

  <p>Ah, what a horse was Tennessee, and what a man was Andrew! How they were
  intended by Providence to set off one another! I suppose that Mike had never
  seen such a horse. Certainly she had never seen such a man, for though the
  best young men of the range dropped in to pay their respects to her, they
  were fellows who could not help polishing themselves up before they went to
  call.</p>

  <p>They made themselves as gaudy as Mexicans, almost, but when Mike looked up
  to Andrew she looked up to a gentleman, and there is something in a woman
  which responds to that mysterious quality in a man. Not that she is always
  won by courtesy and the other qualities which go with gentility, so subtle,
  most of them, that they lack a name; indeed, she may prefer some
  rough-and-ready fellow.</p>

  <p>She may like a good-natured clown; but she will know the real gentleman
  when she sees him, unless her eyes are already blinded by love. Then a tinsel
  imitation may do for her.</p>

  <p>However, when Mike saw him I know that she knew him. I suppose that, under
  all the dust of riding, and in spite of the sweat and the grime, he seemed
  cleaner to her, in a nameless way, than all the other men she had known.</p>

  <p>He introduced himself in the following way: "I am Andrew Chase, an old
  acquaintance of Leon Porfilo. But I see that you have heard of me, Miss
  O'Rourke."</p>

  <p>For she had stiffened like a dog that finds bear written most legibly in
  the bodiless wind.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you," said Mike coldly. "I've heard of you
  from&mdash;him!"</p>

  <p>No doubt she said it in a tone that implied a great deal. But it took even
  more to shake the calm of Andrew Chase. He merely smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that he has given me a rather black name," said he.</p>

  <p>"He's a queer fellow," said Mike, "as I suppose you know&mdash;if you've
  had much to do with him.</p>

  <p>"I've always thought him very queer," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"And square!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very," said Andrew lightly.</p>

  <p>She grew so angry that her eyes were dim. "Do you know what he has told me
  about you?"</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," said he.</p>

  <p>"Your idea," answered Mike, "is that he's said you are an underhand sneak
  who hired that Niginski to try a gun at his head; a rich man's son who used
  your father's money to beat him and run him out of the county so that he
  wouldn't get your brother into trouble; a bully who used your age and your
  strength to knock him senseless, once, after he'd fairly beaten that same
  brother!"</p>

  <p>Even Andrew could not quite keep his face under such an attack, but he
  said:</p>

  <p>"I haven't guessed that he would say all of that. I didn't know that
  Porfilo had such&mdash;an educated and lively imagination!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's be frank," said Mike; "the same way that Leon is frank. He
  could have said those things about you, but he didn't. He simply told me that
  you are the best-looking man he knows, and the man with the best mind, and
  the strongest and bravest man he knows, and the man he's most afraid of in
  the world!"</p>

  <p>She had a way, of course, of knowing how to startle people, and there's no
  doubt that she startled Andrew Chase with this talk. He only blinked at her
  and rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"I know that you're joking," said he very feebly.</p>

  <p>"But I'm not," said she. "I'm telling you the very honest truth!"</p>

  <p>To this he replied gravely: "Then I have to revise what I've thought of
  him. He's just what you say&mdash;an unusual man!"</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me why you came to see me?" said she.</p>

  <p>"Because I expect to spend a good deal of time in this part of the
  mountains."</p>

  <p>"Trailing poor Leon!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!"</p>

  <p>This was her own frankness sent back to her, and she squinted at the
  handsome face of Andrew to make out what might lie in his mind.</p>

  <p>"You've picked an odd person to tell it to," said Mike, beginning to glow
  again.</p>

  <p>"I suppose some might think so," said he. "But since I'm to be around this
  part of the mountains so long, I wondered if you and I might not be
  friends&mdash; in a way&mdash;not real friends, perhaps&mdash;but friendly
  enough to say 'How do you do?' when we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She held up a finger at him. "You expect Leon to come down here to see me,
  and then you'll be waiting! But I'll warn him, Mr. Andrew Chase!"</p>

  <p>"If you warn him, will that keep him away?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>She drew in her breath and then checked the words that were about to come
  out. She saw tragedy very near, and it frightened her.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to say," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Why," he suggested, "just say that, no matter what a war there may be
  between Leon and myself, so long as I fight fairly, man to man,
  single-handed, against him, there is no real reason why I shouldn't sit on
  your front porch once in a while or help you water the garden."</p>

  <p>From almost any other person such talk would have made her suspicious, I
  have no doubt. But one couldn't very well accuse such a man as Andrew Chase
  of making foolish proposals to a girl he had met only a minute
  before&mdash;and under such conditions! If Mike was shocked at first, she was
  interested afterward.</p>

  <p>"Well," said she in her open way, "you rather beat me, Mr. Chase."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for that," said he. "But perhaps you'll let me explain why I
  have to go after Leon Porfilo?"</p>

  <p>"I will," said she, "of course!"</p>

  <p>"There is a great deal of ugly talk afloat," said he. "Some of it is
  absurd. Such as the rumor that I bribed Niginski to go after Porfilo. That
  rumor has so much body to it that even a clear-headed person like yourself
  has taken it to heart a little, I'm afraid. Although I hope to convince you
  that I'm not the sort of a person who hires others to do his fighting for
  him!"</p>

  <p>I think no one could have looked squarely into his calm, courageous eyes,
  as Mike was doing at that moment, and then accuse him of being a sneak and
  traitor. She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to feel that I don't know what to think," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"That's something for me to build on," said Andrew. "In the meantime,
  those rumors have grown and grown, until I had to end them one way or
  another. The only way I can find is to come single-handed into the valley and
  try to find Mr. Porfilo. Then, to be blunt and brutal, I intend to fight it
  out with him, man to man. In the opinion of the world, the survivor will be
  right. No, I think after such a fight, no matter what they have said of me
  before, they will agree that I wouldn't have undertaken such a thing if I
  were a sneak or a coward."</p>

  <p>This was a reasonably fair statement, one must admit. Mike was just the
  person to see the reasonableness of it.</p>

  <p>"Every one knows," said she, "that I'm proud to be the friend of Leon
  Porfilo. How can you ask me to be friendly with you, too?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't ask that," said Andrew Chase. "I've simply come to introduce
  myself and ask you to look at me not as a beast, but as a man&mdash;guilty of
  a great many faults, I know, but not of murder. I've come to see you because
  I intend to haunt this section around your house for a long time to come. I
  am not going to hunt Leon Porfilo. I am going to let him come down here to
  hunt me!"</p>

  <p>It must have chilled the big heart of Mike to hear such a calm statement
  of facts.</p>

  <p>"Knowing that I'll warn him?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Taking that for granted, of course."</p>

  <p>"It seems a terrible thing!"</p>

  <p>"But isn't it fair?"</p>

  <p>"I can't help saying that it looks fair. A man has to fight when his honor
  is attacked as they've attacked yours, I know."</p>

  <p>That was the mountain way of looking at the matter. I can't help thinking
  that it was the right way of looking at it, too. But, oh, what a tragedy it
  put in store for me!</p>

  <p>"I can't very well ask you into the house for a cup of coffee," said Mike,
  puzzling over him. "I can't&mdash;and be true to poor Leon. Yet I'd like
  to!"</p>

  <p>"I'm as greatly obliged to you," said Andrew. "But, you see, I'd hardly be
  comfortable there. It would be like taking charity from Leon himself. I
  couldn't do that, you know!"</p>

  <p>How could he have put it more neatly? And with that matchless smile of his
  to crown it all!</p>

  <p>He said good-bye and stepped back to the side of the big, black Tennessee,
  and the stallion pricked his ears and nibbled gently at the shoulder of his
  master. They always made a grand picture, standing side by side.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, from Mike: "I am going to ask you in!"</p>

  <p>"No, no!"</p>

  <p>"You're hot and tired."</p>

  <p>"We'd both be embarrassed."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't!"</p>

  <p>"But people have a nasty way of talking"</p>

  <p>"What do I care about people? They've wagged their tongues almost out
  about me, already."</p>

  <p>"Then it would have to be explained to Porfilo. I can't put that on
  you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing I do has to be explained to anyone&mdash;now that I'm eighteen!"
  said she.</p>

  <p>You observe, Mike was always a little lioness. He, wise fox, from the very
  first appealed to her love of something startling&mdash;appealed, above all,
  to her courage itself.</p>

  <p>That afternoon he drank the coffee and ate a fat sandwich which she
  prepared!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; HOT WORDS</h2>

  <p class="first">It was no rumor of the meeting between Mike and Andrew Chase
  that brought me down the valley, but, making a swing down the western canyon,
  from Buffalo Bend, I dropped in on Cam Tucker. Whenever I was in that
  vicinity I used to drop in on him, and he was usually glad to see me.</p>

  <p>He had made a very fair profit on me in our one horse deal, and after that
  the noise went abroad so far about the outlaw who had spent twelve hundred
  dollars upon one of the Tucker horses, that other people became interested in
  his breeding. His prices soared. He was able to double them within a month.
  Naturally, he was very grateful to me.</p>

  <p>So that queer, rigid, fearless little man used to prop himself against the
  back of his chair and tell me all the news that he thought would interest me.
  He told me on this day of the bank robbery at Timber Creek. It had been a bad
  affair. When all was nearly said and done, and the robbers about to ride
  away, a one-legged cow-puncher had looked out of the window of his room
  across the street&mdash;because his recently amputated leg gave him too much
  pain to let him sleep&mdash;and he opened fire upon the suspicious forms
  coming from the bank.</p>

  <p>There were four of them, and that lucky cow-puncher, with his plunging
  fire from above out of the mouth of a repeating Winchester, dropped two of
  them and killed a third. Only one man remained, and he got away with a small
  quantity of loot. Seven or eight thousand dollars was all that the bank
  missed. The bank, out of gratitude, had given the one-legged cow-puncher a
  job as inside watchman in the bank for the rest of his days.</p>

  <p>I asked what description they had of the man who had escaped, and I was
  told that the men who had ridden for some distance in hot pursuit of him,
  blazing away with their rifles all the time, had made out a rather
  short-bodied man with extraordinarily broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>It meant a good deal to me. I called up the figure of Sam Moyer at once.
  It was true that he had not been seen in these parts for more than a year,
  but that made it all the more likely that he would come back and try another
  fling in his old camping grounds. Sam had fled north of Timber Creek, but I
  knew fairly clearly that he would eventually turn and ride south, for he was
  one of Tex Cummins' men, and the houses of the friends of Tex were scattered
  south from Timber Creek, which was almost the northernmost boundary of the
  district in which he operated.</p>

  <p>I found his trail and followed it until it brought me, just at the first
  thickening of the dark, into the valley and opposite the ravine which held
  the house of O'Rourke. Of course I could not give over seeing her now that I
  was so close.</p>

  <p>I headed across the valley at Roanoke's shambling trot. His natural gait
  was not the usual mustang canter which rocks one across the miles without
  effort, but his swinging trot was almost as fast as the average
  canter&mdash;faster than some&mdash;and he was as unwearying at that pace as
  a wolf.</p>

  <p>So he slid me across the night and up the darker ravine beyond, until I
  came under the trees opposite the house. There I dismounted and whistled the
  usual signal, my throat so closed with a joyous expectation that I could
  hardly make a sound.</p>

  <p>She came at once, out the side door, and then running through the darkness
  to me. But when she came near there was no joyous greeting. She simply caught
  at my hands and shook them with her fear for me.</p>

  <p>"Leon, you have not come down to fight him?"</p>

  <p>"To fight whom?"</p>

  <p>"You have not heard?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"He is here! Andrew Chase is here!"</p>

  <p>It made me throw a startled glance over my shoulder, but then I tried to
  reassure her with a confidence which I by no means felt. For I was perfectly
  well aware, then and at all times, that Andrew Chase was a better man than I.
  By nothing but luck could I beat him.</p>

  <p>"He's been here every day, waiting and watching for you, Leon. You must
  not meet him!"</p>

  <p>"How have you seen him?" I asked. "Has he shown himself as openly as
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's as brave as a lion," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said I. "Have you been talking to him?"</p>

  <p>"Will you believe," said Mike, with a little drawn breath of wonder, "that
  he came to me and told me everything, very frankly? There is no deceit in
  him. He's as open as the day, Leon!"</p>

  <p>What could I do except marvel at her; and the first dread came over me. I
  knew the smooth tongue and the easy manner of Andrew Chase too well, and I
  knew that there was danger in it. But now she was rushing ahead with the
  story. She was telling me how he came and how he met her; she was telling me
  how tall and how handsome he had stood before her.</p>

  <p>"As big and as tall as you are, Leon, but"</p>

  <p>She stopped hastily here and went on with something else, but I had sense
  enough to fill out the uncompleted sentence. As tall and as heavy as I, but
  not with the ugly face of a prize fighter, not with beetling brows and
  swarthy skin and cold black eyes, and big, heavy-boned jaw; not with
  monstrous feet and huge hands; not with the bone of a horse and something of
  the clumsiness of a steer. I could fill in all that sentence for myself, and
  fear grew greater in me every moment&mdash;not the fear of Andrew's gun!</p>

  <p>She had finished the story of how he sat in her house drinking coffee;
  then I broke in on her. That fear, and that grief, made me rude.</p>

  <p>"You've been doing a fool thing, Mike," said I.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" snapped out Mike.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, it's dangerous," said I.</p>

  <p>"What is dangerous?" said Mike, very cool.</p>

  <p>"Andrew Chase. Do you think that you know enough about men to handle
  him?"</p>

  <p>I should not have said that. She was eighteen, and at eighteen she was a
  great deal wiser than I at twenty, I have no doubt.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," said Mike, "unless you are suggesting that
  Andrew Chase is not a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that," said I. "Not at all! At least, he can talk like a
  gentleman. But what has talk to do with the real thing? Politeness is only
  one part, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know all about it," said Mike, more cold than ever.</p>

  <p>"Mike," said I, "I suppose that I'm not to talk frankly to you?"</p>

  <p>She stamped. "I wish you could have heard what he had to say about you!"
  cried Mike. "He didn't speak one thing against you. He didn't try to slander
  you behind your back!"</p>

  <p>"You mean that I'm slandering him? I can see how it is. He has you charmed
  already."</p>

  <p>"Leon Porfilo, how do you dare say that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mean that he's turned your head. But the way a snake charms a
  bird!"</p>

  <p>"I'm a silly little fool like a bird in a nest, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Mike, will you listen to reason?"</p>

  <p>"I'm listening&mdash;but I don't hear the reason. I've never heard you
  talk like this before!"</p>

  <p>"I hope to Heaven that I never have to talk like this again!" I exclaimed.
  "But I tell you what I know&mdash;that Andrew Chase is no good!"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!" she answered tartly.</p>

  <p>"Can a man be really good after he's hired a crook to shoot"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that!" she exclaimed. "He told me all about it. He told me how that
  foolish story started."</p>

  <p>"Is it a foolish story?"</p>

  <p>"Then tell me what real proofs you have against him?"</p>

  <p>"If I had real proofs, I'd have him in jail, if I wanted to. One doesn't
  get real proofs of such dirty work. He's too smart to let such proofs float
  around."</p>

  <p>"You've only guessed bad things about him. Isn't that true? Then you come
  to me and slander him. Leon, it isn't manly!"</p>

  <p>I was desperate. "It has to stop!" I shouted at her.</p>

  <p>"What has to stop?"</p>

  <p>"You must stop seeing him."</p>

  <p>"I must?" said she, full of danger.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand that he'll begin to wind you around his little
  finger?"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Mike. "I'm&mdash;I'm ashamed to stand here and let you talk
  like this!"</p>

  <p>"Mike, I forbid you to see him, and that's flat!"</p>

  <p>Looking back upon it, I think that I must have been half mad to speak to
  her in such a manner&mdash;to Mike, of all the women in the world. I was not
  long left in the dark.</p>

  <p>"You forbid me?"</p>

  <p>"I do!"</p>

  <p>"What right have you over me, Leon Porfilo?"</p>

  <p>It brought me back to my sense with a jerk. "No right, only"</p>

  <p>"You owe an apology to him&mdash;and to me!" said she.</p>

  <p>"Mike, I shall apologize to you, if you want me to. But I don't make any
  bones about it. I love you, Mike. It makes me sick inside to think of you in
  the hands of that fix"</p>

  <p>"Leon," cried she, with a voice that fairly trembled with anger, "I don't
  want to hear any more. I've heard a lot too much already. Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>I took one step after her and dropped my heavy hand on her shoulder. "Are
  you going to go like this, Mike?"</p>

  <p>"Will you take your hand away?"</p>

  <p>"Very well! I'll never bother you again, if you wish to be left to Andrew
  Chase and his grand ways!"</p>

  <p>"You coward!" exclaimed Mike.</p>

  <p>It was like a whip struck across my face, and as I recoiled from her, she
  ran on toward the house. I did not follow again. I felt that in five minutes
  I had blasted away the greatest happiness in my life, and that I could never
  repair the damage which had been done. I knew, no matter how she might have
  felt toward him before, that this scene with me was almost enough to throw
  her headlong into his arms.</p>

  <p>I went back to Roanoke and rode him slowly through the trees. We climbed
  the ragged wall of the ravine, and I was preparing to camp for the night,
  when I saw a light blinking four or five miles to the south. I remembered,
  then, the shack which the Ricks brothers, Willie and Joe, had built on the
  edge of the highlands above the valley. I remembered, too, that I had heard
  they were friendly to Tex Cummins. What was more likely than that Sam Moyer,
  whose trail had led toward the valley the night before, might be lying up and
  resting at the Ricks house?</p>

  <p>It was enough to start me. After my interview with Mike I wanted action
  and lots of it. I wanted blood, and with the smell of blood in my nostrils, I
  started for the Ricks house.</p>

  <p>However, I made no attempt to reconnoiter. I simply left Roanoke nearby
  and strode to the door. The jumble of voices inside stopped instantly as I
  stirred the latch.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" asked the voice of Willie Ricks.</p>

  <p>The blind devil which makes men kill and gets them killed was certainly on
  me. "Porfilo!" I shouted, and gave the door my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Porfilo!" rumbled several voices within.</p>

  <p>For my career in the past two years, preying on the thieves themselves and
  making myself fat with the spoils which their cunning had gathered, had made
  me as dreaded among them as a man-eating tiger is dreaded in a Hindu
  village.</p>

  <p>That instant the light was blown out, and at the same time I struck the
  door with my shoulder.</p>

  <p>It was a good, strong bolt, well secured in stout, new wood, but the demon
  in me had no regard for wood or iron this night. I ground that bolt through
  the wood as though it were secured in hollowed paper, and flung the door wide
  as a voice barked&mdash;pitched high with half-hysterical rage and fear:</p>

  <p>"Keep back, Porfilo! Keep out, or I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>That was my wide-shouldered friend, Sam Moyer, I knew, and as the door
  darted open before me, a pistol blazed out of the pitchy blackness
  within.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE BIG SCRAP</h2>

  <p class="first">I had pitched forward on my belly as I tossed the door wide.
  The slug from the gun of Moyer combed the air breast high above me&mdash;a
  well-intentioned shot, but fired just a trick too late.</p>

  <p>Someone was yelling&mdash;I think it was Joe Ricks:</p>

  <p>"Lord, boys! Are you gonna do a murder? Will you put up your guns?
  Porfilo, are you drunk? No, darn you, take it, then!"</p>

  <p>I saw a shadow to the left of me, and I leaped at it like a dog off my
  hands and feet and knees. I struck that body and it went down with a yell
  before me.</p>

  <p>"Help!" screamed the voice beneath me.</p>

  <p>I reached for his windpipe, found it, and crushed my hands deep. The shout
  went out in a bubbling cry.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot!" yelled another. "Don't shoot, Sam. He's got Joe down.
  Knives, Sam!"</p>

  <p>I knew what that meant. I surged to my knees and heaved up the senseless
  form of Joe with me. He was a heavy man. I presume he weighed not ten pounds
  short of two hundred, but there was enough strength of passion in me to let
  me throw him straight into the face of a shadow which was lunging at
  me&mdash;lunging with a pale glint of steel in front.</p>

  <p>A muffled cry&mdash;a crashing fall&mdash;and that danger was blotted out
  as Joe and the other tumbled in an inextricably jumbled mass in a corner of
  the cabin, with a force that seemed to threaten to tear out the side of the
  cabin.</p>

  <p>I whirled back from that ruinous fall with my left fist swinging as I
  turned, for I knew that the third man would be leaping at me from behind.</p>

  <p>It was in the last nick of time. His knife flicked a bit of skin and flesh
  from the rim of my right ear; then the side of my arm struck him and
  flattened him against the wall. Before he could straighten up, I let him have
  it with a straight right that bit into his face, through the flesh, against
  the bone, and flattened him against the wall. He hung there for an instant as
  though glued. Then he crumpled gently forward and slumped upon his face.</p>

  <p>He was ended&mdash;whichever he was&mdash;and so was Joe. There was only
  the second man to handle and when I gripped him as he disentangled himself
  from Joe's body, I knew that I had Sam Moyer, for his body was a writhing
  mass of the hardest muscle.</p>

  <p>The knife had been knocked from his hand, and now he was reaching for his
  gun. I got his wrist in time, and with a twist burned the flesh and rolled
  the sinews against the bone. That hand was numb and useless.</p>

  <p>He dashed his other fist, with a groan, against my jaw. It was like the
  playful slap of a child to me. I struck with deliberation, up and across,
  with a toss of my whole weight. The knuckles lodged fairly under his chin and
  snapped the head back as though a sledge had struck him on the forehead. He
  fell backward and rolled upon his face.</p>

  <p>Then I lighted the lamp.</p>

  <p>I paid no attention to the men, but sought for the loot at once. It was
  simply padded into an old pigskin wallet, blackened by usage and much time. I
  took out the money and deliberately counted it. Either he had gotten rid of
  part of it already, or else there had been an overstatement on the part of
  the bank.</p>

  <p>There was only forty-eight hundred and a few odd dollars in that wallet. I
  picked up the cash, crammed it into my pocket, and backed out from the cabin.
  I had filled my hands with pleasant action for a few sweet instants, and now
  I was willing to retire. It was not the money that mattered, though my stock
  of cash was at that moment rather low&mdash;it was the delight of the battle
  which I left behind me. Even the scene with Mike, and all the gloomy
  consequences which it foreboded, was forgotten for the time.</p>

  <p>That sense of exaltation lasted long enough for me to find a new camping
  ground not four hundred yards from the cabin itself, on a grassy knoll with a
  sound of running water at the side of the open space. There, facing the east
  so that the first light would most surely rouse me, I stretched out within
  hearing distance of the cabin which I had wrecked, and in five minutes,
  wrapped snugly in my blankets, I was sound asleep.</p>

  <p>I have skipped over this brutal scene as quickly as I could. In all my
  life it is the thing of which I am least proud, but I must confess that even
  the next morning when I wakened I was not greatly repentant at once.
  Fighting, to a young man, is its own justification, in many ways. I had given
  them, as I saw it, fair play. They had the odds of three against one. For a
  time, I felt that it was a very considerable exploit.</p>

  <p>So did the whole valley, which came to know of it when the doctor was
  brought in haste, before morning, to pay attention to Joe's badly injured
  throat that I had gripped. The news slipped out while he was there, and he
  went away filled with the story, and made the very most of it.</p>

  <p>After that, there was a shadow over me. I had acted like a wild beast, and
  people declared that I would continue to act like one and, on some unhappy
  day, commit a wholesale murder that would go down in black for many a year.
  There had been a good deal of sympathy for me up to this time, but after
  that, for a long period, people had little use for me.</p>

  <p>I fled from the posses which I knew would come to the mountains, and in
  those five days, living like an animal rather than a man, I had enough time
  to think over my affairs and think over Mike O'Rourke particularly. What I
  decided was that as soon as possible I must get down to her again and speak
  to her as humbly as she wished. Because I realized now that I could not live
  happily without her.</p>

  <p>It was eleven days after my last interview with her, that I stood again
  under the trees before the O'Rourke house and gave the whistled
  signal&mdash;gave it again and again, and heard not a sound in response. Then
  a door opened, but it was the form of a man which was silhouetted against the
  light within, and not the slender figure of Mike herself.</p>

  <p>A man's voice called: "Porfilo! Oh, Porfilo!"</p>

  <p>It was O'Rourke himself. I had never seen his face in all the two years
  that I had known Mike. But I had heard his voice in the distance, and I knew
  it well enough now. I did not hesitate. I hurried across the open space and
  stood before that square-shouldered little man.</p>

  <p>He looked up to me with his hands on his hips.</p>

  <p>"Son," said he, "will you come inside and have a talk?"</p>

  <p>"You've got bad news," said I. "I can listen to it just as well here in
  the dark."</p>

  <p>"You've got sense," said he. "I've been listenin' every night for that
  whistle of yours. I figgered you'd be back again, no matter what Mike
  said."</p>

  <p>"What did she say?" said I.</p>

  <p>"It would worry you a bit, Porfilo, if I was to tell you. Because I figger
  that you're kind of fond of her."</p>

  <p>"I love Mike!" said I.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" said O'Rourke. "I knew it! But there ain't no way of
  riggerin' a girl. I never gave her mother no twelve-hundred-dollar boss. But
  Mike, she's got a sort of a change of heart&mdash;for a while, at least."</p>

  <p>"What did she say?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"That she don't expect to never see you no more, Porfilo."</p>

  <p>I accepted this blow in silence simply because I was unable to speak.</p>

  <p>"She told me," went on O'Rourke, "that if the worst come to the worst, and
  you come back here again and give her a signal&mdash;which she told me what
  it was&mdash;I was to come out and tell you that she didn't aim to see you
  again. That's why I answered you tonight!"</p>

  <p>"She's inside and knows you're out here?" I asked him bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No. She's gone up the valley to the schoolhouse. There's a dance there.
  Porfilo, I got to say that I'm sorry about this mess."</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference," said I gloomily. "She could never have married
  an outlawed man!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," said O'Rourke, "you'll come out on top in the end. The law ain't
  framed to get a gent with an honest heart. It won't get you, Porfilo!"</p>

  <p>I left good-natured Pat O'Rourke with this kind assurance from him and
  headed up the valley at the best speed of my mule&mdash;that swinging,
  rhythmic gait, half amble and half trot, done with a sway of the body that
  gave the shambling creature almost the stride of a hard-galloping horse.</p>

  <p>I knew the schoolhouse. It lay between two little villages eight miles
  away, with a steeple like a church's pricking against the side of the
  mountain behind it. All was in the full blast of a dance when I arrived. The
  orchestra was rasping out a two-step, and I heard the whispering sound of
  many feet sliding on the waxed floor.</p>

  <p>I left Roanoke in a position with regard to the best means of escape if it
  came to a pinch&mdash;and that was through one of the big, open windows
  rather than the door, for it was my fixed determination to enter that room,
  see Mike with my own eyes, if she were there, and then get out of the place
  as best I could. If there were trouble, they were more apt to try to cut me
  off at the doors than at the windows.</p>

  <p>So I chose a window on the side of the building. Beneath the trees, a
  short distance away, I left Roanoke. Then I used a handkerchief to whip the
  dust away from my clothes and my boots and started toward the door.</p>

  <p>The jingling of my spurs attracted attention first. Men do not attend
  dances in spurs; not even in the West. As I passed through a shaft of light
  from the very window which I had chosen as my probable one for exit, the
  giggling of a girl in the shadows ceased, and I heard her subdued voice:
  "Why, that almost looks like Porfilo!"</p>

  <p>"You're seein' things," said her witty escort.</p>

  <p>I rounded the front of the building and pressed in among the men at the
  door.</p>

  <p>I had not taken a step among that crowd at the door, before they gave way
  on either side of me with a little whisper of awe and fear, and somewhere at
  the side I heard a frightened murmur: "Porfilo!"</p>

  <p>The two-step had ended, the people had scattered to the edges of the room,
  and now the orchestra was tuning up for the next waltz, and there was a grand
  bustle as the men left their last partners and searched for their next ones.
  But my glance went, like the needle to the north, straight to the shining red
  head of Mike O'Rourke and, beside her, the lofty form of Andrew Chase.</p>

  <p>I saw that and I saw, moreover, that there were no other men clustering
  about her&mdash;Mike, who drew men as honey draws bees! I knew what that
  meant. She was too happy with her present partner to invite attention from
  other men.</p>

  <p>A mist of black hate flushed across my eyes. I looked away and found the
  blue eyes of a golden-haired girl close by fixed wide upon me. The orchestra
  had begun the strains of the dance. Yonder girls and men were stepping onto
  the floor and beginning to spin away, but all this end of the big room was
  filled with standing, gaping couples, staring at me as though I had been a
  ghost.</p>

  <p>In fact, with my rough clothes, none too clean, the great spurs on my
  heels, the cartridge belt strapped about me, and a heavy holstered gun
  hanging at either hip, the sombrero clapped upon my head to make me still
  taller, and my long, black hair projecting from beneath it&mdash;for it had
  not been cut for a month&mdash;I must have looked the part of a pirate.</p>

  <p>Besides, to make me all the more vivid in their eyes, there was the tale
  of how I had smashed my way into the cabin of the Ricks brothers and beaten
  three men to insensibility; that story was hardly more than a week old. They
  stared at me as though the crimson stains were still visible.</p>

  <p>I stepped past the gaping youngster who stood with the blue-eyed girl.</p>

  <p>I simply said: "I don't have many chances to dance. Will you give up this
  turn with your partner, friend?"</p>

  <p>He shrank from me with a sick grin, as though I had stuck a loaded gun
  under his nose. I shied my hat across the room and shook back my hair. I said
  to the girl:</p>

  <p>"I'll promise to keep my spurs out of the way if you'll let me have this
  dance."</p>

  <p>She had been a little pale when I stepped up to her, but Western girls are
  bred and raised to the understanding that, no matter how terrible men may be
  in their own element, with women they must be lambs or else pay the
  consequence; and now she suddenly laughed up at me.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in the world I'd rather do!" said she.</p>

  <p>We stepped off into the dance. Something like a groan of wonder started
  behind us and circled the room. A hundred heads began to turn toward us.</p>

  <p>"You're out of step! You're out of step!" cried my partner under her
  breath. "Seeing Margaret O'Rourke threw you out, I suppose!"</p>

  <p>I took a firmer grip on myself and stepped into time with the music.</p>

  <p>"You're a fine fellow," said I. "I don't care a rap what Margaret O'Rourke
  is doing."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but I know!" said she.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Jessie Calloway."</p>

  <p>"Jessie, this is my first dance in two years, and probably my last dance
  in twenty more. I don't want to think about anything but the music and
  you."</p>

  <p>After that, she made it easy enough to forget the rest of the world. I
  shut out all thought of Mike O'Rourke, even if my heart of hearts were aching
  for her. I concentrated on that laughing, good-natured, freckle-nosed girl,
  and she repaid me. If I were not happy, she made me seem so. That was what I
  wantedto make Mike understand that I could live very pleasantly without
  her.</p>

  <p>It was a boy's thought, but I was only twenty. In another moment I was
  really having the time of my life.</p>

  <p>There were not half a dozen other couples on the floor; and most of these
  were dancing automatically, while the rest of the crowd was banked along the
  edges of the hall and thick around the door, staring at this strange picture
  of the outlaw as he spun with the dance and his long, black hair floated out
  behind him.</p>

  <p>It was more than mere watching, too. I saw some of the older and graver
  men drawing together in the doorway and then pushing their way through the
  crowd in front of them, and they carried drawn guns in their hands.</p>

  <p>But that was not all. Most of all, I was conscious of Mike O'Rourke,
  dancing in the arms of Andrew Chase. Neither of them paid the slightest
  attention to me. It was all the more delightful because I knew that they were
  thinking of nothing but me. Mike was acting admirably, chatting and laughing
  as well as she could, but the face of Chase was a face of stone. Only his
  eyes held any emotion. He was fighting mad, I knew. For he had let the whole
  range of the mountains understand that he intended to blow my head off my
  body. Here I was dancing in the same room with him!</p>

  <p>Of course, there was very little that he could do.</p>

  <p>He could hardly stride up to me with level gun in the midst of the dance.
  Besides, the whole crowd was falling into the spirit of the thing. The old
  violinist, who had played for dances during half a lifetime, had climbed down
  from the teacher's platform&mdash;which was the musicians pedestal&mdash;and
  now he advanced a little on the floor and began to play very pointedly for
  me, nodding and smiling to me with the end of his violin tucked under his old
  chin and turning toward me every time I swung into a different section of the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried Jessie Calloway.</p>

  <p>By the ill luck of the very devil, someone had managed to get word to
  Sheriff Lawton, who happened to be close by; and now here he was, coming with
  half a dozen men behind him. I swung Jessie toward the window and pretended
  not to see.</p>

  <p>"Keep close to me&mdash;and they won't shoot!" said the brave youngster,
  and, though she was trembling, she never lost the beat.</p>

  <p>Out of a circling spin of the waltz I stepped back suddenly under the very
  window itself. I caught up Jessie Calloway in my arms and kissed her in the
  sight of all of them&mdash;and then I leaped through the open window into the
  dark of the night.</p>

  <p>I landed safely and sprinted straight down the side of the building and
  gained the shadows of the trees as two men leaned from that same window and
  opened fire.</p>

  <p>They lost sight of me, and in ten strides I had reached Roanoke. Then off
  and away down the road to freedom; I flashed into view of the light in the
  opened doors of the building, now raging with excitement, and a score of
  people, catching sight of me, waved and raised a great cheer. It was sweet in
  the ears of Leon Porfilo, I swear!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; IN CROTHERS CANYON</h2>

  <p class="first">There was no real enmity between Sheriff Lawton and me. In
  fact, if it had not been that the law forced him to be against me, I know
  that we would have been the best of friends. But on this night, with all that
  crowd looking on, he would have done his best to get me, even if I had been
  his blood brother. If it had been merely brains against brains, no doubt he
  would have succeeded; but it was horse against Roanoke.</p>

  <p>In the open the horses would have won, but there was no open. I saw to
  that. I put Roanoke straight at the hills, and he went up the first one at a
  gallop that killed off the sheriff's horse when he attempted to follow.
  Roanoke himself was breathing hoarsely when he gained the crest, but the
  sheriff's mount was fairly staggering, and before I had put another steep
  hill between me and Lawton, the pursuit was distanced. I let Roanoke drop to
  his wolf trot, and we glided smoothly through the night and away from
  trouble.</p>

  <p>Altogether, it had been a foolishly spectacular adventure, but I was
  rather glad of the whole affair. It had given me another glimpse of Mike; it
  had show me Andrew Chase, and, somehow, I felt that after this night Chase
  would not appear such a perfect hero in her eyes.</p>

  <p>I headed back for the high places, making a three-day detour to accomplish
  what I could have managed by a single half day of air-line riding. I dropped
  in at the house of Lefty Curtis who had at one time or another helped me in
  the way of picking trails, but was nevertheless a friend of Tex Cummins
  also.</p>

  <p>He gave me a gloomy look which boded trouble, and Mrs. Lefty had no other
  greeting than a nod for me.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Lefty," said I, "you mustn't treat me as if I were a thug come
  to hold you up. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>He avoided the question for a time, but afterward he said: "Tex Cummins
  has been to see me. He swears that you picked up the trail of Sam Moyer from
  my house."</p>

  <p>"I picked it up above your house," said I. "If I meet Tex, I'll tell him
  so!"</p>

  <p>"If you meet Tex," said Lefty with a sour grin, "you won't meet him alone.
  He means business this time, and he's going to give you a mite of trouble,
  Porfilo&mdash;mule or no mule! They tell me that the thing hops up the face
  of a cliff like a dog-gone kangaroo!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the mule. You ought to be glad that I found Sam. Because, when
  I left him, he told me to be sure to remember him to you."</p>

  <p>"As far as Tex goes," said Lefty, "I ain't no slave of his. Besides, he'll
  know that I played square with him, if he thinks things over. Have you seen
  Chet O'Rourke yet?"</p>

  <p>I knew that Chet O'Rourke was one of Mike's brothers, but I had no more
  seen him than I had seen her father, up to four nights before, and I told
  Lefty as much.</p>

  <p>"He came up here two days ago," said Lefty, "and he's been buzzing around
  that he expects to meet you in the Crothers Canyon any time before noon any
  day. He's waitin' there for you. Maybe the fool wants to get famous! Maybe he
  wants the blood money that's hangin' on you, old son!"</p>

  <p>I spent that night with Lefty, gathering in the news, and there was plenty
  of it. Poor Lawton was half mad, it seemed. The governor had heard this last
  story about my appearance at the dance right under his nose.</p>

  <p>Of course, I hadn't the least idea that Lawton was within miles of the
  dance. Who would have expected him to be? Indeed, it was only chance that had
  brought him there. The governor of the State had sent a telegram to
  Lawton:</p>

  <p>Get Porfilo. Use every possible endeavor. Will give you military
  assistance if you need it. You are allowing Porfilo to make law and the State
  government ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Lawton, in an ecstasy of shame and rage, wired back his resignation from
  his office, because some enterprising newspaper had managed to lay its hands
  upon that telegram, and the result was that every newspaper in the State
  caught up this juicy morsel and spilled it in liberal capitals across the
  front pages. The governor had replied that he knew of no better man than
  Lawton for the post, and would consider it a shirking of duty if the latter
  left his post.</p>

  <p>"And," said Lefty, "all that Lawton and his gang are doin' now is sittin'
  and prayin' that God'll be good enough to give 'em a crack at you. Lawton has
  wore out three hosses in three days. But he's just ridin' around in circles
  and gettin' nowhere!"</p>

  <p>There were still echoes of the Sam Moyer affair, too. People on the whole
  seemed rather glad that the bank robber had been stripped of his plunder, but
  the law could not see it in that way. The only legal cognizance that was
  taken of the affair was that I had broken into the house of a citizen whose
  door was locked and who had insisted that I remain outside. Once inside, I
  had attacked "with intent to kill."</p>

  <p>That was the whole thing done up in a nutshell! How could I make any
  answer to it? Sam Moyer disappeared from the adventure. There only remained
  the wrong that I had done to the Ricks brothers, and nothing at all was said
  of their guilt in having offered refuge knowingly to a violator of the law
  like Moyer.</p>

  <p>"No matter what I do," I sighed to Lefty, "I get more and more in
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, kid," said Lefty. "We know, and the rest of the bunch know,
  that you're square. If the governor is a flathead, does that really make any
  difference? Look here, Porfilo; if the whole bunch in the towns and the range
  really wanted to get you, don't you think that they'd do it pretty slick and
  easy? Sure they would! But it's only the sheriffs and a few head hunters that
  go after you. The rest of the boys sit back and wish you luck. They know that
  you ain't out to bother no honest man that is mindin' his own business. You
  think they ain't took note that you make your money off the crooks and the
  thugs?"</p>

  <p>I had never thought of that before. But, as a matter of fact, I had always
  been received in a very friendly manner. I had the instance of my adventure
  in the schoolhouse dance, when half a hundred armed men had let me remain in
  a room for three minutes without raising a hand to get me. If they really
  felt that I was an enemy to society, I could not have lasted three seconds.
  They were afraid of me, naturally, because there had been so much talk, and
  because they never knew what I was going to do next, but they did not
  actually hate me.</p>

  <p>The next morning I started at once for the Crothers Canyon. I had no
  expectation of trouble from Chet. I knew that he was a high-spirited
  youngster&mdash;a great deal too high-spirited to please his family, in fact.
  But, nevertheless, there was little chance that he would be waiting in the
  canyon to fight me hand to hand&mdash;even though the mountaineers had an
  idea that that was his purpose.</p>

  <p>I rode to the edge of the canyon, however, and looked over it. Half a mile
  to the right, I saw a man sitting in the shade of a tree with his horse
  beside him, and I guessed that to be O'Rourke. I looked up and down the
  valley, but there was no sign of an ambuscade.</p>

  <p>Sheriff Lawton considered me a good deal of a fool in many ways, but even
  Lawton did not think that I would be so foolhardy as to accept such an open
  invitation as young O'Rourke had extended to me.</p>

  <p>I sent Roanoke down the bluff like an avalanche, and trotted down to chat
  with Mike's brother, if it were he.</p>

  <p>Even from a distance it was easy to see that this was the right man. For
  his hat was off and a patch of sun, dropping through the branches of the oak
  tree, shone upon a flaming red head&mdash;not the auburn hair of Mike, but
  purest flame. Certainly this was an O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>He climbed into his saddle and came to meet me, and when he drew nearer I
  was a little shocked by the look of him. He was as ugly as Mike was pretty. A
  typical "mug" was the face of Chet O'Rourke. He came to me with a vast grin,
  and his hand stretched out.</p>

  <p>"Some of these birds in the mountains around here," said he, "figger that
  I'm layin' out to get a crack at you, Porfilo. But I ain't a fool. I hope you
  figgered that none of that talk started with me?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't think that," said I. "But I wondered what I could do for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"For me, you could give me a chance to have a slant at you. It's worth
  while! Lemme see the backs of your hands!"</p>

  <p>I wondered at him a little and held them out to him, one by one&mdash;big,
  shapeless paws they are to this day.</p>

  <p>"Dog-gone my heart!" said Chet O'Rourke. "I wouldn't believe it if I
  hadn't seen it for myself! I seen the faces that you put on Joe and Willie
  Ricks. I figgered that you must have slammed 'em with a club, but they swore
  that it was only your fists.</p>

  <p>"But here I can see for myself that your knuckles ain't even skinned.
  That's something worth seeing, Porfilo. What are your hands made of?
  Iron?"</p>

  <p>I felt that he was chaffing me a little, but then I saw that his foolish
  grin was caused only by his very real pleasure at being with me.</p>

  <p>"I came out," he continued, "because Mike wants to see you, and wants to
  see you bad. What shall I tell her? That you'll come back?"</p>

  <p>It was the pleasantest news that I had heard in many a day since my last
  parting with Mike. It went like a song through me.</p>

  <p>"I'll ride back with you right now!" said I.</p>

  <p>Chet O'Rourke laughed and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This plug of mine ain't no bird," said he. "I seen you come wingin' down
  into the valley a couple of minutes ago, and I know the way you travel on
  that Roanoke mule. Lawton says that the Negro that give it to you ought to be
  hanged for bein' a public nuisance!"</p>

  <p>"I'm starting now, then," said I.</p>

  <p>"So long, old-timer. I hear that Cummins is swarmin' through these parts,
  tryin' to get even with you for what you done to his man, Moyer."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said I. "I'll try to dodge Tex."</p>

  <p>He laughed joyously, as though I were having my little joke&mdash;as
  though it were most absurd to think of me trying to avoid any man or group of
  men in the world.</p>

  <p>Although I was a happy fellow to be bound for another meeting with Mike,
  yet I was thoughtful and pretty blue, riding across the hills on that day.
  For I could not help telling myself that if other people felt about me as
  young O'Rourke did, I was not a great distance away from a calamity.</p>

  <p>They had put me up on too high a pedestal, and I knew that a man cannot
  stay on the heights very long without having an excellent chance to tumble
  down and break his neck. Chance and a great deal of gossip had made me into a
  giant in the imaginings of most of the mountain folk, and the knowledge of
  how they felt made me realize more bitterly just what an ordinary fellow I
  was.</p>

  <p>I suppose that some people would have been elated; and, from time to time,
  I had been pleased myself with the respect which strong men felt for me. But
  now it was becoming a great burden. Before long, every man would regard me as
  O'Rourke did. Every other word I spoke, if it were not perfectly courteous,
  would be considered as a bit of high-handedness; and I would be surrounded by
  men who felt it was their duty to fight me to save their self-respect!</p>

  <p>It was rather an odd thing. At the very time when men were saying that I
  was invincible and heaping up instances to prove it, I felt that I had my
  back to the wall. At the very time when it was said that I feared no living
  man or group of men, I lived in constant terror of the next five minutes.</p>

  <p>Because I was in that terror, I had to practice every day. This very
  afternoon, riding hard to come to the woman I loved, I had to pause and for
  an hour and a half work until both my guns were hot, and I had fired away
  many pounds of powder and lead. I had to work from horseback at the stand, at
  the trot, and at the gallop, snapping shots at a rock fifty yards
  away&mdash;then making a trip to inspect it.</p>

  <p>I would say to myself, if I had struck it five times and missed once: "I
  have killed five men, and I have been killed once."</p>

  <p>That was the attitude that was forced upon me, and every time I gripped
  the delicately set trigger with my forefinger I told myself that I was
  shooting to kill or to be killed! When one has that attitude, one's
  marksmanship improves by leaps and bounds; but how frightful is the nervous
  strain!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; TO KILL</h2>

  <p class="first">But, by the time I reached the valley, in the cool dusk of
  the day, my spirits rose. I think it is impossible to look on the stars and
  the deep night sky without a lifting heart. Moreover, I had Mike waiting for
  me at the end of the trail!</p>

  <p>I kept Roanoke in the trees among the foothills, gnawing my lip with
  impatience while the day faded from the mountains. The upper peaks were still
  rosy, but the valley was thick with shadow when I decided to cross it. So I
  shot Roanoke away at his driving trot which swayed us over the miles like the
  sliding of water down a steep flume, effortless and soundless, for those
  hard, shuffling hoofs never flipped down against the ground like the hoofs of
  a trotting horse of hot blood.</p>

  <p>We shot up the mouth of the ravine, and I reached the accustomed trysting
  place under the trees opposite the O'Rourke house. I whistled the
  signal&mdash;and in an instant she was out of the house, and hurrying toward
  me. Half my happiness went out when I heard her calm voice:</p>

  <p>"Will you come inside, Leon? Of course, the family knows all about how
  you've been coming to see me. I had to tell dad a little while ago, you know.
  Only I want to thank you, first, for coming to me at all!"</p>

  <p>I could not answer. Such coldness was worse to me than no reception at
  all! However, I swallowed hard and set my teeth.</p>

  <p>She took me into the parlor. It was a little, square room, all full of
  bright-colored window curtains, and a little rug with huge flowers on the
  floor, and a piano in the corner, dipping down with the dip of the crooked
  floor level, and photographs of the O'Rourke ancestors framed under glass on
  the wall&mdash;men with great, flaring mustaches and girls watching the
  camera with a scared look, and two or three vases with narrow throats,
  crowded with flowers. It was all so feminine and delicate and looked so
  beautiful to me, that I hardly knew where to stand or where to sit or how to
  hold my hands.</p>

  <p>"He's here!" called Mike.</p>

  <p>A little, gray-haired woman hobbled into the doorway and smiled in a
  frightened way at me, and behind her there was a tall, blond-headed
  boy&mdash; Mike's brother, as I could tell by his face. For he had her look;
  he was not a funny cartoon of a man like Chet.</p>

  <p>"This is my mother, Leon," said Mike.</p>

  <p>She gave her hand a rub on her apron&mdash;she was ruddy from the heat of
  the kitchen&mdash;and she came to me, nodding and smiling.</p>

  <p>"Margaret has told me such a heap about you&mdash;Mr. Porfilo. I'm sure
  I'm mighty glad to see you."</p>

  <p>I loved that little, bent woman. I held her hand for a moment and wished
  that I could lift every burden from her tired shoulders. I don't know why it
  was, but I thought suddenly of the worn face and the steady eyes of Father
  McGuire. Perhaps it was because there was so much goodness in both of
  them.</p>

  <p>"And here's my brother, Tom!"</p>

  <p>The handsome blond youngster came up and gave me his hand, and all the
  while his excited eyes went over me, and up and down, measuring me, weighing
  me, noting my big hands and my bull neck and my blunt, fighting face.</p>

  <p>Why should I call him a youngster, when he was a full two or three years
  older than I? But he was a youngster, after all, in comparison. He was a
  manly chap, to be sure, but he had a smooth, well-kept look; he had that air
  about him which only a woman's care gives to a young man. His eyes were
  softer and wider than the eyes of a man who has been through the sort of hell
  that I had seen for more than two long years.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes of the sort of target practice which I gave myself every
  day&mdash;life-and-death stuff&mdash;had more actual soul friction in it than
  he had known in his twenty-two years of existence, I suppose. I looked at him
  as I would have looked at a child, but in spite of his good looks, I liked
  him less than I had liked his ugly brother, Chet. A handsome face is
  something which I can't help suspecting in a man. The sort of flattery which
  it is apt to bring him is not good for the soul.</p>

  <p>He had plenty of strength in his grip, and he used all of it, as though he
  wanted to show me how much of a man he was.</p>

  <p>I said: "Hold on, Tom! You're breaking my hand!"</p>

  <p>They all laughed at that, and Tom looked as flushed and pleased as a girl
  with a new dress or a boy with a new pair of shoes. That silly little
  compliment set him up on end. Old O'Rourke merely glanced in from the other
  room and waved his stubby pipe at me.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Porfilo," he called. "Don't let that girl of mine make you too
  dog-gone serious!"</p>

  <p>"What a thing to say!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>But, though she smiled, I could see that she didn't like that remark. She
  shooed the rest of her family out of the room, then, and closed the door
  behind them. Then she perched herself on the piano bench and frowned
  thoughtfully at me.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to sit down, Leon?" said she.</p>

  <p>I remembered myself suddenly and sat down so hard that the chair groaned
  under me. Then I grew red and hot; I was conscious, all at once, of the dust
  on me&mdash;the dust even in my long, black hair and the unwashed look I had.
  I was conscious of the heavy cartridge belt around my hips by the way the
  holsters jammed against the seat of the chair. Mike looked wonderfully clean
  and fresh and dainty&mdash;like a new-laundered frock with a bit of scent
  sprinkled on it.</p>

  <p>Then I saw that she was smiling at me with her level eyes&mdash;that
  crooked smile that drilled a dimple deep in the center of one cheek.</p>

  <p>"You're not comfortable, Leon," said she.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit!" said I.</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, "you're a baby."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am," said I gloomily.</p>

  <p>"But a nice baby," said Mike.</p>

  <p>I roused myself a little. "You got a mean way of talking down to me,
  Mike," said I. "Will you quit it?"</p>

  <p>She stopped smiling&mdash;in order to laugh.</p>

  <p>"How did you like Chet?" said she.</p>

  <p>"He's a fine chap," said I.</p>

  <p>"You're saying that to flatter me."</p>

  <p>It angered me a little, so much assurance in her. I could not help
  breaking out: "No, not a bit! What he's got is his own&mdash;and all his
  own!"</p>

  <p>"Are you very cross, Leon?" said she.</p>

  <p>"I am very cross, Margaret," said I, mimicking her as savagely as I
  could.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I've ridden all day like the devil to get to you, and I've been feeling
  like a man just half a step away from a hangman's rope&mdash;but hoping for a
  reprieve, you see! Now I get to you, and you treat me like a side show for a
  while and then like a little boy for the rest of the time. I want you to
  pretend that I'm grown up, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"I'll try to do whatever you want, Leon," said she. "In the first place, I
  want to ask you if you would do anything reasonable to avoid meeting Andrew
  Chase?"</p>

  <p>"Honestly?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me honestly."</p>

  <p>"I'd do nearly anything in the world, Mike. I don't mind saying that I'm
  afraid of that man."</p>

  <p>"I know that you're not really afraid," said Mike. "But I also know that,
  sooner or later, you two are sure to meet, and when you do there'll probably
  be a double killing. I can't imagine anything in the world beating either of
  you! Well, I've made Andrew promise that he'll leave your trail and go back
  to Mendez for six months, if you'll promise not to see me during that time. I
  sent for you today to ask you if you'd give me that promise."</p>

  <p>It was rather a startler. I blinked at Mike like a child at a school-
  teacher.</p>

  <p>"For whose sake are you doing it?" I blurted out very untactfully, and she
  grew crimson.</p>

  <p>"Because I like you both, of course," said Mike.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said I. "You want frank talk, don't you, and, talking
  frankly, I've got to ask you to see that I haven't much of a chance to live
  another six months. They're pretty hot after me."</p>

  <p>"They haven't cornered you for two years, and you know it!" said Mike.</p>

  <p>"That's all very true. But it simply means that I've used up most of my
  good luck. By the time the six months are over, the chances are about ten to
  one that I'll be under the sod or behind the bars waiting for a hanging day.
  That's talking from the shoulder. Then all that Andrew is doing is putting
  off his lucky day. Doesn't it look that way to you?"</p>

  <p>"You speak," said Mike huskily, "as if you thought I were doing a favor to
  Andrew!"</p>

  <p>The torture in me came leaping out into words.</p>

  <p>"You are!" I groaned. "You can't look me in the eye and tell me that you
  don't love him!"</p>

  <p>"It's not true!" breathed Mike. "I don't love him, Leon! I swear I
  don't!"</p>

  <p>"What are you so white about, then?" I snarled down at her. "What scares
  you so much? It's his safety that you're worrying over. It's Andrew that
  you're thinking about!"</p>

  <p>She was shaking like a dead leaf and clinging to my big hands.</p>

  <p>"Leon, dear," she said, "once you said that you loved me!"</p>

  <p>"I said it once, and I said the truth. I'll always love you!"</p>

  <p>"Then you won't want to kill me with grief. You're too big and too strong
  for that, and big, strong men are generous!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you want," I asked heavily, for I saw that the worst was
  coming. "I want you to swear that you'll not hunt him down."</p>

  <p>"Tell me the truth first."</p>

  <p>"What truth?"</p>

  <p>"That you love him!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes closed, and on her white face came a smile that made it beautiful
  in spite of her fear and her grief.</p>

  <p>"I do love him with all my heart!" said she.</p>

  <p>I brushed her away from me. Oh, if I could leave this thing unwritten!</p>

  <p>"Curse him!" said I. "He's broken my life once and hounded me away from my
  home. Now he's sneaked into your heart and taken you away from me like a
  dirty thief. Hunt him down? I'll have him in my hands and kill him before the
  world is two days older!"</p>

  <p>I started for the door. She threw herself in front of me with a scream and
  tried to hold me back, and a wild babbling of words stumbled from her lips. I
  brushed her aside again and rushed into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Something told me that Andrew Chase must know that I was to interview Mike
  on this night, and that he would come before long to hear the result of the
  talk. Perhaps that movement of the lamp behind the parlor window even now was
  a signal to him. I waited in the shadow of a hedge, for I was frozen with
  anger.</p>

  <p>I was not wrong. I knew the step of Andrew Chase long before I had a sight
  of him. The moon rode high behind a thin masking of wind-driven clouds, and
  now and again she dipped down through a crevice between clouds and gave the
  earth a flash of silver light. By such a flash as this I saw Andrew as he
  stepped through the gate. He was not a yard away as I rose beside him with my
  gun leveled.</p>

  <p>He did not so much as start; neither was he foolish enough to attempt to
  master that weapon or touch his own. For if he had made such a foolish move
  he would have died, surely. There was no more mercy in me than in a
  stone.</p>

  <p>He said simply: "You want to take it out on me, I see."</p>

  <p>"Turn around and walk across the street and through the trees," I
  commanded him.</p>

  <p>"Is it to be a more private murder?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>But he turned and walked as I bade him across the soft, thick dust of the
  street and into the shade of the trees. Roanoke snorted in recognition of me
  and fell in behind my heels. I directed Andrew through the dark of the forest
  for a full half mile, climbing up most of the time until we came to a place
  which I had seen before.</p>

  <p>It was as perfectly arranged as though it had been planned for a battle.
  For thirty yards square the ground was covered with short, even grass. The
  sheep from the village knew that place and kept it eaten down as trimly as
  though a lawn mower worked regularly across the surface.</p>

  <p>The heavens were with me. The wind, increasing in the upper sky and
  swinging to a different direction, I suppose, though there was only a soft
  breeze among the trees, scoured away the clouds, and now the clearing was
  awash with a brilliant moonlight almost as keen as day. Men who have not
  lived in the high mountains have no thought how clear moonlight can be!</p>

  <p>"Now," said I, as I halted Chase, "how shall we fight?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," said he, though I think he started a little in relief as
  he discovered that it was to be a fair fight, after all, "my dear fellow, it
  makes not the slightest difference to me. Choose your own favorites. Whatever
  you choose, you are a dead man, Porfilo, if you dare to stand up to me!"</p>

  <p>I more than half believed him. It was only the thought of what I was
  losing in Mike that nerved me. I had been half mad on the night that sent me
  lurching into the cabin of Ricks. I was half mad now, I suppose, with a cold
  ecstasy of battle fury working in me.</p>

  <p>"I think you are lying," said I. "You have never handled a knife in your
  life. Would you stand up to me with knives, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated the split part of a second. "With the greatest pleasure,"
  said he.</p>

  <p>I laughed&mdash;a sound that jarred even on my own ears. "A bigger lie
  than before?" said I. "I throw a straight knife, Andrew. Will you admit that
  you are not ready for that sort of work?"</p>

  <p>"Well, curse you," said he, with a touch of heat, "I admit it, then. The
  knife is not a fit weapon for a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"But scoundrelly blackmail and bribery is," said I. "To buy a gunman to
  hunt down another man" I could not continue.</p>

  <p>"You really seem to believe that fable," said Andrew, without apparent
  concern.</p>

  <p>"I do believe it," said I, but seeing him standing so straight and tall,
  and hearing his calm voice, a great deal of my surety in that matter left me.
  "But what else shall it be? You wear a gun, and I wear a gun. Do you wish to
  have it a matter of revolver play, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said he. "That will be perfect!"</p>

  <p>"We would have to stand within thirty yards," I warned him, "and at that
  distance I could not miss."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to take my chances," said he, as quietly as ever.</p>

  <p>"Have you done your hours of practice every day?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Hours?" said he, with a little start. "However, I am perfectly prepared
  for you, my friend. You cannot talk me out of it!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, Andrew," said I, "there was a day when you knocked me
  senseless."</p>

  <p>"You would never dare to stand to me, hand to hand," said he with a thrill
  of hunger in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Dare?" said I. "You shall see!"</p>

  <p>I warned him to stand quiet, and with my gun in the small of his back I
  searched his clothes and found two revolvers stowed neatly away, besides a
  small derringer that hung around his throat. Certainly he had been prepared
  for me!</p>

  <p>I took them from him and threw them into the brush. Then I stripped off my
  own guns and my cartridge belt; I jerked off my boots and tossed all in a
  heap. I found Andrew shedding his coat, and now we faced one another, and I
  saw that he was laughing by the pale moonshine. He had never seemed so
  handsome or so tall.</p>

  <p>"Porfilo! Porfilo!" laughed he. "What a jackass you are to give yourself
  into my hands like this! Mike will be delighted when she finds that I am not
  only her lover, but a hero able to kill the great Porfilo with my bare
  hands!"</p>

  <p>"Save your breath," said I, "because you'll need it. Only, Andrew, I wish
  that you would tell me the truth of one thing. It will do no harm to speak
  it, because only one of us will quit this place alive. Did you or did you not
  bribe Turk Niginski to murder me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I not tell you?" said he. "Of course I bribed him. If I had
  not, my foolish brother would have jumped into his grave trying to get even
  with you for the beatings you had given him."</p>

  <p>"There was some other reason, Andrew," said I, with a bit of emotion in my
  throat. "I tell you no man in the world is such a complete devil that he
  would ruin the life of a boy of eighteen like that and drive him into danger
  of his life as you did!"</p>

  <p>"How could I tell," said Andrew, frowning, "that Niginski would not only
  be beaten, but that his gun would disappear so that you could be charged with
  murder instead of self-defense?"</p>

  <p>"But when that did happen, you let me go before the jury. You would have
  let them hang me, Chase, and never have lifted a hand to save me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I have accused myself and ruined my own life for the sake of a
  mongrel greaser?" said Andrew scornfully. "You have no sense of proportion,
  my lad. A gentleman has a certain debt of self-respect owing to himself!"</p>

  <p>He had maddened me so that I leaped in at him with my hands open and my
  arms extended like any fool confident in his brute strength, but the fist of
  Andrew, like a straight-aimed rifle bullet, shot against my face.</p>

  <p>It was a sledge-hammer stroke with all his weight behind it, and it rocked
  me back on my heels and sent me staggering. The whole side of my face turned
  numb and a wave of black mist rushed across my brain. Nausea seized the pit
  of my stomach. Never before had I felt such a blow!</p>

  <p>Yet Andrew seemed more amazed than I. I suppose he had used that terrible
  right hand of his enough to feel that it was a sword of fire before which
  everything must go down; and now he saw me standing, though sadly staggered,
  to be sure.</p>

  <p>He hesitated and lowered his arms for a single instant.</p>

  <p>"My Lord," said he, "you're not down!"</p>

  <p>Then he leaped at me like a tiger. I say that he leaped, because of the
  speed with which he came, but there was no blindness in his rush. He moved
  rather like a stalking cat than a springing one&mdash;as smooth as a dancer,
  incredibly light and quick, he darted in, always poised, his left arm well
  extended, jabbing me back and breaking down his guard, his grim right hand
  poised for the finishing stroke.</p>

  <p>It would have been the end of me, I have no doubt, had he followed up his
  first advantage sooner, but his moment of pause had allowed my head to clear.
  I was in perfect trim. My life in the raw, clear mountain air, my days of
  hard riding and climbing, had turned me to flexible iron. When he loosed his
  right hand for the flooring punch, I had my wits about me enough to block
  it.</p>

  <p>It was like raising one's arm against a flying battering-ram. The weight
  of that blow bruised the flesh of my forearm and raised a great swollen place
  on it, and the force of even that partially blocked stroke was sufficient to
  turn me half around. Then I fell in on him, ducked low, and got my two arms
  around his middle.</p>

  <p>I locked them, and turned loose all the strength of nerve and body. I felt
  belly and ribs sink in under that pressure. The hands of Andrew Chase began
  to beat and tear blindly at my head.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;Lord!" I heard him gasp. "Fair
  fight&mdash;fists&mdash;Porfilo!"</p>

  <p>I loosed him at once, and cast him away. I had had him on the verge of
  helplessness, and with the taste of that power in my heart&mdash;the wild,
  sweet taste of it&mdash;I thought that I should go mad with joy. The blood
  was running down my face from his first blow, and that side of my face was
  swelling rapidly and painfully, but I laughed like a drunkard.</p>

  <p>"You're beaten, Andrew!" said I. "Get down on your knees and beg for
  mercy, and I'll let you live if you swear to leave the mountains and Mike
  forever!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE FIGHT ENDS</h2>

  <p class="first">He stood on the verge of the clearing, one hand resting
  against a sapling, his head fallen, dragging in breaths with a painful sound,
  and I let him get his wind again. It came back to him suddenly. His body
  swelled again to its full heroic size.</p>

  <p>"Who would have thought it?" gasped out Chase. "Like an infernal bear! But
  you've had your last fling at me, my dear fellow. You'll never come within
  grip of me again!"</p>

  <p>I had no intention of making it a wrestling match. For, since I had closed
  with him, the last fear of Andrew left me, and there remained only a vast
  confidence in my strength. If he wished straight fighting, stand up and fist
  to fist, he could have his desire. But now I went at him more coolly, with
  all the skill that Father McGuire had taught me in the old days in my
  mind.</p>

  <p>He struck and danced away, and I waded in, taking heavy punishment. I was
  not slow, but he was a will-o'-the-wisp. You have seen a dragon fly darting
  back and forth in the air of the garden, stopping in mid-drive and shooting
  back again without pause? Imagine two hundred and twenty pounds of dragon fly
  and you will have an idea of the uncanny grace and speed of Andrew Chase as
  he fought for his life.</p>

  <p>Twenty times I smashed at him with all my power, and twenty times my huge
  fists plowed through the air while he side-stepped like a dancer and cuffed
  me with long-ranging punches. They cut my face as though he wore a knife edge
  across his knuckles, but he could not stun me or put me down; I was watching
  him too closely for that and playing for one opening&mdash;one opening.</p>

  <p>I found it at last. He had flung up his guard a little in jumping back,
  and I brought a long right fairly under his heart. It dropped him upon his
  knees and jammed the breath out of his lungs with a great, loud gasp. There
  he hung, swaying, propped on one muscular arm, the other clasped about the
  hurt place.</p>

  <p>"Have you had enough, Andrew?" I panted.</p>

  <p>For answer he forced himself slowly to his feet and squared away, his face
  contorted with pain, but his guard still stiff and high. I rushed him, and
  the body blow had sapped the strength of his knees. I broke through that long
  guard and thudded a short blow against his chin. It snapped back his head as
  though his neck were broken and sent him reeling to the edge of the
  clearing.</p>

  <p>Yet I backed away. I did not want to finish a half-stunned, weakened
  man.</p>

  <p>"Take your time out," I advised him. "Take your time out and be easy with
  it! I don't want to beat a cripple!"</p>

  <p>He had come up with a jar against a tree, and there he leaned with his
  head fallen back, his knees turned to water, his arms sagging at his side. I
  could have killed him with a blow, but, instead, I stood back and tasted the
  sweet relish of his helplessness with a brutal joy.</p>

  <p>He must have remained there a full minute, and I could see the life begin
  to return to him; watch his knees hardening; see his chest swell with breath
  and power; note the lifting of his head. Then he leaped suddenly back at me
  and, before I was prepared, had clipped me across the jaw with a swinging
  blow. A little nearer the point of the chin and I should certainly have gone
  down immediately.</p>

  <p>There was something treacherous about this tigerish attack, after the
  excellent fair play which I had given him, that maddened me. I damned him for
  a yellow dog and ran at him again. Twice I missed him with blows that would
  have stretched him senseless, I know. But as I drove at him a third time he
  stepped neatly and courageously inside my arm and whipped up his right hand
  of flame to my chin.</p>

  <p>Like flame, indeed! A shower of sparks exploded before my eyes and I
  reeled backward, striking blindly to protect myself from him. His cry of joy
  was like the yelp of the wolf as it sees the bull totter. He came in lunging,
  desperately eager. Right and left he clipped me. I felt as though hammers
  were thudding against the base of my brain. My knees suddenly unsnapped and
  went loose. I was sinking toward the ground. My outstretched hands clutched
  at his body, but there was no strength in them. The numbed fingertips slid
  away, and I dropped upon my face.</p>

  <p>I suppose that it was only an instant of unconsciousness. Then a ripping
  pain across my face forced me back to life. Andrew, who had pleaded for fair
  play; Andrew, who had begged for a stand-up fight, had gripped the back of my
  neck in both hands and was beating my face against a rock.</p>

  <p>This was for life, indeed!</p>

  <p>I twisted my body with all my force, and the suddenness of the move broke
  his grip. I reached for his arm and caught it with the power of a
  hard-screwed vise; with so much power that he cried out in fear and tore
  himself away. His own effort half lifted me to my feet, and I flung myself at
  his throat.</p>

  <p>He retreated desperately before me, and there was terror in his face
  because of the silence of my fury and because by this time I suppose that my
  torn and bleeding face was a frightful thing to see in that white
  moonshine.</p>

  <p>Twice, as he sprang back before my lunges and struck out, I saw him cast
  jerking glances over his shoulder, and I knew that he was prepared to take to
  his heels in another moment. I leaned in against a rain of blows that had all
  his power behind them, but there was no feeling in my body now. I walked
  through those flying fists as though they had been lightly stinging drops of
  water, and set my grip on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>He could not break it. I felt the corded and writhing strength of that
  shoulder play beneath my hands as he strove to fling himself clear, and then
  I managed to clutch his other arm just above the wrist.</p>

  <p>There was death in his face then, and just before I stepped in close and
  took him in both arms, he screamed with terror, as a man might scream when he
  feels the long tentacles of an octopus thrown about him.</p>

  <p>So I laughed, close to the white face of Andrew, and then took him in my
  grip. I shook him as a cat shakes a rat, and all his body became loose.</p>

  <p>It came dimly across my battered, reeling brain that he no longer fought
  back. I slumped to the ground and sat beside him, thinking it over with a
  sort of drunken solemnity, fumbling at obvious things. This was not the joy
  of which I had told myself. There should have been the strain of hand against
  hand and muscle against muscle to the last moment. But here was a man turned
  into a worthless mass of pulp!</p>

  <p>And this was Andrew Chase, the handsome, the magnificent!</p>

  <p>I laid a hand upon his heart, at first, and felt in an instant a feeble,
  fluttering pulse. He was still alive. It did not please me. I wished him dead
  with all my soul, and I knew now that I could not finish him while he was
  helpless. But something told me, as I looked into his white face, with the
  flesh loose and fallen upon it, that he would not be able to fight, not be
  able to stand, for some days to come.</p>

  <p>I had not struck him often, but those few times had told a story. Where my
  fist had landed under his heart, withering his strength for the rest of the
  battle, no doubt the flesh was bruised and swollen. That was when the devil
  was raging hottest in me.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, here was Andrew Chase, a very sick man. What should I do
  with him?</p>

  <p>I thought of him then not as himself, but as Mike O'Rourke's man, and that
  thought started me into action. I picked up Andrew and slung him across the
  back of Roanoke. Then, steadying him with one hand, I guided the big mule
  down the hill, through the thick timber, and back to the village, and through
  the O'Rourke gate and up to their veranda itself. There I took him off and
  put him across my shoulder.</p>

  <p>As I did that I squeezed a faint groan from his lungs. The door was before
  me. I struck it with my foot, tore the lock loose, and knocked it violently
  open. Inside, Mike and her mother, with blond-headed Tom O'Rourke behind
  them, came running. Three pairs of eyes widened at me.</p>

  <p>I think that Mrs. O'Rourke fainted. At any rate, her face suddenly
  disappeared from before my dulled sight. I threw the loose body of Andrew on
  the bed.</p>

  <p>"There's your man," said I to Mike, who could neither speak nor move.
  "Take care of him. He's not dead, but he ought to be!"</p>

  <p>When she heard that he was living, it brought the life back to her. I saw
  her throw herself on her knees beside the couch. I heard her cry out to him
  and beg him to speak to her.</p>

  <p>That, in some manner, affected my knees oddly and seemed to turn them as
  lifeless as cork. I went out of that house with dragging feet. At the door, a
  strong hand took me beneath the arm. I heard the crisp voice of Chet O'Rourke
  saying:</p>

  <p>"Partner, you ain't fit to go on riding by yourself. You got to let me
  lend you a hand&mdash;come in here with me!"</p>

  <p>I could not resist. He took me to the side door of the house and dumped me
  into a chair in the kitchen, and there I lay, a very sick man in body, and a
  sicker man in soul.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; GIVING HIMSELF UP</h2>

  <p class="first">Tom O'Rourke went from the front of the house to the back,
  not of a great deal of use to anyone. It was Mrs. O'Rourke who did the most.
  I think she divided her time between us. She herself washed my wounds and
  then swabbed them with iodine that jerked me straight up in my chair and made
  me sweat with agony. It was as though I had been bathed in living fire. After
  that, she bandaged the larger cuts and plastered the smaller ones. Then she
  stood back and looked at me.</p>

  <p>"He'll do pretty well now," said Pat O'Rourke, puffing contentedly at his
  pipe. "That time the Geary boys got me down and beat me up, I was smashed
  worse'n this, I think. I went back to work the next day! But then they didn't
  hit with the weight of Andrew Chase behind their punches. He sure give you a
  dressin' down, my son!"</p>

  <p>I asked him for whisky. He brought out a bottle, and I emptied a generous
  portion of it down my throat.</p>

  <p>"This stuff is watered. It's no good!" said I.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie and a loud lie," cried the Irishman. "I know, because I made
  it myself. It'll put some life and power under your belt!"</p>

  <p>In fact, I found that I could stand up lightly enough, and that my wits
  were clearing fast. I asked for paper, pen, and ink, and when they were
  brought I wrote to Andrew Chase:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You were down and out, Andrew, when I brought you in, as
  the O'Rourkes will tell you if you don't know anything about it yourself. We
  went out to kill each other if we could, and you did your best, as you know.
  I gave you your own choice of the way you cared to fight&mdash;and that when
  I had a pistol and the drop on you. We fought your own way, and as long as
  you wanted it fists, and nothing but fists, I fought that way, as you have to
  admit. You tried to trick me and to finish me by dirty work the first time
  you got me down. I wish to Heaven that I'd finished you when the luck turned
  my way. But that's ended and over. You're alive and you have Mike to make you
  well. But as soon as you can ride a horse, I expect you to get into a saddle
  and leave this part of the country&mdash;by yourself! I expect that you'll
  never come back.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Leon Porfilo.</span></p><br>

  <p>I sealed the envelope in which I put that letter and asked Chet O'Rourke
  to see that it got to the right place. Then I thanked the family for their
  care of me, and left the house with a silence behind me.</p>

  <p>Why I was not taken within the next five minutes, I don't know, because I
  mounted Roanoke and trotted him slowly straight down the valley and then up
  the valley, and through two villages. The luck was with me simply because I
  did not care what happened to me, I suppose.</p>

  <p>I was in the high country before the next dawn, and there I spent four
  long weeks, never going out farther than to find game. Roanoke grew fat and
  lazy. My wounds healed. Only a scar was left, red and angry, beside my right
  eye, and another over the left cheek, where I had felt the full force of one
  of Andrew's terrible blows, splitting the flesh away to the bone.</p>

  <p>It was the lowest ebb of my entire life. Sharp summer storms were combing
  those heights, and with the howling of the wind around me I used to sit hour
  by hour and ponder my life as it had been and as it was apt to be.</p>

  <p>I could see no joy before me. There seemed no purpose in an existence like
  mine, with my hand against all men and the hands of all other men against
  me.</p>

  <p>So, at the end of those two dreary fortnights, I saddled tough Roanoke
  again and rode him north toward the house of Sheriff Lawton. It was such a
  storm as on that first night, two years and more before, when I had first
  reached his place and had entered it blindly to seek shelter. The cold of the
  wind made the newly closed scars on my face ache. Pain of the body was
  nothing to me then, however.</p>

  <p>What made me cache Roanoke among the trees near the house I don't know,
  when I fully expected that I should never have a use for him again. But
  there, at any rate, I left him.</p>

  <p>I went up to the front door of the sheriff's house. There was a sharp
  burst of laughter just as I came, and I felt, somehow, that society was
  having its mirth at my expense. Well, I was worth laughter, in my own eyes,
  as well as those of any other man.</p>

  <p>I knocked heavily at the door and waited. It was opened by the sheriff
  himself. I heard him draw his breath through his teeth with a hissing sound,
  as he reached for his gun.</p>

  <p>"There's no need of that, Lawton," said I. "I've come to give myself up.
  I'm tired of the game!"</p>

  <p>He hung over me for a moment, studying me and saying never a word. Then he
  stepped outside into the night with me and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"You foller me," said Lawton, and led the way around the house to a side
  door, and through that door into his own room.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," said he, and went out to speak to the others.</p>

  <p>I could hear their voices raised in good-natured protest. These neighbors
  of his had ridden too far to relish a sudden end to the evening's
  entertainment. However, presently they were cleared out. Lawton appeared at
  the door of his room and beckoned me out into the living room, where I found
  the wreaths of tobacco smoke still hanging in the air.</p>

  <p>The sheriff pointed to a chair by the stove. But I preferred to walk up
  and down the room, talking as I went.</p>

  <p>"I'm through, Lawton," said I. "I'm finished. I've come in to"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said the sheriff. "Take your time. There ain't anything
  gained by r'arin' around like this! Take your time. Lemme know what doctor
  sewed you all up? They said that Chase cut you up like he'd used a
  knife!"</p>

  <p>In place of answering I asked, with a faint flare of interest: "Where is
  Chase?"</p>

  <p>"In bed at the O'Rourke house," said the sheriff. He grinned in spite of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"In bed!" cried I. "Still? What was wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>"What was wrong with him?" murmured Lawton. "Aw, nothin' in particular.
  Any full-growed, man-sized man ought to of throwed off what was botherin'
  him. Except that the broken jawbone, it didn't knit any too quick. I guess
  because he was tryin' to talk too much."</p>

  <p>"Broken jawbone?"</p>

  <p>"I aim to guess that you're sort of surprised," said the sheriff with a
  deep sarcasm. "You figgered that you was just playin' around and sort of
  shadow boxin', I suppose&mdash;not really hittin' in earnest. But maybe
  Andrew's bones is sort of brittle. Because he's been troubled a mite with a
  pair of busted ribs, too."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!" cried I.</p>

  <p>"Most likely you don't," said he, "seein' as all you was doin' was sort of
  huggin' him a little by way of brotherly love. What? But that's what
  happened, just the same. Besides, his innards was shook pretty general, and
  the doctor figgers that another month in bed ain't gonna be any too much for
  him. That's the latest report that come up this way. His fever is gone,
  though."</p>

  <p>It would have stretched any credulity to have felt that the results of the
  few solid blows I landed upon Andrew could have been so terrible. But I think
  that grief and rage worked together in me that night and turned me into more
  of a devil than a man.</p>

  <p>The sheriff went on, as I mused:</p>

  <p>"He was shook up so bad, as a matter of fact, that he talked a pile while
  he was delirious. Seems that he talked too much, in fact. When he gets onto
  his feet I dunno but that he may have to do a little talkin' in front of a
  judge and a jury!"</p>

  <p>I gaped in earnest this time. "A jury? Andrew Chase? What the devil has he
  done?"</p>

  <p>"Him?" murmured Lawton. "Why, hardly anything. He just played a quiet
  little sort of a joke one day. It didn't amount to nothin'. He just opened up
  and told about how he bought up the services of a gent named Niginski to go
  gunning for a thick-headed kid down in Mendez by the name of&mdash;lemme
  see&mdash; Porfilo was the name&mdash;maybe a greaser, by the sound of that
  name!"</p>

  <p>His glance twinkled at me. I was too happy to take fire at the "greaser"
  implication.</p>

  <p>"Lawton," I said, "then I'm clear! They've taken the whole thing off my
  head, and I'm a free man! Now I thank the Lord that"</p>

  <p>"Free?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"There's the killing of Crane and Rudy Brown."</p>

  <p>"Professional gun fighters, as every one in the mountains knows&mdash;with
  more murders on their records"</p>

  <p>"What does that matter? They weren't in jail&mdash;they weren't accused of
  nothing! They were hunting an outlaw by the name of Leon Porfilo, who
  resisted arrest and shot 'em down!"</p>

  <p>I merely groaned. Then: "No jury would ever convict me for such things!"
  said I.</p>

  <p>"D'you think so? Don't bank on it, though. Some juries are hard-boiled, I
  tell you! Particularly they're sort of set against burglary and the busting
  into of honest folks' houses."</p>

  <p>"You mean the Ricks brothers? They were sheltering a bank robber, sheriff.
  You know that!"</p>

  <p>"Were they? Did that give you&mdash;a dog-gone outlaw&mdash;the right to
  smash in on 'em? Did you have a warrant for an arrest, maybe? Did you have a
  warrant for assaultin' and batterin' three kindhearted gents sittin' peaceful
  around their fire?"</p>

  <p>"Lawton, you're joking."</p>

  <p>"I hope I am," said Lawton with a wonderful kindness. "I hope I am, son.
  There's nothing I'd rather have than to see you clear. But you've raised a
  pretty high smoke in your day. You've made a name that's been hot as hell in
  these parts. You've made enough trouble to get the governor worried and made
  him burn up the wires talkin' to his sheriffs and tellin' them what he thinks
  of the way they get crooks in the mountains. For two years you've lived and
  lived high off of stolen money!"</p>

  <p>"Money that other crooks stole and, that I took out of their pockets. I've
  never taken a penny from an honest man. I can prove that, too!"</p>

  <p>"No matter who took it first, you did the spending of money that didn't
  belong to you."</p>

  <p>"Will they look at it like that?" said I faintly. "Well, I'll go down and
  face the music."</p>

  <p>"I don't know how they'll look at it," said the sheriff as kindly as ever.
  "You'd be surprised at what a lot of fool talk there is goin' around about
  you since it was found out that that yaller cur, Chase, double-crossed you
  and put the blame of the murder of Niginski on your head. There's some that
  don't do nothin' but hike around the country makin' speeches to the boys
  about you.</p>

  <p>"There's old Cam Tucker. He's makin' himself plum ridiculous the way he
  carries on. Accordin' to him, he never knowed but one real honest man in his
  life, and that man goes by the name of the outlaw, Leon Porfilo. There's
  others near as bad, includin' a sheriff that I could name," he concluded,
  "that's spent a lot of hossflesh and cussin', in his day, tryin' to nab
  you."</p>

  <p>"God bless you, Lawton," said I.</p>

  <p>"But now," said the sheriff, "what you're gonna do is to lie low and wait
  for advice. We're gonna see what the governor might do in the way of a
  pardon. Yes, sir, we're gonna try to clear you up pretty fine. In the
  meantime I refuse to make this here arrest, partly because you ain't of age,
  and partly because you ain't showed good sense in comin' down to tempt an
  old, broken-down man like Sheriff Lawton. Now get the devil out of here and
  wait till I send for you!"</p>

  <p>I went, dizzy, but happy.</p>
