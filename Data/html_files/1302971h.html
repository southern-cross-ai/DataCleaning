  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. -- A MURDEROUS PLOT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE sun sank, red and sullen, behind the tossing waters of
  the Bay of Bengal, and the lights of the yacht <i>Georgia A.</i> flashed on
  as the night descended with tropical suddenness.</p>

  <p>Under the gay canopy which shaded the foredeck an after-dinner bridge game
  was in progress. The four who played were Harry Trevor, American millionaire
  sportsman and owner of the yacht, a tall, dark-haired man in his early
  forties; Georgia Trevor, his stately, Titian-haired wife; and their guests,
  Don Francesco Suarez and Doña Isabella, from Venezuela.</p>

  <p>Leaning over the stern rail side by side, but with eyes sullenly aloof
  from each other, and no thought for the beauty of the Indian night, were Jan
  Trevor and Ramona Suarez. Like his father, Jan was tall and broad-shouldered,
  yet he had the auburn hair and blue eyes of his mother. And instead of the
  stiff, military carriage of the elder Trevor, his was rather the lithe,
  supple grace of a jungle animal&mdash;a grace of movement that had not been
  cultivated in any drawing-room, but had, rather, been learned from the
  ocelot, the jaguar and the puma in their native haunts. For, despite his
  immaculate tropical evening clothes and the fashionable cut of his hair, Jan
  was but six months removed from the vast trackless jungle of South America
  that had mothered him.</p>

  <p>Ramona was small and slender, a striking brunette with a slightly Oriental
  tilt to her big brown eyes, which showed that though she bore the name of
  Suarez, she was descended from a race much older than that which inhabits the
  Iberian Peninsula. Just now tears quivered on her long dark lashes, for she
  and Jan had quarreled for the first time. The quarrel had been trivial
  enough. This tall, red-headed fiancé of hers had been so attentive to her
  during the six months they had spent on their leisurely round-the-world
  cruise, that she had become piqued by his inattention of this evening and had
  spoken sharply to him.</p>

  <p>She gazed out over the water for some time in silence. Then, her mood
  softening, she turned and laid a hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Jan. What is wrong? What has come over you? Ever since we came
  within sight of this strange jungle you have paid no attention to me. You go
  about as one in a dream. Or you hang over the rail, staring, sniffing the
  air. What has happened to you?"</p>

  <p>Jan passed his hand over his eyes. "Ramona, I&mdash;I don't know. I have a
  strange feeling inside me which I cannot understand&mdash;a feeling of
  sadness. I wish I could explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You need not," she interrupted, her pride aroused. "You have tired of me,
  Jan, that is it. I know it&mdash;can tell it by your every action. It is well
  that this happened before we were married&mdash;that I found it out in time.
  I will leave you at the next port. Father, mother, and I can take a steer
  from Calcutta. Oh, I'm glad! Glad! Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>Her last words were uttered in a choking voice, and ended in a muffled
  sob. Then she turned and sprinted across the deck toward the
  companionway.</p>

  <p>With a single bound, Jan caught her, held her prisoned in his arms.
  "Ramona, please&mdash;" he begged. "You do not understand.
  I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She beat upon his breast with her tiny fists, wrenched herself free. "You
  are a brute, a beast! I hate you!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>Then she darted off and plunged down the companionway.</p><br>

  <p class="first">STANDING bewildered by this sudden change in the girl he had
  always considered so gentle, Jan waited until he heard the slam of her cabin
  door. What could he have done to arouse her so? Why should this strange
  moodiness which had seized him have so startling an effect upon her? And
  after all, what was it that had suddenly come over him upon their advent in
  these waters?</p>

  <p>He returned to the rail to ponder the perplexing problem, and while he
  pondered he gazed at the distant jungle over which the gibbous moon was just
  rising, and from which there came to him strange scents and
  sounds&mdash;strange, yet somehow vaguely familiar.</p>

  <p>First, there was the musty odor of decaying wood and leaves, which in
  every jungle is the same. There was the mingled perfume of many tropical wild
  flowers which were strange to him. And there were cat scents and cat sounds
  which he instantly recognized as such, though they were subtly different from
  those with which he had been familiar in his jungle. There were the calls of
  night birds, and somewhere a strange beast was trumpeting. Never before had
  he heard that sound, yet he instinctively knew that only an immense creature
  could make it.</p>

  <p>Jan had never heard of nostalgia, and since he had never had a permanent
  home, save a cage in a private menagerie, which he hated, it would be
  difficult to imagine him homesick. Yet the jungle was his home. The jungle
  had reared him, fed him, mothered him. And while she had taught him many
  cruel lessons, they had been more than compensated for by the freedom and
  happiness she had brought him.</p>

  <p>And so this alien jungle, which was like his jungle, yet different, had
  stirred a fierce longing in his heart, a strange, subjective yearning which
  he was unable to interpret in objective terms. He was drawn as iron is drawn
  to a lodestone, but he did not realize it. He only knew that he felt a
  strange sadness, an inexplicable longing; and that for no reason which he
  could understand, Ramona was angry with him.</p>

  <p>As he leaned morosely over the rail, a plump, brown-skinned man who sat in
  a steamer chair beside the door of the companionway, observed him closely for
  some time. Then he took a lacquered case from beneath his voluminous
  garments, selected a cigarette, and lighted it, the flare of the match
  revealing his turbaned head, his round moon-like face, and the generously
  padded proportions of his short, rotund person.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the yellow flare died down ere a small, wiry figure slunk out
  from the shadows and crouched beside the chair of the obese one.</p>

  <p>"I am here, <i>babuji</i>," he said in Urdu.</p>

  <p>The fat man did not turn his head, but whispered from the corner of his
  mouth in the same language.</p>

  <p>"The time has come to do what is to be done. See that you do it well. If
  you fail you will surely die. If you succeed you will not only acquire merit
  before your black goddess; you will be a rich man as well."</p>

  <p>"I will not fail, <i>babuji</i>."</p>

  <p>"So? Then wait here, my good Kupta, until I again strike a light."</p>

  <p>The babu rose ponderously, and tossed his burning cigarette into the
  water. Then he circled the deck and mounted the ladder to the wheelhouse,
  where the second officer, Nelson, stood watch.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, sair," he said with a profound bow.</p>

  <p>"Evening," Nelson replied with a touch of surliness. He was not a man to
  encourage familiarity from any native, educated or otherwise.</p>

  <p>"A cigarette, <i>sahib</i>?" The babu proffered his case.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," curtly.</p>

  <p>The Indian took one, placed it between his flabby lips. Deliberately he
  fished out a match.</p>

  <p>"Look, gentleman!" he exclaimed suddenly, pointing a chubby finger over
  the bow. "What is that floating in water ahead of us?"</p>

  <p>Nelson gripped the wheel and strained his eyes forward. "Don't see a
  thing," he grunted.</p>

  <p>The baba struck the match.</p>

  <p>"Right there in front of us!" he exclaimed. "Looks like an overturned
  boat."</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN the meantime, the small wiry man had been lurking in the
  shadows, waiting for the signal of the lighted match. He now sprang out and
  ran swiftly and silently toward the unsuspecting Jan, who still leaned over
  the rail. In one hand he carried a heavy slung shot. The direction of the
  breeze was such that the jungle man could not scent the approach of the
  enemy. And the roar of the propeller drowned any slight noise which might
  otherwise have come to his acute hearing.</p>

  <p>The slung shot whirled aloft, was brought down with sickening force on the
  wind-tousled red head.</p>

  <p>Jan slumped silently over the rail.</p>

  <p>His assailant stooped, caught him by the ankles, and heaved. The limp body
  turned over once, struck the waves with a great splash, the sound of which
  was muffled by the propeller, and disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>A moment later the assassin had melted into the shadows.</p>

  <p>Up in the wheelhouse, Nelson was still straining his eyes toward the moon-
  silvered water ahead. Presently he turned to the babu.</p>

  <p>"You must be seeing things," he growled. "Maybe you've got some hashish in
  those cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"Do not use hashish, gentleman," said Babu Chandra Kumar in a hurt tone.
  Covertly he glanced toward the stern rail. It was deserted. Then with an
  injured, "Good night, sair," he flung the cigarette into the water, and
  descended the ladder, whence he waddled slowly back to his steamer chair. As
  he squeezed his great bulk into that protesting piece of furniture, a voice
  came from the shadows.</p>

  <p>"It is done, <i>babuji</i>."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Kupta. I am sure that Kali will bless you. And here are your
  hundred rupees."</p>

  <p>The coins clinked softly in the darkness, and the dusky Kupta once more
  merged with the shadows.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; MAN OVERBOARD!</h2>

  <p class="first">BABU CHANDRA KUMAR remained in his steamer chair for a full
  half hour. Then he took a small teakwood box from an inside pocket. Opening
  it, he extracted a bit of betel nut which he rolled in a pan leaf with a
  pellet of lime and a cardamon seed and thrust into his flabby mouth. Closing
  the box with a snap, he replaced it in his pocket, rose ponderously, and
  waddled to the starboard rail, where he stood, expectorating red juice over
  the side and watching the distant shore line which was plainly visible in the
  rays of the rising moon.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw that for which he had been watching&mdash;a sampan with
  its sail bellying in the wind about halfway between the yacht and the shore.
  Swiftly he glanced up at the man in the wheelhouse.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his back was turned, he shouted at the top of his voice,
  "Gentleman! Gentleman! Assistance! Help! Young <i>sahib</i> has jumped into
  the water!"</p>

  <p>Nelson swung around.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he bellowed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Young <i>sahib</i>! He leaped into bay! I saw him! He will drown!"
  shrilled the babu.</p>

  <p>"Man overboard!" the officer sang out.</p>

  <p>Then he issued some swift orders.</p>

  <p>There was instant confusion on the yacht. Cries of alarm from those on the
  foredeck mingled with the ringing of bells, the roar of the suddenly reversed
  screw, and the barking of orders.</p>

  <p>The portly, red-faced Captain McGrew, who had been smoking and reading in
  his cabin, wheezed up the ladder, hastily buttoning his jacket. Harry Trevor
  and. Don Francesco dashed up the opposite ladder.</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" Trevor demanded.</p>

  <p>"It was your son, sir, according to the babu. Just now he shouted that the
  young <i>sahib</i> had leaped overboard."</p>

  <p>"Good God! Jan? It seems incredible!"</p>

  <p>"Bring her about! Break out lines and life preservers and man the rails!
  Stand by to lower a lifeboat," barked Captain McGrew.</p>

  <p>Trevor and Don Francesco hurried to the foredeck once more to join the
  ladies. As they did so, Ramona came running up, her eyes red with
  weeping.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" she asked. "I heard shouts, and the engines stopped."</p>

  <p>"The babu says he just saw Jan jump overboard," said Trevor.</p>

  <p>At this announcement Georgia Trevor went deathly white. Her husband passed
  a supporting arm around her.</p>

  <p>"There, there. Don't be alarmed," he said, trying to hide his own concern.
  "The boy is a strong swimmer. Probably just leaped overboard for a lark.
  There's no danger. We'll have him back on board in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>"But there are sharks in these waters. We saw two big ones following the
  ship this afternoon. Oh, Harry, we never should have brought him on this
  cruise. If anything has happened to him, we are to blame, because we insisted
  that he and Ramona should see the world together, before marrying."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not your fault. It is mine."</p>

  <p>It was Ramona who startled the group by this sudden assertion.</p>

  <p>"Why, Ramona! What do you mean, dear?" asked the doña.</p>

  <p>"We quarreled," she said. "I told him I would leave him&mdash;never wanted
  to see him, again. And now he has gone&mdash;gone to his death."</p>

  <p>She turned suddenly and flung herself sobbing into the arms of her foster
  mother.</p>

  <p>Standing a few feet away from the group, mumbling his quid of betel, Babu
  Chandra Kumar smiled knowingly and spat into the water.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE yacht came about with engines throbbing, then slowly
  cruised back over her former course, her searchlight sweeping the waves. A
  lifeboat was unshipped and swung out on its davits, ready to be lowered at a
  moment's notice. Men stood along the rails with life preservers, the lines
  coiled and ready.</p>

  <p>The five who stood together on the foredeck moved to the bow, where they
  anxiously scanned the water, the doña striving to reassure the sobbing girl,
  and Trevor supporting his half fainting wife.</p>

  <p>Unnoticed by the others, the babu crossed the deck to the opposite rail as
  the ship came about. But instead of futilely gazing at the water ahead, he
  kept his eyes on the sampan, which was now nosing out toward the yacht.</p>

  <p>Aided by the offshore breeze, the little sailing vessel made rapid
  progress in the direction of the yacht. And because of the reduced speed of
  the latter vessel, it had no difficulty in overhauling it.</p>

  <p>As it drew near, the babu made out a turbaned figure in white standing at
  the rail. Instantly he ran, shouting, toward the little group in the bow.</p>

  <p>"The maharaja comes!" he cried. "It is fishing boat of my master. Perhaps
  he can help us."</p>

  <p>"The maharaja!" exclaimed Trevor. "How do you know, <i>babuji</i>?"</p>

  <p>"That is his fishing vessel. And he is aboard."</p>

  <p>"That's right. He told us at Singapore that he would be fishing in these
  waters."</p>

  <p>"Ahoy the yacht," came a call from the sampan. "Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>Trevor cupped his hands as the sampan drew closer.</p>

  <p>"My son is overboard, Maharaja," he shouted. "We are looking for him."</p>

  <p>"Shocking! I'll help you search."</p>

  <p>The two vessels cruised about in the vicinity until past midnight. Then
  both hove to, side by side, and the Maharaja of Varuda came aboard the yacht.
  He was slight and slender, with an iron-gray beard, a thin, hooked nose,
  curved like the blade of a scimitar, and small beady eyes that accentuated
  his hawk-like expression. Save for his jeweled turban, his dress was English,
  even to a beribboned monocle. Two handsome Hindu boys in their native garb
  followed him over the rail.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The maharaja bent low over the hand of the heart-broken Georgia Trevor.
  "Madame, I am devastated," he said. "But do not give up hope. Your son may
  have reached the shore. I believe you told me at Singapore that he was a
  strong swimmer."</p>

  <p>"But the sharks! What could he do against those monsters?"</p>

  <p>"They are not so numerous as you might think. As soon as it grows light
  enough I'll have my men search the shore line for some sign of him."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, <i>maharaja sahib</i>, but I fear it will be
  useless."</p>

  <p>The maharaja greeted each of the others in turn, then addressed Harry
  Trevor.</p>

  <p>"We have done all that is humanly possible tonight," he said. "I suggest
  that you drop anchor here, and rest in your cabins until morning. In the
  meantime, I will go ashore and organize my men for a search of the beach as
  soon as the sun rises."</p>

  <p>"That's good of you, Maharaja," said Trevor, "but I can't remain here
  inactive. I'll go ashore with you."</p>

  <p>"I, too," replied Don Francesco. "It is maddening to think of waiting here
  and doing nothing."</p>

  <p>"Come ashore if you like, gentlemen. You will be welcome at my camp."</p>

  <p>"May humble servant come also, your highness?" asked Babu Chandra Kumar.
  "Should like to help, if your highness will permit." He paused to snivel and
  brush away a tear. "I loved young <i>sahib</i> like son and had counted on
  exalted privilege of escorting him about Calcutta."</p>

  <p>"You will probably be in the way," said the maharaja, with a disdainful
  glance at the babu's obese figure, "but come, anyway, since <i>sahibs</i>
  will not have any immediate use for your services as a guide. And bring your
  man. I have heard that he is a good <i>shikari</i>, and we may need men who
  are expert at trailing."</p>

  <p>"Kupta is very great <i>shikari</i>, your highness. Can follow trail like
  hound."</p><br>

  <p class="first">SAVE for the half dozen men who stood guard, the camp of the
  maharaja was asleep when the party went ashore. Against the dark background
  of the jungle loomed a score of huge, slate-gray shapes&mdash;elephants. A
  few had lain down, but most of them stood, shifting their huge bulks from
  side to side, clanking their leg-chains and switching grass up over their
  backs.</p>

  <p>The maharaja waved the babu and his servant to quarters among the
  <i>mahouts</i>. Trevor and Don Francesco were ushered to the richly carpeted
  and cushioned tent of his highness. Servants brought assorted liquors, soda,
  ice, cigarettes and cigars.</p>

  <p>"Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen," said the maharaja. "My tent is
  your tent and my servants are your servants. I must ask you to excuse me for
  a few moments. The elephants are restless, and I wish to inspect them. Only
  last night my most valuable elephant ran away, and Angad, her <i>mahout</i>,
  who went after her, has not returned.</p>

  <p>"We may have urgent need for the others in the morning, so it would be
  embarrassing to have any more break away tonight."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" began Trevor.</p>

  <p>"I mean," replied the maharaja, "that if we find your son has made his way
  ashore, it is possible that we may have to do some dangerous jungle traveling
  to overtake him. My trackers will find him eventually, of course, but it will
  be the elephants that will carry us and our supplies. There is no safer,
  surer mode of jungle transportation."</p>

  <p>He took a cigarette which one servant proffered in a jeweled box,
  permitted the other to light it, and, turning, left the tent. But he did not
  go to the elephant lines. Instead, he walked into a near-by tent where Babu
  Chandra Kumar sat alone.</p>

  <p>The babu rose and made obeisance.</p>

  <p>"You are sure there is no one within hearing?" asked the maharaja, glaring
  through his monocle.</p>

  <p>"Am positive, your highness," replied the babu. "Kupta is already asleep,
  and none other except guards are stirring."</p>

  <p>"Good. And now your report."</p>

  <p>"The red-headed one is dead," said the babu. "Many leagues back Kupta slew
  him and threw him to sharks, while humble servant held attention of man in
  wheelhouse. Everything was done according to your highness orders."</p>

  <p>"And you secured one of his handkerchiefs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, highness."</p>

  <p>The babu produced a silk handkerchief in one corner of which were the
  initials "J. T."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! Put it away until I signal you to produce it. But remember, it
  must be torn and bedraggled."</p>

  <p>"Humble servant will see to that, highness."</p>

  <p>"And now I have another task for you to perform. Take Sarkar, the
  <i>mahout</i>, who is about the size of the young red-headed <i>sahib</i>,
  and row along the shore to the southeast for a quarter of a mile. Then let
  him walk ashore barefooted on the sandy beach and make his way back to camp
  through the jungle, being careful to conceal his trail after he leaves the
  beach."</p>

  <p>"Your highness, being so generous, will no doubt recall that humble
  servant is poor man with large family in Howrah," said the babu. "I will
  remember," replied the maharaja. "Already you have had a thousand rupees to
  divide with Kupta. Here is another thousand for serving me faithfully until
  we reach my palace. But all this is mere expense money. Once the little dark
  eyed beauty is safely delivered into the hands of my priests, no suspicion
  attaching to me for her disappearance, a lakh of rupees shall be yours. And
  if you show sufficient cleverness and aptitude it may be that I will make you
  my deewan for life."</p>

  <p>"Your highness is most generous, indeed," replied the babu, bowing
  profoundly as the maharaja took his leave. But once the potentate had gone,
  he stuffed a quid of betel into his fat cheek and computed his possible
  profits for the journey. Already he had done Kupta out of four hundred rupees
  which were supposed to have gone to him for his assassin's work on the boat.
  The <i>mahout</i>, he felt sure, would do his part and keep silent for ten
  rupees. And for another fifty Kupta would willingly lead the assemblage
  through the jungle toward the maharaja's palace, while making it appear that
  he was trailing Jan.</p>

  <p>With a beetle-stained smile, Chandra Kumar arose ponderously and went out
  toward the elephant lines, where Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>, was sleeping.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; MAN-EATERS</h2>

  <p class="first">AS HE leaned morosely over the rail, gazing at the distant
  jungle, Jan's first intimation of danger was when something crashed down on
  his head with stunning force. Things grew blurred and indistinct, and there
  was a strange weakness in his arms and legs. He sank to the rail. Then,
  though he felt himself being lifted and heaved overboard, he was unable to
  make the slightest resistance&mdash; could not even turn his head to look at
  his unknown enemy.</p>

  <p>He splashed into the waves head-on, and went down through a seething
  maelstrom of black waters. The shock of falling into the water partly revived
  him, and he struggled feebly to reach the surface, meanwhile instinctively
  holding his breath.</p>

  <p>Presently, when it seemed that his aching lungs were about to collapse,
  his head emerged into the air. He took a deep breath, shook the water from
  his eyes, and looked about him. The yacht was already more than a quarter of
  a mile away, and rapidly widening the distance between them. To shout, he
  knew, would be useless. At his right, not more than a mile distant, stretched
  a white ribbon of moonlit beach, and behind it the mysterious jungle which
  had so intrigued him. He kicked off his oxfords and removed his mess jacket.
  Once free of these impediments, he set out for the shore with long, steady
  strokes.</p>

  <p>His head cleared rapidly as he made his way shoreward, and it occurred to
  him to wonder who had made this attempt on his life. On all the yacht, so far
  as he knew, he had not one single enemy. The captain and crew had all been
  friendly throughout the voyage. The babu and his servant, both of whom had
  graciously been lent to his father in Singapore by the maharaja, so the
  former might act as their dragoman in Calcutta, had been especially
  obsequious. His father and mother were ruled out, of course. Nor could the
  don and doña have any possible reason for wanting to do away with him. But he
  had quarreled with Ramona. She had told him their engagement was
  over&mdash;that she never wanted to see him again.</p>

  <p>Had Jan been brought up among men, he would have gained sufficient
  knowledge of human nature to be positive that the gentle Ramona, despite her
  tropical temper, would never attempt to kill him. But he had lived the
  greater part of his life in the jungle, and jungle codes were still a part of
  his nature.</p>

  <p>Ramona had told him that she hated him&mdash;had been the only one on the
  yacht who had shown any open hostility toward him. And so he concluded that
  she had suited her actions to her words and had deliberately attempted to
  murder him. It was thus that any jungle creature would do&mdash;that he
  himself would do without compunction upon sufficient provocation.</p>

  <p>The conviction brought him a greater sadness that he had ever known, for
  Ramona had come to mean more to him than life itself. And so, though he
  continued to swim onward with listless, automatic strokes, his heart was so
  heavy within him that he did not care whether he lived or died.</p>

  <p>But in times of emergency, instinct is often stronger than reason or
  emotion. And so when Jan, chancing to look back, caught the glint of
  moonlight on a sail-like fin that was coming rapidly toward him, the instinct
  to live took command of him. He doubled, trebled, and presently quadrupled
  his former speed toward the shore. But each time, on glancing back, he saw
  that the dread killer of the sea was rapidly shortening the distance between
  them.</p>

  <p>Presently, with the shore not more than a hundred yards distant, and the
  shark less than twenty feet behind him, he realized that his pursuer would be
  upon him before he could cover a third of the remaining distance. Ripping off
  his shirt, he flung it back over his head. It distracted the attention of the
  killer for a moment, during which the monster seized it and tore it to shreds
  in its razor sharp teeth. And during that moment, Jan gained a few feet.
  Taking his pocket knife from his trousers and placing it in his mouth, he
  wriggled free. Then, when the shark was a scant ten feet behind him, he
  tossed the sodden garment between them.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AGAIN the attention of the monster was distracted, and again
  Jan made a gain of a few feet. But the fish soon relinquished its tasteless
  morsel, and Jan, despite the fact that he was now making better progress than
  before, found himself being rapidly overhauled. Further flight, he saw, was
  futile, for it could only end in his being seized from behind in those cruel
  jaws. And with only a small pocket knife for a weapon, to turn and fight
  seemed equally hopeless.</p>

  <p>But turn he did, after opening the blade and gripping the knife once more
  between his teeth. The monster was so close now that he could see it
  distinctly in the moonlight. It was a large hammerhead, fully fifteen feet in
  length, the most grotesque and one of the most dangerous of all the sharks
  that inhabit the Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p>Seeing its toothsome quarry motionless, and apparently helpless, the shark
  plunged forward, opening its gleaming jaws to seize its prey. But when the
  flat snout was within two feet of him, Jan suddenly reached out with both
  hands and seized the two strange projections on each side of the monster's
  head, which gave it its name.</p>

  <p>Puzzled by such unexpected tactics, the shark plunged onward, still trying
  to reach its intended victim. But it only succeeded in pushing the jungle man
  further toward the shore with each snapping lunge. Presently, after it had
  advanced about fifty feet in this fashion, it tired of such fruitless
  endeavors, shook its head free of those gripping hands, and backed away. Jan
  seized the opportunity to retreat, swimming backward and still keeping a
  sharp watch on his enemy.</p>

  <p>It was well that he did so, for in a moment the shark darted forward once
  more, this time with lightning speed. Again Jan thrust out his hands, but
  this time, instead of merely employing them to keep his attacker away from
  him, he tightly gripped the two projections, and bearing down upon them,
  somersaulted over onto the creature's back and clamped his legs beneath the
  body just in front of the pectoral fins.</p>

  <p>The monster instantly plunged under water, turning over and over to
  dislodge him. But he held his breath, and shifting his hold to the gill
  slits, turned his body so he was facing forward. Then he again clamped his
  legs around the body, and taking his pocket knife from between his teeth,
  tried to force the puny blade into the creature's brain. The thick skull,
  however, baffled him, so he shifted his attack to the eyes, which were
  situated at the extremities of the hammer-like projections. He successfully
  gouged out first one eye, then the other, while he maintained his precarious
  seat by means of his body-scissors and the gill slits. Then he carefully felt
  for and cut the jaw hinges on each side, rendering the shark incapable of
  seizing its prey.</p>

  <p>This done, he kicked himself free of the monster, and swam for the
  surface, where he filled his aching lungs again and again. The shark broke
  water about thirty feet behind him a moment later, and he saw, to his
  consternation, that two more man-eaters were converging toward him, evidently
  attracted by the sounds of the struggle or the scent of animal blood.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE shore was now but a hundred feet distant, and without a
  moment's hesitation, Jan turned and swam for it at top speed. But to his
  surprise and consternation, the maimed shark followed him as swiftly and
  unerringly as if it had not lost its sight&mdash;evidently by scent or sound,
  or perhaps both. In the meantime, the other two sharks came in from both
  sides with tremendous speed.</p>

  <p>Jan covered fifty feet, and was again forced to turn and prepare to fight,
  but with three enemies this time instead of one. They came so swiftly that
  the last fifty feet might have been a mile, so far as his hope of escape was
  concerned. It was the most desperate situation in which he had ever found
  himself&mdash; desperate to the point of hopelessness. For what could he do
  against three such mighty enemies in their own element?</p>

  <p>The two oncoming sharks drew up beside their maimed companion, now less
  than five feet from Jan. Then an astounding thing happened. For, instead of
  assisting in the pursuit, both simultaneously attacked the wounded
  hammerhead. In an instant there was a terrific struggle, a mighty threshing
  in the boiling, foaming water.</p>

  <p>But Jan did not wait to see the outcome. Instead, he turned and once more
  struck out for the beach. A dozen powerful strokes, and he felt the sloping
  sand beneath his feet. He rose and ran splashing through the shallows. Not
  until dry sand was beneath him did he turn. The three contestants had
  disappeared, leaving only a few bubbles to mark the point of the
  struggle.</p>

  <p>By this time, the yacht was only a speck of light upon the horizon. Jan
  stood resting from his exertions and watched it until it disappeared from
  view. Then he turned toward the dark, mysterious jungle behind him. The
  breeze carried the same scents and sounds that had attracted him when on the
  yacht. But the scents were much stronger, and the sounds much plainer,
  now.</p>

  <p>For some time he stood there listening&mdash;sniffing the air. There
  remained to him only a few shreds of his underclothing, which had been torn
  in his struggle with the shark, and his pocket knife. He skilfully twisted
  the shreds into a G string and with his wet socks made a small pouch at one
  side for the knife. Then he melted silently into the shadowy depths of the
  forest.</p>

  <p>Though his tread was as noiseless as that of any jungle cat, and his eyes,
  ears and nostrils were keenly alert for danger from the denizens of this
  unknown wilderness, the jungle bred Jan made his way forward as fearlessly as
  any man born and reared in civilization would walk the streets of his native
  city.</p>

  <p>Presently, there came to him a powerful, unmistakable cat scent from close
  behind him, brought to him by a sudden shifting of the breeze. Instantly, he
  knew that a big feline of a breed new and strange to him was stalking him;
  and near enough for the charge. He turned, and caught the gleam of a great
  blinking pair of eyes.</p>

  <p>Knowing itself discovered, the beast let out a roar, and charged. But with
  an agility which equaled that of the great cat, Jan sprang for the nearest
  tree, and swung himself into the lower branches just in time to escape the
  raking claws beneath him. He quickly made his way upward, but paused in his
  climb when a low growl suddenly came from the branch above him, accompanied
  by a new cat scent and the scratching of nails on bark, which told him that
  another large feline was descending to attack him.</p>

  <p>Instantly he swung outward as far as he dared, on the limb upon which he
  was perched. Then, in a mottled patch of moonlight he caught sight of the
  descending brute against the trunk of the tree. It was jet black, with great
  yellow eyes, and about the size of a cougar.</p>

  <p>On the ground below him the moonlight revealed the striped body of a cat
  that was larger, but no more dangerous to an unarmed man, than the one that
  was descending toward him. And while the tiger gazed upward, snarling and
  expectantly licking its chops, the black fury dropped lightly to the limb on
  which Jan was balanced, and with ears laid back and tail lashing the leaves,
  crouched for a spring.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; A FALSE TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER the maharaja left the babu he did not inspect the
  elephant lines. Instead, he returned to his own tent where Trevor paced
  nervously back and forth, while Don Francesco sat in his chair and puffed
  violently at his slender, black cigar. Adjusting his monocle, the potentate
  walked to the table, sat down, and selected a cigarette which a servant
  quickly lighted for him.</p>

  <p>"Rotten go, this," he remarked. "There's nothing more we can do until
  morning. Now if it had only happened in the day time we could be doing
  things. But this beastly waiting jangles one's nerves."</p>

  <p>"It does that," Trevor agreed explosively. "Enough to drive a man
  nuts."</p>

  <p>"Quite. But you mustn't let it get you. Come. Sit down and let me be your
  doctor. I prescribe a spot of brandy."</p>

  <p>"His highness is right, <i>amigo</i>," said Don Francesco. "Worry can
  accomplish nothing. Constructive thinking and planning may help."</p>

  <p>"Of course," replied Trevor, coming to the table. "I am a fool to get
  jittery. What's needed is constructive planning, and action."</p>

  <p>Waving his servants away, the maharaja poured brandy for his guests.</p>

  <p>Trevor tasted his drink and reached for a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Do you think, maharaja, that we will be able to find Jan in the
  morning&mdash; that is if he's still alive?"</p>

  <p>"There is a strong possibility that we may," was the reply. "We can at
  least assure ourselves as to whether or not he has come ashore."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"For several miles in both directions the beach is of soft sand. My
  trackers will easily be able to discern whether or not a man has come
  ashore."</p>

  <p>"Right. But suppose he has gone on into the jungle. I have an idea that is
  the thing he is most likely to do. He grew up in the jungle, you know, and we
  all noticed that he seemed strangely attracted by this one the moment we came
  within sight of it."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the maharaja, "we must follow his trail until we can
  come up with him. My shikaris will be able to find him eventually, but it may
  take time."</p>

  <p>"There is a possibility that we may be stuck here for days,
  weeks&mdash;even months."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said the maharaja. "When we met in Singapore I did myself
  the honor of inviting you and your party to visit me. You declined then,
  because of your haste to get back to your affairs in America. However, since
  this matter has come up, it may be that you will change your mind. I flatter
  myself with the hope that you will, and all the resources of my little
  kingdom at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"You are most kind, <i>maharaja sahib</i>," said Trevor. "I declined
  before because of urgent business at home. But there can be no more urgent
  business for me than the finding of my son. If a long search for him should
  be indicated by what we find in the morning, I will gladly avail myself of
  your kind invitation."</p>

  <p>Morning dawned at last, and the camp was instantly astir with feverish
  activity. The maharaja divided his men into two parties to search the beach,
  one to go northwest, the other southeast. At his suggestion, Don Francesco
  accompanied the first party while he and Trevor went with the other.</p>

  <p>At the head of this latter group of searchers waddled the fat babu,
  accompanied by Kupta the hillman.</p>

  <p>Presently, when they had proceeded about a half a mile along the shore,
  the babu threw up his hands.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he cried. "Freshly tracks are here coming up out of the
  water."</p>

  <p>Trevor sprang forward.</p>

  <p>"Where?" he cried.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BUT a moment later, he saw them himself. The tracks of bare
  feet leading from the water's edge toward the jungle.</p>

  <p>"Jan wore shoes," he said, "but he would have kicked them off in the
  water. Probably got rid of his socks, also." He turned to the maharaja. "Do
  you think it possible that any one else might have swum ashore here?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. No one left my little boat, and so far as we are aware, nobody
  but your son left the yacht. No one with any knowledge of these waters would
  be likely to try it from any other craft because of the danger from sharks.
  Your son, it seems, has escaped them by some miracle."</p>

  <p>"Then you are reasonably certain these are Jan's tracks."</p>

  <p>"Wait. Let us make sure." He called the babu. "Have your hillman inspect
  the tracks and tell us what sort of person made them," he ordered. Then he
  turned once more to Trevor. "The things these hillmen can tell from a few
  marks in the sand are uncanny," he said.</p>

  <p>At Chandra Kumar's command, Kupta bent over the tracks. There followed a
  swift muttering in Urdu.</p>

  <p>"Shikari says these are not tracks of Indian man, but of young and
  strongly <i>sahib</i>," the babu announced.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," said the maharaja. "Take two men and go with him.
  Follow the trail into the jungle. In a half hour, send a man back to camp
  with news of what you have found on the trail. And in another half hour stop
  and wait for us, sending the second man to lead us to you. We will return for
  the elephants, and to pack."</p>

  <p>When Trevor and the maharaja got back to the camp, they found that the
  ladies had already arrived there in one of the yacht's lifeboats, piloted by
  Officer Nelson. The eyes of all three showed the effect of a tearful,
  sleepless night.</p>

  <p>"Have you learned anything?" all wanted to know in unison.</p>

  <p>"Something that gives me great hope," Trevor replied. "Tracks leading into
  the jungle. We believe that Jan is alive and somewhere nearby."</p>

  <p>"Alone and unarmed!" exclaimed Georgia Trevor. "What can he do? He will
  starve, or be devoured by wild beasts."</p>

  <p>"I doubt that he will do either," said her husband. "Jan didn't manage to
  survive in the South American jungle for many years without learning a thing
  or two. The boy will be able to take care of himself. And we may find him any
  time now. An expert tracker is already on his trail, and we will follow as
  soon as the elephants are loaded."</p>

  <p>"You will follow? But what of us? Are we to be left behind to&mdash;to die
  of suspense?"</p>

  <p>"I have two large howdahs in addition to the pad elephants," said the
  maharaja. "There will be ample room for all if you care to come with us."</p>

  <p>"But will it not be dangerous for the ladies?" asked Don Francesco.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied the potentate. "The back of a docile and intelligent
  elephant is the safest place for any one in the jungle."</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN less than a half hour the caravan was loaded and on its
  way into the jungle. The second man, who had come from Kupta and the babu,
  led the way. In the first howdah rode the maharaja with Trevor, Don
  Francesco, and a servant to take charge of the rifles. In the second rode the
  three ladies. Behind them came the loaded pad elephants. And strung out in
  two files, one on each side, walked the maharaja's retainers, armed with
  spears and large jungle knives.</p>

  <p>An hour's ride brought them to the bank of a small stream. And here,
  squatting at their ease in the dense shade of a deodar tree, they found the
  babu and Kupta, mumbling their betel and expectorating red juice at such
  unfortunate insects as chanced to wander within range.</p>

  <p>At sight of the maharaja's elephant, the babu hoisted himself ponderously
  to his feet, and the hillman sprang lightly up beside him. Then both
  salaamed.</p>

  <p>"Proceed on the trail, <i>babuji</i>," ordered the maharaja, "and see to
  it that your hillman does not lead us astray."</p>

  <p>"He will not lose trail, your highness," the babu replied. "Kupta is very
  expertly <i>shikari</i>."</p>

  <p>Taking a rusty looking old umbrella which Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>, had
  brought for him from his private kit, he raised it over his head and waddled
  off behind the wiry hillman.</p>

  <p>They followed the stream for some distance, then crossed at a shallow ford
  which seemed to have been used extensively both by domestic and jungle
  animals. The bank, which had been flattened out for more than a hundred feet
  on both sides of the stream, was indented with the tracks of elephants, deer,
  buffalo, horses and other lesser herbivores, and in the soft mud at the
  water's edge, Trevor saw the pugs of tigers and leopards. Obviously it was an
  old game trail which had come to be frequently utilized by man.</p>

  <p>Having crossed the ford, Kupta circled for a time, then struck off in a
  northerly direction. The babu lumbered heavily after him, grunting, wheezing,
  and using the greasy end of his turban from time to time to mop the streaming
  perspiration from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Trevor, to whom jungle travel was no novelty, noticed that they crossed
  and recrossed the well-marked game trail they had passed at the ford, but
  never stayed upon it for any great length of time. He concluded, from this,
  that Jan was following the trail, possibly in the hope of reaching
  civilization, or perhaps for the more primitive and necessary purpose of
  making a kill.</p>

  <p>At noon they paused at a little pool, fed by a limpid spring which
  trickled down from the rocky hillside. Scarcely had the elephants paused to
  discharge their passengers, when the babu, who had climbed up beside the
  spring for a drink of water, came rushing toward them, waving a torn, sodden
  handkerchief and shouting shrilly.</p>

  <p>"Highness! <i>Sahibs</i>! <i>Memsahibs</i>! Have found most importantly
  clue! See! See!"</p>

  <p>"What is it, <i>babuji</i>? Let me see," said Trevor, who had been the
  first to dismount.</p>

  <p>With the important air of one who has made a momentous discovery, Chandra
  Kumar handed him the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Look at initials&mdash;in corner," puffed the babu.</p>

  <p>"'J.T.,' by the gods!" exclaimed Trevor. "It's Jan's, all right."</p>

  <p>The ragged bit of cloth was quickly passed from hand to hand as the others
  crowded around, and as quickly identified. The maharaja was the last to
  examine it. He squinted at it through his monocle for a moment. Then he
  turned to Georgia Trevor.</p>

  <p>"You are positive that this is your son's handkerchief?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Positive."</p>

  <p>"Then it is time for us to crystallize our plans. We have found that h is
  traveling swiftly to the northward. If he continues, he will soon be in my
  territory, Varuda, and my palace at Varudapur will be an ideal base from
  which to conduct our search. I therefore suggest that we make camp here, and
  send two pad elephants back to the coast for any baggage you may wish to
  bring with you, instructing the commander of your yacht to take it to
  Calcutta and there await further orders. In the meantime, I will send the
  babu and the <i>shikari</i> forward on the trail, to learn whither it leads,
  and to make inquiry as to whether or not any natives they may encounter have
  seen your son."</p>

  <p>Georgia Trevor turned to her husband.</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"A splendid plan," he replied. "We accept your suggestion and invitation,
  maharaja, with pleasure and with gratitude."</p>

  <p>The potentate included all five of his guests with a courtly bow, "My
  house will be most signally honored," he said.</p>

  <p>Then he turned, clapped his hands, and issued a few swift orders. In a few
  moments the elephants were relieved of their loads, and a village of tents
  grew as if by magic. There was a large tent for the three ladies, another for
  Trevor and Don Francesco, and a third for the maharaja. All three were
  sumptuously and lavishly furnished with thick rugs, divans with spring
  mattresses, silken cushions, and embroidered hangings.</p>

  <p>As soon as the two pad elephants had been dispatched, the maharaja retired
  to his tent and sent for the babu. A few moments later, as Chandra Kumar
  wheezed in past the ornate curtains, the potentate dismissed his two
  servants. Then he beckoned the babu to him, and spoke softly in Bengali.</p>

  <p>"The first part of our plan is accomplished," he said. "The tracks of
  Sarkar deceived them, and the handkerchief proved most convincing. But there
  yet remains much to be done. What of Zafarulla Khan and his Pathan
  cutthroats? Are you sure they are encamped near here, and that you will be
  able to find them?"</p>

  <p>"Those horse-stealing malefactors would camp where I bade them until the
  British leave India, for a chance to win the princely sum which your highness
  has promised them," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Here are the five thousand rupees which you are to pay them.
  And ten thousand more await them when they deliver the girl to my priests.
  Now here is the plan in full, and it must be carried out to the letter or we
  will all be ruined."</p>

  <p>His voice dropped to a whisper, and the babu nodded and grunted from time
  to time, to show that he understood.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter Chandra Kumar rode away to the northward on a small pad
  elephant, guided by Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>, with Kupta ranging before them
  as if following a trail.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; JUNGLE TRAGEDY</h2>

  <p class="first">UNARMED and out on the end of the limb, with the black
  leopard ready to spring upon him, while the tiger waited expectantly below,
  Jan realized that he was in&mdash;grave danger. Yet he sat there calmly
  enough&mdash;waiting. Suddenly the leopard sprang. And with equal quickness,
  the jungle man dropped from his perch, swinging by his hands.</p>

  <p>The tiger roared and leaped upward at sight of the man dangling so
  temptingly above him. The leopard, unable to check its impetus, turned in
  midair and tried to grasp the end of the limb. But Jan's sudden drop had
  pulled it down out of reach, and the black feline, now squalling with fear,
  hurtled downward, straight into the waiting claws of the tiger.</p>

  <p>Jan once more swung lightly up on the limb, to watch the scrimmage going
  on in the little moonlight glade below him. He had expected to see the
  leopard instantly killed, and was therefore surprised to see that it was
  giving an excellent account of itself, falling on its back and using its
  fearful hind claws for defense each time it was attacked, while the jungle
  resounded with its spitting and caterwauling, mingled with the snarls and
  deep-throated roars of the tiger.</p>

  <p>But, though he would have enjoyed seeing the conclusion of this jungle
  battle, it suddenly came to him that this was his golden opportunity for
  making good his escape. So he swung away through the interlaced branches and
  vines as easily as any arboreal ape&mdash;and far more swiftly. In a few
  moments all sounds of the battle died behind him, and the normal night cries
  of the smaller jungle inhabitants, which fear had stilled in the battle area,
  were resumed.</p>

  <p>For mile after mile he swung along with tireless, effortless ease. And
  many and varied were the jungle scenes that unfolded beneath him. Once he
  passed quite near to a herd of elephants, feeding&mdash;great ponderous hulks
  in the moonlight, tearing off branches with their sinuous trunks and munching
  the leaves and twigs. Presently one of them trumpeted, and he identified the
  sound he had heard from the yacht.</p>

  <p>Farther on he disturbed a tribe of rhesus monkeys in their leafy
  dormitory, and departed followed by their chattered imprecations. Later, a
  skulking leopard passed beneath him, its spots showing plainly in the
  moonlight, reminding him of the jaguars of his South American jungle.</p>

  <p>Presently he came to a large tree in which a pair of peafowls roosted. The
  hen roused at his approach and flapped swiftly away through the jungle. But
  the cock awoke too late. He grasped it by the neck, took out his pocket
  knife, and in a few moments was feasting on its raw, warm flesh. Again he was
  reminded of his native jungle, and of the many curassows he had eaten in this
  same manner.</p>

  <p>Having satisfied his hunger, he swung off once more, looking for water to
  quench his thirst. Presently he reached a tree that overhung a small stream.
  He was about to descend when a huge striped form slunk out of the shadows
  beneath him. The tiger waded into the stream up to its sagging belly and
  stood there lapping the water.</p>

  <p>Presently it lay down, wallowing in the shallows. Weary of waiting, Jan
  presently grew sleepy. He decided to defer his drink until the morrow, so
  searched out a convenient crotch, curled up, and was soon asleep.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE jungle man was awakened by a shaft of orange gold
  sunlight which, penetrating his leafy canopy, struck him full in the face. He
  arose, stretched, and looked down at the scene beneath him. The tiger was
  gone, but its huge pugs were plainly visible in the soft gravelly bank.</p>

  <p>Thirsty as he was, Jan swung through the neighboring trees and made a
  careful survey of all the nearby thickets before he descended. The water was
  warm, but clear and sweet, and he noticed that a little farther out there
  were flat rocks in the stream bed. This gave him an idea; so, after he had
  satisfied his thirst, he waded out into the stream and looked about until he
  had found a hard flinty stone which roughly resembled a double-bitted ax
  head. Deftly he chipped away at it until he had two ragged cutting edges and
  a groove down the center on both sides.</p>

  <p>This done, he cut a straight limb from an ironwood tree, shaped it into a
  stout haft with his knife, and after splitting one end, bound the head in
  place with strips of tough fibrous bark torn from a vine.</p>

  <p>When his work was finished the sun had passed the meridian, but he had a
  stone ax as good as had ever been wielded by neanderthal man. More strips of
  bark, plaited together, formed a shoulder strap from which he slung his heavy
  weapon. And primitive though it was, it gave him a feeling of confidence, for
  he knew that sooner or later he must fight it out with the great carnivores
  of this jungle, and the weapon would help to counterbalance their superiority
  of tooth and claw. Indeed, he was more than a little anxious to try
  conclusions with the next tiger or leopard that might come this way, as he
  always preferred fight to flight, where there was anything approaching an
  equal chance.</p>

  <p>Jan had been so engrossed in the making of his weapon that he had
  forgotten all about food. Now, however, his empty stomach began to remind him
  of his negligence. And the sight of a school of fish moving lazily through
  the shallows quickened his appetite. In a clump of bamboo near by he found a
  pole that had been broken off by the passage of some heavy animal, and was
  quite well seasoned. After trimming off the branches and cutting it down to
  the required length, he split the segment at one end into four pieces, which
  he held apart by means of crossed sticks bound with bits of bark. After
  sharpening the four ends he took his fishing spear to the stream and soon had
  three fat fish gasping on the bank.</p>

  <p>He crouched beside his catch, ate them raw, and after a long, satisfying
  drink from the stream, proceeded along the bank. He had followed the stream
  for some distance when, upon rounding a sharp turn, he suddenly came face to
  face with a huge, leather-armored beast with a horn on its snout, wallowing
  in the mud.</p>

  <p>With an angry snort, the rhinoceros scrambled to its feet and charged. Jan
  hurled his spear straight at the monster's lowered head and, turning, sprang
  up the bank. He caught hold of a stout vine and scrambled up hand over hand,
  just in time to escape the earth-shaking charge. The bamboo spear, instead of
  checking the brute, had only served to infuriate it, and it rooted angrily at
  the base of the tree, gouging out great chunks of bark.</p>

  <p>But the jungle man did not remain in that tree. Instead, he resumed his
  journey, keeping to the trees and vines which overhung the stream. He
  traveled thus until the sun hung low on the horizon. Then there came to his
  sensitive nostrils the pungent smell of wood smoke, and something
  else&mdash;the strong, scent of tiger.</p>

  <p>Cautiously, soundlessly, he swung onward, and in a moment saw the source
  of the smoke. A brown man, naked save for the dhoti about his loins, and his
  turban, was bending over a small cooking fire. With him was a brown boy
  similarly attired, who had just brought up an armful of wood and was starting
  out for another. Jan saw that the man was stirring something in a small
  kettle over the fire, that a large, double curved knife hung at his side, and
  a long spear lay near at hand. A few feet from the fire was a crude shelter
  of bamboo thatched with leaves.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE boy walked straight toward the tree in which the jungle
  man was perched. In his right hand he carried a knife, double-curved like
  that of the man, but smaller, and with this, as he came beneath the tree, he
  began cutting bits of underbrush for firewood.</p>

  <p>At this instant Jan discovered the source of the cat scent. A huge
  tigress, taking advantage of every bit of available cover, was noiselessly
  stalking the boy&mdash;was at that moment not thirty feet from him.</p>

  <p>Swiftly the jungle man dropped from limb to limb. To shout a warning to
  the boy he knew would be useless. The great cat would have him before he
  could run ten feet. As Jan reached the lowermost limb the tigress uttered a
  rumbling growl and charged. The boy stood rooted to his tracks by terror.</p>

  <p>Lightly the jungle man dropped between the charging feline and its prey,
  his stone ax ready for action. The tigress paused for an instant, then seeing
  that only a man faced her, charged forward with renewed fury.</p>

  <p>Jan waited until she reared up on her hind legs to seize him. Then he
  swung his stone ax with a circular motion that caught the brute a terrific
  blow on the side of the head. The jagged stone struck between eye and ear
  with such force that the eye popped out of its socket and the beast was
  bowled over on her right side.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1302971h-images/JanInIndia-04.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Roaring with fury, the tigress scrambled to her feet and renewed the
  attack. This time Jan clouted her on the other side of the head, again
  knocking her off balance and rolling her over and over. Half dazed, she lay
  still for a moment, and the jungle man rushed in for the finishing stroke.
  But the tigress was far from dead, though she was now reduced to fighting
  defensively.</p>

  <p>Throwing herself first on one side, then the other, she succeeded in
  warding off the blows from her head and body with her raking claws, and also
  in inflicting several deep gashes upon her enemy.</p>

  <p>At this juncture Jan heard a shriek from the direction of the camp. From
  the tail of his eye he saw beside the fire the naked brown man struggling in
  the jaws of a tiger, evidently the mate of the beast he was fighting. The
  tigress, however, was still very much alive, so much so that the jungle man
  dared not turn away or relinquish the advantage he had gained. To do so would
  have meant almost certain death.</p>

  <p>When next he was able to look toward the camp fire he saw that it was
  deserted. A moment later a childish voice that shook with terror sounded
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"I have brought my father's spear for you, <i>sahib</i> ."</p>

  <p>"Give it to me."</p>

  <p>The spear was thrust around in front of him.</p>

  <p>Jan dropped the ax and seized it. In a moment he had plunged the long
  steel blade through the heart of the snarling carnivore, pinning her to the
  ground; and in another, she had relaxed in death.</p>

  <p>The jungle man turned and looked at the small brown boy, who stood with
  tears coursing down his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"O great <i>shikari</i>, O mighty hunter," he quavered. "The other
  <i>bagh</i> has carried off my father. Perhaps he still lives. Will you kill
  it also, and save him for me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try," Jan promised.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE wrenched the spear from the carcass of the fallen
  tigress, took up his stone ax, and slung it from the carry strap. Then he
  hurried to the camp fire. The trail left by the man-eater was plain enough.
  The brute had bounded away with great twenty-foot leaps, carrying the man as
  easily as a cat carries a rat. Occasional gouts of blood from the wounded man
  spattered the trail.</p>

  <p>Jan set out, following at a swift, tireless trot. The little brown boy
  clung close at his heels. Soon the track showed that the tiger had slowed
  down to a trot. The huge pugs were comparatively close together, and there
  were narrow lines left by the dragging feet of its victim.</p>

  <p>The trail paralleled the little stream and suddenly brought them to its
  confluence with a broader one&mdash;a small river. Here the pugs led straight
  down to the water's edge and ended in the shallows.</p>

  <p>"The <i>bagh</i> has swum the river," said the boy.</p>

  <p>"We will swim after him," Jan replied.</p>

  <p>"But there are muggers&mdash;big ones. They would eat us."</p>

  <p>The lad pointed to where several ugly crocodile snouts projected above the
  surface.</p>

  <p>Jan barely glanced at them. Then he looked across the narrow river. The
  farther bank was plainly visible, and there were no tiger pugs on it. Yet the
  tiger could not have climbed up that bank without leaving a plain trail.
  Perhaps it had only swum up or down stream for a short distance, then come
  out on the same side. Jan searched the bank for a half mile in both
  directions, but found no tracks.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the muggers got both," hazarded the boy.</p>

  <p>"In any event, it will be too late to save your father if we find him
  now," Jan replied.</p>

  <p>"But I would save him from being eaten, <i>sahib</i>, that I may perform
  the true duties of an eldest son."</p>

  <p>"And what may that be?"</p>

  <p>"To burn his body and cast his ashes into the Ganges."</p>

  <p>Jan shook his head uncomprehendingly. He could not understand the sense of
  risking one's life to save a dead body, only to burn it immediately
  afterward. Yet, somehow, he liked this black-eyed, brown-skinned lad.</p>

  <p>"We will cross the river," he announced.</p>

  <p>Some distance upstream he had noticed a place where the leafy vault of
  trees and vines came almost together above the stream. He led the way to this
  point, the boy following.</p>

  <p>"Get up on my back," he ordered, "and hold the spear."</p>

  <p>The lad did as he was bidden, and Jan swarmed effortlessly up a thick vine
  with his light burden. He soon found a stout projecting limb that suited his
  purpose, and walked out on it until he stood high above the middle of the
  stream.</p>

  <p>"Hang on," he cried. Then he leaped as a diver leaps from a springboard.
  The brown boy gasped, but clung tightly as they hurtled dizzily through
  space.</p>

  <p>Jan caught a limb of the opposite tree some ten feet lower down, and
  clung. It sagged dangerously, and a huge mugger below them opened its jaws as
  if in pleasant anticipation. But the limb held, and in a moment more the two
  stood safely on the bank. Jan took the spear.</p>

  <p>"Now we will look for the <i>bagh</i>," he said.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEY walked back along the bank, and presently. the jungle
  man saw the trail which, had escaped him before.</p>

  <p>The tiger had swum straight across, but instead of going up the bank had
  pulled itself up on the trunk of a tree undermined by the current which
  sagged out horizontally only a foot above the water.</p>

  <p>The trail led straight back through the trees, over a low hill, and into a
  patch of tall jungle grass. Jan went warily through that grass, his spear
  ready poised in his hand for instant action. It was an ideal hiding place for
  any animal, but most especially for a tiger, whose stripes so perfectly
  simulated its pattern of light and shadow.</p>

  <p>The path wound through the grass for a short distance. Then they suddenly
  came upon the trampled, blood-soaked spot where the tiger had devoured its
  kill. The signs were unmistakable. And all that the beast had left consisted
  of a bedraggled turban, some chewed bits of loin cloth, and the long,
  double-curved knife which the deceased had worn at his waist, attached to the
  ragged stubs of what had once been a leather belt.</p>

  <p>The boy gathered the grisly tokens into a little pile, then squatted on
  his heels before them, rocking back and forth and moaning.</p>

  <p>Jan watched him for some time in silence. Presently he said: "Come. We
  have yet to find the <i>bagh</i> and slay it."</p>

  <p>"It is useless to find the <i>bagh</i> now," groaned the boy, "for I
  cannot perform the funeral rites for my father."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Jan asked. "Since your father is inside the <i>bagh</i>, we
  will slay the beast and burn it. Thus you may perform the funeral rites for
  your father and later cast his ashes into the Ganges."</p>

  <p>The lad looked up thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I do not know that the Brahmins would approve of such a burning," he
  said. "And yet, it is all that is left to do. So let us look for the
  <i>bagh</i>." He picked up the turban and knife, and stood up. The former, he
  fitted over his own small turban. The latter he extended to Jan. "Take this
  kukrie," he said, "since you do not have one. It will be very useful in the
  jungle."</p>

  <p>Jan accepted the gift with befitting gravity, and set off once more on the
  trail of the tiger. It wound through the grass for some distance, then led
  back through the trees toward the river. Soon the cat scent grew very strong,
  and the jungle man moved forward with the utmost caution. Presently he saw
  the tiger sprawling in the shallows in a little inlet that connected with the
  river.</p>

  <p>Noiselessly, he raised the heavy spear for the cast. But it was never
  made. For at that instant, Jan felt a stinging pain in his right forearm. A
  great, spade-shaped serpent head was clamped upon it. He dropped the spear,
  and gripping the snake behind the head with his left hand, squeezed it until
  its jaws loosened. But in the meantime the heavy coils of its enormous body
  had slithered down from the branch on which they were draped, and were flung,
  one after another, around his shoulder, as a hawser is thrown over a mooring
  post. Jan managed to keep his head and body free of those coils, but his
  right arm and shoulder were imprisoned.</p>

  <p>Hearing the struggle so close at hand, the tiger bounded to its feet.
  Instantly catching sight of the jungle man, it growled thunderously and
  charged. Jan made a superhuman effort to wrench his arm and shoulder free
  from those crushing folds, but he could not loosen the vise-like grip of the
  reptile.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE RAID</h2>

  <p class="first">AS SOON as the babu had ridden well out of sight of the camp
  on the pad elephant, he ordered Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>, to halt the beast,
  and called Kupta to come and ride with him. Then they started off once more,
  this time at a swifter pace, and straight for their objective, without any
  pretense of following a trail.</p>

  <p>After a ride of about five miles, they came to a small camp situated in a
  pleasant grove of trees, through which a clear brook meandered. A short
  distance from the camp a herd of horses was grazing under the watchful eyes
  of two mounted and armed Pathans. Swarthy, bearded men lounged about in the
  shade, smoking and chatting.</p>

  <p>As the elephant approached, one of these seized a rifle, sprang to his
  feet, and shouted a challenge in Pashto.</p>

  <p>"Ho, strangers. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I seek a word with Zafarulla Khan," replied the babu in the same
  language.</p>

  <p>"Then you are Chandra Kumar?"</p>

  <p>"In the flesh."</p>

  <p>"In very good flesh, I observe," said the Pathan with a sly wink at his
  comrades, who laughed uproariously as the babu closed his umbrella and
  clumsily dismounted from his seat on the kneeling elephant.</p>

  <p>"Said the crow to the pigeon," replied Chandra Kumar with a bland
  smile.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the laugh was turned against the jester, for he was a very lean
  and cadaverous man. But like many jesters, he could give with better grace
  than he could receive.</p>

  <p>"Our leader expects you, O father of a pig," he snarled.</p>

  <p>"Lead on, my son, and I will follow," retorted the babu, with his same
  bland smile.</p>

  <p>Goaded by the laughter of his comrades at this unexpected retort, the
  Pathan glared furiously and raised his rifle threateningly, as if he would
  brain the babu with it.</p>

  <p>But the latter stood his ground without a change of countenance, so he
  turned and strode away, Chandra Kumar waddling after him.</p>

  <p>He stopped before one of the tents. "The Bengali has come," he announced.
  Then he stalked away.</p>

  <p>The babu paused at the doorway.</p>

  <p>"<i>Adab</i>, Zafarulla Khan," he said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"<i>Adab araz, babuji</i>," was the deep voiced reply. "<i>Bismillah</i>!
  Enter, in the name of Allah."</p>

  <p>The babu kicked off his slippers, dropped his folded umbrella across them,
  and stepped inside.</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan, a perfect giant of a man with a beard dyed flaming red
  with henna, and a fierce, hawk-like countenance that was seamed with battle
  scars, sat cross-legged on a blood red Baluchi rug, smoking a hookah. His
  rifle leaned against a bale of rugs nearby, and his heavy tulwar lay beside
  him. A huge churdh, the terrible Afghan knife, kept company with a pair of
  pearl handled revolvers that were thrust into his sash.</p>

  <p>"<i>Fahdul</i>," he invited with a wave of his hand. "Be seated."</p>

  <p>The babu sat down ponderously and accepted the flexible, ivory bitted stem
  of the hookah which his host passed to him. Placing it to his lips, he
  inhaled deeply, making a neroli scented water bubble noisily in the ornate
  bowl.</p>

  <p>The Pathan clapped his hands, and a beardless boy appeared in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"<i>Chai</i>," roared Zafarulla Khan.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, the boy returned with two small glasses of sweet, syrupy
  tea. Minutes were consumed in sipping, puffing, and polite inquiries as to
  the state of each man's health, as well as his family and all his immediate
  relatives.</p>

  <p>This formality concluded, the babu got down to business.</p>

  <p>"It is set for tonight," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is not set until I give the word," growled Zafarulla Khan. "Where is
  the money?"</p>

  <p>"Here. Count it." Chandra Kumar tossed a clinking bag between them.
  "Twenty-five hundred rupees."</p>

  <p>"What's that!" roared the Pathan. "Wallahi! You were to bring five
  thousand. The agreement was for ten thousand rupees, one-half down and
  one-half when the girl is delivered to the priest. Now by my head and
  beard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait!" The babu checked him with upraised hand, then continued blandly:
  "You must have misunderstood. I told you the priest would pay you five
  thousand when the girl was delivered, and I would pay you half that sum
  before the raid."</p>

  <p>"You said five thousand, O dog and son of a dog!"</p>

  <p>"I distinctly said, one half of that amount."</p>

  <p>"One-half of ten thousand!"</p>

  <p>"No, of five."</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan raged, fumed, blustered and pleaded. He called upon Allah,
  Mohammed, and all the Moslem saints and prophets to bear him witness. But
  through it all, the babu remained placid and unruffled.</p>

  <p>When the storm had somewhat subsided, Chandra Kumar proffered his betel
  box, but the Pathan struck it from his hand, then drew his churdh and
  fingered the keen blade significantly.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize, O unbelieving swine," he growled, "how easy it would be
  for me to slit your throat, take the money, and leave you here for the hyenas
  and jackals? The conviction grows upon me that this is what I should do."</p>

  <p>"But it is not what you will do," said the babu calmly enough, though he
  had grown somewhat pale beneath his brown skin.</p>

  <p>"And why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because if you did, you would have but twenty-five hundred rupees,
  whereas, for a bloodless raid and a pleasant ride you will have seventy-five
  hundred. Furthermore, both my master and the British would hunt you and your
  men down like mad dogs."</p>

  <p>"Who says the raid will be bloodless and the ride pleasant? It is no light
  thing to kidnap a <i>memsahib</i>. For such a crime the British would hunt a
  man to the ends of the earth. Better to slit the throat of such as you, take
  my small gain, and have done with it."</p>

  <p>"But as I have told you, the girl is not a <i>memsahib</i>, but an
  oriental. You have but to look at her great languorous eyes&mdash;her raven
  hair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hah! Perhaps I shall keep her for myself."</p>

  <p>"Then you will make the raid?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ayewah</i>! But not for this paltry bag of coin&mdash;only for the
  sake of a look at this ravishing beauty."</p>

  <p>The babu chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Remember, she is to be turned over unharmed to the priest, if you would
  collect the five thousand rupees. And no slave girl is worth such a sum. Nor
  would you chance losing it, were the lovely Nour-mahal herself in your power.
  Your love of gold is too great for that."</p>

  <p>"So you think," rumbled Zafarulla Khan. "But what of the plans?"</p>

  <p>The babu again tendered his betel box, and this time the Pathan helped
  himself to a quid. Then he reached behind him for a brass cuspidor which he
  placed on the rug between them.</p>

  <p>"The raid is to be staged just after sunset, when it will be light enough
  to see, yet dark enough so details and disguises will not be seen too
  clearly."</p>

  <p>"Eh? There will be disguises?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought them in a bundle on the elephant, Rajput clothing for all,
  great black false beards such as the Rajputs wear, and a can of petrol with
  which beards and clothing may be soaked when you have done with them and are
  ready to burn them."</p>

  <p>"So The Rajputs are to take the blame."</p>

  <p>"Why not? It is the only logical disguise."</p>

  <p>"But the only Rajputs in this vicinity are men of the true faith, Moslems
  like ourselves."</p><br>

  <p class="first">"UPON whom, then, would you place the blame? And all of the
  Rajputs in Rissapur are not Muslim. Many have held to the faith of their
  forefathers."</p>

  <p>"<i>Billahi</i>! Rissapur! I begin to smell a mouse in the rice bag! It is
  said there is no love lost between your Hindu kingling and the Muslim
  Maharaja of Rissapur."</p>

  <p>"You smell a mouse which does not exist. They are warm friends."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps. But I have my doubts. Proceed."</p>

  <p>"You will ride down upon the camp, wearing the Rajput disguises, shouting
  the Rajput war-cry, and firing your guns into the air."</p>

  <p>"Only to be shot by the <i>sahibs</i>."</p>

  <p>"Nay, the <i>sahibs</i> will not be in the camp, and the guards will run
  into the woods at the first sounds of the raid."</p>

  <p>"But I have heard that some of these <i>memsahibs</i> can shoot as well as
  a man."</p>

  <p>"Not these," replied the babu. "Besides, their guns will be loaded with
  blank cartridges. You will seize the young one and ride off with her, taking
  care that no harm shall come to her or the others. On arriving at this camp,
  you will pile your disguises on the ground, pour petrol over them and burn
  them. Then you will ride on into Rissapur territotyr."</p>

  <p>"<i>Subhanallah</i>! So I thought. The mouse scent again grows
  strong."</p>

  <p>"When you reach the road that leads into the city, you will follow it
  until you come to the red shrine of Ganesha. Your men will ride on into the
  city, but you, carrying the girl, will turnoff there, and ride alone with her
  due north until you reach the river. There Thakoor, the priest, will await
  you with the money."</p>

  <p>"Or an ambush to shoot me down."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. My master does not wish the plot disclosed, and your men
  could go to the Maharaja of Rissapur with their grievances if you did not
  return with the money."</p>

  <p>"So they could. Say on."</p>

  <p>"When you have received the money you will ride on into Rissapur, pay your
  men, and order them to leave separately, by various ways, to reunite in any
  other place you may designate."</p>

  <p>The Pathan slapped his thigh.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mashallah</i>!" he exclaimed. "It is a good scheme, and we are just
  the men to carry it out. But still the mouse scent lingers. It is whispered
  that the British Raj would force a union of Varuda and Rissapur, and that the
  prince who succeeds in winning their favor will rule both. Now if this
  scandal were brought to the door of the Maharaja of Rissapur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pure bazaar gossip," the babu interrupted him, rising. "Heed it not, and
  think no more of super-plots which do not exist."</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan thrust the bag of coins into his sash, and stood up. He
  towered above the portly babu like a cedar above an olive tree as the two
  made their way to where the elephant knelt.</p>

  <p>With the help of Kupta, the Bangali cast off the ropes which held the
  bundle of disguises and the means to destroy them, and lowered the bundle to
  the ground. At a curt command from their leader, two of Zafarulla Khan's men
  took up the bundle and carried it to his tent.</p>

  <p>Then the babu resumed his seat on the pad beside Kupta, and the elephant
  heaved its pon-derout bulk erect.</p>

  <p>"<i>Salaam</i>," called Chandra Kumar in farewell, as the beast lumbered
  away.</p>

  <p>"<i>Salaam</i>," replied the Pathan leader, and turning, stalked to his
  tent.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE babu was quite jovial as they rode back toward their own
  camp, joking first with Kupta, then with Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>. He was
  very happy, for though he had forsaken the gods of his forefathers, a new god
  had taken their place&mdash; gold. And he found it very pleasant to
  contemplate the twenty-five hundred rupees which were the profits of this
  trip, resting his heavy money belt along with the money he had mulcted from
  Kupta and Sarkar. Also, it was exceedingly gratifying to estimate the
  infinitely greater profits yet to come from this venture.</p>

  <p>Within a half mile of the camp, they turned down a side path and halted,
  it being the babu's purpose to wait there until after the raid had taken
  place. He and Kupta dismounted and took their ease beneath a shady tree, but
  Sarkar was content to keep his seat on the elephant's neck while the beast
  tore off leaves and tender twigs and thrust them into his huge mouth.</p>

  <p>Back in the camp of the maharaja, tiffin was followed by the customary
  nap, which lasted well into the afternoon. Then the maharaja assembled his
  guests for tea.</p>

  <p>For some time, as was natural, the talk was only of Jan, and the
  possibility of catching up with him. Naturally, all were anxious to continue
  on the trail as swiftly as possible, with the exception of the maharaja. But
  he simulated anxiety on the subject very well.</p>

  <p>"There's no use going on," he said, finally, "until we hear from the babu.
  Also, we must wait for the elephants that are bringing up our baggage. In the
  meantime," looking at his two male guests, "I think I'll have a try for
  sambar. There's no fresh meat in camp for my men. And I know of a water hole
  nearby where the jeraos, as we call them, are sometimes thick as fleas. You
  probably won't care to eat any of the meat&mdash;most Americans and Europeans
  don't, as it is rather coarse in texture. But I think I can promise you two
  gentlemen some ripping sport if you care to come with me."</p>

  <p>Don Francesco turned to Trevor. "What do you say, <i>amigo</i>?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Jan's father. "I simply, can't get the boy off my
  mind, and if I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go with him," said Georgia Trevor. "There isn't a thing we can do at
  present&mdash;and you like to hunt."</p>

  <p>"Yes, do come," urged the maharaja. "We'll only be gone for an hour or two
  at the most, and will be back in camp before the babu can possibly get here.
  Then we'll have a good night's rest and get an early start on the trail in
  the morning."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll go. But the ladies&mdash;will it be safe to leave them
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll leave all my spearmen here," the maharaja promised, "and rifles for
  the ladies."</p>

  <p>"We'll take only one elephant and his <i>mahout</i>. Rare sport, shooting
  from the howdah&mdash;and we may flush a tiger."</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, the maharaja and his two male guests rode away on the
  back of the largest elephant.</p><br>

  <p class="first">GEORGIA TREVOR and Doña Isabella retired to their couches.
  Ramona sat down in front of the tent to read a travel book on India which she
  had in her hand luggage. There was no breeze, the leaves hung motionless on
  the branches, and the air seemed fairly to quiver with the heat. Several
  times she caught herself nodding over her book, and presently, overcome by
  heat-induced drowsiness, she fell asleep in her chair.</p>

  <p>When she awoke, the sun had set and a breeze had sprung up. She arose and
  went for a stroll about the camp. She noticed that wood had been brought in
  for the cooking fires, but that not one had been lighted. Puzzled, she spoke
  to an old wrinkled Brahmin beggar who sat a little apart from the others with
  his back against a tree.</p>

  <p>"Why is it you have not lighted your fires and prepared your evening
  meals?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not our custom, <i>memsahib</i>," he replied softly. "This interval
  between sunset and the first glimmer of stars is the moment of silence. No
  one cooks or lights fires at this time. It is a sacred moment when we sit
  still, meditate, and listen for the voice of silence."</p>

  <p>One by one the stars came out. A man arose and touched a match to his
  cooking fire.</p>

  <p>Then, as if this were a prearranged signal, the silence was broken by the
  thunder of charging hoofs, and the frenzied yelling of a host of riders,
  punctuated by the loud reports of rifles and pistols.</p>

  <p>Instantly, the camp was thrown into wild confusion. The elephants began
  milling and trumpeting, their <i>mahouts</i> trying ineffectually to calm
  them. Then one big bull snapped his tether and fled into the jungle. He was
  followed by another and another, until all had disappeared into the jungle
  shadows. The guards seized their spears and ran hither and thither, shouting
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>A dozen black bearded riders charged into the camp, shouting and shooting,
  their puggrees streaming behind them. Others deployed to the right and
  left.</p>

  <p>With frightened cries, the spear-men plunged into the jungle, leaving the
  camp defenseless.</p>

  <p>Cut off from retreat to the tent, Ramona saw Jan's mother and Doña
  Isabella emerge with rifles in their hands. She saw the former level her
  rifle at a yelling raider and fire. The raider sprang from his horse and
  confronted her. Again she fired, point blank at his heart. But he only
  laughed, wrenched the rifle from her grasp, and pushing both women aside,
  plunged into the tent. Another rider disarmed the doña, and seized her by the
  arm, while a third, who tried to hold the fiery Georgia Trevor found he had
  captured a tartar. She kicked, scratched, and finally seized him by the beard
  which, much to her surprise, came off in her hands, revealing a scraggy, gray
  beard beneath it.</p>

  <p>The first man then came out of the tent, and spoke rapidly in Pashto.</p>

  <p>Ramona, about to rush to the assistance of the others, felt a light tug at
  her sleeve. The old Brahmin who had told her of the voice of the silence was
  there.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said softly. "It is you they want. The others will not be
  harmed. Follow me. Perhaps I can help you to elude them."</p>

  <p>For a moment Ramona stood irresolute. Then she saw the marauders release
  the two women. One shouted a harsh command, and other raiders began searching
  the remaining tents. So far none of them had seen her standing there in the
  shadow. Silently, she turned and followed the old Hindu into the jungle
  blackness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; A STRANGE FUNERAL</h2>

  <p class="first">WITH his right arm and shoulder imprisoned in the crushing
  folds of the giant python, and the snarling tiger charging straight for him,
  Jan thought and acted with that celerity which had saved his life so many
  times before in his native South American jungle. First he leaned far back,
  then exerting every ounce of his marvellous strength, hurled his burdened arm
  and shoulder forward. With the backward movement, the coils of the serpent
  had loosened for a moment, seeking a new grip. Now, the writhing, hissing
  reptile hurtled through the air, and its heavy coils fell over the head and
  neck of the charging feline.</p>

  <p>Jan caught up the spear and sprang back, but the precaution was needless,
  for both of his enemies now found themselves so busily engaged with each
  other that their intended victim was forgotten. The tiger bit, clawed and
  roared its anger as it rolled over and over trying to rid itself of those
  crushing folds. But its terrible teeth and talons made little impression on
  the armored body of the reptile, only dislodging a few superficial
  scales.</p>

  <p>In contrast to the lightning-like movements of the great cat, those of the
  serpent seemed slow and deliberate. The coils which encircled the tiger's
  neck tightened into a thick scaly collar. Others slid around its body, the
  mighty muscles rippling beneath the gleaming skin, constricting,
  crushing.</p>

  <p>Presently, exhausted by its terrific exertions, the tiger ceased its
  struggles and fell on its side, where it lay breathing heavily.</p>

  <p>Watching breathlessly, Jan spoke to the brown boy who stood at his
  side.</p>

  <p>"It kills as kill the boa and the anaconda in my jungle," he said. "The
  <i>bagh</i> is doomed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the <i>bagh</i> is doomed," the boy replied, "for the spirit of a
  Naga dwells in the serpent, and it may not be slain. It is invincible."</p>

  <p>"As to that," replied Jan, "I am doubtful. Let us see."</p>

  <p>With the spear held in readiness, he warily approached the two combatants.
  The tiger shuddered convulsively and suddenly ceased to breathe. It was dead,
  its ribs crushed to splinters; and blood from its fractured windpipe mingled
  with the foam that drooled from its jaws.</p>

  <p>But the serpent was very much alive. As the jungle man drew close, the
  great spade-shaped head flashed out at him. He eluded it by leaping sideways,
  then, as it was retracted, sprang in and pinned it to the ground with the
  long steel blade of the spear. Swiftly the heavy coils of the serpent
  released the dead tiger. Then it writhed in its death agony while Jan and the
  brown boy looked on.</p>

  <p>"The spirit of the Naga has left it," said Jan. "Its brain is split in
  two. But it will continue to move for some time. That is the way of
  serpents."</p>

  <p>"It is because the spirit of the Naga has not really left its body,"
  replied the boy. "It may yet slay us."</p>

  <p>But Jan only laughed. Then, when the convulsive thrashings of the python
  began to subside, he seized the tiger by the tail and dragged its limp
  carcass out of range of the writhing, scaly folds.</p>

  <p>"Now we will gather wood," he told the boy, "and cremate your father in
  accordance with the custom of your ancestors."</p>

  <p>The two worked swiftly at their task of building a funeral pyre, and when
  it was ready, laid the remains of the tiger upon it. Then, after a small fire
  had been kindled near at hand, the boy walked seven times round the pyre
  muttering strange words and making queer signs, none of which Jan understood.
  This done, he thrust a flaming brand from the small fire beneath the heap of
  wood, which was soon crackling loudly as the flames leaped up around the
  marauding feline's body, showers of sparks mounting skyward with the
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"What were those strange words you used?" Jan asked.</p>

  <p>"I will try to translate for you," the boy replied. "I said: 'O you who
  are now without a home on the earth, on the rivers or in the sea, depart, and
  seek not to clothe yourself in flesh again. Go! Go and be with our ancestors!
  Follow the path of silence where the sun travels, seeking ultimate truth! Go
  to where the gods await you, for now you must play upon the flute of silence,
  as death is purified by song.' "</p>

  <p>"A most fitting ceremony," said Jan. "And what will you do with the
  ashes?"</p>

  <p>"I will take them to the Ganges, mix them in a pitcher of water, then
  break the pitcher above the water and say, while I watch the ashes float down
  the river: 'Travel down with the yellow Ganges into that vast and turbulent
  entity, the Sea.'"</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE two fed the fire until the tiger was reduced to ashes.
  These the boy gathered in a large leaf, which he bound with a bit of bark
  fiber. By this time the movements of the python had subsided to nothing but
  occasional tremors, and Jan recovered the spear.</p>

  <p>"It will soon be dark," he told the boy. "Where would you like to go?"</p>

  <p>"If we can cross the river," the lad replied, "I should like to return to
  the camp where there are rice and curry, and from which I can continue on the
  trail of Rangini, the she-elephant."</p>

  <p>"We can cross the river again," Jan assured him, "so let us start."</p>

  <p>Taking the boy on his back as he had before, Jan managed the leap across
  the narrow stream in the opposite direction, much to the disgust of the
  hungry muggers that waited beneath. Before they reached camp the sun had set,
  and the brief dusk was quickly followed by darkness, the moon having not yet
  risen.</p>

  <p>On their arrival at camp they kindled a fire, and the boy quickly prepared
  a dish of curried vegetables and rice from the meager stores left by his
  father. Then disdaining the flimsy, makeshift hut, Jan carried the boy with
  him into the branches of a tall tree, and there they spent the night.</p>

  <p>The following morning Jan, whose jungle appetite was not satisfied by the
  meager Hindu fare, speared a small hog deer which added delicious grilled
  venison steaks to their breakfast menu. Having eaten their fill and drunk a
  satisfying draught from the river, they set out on the trail of Rangini, the
  she-elephant. After a half day's travel it was evident from the freshness of
  the tracks that they were getting very close to the great pachyderm. And
  toward midafternoon they suddenly sighted not one, but two elephants,
  standing side by side waist deep in the river, enjoying a shower bath,
  spraying their huge bodies with water sucked up in their trunks. One was a
  tall female, and the other a tremendous male with long, gleaming tusks.</p>

  <p>"It is Rangini!" exclaimed the boy, "and she has come to meet her lover as
  my father suspected."</p>

  <p>"Is this other a wild elephant?" Jan asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I recognize him now," the boy replied. "He is Malikshah, the
  mightiest bull in the herd of the Maharaja of Rissapur."</p>

  <p>"Then Malikshah must have broken away also, to meet this she-elephant. Is
  it not strange that each should know where to meet the other, and when?"</p>

  <p>"It may seem strange to one unfamiliar with elephants," the boy replied,
  "but we who have been born and raised with them do not consider it
  so."</p><br>

  <p class="first">FEARLESSLY the boy waded out to the two giant beasts. Then
  he spoke to Rangini, whereupon she extended her trunk and elevated him to a
  seat on her broad head. He spoke again, and she lumbered up out of the water,
  the huge bull keeping pace beside her. Jan, unacquainted with the ways of
  elephants and ever cautious, kept back out of reach of the two powerful
  trunks. He closely watched both beasts, endeavoring to determine whether they
  were friendly or unfriendly toward him, but so far as he was able to tell,
  both were utterly oblivious to his presence. The boy, however, more
  experienced and hence keener to observe small indications, said:</p>

  <p>"You need not fear Rangini, for she is very gentle, and Malikshah, though
  he is quick-tempered, seems to like you."</p>

  <p>"I do not fear any man or beast," Jan replied. "But these animals are new
  to me, and caution is the first law of the jungle."</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, he walked up to the giant bull and patted its
  shoulder; then stood while the great beast sniffed and investigated him with
  its sinuous trunk. When this investigation was completed, the observant boy
  said: "Malikshah likes you. I will command him to take you up."</p>

  <p>He spoke sharply to the giant bull, and Jan for the first time experienced
  the strange sensation of being lifted through the air to an elephant's head.
  He enjoyed it thoroughly, and, once seated on the broad neck, scratched
  Malikshah behind his great, flopping ears.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have your elephant," said Jan, "where do you want to go
  next?"</p>

  <p>"It is my duty to return her at once to my master, the Maharaja of
  Varuda," replied the boy.</p>

  <p>"But what of Malikshah?" asked Jan.</p>

  <p>"He should be returned to Rissapur," the boy answered. "Yet it is probable
  that we will not be able to separate these two at once. They might obey, but
  would be likely to run away again."</p>

  <p>"In that, case," Jan replied, "let us take both of them to Varuda. Then
  Malikshah can be returned to his owner later."</p>

  <p>"That seems the only thing to do," the boy told him after some thought.
  Then he spoke to Rangini, and the two elephants ambled off through the
  jungle.</p>

  <p>Jan greatly enjoyed the novelty of his ride across grassy plains, over
  rocky and sparsely tree-grown hills, and through hot, moist valleys luxuriant
  with jungle vegetation.</p>

  <p>Up to this time the boy seemed to have taken Jan rather as a matter of
  course, but now, with the first part of his duty to his deceased father
  accomplished, and the elephant with which he had been reared from babyhood
  safely beneath him, his natural childish curiosity asserted itself.</p>

  <p>"O mighty hunter," he asked, "are you of the <i>sahibs</i> of
  England?"</p>

  <p>"I am not of the English <i>sahibs</i>," Jan replied.</p>

  <p>"Yet you speak their language, and your hair is colored like that of
  another <i>sahib</i> I once knew&mdash;O'Malley Sahib. Though he was a
  soldier in the English army he swore he was not from England, either, but
  from the Imraldile. Are you from the Imraldile?"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of it," Jan replied.</p>

  <p>"Also, he referred to his country as the Owled-sahd."</p>

  <p>Jan shook his head in puzzlement. Then a light dawned upon him. He
  recalled that one of the sailors on his father's yacht had often spoken
  longingly of the Emerald Isle and the Auld Sod.</p>

  <p>"He must be Irish," he said.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is it!" the boy exclaimed. "I could not think of the word. And
  are your Irish?"</p>

  <p>"I am an American," Jan replied. The boy looked disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I have only seen one American before, a <i>memsahib</i>," he said. "She
  had a long, pointed nose and small beady eyes like a crow. I heard that she
  went back to her country and wrote horrible things about India. Is that what
  you intend doing?"</p>

  <p>"I do not intend to write anything about India," Jan replied. "But if I
  did it would not be horrible. I like your country very much."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," the boy replied, naïvely, "because I like you very much. Will
  you tell me your name?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Jan Trevor, but I am better known as Jan of the Jungle."</p>

  <p>"Of the jungle? Then the jungle is your home?"</p>

  <p>"Not this jungle," Jan replied, "but another on the opposite side of the
  earth."</p>

  <p>"Yet you can climb even better than the gibbons and monkeys. Do all men in
  your jungle climb so well?"</p>

  <p>"No, they do not climb nearly so well as even the smallest monkeys. You
  see I had special training, because I was stolen from my parents when a baby
  by a very wicked man and raised by a chimpanzee. We both escaped from the man
  who stole me, but were captured by other men who took us to sea."</p>

  <p>"And then what happened?"</p>

  <p>"We were shipwrecked on the coast of South America, and escaped into the
  jungle."</p>

  <p>"And didn't you ever see your parents after that?"</p>

  <p>"For a few months I was with them. But now I have lost them again."</p>

  <p>"That is sad." A tear trickled down the brown cheek, and Jan sensed that
  the boy was thinking of his recent bereavement, so he quickly changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"You have not told me your name, and how it happens that you speak
  English," he said.</p>

  <p>"My name is Sharma," the boy replied, rubbing away the tear with a small
  brown fist, "and I learned English in a mission school. Also, my father has
  worked for many <i>sahibs</i>&mdash;always he worked for <i>sahibs</i> until
  the maharaja bought Rangini. Then we came with her to Varuda."</p>

  <p>Near nightfall they came to a small stream, which the elephants
  immediately entered. Jan and his small companion left them there and set out
  in search of food.</p>

  <p>Presently Jan succeeded in knocking over a pheasant with a stone, and they
  soon had it grilling over a fire. When they had eaten, the jungle man
  constructed a small sleeping platform in a tree. Then, leaving the boy with
  the two elephants, which showed no signs of wanting to leave their bath, he
  set off on a journey of exploration on his own account.</p>

  <p>He had covered not more than a couple of miles when he suddenly emerged
  into an open, flooded space where a number of men were at work ploughing,
  while women followed them, setting out plants in the shallow, muddy water. At
  some distance behind them he saw the huts of a small village.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE people were chatting and laughing, and he succeeded in
  approaching within a few feet of the nearest workers without attracting their
  attention. What he did not notice was the small, mangy cur, which had been
  ranging in the surrounding jungle. It suddenly sighted him, and then charged
  for him, barking loudly.</p>

  <p>Though he could easily have slain it, Jan was never a wanton destroyer of
  life. He killed only for food and in self-defense, and this yapping cur was
  beneath his notice. But the barking of the dog attracted others, as well as
  their human masters. A number of men came running, carrying long bladed
  spears, and the jungle man was soon surrounded by hostile dogs and equally
  hostile villagers. The latter, who had not yet seen him, evidently thought
  the dogs had brought some jungle beast to bay and approached warily, their
  spears held ready for the cast.</p>

  <p>Jan let them approach until the circle narrowed to less than a hundred
  feet. For a moment he was undecided whether to reveal himself and attempt to
  make friends by means of sign language, or to make good his escape while
  there was yet time. But the menace of that tightening ring of spears decided
  him on the latter course.</p>

  <p>Suddenly springing from his place of concealment, he clambered up the
  nearest tree with apelike agility. Instantly a dozen spears flashed round
  him, but so swift and elusive were his movements that none took effect. The
  villagers cried out in amazement at sight of this naked white man, who swung
  off through the interlacing vines and tree trunks with the ease and agility
  of a gibbon or monkey. They set out in frenzied pursuit of him, but he
  quickly outdistanced them.</p>

  <p>When all sight and sound of the hostile villagers was lost in the
  distance, he descended once more and made his way back to camp. He called to
  the boy as he approached the smoking embers of their fire, but received no
  reply. A moment later he saw to his consternation that both the boy and the
  two elephants were gone.</p>

  <p>The ground was trampled by the tracks of other elephants, many of them,
  mingled with the tracks of men. Much concerned as to what had happened to his
  small friend during his absence, Jan made a minute examination of the tracks
  in order to try to learn just what had taken place.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE BLACK PAGODA</h2>

  <p class="first">RAMONA followed the old Brahmin through the jungle blackness
  more by sound than by sight, though she caught an occasional shadowy glimpse
  of him each time a break in the forest canopy let in a little light.
  Presently all sounds of conflict from the camp died away in the distance, and
  these two were alone in the comparative silence of the jungle&mdash;an aged
  brown man and a young and beautiful girl of the white race. But though the
  jungle was comparatively quiet, it was far from silent, and there were many
  strange noises which frightened the girl.</p>

  <p>The old fellow seemed to sense this and reassured her again and again as
  they went forward.</p>

  <p>"That noise is only made by a tiny insect," he would say, or, "This
  tremendous clamor is simply a night bird trying to attract the attention of
  his prospective sweetheart. The really dangerous beasts make little or no
  noise. If the tiger stalks you, the chances are that you will not hear him
  until his teeth and talons have pierced your body. Even the mighty elephants
  can move through the jungle without noise when they wish to do so."</p>

  <p>And so they pressed on in this manner until a flicker of yellow light
  ahead told them that they were approaching a camp.</p>

  <p>The cautious Brahmin said, "Wait here. I will go forward to
  investigate."</p>

  <p>"But I am afraid to stay alone in the jungle," the girl replied.</p>

  <p>"Why, then come with me and we will both investigate, my child," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>They approached the camp warily and saw that two men were seated beside a
  small fire smoking cigarettes and chatting. Near the tiny fire was a huge
  heap of firewood, and lying on the ground nearby were a number of tents
  packed ready for loading, as well as bales of rugs and other camp equipment.
  A dozen horses were tethered to the trees not far away.</p>

  <p>The old Brahmin squinted thoughtfully at the two men for a moment. Then he
  said, "They are Pathans&mdash;wandering horse traders. We need not fear them.
  Come!"</p>

  <p>He led the way into the circle of fire light.</p>

  <p>At this one of the Pathans sprang to his feet, rifle ready, and spoke in
  Urdu, which of course Ramona did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Who are you," he bellowed, "and what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>Then his eye caught the alluring beauty and seductive curves of the girl
  who stood revealed in the fire light, and his look softened.</p>

  <p>"<i>Bismillah</i>!" he said to her with a smirk. "Welcome in the name of
  Allah."</p>

  <p>Ramona did not understand a word, but she noticed that his fierce look had
  suddenly grown friendly, and gratefully accepted the proffered seat on a
  small rug before the fire.</p>

  <p>The Pathan, whose name was Mutiur Rahman, again spoke to the old Hindu.
  "Are you the servant of this lady?" he asked in Urdu.</p>

  <p>"Nay! I am the servant of no mortal who walks the earth," the ancient one
  replied, "but I have been traveling with the party of his highness, the
  Maharaja of Varuda."</p>

  <p>At this Mutiur Rahman turned to his companion with a slight wink and
  said:</p>

  <p>"Come, Ismail, let us attend to the horses." And, politely to the old
  Brahmin, "Excuse us for a moment and make yourselves comfortable. We will be
  with you shortly."</p>

  <p>The Pathans walked over among the horses, and as soon as they were out of
  earshot of the two who sat unsuspectingly beside the fire, Mutiur Rahman
  said:</p>

  <p>"I have a suspicion, Ismail."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" the other asked.</p>

  <p>"Is it not strange that these two should be traveling together through the
  jungle at night, having left the camp of the Maharaja of Varuda?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Subhanallah</i>!" exclaimed Ismail. "So it is, and the girl&mdash;can
  it be that she is the one our men went forth to capture?"</p>

  <p>"Sh! Not so loud or they will hear you," cautioned Mutiur Rahman. "That is
  exactly what I suspect. Let us return to the fire now and be friendly. But if
  they attempt to leave we will see that they do not get far."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEY returned to the presence of their two unbidden guests,
  but in accordance with the Muslim custom of not eating or drinking with those
  to whom they intend possible harm, they made no offer of food or
  refreshment.</p>

  <p>If the old Brahmin noticed this he gave no sign, but sat staring into the
  fire as if he were looking through and beyond it into another world, his
  skinny legs crossed beneath him and his wrinkled, bony hands resting upon his
  knees.</p>

  <p>Presently the rumble of many hoofs caused him to look up
  apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Were you expecting some one?" he asked Mutiur Rahman.</p>

  <p>"Our leader and my comrades rode forth some time ago and should be back by
  now," the Pathan replied.</p>

  <p>The clatter of hoofs swiftly grew louder, and the camp was suddenly
  clamorous with stamping, neighing horses and loud-voiced men.</p>

  <p>Ramona and the old Brahmin sprung to their feet in alarm when they saw
  that these men, obviously Pathans, ripped off Rajput costumes and huge false
  beards, which they flung onto the pile of wood nearby.</p>

  <p>The Brahmin caught Ramona's hand, whispered, "Come," and attempted to lead
  her into the darkness. But he was too late, for a huge hawk-nosed,
  red-bearded fellow, with a fierce battle-scarred countenance rode up, clove
  him from crown to chin with a single sword stroke, caught the fleeing girl by
  the arm, and swung her onto the saddle before him. She kicked, scratched and
  struggled with all the strength at her command, but found the powerful
  muscles of her captor unyielding as steel, and only succeeded in making him
  roar with laughter.</p>

  <p>"So! my pretty one, my little white dove," he chuckled. "You saved me the
  trouble of bringing you to my camp. Mashallah! It was well done, indeed, and
  I thought I had lost you." He turned and roared commands to one of his men
  who stood beside the pile of wood, clothing and false beards, now reeking
  strongly of the petrol which had been emptied over it, a blazing brand in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Light the fire and we will be off," he cried.</p>

  <p>The man flung the fagot to the base of that great pile, which instantly
  flamed up, lighting the jungle with the brightness of day for many feet in
  all directions.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Zafarulla Khan fell on the body of the aged Brahmin, which
  still lay bleeding on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Fling that carrion into the fire," he ordered. "It is the funeral he
  would have preferred, anyway, and we don't want to have a corpse here."</p>

  <p>As soon as this command had been carried out, the Pathans gathered their
  tents and equipment, loaded them onto their horses and fell in behind their
  leader. Then the entire force galloped away into the night.</p><br>

  <p class="first">PRESENTLY exhausted by her futile struggles and frightened
  by the predicament in which she found herself, Ramona went limp and swooned
  away. Nor did she regain consciousness until the first golden shafts of the
  morning sun smote her face. Her first glimpse of the rugged countenance of
  her abductor caused her to scream and renew her struggle. At this he held up
  his hand and called a halt.</p>

  <p>"It seems, my pretty one, that I will be forced to bind and gag you," he
  said, "as we will soon be on a public highway and you are becoming
  troublesome."</p>

  <p>He bound her wrists together with a silken scarf, her ankles with another;
  a handkerchief was forced into her mouth and a second bound over it to keep
  it in place. Then wrapping a shawl about her so that she was completely
  disguised and even her face was hidden, he mounted once more, holding her on
  the saddle before him.</p>

  <p>Presently she heard the hoofs of the horses clattering on the paved
  roadway, and from time to time she heard and caught glimpses through the
  aperture in the shawl of passing wayfarers. There were carts drawn by
  bullocks, some empty and some loaded with produce, and all apparently driven
  by natives of the peasant class. There were automobiles of many varieties,
  elephants going forth to work in the jungle, haughty, black-bearded Rajputs
  riding sleek and richly caparisoned horses&mdash;a continuous cavalcade, that
  picturesque hodge-podge of humanity which makes up India.</p>

  <p>After a ride of less than an hour on this busy highway, Zafarulla Khan
  suddenly reined his horse to a halt.</p>

  <p>Peering through the folds of the shawl, Ramona saw that they had stopped
  before a red shrine in which was enthroned a grotesque god, with the head of
  an elephant and the multi-armed body of a man.</p>

  <p>The hawk nosed leader addressed a few brief orders to his men in Pashto.
  They clattered off down the road, but he turned aside and rode down a narrow
  path almost at right angles to it.</p>

  <p>Ramona judged that they must have covered about five miles when the Pathan
  again pulled his horse to a halt. She was uncomfortably warm from the shawl
  which wrapped her slender body and was therefore relieved when he removed it,
  as well as the gag.</p>

  <p>"You may scream as much as you like now, little dove," he said, "for there
  is none to hear you except him with whom we keep rendezvous."</p>

  <p>She saw that they were on the bank of a broad river and that a man who
  wore the yellow robe of a priest was propelling a boat toward them.</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan gave the girl a drink of water from his canteen and
  permitted her to rest in the shade of a spreading tree on the bank. Then he
  shouted to the approaching boatman in Urdu, which she did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, yellow robe, and what do you want?" he asked as the boat
  approached the bank.</p>

  <p>"I am Thakoor," was the reply, "and I have come to purchase the white
  dove."</p>

  <p>"<i>Wallah tayyib</i>! By Allah, good!" exclaimed the Pathan.</p>

  <p>The prow of the boat slid up on the sloping bank, and the priest&mdash;an
  old man whose parchment like brown skin was a network of
  wrinkles&mdash;stepped out and dragged it higher.</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan pointed to Ramona.</p>

  <p>"There is your white dove," he said.</p>

  <p>The old priest scrutinized the girl for a moment in silence.</p>

  <p>Then he said. "This must indeed be she, for generations have come and gone
  since I have seen another as lovely. Here is your gold."</p>

  <p>He extended a heavy bag, which Zafarulla Khan hefted suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"To what amount," he asked.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand rupees," the old one replied. "Will you count them?"</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan undid the strings of the bag and examined its contents.</p>

  <p>"Nay! This seems to be the correct sum," he said, "and I may not linger.
  But if I find that it is short by a single rupee I will fetch my men and slit
  the throats of you and all your idol worshipping brethren."</p>

  <p>"You will find the sum correct," said the old priest calmly, apparently
  unimpressed by the threat of the Pathan.</p>

  <p>Then he turned his attention to Ramona, untying and unwinding the scarf
  which imprisoned her ankles.</p>

  <p>"Come, my daughter," he said. "You need not fear old Thakoor. He means you
  well."</p>

  <p>He helped her to her feet, leaving her hands bound, but when she flinched
  and drew back from him, he said, "Come child, be not afraid. Great happiness
  and undreamed-of honors are in store for you, and I am but the humble
  instrument of the great gods who order your destiny. Let me help you into the
  boat."</p>

  <p>"If you are friendly why have you left the bonds upon my wrists?" she
  asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"An oversight," he hastened to assure her, still propelling her toward the
  boat. "I will remove them in a moment."</p>

  <p>When she was seated in the boat he pushed off and was well out in the
  stream before he removed the scarf from her wrists. Then he paddled steadily
  towards the opposite shore.</p>

  <p>She looked about her and had a wild notion of diving into the water and
  swimming away, but the sight of several ugly crocodile snouts caused her to
  quickly change her mind. For the present there was nothing for her to do
  except to resign herself to her fate.</p>

  <p>As they drew near the opposite bank of the river, several other
  yellow-robed figures emerged from among the trees and dragged the boat up
  onto the bank. Again she had the notion of trying to escape, but instantly
  realized that it was useless, for many of these priests who now stood around
  her were young and powerful looking men. The old man led her up the bank and
  through the trees, where a donkey with silver-mounted trappings stood
  patiently, saddled and waiting.</p>

  <p>The weary girl mounted and one young priest led the beast away, while old
  Thakoor walked beside the girl and the others brought up the rear.</p>

  <p>The path they followed led first through the trees which lined the river
  bank, then across a level place covered for the most part with tall jungle
  grass, and presently once more entered the dense and seemingly impenetrable
  jungle, in which a walled and roofed path had been hacked with knives. Here
  moisture dripped from leaves and branches and the brightness of the morning
  sun was replaced by eerie eternal twilight.</p>

  <p>From time to time they broke into open glades where brilliantly colored
  butterflies flitted about equally brilliant jungle flowers which scented the
  humid air with their sweet, heavy perfume. And at frequent intervals the girl
  caught the flash of brilliant bird plumage or saw curious monkey faces
  peering down at her. There were myriad bird calls, from the twittering of the
  tiny Java sparrows to the raucous cries of peacocks. And the chattering and
  scolding of monkeys were audible from time to time.</p><br>

  <p class="first">PRESENTLY the path widened and they broke out into the
  sunlight. Before them was an arched gateway in a high wall of black stone, in
  which were set two massive bronze gates green and corroded with age.</p>

  <p>Old Thakoor shouted something which the girl did not understand and the
  gates swung open.</p>

  <p>When the party passed through Ramona saw that they were in a garden laid
  out in exquisite taste, with pools, fountains, flowers, shrubbery and fruit
  and shade trees. Surrounding the garden, which was laid out in the form of a
  huge rectangle, were many low buildings, constructed against the high wall
  which encircled the enclosure. But in the very center of the garden was an
  edifice which simultaneously aroused both her wonder and disgust. It was
  built entirely of black stone in the form of a pagoda, which rose skyward,
  tier upon tier, to a dome supported by square cut, close set pillars.
  Architecturally it was beautiful, but the creator of this strange building
  had not stopped with mere architectural adornment, for it was decorated with
  hideous and disgusting carvings and statues so monstrous that the girl after
  her first look quickly averted her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What is this place? Where are you taking me?" she asked Thakoor.</p>

  <p>"You are on holy ground," he replied. "This is the temple of the Mahadevi,
  the great goddess, Kali, the Black One, and shelters her living
  reincarnation."</p>

  <p>He helped the girl to dismount but did not lead her toward the central
  building. Instead he conducted her to one of the low buildings against the
  outer wall of the enclosure. Here a number of girls and women, some chatting
  and laughing, some quarreling, and all busy with sewing, fancy work and
  beaded work, looked up at their approach. All conversation ceased on the
  appearance of the old priest, and he signaled to an ancient and toothless
  hag, who put down her sewing with apparent reluctance and, rising, came
  forward.</p>

  <p>After she had received brief instructions from the old man, which Ramona
  did not understand, the old trot took the girl's arm and led her into a
  building.</p>

  <p>Once inside and out of earshot of the priest the old hag cackled
  toothlessly, "Heh! Heh! Heh! Old Marjanah has been ordered to look after you
  because she can speak English. Are you hungry?"</p>

  <p>"I have not eaten since yesterday," Ramona replied.</p>

  <p>"If I were in your place I should not eat anything unless it were deadly
  poison," mumbled the old hag. "Once I was brought here as you have been
  brought, and look at me now! It was either this or the teeth and fangs of the
  Black One."</p>

  <p>For a moment fear showed in her eyes and she shuddered as if the very name
  of the Black One struck terror into her heart. Then she resumed her toothless
  grin and added, "Come, I will find you something to eat."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; PURSUIT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE water hole which the maharaja had said was near-by
  proved to be a good six miles from the camp. Here a shooting platform had
  been constructed for some previous hunt, and to this the three men and the
  gun bearer mounted by means of a ladder, while the <i>mahout</i> took the
  elephant away.</p>

  <p>The hunters waited expectantly at the water hole until sunset without
  sight of a single sambar.</p>

  <p>"Be very quiet now," said the maharaja. "The jeraos will soon be coming
  down to the water to drink."</p>

  <p>They waited patiently, but no sambar put in an appearance. The sun dropped
  below the horizon and the stars blossomed forth in the gathering dusk.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Trevor cupped his hand to his ear and said, "I hear shooting. It
  is in the direction of the camp. Can it be possible that they have been
  attacked during our absence?"</p>

  <p>"I hardly think so," the maharaja replied, "but we will return and find
  out. No use waiting longer for the sambar. They must have taken fright at
  something and gone to another water hole."</p>

  <p>He fired his rifle into the air and presently the <i>mahout</i> came up
  directly beneath their shooting platform with the elephant. One by one they
  lowered themselves to the beast's broad back and entered the howdah.</p>

  <p>"Back to camp! Make haste!" the maharaja told his <i>mahout</i>.</p>

  <p>It was dark when they reached the camp and when they did they found it in
  the utmost confusion.</p>

  <p>Georgia Trevor and Doña Isabella were frightened and tearful. Only a few
  of the maharaja's men were in evidence and half of the elephants were
  gone.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong? What has happened?" Trevor shouted, springing down from
  the howdah and closely followed by Don Francesco.</p>

  <p>"The camp was raided by Rajputs," Georgia Trevor replied, "and Ramona has
  disappeared. We do not know whether she escaped and has become lost in the
  jungle or whether the robbers carried her off."</p>

  <p>"Why, this is terrible!" exclaimed Trevor.</p>

  <p>"It is worse than that, <i>amigo</i>," said Don Francesco, passing a
  comforting arm about the shoulders of his sobbing wife.</p>

  <p>The maharaja had meanwhile dismounted and was now speaking rapidly in Urdu
  to a small group of his frightened men. After a few moments' conversation
  with them he returned to his guests.</p>

  <p>"I am devastated with grief that this attack should have occurred in my
  camp and under the eyes of my own men," he said. "Unfortunately, the raiding
  Rajputs were all armed with rifles, and my guardsmen could do nothing against
  them with their spears. Also the elephants stampeded and more than half of
  them have disappeared. The <i>mahouts</i> are out trying to recapture those
  that have not yet been found. However, I hope that we will be able to take
  the trail at the first break of day. I know in advance where it will lead
  because these Rajputs could only have come from Rissapur, and I intend to see
  to it that they be made to pay for this unwarranted and illegal raid upon my
  camp in British territory. It must be that they marked the beauty of the
  girl, and taking her for an oriental, decided to raid the camp and steal her
  for their maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Do you expect us to wait here all night while Ramona is being carried off
  by those ruffians?" Trevor demanded.</p>

  <p>The maharaja shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly. "Much as I deplore
  inaction in a case of this kind," he said, "I do not see what else there is
  for us to do."</p>

  <p>"We have flashlights in our baggage," said Trevor. "Give me a gun and, by
  God, I'll set out on that trail afoot. You may follow at your leisure with
  your elephants."</p>

  <p>"I, too, <i>amigo</i>," said Don Frencesco.</p>

  <p>"Why, if you feel that way about it we will start at once," said the
  maharaja, coolly adjusting his monocle. "However, as I attempted to explain,
  there can be but one distination for these miscreants, and that is Rissapur.
  They hare two hours' start on us, and in any event, it will he impossible for
  us to overtake their swift horses when we have only elephants to
  ride."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THREE elephants were quickly requisitioned. On the first
  rode the maharaja and his two male guests, all armed with rifles. The two
  ladies, similarly armed, rode in the second howdah, and behind them came the
  third elephant bearing a half dozen of the maharaja's guards.</p>

  <p>A tracker ran ahead carrying a flashlight. The prints of the horses' hoofs
  were plain enough in the soft earth and led them directly to an abandoned
  camp, where the remains of a huge fire smoldered.</p>

  <p>"Odd that they should build such a tremendous fire," said Trevor, getting
  out of the howdah and slipping to the ground. "I wonder why?"</p>

  <p>He poked about in the ashes, and at the edges discovered the singed
  remains of a false beard and several bits of smoldering cloth. These he
  stamped out and on a sudden impulse thrust all into his pockets for
  evidence.</p>

  <p>Further poking about in the ashes revealed a calcined human thigh bone and
  several other bones less easily recognizable, but which he judged must be
  human.</p>

  <p>"Some one has been burned&mdash;perhaps burned alive here," he cried.
  "Good God! I wonder&mdash;But surely these Rajputs would not have abducted
  Ramona for the purpose of burning her alive. The Muslims don't do such
  things, do they?"</p>

  <p>"One cannot tell what these Rajputs will do," replied the maharaja.
  "However, I would not suspect them of that. My men informed me that an old
  Brahmin disappeared from the camp along with the girl. It is possible that he
  was slain to seal his lips and his body burned to hide the evidence of the
  crime.</p>

  <p>"Then let us proceed on the trail at once," said Trevor, mounting once
  more to the howdah.</p>

  <p>They rode onward through the night and all the following day. Evening
  found them on the outskirts of a small village surrounded by rice paddys. The
  old village headman, accompanied by a number of natives, advanced to greet
  them.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen any horsemen pass this way?" the maharaja asked the old
  headman.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I did not see them, highness, though I heard the clatter of hoofs
  during the night," replied the headman. "But I saw a much stranger
  sight."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" the maharaja asked.</p>

  <p>"Tonight at dusk the dogs began barking near the edge of the paddy fields
  and my people investigated. They saw a naked white man of marvelous strength
  and agility, whose hair was the color of burnished copper. They hurled their
  spears at him, but he escaped by swinging away through the trees more swiftly
  than a monkey."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! That was Jan! It must have been!" cried Trevor. "Which way did
  he go?"</p>

  <p>"That we do not know," the old headman replied, "nor were we able to find
  out, as he left no trail, but traveled through the trees."</p>

  <p>Trevor shook his head hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"I know," he replied. "It was thus he traveled in the South American
  jungle. If Jan wishes to hide his trail there is no man on earth who can
  follow him."</p>

  <p>He turned to the maharaja.</p>

  <p>Let us proceed on the trail of Ramona," he said. "Perhaps we will again
  cross the trail of my son."</p>

  <p>The half hour's ride brought them out upon a broad moonlit highway.</p>

  <p>"As I predicted," said the maharaja, "the trail leads toward the capital
  of my neighbor prince. This is the road to Rissapur.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE had only ridden a short distance along this road when
  Babu Chandra Kumar came hurrying up behind them, riding his small, swift pad
  elephant, piloted by Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>, and accompanied by Kupta, the
  hillman.</p>

  <p>He rode up beside the howdah of the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been, you fat toad?" said the maharaja, glaring down at
  the babu through his monocle.</p>

  <p>"Came as fastly as could do, highness," Chandra Kumar replied, and
  continued with a meaning look, "Is great news abroad among villages. It seems
  that youngly <i>sahib</i>, son of Trevor Sahib, is in vicinity."</p>

  <p>"I have already heard that news," the maharaja told him, and there was a
  look in his eyes which caused the babu to cringe. He had told his master that
  Jan was dead&mdash;had believed it himself&mdash;and the evidence that he was
  still alive struck terror into his heart. "We are following the trail of the
  miscreants who ran off with the young <i>memsahib</i>. In the meantime you
  will take six men and go in search of the son of Trevor Sahib, and," he added
  meaningly, "you will bend every effort to find him. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, highness, humbly servant understands with perfection," said Chandra
  Kumar.</p>

  <p>He nudged the <i>mahout</i>, who kicked the elephant behind the ear, and
  the great beast turned and lumbered off in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>They had ridden for another mile along the road when they met another
  party mounted on elephants and just coming onto the highway.</p>

  <p>The royal trappings and the magnificent howdah of the elephant in the lead
  made it manifest that the beast carried a personage of considerable
  importance.</p>

  <p>The two leading elephants met, and instantly their <i>mahouts</i> caused
  them to stop and raise their trunks in salute.</p>

  <p>Seated in the ornate howdah in solitary state was a large, powerful
  looking man whose skin was so light that he might have been mistaken for a
  European. His thick, jet black beard was parted in the middle and combed
  outward toward both sides in the manner common among Rajputs. An enormous
  ruby blazed from the clasp on the front of his white turban and behind it two
  aigrettes pointed upward. His rich clothing was wholly oriental, and gems of
  fabulous value sparkled on his fingers.</p>

  <p>As the beasts raised their trunks in salute, he called out:</p>

  <p>"<i>Salaam</i>, maharaja!"</p>

  <p>And the Maharaja of Varuda replied, "<i>Salaam</i>!"</p>

  <p>Then he introduced his two companions.</p>

  <p>"Maharaja, permit me to present Trevor Sahib of North America and Suarez
  Sahib of South America." And to the two men he said: "This is my friend and
  neighbor, Abdur Rahman, Maharaja of Rissapur."</p>

  <p>The Rajput maharaja acknowledged the introduction with a smile that showed
  powerful white teeth.</p>

  <p>"You honor my little kingdom with your presence," he said. "I trust that I
  may have the pleasure of entertaining you in my capital."</p>

  <p>"We should be delighted, but unfortunately our call is not a social one,"
  replied the Maharaja of Varuda. "We have come on business of a serious and
  delicate nature."</p>

  <p>"If it is of a private nature perhaps we had best find another place to
  discuss it."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not private, since all within earshot know of it already. Our
  camp was raided last evening by a band of your Rajput warriors, and a young
  <i>memsahib</i> was stolen. No doubt they made the mistake of believing her
  an oriental and perhaps one of your subjects, and will expect your
  commendation for this act. We demand that the lady be immediately released
  and that her abductors be punished."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Maharaja of Rissapur looked dumfounded.</p>

  <p>"Where did this raid take place?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In <i>British</i> territory," the other ruler replied, with a significant
  accent on the word "British."</p>

  <p>"Unless steps are taken to right this wrong at once, I shall be compelled
  to report the matter to the British Resident."</p>

  <p>Come with me," invited Abdur Rahman. "We were searching for an elephant of
  mine and found his trail with that of another beast, both evidently stolen by
  a man and boy who had built a camp fire nearby. They eluded us, but that
  matter can wait, in view of this shocking news you bring me. I will make a
  full investigation at once, and if any of my people have been guilty of such
  a dastardly act you have my assurance that they will be punished, and that so
  far as I am able to do so, I will make restitution."</p>

  <p>The two parties rode on to Rissapur together, and when he had lodged his
  guests in his palace, the Maharaja of Rissapur immediately launched an
  inquiry into the affair of the evening before. But though he set every agency
  at his command to the task of tracing the miscreants, who were supposed to
  have ridden straight to the city of Rissapur, he was unable to obtain the
  slightest trace of them.</p>

  <p>At noon, the following day, the British Resident, Sir Cecil Bayne,
  called.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, angular man with a florid face, a tremendous Roman nose and
  a drooping, sandy mustache. He was immediately informed of the mission of the
  visitors, and expressed his regrets that such an outrage should take place in
  British territory, assuring the distracted friends and foster parents of the
  girl that the powerful arm of the British Raj would be exerted on their
  behalf.</p>

  <p>The Maharaja of Rissapur continued his inquiries about the culprits who
  were supposed to be lodged within the city, but in vain. No party of Rajputs
  such as that described by the two ladies had been seen to enter the city at
  any time.</p>

  <p>After tiffin Sir Cecil sat tête-à-tête with Georgia Trevor on the broad
  veranda. For the moment the others were out of earshot.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "I can't understand the Rajputs committing such a
  crime. I have been the Resident here for ten years and have never heard of
  anything to equal it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know," said Georgia Trevor, "I have been wondering if they really
  were Rajputs. Our rifles had been tampered with, loaded with blank
  cartridges, showing that the raid had been planned in advance, and that here
  was at least one accomplice in the camp, and as I struggled with one of them,
  I grasped his beard and it came away in my hand."</p>

  <p>"Ah! A planned raid and a false beard," exclaimed Sir Cecil. "A light
  begins to dawn on me. I shall start some investigations of my own
  immediately. In the meantime do me the favor of keeping this matter a secret
  from both of the maharajas. I may have some interesting news shortly."</p>

  <p>"I do hope you will be able to find Ramona soon," said Georgia Trevor.</p>

  <p>"And I assure you," replied Sir Cecil with a bow, "that your hopes are
  well founded."</p><br>

  <p class="first">AT this moment the Maharaja of Varuda and the other guests
  came up.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we can accomplish nothing more here," he said, "and suggest
  that we start at once to my capital. We should be able to reach it some time
  this evening if we start immediately. We can then set going the forces at my
  disposal and operate from there as a base."</p>

  <p>He bowed to the ruler of Rissapur, who had just returned from a conference
  with his deewan.</p>

  <p>"With your leave," he said, "we will take our departure. Your hospitality
  has been magnificent. I trust that you will pay me the honor of a visit
  soon."</p>

  <p>"You are most kind," Abdur Rahman replied. "It is my hope that I shall
  soon be able to bring you news of the <i>memsahib</i> and a complete solution
  of her mysterious disappearance."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE MAN-HUNT</h2>

  <p class="first">THOUGH he had known Sharma for but a short time, Jan had
  conceived a strong affection for the little orphaned brown boy, and so when
  he found that the lad had disappeared from the camp and saw the tracks of
  many strange elephants and men, he feared that he had met with foul play.</p>

  <p>However, careful examination of the river bank showed him that the two
  elephants, Rangini and Malikshah, had not emerged on this side of the river.
  Instead he saw the small footprints of the boy spaced wide apart, showing
  that he had run down to the water to join them. From this he judged that the
  boy and the two elephants had taken alarm at the approach of the larger party
  and had crossed the river in order to hide their trail.</p>

  <p>Since the stream was so broad at this point that he was unable to spring
  across by means of the overhanging trees, and the ugly snouts of numerous
  muggers were in evidence, he decided to build a raft of bamboo. With his
  sharp jungle knife he quickly cut a number of large bamboo stalks in the
  nearest thicket and soon had a raft four feet wide and fifteen feet long
  bound together with tough, fibrous bark.</p>

  <p>With a long bamboo pole in his hand he launched the raft and started
  across the stream. The crocodiles for the most part paid no attention to him,
  but there was one, a tremendous fellow, judging by the size and distance
  apart of the eye and nose bumps which projected above the water, who glided
  near him and was soon following the raft.</p>

  <p>Jan kept an eye on him while he vigorously poled his frail craft toward
  the opposite bank. But he suddenly learned that it is often inadvisable to
  try to do two things at once, for the tip of his pole plunged down into the
  soft mud and stuck there. The raft had meanwhile glided so far ahead that Jan
  was compelled either to relinquish his hold on the pole or to let the raft
  glide out from beneath him.</p>

  <p>He swiftly decided on the former course, and when he had regained his
  balance found himself without means of propulsion, as the spear which lay on
  the raft at his feet was not long enough to reach the bottom in midstream. He
  tried using the spear blade as a paddle, but made very indifferent progress
  against the current.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the watchful mugger glided closer and closer. Jan could
  see the dark outline of his body in the water now, and it was tremendous.
  Frantically he paddled with the ineffectual spear head, and the mugger, as if
  sensing his panic, suddenly dived beneath the raft. Then its huge tail shot
  up out of the water and struck the frail craft amidships, shattering the
  bamboo poles and breaking the bindings that held them together. Jan found
  himself struggling in the water amid the shattered remains of his raft. Then
  a pair of gaping jaws opened to seize him.</p>

  <p>He still clutched the spear, so now, treading water, he grasped it with
  both hands, raised it above his head and rammed it with all his strength down
  the yawning throat. The jaws clicked shut on the shaft, shearing it asunder,
  and Jan seized upon the moment of respite to whip out his jungle knife and
  dive beneath his formidable adversary. He grasped a taloned foreleg with one
  hand, and hanging on, plunged the keen knife again and again into the
  leathery belly. The saurian turned over and over in the water, which was now
  dyed crimson with its own blood, in an effort to dislodge its intended victim
  who had suddenly become a most dangerous foe. Jan hung on until he knew that
  his blade had pierced the reptilian heart; then he relinquished his hold and
  fought his way to the surface.</p>

  <p>He saw other menacing snouts converging toward him now, and gripping the
  knife in his teeth, swam for the bank at his utmost speed. Most of the
  muggers, however, were deterred by the smell of their comrade's blood and
  paused where the carcass had sunk to the bottom. Only two kept on after the
  jungle man, and these he soon outdistanced.</p>

  <p>Panting from his exertions, he splashed up through the shallows and onto
  the bank, where his two pursuers gave up the chase. After a brief rest he set
  out along the stream in search of the trail left by Rangini and Malikshah,
  and presently found it about a quarter of a mile below the point where they
  had entered the water. He drank a deep draft from the river and instantly set
  out on the trail. It went straight back into the jungle and was so plainly
  marked that he could follow it as easily as a city dweller follows a
  boulevard."</p><br>

  <p class="first">PRESENTLY he began to grow conscious of a gnawing hunger and
  kept a sharp lookout for game. The average white man traveling through this
  same jungle would have trod noisily, causing all wild things to take cover.
  But the jungle bred Jan instinctively moved as quietly and cautiously as the
  beasts themselves. And thus it was that he came suddenly and unexpectedly
  into the midst of a group of wild hogs which were rooting for forage beneath
  the leaf mould that carpeted the jungle floor.</p>

  <p>The sows and pigs instantly took to their heels with grunts of alarm, but
  the old boar, evidently the patriarch of the herd, stood his ground, lowered
  his head and charged. Jan avoided those gouging tusks by leaping clear over
  the charging beast, then before the boar could again face him, turned and
  whipped out his jungle knife. The boar instantly whirled and charged again.
  Once more the jungle man sprung over him, but this time he alighted, facing
  the rear of the animal. Before the tusker could turn he had plunged a long
  knife into its savage heart.</p>

  <p>Jan crouched beside his kill, and was soon dining on raw, warm boar's
  flesh. He found it exceedingly tough and coarse, but this bothered him not at
  all. He had often eaten food that was much tougher and far less tasty. When
  he had his fill, he slashed a rattan, drank the clear water which ran from
  the cut end, and, much refreshed, resumed the trail.</p>

  <p>He had expected to be able to overtake the two elephants in an hour or so,
  but soon found that they had traveled much faster than he anticipated and
  though he knew he was gaining upon them, they were still out of sight and
  hearing when the sun had reached the zenith.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, however, he heard the sound of heavy animals coming
  through the jungle and men talking in a language which he did not understand.
  He sprang up the nearest tree and out upon a limb to investigate. Three
  elephants were coming toward him, and on the first he made out the
  contrasting forms of the fat Babu Chandra Kumar and the small, wiry Kupta,
  both of whom he recognized. The babu carried a heavy double-barreled express
  rifle and a man on each of the other elephants held a repeating military
  rifle.</p>

  <p>Jan shouted in friendly greeting and the babu looked up. Then to the
  surprise and consternation of the jungle man, he raised the heavy rifle to
  his shoulder and fired.</p>

  <p>Jan felt a searing pain at his right temple and crashed downward through
  the interlacing branches as consciousness left him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE BLACK TIGRESS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Maharaja of Varuda rode out of Rissapur in the howdah
  with his two male guests. Shortly after they had passed the city gate they
  met the maharaja's followers, some on pad elephants and others on foot,
  bringing up the camp equipment and baggage.</p>

  <p>The maharaja ordered them to fall in behind and proceed until they had
  come to the red shrine of Ganesha, when he ordered a halt and dismounted from
  the howdah.</p>

  <p>"Since we are faced with so difficult a problem," he said, "I am going to
  make an offering at the shrine of the God of Wisdom and will remain here some
  time in meditation. My men will conduct you to Varudapur, where I will rejoin
  you."</p>

  <p>He signaled to the <i>mahout</i> of one of the smaller pad elephants and
  ordered the baggage the beast carried removed and distributed among the
  others. Then he commanded its <i>mahout</i> to remain and signaled the
  cavalcade to proceed.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were out of sight in the dust of the roadway he mounted
  the pad elephant and told the <i>mahout</i> to follow the path which turned
  off from the highway beside the shrine. A ride of several miles took him to
  the bank of the river at the point where Zafarlilla Khan had met Thakoor, the
  priest, on that same morning.</p>

  <p>As soon as the maharaja appeared on the river bank, the two yellow robed
  figures emerged from the jungle on the other side, tumbled into a boat and
  swiftly headed across the stream in his direction. As they drew near, the
  maharaja recognized the wrinkled features of Thakoor in the front of the
  boat.</p>

  <p>"The white dove was brought this morning, highness," said Thakoor as the
  boat grounded.</p>

  <p>"Good!" the maharaja replied, stepping into the boat. Then he called to
  the <i>mahout</i>.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he said. "I will return shortly after sunset."</p>

  <p>On the opposite side of the river a prancing horse was saddled and ready,
  held by one of the temple guards. Six other guards sat their mounts nearby
  and immediately fell in behind the maharaja as he galloped off along the
  trail to the temple. Thakoor also mounted a horse and followed.</p>

  <p>When the cavalcade reached the bronze gates of the temple enclosure they
  were instantly swung wide and attendants sprang forward to seize the
  maharaja's bridle as he leaped from the saddle.</p>

  <p>He waited impatiently until the aged Thakoor came up.</p>

  <p>"Where is the white dove?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have had her installed in the apartment which your highness ordered
  prepared for her," replied Thakoor, "and have set old Marjanah to watch
  her."</p>

  <p>"I will see her at once," announced the maharaja , starting toward the
  women's quarters and not deigning to notice the obsequious <i>salaams</i> of
  priests, attendants and laymen all around him.</p>

  <p>The guard opened the door of the apartment at his approach, and he entered
  a tiled hallway where Marjanah, the old hag, sat cross legged on a rug beside
  the curtained doorway.</p>

  <p>"The white dove is within," she croaked, and springing up, drew the
  curtain aside.</p>

  <p>The maharaja strode into the room. At the far end Ramona reclined upon a
  magnificently upholstered divan, amid soft, silken cushions.</p>

  <p>Her khaki clothing had been replaced by a scanty oriental costume which
  revealed every seductive curve and line of her slender, youthful figure.
  Jewels glittered from heavy wristlets and anklets. Her jet black hair was
  coiffed in the oriental manner and covered by a web of strung pearls, and her
  satiny skin exhaled the rarest and costliest of perfumes.</p>

  <p>With a start of pleased surprise she sprang to her feet at the sight of
  the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what magic you employed in order to find me so quickly," she
  said, "but you are most welcome."</p>

  <p>"I must admit that I encountered considerable difficulty in tracing you
  here," the maharaja replied, smiling ingratiatingly.</p>

  <p>"And now you will take me back to my people at once?" she asked. "What of
  my abductors? Have they been captured?"</p>

  <p>"No, but my men are on the trail. As for returning you promptly to your
  people, there are forces at work with which I am going to find it most
  difficult to cope."</p>

  <p>"But you are the Maharaja of Varuda," she said. "Is not this temple within
  your territory?"</p>

  <p>"That is true," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And are you not Varuda's absolute despot?"</p>

  <p>"I am the temporal ruler," he answered. "But this is holy ground. In this
  enclosure the High Priest of Kali is ruler. If I were to attempt to cross him
  in any way I would have a bloody revolution on my hands and would be sure to
  be dethroned, if not assassinated."</p>

  <p>"But surely you can reason with him," said Ramona, frightened at this
  amazing revelation.</p>

  <p>"I have already attempted to do so," the maharaja replied, "but he is
  adamantine. He claims that he paid five thousand rupees for you this morning
  and that you have already been consecrated as a sacrifice to the Black
  Goddess."</p>

  <p>"Sacrifice!" she exclaimed in alarm. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Come and I will show," he told her.</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, and the old hag entered the room with a silken shawl
  which she draped about the shoulders of the girl. Then she held the curtain
  aside, and as the two walked down the tiled hallway the guard opened the door
  and salaamed.</p>

  <p>The maharaja conducted Ramona across the garden and up the stone steps of
  the Black Temple, where two more guards saluted. Within its portals the air
  was pungent with the smell of burning incense. But there was another scent,
  so acrid and powerful that even the sickening sweet incense did not hide
  it&mdash;and though she did not recognize it, it brought to the girl a
  strange foreboding which she could not shake off.</p>

  <p>At first she saw only a gigantic black idol of most hideous aspect.</p>

  <p>"It is the image of Kali, the Black One," said the maharaja.</p>

  <p>The Black One was a most fearsome sight. Her eyes were red, and her
  breasts, face and four giant hands were smeared with blood. One gory hand
  held a sword, one a trident, one a club, but one a shield. Her hair was
  matted and unkempt, and the tongue which protruded between her projecting,
  fang-like teeth, dripped blood. She wore a necklace of skulls, earrings of
  dead bodies, and a girdle of serpents, and stood upon the body of Siva.</p>

  <p>"Can it be possible," said Ramona, "that human beings actually worship
  such a hideous object?"</p>

  <p>"Some people, yes. They worship the symbol instead of the reality. We
  enlightened ones worship the great goddess herself and her genuine
  incarnations."</p>

  <p>"You believe, then, that Kali once lived in this horrible form?"</p>

  <p>"That is right," the maharaja replied. "She takes and has taken many
  forms. She is a necessity to earth and to all living creatures, for we
  require not only to be created and to be preserved for a time&mdash;the
  respective functions of Brahm and Vishnu&mdash;but it is equally necessary
  that we be destroyed again and again in our various reincarnations until we
  have attained that unutterable bliss and grandeur, incorporation into the
  body of Brahm. So, like Siva, her husband, Kali carries out the important
  work of destruction so necessary to all living things in order that they may
  be advanced toward Nirvana."</p>

  <p>"And what would it profit a living creature to lose its identity and to
  merge as one of the tiny soul cells with the spiritual body of Brahm?" Ramona
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah! That is a part of our philosophy which you of the West find it
  difficult to understand or appreciate. The loss of all personal consciousness
  by absorption into the divine and the extinction of every personal desire and
  passion leads to the attainment of perfect impersonal beatitude. In that
  condition we are no longer men; we become gods."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I could not appreciate a loss of my personality or
  individual consciousness," said Ramona. "It seems to me that your Nirvana
  amounts to nothing more than oblivion."</p>

  <p>"That is what our early philosophers called it, though they used another
  term," said the maharaja . "They spoke of it as the 'blowing out.' The human
  soul, they said, when it attained its last reincarnation was blown out like a
  candle. Thus all cares and tribulations of the many lives through which we
  are compelled to pass are lost in the sweet oblivion of oneness with
  Brahm."</p>

  <p>"I can see now why a destroyer is necessary in your system of philosophy,"
  Ramona said. "You spoke of sacrifice. I believe you said that I have been
  brought here as a sacrifice to Kali."</p>

  <p>"That is true," the maharaja replied. "Since Kali is a destroyer she loves
  blood&mdash;wallows in it&mdash;drinks it." He pointed to the black idol
  which towered above them. "Look at the blood on her hands, smeared upon her
  breasts and on her face! See the gore that drips from her tongue! Every life
  snuffed out through a human agency is a sacrifice to her, which will bring
  manifold blessings upon the one who makes the sacrifice. And the great
  goddess is especially pleased at the sacrifice of handsome young men and
  beautiful women."</p>

  <p>"Then I was brought here to be slain to appease this monstrosity?" Ramona
  asked.</p>

  <p>"To please the great Black Mother," the maharaja corrected. "She has been
  especially gracious to her devotees in this temple as she has appeared to
  them in living form."</p>

  <p>"You mean in the form of a woman?"</p>

  <p>"No, I will show you."</p>

  <p>He led her closer to the pedestal on which the giant idol stood, and she
  noticed for the first time that it consisted of a cage, the sides and front
  of which were iron bars.</p>

  <p>There was a barred door in front of the cage, and at the rear a door of
  bronze was set in the black stone wall. It was from this cage that the
  powerful and acrid scent which Ramona had noticed on entering the temple
  emanated&mdash;the scent of a great cat and of partly decayed flesh. On the
  floor of the cage lay part of a gnawed spine, a slender brown finger tipped
  with henna and a fragment of a human skull to which the black hair still
  clung.</p>

  <p>Closely watching the effect of his words on the girl&mdash;for he had a
  definite plan in telling and showing her all this&mdash;the maharaja smiled
  as he noted the horror in her eyes. Now for the climax!</p>"<br>

  <p class="first">HE drew back a lever at the side of the cage. The bronze
  door in the rear swung open. For a moment a pair of slanting eyes gleamed
  redly in the darkness behind it. Then a great black cat sprang out into the
  cage. Not a leopard, but a huge tigress whose glossy fur was black as
  jet&mdash;one of the rarest color phases of this animal.</p>

  <p>Ramona involuntarily drew back with a gasp of dismay as the tigress upon
  sighting her emitted a roar and sprang furiously at the bars through which
  the girl peered. The maharaja flung a supporting arm around her as she seemed
  about to faint.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said. "I did not mean to frighten you, but you were curious to
  learn the fate which had been prepared for you and I thought it best to show
  you."</p>

  <p>He led her out into the sunlight once more, where she conquered the
  vertigo which had assailed her. But she could not shake off the feeling of
  horror which the sights in that black temple had engendered.</p>

  <p>Having returned her to her apartment, he said, "I must go now, though you
  may rest assured that I will do all in my power to save you. However, the
  decision as to whether you will be saved or not rests with you."</p>

  <p>"How is that?" Ramona asked.</p>

  <p>"If I were to claim you as my bride, my maharanee , and furnish a slave
  girl to take your place, the priests would be compelled to consent to the
  exchange."</p>

  <p>Ramona looked at him searchingly for a moment.</p>

  <p>"A light begins to dawn on me," she said. "I have observed how every one
  in this temple, even the high priest himself, regards you as his lord and
  master. It is you who had me kidnaped and brought here&mdash;you who staged
  this horrible display in order to frighten me into marrying you. I tell you
  now once and for all that rather than marry you or any other man living
  except Jan Trevor, whom I love, I would voluntarily walk into the cage with
  that black tigress which you pretend to believe is a reincarnation of your
  ugly blood-thirsty goddess."</p>

  <p>The maharaja bowed calmly. "I see you have determined to misunderstand
  me," he said, "and at the moment I have no time to argue the point with you.
  Suffice it to say that the truth will make itself manifest in good time. Your
  sacrifice has been set for some days hence, so you will have ample time to
  reconsider if you care to do so. If not, just as sure as there is a sun in
  heaven, Kali will claim you for her own, and neither I nor any power on earth
  can save you."</p>

  <p>Screwing his monocle into his eye, he again bowed formally, and turning
  strode out of the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; MALIKSHAH TO THE RESCUE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE babu uttered a cry of exultation when he saw Jan
  crashing down through the branches.</p>

  <p>"Good shot! Very excellent shot!" he chuckled. "Let me down so I may make
  sure of him."</p>

  <p>He prodded Sarkar, the <i>mahout</i>, who caused the elephant to kneel,
  and ran toward his victim accompanied by the blood-thirsty Kupta, who already
  had his kukrie in his hand, and by several spearmen.</p>

  <p>But there was another who had heard Jan's shout and the shot which
  followed it. Malikshah, the bull elephant, had been feeding by himself in a
  little glade not two hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>He pricked up his ears, raised his trunk and sniffed the breeze. No, his
  ears had not deceived him, for he recognized the unmistakable scent of the
  <i>sahib</i> whom he had instinctively liked at first sight.</p>

  <p>He climbed up out of the ravine with a rapidity remarkable in a beast so
  huge and trotted toward the spot where his trunk told him the jungle man lay.
  And scarcely had he arrived within sight of the fallen Jan when he saw a
  group of brown men coming from the opposite direction. Some carried guns,
  some spears and one a huge wicked looking knife. And the wise, old Malikshah
  instinctively knew that they meant no good to his friend who lay helpless and
  bleeding on the ground.</p>

  <p>Trumpeting angrily, he charged the approaching group with stiffened trunk
  and tail. The babu took one look at the charging bull, cast his heavy gun
  upon the ground and turned to flee. The others, equally frightened, dashed
  off into the underbrush on both sides, leaving their leader to his fate. It
  was soon upon him, for he was a most indifferent runner. The sinuous trunk
  wound about Chandra Kumar's fat waist. Then he was swung aloft and hurled
  through the air to alight among the branches of a scrubby pandanus. Although
  the tree saved his life, it did so most painfully, as the saw-edged leaves
  pierced his tender flesh in a thousand places.</p>

  <p>Malikshah trumpeted belligerently and looked about for the others, but all
  had disappeared; so he returned to where Jan lay.</p>

  <p>Tenderly he nuzzled the jungle man with his trunk, but elicited no
  response. Finding it impossible to arouse him, he picked up the limp body and
  strode away, making for the spot where he knew Rangini would be feeding,
  attended by Sharma.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1302971h-images/JanInIndia-05.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Presently he found them in a sun-dappled glade. Rangini was contentedly
  stuffing tender leaves and twigs into her huge mouth, with the little brown
  boy lazily stretched out at full length upon her broad back, inhaling the
  fragrance of an orchid which he had plucked from its lofty perch, and
  watching the birds, bees, and butterflies that flitted around him.</p>

  <p>At first he paid no attention as Malikshah came toward them, but when the
  huge bull drew closer he instantly recognized the limp burden dangling from
  his trunk.</p>

  <p>He spoke sharply to Rangini, who lowered him to the ground, then ran
  toward Malikshah and patted his trunk. Gently the giant beast laid the
  unconscious man on the ground.</p>

  <p>Sharma uttered a cry of consternation when he saw that his friend's face
  was covered with blood, which had drained from a long furrow in his right
  temple. They were a considerable distance from any water, so the lad searched
  until he had found a suitable rattan. Then he made a cup from a folded leaf
  and filled it with the cold, clear and slightly bitter sap. With this he
  returned to the side of Jan, whose fluttering eyelids foreshadowed returning
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>Raising the blood-smeared head, he held his improvised cup to the jungle
  man's lips. Jan sputtered, choked and then swallowed the liquid, which seemed
  to revive him. He opened his eyes and looked up into the brown ones of
  Sharma.</p>

  <p>"Where are we? What happened?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Sharma replied. "Malikshah brought you here just now and
  some time ago I heard the report of a rifle in the distance. I believe you
  have been shot."</p>

  <p>"That is true. I remember now," Jan replied. "It was the babu who shot me.
  I called to him, believing him my friend, yet he raised his gun and
  fired."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he did not recognize you," said Sharma.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Jan answered, "but that is doubtful. He knew me well enough,
  and I have not yet solved the mystery of the attack on me which took place on
  board my father's yacht. He may have been the one who tried to kill me
  before, and having failed, tried again."</p>

  <p>"But why should this babu wish to kill you?" asked the boy. "I have seen
  him for many months in the service of the maharaja, and he always seemed a
  gentle, jovial soul. His one great weakness was his love of money."</p>

  <p>"That may be the solution," said Jan after some thought. "Perhaps some one
  has paid him to kill me. It will bear investigation."</p>

  <p>Though dizzy from loss of blood, Jan rose to his feet. His wound throbbed
  painfully, but had bled sufficiently to cleanse itself, and was closing.</p>

  <p>Jan signaled to Malikshah, who lifted him to a seat on his head.</p>

  <p>"Which way is the river from here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I will show you," Sharma replied.</p>

  <p>Resuming his seat on the neck of Rangini, he spoke to her and she started
  off through the jungle, with Malikshah lumbering behind her. Presently they
  came to the river, where Jan washed the blood from his face and drank
  deeply.</p>

  <p>"I have lost my spear," he said, "and it seems that we have need of other
  weapons, not only for hunting but for protection. If you will look around for
  some small, sharp bits of stone for arrowheads I will see what I can do
  toward making bows and arrows."</p>

  <p>The jungle man searched for an hour before he found wood tough enough for
  his purpose. But once he had found it, he swiftly hewed out two bows with the
  keen jungle knife&mdash;a large and powerful one for himself and a smaller
  one for the boy.</p>

  <p>Twisted bark fiber made stout, tough bow strings, and reeds provided
  light, straight shafts for the arrows.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the river bank he found that Sharma had collected
  quite a heap of small jagged stones. From among these Jan selected a number,
  which roughly simulated the shape of arrowheads, patiently chipped and
  notched them and bound them to the shafts he had brought with him.</p>

  <p>"Now we will require feathers to make the shafts fly true," he said. "I
  saw some pheasants a while ago, and they will not only supply the feathers
  but the meat of which we are in need. Wait here and practice with your new
  bow and arrows."</p>

  <p>Sharma stuck a branch into the sand for target and practiced assiduously
  for more than an hour. At the end of that time Jan returned with a brace of
  pheasants. While the jungle man plucked and skinned the birds, Sharma
  gathered wood and lighted a fire. The two dined on grilled pheasant and had
  for dessert a mangosteen, an evil smelling but delicious tasting fruit, which
  fell from a tall tree nearby before they had finished their meat course.</p>

  <p>Their meal over, the two set to work to feather all the arrows they had
  manufactured, and the versatile Sharma wove two quivers from rattan while Jan
  scraped and polished the rough cut bows."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEY had completed their labors and were assembling material
  with which to build a sleeping platform in a tall tree nearby when Jan
  suddenly caught the scent of strange elephants and men. So keenly developed
  from his years of jungle life was his sense of smell that he could not only
  distinguish the scent of men, but could discern between individuals. And so
  he knew without seeing him that the fat babu was following.</p>

  <p>Malikshah and Rangini were having their afternoon bath in the river at a
  point about a quarter of a mile from where Jan and Sharma stood, so they had
  not sensed the approach of the intruders.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," Jan told the boy. "The babu and his men are following us and
  I am going to see what they are about."</p>

  <p>Grasping a thick vine, he went up hand over hand and swung off through the
  interlaced branches. Soon he came within sight and sound of the party that
  had followed him. The babu had regained his rifle and was riding upon the
  leading pad elephant as before.</p>

  <p>But Kupta preceded them on foot, his eyes glued to the trail.</p>

  <p>As Jan looked down upon them from his concealment of his lofty perch,
  Kupta turned and spoke rapidly in Urdu. Though he could not understand the
  words, Jan knew from his gestures that he was telling the babu they would
  soon be upon their quarry.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt in Jan's mind now that the fat Chandra Kumar was bent
  on killing him.</p>

  <p>So he nocked an arrow, drew it back to his ear, took careful aim at the
  fat figure of the babu and released it. The twang of his bow was followed by
  a choking cry from Chandra Kumar as the arrow pierced his fat neck. He
  clutched at it for a moment, then swayed and would have fallen had it not
  been for the <i>mahout</i>, who turned when he heard his cry, and caught him
  just in time to prevent his fall. At the first twang of the bow, Kupta
  scuttled behind the elephant.</p>

  <p>Jan fitted a second arrow to the bow string, and this time took aim at the
  rifleman who sat on the second elephant. Again the heavy bow twanged and the
  arrow buried itself to the feathers in the man's breast. He pitched from his
  seat without a sound. There were cries of alarm from the others, and the
  entire party turned to flee. But before they could get out of bow shot, Jan
  managed to bring down the last rifleman.</p>

  <p>Jan watched them go, a grim smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>So frightened were they at the deadly accuracy of their unseen enemy that
  they did not pause to recover the bodies of their comrades or the guns.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were out of sight, Jan descended and examined the two men
  he had shot. Both were dead. He stripped off their bandoleers, took their
  rifles and left them where they had fallen.</p>

  <p>Returning to the river bank where Sharma waited, he said, "The enemy has
  retreated. I don't think they will return to bother us again
  to-day.""</p><br>

  <p class="first">INSTEAD of sleeping at that spot as they had planned, Jan
  and Sharma walked into the shallows and waded down to the river to where the
  two elephants were enjoying their bath. Then they mounted and rode off into
  the jungle, continuing until nightfall, when they found a tall tree which
  provided them with a safe dormitory.</p>

  <p>In the morning Sharma aroused Jan at the first peep of day and proudly
  exhibited two mouse deer which he had slain with his arrows.</p>

  <p>"Some day," he said, "I shall be a mighty hunter like you."</p>

  <p>"You are already a skilful hunter," said Jan, "as these little animals are
  every elusive. Since I have come into this jungle I have not been able to
  kill one of them. How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"I arose very early while the stars still blossomed in the garden of the
  sky," replied Sharma, "and built a small blind. Then I used a device to
  attract the deer which my father once showed me. They call to each other by
  beating on the leaves with their feet.</p>

  <p>"I closely imitated the sound by beating upon a leaf with two sticks.
  Presently a deer came and I missed him because of the poor light, but when
  the second and third came I shot them."</p>

  <p>The two descended from the tree, and after a breakfast of broiled venison
  set out on the trail of the two elephants which had wandered away during the
  night. They found them feeding in the jungle about a mile away, and mounting,
  rode off.</p>

  <p>Jan wished to put as much distance as possible between them and the scene
  of the previous day's encounter, as he thought it quite probable that the men
  who sought to kill him would be likely to return with reinforcements and
  again take up the trail.</p>

  <p>They rode on through the jungle until the late afternoon, when Jan, who
  was swiftly learning how to manage Malikshah, suddenly brought the beast to a
  halt and sniffed the air with quivering nostrils.</p>

  <p>Sharma also stopped Rangini and asked, "What is wrong? Has the enemy come
  up with us again?"</p>

  <p>"No," Jan replied. "This is a new scent, though one very familiar and very
  dear to me. Ramona is somewhere nearby." Slowly he guided the great beast
  forward until they came to a high wall of black stone.</p>

  <p>By springing up from the back of the elephant, Jan was able to catch the
  edge of the wall and draw himself up. He saw an immense garden, in the center
  of which stood an ornate building of black stone, decorated with hideous
  carved statues in hideous postures.</p>

  <p>Yellow-robed shaven-headed priests wandered about in the garden, and here
  and there groups of women and girls laughed and chatted.</p>

  <p>He looked about for Ramona, his heart hungry for a sight of her. Up until
  the time the babu had taken a shot at him he had suspected her of attempting
  to kill him that night on the yacht.</p>

  <p>Now he was extremely doubtful, though he could not be sure that the babu
  was not in her pay. The latter had been lent to his father by the maharaja
  for the purpose of serving them and showing the party about Calcutta, and of
  course the jungle man knew nothing about the fate of the yachting party
  following the attempt upon his own life and his miraculous escape into the
  jungle.</p>

  <p>For some time he crouched there on the wall, straining his eyes for a
  sight of the girl he loved, but in vain. He knew she was here,
  somewhere&mdash;knew that scent too well to be mistaken.</p>

  <p>Crouching low in order that he might not be observed, he crept across the
  tiled roof in the direction from which the scent came. He was near the edge
  of the sloping roof when a loose tile slipped out from beneath him. Wildly he
  clutched at another, but this one also came off in his hand and he slid over
  the edge of the roof. It was a twenty-foot drop, but Jan had fallen head
  foremost, and despite his agility, was unable to turn himself in the air in
  time to prevent injury.</p>

  <p>He struck on his left shoulder. His head collided with the flagstone
  paving, and oblivion claimed him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE BABU'S STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">BY urging his elephant, which was the swiftest beast in his
  herd, the maharaja hoped to catch up with his guests before they reached
  Varudapur. But he had not covered more than half the distance when he
  overtook the three elephants he had sent out to hunt Jan, traveling in the
  same direction.</p>

  <p>He noticed with some surprise that his two riflemen were missing and that
  the babu, who rode on the foremost elephant, was solicitously supported by
  Kupta, a blood-soaked cloth wrapped around his thick neck.</p>

  <p>"Now what, fat swine," he said, glaring at the babu as he came up to him.
  "Have you fallen off your elephant? And where are your other two men?"</p>

  <p>"This babu is very sickly man, highness," said Chandra Kumar. "Most
  dangerously wounded. Had encounter with redhead jungle <i>sahib</i>. Both
  slain with stone-tipped arrows like that which came near ending this
  reincarnation for humbly servant."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that this man with a primitive bow and arrow defeated
  three of you who carried rifles?" said the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Once I shot him down from tree top," said the babu, "and we would have
  finished him then and there, but an unfriendly bull elephant charged,
  scattering men and hurling humbly servant into shrubbery."</p>

  <p>"As soon as you return to Varudapur," said the maharaja, "you will get in
  touch with my guardsmen, and while I do not wish to make the offer official,
  you may tell them that a reward of five thousand rupees will be paid for the
  head of this savage jungle man. The head must be brought secretly to you and
  you will be empowered to pay the reward.</p>

  <p>"When you catch up with the others you will say that you saw the young
  <i>sahib</i> and attempted to signal him, but that he evidently took you for
  an enemy, wounded you and killed two of your men, and so you were forced to
  retreat. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"Understanding is perfectly, highness," the babu replied.</p>

  <p>They overtook the rest of the party at the city gates of Varudapur. The
  maharaja then resumed his seat on the howdah with his two male guests and
  they continued to the palace&mdash;an imposing structure of marble and
  carnelian, age weathered and representing the Hindu architecture of five
  centuries before.</p>

  <p>The Trevors' party was given luxurious suites, and the maharaja excused
  himself because of much state business which had accumulated during his
  absence.</p>

  <p>As soon as this was attended to he went straight to Mr. Whitaker, the
  British Resident of Varuda. Whitaker was a wizened, bespectacled, sun-dried
  specimen of humanity who had spent the greater part of his sixty years in
  India.</p>

  <p>"I trust that you have enjoyed your vacation, <i>maharaja sahib</i>," said
  the British Resident, waving his caller to a seat.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, <i>sahib</i>, it has been marred by a most unpleasant
  incident," the maharaja replied, "two of them in fact."</p>

  <p>"Not really," drawled Whitaker. "Sorry to hear it. Anything I can do about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"There is much you can do about it," said the maharaja, "and it should be
  done soon. But I will begin at the beginning: I met a party of interesting
  Americans in Singapore and we became very friendly. They were on their way to
  Calcutta, so I lent them Babu Chandra Kumar to act as their guide and
  interpreter because of his familiarity with Calcutta and environs.</p>

  <p>"Then I returned here and left to do some deep sea fishing, using the
  permit you so kindly obtained for me so that I might legally cross and hunt
  in British territory.</p>

  <p>"Some days later I sighted the yacht of my American friends, apparently in
  distress, and on investigation found that the son of the owner had leaped or
  fallen overboard. Next day we saw his tracks leading into the jungle, so knew
  that he had reached the shore alive, and set out to find him.</p>

  <p>"He is a most extraordinary youth, and I understand lived the life of a
  savage in the South American jungle up to a few months ago. We found that he
  had frightened a number of villagers, and later he slew two of my men who
  were searching for him, apparently taking them for enemies, and wounded the
  babu himself."</p>

  <p>"Quite a dangerous fellow, I take it," said Whitaker. "It seems that he
  must be treated as a wild man. Perhaps he can be captured with nets or
  something of the sort, what?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it would be safest to have his parents and friends head the
  search parties for him," the maharaja replied. "Surely, he won't try to kill
  them? But I have not told you the worst part of my story."</p>

  <p>"Eh! How is that?"</p>

  <p>"When we were encamped for the night in British territory I left the camp
  with my two male guests to have a try at bagging some sambar. While we were
  gone the camp was raided by Rajputs, and the Suarez girl was kidnaped. We
  trailed her abductors straight to Rissapur.</p>

  <p>"On the way we met Abdur Rahman, but the Muslin maharaja disclaimed all
  knowledge of the affair and pretended to make inquiries. Of course, the
  inquiries came to nothing. So we left him, warning him that if the girl were
  not returned there would be serious consequences."</p>

  <p>"This is indeed a most grave matter," said Mr. Whitaker. "I shall
  communicate with my superiors at once."</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," said the maharaja, toying with his monocle, "this Rajput
  who has forsaken the religion of his forefathers is a most dangerous person
  and a menace to the peace and security of India. He should be removed."</p>

  <p>"He shall be," Mr. Whitaker promised, "if investigation proves that he is
  back of this dastardly plot."</p>

  <p>The maharaja screwed his monocle in place.</p>

  <p>"I must return to my guests now," he said, "so we can organize search
  parties for both of these young Americans who have disappeared. There is
  little hope of finding the girl, however, unless we search the seraglio of
  Abdur Rahman, which will of course mean war."</p>

  <p>"I think he will submit to the British Raj without a war," said Mr.
  Whitaker, rising. "To do otherwise would be plain suicide. I will get busy on
  this matter at once and you will hear from me shortly."</p>

  <p>On his return to the palace the maharaja found his guests driven almost to
  distraction by worry and inactivity.</p>

  <p>"Have you learned anything?" Georgia Trevor asked him as he entered.</p>

  <p>"Nothing as yet, I am sorry to report," he said, "but I have not been
  idle. I have just reported the entire affair to Mr. Whitaker, the local
  British Resident, and he has promised me the aid and support of his
  government. I am sure this Rajput upstart will be compelled to release Miss
  Suarez in the next day or two. In the meantime we can organize searching
  parties for the boy, but before we do this, I wish to call in the babu who
  has some information for you."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, and a servant appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Send in Babu Chandra Kumar.""</p><br>

  <p class="first">A FEW moments later the portly babu waddled into the room.
  His fat neck was swathed in clean white bandages and his face had an unwonted
  pallor.</p>

  <p>"You will tell the <i>sahibs</i> of your experience this morning," said
  the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Was heading search party for youngly <i>sahib</i>," said the babu,
  "looking in the vicinity of village where he was last seen. Then saw him
  perched on limb of tree. Shouted to him to come down with friendly gestures,
  but he shot stone-tipped arrow which pierced my neck. This babu fainted away
  from pain and loss of blood, but when conscious once more, found that two of
  men had been slain by young <i>sahib</i>, and he had disappeared."</p>

  <p>Trevor, who had been pacing the floor nervously, stopped and faced the
  babu.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that my boy made an unprovoked attack on you and
  your men, wounding you and killing two of them?"</p>

  <p>"Very sorry to have to make such report," the babu answered, "but have
  very painful evidence here on neck."</p>

  <p>"Do you think the terrors and privations through which he has passed have
  driven him mad?" asked Georgia Trevor, looking up at her tall, sun-bronzed
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," Trevor replied. "There is something fishy about
  this. Some of these men must have appeared hostile or Jan would not have
  attacked them."</p>

  <p>The babu shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Were very friendly," he said, "but perhaps youngly <i>sahib</i> did not
  recognize us and took us for enemies."</p>

  <p>Trevor glanced at the portly figure of the babu. "If he failed to
  recognize you," he said, "he needs to have his eyes tested. But what are we
  to do now? That is the point."</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that," the maharaja said. "I intend to organize three
  large search parties, and suggest that you, Trevor Sahib, head one, Suarez
  Sahib head another and I head the third. The babu is too badly wounded for
  the rigors of jungle travel and judging from his first experience his second
  encounter with the young <i>sahib</i> might prove fatal. However, I am sure
  that unless, as Mrs. Trevor has suggested, he has been driven mad, he will
  not be hostile toward any of us.</p>

  <p>"Does this plan meet with your approval?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He turned to Don Francesco.</p>

  <p>"And you, <i>sahib</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is a splendid idea," the Don replied.</p>

  <p>"Then I will see that preparations are made, and we will start in the
  morning, allotting different territory to each search party," the maharaja
  replied. "Now let us go in to tiffin."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; LITTLE EARTHQUAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Jan came to his senses after his fall to the flagstones
  in the temple enclosure he thought at first that he was dreaming. For it
  seemed to him that the sights and sensations which greeted his returning
  consciousness could not be real.</p>

  <p>He was lying stretched out on a cushioned divan, and his head was pillowed
  on the silk-clad thigh of a slender brown-skinned dancing girl, who bent over
  him, bathing the aching bump on his head with cold water. He attempted to sit
  up, but she restrained him and spoke softly in a language which he did not
  understand.</p>

  <p>He replied in English: "Who are you? Where am I?"</p>

  <p>She answered in the same language but with a strange accent that was not
  unpleasing.</p>

  <p>"Lie still, <i>tuan</i>! You had a bad fall beside by doorstep, and my
  attendants helped me to bring you here. Fortunately, the priests and guards
  did not see you."</p>

  <p>"But who are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am Jamila, who dances in the temple of Kali, but I am better known as
  Gempa Ketchil, which means 'Little Earthquake' in my native Malay
  language."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not a Hindu?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am Malayan. The dancing girls here are selected not because of race
  but because of ability. There are three Kashmiri girls, several from Tibet,
  one from Egypt and two from Japan, as well as the native girls. But all have
  been taught the temple dances and ceremonies of Kali."</p>

  <p>Despite her protestations, Jan sat up and looked around the gaudily
  furnished room. There were taborets containing mirrors, cosmetic boxes,
  trinkets and other odds and ends. Upon one a small pot of incense smoldered,
  filling the room with the mingled scent of musk, sandalwood, ambergris, and
  jasmin.</p>

  <p>"And now that I have told you who I am," said the girl, "perhaps you will
  tell me your name."</p>

  <p>"I am Jan Trevor," he replied, but I am better known as Jan of the
  Jungle."</p>

  <p>"You are English?"</p>

  <p>"No, American."</p>

  <p>"You are the first American I have seen," the girl told him. "I did not
  know that the dress of the Americans was so different from that of the
  English,"</p>

  <p>"It isn't," Jan replied. "I don't dress like other Americans since the
  jungle is my home. I am very thirsty. Can you tell me where I can get a drink
  of water?"</p>

  <p>"I have been most thoughtless," the girl replied. "You shall have both
  food and drink immediately." She clapped her hands and a slave girl
  entered.</p>

  <p>"Bring food and tea for my lord," she said.</p>

  <p>The girl withdrew, and presently returned with a tray containing several
  vessels, from which emanated the savory odors of curry, steamed rice and
  Darjeeling tea.</p>

  <p>Jan ate until his hunger was satisfied.</p>

  <p>Then the girl said, "You have not told me how you happen to be here. Did
  you drop from the sky?"</p>

  <p>"No, from the roof," he answered. "I was looking for a girl."</p>

  <p>"You have come to the right place, my lord," she replied, "but it is very
  dangerous. If the priests or guards find you, you will be fed to the Black
  One."</p>

  <p>She moved over and snuggled against him.</p>

  <p>"You were very brave to come here, <i>tuan</i>," she said. She took his
  hand and drew it around her slender waist. "And I love you for it," she
  concluded.</p>

  <p>Jan withdrew his hand. "But I came here in search of a girl I know," he
  told her.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with me, my lord?" she asked. "Is this other more
  beautiful than I?"</p>

  <p>She stood up and piroutted before him, displaying the seductive lines of
  her lissom figure.</p>

  <p>"Surely you could look further and fare worse, as the English say. I will
  dance for you, and you will never wish to leave me."</p>

  <p>She went to the doorway and called another girl, who came in carrying a
  small drum. The girl seated herself and began a throbbing cadence on the
  instrument, while she softly hummed a plaintive melody In a minor
  key.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JAMILA instantly began her dance, the like of which Jan had
  never seen before. A dance which spoke of love and longing and desire in a
  language which any one might understand.</p>

  <p>Before the dance had reached its conclusion, Jan understood why the girl
  was called "Little Earthquake."</p>

  <p>Her dance over, she flung herself at his feet, panting and exhausted,
  looking up at him with amorous eyes.</p>

  <p>"Take me in your arms, jungle man. Love me. Jamila is yours," she said.
  But Jan pushed her away.</p>

  <p>"I have tried to make it clear to you," he said, "that I came here for
  another girl&mdash;the one girl I love."</p>

  <p>Jamila sprang to her feet, eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"So Jamila is not good enough for you," she shrilled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she snatched a knife from a nearby taboret and sprang at him like
  a tigress. As the knife descended towards his breast, Jan caught her wrist
  and wrenched the weapon from her, then held her as she attempted to bite,
  kick and scratch him.</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" she screamed. "You fool! You brute! I will call the priests
  and the guards. You shall pay for this insult to Jamila."</p>

  <p>Thakoor, who was passing the dancing girls' quarters at the moment heard
  her infuriated screams. He ran into the building, peered through the curtains
  and then shouted for the guard.</p>

  <p>Jan saw him, sensed the enmity in his look, and releasing the dancer,
  looked about for some avenue of escape. The door in which the old priest
  stood was the only means of egress, so he bowled Thakoor over and plunged out
  into the temple enclosure, then looked for a way out.</p>

  <p>The guards, armed with rifles, were running toward him from all
  directions. At sight of him they brought their weapons to their shoulders,
  shouting to him in a language which he did not understand. But he realized
  that they were calling upon him to halt and that to attempt flight would be
  suicidal.</p>

  <p>Old Thakoor, who had not been badly injured, appeared in the doorway and
  shouted a command to the guards, two of whom sprang forward and seized Jan's
  arms. The jungle man flung them off, and instantly there was a scrimmage,
  with Jan as its focal point, and a half dozen guards beating, gouging,
  kicking and pulling at him. One after another Jan flung them from him, but
  each time be rid himself of one of the tenacious guards, it seemed that two
  more took his place. Presently exhausted by his herculean efforts, he was
  borne to the flagstones and bound hand and foot.</p>

  <p>When they had him helpless the aged priest issued a sharp command. Four
  men lifted the jungle man and bore him across the garden into a side door of
  the black temple and down a winding stairway which seemed to lead into the
  very bowels of the earth. Here he was flung into a tiny cell, dimly lighted
  by a faint yellow radiance which filtered through a tiny aperture from
  overhead.</p>

  <p>As he lay on the floor panting from his exertions, bound and helpless, old
  Thakoor said:</p>

  <p>"So! You would pollute this sacred ground with your presence and profane a
  dancing girl with your touch. For this you shall be sacrificed to the Black
  Mother."</p>

  <p>Then he turned and left the cell, the barred door clanging behind him.</p>

  <p>Jan was left alone in the darkness. For some time he struggled
  ineffectually with his bonds. Presently exhausted, he fell asleep. When he
  awoke his ears told him that he was not alone, as something slithered across
  the floor in his direction. He caught the acrid scent of a serpent, and
  drawing himself to a sitting posture, saw an enormous hooded reptile, with
  head up-reared, coming toward him. It was an immense king cobra, the most
  fearsome and deadly of all serpents.</p>

  <p>Again Jan made a superhuman effort to burst his bonds, but the tough
  fibers held, and he knew that nothing short of a miracle could save him from
  death.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE HARVEST OF GOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">PROMPTLY at sunrise, the morning after their arrival in
  Varudapur, Trevor and Don Francesco in cork helmets, khaki and shorts, met
  the maharaja in the courtyard of his palace. The latter was a picture of
  sartorial splendor with his immaculate turban, eyeglass, and white tropicals,
  and was smoking his inevitable cigarette.</p>

  <p>"The gods have favored us with a beautiful morning, gentlemen," he said.
  "I trust that they will smile on us as we make our search to-day."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope so," Trevor replied, fishing out his pipe and tobacco. "They
  have frowned continually, lately. Shall we be off?"</p>

  <p>"Always restless, always impatient, you Americans," said the maharaja.
  "But in this case, you have a most excellent reason. Yes, let's be off. I
  have divided my eighteen available elephants among the three of us. So we
  will each have six, as well as a party of spearmen on foot. You, Trevor
  Sahib, will search the territory which lies toward the northwest. Suarez
  Sahib will search toward the southwest, and I will search toward the
  northeast. The best plan will be for each party to spread out in as wide a
  line as possible, the leader's elephant at the center of the line, and the
  others spaced at regular intervals on either side, with spearmen in between.
  By following this plan, we should be able to comb Varuda from one end to the
  other in a couple of weeks, or less."</p>

  <p>"An excellent plan," said Trevor. "Which is my elephant?"</p>

  <p>The maharaja raised his hand, and one of three elephants equipped with
  ornate howdahs and standing at the other end of the courtyard, came forward.
  The beast raised its trunk in salute, and the attendant lowered the
  ladder.</p>

  <p>Trevor mounted, and the maharaja called up to him.</p>

  <p>"Your party awaits you at the northwest gate," he said.</p>

  <p>Suarez mounted the second elephant, and the maharaja the third. Georgia
  Trevor and Doña Isabella, who had been watching from the balcony, waved
  farewells and wished them success, as they rode away.</p>

  <p>The maharaja had been very careful to see that neither of his guests
  should ride in the direction of the Black Pagoda. Also, the territory which
  he had assigned to himself was that which not only included the blasphemous
  Temple of Kali, but the one in which he thought it most likely that he might
  find Jan. The men who rode on his elephants were secretly armed with rifles,
  and he carried several himself, ostensibly for big game. But their real
  purpose was to make sure that the jungle man should not again escape.</p>

  <p>As soon as his forces had spread out in a skirmish line, the hidden rifles
  were brought out. They hunted until mid afternoon without a trace of the man
  they sought. Then the maharaja called a halt for rest and refreshment, at his
  pleasant summer place in the hills, midway between Varudapur and the Black
  Pagoda.</p>

  <p>They had taken but a brief rest, when a temple guard arrived. The maharaja
  was strolling about the camp, smoking a cigarette, while his men loiled in
  the shade. Among these men was Kupta, the hillman. The latter pricked up his
  ears as the temple guard approached the maharaja and waited leave to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" snapped the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Thakoor sends great news, highness," the guard replied. "The young
  <i>sahib</i> of the flaming hair has been captured."</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?" asked the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Confined in a cell beneath the House of the Black Mother," the man
  replied. "He cannot escape."</p>

  <p>"He shall not escape," the maharaja rasped. "I'll see to that, personally.
  We leave for the temple at once."</p>

  <p>He turned to Kupta.</p>

  <p>"You are a good runner, hillman," he said. "Go, back to my palace and tell
  the <i>memsahibs</i> I go to the Black Pagoda to beseech the Mahadevi, the
  great goddess, for the safety of the young <i>sahib</i> and <i>memsahib</i>.
  Your ears have heard nothing else&mdash;your eyes have seen nothing else. If
  they betray me, you will part with them at our next meeting. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, highness," repied Kupta.</p>

  <p>"Then be off!"</p>

  <p>Kupta caught up his spear and sprinted away.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BABU CHANDRA KUMAR, whose activities had been curtailed by
  his wound, was reclining at his ease in his quarters, chewing his quid of
  betel and discoloring the rim of his brass cuspidor, when Kupta slunk in as
  silently as a shadow and squatted on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Back from the hunt so soon?" the babu asked.</p>

  <p>"I bore a message from his highness to the <i>memsahibs</i>," the hiliman
  answered.</p>

  <p>"What was the message?"</p>

  <p>Kupta repeated it.</p>

  <p>"Hum," reflected the babu. "So he has gone to the Black Temple. Did a
  messenger come from the temple first?"</p>

  <p>"That I am not permitted to say," the hillman replied.</p>

  <p>"So! There was a message from Thakoor!" He adopted a wheedling tone.
  "Come, my friend. We have no secrets from each other. You and I are
  comrades&mdash;bosom friends. What was the message?"</p>

  <p>"I am not permitted to tell either what I have heard or seen," was Kupta's
  dogged reply.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are other ways," smiled Chandra Kumar, blandly. "Come
  here."</p>

  <p>Kupta advanced and helped himself to a quid of betel which the babu
  proffered. Then he seated himself beside the brass cuspidor.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be punished for anything I think, can you?" asked Chandra
  Kumar.</p>

  <p>"That is true," replied Kupta, mumbling contentedly.</p>

  <p>"Now assuming that you are me, and you know there has been a message, what
  would you guess that it contained?" asked the babu.</p>

  <p>"News of great importance," replied the hillman. "Any fool would know
  that."</p>

  <p>"Right," agreed Chandra Kumar. "And the news of the greatest importance to
  his highness at the moment would be the killing or capture of the young
  red-headed <i>sahib</i>, let us say, by temple guards. If you were me, which
  would you assume were the case?"</p>

  <p>"I may not answer," said Kupta, doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, we'll put it in still another way, in which there will be no
  harm in answering," wheedled the babu. "Which would you assume was not the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"That he had been killed," replied the simple Kupta.</p>

  <p>"Ah! So the maharaja is hurrying to the temple to see that he will be
  killed!"</p>

  <p>For some time the babu considered the situation, and what possible profit
  there might be in it for himself. He had been absent from his home in Howrah
  for several months and was very anxious to return. Furthermore, he was not
  deceived by the maharaja's promise that he might make him his deewan, as he
  knew the potentate held him in considerable contempt.</p>

  <p>While this bothered him not at all, for he was accustomed to being held in
  contempt by pompous princes and nabobs, it obliterated any slight sense of
  loyalty which he might have toward his employer. So he decided it was high
  time for him to collect whatever money might still be obtained from this
  venture and leave for Howrah. Accordingly, in the late afternoon he rode
  forth on his donkey, accompanied by the faithful Kupta, in the direction from
  which he expected Harry Trevor to return. Knowing the man to be a
  millionaire, he felt sure he would pay a huge sum for the information which
  the babu had to offer.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw the string of elephants coming along the road, and hailed
  Trevor as he came up.</p>

  <p>"<i>Salaam, sahib</i>!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Salaam</i>, Chandra Kumar," Trevor replied. "What brings you here in
  such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>"Have very importantly news for Trevor Sahib alone," Chandra Kumar
  answered. "Will <i>sahib</i> condescend to dismount and speak with this less
  than insignificant person in private?"</p><br>

  <p class="first">TREVOR signaled his <i>mahout</i>. The ladder was lowered
  from the howdah and the American descended. The babu led him off to a side of
  the road.</p>

  <p>"Humbly servant is very poor man, <i>sahib</i>, with extremely large and
  hungry family in Howrah," said the babu. "Would Trevor Sahib be willing to
  pay this very inferior person for information as to whereabouts of the
  <i>memsahib</i>, as well as his son?"</p>

  <p>Trevor looked at him suspiciously. "Do you mean to tell me that you know
  where both of them are?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Know for positively honest-to-golly where both can be found," the babu
  answered, "and for lakh of rupees will divulge information. Cannot do so for
  less as tremendous personal risk is involved. This babu takes life in hands
  to even whisper of such matters at all."</p>

  <p>"From whom would you be in danger?" Trevor asked. "The Rajputs?"</p>

  <p>"No, <i>sahib</i>, that I will not say or any more until the money is
  produced."</p>

  <p>"Why, I haven't so much money with me," Trevor told him, "but I can give
  you a check."</p>

  <p>"Check will do," the babu answered. "Make it out and will divulge
  information. If not correct and as humbly servant has said, <i>sahib</i> can
  have this babu arrested for swindling"</p>

  <p>Trevor hesitated for a moment. He did not trust this wily Bengali and yet
  after all, what was a lakh of rupees or a thousand for that matter, compared
  to the safety of his son and Ramona Suarez? He got out his check book and
  fountain pen.</p>

  <p>"Make out check to cash, please," said Chandra Kumar, but at this Trevor
  demurred. "The check must be made out to you and endorsed by you," he
  specified, "since I will have no other receipt or guarantee of your
  integrity."</p>

  <p>"Very well, <i>sahib</i>. To me, then," he answered.</p>

  <p>Trevor wrote the check for a hundred thousand rupees and held it until the
  ink dried while the babu looked on.</p>

  <p>"Well, he said, "the information."</p>

  <p>"Mem<i>sahib</i> was abducted by order of the maharaja himself," the babu
  said, "and was taken to the temple of Kali, hidden in the jungles to the
  northwest of Varudapur.</p>

  <p>"A man named Thakoor is the nominal high priest of the temple, but the
  real high priest is the maharaja himself, and it is said that he makes many
  bloody sacrifices there each year. Am not worshipper of Black One and never
  attended ceremonies, so that part is only hearsay to me. However, believe
  that the maharaja intends marrying the <i>memsahib</i>, and know positively
  that he will order the young <i>sahib</i> sacrificed to Kali.</p>

  <p>"If you would save them, go to Mr. Whitaker, the British Resident,
  organize rescue party and start at once."</p><br>

  <p class="first">TREVOR was dumbfounded, and yet the more he thought of the
  various phases of the case, the more he was convinced the babu was telling
  the truth. It was clear to him now that the maharaja had lured the two white
  men away from the camp in order that it might be left unguarded for the raid.
  It explained also the fact that the guns left for the women had been loaded
  with blank cartridges, and that the supposed Rajputs were not Rajputs at all,
  but others in disguise.</p>

  <p>He also had heard the rumor of the impending amalgamation of Varuda and
  Rissapur and knew that one of the two monarchs would have to be deposed, so
  it did not take him long to determine the motives back of all the maharaja's
  actions.</p>

  <p>He suddenly extended the check to the babu, and turning, hurried to his
  elephant.</p>

  <p>"Back to Varudapur quickly!" he told the <i>mahout</i> as the ladder was
  drawn up. "This is a mission of life and death!"</p>

  <p>He stopped at the residence of Mr. Whitaker, and fortunately found him in;
  the latter having just completed his afternoon siesta.</p>

  <p>Swiftly he explained the situation to the Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Really, this is most extraordinary," said Mr. Whitaker, "most
  extraordinary, indeed. In fact I am inclined to doubt the whole story.
  However, since the safety of your son and the daughter of Don Francesco is
  involved, I will do my best to make an investigation.</p>

  <p>"I have a guard of twenty Sepoys who will be ready to leave in half an
  hour. We'd better use horses in order to save time. I will lend you one of
  mine, and will also have a mount for Don Francesco if he returns in
  time."</p>

  <p>As soon as the babu received the check from Harry Trevor, he rode for
  Varudapur as fast as the donkey could carry him and made for the stall of one
  Ishaak el Yahudi, a Hebrew money changer of his acquaintance, who did quite a
  flourishing business in Varudapur.</p>

  <p>After a violent argument with the Jew, which lasted nearly an hour, the
  babu succeeded in cashing his check for what he insisted was a ruinous
  discount of ten per cent. This transaction concluded, he rode to his own
  quarters, packed his suitcase, and remounting his donkey, made straight for
  Rissapur.</p>

  <p>He reached the capital of Abdur Rahman's little kingdom in the evening,
  and immediately sought audience with the maharaja.</p>

  <p>The latter, who was entertaining guests, at first said that he would not
  receive him until to-morrow, but the Bengali sent back word that his news was
  very urgent, had to do with the <i>memsahib</i> who had presumably been
  kidnaped by Rajputs, and could not wait.</p>

  <p>Upon learning this, Abdur Rahman said, "Conduct the babu to the reception
  room. I will see him there."</p>

  <p>The Rajput maharaja made excuses to his guests and said he would be gone
  but a few minutes, then entered the reception room, where he found the babu
  waiting.</p>

  <p>The latter was hot, tired and dusty from his long, grueling trip, and
  quite pale from the illness induced by his wound.</p>

  <p>He waited for the ruler to address him, as was customary.</p>

  <p>"Salaam, <i>babuji</i>," said the maharaja. "If you have an important
  communication get it over with quickly, as I have left my guests in order to
  receive you."</p>

  <p>"This babu stands before your highness, a wounded, ill and impoverished
  man," said Chandra Kumar, "all because of working for the Maharaja of
  Varudapur in a clerkly capacity, but not remaining in his employ because of
  his nefarious plots."</p>

  <p>"Eh! What's that? Plots did you say?" asked the maharaja, pricking up his
  ears.</p>

  <p>"Humbly servant will be glad to reveal all to your highness for a small
  sum of money to defray the expenses of return to Howrah, where large and
  hungry family awaits him," he said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, a small sum of money?"</p>

  <p>The babu considered for a moment. He knew that Abdur Rahman was not
  especially wealthy, as maharajas go, and was afraid he would defeat his
  purpose by asking too large a sum, as he could not expect to get as
  tremendous an amount of money as the fabulously wealthy American had paid
  him.</p>

  <p>"For ten thousand rupees will reveal all, highness," he said.</p>

  <p>"he sum is ridiculous," Abdur Rahman replied, "nd how do I know that your
  information will not be worthless?"</p>

  <p>"It is information that will preserve your highness' kingdom for you," the
  babu answered.</p>

  <p>"Why, then, if you are the custodian of such information I can call the
  guard," said the Rajput ruler. "There are other ways of obtaining information
  from you besides paying you for it."</p>

  <p>The babu cringed. "Nay, do not call the guard. Am very sick man and must
  get on train for Howrah at once in order that may have nursing of
  family."</p>

  <p>"I will give you five thousand rupees," the maharaja said, "provided your
  information is what you claim it to be. You have my word of honor on that, so
  speak now and do not detain me longer."</p>

  <p>"The raid on the camp of the maharaja of Varuda was planned by himself,"
  the babu said, "and the raiders were not Rajputs but Pathans in the pay of
  his highness, disguised as Rajputs."</p>

  <p>"Ha! I suspected as much," said the maharaja. "Who was the leader of these
  villainous Pathans?"</p>

  <p>"None other than the notorious Zafarulla Khan," the babu replied.</p>

  <p>"And what was done with the girl?" the Rajput wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"She was taken to the Black Temple of Kali."</p>

  <p>"What of the red-headed jungle boy?"</p>

  <p>"He followed her there and was taken prisoner. He is to be sacrificed to
  Kali, and the young <i>memsahib</i> forced into marriage with his
  highness."</p>

  <p>Abdur Rahman clapped his fist upon his palm.</p>

  <p>"Wallahi! I see it all now," he said, "nd I am convinced that you speak
  the truth."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands and a servant appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Tell my treasurer to fetch five thousand rupees at once," he said. "Order
  my hore saddled and tell my guardsmen to divide into two parties, one of
  which I will lead myself. The other party, under the lead of Mahmood, will
  immediately start out in search of that Pathan villain, Zafarulla Khan."</p>

  <p>The babu waited only long enough to receive his money from Abdur Rahman's
  treasurer. Then he hurriedly took his departure for the railway station,
  which was a mile and a half from the city of Rissapur.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; FED TO THE TIGRESS</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN he saw the cobra coming toward him in his dark cell,
  its hooded head swaying and its tongue darting menacingly, Jan strained at
  his bonds until he was bathed in perspiration, exerting all the strength of
  his powerful young muscles.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1302971h-images/JanInIndia-06.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Presently a strand snapped, then another and another, and his hands were
  free. By this time the serpent was almost upon him. There was no opportunity
  for him to unbind his ankles, but he rose to his feet and sprang back just as
  the serpent struck, avoiding death by a mere fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>There ensued a race around the tiny cell, which apparently could have only
  one outcome, Jan hopping backward with his ankles bound together, while the
  serpent followed, striking again and again at his unprotected legs.</p>

  <p>Presently Jan thought of a plan which might give him some respite.
  Suddenly crouching, he leaped for the narrow barred opening in the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>He caught hold of an iron bar and drew his legs up out of reach of the
  enraged snake. But the bar was old and rusty, and illy supported by the
  ancient mortar in which it was embedded. The strain was too much for it and
  one end tore out of the groove.</p>

  <p>At this Jan caught hold of another bar which seemed to be stronger. The
  first had come out in his hand. Now he was no longer defenseless, but armed
  with a weapon which would at least give him equal chances with the serpent.
  The cobra was coiled directly beneath him, its hooded head raised
  threateningly.</p>

  <p>Jan thrust the bar into his belt, and untied the bonds which prisoned his
  ankles. He swung his body back, then forward in a long leap which carried him
  into the far corner of the cell. Instantly he turned to face the cobra, which
  promptly started toward him.</p>

  <p>When the snake was nearly within striking distance, Jan lashed out with
  the bar. The reptile dodged the blow and struck back, but with cat-like
  quickness, the jungle man eluded it and brought down the bar on the reptile's
  head. It writhed on the floor for a time while he beat that venomous head
  into a mass of bloody pulp.</p>

  <p>Then as he flung the still squirming reptile into a corner, he heard the
  sound of approaching footsteps on the stairway outside. A guard bearing a
  torch in his hand had heard the commotion and was coming to investigate.</p>

  <p>Quickly Jan resumed his recumbent position on the floor, laid the rope
  over his ankles and held his hands behind him. The guard unlocked the barred
  door and entered the cell. He spoke rapidly in a language which Jan did not
  understand and the latter made no reply, so he came and bent over him to see
  if his bonds were in place.</p>

  <p>Instantly Jan tripped him, and before he could rise, brought the heavy bar
  down upon his turbaned skull. He went limp without a sound, and the jungle
  man knew that he was unconscious for some time, if not dead.</p>

  <p>Jan realized that it would be impossible for him to get across the temple
  enclosure without a disguise, and although this guardsman was slightly
  smaller, he believed he would be able to get into big uniform.</p>

  <p>It did not take him long to possess himself of the man's clothing, turban
  and weapons. He also helped himself to his jailer's keys, and took the
  precaution of locking him in the cell before leaving.</p>

  <p>Since the sole light which came to him was from the flickering cressets
  within the black temple, and since he had slept for an unknown time, he did
  not know whether it was day or night. So after he had mounted the stairway,
  he was relieved to find that the sun had set, and therefore felt confident
  that his disguise would be effective, as his face was sunburned to the
  brownness of a light colored Hindu.</p>

  <p>Imitating the self-important swagger of the temple guard, he walked
  through the garden toward a tall tree, the spreading branches of which
  overhung the roof of the low buildings constructed against the wall of the
  temple enclosure. If he could reach that tree undetected, he felt sure that
  he could make good his escape, after which he would find some way to return
  for Ramona.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BUT it was his misfortune to blunder directly into the path
  of the little wizened, lynx-eyed Thakoor. The priest, who knew every temple
  guard, instantly saw that this youth, whose long arms and legs and swelling
  chest were very poorly covered by the clothing he had purloined, was the
  prisoner intended for sacrifice to Kali.</p>

  <p>"Ho, the guards," he shouted, "the jungle man is escaping!"</p>

  <p>He leaped in front of Jan, who thrust him out of the way and ran for the
  tree which had been his objective.</p>

  <p>In the dim twilight his flying figure was not an easy mark to hit, and
  though rifles were popping and bullets whistling all around him, he managed
  to reach the tree unscathed.</p>

  <p>He scrambled up into its protecting branches, dropped to the tiled roof of
  the building and ran across it to the edge of the wall, from which he sprang
  into the jungle.</p>

  <p>When the maharaja of Varuda arrived at the Black Pagoda he was met at the
  gate by Thakoor.</p>

  <p>"Where have you confined this wild jungle man?" he asked Thakoor, the
  priest.</p>

  <p>"Alas, highness, he has escaped," Thakoor replied.</p>

  <p>"What! How did that happen?"</p>

  <p>"It appears that a cobra got into his cell and so frightened him that he
  broke his bonds. He is as strong as ten ordinary men, you know. Having broken
  his bonds, he wrenched out an iron bar, slew the cobra and brained a guard
  who went to investigate. He took the guard's clothing, and was crossing the
  enclosure when I saw and recognized him. I shouted, and the guards fired at
  him, but with no apparent effect, for he climbed a tree, went over the wall,
  and escaped into the jungle."</p>

  <p>"Fool! You had things in the hollow of your hand. Now you have bungled
  them. You should have slain him at once. Now we don't know what to expect.
  Well, there is only one thing to do. I must either marry this girl at once,
  or let her be devoured, so that no trace will remain of her when the
  <i>sahibs</i> come. For surely they will come, now. And if they find her here
  an unwilling guest, my kingdom is doomed, this temple is doomed, and you and
  I are dead men."</p>

  <p>"To feed her to the Black One at once would be the wisest plan, highness,"
  said Thakoor.</p>

  <p>"We will let her decide that point," said the maharaja, "but she will have
  to decide quickly. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"In the apartment your highness has set aside for her. She is being
  prepared for the ceremony&mdash;for either ceremony."</p>

  <p>"I'll go and have a talk with her."</p>

  <p>The maharaja found Ramona being prepared for the ceremony in which she was
  to be an unwilling participant. Slave girls anointed her with sweet smelling
  unguents, stained her fingers and toes with henna, and draped her with
  jewels.</p>

  <p>When she looked up to see the maharaja standing in the door, she noticed
  that he was no longer attired in semi-European costume and that he had
  dispensed with his monocle. Now he wore the ceremonial robes of a High Priest
  of Kali.</p>

  <p>The slave girls hung the last string of jewels in place and departed
  noiselessly. Then the maharaja spoke.</p>

  <p>"I have come for your decision," said he.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you what it would be," Ramona replied.</p>

  <p>"You must think this over carefully," he urged, "for it rests entirely
  with you whether you will live to be a wealthy and pampered maharanee, or
  whether that fair body will be torn to pieces and devoured by the Black
  One."</p>

  <p>Ramona rose and fixed him with a cold glance.</p>

  <p>"You may rest assured of one thing," she said, "and that is I will never
  marry you."</p>

  <p>At this the iron calm of the maharaja suddenly broke. To Ramona's
  astonishment he flung himself on his knees before her&mdash;abased
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Ramona," he said, "if you have no pity on yourself, then have pity on me.
  There are a thousand beautiful women I might have for the taking, but it is
  only you I want&mdash;only you I love. I have been married before, yes, many
  times. What man in my position has not? But until I looked into your eyes I
  never knew the meaning of true love. I never knew the tortures and
  heartaches, yearning and loneliness that separation from one's beloved
  brings. If I cannot have you, then life will not be worth the living."</p>

  <p>"And you would feed me to a tigress!"</p>

  <p>"I shall feed you to the Black One, yes. But ere another week is past I
  shall sacrifice my own body to the same Black Mother. Oh, Ramona! Have pity
  on me! Can you not find it in your heart to love me just a little?"</p>

  <p>"I can find pity, yes," she replied, "and a considerable measure of
  loathing. But no love. You speak of love, but do not know the meaning of the
  word. To you it is mere sensuality. To me, love is spiritual. It is
  unselfish. It seeks to protect its beloved rather than to destroy. You say
  you love me, yet because I do not willingly come to your arms, you threaten
  me with a horrible death. Do your worst, maharaja of thousands, but base
  slave of your own passions! I defy you!"</p>

  <p>Slowly he rose to his feet. It seemed that his face had aged ten years in
  as many minutes. His usually square shoulders had a despondent droop as he
  turned wordlessly, and departed beneath the brocaded curtain which the slave
  girl obsequiously held back for him.</p>

  <p>He crossed the temple enclosure without looking to the right or left,
  walked up the steps, and entered the central room where the blood-smeared
  multi-armed black monstrosity looked down at him. Seating himself
  cross-legged in an attitude of meditation, he remained there in long silent
  supplication to the Black Mother.</p>

  <p>All his life, the maharaja had been pampered. When he was a child his
  parents pampered him. And as soon as he was elevated to the throne, his
  subjects had pampered him. Very soon after his accession to the throne,
  numerous subjects with lovely young daughters had presented them to him for
  his zenana, hoping to curry favor with their young sovereign. Neighboring
  potentates had sent him beautiful dancing girls. Presently as he grew older,
  he had set himself up as a connoisseur of beautiful women. That was his
  sensual side. But he had also a religious side. By inheritance and tradition,
  he was a devotee of Kali, as his ancestors for untold generations had been
  before him. A remote progenitor had built the Black Pagoda, which to this day
  was maintained by a considerable sum set aside from the revenues of Varuda.
  His ancestors and many of their subjects had been Dacoits, Thugs, to whom the
  commission of all forms of crime, and especially murder, was a religious
  obligation. Thuggee had been abolished by the British, but the criminal caste
  remained, and practiced many orgies in secret of which the British Raj never
  dreamed.</p>

  <p>However, he had had an occidental as well as an oriental education. He was
  an Oxford graduate. And the facts and philosophies he had learned in England
  had also become a part of his being. He had learned the English ideas of love
  and chivalry&mdash;the Christian code of moral ethics&mdash;and it was the
  conflict between these two opposite codes which was now taking place in his
  soul.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE had spoken the truth when he told Ramona she was the
  first girl he had ever loved. Previous to his meeting with her, women and
  girls had been mere toys, to be played with and dismissed. But genuine love
  had come to him unbidden&mdash; really unwanted. And since he had had no
  legitimate way of appeasing it, he had taken the Dacoit's way&mdash;the way
  of his criminal caste&mdash;to force Ramona's capitulation. Had she been of
  the orient, this method might have proved successful, as it might have even
  with many occidental girls of a certain type.</p>

  <p>Now, with Jan at large, with almost certain exposure facing him, he
  realized the enormity of the crime he had committed, and the price he would
  undoubtedly be compelled to pay. Only Ramona's willing assent to marriage
  with him could save him. He had failed in securing that, and now there was
  but one alternative. She must disappear from the face of the earth, in order
  that no trace of his crime would remain. To accomplish this end, the means
  was at hand&mdash;the black tigress. And for him to employ any other means
  after going this far, would be to lose caste with his bloodthirsty followers
  and fellow worshippers.</p>

  <p>He went through a hell of torment as he sat there, contemplating the ugly,
  blood-smeared face of his black goddess, whose features seemed at times to
  actually move in the orange light from the flickering cressets, and whose red
  eyes stared down at him unpityingly through the drifting haze that rose from
  the smouldering incense.</p>

  <p>Presently he was aroused from his unpleasant meditations by shouts, and
  the sound of shooting. He rose and went to the door.</p>

  <p>"What has happened," he asked the nearest priest.</p>

  <p>"A band of Sepoys led by <i>sahibs</i> is attempting to force the gate,"
  replied the priest.</p>

  <p>The maharaja shouted for his captain.</p>

  <p>"Ho, Rajam," he called. "To me."</p>

  <p>The captain came running.</p>

  <p>"Who is at the gate?" asked the maharaja.</p>

  <p>"Whitaker Sahib with his Sepoys, and two other <i>sahibs</i>," replied
  Rajam. "Thakoor refused to let them in, and they began shooting. I ordered my
  men to return the fire, and they retreated into the jungle."</p>

  <p>"Keep them out at all costs," ordered the maharaja .</p>

  <p>As the captain hurried away to carry out his instructions, he entered the
  temple once more and signaled to a priest, who struck a tremendous gong a
  single resounding blow.</p>

  <p>"It is time for the sacrifice to begin," said the maharaja. "Form the
  procession and bring the white dove."</p>

  <p>Once more he resumed his seat and his attitude of meditation.</p>

  <p>Presently there appeared a long procession of priests, dancing girls and
  musicians. The latter, seating themselves at one side of the room, played a
  barbarous melody, and the dancing girls, led by "Little Earthquake," went
  through the temple dances of sacrifice to Kali.</p>

  <p>During this time Ramona was held by two priests before the door of the
  cage, which was still empty, but she heard snarls and thunderous growls
  issuing from the enclosure beyond, and knew that the black tigress was
  thirsting for her blood.</p>

  <p>At this moment there came the sound of a fusillade of shots from outside
  the temple. Thakoor slipped up beside the maharaja and whispered in his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"They have returned to the attack," he said. "Shall we go on with the
  ceremony?"</p>

  <p>"Our guardsmen can hold them off until the end," said the maharaja. "We
  will continue."</p>

  <p>The musicians struck up another plaintive minor air, and the priests
  joined their voices in a chant that pealed upward and reverberated from the
  temple dome.</p>

  <p>Louder and louder grew the chant, and louder and louder played the
  musicians, while thunderous blows on the huge temple gong added to the
  tumult.</p>

  <p>The maharaja took a last, lingering look at the lovely regal little figure
  before the cage. "What a maharanee she would have made for me!" he thought.
  But he did not speak. Instead, he raised his hand.</p>

  <p>At this signal, two dancing girls stripped the jewelry from Ramona. An
  attendant opened the door of the cage, and she was thrust inside.</p>

  <p>As the door clanged shut behind her the one in the rear of the cage swung
  open. Two glowing red eyes peered out</p>

  <p>"Farewell, beloved," groaned the maharaja.</p>

  <p>Then the black tigress sprang for her victim.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; A BATTLE OF GIANTS</h2>

  <p class="first">JAN'S first act, after he had made his escape from the Black
  Temple, was to rid himself of the cumbrous clothing of the guardsman, which
  impeded the free motion of his limbs.</p>

  <p>Since his own weapons had been taken from him, he retained the heavy, keen
  bladed sword which, he noted with satisfaction, had been honed to an almost
  razor-like sharpness by its owner. After he had belted the weapon to his
  waist, he began to look for his friend Sharma, the little brown boy, and the
  two elephants, feeling sure that they were not far off.</p>

  <p>Although the moon had not yet risen and it was too dark to see the trail,
  he soon found it by scent, and followed as swiftly and easily as if the huge
  pugs of the elephants had been plainly visible to him.</p>

  <p>Presently the waning moon came up, making the trail visible in all but the
  deeper recesses of the jungle. Then he heard Malikshah trumpet.</p>

  <p>A moment later, he came out in an open glade near the bank of the river.
  The place was evidently a ford, for the bank was flattened on both sides by
  the tracks of numerous beasts and vehicles, and a road wound away from it in
  both directions.</p>

  <p>He caught sight of Sharma, at once. His little brown friend was seated on
  the neck of Rangini. A little way from them stood Malikshah. The big bull's
  trunk was raised belligerently, and his huge tusks gleamed white in the
  moonlight. It was obvious that something had angered him&mdash;but what?</p>

  <p>Jan gazed into the jungle shadows at the far side of the glade. Something
  was moving there&mdash;something huge and bulky. It trotted out into the
  moonlight, a giant tusker as big as Malikshah. Its attitude, too, was
  belligerent. For a moment it stood there in the open, sniffing the air
  speculatively with upraised trunk&mdash;then trumpeting angrily, it
  charged.</p>

  <p>With equal celerity, Malikshah sprang forward. The two met midway with a
  terrific collision that shook the ground. Then they began savagely butting
  and gouging each other until the shoulders of both were slashed and gored in
  many places.</p>

  <p>Jan ran across the glade to where Sharma sat on the neck of Rangini. The
  boy, intent on the battle of the giants, did not see him until he called.</p>

  <p>"Ho, Sharma. Where does the strange elephant come from?"</p>

  <p>"He is a pariah," the boy replied, "an outcast from all elephant herds
  because of his wicked temper. I have heard of him, but this is the first time
  I have ever seen him. He has killed three bull elephants, and many men,
  women, and children. Hunters have been looking for him, but he has always
  been too cunning for them. Men call him Yama, the Evil One, the King of Hell.
  But his time has come. Malikshah, the mighty fighter, will kill him."</p>

  <p>Indeed, for a time, it did seem that Malikshah was getting the better of
  his fierce adversary, as they fought back and fourth across that trampled
  arena. Swiftly he forced the pariah back along the river bank, and away from
  the ford.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the pariah felt soft mud behind him&mdash;a sink hole. He knew
  that another step backward would doom him to defeat and death. But he was a
  cunning brute&mdash;had it not been for this he would not have lived so long
  to kill helpless natives and terrorize whole villages. So he pretended to
  give ground, then suddenly flung himself to one side.</p>

  <p>Malikshah plunged forward, intending to wheel and renew the attack. But he
  discovered, too late, that he was in soft, yielding mud. He floundered
  desperately in an effort to save himself, but his struggles only sank him
  more deeply into the soft, clinging mire. Soon his legs were completely
  imbedded, and still he was sinking.</p>

  <p>Yama stood watching him for a moment, speculatively. Then, knowing his
  powerful adversary to be helpless, sprang forward to finish him. Malikshah
  trumpeted his anguish as the keen tusks pierced his side.</p>

  <p>As soon as Malikshah begun sinking into the mire, Jan sensed the
  precarious position of the beast who had saved his life. He sprang
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Come back, <i>sahib</i>!" cried Sharma. "You can do nothing! The pariah
  will kill you!"</p>

  <p>But Jan only ran forward the faster, whipping the keen sword from its
  sheath. He came up behind Yama just as the pariah was beginning the thrust
  which was to end the earthly career of Malikshah. Then he swung the sword in
  a terrific blow that half severed the left hind leg of the pariah.</p>

  <p>Yama whirled about, trumpeting in anguish, his little mad eyes glaring
  their hatred. Then he charged, which was precisely what Jan wanted him to do.
  Swiftly as a deer, the jungle man bounded away, leading the limping killer
  from his helpless victim. Having crossed the glade, Jan plunged into the
  jungle and swung himself up into the trees. The mad elephant crashed in after
  him, following more by scent than sight, his questing trunk sniffing and
  exploring.</p>

  <p>Presently he located the jungle man in the tree above him. Instantly, he
  applied his broad head to its trunk, and pushed.</p>

  <p>Feeling his perch toppling beneath him, Jan sprang into another tree. In a
  moment the first had crashed to earth. Seeing that he was not upon it the mad
  elephant turned, and soon located him again by scent. Once more he applied
  his head to the tree in which the jungle man sat.</p>

  <p>Jan might easily have escaped by swinging off through the branches, but he
  did not want to leave this crazed killer here to wreak his fury on the
  helpless Malikshah, and perhaps on Rangini and Sharma as well. So instead of
  trying to run away, he carried the battle to his enemy. Drawing his sword, he
  dropped onto the broad back.</p>

  <p>Instantly the beast's trunk whipped up to seize him, but Jan was ready for
  that. His sword flashed, and four feet of the trunk flew off and fell
  writhing to the ground.</p>

  <p>At this, Yama snorted in helpless rage and pain, and once more dashed out
  into the open glade. Since he could do nothing to the hateful being on his
  back, he charged straight for the first living creatures that met his
  gaze&mdash;Rangini and Sharma.</p>

  <p>Jan thrust his sword to the hilt in that broad back, in the hope of
  finding the huge elephant heart, but with no apparent effect. Then he
  withdrew it, and moving forward, thrust it into the giant neck beside the
  cervical vertebræ. He sliced toward the giant spinal column until the blade
  caught in a crevice between the vertebræ&mdash;and kept on slicing.</p>

  <p>Yama charged up to where Rangini stood. She avoided his charge, and
  turning, inserted her trunk beneath one of his tusks and over another. She
  held him thus, for a moment, then gave a tremendous heave, intending to throw
  him off his feet. But by this time, the sword of the jungle man had sliced
  half through the brute's cervical vertebræ. The sudden heave of Rangini
  completed what the sword had started, snapping the monster's spine asunder
  with a sharp cracking report.</p>

  <p>For a moment the dread killer swayed on his feet, his bloody head twisted
  grotesquely to one side. Then he sank to the ground, dead.</p>

  <p>Jan sprang to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said. "We must get Malikshah out of the mud, or he will sink so
  deeply there will be no help for him."</p>

  <p>Sharma urged Rangini after the jungle man as he ran to where the giant
  bull was mired.</p>

  <p>They went to work methodically&mdash;the man, the boy and the two
  elephants.</p>

  <p>First Jan and Rangini brought large sticks and logs which they placed in
  front of Malikshah. The big bull helped them, pulling the material up close
  to him with his trunk. Then Jan wove a stout rope from jungle creepers, with
  a large knot at each end. Malikshah grasped one knot between his huge molars
  and wound his trunk around the rope. Rangini took hold of the other end in a
  similar manner, and pulled.</p>

  <p>But Malikshah was a heavy elephant, badly mired, and it looked for a time
  as if even the tremendous strength of Rangini would be of no avail. Finally
  he succeeded in getting a foreleg out of the clinging mud, and up onto the
  logs which had been placed in front of him. More tugging on the part of
  Rangini, and up came another foreleg. In a moment he was free, and on solid
  ground once more.</p>

  <p>Trumpeting joyously, he went first to the carcass of his fallen foe,
  sniffed it for a moment, and then ambled down into the water, where Jan
  scrubbed him thoroughly with a large flat stone.</p>

  <p>When he had rid his mount of the clinging mud, Jan had himself lifted to
  the huge head, and rode out to the river bank, where Sharma and Rangini
  waited.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he heard the clatter of horses hoofs coming from across
  the river. Turning, he beheld a party of horsemen approaching. Instantly
  suspicious that they were enemies, he called softly to Sharma, and the two
  rode into the shadows.</p>

  <p>The horsemen splashed across the ford.</p>

  <p>Jan saw that there were more than a score of them. They paused at sight of
  the huge bulk of the slain elephant. One of the riders, a little wizened
  white man, dismounted.</p>

  <p>"Now what could have slain that beast?" he asked in English. "Good lord!
  Not only is he badly gored, but part of his trunk is missing! And his neck is
  broken and partly severed!"</p>

  <p>One of the native riders spoke up.</p>

  <p>"I know not how he met his fate, <i>sahib</i>, but he has come to a most
  fitting end, for this is Yama, the pariah, the killer, the most feared
  elephant in all India. Only last week he slew my little brother and sister in
  a raid on our village."</p>

  <p>Then another voice spoke up.</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr. Whitaker. We have more important business than this post-mortem
  over a rogue elephant. Let us ride on."</p>

  <p>At sound of this voice, Jan suddenly urged his elephant out into the
  open.</p>

  <p>"Father!" he shouted, sliding to the ground.</p>

  <p>Harry Trevor instantly flung himself from his mount and threw his arms
  around his son.</p>

  <p>"Jan, my boy!" he exclaimed. "Where have you been? We heard you were a
  prisoner in the Temple of Kali, and that you were to be sacrificed to the
  Black Goddess, so came as fast as we could in order to rescue you and Ramona.
  Have you seen her?"</p>

  <p>"I have just escaped from the temple," Jan replied, "and know that Ramona
  is there, although I have not seen her. Is she in danger?"</p>

  <p>"In danger!" exclaimed Trevor. "Jan, I'm surprised at you."</p>

  <p>"I did not know but that she was there of her own free will," Jan
  answered.</p>

  <p>"She was kidnaped by the maharaja, and he intends to either force her to
  marry him or kill her. Didn't you see the maharaja?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen nothing of him," Jan replied. "The temple enclosure is large,
  and there are many buildings. He may be there, for there were many soldiers
  armed with rifles, and had it not been for the darkness and the fact that
  they are such poor shots, I would not be alive to tell of it."</p>

  <p>"Half of our mission is accomplished by your safety," said Trevor, "but we
  must now hurry to the rescue of Ramona."</p>

  <p>"I will ride the elephant," said Jan, "and show you the way." He paused
  for a moment to greet Don Francesco. Then he signaled to Malikshah, and the
  big bull instantly lifted him to a seat on his head.</p>

  <p>Jan and Sharma led the procession, which consisted of Trevor, Don
  Francesco, Mr. Whitaker and the British Resident's twenty Sepoys&mdash;brave
  fighters whom Whitaker assured his companions were worth at least a hundred
  of the maharaja's guardsmen.</p>

  <p>On reaching the bronze gate of the temple, Mr. Whitaker beat upon it with
  the butt of his pistol and demanded admission in the name of the British
  Government.</p>

  <p>A shaven headed priest opened a small aperture in the gate and peered out
  at them. "This is holy ground," he said, "and no unbeliever can be
  admitted."</p>

  <p>"It seems you are ready enough to admit them when they are intended for
  sacrifice," said Whitaker. "Open the gates and deliver to us the
  <i>memsahib</i> you hold prisoner here, or we will break them down."</p>

  <p>"There are no prisoners here," lied the priest, "and it is against the law
  and contrary to the tenets of our religion for any <i>sahib</i> to enter this
  place."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Whitaker, "then we will enter without your leave."</p>

  <p>He backed his horse from the opening and motioned to Sharma.</p>

  <p>"See what your elephant can do against those gates," he said. "Better pad
  her head first." Two of his men quickly brought saddle blankets, which were
  bound over Rangini's forehead.</p>

  <p>At this moment a burst of rifle fire came from the loop holes above them
  and the two Sepoys fell to the ground. Their comrades instantly answered the
  fire, and screams of pain from inside the wall made it manifest that some of
  the shots had taken effect.</p>

  <p>The Sepoys picked up their two fallen comrades and covered the retreat of
  Jan, Sharma and the three white men with their fire.</p>

  <p>Whitaker ordered his warriors to deploy in a semi-circle around the
  gateway and then took counsel as to what their next move should be. He had
  not expected armed resistance on the part of the maharaja, and knew that the
  potentate must be very desperate indeed to order his men to fire upon British
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>While they were taking counsel as their next move, the keen eared Jan
  suddenly said, "I hear more horses coming&mdash;many of them."</p>

  <p>"It must be that the maharaja has sent for help," said Whitaker. "We will
  have to withdraw or we will be surrounded and wiped out. Now I know why he so
  fearlessly ordered his men to fire upon us. It is his intention that not one
  of us shall live to tell the story."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE BABU'S LOOT</h2>

  <p class="first">DESPITE the painful wound in his fat neck, Babu Chandra
  Kumar rode happily toward the railway station. Not one, but two money belts
  heavy with gold were buckled around his ample middle. And his greasy turban
  bulged with the wealth of rupees it could scarcely contain.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the station he dismounted and handed the reins to
  Kupta.</p>

  <p>"Gooptoo is very good donkey," he said. "How would you like to own
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I would like very much to own him," Kupta replied.</p>

  <p>"He is worth one hundred rupees, but since I like you so well I will sell
  him to you for fifty."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I can spare but twenty-five for so small and mangy a beast," replied
  the hillman.</p>

  <p>"Make it thirty-five," said the babu, "and he is yours."</p>

  <p>Kupta removed his turban, fished out thirty-five rupees, and handed them
  to the babu. Then he untied the latter's battered suitcase and rusty old
  umbrella from the rear of the saddle and handed them to him.</p>

  <p>"I hope we shall meet again soon, <i>babuji</i>," he said, and tears
  suddenly welled from his eyes. "We have been together a long time, now."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too, my brave comrade," the babu sniveled, tears rolling down
  his fat cheeks. But inwardly he was rejoicing, because he had only paid ten
  rupees for the decrepit donkey which the gullible Kupta had just purchased
  for thirty-five.</p>

  <p>The little hillman mounted and rode away, turning several times to wave
  farewell.</p>

  <p>Babu Chandra Kuma sighed, smiled, and picking up suitcase and umbrella,
  walked into the tiny railway station.</p>

  <p>"When is next train for Howrah?" he asked the young babu in the ticket
  office, with a superior air.</p>

  <p>"Next train will arrive in ten minutes," the clerk replied.</p>

  <p>"Then sell me one second class tikkut&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got no further, for at this moment he felt something sharp pricking him
  in the back. Turning, he beheld a huge scar-faced man with a flame-red
  hennaed beard&mdash;and his knees almost collapsed beneath him.</p>

  <p>"<i>Adab babuji</i>!" rumbled Zafarulla Khan. "Will you come quietly, or
  shall I thrust the knife clear through you?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Adab araz</i>," replied the babu, turning pale and essaying a sickly
  smile. "Of course I will come with you. Am very glad to see you."</p>

  <p>He waddled out of the station with the tall Pathan close at his side.</p>

  <p>"Did you wish to speak to me privately?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very privately," Zafarulla Khan told him. "This place will not do at all.
  It is entirely too public."</p>

  <p>He took the babu's fat arm in his iron grasp and marched him down the road
  to the place where his men awaited him in a little secluded glade.</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan prodded the money-laden midriff of the babu and
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"A fat sheep ready for the shearing," he said. Then he asked: "Will you
  remove those money belts yourself, or shall I take them off for you?"</p>

  <p>"What money belts?" asked the babu, blandly.</p>

  <p>"So! You are going to lie about it!" growled the Pathan, with a fierce
  look and a significant wave of the knife.</p>

  <p>"No, I will take them off," said the babu hastily, unbuckling the two
  belts and dropping them at his feet.</p>

  <p>"Pick them up, you swine," roared Zafarulla Khan.</p>

  <p>The babu bent over to comply. As he did so, his turban fell off with a
  loud clink.</p>

  <p>"Hah! What's this? By the beard of the prophet, on whom be peace and
  Allah's blessing! By the holy well of Zem Zem, and by the Hatim Wall! You
  have been hiding some money from me! I should cut off your head for
  this!"</p>

  <p>The babu was trembling as if with the ague.</p>

  <p>"Pray spare your humble and unworthy slave," he whined. "I was so
  frightened by that big knife of yours that I forgot about the few rupees in
  my turban."</p>

  <p>One of the Pathans who had picked it up shook the last rupee from the
  babu's greasy headpiece. Then he clapped it back on his shaven head.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ZAFARULLA KHAN buckled the two heavy money belts beneath his
  sash. The rest of the money was put into a saddle bag. All was to be divided
  later.</p>

  <p>"Not only will we spare your life; we will see you off for Howrah," said
  Zafarulla Khan, grinning broadly. "We should be ungrateful swine, did we not
  see you off, after the magnificent and princely gift you have bestowed upon
  us in farewell."</p>

  <p>The babu was hustled back to the roadway. The Pathans all mounted their
  horses, except Zafarulla Khan, who led his as he walked beside the babu.</p>

  <p>Before they reached the station, the train pulled in, stopped for a
  moment, and rumbled on.</p>

  <p>"You've missed your train," said Zafarulla Khan. "That's too bad. But the
  track is still there, and fortunately you still have your legs. If you will
  use them to good purpose, perhaps you may save your head."</p>

  <p>The babu waddled into the station and recovered his suitcase and umbrella.
  Both were so shabby that no one had bothered to steal them.</p>

  <p>The clerk looked at him curiously as he waddled out.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, <i>babuji</i>," called Zafarulla Khan, as the babu started off
  down the track. "May good health and prosperity attend you."</p>

  <p>Weeping copiously, the tears running down his fat jowls, the babu plodded
  doggedly away in the direction of Howrah, suitcase in one hand and umbrella
  in the other.</p>

  <p>The Pathans laughed uproariously, as they watched him depart. Then
  Zafarulla Khan turned and swung into his saddle. He was about to give the
  command to ride away, when the words stuck in his throat. For a hundred
  Rajput warriors armed with rifles suddenly rode in upon them from all
  directions. Their leader, a huge, black-bearded warrior, reined his mount to
  a halt beside that of the Pathan chieftan.</p>

  <p>"<i>Salaam aleykum</i>, Zafarulla Khan," he said.</p>

  <p>"<i>Aleykum salaam</i>, Mahmood," the Pathan replied. "Were you looking
  for some one?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ayewah</i>! We were looking, but our search has ended. You and your
  men will surrender your weapons and loot, and come with us at once."</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan looked around at the menacing rifle barrels of the Rajputs,
  and knew that they meant business. He also knew that if he and his men
  resisted they would be shot down without mercy.</p>

  <p>"In Allah's name," he asked, "What is the meaning of this? We are but
  peaceful horse-traders who came down to the station to see a friend off."</p>

  <p>"I saw you following your friend, and guessed your purpose," said Mahmood.
  "You are under arrest for raiding the camp of the Maharaja of Varuda in
  British territory, and for abducting the <i>memsahib</i>, Ramona Suarez.
  Also, you have just committed a robbery in Rissapur territory. Now surrender
  at once, or it will be the worse for you."</p>

  <p>Zafarulla Khan cringed and blustered by turns. He called upon all the
  Moslem saints and prophets to bear witness that he was innocent. But in the
  end he and his men were compelled to turn over their weapons and their
  loot.</p>

  <p>Then, with their hands bound behind their backs, and their horses led by
  stalwart Rajputs, they rode back to Rissapur, the prisoners of its
  maharaja.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE MIGHT OF KALI</h2>

  <p class="first">DRIVEN back from their position before the temple gate, and
  with a possible flank attack by the approaching horsemen imminent, Trevor,
  Don Francesco, Whitaker and Jan took council as to their next move.</p>

  <p>Whitaker insisted that the maharaja would not have dared to order his men
  to fire upon British troops unless he was positive that none of the party
  would escape alive.</p>

  <p>"Why it would be suicidal for him," said the British resident. "He might
  be able to prove his innocence on the charge of kidnaping. For all we know,
  he may be the victim of a plot engineered by the priests of Kali. But he can
  never beat such a charge as this if one of us escapes alive. The conclusion
  is obvious."</p>

  <p>"Whether the approaching horsemen are his men, or others," said Trevor,
  "we can do Ramona no good by waiting here. We must force our way into the
  temple somehow, and quickly, if we are to save her."</p>

  <p>"I doubt that he would dare to go so far as to sacrifice the girl to his
  hideous black goddess," said Whitaker. "Why, if he should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the booming of the huge gong within the temple.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Trevor asked.</p>

  <p>It means that there is to be a sacrifice made to the Black Mother,
  <i>sahib</i>," a Sepoy replied.</p>

  <p>"In that case we must get inside quickly," said Jan, "for Ramona is in
  deadly danger." He turned to Whitaker. "If you will keep the marksmen above
  the gate occupied, try to crash through with Malikshah."</p>

  <p>"We can keep them occupied for a while," said Whitaker, doubtfully, "but I
  don't know how long."</p>

  <p>"I'll ride in with you, my boy, and shoot from the elephant's back," said
  Trevor.</p>

  <p>"I, also," cried Don Francesco. "It is my little daughter, my beloved
  baby, that these demons would torture and slay."</p>

  <p>Swiftly, with the help of Sharma, Jan bound a pad on the forehead of the
  huge bull. Then he mounted to Malikshah's neck. Another pad was strapped on
  the elephant's broad back, and on this Trevor and Don Francesco took their
  places, repeating rifles in their hands and pistols holstered at their
  hips.</p>

  <p>At a word from Jan, the giant bull plunged forward.</p>

  <p>"Commence firing," cried Whitaker.</p>

  <p>Spurts of flame leaped out from the surrounding jungle as the eighteen
  remaining Sepoys went into action.</p>

  <p>Malikshah charged up to the gate, the jungle man crouching on his neck and
  urging him forward, while Trevor and Don Francesco coolly picked off such
  turbaned heads as came within their line of vision. The elephant applied his
  head to the gate, and pushed. It was a strongly built gate, but could not
  resist the tremendous weight that the big bull hurled against it, and crashed
  inward at the first onslaught.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the riders who had been heard at a distance some time
  before, and whom the British Resident had suspected of being the Maharaja of
  Varuda's men, came charging up, yelling and waving their rifles. They were
  Rajputs, and at their head rode Abdur Rahman, Maharaja of Rissapur.</p>

  <p>As Malikshah went crashing through the gate into the temple enclosure, the
  Rajputs stormed in after him, deploying to the right and left, and shooting
  down guards and priests alike.</p>

  <p>Jan guided the elephant straight across the gardens and up the steps of
  the temple. Straight through the great arched doorway he charged, and into
  the midst of a startled throng of priests, musicians and dancing girls.</p>

  <p>Jan instantly caught sight of Ramona crouched against the bars of the
  cage, with the tigress springing toward her. Leaping to the platform, drawn
  sword in hand, he came up behind the girl just as the tigress reared up to
  seize her. He thrust his sword through the bars, straight at the black furry
  throat, and the black tigress, taken by surprise, sprang back with a snarl of
  pain and rage.</p>

  <p>Jan did not bother to go to the gate&mdash;indeed, there was no time for
  that. Instead, he gripped his sword with his teeth, and seizing the two bars
  against which Ramona leaned half aswoon, he bent them apart, exerting the
  terrific strength which his splendid physique and jungle training had given
  him, caught the girl as she fell, and pulled her clear just as the tigress
  leaped for the second time.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Maharaja of Varuda had risen and rushed toward the cage
  at this unexpected interruption of his bloody ceremony. As the tigress sprang
  out of the cage, he shouted:</p>

  <p>"Slay them, O Black Mother! Rend their bodies and drink their blood! Show
  them the power and the might of Kali!"</p>

  <p>The tigress, attracted by the sound of his voice, turned, then suddenly
  sprang straight for him, seized his face in her huge jaws and bore him to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Harry Trevor whipped his rifle to his shoulder and fired two shots, one
  through her head and one through her heart. Without a sound she sank lifeless
  beside the body of her victim.</p>

  <p>The Sepoys and Rajputs had meanwhile broken into the temple, striking down
  the priests and guards who attempted to halt them, and taking all others
  prisoners. The musicians and dancing were huddled into a corner like a flock
  of frightened sheep.</p>

  <p>Trevor seized the dead tigress by the scruff of the neck, and dragged her
  away from the head of the maharaja. His face was gone&mdash;completely bitten
  away.</p>

  <p>"God!" exclaimed Trevor. "God, what a sight!"</p>

  <p>"It is a judgment upon him," said Whitaker with a shudder. "He besought
  Kali to turn her might against us, and it was turned upon himself
  instead."</p>

  <p>The maharaja seemed trying to speak. There was a movement from the place
  that had once been his mouth, and a few bloody bubbles issued from the gaping
  wound. Then he shivered from head to foot and lay still.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," said Don Francesco. "May God have mercy on his black
  soul."</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a cry of "Fire!" from one of the shrill voiced dancing
  girls, and a billowing cloud of smoke poured from the rear of the temple. In
  the battle which had just ended, some one had evidently knocked down a
  cresset behind the great black idol. Once started, the ancient, seasoned
  timbers burned like matchwood.</p>

  <p>Still holding the senseless form of Ramona in his arms, Jan shouted a
  command to Malikshah. The huge beast lifted the two of them to his head, and
  led the swift exodus from the burning temple.</p>

  <p>In the garden outside, the prisoners were herded together, and the
  warriors once more mounted their horses. Soon the temple became a roaring
  inferno of flame, which cast such a terrific amount of heat that it was
  impossible to remain within the temple enclosure.</p>

  <p>In orderly array the Rajputs and Sepoys rode out with their prisoners.
  Pausing at some distance from the gate, they watched the progress of the fire
  for a time. It soon spread to the buildings constructed against the wall of
  the enclosure, and the leaping flames lit the night sky in the vicinity with
  a lurid radiance.</p>

  <p>Abdur Rahman, Trevor, Don Francesco and Whitaker stood in a little group,
  watching the conflagration. Sharma, the better to see the fire, had retained
  his seat on the neck of Rangini.</p>

  <p>Jan and Ramona sat together on the pad which had been strapped to the
  broad back of Malikshah. Her head was resting on his shoulder and his face
  was very close to hers.</p>

  <p>"Can you forgive me, Ramona," he asked, "for even thinking that night on
  the boat that it was you who tried to kill me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, beloved," she replied.</p>

  <p>Their lips met, and the sly old Malikshah, who had lived among men for a
  hundred years, and had seen many generations of lovers, flicked an
  appreciative ear.</p>

  <p>Trevor nudged Don Francesco.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the love birds have made up their quarrel," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is the way of all who truly love, <i>amigo</i>," replied Don
  Francesco. "We should congratulate them, but perhaps it will be best to do so
  later. One should not interrupt the course of true love at a moment like
  this."</p>
